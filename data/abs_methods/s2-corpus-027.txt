 2007294570,BACKGROUND,The aim of this study was to investigate the feasibility of main pulmonary artery diameter quantification by thoracic computerized tomography CT in the diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension seconder to biomass smoke exposure  
 2007294570,MATERIAL AND METHODS,One hundred and four women subjects with biomass smoke exposure and 20 healthy women subjects were enrolled in the prospective study The correlation between echocardiographic estimation of systolic pulmonary artery pressure and the main pulmonary artery diameter of the cases were studied  
 2007294570,RESULTS,The main pulmonary artery diameter was 26 9 5 1 in the control subjects and 37 1 6 4 in subjects with biomass smoke exposure This difference was statistically significant p 0 001 The systolic pulmonary artery pressure was 22 7 12 4 in the control subjects and 57 3 22 in subjects with biomass smoke exposure This difference was statistically significant p 0 001 Systolic pulmonary artery pressure was significantly correlated with the main pulmonary artery diameter r 0 614 p 0 01 A receiver operating characteristic ROC curve analysis showed that a value of 29 mm of the main pulmonary artery diameter differentiated between pulmonary hypertension and non pulmonary hypertension patients The sensitivity of the measurement to diagnose pulmonary hypertension was 91 and specificity was 80  
 2007294570,CONCLUSIONS,Our results indicate that main pulmonary artery diameter measurements by SCT may suggest presence of pulmonary hypertension in biomass smoke exposed women
