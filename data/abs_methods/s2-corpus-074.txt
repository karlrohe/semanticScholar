 622525863,METHODS,A retrospective cross sectional study involving patients zero to 24 months of age who were hospitalized with acute bronchiolitis was conducted  
 622525863,RESULTS,A total of 835 paediatric patients with acute bronchiolitis were admitted to the paediatric ward between January 2010 and December 2012 The mean SD age at diagnosis was 3 47 2 99 months There were 325 39 girls and 510 61 boys For the purpose of data analysis the patient population was divided into three groups group 1 included children hospitalized with respiratory syncytial virus RSV bronchiolitis group 2 included children hospitalized with clinical bronchiolitis with no virus detected and group 3 included children hospitalized with clinical bronchiolitis due to a respiratory virus other than RSV Results revealed that urinary tract infection was present in 10 of patients and was most common in group 3 13 4 followed by group 2 9 7 and was least common in group 1 6 P 0 030  
 622525863,CONCLUSIONS,The possibility of a urinary tract infection should be considered in a febrile child with a diagnosis of bronchiolitis particularly if the trigger is a respiratory virus other than RSV
