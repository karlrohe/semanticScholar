 2563267556,METHODS,The study enrolled consecutive patients having refractive lens exchange and implantation of rotationally asymmetric multifocal IOLs Group 1 received bilateral SBL 3 IOLs and Group 2 received bilateral Lentis Mplus LS 312 MF30 IOLs with the near segments placed inferonasally in each group Group 3 received a Lentis Mplus LS 312 MF20 IOL in the dominant eye with the near segment positioned superotemporal and a Lenstec SBL 3 IOL positioned inferonasally in the fellow eye Binocular uncorrected UDVA and corrected distance visual acuities binocular uncorrected near UNVA and intermediate UIVA visual acuities binocular distance corrected near and intermediate visual acuities and quality of vision were evaluated over 3 months postoperatively  
 2563267556,RESULTS,The study enrolled 180 patients 360 eyes There was no significant difference between the groups in binocular UDVA UIVA and UNVA however there was a significant difference between the groups in quality of vision P    001 Group 3 had significantly better overall quality of vision

 1999493028,METHODS,We searched Medline Embase and Wanfang databases for literature on the populations of Tregs in HCC patients and controls using the pooled OR and 95 CIs for assessment There were no limitations with respect to publication date or language The references of qualifying articles were also searched We excluded studies with unclear data or overlapping studies Twenty three studies met our criteria and the quality of these studies was assessed using the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network SIGN The meta analysis of association between Tregs and HCC was undertaken using the random effects approach as described by DerSimonian and Laird Subgroup analysis was performed when at least three studies were available Potential publication bias was assessed by visual inspection of the funnel plot and an asymmetric plot suggested possible publication bias  
 1999493028,RESULTS,Twenty three studies with a total of 1279 HCC patients and 547 healthy volunteers as controls were enrolled The frequency of circulating Tregs in HCC patients was 87 higher than in healthy controls OR 1 87 95 CI 1 49 2 34 The frequency of Tregs in the HCC tumor microenvironment was significantly higher than that in tumor surrounding tissue and biopsy specimens from healthy livers OR 4 04 95 CI 2 10 7 79 P 0 000 OR 2 869 95 CI 2 16 3 82 P 0 000 However subgroup analyses based on the different types of tumors or patient characteristics such as tumor size tumor number or α fetoprotein AFP levels in HCC patients showed that populations of Tregs as a whole were not significantly changed between groups P 0 05 for all
