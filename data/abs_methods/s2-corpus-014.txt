 1500220994,MATERIALS AND METHODS,Dermatitis was induced by repeated application of 2 4 dinitrofluorobenzene DNFB in NC Nga mice After a topical application of CBBF on the skin lesions the dermatitis score epidermal thickness mast cell number and interleukin IL 4 and interferon IFN γ as well as the levels of histamine and immunoglobulin E IgE in the serum were measured Moreover effect of CBBF on histamine release was examined using RBL 2H3 under stimulation with 2 4 dinitrophenylated bovine serum albumin DNP BSA  
 1500220994,RESULTS,CBBF inhibited atopic dermatitis symptoms and signs in the DNFB treated NC Nga mice The suppressive activity of topically applied CBBF may be due to the dose dependent blockade of a series of immunopathological events including the release of histamine the production of IgE and the secretion of IL 4 and IFN γ However this extract did not directly suppress the degranulation process assessed by measuring β hexosaminidase release  
 1500220994,CONCLUSIONS,Our results suggest that CBBF can be applied as an effective herbal remedy to treat atopic dermatitis  

 2286874251,BACKGROUND,The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of long and short term systemic usage of royal jelly on bone formation in the expanded maxillary suture in a rat model  
 2286874251,MATERIAL AND METHODS,Twenty eight Wistar albino rats were randomly divided into 4 equal groups Control C Only Expansion OE Royal Jelly RJ group Royal Jelly was given to rats by oral gavage only during the expansion and retention period Royal Jelly plus Nursery RJN group Royal Jelly was given to rats by oral gavage during their nursery phase of 40 days and during the retention period After the 5 day expansion period was completed the rats underwent 12 days of mechanical retention All rats were sacrificed in same time Histological examination was performed to determine the number of osteoclasts number of osteoblasts number of capillaries inflammatory cell infiltration and new bone formation  
 2286874251,RESULTS,New bone formation number of osteoclasts number of osteoblasts and the number of capillaries in the expanded maxillary sutures were higher in the RJ and RJN groups than in the other groups Statistical analysis also demonstrated that new bone formation and the number of osteoblasts was also highest in the RJN group  
 2286874251,CONCLUSIONS,The systemic administration of Royal Jelly in conjunction with rapid maxillary expansion may increase the quality of regenerated bone
