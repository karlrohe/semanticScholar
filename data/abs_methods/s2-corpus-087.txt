 67648626,METHODS,The double whole cell patch clamp technique was applied to isolated cell pairs obtained from mouse lens epithelium and a continuous cell line of lens epithelial cells derived from the sheep lens SLE 2 1  
 67648626,RESULTS,The junctional conductance in mouse lens epithelial cells and in cultured SLE 2 1 cells was found to be moderately voltage dependent SLE 2 1 cells were analyzed in more detail The voltage dependence could be described by a Boltzmann distribution with Vo 63 1 mV and Gmin 0 34 In cell pairs that exhibited spontaneously low junctional conductance single channel events could be distinguished Single gap junction channel currents had a linear current voltage relationship A frequency histogram of single channel conductances from eight cell pairs had three major peaks of 35 60 and 97 pS

 1978798939,BACKGROUND,Leucine rich glioma inactivated 1 LGI1 is a component of the voltage gated potassium channel complex IgG antibodies against LGI1 are associated with immunotherapy responsive encephalitis and epilepsies LGI1 antibody concentrations are 10 100 times greater in serum than in cerebrospinal fluid CSF Oligoclonal IgG bands are rarely found in patients with LGI1 antibody encephalitis or epilepsy These observations raise questions about the sources of the B cells that result in production of LGI1 antibodies and how the IgGs reach the brain We aimed to investigate the migration and expansions of peripheral and central B cells to the production of LGI1 specific IgG  
 1978798939,METHODS,We performed PCR amplification and next generation deep immune repertoire sequencing of immunoglobulin Ig heavy chain variable regions VH from CSF and subsorted peripheral blood B cell populations from two patients with limbic encephalitis and faciobrachial dystonic seizures associated with LGI1 antibodies Bioinformatics clustering of related IgM VH or IgG VH transcripts was used to determine whether active B cell diversification could be observed and whether intrathecal B cell repertoires if present were related to peripheral B cells
