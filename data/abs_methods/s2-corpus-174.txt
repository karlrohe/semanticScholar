 3002248433,OBJECTIVE,The purpose of this study was to describe incidence and assess predictors of adherence to Positive Airway Pressure PAP therapy for Obstructive Sleep Apnea OSA in persons with acquired brain injury ABI  
 3002248433,METHODS,A 2012 2015 retrospective analysis of consecutive ABI patients admitted for neurorehabilitation referred for polysomnography PSG and prescribed PAP for OSA Univariable linear regressions were conducted to examine predictors of average hours of nightly PAP use Univariable logistic regressions were conducted to examine predictors of PAP adherence using the conventional clinical definition of 4 h per night 70 of the time Persons with traumatic etiology were separately analyzed  
 3002248433,RESULTS,ABI etiology was 51 traumatic 36 stroke and 13 other nontraumatic causes Nearly two thirds were nonadherent to PAP For the overall sample higher average nightly PAP usage was significantly predicted by positive hypertension diagnosis β   0 271 p   0 019 Likewise greater adherence based on the conventional cutoff was predicted by poorer motor functioning at hospital admission OR   0 98 p   0 001 and lower oxygen saturation nadir OR   0 99 p   0 003 For those with traumatic injuries greater adherence was predicted by poorer functional status at hospital admission OR   0 98 p   0 010 and positive hypertension diagnosis OR   0 16 p   0 023  
 3002248433,CONCLUSIONS,In this study of hospitalized neurorehabilitation patients with ABI and comorbid OSA predictors of adherence included lower oxygen saturation poorer functional status and hypertension diagnosis perhaps signifying the role of greater severity of illness on treatment adherence High rates of refusal and nonadherence to frontline PAP therapy for sleep apnea is a concern for persons in recovery form ABI who are at a time of critical neural repair

 2079945399,BACKGROUND,Several risk factors for suicide have been identified We assessed the relative risks and population attributable risks of suicide associated with various socioeconomic factors and with previous mental illness that necessitated hospital admission Our aim was to assist in the choice of potential strategies for preventing suicide in the general population  
 2079945399,METHODS,We did a population based nested case control study based on register data Data were collected on a random 5 sample of the Danish population aged 16 78 years during a 15 year period 1980 94 and analysed with conditional logistic regression

 2061835083,OBJECTIVES,The purpose of our study was to evaluate the results of endovascular treatment of symptomatic vertebro basilar insufficiency VBI unresponsive to medical therapy  
 2061835083,METHODS,Cardiac patients regularly followed in our cardiology clinic with symptoms suggestive of posterior fossa ischemia diagnosed by the attending cardiologist had diagnostic or suspicious findings of vertebral artery stenosis on ultrasound evaluation with reversed vertebral flow on Doppler examination These patients were referred for selective vertebral and subclavian artery angiography All patients 17 men 11 women mean age of 64 years range 54 87 had critical lesions 70 stenosis in the vertebral or pre vertebral subclavian arteries or both After confirmation of the severity of the lesions and feasibility for revascularization all these patients underwent percutaneous intervention and stent placement All patients were followed up through clinic visits for a mean of 14 2 months range 3 5 24 3  
 2061835083,RESULTS,In our 28 patients that were treated 25 vertebral and 10 subclavian stents were placed Success 20 residual diameter stenosis without stroke or death was achieved in 27 patients 96 One patient undergoing intervention for an ostial subtotal occlusion of the left subclavian artery developed a minor posterior fossa transient ischemic attack At follow up 25 patients 89 were alive and 22 88 of those had no further neurologic complaints Three 11 patients that had vertebral artery stents died during follow up from cardiac complications unrelated to the neurovascular intervention One patient 3 5 had recurrent symptoms with in stent restenosis at 6 months with successful balloon angioplasty and resolution of symptoms The two other patients with persistent symptoms only dizziness had no evidence of restenosis and underwent further work up that has not clarified the etiology  
 2061835083,CONCLUSIONS,Posterior fossa ischemia is an under diagnosed condition that occurs with relative frequency in cardiac patients Awareness of this condition and adequate non invasive testing permits identification of these patients Endovascular treatment using coronary wires and stents including drug eluting stents seems to be the treatment of choice for vertebral artery revascularization due to the high technical success rate low complication rate and long term durability

 2161347075,OBJECTIVE,We performed this study to validate the single beat estimation of end systolic elastance E es in an animal model of chronic mitral regurgitation MR and to use E es to predict postoperative left ventricular LV systolic function with the noninvasively derived single beat E es E es s in patients with MR  
 2161347075,METHODS,Eight sheep with MR were studied under 4 different loading conditions E es was measured as the slope of the end systolic pressure volume relationship with a conductance catheter during inferior vena cava occlusion E es s was calculated using a bilinearly approximated time varying elastance curve We also studied 105 patients with MR who had undergone mitral valve repair All measurements in these patients were performed before surgery and repeated at about 1 week after surgery  
 2161347075,RESULTS,In the animals in a total of 23 different stages E es s showed a good correlation and agreement with invasively determined E es y 0 84 x 0 38 r 0 8 P 01 mean difference 0 1 0 6 mm Hg mL In the clinical study preoperative E es s r 0 77 P 001 and end systolic volume index correlated well with postoperative ejection fraction r 0 69 P 001 Multivariate analyses revealed that only E es s was an independent predictor of postoperative LV function Preoperative E es s less than or equal to 1 0 mm Hg mL was most predictive for identifying patients with LV dysfunction after surgery sensitivity 87 specificity 76  
 2161347075,CONCLUSIONS,LV end systolic elastance can be estimated noninvasively and is useful to detect latent LV dysfunction in patients with MR before surgery
