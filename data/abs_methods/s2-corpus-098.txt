 2588652938,BACKGROUND,The combination of 5 fluorouracil 5 FU and folinic acid FA is an active combination for the treatment of advanced breast cancer ABC Theoretically the biologically active isomer of FA 1 FA should be more effective than racemic FA in modulating 5 FU activity  
 2588652938,PATIENTS AND METHODS,Thirty three patients pts with ABC all previously treated with an anthracycline based combination for advanced disease were treated with 1 FA 100 mg m2 i v and 5 FU 370 mg m2 i v for 5 consecutive days every 4 weeks  
 2588652938,RESULTS,Three complete remission CR and 11 partial remission PR were obtained for an overall response rate of 42 95 CI 25 59 Median duration of response was 10 months median survival was 15 months for responders 11 months for NC and 3 for PD Eleven pts experienced a WHO grade III IV oral mucositis 33 6 pts had grade III and one grade IV diarrhea two pts had grade IV neutropenia resulting in one toxic death  
 2588652938,CONCLUSIONS,In this heavily pretreated population of pts with ABC this regimen showed an interesting activity with substantial toxicity Both the response rate and the pattern of side effects seem similar to those experienced with the racemic mixture of d 1 FA Modulated 5 FU warrants an increasing consideration in the treatment of breast cancer  

 1927362421,PARTICIPANTS MATERIALS SETTING METHODS,Among 5076 consecutive women 4894 women had their AMH FT4 TSH and anti TPO levels measured on the same day AMH levels were plotted in relation to age for the whole patients cohort and age specific AMH values per year were considered in order to categorize women according to the AMH levels of ovarian reserve There were 3929 women who demonstrated normal reserve 487 women who had low ovarian reserve and 478 women who demonstrated high ovarian reserve  
 1927362421,MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE,Serum FT4 and TSH levels were comparable between different ovarian reserve categories P 0 611 and 0 811 respectively No significant differences were observed in the prevalence of positive anti TPO antibodies among women with low 12 1 normal 10 3 and high 9 8 ovarian reserve P 0 423 Finally the prevalence of overt or subclinical hypothyroidism was comparable between the groups 4 1 in low 4 6 in normal and 3 8 in high ovarian reserve women P 0 645 Analysis according to the exact cause of low ovarian reserve demonstrated that women with a genetic cause of low ovarian reserve had a significantly higher prevalence of overt hypothyroidism and subclinical hypothyroidism compared with women with unexplained low ovarian reserve for their age 25 versus 3 2 P 0 002 and 18 8 versus 1 6 P 0 004 respectively On the contrary no significant differences were observed in the prevalence of hypothyroidism between genetic causes and iatrogenic causes P 0 316 and between iatrogenic and unexplained causes P 0 219 of low ovarian reserve
