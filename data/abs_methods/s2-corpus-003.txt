 2038504814,BACKGROUND,An in vitro steroidogenesis assay using the human adrenocortical carcinoma cell line H295R is being evaluated as a possible screening assay to detect and assess the impact of endocrine active chemicals EACs capable of altering steroid biosynthesis Data interpretation and their quantitative use in human and ecological risk assessments can be enhanced with mechanistic computational models to help define mechanisms of action and improve understanding of intracellular concentration response behavior  
 2038504814,OBJECTIVES,The goal of this study was to develop a mechanistic computational model of the metabolic network of adrenal steroidogenesis to estimate the synthesis and secretion of adrenal steroids in human H295R cells and their biochemical response to steroidogenesis disrupting EAC  
 2038504814,METHODS,We developed a deterministic model that describes the biosynthetic pathways for the conversion of cholesterol to adrenal steroids and the kinetics for enzyme inhibition by metryrapone MET a model EAC Using a nonlinear parameter estimation method the model was fitted to the measurements from an in vitro steroidogenesis assay using H295R cells  
 2038504814,RESULTS,Model predicted steroid concentrations in cells and culture medium corresponded well to the time course measurements from control and MET exposed cells A sensitivity analysis indicated the parameter uncertainties and identified transport and metabolic processes that most influenced the concentrations of primary adrenal steroids aldosterone and cortisol  
 2038504814,CONCLUSIONS,Our study demonstrates the feasibility of using a computational model of steroidogenesis to estimate steroid concentrations in vitro This capability could be useful to help define mechanisms of action for poorly characterized chemicals and mixtures in support of predictive hazard and risk assessments with EACs

 2076910293,METHODS,We reviewed 140 patients 94 males 46 females age range 73 0 11 1 year who underwent RFA between February 2006 and November 2008 with a modified protocol using a limited power delivery rather than a conventional one to avoid popping All the patients provided their written informed consent and the study was approved by the institutional review board Intraprocedural impedances were measured for the study subjects and the tumors were classified into three types according to the characteristics of their impedance curves increasing flat or decreasing The tumors were further sorted into seven subtypes A G depending on the curvature of the impedance curve s increase or decrease Relative popping rates were determined for the three types and seven subtypes A chi square test was performed to estimate statistical significance  
 2076910293,RESULTS,A total of 148 nodules treated by RFA were analyzed The study samples included 132 nodules of hepatocellular carcinoma 14 nodules of metastatic liver cancer and two nodules of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma The numbers of nodules with each impedance curve type were as follows 37 increasing type nodules 43 flat type nodules and 68 decreasing type nodules Popping occurrence rates were 24 3 46 5 and 64 7 respectively Flat type nodules exhibited a significantly higher rate of popping compared to increasing type nodules P 0 039 Decreasing type nodules exhibited a significantly higher rate of popping compared to increasing type nodules P 0 0001 Notably nodules that showed a sharp decrease in impedance in the latter ablation period subtype E exhibited a significantly higher rate of popping compared to other subtypes
