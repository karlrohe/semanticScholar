 2059521335,OBJECTIVES,To describe the prevalence and severity of symptoms among a large representative cohort of newly diagnosed cancer patients  
 2059521335,METHODS,We collected survey data about symptoms pain fatigue depression nausea vomiting cough dyspnea and diarrhea from 5422 patients with incident lung and colorectal cancer from the diverse nationally representative Cancer Care Outcomes Research and Surveillance Consortium cohort We described the prevalence of any symptoms and moderate severe symptoms approximately four to six months after diagnosis We used logistic regression to identify patient and clinical characteristics associated with symptoms and calculated adjusted proportions of patients with symptoms  
 2059521335,RESULTS,In total 5067 93 5 patients reported at least one symptom in the four weeks before their survey with 51 reporting at least one moderate severe symptom Lung cancer patients reported more symptoms than colorectal cancer patients Patients who received treatment or had more comorbidities were more likely to report symptoms For example after adjustment patients who received chemotherapy during the six weeks before the survey were more likely than others to report at least one symptom 97 3 vs 90 8 P 0 001 and at least one moderate severe symptom 56 8 vs 46 2 P 0 001 After adjustment early vs late stage patients did not differ in reports of at least one symptom 93 6 vs 93 4 P 0 853 and differed only slightly in reports of at least one moderate severe symptom 53 3 vs 49 6 P 0 009
