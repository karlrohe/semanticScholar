 ,BACKGROUND,In this study we examine the effect of previous percutaneous intervention on the rate of adverse perioperative outcome in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery CABG  
 ,METHODS,Outcomes of 240 CABG patients collected consecutively in an observational study were compared Gp A n 35 had prior PCI before CABG and Gp B n 205 underwent primary CABG  
 ,RESULTS,Statistically significant results were obtained for the following preoperative criteria previous myocardial infarction 48 6 vs 36 6 P 0 003 distribution of CAD P 0 0001 unstable angina 45 7 vs 39 P 0 04 For intraoperative data the total number of established bypasses was 2 6 GpA vs 2 07 Gp B P 0 017 with the number of arterial bypass grafts being 20 vs 13 P ns Regarding the postoperative course no significant difference in troponine I rate 24 hour bleeding 962 ml Gp A vs 798 ml Gp B P 0 004 transfusion PRBC unit 3 63 Gp A vs 2 5 Gp B P 0 006 Previous PCI emerged as an independent predictor of postoperative in hospital mortality OR 2 24 95 CI 1 52 2 75 P 0 01  
 ,METHODS_DIFF,Outcomes of 240 CABG patients collected consecutively in an observational study were compared Gp A n 35 had prior PCI before CABG and Gp B n 205 underwent primary CABG
