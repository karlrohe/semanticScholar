 765738677,BACKGROUND,In Japan patients with malignant glioma have been treated with BCNU wafers Gliadel since January 2013 Several adverse events AEs associated with implantation of BCNU wafers including cerebral edema or cyst formation are recognized Here we report a retrospective review of the experience with implantation of BCNU wafers in our institutions and our findings regarding the risk factors for the AEs  
 765738677,METHODS,We reviewed the records of patients with malignant glioma who were implanted with BCNU wafers between April 2013 and September 2014 Their AEs were examined clinically and radiologically and evaluated according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events CTCAE grading For investigating the association between risk factors and incidence of AEs histological diagnosis extent of resection and period of BCNU wafers implantation surgery were selected as possible risk factors  
 765738677,RESULTS,Twenty one patients were included in this investigation There were no associations among incidence of AEs and histological diagnosis or extent of tumor resection However regarding the period of BCNU wafers implantation additional resection for newly diagnosed tumors and resection for recurrent tumors tended to increase the rate and severity of AEs especially cerebral edema compared to primary resection
