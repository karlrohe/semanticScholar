 3012905273,METHODS,Twenty seven treatment naive patients with major depressive disorder MDD and 27 controls were enrolled All of them were scanned with resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging  fMRI at baseline and 15 patients were rescanned after two week rTMS The amplitude of low frequency fluctuation ALFF and functional connection degree FCD based on voxels and 3 brain networks default mode network DMN central executive network CEN salience network SN were used as imaging indicators to analyze The correlations of brain imaging changes after rTMS with clinical efficacy were calculated  
 3012905273,RESULTS,At baseline patients groups showed increased ALFF in the right orbital frontal cortex OFC and decreased ALFF in the left striatal cortex and medial prefrontal cortex PFC while increased FCD in the right dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and OFC and decreased FCD in the right inferior parietal lobe and in the CEN After rTMS patients showed increased ALFF in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex DLPFC and superior frontal gyrus FCD in the right dorsal anterior cingulate cortex superior temporal gyrus and CEN as well as decreased FCD in the bilateral lingual gyrus than pre rTMS These rTMS induced neuroimaging changes did not significantly correlated with clinical effecacy  
 3012905273,CONCLUSIONS,This study indicated that rTMS resulted in changes of ALFF and FCD in some brain regions and CEN But we could not conclude this is the neuroimaging mechanism of rTMS according to the correlation analysis
