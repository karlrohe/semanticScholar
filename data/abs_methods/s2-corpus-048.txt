 2972755059,BACKGROUND,Blood pressure is a physiologic measure that reflects cardiac output and systemic vascular resistance Classification by these components could be useful in characterizing subtypes of hypertension which may have a role in selecting treatment strategies However hemodynamic phenotypes of a large stable outpatient population with hypertension remain unknown  
 2972755059,METHODS,We included 34 238 people with systolic blood pressure of 130mmHg who underwent impedance cardiography at 51 sites of iKang Health Checkup Centers throughout China between 2012 and 2018 Hemodynamic parameters measured included stroke volume stroke volume index heart rate cardiac output cardiac index systemic vascular resistance and systemic vascular resistance index We characterized these by systolic blood pressure categories and assessed patient characteristics associated with the ratio of cardiac index to systemic vascular resistance index  
 2972755059,RESULTS,Among the study cohort n 33 414 mean age 52 13years 36 6 female 49 40 and 11 had systolic blood pressure130 139 140 159 and 160mmHg respectively Among patients with systolic blood pressure 140 159mmHg 9353 70 had high systemic vascular resistance index but normal low cardiac index 1949 15 had high cardiac index but low normal systemic vascular resistance index and 2053 15 had low normal cardiac index and systemic vascular resistance index Using multivariable analysis we found that cardiac index to systemic vascular resistance index ratio was negatively associated with age and body mass index all P 0 05 R square 0 16 0 12 and 0 09 for systolic blood pressure 130 139 140 159 and 160mmHg respectively  
 2972755059,CONCLUSIONS,Different hemodynamic blood pressure phenotypes were identified across all hypertensive blood pressure categories While individual characteristics were associated with the cardiac index to systemic vascular resistance index ratio they only weakly explained the variation
