 2809768081,BACKGROUND,Many mobile health mHealth interventions have the potential to generate and store vast amounts of system generated participant interaction data that could provide insight into user engagement programmatic strengths and areas that need improvement to maximize efficacy However despite the popularity of mHealth interventions there is little documentation on how to use these data to monitor and improve programming or to evaluate impact  
 2809768081,OBJECTIVE,This study aimed to better understand how users of the Mobile for Reproductive Health m4RH mHealth intervention engaged with the program in Tanzania from September 2013 to August 2016  
 2809768081,METHODS,We conducted secondary data analysis of longitudinal data captured by system logs of participant interactions with the m4RH program from 127 districts in Tanzania from September 2013 to August 2016 Data cleaning and analysis was conducted using Stata 13 The data were examined for completeness and correctness No missing data was imputed respondents with missing or incorrect values were dropped from the analyses  
 2809768081,RESULTS,The total population for analysis included 3 673 702 queries among 409 768 unique visitors New users represented roughly 11 15 409 768 3 673 702 of all queries Among all system queries for new users 46 10 188 904 409 768 users accessed the m4RH main menu Among these users 89 58 169 218 188 904 accessed specific m4RH content on family planning contraceptive methods adolescent specific and youth specific information and clinic locations after first accessing the m4RH main menu The majority of these users 216 422 409 768 52 82 requested information on contraceptive methods fewer users 23 236 409 768 5 67 requested information on clinic location The conversion rate was highest during the first and second years of the program when nearly all users 11 246 11 470 98 05 and 33 551 34 830 96 33 respectively who accessed m4RH continued on to query more specific content from the system The rate of users that accessed m4RH and became active users declined slightly from 98 05 11 246 11 470 in 2013 to 87 54 56 696 64 765 in 2016 Overall slightly more than one third of all new users accessing m4RH sent queries at least once per month for 2 or more months and 67 86 278 088 409 768 of new and returning users requested information multiple times per month Promotional periods were present for 15 of 36 months during the study period  
 2809768081,CONCLUSIONS,The analysis of the rich data captured provides a useful framework with which to measure the degree and nature of user engagement utilizing routine system generated data It also contributes to knowledge of how users engage with text messaging short message service based health promotion interventions and demonstrates how data generated on user interactions could inform improvements to the design and delivery of a service thereby enhancing its effectiveness

 1965964673,BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE,Quinol peroxidase QPO catalyzes peroxidase activity using quinol in the respiratory chain as a substrate Quinol peroxidase is essential for the secretion of leukotoxin LtxA which destroys leukocytes and erythrocytes in humans and is one of the major virulence factors of Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans which is associated with localized aggressive periodontitis In the present study we aimed to find a highly potent QPO inhibitor to attenuate the virulence of A actinomycetemcomitans  
 1965964673,MATERIAL AND METHODS,For screening of QPO inhibitors QPO activity was measured kinetically by SpectraMax Plus with 96 well UV plates Three hundred compounds in the Kitasato Institute for Life Sciences Chemical Library were screened Secretion of LtxA in the culture supernatant was examined by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis Cytotoxicity against human promyelocytic leukemia cell line HL 60 cells from the culture supernatant was measured by Trypan Blue exclusion test  
 1965964673,RESULTS,The present study characterized ascofuranone as a highly potent inhibitor of QPO K i 9 557 0 865 nm Ascofuranone inhibited secretion of LtxA by A actinomycetemcomitans in a dose dependent manner making A actinomycetemcomitans less pathogenic to HL 60 cells  

 2110548056,METHODS,A retrospective review of 6 667 infants aged less than one year attending Accident and Emergency at two district general hospitals in London from 1 st April 2009 to 30 th March 2010 All infants had been assigned to a diagnostic category by the medical coding department according to National Health Service NHS data guidelines based on the clinical diagnoses stated in the medical records The Accident and Emergency case notes of a random subsample of 10 of infants in each of the top five recorded diagnostic categories n 535 were reviewed in detail and audited against the standard national NHS data set  
 2110548056,RESULTS,The top 5 clinical diagnoses were infectious diseases gastrointestinal respiratory unclassifiable and no abnormality detected NAD A third of infants were originally given a diagnosis of unclassifiable 21 5 or NAD 11 5 After detailed case note review we were able to reduce this to 9 7 95 confidence interval CI 9 0 10 4 and 8 8 95 CI 8 1 9 5 respectively

 2108732333,BACKGROUND,Recent preclinical evidence and data from adult subjects suggests that statins could improve the proinflammatory profile of hypercholesterolemic subjects  
 2108732333,OBJECTIVES,We aim to compare the serum levels of a set of proinflammatory chemokines in elderly statistical twins taking or not taking statins  
 2108732333,MATERIAL AND METHODS,Among the historical cohort of the Brisighella Heart Study we chose 40 healthy elderly subjects continuously treated with statins for at least 1 year and 40 cross matched subjects not treated with statins M F   1 1 characterized by similar age body mass index BMI leisure time and working activity smoking habits history of cardiovascular disease systolic and diastolic blood pressure fasting plasma glucose plasma lipids uric acid and creatinine  
 2108732333,RESULTS,The proinflammatory chemokine serum level is similar in statin untreated and treated statistical twins The OR to have a serum level of monocyte chemoattractant protein MCP 1 lower than the 50th percentile of the distribution in statin treated subjects compared to the statin untreated subjects is 0 669 95 CI 0 193 2 327 the OR for interleukin 8 IL 8    0 818 95 CI 0 236 2 835 the OR for γ interferon inducible protein 10 IP 10    1 361 95 CI 0 358 5 175 and for interleukin 18 IL 18    0 545 95 CI 0 155 1 914  
 2108732333,CONCLUSIONS,In relatively healthy elderly subjects selected from a randomized general population sample we did not observe differences in the serum levels of the selected set of proinflammatory chemokines in statin treated and untreated subjects with similar LDL C level suggesting that cholesterol reduction per se could be a main determinant of statin anti inflammatory effects

 2537958726,METHODS,The neuromuscular block was monitored with acceleromyography using train of four TOF stimuli Patients received additional doses of rocuronium to maintain a deep block during surgery If profound neuromuscular block TOF 0 persisted at the end of the surgery 3mg kg sugammadex was administered  
 2537958726,MAIN RESULTS,Twenty six infants who had a deep neuromuscular block TOF 0 at the end of surgery received 3 mg kg sugammadex The mean recovery time of the T4 T1 ratio of 0 9 was 112 seconds No clinical evidence of recurarization or residual curarization was observed  
 2537958726,CONCLUSIONS,The efficacy and safety of sugammadex were confirmed in infant surgical patients for reversal of deep neuromuscular block induced by rocuronium
