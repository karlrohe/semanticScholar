 2153243877,BACKGROUND,Several placental microRNAs miRNAs have been identified as pregnancy associated molecules with the potential for use in estimating the condition of the placenta Our understanding of these novel molecules is still limited however The aim of this study was to isolate and characterize pregnancy associated miRNAs in maternal plasma  
 2153243877,METHODS,By microarray based screening of 723 human miRNAs we selected miRNAs that exhibited signal intensities 100 times higher in placental tissues than in the corresponding whole blood samples Subsequent quantitative real time reverse transcription PCR revealed miRNAs produced predominantly in the placenta that showed significantly decreased concentrations in maternal plasma after delivery These miRNAs were identified as pregnancy associated miRNAs  
 2153243877,RESULTS,We selected 82 miRNAs produced predominantly in the placenta and identified 24 as pregnancy associated miRNAs The genes encoding these miRNAs included 16 that are clustered on 19q13 42 and 5 clustered on 14q32 As the pregnancy progressed into the third trimester the plasma concentrations of cell free chromosome 19 derived miRNAs has miR 515 3p has miR 517a has miR 517c has miR 518b and has miR 526b increased significantly P 0 0284 0 0069 0 0125 0 0284 and 0 0093 respectively Wilcoxon signed rank test whereas that of cell free has miR 323 3p on chromosome 14q32 31 showed no change P 0 2026  
 2153243877,CONCLUSIONS,In addition to the known pregnancy associated miRNAs we identified new pregnancy associated miRNAs with our microarray based approach Most of the genes encoding these miRNAs were clustered on 19q13 42 or 14q32 which are critical regions for placental and embryonic development These new pregnancy associated miRNAs may be useful molecular markers for monitoring pregnancy associated diseases

 2122095366,BACKGROUND,Women with hormone responsive metastatic breast cancer MBC may respond to or have stable disease with a number of hormone therapies We explored the efficacy and safety of the steroidal aromatase inactivator exemestane as first line hormonal therapy in MBC in postmenopausal women  
 2122095366,PATIENTS AND METHODS,Patients with measurable disease were eligible if they had received no prior hormone therapy for metastatic disease and had hormone receptor positive disease or hormone receptor unknown disease with a long disease free interval from adjuvant therapy They were randomized to tamoxifen 20 mg day or exemestane 25 mg day in this open label study  
 2122095366,RESULTS,Blinded independently reviewed response rates for exemestane and tamoxifen were 41 and 17 respectively Fifty seven per cent of exemestane and 42 of tamoxifen treated patients experienced clinical benefit defined as complete or partial response or disease stabilization lasting at least 6 months There was a low incidence of severe flushing sweating nausea and edema in women who received exemestane One exemestane treated patient had a pulmonary embolism with grade 4 dyspnea  
 2122095366,CONCLUSIONS,Exemestane is well tolerated and active in the first line treatment of hormone responsive MBC An ongoing EORTC phase III trial is comparing the efficacy measuring time to disease progression of exemestane and tamoxifen  

 2155240407,BACKGROUND,E75 nelipepimut S is a human leukocyte antigen HLA A2 A3 restricted immunogenic peptide derived from the HER2 protein We have conducted phase I II clinical trials vaccinating breast cancer patients with nelipepimut S and granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor GM CSF in the adjuvant setting to prevent disease recurrence All patients have completed 60 months follow up and here we report the final analyses  
 2155240407,PATIENTS AND METHODS,The studies were conducted as dose escalation schedule optimization trials enrolling node positive and high risk node negative patients with tumors expressing any degree of HER2 immunohistochemistry 1 3 HLA A2 3 patients were vaccinated others were followed prospectively as controls Local and systemic toxicity was monitored Clinical recurrences were documented and disease free survival DFS was analyzed by Kaplan Meier curves groups were compared using log rank tests  
 2155240407,RESULTS,Of 195 enrolled patients 187 were assessable 108 57 8 in the vaccinated group VG and 79 42 2 in the control group CG The groups were well matched for clinicopathologic characteristics Toxicities were minimal Five year DFS was 89 7 in the VG versus 80 2 in the CG P 0 08 Due to trial design 65 of patients received less than the optimal vaccine dose Five year DFS was 94 6 in optimally dosed patients P 0 05 versus the CG and 87 1 in suboptimally dosed patients A voluntary booster program was initiated and among the 21 patients that were optimally boosted there was only one recurrence DFS 95 2  

 2061933374,RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES,The authors developed an analytic software package for the objective and reproducible assessment of a single leg separation SLS in the outlet strut of Bj√∂rk Shiley convexoconcave BSCC prosthetic heart valves  
 2061933374,METHODS,The radiographic cinefilm recordings of 18 phantom valves 12 intact and 6 SLS and of 43 patient valves were acquired After digitization of regions of interest in a cineframe several processing steps were carried out to obtain a one dimensional corrected and averaged density profile along the central axis of each strut leg To characterize the degree of possible separation two quantitative measures were introduced the normalized pit depth NPD and the depth sigma ratio DSR The group of 43 patient studies was divided into a learning set 25 patients and a test set 18 patients  
 2061933374,RESULTS,All phantom valves with an SLS were detected sensitivity 100 at a specificity of 100 The threshold values for the NPD and the DSR to decide whether a fracture was present or not were 3 6 and 2 5 respectively On the basis of the visual interpretations of the 25 patient studies learning set by an expert panel it was concluded that none of the patients had an SLS To achieve a 100 specificity by quantitative analysis the threshold values for the NPD and the DSR were set at 5 8 and 2 5 respectively for the patient data Based on these threshold values the analysis of patient data from the test set resulted in one false negative detection and three false positive detections  
 2061933374,CONCLUSIONS,An analytic software package for the detection of an SLS was developed Phantom data showed excellent sensitivity 100 and specificity 100 Further research and software development is needed to increase the sensitivity and specificity for patient data
