 2800787601,BACKGROUND,Peritoneal recurrence of pancreatic cancer is a frequent and lethal outcome after R0 resection A method to predict peritoneal recurrence could be helpful in its prevention  
 2800787601,MATERIALS AND METHODS,Peritoneal washings were prospectively obtained from 29 patients in whom R0 resection was performed Cytological examination CY and real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction RT PCR of the peritoneal washing for the detection of cancer related genes CEACAM5 KRT7 KRAS and MUC1 were performed Clinicopathological characteristics and real time RT PCR results of the peritoneal washing were compared between patients whose pancreatic cancer recurred peritoneally n   7 and those patients who it did not recur n   22  
 2800787601,RESULTS,Only one CY positive CY case was detected and that patient recurred MUC1 mRNA expression was significantly higher in the recurrence group P   0 015 Cumulative incidence function analysis demonstrated that peritoneal recurrence rate was significantly higher in MUC1 positive MUC1 patients P   0 044 MUC1 patients had significantly decreased disease free survival P   0 009 and disease specific survival P   0 031 MUC1 protein was detected in the primary tumor in 18 of 29 patients However no significant difference was observed in the expression of MUC1 protein in peritoneal washings from the primary tumor P   0 579  
 2800787601,CONCLUSIONS,High expression of MUC1 mRNA in peritoneal washings is a significant risk factor for peritoneal recurrence of pancreatic cancer after R0 resection along with poor disease specific survival RT PCR of MUC1 mRNA in peritoneal washing may be useful for individualization of adjuvant chemotherapy
