 2007793016,BACKGROUND,Endothelial dysfunction and insulin resistance IR are associated with essential hypertension and other cardiovascular risk factors Asymmetric dimethylarginine ADMA an endogenous inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase induces endothelial dysfunction in different setting of patients However at this moment no data are available about the role of ADMA and IR to induce endothelial dysfunction in an independent way or combined between them In this study we investigated in 63 hypertensives and 21 normotensive healthy subjects the relationship between ADMA and IR and their possible interaction on endothelial function  
 2007793016,METHODS,ADMA plasma levels were measured by high performance liquid chromatography and IR by homeostasis model assessment HOMA Endothelial function was estimated by intra arterial infusion of acetylcholine ACh and sodium nitroprusside at increasing doses  
 2007793016,RESULTS,Hypertensive patients had significantly higher ADMA insulin HOMA and C reactive protein CRP values than normotensive controls P 0 0001 There were no significant differences in mean l arginine ADMA ratio between groups ACh stimulated forearm blood flow FBF was significantly reduced in hypertensive patients P 0 0001 In hypertensive group HOMA was the strongest determinant of FBF accounting for the 45 5 of its variation ADMA and gender were the independent determinants of HOMA accounting for 12 3 and 8 3 of its variation respectively  
 2007793016,CONCLUSIONS,The association between ADMA and IR contributes to identify a possible novel mechanism by which ADMA promotes vascular damage increasing individual cardiovascular risk in hypertensive patients However this hypothesis should be tested in a larger study group

 2996046403,OBJECTIVE,We aim to elucidate which metabolites are released from the working muscles and taken up by the liver in exercising humans and their potential influence on hepatic function  
 2996046403,METHODS,In two separate studies young healthy males fasted overnight and performed an acute bout of exercise Arterial to venous differences of metabolites over the hepato splanchnic bed and over the exercising and resting leg were investigated by capillary electrophoresis and liquid chromatography mass spectrometry metabolomics platforms Liver transcriptome data of exercising mice were analyzed by pathway analysis to find a potential overlap between exercise regulated metabolites and activators of hepatic transcription  
 2996046403,RESULTS,During exercise hepatic O2 uptake and CO2 delivery were increased two fold In contrast to all other free fatty acids FFA with 18 carbon atoms and more and a high degree of saturation showed a constant release in the liver vein and only minor changes by exercise FFA 6 0 and 8 0 were released from the working leg and taken up by the hepato splanchnic bed Succinate and malate showed a pronounced hepatic uptake during exercise and were also released from the exercising leg The transcriptional response in the liver of exercising mice indicates the activation of HIF NRF2 and cAMP dependent gene transcription These pathways can also be activated by succinate

 2010546336,OBJECTIVE,To compare tumor growth intraperitoneal implantation and abdominal wall metastasis after laparotomy and CO2 pneumoperitoneum in a rat ovarian cancer model  
 2010546336,METHODS,To mimic intraoperative rupture of an ovarian tumor in a syngenic rat ovarian carcinoma model 10 5 malignant cells were injected intraperitoneally after a 5 cm vertical midline laparotomy or after the insufflation of a CO2 pneumoperitoneum achieved with 4 mmHg or 10 mmHg intra abdominal pressure Two weeks later the intraperitoneal tumor growth and the tumor dissemination were evaluated semiquantitatively with a scoring system The scores attributed to each organ were added to calculate the dissemination score of each animal  
 2010546336,RESULTS,The mean SD dissemination score was 83 4 12 in the laparotomy group and 67 3 16 and 71 9 17 in the 4 and 10 mmHg CO2 pneumoperitoneum groups respectively P 01 The scores for the peritoneum were 21 8 3 8 in the 10 mmHg pneumoperitoneum group and 18 2 4 in the laparotomy group P 01 In the laparotomy group the implant found along the midline scar accounted for a mean of 62 6 15 of the peritoneal score whereas the trocar site metastases did not influence the peritoneal score in the pneumoperitoneum groups The incidence of wound metastasis was 96 in the laparotomy group and 55 and 54 in the 4 mmHg and 10 mmHg pneumoperitoneum groups respectively
