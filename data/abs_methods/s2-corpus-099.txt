 1973745986,OBJECTIVE,Prosthetic valve type selection combined with surgical ablation during left sided heart valve replacement in older individuals with atrial fibrillation remains controversial  
 1973745986,METHODS,A total of 573 patients aged 60 years or older median 65 range 60 84 who underwent left sided valve replacement surgery in the presence of atrial fibrillation from 1990 to 2010 were evaluated for all cause mortality during a median follow up period of 58 0 months interquartile range 33 1 84 1  
 1973745986,RESULTS,Mechanical and bioprosthetic valves were implanted in 356 62 1 and 217 37 9 patients respectively and 203 patients 35 4 underwent surgical ablation concomitantly During the follow up period 166 patients died The 5 and 10 year survival rate was 76 3 2 1 and 58 4 3 2 respectively On Cox regression analysis age P 001 diabetes P 014 left ventricular ejection fraction P 010 left atrial size P 038 the requirement for coronary bypass P 015 and cardiopulmonary bypass time P 001 emerged as significant and independent predictors of death In addition surgical ablation was protective against all cause mortality hazard ratio 0 63 P 033 The improved survival observed with surgical ablation was verified by propensity score adjustment models hazard ratio 0 64 95 confidence interval 0 30 0 99 P 046 The choice of prosthetic type however affected neither survival P 79 nor event free survival P 48  
 1973745986,CONCLUSIONS,Long term survival after valve replacement in older individuals with atrial fibrillation was affected by several preoperative characteristics and the performance of surgical ablation but not by the choice of prosthesis These findings suggest that surgical atrial fibrillation ablation should always be considered for these patients regardless of the prosthesis type used
