 2046460279,METHODS,A total of 580 consecutively referred adult patients with a history of non serious cutaneous allergic reactions to penicillin but with no IgE were challenged with therapeutic doses of penicillin V phenoxymethylpenicillin penicillin G benzylpenicillin or both  
 2046460279,RESULTS,Only 14 of 580 patients had a positive challenge test In 11 of the 14 a reaction to challenge occurred within 2 hours and none were anaphylactic The year of the original reaction was known for 555 patients a positive challenge was seen in only 0 4 of those with an original reaction 15 years before challenge but in 4 6 of those with a more recent original reaction P 0 001 Onset of a reaction within the first day of the original exposure was a predictive factor for a positive challenge P 0 001 in patients challenged within 15 years of the original reaction  
 2046460279,CONCLUSIONS,Among suspected penicillin allergic patients with non severe skin reactions and no detectable specific IgE the subgroup of patients who originally reacted more than 15 years previously had very low risk for reacting to a challenge The risk was higher in patients with a more recent original reaction especially if the symptoms had occurred within the first day of exposure

 2078241682,OBJECTIVE,Randomized treatment comparing an intensive glycemic treatment strategy with a standard strategy in the Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes ACCORD trial was ended early because of an unexpected excess of mortality in the intensive arm As part of ongoing post hoc analyses of potential mechanisms for this finding we explored whether on treatment A1C itself had an independent relationship with mortality  
 2078241682,RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS,Participants with type 2 diabetes n 10 251 with mean age 62 years median duration of diabetes 10 years and median A1C 8 1 were randomly assigned to treatment strategies targeting either A1C 6 0 intensive or A1C 7 0 7 9 standard Data obtained during 3 4 median years of follow up before cessation of intensive treatment were analyzed using several multivariable models  
 2078241682,RESULTS,Various characteristics of the participants and the study sites at baseline had significant associations with the risk of mortality Before and after adjustment for these covariates a higher average on treatment A1C was a stronger predictor of mortality than the A1C for the last interval of follow up or the decrease of A1C in the first year Higher average A1C was associated with greater risk of death The risk of death with the intensive strategy increased approximately linearly from 6 9 A1C and appeared to be greater with the intensive than with the standard strategy only when average A1C was 7  
 2078241682,CONCLUSIONS,These analyses implicate factors associated with persisting higher A1C levels rather than low A1C per se as likely contributors to the increased mortality risk associated with the intensive glycemic treatment strategy in ACCORD  

 2764137622,OBJECTIVE,To examine whether labor compared with planned cesarean delivery is associated with increased maternal and neonatal morbidity  
 2764137622,METHODS,We conducted a retrospective cohort study of all women with body mass indexes BMIs at delivery of 50 or greater delivering a live fetus at 34 weeks of gestation of greater between January 1 2008 and December 31 2015 Pregnancies with multiple gestations and major fetal anomalies were excluded The primary outcome was a composite of maternal and neonatal morbidity and was estimated to be 50 in superobese women based on institutional data A sample size of 338 women determined the study period and was selected to show a 30 difference in the incidence of the primary outcome between the two groups Multivariate logistic regression adjusted for potential confounders  
 2764137622,RESULTS,There were 344 women with BMIs of 50 or greater who met eligibility criteria of whom 201 58 labored and 143 42 underwent planned cesarean delivery Women who labored were younger more likely to be nulliparous and less likely to have pre existing diabetes Among women who labored 45 underwent a cesarean delivery most commonly for labor arrest 61 or nonreassuring fetal status 28 Composite maternal and neonatal morbidity was reduced among women who labored even after adjusting for age parity pre existing diabetes and prior cesarean delivery adjusted odds ratio 0 42 95 CI 0 24 0 75 In the subgroup of women n 234 who underwent a cesarean delivery whether planned n 143 or after labor n 91 there were no differences in maternal and neonatal morbidity except that severe maternal morbidity was increased in women n 12 who labored 8 8 compared with 2 1 relative risk 4 2 95 CI 1 14 15 4

 2903760655,BACKGROUND,Management of chronic cluster headache CCH remains a challenging endeavor and the optimal surgical approach for medically refractory CCH remains controversial  
 2903760655,OBJECTIVE,To conduct a preliminary evaluation of the efficacy and safety of vidian neurectomy VN in patients with medically refractory CCH  
 2903760655,METHODS,Between March 2013 and December 2015 9 CCH patients all of whom had failed to respond to conservative therapy underwent VN with a precise nerve cut and maximal preservation of the sphenopalatine ganglion Data included demographic variables cluster headache onset and duration mean attack frequency mean attack intensity and pain disability index measures pre and through 12 mo postsurgery  
 2903760655,RESULTS,Seven of the 9 cases 77 8 showed immediate improvement Improvement was delayed by 1 mo in 1 patient after which the surgical effects of pain relief were maintained throughout the follow up period One patient 11 1 did not improve after surgery One year after VN patients mean attack frequency mean attack intensity and pain disability index decreased by 54 5 52 9 and 56 4 respectively No patient experienced treatment related side effects or complications

 2043841012,BACKGROUND,Family history of diabetes is regarded as a risk factor for gestational glucose intolerance Most selective screening policy includes family history as an indication of oral glucose tolerance test However few studies had evaluated the actual incidence of glucose intolerance in this group of women  
 2043841012,METHODS,Pregnant women with oral glucose tolerance test performed for family history of diabetes over two consecutive years were identified Receiver operating curve was used to identify the age cut off that give the highest sensitivity and specificity The incidence of glucose intolerance was compared between women with age above and below this cut off  
 2043841012,RESULTS,One hundred and eighty seven women were identified The age cut off selected was 30 5 years In young women age or 30 years with family history alone the incidence of glucose intolerance is similar to that in the low risk pregnant population 12 5 and 6 3 for 8 0 mmol L and 9 0 mmol L cut off for two hour value of 75 g oral glucose tolerance test respectively In women aged above 30 years the incidence of glucose intolerance raised by three fold 35 2 and 22 0 for 8 0 mmol L and 9 0 mmol L cut off respectively  
 2043841012,CONCLUSIONS,The risk of glucose intolerance in young women with positive family history is similar to that in the background pregnant population Standard oral glucose tolerance test may not be necessary in this group of women if selective screening policy is adopted
