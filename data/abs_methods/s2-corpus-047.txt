 2613827138,BACKGROUND,Good communication around cancer treatment is essential in helping patients cope with their disease and related care especially when this information is tailored to one s needs Despite its importance communication is often complex in particular in older patients aged 65 years or older In addition to the age related deterioration in information and memory processing older patients experience communication is also complicated by their required yet often unmet role of being an active participatory patient Older patients rarely express their informational needs and their contributions to consultations are often limited Therefore older patients with cancer need to be prepared to participate more actively in their care and treatment  
 2613827138,OBJECTIVE,The objective of this paper was to report the development of PatientVOICE an online preparatory tool with audio facility aimed to enhance the participation of older patients during educational nursing encounters preceding chemotherapy and to improve their information recall  
 2613827138,METHODS,PatientVOICE was developed by applying the following 6 steps of the intervention mapping framework that involved both patients and nurses 1 needs assessment 2 specifying determinants and change objectives 3 reviewing and selecting theoretical methods and practical strategies 4 developing intervention components 5 designing adoption and implementation and 6 making an evaluation plan  
 2613827138,RESULTS,A careful execution of these consecutive steps resulted in the ready to use preparatory website PatientVOICE provides pre visit information about chemotherapy ie medical information side effects and recommendations of dealing with side effects information about the educational nursing visit preceding chemotherapy ie aim structure and recommendations for preparation techniques to improve patients communication skills using a question prompt sheet QPS and video modeling examples showing best practices and the opportunity to upload and listen back to an audio recording of a patient s own nursing visit  
 2613827138,CONCLUSIONS,The development process resulted in PatientVOICE a multi component online intervention targeted to older patients with cancer PatientVOICE contains information about the treatment as well as information about the role of the patient during treatment Using different methods QPS and audio facility we hope to support these patients during their treatment In the future the utility and usability of this complex intervention will be evaluated in a group of older patients who receive or have received chemotherapy

 2470782515,STUDY OBJECTIVES,Dysfunctional beliefs and attitudes about sleep is a cognitive behavioral factor central to the development and perpetuation of insomnia Previous works to unravel the complex interrelationship between pain and insomnia have not explored the role of inflexible beliefs about the sleep pain interaction possibly due to a lack of a valid instrument for doing so The current study evaluated the psychometric and functional properties of a 10 item Pain Related Beliefs and Attitudes about Sleep PBAS scale  
 2470782515,METHODS,The PBAS scale was administered to four clinical samples of chronic pain patients with comorbid insomnia to examine the scale s psychometric properties n 137 test retest reliability n 26 sensitivity to treatment n 20 and generalizability n 62 All participants completed the PBAS together with validated measures of pain interference insomnia severity and cognitive behavioral processes hypothesized to underpin insomnia  
 2470782515,RESULTS,The PBAS scale was found to be reliable with adequate internal consistency and temporal stability Factor analysis suggested a 2 factor solution representing beliefs about pain as the primary cause of insomnia and the inevitable consequences of insomnia on pain and coping The PBAS total score was positively correlated with scores from the Insomnia Severity Index ISI scale Dysfunctional Beliefs and Attitudes about Sleep DBAS scale and the Anxiety and Preoccupation about Sleep Questionnaire APSQ It was a significant predictor of insomnia severity and pain interference A significant reduction in PBAS was also observed in patients after receiving a hybrid cognitive behavioral intervention for both pain and insomnia  
 2470782515,CONCLUSIONS,Pain related sleep beliefs appear to be an integral part of chronic pain patients insomnia experience The PBAS is a valid and reliable instrument for evaluating the role of these beliefs in chronic pain patients

 3015567270,BACKGROUND,Initial propranolol recommendations for infantile hemangioma published in 2013 were intended as provisional best practices to be updated as evidence based data emerged  
 3015567270,METHODS,A retrospective multicenter study was performed to evaluate utility of prolonged monitoring after first propranolol dose and escalation s Inclusion criteria included diagnosis of hemangioma requiring propranolol of 0 3 mg kg dose age 2 years and heart rate HR monitoring for 1 hour Data collected included demographics dose vital signs and adverse events  
 3015567270,RESULTS,783 subjects met inclusion criteria median age at initiation was 112 days None of the 1148 episodes of prolonged monitoring warranted immediate intervention or drug discontinuation No symptomatic bradycardia or hypotension occurred during monitoring Mean HR change from baseline to 1 hour was 8 19 15 54 and baseline to 2 hours was 9 24 15 84 bpm Three preterm subjects had dose adjustments due to prescriber concerns about asymptomatic vital sign changes No significant difference existed in pre treatment HR or in HR change between those with later adverse events during treatment and those without

 2921854955,OBJECTIVE,To report clinical signs and management of hypospadias in a horse  
 2921854955,METHODS,Partial phallectomy was performed to resolve contact dermatitis of the pelvic limbs and abnormal behavior during urination Subsequent urethral meatal stenosis was treated by revision  
 2921854955,RESULTS,Hypospadias and chordee caused altered direction of urine flow contact dermatitis of the pelvic limbs and abnormal behavior Partial phallectomy and subsequent revision after meatal stenosis resolved urine direction flow and abnormal behavior  
 2921854955,CONCLUSIONS,Abnormalities of the urinary tract associated with hypospadias can result in urine induced contact dermatitis and distress during urination but these complications can be resolved by partial phallectomy
