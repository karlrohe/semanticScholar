 2124638169,BACKGROUND,For most febrile respiratory tract infections RTIs in children the causative pathogen is never identified We sought to identify the causative pathogen in individual cases of pediatric outpatient with RTIs and to determine whether particular clinical features of RTIs are associated with particular viruses  
 2124638169,METHODS,Over 3 years we prospectively collected nasopharyngeal aspirate specimens from individual pediatric outpatients with an RTI accompanied by persistent fever 3 days 38 0 C and peak temperature 39 0 C Two methods 1 viral culture for respiratory viruses and 2 real time polymerase chain reaction PCR assays identifying 9 different respiratory viruses and 2 respiratory bacteria were used to test specimens  
 2124638169,RESULTS,For 495 specimens viral culture and real time PCR assays together identified at least 1 pathogen in 83 0 and 1 viruses alone in 79 4 These 2 methods identified 138 children with respiratory syncytial virus 66 with human metapneumovirus 73 with parainfluenza viruses 124 with adenovirus 23 with rhinovirus 38 with enterovirus 11 with influenza type C virus 15 with Mycoplasma pneumoniae and 3 with Chlamydophila pneumoniae the coinfection rate was 19 7 among all infections Among the patients with single pathogen infections the rate of lower RTI was 37 6 for respiratory syncytial virus 40 7 for human metapneumovirus 18 2 for parainfluenza viruses and 2 2 for adenovirus P 0 01  
 2124638169,CONCLUSIONS,Viral culture and real time PCR assays were used together to identify causative pathogens in 83 of febrile outpatient children with RTI specific viruses were associated with particular clinical diagnoses

 1840028438,OBJECTIVES,To measure the flexion extension range of motion FE ROM of the thoracolumbar spine and pelvic vertical displacement during water treadmill walking at 3 water depths and compare these with the control condition  
 1840028438,METHODS,A total of 14 horses walked at 0 8 m s on a water treadmill for 3 min at each of the following depths hoof control metatarsophalangeal joint low tarsal joint medium and femoropatellar joint high Skin surface markers on T6 T10 T13 T18 L3 L5 and S3 were used to obtain FE ROM and the minimum and maximum angular motion pattern values AMPmin and AMPmax for T10 T13 T18 L3 and L5 Markers placed on left and right tuber coxae were used to obtain pelvic vertical displacement Friedman s tests and post hoc Wilcoxon s signed ranks tests were used to determine the effects of water depth on measured variables  
 1840028438,RESULTS,The FE ROM of T10 8 4 T13 8 1 T18 6 9 and L3 6 4 when walking at high depth was significantly greater than control 5 5 5 7 5 1 and 5 1 respectively P 0 008 T13 AMPmin was significantly lower in high water 3 0 than control 0 1 P 0 001 and L3 AMPmax significantly greater in high water 1 9 than control 4 8 P 0 001 There was no significant association between pelvic vertical displacement and water depth  
 1840028438,CONCLUSIONS,Walking in high water causes cranial thoracic extension and thoracolumbar flexion when compared with walking in water at hoof depth This postural change should be considered when designing rehabilitation programmes for horses with back and or hindlimb pathology
