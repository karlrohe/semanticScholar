 1997317280,METHODS,Three patients with corneoscleral cysts underwent peripheral lamellar keratoplasty Two patients had no history of trauma or ocular surgery and were considered to have congenital cysts The other patient had a history of strabismus surgery that had been performed 7 years previously The anterior wall of the cysts was removed by trephination and the epithelial membrane lining the posterior wall was peeled off Lamellar corneal buttons obtained from preserved corneas then were put in place and secured with 8 10 interrupted sutures In one case because the cyst was large and extended to the pupillary axis peripheral LKP was performed for removal of the scleral and peripheral corneal cyst and the inner wall of the central corneal cyst was removed with vigorous irrigation and a spatula  
 1997317280,RESULTS,Histologic examination showed that all of the cysts were lined with nonkeratinizing epithelial cells In all three cases cysts have not reformed after a 1 5 year follow up  
 1997317280,CONCLUSIONS,The cysts were lined in epithelial cells and removal of these epithelial cells was considered to be important for the prevention of recurrence Peripheral LKP is effective for the treatment of corneoscleral cysts since this procedure removes displaced epithelial cells and reconstructs the thin part of the cornea and sclera

 2404505201,OBJECTIVE,To evaluate the efficacy and clinical value of the strategy of posterior simultaneous correction by bilateral corrective rod on the convex and concave sides in the treatment of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis AIS  
 2404505201,METHODS,From February 2006 to August 2008 posterior fusion was performed to 48 AIS patients There were 16 males and 32 females with an average age at the time of surgery of 17 1 years Lenke Type I was found in 17 cases Type II in 9 Type III in 14 and Type IV in 8 There were 27 patients used selective posterior fusion in thoracic 21 cases without selective fusion Observation index the Cobb angle on coronal plane translation and rotation of apical vertebrae the coronal balance the Cobb angle on sagittal plane obliquity between lowest instrumented vertebrae LIV and the pelvis intervertebral angle and rotation of the LIV The patients were followed up at an average time of 15 1 months 12 27 months  
 2404505201,RESULTS,In the 27 cases with selective fusion thoracic coronal Cobb angle was 17 or 8 degrees after the operation with an average correction rate of 76 or 11 at final follow up The lumbar Cobb angle was 13 or 7 degrees after the operation with an average correction rate of 72 or 9 at final follow up In the 21 cases without selective fusion the thoracic Cobb angle was 20 or 7 degrees after the operation with an average correction rate of 74 or 15 at final follow up The lumbar Cobb angle was 16 or 8 degrees after the operation with an average correction rate of 69 or 9 at final follow up The average number of vertebrae retained below LIV was 4 4 There was 1 case developing thoracolumbar kyphosis During the follow up there were no major complication of neurological injury no pseudarthrosis and no spine decompensation
