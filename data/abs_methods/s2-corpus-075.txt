 2556755158,BACKGROUND,The Transplant Evaluation Rating Scale TERS was developed to provide a standardized evaluation of the psychosocial functioning of patients before transplantation Yet the first 2 items of the TERS are based on psychiatric diagnoses referring to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual DSM III R which leads to a duplication of disorder specific and symptom specific contents that makes it complex to rate Moreover the TERS has not been updated to DSM revisions and DSM is not used for the official clinical routine documentation in several European countries  
 2556755158,OBJECTIVE,The objective of this study was therefore to investigate the psychometric properties of a diagnoses corrected version of the TERS items 1 and 2 omitted  
 2556755158,METHODS,In 85 patients awaiting liver transplantation the discrimination capacities predictive value convergent validity and interrater reliability of the original version TERS10 and the diagnoses corrected version TERS8 were analyzed  
 2556755158,RESULTS,In both versions patients with psychiatric diagnoses 69 4 exhibited significantly higher TERS mean values than patients without psychiatric disorders This also held for patients who were temporarily not found eligible for transplantation in the psychosocial evaluation 25 9 compared with patients who were eligible for listing for transplantation Furthermore the area under the curve was 0 90 for both versions and a cutoff of 32 25 is suggested for TERS8 sensitivity of 90 9 and specificity of 87 3  
 2556755158,CONCLUSIONS,Our results substantiate good psychometric properties of the revised diagnoses corrected TERS which is of great benefit for standardized psychosocial evaluation before liver transplantation Further validation of TERS8 and its cutoff in other samples of liver transplantation patients is needed
