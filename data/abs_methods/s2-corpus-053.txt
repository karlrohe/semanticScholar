 2110093326,BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES,Basal cell layer of the oral epithelium has been rightfully regarded as a potential source of odontogenic tumours and cysts but without substantial evidence Also whether the basal cell layer retains within it some properties of ectomesenchyme which was imbibed during the early embryogenesis and hence its neuroectodermal relation is not known Here an attempt is made to establish the hidden neuroectodermal potential of the oral epithelium especially the basal layer by observing the expression of known neuroectodermal markers NSE Neuron Specific Enolase Synaptophysin and CD99 The expression of the same markers has also been studied in Ameloblastoma connecting it with oral epithelium in turn establishing basal cell layer as a potential source of Ameloblastoma  
 2110093326,MATERIALS AND METHODS,Sections of formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissue samples of 20 cases of Ameloblastoma and 10 cases of Normal Retromolar mucosa were stained immunohistochemically with NSE Synaptophysin CD99 and also with CK 19 and evaluated for positive expression  
 2110093326,RESULTS,Positive reaction was obtained in all the cases of Ameloblastoma and NRM Normal Retromolar mucosa with NSE all the cases of Ameloblastoma and eight cases of NRM with Synaptophysin and in six cases of Ameloblastoma and NRM with CD99 The staining was diffuse and more marked in case of NSE than Synaptophysin and CD99 CK19 staining done to assure that the tissue antigenicity was maintained was positive in all the samples
