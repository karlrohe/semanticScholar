 ,METHODS,The patients were divided into three groups according to their medication Group 1 was treated with beta blocker n 17 group 2 with ACE inhibitors n 10 and group 3 with calcium channel blockers n 11 All patients underwent fluorescein angiographic studies with a scanning laser ophthalmoscope Perifoveal intercapillary areas PIA and the mean perifoveal capillary velocity were quantified from the angiograms  
 ,RESULTS,Compared with reference values all three groups of patients with essential hypertension showed significantly increased PIA and significantly decreased capillary velocity No difference could be detected between the three groups of patients treated with beta blocker ACE inhibitor or calcium channel blocker
