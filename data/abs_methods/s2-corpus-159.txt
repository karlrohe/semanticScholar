 2035769705,MATERIALS AND METHODS,CSF challenge virus maintained at Division of Biological standardization was experimentally infected to two seronegative piglets The biological characterization was done by clinical sign and symptoms along with postmortem findings For molecular characterization 5 nontranslated region E2 and NS5B regions were amplified by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and sequenced The sequences were compared with that of reference strains and the local field isolates to establish a phylogenetic relation  
 2035769705,RESULTS,The virus produced symptoms of acute disease in the piglets with typical post mortem lesions Phylogenetic analysis of the three regions showed that the current Indian CSF Challenge virus is having maximum similarity with the BresciaX strain USA and Madhya Pradesh isolate India and is belonging to subgroup 1 2 under Group 1
