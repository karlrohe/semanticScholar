 2158922303,BACKGROUND,Clinical teachers are sometimes challenged by residents who seem too busy to concentrate on their learning In such situations teachers must be aware to diagnose underlying problems in learners and to effectively help them maximize learning while minimizing time and energy requirements  
 2158922303,OBJECTIVE,To develop a learner centered model to improve efficiency of clinical teaching  
 2158922303,METHODS,We reviewed the literature on educational diagnosis self directed learning and effective efficient teaching to put together a new model  
 2158922303,RESULTS,The Learner Centered Approach to Raise Efficiency L CARE in Clinical Teaching is inspired from the well known patient centered clinical method Using the L CARE in clinical teaching involves 1 addressing the learners feelings regarding their environment as well as patient care and study issues which provides a good learning climate facilitating educational diagnosis and management of issues that could impair learning 2 establishing a learning contract expectations 3 sharing resources and strategies ideas that should be effective without wasting time or energy 4 self assessment and constructive feedback impact These steps are grounded in self directed learning theory to improve motivation and ensure that learners concentrate on their own needs to promote learning efficiency

 2017870005,BACKGROUND,Scavenger receptor class B type I SR BI is a major receptor for high density lipoproteins HDL in the liver Overexpression of SR BI attenuated experimental atherosclerosis in murine models concomitant with a reduction in plasma HDL cholesterol levels Probucol is known to be a potent hypolipidemic drug to regress xanthoma formation and carotid atherosclerosis in conjunction with a marked reduction in HDL cholesterol levels However the mechanism by which probucol affects atherosclerosis is not completely understood and the effect of probucol on the expression of SR BI was controversial The aim of this study was to know the effect of probucol on HDL metabolism and SR BI expression in the liver  
 2017870005,METHODS,Sixteen rabbits fed with high cholesterol diet for 8 weeks were randomly divided into two groups 1 high cholesterol group n 8 maintained high cholesterol diet for 6 weeks 2 probucol group n 8 the same cholesterol diet plus 1 probucol for 6 weeks Control group n 8 was fed with normal diet for 14 weeks The classical in situ two steps perfusion of the liver with collagenase IV was used to isolate the parenchymal hepatocytes The selective uptake of HDL by hepatocytes was performed using the double radiolabelled HDL Immunohistochemistry and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction RT PCR were used to evaluate SR BI expression in the liver  
 2017870005,RESULTS,Compared with control group rabbits fed with high cholesterol diet showed higher levels of serum total cholesterol TC low density lipoprotein LDL cholesterol and HDL C all of which were significantly reduced by probucol treatment The selective uptake of HDL CEs in probucol group 249 68 60 13 ng mg cell protein was about two folds higher as compared with the control group 122 47 54 06 ng mg cell protein P 0 01 and high cholesterol group 104 92 47 91 ng mg cell protein P 0 01 but it could not be reproduced in vitro The expression of SR BI were significantly decreased in the high cholesterol group 0 48 0 06 as compared with control group 0 65 0 06 P 0 01 Probucol increased SR BI expression 0 68 0 06 P 0 01 as compared with high cholesterol group The expression of SR BI was positively associated with the selective CEs uptake r 0 47 P 0 032  
 2017870005,CONCLUSIONS,Probucol up regulates SR BI expression and enhance the uptake of HDL CEs by hepatocytes which may help us to understand the anti atherogenic properties and the HDL C lowering effect of probucol
