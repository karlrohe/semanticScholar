 2329429966,BACKGROUND,Heterogeneity of inhaled particle deposition in airways disease may be a sensitive indicator of physiologic changes in the lungs Using planar gamma scintigraphy we developed new methods to locate and quantify regions of high hot and low cold particle deposition in the lungs  
 2329429966,METHODS,Initial deposition and 24 hour retention images were obtained from healthy n 31 adult subjects and patients with mild cystic fibrosis lung disease CF n 14 following inhalation of radiolabeled particles Tc99m sulfur colloid 5 4 μm MMAD under controlled breathing conditions The initial deposition image of the right lung was normalized to i e same median pixel value and then divided by a transmission Tc99m image in the same individual to obtain a pixel by pixel ratio image Hot spots were defined where pixel values in the deposition image were greater than 2X those of the transmission and cold spots as pixels where the deposition image was less than 0 5X of the transmission The number ratio NR of the hot and cold pixels to total lung pixels and the sum ratio SR of total counts in hot pixels to total lung counts were compared between healthy and CF subjects Other traditional measures of regional particle deposition nC P and skew of the pixel count histogram distribution were also compared  
 2329429966,RESULTS,The NR of cold spots was greater in mild CF 0 221 0 047 CF vs 0 186 0 038 healthy p 0 005 and was significantly correlated with FEV1 pred in the patients R 0 70 nC P central to peripheral count ratio skew of the count histogram and hot NR or SR were not different between the healthy and mild CF patients  
 2329429966,CONCLUSIONS,These methods may provide more sensitive measures of airway function and localization of deposition that might be useful for assessing treatment efficacy in these patients
