 2051381439,METHODS,In this prospective observational study 75 cases involving patients treated surgically for CSDH 67 patients or SH 8 patients were evaluated with respect to clinical and radiological findings at presentation the content of beta trace protein beta TP in the subdural fluid betaTPSF and serum betaTPSER and the CSDH SH recurrence rate The betaTPSF was considered to indicate an admixture of CSF to the subdural fluid if betaTPSF betaTPSER 2  
 2051381439,RESULTS,The median beta TPSF level for the whole patient group was 4 29 mg L range 0 33 51 mg L Cerebrospinal fluid leakage as indicated by betaTPSF betaTPSER 2 was found to be present in 93 of the patients with CSDH and in 100 of the patients with SH p 0 724 In patients who later had to undergo repeated surgery for recurrence of CSDH SH the betaTPSF concentrations median 6 69 mg L range 0 59 51 mg L were significantly higher p 0 04 than in patients not requiring reoperation median 4 12 mg L range 0 33 26 8 mg L  
 2051381439,CONCLUSIONS,As indicated by the presence of betaTP in the subdural fluid CSF leakage into the subdural space is present in the vast majority of patients with CSDH and SH This leakage could be involved in the pathogenesis of CSDH and SH Patients who experience recurrences of CSDH and SH have significantly higher concentrations of betaTPSF at initial presentation than patients not requiring reoperation for recurrence These findings are presented in the literature for the first time and have to be confirmed and expanded upon by further studies
