 2461810775,BACKGROUND,Hypercoagulability is a major source of morbidity and mortality after injury A resuscitation regimen that modulates this coagulopathy may prove beneficial We sought to evaluate the effects of lactated Ringer s LR solution and Hextend on the resuscitation of uncontrolled hemorrhagic shock  
 2461810775,METHODS,Twenty swine underwent invasive line placement midline celiotomy and splenectomy After a 15 minute stabilization period we recorded a baseline mean arterial pressure and created a grade V liver injury The animals bled freely for 30 minutes after which we measured the initial blood loss that after injury We blindly randomized the swine to receive LR solution or Hextend to achieve and maintain the baseline mean arterial pressure for 90 minutes postinjury Laboratory values were obtained at baseline and on completion of the 2 hour study period  
 2461810775,RESULTS,The initial blood loss before resuscitation was 22 mL kg in both treatment groups p 0 97 Animals required 119 78 mL kg of fluid in the LR group and 40 21 mL kg in the Hextend group p 0 01 After resuscitation the secondary blood loss was 3 7 1 7 mL kg in the LR group and 4 7 1 1 mL kg in the Hextend group p 0 1 Thrombelastography revealed a hypercoagulable state in all animals after injury This was less pronounced in those animals resuscitated with Hextend Routine tests of coagulation did not reveal a hypercoagulable state

 2169727006,OBJECTIVE,Although central tears of the triangular fibrocartilage are easily seen on imaging peripheral tears of the ulnar attachment are frequently missed The aim of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of MR arthrography of the distal radioulnar joint in depiction of peripheral tears of the triangular fibrocartilage  
 2169727006,MATERIALS AND METHODS,Forty one patients 18 women 23 men mean age 38 years age range 18 60 years underwent MR arthrography and wrist arthroscopy For MR arthrography iopamidol 300 mg I mL and gadopentetate dimeglumine 4 mmol L were injected into the distal radioulnar joint Consensus review of both MR arthrograms and conventional arthrograms was performed by two experienced musculoskeletal radiologists Presence or absence of communicating and noncommunicating tears of the ulnar attachment of the triangular fibrocartilage was recorded Arthroscopy was used as the standard of reference for determining sensitivity specificity and accuracy in detection of tears of the ulnar attachment  
 2169727006,RESULTS,At MR arthrography communicating tear of the ulnar attachment was diagnosed in three patients noncommunicating tear in 19 patients and normal attachment in 19 patients Arthroscopy revealed peripheral tear of the triangular fibrocartilage in all three patients with communicating tear in 14 of 19 patients with noncommunicating tear and in three of 19 patients with normal attachment The sensitivity was 85 17 20 specificity was 76 16 21 and accuracy was 80 33 41
