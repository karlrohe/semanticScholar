 757415737,OBJECTIVE,To investigate the sonographic features of struma ovarii and its corresponding histopathologic findings  
 757415737,METHODS,The sonographic and histopathological features of 72 patients with histopathologically comfirmed struma ovarii who were treated in Peking Union Medical College Hospital from January 2005 to December 2014 were retrospectively reviewed  
 757415737,RESULTS,Of these 72 patients 71 had benign struma ovarii 73 lesions and one patient had malignant struma ovarii 1 lesion On ultrasonography all the 73 benign lesions had distinct margin 45 61 6 had multilocular cystic or cystic solid mass 49 67 1 had irregular shape and 28 38 4 had nodular solid protrusions in the cystic areas On the color Doppler flow imaging 36 49 3 lesions had blood flow signals The ultrasonographic features of the malignant struma ovarii lesion were multilocular cystic solid mass with several nodular solid protrusions in the cysic areas on the color Doppler flow imaging blood flow signals were visible within septa and solid areas  
 757415737,CONCLUSIONS,The sonographic features of struma ovarii are diverse If ultrasonography reveals multilocular cystic or cystic solid mass with distinct margin and isoechoic or hyperechoic nodular solid protrusions in the cystic areas with visible blood flow signals the diagnosis of struma ovarii should be considered
