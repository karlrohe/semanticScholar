 2170648015,BACKGROUND,Diminished ability to perceive one s own impairments whether cognitive or social is common in dementia in particular frontotemporal dementia FTD where lack of insight is listed as a core diagnostic feature Yet there is no currently accepted method for measuring insight in dementia The most commonly used methods which involve comparing patients opinions of their level of impairment with the opinions of care givers or close family members are subjective and require the participation of a knowledgeable informant Here the authors introduce a new method that allows objective quantification of an individual s awareness of their cognitive abilities and relies upon objective bedside testing  
 2170648015,METHODS,The authors administered several tests of everyday real world functions to patients with FTD n 10 and Alzheimer s disease AD n 10 and to control subjects n 10 Prior to the tasks participants were asked to predict their performance using a percentile based rating system They were also asked to estimate their performance after task completion Differences between their self rated and actual performances were calculated  
 2170648015,RESULTS,Whereas the control group showed very little discrepancy between pretest predictions post task estimates and actual performance mean difference of 3 9 percentile points for prediction 3 0 percentile points for post task estimate both patient groups overpredicted and overestimated their performance with a significantly greater discrepancy for FTD 49 0 54 3 percentile points than AD 27 2 28 3 percentile points
