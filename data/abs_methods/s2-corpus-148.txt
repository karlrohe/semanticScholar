 2044009298,BACKGROUND,Hepatic veno occlusive disease VOD is a severe complication after haematopoietic stem cell transplantation HSCT Different drugs with different mechanisms of action have been tried in HSCT recipients to prevent hepatic VOD However it is uncertain whether high quality evidence exists to support any prophylactic therapy  
 2044009298,OBJECTIVES,We aimed to determine the effects of various prophylactic therapies on the incidence of hepatic VOD overall survival mortality quality of life QOL and the safety of these therapies in people undergoing HSCT  
 2044009298,SEARCH METHODS,We searched the Cochrane Central Registe of Controlled Trials CENTRAL MEDLINE EMBASE conference proceedings of three international haematology oncology societies and two trial registries in January 2015 together with reference checking citation searching and contact with study authors to identify additional studies  
 2044009298,MAIN RESULTS,We included 14 RCTs Four trials 612 participants compared ursodeoxycholic acid with or without additional treatment versus placebo or no treatment or same additional treatment Two trials 259 participants compared heparin with no treatment Two trials 106 participants compared low molecular weight heparin LMWH with placebo or no treatment One trial 360 participants compared defibrotide with no treatment One trial 34 participants compared glutamine with placebo Two trials 383 participants compared fresh frozen plasma FFP with or without additional treatment versus no treatment or same additional treatment One trial 30 participants compared antithrombin III with heparin versus heparin One trial compared heparin 47 participants with LMWH 46 participants and prostaglandin E1 PGE1 47 participants No trial investigated the effects of danaparoid The RCTs included participants of both genders with wide age range and disease spectrum undergoing autologous or allogeneic HSCT Funding was provided by government sources two studies research fund one study pharmaceutical companies that manufactured defibrotide and ursodeoxycholic acid two studies or unclear source nine studies All RCTs had high risk of bias because of lack of blinding of participants and study personnel or other risks of bias mainly differences in baseline characteristics of comparison groups Results showed that ursodeoxycholic acid may reduce the incidence of hepatic VOD risk ratio RR 0 60 95 confidence interval CI 0 40 to 0 88 number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome NNTB 15 95 CI 7 to 50 low quality of evidence but there was no evidence of difference in overall survival hazard ratio HR 0 83 95 CI 0 59 to 1 18 low quality of evidence It may reduce all cause mortality RR 0 70 95 CI 0 50 to 0 99 NNTB 17 95 CI 8 to 431 low quality of evidence and mortality due to hepatic VOD RR 0 27 95 CI 0 09 to 0 87 NNTB 34 95 CI 16 to 220 very low quality of evidence There was no evidence of difference in the incidence of hepatic VOD between treatment and control groups for heparin RR 0 47 95 CI 0 18 to 1 26 very low quality of evidence LMWH RR 0 27 95 CI 0 06 to 1 18 very low quality of evidence defibrotide RR 0 62 95 CI 0 38 to 1 02 low quality of evidence glutamine no hepatic VOD in either group very low quality of evidence FFP RR 0 66 95 CI 0 20 to 2 17 very low quality of evidence antithrombin III RR 0 13 95 CI 0 01 to 2 15 very low quality of evidence between heparin and LMWH RR 1 96 95 CI 0 80 to 4 77 very low quality of evidence between heparin and PGE1 RR 1 20 95 CI 0 58 to 2 50 very low quality of evidence and between LMWH and PGE1 RR 0 61 95 CI 0 24 to 1 55 very low quality of evidence There was no evidence of difference in survival between treatment and control groups for heparin 92 6 vs 88 7 and defibrotide HR 1 04 95 CI 0 54 to 2 02 low quality of evidence There were no data on survival for trials of LMWH glutamine FFP antithrombin III between heparin and LMWH between heparin and PGE1 and between LMWH and PGE1 There were no data on quality of life QoL for any trials Eleven trials reported adverse events There was no evidence of difference in the frequency of adverse events between treatment and control groups except for one trial showing that defibrotide resulted in more adverse events compared with no treatment RR 18 79 95 CI 1 10 to 320 45 These adverse events included coagulopathy gastrointestinal disorders haemorrhage and microangiopathy The quality of evidence was low or very low due to bias of study design and inconsistent and imprecise results  
 2044009298,AUTHORS CONCLUSIONS,There is low or very low quality evidence that ursodeoxycholic acid may reduce the incidence of hepatic VOD all cause mortality and mortality due to VOD in HSCT recipients However the optimal regimen is not well defined There is insufficient evidence to support the use of heparin LMWH defibrotide glutamine FFP antithrombin III and PGE1 Further high quality RCTs are needed  

 2593772583,MATERIAL AND METHODS,This study included 16 patients of different clinical subtypes of psoriasis Interleukin 18 gene expression analysis was performed using real time quantitative PCR Three biopsies were obtained from each patient Two were taken from the lesional psoriatic skin and from uninvolved skin before starting treatment A third lesional skin biopsy was taken at the end of 2 months of treatment The treatment was in the form of topical steroids or oral systemic methotrexate  
 2593772583,RESULTS,Of all 16 studied patients significantly increased IL 18 expression was noted in keratinocytes from psoriatic lesions before and after treatment when compared to keratinocytes from uninvolved skin p 0 001 and p 0 002 respectively The IL 18 expression in the skin lesions after treatment was significantly lower than lesional skin before treatment p 0 023 In psoriatic skin lesions of all studied patients IL 18 expression was significantly correlated with disease duration r 0 40 and p 0 01 and clinical severity of psoriasis r 0 72 and p 0 001  
 2593772583,CONCLUSIONS,Increased IL 18 expression in keratinocytes from psoriatic lesions of our patients and its correlation with disease duration and severity supported the concept of psoriasis as a T cell mediated autoimmune disease This could establish therapeutic and preventive approaches for psoriasis that ultimately lead to improved outcomes for patients  

 2736817296,OBJECTIVE,This study aimed to evaluate post adenoidectomy quality of life in children with refractory chronic rhinosinusitis  
 2736817296,METHODS,A prospective interventional study of children aged 4 12 years with chronic refractory rhinosinusitis was conducted A total of 60 children completed follow up Nasal endoscopy and non contrast computed tomography of the paranasal sinuses were performed and both symptoms and their effects on patient quality of life pre and post adenoidectomy were evaluated  
 2736817296,RESULTS,The most frequent symptoms were nasal obstruction cough fever and fatigue which were experienced by 100 per cent 90 per cent 85 per cent and 81 7 per cent of children respectively Nasal endoscopy showed oedema and discharge were present in all children A statistically significant post operative improvement in sinus and nasal quality of life was seen in 53 children 88 3 per cent
