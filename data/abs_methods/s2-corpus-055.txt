 2001156254,BACKGROUND,The management of sudden sensorineural hearing loss has not yet been standardised Hyperbaric oxygen therapy influences recovery from sudden sensorineural hearing loss but the underlying mechanism is unknown and the appropriate indications and protocols undetermined  
 2001156254,MATERIALS AND METHODS,Nineteen patients affected by sudden sensorineural hearing loss were treated after unsuccessful medical therapy either in an acute or chronic setting Pure oxygen inhalation at 2 5 atmospheres absolute pressure was administered for 90 minutes for 30 sessions Frequency specific and average pure tone hearing thresholds were determined before and after hyperbaric oxygen therapy The number of hyperbaric oxygen therapy sessions the patient s age and any therapeutic delay were considered as quantitative variables possibly influencing outcome Stepwise multivariate analysis was performed  
 2001156254,RESULTS,Salvage hyperbaric oxygen therapy appeared to improve patients pure tone hearing thresholds particularly at low frequencies Positive results were more likely with increased patient age and reduced delay in receiving hyperbaric oxygen therapy
