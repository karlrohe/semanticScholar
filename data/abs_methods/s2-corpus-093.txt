 2011687522,OBJECTIVES,In the past the predominantly Black population of Newark NJ had little access to programs promoting or providing Pap tests The ratio of in situ to invasive cases of cervical carcinoma was markedly reduced in all age categories indicating inadequate screening for this cancer in this population Funding became available to provide and publicize Pap smears but ceased after 5 5 years We examined the effect of these changes in funding  
 2011687522,METHODS,Data came from all Newark hospitals and practitioners and from the state cancer registry There are now data on incidence of in situ and invasive cervical cancer in Newark from 1970 through 1988 including years before during and after program funding  
 2011687522,RESULTS,The ratio of in situ to invasive cervical cancer increased and decreased in a striking parallel with the provision and subsequent cessation of funding  
 2011687522,CONCLUSIONS,Cessation of funding of education and screening programs can result in resumption of an unfavorable in situ invasive cervical carcinoma ratio in a poor population

 2492692491,METHODS,A retrospective review was performed Inpatient palliative consultation was obtained in cancer patients from January 1 2014 to December 31 2014 Descriptive statistics are used in data analysis  
 2492692491,RESULTS,Inpatient palliative care consults IPCC were obtained for 245 cancer patients admitted to Saint Louis University Hospital Of the 245 130 were male 53 06 115 were female 46 93 128 were White 52 24 and 114 were Black 46 53 Newly diagnosed patients with cancer during the current admission were 79 32 24 57 23 26 patients were admitted to the Intensive care unit during hospitalization A total of 39 15 91 patients died in the hospital among those who died in the hospital 34 had ICU stay during the hospitalization or died in the ICU 87 Malignancies most common were lung 71 28 97 followed by pancreatic biliary 33 13 4 lymphoma and leukemia 22 8 9 hepatocellular carcinoma 18 7 34 head and neck 16 6 5 and upper GI 16 6 5 Disposition at discharge included home hospice 67 28 3 hospice in facility 27 11 home without hospice 71 28 9 facility without hospice 39 15 9  
 2492692491,CONCLUSIONS,According to the National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization as of 2013 7 0 hospice patients die in acute care hospitals Our data shows 15 9 who received IPCC died in the hospital with 87 dying in ICU This is likely due to delays in the initiation of palliative care consultation as outpatient leading to increase strain on tertiary referral centers In another study 22 of eligible Black patients received IPCC Our rate of IPCC in Blacks was 46 5 This highlights the disparity in access to outpatient palliative care in this population Future efforts should be made to promote early outpatient palliative services to reduce ICU admissions hospital re admissions and healthcare costs
