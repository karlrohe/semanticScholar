 2926254747,OBJECTIVE,The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of oral doxycycline treatment for Brugia malayi as measured by microfilarial and filarial DNA clearance in naturally infected domestic cats  
 2926254747,METHODS,This study included 8 domestic cats that lived with families that resided in Tak Bai District of Narathiwat Province which is located in Southern Thailand The study area is a known B malayi endemic area All study cats received doxycycline treatment doses by their respective owners according to a previously described protocol Briefly doxycycline VibraVet was given orally once a day during weeks 1 4 10 11 and 16 17 Blood collections were performed at baseline before treatment and then every month for 12 months after the initial dose of doxycycline to assess microfilaraemia by Giemsa stain and filarial DNA detection by high resolution melt HRM real time polymerase chain reaction PCR  
 2926254747,RESULTS,One month after the start of doxycycline treatment five of eight cats were negative for microfilaraemia and 4 of those were negative for filarial DNA All cats receiving doxycycline treatment were negative for microfilaria by Giemsa stain and for filarial DNA by HRM real time PCR within 8 months after receiving the initial dose of doxycycline treatment

 2117613850,BACKGROUND,Anterolateral knee cysts are not uncommon in the first 7 years of life but have not been described in the literature  
 2117613850,METHODS,Four patients presenting with an asymptomatic lump on the anterolateral joint line were reviewed  
 2117613850,RESULTS,The lump remains asymptomatic  
 2117613850,CONCLUSIONS,Anterolateral knee cysts of childhood are benign and do not require treatment Their cause is conjectural  
 2117613850,METHODS_DIFF,Four patients presenting with an asymptomatic lump on the anterolateral joint line were reviewed  

 2111138809,METHODS,We investigated the effects of hypoxia and A2B adenosine receptor signaling on migration invasion proteolytic activity of matrix metalloproteinase MMP 2 expression of MMP 2 and vascular endothelial growth factor VEGF mRNA and production of human chorionic gonadotropin hCG in trophoblast cells HTR 8 SVneo BeWo  
 2111138809,RESULTS,The adenosine A2B receptor agonist 5 N ethylcarboxamidoadenosine NECA reduced trophoblast HTR 8 SVneo and BeWo migration at 2 8 and 21 O2 compared to untreated control cells A2B adenosine receptor stimulation decreased phosphorylation of extracellular signal regulated kinases 1 and 2 ERK1 2 and stress activated protein kinase Jun amino terminal kinase SAPK JNK at all three O2 concentrations ProMMP 2 activity MMP 2 mRNA levels and hCG levels were markedly decreased after A2B adenosine receptor activation in trophoblast cells Adenosine receptor A2B stimulation decreased VEGF expression at 2 and 8 O2 but led to increased levels at 21 O2  
 2111138809,CONCLUSIONS,These data indicate A2B receptor activation blunts trophoblast migration possibly as a result of reduced activation of the MAPK signaling pathway and lower proMMP 2 levels These data suggest a role for adenosine receptor A2B in placental development and possibly in the pathophysiology of preeclampsia

 2083706716,METHODS,Patients who underwent verteporfin therapy for subfoveal classic CNV were assessed GLD of CNV was calculated manually from mean of 6 line scans GLD measured on OCT and FA was correlated by assessing the agreement of the two techniques by interclass correlation and Bland and Altman technique  
 2083706716,RESULTS,Twenty seven eyes of 27 patients with subfoveal classic CNV were included The mean age was 49 3 18 6 years The mean GLD calculated on FA was 1973 3 microm and OCT was 2024 2 microm Substantial agreement was observed between GLD measured on FA and OCT Inter Class Correlation ICC 0 77 95 confidence interval 0 56 to 0 89  
 2083706716,CONCLUSIONS,GLD measured on OCT correlates to FA measurement This method could be beneficial where FA is contraindicated while contemplating photodynamic therapy PDT
