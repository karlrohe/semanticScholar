 2342640730,OBJECTIVES,To determine the feasibility of converting ranking data into paired comparison PC data and suggest the number of alternatives that can be ranked by comparing a PC and a ranking method  
 2342640730,METHODS,Using a total of 222 health states a household survey was conducted in a sample of 300 individuals from the general population Each respondent performed a PC 15 times and a ranking method 6 times two attempts of ranking three four and five health states respectively The health states of the PC and the ranking method were constructed to overlap each other We converted the ranked data into PC data and examined the consistency of the response rate Applying probit regression we obtained the predicted probability of each method Pearson correlation coefficients were determined between the predicted probabilities of those methods The mean absolute error was also assessed between the observed and the predicted values  
 2342640730,RESULTS,The overall consistency of the response rate was 82 8 The Pearson correlation coefficients were 0 789 0 852 and 0 893 for ranking three four and five health states respectively The lowest mean absolute error was 0 082 95 confidence interval CI 0 074 0 090 in ranking five health states followed by 0 123 95 CI 0 111 0 135 in ranking four health states and 0 126 95 CI 0 113 0 138 in ranking three health states  
 2342640730,CONCLUSIONS,After empirically examining the consistency of the response rate between a PC and a ranking method we suggest that using five alternatives in the ranking method may be superior to using three or four alternatives

 2805739642,METHODS,A 1 cm incision was made over the lateral epicondyle in 13 fresh frozen cadaveric knee specimens and the LCL origin was determined first by palpation and then with a previously described fluoroscopic method Both points for the LCL origin were marked with 2 mm Kirschner wires The distances between the center of the anatomic LCL origin and the LCL origin points determined by palpation and fluoroscopic imaging were calculated An independent t test was used to compare the distances between the anatomic LCL origin center and the determined LCL origin points  
 2805739642,RESULTS,The LCL origin points determined by fluoroscopic imaging were significantly P  005 closer to the anatomic center of the LCL origin point than the ones determined by palpation 3 2 mm 1 6 mm vs 5 0 mm 1 6 mm respectively A total of 92 7 fluoroscopically determined LCL origin points were within a 5 mm radius surrounding the anatomic LCL origin point In contrast only 53 8 LCL origin points determined by palpation were within a 5 mm radius surrounding the anatomic LCL origin point  
 2805739642,CONCLUSIONS,The use of palpation to identify the LCL origin may not be an accurate method for performing an isometric and anatomic LCL reconstruction The use of fluoroscopic imaging appears to be a feasible method for identifying the LCL origin in clinical practice and may increase the accuracy of LCL origin identification Fluoroscopic guidance improves accuracy in determining the anatomic LCL origin which may help avoiding tunnel malplacement during LCL reconstruction CLINICAL RELEVANCE The use of a previously described radiographic method for identifying the LCL origin may be used to achieve a more anatomic LCL reconstruction
