 2900321649,METHODS,The data of UV B radiation reaching the Earth s surface were used for the evaluation These data based on regular measurements in Budapest According to the average of UV B radiation of each months the best case scenario of vitamin D3 production was estimated by using the most optimal conditions of vitamin D synthesis  
 2900321649,RESULTS,It was calculated that the effective UV irradiance reaching the Earth s surface at noon in Budapest is the highest in July while the lowest is in December The difference between these two months is more than 35 fold for July In the period between November and March more than 200 minutes have to be spent outdoor to ensure the production of satisfactory amount of vitamin D in skin On one hand it is irrealistically long time because it exceeds the duration of maximum irradiation around noon which was the basis of our calculation On the other hand if only the face and hands are uncovered then the required radiant exposure exceeds the 1 minimal erythemal dose i e the skin would be burnt  
 2900321649,CONCLUSIONS,Based on our calculations it was found that in Budapest more than 95 of yearly effective UV B radiation is measurable in the period between March and October Therefore it can be assumed that the UV B radiation would not be sufficient in the period between November and February even if its efficacy would not be limited by clothing and less time spent outdoor which are anyway characteristic and necessary in that part of the year
