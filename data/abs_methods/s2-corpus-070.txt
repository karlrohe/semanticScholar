 2188875282,MATERIAL AND METHODS,This retrospective study included 16 expanders in 14 patients Indications for tissue expansion were post burn scarring and contractures post mastectomy reconstruction and before excision of giant nevus The expanders were placed in the following sites scalp breast abdomen leg and arm  
 2188875282,RESULTS,Despite the fact that there were complications in 3 out of the 16 expanders used failure occurred in 1 expander which was removed The remaining complications were managed either by immediate delivery whenever expansion approached full size or by salvage of the expander by exteriorizing the buried part in cases of infection  

 2406002773,AIMS AND OBJECTIVES,The purposes of this study were to measure the prevalence of and identify factors associated with cervical cancer screening among a sample of lesbian bisexual and queer women and transgender men  
 2406002773,BACKGROUND,Past research has found that lesbian bisexual and queer women underuse cervical screening service Because deficient screening remains the most significant risk factor for cervical cancer it is essential to understand the differences between routine and nonroutine screeners  
 2406002773,METHODS,A convenience sample of 21 to 65 year old lesbian and bisexual women and transgender men were recruited in the USA from August December 2014 Quantitative data were collected via a 48 item Internet questionnaire N   226 and qualitative data were collected through in depth telephone interviews N   20 and open ended questions on the Internet questionnaire  
 2406002773,RESULTS,Seventy three per cent of the sample was routine cervical screeners The results showed that a constellation of factors influence the use of cervical cancer screening among lesbian bisexual and queer women Some of those factors overlap with the general female population whereas others are specific to the lesbian bisexual or queer identity Routine screeners reported feeling more welcome in the health care setting while nonroutine screeners reported more discrimination related to their sexual orientation and gender expression Routine screeners were also more likely to out to their provider The quantitative and qualitative factors were also compared and contrasted  
 2406002773,CONCLUSIONS,Many of the factors identified in this study to influence cervical cancer screening relate to the health care environment and to interactions between the patient and provider

 2070317106,OBJECTIVES,To investigate the effects of oral oxybutynin chloride OC on standard urodynamic measures in children with myelomeningocele MMC and detrusor hyperreflexia  
 2070317106,METHODS,Forty one MMC children with detrusor hyperreflexia 19 boys and 22 girls aged 2 months to 15 years mean 4 9 years were evaluated urodynamically before and within 3 months after initiation of oral OC therapy 0 2 to 0 3 mg kg day Therapy with oral OC was always combined with clean intermittent catheterization CIC  
 2070317106,RESULTS,Oral OC treatment caused an increase in bladder capacity from 141 96 to 197 99 mL 40 P 0 01 a decrease in detrusor pressure at maximal capacity from 45 32 to 28 23 cm H2O 38 P 0 01 and an increase in detrusor compliance from 6 5 5 6 to 16 8 13 7 mL cm H2O 158 P 0 01 Improvement in urodynamic measures and continence were correlated After a follow up of at least 2 years effective protection of renal function was achieved in 38 of the 41 children 93 with conservative therapy alone Adverse effects resulted in discontinuation of oral OC treatment in only 2 cases  
 2070317106,CONCLUSIONS,Treatment with oral OC and CIC is effective and safe in children with MMC and detrusor hyperreflexia and should be initiated early when indicated by urodynamic findings
