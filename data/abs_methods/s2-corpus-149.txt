 1528358187,MATERIALS AND METHODS,From December 2008 until December 2013 we compared the outcomes of 294 patients mean age 47 67 12 4 years range 16 to 74 years old who received grafts from donors 65 years old to 2339 patients who received grafts from donors who were younger than 65 years old  
 1528358187,RESULTS,We observed no significant differences in sex time on dialysis or cold ischemia time between the groups The recipient ages between two groups were similar For survival analysis we used the Kaplan Meier survival estimator Patient survival at 1 2 and 3 years was 91 1 89 1 and 88 5 respectively for patients transplanted with kidneys from donors 65 years old vs 96 7 95 9 and 95 0 respectively in the 65 year old donor group Multivariate analysis showed the variables associated with patient survival to be donor age at time of transplantation in years hazard ratio HR 1 65 95 confidence interval CI 1 59 1 71 P 05 time on dialysis in months HR 1 22 95 CI 1 21 1 23 P 002 Graft survival rates at 1 2 and 3 years censored for death with functional graft at was 97 6 96 4 and 94 1 respectively for patients transplanted with kidneys from donors older than 65 years vs 97 5 96 8 and 95 2 respectively in the 65 year old donor group Multivariate analysis HLA DR mismatches HR 1 23 95 CI 1 12 1 55 P 050 delayed graft function HR 1 77 95 CI 1 53 2 07 P 021 and perhaps acute rejection HR 1 14 95 CI 0 82 1 95 P 093 were the variables associated with graft survival

 2149826384,METHODS,A validated cognitive examination comprehensive cognitive neurological test in stroke Coconuts was administered during the first month of stroke presentation and analyzed according to five large scale networks for cognition and correlated with neuropsychological tests Validity testing of the test was performed for overall sensitivity specificity positive predictive value and negative predictive value to stroke in comparison with MRI diagnosis of stroke as well as discriminant validity construct validity and inter rater reliability  
 2149826384,RESULTS,Overall the sensitivity of the Coconuts scale was 91 and specificity 35 PPV 88 and NPV 41 vs stroke lesions using MRI Cognitive syndrome frequencies frontal network syndrome frequency was 908 1796 51 left hemisphere network syndrome frequency was 646 1796 36 right hemisphere network included 275 1796 15 3 occipitotemporal network for complex visual processing 107 1796 6 the hippocampal limbic network for amnesias and emotional disorders 397 1796 22 and miscellaneous network syndromes 481 1796 27
