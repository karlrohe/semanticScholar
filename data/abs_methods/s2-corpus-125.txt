 2773027781,DESIGN METHODS,A quasi experimental pre posttest research design without a control group was employed A total of 22 patients participated Self reported daily logs were used to evaluate intervention adherence over the study period The manual muscle testing and Aphasic Depression Rating Scale were administered at baseline and weekly for 4 weeks  
 2773027781,RESULTS,Muscle strength in both the upper and lower limbs significantly increased p 05 whereas the depression score significantly decreased p 05  

 2208893463,BACKGROUND,Serum HBeAg status and liver cirrhosis severity at the time of diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma HCC in hepatitis B virus HBV related cirrhosis remain inconclusive The aim was to investigate the status of HBeAg and cirrhosis severity at the time of HCC development in the natural history of HBV related cirrhosis in mainland China  
 2208893463,MATERIAL METHODS,In a retrospective cross sectional hospital based setting HBeAg status and severity of underlying cirrhosis estimated by MELD model for end stage liver disease scores and aspartate aminotransferase AST to platelet ratio index APRI were comprehensively compared in 377 HBsAg positive compensated and decompensated liver cirrhosis and 434 with HCC patients to clarify the independent and joint effects of the factors  
 2208893463,RESULTS,The majority 80 6 of the HCC patients was negative for serum HBeAg More than two thirds of the patients with HCC had MELD scores 10 Severity of underlying liver cirrhosis and loss of serum HBeAg independently correlated with the risk of HCC development Compared with the contrast group of HBeAg positive patients with MELD scores or 20 the odds ratio of HCC development in the patients with HBeAg negativity and MELD score 10 was 26 51 95 CI 8 98 78 28  
 2208893463,CONCLUSIONS,A large proportion of HBV related cirrhotic patients had negative serum HBeAg and mild cirrhosis severity at the time of diagnosis of HCC  

 2104901200,BACKGROUND,Intensification of chemoradiation for advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma HNSCC is unlikely due to toxicity Cetuximab combined either with radiotherapy or with chemotherapy showed favourable toxic profile with positive results in both combinations Therefore cetuximab could intensify chemoradiation without worsening toxicity We conducted a phase II study of chemoradiation and cetuximab  
 2104901200,PATIENTS AND METHODS,Eligible patients had stage III IV M0 HNSCC Treatment consisted of three cycles of cisplatin 20 mg m 2 day 5 days and fluorouracil 200 mg m 2 day 5 days rapidly alternated to three split courses of radiotherapy up to 70 Gy and concurrent weekly cetuximab The primary end point of the study was complete response CR rate Secondary end points were toxicity progression free survival PFS and overall survival OS  
 2104901200,RESULTS,Fourty five patients were enrolled median age was 56 years 38 had stage IV disease and 40 nodal involvement CR occurred in 32 patients 71 PFS and OS was 21 months and 32 6 respectively Acute grade 3 4 toxic effects were in the expected range but grade 3 radiodermatitis occurred in 33 patients  
 2104901200,CONCLUSIONS,The combination of cetuximab cisplatin fluorouracil and radiotherapy leads to a very high proportion of CR and it is feasible with toxic effects similar to those expected by radiochemotherapy The only unexpected toxicity was skin toxicity grade 3 radiodermatitis occurred in 73 of the patients  

 2129934674,METHODS,Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy was used to evaluate the DC of the orthodontic composites immediately after polymerization and after storage in artificial saliva at 37 C 1 C for 30 days The resin based adhesive composites investigated were Bisco Ortho Bisco Schaumburg Ill Heliosit Orthodontics Ivoclar Schaan Liechtenstein Kurasper F Kuraray Okayama Japan Light Bond Reliance Orthodontic Products Itasca Ill and Transbond XT 3M Unitek Monrovia Calif cured with Elipar FreeLight 2 3M ESPE St Paul Minn for the testing of the DC values Fifty cylindrical specimens were manufactured in molds The data were analyzed by 2 factor analysis of variance ANOVA and Tukey HSD test  
 2129934674,RESULTS,According to 2 way ANOVA the DC was significantly influenced by composite type P  0 05 after 30 days there were no differences among the composite types for the DC The interaction of orthodontic composites and time played a statistically significant role in the DC P  0 05 but there was no statistically significant influence of time for the DC P 0 05  
 2129934674,CONCLUSIONS,The DC was found to change according to composite materials used and Bisco Ortho showed the most DC performance The DC of orthodontic composites is a complex process that is affected not only by inorganic filler content of the composite but also the monomer type and many other factors Sufficient DC values of 5 commercially available orthodontic composites can be achieved with a new generation light emitting diode curing light
