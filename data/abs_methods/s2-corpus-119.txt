 2112758420,BACKGROUND,Stroke is a major cause of morbidity and mortality during open heart surgery Up to 60 of intraoperative cerebral events are emboli induced This randomized controlled multicenter trial is the first human study evaluating the safety and efficacy of a novel aortic cannula producing simultaneous forward flow and backward suction for extracting solid and gaseous emboli from the ascending aorta and aortic arch upon their intraoperative release  
 2112758420,METHODS,Sixty six patients 25 females 68 10 years undergoing elective aortic valve replacement surgery with or without coronary artery bypass graft surgery were randomized to the use of the CardioGard CardioGard Medical Or Yehuda Israel Emboli Protection cannula treatment or a standard control aortic cannula The primary endpoint was the volume of new brain lesions measured by diffusion weighted magnetic resonance imaging DW MRI performed preoperatively and postoperatively Device safety was investigated by comparisons of complications rate namely neurologic events stroke renal insufficiency and death  
 2112758420,RESULTS,Of 66 patients 34 in the treatment group 51 completed the presurgery and postsurgery MRI 27 in the treatment group The volume of new brain lesion for the treatment group was mean standard error of the mean 44 00 64 00 versus 126 56 28 74 mm3 in the control group p 0 004 Of the treatment group 41 demonstrated new postoperative lesions versus 66 in the control group p 0 03 The complication rate was comparable in both groups  
 2112758420,CONCLUSIONS,The CardioGard cannula is safe and efficient in use during open heart surgery Efficacy was demonstrated by the removal of a substantial amount of emboli a significant reduction in the volume of new brain lesions and the percentage of patients experiencing new brain lesions
