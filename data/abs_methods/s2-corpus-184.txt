 2587804531,MATERIALS AND METHODS,One hundred and thirty eight patients with suspected coronary artery disease body mass index BMI 25kg m2 and heart rate HR 70 beats per minute bpm underwent prospectively ECG triggered high pitch CCTA at 70 kVp and 30mL contrast agent protocol A and prospectively ECG triggered sequential scanning at 120 kVp and 60mL contrast medium protocol B Objective and subjective image quality radiation doses and diagnostic accuracy were evaluated and compared between the two protocols  
 2587804531,RESULTS,Higher CT attenuation higher noise lower signal to noise ratios SNRs and lower contrast to noise ratios CNRs were found in protocol A than in protocol B P 0 001 However image quality of protocol A were diagnostic In patients with BMI 23kg m2 or HR 60bpm subjective image quality scores of some coronary arteries in protocol A were not significantly different from protocol B P 0 05 Effective dose in protocol A has reduced by 96 7 compared with protocol B P 0 001 No significant differences were found for diagnostic accuracy between the two protocols on a per segment P 0 513 per vessel P 0 317 and per patient P 0 125 basis  
 2587804531,CONCLUSIONS,Prospectively ECG triggered high pitch CCTA at 70kVp with 30mL contrast agent can reduce radiation dose but maintain image quality and high diagnostic accuracy in a selected non obese population
