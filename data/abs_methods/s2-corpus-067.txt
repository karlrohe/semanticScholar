 2568992454,BACKGROUND,For nearly 51 million persons in the United States who lack health care insurance the emergency department ED functions as a safety net where no patient is denied care based on ability to pay and much public rhetoric has characterized ED utilization by uninsured patients We estimated national ED utilization by uninsured patients and compared uninsured and insured ED patients in terms of demographics diagnostic testing disposition and final diagnoses  
 2568992454,METHODS,We analyzed data from the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey 2006 2009 stratified by insurance status Demographic data diagnoses testing and procedures performed in the ED were tabulated for each visit Weighted percentages provided by National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey were used to estimate national rates for each variable and multivariate models were constructed for predicting testing procedures and admission  
 2568992454,RESULTS,The 135085 ED visits represent 475 million patients visits of which 78 9 million 16 6 were uninsured Compared with insured patients uninsured patients were more often male 51 1 vs 44 3 and younger age 18 44 years 66 2 vs 35 4 Uninsured patients had lower rates of circulatory cardiovascular 7 5 vs 4 1 and respiratory diagnoses 14 6 vs 11 8 Uninsured patients had fewer diagnostic tests and procedures and fewer hospital admissions than those with insurance In our multivariate models insurance status was predictive of testing and procedures but not hospital admission  
 2568992454,CONCLUSIONS,Uninsured patients account for approximately 20 million or 1 in 6 ED visits annually in the United States and have differences in demographics diagnoses and ED utilization patterns from those with insurance
