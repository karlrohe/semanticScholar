 2534563352,OBJECTIVES,Propolis is a natural product with a complex chemical composition Its isolated compounds exert biological activities however its synergistic effects are unknown The involvement of phenolic acids caffeic Caf dihydrocinnamic Cin and p coumaric Cou alone or in combination was investigated in the action of propolis in human monocytes  
 2534563352,METHODS,Cell viability was analysed by MTT assay TNF α IL 6 and IL 10 production by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay ELISA cell markers expression by flow cytometry colony forming units were counted to assess the microbicidal activity and H2 O2 production was analysed by colorimetric assay

 2067772384,BACKGROUND,Neuroblastoma the most frequent solid extracranial tumor in children is characterized by a wide spectrum of clinical behaviours We previously reported that high expression of somatostatin receptor type 2 sst2 mRNA is associated to increased overall and event free survival Several genetic abnormalities are detected in neuroblastomas frequently involving balanced and or unbalanced gain on the long arm on chromosome 17 the same region containing sst2 gene  
 2067772384,METHODS,In this study we detected balanced and or unbalanced 17q gain in 50 neuroblastomas Since two polymorphisms in sst2 promoter 57 C G and 83 A G were previously described as responsible for an in vitro reduction of sst2 mRNA expression promoter sequencing was also performed in the same samples The results were compared to sst2 mRNA expression measured by real time RT PCR  
 2067772384,RESULTS,The frequency of 17q gain 14 50 neuroblastomas was significantly associated to sst2 mRNA over expression Fischer s exact test p 0 0012 The sst2 expression was significant higher both in balance and unbalance 17q amplifications ANOVA p 0 04 Conversely we found a reduction of sst2 mRNA in neuroblastomas with 57 C G promoter polymorphism ANOVA p 0 03

 2767076026,OBJECTIVES,We sought to assess the relationship between the magnitude of low density lipoprotein cholesterol LDL C lowering and rates of elevated liver enzymes rhabdomyolysis and cancer  
 2767076026,BACKGROUND,Although it is often assumed that statin associated adverse events are proportional to LDL C reduction that assumption has not been validated  
 2767076026,METHODS,Adverse events reported in large prospective randomized statin trials were evaluated The relationship between LDL C reduction and rates of elevated liver enzymes rhabdomyolysis and cancer per 100 000 person years was assessed using weighted univariate regression  
 2767076026,RESULTS,In 23 statin treatment arms with 309 506 person years of follow up there was no significant relationship between percent LDL C lowering and rates of elevated liver enzymes R2 0 001 p 0 91 or rhabdomyolysis R2 0 05 p 0 16 Similar results were obtained when absolute LDL C reduction or achieved LDL C levels were considered In contrast for any 10 LDL C reduction rates of elevated liver enzymes increased significantly with higher statin doses Additional analyses demonstrated a significant inverse association between cancer incidence and achieved LDL C levels R2 0 43 p 0 009 whereas no such association was demonstrated with percent LDL C reduction R2 0 09 p 0 92 or absolute LDL C reduction R2 0 05 p 0 23  
 2767076026,CONCLUSIONS,Risk of statin associated elevated liver enzymes or rhabdomyolysis is not related to the magnitude of LDL C lowering However the risk of cancer is significantly associated with lower achieved LDL C levels These findings suggest that drug and dose specific effects are more important determinants of liver and muscle toxicity than magnitude of LDL C lowering Furthermore the cardiovascular benefits of low achieved levels of LDL C may in part be offset by an increased risk of cancer
