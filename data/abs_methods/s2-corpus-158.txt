 2073270764,OBJECTIVE,There has been reports on the usefulness of diffusion tensor imaging DTI about age or disease related degradation DTI is generally evaluated by the region of interest ROI methodology In this study we applied a statistical way using Statistical Parametric Mapping SPM to assess normal aging by DTI and compared results of these two methods  
 2073270764,METHODS,Ten young and ten senior normal volunteers were examined On SPM tensor images were changed into normalized tensor images They were compared between the two groups by t test  
 2073270764,RESULTS,In the senior group fractional anisotropy FA values were higher on the basal ganglia cingulated gyrus and other cortical gray matter lower in the corona radiata internal capsule centrum semiovale and corpus callosum by using SPM In the ROI method the results were almost compatible except in the brain periphery  
 2073270764,CONCLUSIONS,Aging changes on water diffusion anisotropy was clearly shown by SPM method which would be useful to evaluate change of water diffusion anisotropy without operator bias even in clinical setting instead of ROI measurement

 2766150903,OBJECTIVE,The Feline Chronic Enteropathy Activity Index FCEAI has been established as a quantitative index for disease activity in chronic enteropathies in cats A definite diagnosis is aimed at histology with initial exclusion of extraintestinal causes by laboratory examinations diagnostic imaging and endoscopy The study aimed to examine diagnostic parameters and FCEAI in chronic gastroenteropathies  
 2766150903,MATERIALS AND METHODS,A retrospective case review of 147 cats with chronic enteropathies was performed In all patients the FCEAI was established and endoscopy performed including biopsies and duodenal cytology Histopathologic reports were reviewed for the diagnosis of lymphoma and architectural changes epithelial integrity villi gland atrophy intestinal crypt atrophy lymphangiectasia epitheliotropism infiltration of intraepithelial lymphocytes A cytopathologic score CS and histopathologic score HS regarding lymphocytic intestinal infiltration were assigned Statistical dependency analysis was used to determine correlations between the FCEAI lymphoma architectural changes CS HS serum concentrations of cobalamin folate and albumin  
 2766150903,RESULTS,The 147 cats consisted of predominately European Shorthair cats n   126 were mostly castrated n   127 and had a mean age of 9 8 1 17 years For the proven lymphoma group 12 2 n   18 and the non lymphoma group a mean FCEAI of 7 3 4 17 and 6 6 2 13 respectively was established The FCEAI showed a low correlation with the CS p   0 010 R   0 22 and intestinal villous atrophy n   121 p   0 035 R   0 19 Cats with a CS of 0 had a significant lower FCEAI score p   0 015 than cats with all other CSs The histo and cytopathologic scores were highly related p   0 001 R   0 43 The gastric intraepithelial lymphocytic infiltration n   131 was significantly correlated to serum folate p   0 014 R    0 56 and albumin p   0 048 R    0 20
