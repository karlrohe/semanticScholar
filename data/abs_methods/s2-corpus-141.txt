 2173485887,BACKGROUND,Despite the high prevalence of herpes simplex virus type 2 HSV 2 in sub Saharan Africa the natural history of infection among Africans is not well characterized We evaluated the frequency of genital HSV shedding in HIV seropositive and HIV seronegative men and women in Uganda  
 2173485887,METHODS,Ninety three HSV 2 seropositive Ugandan adults collected anogenital swab specimens for HSV DNA quantification by polymerase chain reaction 3 times daily for 6 weeks  
 2173485887,RESULTS,HSV 2 was detected from 2484 of 11 283 swab specimens collected 22 with a median quantity of 4 3 log10 HSV copies mL range 2 2 8 9 log10 HSV copies mL Genital lesions were reported on 749 of 3875 days 19 and subclinical HSV shedding was detected from 1480 of 9113 swab specimens 16 collected on days without lesions Men had higher rates of total HSV shedding relative risk RR 2 0 95 confidence interval CI 1 3 2 9 P 001 subclinical shedding RR 1 7 95 CI 1 1 2 7 P 01 and genital lesions RR 2 1 95 CI 1 2 3 4 P 005 compared with women No differences in shedding rates or lesion frequency were observed based on HIV serostatus  
 2173485887,CONCLUSIONS,HSV 2 shedding frequency and quantity are high among HSV 2 seropositive adults in sub Saharan Africa including persons with and those without HIV infection Shedding rates were particularly high among men which may contribute to the high prevalence of HSV 2 and early acquisition among African women
