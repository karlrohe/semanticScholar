 1812266447,BACKGROUND,Insulin like growth factor I IGF I is a pleiotropic hormone Several studies have related IGF I levels to dementia but evidence remains inconclusive IGF I receptor stimulating activity is a more direct measure of biologically available IGF I than total IGF I levels  
 1812266447,OBJECTIVE,To investigate whether IGF I receptor stimulating activity is associated with prevalent and incident dementia  
 1812266447,METHODS,IGF I receptor stimulating activity was measured using an IGF I kinase receptor activation assay in 1 014 persons from the Rotterdam Study Dementia was assessed at baseline 1997 1999 and continuously during follow up until September 2011 Associations of IGF I receptor stimulating activity with prevalent dementia were investigated using logistic regression and with incident dementia using Cox proportional hazards models All models were adjusted for age and gender and additionally for hypertension glucose waist circumference APOE ε4 carrier status total cholesterol and HDL cholesterol  
 1812266447,RESULTS,Thirty participants had prevalent dementia and during 8 589 person years of follow up 135 persons developed incident dementia A higher level of IGF I receptor stimulating activity was associated with a higher prevalence of dementia fully adjusted odds ratio 1 47 95 CI 1 10 1 97 and with a higher risk of incident dementia fully adjusted hazard ratio 1 15 95 CI 1 00 1 33 Similar associations were found for Alzheimer s disease and in persons without diabetes mellitus  
 1812266447,CONCLUSIONS,Higher levels of IGF I receptor stimulating activity are associated with a higher prevalence and with a higher incidence of dementia These results suggest that IGF I increases in response to neuropathological changes in dementia and could reflect a state of IGF I resistance in dementia

 2000196280,BACKGROUND,Perinatal stress may programme overweight and obesity We examined whether maternal pre and post natal bereavement was associated with overweight and obesity in young men  
 2000196280,METHODS,A cohort study was conducted including 119 908 men born from 1976 to 1993 and examined for military service between 2006 and 2011 Among them 4 813 conscripts were born to mothers bereaved by death of a close relative from 12 months preconception to birth of the child exposed group Median body mass index BMI and prevalence of overweight and obesity were estimated Odds ratio of overweight BMI 25 kg m2 and obesity BMI 30 kg m2 were estimated by logistic regression analysis adjusted for maternal educational level  
 2000196280,RESULTS,Median BMI was similar in the exposed and the unexposed group but the prevalence of overweight 33 3 versus 30 4 p   0 02 and obesity 9 8 versus 8 5 p   0 06 was higher in the exposed group Conscripts exposed 6 to 0 months before conception and during pregnancy had a higher risk of overweight odds ratio 1 15 95 confidence interval CI 1 03 1 27 and odds ratio 1 13 95 CI 1 03 1 25 respectively Conscripts born to mothers who experienced death of the child s biological father before child birth had a two fold risk of obesity odds ratio 2 00 95 CI 0 93 4 31 There was no elevated risk in those who experienced maternal bereavement postnatally
