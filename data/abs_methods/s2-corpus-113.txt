 253615155,BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES,The Deficit Reduction Act DRA of 2005 mandated Medicaid beneficiaries to document citizenship Using a prospective cohort n 104 375 we aimed to 1 determine characteristics of affected children 2 describe effects on health insurance coverage and access to needed health care and 3 model the causal relationship between this new policy known determinants of health care access and receipt of needed health care  
 253615155,METHODS,We identified a stratified random sample of children shortly after the DRA was implemented and used state records and surveys to compare three groups children denied Medicaid for inability to document citizenship children denied for other reasons and children accepted for coverage To combat survey nonresponse we used Medicaid records to identify differences between responders and nonrespondents and created survey weights to account for these differences Weighted simple and multivariable logistic regression described the complete originally identified population  
 253615155,RESULTS,Children denied Medicaid for inability to document citizenship were likely to be US citizens were medically and socially more vulnerable than their peers and went on to have gaps in health insurance coverage and unmet health care needs The DRA led to persistent loss of insurance coverage which decreased access to needed health care Having a usual source of care was an effect modifier in this relationship  
 253615155,CONCLUSIONS,Our findings demonstrate the negative consequences of the DRA and support the use of automated methods of citizenship verification allowed under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act

 2950964329,METHODS,From March 2015 to March 2018 patients who were admitted to the urologic outpatient clinic A new intraurethral self retaining device ISRD was made of medical grade silicone and it was inspired by similar catheters that use sliding disks to adjust or fix tubes used to drain the bladder Patients were randomized into two groups experimental group GI ISRD vs control group GII CIC The evaluation was performed at the time of enrollment and 6 months after treatment Intervention was initiated from the antisepsis of the perineal region and subsequent introduction of the device through the external urethral meatus The primary outcome was quality of life QOL Urinary tract infections UTIs episodes data on urodynamic parameters adverse effects and number of diapers per day  
 2950964329,RESULTS,A total of 177 subjects were analyzed We found a significant improvement on QOL analysis in the ISRD group P    01 ISRD group presented an important reduction two episodes after ISRD use on number of UTIs P    01 and diaper use and significant improvement on bladder capacity 80 mL of the average improvement P    01 and compliance P    01 Among all registered serious adverse effects ISRD presented with lower proportion  
 2950964329,CONCLUSIONS,The new device has shown to be a safe and promising alternative for adequate emptying of the neurogenic bladder in female patients Our study has a limitation that is related to a limited period of observation

 2071671490,BACKGROUND,Insufficient blood flow to the splanchnic organs is believed to be an important contributory factor for the development of organ failure after septic shock It has been suggested that increasing systemic flow also may improve splanchnic blood flow in septic patients The aim of this study was to compare the effects of three commonly used inotropic agents dopamine dobutamine and dopexamine on systemic cardiac index regional superior mesenteric artery and local micro circulatory blood flow during septic shock in pigs  
 2071671490,METHODS,Eight pigs were intravenously anesthetized mechanically ventilated and exposed to sepsis induced by fecal peritonitis Cardiac index was measured with thermodilution superior mesenteric artery flow was measured with ultrasound transit time flowmetry and microcirculatory blood flow was continuously measured with a six channel laser Doppler flowmetry in the gastric jejunal and colon mucosa as well as in the kidney pancreas and jejunal muscularis Each animal received in a random order crossover design the three test drugs one at a time 5 and 10 microg x kg 1 x min 1 dopamine 5 and 10 microg x kg 1 x min 1 dobutamine and 1 and 2 microg x kg 1 x min 1 dopexamine Administration of each drug at each dose continued for 30 min and was followed by a 40 to 60 min recovery period A new baseline was taken before the next drug was administered  
 2071671490,RESULTS,All three drugs significantly increased cardiac index dopamine by 18 dobutamine by 48 and dopexamine by 35 compared with baseline P 0 001 for each At the same time superior mesenteric artery flow increased by 33 P 0 01 with dopamine and 13 P 0 01 with dopexamine whereas it did not change with dobutamine Microcirculatory blood flow did not change significantly in any of the organs studied with any of the drugs tested
