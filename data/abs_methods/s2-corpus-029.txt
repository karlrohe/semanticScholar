 2276410496,BACKGROUND,Only one study has investigated the combined effect of maternal asthma and obesity on perinatal outcomes however it did not consider small for gestational age and large for gestational age infants  
 2276410496,OBJECTIVES,To examine the impact of obesity on perinatal outcomes among asthmatic women  
 2276410496,METHODS,A cohort of 1386 pregnancies from asthmatic women was reconstructed using three of Quebec s administrative databases and a questionnaire Women were categorized using their prepregnancy body mass index Underweight overweight and obese women were compared with normal weight women The primary outcome was the birth of a small for gestational age infant defined as a birth weight below the 10th percentile for gestational age and sex Secondary outcomes were large for gestational age infants birth weight 90th percentile for gestational age and preterm birth 37 weeks gestation Logistic regression models were used to obtain the ORs of having small for gestational age infants large for gestational age infants and preterm birth as a function of body mass index  
 2276410496,RESULTS,The proportions of underweight normal weight overweight and obese women were 10 8 53 3 19 7 and 16 2 respectively Obese asthmatic women were not found to be significantly more at risk for giving birth to small for gestational age infants OR 0 6 95 CI 0 4 to 1 1 large for gestational age infants OR 1 2 95 CI 0 7 to 2 2 or having a preterm delivery OR 0 7 95 CI 0 4 to 1 3 than normal weight asthmatic women  
 2276410496,CONCLUSIONS,No significant negative interaction between maternal asthma and obesity on adverse perinatal outcomes was observed

 2157661597,METHODS,In a cluster randomized controlled trial including 16 occupational physicians OP and 523 employees guideline based care was compared to usual care by OP between 2009 2011 in the Netherlands Guideline based care consisted of i providing advice to employers on how to assess and intervene on the obesogenic work environment ii conducting five face to face behavioral change counseling sessions with employees to improve their lifestyles and iii evaluating the outcome and maintaining sections i and ii Data were collected at baseline and 6 12 and 18 months follow up To evaluate the effects of the intervention multilevel analyses were performed  
 2157661597,RESULTS,No significant differences were found between the intervention and control group on waist circumference β 1 2 cm 95 confidence interval 95 CI 0 6 2 9 body weight β 0 3 kg 95 CI 1 0 1 6 body mass index β 0 1 kg m 2 95 CI 0 3 0 5 systolic blood pressure β 1 7 mmHG 95 CI 2 4 5 8 diastolic blood pressure β 0 3 mmHG 95 CI 1 0 0 6 cholesterol β 0 mmol l 95 CI 0 2 0 2 or quality of life indicators after 18 months follow up Stratified analyses showed an increase in waist circumference among men β 2 5 cm 95 CI 0 5 4 5 and obese intervention participants β 2 7 cm 95 CI 0 6 4 7 compared to control participants
