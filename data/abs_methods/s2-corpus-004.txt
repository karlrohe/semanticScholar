 2405105927,BACKGROUND,N acetylcysteine NAC is reported to have potential for prevention of contrast induced nephropathy CIN however there is not enough data related to its effects on diabetic patients without nephropathy  
 2405105927,METHODS,A total of 45 diabetic patients without nephropathy undergoing a computerized tomography CT investigation and who would be receiving radio opaque medication 300 mg iohexaol 100 mL were enrolled They were randomized to have either high dose NAC 1200 mg plus saline hydration Group 1 n 25 or only saline hydration Group 2 n 20 Serum creatinine levels were determined 72 hours post contrast CIN was defined as 0 3 mg dL elevation of creatinine from baseline and or an increment of 20 over baseline creatinine and or 20 decrement of estimated GFR  
 2405105927,RESULTS,In Group 1 serum creatinine decreased from 0 83 to 0 79 mg dL whereas serum creatinine increased from 0 81 to 0 94 mg dL in Group 2 not significant for both groups However there was a significant difference between the creatinine variation of two groups p 0 031 Furthermore the groups were analyzed according to overall incidence of CIN The increase of serum creatinine and decrement of estimated GFR in Group 2 were significantly higher than in Group 1

 2013514357,METHODS,A cluster randomised trial was conducted in 12 primary care clinics in Tshwane district A total of 599 diabetic patients attending these clinics for review were consecutively interviewed and clinically examined Data on the care received was also obtained from their clinical records for the previous 12 months Patients randomised to the active arm of the study were screened for complications  
 2013514357,RESULTS,The mean age was 58 years and 80 5 had a body mass index BMI 25 kg m 2 Sixty eight percent of patients were female Acceptable glycaemic control and LDL cholesterol were found for only 27 and 33 of patients respectively HbA1c 7 LDL 2 5 mmol l Despite more than 79 of patients reporting to be hypertensive 68 of patients had a systolic blood pressure above 130 mmHg and 64 had a diastolic blood pressure above 80 mmHg Evaluating patient records of the preceding year screening for eye complications was only reported in 8 2 feet complications in 6 5 kidney complications in 21 4 and cardiovascular complications in 7 8 The screening prevalences found were 29 for retinopathy 22 for maculopathy 5 for neuropathy neurothesiometer 7 for nephropathy eGFR stages 3 5 17 for possible infarction Rose questionnaire and 36 for severe erectile dysfunction SHIM questionnaire
