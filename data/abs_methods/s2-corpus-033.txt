 1979589362,BACKGROUND,There is little published data on the use of antithymocyte globulins in children This retrospective study describes the use of Thymoglobulin Imtix SangStat Lyon France in pediatric cardiac transplantation over a 13 year period in a single center that adjusted the dose of Thymoglobulin according to platelet count monitoring and examines the short term hematological effects as well as longer term outcomes  
 1979589362,METHODS,Data for all children who received a heart transplant at the Hôpital Cardiologique at Lyon from 1984 to 2001 and who were given Thymoglobulin as part of their immunosuppressive protocol were extracted The dose of Thymoglobulin given depended on baseline platelet count and was 2 1 5 or 1 mg kg per day over 5 days for the following platelet count groups greater than 150 000 mm normal group 100 to 150 000 mm mild thrombocytopenia group and 50 to 100 000 mm moderate thrombocytopenia group  
 1979589362,RESULTS,Thirty children of median age 14 2 years were given a median cumulative dose of Thymoglobulin of 8 mg kg per patient the moderate thrombocytopenia subgroup was given significantly less 6 4 mg kg P 0 032 Immediate tolerability of Thymoglobulin was good with no cases of first dose syndrome anaphylaxis or serum sickness The platelet count decreased at the start of therapy but recovered after discontinuation and did not give rise to clinical concern Patients were followed up for a median of 6 3 years 7 days 15 5 years actuarial survival was 90 86 and 74 5 respectively at 1 5 and 10 years In the first year 50 of patients suffered an episode of rejection The overall incidence of infection in the month following transplantation was 40 One lymphoma occurred at 5 months  
 1979589362,CONCLUSIONS,The use of Thymoglobulin in pediatric heart transplant patients as part of an immunosuppressive protocol with dose adjustment according to platelet levels has been shown to be effective in terms of rejection rate and patient survival and safe in terms of the incidence of infections and malignancy
