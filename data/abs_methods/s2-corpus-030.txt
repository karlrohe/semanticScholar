 ,OBJECTIVE,To investigate the effects of chronic mercury poisoning on blood coagulation and fibrinolysis systems and the possible mechanism  
 ,METHODS,Twenty seven patients with chronic mercury poisoning were studied with 30 healthy people as control Thrombomodulin TM tissue plasminogen activator t PA plasminogen activator inhibitor PAI interleukin 13 IL 13 interleukin 18 IL 18 soluble intercellular adhesion molecule 1 SICAM 1 were examined with ELISA methods and superoxide dismutase SOD and lipid peroxidation LPO was examined with chemical catalysis methods Two to three weeks after treatment with reduced glutathione tiopronin and daidzein blood was used for determin the above items again  
 ,RESULTS, 1 The concentration of TM in patients 2 36 0 16 ng ml was significantly lower than in the control 4 36 0 24 ng ml P 0 01 while TM tended to be higher after treatment 4 82 0 34 ng ml P 0 05 2 The concentration of t PA in patients 3 44 0 34 ng ml was significantly lower than in the control 4 52 0 16 ng ml P 0 05 and was higher significantly 5 63 0 58 ng ml after treatment P 0 05 The concentration of PAI in patients 48 23 3 59 ng ml was significantly higher than in the control 31 59 2 13 ng ml P 0 05 but after treatment no significant change 50 71 4 29 ng ml was found P 0 05 3 The activity of SOD in patients 953 85 9 56 U g Hb was significantly lower than in the control 1 308 75 10 21 U g Hb P 0 01 and was higher significantly 1 217 95 6 29 U g Hb after treatment P 0 05 and the concentration of LPO in patients 9 53 0 26 nmol ml was significantly higher than in the control P 0 05 and significantly lower 7 29 0 35 nmol ml after treatment P 0 05 4 The concentrations of IL 13 35 93 5 28 pg ml IL 18 28 79 2 53 pg ml SICAM 1 603 16 29 12 ng ml were significantly higher than those in the controls P 0 05 P 0 01 but no significant difference was found after treatment

 2791690503,METHODS,In a prospective study between October 2015 and November 2016 20 patients underwent transperitoneal SLND for nodal recurrence of PCa after RP at our institution Standardized urodynamics were performed pre and postoperatively after 6 weeks 3 and 6 to 12 months Prostate specific antigen PSA levels were used to monitor the oncological outcome Perioperative outcomes encompassed among others type of complications after surgery classified to Clavien Dindo  
 2791690503,RESULTS,The proportion of patients with neurogenic bladder dysfunction was postoperative at 6 weeks 3 and 6 to 12 months 78 5 70 and 45 5 respectively Compared to preoperative urodynamics follow ups revealed a statistical significant cleavage of bladder wall compliance until six to twelve months after SLND 34 5 vs 22 mL cmH2 O P   0 044 Referring to the oncological outcome all patients experienced a PSA progression 10 patients 50 within 11 weeks after surgery Overall four patients 20 suffered from a postoperative complication after SLND which comprises Clavien grade I IIIa  
 2791690503,CONCLUSIONS,Transperitoneal SLND as a treatment option for patients with nodal recurrence of PCa after RP reveals additional potential pitfalls than previously reported Urodynamics reveal a significant impact of SLND on postoperative functional bladder dysfunctions Therefore informed consent prior to SLND should include the risk of persistent low compliance bladder
