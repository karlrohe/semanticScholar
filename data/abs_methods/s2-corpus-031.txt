 2765766150,METHODS,An algorithm was developed to detect delays in follow up of abnormal mammographic results 60 days for BI RADS 0 4 and 5 and 7 months for BI RADS 3 using clinical data in the electronic health record Flagged records were then manually reviewed to determine the trigger s performance characteristics positive and negative predictive value sensitivity and specificity The frequency of delays and patient communication related to abnormal results reasons for lack of follow up and whether patients were subsequently diagnosed with breast cancer were also assessed  
 2765766150,RESULTS,Of 365 686 patients seen between January 1 2010 and May 31 2015 the trigger identified 2 129 patients with abnormal findings on mammography of whom it flagged 552 as having delays in follow up From these review of 400 randomly selected records revealed 283 true delays positive predictive value 71 95 confidence interval 66 75 including 280 records without any documented plan and three patients with plans that were not adhered to Transcription and reporting inconsistencies were identified in 27 of externally performed mammographic reports Only 335 records 84 contained specific documentation that the patient was informed of the abnormal result  
 2765766150,CONCLUSIONS,Care delays appear to continue despite federal laws requiring patient notification of mammographic results within 30 days Clinical application of mammography related triggers could help detect these delays

 2922474143,BACKGROUND,Leadership is a critical factor for implementing evidence based practice The ILS is a valid and reliable instrument to understand leadership for evidence based practice however this scale or the other similar instrument does not exist in Chinese  
 2922474143,METHODS,We followed the translation and cross cultural validation guideline developed by Sousa and Rojjanasrirat Translation included two forward and blind backward translations and their comparisons Two rounds of cognitive interview were used to evaluate the linguistic validity  
 2922474143,RESULTS,The translation process took 12Â months In the forward and backward translations 24 translation issues were identified of which semantic equivalence issues were most frequent Ten nurses participated in each round of cognitive interviews and 33 linguistic issues were found The final Chinese ILS had seven significant adaptations to the original instrument

 2399296633,OBJECTIVE,In order to identify the tyrosine kinase s that may associate with cell proliferation  
 2399296633,METHODS,GM CSF Epo responsive cell UT 7 and Epo responsive cell UT 7 Epo were used for study of tyrosine phosphorylation  
 2399296633,RESULTS,The addition of GM CSF and or Epo to the responsive cells induced rapid tyrosine phosphorylations of 145000 130000 80000 and 40000 cellular proteins The tyrosine phosphorylated 130000 protein was identified as JAK2 a non receptor tyrosine kinase GM CSF and Epo also activated its tyrosine kinase activity Tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of JAK2 only occurred in GM CSF and or Epo responsive cells  
 2399296633,METHODS_DIFF,GM CSF Epo responsive cell UT 7 and Epo responsive cell UT 7 Epo were used for study of tyrosine phosphorylation
