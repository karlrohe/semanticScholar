 ,OBJECTIVE,Primary IgA nephropathy IgAN is characterized by a highly variable course ranging from a totally benign condition to rapidly progressive renal failure About 30 of children with IgAN will eventually have end stage renal failure after 20 years from onset A nation wide survey was conducted and data of hospitalized children younger than 14 years old with IgAN during the period of 1995 to 2004 were analyzed The aim was to investigate the clinical and pathological characteristics treatment and outcome of the hospitalized children with IgAN  
 ,METHODS,Questionnaires concerning children with IgAN were designed by the Subspecialty Group of Nephrology Chinese Society of Pediatrics and distributed to the doctors of 33 hospitals in China The criterion of IgAN was prominent and diffuse IgA deposition and to a lesser extent other immunoglobulins in the glomerular mesangium and or capillary loops and purpura nephritis lupus nephritis and hepatic disease were excluded The data were collected and analyzed  
 ,RESULTS,From January 1 1995 to December 31 2004 1349 hospitalized children were diagnosed as IgAN The cases of childhood IgAN accounted for 1 37 of the hospitalized cases with urologic kidney diseases and 11 18 of those who underwent renal biopsies Complete records were available for 1203 patients The male to female ratio was 2 07 1 Both the median ages at the disease onset and diagnosis were 9 0 years The median duration from onset to diagnosis of IgAN was 4 months 55 94 of patients had predisposing causes especially infection Recurrent macroscopic hematuria was the most common clinical manifestation 41 15 followed by nephritic syndrome 23 77 and hematuria and proteinuria 20 78 Subclass III 41 40 and II 28 51 were the most common histologic types The main type of immunofluorescence examination was IgA deposition 34 50 The intensity of IgA deposition in patients with hematuria and proteinuria and in acute rapidly progressive nephritis was the strongest There was no unified treatment scheme Some patients were treated with corticosteroids and immunosuppressants and 69 24 of the patients with IgAN showed clinical improvement 10 39 remained unchanged and 2 cases presented deterioration The rate of follow up was 23 35 the mean duration of follow up was 24 4 months
