 2094625255,OBJECTIVES,To investigate changes in abdominal circumference AC and umbilical artery pulsatility index UA PI with gestation in fetuses with isolated gastroschisis and to determine whether a relationship exists between UA PI and fetal AC  
 2094625255,METHODS,Data from 58 pregnancies with isolated gastroschisis diagnosed at between 24 and 36 weeks gestation were included in the study Z scores were calculated with respect to expected UA PI values in normal pregnancies after log transformation AC Z scores were calculated with respect to expected size in normal pregnancies according to a standard chart Functional linear discriminant analysis FLDA was applied to generate 50 th 5 th and 95 th percentile curves for changes in both AC and UA PI with gestational age in fetuses with gastroschisis These curves were compared with the standard curves as were the means UA PI was also plotted against AC For this relationship a robust Spearman correlation coefficient was obtained with FLDA  
 2094625255,RESULTS,In fetuses with gastroschisis there was a highly significant negative correlation between UA PI and AC normalized for gestation using Z scores median correlation coefficient 0 289 median P 0 000023 Moreover compared with standard curves AC was lower and UA PI higher in the gestational age range studied Both the AC and UA PI curves showed a significantly different rate of change with gestation compared with the normal ranges The mean values for fetuses with gastroschisis compared with the standard AC and UA PI range curves were significantly different for AC throughout gestation and for UA PI from 32 weeks gestation  
 2094625255,CONCLUSIONS,In fetal gastroschisis it is well known that AC tends to be smaller though UA PI has not been reported to be abnormal in any consistent way There is a clear relationship between the fetus s AC for gestation and UA PI which is not the case for normally grown fetuses The data suggest that the growth restriction seen in gastroschisis may be explained by hypoxia and not simply by the classical explanation of extra abdominal displacement of the abdominal viscera
