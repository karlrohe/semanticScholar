 579183227,BACKGROUND,In March 2012 the Xpert MTB RIF assay Xpert was introduced in three provincial public hospitals in Indonesia as a novel diagnostic to detect tuberculosis and rifampicin resistance among high risk individuals  
 579183227,OBJECTIVE,This study assessed the effects of using Xpert in place of conventional solid and liquid culture and drug susceptibility testing on case detection rates treatment initiation rates and health system delays among drug resistant tuberculosis TB patients  
 579183227,METHODS,Cohort data on registration test results and treatment initiation were collected from routine presumptive patient registers one year before and one year after Xpert was introduced Proportions of case detection and treatment initiation were compared using the Pearson Chi square test and median time delays using the Mood s Median test  
 579183227,RESULTS,A total of 975 individuals at risk of drug resistant TB were registered in the pre intervention year and 1 442 in the post intervention year After Xpert introduction TB positivity rate increased by 15 while rifampicin resistance rate reduced by 23 among TB positive cases and by 9 among all tested Second line TB treatment initiation rate among rifampicin resistant patients increased by 19 Time from client registration to diagnosis was reduced by 74 days to a median of a single day IQR 0 4 and time from diagnosis to treatment start was reduced by 27 days to a median of 15 days IQR 7 51 All findings were significant with p 0 001

 2143988521,BACKGROUND,The utility of frozen section examination FSE of cone specimens in evaluation of the resection margin status and in ruling out invasion in patients with high grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia requires evaluation  
 2143988521,METHODS,Twenty patients with high grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia who underwent conization biopsy and frozen section examination were studied in a prospective trial from March 2008 through September 2009 The results with permanent paraffin sections were compared with those of FSE  
 2143988521,RESULTS,Among the twenty cases 15 75 had the same results in frozen and permanent sections of cone biopsy specimens Among the other 5 patients 2 had high grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia in frozen sections and 2 showed a lower grade while only one case was found in which the FSE result was CIN3 while the permanent section showed invasive carcinoma which was of clinical importance and considered as significant Paired sample t testing showed no significant difference in the results of the two groups of frozen and permanent sections P 0 716 CI 95

 ,OBJECTIVE,To evaluate the efficacy of recombinant interferon beta IFNbeta 1a in the treatment of ALS  
 ,BACKGROUND,It has been proposed that IFNs affect the progression of ALS by interfering with putative immune mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of the disease  
 ,METHODS,Patients n 61 40 to 70 years of age with a 6 to 24 month history of confirmed ALS with mild to moderate disability received IFNbeta 1a 12 mIU n 31 or placebo n 30 subcutaneously three times a week for 6 months and were followed up for an additional 6 months Patients were assessed after 4 12 24 36 and 48 weeks Medical Research Council scale Norris scale and bulbar scores as well as forced vital capacity were used to assess disability Selected electrophysiologic measures latency amplitude and duration of the compound muscle action potential were also used  
 ,RESULTS,Twenty patients randomized to IFNbeta 1a and 17 patients given placebo completed the study A total of 16 patients receiving IFNbeta 1a became non self supporting compared with 16 on placebo 52 versus 53 There were no significant differences between the two treatment groups for any of the measures of disease progression and disability Deaths were reported in six patients treated with IFNbeta 1a and four patients on placebo Adverse events were reported more frequently with IFNbeta 1a 77 of patients compared with placebo 57 with flu like symptoms and local erythema being the commonest complaints  
 ,CONCLUSIONS,This pilot study suggests that IFNbeta 1a is not effective in the treatment of ALS  
 ,METHODS_DIFF,Patients n 61 40 to 70 years of age with a 6 to 24 month history of confirmed ALS with mild to moderate disability received IFNbeta 1a 12 mIU n 31 or placebo n 30 subcutaneously three times a week for 6 months and were followed up for an additional 6 months Patients were assessed after 4 12 24 36 and 48 weeks Medical Research Council scale Norris scale and bulbar scores as well as forced vital capacity were used to assess disability Selected electrophysiologic measures latency amplitude and duration of the compound muscle action potential were also used
