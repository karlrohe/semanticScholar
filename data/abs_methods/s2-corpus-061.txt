 2990420901,OBJECTIVE,To evaluate the ability for the detection of 5 metal elements in serum in the laboratories of disease prevention and control system  
 2990420901,METHODS,The samples for calcium magnesium iron copper and zinc detection were distributed to 48 laboratories of disease prevention and control system Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry ICP MS analysis or self selected determination method were allowed to use during detection for each laboratory The results were analyzed by robust statistical analysis and Z value was used to evaluate the detection ability  
 2990420901,RESULTS,Of the laboratories involved in the study 40 reported results of metal elements detection Among them 29 laboratories had satisfactory results and 11 laboratories had unsatisfactory or suspicious results The laboratory pass rate of this inter laboratory comparison was60 4

 2051898764,METHODS,Thirty one cases in 29 patients treated at a tertiary referral center from 1980 to 1992 were retrospectively reviewed Iliac and femoral aneurysms were excluded The indication for initial abdominal aortic grafting had been aneurysmal disease in 19 patient and occlusive disease in 10 patients  
 2051898764,RESULTS,There were 25 pseudoaneurysms and six true aneurysms the latter followed grafting for aneurysmal disease The current aneurysm mean size 7 1 cm was at the proximal aortic anastomosis in 27 cases and at the distal aortic anastomosis in two cases Symptoms at presentation included abdominal pain 14 mass 12 claudication 9 back pain 6 and gastrointestinal bleeding 3 Surgical management included interposition tube grafting 16 aortoiliofemoral bypass 9 and graft removal with extraanatomic bypass 3 The overall operative morbidity rate was 73 and mortality rate was 21  
 2051898764,CONCLUSIONS,Paraanastomotic aortic aneurysms are being increasingly recognized and are associated with high morbidity and mortality rates Patients should be periodically studied after aortic grafting with abdominal ultrasonography for early detection of this potentially serious complication Elective surgical repair is advocated in the effort to minimize morbidity rates
