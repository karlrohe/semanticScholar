 1965990210,BACKGROUND,In the last 10 years trauma critical care has become less attractive because of the decreasing surgical caseload the nocturnal work hours and the economics of the practice Nevertheless during the same period the number of verified trauma centers has significantly increased This study assesses the economic drive behind this dichotomy  
 1965990210,METHODS,Over a 1 year period we collected financial data on 1 907 trauma patients for both Level I trauma centers and trauma critical care surgeons Financial data including payor source cost reimbursement margin and reimbursement to charge and reimbursement to direct cost ratios were calculated  
 1965990210,RESULTS,For commercial and government insured patients the reimbursement to direct cost ratio was 2 and 35 fold greater respectively for the trauma centers than for the trauma critical care surgeons For uninsured patients the addition of local government funds allowed the trauma center to cover direct cost with no margin In contrast even with the addition of supplemental salary dollars from the institution for every dollar in direct cost generated by the trauma critical care surgeons in caring for uninsured patients they recovered 55 cents or a loss of 45 cents per direct cost dollar spent  
 1965990210,METHODS_DIFF,Over a 1 year period we collected financial data on 1 907 trauma patients for both Level I trauma centers and trauma critical care surgeons Financial data including payor source cost reimbursement margin and reimbursement to charge and reimbursement to direct cost ratios were calculated  

 2160382239,BACKGROUND,Depression is the most common psychiatric disorder in geriatrics and oncology For elderly cancer patients it has a significant impact on quality of life morbidity and mortality Nevertheless depression is under diagnosed and under treated Cancer management is key in improving the quality of care in this population We aim to identify sociodemographic clinical and treatment related factors of depression in elderly patients during chemotherapy thus allowing early detection of patients in need of specific treatment Further we investigate whether chemotherapy efficacy and safety are associated with depression  
 2160382239,PATIENTS AND METHODS,A prospective multicenter cohort composed of incident cases of cancer diagnosed in patients 70 years and older receiving first line chemotherapy Depressive symptoms were measured by the Geriatric Depression Scale at baseline and after four chemotherapy cycles Associations between depressive symptoms during chemotherapy and patients clinical and treatment characteristics were identified by logistic regression  
 2160382239,RESULTS,Among 344 patients measured for depression before chemotherapy 260 had a second assessment at the fourth treatment cycle At baseline 45 4 were depressed and 44 6 were depressed after the fourth cycle Independent factors of depression were depressive symptoms at baseline odds ratio OR    6 7 p   0 001 malnutrition OR   5 1 p   0 014 and risk of malnutrition OR   1 6 p   0 014 After controlling for missing data effective chemotherapy was associated with a lower risk of depression OR   0 4 p   0 018  

 1986492844,BACKGROUND,The liberalization of marijuana laws has led to concerns that such changes will increase drugged driving and crash related mortality California decriminalized marijuana effective January 1 2011 we examine the impact of this change on marijuana involved driving  
 1986492844,METHODS,We used laboratory testing from roadside surveys and the Fatality Analysis Reporting System FARS to assess impacts on weekend nighttime drivers and fatally injured drivers respectively We calculated marijuana prevalence measured by laboratory confirmed delta 9 tetrahydrocannabinol THC in roadside surveys and cannabinoids in FARS and compared corresponding 95 confidence intervals CI to identify statistically significant changes post decriminalization We also conducted multiple logistic regression analyses to determine whether the odds of marijuana involved driving increased significantly after controlling for potential confounders  
 1986492844,RESULTS,There was no statistically significant change in the prevalence of THC positive driving among weekend nighttime drivers n 894 in 2012 9 2 95 CI 6 3 12 2 compared to 2010 11 3 95 CI 8 5 14 0 or in the adjusted odds of testing positive for THC adjusted odds ratio AOR 0 96 95 CI 0 57 1 60 In contrast we found a statistically significant increase in the prevalence of cannabinoids among fatally injured drivers in 2012 17 8 95 CI 14 6 20 9 compared to the pre decriminalization period 2008 2010 11 8 95 CI 10 3 13 3 The adjusted odds of testing positive for cannabinoids were also significantly higher in 2012 AOR 1 67 95 CI 1 28 2 18  
 1986492844,CONCLUSIONS,Our study generated discrepant findings regarding the impact of decriminalization on marijuana involved driving in California Factors that may have contributed to these findings particularly methodological factors are discussed
