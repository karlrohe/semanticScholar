 ,OBJECTIVE,Delayed afterdepolarization induced triggered activity originating in ventricular myocardium is a mechanism for some age dependent inherited ventricular tachycardias in a colony of German shepherd dogs  
 ,METHODS,We used standard microelectrode techniques to study beta adrenergic receptor subtype modulation of the triggered activity in anteroseptal left ventricular myocardium from eleven of these dogs and seven unafflicted age matched German shepherd controls  
 ,RESULTS,During sustained stimulation at cycle lengths of 300 4000 ms 10 9 10 7 M isoproterenol concentration dependently shortened action potential duration APD to 90 repolarization more in myocardium from afflicted than from unafflicted dogs This shortening was prevented by a beta 1 blocker CGP20712A 10 7 M while a beta 2 blocker ICI118551 10 7 M did not modify the effect of isoproterenol in either group The beta 2 agonist zinterol 10 8 10 6 M had no effect on APD Stimulation at a cycle length of 250 ms in the presence of 10 7 M isoproterenol induced more triggered AP in myocardium from afflicted than unafflicted dogs beta 1 Blockade completely eliminated while beta 2 blockade facilitated and the beta 2 agonist zinterol did not induce triggered activity in the two groups

 2803354255,PATIENTS METHODS,Molecular clinicopathological and survival data in Cancer Genome Atlas Lung Cancer were obtained for secondary analysis  
 2803354255,RESULTS,LDHA expression was significantly upregulated in both LUAD and LUSC compared with normal lung tissues LUSC tissues had even higher LDHA expression compared with LUAD tissues Increased LDHA expression was an independent prognostic indicator in terms of overall survival hazard ratio 1 547 95 CI 1 253 1 911 p   0 001 and recurrence free survival hazard ratio 1 486 95 CI 1 161 1 900 p   0 002 in LUAD but not in LUSC  

 1224690899,OBJECTIVES,Limited information is available about the characteristics of patients with active inflammatory rheumatic diseases who start TNF α antagonist therapy Our objective was to assess TNF α antagonist prescription patterns in this context in France  
 1224690899,METHODS,Between 2007 and 2009 102 rheumatologists internists and pediatricians in French university hospitals and private practice prospectively recruited biologics naïve patients with active rheumatoid arthritis RA DAS28 3 2 despite methotrexate therapy spondyloarthritis SA BASDAI 4 despite non steroidal anti inflammatory drug NSAID use and juvenile idiopathic arthritis JIA unresponsive to methotrexate Patients were monitored prospectively for 1 year  
 1224690899,RESULTS,Of the 543 RA 287 SA and 53 JIA patients included in the study 382 RA 171 SA and 28 JIA patients had complete follow up data available after 1 year Among these patients 110 382 28 8 with RA 81 171 47 4 with SA and 26 28 92 9 with JIA received at least one TNF α antagonist dose during the 1 year follow up The main physician reported reason for not starting TNF α antagonists in patients with RA or SA was low disease activity 72 for RA and 67 for SA absence of TNF α antagonist therapy was due to patient refusal in only 10 and to contraindications in 6 to 7 of cases  
 1224690899,CONCLUSIONS,In France TNF α antagonists which are fully reimbursed by the national health insurance system were used almost routinely in JIA patients unresponsive to methotrexate and were given to about half the SA patients with BASDAI 4 despite NSAID use and a third of RA patients with DAS28 3 2 despite methotrexate therapy

 1977367300,OBJECTIVE,To examine what tests are ordered by physicians for pheochromocytoma diagnosis and how those tests perform in modern clinical practice  
 1977367300,METHODS,In this case series electronic medical records of patients seen between January 2000 and July 2008 at a large academic hospital in Los Angeles California were queried and patients older than 15 years who underwent any 1 of 5 tests for pheochromocytoma measurement of plasma catecholamines plasma fractionated metanephrines urinary catecholamines urinary metanephrines or urinary vanillylmandelic acid were identified Because testing was performed in various reference laboratories test results were classified into 1 of 3 categories a markedly elevated b moderately elevated or c normal Patient demographics clinical history test results imaging study findings and pathology records were reviewed  
 1977367300,RESULTS,A total of 3980 tests were ordered for 1898 patients Pretest probability was 2 2 based on 681 patients in whom pheochromocytoma was confirmed or excluded and hypertension was the most common indication for testing The number of patients tested and the number of tests ordered increased over the years The ordering pattern stabilized since 2006 when urinary metanephrines urinary catecholamines and plasma metanephrines were ordered more frequently Sensitivity was highest for urinary metanephrines and vanillylmandelic acid specificity was highest for vanillylmandelic acid and urinary catecholamines and positive likelihood ratio was highest for vanillylmandelic acid Positive predictive value for markedly elevated test results was 39 to 83 while that for moderately elevated test results was only 2 to 14  
 1977367300,CONCLUSIONS,Ordering pattern and test performance differ significantly from those recommended and reported by large centers The best testing strategy should incorporate local experience Categorizing test results as markedly elevated moderately elevated and normal is important for result interpretation

 2076765423,STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS,A phenomenological study exploring the lived experiences of 10 women aged 25 to 49 years with a history of GDM in the last 5 years Data were collected through two semistructured short interviews that were conducted in person or by telephone  
 2076765423,RESULTS,Five themes emerged Authentic emotion Judgment It s only a matter of time I can t do this alone and Missed opportunities Strong emotions were experienced at the time of diagnosis Some women felt judged by healthcare professionals and others based on having GDM Some were concerned about future risk of developing Type 2 DM There is a lack of understanding of GDM by women at the time of diagnosis and after they give birth The majority of women in this study noted that healthcare professionals did not discuss future implications of Type 2 DM and the need for follow up glucose testing Many opportunities are missed to provide education and support to facilitate lifestyle interventions
