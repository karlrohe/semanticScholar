 2161703387,OBJECTIVE,Iron therapy may reinforce intestinal inflammation by catalysing production of reactive oxygen species The effects of oral ferrous fumarate and intravenous iron sucrose on clinical disease activity and plasma redox status were investigated in patients with inflammatory bowel disease IBD  
 2161703387,MATERIAL AND METHODS,Nineteen patients with iron deficiency anaemia and Crohn s disease 11 or ulcerative colitis 8 were included in a crossover study The patients were randomly assigned to start treatment with ferrous fumarate Neo fer 120 mg orally once daily or iron sucrose Venofer 200 mg intravenously 3 times during a period of 14 days Clinical disease activity assessment and blood and faecal analysis were performed on days 1 and 15  
 2161703387,RESULTS,Following oral ferrous fumarate clinical disease activity p 0 037 general well being score i e patients felt worse p 0 027 and abdominal pain score p 0 027 increased while no changes were seen following iron sucrose treatment C reactive protein CRP and faecal calprotectin were unchanged after both treatments As compared with iron sucrose ferrous fumarate increased Crohn s disease activity index CDAI scores of general well being p 0 049 whereas alterations in clinical disease activity p 0 14 and abdominal pain score p 0 20 did not differ Ferrous fumarate did not significantly alter plasma malondialdehyde MDA or plasma antioxidants Iron sucrose increased plasma MDA p 0 004 and decreased plasma vitamin C p 0 017 and betacarotene p 0 008  
 2161703387,CONCLUSIONS,Oral ferrous fumarate but not intravenous iron sucrose increased clinical disease activity in IBD patients Intravenous iron sucrose increased intravascular oxidative stress  

 2531929429,BACKGROUND,Inflammation besed prognostic score including neutrophil lymphocyte ratio NLR platelet lymphocyte ratio PLR modified Glasgow prognostic score mGPS and prognostic nutritional index PNI have prognostic value in various malignancies  
 2531929429,PATIENTS AND METHODS,We retrospectively investigated their prognostic value in 213 patients with living donor liver transplantation LDLT for hepatocellular carcinoma HCC Disease free survival DFS following LDLT was calculated NLR PLR PNI and mGPS values in patients with and without recurrence were compared Risk factors for HCC recurrence were identified by univariate and multivariate analyses  
 2531929429,RESULTS,Both NLR and PLR were significantly increased in patients with recurrence Multivariate analysis showed that des gamma carboxy prothrombin DCP 300 mAU ml NLR 2 66 3 months between last HCC treatment to LDLT were independent predictors of DFS
