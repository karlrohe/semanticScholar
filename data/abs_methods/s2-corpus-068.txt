 1989411838,OBJECTIVE,Shunting of the microcirculation contributes to the pathology of sepsis and septic shock The authors address the hypothesis that shunting of the microcirculation occurs after superior mesenteric artery occlusion SMAO and reperfusion and explore functional consequences  
 1989411838,METHODS,Spontaneously breathing animals rats n 30 underwent SMAO for 0 controls 30 SMAO 30 or 60 min SMAO 60 followed by reperfusion 4 h with normal saline Leukocyte endothelial interactions in mesenteric venules were quantified in an exteriorized ileal loop using intravital microscopy Abdominal blood flow was recorded continuously and arterial blood gases were analyzed at intervals The above groups were matched by comparable groups with continuous superior mesenteric artery blood flow measurements and without exteriorizing an ileal loop controls SMAO 30 SMAO 60  
 1989411838,RESULTS,Adherent leukocytes increased shortly after reperfusion in ischemia groups and plateaued in these groups Centerline velocity in the recorded venules was significantly reduced after reperfusion down to low flow no flow in SMAO 60 as compared to SMAO 30 and controls whereas perfusion of the SMA and ileal vessels persisted The microcirculatory changes in SMAO 60 were accompanied by progressive metabolic acidosis substantially larger volumes of intravenous fluids needed to support arterial blood pressure and significantly reduced survival 30 SMA blood flow increased in relation to abdominal blood flow after reperfusion in SMAO 60 and remained constant in SMAO 30 and controls Survival was 80 in SMAO 60
