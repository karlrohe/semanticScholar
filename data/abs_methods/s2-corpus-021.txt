 1021910328,OBJECTIVE,Previous pathologic and roentgenographic studies have suggested a relation between aortic plaque and coronary artery disease but have lacked clinical utility The study was undertaken to elucidate whether atherosclerotic aortic plaque detected by transesophageal echocardiography can be a clinically useful marker for significant obstructive coronary artery disease  
 1021910328,METHODS,Clinical and angiographic features and intraoperative transesophageal echocardiographic findings were prospectively analyzed in 131 consecutive patients 58 women and 73 men aged 17 to 75 years mean 54 12 undergoing open heart surgery Significant obstructive coronary artery disease was defined as or 50 stenosis of or 1 major branch  
 1021910328,RESULTS,Seventy six 58 of 131 patients were found to have obstructive coronary artery disease In 76 patients with significant coronary artery disease 71 had thoracic aortic plaque In contrast aortic plaque existed in only 10 of the remaining 55 patients with normal or minimally abnormal coronary arteries The presence of aortic plaque on transesophageal echocardiographic studies had a sensitivity of 93 a specificity of 82 and positive and negative predictive values of 88 and 90 respectively for significant coronary artery disease There was a significant relationship between the degree of aortic intimal changes and the severity of coronary artery disease r 0 74 P 0 0001 Multivariate logistic regression analysis of patient age sex risk factors of cardiovascular disease and transesophageal echocardiographic findings revealed that atherosclerotic aortic plaque was the most significant independent predictor of coronary artery disease

 1984561647,OBJECTIVE,Proinflammatory cytokines of placental or systemic origin are thought to play a central role in the pathophysiology of preeclampsia We sought to estimate the fractional excretion of tumor necrosis factor TNF alpha in relationship to proteinuria in women with severe preeclampsia  
 1984561647,METHODS,In a cross sectional study we evaluated the serum and urine levels of TNF alpha in 45 women diagnosed with severe preeclampsia mean standard error of the mean gestational age 29 1 0 5 weeks Forty five healthy pregnant women matched for parity maternal age and gestational age at recruitment 30 1 0 4 weeks made up the control group Urinary concentrations were normalized to creatinine The fractional excretion of TNF alpha was interpreted in relationship to that of total proteins and soluble fms like tyrosine kinase 1 sFlt 1  
 1984561647,RESULTS,We found that the women with preeclampsia had significantly higher serum TNF alpha concentrations compared with the women in the control group mean standard error of the mean preeclampsia 1 39 0 09 versus control 0 93 0 07 pg mL P 001 In contrast urinary levels of TNF alpha were significantly decreased in the women with preeclampsia compared with the healthy women median interquartile range preeclampsia 0 26 0 10 0 91 versus control 0 58 0 21 1 29 pg mg creatinine P 003 even though the hypertensive women had higher levels of proteinuria In contrast to sFlt 1 urinary TNF alpha did not correlate with the degree of proteinuria Additionally in preeclampsia the fractional excretion of TNF alpha was significantly lower preeclampsia 1 92 0 46 4 20 versus control 7 2 2 44 12 07 P 001
