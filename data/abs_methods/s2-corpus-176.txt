 2089978549,OBJECTIVE,Rheumatoid arthritis RA associated HLA class II genes are assumed to promote susceptibility to and or progression of the disease Among the various modes of action proposed so far is the effect of the differential expression of HLA class II genes in different types of antigen presenting cells on the Th1 Th2 balance The aim of this study was to investigate the differential expression of genes encoded within the RA associated HLA DR4 superhaplotype and within the neutral DR7 and DR9 superhaplotypes  
 2089978549,METHODS,The promoters encoded within these 3 haplotypes were first analyzed for sequence polymorphisms To test for functional consequences we assumed that the binding of nuclear factors to the promoter elements was correlated with the transcription activity and we used surface plasmon resonance technology To that end oligonucleotides representing the polymorphic regulatory sequences and nuclear extracts from a monocyte cell line and a B cell line were used  
 2089978549,RESULTS,While the promoters of the highly polymorphic HLA DRB1 04 07 and 09 alleles showed comparable binding of nuclear factors differential binding was observed for the 2 promoters that drive the relatively nonpolymorphic DRB4 alleles in linkage disequilibrium with DRB1 Interestingly analysis of RA patients positive for DR4 DR7 and DR9 revealed the segregation of radiographic progression with the stronger of the 2 DRB4 promoters independent of the DRB1 allele Moreover DRB1 04 alleles in RA patients showed a reduced association with the DRB4 splice variant completely preventing DRB4 expression

 2068300387,OBJECTIVE,To investigate the influence of glycemic variability on the HbA1c level in elderly male patients with type 2 diabetes T2DM  
 2068300387,METHODS,The 24 h glucose profiles were obtained using a continuous glucose monitoring system in 291 elderly male type 2 diabetic patients The relationship between the glycemic variability and HbA1c level was assessed in these patients  
 2068300387,RESULTS,The mean amplitude of glycemic excursions MAGE in patients with HbA1c 7 0 was significantly higher than in patients with HbA1c 7 0 4 33 1 67 vs 3 48 1 46 mmol L p 0 001 A simple Pearson s correlation analysis indicated that the MAGE was significantly correlated with the HbA1c r 0 229 p 0 001 Compared with the lowest quartile the highest quartile of the MAGE was associated with a significantly increased risk of having a HbA1c 7 0 after multiple adjustments p for trend 0 001

 2566056509,METHODS,Gastric cancer patients with macroscopic peritoneal metastasis were implanted with peritoneal access ports and received combination chemotherapy of S 1 plus IV and IP PTX PTX was administered IV at 50 mg m2 and IP at 20 mg m2 on days 1 and 8 S 1 was administered at 80 mg m2 day for 14 consecutive days followed by 7 days rest Radical gastrectomy was performed when macroscopic curative resection was made achievable after the chemotherapy Efficacy and safety were evaluated in all the patients  
 2566056509,RESULTS,Between February 2005 and January 2011 100 patients with peritoneal metastasis were treated including 80 with primary tumors 10 after palliative gastrectomy and 10 with peritoneal recurrence The median number of courses was 8 range 1 48 The median survival time MST was 22 6 months 95 CI 17 9 28 9 months The MSTs of subgroups were as follows Metastasis to the adjacent peritoneum 49 6 months n 10 metastases to the distant peritoneum 19 7 months n 90 Ascites negative 39 3 months n 29 ascites positive 19 0 months n 71 With primary tumors 20 6 months n 80 after palliative gastrectomy 49 6 months n 10 with peritoneal recurrence 22 6 months n 10 Out of 80 patients with primary tumors 37 patients underwent gastrectomy after response to chemotherapy and had a MST of 34 9 months The frequent grade 3 4 toxic effects included neutropenia 36 leukopenia 20 and anemia 8 Infection and obstruction of peritoneal access device were observed in 7 and 6 patients respectively There were no treatment related deaths  
 2566056509,CONCLUSIONS,Combination chemotherapy of S 1 plus IV and IP PTX is well tolerated and active in gastric cancer patients with peritoneal metastasis
