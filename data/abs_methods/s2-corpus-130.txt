 2906351026,BACKGROUND,Zika virus ZIKV has recently re emerged as a pathogenic agent with epidemic capacities as was well illustrated in South America Because of the extent of this health crisis a number of more serious symptoms have become associated with ZIKV infection than what was initially described In particular neuronal and ocular disorders have been characterized both in infants and in adults Notably the macula and the retina can be strongly affected by ZIKV possibly by a direct effect of the virus This is supported by the detection of replicative and infectious virus in lachrimal fluid in human patients and mouse models  
 2906351026,METHODS,Here we used an innovative state of the art iPSC derived human retinal pigment epithelium RPE model to study ZIKV retinal impairment

 2160331104,BACKGROUND,In osteosarcoma the histological response measured by the percentage of tumor necrosis constitutes one of the most significant predictive factors with better survival in patients whose tumor necrosis is or 90  
 2160331104,OBJECTIVES,To determine if the decrease rate of serum alkaline phosphatase SAP levels during the first month of neoadjuvant chemotherapy could serve as a predictive indicator of tumor necrosis and clinical outcome  
 2160331104,METHODS,We analyzed the medical files of 53 osteosarcoma patients 19 females 34 males median age 16 years range 8 24 the disease was metastatic in 12 and localized in the other 41  
 2160331104,RESULTS,The histological responses were good in 38 patients 71 7 and poor in 15 28 3 At a median follow up of 50 months 34 patients 64 2 had no evidence of disease and 19 35 8 had died from the disease High levels of SAP at diagnosis correlated with worse survival P 0 002 There was no difference in overall survival between patients whose SAP decrease rate was 25 and those with a rate 25 P 0 14 Among female patients rapid SAP responders had better survival than slow responders P 0 026 In patients with metastases the SAP decrease rate was positively correlated with survival P 0 042  
 2160331104,CONCLUSIONS,There was no evidence that rapid SAP responders had a higher percentage of tumor necrosis than slow responders although female rapid SAP responders had a better prognosis than slow responders Patients with metastases at presentation and rapid SAP response had better prognoses
