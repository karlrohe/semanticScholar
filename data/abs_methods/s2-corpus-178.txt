 2158549846,RESULTS,â€‚ Serum insulin peaked at 60 min in all conditions and was lowest after 25 insulin dose compared with full dose P 0 03 After the 25 insulin dose immediately pre exercise glucose concentration was higher than after the full or 50 dose P 0 05 Resting beta hydroxybutyrate gradually decreased during 2 h rest P 0 05 with a similar post exercise peak of beta hydroxybutyrate at 3 h P 0 05 Post exercise blood pH increased for 5 min to a similar extent with all insulin doses but the rise with the 25 dose was less compared with the full dose P 0 01 Blood lactate and plasma catecholamines increased after running similarly with all insulin reduction conditions P 0 05 Blood glucose area under the curve BG auc after the 25 insulin dose was greater than after the 75 dose P 0 02

 1941718541,BACKGROUND,Chronic intestinal pseudo obstruction is a disabling condition for which there are no established drug therapies The condition is caused by a diverse range of intestinal myopathies and neuropathies  
 1941718541,METHODS,Double blind randomised placebo controlled cross over trial of four 12 week treatment periods with 2 4 mg prucalopride or placebo daily In each of the first and second 6 months there was a prucalopride and a placebo treatment Patients with proven chronic intestinal pseudo obstruction including dilated gut were included Evaluation was by patient diary and global evaluation  
 1941718541,RESULTS,Seven patients participated mean 42 years five female median symptom duration 11 years Three discontinued two due to study length and one on prucalopride due to unrelated malnutrition and bronchopneumonia Four patients three visceral myopathy and one visceral neuropathy completed the study prucalopride significantly improved pain in three of four patients nausea in two vomiting in one bloating in four and analgesic intake Bowel function was not changed substantially  
 1941718541,CONCLUSIONS,n 1 studies in rare conditions allow drug efficacy assessment Prucalopride relieves symptoms in selected patients with chronic pseudo obstruction  
 1941718541,METHODS_DIFF,Double blind randomised placebo controlled cross over trial of four 12 week treatment periods with 2 4 mg prucalopride or placebo daily In each of the first and second 6 months there was a prucalopride and a placebo treatment Patients with proven chronic intestinal pseudo obstruction including dilated gut were included Evaluation was by patient diary and global evaluation
