 2404646238,OBJECTIVES,1 To describe well baby care in Connecticut s Medicaid managed care program 2 to determine the effect of well baby care on emergency care or hospitalization for ambulatory care sensitive conditions  
 2404646238,METHODS,Babies born between January 1 and March 31 2000 who were continuously enrolled for the first year of life were identified n 2 054 Encounter data were searched for timely well baby visits and for emergency care or hospitalization for selected conditions  
 2404646238,RESULTS,Thirty four percent of infants received five or more timely visits during the first year of life African American and Hispanic babies were less likely than white babies to have had all the recommended care OR 0 49 95 CI 0 37 0 63 OR 0 53 95 CI 0 41 0 69 respectively Being up to date with well baby care was not associated with a reduced likelihood of emergency care OR 0 89 95 CI 0 72 1 09 or hospitalization OR 1 23 95 CI 0 83 1 34

 2024999789,BACKGROUND,To date few postmarketing studies have addressed whether long term prophylactic treatment with second generation antidepressants ADs delays depressive episodes in patients with bipolar disorder  
 2024999789,OBJECTIVE,The aim of this study was to compare the risk of depressive relapse between patients with bipolar disorder who took second generation ADs 6 months after depressive remission with those who discontinued AD use early  
 2024999789,METHODS,Using a large US managed care claims database continuously enrolled bipolar subjects who took second generation ADs after a depressive remission were identified between January 1 1998 and December 31 2002 Duration of AD and concurrent mood stabilizer use were based on coded diagnoses and pharmacy records A Cox proportional hazards model was developed to predict time from depressive remission to next depressive relapse with continuous AD use categorized as either or 6 months or 6 months Propensity scoring with greedy matching was used to help balance the observed background covariates and baseline disease severity between groups  
 2024999789,RESULTS,Five hundred eighty nine subjects met the inclusion criteria A Kaplan Meer estimate found that the median depressive relapse times for the continuous ie or 6 months and early discontinuation ie 6 months AD treatment groups were 16 5 and 6 8 months respectively P 0 05 The Cox proportional hazards model with propensity score matching identified a significantly lower risk of depressive relapse over a 2 year period among those who continued AD treatment or 6 months after remission compared with those who discontinued treatment within 6 months hazard ratio 0 61 95 CI 0 42 0 88 continuous vs early discontinuation P 0 01  
 2024999789,CONCLUSIONS,Continuous second generation AD therapy for or 6 months after depressive remission was associated with a lower risk of depressive relapse over a 2 year period in patients with bipolar depression Given concerns regarding the risk of AD users with bipolar disorder switching to mania an optimal prophylactic treatment after depressive remission should balance the risks between manic switching and depressive relapse
