 2281723243,OBJECTIVES,We investigated the association between recent HIV testing and safer sex among clients of a publicly funded sexually transmitted disease STD clinic  
 2281723243,METHODS,Of 401 men and women who were anonymously assessed on sexual risk HIV testing STD history motivations for behavior change and exposure to HIV prevention education we studied 292 sexually active respondents who reported previous testing for HIV Outcome measures included condom use at last intercourse and frequent at least most of the time condom use during the past 3 months Logistic regression was used to examine the association between each outcome and length of time since HIV testing controlling for other putative predictors of condom use  
 2281723243,RESULTS,The sample consisted mainly of African American 79 heterosexual 95 men and women almost half 44 of whom were less than 26 years old Regression analyses indicated that recent HIV testing was significantly associated with safer sex Prevalence of condom use at last intercourse was highest among respondents who received an HIV test 3 months before the survey whereas frequent condom use during the past 3 months peaked among clients who had been tested 3 to 5 months before assessment  
 2281723243,CONCLUSIONS,The occurrence of a brief surge in safer sex among recent HIV counseling and testing clients regardless of serostatus suggests that these individuals may be particularly amenable to additional interventions designed to achieve longer term reductions in risky behaviors

 1634416457,BACKGROUND,The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of a phosphodiesterase inhibitor pentoxifylline PTX electromagnetic fields EMFs and a mixture of both materials on bone fracture healing in a rat model  
 1634416457,MATERIALS AND METHODS,Eighty male Wistar rats were randomly divided into four groups Group A femur fracture model with no treatment Group B femur fracture model treated with PTX 50 mg kg day intraperitoneal injection Group C femur fracture model treated with EMF 1 5 0 2 Mt 50 Hz 6 hours day and Group D femur fracture model treated with PTX 50 mg kg day intraperitoneal injection and EMF 1 5 0 2 Mt 50 Hz 6 hours day  
 1634416457,RESULTS,Bone fracture healing was significantly better in Group B and Group C compared to Group A P 0 05 but Group D did not show better bone fracture healing than Group A P 0 05  

 1989690000,BACKGROUND,Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea is a leading cause of hospital acquired diarrhea We sought to determine whether the institution of a hospital wide alcohol based hand rub ABHR policy was associated with an increase in the incidence and or severity of health care facility onset health care facility associated C difficile diarrhea CDAD  
 1989690000,METHODS,We used a retrospective chart review analysis to compare incidence rates of CDAD before and after implementation of the ABHR policy We also compared rates of sepsis colectomy and death in patients with CDAD before and after implementation of the ABHR policy  
 1989690000,RESULTS,The incidence rate of CDAD was 3 98 per 10 000 patient days after implementation of the ABHR policy compared with 4 96 per 10 000 patient days before implementation P 0036 The crude mortality rate in patients diagnosed with CDAD was 10 7 after implementation compared with 13 3 before implementation P 275 The rate of sepsis in patients diagnosed with CDAD was 19 6 after implementation compared with 5 2 before implementation P 0001  
 1989690000,METHODS_DIFF,We used a retrospective chart review analysis to compare incidence rates of CDAD before and after implementation of the ABHR policy We also compared rates of sepsis colectomy and death in patients with CDAD before and after implementation of the ABHR policy
