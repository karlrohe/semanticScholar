 2621317635,METHODS,The study included highly myopic individuals who were consecutively examined between May 2014 and December 2015 The patients underwent swept source optical coherence tomography OCT for visualization of DSM and MBMDs defined as Bruch s membrane defects located at a distance of maximal 1500 μm from the foveola  
 2621317635,RESULTS,Out of 1983 highly myopic eyes 1057 patients 166 eyes 8 4 95 confidence interval CI 7 2 9 6 showed a DSM and 534 eyes showed a MBMD In multivariate binary regression analysis higher prevalence of DSM was associated with a higher prevalence of a MBMD P 0 001 OR 1 96 95 CI 1 40 2 75 after adjusting for longer axial length P 0 001 odds ratio OR 1 27 95 CI 1 16 1 38 In eyes with a DSM partially surrounded by a MBMD the retina retinal pigment epithelium RPE and choroid appeared relatively unchanged in the central region with Bruch s membrane BM preserved In the ring like BM free region surrounding the central prominent island of the DSM the RPE the outer and middle retinal layers the choriocapillaris and the middle sized choroidal vessel layer were absent In association with a DSM three MBMD types were differentiated MBMDs in patchy chorioretinal atrophy MBMDs in choroidal neovascularization related macular atrophy and MBMDs as temporally extending large parapapillary gamma zone  
 2621317635,CONCLUSIONS,Presence of a DSM was significantly associated with the presence of MBMDs The morphology of the DSM in association with MBMDs may be associated with a focal relaxation of the posterior sclera no longer pushed outward by an expanding BM but allowed to partially bulge inward leading to the formation of a DSM
