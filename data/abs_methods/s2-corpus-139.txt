 2200635409,MATERIAL AND METHODS,Fifteen patients were carried out surgery Perforator identification and the relationship between SCIA deep circumflex iliac artery DCIA and superficial inferior epigastric artery SIEA were performed preoperatively and intra operatively  
 2200635409,RESULTS,The relationship between SCIA DCIA and SIEA was depicted and subdivided into type 1 8 15 type 2 2 15 type 3 2 15 type 4 2 15 and type 5 1 15 Surgical procedures and SCIP flap anatomy were described 14 15 of the SCIP flaps survived and one with necrosis  
 2200635409,CONCLUSIONS,The SCIP flap is a reliable thin and pliable flap with hidden donor site morbidity for oral maxillofacial reconstruction CTA and CDS are valuable methods for preoperative assessment of the perforator s location and type  

 2615709610,OBJECTIVE,To evaluate the personal fracture treatment and complication characteristics among patients with pediatric femoral shaft fractures attended at the pediatric orthopedic service of the Joana de Gusmão Children s Hospital  
 2615709610,METHODS,This was a retrospective cross sectional study on a population consisting of patients with femoral shaft fractures aged between birth and 14 years and 11 months who were divided into four age groups Information was obtained from medical records and was transferred to a survey questionnaire to present personal fracture treatment and complication variables  
 2615709610,RESULTS,The study population consisted of 96 patients Their mean age was 6 8 years The cases were predominantly among males comprising closed fractures on the right side in the middle third with a single line Regarding fracture etiology traffic accidents predominated overall in the sample Most of the patients 74 to 77 1 presented femoral fractures as their only injury Conservative treatment predominated in the group younger than six years of age and surgical treatment in the group aged 6 to 14 years and 11 months The complications observed until bone union were discrepancy infection and movement limitation The mean time taken for consolidation was 9 6 2 4 weeks varying with age

 2919638127,METHODS,Patients with myopia or myopic astigmatism of similar magnitude in both eyes with a spherical equivalent less than or equal to 10 0 diopters D preoperative corrected distance visual acuity CDVA of 0 80 decimal or better and anisometropia less than or equal to 2 0 D were enrolled and followed for 3 months One eye of each patient was treated with interface flushing after dry extraction of the lenticule Flushing was performed with 1 0 cc balanced salt solution using a single use 27 gauge cannula The uncorrected distance visual acuity UDVA at 1 day 1 week and 3 months the CDVA at 3 months and postoperative differences at the slitlamp examination were recorded Statistical analyses were performed with logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution values using paired t tests The P value for significance was less than 0 05  
 2919638127,RESULTS,The study analyzed 470 eyes One day postoperatively the mean UDVA was 0 81 in the non flush group and 0 83 in the flush group P    110 At the last visit 3 months postoperatively the mean UDVA was 1 04 and 1 05 respectively P    172 No significant differences in the rate of postoperative complications were found

 1828773249,OBJECTIVE,To describe categorize and determine the outcomes of repairs of genitourinary GU injuries that occur during colorectal surgery Presently little is known regarding these injuries or the long term outcomes of their repair  
 1828773249,METHODS,We performed a retrospective review of patients undergoing colorectal surgery between 2003 and 2013 who experienced iatrogenic GU injuries requiring surgical repair GU repair failures were defined as development of urine leak urinary fistula or anastomotic stricture requiring secondary GU intervention Possible risk factors associated with repair failures were examined and included age American Society of Anesthesiology score comorbidities type of colorectal surgery radiation and chemotherapy  
 1828773249,RESULTS,Of 42 570 colorectal surgeries performed 75 GU injuries were identified 0 18 Mean age was 57 5 years range 22 91 and median follow up was 19 5 months range 1 128 Fifty nine 59 75 79 patients required a single GU repair whereas 16 of 75 21 patients experienced repair failure requiring additional GU intervention The most common GU injuries were cystotomy 26 75 35 incomplete ureteral transection 22 75 29 complete proximal and distal ureteral injuries 13 75 17 11 75 15 urethral injury 2 75 3 and injury to a pre existing ileal conduit 1 75 1 Twenty seven patients 36 had prior radiation and 35 patients 47 had prior chemotherapy Preoperative radiation and chemotherapy were both associated with failure of the GU repair P    003 P    013 Delayed repair of the GU injury was also associated with repair failure P    001
