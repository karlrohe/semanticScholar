 2009879282,BACKGROUND,Atrial fibrillation AF is thought to be sustained by multiple reentrant wavelets or firing foci  
 2009879282,OBJECTIVE,The aim of this study was to compare the spectral domain characteristics in the left atrium LA and right atrium RA in two different models of AF  
 2009879282,METHODS,Rectangular 8 x 14 electrode arrays were placed on the LA and RA of 14 anesthetized dogs AF episodes were induced with burst pacing and aconitine in each dog For each model AF was induced from the RA in six dogs and from the LA in six dogs Dominant frequencies DFs were obtained using the fast Fourier transform of the unipolar recordings obtained from each electrode of the array Standard deviation SD was used to compute the frequency dispersion within an atrium Regularity of the signal was quantified using an organization index OI  
 2009879282,RESULTS,DFs were largest in the atrium where aconitine was applied Aconitine AF had larger gradients than burst pacing AF 5 0 4 5 vs 0 9 1 0 Hz P 006 Aconitine AF when compared with burst pacing AF had greater absolute LA RA differences in the SD of DFs 2 3 1 9 vs 0 2 0 2 Hz P 001 and in OI 0 11 0 07 vs 0 06 0 07 P 07  
 2009879282,CONCLUSIONS,Differences in frequency gradients and organization were observed during AF induced by burst pacing and aconitine This suggests that different mechanisms of AF are possible and may be identified with frequency domain analysis

 2145135561,MATERIALS AND METHODS,We identified 50 patients 53 hips who had a minimum 2 year clinical and radiographic follow up after a standard total hip arthroplasty performed with a thin sequentially cross linked and annealed polyethylene bearing surface There were 15 males and 35 females with a a mean age of 60 years range 16 to 93 years and a mean body mass index of 28 6 kg m² range 17 2 to 47 5 kg m² Overall survivorship was compared to a cohort of 50 patients 53 hips treated with total hip arthroplasty during the same time period utilizing the same polyethylene of 5 8 millimeters or greater thickness Radiographic analysis of polyethylene wear was performed on a subset of 26 hips using a previously validated two dimensional computer aided technique Volumetric wear was calculated and subsequent annual volumetric and linear wear rates were derived for each patient in the study cohort Additionally radiographic analysis was performed to assess for any progressive radio lucencies or malalignment  
 2145135561,RESULTS,The overall survivorship of the study cohort was 100 compared to a 96 survivorship in the comparison group two failures due to infection The mean Harris hip scores in the thin polyethylene cohort improved from 43 points range 10 to 67 points pre operatively to 91 points range 69 to 100 points postoperatively Upon radiographic review no malalignment radiolucencies or polyethylene fracture was noted in the study cohort The mean volumetric wear rate was 0 4122 mm³ year range 0 2311 to 0 7310 mm³ year and the mean linear wear rate was 0 0004 mm year range 0 0002 to 0 0007 mm year for the thin polyethylene group The mean volumetric wear was 0 8839 mm³ range 0 4621 to 1 5839 mm³ for this cohort Excellent clinical and radiographic outcomes were found for patients treated with thin sequentially cross linked and annealed polyethylene bearings utilized in total hip arthroplasty with a nominal thickness of 3 8 millimeters We have not seen any failures with thin polyethylene liners that have undergone this manufacturing process which is in contradistinction to results of previously reported thin polyethylene liners Wear rates were lower than other bearing surfaces at similar periods

 2050789286,METHODS,A prospective longitudinal analysis of all patients treated with SNS was performed to define the incidence of complications and identify the predictors of these adverse events AEs All patients underwent staged SNS placement with the InterStim device for treatment of refractory voiding dysfunction The patients were followed up for evidence of AEs and device efficacy The patient and device variables were examined statistically for evidence of predictive value  
 2050789286,RESULTS,From September 2001 to March 2008 221 patients with a mean age of 48 8 years underwent SNS lead placement for the treatment of intractable urinary urgency frequency n 121 urge incontinence n 63 or urinary retention n 37 Of this group 202 patients 91 4 experienced a 50 improvement in symptoms and underwent implantable pulse generator placement At a mean follow up of 36 9 months 67 patients 30 3 had experienced AEs pain in 6 elective removal in 10 lack of efficacy in 11 trauma in 18 infection in 7 hematoma in 3 and lead migration in 12 requiring 44 lead revisions and 47 implantable pulse generator revisions The significant predictors of AEs included a history of trauma P 001 a change in body mass index class P 001 enrollment in a pain clinic P 008 the duration of follow up P 002 and a history of AEs P 001  
 2050789286,CONCLUSIONS,The results of our study have shown that SNS is an effective treatment for patients with intractable voiding dysfunction Complications are not uncommon but can be minimized with better patient selection
