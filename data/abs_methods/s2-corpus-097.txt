 1988893100,OBJECTIVES,Perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids PFCAs consist of analogs with various carbon chain lengths Their toxicokinetics have remained unexplored except in the case of perfluorooctanoic acid 8 carbon chemicals This study aimed to investigate the toxicokinetics of PFCAs with six to fourteen carbon atoms C6 to C14 in mice and humans  
 1988893100,METHODS,We applied a two compartment model to mice administered PFCAs intravenously or by gavage The time courses of the serum concentration and tissue distribution and elimination were evaluated for 24 hours after treatment For human samples urine from healthy volunteers bile from patients who underwent biliary drainage and cerebral spinal fluid CSF from brain drainage were collected  
 1988893100,RESULTS,The mouse experiment showed that short chained PFCAs C6 and C7 were rapidly eliminated in the urine whereas long chain PFCAs C8 to C14 accumulated in the liver and were excreted slowly in feces Urinary clearance of PFCAs in humans also decreased with increasing alkyl chain lengths while biliary clearances increased C9 to C10 had the smallest total clearance for both mice and humans However disparities existed in the magnitude of the total clearance between mice and humans A slightly higher partition ratio brain serum was observed for long chained PFCAs in mice but this was not observed in the corresponding partition ratio in humans CSF serum  
 1988893100,CONCLUSIONS,The large sequestration volumes of PFCAs in the liver seem to be attributable to the liver s large binding capacity in both species This will be useful in evaluating PFCA bioaccumulation in other species

 2376289828,OBJECTIVE,To explore the involvement of dopamine DA and its metabolites in the extracellular fluid of the striatum on the resisting action of electroacupuncture EA for acute cerebral ischemia reperfusion CI R injury  
 2376289828,METHODS,A total of 50 SD male rats were randomly divided into normal control sham operation sham sham EA CI R model CI R EA groups CI R model was induced by right middle cerebral artery occlusion MCAO for 90 min and reperfusion for 225 min EA 2 Hz 3 mA continuous waves was applied to Fengchi GB 20 for 20 min with a 10 min rest and given once again fo 20 min The concentrations of DA and its metabolites 3 4 dihydroxy phenyl acetic acid DOPAC and homovanillic acid HVA in the extracellular fluid of the striatum were determined by microdialysis and high performance liquid chromatography HPLC  
 2376289828,RESULTS,The extracellular levels of DA DOPAC and HVA in normal group sham group and sham EA group had no significant changes during the whole study The extracellular level of DA peaked 15 45 min after CI and 0 30 min after CI R P 0 05 A rising trend was also observed 120 min following CI R DOPAC level peaked 15 min and 75 min after CI and 75 min after CI R After EA DA level was significantly lower in EA group than that in model group 90 min after CI R P 0 05 and no peak was observed again After EA DOPAC level maintained its basic level and no peak was found after CI R The changing trend of HVA was similar to that of DOPAC and the extracellular HVA level in EA model group was significantly lower than that in model group 75 min after CI R
