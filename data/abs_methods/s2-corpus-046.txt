 2138242624,BACKGROUND,The population of older people as well as the number of dependent older people is steadily increasing Those unable to live independently at home are being cared for in a range of settings Practical training for nurses and auxiliary care staff has frequently been recommended as a way of improving oral health care for functionally dependent elderly  
 2138242624,MATERIALS AND METHODS,The study was a cluster randomized intervention trial with an elderly home as the unit of randomization Seven out of 65 elderly homes accommodating a total of 78 caretakers and 462 elderly residents were selected in Bangalore city India out of which 3 elderly homes were assigned to the intervention group and 4 to the control group Oral health knowledge of caretakers was assessed using a pre tested proforma later oral health education was provided to the caretakers of the intervention group Oral health education was given at the end of 6 months to the caretakers of the control group Chi square test Fisher exact test and paired proportion test were used for statistical analysis  
 2138242624,RESULTS,There was significant improvement in the oral health knowledge of the caretakers from baseline in the interventional group  

 2300246682,OBJECTIVE,Incidence of HIV associated non AIDS HANA related comorbidities is increasing in HIV infected individuals Our objective was to estimate the risk of HANA comorbidity associated with history of injection drug use IDU correctly accounting for higher death rates among people who inject drugs PWID  
 2300246682,METHODS,We compared cumulative incidence risk by age of validated diagnoses of HANA comorbidities among HIV infected PWID and non IDU specifically we considered end stage renal disease ESRD end stage liver disease ESLD myocardial infarction stroke and non AIDS defining cancer We used competing risk methods appropriate to account for death standardized to the marginal distribution of baseline covariates and adjusted for potential differential loss to clinic  
 2300246682,RESULTS,Of 5490 patients included in this analysis 37 reported IDU as an HIV transmission risk By age 55 years PWID had higher risk of ESLD risk difference   6 8 95 confidence interval CI 1 9 15 5 and ESRD risk difference   11 1 95 CI 1 2 21 0 than did non IDU Risk of myocardial infarction and stroke were similar among PWID and non IDU Risk of non AIDS defining cancer was lower among PWID than among non IDU risk difference at 55 years 4 9 95 CI 11 2 1 3  
 2300246682,METHODS_DIFF,We compared cumulative incidence risk by age of validated diagnoses of HANA comorbidities among HIV infected PWID and non IDU specifically we considered end stage renal disease ESRD end stage liver disease ESLD myocardial infarction stroke and non AIDS defining cancer We used competing risk methods appropriate to account for death standardized to the marginal distribution of baseline covariates and adjusted for potential differential loss to clinic
