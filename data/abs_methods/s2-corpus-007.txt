 236778775,OBJECTIVE,To observe the dynamic changes of sciatic nerve conduction velocity of Toxoplasma gondii infected rats at different time points  
 236778775,METHODS,Twenty SD rats were randomly divided into control group and Toxoplasma gondii infection group Rats in T gondii infection group were intraperitoneal injected with 4x10 7 T gondii tachyzoites while those in control group were given equivalent normal saline Motor and sensory nerve conduction velocities MNCV SNCV in sciatic nerve were measured by Medtronic Keypoint4 Workstation electromyography at pre infection and 2 4 8 12 months post infection  
 236778775,RESULTS,Within two months after infection there was no difference in SNCV and MNCV between control group and infection group P 0 05 From 4 months after T gondii injection infected rats began to show the slowness of SNCV and MNCV which progressed with the course of infection At 4 8 and 12 months after infection SNCV and MNCV of infection group were 35 26 3 02 and 25 94 3 20 m s 33 57 2 27 and 22 75 2 31 m s and 32 38 2 38 and 22 03 2 08 m s respectively Compared with control group SNCV and MNCV of infection group reduced by 7 47 2 11 and 12 57 1 89 8 92 2 64 and 13 72 2 65 and 12 18 1 94 and 15 46 2 37 respectively P 0 05

 2435782390,BACKGROUND,Abciximab reduces the number of ischemic events in patients undergoing angioplasty compared to standard therapy Coronary stenting reduces the need for repeat procedures Abciximab or stents individually are considered cost effective interventions There is a need to quantify the economic value of the combination of abciximab and stenting over stenting alone  
 2435782390,METHODS,A decision analytic model was developed incorporating the outcomes from the EPISTENT study Costs from Canadian sources for hospitalization procedures and medications were used Life expectancy was estimated using a Markov model Total expected costs and outcomes of the abciximab and stent vs stent alone were compared in an incremental analysis The perspective of the analysis was a Canadian teaching hospital  
 2435782390,RESULTS,The acquisition cost for abciximab was partially offset by reduced costs for managing clinical events resulting in a net incremental cost of 1 076 dollars per patient over one year 8 617 dollars combination vs 7 541 dollars stent alone This added cost was accompanied by a reduction in large MI or death by an absolute rate of 5 7 at one year 5 3 combination vs 11 0 stent alone yielding an incremental cost effectiveness ratio of 18 877 dollars per death or large MI averted The long term survival gain was 0 15 to 0 37 years yielding an attractive incremental cost effectiveness ratio of 2 832 dollars to 7 173 dollars per life year gained  
 2435782390,CONCLUSIONS,The combination of abciximab and stenting versus stenting alone provides improved clinical outcomes at a very reasonable cost from the Canadian hospital perspective
