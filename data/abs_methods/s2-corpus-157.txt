 2529970745,OBJECTIVE,Hemorrhagic cystitis HC is a generally self limited complication of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation HSCT It may occur in the early or late posttransplant period and can promote sometimes severe morbidity We analyzed our data regarding HC in allogeneic HSCT patients in order to establish the efficacy of hyperbaric oxygen HBO therapy in severe HC and to document the main problems during its use  
 2529970745,METHODS,Between March 1993 and August 2006 161 patients received allogeneic HSCT Mesna hyperhydration and forced diuresis were used as early HC prophylaxis of cyclophosphamide induced HC However HC was diagnosed in 49 of the 161 recipients and 17 of them were considered as severe HC We analyzed their data retrospectively  
 2529970745,RESULTS,Forced diuresis with hyperhydration up to 8 L day and transfusion support to maintain a platelet count above 30x109 L were sufficient in 10 of the 17 patients with severe HC Alternative therapies used included intravesical irrigation with formalin and prostaglandin PG F2 alpha and HBO and HBO appeared to be the most useful among them

 2000416073,OBJECTIVES,To compare the advantages to patients and to programmes between fixed dose combination FDC antiretroviral therapy and separate tablet regimens  
 2000416073,METHODS,Three electronic databases and two conference abstract sites were searched from inception to 01 March 2013 without geographical language or date limits Studies were included if they reported data on clinical outcomes patient reported outcomes and programme related outcomes that could be related to pill burden for adult and adolescent patients on ART For the primary outcomes of adherence and virological suppression relative risks and 95 confidence intervals were calculated and these were pooled using random effects meta analysis  
 2000416073,RESULTS,Twenty one studies including information on 27 230 subjects were reviewed Data from randomised trials showed better adherence among patients receiving FDCs than among patients who did not relative risk 1 10 95 CI 0 98 1 22 these findings were consistent with data from observational cohorts RR 1 17 95 CI 1 07 1 28 There was also a tendency towards greater virological suppression among patients receiving FDCs in randomised trials RR 1 04 95 CI 0 99 1 10 and observational cohort studies RR 1 07 95 CI 0 97 1 18 In all studies reporting patient preference FDCs were preferred The overall quality of the evidence was rated as low  
 2000416073,CONCLUSIONS,Fixed dose combinations appear to offer multiple advantages for programmes and patients particularly with respect to treatment adherence
