 2124406235,BACKGROUND,Newly diagnosed patients with cancer require education about the disease the available treatments and potential consequences of treatment Greater understanding of cancer risk has been found to be associated with greater health related quality of life improved psychological adjustment and greater health related behaviours The aim of this sytematic review was to assess the effectiveness of educational interventions in improving subjective cancer risk perception and to appraise the quality of the studies  
 2124406235,METHODS,We conducted a systematic review and meta analysis of randomised controlled trials RCTs and prospective observational studies Eligible studies were identified via Medline PsycINFO AMED CINAHL and Embase databases After screening titles and abstracts two reviewers independently assessed the eligibility of 206 full text articles  
 2124406235,RESULTS,Forty papers were included in the review the majority of studies were conducted among breast cancer patients n   29 and evaluated the effect of genetic counselling on personal perceived risk n   25 Pooled results from RCTs n   12 showed that both in the short and long term educational interventions did not significantly influence risk perception level standardised mean difference 0 05 95 CI 0 24 0 34 p   0 74 or accuracy odds ratio   1 96 95 CI 0 61 6 25 p   0 26 Only one RCT reported a short term difference in risk ratings p   0 01 Of prospective observational studies n   28 many did demonstrate changes in the level of perceived risk and improved risk accuracy and risk ratings in both the short and long term However only one of three observational studies reported a short term difference in risk ratings p     0 003

 3005718541,OBJECTIVE,The purpose of this study was to develop a Japanese version of the Pelvic Girdle Questionnaire PGQ and to confirm that the Japanese version of the PGQ PGQ J was as valid as the original version  
 3005718541,METHODS,This study involves 2 phases 1 a cross cultural adaptation study and 2 a cross sectional study The English PGQ was translated referring to the cross cultural adaptation study process Forty healthy pregnant or postpartum Japanese women were recruited Women with pelvic girdle pain PGP completed the PGQ J and 5 other instruments Internal consistency construct validity test retest reliability ceiling and floor effects and discrimination validity of the PGQ J were analyzed  
 3005718541,RESULTS,The PGQ J showed high internal consistency with a Cronbach α of 968 and an interclass correlation coefficient of  79 The content validity showed a high positive correlation with the Oswestry Disability Index and Disability Rating Scale
