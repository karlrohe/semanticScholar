 2307533028,BACKGROUND,Persistent allergic rhinitis often impairs quality of life  
 2307533028,OBJECTIVE,We assessed the extent to which treating persistent allergic rhinitis with montelukast desloratadine and levocetirizine alone or in combination improved quality of life  
 2307533028,METHODS,A 32 week randomized double blind placebo controlled crossover study was performed in 2 arms 20 patients received montelukast 10 mg d and or desloratadine 5 mg d or placebo 20 patients received montelukast 10 mg d and or levocetirizine 5 mg d or placebo The treatment periods were separated by 2 week washout periods Quality of life was assessed on the day before starting treatment and on the last day of each treatment period using the Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire Sleep problems were also assessed  
 2307533028,RESULTS,In the desloratadine plus montelukast arm the mean SEM quality of life score before treatment was 3 1 0 41 After placebo this score was 2 16 0 43 after desloratadine it was 1 79 0 38 after montelukast it was 1 48 0 37 and after montelukast plus desloratadine it was 1 59 0 37 In the montelukast plus levocetirizine arm the mean quality of life score before treatment was 2 58 0 49 After placebo it was 1 78 0 46 after levocetirizine it was 1 38 0 42 after montelukast it was 1 36 0 37 and after montelukast plus levocetirizine it was 1 26 0 39  
 2307533028,CONCLUSIONS,Placebo montelukast desloratadine and levocetirizine significantly improved quality of life Combining montelukast with either levocetirizine or desloratadine gave additional benefits in comparison to each agent alone and could be considered for patients whose quality of life is impaired by persistent allergic rhinitis

 2186839938,OBJECTIVE,Noninvasive diagnostic methods do not supply sufficient data for patients with left bundle branch block LBBB accompanied with coronary artery diseases CAD Therefore generally coronary angiography is required for these patients Our aim was to evaluate the diagnostic value of multislice spiral computed tomographic MSCT coronary angiography to detect CAD in patients with LBBB  
 2186839938,METHODS,Sixty one patients 31 males 30 females mean age 56 13 years with LBBB who have determined stenosis higher than 50 in quantitative coronary angiography were included in the cross sectional study The MSCT coronary angiography was applied to the patients with a 16 detector MSCT scanner that has an electrocardiographic synchronization unit Each coronary artery was evaluated segmentally in the images acquired from MSCT coronary angiographies and any detected stenosis higher than 50 was recorded  
 2186839938,RESULTS,The data of 793 coronary artery segments achieved from MSCT coronary angiographies of 61 patients 13 segments for each patient were compared with the results of conventional coronary angiographies of the same patients When all the segments evaluated were included in this comparison the diagnostic accuracy sensitivity specificity positive and negative predictive values of MSCT coronary angiography to detect stenosis higher than 50 were 91 67 97 85 and 92 respectively Also it was observed that MSCT coronary angiography has 80 sensitivity and 90 specificity to detect at least one segment coronary artery stenosis

 1979234199,MATERIALS AND METHODS,Of the 25 adult patients with stage IE nasal lymphoma nine underwent local radiation therapy alone and 16 underwent radiation therapy and chemotherapy intravenous infusion Radiation doses to the involved area were 22 54 Gy median dose 49 Gy  
 1979234199,RESULTS,The 5 and 10 year cause specific survival rates were 91 and 73 respectively The 5 and 10 year disease free survival rates were 83 and 59 respectively Eight patients developed recurrent disease six at the local site one in the cervical nodes and one in the small intestine Five of the six patients with local recurrence received less than 50 Gy Four of the six patients developed recurrent disease in the treated area the other two patients developed marginal recurrences Prognostic factors such as age sex maximum tumor size and lactate dehydrogenase level were of limited value  

 1993828485,BACKGROUND,Glycinergic neurons in the spinal dorsal horn have been implicated in the inhibition of spinal pain processing in peripheral inflammation and chronic pain states Neuronal isoform glycine transporter 2 GlyT2 reuptakes presynaptically released glycine and regulates the glycinergic neurotransmission In this study we examined whether a selective GlyT2 inhibitor ALX1393 elicits an antinociceptive effect in a rat acute pain model  
 1993828485,METHODS,Male Sprague Dawley rats were implanted with a catheter intrathecally The effects of intrathecal administration of ALX1393 4 20 or 40 microg on thermal mechanical and chemical nociception were evaluated by tail flick hot plate paw pressure and formalin tests Furthermore to explore whether ALX1393 affects motor function a rotarod test was performed  
 1993828485,RESULTS,ALX1393 exhibited antinociceptive effects on the thermal and mechanical stimulations in a dose dependent manner The maximal effect of ALX1393 was observed at 15 min after administration and a significant effect lasted for about 60 min These antinociceptive effects were reversed completely by strychnine injected immediately after the administration of ALX1393 In the formalin test ALX1393 inhibited pain behaviors in a dose dependent manner both in the early and late phases although the influence was greater in the late phase In contrast to antinociceptive action ALX1393 did not affect motor function up to 40 microg  
 1993828485,CONCLUSIONS,This study demonstrates the antinociceptive action of ALX1393 on acute pain These findings suggest that the inhibitory neurotransmitter transporters are promising targets for the treatment of acute pain and that the selective inhibitor of GlyT2 could be a novel therapeutic drug
