 2560823829,METHODS,Three prostaglandin analogs were selected bimatoprost 0 3 mg mL latanoprost 50 μg mL and tafluprost 15 μg mL Each drug sample was tested for its ability to cause platelet aggregation which was measured as PAF induced aggregation before and after the addition of various concentrations of the examined sample creating a linear curve of percentage inhibition ranging from 0 to 100 versus different concentrations of the sample The concentration of the sample that inhibited 50 PAF induced aggregation was calculated based on this curve and this value was defined as IC50 In addition the effect of eye drops on PAF metabolism was examined through an in vitro analysis on PAF basic metabolic enzymes PAF cholinephosphotransferase PAF acetyl CoA 1 O alkyl sn glycero 3 phosphocholine acetyltransferase and PAF acetylhydrolase  
 2560823829,RESULTS,The IC50 values for Lumigan UD bimatoprost 0 3 mg mL Monoprost latanoprost 50 μg mL and Saflutan tafluprost 15 μg mL were 8 7 0 28 and 1 4 μg mL respectively

 2015154737,OBJECTIVE,To determine the type of weapons confiscated from an urban pediatric hospital and its affiliated general hospital  
 2015154737,METHODS,This was a prospective evaluation of weapons confiscated from individuals entering 2 affiliated urban hospitals a general hospital with over 85 000 emergency department visits and a freestanding children s hospital with over 45 000 emergency department visits The security personnel are common between the 2 hospitals and use similar confiscation protocols The institutions were evaluated between January 1 2000 and August 31 2000 which followed the implementation of weapons detectors at the children s hospital The variety and scope of weapons confiscated were monitored  
 2015154737,RESULTS,During the 8 months 3706 metallic weapons were confiscated This included 3446 from the general hospital and 260 from the children s center The weapons confiscated at the general hospital compared with the children s hospital included guns 4 vs 0 knives 2048 vs 114 box cutter razors 596 vs 37 scissors 70 vs 53 chemical sprays 205 vs 50 tools 73 vs 6 and other 450 vs 0  
 2015154737,CONCLUSIONS,While more weapons were confiscated at the larger general hospital the traditional sense that children s hospitals are at minimal risk is unjustified The alarming number of lethal concealed weapons confiscated from both institutions demonstrates the importance of deterrent security measures including the use of metal detectors to protect families and staff
