 2045797247,BACKGROUND,Hyperprostaglandin E syndrome antenatal Bartter syndrome HPS aBS is a congenital salt losing tubulopathy with an induced expression of cyclooxygenase 2 COX 2 in the macula densa probably leading to hyperreninemia Inhibition of stimulated prostaglandin E2 PGE2 formation with indomethacin results in a significant improvement of clinical symptoms and is therefore standard therapy Using the COX 2 selective inhibitor rofecoxib we investigated the role of COX 2 in the pathophysiology of HPS aBS  
 2045797247,METHODS,Six clinically well characterized patients with HPS aBS 3 girls were enrolled into the study Four patients had mutations in the renal potassium channel ROMK one patient in the furosemide sensitive cotransporter NKCC2 whereas in one patient no molecular abnormality could be detected Median age was 15 8 years range 9 1 to 19 0 years Patients were evaluated on indomethacin treatment 3 days after indomethacin withdrawal and after 4 days of treatment with rofecoxib Therapeutic drug monitoring was performed  
 2045797247,RESULTS,COX 2 selectivity of rofecoxib was confirmed in vivo and ex vivo Both indomethacin and rofecoxib ameliorated clinical symptoms the typical laboratory findings and significantly suppressed PGE2 and PGE M excretion to normal values while it was elevated under withdrawal conditions Rofecoxib suppressed hyperreninemia to a similar extent as indomethacin

 2120743326,OBJECTIVE,It is important to consider the health concerns of adolescents before developing and implementing public health promotion or health education curriculum programs aimed at ameliorating priority health problems experienced by adolescents The aim of this study was to test the psychometric properties of the original Adolescent Health Concern Inventory AHCI for use with an Iranian population  
 2120743326,METHODS,This was a methodological study in which 50 adolescents with age range of 14 18 years were selected using convenience sampling The translation and cultural adaptation process of The AHCI followed recognized and established guidelines The face and content validity was established by analyzing feedback solicited from teenagers and professionals with expertise in health sociology and psychology Reliability was examined using test retest and Cronbach s alpha for internal consistency reliability Kappa and McNemar tests were used to examine test retest reliability for each item  
 2120743326,RESULTS,Minor cultural differences were identified and resolved during the translation process and determining the validity of the checklist Results from Kappa and McNemar tests indicate a high degree of test retest reliability Internal consistency reliability as measured by Cronbach s alpha for the subscales were between 0 68 and 0 87 with total instrument reliability of 0 96 indicating considerable overall reliability
