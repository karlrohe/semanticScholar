 1973975355,OBJECTIVES,To characterize the contractile functions and gene expression of the alpha 1 adrenoceptor AR subtypes present in the dog intravesical ureter  
 1973975355,METHODS,In a functional study alpha 1 AR antagonists were evaluated against phenylephrine alpha 1 AR agonist induced contractions in dog isolated intravesical ureteral preparations The quantitative expression of alpha 1 AR subtype mRNA in this tissue was determined using real time quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction  
 1973975355,RESULTS,In the isolated intravesical ureter prazosin nonselective alpha 1 AR antagonist silodosin selective alpha 1A AR antagonist naftopidil selective alpha 1D AR antagonist and BMY 7378 selective alpha 1D AR antagonist all shifted the concentration contractile response curve for phenylephrine to the right The rank order of potencies pK B value was silodosin 9 45 0 14 prazosin 8 16 0 08 naftopidil 7 39 0 19 and BMY 7378 6 78 0 20 The alpha 1A AR antagonist silodosin was much more potent than the 2 alpha 1D AR antagonists The rank order of mRNA expression levels among the alpha 1 AR subtypes was alpha 1d 72 68 alpha 1a 24 14 and alpha 1b 3 18  
 1973975355,CONCLUSIONS,In the dog intravesical ureter alpha 1A AR plays a major role in contraction despite the prevalence of alpha 1D AR
