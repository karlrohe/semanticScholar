 1977567037,OBJECTIVE,Urease pretreatment gas chromatography mass spectrometry UP GC MS has become a valuable tool in the field of metabolome research including analysis of inborn errors of metabolism IEMs and acquired metabolic disturbances secondary to nutrition or drugs This research aims to screen IEMs in Chinese patients and to explore the cause of neural tube defects NTDs a congenital malformation very common in North China  
 1977567037,DESIGN AND METHODS,Urine samples from 618 patients at high risk of IEMs in China were collected and UP GC MS was performed in the selective screening Urinary methylmalonate MMA levels in pregnancy with and without NTDs fetus respectively at Luliang district a countryside region with NTDs incidence 227 10 000 Shanxi Province North China were analyzed by GC MS selective ion monitoring and compared with that from control region  
 1977567037,RESULTS,Among the 618 patients 22 kinds and 59 cases of IEM were found Methylmalonic aciduria MMAuria is on top of the list followed by neonatal intrahepatic cholestasis caused by citrin deficiency NICCD phenylketonuria PKU multiple carboxylase deficiency MCD etc Satisfactory therapeutic effects have been achieved in patients such as NICCD MCD and galactosemia At Luliang district urinary MMA levels in pregnancy no matter NTDs affected or unaffected are both significantly P 0 01 higher than that in normal control while serum B 12 levels in NTDs affected pregnancy are significantly lower than that both in NTDs unaffected group P 0 01 and in normal control P 0 01 Furthermore B 12 52 5 pmol L is associated with a 7 78 fold increased NTDs risk P 0 01 at Luliang district  
 1977567037,CONCLUSIONS,Selective screening for IEMs by UP GC MS provides valuable evidences for the diagnosis of IEMs MMAuria secondary to B 12 deficiency is quite common at Luliang district suggesting B 12 deficiency is involved in the development of NTDs in the specific population This metabolome research by UP GC MS provides valuable epidemiological information that helps to understand the prevalence and the possible intervention strategy of NTDs and IEMs especially in Chinese population
