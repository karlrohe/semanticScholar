 2181306788,BACKGROUND,Data available on the effect of quality glycemic index GI and quantity glycemic load GL of carbohydrates on the risk factors of cardiovascular disease CVD are inconsistent The objective of this study was to examine the association between dietary GI GL and CVD risk factors among Tehranian adults the participants of the Tehran Lipid and Glucose Study  
 2181306788,METHODS,This population based cross sectional study was conducted on 2457 subjects 46 men and 54 women aged 19 to 84 years Dietary GI and GL were measured using a validated 168 item semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire Anthropometrics blood pressure fasting blood glucose and lipid profiles were measured  
 2181306788,RESULTS,The mean intakes of GI and GL were 68 3 and 244 8 respectively Rice 26 6 and bread 19 0 were the major contributors to dietary GI and GL respectively Higher dietary GI and GL were associated with high intakes of carbohydrate fiber refined grain fruits simple sugar snack and desserts After adjustment for lifestyle and dietary variables a higher dietary GI was positively associated with triglycerides and high density lipoprotein HDL cholesterol concentrations among obese subjects Dietary GL was positively associated with fasting and 2 h blood glucose among nonobese subjects after adjustment for confounders

 2004224665,METHODS,The authors performed a retrospective chart review of all patients treated for ROP within a single practice from 2002 2004 There were 183 eyes from 93 patients Sufficient data for analysis were available on 112 eyes from 57 patients Data from these patients were compared to those of patients reported upon in 1991  
 2004224665,RESULTS,The average number of laser burns applied to the 112 eyes was 2163 Eyes with zone 1 disease had an average of 3077 spots and those with zone 2 disease had an average of 2072 spots Greater than three months follow up was available on 42 eyes from 21 patients Of those eyes 90 had complete regression of ROP In an initial report of laser treatment for ROP by several of the same authors in 1991 the average number of laser burns applied for treatment of ROP was 816 There was a 265 increase in the average number of laser applications from the early study to the present

 2026715277,PURPOSE OBJECTIVES,To describe whether levels of health related quality of life HRQOL differ by sociodemographic characteristics and time since breast cancer diagnosis in women in Korea  
 2026715277,METHODS,Study participants completed sociodemographic characteristics and HRQOL questionnaires Medical charts were reviewed to determine time since breast cancer diagnosis  
 2026715277,CONCLUSIONS,Study findings will be useful to establish priorities in planning nursing interventions to enhance HRQOL in care of women with breast cancer  
 2026715277,METHODS_DIFF,Study participants completed sociodemographic characteristics and HRQOL questionnaires Medical charts were reviewed to determine time since breast cancer diagnosis  

 2619694675,OBJECTIVE,Evaluate whether the polymorphism rs17782313 near MC4R gene influences long term outcomes after bariatric surgery  
 2619694675,METHODS,The rs16782313 polymorphism was genotyped in 217 individuals undergoing bariatric surgery and analyzed in detail in 141 women Data for comorbidities BMI excess weight loss EWL and body composition were obtained before and during 60 months after surgery  
 2619694675,RESULTS,The risk allele was found in 65 47 of the 141 women Pre surgical body weight and BMI were higher in carriers of the rs17782313 polymorphism CC   CT group than in non carriers TT group p   0 039 and 0 047 respectively The number of women who acquired surgical success EWL   50 was lower in CC   CT group compared to TT group p   0 015 The minimum BMI seen during the 60 months of follow up was higher in CC   CT group compared to TT group p   0 028 The number of women who presented BMI   30 kg m2 no longer classified as obesity after 24 months of surgery was inferior in CC   CT group 6 out 35 patients 17 than in TT group 19 out 49 patients 37 p   0 043 Moreover the number of patients maintaining BMI   35 kg m2 were higher carriers 18 out 35 patients 51 compare to non carriers 16 out 49 patients 32 p   0 045  
 2619694675,METHODS_DIFF,The rs16782313 polymorphism was genotyped in 217 individuals undergoing bariatric surgery and analyzed in detail in 141 women Data for comorbidities BMI excess weight loss EWL and body composition were obtained before and during 60 months after surgery
