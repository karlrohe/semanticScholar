 2023978246,MATERIALS AND METHODS,Sixty intact and histologically normal human SMGs from patients with benign tumor of the mandible who underwent vascularized mandibular reconstruction and removal of the SMG for anastomosis of the blood vessels were included in the study SMGs were perfused with methacrylate to form resin casts of blood vessels and ducts The length and diameter of the blood vessels and ducts in the casts were measured using a sliding caliper The numbers of lobules distribution of arteries veins and ducts as well as the relationship among them were analyzed  
 2023978246,RESULTS,The resin cast of the gland showed a treelike structure with the vessels gradually dividing into multiple branches The arteries veins and ducts run in parallel and were roughly divided into 3 levels from the stem extending into the main branches level I into the narrower secondary branches level II and then the secondary branches subsequently divided into terminal branches level III The structures of the blood vessels and ducts were similar at each level in the lobules In the vein casts communicating vessels were found between the anterior facial vein and the concomitant vein of the facial artery  

 2149987019,BACKGROUND,With the implementation of competency based curricula Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skills OSATS increasingly is being used for the assessment of operative skills Although evidence for its usefulness has been demonstrated in experimental study designs data supporting OSATS application in the operating room are limited This study evaluates the validity and reliability of the OSATS instrument to assess the operative skills of surgery residents in the operating theater  
 2149987019,METHODS,Twenty four residents were recruited from seven hospitals within a general surgical training region and classified equally into three groups according to postgraduate training year PGY Each resident had to perform five different types of operations Surgical performance was measured using a modified OSATS consisting of three scales Global Rating Scale Overall Performance Scale and Alphabetic Summary Scale Validity and reliability metrics included construct validity Kruskal Wallis test and internal consistency reliability Cronbach s α coefficient Spearman s correlation coefficients were calculated to determine correlations between the different scales  
 2149987019,RESULTS,Eighteen residents PGY 1 2 n 7 PGY 3 4 n 8 PGY 5 6 n 3 performed 249 operations Comparisons of the performance scores revealed that evidence for construct validity depended on the difficulty level of the selected procedures For individual operations internal consistency reliability of the Global Rating Scale ranged from 0 93 to 0 95 Scores on the different scales correlated strongly r 0 62 0 76 P 001

 2442412907,METHODS,We measured aPWV in 627 patients who participated in the epidemiological study CARDIPP Cardiovascular Risk Factors in Patients with Diabetes a Prospective Study in Primary Care ClinicalTrials gov identifier NCT01049737 and who did not have previously known myocardial infarction or stroke The outcome variable was a composite endpoint consisting of cardiovascular mortality hospitalization for myocardial infarction and hospitalization for stroke  
 2442412907,RESULTS,During a median follow up time of almost eight years the unadjusted HR per each increment of aPWV by 1m s was 1 239 95 CI 1 114 1 379 P 0 001 for the primary endpoint Following adjustments for age sex diabetes duration office systolic blood pressure resting heart rate total cholesterol HbA1c estimated glomerular filtration rate and smoking status the adjusted hazard ratio was 1 142 95 CI 1 003 1 301 P 0 044  
 2442412907,CONCLUSIONS,In primary preventive patients with type 2 diabetes treated in primary care aPWV predicted a composite outcome of incident cardiovascular events independently of diabetes specific and traditional risk factors
