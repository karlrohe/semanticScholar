 2042849699,MATERIALS AND METHODS,Five pure compounds were isolated from EtOH extract of Bauhinia strychnifolia stem using silica gel dianion HP 20 and sephadex LH 20 column chromatography and were tested for their cytotoxic effects against HT 29 HeLa MCF 7 and KB cell lines using the Sulforhodamine B SRB assay  
 2042849699,RESULTS,Among five compounds 3 5 7 3 5 pentahydroxyflavanonol 3 O α l rhamnopyranoside 2 possessed very potent activity against KB IC₅₀ 0 00054μg mL HT 29 IC₅₀ 0 00217 μg mL MCF 7 IC₅₀ 0 0585 μg mL and HeLa cells IC₅₀ 0 0692 μg mL 3 5 7 Trihydroxychromone 3 O α l rhamnopyranoside 3 also showed good activity against HT 29 IC₅₀ 0 02366 μg mL KB IC₅₀ 0 0412 μg mL and MCF 7 IC₅₀ 0 297 μg mL respectively The activity of 2 IC₅₀ 0 00054 μg mL against KB cell was ten times higher than that of the positive control Camptothecin anti cancer drug IC₅₀ 0 0057 μg mL All compounds did not show any cytotoxicity with normal cells at the concentration of 1 μg mL
