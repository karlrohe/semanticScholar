 2134973723,BACKGROUND,Organ donation is the major component for transplant programs however the rate of organ donation is relatively low in Asia Therefore understanding the attitude and knowledge of individuals that affect their willingness to commit as an organ donor is crucial to develop effective educational programs that raise public awareness and commitment toward organ donation The current study aims to identify the knowledge level attitude and commitment toward organ donation among nursing students in a local university  
 2134973723,METHODS,A questionnaire was developed and distributed to all full time nursing students of undergraduate and master programs in a university at Hong Kong  
 2134973723,RESULTS,A total of 362 students completed the questionnaire including 87 males and 257 females The mean age of the students was 22 6 years A total of 147 students 40 6 had registered for organ donation Students on average could correctly answer 23 7 out of 33 questions 71 8 regarding their knowledge on organ donation and transplantation With regard to attitude toward organ donation students obtained a mean score of 70 2 Univariate analysis revealed that year of study religion and attitude were significantly associated with commitment toward organ donation In logistic regression analysis year of study odds ratio OR for year 2 1 961 95 confidence interval CI 1 006 3 824 OR for year 3 6 915 95 CI 2 835 16 868 and OR for year 4 4 845 95 CI 2 071 11 334 and attitude OR 1 087 95 CI 1 049 1 126 were significantly associated with commitment toward donation after adjusting the age gender and study program

 2253083338,METHODS,The Collaborative Longitudinal Evaluation of Keratoconus CLEK Study is an observational study that has enrolled 1 209 keratoconus patients to characterize the progression of keratoconus to determine factors associated with its progression and to assess its impact on quality of life Ten percent of the patients were randomly selected at baseline for a retest examination The baseline examination which included keratometry and FDACL was repeated in this sample The FDACL is the flattest lens in the standardized CLEK trial lens set that vaults the apex of the cone FDACL provides an estimate of the sagittal height of the cone  
 2253083338,RESULTS,The correlation of FDACL with the steep keratometric reading r 0 89 p 0 0001 and the flat keratometric reading r 0 83 p 0 0001 were high Test retest repeatability as measured by the intraclass correlation coefficient ICC was high FDACL ICC 0 97 steep keratometric reading ICC 0 96 and flat keratometric reading ICC 0 95 Test retest repeatability of FDACL remained high in advanced disease

 1963640091,BACKGROUND,B cells are prominent immune cells in established periodontitis lesions Tumour necrosis factor superfamily TNFSF cytokines play roles in supporting B cell function as well as bone re modelling The influence of smoking on factors that support B cell function in periodontitis remains unclear  
 1963640091,MATERIALS METHODS,Plasma concentrations of TNFSF and OPG were evaluated in 200 systemically healthy subjects divided into four groups non smokers with periodontitis n   101 smokers with periodontitis n   55 healthy non smokers n   27 and healthy smokers n   17  
 1963640091,RESULTS,Periodontitis patients had significantly higher plasma sRANKL TNF APRIL and BAFF and lower OPG than healthy subjects p   0 01 TNF and sRANKL were significantly greater in smokers with periodontitis p   0 011 p   0 001 and OPG concentrations significantly lower p   0 001 whereas APRIL or BAFF were little changed Plasma APRIL BAFF sRANKL and TNF correlated with probing depth and clinical attachment loss  

 2038153203,METHODS,We measured the expression of miR 15b in both the high fat induced non alcoholic fatty liver disease NAFLD SD rat model and in the palmitate induced NAFLD L02 cell model Following transfection of miR 15b into QSG7701 cells cell proliferation glucose consumption and intracellular triglyceride levels were measured We also measured the levels of miR 15b in the serum of fatty liver disease patients using real time PCR  
 2038153203,RESULTS,We found that miR 15b was upregulated in the livers of NAFLD SD rats as well as in NAFLD L02 cells Increased miR 15b levels could cause decreased cell proliferation and glucose consumption as well as induce the storage of intracellular triglyceride in QSG7701 cells The expression of miR 15b was also significantly elevated in the serum of fatty liver disease patients compared with healthy subjects  
 2038153203,CONCLUSIONS,Increased miR 15b expression in NAFLD models may lead to decreased cell proliferation and glucose consumption while inducing the storage of intracellular triglyceride which are all hazards of NAFLD Therefore increased serum miR 15b level is a potentially biomarker for the diagnosis of fatty liver disease
