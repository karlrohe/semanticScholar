 2791906358,BACKGROUND,Quantitative assessment of post transcatheter aortic valve replacement TAVR aortic regurgitation AR remains challenging We developed patient specific anatomical models with pulsatile flow circuit and investigated factors associated with AR after TAVR  
 2791906358,METHODS,Based on pre procedural computed tomography CT data of the six patients who underwent transfemoral TAVR using a 23 mm SAPIEN XT anatomically and mechanically equivalent aortic valve models were developed Forward flow and heart rate of each patient in two days after TAVR were duplicated under mean aortic pressure of 80mmHg Paravalvular leakage PVL volume in basal and additional conditions was measured for each model using an electromagnetic flow sensor Incompletely apposed tract between the transcatheter and aortic valves was examined using a micro CT  
 2791906358,RESULTS,PVL volume in each patient specific model was consistent with each patient s PVL grade and was affected by hemodynamic conditions PVL and total regurgitation volume increased with the mean aortic pressure whereas closing volume did not change In contrast closing volume increased proportionately with heart rate but PVL did not change The minimal cross sectional gap had a positive correlation with the PVL volumes r 0 89 P 0 02 The gap areas typically occurred in the vicinity of the bulky calcified nodules under the native commissure  
 2791906358,CONCLUSIONS,PVL volume which could be affected by hemodynamic conditions was significantly associated with the minimal cross sectional gap area between the aortic annulus and the stent frame These data may improve our understanding of the mechanism of the occurrence of post TAVR PVL

 2259564445,OBJECTIVE,To compare the risk of complications following Bacillus Calmette Guérin BCG vaccination among children by maternal and infant HIV 1 infection status as part of an investigation of an outbreak of BCG complications  
 2259564445,METHODS,A nonconcurrent cohort study of BCG complications among 125 infants born to HIV 1 seropositive and 166 infants born to HIV 1 seronegative mothers was conducted in Cité Soleil Haiti Infants were examined at regular intervals until 15 months of age and complications from BCG were documented An investigation of BCG vaccination practices was conducted  
 2259564445,RESULTS,Mild or moderate complications occurred among 16 of 166 9 6 infants born to HIV 1 seronegative mothers compared with 4 of 13 HIV 1 infected infants 30 8 P 04 and 10 of 75 13 3 P 39 uninfected infants born to HIV 1 infected mothers No serious complications were noted The outbreak of complications was associated with administration of 2 0 to 2 5 times the recommended dose of BCG vaccine  
 2259564445,CONCLUSIONS,This and five other cohort studies indicate that there may be a small increased risk of complications following BCG vaccination among HIV 1 infected children but the reactions are usually mild and the risk does not outweigh the benefits of BCG vaccination in populations at high risk of tuberculosis during infancy and childhood
