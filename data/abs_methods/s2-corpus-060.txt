 2766290831,BACKGROUND PURPOSE,Very little is known about the methods of integrating palpation techniques to existing mobile teleskin imaging that delivers low quality tactile information roughness for telepalpation However no study has been reported yet regarding telehaptic palpation using mobile phone images for teledermatology or teleconsultations of skincare  
 2766290831,METHODS,This study is therefore aimed at introducing a new algorithm accurately reconstructing a haptic augmented skin surface for telehaptic palpation using a low cost clip on microscope simply attached to a mobile phone Multiple algorithms such as gradient based image enhancement roughness adaptive tactile mask generation roughness enhanced 3D tactile map building and visual and haptic rendering with a three degrees of freedom DOF haptic device were developed and integrated as one system  
 2766290831,RESULTS,Evaluation experiments have been conducted to test the performance of 3D roughness reconstruction with without the tactile mask The results confirm that reconstructed haptic roughness with the tactile mask is superior to the reconstructed haptic roughness without the tactile mask Additional experiments demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is robust against varying lighting conditions and blurring In last a user study has been designed to see the effect of the haptic modality to the existing visual only interface and the results attest that the haptic skin palpation can significantly improve the skin exam performance

 2952187248,BACKGROUND,Evidence from high income countries HICs suggests that individuals who present to hospital after self harm are an important target for suicide prevention but evidence from low and middle income countries LMICs is lacking We aimed to investigate the risk of repeat self harm and suicide and factors associated with these outcomes in a large cohort of patients presenting to hospital with self harm in rural Sri Lanka  
 2952187248,METHODS,In this cohort study hospital presentations for self harm at 13 hospitals in a rural area of North Central Province population 224 000 Sri Lanka were followed up with a self harm surveillance system established as part of a community randomised trial and based on data from all hospitals coroners and police stations in the study area We estimated the risk of repeat non fatal and fatal self harm and risk factors for repetition with Kaplan Meier methods and Cox proportional hazard models Sociodemographic age sex and socioeconomic position and clinical past self harm and method of self harm characteristics investigated were drawn from a household survey in the study area and data recorded at the time of index hospital presentation We included all individuals who had complete data for all variables in the study in our primary analysis
