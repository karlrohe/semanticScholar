 2119405164,MATERIALS AND METHODS,This observational study was executed between 2011 and 2013 Participants 18 years 65 years with or without nocturia controls were included and completed a 72 hr FVC osmolality and sodium excretion were analyzed on daytime and nighttime urine  
 2119405164,RESULTS, 1 Nocturia severity Compared to controls N   38 those with 2 nocturia episodes N   29 have higher nocturnal voided volume NVV P   0 001 based on increased sodium excretion P   0 003 and lower functional bladder capacity P   0 001 Those with one nocturia episode N   21 present with lower bladder capacity P   0 005 2 Gender women with 1 and 2 episodes have lower bladder capacity than controls P   0 047 and P   0 001 respectively Men with 2 episodes present with increased NVV P   0 001 and decreased bladder capacity P   0 049 3 Age Younger participants 44 years with 2 nocturia episodes present with lower functional bladder capacity than controls P   0 001 Older participants 45 65 years present with both increasing NVV and decreasing bladder capacity with increasing nocturia frequency P   0 001 sodium excretion is higher in those with 2 episodes P   0 029 4 Causes the percentage of isolated NP decreases P   0 005 whereas the combination of both causes increases with increase in number of nocturia episodes P   0 020  
 2119405164,CONCLUSIONS,The mismatch between functional bladder capacity and NVV with increasing nocturia frequency demands a comprehensive diagnostic approach to subtype the patient which involves anamnesis FVC and analysis of daytime and nighttime urine  

 2033417395,BACKGROUND,Patients who survive hip fracture are at high risk of recurrent fractures but rates of osteoporosis treatment 1 year after sustaining a fracture are less than 10 to 20 We have developed an osteoporosis case manager intervention The case manager educated patients arranged bone mineral density tests provided prescriptions and communicated with primary care physicians The intervention was compared with usual care in a randomized controlled trial  
 2033417395,METHODS,We recruited from all hospitals that participate in the Capital Health system Alberta Canada including patients 50 years or older who had sustained a hip fracture and excluding those who were receiving osteoporosis treatment or who lived in a long term care facility Primary outcome was bisphosphonate therapy 6 months after fracture secondary outcomes included bone mineral density testing appropriate care bone mineral density testing and treatment if bone mass was low and intervention costs  
 2033417395,RESULTS,We screened 2219 patients and allocated 220 as follows 110 to the intervention group and 110 to the control group Median age was 74 years 60 were women and 37 reported having had previous fractures Six months after hip fracture 56 patients in the intervention group 51 were receiving bisphosphonate therapy compared with 24 patients in the control group 22 adjusted odds ratio 4 7 95 confidence interval 2 4 8 9 P 001 Bone mineral density tests were performed in 88 patients in the intervention group 80 vs 32 patients in the control group 29 P 001 Of the 120 patients who underwent bone mineral density testing 25 21 had normal bone mass Patients in the intervention group were more likely to receive appropriate care than were patients in the control group 67 vs 26 P 001 The average intervention cost was 50 00 per patient

 2743893246,METHODS,All consecutive families with two or more affected members with primary concomitant horizontal strabismus were prospectively recruited at the ophthalmic outpatients department OPD of Lady Hardinge Medical College New Delhi from August 2014 to February 2017 Detailed phenotypic evaluation and pedigree documentation was performed  
 2743893246,RESULTS,Of the 39 recruited families of north Indian origin 18 families each had affected family members demonstrating either ET or XT 100 concordance of the phenotype in the affected family members was observed in these families While vertical transmission was observed in 17 18 families with XT 7 with ET had affected members across one generation 2 demonstrated consanguineous pedigree and 2 comprised identical twin families In 3 families a combination of ET and XT was noted This comprised one family with the ET and XT patients being from 2 separate arms of the family related by marriage one family where one sibling had XT and the other had ET and another family where the maternal aunt of the affected proband with ET had XT  
 2743893246,CONCLUSIONS,Subjects with familial primary concomitant strabismus recruited in this study may provide a valuable resource to unravel the genetic determinants of this condition which is a common disorder of early childhood with high ophthalmic morbidity

 2444210853,OBJECTIVE,To analyze the prevalence of anemia and its proportions of severity and to examine the association between anemia and nutritional status among Chinese students of ethnic minorities so as to provide bases for the prevention and treatment of anemia  
 2444210853,METHODS,The subjects were Mongolian Hui Zhuang and Korean students aged 7 9 12 14 and 17 years sampled from the 2010 Chinese National Surveys on Students Constitution and Health World Health Organization WHO criteria for screening anemia 2001 was used and the proportion rates of mild moderate and severe were analyzed The nutritional status was defined according to the growth references of body mass index BMI for age z score for 5 19 years developed by the WHO Stepwise Logistic regression was used to assess the association between anemia and nutritional status gender urban rural areas age and ethnic minorities  
 2444210853,RESULTS,The prevalences of anemia were 4 4 26 4 6 6 and 5 8 in Mongolian Hui Zhuang and Korean students respectively of whom the prevalence of anemia was highest in rural girls and reached 4 8 42 0 9 0 and 6 7 respectively Most of the ethnic minorities students belonged to mild anemia and the prevalence of severe anemia was 1 4 12 9 1 6 and 1 9 in Mongolian Hui Zhuang and Korean students respectively Stepwise Logistic regression showed that the girls rural students students aged 12 years and 17 years Hui Zhuang and Korean students were more likely to develop anemia than the boys urban students students aged 7 years and Mongolian students The overweight students were less likely to develop anemia compared with the normal students and there was no significant association between anemia and thinness or obesity when the other factors were controlled P 0 05
