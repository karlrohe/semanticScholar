 1992416566,BACKGROUND,Unhealthy behaviours often occur in combination In this study the relationship between education and lifestyle defined as a cluster of risk behaviours has been analysed with the purpose to assess socio economic changes in multiple risk behaviour over time  
 1992416566,METHODS,Cross sectional data from the Belgian Health Interview Surveys 1997 2001 and 2004 were analysed This study is restricted to persons aged 15 years with information on those health behaviours and education n 7431 n 8142 and n 7459 respectively A lifestyle index was created based on the sum of the four unhealthy behaviours smokers vs non smokers risky versus non risky alcohol use sedentaryness vs physically active and poor vs healthy diet The lifestyle index was dichotomized as low 0 2 vs high 3 4 For the assessment of socio economic inequalities in multiple risk behaviour summary measures as Odds Ratio OR and Relative Index of Inequality RII were calculated using logistic regression stratified by sex  
 1992416566,RESULTS,Of the adult population 7 5 combined three to four unhealthy behaviours Lower educated men are the most at risk Besides the OR among men significantly increased from 1 6 in 2001 to 3 4 in 2004 P 0 029 The increase of the OR among women was less pronounced The RII on the other hand did not show any gradient neither for men nor for women

 2141852949,METHODS,This is a retrospective review of 13 cases of chordomas and 2 cases of chondroid chondrosarcomas of the skull based treated with linear accelerator stereotactic radiotherapy SRT n 10 or stereotactic radiosurgery SRS n 5 The average time to the most recent follow up visit was 4 5 years The tumor characteristics treatment details and outcomes were recorded Each radiation plan was reviewed and the dosage received by the brainstem optic apparatus and pituitary was calculated  
 2141852949,RESULTS,Of the 10 patients treated with SRT 6 were found to have unchanged or decreased tumor size as determined from radiographic follow up Of the 5 patients treated with SRS 3 were found to have stable or unchanged tumors at follow up The complications included 1 SRT patient who developed endocrinopathy 2 patients 1 treated with SRS and the other with SRT who developed cranial neuropathy and 1 SRS patient who developed visual deficits Additionally 1 patient who received both SRS and SRT within 2 years for recurrence experienced transient medial temporal lobe radiation changes that resolved  
 2141852949,CONCLUSIONS,Where proton beam therapy is unavailable linear accelerator based SRT or radiosurgery remains a safe option for adjuvant therapy of chordomas and chondrosarcomas of the skull base The exposure of the optic apparatus pituitary stalk and brainstem must be considered during planning to minimize complications If the optic apparatus is included in the 80 isodose line it might be best to fractionate therapy Exposure of the pituitary stalk should be kept to 30 Gy to minimize endocrine dysfunction Brainstem exposure should be limited to 60 Gy in fractions
