 2894700375,BACKGROUND,The therapeutic options for treatment resistant depression TRD encompass a range of neuromodulatory techniques including repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation rTMS While rTMS is safe and has documented short term efficacy durability of antidepressant effects is poorly established  
 2894700375,OBJECTIVE,Assess existing evidence regarding durability of rTMS induced antidepressant response  
 2894700375,METHODS,We performed a systematic review of studies reporting antidepressant outcome measures collected three or more months after the end of an induction course of rTMS for depression Among responders to the induction course we used a meta analytic approach to assess response rates at 3 m3 6 m6 or 12 m12 months after induction and studied predictors of responder rates using meta regression  
 2894700375,RESULTS,Nineteen studies published between 2002 and 2018 were included Eighteen were eligible for analysis at m3 732 patients and m6 695 patients and 9 at m12 247 patients Among initial responders 66 5 sustained response at m3 95 CI   57 1 74 8 I2   27 6 52 9 at m6 95 CI   40 3 65 I2   0 and 46 3 at m12 95 CI   32 6 60 7 I2   0 in the absence of any major bias Random effects meta regressions further demonstrated that a higher proportion of women as well as receipt of maintenance treatment predicted higher responder rates at specific time points  
 2894700375,CONCLUSIONS,rTMS is a durable treatment for depression with sustained responder rates of 50 up to 1 year after a successful induction course of treatment Maintenance treatment may enhance the durability of the antidepressant effects of rTMS and should be considered in clinical practice as well as systematically explored in future clinical trials
