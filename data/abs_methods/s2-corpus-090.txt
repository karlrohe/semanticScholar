 3010473479,BACKGROUND,Heat related illnesses pose significant threats to human health  
 3010473479,OBJECTIVES, 1 To evaluate the use of qSOFA score for prognosis of heat related hospitalized patients and 2 identify other predictors for patient prognosis  
 3010473479,METHODS,Using 28 day mortality as the primary endpoint a retrospective observational study of patients hospitalized between June 2013 and September 2018 was conducted  
 3010473479,RESULTS,The qSOFA score from 84 patients was identified as an independent predictor of patient prognosis The area under the receiver operating characteristic curves for qSOFA score was 0 702 and a sensitivity of 100 00 and a specificity of 47 06 were found for qSOFA score greater than or equal to 2 Other predictors included bilirubin urea nitrogen and troponin I levels  
 3010473479,CONCLUSIONS,qSOFA score can be used as a parameter to distinguish patients with severe heat related illness prior to further clinical analyses In addition to that multiple organ impairment should be considered when assessing patient prognosis

 ,BACKGROUND,Nanobodies derived from camelid antibodies made of only heavy chains are the smallest biologic antigen binding fragments 15kDa with faster pharmacokinetics and better tumor penetration efficiency than standard antibodies The present study evaluates the efficacy of a fluorescent anti carcinoembryonic antigen CEA nanobody for rapid tumor labeling in an orthotopic mouse model of pancreatic cancer  
 ,METHODS,Anti CEA or control nanobodies were conjugated with the near infrared fluorophore IRDye 800CW Fragments of BxPC 3 high CEA expressing or MiaPACA 2 low CEA expressing human pancreatic cancer cell lines were orthotopically implanted into the pancreatic tail of nude mice After tumors reached 7 to 10 mm in size 2 nmol anti CEA or control nanobody IRDye800CW were injected intravenously Mice were imaged at various time points hours post injection  
 ,RESULTS,Anti CEA nanobodies clearly labeled BxPC3 orthotopic pancreatic tumors 3 hours after injection The signal was present as early as 15 minutes after injection and was robust at 1 to 3 hours after injection with a tumor to background ratio of 2 66 In contrast there was very low accumulation in the low CEA expressing MiaPACA2 pancreatic orthotopic tumors The fluorophore conjugated nanobody was specific for CEA expressing tumors while the control nanobody did not show any tumor specific signal Both nanobodies had strong kidney uptake as expected for small molecule probes The fluorescence signal was detectable using 2 clinical Food and Drug Administration approved 800 nm imaging devices as well as small animal imaging systems

 ,OBJECTIVE,To study the principle of arthroscopic surgery and its clinical importance on the traumatic anterior shoulder instability  
 ,METHODS,From September 2002 to May 2005 18 patients with injury history of 15 weeks averagely were involved in the study Twelve of the patients had a history of sports injuries 5 had shoulder injuries during working time and 1 had a traffic accident Among them 18 had shoulder pain 15 had limitation of range of motion ROM of shoulder 18 had positive apprehension test and 5 had positive speed test Three patients had Hill Satch lesion in X ray Double contrast CT I degree 1 II degree 15 III degree 2 On arthroscopic view 18 had anterior glenoid labrum detachment 4 had anterior capsular laxity 4 had combined superior labral anterior posterior SLAP injury 3 had free body 2 had humeral head or glenoid cartilage lesion Anterior glenoid labrum detachment in 18 patients was reduced and sutured by the fixed anchor technique 3 had anterior capsule shrinkage 2 had debridement of frayed long head tendon of biceps and 2 had reattachment of the long head tendon of biceps outside the capsule SLAP injuries were sutured in 3 and debridement of frayed superior labrum in 1  
 ,RESULTS,All of the patients were followed up with an average of 18 months 10 32 months All the patients felt free of the pain of their shoulder except one felt shoulder aching after strenuous exercise The loss of the external rotation of the operated shoulder was less than 20 degrees in 2 patients and the posterior extension was 10 degrees in 1 patient One patient had a positive result of Apprehension Sign UCLA score 14 3 preoperatively 32 5 postoperatively t 14 081 P 0 01 All patients returned to pre injured sports activities and original work  
 ,CONCLUSIONS,Traumatic anterior shoulder instability can obtain good effects when treated with the arthroscopic surgery of shoulder Complete reduction and reliable fixation of the anterior glenoid labrum complex is the key point Fixation with the suture anchor is reliable and makes the operation simple
