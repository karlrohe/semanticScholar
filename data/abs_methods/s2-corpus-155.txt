 2808136342,OBJECTIVES,Tigecycline non susceptible Acinetobacter nosocomialis TNAN has been discovered in clinical isolates The resistance nodulation cell division RND type efflux system plays a major role in tigecycline non susceptible Acinetobacter baumannii but the mechanism in A  nosocomialis remains unknown Our aim was to analyse the contribution of efflux based tigecycline resistance in clinical A  nosocomialis isolates collected from multiple medical centres in Taiwan  
 2808136342,METHODS,A total of 57 A nosocomialis isolates including 46 TNAN and 11 tigecycline susceptible A  nosocomialis TSAN isolates were analysed Of these 46 TNAN isolates were clustered to ST410 43 isolates and ST68 three isolates by multi locus sequence typing  
 2808136342,RESULTS,The relationship between the RND efflux pump and tigecycline resistance was indirectly verified by successfully reducing tigecycline resistance with NMP an efflux pump inhibitor The three RND efflux systems AdeABC AdeIJK and AdeFGH were detected in all clinical isolates The transcript level of adeB gene increased significantly and was correlated with tigecycline resistance Moreover the AdeRS two component system was further classified into four different types of AdeRS patterns considering the amino acid sequence Further analysis showed that tigecycline resistance was related to the transcript level of adeB gene and the AdeRS pattern
