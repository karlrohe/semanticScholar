 2527378540,METHODS,The QSAR Toolbox software application designed to identify and fill toxicological data gaps for chemical hazard assessment was used Estrogen receptors are much less of a lock and key interaction than highly specific ones The ER is nonspecific enough to permit binding with a diverse array of chemical structures There are three primary ER binding subpockets each with different requirements for hydrogen bonding  
 2527378540,RESULTS,More than 900 compounds approved as of FCM components were evaluated for their potential to bind on ER All evaluated chemicals were subcategorized to five groups with respect to the binding potential to ER very strong strong moderate weak binder and no binder to ER In total 46 compounds were characterized as potential disturbers of estrogen receptor

 2105350887,METHODS,The spectral sensitivity of circadian photoreception peaks in the blue part of the spectrum at approximately 460 nm Photosensitive retinal ganglion cells send unconscious information about environmental illumination to non visual brain centres including the human body s master biological clock in the suprachiasmatic nuclei This information permits human physiology to be optimised and aligned with geophysical day night cycles using neural and hormonal messengers including melatonin Age related transmittance spectra of crystalline lenses and photopic pupil diameter are used with the spectral sensitivity of melatonin suppression and the transmittance spectra of intraocular lenses IOLs to analyse how ageing and IOL chromophores affect circadian photoreception  
 2105350887,RESULTS,Ageing increases crystalline lens light absorption and decreases pupil area resulting in progressive loss of circadian photoreception A 10 year old child has circadian photoreception 10 fold greater than a 95 year old phakic adult A 45 year old adult retains only half the circadian photoreception of early youth Pseudophakia improves circadian photoreception at all ages particularly with UV only blocking IOLs which transmit blue wavelengths optimal for non visual photoreception  
 2105350887,CONCLUSIONS,Non visual retinal ganglion photoreceptor responses to bright properly timed light exposures help assure effective circadian photoentrainment and optimal diurnal physiological processes Circadian photoreception can persist in visually blind individuals if retinal ganglion cell photoreceptors and their suprachiasmatic connections are intact Retinal illumination decreases with ageing due to pupillary miosis and reduced crystalline lens light transmission especially of short wavelengths Inadequate environmental light and or ganglion photoreception can cause circadian disruption increasing the risk of insomnia depression numerous systemic disorders and possibly early mortality Artificial lighting is dimmer and less blue weighted than natural daylight contributing to age related losses in unconscious circadian photoreception Optimal intraocular lens design should consider the spectral requirements of both conscious and unconscious retinal photoreception

 2099181625,BACKGROUND,The analytical quality of self monitoring of blood glucose SMBG is not satisfactory and the need for standardized control routines for SMBG has been underscored The objective of this study was to investigate whether an external quality assessment scheme EQAS designed for office laboratories could improve the quality of SMBG measurements  
 2099181625,METHODS,From October 2001 through March 2004 we conducted 6 glucose surveys for diabetes patients and coordinated them with an EQAS for office laboratories Patients received 2 control samples by post twice a year They measured each control sample in duplicate in accordance with written instructions returned the results and received an assessment of their analytical performance Participants who got a poor evaluation were followed up by phone and were offered guidance  
 2099181625,RESULTS,Participating in an EQA program over a period of 3 years decreased the percentage of poor results among diabetes patients significantly from 11 2 to 1 9 in the first and last surveys respectively Between participant CVs improved from 5 5 to 3 7 and were comparable to results from office laboratories It was difficult to sort out factors contributing to quality improvement  
 2099181625,CONCLUSIONS,Implementing a traditional EQAS among diabetes patients may improve the analytical quality of SMBG and could be convenient for motivated patients Further evaluation of the clinical usefulness of implementing such a program is needed however and costs as well as limitations of current EQAS for glucose in general should be taken into account
