 2047269575,RESULTS,Of the enrolled population 53 children had symptomatic epilepsy and 51 were in 5 to 10 year age group More than two thirds of children were on monotherapy with phenytoin n 176 63 5 being the most common AED Three hundred fifty three AED related ADRs were recorded in 175 children 63 2 Poor scholastic performance 19 was the most common ADR followed by gum hypertrophy 13 3 headache 10 2 behavioral problems 5 7 drowsiness 5 7 and others Two hundred sixteen ADRs were probable and 126 ADRs were possible Severe ADRs were noted in 6 children Girls odds ratio OR 1 93 95 confidence interval 95 CI 1 07 3 45 P 0 03 children with secondary epilepsy OR 3 31 95 CI 1 76 6 23 P 0 001 children older than 5 years 5 10 years OR 6 28 95 CI 2 79 14 12 P 0 001 and those older than 10 years OR 9 04 95 CI 3 69 22 17 P 0 001 were found to be at higher risk of experiencing ADRs  
 2047269575,CONCLUSIONS,Monotherapy was the preferred treatment Phenytoin was the most common ADR causative agent Female sex symptomatic epilepsy and older age  5 years were found to be associated with higher probability of ADR development

 2109567481,OBJECTIVE,To evaluate the efficacy of a close female relative providing emotional and physical support during active labor and birth  
 2109567481,METHODS,Participants were randomly assigned to receive usual care and support from a chosen close female relative from admission until 2 hours after birth or usual care only Within 24 hours of birth labor outcomes length of labor type of birth and levels of maternal satisfaction were assessed  
 2109567481,RESULTS,Those in the experimental group had a significantly shorter duration of active labor and were more satisfied with their childbirth experiences than those in the control group Differences between groups with respect to incidence of spontaneous delivery were not found  
 2109567481,CONCLUSIONS,A close female relative was effective in providing supportive care during labor and delivery The integration of this nursing intervention for women and their families at public hospitals in Thailand is supported
