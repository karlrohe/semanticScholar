 44302406,METHODS,In our study four tagging SNPs in the COMT gene rs933271 rs740603 rs4680 rs4646316 were genotyped in a nonclinical Hungarian sample n 939 We investigated the association between the COMT gene and rumination scores measured by the Ruminative Response Scale using haplotype trend regression  
 44302406,RESULTS,We found a significant association between COMT haplotypes and rumination scores p 0 013 but no significant association was apparent between the functional Val158Met polymorphism rs4680 and rumination in any genetic model

 2135273496,METHODS,As mentioned in part I a total of 44 male patients with intractable angina caused by coronary insufficiency were enrolled in this study Treatment course of EECP consists of 35 1 hour sessions over 7 weeks Another 35 1 hour sessions over another 7 weeks were offered to patients who received one course and required a second course because of no or minimal improvement from class IV to class III angina after the first course  
 2135273496,RESULTS,Patients who received only one course N 34 had significantly higher EF domain Q3 and Q4 in pre and post EECP results than patients who received two courses N 10 after they completed the first course Patients who had 5 years duration of IHD had significantly higher pre and post EECP than patients who had or 5 years regarding EF domain Q3 and Q4 Considering the global efficacy question overall satisfaction and angina there were significant improvements of post EECP in patients with 5 years than in patients with or 5 years duration of IHD
