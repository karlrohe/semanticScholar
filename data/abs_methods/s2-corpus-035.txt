 2414736492,OBJECTIVE,Squamous cell carcinoma SCC of the rectum is rare but as with anal cancer risk may be increased among immunosuppressed individuals We assessed risk of rectal SCC in HIV infected people  
 2414736492,METHODS,We utilized the HIV AIDS Cancer Match a linkage of US HIV and cancer registries 1991 2010 to ascertain cases of anal SCC rectal SCC rectal non SCC and colon non SCC We compared risk in HIV infected persons with the general population using standardized incidence ratios SIRs and evaluated risk factors using Poisson regression We reviewed cancer registry case notes to confirm site and histology for a subset of cases  
 2414736492,RESULTS,HIV infected persons had an excess risk of rectal SCC compared with the general population SIR 28 9 95 CI 23 2 35 6 similar to the increase for anal SCC SIR 37 3 Excess rectal SCC risk was most pronounced among HIV infected MSM SIR 61 2 Risk was not elevated for rectal non SCC SIR 0 88 or colon non SCC SIR 0 63 Individuals diagnosed with AIDS had higher rectal SCC rates than those with HIV only incidence rate ratio 1 92 95 CI 1 08 3 42 Based on available information one third of rectal SCCs were determined to be misclassified anal cancer  
 2414736492,METHODS_DIFF,We utilized the HIV AIDS Cancer Match a linkage of US HIV and cancer registries 1991 2010 to ascertain cases of anal SCC rectal SCC rectal non SCC and colon non SCC We compared risk in HIV infected persons with the general population using standardized incidence ratios SIRs and evaluated risk factors using Poisson regression We reviewed cancer registry case notes to confirm site and histology for a subset of cases  

 2081842514,OBJECTIVES,To test for specific mutations in the alanine glyoxylate aminotransferase AGT gene in order to diagnose primary hyperoxaluria type 1 PH1  
 2081842514,DESIGN AND METHODS,Samples of liver and or DNA from 81 patients were submitted to our laboratory for diagnostic testing for PH1 Using a panel of selected mutations DNA was examined in 64 cases of which 36 had the diagnosis of PH1 confirmed by liver AGT assay DNA sequencing was employed if mutation testing revealed only one mutation  
 2081842514,RESULTS,Identification of 100 of the mutations in the AGT confirmed samples led to the development of a focused testing panel currently involving 4 common mutations 7 mutations recurring at lower frequency and 5 with apparent ethnic associations  
 2081842514,CONCLUSIONS,This mutation panel alone would have identified the two causative mutations in 64 of the PH1 samples
