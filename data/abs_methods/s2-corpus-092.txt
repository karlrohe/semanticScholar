 2117220038,BACKGROUND AND AIMS, Human red flowers are traditionally considered to be rather unpopular with bees yet some allogamous species in the section Oncocyclus genus Iris Iridaceae have evolved specialized interactions with their pollinators a narrow taxonomic range of male solitary bees The dark red tubular flowers of these irises are nectarless but provide protective shelters i e a non nutritive form of reward primarily to male solitary bees Apidae Eucerini that pollinate the flowers while looking for a shelter An earlier study on orchids suggested that species pollinated predominantly by male solitary bees produce significantly larger amounts and larger numbers of different n alkenes unsaturated cuticular hydrocarbons Whether or not this also applies to the Oncocyclus irises and whether pollinators are attracted by specific colours or scents of these flowers is unknown  
 2117220038,METHODS,Using Iris atropurpurea recording of pollinator preferences for shelters with different spatial parameters was combined with analyses of floral colours by spectrophotometry and scents by gas chromatography mass spectrometry to test the hypotheses that a pollinators significantly prefer floral tunnels facing the rising sun floral heat reward hypothesis and that b flowers pollinated predominantly by male solitary bees produce significantly larger amounts and larger numbers of unsaturated cuticular hydrocarbons n alkenes in their floral scent preadaptation to sexual deception hypothesis  
 2117220038,KEY RESULTS,Male bees do not significantly prefer shelters facing the rising sun or with the presence of high absolute relative amounts and numbers of n alkenes in the floral scent  
 2117220038,CONCLUSIONS,The results suggest that the flowers of I atropurpurea probably evolved by pollinator mediated selection acting primarily on floral colours to mimic large achromatic bee black protective shelters used preferentially by male solitary bees and that pollinator visits are presumably not the result of an odour based sexual stimulation or motivated by an increased morning floral heat reward in tunnels facing the rising sun

 2088413359,BACKGROUND,Annual coronary angiography ANG to assess for significant epicardial coronary artery disease CAD is an integral part of follow up care for pediatric cardiac transplant recipients at Children s Hospital Boston Exercise stress echocardiography ESE is an important non invasive tool for the detection of ischemia in adults but has been rarely used in children Therefore the aim of this study was to assess the feasibility and utility of ESE in excluding ANG detected epicardial CAD at our center where ESE has been implemented since 2007  
 2088413359,METHODS,We conducted a retrospective review of all pediatric cardiac transplant recipients at our institution who had undergone ESE and ANG between January 2007 and December 2010 and with testing performed 12 months apart ESE results were compared against ANG  
 2088413359,RESULTS,The study cohort comprised 47 cardiac transplant recipients One patient s ESE images were inadequate for interpretation Of the remaining 46 patients ESE had a sensitivity of 88 9 95 confidence limits CL 51 8 99 7 a specificity of 91 9 95 CL 71 8 98 3 and a negative predictive value of 97 95 CL 85 1 99 1 for the ANG detected CAD  
 2088413359,CONCLUSIONS,This large single center study showed ESE was feasible and had a high specificity and excellent negative predictive value in excluding epicardial CAD in pediatric cardiac transplant recipients Future prospective large scale studies are needed to confirm these findings and help identify a subset of children for whom a negative ESE could decrease the frequency of routine ANG

 2972773976,BACKGROUND,The epidemic of nonmedical use of prescription opioids NMUPOs has been fueled in part by the availability of leftover legitimately prescribed opioids In children outpatient urological procedures are among the most common surgeries performed but data are lacking to guide appropriate postoperative opioid prescribing The aim of this study was to compare the amount of prescribed opioid medication to the amount taken for acute pain after minor pediatric urological surgery and to determine the disposition of excess opioid In addition we explored whether distinct patient characteristics and procedure type influenced opioid prescribing and consumption  
 2972773976,METHODS,Of the 139 families of pediatric patients enrolled 115 were interviewed within 48 hours and or 10 14 days of discharge to determine the amount of opioid prescribed and consumed duration of treatment and disposition of unconsumed opioid  
 2972773976,RESULTS,The most common procedures performed were circumcision n 58 and orchiopexy n 40 Most patients 98 were male and 77 were 8 years of age All opioid prescriptions were for oxycodone dosed every 4 hours as needed PRN Median number of doses prescribed was 30 interquartile range IQR 23 31 n 138 for both respondents who reported doses remaining IQR 29 31 n 83 and those who did not IQR 22 32 n 55 Among those reporting doses remaining median number of doses consumed was 4 2 IQR 0 14 Multivariable linear regression showed no significant association between doses consumed and patient age type of procedure discharge pain score or use of adjuvant analgesics Median duration of opioid therapy was 2 days IQR 0 5 n 83 with each additional day of opioid use corresponding to an average increase in consumption of 2 3 doses 95 confidence interval CI 1 8 2 8 An estimated 75 95 CI 69 81 of opioid dispensed was not consumed and 86 72 83 of patients took 18 doses Forty four of 65 68 families reported receiving no disposal instructions for leftover opioid and only 7 families disposed of leftover medication  
 2972773976,CONCLUSIONS,For minor pediatric urological surgeries in young boys a 3 day supply 18 doses of opioid was sufficient to adequately treat acute postoperative pain in most patients Adjusting opioid dispensing to align with consumption and better educating patients and families on opioid disposal can be used to potentially decrease availability of leftover opioids in homes and communities
