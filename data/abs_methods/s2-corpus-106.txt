 2910387938,BACKGROUND,The experience of discrimination is common in individuals with mental health problems and has been associated with a range of negative outcomes As yet however there has been an absence of research on this phenomenon in adults with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ADHD The current study examined the association between ADHD symptoms and mental health discrimination in the general adult population  
 2910387938,METHODS,The analytic sample comprised 7274 individuals aged 18 and above residing in private households in England that were drawn from the Adult Psychiatric Morbidity Survey 2007 Information on ADHD was obtained with the Adult ADHD Self Report Scale ASRS Screener A single item question was used to assess mental health discrimination experienced in the previous 12 months Logistic regression analysis was used to examine associations  
 2910387938,RESULTS,The prevalence of discrimination increased as ADHD symptoms increased but was especially elevated in those with the most severe ADHD symptoms ASRS score 18 24 In a multivariable logistic regression analysis that was adjusted for a variety of covariates including common mental disorders ADHD symptoms ASRS   14 were associated with almost 3 times higher odds for experiencing mental health discrimination odds ratio 2 81 95 confidence interval 1 49 5 31

 1975390687,OBJECTIVES,Covered stents have been proposed as an endovascular option for recalcitrant cases of hemodialysis related central venous occlusive disease CVOD This study evaluated the efficacy and durability of covered stents in treating CVOD to preserve a functional dialysis access circuit  
 1975390687,METHODS,A retrospective review was performed of all patients with clinically significant CVOD who were treated by placement of covered stents from April 2007 to September 2010 Demographics lesion locations and anatomic characteristics stent graft and access patency rates were determined Complications reinterventions and factors influencing their outcomes were examined  
 1975390687,RESULTS,In 25 patients 56 men mean age 57 29 years with CVOD covered stents were used in 20 to treat symptomatic venous hypertension or in 5 at the time of access creation to enable functionality The target lesion was accessed via the dialysis access site or the common femoral vein The Viabahn endoprosthesis W L Gore and Associates Flagstaff Ariz was used in 24 patients average size and length 11 mm 5 cm and a 13 mm 5 cm Fluency covered stent Bard Peripheral Vascular Tempe Ariz was implanted in 1 patient Technical success was 100 and resolution of arm edema occurred after covered stent deployment in symptomatic patients Two postprocedural cases 8 of thrombosis occurred one within 30 days and another at 3 months Both required percutaneous thrombectomy and percutaneous transluminal angioplasty PTA Three additional patients 12 required PTA due to restenosis in one of the ends of the device Covered stent primary patency PP assisted primary patency APP and secondary patency SP were 56 86 and 100 at 12 months respectively Access patency rates at 12 months were 29 85 and 94 for PP APP and SP respectively in patients that received a covered stent for access salvage patency rates were 74 85 and 94 for PP APP and SP respectively in patients in whom the access was created after the venous outflow restoration  
 1975390687,CONCLUSIONS,Placement of covered stents for hemodialysis related CVOD is safe effective in relieving symptoms and enabled functionality of new dialysis access circuits Further prospective and randomized studies are necessary to determine whether covered stents provide superior long term results to those achieved with PTA and bare metal stents
