 2165996061,BACKGROUND,There are very few data on the prevalence of coagulation abnormalities in primary deep vein thrombosis of the upper limbs  
 2165996061,OBJECTIVE,To determine if coagulation abnormalities play a role in effort related and or idiopathic non effort related upper extremity deep vein thrombosis UEDVT  
 2165996061,METHODS,Fifty one consecutive patients 21 men and 30 women who had effort related n 20 or idiopathic n 31 UEDVT over an 18 year period median age at diagnosis 32 years age range 15 86 years were routinely reexamined Plasma was screened for antithrombin protein C and protein S deficiencies and for antiphospholipid antibodies lupus anticoagulant and anticardiolipin antibodies The DNA was screened for factor V Leiden and for prothrombin gene G20210A mutations  
 2165996061,RESULTS,The median age 35 vs 28 years the proportion of women 81 25 31 vs 25 5 201 the proportion of patients with a personal and or family history of thromboembolism 42 13 31 vs 15 3 20 and the proportion of patients with at least 1 coagulation abnormality 42 13 31 vs 15 3 20 were higher in the idiopathic UEDVT group than in the effort related UEDVT group The odds ratio of having a coagulation abnormality was 4 09 95 confidence interval 0 99 16 78 P 06 in the idiopathic UEDVT group compared with the effort related UEDVT group  
 2165996061,METHODS_DIFF,Fifty one consecutive patients 21 men and 30 women who had effort related n 20 or idiopathic n 31 UEDVT over an 18 year period median age at diagnosis 32 years age range 15 86 years were routinely reexamined Plasma was screened for antithrombin protein C and protein S deficiencies and for antiphospholipid antibodies lupus anticoagulant and anticardiolipin antibodies The DNA was screened for factor V Leiden and for prothrombin gene G20210A mutations
