 2169621419,METHODS,The patient was a 64 year old white man who had a slight increase in volume in the left side mandible with a radiolucent osteolytic image with the destruction of the mandibular cortex Incisional biopsy and preoperative examination were performed including cone beam CT and examination by immunohistochemistry that defined the histologic diagnosis of leiomyosarcoma The patient underwent reconstruction with an osteocutaneous flap with microvascular anastomosis  
 2169621419,RESULTS,Two years after the surgery there was no sign of recurrence of the lesion
