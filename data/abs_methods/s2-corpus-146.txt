 2273911371,BACKGROUND,HIV clinical trials are vitally important for improving knowledge about medications and their impact on the pathogenesis of HIV AIDS African Americans are disproportionately underrepresented in HIV clinical trials  
 2273911371,METHODS,A 49 item survey was administered to 145 patients at an urban HIV clinic to explore race and HIV clinical trial participation  
 2273911371,RESULTS,Study participants were 56 Caucasian 19 other 16 African American and 13 Hispanic Fewer African Americans had been asked to participate in a trial compared to other groups 8 vs 24 p 05 African Americans were less likely to volunteer for a trial compared to Hispanics and Caucasians but African Americans did not differ significantly in their willingness participate in clinical trials vs other racial groups In a regression model age past trial participation monetary gain and comfort with the clinical setting predicted willingness to participate in a trial across racial groups p 05

 2534265545,METHODS,The study used data from a place randomized trial of the Promoting School Community University Partnerships to Enhance Resilience model for delivery of evidence based substance misuse programs for middle schoolers Three level within person regression models were applied to four waves of survey and social network data from 636 adolescents followed from sixth through ninth grades  
 2534265545,RESULTS,When adolescents in control school districts had more symptoms of depression they believed more strongly that substance use had social benefits perceived higher levels of substance misuse among their peers and friends and had more friends who misused substances although they were not more likely to use substances themselves Many of the positive associations of depressive symptoms with peer related risk factors were significantly weaker or not present among adolescents in intervention school districts  
 2534265545,CONCLUSIONS,The Promoting School Community University Partnerships to Enhance Resilience interventions reduced the positive associations of adolescent symptoms of depression with peer related risk factors for substance misuse

 2417133148,MATERIALS AND METHODS,The sample of 515 12 year old children was randomly selected by conglomerate analysis The children were clinically evaluated DMFT index bleeding on probing and DAI index and asked to complete the questionnaire about family environment self perception of health status oral health related quality of life OHRQoL and school questions in Child Perceptions Questionnaire CPQ11 14 A questionnaire about socioeconomic status and perceptions about their children s health was sent to the parents School performance was measured  
 2417133148,RESULTS,In a multivariate logistic model the following variables remained statistically significant when associated with adolescents poor school performance in the final model number of people living in household household overcrowding parental perceptions about their children s oral health presence of carious lesions and a question from CPQ11 14 about difficulty in paying attention in class because of their teeth lips jaws or mouth  

 1866826474,PATIENTS AND METHODS,Eighteen patients with advanced assessable GI malignancies 16 colon one pancreas and one gastric previously treated with conventional chemotherapy but no pelvic radiation received 20 mg of COL 1 labeled with 131I with doses from 10 mCi m2 to 75 mCi m2 In this cohort the baseline serum CEA level ranged from 6 to 2 739 ng mL mean SD 500 639  
 1866826474,RESULTS,Nuclear imaging detected at least one tumor site in all 18 patients 82 of all tumor involved organs were positive and 58 of all lesions or 1 0 cm were detected Immune complexes were detected in 89 of patients 5 minutes after completion of infusion and levels correlated with CEA levels r 71 Elevated CEA 500 ng mL and tumor bulk total tumor area 150 cm2 correlated directly with clearance of serum radioactivity and inversely with serum half life and cumulative serum radioactivity parameters Nonhematologic toxicity was mild and non dose limiting Hematologic toxicity particularly thrombocytopenia was both dose related and dose limiting The maximal tolerated dose is 65 mCi m2 The correlation between dose millicuries per square meter and thrombocytopenia was made stronger by accounting for either variation in pharmacokinetics or variation in serum CEA and tumor bulk
