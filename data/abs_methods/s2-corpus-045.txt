 1976109474,MATERIALS AND METHODS,A total of 63 1 stage delayed repairs of complete posterior urethral ruptures in 60 men with at least 1 year followup were reviewed Two ruptures were due to gunshot wounds and 58 were secondary to a pelvic fracture There were 58 repairs done by the perineal approach and 5 required an abdominal perineal approach  
 1976109474,RESULTS,Surgical complications included 2 3 rectal injuries 3 5 repeat strictures that required reoperation and 20 32 repeat strictures that required dilation or visual internal urethrotomy By 1 year after surgery all patients had a patent urethra and did not require further treatment At 1 year 43 72 patients voided normally 5 8 3 were areflexic and performed self catheterization 5 8 3 had urge incontinence and 5 8 3 had mild stress incontinence requiring no treatment Moderate stress incontinence responded to imipramine in 1 case and collagen injection in 1 Of the patients who were potent preoperatively 31 52 remained potent postoperatively Of the 29 48 patients who were impotent preoperatively and immediately postoperatively 9 regained potency at 1 year However at 1 year the quality of erections of the 40 potent men was normal in only 22 37 and fair to poor in 18 30  
 1976109474,CONCLUSIONS,The 1 stage delayed bulboprostatic anastomotic urethroplasty has a good long term result with little morbidity for treatment of posterior urethral ruptures in men
