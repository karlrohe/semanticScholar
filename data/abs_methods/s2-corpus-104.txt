 2367596697,OBJECTIVE,To investigate the function of human dentin phosphoprotein DPP on dentine mineralization in vivo  
 2367596697,METHODS,Pulp capping with human DPP was made in the permanent teeth of minipigs with calcium hydroxide and zinc oxide eugenol cement as controls The minipigs were sacrificed at intervals of 14 30 90 days respectively after operation  
 2367596697,RESULTS,The histopathological results revealed that pulp cells had developed into odontoblastoid cells around the major restorative dentin body after two weeks There was complete restorative dentin bridge a month later The bridge became thick and dense and mainly was tubular dentin in 3 month There were well developed odontoblasts under the bridge In the calcium hydroxide capping group inflammatory cytonecrosis zone was found in the surface of dental pulp and only a little calcial bodies formed in two weeks Complete restorative dentin bridge was formed in 1 to 3 months the speed of dentin bridge formation was not as quick as that of DPP group
