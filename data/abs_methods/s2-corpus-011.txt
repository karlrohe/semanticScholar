 2003692593,BACKGROUND AND AIMS,Acute variceal bleeding is the most common lethal complication of liver cirrhosis A meta analysis was conducted to compare the outcomes of transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt TIPS to those of medical endoscopic therapy for acute variceal bleeding in cirrhotic patients  
 2003692593,METHODS,The PubMed EMBASE and Cochrane Library databases were searched for all relevant comparative studies Odds ratios OR and hazard ratios HR with 95 confidence intervals CI were pooled for dichotomous and time dependent variables respectively Subgroup analyses were performed according to the type of study design randomized or nonrandomized studies source of bleeding esophageal or gastric varices type of stent covered or bare stent and patient selection high risk or unselected patients  
 2003692593,RESULTS,Six papers were eligible TIPS was superior to medical endoscopic therapy in decreasing the incidence of treatment failure OR 0 22 95 CI 0 11 0 44 improving overall survival HR 0 55 95 CI 0 38 0 812 and decreasing the incidence of bleeding related death OR 0 19 95 CI 0 06 0 59 Although TIPS did not significantly decrease the incidence of rebleeding OR 0 27 95 CI 0 06 1 29 it became significantly greater in the subgroup meta analyses of randomized studies OR 0 09 95 CI 0 03 0 32 than in those of nonrandomized studies OR 0 76 95 CI 0 40 1 45 subgroup difference P 0 003 and in the subgroup meta analyses of studies including high risk patients OR 0 06 95 CI 0 01 0 23 than in those including low risk patients OR 0 83 95 CI 0 44 1 56 subgroup difference P 0 0007 In addition TIPS did not significantly increase the incidence of posttreatment hepatic encephalopathy OR 1 37 95 CI 0 63 2 99  
 2003692593,CONCLUSIONS,With the exception of the benefit of prevention from treatment failure TIPS with covered stents might improve the overall survival of high risk patients with acute variceal bleeding

 2883903291,METHODS,Resting state data from 89 right handed subjects were downloaded from the Parkinson s Progression Markers Initiative database Subjects included 12 older healthy controls OHC 42 PD patients without speech impairment PDN and 35 PD subjects with speech impairment PDSI Subjects were assigned to PDN and PDSI groups based on the Movement Disorders Society Unified Parkinson s Disease Rating Scale MDS UPDRS Part III speech item scores 0 vs 1 4 Whole brain functional connectivity was calculated for four basal ganglia seeds in each hemisphere putamen caudate external globus pallidus GPe and internal globus pallidus GPi For each seed region group averaged connectivity maps were compared among OHC PDN and PDSI groups using a multivariate ANCOVA controlling for the effects of age and sex Subsequent planned pairwise t tests were performed to determine differences between the three groups using a voxel wise threshold of p   0 001 and cluster extent threshold of 272 mm3 FWE 0 05  
 2883903291,RESULTS,In comparison with OHCs both PDN and PDSI groups demonstrated significant differences in cortical connectivity with bilateral putamen bilateral GPe and right caudate Compared to the PDN group the PDSI subjects demonstrated significant differences in cortical connectivity with left putamen and left GPi PDSI subjects had lower connectivity between the left putamen and left superior temporal gyrus compared to PDN In addition PDSI subjects had greater connectivity between left GPi and three cortical regions left dorsal premotor laryngeal motor cortex left angular gyrus and right angular gyrus  
 2883903291,CONCLUSIONS,The present findings suggest that speech impairment in PD is associated with altered cortical connectivity with left putamen and left GPi

 2044641159,OBJECTIVE,To determine the efficacy and safety of glucocorticoids GC colchicine nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs NSAID interleukin 1 IL 1 inhibitors and paracetamol to treat acute gout  
 2044641159,METHODS,We searched MEDLINE EMBASE and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials to September 2011 Randomized controlled trials RCT or quasi RCT in adults with acute gout that compared GC colchicine NSAID IL 1 inhibitors and paracetamol to no treatment placebo another intervention or combination therapy were included Two authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias Primary endpoints were pain and adverse events Data were pooled where appropriate  
 2044641159,RESULTS,Twenty six trials evaluating GC N 5 NSAID N 21 colchicine N 2 and canakinumab N 1 were included No RCT assessed paracetamol or intraarticular IA GC No RCT compared systemic GC with placebo Moderate quality evidence 3 trials concluded that systemic GC were as effective as NSAID but safer Low quality evidence 1 trial showed that both high and low dose colchicine were more effective than placebo and low dose colchicine was no different to placebo with respect to safety but safer than high dose colchicine Low quality evidence 1 trial showed no difference between NSAID and placebo with regard to pain or inflammation No NSAID was superior to another Moderate quality evidence 1 trial found that 150 mg canakinumab was more effective than a single dose of intramuscular GC 40 mg triamcinolone and equally safe
