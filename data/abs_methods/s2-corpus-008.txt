 1966093224,BACKGROUND,Pancreas transplantation PTx with portal enteric drainage PED has been associated with difficulties in respect to arterial anastomosis and graft accessibility for percutaneous biopsy We describe a new technique that circumvents these difficulties  
 1966093224,METHODS,Between April 2001 and April 2004 a total of 113 recipients were scheduled for PTx with PED The superior mesenteric vein was approached from the right retroperitoneal aspect instead of from the anterior transmesenteric route The pancreas graft was eventually placed in the right retroperitoneal space being covered by the ascending colon and its mesentery  
 1966093224,RESULTS,One hundred ten 97 3 PTx were performed as planned Systemic venous effluent was preferred in three patients because of incidental diagnosis of liver cirrhosis during surgery n 1 and severe obesity body mass index 35 kg m2 n 2 The Y iliac artery graft was kept as short as possible and arterial anastomosis was always performed with ease After a mean follow up period of 21 2 19 9 months the relaparotomy rate was 13 6 No patient died after repeat surgery and none required multiple relaparotomies Overall 10 grafts were lost because of acute rejection n 3 chronic rejection n 2 venous thrombosis n 2 recipient death n 2 and late 6 month arterial thrombosis n 1 One year patient and graft survival were 98 1 and 90 7 respectively  
 1966093224,CONCLUSIONS,Our data confirm that PTx with PED is not associated with an increased risk The technique described has distinctive technical advantages and should be included in the repertoire of PTx
