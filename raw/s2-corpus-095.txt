Adaptability estimates indicated that Giza 80 which yielded below average mean yield over environments are poorly adapted to all environments. However, the promising strain (G.83 x (G.75 x 5844)) x (G.83 x (G.72 x Dandara )) which were above average mean yielding ability had general adaptability or well adapted to all environments. The remaining commercial cultivar Giza 90 and the promising strain (G.90 x Australy) were not significantly different from the average mean performance of all genotypes had average stability. The promising strain (G.83 x (G.75 x 5844)) x (G.83 x (G.72 x Dandara )) which was above average mean performance of all genotypes had stable for seed cotton yield (k/f) and lint cotton yield (k/f). While, the promising strains (G.83 x (G.75 x 5844)) x G.80, (G.83 x (G.75 x 5844 )) x G.85 and (G.83 x (G .75 x 5844 )) x G.90 which were above or below average mean performance of all genotypes had unstable for seed cotton yield (k/f) and lint cotton yield (k/f).

In vertebrates little is yet known on the patterns of PCD and its role during the early phases of development, when embryonic tissue layers migrate and pattern formation takes place. We describe the spatio-temporal patterns of cell death during early Xenopus development, from fertilization to the tadpole stage (stage 35/36). Cell death was analyzed by a whole-mount in situ DNA end-labeling technique (the TUNEL protocol), as well as by serial sections of paraffin-embedded TUNEL-stained embryos. The first cell death was detected during gastrulation, and as development progressed followed highly dynamic and reproducible patterns, strongly suggesting it is an important component of development at these stages. The detection of PCD during neural induction, neural plate patterning, and later during the development of the nervous system highlights the role of PCD throughout neurogenesis. Additionally, high levels of cell death were detected in the developing tail and sensory organs. This is the first detailed description of PCD throughout early development of a vertebrate, and provides the basis for further studies on its role in the patterning and morphogenesis of the embryo.","inCitations":["7660bbde3334117c0a032342c265d65cd379c415","14430c20cf7f23e0679ee335d3e0b1630bf1705e","7b9b75b1010a7ae34205c8a9d7fa873723dad5b2","3b1f9288d85c53da5792184fc1ea1fdb019eaccf","fcadbd7ed46d6923a99bf83344925fb8b12d9382","b5a03946662c3f24a9a2e64fdb941757a6b5794f","43bda25b6233a3c2f2dfa4ef7bca2db5d4301377","ee466a0446919a37f5b04ae5a75203cfbd014772","94ff5af0a7607c5d123e1baf0d3750b1384e40f2","9a63ae698e7e5ad3afe2307044f751409480bcec","58f0e679b8c321a57ad2bc842947aabfb5e51688","26926dc587b63401597bf07eb308d4655beaee46","e85d026475795a67eabf1e82d0ea1240557ec265","b31c99a10f201ce991db62a386892014500f61a3","91d513faf0188fa002da49b933dc42dd98907466","2c47ec03ad0924ed076046d6c0da5cba1430da50","8ced04e502dab07c5cfedfc1fc7a206319722b96","99ab97c84ff85306dc09d2805051b38e50974dc5","4178c0d51eb155bff1dc22f768f9c4a5dbafc9d5","eb5bfadda3ba78bc86b68f609780ec0fa186c75b","d0b31f032fff7811412ed393f8414f1665a7028a","d798449524df1af46e762e06e4f1a50396f364e9","380108a7b22a4674aa218557862f6cbda45032f2","4df4141fb2fcf8cae0fd72c2bddccf3623b0dc53","737d1462cc92c1b20d3614c0cd2e7e10ffd41b0d","9a90b5f3e2e07ab40ffcca47cb1988c334d4ec6e","630846994bd9d19493c312e2af09d747620202c4","a2eae50245fdf3ee7fd9a6447852e78638a34157","12d41d446ccd287db71554587fa00406f67f4133","4a68beab76e3c58f9bbdc20284b43fd711596251","acb64007c332ec75e99d3ccde0df44d35c7a4d8e","0799bef1734a48111dd39847312dc2fc5a44985e","a2c4bb75207a655acfe627b46a44f5b8a3310f70","7ae85a89df472ae3382058fe3efbf96b8a7f76cb","891040040f9a5100c99c6862da7b7725782583e0","70a7b57e743605b65f6ff17bb0ad5d315890f3b7","26982e490f0a8fa87f7934c0579010dd5021c055","af07bbd36cbb5ddc0d61a3a6c7121b1392e850cd","ef5912e67fda35c3e64b4ca0498dd83efcd6a319","50fc526c8c13aeba1eab9088b851b1a3366d2f29","31bb6b158cb36b2b83faf8a260d14627b6cfd436","5144c874e1a0fcabbbd62cf554910350bf51f1d7","26f85da3e888541ede06d09f1423a0c58bb7922b","5c3019b739fb92cee8b49d72de04f171c33f15a4","1ea285b06af140a37ad8987a9f6ba6374abba884","6bd717ed3ccdc111c9a060c9c9b32f93d8a6ab71","549e2dcbaf86eb42ca152075c4dc6c3e88f8f1dc","7ae9d517ee924b8f6d3306c7b5139a7aae4dca23","889564f5085ae9d4ecf8cd49beb172576716c494","cb902acc11a8d42228016473e6cfb76b4b07f63c","101052f8d0fc592ee291ad6236c0c8601ce925f5","e0a83492ef883ffab231868a55ec7eac257f7826","a3c4285b8f1d07463aa3084aa079657fb28c3262","9886f190840ef3efd7a60675baa278afa9ade5b3","4cfd29d61314c7f1e9be88aeb5befda2cec905aa","7d9068d3a6a404e0ddc1ad9443ae8a7980be9c9b","828257e9629b8ac1d85575ec0e60571f7c44c323","f438f34f018538a43596add9f357a39fcef6cd8b","312ea1a5420a9506dbd2152692d48afebf78f527","3210062f8e74de3015ac7d26b7146b37ee1e5e45","abbe9e6ba34d7de24938d5b48c530018892b4bba","027ad4b81ca06eb58b2c1d16b4d5026b59525443","d4526f48d2c7ce7eb60272196ac793e4b8457f99","28c3f50eec82ceb8a29dd904f539db7b1906fac9","5d5d79937a2b160efdd7826b2a3b31e0cccc177c","c4080dc7eae054ad69209b7f0ad1926c9eef9c35","3834f07738420bdcf29352a7b45380495d6eaf65","b9120db0260c606baa8b3741ffa5b050ac329358","25e6e1f746112e4ac0b563a2598165c0a4a446b8","83e9fa36bae4df38498eb8e54c58d4e5a0729d6f","fe3f9559840ef1a6df53677c5b8559ad4538f0d7","3a4feee5b6205d5badb9541e92304b1613a9ebcf","520b1020dacd00045be57d92988e4ce3434b0654","caff80719b78262db54baf2d6541130bccfe26ad","b4dc93c4516f0fe64a917433399eaccbd8c24b3f","b7b9c3e9f9a4af8af626e161ac5f7d56a78e46f7","02810bf1d93cd83b21813ff190366aef776cb1c3","3c815672d5b67fcc431f4258f87fa4776fdfefda","ff36ad9b59ca3d8040280a3785b744df27610671","e4dcb7f8c1ac26da092bc27ac90a34a28a5fb798","7799988500dbeb1635a054818b4dfe8035ba74eb","250b8e62d00c7c3c79eca8177d16b6e1c051f2a6","4dbfc9cf5eaf16b102ad56a3aa49007e7b8f987e","c7c6e8fe2d16f0593a8ea266730a8e39e4c13e4d","3179fdbbf2affd511aa2fe7e2b53c49e404caa73","9a5f63d919e2460d733af8c3aa8165badb8e99df","ca08592b7aede02c994f18bad71c4f5b1b606e2e","8132f46364b41b327379adf15921f00b8931e7eb","9ee3c0a63b4ac639707877d6fd195f1c7e986ce4","a68030c120e1d7081494081cd07674d7f7a221d7","bd4cd9ec7acb2b080665b8669199b98b00cccb91","ed6cb01d13f25e61bec9648f87299b0c92b99033","5809c6157a45636d2ef8532967529552bc25eac9","282dd52bb843b41da5a04df8c729e69f452b1216","213f87506bb719226fe1222e199685b04fc986d0","23f72e48eb530d36804e83bbdf7c2b5a83966354","1367cdabcbcccac06a751da43583584b0eeda26a","96f4f30169bdcd62c7366762190c4ae01527d21b","13c3531446efc2ab3846d47d3f1d013e00c8a233","2ea346b8306980395035c8da69b7e3a16819dadc","1fa9785b4085207f0e55c5cad2ae6e95d6914607","dc60acf59a11ece34332a8d6c0f5b24091b529db","505a0752c04d8db4891809314de1399aecf2ae6e","d9943caae39b0e0dde66fa3f1b85f5fc901ca690","2ef58d5190f1f170e47f079d16b6ea6ef5839ab9","dc5ccf9d086526cdd31d1adbc5c4597c6ef78c18","6eaf92a7829644f3db39755fe83c91c403693e85","e32df5c3facc23207209db3a348dde31b6916ce9","298906699bad5ea7a142f8a2947b4349e57ac187","e3ad4d20a0e14ff2d38b24ba0c149b327cff1816","f643d28c85410ba37759945c238f091eea811bd4","3debec6668db619fd19f0287e92dc918f56846be","7f64dd57f62872f0f26c2cc2a09e3d70b39ad010","0dd7a868b5c7e4c025fac4db8ca345a6e9037449","c4b2006679f4f36c3e7a0a9f07afb28ee524324e","0becb6fc646afdd91ae397ecb075f7

Profes­ sor Kishimoto Hideo, then chairman of the Department, told us about a certain student who wanted to give up his studies of religion. When Professor Kishimoto asked the reason for this, the student replied: “The scientific study of religion practised by our department seems to me to be a science which only crit­ icizes and even refutes its object of research. I cannot be in­ volved in a science that does not involve itself in its object of study.” I do not clearly recall what Professor Kishimoto replied to the student, but do seem to remember that he told us that he felt he had been backed into a corner by the student’s words. I must, at that time, have found it a little hard to agree with either the student’s excuse or the professor’s reply. It was not more than a vague impression of mine, but at that time I myself did not feel that there was any atmosphere in our department of undue criticisms or refutations of religion. Moreover, I thought it a matter of course that one should put some distance from the object of study, since the scientific study of religion and the per­ sonal feelings one might have about religion were two different things, whether one might like this or not. Accordingly, the reply of Professor Kishimoto also seemed to me to be something","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://nirc.nanzan-u.ac.jp/nfile/2238/"],"title":"Sympathetic understanding and objective observation","doi":"10.18874/jjrs.9.1.1982.53-64","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.18874/jjrs.9.1.1982.53-64","venue":""}

Although a common procedure in psychological research, balancing for gender is not a requirement made by the ISO draft.

In Nationaal Landschap ‘Noardlike Fryske Wâlden’ (NFW) wordt in de melkveehouderij een vorm van kringlooplandbouw bedreven die zich onder andere kenmerkt door het voeren van de melkkoeien met een structuurrijk en eiwitarm dieet, minder gebruik van kunstmest, het bovengronds uitrijden van dierlijke mest en de focus op een hogere bodembenutting van stikstof (N) uit dierlijke mest. Bij deze vorm van kringlooplandbouw ligt de focus op levering van ecosysteemdiensten door de bodem, vanuit haar diverse functies. Belangrijke ecosysteemdiensten, waarbij door de bodem een aanzienlijke bijdrage wordt geleverd, zijn de voedsel- en biomassaproductie, de grondwaterkwaliteit, de opslag van koolstof en de regulering van nutrienten. De maatschappelijke doorwerking van kringlooplandbouw is in potentie zeer groot, en de belangstelling vanuit de maatschappij voor deze vorm van landbouw neemt toe.","inCitations":["89a9a70c43a40cf356e46c63b4f65893d9277ebf","e2386809c2ab1ec3faa09afd7355fbe903e14612","c87be2b844f5f83ae9659d87f02e8ec1dd42aef5"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Effecten van kringlooplandbouw op ecosysteemdiensten en milieukwaliteit : een integrale analyse van People, Planet & Profit, effecten op gebiedsniveau, en de potentie voor zelfsturing, met de Noardlike Fryske Wâlden als inspirerend voorbeeld","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

While transfer policies have a large weight policies of a European public good type are neglected. Our contribution explains this inefficient outcome within the framework of a political-economic two-country model adapted from Besley and Coate (2003). The model's modifications integrate crucial features of the EU setting such as income heterogeneity of countries, a GNI dependent revenue formula and the existence of transfer policies in the EU budget besides both local and European public goods. We show that the common pool problem in combination with a budget cap is at the heart of overspending on transfers and underspending on European public goods. On the base of this model we assess different reform options related to the revenue side. We show that the effects of an EU tax depend crucially on the deviation of the specific tax base's redistributive effects from income proportionality. Furthermore, our results point to the advantages of a general but limited correction mechanism.","inCitations":["6cb531cbad2dbd088a36b7e7ddc9c5edb60e6f44","168eb4888dddc11024a67adcce492201d9754f09","a656d3695264b5e6cf7ac9da8c8f4df5b82a6820","28fc0856627be25a84899adf4dcf67bf05fb6697","9a3ce1cd9b55b6073d8d43252e4ac68ea4a7595f","6eb8abf27d69c409d889455e8da59cdfb4a12086","e7b94ee03f0641ab3bccfa9ee2a334dd7cea7b7c","3582c4e0e35361adc9397fb58fb9d3e2a31e332a","8eb962698007dc17e4f043d4d5ed8a567483c8da"],"pdfUrls":["http://aei.pitt.edu/33114/1/osterloh._steffen.pdf"],"title":"EU Budget Reform Options and the Common Pool Problem","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

In 2012, the centenary of his birth was marked in St. Petersburg. Short histories were presented describing some of the main parts of his legacy, which continue in importance today: duality in linear programming, the so-called ‘‘MongeKantorovich transportation problem,’’ and the ‘‘Kantorovich metric.’’ Note that 2012 was also the 70th anniversary of the publication of his historic paper on the transport metric. The present article offers a somewhat expanded version ofmy talk on that occasion.","inCitations":["4aaa9edc4dbbf63a5f8f4753cda736e74d1996c7","91d921a89f347f8bdc68ed4475c7e3fac49a3ea4","576815603c1316cc43b9ef8a23b8c3eb854894e6","bed8a63ac01e728d36fdee8fce8b18d695037ee5","79c95ad360ed6d1ee96be1221d6dd1cc7ddb5321","68034917073ff89684566a178cc8cbbe57aeac61","3876c0d1635d1d9795d1eeeaf466d6395a6e99ab","fb06609e4358852a6280b1b9f41d4e22ea23966a","d0f6ee26db29dd22810f726915850e66ecd4359e","88e7eae454ee33fe6b613d4f1efcd68232203685","6ad8f7ccc3f6ce000fed7e2c5bb108d01f9e2342","53d1a5ae2577f562ecfcffb86e576e6686f68ed6","1123121a6bbe1be6aeca3f649d76f7e718a356b6","9dedef6126695602ab6b32ddb1ebb409f407b76e","a6d5a85cb121e94b96a4f7e42c598ee3d4d59d8b","df6436970e253ef12651e53f00863612579d7d31","f2851cc3415270d6b86df1817dd1f26aca3b6981","b70a5c729d190d12faee5876c0f433201942cc9d","9c02c8a6fb0f4f3206fe866eec3e5768977bfe57","95b3bd1368c582323156173677b46f22a6549cf9","d5ae4d4f8412e87834cfa937854ba9aa0db899dc","66227640a4b670da4f4a06385de41b076cf12c86","bc9fb10c47183bdd044611f3734a38c6531a4436","f31ba9fda7ea4d876f2ce2b5ae3df78b99e74ba8","8ecbc002700080ab72e8674eae316988c9281723","c4a5bb1774f612ddc416793b2c49f383b108a5c6","5e04da2a715a8f6acd1555af1cf606284a8477f5","db658049feac1a1d0fc9f9a400e7a53a245feb6a","49ee23575c941b7ac7f0c694e0001bc0c88bcd51","4bfdb6e43e9fa7c10f609f24daa03f16488beb7f","3afce88c99749768deefd6a25d308c99d4ddef53","2d1904306c6d497a5413c208b39abd7d376df302","e535a87b4db32deae662e0f1d497fdcea0ad3500","fabd7e3d0f31a5931fa426cfc71c13276d0355b8","c93c58088248cf5e0c6308d2014d603806702f61","1b06528564de768e65581c6189ef8c72fca3138d","29ca0fd5d5d66c9c8e4eec00ea20c95edf2ab574","5d99763e9a0dd9bc6e6101b0de8b000c828327cf","e9df863422aac76e3305ababa4fba6506c9acd8f","f69737fcca52d67487da0f66d96a9644d921edb5","eb30b5d4d4ff294823a6db12359ffc49b4769023","abb5cdfb79f21b37e358a89dc0556bbb927fdc99"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Long History of the Monge-Kantorovich Transportation Problem","doi":"10.1007/s00283-013-9380-x","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00283-013-9380-x","venue":""}

Substitution of a methyl group for oxygen in the phosphate ester backbone introduces a new chiral center. Significant differences in physical properties and hybridization abilities are observed between the R(p) and S(p) diastereomers. Chirally pure methylphosphonate deoxyribooligonucleotides were synthesized, and the solution structures of duplexes formed between a single strand heptanucleotide methylphosphonate, d(Cp(Me)Cp(Me)Ap(Me)Ap(Me)Ap(Me)Cp(Me)A), hybridized to a complementary octanucleotide, d(TpGpTpTpTpGpGpC), were studied by NMR spectroscopy. Stereochemistry at the methylphosphonate center for the heptanucleotide was either RpRpRpRpRpRp (R(p) stereoisomer) or RpRpRpSpRpRp (S(p) stereoisomer, although only one of the six methylphosphonate centers has the S(p) stereochemistry). The results show that the methylphosphonate strands in the heteroduplexes exhibit increased dynamics relative to the DNA strand. Substitution of one chiral center from R(p) to S(p) has a profound effect on the hybridization ability of the methylphosphonate strand. Sugars in the phosphodiester strand exhibit C(2)(') endo sugar puckering while the sugars in the methyl phosphonate strand exhibit an intermediate C(4)(') endo puckering. Bases are well stacked on each other throughout the duplex. The hybridization of the methylphosphonate strand does not perturb the structure of the complementary DNA strand in the hetero duplexes. The sugar residue 5' to the S(p) chiral center shows A-form sugar puckering, with a C(3)(')-endo conformation. Minor groove width in the R(p) stereoisomer is considerably wider, particularly at the R(p) vs S(p) site and is attributed to either steric interactions across the minor groove or poorer metal ion coordination within the minor groove.","inCitations":["78941d64ed86ebbc89a2b58e5a749715cfff11cc","0ab889c610bf67cf35576f7b48284c085341675e","cb18c721b41a9dc3228d82c2e049a6934331b103","784e5f627ae8eb9a165b709010318386b6a2a2e0","6b653a23c3f1a7d5daea5c39e7eb36e7a25c2d78","164923c9cdb8874b7ee8cd2f622eef523d016e82","7553115901bedfef671f7e44cf7fbc2f5918d970","a9d4893b61ce9023f7fd72f1d17c5a289f1e1ba4","69fa3cd7400832f4de3d090072eb7769866de547","f75d5d1b9c7fb6009edaabbfac7cd862a9af4e14","d462a0eb66d43da2dcfc12ca16d41bba3278cf1b","e190016ce02195460e809ead80dad181971f3d0d"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Structure of hybrid backbone methylphosphonate DNA heteroduplexes: effect of R and S stereochemistry.","doi":"10.1021/bi011551k","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1021/bi011551k","venue":"Biochemistry"}

Methods: Clinical PET scans from 27 patients with clinically probable AD and early ages of onset (<65 years) were compared to PET scans from 27 age-matched controls presenting with memory complaints, but without dementia or mild cognitive impairment. Results: Compared to controls, the AD patients had significant frontal, temporal and parietal hypometabolism bilaterally, and AD diagnosis correlated with left temporal and right temporoparietal hypometabolism. The sensitivity of temporoparietal hypometabolism for AD was 92.6%, the specificity 85.2%. Conclusion: Clinical PET imaging helps distinguish early-onset AD from patients with memory complaints not meeting criteria for dementia or mild cognitive impairment.","inCitations":["b6b45e44d05988ce4e16fbc7337a9861dab8e4d0","5cc2aad9ec2650b77fb824ea8609b15986be36c2","25114123ded894753f67350949301392fe1b94a4","0597311f4f61dc452cb90d7dd59b36f7d2f84fd3","421c3fc9e44e655de3c3f30366e278bb6ee62e01","cff5b2f3735982add3bc90ac9a287a56d3e1ac3a","dbd748074b1e75d40752f241b2425e2c4ddab214","f7cf652fa0e15ec3825eacbfcf9d5c046034bb0d","b76c71cff5ab3a9710a351bbd3306d087df8f363","504c0b999d88b2b7c78f6713e9f25f0a4b4e3527","076b7b9e80a623a68b2ac4dbd301f5e53a233fbb","8c9d088873dd48005d8abb4b45e5c3051033aa1c"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Positron Emission Tomography Facilitates Diagnosis of Early-Onset Alzheimer’s Disease","doi":"10.1159/000109258","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1159/000109258","venue":"European Neurology"}

This means that forgiveness has been treated as a psychological means which cures both the victims and the offenders and builds reconciliation between them. However, this article deals with the question of forgiveness from the philosophical and theological perspective. Especially, it focuses on the relationship between conditional forgiveness and unconditional forgiveness. To do this, this article deals with the theories of Vladimir Jankelevitch, Jacques Derrida, and Paul Rocoeur on forgiveness. At first, Jankelevitch supports the unditional logic of forgiveness. So he even argues that forgiveness forgives the unforgivable. In reality, however, Jankelevitch maintains that we cannot forgive what he calls \"metaphysical crimes\" such as the death camps by German military power. In those crimes, according to him, we can forgive the wrongdoers only when they confess their faults and ask for forgiveness. Therefore, Jankelevitch comes to an insoluble dilemma between the conditional logic of forgiveness and the unconditional logic of forgiveness. Derrida tries to solve Jankelevitch`s dilemma by arguing that conditional forgiveness and unconditional forgiveness are heterogeneous and indissociable at the same time. However, he goes to the opposite direction of Jankelevitch when he says that the true meaning of forgiveness lies only in the unconditional logic of forgiveness. Thus Derrida argues that forgiveness happens only when one forgives the impossible, i.e. the unforgivable even without any confession. It seems that this radical logic of unconditional forgiveness cannot be easily practiced in a real situation because it does not fully consider the burden of the victims. On the contrary, Ricoeur seems to suggest a proper way which can solve the tension between conditional forgiveness and unconditional forgiveness. Unlike Jankelevitch, he claims that there is and remains forgiveness. Just as there is the superabundant grace of love from God, forgiveness is always for human beings. Pace Derrida, however, Ricoeur rightly argues that there is a limitation to the superabundant grace of \"there is….\" Without human response, the grace of forgiveness cannot be realized in a concrete situation. This means that justice is the necessary condition that makes forgiveness and reconciliation happen. This article comes to a conclusion that Ricoeur`s solution which includes both the superabundant logic of \"there is\" and the reciprocal logic of justice at the same time is an apt way for solving the conflict between conditional forgiveness and unconditional forgiveness.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"조건적 용서와 무조건적 용서의 화해를 향하여","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Most of the techniques have been developed after an intensive experimental process. It is believed that these techniques exploit the underlying structure of industrial instances. However, there are few works trying to exactly characterize the main features of this structure. \nThe research community on complex networks has developed techniques of analysis and algorithms to study real-world graphs that can be used by the SAT community. Recently, there have been some attempts to analyze the structure of industrial SAT instances in terms of complex networks, with the aim of explaining the success of SAT solving techniques, and possibly improving them. \nIn this paper, inspired by the results on complex networks, we study the community structure, or modularity, of industrial SAT instances. In a graph with clear community structure, or high modularity, we can find a partition of its nodes into communities such that most edges connect variables of the same community. In our analysis, we represent SAT instances as graphs, and we show that most application benchmarks are characterized by a high modularity. On the contrary, random SAT instances are closer to the classical Erd\\\"os-R\\'enyi random graph model, where no structure can be observed. We also analyze how this structure evolves by the effects of the execution of the SAT solver. We detect that new clauses learnt by the solver during the search contribute to destroy the original community structure of the formula. This partially explains the distinct performance of SAT solvers on random and industrial SAT instances.","inCitations":["868ade238a4778e3190311275eed6698b7a012a4","b5aa011176caf9a08d619bfec6906882babddceb","3d8cc1bce39bd6c89539670ffbe4b876b0d6f233","8de3bcccc2369b96f9ea1470c3b0627110ac5320"],"pdfUrls":["https://www.jair.org/index.php/jair/article/download/11741/26529/","http://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.03329v2.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1613/jair.1.11741","http://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.03329v1.pdf","http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.03329","https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.03329v2.pdf","https://www.iiia.csic.es/media/publications/JAIR19.pdf"],"title":"Community Structure in Industrial SAT Instances","doi":"10.1613/jair.1.11741","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1613/jair.1.11741","venue":"J.

X-ray spectra show that the composite was more amorphous than the neat matrix, which was attributed to higher equilibrium water content in the composites. TGA confirmed this result and its thermal derivative suggested the formation of hydrogen bonding between glycerol and the nanocrystals. The reinforcing effect of starch nanocrystals was attributed to strong filler/matrix interactions due to the hydrogen bonding. The decrease of the permeability suggests that the nanocrystals were well dispersed, with few filler/filler interactions.","inCitations":["4c7275c1dd95027783fd5e2735663c7ac8148bb7","f9033fe5df1e588f88d74c897e83ec422345d96b","f2a15420ac6e91ca37b8b9ea0297ba77b3975a74","95ecaa679a7e63c1cd9fb7f7965d44eaaecfee5a","0b64507cebd4802463bca88b2bfacadf4ef3106c","3bd38d8b72b6c4ecb88ff91b8480049281eabc52","00f5bd82cc942f4e46fa0c3134b2a0aac27d531a","f81d31804e5ad894add86929c94bd439cd861bdb","aa39828a6b9689e425799d6f99fa5373307b1b4b","ad2bc1afdc93647e162591e81e73388663c38db8","c3cb7c4515ade6b3ad905dac412f3255d126806e","af771d373911b17faf00a8b38ed2ef3ec918e23a","dbe5fa12b1f0f431adf965fe804016140c34f286","f912af335b7f195f96905a386094d2a9412b7396","f15c578c85095ba4e2b2324e102ed495ffa155f0","d7325811f7f8ea1155d829c6b0ed4b146badf791","db199f4bc557ed303ca40a304f985e358f580cfd","9c9645de01ad27f3491338568f85989ab54b3cc1","2e34ce2f187de8e509212e0f3de82bc179340b71","bbd9543d4a8c4ca7efd496529ccef932bd1e66b2","f0eab2c665ad4435ca36e736040ae2ab17802f07","5357fc35c5db0a0823196fe2a2e9801390a4ba5a","3bb190500fa09c2d0ae86216945b7c34c6976d39","1e7666bc8f3a0f036acf66eda44c9713c180ab06","97ddaf3794d31fccb1dedfb8a5482776739d9dd5","376f50eda858c806e36abe870dbceac55c76f3ab","a88215adec2c21e1289373c02c5876f37efb7345","0294289de16e79c2b224ec6cd6e70140bc729964","e259f0e5722087ab9afa86bdf91604a2ba79721b","f3223e68e3f00262f43752bd7c1bde1d65b6ff4a","b1b644e0d4dfe3a60a063a489a548a97f0302d6a"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Physico‐Mechanical Properties of Biodegradable Starch Nanocomposites","doi":"10.1002/mame.200800271","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1002/mame.200800271","venue":""}

En las dos ultimas decadas el uso extendido de barreras no arancelarias y de otras medidas de proteccion han reversado parcialmente el esfuerzo de liberalizacion, en particular para algunos productos agricolas considerados sensibles. Colombia tambien se destaca como el unico pais de America Latina en el que la agricultura tuvo un desempeno mediocre durante la decada de precios altos de los productos basicos, con una politica sectorial enfocada mas en la proteccion que en la provision de bienes publicos. Esto es particularmente preocupante en el contexto del Acuerdo de Paz con las FARC el cual requiere, para ser sostenible, un sector agricola competitivo y de rapido crecimiento. Por supuesto, la politica comercial no ocurre en el vacio, sino que es, mas bien, el resultado de complejas interacciones politicas entre diversos grupos de interes. Para arrojar luz sobre la economia politica de la proteccion de los productos agricolas sensibles en Colombia, en este documento analizamos los casos de arroz y azucar. Ambos estan fuertemente protegidos, pesan mucho en las canastas de consumo de los hogares y forman parte de complejas cadenas de valor agregado. El analisis de fuentes secundarias y de mas de 20 entrevistas semiestructuradas nos permite entender mejor el “por que” de la proteccion comercial. Identificamos ganadores y perdedores y discutimos los canales de influencia de jugadores claves, incluyendo a los productores agricolas y sus organizaciones, la industria procesadora de alimentos, grandes conglomerados economicos, el Congreso, los medios de comunicacion y algunos ministerios altamente politizados. Tambien discutimos los mecanismos de compensacion utilizados en los pocos episodios de liberalizacion que se han llevado a cabo, incluyendo especialmente el TLC con EE. UU. Mostramos que los productores agricolas estan bien organizados, apoyados por grupos de presion como las “Dignidades”, y tienen mas peso politico que millones de consumidores dispersos y que la industria procesadora.","inCitations":["4e256d49a877d130b124cabee9df47d4d08a56e1","6579b9d0fe24062cbf47d2a5d6ee1baea7fd2fc9"],"pdfUrls":["https://www.repository.fedesarrollo.org.co/bitstream/handle/11445/3718/Repor_February_2019_Arbel%C3%A1ez_et_al.pdf?isAllowed=y&sequence=1"],"title":"The political economy of protection of some “sensitive” agricultural products in Colombia","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Assim, esse trabalho relaciona o grau de internacionalizacao com o desempenho das empresas brasileiras e se esforca em explicar como o grau de internacionalizacao pode afetar o desempenho destas organizacoes. Pela teoria esperava-se que quanto maior fosse o grau de internacionalizacao das empresas maior seria seu desempenho, pois a internacionalizacao diversificaria o risco sistematico ao mesmo tempo em que possibilitaria retornos superiores advindos das maiores oportunidades de investimento destas firmas. Para checar se estas suposicoes teoricas seriam validas, tomou-ser uma amostra das empresas brasileiras mais internacionalizadas no ano de 2010, e a partir de analises estatisticas de correlacao e regressao linear simples avaliou-se o grau de associacao e determinacao existente entre o desempenho destas empresas com seus respectivos graus de internacionalizacao. Como principal resultado desta pesquisa tem-se que esta teoria nao se sustenta para o Brasil. Nao foi encontrada uma associacao positiva e uma determinacao significativa entre grau de internacionalizacao e desempenho. Os resultados dos coeficientes de correlacao e o R quadrado da regressao linear simples entre as variaveis grau de internacionalizacao e desempenho foram proximos de zero.

Methode La methodologie utilisee, proposee par la Societe francaise de medecine physique et de readaptation (Sofmer), associe une revue systematique de la litterature, un recueil des pratiques professionnelles et une validation par un panel pluridisciplinaire d'experts. Les criteres d'analyse concernent les deficiences et l'incapacite fonctionnelle, les donnees medicoeconomiques et les complications postoperatoires. Resultats L'analyse de la litterature ne permet pas de recommander la prescription systematique de kinesitherapie chez les patients ayant la possibilite de rentrer directement a domicile apres pose d'une PTG. Il existe cependant quelques arguments suggerant qu'elle peut faciliter la recuperation musculaire et fonctionnelle (mais pas la mobilite). Suivant les pratiques professionnelles francaises des chirurgiens et des specialistes en medecine physique et de readaptation, il peut donc etre utile de prescrire une serie de kinesitherapie chez ces patients surtout dans un objectif d'amelioration fonctionnelle. Conclusion Des etudes de bonne qualite methodologique sont necessaires pour definir des criteres d'indication de la prescription de kinesitherapie ambulatoire apres la sortie du service de chirurgie concernant les patients qui verifient les criteres d'orientation vers une sortie directement a domicile, et pour evaluer les programmes les plus efficaces.","inCitations":["db838088761e41ed72e35a227fd424b688b25bd8"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Intérêt d'une prescription de kinésithérapie ambulatoire à la sortie du service de chirurgie après la pose d'une prothèse totale de hanche ?

While rTMS is safe and has documented short-term efficacy, durability of antidepressant effects is poorly established.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nAssess existing evidence regarding durability of rTMS-induced antidepressant response.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe performed a systematic review of studies reporting antidepressant outcome measures collected three or more months after the end of an induction course of rTMS for depression. Among responders to the induction course, we used a meta-analytic approach to assess response rates at 3 (m3), 6 (m6) or 12 (m12) months after induction, and studied predictors of responder rates using meta-regression.\n\n\nRESULTS\nNineteen studies published between 2002 and 2018 were included. Eighteen were eligible for analysis at m3 (732 patients) and m6 (695 patients) and 9 at m12 (247 patients). Among initial responders, 66.5% sustained response at m3 (95% CI = 57.1-74.8%, I2 = 27.6%), 52.9% at m6 (95% CI = 40.3-65%, I2 = 0%), and 46.3% at m12 (95% CI = 32.6-60.7%, I2 = 0%), in the absence of any major bias. Random-effects meta-regressions further demonstrated that a higher proportion of women, as well as receipt of maintenance treatment, predicted higher responder rates at specific time-points.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nrTMS is a durable treatment for depression, with sustained responder rates of 50% up to 1 year after a successful induction course of treatment. Maintenance treatment may enhance the durability of the antidepressant effects of rTMS, and should be considered in clinical practice, as well as systematically explored in future clinical trials.","inCitations":["2d6b6872421f91cd6a73c98974e1a7f8b5311144","2000c5126bb280e8c5246521b9ffa1a3fa0f5bfe","b7a39c4b7fcf38b69587274e4dd441a084fc287d","ae8c2ad45f52d3f81c84c9359b069bca07463211","03485af9786eba6f0c3f5e78ddd0e609173dd699","ebe413ccaf3108f2d09582d45c3f9e6985bf3947"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.tmslab.org/publications/845.pdf","https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1935861X18303206","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1935861X18303206?dgcid=api_sd_search-api-endpoint"],"title":"Durability of antidepressant response to repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation: Systematic review and meta-analysis","doi":"10.1016/j.brs.2018.10.001","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.brs.2018.10.001","venue":"Brain Stimulation"}

All of the patients had been operated on through either an extended iliofemoral incision or a modified extended iliofemoral incision. The prophylactic radiation was administered using a low-dose protocol; most of the patients received 1,000 rads in 200-rad increments, starting on the third post-operative day. The incidence of heterotopic ossification in the eighteen irradiated limbs was much lower than in the twenty patients who comprised the control group (50 per cent compared with 90 per cent). Only two of the irradiated limbs had Class-3 heterotopic ossification as described by Brooker et al., and no patient had Class-4 (ankylosis of the hip). Of the twenty control-group patients, ten had severe heterotopic ossification: Class 3 in seven and Class 4 in three. The difference in the incidence of severe (Class-3 or 4) heterotopic ossification between the two groups of patients was significant (p less than 0.01).","inCitations":["505c2fb60d77aa609ff798f6db6efd4a7d3e3d2e","fb3fa2abc693019d97621aa9f517db4c17285f03","634ef1d868927196973d673894865fb52279168e","f5714b60ffe9222ef597bcc189263772ed080d3c","afda3cff95827f65806d10d24ef1a253786a1a2e","85025ed09eadd4b3b1ed1ac78af22a5e506106a2","2813a4205ad93112d302365d797a3207f62ba7f9","bbd48fd6f650eac9faf104bb9770ecda77c053ae","7f710d02e2884941bc0014d6db771ca2310a5736","a46a07a422678b7ce3321fab09dfed0ec1afb54c","838105ceb6e4db05a2638b4c9677f1dd6dcf81d4","9f0832d9bbf5264e074331ed354d96c4bda43d8a","cba7247ff26ea71bfaffd26eb7bb37063fca47db","0c8ccfbb7d6d3355c79cafb52302bd34e3f48ad7","fa6fe0378b47b9d88b1d4d642f130fe682b4f54a","55ec9abbbe4ba2f945537b8c8a3331f3abd7b716","7c45eefcefe0949ff659333071ed82b3e894fb15","e0b7c0918b8d9039b716145f53c377b6530329bd","466e8cb3ea0f197621144ba19257616eee73d831","d5232a99f19f9f4c5b2cb1274b66772759a3be66","2f90de279521676bf61c7f816713aa79513610c2","d506cd4aa269a93b62f328cc7226f7cdc2c46858","02c1fdc5a805693e03f12ce3b9334b7f407f7bd2","53a2a002b41b0d44bf3ed3f4aab975bf84f7d136","ebac001b9d4ab44182bc8b62c350f8186f14ab50","ea1459190a6798c29a8947214a14d9af27a9a03f","a5b4b12867bdce2602f481cfde131c6d02d0c237","a26407d9dbfdec9ab2eba6f2870e8b6514756e3f","5578770329ab0a79c810d55e26a1a20737925d53","b8b3201525a78c047b9f5453147a81eb6de9f0dc","98a82473feba2279dc364bab78a51ac51ff3ba93","64643e8bddaa3ce3153f654d520241673f458641","1bdc43368d0a1f5da8874f58ed257b5768789f37","3d1a888146473b0ca4305fba47d050071524d1d5","742808496ae06653f1eec0de76b6228de1a69a3a","7948dd07ae7d0748eb211ac4efac26d60e5df947","6b51d683e7b840693d51c73267feb8fa8698ec50","6a678c93a6d57c9b922dad3c7b96d536e5843c73","307c35a90929a8f78b03f34b296adcab1c99c3b7","ef90d7d0254e4e3bafd89476afac38316d622385","6c6f94637da638f56122754776e7feda7adf32c5","92f75f450f684124dd34aa8d48943c8b69c4b210","6806b51f74380e9a4da37f0be5afee1ec6c4c7d2","46140a14c74c797ab06d6db505508cb753287e30","a33b5208378f8b2b90a1870f053fd9f061fd474c","220e7bf837beb4e894599070cfc7693e083b31d1","4829a2db1a2e9bc732d9cfda11872e04b7654d26","bfef13d7ab2527144bfb3029a5000ee4d4a32460","6e8d8e94980525fd71090151c515869a5251c6e4","47e40872d8365022cc423324210d6251d6323e84","2b21f4d6335a806ff98902d0cfa3210ff8c6487d","db7323c70e5e8b9d2ac0b083e438b56ae6995dde","2753c5afde608a0b453b0d8dd5d1b44830b2f1e2","1473b6e7d7fc6554a5f4fcd6ab5106a2d71c9e8d","26be5d008718a15a08ac3b0a87a32874895d722d","82c6751b4bfee06d16d947f6a472c2082422f882","f241e9c0682f5a54d0614ff4803a014ace624039","a09edb1048a3c9ee75847d22992179101a1885fa","dd8ef377d78c0b070a04e58834ddb68a7e5bbb46"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Heterotopic ossification as a complication of acetabular fracture.

Lynx dispersed back to Croatia after six animals were reintroduced to Slovenia from Slovakia in 1973. Today, lynx is under legislative protection in Croatia and its population is defined as highly endangered. Cranial morphometry was used to analyse a sample of 58 skulls obtained from animals of the reintroduced population in order to identify geographical variation, sexual dimorphism and sex-linked cranial characters. Eighty-five cranial measurements were recorded from each skull. Males were significantly larger than the females in 39 of the 85 cranial measurements, whereas only one measurement, the postorbital constriction, was greater in females. Our research indicates that lynx from Croatia is more similar to lynx from Czech than the ones from Norway. No evidence was found for differences in cranial measurements between the Croatian reintroduced and the Balkan autochthonous lynx population, so there is not a reason to define the later population as a separate subspecies, Lynx lynx martinoi ssp.","inCitations":["79733636dce3caffeb1f41acd5015e7c2500b514","545219e28f1060652729c451e69492cb10034f25","c44c81711aceef9a77576beed6c82b2f7d9c26db","35a484f66373cadcf08a721a31c456bde576eede","f6c4445276ed2ae181a6023c1211c01f9493be17"],"pdfUrls":["http://hrcak.srce.hr/file/88427","http://www.vef.unizg.hr/vetarhiv/papers/2010-80-3-6.pdf"],"title":"Cranial morphometry of the Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx L.) from Croatia","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

We found that the QWIP capacitance displays unusual behavior as a function of voltage and frequency, deviating far from the constant geometric capacitance value. At high voltages, capacitance starts with a negative value at low frequencies, increases above zero with frequency, and eventually decays to the geometric capacitance value. The magnitude of negative capacitance exceeds the geometric capacitance by more than two orders of magnitude. Negative capacitance arises when the transient current in response to a voltage step is nonmonotonic with time. Simulation shows that this effect is due to nonequilibrium transient electron injection from the emitter resulting from the properties of the injection barrier and inertia of the QW recharging processes.","inCitations":["e335fc7662fb1d457160d22fc661655109f00fa6","6681dc7fbe535b5b57d5aefb0e6b7b0ca09bf38f","ce99bca4193f03665181d56a9714e9a112617b46","11e4285f7f46def4ee0d2bc24a9078eea39cf922","e1d1c9ab9bb05351a36463ce11dbd38cb19930d5","790bba6ccb4ff1dd6f994b331694a08f9c2f7a9c","2f7fe109edb0ceb35ae897a45782535853aea932","28e4e6b3b738cb769dd298c72c10516081d1441c","ecf9ee45d75d22ef60b854187df29a26b6159b87","7e55bddac4a54f5e8bf9394f85ba5e072db79f01","d3b4c2c4ce3f9286483a5c52b46089b0af4c8040","138c135b75b473c96640d890dbe9d8e2bcc99852","7bdcdf0f1d85c698c8c22c1778a84a105426deb2"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Unusual capacitance behavior of quantum well infrared photodetectors","doi":"10.1063/1.118704","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1063/1.118704","venue":""}

A device was attached to the wheelchair frame so that casters with different diameters could be used. With platform testing of static stability, the occupied wheelchair equipped with casters with diameters of 10.2, 20.3, 25.4, and 33.0cm, tipped at mean (+/- 1SD) angles of 23.8 degrees (+/- 1.3 degrees), 25.2 degrees (+/- 1.4 degrees), 26.1 degrees (+/- 1.4 degrees), and 28.2 degrees (+/- 1.9 degrees), respectively. The relationship between static stability (y, in degrees) and caster diameter (x, in cm) can be expressed by the equation y = 23.5-.0196 chi + .00484 x2 (p = .0001). Dynamic stability was tested by having subjects descend a 5 degree ramp, by gravity alone, from progressively farther up the ramp until a full forward tip occurred (footrests contacted the floor) when the wheelchair struck a 5-cm-high obstruction with sufficient speed. The mean tipping speeds for the dynamic tests were .85 (+/- .08), .85 (+/- .08), .89 (+/-.07), and 1.04 (+/- .14) m/sec for the wheelchair fitted with the caster diameters ranging from smallest to largest, respectively. The relationship between dynamic stability (y, tipping speed in m/sec) and caster diameter (chi, in cm) can be expressed by the equation y = .788 + .0139 chi-.00110 chi 2 + .0000276 chi 3 (p = .0001).

The results of this study found that there are several views on the interpretation of Islamic accounting ideology. The fragile philosophical foundation of context knowledge is enough to create counter paradigm rivals as a consequence of the scientific revolution (science revolutions) in the form of an alternative paradigm shift due to the failure of the old paradigm to answer a set of problems.

In a cross-sectional study involving 220 lactating women (LW), equally distributed in economic quintiles (Q2, Q3, Q4), we investigated whether habitual dietary intake of LW differed from that of 200 pre-pregnant women (PPW) studied using the same methodology. Differences in dietary intake and nutrition sufficiency according to economic status were also investigated. Dietary intake data were collected using 2×24-h dietary recalls and FFQ. Energy, protein, Fe, Ca, Zn and vitamins A and C intakes were calculated utilising local food composition tables and were compared against Indonesian recommendations for adequacy. Energy and protein intakes 25 % of LW. For Q2-LW, this proportion was >50 %, except for protein. LW across all studied economic quintiles approximately doubled their vegetable intake, and 71 % of LW indicated a belief that this enhances lactation performance. Biochemical status parameters were analysed in a subset of forty-five women. Anaemia as well as Fe, Zn and Se deficiencies were prevalent among LW, supporting the nutrient intake deficiency data. Despite increasing intakes in LW compared with PPW, habitual diets in the study area do not provide for daily nutrient requirements in substantial proportions for both LW and PPW across all investigated economic groups.","inCitations":["9e6f29c0eb8defc7b7c44c4bebf936ebf74fbc70","b54b453c10515664aa73d31147ef11aab070d8df","3dfc8d56e0136e939caa51f2c8029fa539af6042","533e26b5df6044802542e85e5aa46600e356e838","5d0a24f379e08ea75ec924b64d98f3d7f038e04b","fff5bfa89c8861655fb698388f81b945169225fb"],"pdfUrls":["http://repository.ipb.ac.id/bitstream/handle/123456789/82153/ART2016_SMD_1.pdf?isAllowed=y&sequence=1"],"title":"Nutritional status of lactating women in Bogor district, Indonesia: cross-sectional dietary intake in three economic quintiles and comparison with pre-pregnant women.","doi":"10.1017/S0007114516001306","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1017/S0007114516001306","venue":"The British journal of nutrition"}

Aims: The objectives are to measure the compliance to the provisions of COTPA which bans the tobacco sale to and by the minors, prohibits sale within 100 yards distance of an educational institution, and an overall compliance to guidelines of \"Tobacco-free educational institutions.\" Methods: Using a pretested observational checklist, a cross-sectional survey was conducted between January and March 2013 across 1227 point-of-sale and 1408 educational institutions in four districts in India in 2013. Requisite ethical and administrative approvals were taken. Results: The study found moderate to low compliance to the provisions of COTPA regarding the ban on sale of tobacco products, to and by the minors, and around educational institutions. Tobacco products were easily accessible to minors in 57.7% of tobacco shops. The mandatory signages under Section-6 (b) of COTPA were not displayed in less than half of the educational institutions. In nearly one-fifth, tobacco products were being sold in and around 100 yards of institute′s boundary. More violations pertaining to Section-6 (a) and 6 (b) were reported in district Jhunjhunu (representing Western India) and district Dhar (representing Central India), respectively, as compared to other jurisdictions under study. The tobacco-free institution guidelines were being followed by most educational institutions of Ernakulam district (representing South India). Conclusions: The present study observed a low compliance with enforcement of Indian tobacco control legislation. Thus, monitoring for compliance of policies and advocacy with policymakers is important for ensuring proper enforcement and preventing youth from initiating into tobacco use.","inCitations":["384fcbebc599e975afa1356ee60d51ecfb5420cf","67b34ef09f647a441577a7677f937e22956279bf","5f15a95a63cb088283e4609ab27e94120daa9a33","a369b016f0ca2465048cca84add35d31d062c7c7"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"How effective is tobacco control enforcement to protect minors: Results from subnational surveys across four districts in India","doi":"10.4103/2468-8827.198583","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.4103/2468-8827.198583","venue":""}

However, two limitations still exist: 1) the lack of support for multi-label classification; and 2) the lack of understanding of the impact of the typical unbalanced datasets on such tasks. In this work, we build three state of the art methods for the task of multi-label classification of toxic content online, and compare the effect of training data size on their performance. The three methods of choice are based on Support Vector Machine (SVM), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long-Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTM), respectively. We conduct learning curve analysis and show that CNN is the most robust method as it outperforms the other two regardless of the sizes of the dataset, even on very small amounts of data. This challenges the conventional belief that Neural Networks require significant amounts of data to train accurate models. We also empirically derive indicative thresholds of training data size to help determine a reliable estimate of classifier performance, or maximise potential classifier performance in such tasks.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://easychair.org/publications/preprint_open/XGmR"],"title":"Detecting Toxic Content Online and the Effect of Training Data on Classification Performance","doi":"10.29007/z5xk","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.29007/z5xk","venue":""}

An ageing population, together with technological advances, means that the year-on-year rise in the total costs of medicines is likely to continue, despite the inevitable budgetary cuts in the wake of the economic downturn. The resulting scarcity of monetary resources necessitates trade-offs, which result in an opportunity cost, that is, the benefits forgone in the choice of one expenditure over others. The notion of opportunity cost is central to the activities of organizations such as the National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE), the Scottish Medicines Consortium (SMC) and the All Wales Medicines Strategy Group (AWMSG), which are charged with making judgements on whether medicines are to be made available to NHS patients. The establishment of evidence-based medicine in the eighties, as the basis for more effective prescribing, was followed in the nineties by a recognition of the importance of value for money considerations for more efficient (cost-effective) prescribing.

Four groups were formed: In control group A, animals received a complete feed mixture (CFM); in the next three groups, animals received a supplemental feed mixture (SFM) and alfalfa silage as chopped (group B), extruded (group C) and pelleted (group D). Alfalfa meal (12%) was integrated into the CFM and rapeseed oil into the SFM (3.75%) and also into the pellets (3%). The broilers consumed up to 30% of silage of their daily dry matter intake. Silage improved the proportion of polyunsaturated fatty acids, mainly n-3. High levels of silage consumption and consequently high ratios of alfalfa/fat in the diets of groups B and C were related to the low content of cholesterol in the meat. Sensory characteristics were not affected and sensory abnormalities were not detected. Alfalfa silage altered the meat colour; however, the yellow intensity (b*) depended on the ratio of fat/silage of the diet. Group D showed the lowest silage intake but the highest b* due to the highest fat/silage ratio of the diets. The applied processes (chopping, extrusion or pelletisation) for the obtainment of silage had no effect on the quality of the meat. The production of organic meat with the mentioned positive characteristics using alfalfa silage for the market is possible.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"How does feeding organic broilers high levels of alfalfa silage affect the meat quality?","doi":"10.1007/s13165-017-0182-x","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s13165-017-0182-x","venue":"Organic Agriculture"}

We previously demonstrated that amphiregulin (Areg) inhibits gefitinib-induced apoptosis in NSCLC cells by inactivating the proapoptotic protein BAX. In this part of the investigation, we studied the molecular mechanisms leading to BAX inactivation. We show that Areg prevents gefitinib-mediated acetylation of Ku70. This augments the BAX-Ku70 interaction and therefore prevents BAX-mediated apoptosis. Accordingly, Areg or Ku70 knock down restore BAX activation and apoptosis in gefitinib-treated H358 cells in vitro. In addition, overexpression of the histone acetyltransferase (HAT) CREB-binding protein (CBP) or treatments with histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors sensitize H358 cells to gefitinib. Moreover, a treatment with vorinostat, a HDAC inhibitor strongly sensitized tumors to gefitinib in vivo. These findings suggest new prospects in combining both HDAC and epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors for the treatment of NSCLC.","inCitations":["cdd04d4fa34a661b2d06862636833bb7d66813e8","7823563dac25287fa19de6a7e8dba3132ebac087","34ab0b33e97637685892e7d0b37d797dfd67f698","834b975a5cb961a02474c5fa6d9aadd8c11560d2","7e3c412beab29c884d74af143ba1b5efeaeb0ee8","c687d41ffb93887a415b686461b2c400e82ee7ed","4b7801341479be66023e84076fae990e93b39295","db6984a9b73b6f9f034f6197cec81391f0fa9672","acfbc54d36c5ee78674b32d803150106e7714e51","bae3979419923249071ef2c4cf66c4760f51488c","7fc3c07eb74e3e5c1cb07d98208ec9f6ebc08cfa","f1c855a810d22216bf67897c2ba0cf0bd5d14eeb","ee04a8ae79164c0f72420a35f1cf32b0aaab9d06","a5ae5c6a29df9f060b42fd483661ba48d2cfd754","c715b1976ae01b95a2b2d4557075eb0547ef9872","cf39e185723487f9ae8d7d6e7cd131f79690bb00","ed84e668dbf9fee055211d1ea264e65096fd31e3","72db7f88343354876dcbe30aab5231c9464e7ea4","b8a28e3ff087c672b70e3e3dc19f3074434b2226","9259ed1a851d606b0ec969b393b42829fbce0a4b"],"pdfUrls":["https://www.hal.inserm.fr/inserm-00425467/document","http://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/docs/00/42/54/67/PDF/acetylation_soumission_mol_ther2.pdf"],"title":"Amphiregulin promotes resistance to gefitinib in nonsmall cell lung cancer cells by regulating Ku70 acetylation.","doi":"10.1038/mt.2009.227","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1038/mt.2009.227","venue":"Molecular therapy : the journal of the American Society of Gene Therapy"}

Iraqi BW could have inflicted horrific casualties on coalition forces, but the war stopped short of the contingency for which Iraq had prepared, predeployed, and preauthorized the use of such weapons: a march on Baghdad to remove the regime. A decade later, the United States is again poised for war against Iraq--this time for the explicit purpose of regime removal. Moreover, it is engaged in a war on terrorism against adversaries who evidently are strongly interested in BW. But the close call of a decade ago, and the concern it generated among senior Gulf War military leaders, do not appear to have translated into substantial improvements to the operational capability of current U.S. military forces to project power and prevail against BW-armed adversaries. Despite the efforts of many committed individuals, large vulnerabilities in the U.S. BW defense posture remain. Technology remains in the pipeline and not on the battlefield. Operational concepts seem founded on the assumption that an adversary would not dare use these weapons or, if he did, that U.S. forces could simply operate around them, as if they were chemical weapons. The present scare seems to have generated even broader high-level concern than did the potential exposure to Iraqi BW 10 years ago. How can this concern be translated into an action agenda that will succeed at reducing present and future threats? How should we understand the risks of BW while the Al Qaeda leadership and anthrax mailer remain at large--and as the prospect of another war against Saddam Husayn looms on the horizon? Our focus here is on the threat of biological weapons to military forces and operations; where appropriate, we sketch out some connections to the BW homeland security challenge. Why So Little Progress? The chronic gap between requirements and preparedness apparently is rooted in a set of myths, widely held among U.S. defense planners, about biological weapons (BW). Myth One: States Lack Interest in Biological Weapons Conventional wisdom holds that biological weapons historically have been of hardly any interest to nations. Defense planners commonly hold that because BW have never been used, they should focus their time, energy, and resources on more evident problems. What is wrong with this view? The record of BW use appears to be fairly slim, although allegations of use are in fact quite numerous. Most incidents remain subjects of dispute, not least because the evidence to prove that such weapons have been used is extremely unlikely to fall into the hands of investigators. These difficult-to-prove allegations include the Yellow Rain attacks by the Soviet Union in the 1970s and 1980s. Also, many in Asia believe that the United States used biological weapons in the 1950s in Korea and China--allegations that are unproven and for which considerable contrary evidence exists. However slim the record of actual use, the record of interest in and work on biological warfare by states is significant. In World War II, all major powers undertook BW preparations. Those who were defeated were compelled to abandon their BW ambitions, but the victors continued their efforts. During the Cold War, East and West pursued BW techniques. In the 1960s, Britain and France, and then the United States, unilaterally renounced biological warfare and destroyed stockpiles of weapons. The U.S. arsenal at the time consisted of weaponized anthrax and a substantial quantity of nonlethal agents, primarily for the attack of agricultural targets in the Soviet Union and China. The Nixon administration abandoned offensive BW in part to sustain the momentum of detente and asked the Soviet Union to follow suit. The bilateral U.S.-Soviet agreement fostered the multilateral Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention, which entered into force in 1975. …","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://www.files.ethz.ch/isn/135130/DH15.pdf"],"title":"Biological Weapons: Toward a Threat Reduction Strategy","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}
