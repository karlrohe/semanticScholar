Consciousness is the sum total of what a subject experiences; in everyday language, it distinguishes a waking man from a man in dreamless sleep. Perception is an essential part of consciousness. Perception consists of stubborn facts and constitutes reality as experienced. This function of perception depends on the activity of receptors that are affected by processes from the physical world. Perception can be defined as the result of processing information that consists of stimulations of receptors under conditions that, in every case, are partially because of the subject's own activity. The term stimulus is defined as physical or chemical influence from outside on a receptor element by which the state of this element is altered in such a way that the nervous processes are conducted to the central nervous system. In the case of a reflex, a motor activity follows immediately; in the case of perception, peculiar central processes are initiated that are correlated with conscious phenomena, percepts, things, events, or situations in the phenomenal world of the subject.","inCitations":["49e5e25bf44f70b0dfb9418d655fbeafd3f692e5","5d833bb587c0c961f53b5986efcbe42f5efbc58b","6fff4f2b2c76bdb643ca2710465e0c24858a278a","9dcca2664f07ad622b58c4be8a3b0c56ed93499e"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Consciousness, Perception, and Action","doi":"10.1016/B978-0-12-161901-5.50014-5","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-161901-5.50014-5","venue":""}

Result: In different types of NSCLC, the highest positive rate of CYFRA21-1, 54.55%(30/55), is found to exist in the patients with squamous carcinoma, while the highest detected rates of both CA125 and CEA appear in the patients with adenocarcinoma. It is suggested in our study that the rate of positive findings may be raised by using combined detection of these three markers, because the rate of positive findings in the combined detection is 81.82(45/55), obviously higher than that for detection of any single marker. The rates of positive findings of NSCLC for the patients with stage Ⅲ and Ⅳ are 89.13%(41/46) and 86.52%(77/89), respectively, higher than 38.46%(5/13) of stage I and 58.82 %(10/17) of stage Ⅱ. Conclusion: It is showed in our study that combined detection of CYFRA21-1, CA125 and CEA may play a complementary role compared with detection of every single marker of them each other, and consequently evidently improves the rate of positive findings of NSCLC. Besides, the rate of positive findings increases along with development of the disease.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Clinical Significance of Combined Detection of CYFRA21-1, CA125 and CEA for Patients with Non-small Cell Lung Cancer","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

The use of immunofluorescence studies showed that the ETA receptor was mainly present at the sarcolemma and cytosolic levels. However, the ETB receptor was present at the sarcolemma and the cytosol, as well as the nuclear envelope membranes and the nucleoplasm. In addition, ET-1 immunoreactivity was seen in the cytosol and the nucleus. Using Ca2+ fluorescent probes such as Fluo-3, Indo 1, and yellow cameleon, as well as confocal microscopy three-dimensional image measurement technique, stimulation of ET-1 receptors at the sarcolemma membranes induced an increase of cytosolic and nuclear free Ca2+ levels. This effect of extracellular ET-1 was blocked by removal of extracellular calcium. Direct stimulation of ET-1 receptors at the nuclear envelope membranes also induced an increase of intranuclear free Ca2+ level. Our results suggest that the stimulation of sarcolemmal Ca2+ influx by ET-1 seems to be due to the activation of ETA and ETB receptors. However, the increase of nucleoplasmic Ca2+ levels by cytosolic ET-1 seems to be mediated via the activation of ETB receptors. Activation of nuclear membranes ETB receptors seems to prevent nuclear Ca2+ overload and may protect the cell from apoptosis.","inCitations":["c65838542bbb8b73b712e107cbf3eb151d6ace1b","0d53e3d6a561667123e1b65e10dd37443c233e27","ae95772789097ba71c54d10ba0b9491e6c45ee62","416503e9b9795dc4b6c6e145c1a77ca802a2eea3","1d90a08b649626be432d9a028b68736f1d624cc8","02045773eaf3b974372e1f138d84964b320239e7","5ac1fd6f8864891d3b46253976b3a2aaa31d4a9f"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Activation of sarcolemma and nuclear membranes ET-1 receptors regulates transcellular calcium levels in heart and vascular smooth muscle cells.","doi":"10.1139/y03-020","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1139/y03-020","venue":"Canadian journal of physiology and pharmacology"}

A state and runtime-aware scheduling framework should be able to dynamically adapt to the fluctuation of the arrival rate of data streams and be aware of vertex states and resource availability. Currently, there is an increasing number of research work focusing on application scheduling in stream computing systems, however, this problem is still far from being completely solved. In this paper, we focus on the state of vertex in applications and the runtime feature of resources in a data center, and propose a state and runtime-aware scheduling framework (Sra-Stream) for elastic streaming computing systems, which incorporates the following features: (1) Profiling mathematical relationships between the system response time and the arrival rate of data streams, and identifying relevant resource constraints to meet the low response time and high throughput objectives. (2) Classifying vertex into stateless vertex or stateful vertex from a quantitative perspective, and achieving vertex parallelization by considering the state of the vertex. (3) Demonstrating a proposed stream application scheduling scheme consisting of a modified first-fit based runtime-aware data tuple scheduling strategy at the initial stage, and a maximum latency-sensitive based runtime-aware data stream scheduling strategy at the online stage, by considering the current scheduling status of the application. (4) Evaluating the achievement levels of low response time and high throughput objectives in a real-world elastic stream computing system. Experimental results conclusively demonstrate that the proposed Sra-Stream provides significant performance improvements on achieving the low system response time and high system throughput.","inCitations":["ec643ad51f2a3c9463caf051337473d2be130fff"],"pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1016/j.future.2019.02.053","http://www.cloudbus.org/~raj/papers/ElasticStreamComputing-FGCS.pdf"],"title":"State and runtime-aware scheduling in elastic stream computing systems","doi":"10.1016/j.future.2019.02.053","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.future.2019.02.053","venue":"Future Gener.

For the first time, we study the mechanism of O-atom transfer to alkenes using the Fe(V)(O) complex of biuret-modified Fe-TAML at room temperature. The second-order rate constant (k2) for the reaction of different alkenes with Fe(V)(O) was determined under single-turnover conditions. An 8000-fold rate difference was found between electron-rich (4-methoxystyrene; k2 = 216 M(-1) s(-1)) and electron-deficient (methyl trans-cinnamate; k2 = 0.03 M(-1) s(-1)) substrates. This rate difference indicates the electrophilic character of Fe(V)(O). The use of cis-stilbene as a mechanistic probe leads to the formation of both cis- and trans-stilbene epoxides (73:27). This suggests the formation of a radical intermediate, which would allow C-C bond rotation to yield both stereoisomers of stilbene-epoxide. Additionally, a Hammett ρ value of -0.56 was obtained for the para-substituted styrene derivatives. Detailed DFT calculations show that the reaction proceeds via a two-step process through a doublet spin surface. Finally, using biuret-modified Fe-TAML as the catalyst and NaOCl as the oxidant under catalytic conditions epoxide was formed with modest yields and turnover numbers.","inCitations":["a639ff3005e282885d5581d34b6f826333cf97ca","742254f172dd879183f0f0d5d615f837d8ca9609","69ba0f14b29283138c84e7095100787b052845d8"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Mechanism of Oxygen Atom Transfer from Fe(V)(O) to Olefins at Room Temperature.","doi":"10.1021/ic503053q","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1021/ic503053q","venue":"Inorganic chemistry"}

The approach to the fast breeder fuel cycle safeguards follows the general safeguards system approach proposed by the IAEA. Objective of IAEA safeguards is the detection of diversion of nuclear material and deterrence of such diversion. To achieve independent verification of material balance accountancy requires the capability to monitor inventory status and verify material flows and quantities of all nuclear materials subject to safeguards. Containment and surveillance measures are applied to monitor key measurement points, maintain integrity of material balance, and complement material accountancy.

Originally the Chinese communists were Universalists who rejected their various rivals’ arguments about Chinese \"particular national conditions\" in order to justify their belief in and application of Marxism in China. In those revolutionary years there was genuine rigor in their intellectual exploration, in spite of Marxist-Leninist dogmatism. The recent embracement of the concept of \"Chinese characteristics\" and attacks on the “universal values”, however, seem to indicate that the universalist position has been abandoned altogether to justify the current political system in a special manner. It remains to be seen whether this effort will succeed in establishing an enduring political ideology for a “rising China” or otherwise quickly vanish into oblivion just as countless ideological catchphrases before it. I. Marxism as “Universally Applicable Truth” IT IS AN AMUSING as well as painful irony that the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) based on Marxism has become eulogists of the Chinese peculiarity, as refutation of Chinese exceptionalism was an intrinsic part of the development of the CCP itself and Marxism itself in China. Originally, as an alien political party and alien ideology imported to China from abroad, both the CCP and Marxism had to justify their relevance to China on the basis of universalism rather than Chinese exceptionalism. The birth of the CCP and Chinese Marxism was a by-product of the historical process of “learning from the West” by progressive Chinese during the modern times, although a combination of extraordinary circumstances led to the shift from “learning from the West” to “taking Russia as a teacher” (Mao, 1969, 1359-1360). The founders of the CCP and Chinese Marxism, Chen Duxiu陳獨秀(18791942) and Li Dazhao李大釗( 18891927), in particular, were typical Universalists. Chen Duxun insisted that “learning by definition is an instrument of humankind without difference between the past and the present or the difference between China and foreign countries. Only those who understand learning in this way are qualified to talk about learning. Precisely because there is no such a difference, the only criterion to evaluate learning is its quality, regardless of its origin in any country any time” (Chen, 1984, 259).

A prospective study was conducted to identify the factors leading to high mortality in children with DKA in South India. This was a study of 118 episodes of DKA among children, admitted in a pediatric tertiary care center at Chennai. Clinical presentation, laboratory parameters at admission, parameters during treatment, and complications were considered as risk factors. All children were followed up till discharge from hospital or death. Univariate and multivariate analyses for risk factors were undertaken. Altered sensorium and higher osmolality at admission, delayed diagnosis, cerebral edema, shock, renal failure, and sepsis were the major risk factors associated with mortality in multivariate analysis. Cerebral edema was encountered in 23.7 %, shock in 12.7 %, sepsis in 11 %, and renal failure in 9.3 %. The overall mortality rate was 11 %. Delayed diagnosis may be the root cause for high mortality in children with DKA in developing countries. There is an urgent need to create awareness among physicians, teachers, and parents to avoid a delay in diagnosis and decrease the mortality in children with DKA. Higher incidence of cerebral edema, shock, renal failure, and sepsis are unique problems identified in this study. There is a need for further studies on fluid management of shock, strategies for management of renal failure in DKA, and use of antibiotics in DKA in developing countries.","inCitations":["9f38c3a64a6e33ee85a724a86b90378a32b51a46","eaf95c33e7739a41d4622a453b8afdd1e311689f","b3d94513cada049bfd5144e84010afb7eeae88e4"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Factors associated with mortality in children with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) in South India","doi":"10.1007/s13410-015-0441-x","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s13410-015-0441-x","venue":"International Journal of Diabetes in Developing Countries"}

Considerable variation was observed in numbers of species and individuals at the four sites, and abundances within species varied widely. Temporal changes in species abundances appeared to be related to freshwater inflow patterns and resultant salinity variations in the estuary. The 1982-83 winter season was extremely wet, with heavy freshwater inflow to the bay from January through March, whereas the 1983-84 winter was closer to a normal pattern, with most rainfall occurring from November through January. Species were grouped into four categories depending on their patterns of abundance during the two-year period. Species that showed an abundance peak in the North Bay in 1983 only were Corophiwn sp.B and a Chironomidae larva, apparently responding to the extended period of lowered salinity throughout spring and early summer. Species with an abundance peak only in 1984 included Corophiwn acherusicum, Eteone californica, Nereis sucdnea, and Grandidierella japonica, typical estuarine species that might have been suppressed during the extended freshwater inflows in 1983. Species with peaks in both years were Gemma gemma and Ampelisca abdita in the South Bay; both showed strong seasonal variations. A number of species in both North and South Bays, including dominant members of the intertidal community such as Macoma bahhica and Streblospio benedicti, did not show any consistent seasonal or year-to-year trends. Results of this study suggest that the intensity and timing of freshwater inflow to San Francisco Bay, particularly higher-than-normal inflow during late spring and early summer, may be an important factor in determining the composition of the intertidal benthic communities.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://pubs.usgs.gov/of/1987/0387/report.pdf"],"title":"Temporal variations in the benthic communities at four intertidal sites in San Francisco Bay, California, 1983-85","doi":"10.3133/ofr87387","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.3133/ofr87387","venue":""}

Single-phase system inherently requires the handling of energy variation at twice the output frequency through an energy buffer, referred to as decoupling capacitor; such buffer traditionally consists of an electrolytic type capacitor which presents limited lifetime, reducing system reliability. The presented technique makes use of the impedance reflection effect in the high-frequency link transformer through an additional ripple-power converter, an adequate commutation scheme is proposed for the switches of the additional converter to manage the energy variation; without adding extra circuitry for modulation and control of the added converter. An analysis and estimation of losses in the proposed system are presented showing that the inclusion of the ripple-port converter, with proper switching devices selection, in comparison with conventional electrolytic decoupling solution allows to extract the available input power and does not significantly affects the efficiency of the system.","inCitations":["a56017a7dab2fad2a4f4f7894d8fbdbe426e9920","ec1bcceebb30b6a988ee59dade87741c1c42c760"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Decoupling capacitor minimization in HF-link single-phase cycloconverter based microinverter","doi":"10.1016/j.solener.2014.04.013","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.solener.2014.04.013","venue":""}

As a specific ligand for the sialyllactose (SL)-binding proteins on granulosa cells, we used a radioiodinated multivalent SL-linked albumin (Alb-(SL)17). The specific association of the ligand to the putative proteins on the intact cells was competitively inhibited by GM3 more effectively than other gangliosides, sialyllactotetraosylceramide, sialylneolactotetraosylceramide, and several glycoproteins with N-linked oligosaccharides. However, the proteins had no specificity for the side chain (N-acetyl or N-glycolyl forms) of sialic acid in GM3. Scatchard analysis of Alb-(SL)17 binding showed high (Kd = 6.4 x 10(-10)M) and low (Kd = 3.1 x 10(-8)M) affinity population of binding sites. By direct binding of 125I-Alb-(SL)17 to SL-binding proteins on Western blots, the putative proteins with molecular masses of 35, 18, and 14 kDa were detected. The interaction of the multivalent derivative with these binding proteins was differently modulated by Ca2+ and Mn2+. The SL-binding proteins occurred in immature granulosa cells and progressively decreased during differentiation, whereas their endogenous ligand GM3 increased. These results indicate that relatively low molecular weight SL-binding proteins exist on the surface of immature granulosa cells and that they may serve as receptor sites for newly synthesized GM3 during differentiation.","inCitations":["911238a13cdeea0da249a43fd0961064607127e6","c9fa091bb4a50425b2022b3c27fcff6220ee71a8","feba6cacaa54e11c12b7ddaa4d8a1efd21ec5f9a","9bd03d343419d1b7587bbf56edab543be383e2b2","42d66ccd314c008ab24bb49476bf4a486d82d67e","bf2544c83bc1c90bdbfebe2e746e557208373275","f25a944afe6304039b28840bfcbf414fd88341e4","dc162c325a944861c0d944c76983a1e58ba46500","df484ecaaf8b85ba568fb5b9d32b1811f940e384"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Sialyllactose-mediated cell interaction during granulosa cell differentiation.

Central to this process is the availability of a stromal cell product--the cytokine interleukin-7 (IL-7). We recently showed that IL-7, in addition to protecting cells from apoptosis, drives the cell cycling of lymphocytes through regulation of the stability of the phosphatase, Cdc25A, a key activator of cyclin-dependent kinases (cdks). IL-7 achieves this by controlling the activity of p38 MAP kinase (MAPK), which can phosphorylate Cdc25A, triggering its degradation. Sustained expression of Cdc25A had diverse effects: it promoted cell cycling, even in presence of cell cycle inhibitors such p27Kip1, and prevented cell shrinkage in response to cytokine deprivation. Herein we show a role for Cdc25A as a transducer of cytokine-driven proliferation and discuss novel implications for cell growth from the perspective of the requirements for maintenance of lymphocyte homeostasis.","inCitations":["2982176089b78759d1729f0ce74ab44b3f6919d7","94c547a299a0d2349e5516685a70a92ca8051904","baeef0cabc7cc4eebbe514b25a9f153ee5d2c0da","d2f426b0024fbc920f00953805196a13a5122c71","d637916135ca8c9c3a5f80ecec5254a44159c4c9","aa24001ffb895469890b484bb199d45272ddab07","92e06d6aac07f71c85d79380b8a0872c78058008","c68b3336fd55448ccb6a32ba0cb5d8fc5c5f007f","0dfac52fd30e475bccc66c13a57aacd6a2ab7034","6f00e17a63bc227c4b9b37091940135e8166e7a2","500e7ddb71bb65dac621f37e2a40d2c8bb7a9b48","6e3ce8be554db0e3f6b47adb51eabcd20df3d65e","d86c92b285dbca795dd08950f3b2385a8d192044","7135e81eba5b2efb9ef561662097b35211b4a788"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Cell cycling through Cdc25A: transducer of cytokine proliferative signals.","doi":"10.4161/cc.5.9.2693","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.4161/cc.5.9.2693","venue":"Cell cycle"}

In this study, we examined the effects of chronic administration of second-generation antipsychotic drug ziprasidone on CRF mRNA expression in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of rats with or without immobilization stress. Methods: The rats were subjected to immobilization stress 2 h/day for 3 weeks. The effect of ziprasidone (2.5 mg/kg, 21 days) on CRF mRNA expression was determined using in situ hybridization of tissue sections from the rat hypothalamic PVN. Haloperidol (1.0 mg/kg, 21 days) was used for comparison. Results: Haloperidol increased the expression of CRF mRNA in the PVN under basal conditions, whereas ziprasidone had no effect. Chronic immobilization stress increased CRF expression. The chronic administration of ziprasidone prevented the increase in CRF mRNA expression caused by immobilization stress. Conclusions: These results suggest that ziprasidone may have a regulatory effect on the stress-induced CRF mRNA expression and a role in the treatment of depressive mood symptom.","inCitations":["18060773f4e93f54461372e399b5432d342142ad","df594fca8b1d6f86fb88ad82e3a3b3abaf593335","9e79179912d6105f27c61848a8d503b0aa8455b6","2cd0cc5c686e343fc8c1afa6fa0b29e722542f9a","12a231bbe454b34a4be26cfef964147972049e46","446f8ca11e34c349b743122be4d846ada8442f29","3aa300b5b1b017f34882d1cbd3d8b37ab13d3aee","51914da7ee0be27b26d142c88a8edba9fa556a9d"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.mentalhealth.kr/publication/files/1@ziprasidone.pdf","http://www.mentalhealth.kr/publication/files/zipra-crf.pdf"],"title":"Differential Effects of Ziprasidone and Haloperidol on Immobilization-Stress-Induced CRF mRNA Expression in the Hypothalamic Paraventricular Nucleus of Rats","doi":"10.1159/000322288","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1159/000322288","venue":"Neuropsychobiology"}

Clinical diagnosis in the first 9 cases had been: olivopontocerebellar atrophy (3 cases), atypical Parkinson's disease (2 cases), Shy-Drager syndrome (2 cases) and multiple system atrophy (1 case); one of the patients could not be included in any of the above mentioned groups. The oligodendroglial inclusions were argyrophilic and located in the cytoplasm around the nucleus. They were revealed by Bodian's method in all cases of multiple system atrophy. They were not found in the case of autosomal dominant olivopontocerebellar atrophy. They were labelled by anti-ubiquitin antibodies, and were negative with anti-tau antibodies. At electron microscopy, they consisted of rectilinear profiles coated with a fuzzy material (diameter: 20-33 nm); this aspect was compatible with microtubules. Oligodendroglial inclusions were prominent in regions selectively vulnerable in multiple system atrophy (tegmentum pontis, putamen, inferior olives, substantia nigra and cerebellar white matter), even in those areas where neuronal loss or fascicular atrophy were minimal or absent. They were also observed in regions considered to be spared in multiple system atrophy, such as the motor cortex and the corpus callosum. Argyrophilic oligodendroglial inclusions are an early and specific marker of multiple system atrophy. It is suggested that autosomal dominant olivopontocerebellar atrophy lacking oligodendroglial inclusions does not belong to multiple system atrophy.","inCitations":["d75c0fdf0f009f56585f2f9d18bc30b5a6ea6ffd","44483ed2e9466097161c193b94add5e3e849c44b","8f0b69d71383b7ff81c17c03364b997ae7b973e9","c66248640fa2bd2ab20a3f3e080016fc2660ab4d"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"[Oligodendroglial inclusions, a marker of multisystemic atrophies].","doi":"","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"Revue neurologique"}

Whether low-dose exposure to inorganic mercury from dental amalgam has this effect in humans is one of the issues related to the concept of oral galvanism and is supported by results of animal studies. This study explored some cellular immune factors (B- and T-lymphocytes, T4, T8, monocytes, neutrophilic, eosinophilic, and basophilic granulocytes, and large unstained cells) and some humoral immune factors (immunoglobulins IgG, IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4, IgA, IgM, IgE, albumin, alfa-1-antitrypsin, orosomucoid, haptoglobin, and antinuclear antibodies) in 41 healthy 15-y-old schoolchildren. The relationship between these factors and amalgam fillings and mercury concentrations in plasma (P-Hg) were investigated. A low, but significant correlation (r = 0.40, p < .05) was found between the number of amalgam surfaces and the P-Hg values, which were low for both sexes (median value = 1.8 nmol/l). There was no significant influence of the number of amalgam surfaces or P-Hg on the immune factors tested, except random findings. The girls had significantly higher values of T8, IgG, and IgG1 than the boys.","inCitations":["472aac48666d8a44a44dc4893cd6b3ab45a3cbc2","85088f7c5e4f9ae84debc9b2ea15bafa9a1e4468","fe3980142ef633589d431f6096b798f79d791ef3","240747ede7a46d5f40563ff8bb4fe9947f08bc9f","93362a5a3c9397dfa27f198e286fdc16dcec0aaa","7db8bfa7e9d6ce9010dba9da905b1fdf245207ec","8ea812e19fed468805f4b048583a5ff3ae2248eb","46c62ee386166d01903b2a614dacf650bb9e0ad9","f6a5bb1aa5c9c040a681d02c1f60bf556234cd47"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Immune factors, dental amalgam, and low-dose exposure to mercury in Swedish adolescents.","doi":"10.1080/00039896.1994.9940376","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1080/00039896.1994.9940376","venue":"Archives of environmental health"}

Property-oriented concept lattices are basic structures used in formal concept analysis. In general, a property-oriented concept lattice may contain overlapping clusters and is not to be a tree construction. Additionally, tree-like classification schemes are appealing and are produced by several clustering methods. In this paper, we present necessary and sufficient conditions on input data for the output property-oriented concept lattice to form a tree after one removes its greatest element. After applying to input data for which the associated property-oriented concept lattice is a tree, we present an algorithm for computing property-oriented concept lattices.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Characterizing trees in property-oriented concept lattices","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

In this paper, we investigate the dynamic hybrid flow shop scheduling problem and propose a dynamic differential evolution algorithm. In the algorithm, the search space shifts as new jobs arrive, and the problem is solved on a moving horizon based on the real-time information, after the new schedule is established, we update the current schedule.

CtsR-dependent gene regulation systems were demonstrated in Oenococcus oeni. A better understanding of Oenococcus oeni stress adaptive response mechanisms should play an important role in screening of highly tolerant strains, mastering the characterization of malolactic starters and rationalizing industrial processes of preparing wine malolactic starter.

The aims of this study were to investigate the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and pharmacokinetics (PK) of PEP02 in combination with 5-FU and LV, in patients with advanced refractory solid tumors.MethodsPatients were enrolled in cohorts to receive PEP02 from 60 to 120 mg/m2 (dose expressed as the irinotecan hydrochloride trihydrate salt) as a 90-min intravenous infusion on day 1, followed by 24 h infusion of 5-FU 2,000 mg/m2 and LV 200 mg/m2 on days 1 and 8, every 3 weeks.ResultsA total of 16 patients were assigned to four dose levels, 60 (three patients), 80 (six patients), 100 (five patients) and 120 mg/m2 (two patients). DLT was observed in four patients, two at the 100 mg/m2 dose level (one had grade III infection with hypotension and grade III hemorrhage; the other had grade III diarrhea and grade IV neutropenia), and two at the 120 mg/m2 dose level (one had grade III diarrhea and grade IV neutropenia; the other had grade III diarrhea). The MTD of PEP02 was determined as 80 mg/m2. The most common treatment-related adverse events were nausea (81%), diarrhea (75%) and vomiting (69%). Among the six patients who received the MTD, one patient exhibited partial response, four patients had stable disease and one showed progressive disease. Pharmacokinetic data showed that PEP02 had a lower peak plasma concentration, longer half-life, and increased area under the plasma concentration-time curve from zero to time t of SN-38 than irinotecan at similar dose level.ConclusionsThe MTD of PEP02 on day 1 in combination with 24-h infusion of 5-FU and LV on days 1 and 8, every 3 weeks was 80 mg/m2, which will be the recommended dose for future studies.Trial registrationThe trial was retrospectively registered (NCT02884128) with date of registration: August 12, 2016.","inCitations":["b3090dc896f60818943e7fb8d90379911a2be342","a9a9d15c634d930e81e3f9e8253255518bd16318","9429283d9a4299d7351024cec5e8f8facab8d4ed"],"pdfUrls":["https://bmccancer.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s12885-016-2933-6"],"title":"A phase I dose-escalation study of PEP02 (irinotecan liposome injection) in combination with 5-fluorouracil and leucovorin in advanced solid tumors","doi":"10.1186/s12885-016-2933-6","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12885-016-2933-6","venue":"BMC Cancer"}

Lambs of 0-1, 2-3, 5-6, 8-9, 11-12 weeks of age, were placed for one week on a pasture experimentally contaminated with eggs of T hydatigena. The lambs were allowed to suck their mothers from birth. About half the lambs up to three weeks of age were free from larval tapeworms at autopsy; the rest had only a small number of cysts. Some of the lambs grazed on the pasture at or after five weeks of age, became heavily infected. The light infections in the very young lambs could have resulted from either a limited contact with eggs or from passively transferred antibody or, more likely, from a combination of these factors. The high cyst counts observed in some of the older lambs were consistent with the ingestion of eggs in clusters. The rise in the total cyst counts was concomitant with increasing pasture intake. The higher survival rates for the cysts found in the older rather than the younger animals were compatible with the waning before five weeks of age of colostrum-derived antibody.","inCitations":["18f12a8c0e1821948022e5eed8649497ba8786cb"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Factors regulating tapeworm populations: the changing opportunities of lambs for ingesting the eggs of Taenia hydatigena.","doi":"10.1016/S0034-5288(18)33376-9","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/S0034-5288%2818%2933376-9","venue":"Research in veterinary science"}

However, because each stakeholder perceives the world a little differently, conflicts can arise and the problem solving process can be hijacked. To overcome this, a common reality, or principle, needs to be created, which is by definition a causal relationship that works the same way regardless of the observer. Traditional problem-solving strategies (linear thinking; categorization, storytelling, root cause analysis) are reviewed. The Deepwater Horizon Accident Investigation Report is discussed as an example of using causal factors analysis but failing to present the causal relationships. Examples of storytelling from the Deepwater report are also discussed. A RealityChart derived from the Deepwater report is presented to illustrate the shortcomings of storytelling compared with a causal analysis. The principles of cause and effect are discussed in the context of effective problem solving. Seven steps to effective problem solving are outlined.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"A Principle Based Problem Solving Process","doi":"10.1016/B978-0-12-386045-3.00010-6","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-386045-3.00010-6","venue":""}

But, according to Michael Butterworth, such favorable rhetoric belies baseball s complicity in the rhetorical construction of a world defined by good and evil. \"Baseball and Rhetorics of Purity\" is an investigation into the culture and mythology of baseball, a study of its limits and failures, and an invitation to remake the game in a more democratic way. It pays special attention to baseball s role in the reconstruction of American identity after September 11, 2001. This study is framed by a discussion that links the development of baseball to the discourses of innocence and purity in 19th-century America. From there, it examines ritual performances at baseball games; a traveling museum exhibit sponsored by the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum; the recent debate about the use of performance-enhancing drugs; the return of Major League Baseball to Washington, D.C., in 2005; and the advent of the World Baseball Classic in 2006. Butterworth argues that by promoting myths of citizenship and purity, post-9/11 discourse concerning baseball ironically threatens the health of the democratic system and that baseball cannot be viewed as an innocent diversion or escape. Instead, Butterworth highlights how the game on the field reflects a more complex and diverse worldview, and makes a plea for the game s recovery, both as a national pastime and as a site for celebrating the best of who we are and who we can be.\"","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Baseball and Rhetorics of Purity: The National Pastime and American Identity During the War on Terror","doi":"10.5860/choice.48-3935","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.5860/choice.48-3935","venue":""}

The contraction of the latter results in thoraco-abdominal volume variations in order to provide enough amount of air available, the operating volume (OV), to be expelled. We hypothesized that posture and OV could influence muscular activation and thoraco-abdominal displacements during voluntary cough. In 10 healthy subjects, we measured the surface electromyography (sEMG) activity of 7 muscles (scalene, sternocleidomastoid, parasternal, intercostal, diaphragm, external abdominal oblique and rectus abdominis) in supine and seated position during cough maneuvers performed at 4 different operating volumes measured by opto-electronic plethismography: TLC, FRC and two volumes between TLC and FRC. The amplitude of sEMG signals resulted maximal at TLC (p 0.05) and by the other OV. Thoraco-abdominal volume variations during cough were unaffected by posture and OV as well, being predominantly thoracic (see figure in which only two representative muscles are shown for simplicity). Our results suggest that voluntary cough motor mechanism activates a synergetic antagonistic contraction of inspiratory and expiratory muscles leading to a specific thoraco-abdominal pattern, in which the rib cage is the predominant compartment.","inCitations":["394b20fdb6128a727f3a4a834e872027eeca6e9a"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Respiratory muscle activation and action during cough","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

In case of Histories , it is difficult to explicitly define how much of it is history and how much is literature. Nevertheless, it is certain that Histories are a special kind of storytelling, which, as shown by a closer analysis, is based on a personal and vicarious experience of the historian and his oral sources that cover several dozens of years of conflict between the East and the West, intertwined with historical, geographical and ethnological descriptions of Greek and barbaric tribes. In such a context the paper will focus on presenting a twofold nature of Herodotean discourse, revealing, on the one hand, the “rising” of the oral history from the sheer activity of dialoguing with people about the recent past, reconstructed on the basis of its formal and cognitive structure (Fludernik 1996), and, on the other hand, the technique of emplotment (White 1973) used by Herodotus to make the story reportable and tellable within the realm of an epic convention which was vivid and influenced the Archaic and Classical Greek literary texts of his times.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://czasopisma.tnkul.pl/index.php/rh/article/download/1097/1213"],"title":"Historiē by Herodotus of Halicarnassus – theoretical issues","doi":"10.18290/rh.2015.63.3-3","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.18290/rh.2015.63.3-3","venue":""}

When analyzing the results of the regression, we find that variables such as the area of residence, sympathy for specific political parties, approval of the government, trust in political parties and the evaluation of the representative function of the Peruvian Congress have significant impact over the dependent variable. This type of exploratory study is especially helpful in a country in which political elites need the tools to strengthen their relationship with citizens. 1 Marylia Cruz es egresada de la especialidad de Ciencia Politica y Gobierno de la Pontificia Universidad Catolica del Peru (PUCP).
