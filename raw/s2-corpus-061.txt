We exploit these features and demonstrate SLIM's ability to perform topography at a single atomic layer in graphene. Further, using a decoupling procedure that we developed for cylindrical structures, we extract the axially averaged refractive index of semiconductor nanotubes and a neurite of a live hippocampal neuron in culture. We believe that this study will set the basis for novel high-throughput topography and refractometry of man-made and biological nanostructures.","inCitations":["c4efd78ef10aaef8d1f95615e11b142f4c784d08","1a2d36d1319794d9e8f9240e72a359e78fe9a0a2","93f150ebf781f48a581eb6e0e2d8badb1413ea0b","fb303e9ef2514d15ee778c8122b1110b3e04666a","9aedf2225150ea3d3262a2b2ffe56af0442164ff","92b8a0224190abca37148cb0840cfe5a9848d0e3","698079eb05faed3bc4defb2ccb6d78092e4e393e","d250982ebf30517cbd03b17a83423022291c689b","81494126c852673636dc55c1f3150d9ed99c651f","78b44556cf755fe898de45450bface2e1933b8ab","92e0ca41583ab4c66c3ca79b6f69351c1cee9e33","f53b5ef3891ffc1069d46e10b9819c6b8a8edff1","ca35b3ce1a40cf560c0766462ca9d0a66318670b","66d2dcead2310ae72c6823887c9fe859ecd08206","a2cf775d76da9991aad9113612fea730364eef76","986306b1015119cb0cdacfe7468650a3709fc240","16678a44a278efa518100894f6fe1608a6c64d67","058758aa85fb369d1acf06060406f1bdab9913f7","6b5fcd0098016544390754efd6050a4ea257ef9a","1b357c25391604a7bde4210548adcccb06d3d284","9b6f4200be235ddb4c8185ae96588495ceb43bf9","1f1b3fc81ff0b36fd96a8bb2cc800257b5fd309c","5650107b122e3c7914fec963430be4bc46a68759","fd54e3bf831159e31024ba8fcc96b52cc639da25","c6d0a20d015d5b57750581f3ee3df64333174828","edb7896175ed50c8753e3ed5757475a685d68890","d0cba1d0180b6cbc9b9753395522d06ea7447930","ddaa04814103d7e0ced31c801ebf4ff4d93b380c","7bedfb805ad7f956d9d01e50de690737a1811c60","e2661bed63198f2035380ff031008166803c5b45"],"pdfUrls":["http://mocvd.ece.illinois.edu/publications/pubs/2010_SLIM-topo_OL_208.pdf","http://poplab.stanford.edu/pdfs/Wang-GrapheneSLIM-ol10.pdf","http://www.life.illinois.edu/clockworks/pdfs/2010Wang_OpticsLetters.pdf"],"title":"Topography and refractometry of nanostructures using spatial light interference microscopy.","doi":"10.1364/OL.35.000208","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1364/OL.35.000208","venue":"Optics letters"}

The function fitted as the ordinate is similar to a normal distribution function related to date as the abscissa. The data used were collected from literature on different breeds and from different locations of the world; all studies had been specifically conducted to study estrous activity in ewes in these locations. Parameters estimated in an iterarive procedure from the algorithm were length of time during which estrous cycles occurred (SA), a measure of asymmetry (SD), day of mid-estrous (DE), highest incidence of estrus (MX) and lowest incidence of estrus (MN), day of lowest incidence of estrus (DN) and day of mid-anestrous season (DA). Incidence of estrus is defined as the proportion of ewes exhibiting an active estrus. These parameters were estimated for several breeds and locations. The data, as collectcxt, were inadequately cross-classified to allow for unconfounded estimation. However, analyses of fitted parameters that describe the curves gave quantitative results about the influences of breed of sheep, location, latitude and altitude and indicated which parameters were associated with these factors. Breeds differed significantly for SA, DE, MX and DA. Locations differed for DE, MX and DA. Latitude was associated with differences in DE, DN and DA with altitude also associated with differences in DE and DA. There were no significant effects on SD even though breeds differed sizably in SD.

We foresee high degrees of mobility, heterogeneity, and interactions among computing devices connected to global networks. While previous research in distributed operating systems solved many problems related to resource management, they seldom addressed the problems of heterogeneity and dynamic adaptability. On the other hand, middleware solutions, like CORBA and Java/Jini, solve part of the heterogeneity problem by permitting seamless communication among different platforms. But, they do not address dynamic resource management and adaptability for applications requiring high-performance distributed computing.

Acetaminophen toxicity is the most common cause of drug-induced hepatitis. The oxidative metabolite of acetaminophen, NAPQI (N-acetyl-p-benzo-quinone imine) depletes a natural antioxidant Glutathione peroxidase (GPx). \nOBJECTIVE: \nThe objective of this study was to determine the hepatoprotective and antioxidative effects of ethanolic extract of Allium sativum var Lehsun gulabi on acetaminophen induced hepatotoxicity in male albino rats. \nMETHODOLOGY: \nThis Randomized controlled trial (RCT) was carried out in Physiology department, SIMS, Lahore from August 2015 to February 2017 on 90 male albino rats. A single intraperitoneal dose of acetaminophen 750mg/kg was used to induce oxidative stress and hepatotoxicity. The rats were randomly divided into three groups of thirty each. Group A was given normal saline (control); group B was administered hepatotoxic dose of acetaminophen (negative control); group C (experimental) was pretreated with Allium sativum Var Lehsun Gulabi extract for 7 days before receiving hepatotoxic dose of acetaminophen (Experimental). Serum ALT, AST, ALP, total proteins, albumin and glutathione peroxidase levels in each group were estimated from terminal blood sampling done 24 hours after acetaminophen administration. \nRESULTS: \nAllium sativum var Lehsun Gulabi manifested hepatoprotective and antioxidative effects by producing highly significant (p=0.000) reduction in serum ALT and AST, and significant (p=0.015) reduction in serum ALP levels. This garlic extract also produced highly significant (p=0.000) increase in serum total proteins, albumin and glutathione peroxidase levels. \nCONCLUSION: \nAllium sativum var Lehsun Gulabi has potent hepatoprotective and antioxidative potential.","inCitations":["6b56cd7d41953b4cf590e6942f0c58f594136a99"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Hepatoprotective and Antioxidative Effects of Allium Sativum Var Lehsun Gulabi on Acetaminophen Induced Acute Hepatitis in Male Albino Rats","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

The model takes into account anharmonic-type couplings between the high-frequency N-H(D) and the low-frequency N...O stretching vibrations in each hydrogen bond, resonance interactions (Davydov coupling) between equivalent hydrogen bonds in each dimer, resonance interdimer interactions within a unit cell, and Fermi resonance between the N-H(D) stretching fundamental and the first overtone of the N-H(D) in-plane bending vibrations. The vibrational Hamiltonian, selection rules, and expressions for the integral properties of an absorption spectrum are derived. The model is used for theoretical simulation of the NH stretching bands of 1-methylthymine and its ND derivative at 300 K. The effect of deuteration is successfully reproduced by our model. Infrared, far-infrared, Raman, and low-frequency Raman spectra of 1-methylthymine and its deuterated derivative have been measured. Experimental geometry and frequencies are compared with the results of density functional theory calculations performed at the B3LYP6-311++G**, B3LYP/cc-pVTZ, B3PW916-311++G**, and B3PW91/cc-pVTZ levels.","inCitations":["754258e145b759f4508631b3ec7999f3b5baa1ad","3bad05b6e8bf8b9043baf9db3d4ac4e129999444","4bd85323a44cb635acbfa9f4b749bcf6209f1cbf"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Theoretical model of infrared spectra of hydrogen bonds in molecular crystals and its application to interpretation of infrared spectra of 1-methylthymine.","doi":"10.1063/1.2335843","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1063/1.2335843","venue":"The Journal of chemical physics"}

The condition is most commonly diagnosed by a serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D below 40 nmol/L (16 g/L). This paper reviews North American studies addressing the prevalence of the problem, and the growing body of evidence that vitamin D insufficiency predisposes individuals to poor bone and muscle health. The term insufficiency is somewhat misleading, as patients with this condition are really just part of the spectrum of vitamin D deficiency. If the more generous definition of this condition is used (serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D 80 nmol/L), a much larger proportion of the population has the problem. The response to vitamin D supplementation in clinical trials suggests current recommendations for dietary intake of this vitamin are too low and that a higher adequate intake should be recommended.

Information measure plays an important role in SVNS theory, which has received more and more attention in recent years. In this study, we develop a multi-attribute decision making (MADM) method based on the single valued neutrosophic information measures. Under the single valued neutrosophic environment, three axiomatic definitions of information measures are first introduced, including entropy, similarity measure and cross-entropy. Then, we construct some information measure formulas on the basis of the cosine function. The relationship among the entropy, similarity measure and cross-entropy is discussed, from which we find that three information measures can be transformed by each other. Moreover, an approach to single valued neutrosophic MADM is proposed, which is based on the constructed information measure formulas. Finally, a numerical example for city pollution evaluation is provided to explore the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed method. Results show that the proposed MADM approach can derive the more accurate decision making results and obtain the reasonable and credible ranking result in some cases.","inCitations":["baaa402001e049790675fa54d06fac092849005e"],"pdfUrls":["http://fs.unm.edu/neut/MultiCriteriaDecisionMakingEnvironmental.pdf"],"title":"Multi-Criteria Decision Making Approach Using the Fuzzy Measures for Environmental Improvement under Neutrosophic Environment","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Emphasis was placed on the prevention of emergencies due to transboundary epidemic diseases of livestock of significant economic, trade and/or food security importance. EMPRES early warning activities, mainly based on disease surveillance, reporting and epidemiological analysis are supported by the EMPRES-i information system which enables integration, analysis and sharing of animal health data, combined with relevant layers of information, such as socio-economic, production and climatic data. Indeed, data integration, analysis and mapping represent a key step towards a better understanding of the distribution and behaviour, source and evolution of a disease (or infection) for the definition of appropriate cost-effective disease control strategies. With the emergence of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 in South-East Asia and its rapid spread beyond its known original distribution range, through its EMPRES programme the FAO has invested time and resources in the implementation of several studies to reveal HPAI epidemiological features in specific ecosystems of Asia and advise member countries accordingly on the best disease control options. Some of the key findings are presented in this paper and illustrate the incredible potential of using geographic information systems as part of international early warning systems and their multiple applications in the surveillance and control of infectious diseases, such as HPAI.","inCitations":["2036fb962d676227260c294a2f37f0423401ca7a","57611760560eded19bd028a39d4cf6b3d66632df","39e6af46c30be984b294b03458cc6e51f1ac98b7","9636509fb9dacd665e1dab6adafa9d5e3d5d2ca9","0e13350a4a9e9227673ad049eb60750fa3a85523","7399815c929f1288a22cfcc55fc42e7dd8eaaa8a"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.izs.it/vet_italiana/2007/43_3/437_450.pdf"],"title":"Geographic information systems applied to the international surveillance and control of transboundary animal diseases, a focus on highly pathogenic avian influenza.","doi":"","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"Veterinaria italiana"}

It addresses issues like considering non-functional requirements for testing, managing the virtually infinite amount of negative security test cases, advancing non-functional security testing away from its prevalent penetration testing-like style, and making non-functional security testing feasible for testers that are not experts in security via a security knowledge base.

Four particular cases, which include the rotation of both a single sphere or a single cylinder in an infinite gas and two concentric spheres and two coaxial cylinders when the inner rotating body is separated from the outer fixed body by a finite space filled with a rarefied gas, are considered. In constructing the moment systems the Chapman-Enskog solution is used as the molecular characteristic. This helps to overcome some of the calculational difficulties associated with finding the bracket integrals. Moreover, in each case this technique leads to very simple analytic expressions for the moment of force applicable both at arbitrary Knudsen numbers and for arbitrary models of the intermolecular potential.

Development of a systematic and generic method for realising this process by acquiring human postural and motor movements is explored. This is achieved by breaking down the human motion into a number of segments called motion or skill primitives. The proposed methodology is developed based on studying the movement of the human hand. The motion is measured by a dual-axis accelerometer and a gyroscope mounted on the hand. The gyroscope locates the position and configuration of the hand, whereas the accelerometer measures the kinematics parameters of the movement. The covariance and the mean of the data produced by the sensors are used as features in the clustering process. A fuzzy clustering method is developed and applied to identify different movements of the human hand. The proposed clustering approach identifies the sequence of the motion primitives embedded in the data produced from the human wrist movement. A review of the previous work in the area is carried out and the developed methodology is described. An overview of the experimental setup and procedures to validate the approach is given. The results of the validation are analysed critically and some conclusions are drawn.","inCitations":["e7551e3157459f1406b6e39257488d460683c416","891e9d1819613e302e38a9057bd3d5d206e27267","fb1142f326fead72270ff0f511b1a2003c35101b","20ceb5c1672eea2a5632a1335495e9081f544e74","dff06e7aafb41ad2c93fabba07f7b6da17981ca1"],"pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1016/j.asoc.2010.01.013"],"title":"Fuzzy clustering of human motor motion","doi":"10.1016/j.asoc.2010.01.013","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.asoc.2010.01.013","venue":"Appl.

This permits to provide interval valued possibility measure (IVPM) and interval valued necessity measure (IVNM) as well as interval valued possibility distribution (IVPD). Particularly, two kinds of IVPM will be provided. The first one assumes a conjunctive normal form and a disjunctive normal form pertaining to a logical assertion. While the second one considers a logical AND and a logical OR as an essence to construct the underlying interval. The properties of both representations are investigated. Also, some basic mode operations involving conjunction and disjunction combinations are examined. Conditioning in the setting of IVPM is introduced considering either a canonical extension of well established rules, or more interestingly by solving the underlying Cox's axiomatic equation. Finally, some further extensions using general class of t‐norms operators are discussed.","inCitations":["26138e8e42be291c30d182a25af3b25c75fb3dfa","0e122619025bafaef4b658ed49821e810de7d72f"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Interval possibility measures : basic concepts and conditioning","doi":"10.1108/03684920310458566","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1108/03684920310458566","venue":""}

Since the initial Crosby's idea in 1979, plenty of models have been created in the Software & Systems Engineering domains, addressing various perspectives. By analyzing the content of the Process Reference Models (PRM) in many of them, it can be noticed that people-related issues have little weight in the appraisals of the capabilities of organizations while in practice they are considered as significant contributors in traditional process and organizational performance appraisals, as stressed instead in well-known Performance Management models such as MBQA, EFQM and BSC. This paper proposes some ways for leveraging people-related maturity issues merging HR practices from several types of maturity models into the organizational Business Process Model (BPM) in order to achieve higher organizational maturity and capability levels.","inCitations":["f86f4ee2fbfb7460ba7e9c37e971fb25960418db","04d261c2f24d8082988996157276c78494a2fcac"],"pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-05415-0_3","https://page-one.springer.com/pdf/preview/10.1007/978-3-642-05415-0_3"],"title":"Leveraging People-Related Maturity Issues for Achieving Higher Maturity and Capability Levels","doi":"10.1007/978-3-642-05415-0_3","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-05415-0_3","venue":"IWSM/Mensura"}

Maximum-intensity volumes were constructed by assigning the maximum Hounsfield unit in all CT volumes per geometric voxel to a new, synthetic volume. Gross tumor volumes (GTVs) were contoured on all CT volumes, and their union was constructed. The GTV with all its respiratory motion was contoured on the MIV as well. Union GTVs and GTVs including motion were compared visually. Furthermore, planning target volumes (PTVs) were constructed for the union of GTVs and the GTV on MIV. These PTVs were compared by centroid position, volume, geometric extent, and surface distance.\n\n\nRESULTS\nVisual comparison of GTVs demonstrated failure of the MIV technique for 5 of 10 patients. For adequate GTV(MIV)s, differences between PTVs were <1.0 mm in centroid position, 5% in volume, +/-5 mm in geometric extent, and +/-0.5 +/- 2.0 mm in surface distance. These values represent the uncertainties for successful MIV contouring.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nMaximum-intensity volumes are a good first estimate for target volume definition including respiratory motion. However, it seems mandatory to validate each individual MIV by overlaying it on a movie loop displaying the 4DCT data and editing it for possible inadequate coverage of GTVs on additional 4DCT motion states.","inCitations":["bf145d0d4b40d3331bc495d5d0daf8b930abcec1","f6b51df2be1646786343411b2a5e82c906bf3a73","9996169be30bf08161677471e9944efcae887d41","55adf0d918f34f07951495ceff7cbfa9d6cc7a3a","e330627873f0deae0b4cf37aa37471062c45f9ee","08d100686ac622ad5eed981e5b1cf1db63d000a2","e06dbe5aede60f23847d5e5ad096da9ebe07e618","640e479ebcc9110001197e526619bc78d406a708","d82feef80038a676315132dbb008458990cf2db0","78047787aca2519249bd9c6bb4d9872f9020f96d","ef531dd2e854e3bb1c1d372bf2bbabc769d1c53b","57ce0bc2ecaa1b466887172008f84fd85875bb76","46b740532e00fc564a4db1a3c1b7c6ccc9872bfc","ef2c068b850d4fb1937017bb65f3672ec4906caf","10b8b6922d1a1040f7ea323163bb3d32223d4758","9e76c56976e7d4d843fa0c8497df2b3d2a7c7a66","1cce741cf6e47d5d04c238ff9af237fd49a5fa61","f86c0215141046ea61c6b25fae030887d24118e1","233eaa1f3ce594c1be024bcd7cb10020a82a3ce0","71a318bcc87e8a7c9f69c54c582e8ac95dc492a4","e7ee422ac7d1a83697b585d107747c43e41113e3","6d7fcacee560b47d2f30c27338a56e8b80b082ce","2f2dc3ade96863c5ef56bb91482741d31e90b18c","7ef45a4b54f3ae2f325312dbcd8157cc2240eeb8","c349853a40171eba36312b2bce4f36715b5c39b9","055ea561cd588d977c300dc9557be00389bd2ec2","e748104ca7b3cb58622130bb7e49df7922ba2f34"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Maximum-intensity volumes for fast contouring of lung tumors including respiratory motion in 4DCT planning.","doi":"10.1016/j.ijrobp.2008.03.030","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijrobp.2008.03.030","venue":"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics"}

The purpose of this study is to examine how behavior-inducing psychogenic needs (i.e., need for uniqueness, self-promotion, and social identity) influence the way individuals perceive apparel customization, leading to buying intention of customized apparel products. Further, to identify whether gender plays a moderating role in the relationships between those psychogenic needs and the perception of apparel customization. The conceptual model was tested by conducting an online survey of 338 samples from college students in the United States. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was utilized for hypotheses testing. The structural multi-group model was conducted and path coefficient comparisons were made to test the moderating effects of gender. The results indicated that need for uniqueness and social identity are strong determinant factors in eliciting positive perceptions of customization, ultimately resulting in buying intention of customized apparel products; however, the effects of self-promotion was not significant. The results also illustrated that differences exist in antecedents toward customization perception between genders. Both genders are commonly motivated by need for uniqueness. However, males are more driven by social identity and need for uniqueness, whereas females are more inspired by self-promotion. The results offer managerial implications by providing retailers with consumers’ behavior toward fashion customization based on gender differences.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://fashionandtextiles.springeropen.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s40691-019-0175-3"],"title":"Psychogenic antecedents and apparel customization: moderating effects of gender","doi":"10.1186/s40691-019-0175-3","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s40691-019-0175-3","venue":"Fashion and Textiles"}

I pull the duvet over my head. A few molecules of roasted coffee make it from the kitchen and through the layers of down which insulate me from the outside world. The smell hits home like sal volatile, and percolates into my half sleep. It's enough to get me out of bed. I stagger into the kitchen, blinking. The low sun blazes, refracted through the layer of city grime, which seems, permanently to coat our windows. The coffee maker lets out a sigh of steam, as if pleased to see me-at last. I open the fridge, and sniff a raggedly opened carton of milk. Half fill a mug, advertising engineering bearings, top it up with coffee, and microwave it for a minute. I shuffle over to the table, with its usual tablecloth of The Guardian, and prise yesterday's cereal bowl off a picture of Peter Mandelson. I give up on trying to remove the cereal, which, in the space of 24 hours, has turned to reinforced concrete, and tip a mountain of museli, bran flakes and crunchy cereal into a plastic bowl reserved for camping and shortages of clean crockery. I grasp at a faint resemblance to mount Fuji, as I create a snow-cap of yoghurt and chop a banana onto the summit. A lake of soya milk around the foothills and the tableau is ready to eat. The first edge of coffee, mellow-burnt and sharp incises the morning fug. I get stuck in to mount Fuji. Lingering on the biting synergy of the cereal and yoghurt, the delicate sweet dried fruit, and the hazelnuts that crackle as I bite into them, I reach for the orange juice. The clean sharp-sweet taste and midsummer colour, are deliciously out of place in Glasgow's dour winter.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"What Should be Done to Compensate for the Shortcomings of a Vegetarian Diet?*","doi":"10.1177/026010609901300204","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1177/026010609901300204","venue":"Nutrition and health"}

Measurements in these tables are summarized as mean ± SEM for each treatment group. Results from pairwise-comparison tests are often included using letter displays, in which treatment means that are not significantly different, are followed by a common letter. However, the traditional manual processes for computation and presentation of statistically significant outcomes in MS Word tables using a letter-based algorithm are tedious and prone to errors.ResultsUsing the R package ‘Shiny’, we present a web-based program freely available online, at https://houssein-assaad.shinyapps.io/TwoWayANOVA/. No download is required. The program is capable of rapidly generating publication-ready tables containing two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) results. Additionally, the software can perform multiple comparisons of means using the Duncan, Student-Newman-Keuls, Tukey Kramer, Westfall, and Fisher’s least significant difference (LSD) tests. If the LSD test is selected, multiple methods (e.g., Bonferroni and Holm) are available for adjusting p-values. Significance statements resulting from all pairwise comparisons are included in the table using the popular letter display algorithm. With the application of our software, the procedures of ANOVA can be completed within seconds using a web-browser, preferably Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome, and a few mouse clicks. To our awareness, none of the currently available commercial (e.g., Stata, SPSS and SAS) or open-source software (e.g., R and Python) can perform such a rapid task without advanced knowledge of the corresponding programming language.ConclusionsThe new and user-friendly program described in this paper should help scientists perform statistical analysis and rapidly generate publication-ready MS-Word tables for two-way ANOVA.

Aneurysms may occur after aortic prosthetic reconstruction for both occlusive and aneurysmal disease, may occur early or late, and may be classified as a pseudoaneurysm or true aneurysm.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThirty-one cases in 29 patients treated at a tertiary referral center from 1980 to 1992 were retrospectively reviewed. Iliac and femoral aneurysms were excluded. The indication for initial abdominal aortic grafting had been aneurysmal disease in 19 patient and occlusive disease in 10 patients.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThere were 25 pseudoaneurysms and six true aneurysms, the latter followed grafting for aneurysmal disease. The current aneurysm (mean size 7.1 cm) was at the proximal aortic anastomosis in 27 cases and at the distal aortic anastomosis in two cases. Symptoms at presentation included abdominal pain (14), mass (12), claudication (9), back pain (6), and gastrointestinal bleeding (3). Surgical management included interposition tube grafting (16), aortoiliofemoral bypass (9), and graft removal with extraanatomic bypass (3). The overall operative morbidity rate was 73%, and mortality rate was 21%.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nParaanastomotic aortic aneurysms are being increasingly recognized and are associated with high morbidity and mortality rates. Patients should be periodically studied after aortic grafting with abdominal ultrasonography for early detection of this potentially serious complication. Elective surgical repair is advocated in the effort to minimize morbidity rates.","inCitations":["1a38f2886726387b8f60298e0346c4b599835543","8f7d302adb305a5813c04743bde320d5a36f7396","4f54a29f3fd2666159e46770d1fa37c12647b30d","1ebc19b5b4a0a7d2fa16ff0e7cacf1e5070c1a0f","c8ff544397a069ce7d1f1627c3d957a32aba0146","be16ef9add7788685ff1326738cc98d94f82db01","044a7af817afc4ba515116490adfac616fd32e39","f0693a04a24b0ae9aed4f6ff0c87de0c68685867","b2b78e4b87a269c79f1004d161a9e7a44bc47ff9","ffd16dcc98d9d4655d6ba9d08770dba2438876e2","9cf713c739da89fe53cd6663d224d34fdcf7fa3e","3c026ff7f09e6d557503a4f4beab65f3c780e26c","3f129c790dcdb0db3440832dbc3fd3cf34f47f6b","467446b1c9c068a1d6745c8185e932b538c3faeb","a7e8f65b6051bf3dd5cd3b844a062a03b62815b1","2bbf4e5a4a0e7d2c58e402143e54a413e6d3b599","8052e1c4abbf1e4aeaf54d7e70b1b89f270959dc","d9dccdf7237de5cc31a1796529fe0e24a139123a","b992aee27d232a81b341991026715eb5c386cce9","bb33c10b26405d06bc9a83cb2053eb3659e4fbe9","a0322c685acbb606abed6e1e65c5cefd396718b1","d981f579faf7cf4e2f52037f13262f783d21c0bc","381787912cdac42c44336a64305bb1bf3c25f982","bf374db52a446e3a6a63ddfe628de4a1c184b047","c8419b6f66e2b22ce99caab232804ebcc4086f39","c29f2b368f2444f8e819e4defa9c65b18829ff3d","83627929d37589ee0cde65c5ab2065a88dc398a5","e0a8432191cf607adc9640f78bb42ec60e389aa7","b89b44c8a903e27879514444a8594ce66456fbbe","3d8672c75768ffeeb38825580d86c75ab266c75b","def242986d308ac622057d35f5a0c99482755ffb","fae65300d3e3e9fe2343ed86dd2db5130e14075b","ee2dbffe6373b044a5cc2b5e25d7759e6f0c0379","70bd47f852fda3879e69031efb7490279f97db98","3d6d3c818992307cff311d6dd7f11be0d4f1ef75","4e3a8fff8546122ba7fd4973b6f03e57ab917a56","448c3c3bd7de206f0bfcfcc91a784cf97db4a64f","9818c93c52ecf526613423fcdecf9446c4cca6b4","d1cf3032c6743fbe1fbf7bcec7fee7e063483e84","53fb6625aa6b31303ec9a32dc252abfcfc9faaba","c1b8b86982bdf60482721de0b0a661ddd558609b","b11af2ed50c124ba544aee62c19c660432b76f5f"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Paraanastomotic aneurysms of the abdominal aorta.","doi":"10.1016/0741-5214(93)90260-S","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/0741-5214%2893%2990260-S","venue":"Journal of vascular surgery"}

We cannot look, however imperfectly, upon a great man, without gaining something by him. He is the living light-fountain, which it is good and pleasant to be near. The light which enlightens, which has enlightened the darkness of the world; and this not as a kindled lamp only, but rather as a natural luminary shining by the gift of Heaven; a flowing light-fountain, as I say, of native original insight, of manhood and heroic nobleness; - in whose radiance all souls feel that it is well with them. (On Heroes 3-4)THOMAS CARLYLE'S CHARACTERISTICALLY PASSIONATE utterance in On Heroes, Hero-Worship, and the Heroic in History (1841) reverberates throughout the literature of a hero-worshipping age. Although they often used the example of these figures to different ends, men such as Carlyle, Thomas Babington Macaulay, Samuel Smiles, Charles Kingsley, J. A. Froude, and John Ruskin all believed there were valuable life-lessons to be drawn from the stories of great men, whose exceptional gifts had given them an ability to see into the heart of things and to penetrate the \"open secret\" of the universe, \"open to all, seen by almost none\" (On Heroes 69). Carlyle 's heroes - pagan gods, prophets, poets, priests, writers, and kings - are a disparate group drawn from different countries and eras, but who ultimately share \"the divine relation . . . which in all times unites a Great Man to other men\" (On Heroes 6).Like Carlyle's heroes, the figures that make up Ruskin's personal \"bede-roll\" (Newsome 157) are varied, but in the case of Ruskin, Plato occupies a central place. He is one of five men whom Ruskin insists, in Fors Clavigera (1871-84), that his readers study closely as representative of \"the wisdom which the Masters of all men - the dead Senate of the noblest among the nations - [have] left for the guidance of the ages yet to be\" (Works zg: 401). Yet although Ruskin was strongly influenced by Plato, particularly in matters of political economy, social reform and education, his response to Plato's view of aesthetics is less clear. Whereas Plato famously bans imitative artists and poets from his ideal republic,1 Ruskin looks to the greatest of these as teachers and, in Fors, finds some of them \"divinely related\" with Plato himself - the four other figures, along with Plato, whose lives and histories Ruskin considers essential study are all creative artists: Virgil, Dante, Carpaccio, and Shakespeare. Ruskin's personal heroes, J. M. W. Turner and Walter Scott in particular, are more of the same. Indeed many of the men whom Ruskin most reverences as seers and sages are just those whom Plato would reject as unenlightened imitators. This disparity necessitates a consideration of the ways that Ruskin, who agrees with Plato in so much of his thought, differs with him aesthetically. What does Ruskin - artist, art instructor and the most influential art critic of his time - make of Plato's deep distrust of the imitative arts and of the role he assigns them in his ideal polity?Of the many classical writers he read, Ruskin was especially drawn to Plato. In 1843 he wrote a college friend that \"I ... think myself very wrong if I do not read a little bit of Plato very accurately every day\" (Works i: 494); in later years he began each morning by translating passages of Plato's Laws in his diary. While the Bible remained Ruskin's \"Ur-text\" (Spear 76), from the i86os he drew increasingly upon Plato, paying close attention to the ways in which their teaching intersected. As Dinah Birch observes, \"Plato is seen [by Ruskin] as the most valuable ancient philosopher because he is closest to the Christian spirit\" (25). W. R. Inge, Dean of St. Paul's, remarked in 1919 that Ruskin may have owed more to Plato than to his contemporary \"master\" Carlyle (29). More recently, Tim Hilton has suggested that Ruskin might always have been \"a Platonist by temperament\" (Later Years 54). …","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Imitation and Imagination: John Ruskin, Plato, and Aesthetics","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

However, its irregular and unpredictable nature makes it difficult for users to change their routine practices. The ways people interact with energy systems are complex; it involves negotiating and compromising various practices. This paper draws on 37 semi-structured interviews with householders who participated in the UK’s first trial of a dynamic time-of-use tariff (dTOD) for electricity. It explores trial participants’ experience with variable energy pricing. Findings from the interviews show that trial participants were willing to adapt their household practices to price changes as long as the tariff did not ruin their quality of life. Moreover, the trial was a real opportunity for people to respond to price changes. Having experienced it, participants gained confidence in performing their household practices flexibly and felt more control over energy consumption. This UK-based study has relevance to the EU context because smart grids and dynamic pricing is one of the prioritised areas in its energy infrastructure policy.","inCitations":["9e0a314d9e9eac71223b235dd711d8f3bfe57f96"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Follow the price signal: People’s willingness to shift household practices in a dynamic time-of-use tariff trial in the United Kingdom","doi":"10.1016/j.erss.2018.06.008","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.erss.2018.06.008","venue":""}

This paper reviews what can be proved, and what can be believed, about the turbulent diffusion of magnetic field. Observations indicate the dissipation of magnetic field at rates that can be understood only in terms of turbulent diffusion. Theory shows that a largescale weak magnetic field diffuses in a turbulent flow in the same way that smoke is mixed throughout the fluid by the turbulence. The small-scale fields (produced from the large-scale field by the turbulence) are limited in their growth by reconnection of field lines at neutral points, so that the turbulent mixing of field and fluid is not halted by them.Altogether, it appears that the mixing of field and fluid in the observed turbulent motions in the Sun and in the Galaxy is unavoidable. Turbulent diffusion causes decay of the general solar fields in a decade or so, and of the galactic field in 108–109 yr. We conclude that continual dynamo action is implied by the observed existence of the fields.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"The generation and dissipation of solar and galactic magnetic fields","doi":"10.1007/BF00647427","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/BF00647427","venue":""}

To meet this requirements, cyber-physical systems (CPS) are applied into the production process, aiming for interconnected and self-managing smart factories, which can incorporate external and internal conditions for the autonomous adaptation to gain optimized results. This is achieved through a bi-directional information flow between all important components such as machines, products, control programs and off-site assets. Therefore it is essential to standardize communication interfaces and enhance interoperability between CPS of all variations. This paper presents an approach to combine the specification of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) with the guidelines of the Plattform Industrie 4.0 (I4.0), thus obtaining a uniform structure for industrial CPS. Based on the recommended asset administration shell for I4.0-components, the required functionality is identified and allocated to different segments. The five main segments include the functionality for security, representation, communication to external CPS, communication to internal assets and a section for additional applications to enhance the capabilities. By using a standardized protocol for the configuration and representation based on the object memory model of the W3C, a significant interoperability between I4.0-components and conventional Internet-of-Things can be realized. The proposed structure is applied in a use case to simulate the adaptation and remote maintenance of a production robot.","inCitations":["bc14ff44ede101a14f1f28f5a50b124784d8b3f8","d29d8ca94a4bcaa3364feed9573c4d0e02cfd2c3","5da9e52cbfd1ce901ce4078ae124d0a28737a787","bd02341e03ec14a0ab0456fbe1deb528aa72fdfb","2af23f18a0a3704e4115e94ee2a625a41ee59f9e","86ae2c648f973d0d0998359c66f9667fed9ea17c","f931cc9fa176b01bac2243eb791f02330ab20205","181140fda667288bda72c1fc6c75f7d5b10117ca","75b55a5c74a1dec43fe54469ace805bed1c61e47","4ccce310f53ba49c5bd38b5ad808aa9a13ea9954","47472d2ea528f9953882ba9ac5eb6bbdae87f244","e3002da2c091a7d23c6900704f4a42164c8eb2bd","1607bd9b98eb3771d0b3a2e749b00ce2e4e651a7","43350b7cfa011445684134238042fe1169effa94","c3438119a1d466f69568b48d6ae3f1664d1e3830"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Integrated Data Model and Structure for the Asset Administration Shell in Industrie 4.0","doi":"10.1016/j.procir.2017.01.048","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.procir.2017.01.048","venue":""}

Sites that were homozygous for the same allele in the parents and heterozygous in one or more offspring were categorized as candidate mutations and subjected to detailed analysis. In 1.23 × 10(9) callable sites from 12 individuals, we confirmed six single nucleotide mutations. We estimated the false negative rate in the experiment by generating synthetic mutations using the empirical distributions of numbers of nonreference bases at heterozygous sites in the offspring. The proportion of synthetic mutations at callable sites that we failed to detect was <1%, implying that the false negative rate was extremely low. Our estimate of the point mutation rate is 2.8 × 10(-9) (95% confidence interval = 1.0 × 10(-9) - 6.1 × 10(-9)) per site per generation, which is at the low end of the range of previous estimates, and suggests an effective population size for the species of ∼1.4 × 10(6). At one site, point mutations were present in two individuals, indicating that there had been a premeiotic mutation cluster, although surprisingly one individual had a G→A transition and the other a G→T transversion, possibly associated with error-prone mismatch repair. We also detected three short deletion mutations and no insertions, giving a deletion mutation rate of 1.2 × 10(-9) (95% confidence interval = 0.7 × 10(-9) - 11 × 10(-9)).","inCitations":["84d728793f3851616accd434dde6b0d21164b435","e279641ec8d24dce17d144e4fefbe65ef669c2ea","baf401b8bbc6e73945abf0d307a2cf81bee60ddd","5b351d2d94adbc5eb11c001cfe7ed1b4707a1fd1","dbd811917e782355d7bd1a856a8fcbfbc0b31501","0aba0f3c2d5b90422b815ba80c47590c2843408e","a60a8ca19f5721b7293513f931926294724b9d5b","1da09c03c3bea6009019b9b099de2ed86e70111c","abf5d334e36d782e6bb35938b389d6b698223bee","22609e8519358406f7a8e38c66eac4c581f238ef","2570611b9763f6a9df03b89552ac657fd5fe3375","595cf38164ec1a1b337cd72eff6487394085ed24","9538f3523731564f28f47e6eab862153a8a456b8","b9768ec0a28ce645823a42ae3b1b2c015272e3f9","78356595f4af6013def32cfb2e4b2365d8df51c4","9b05c2dc6269ac9c6062aa2803c55373e0b1c65b","15f40e115942271f63eef335371fca6b5cbe8ab6","b3bfc1a81996df2cfc16a0c0da609d0652844906","5e7f66661958efe118dc0e4f96661b2e5af28777","7d02ffcc6cb7deace357a6277071bf450a9f7d65","a10842c31ee36c74fca792f62a40ba2aabc12b89","2cd49b592afeae85bbad63dafd6730300ce4fedc","3b4beeb163040a0bc73db33b676aeb68e3264b4c","15f31537832514696d495057a10e576dea21df90","8361d25df66d9aef95f6b16dc70bd80722cf0a39","d21f098c1d81d40ee5da8a3a2e5bd6ed5fc610d2","e9a85e6e3926c187bec10dbbfcb896a275b5290d","d47b378751621a22e03d8a840f14eb82c04f6b8a","21b8cfb329c0153bf0989c515c0dea637092a35d","9acdf1cb4dcd4c397e76f082eadd8d8be6582fca","bd3998eaef4aa202195e09513fc3e11667ae1559","73bf67288d8533ae4febe945d15eec3fd454ad0a","6ed9d40876d2fc1de4eae9a0a67ff00ba1748cf0","1e3bb2dc32cbf2be6a67fdb1a75c72bb127977e9","1782d43ad57ecbf4115d233297759910fc3c9687","95abea67573b57dc1f9b9f0f2f0f20546f0b9cc0","dcab795a3eb721a4969579fa733f449bfb67ebf1","cfcf0ae57fd9d38821344fff2e812184216afbb8","a5170fb8b2a636239a7a20c711442f9a75415342","d76c03da4b3f0ebdf5325d9ca7267358aaa774a1","3716f7a7f6711fe32709b4ad1ac4789dc0e38107","ed9f53465dd4ac59d40416c66e5a737006ac35fa","c58076c990c02422afa7308ed94d312214f08d89","05181c4a59fe8d96ce172860a3aa70bee95f5841","641fb4d91204c2028827bf29733949ecd523453f","1cd2cc120a6e970df17e1097ac796df34fdc95e8","e1a152dc04c3a7cfb1bc83dfc07a7b726e38ade2","0fc2e9484453341a81cd8a77b8b74ad621b36053","6a3b774ee8650fcd21ca28f9e36c41af850706df","0a2f5eceac901d41fd935333bc0b244889d26782","2b6d913f374584966b5ef4e54602875cedd413f9","718afac3909d1544a4ac96ee7c7ddcd488c994c1","31ecf13cfd25540f0e78b3c4b720ce1e46765b1a","9f7e8479f6c8361067c73130761dc4ba16540025","ab89f2992e7d1baa7c0aa8fe9ad47840bcb66e66","0d4fd2c06e80b52a10e758c75e137f8f20db2e03","a172c65f154286a4288ac391564d282ea67b0dd8","85570be2a99c5a7c82132b9b61838e2e3b156c0a","f1238068e26440cde95ef94861664f5d5f3fa9bb","15fda8f7f5c2bb2a7e2a165916d781c6cc9e0dcb","4aaedbbccdeb7880f23332d5e9700f0c3ab1ae3c","97c360528468e87a2d3a27da055304fdcd247e9d","dc8de9bf9c2e2d39570550aaa018f1ec8c753b11","80d06dab35a23f229d00c332ea9f9d01b04a080b","12420759b3b8ebecc5b63d36379fbd9622f25ad8","7fc3dfd7840f78f098be6df8bb81b043db3db88c","83e4dc88b092096fbf557d672e24705b982346e0","65d72229fcf650915d4fa2850019dd1256dd356a","d3c4987cfe6d4f5f45645cf4f9bb4d7108e8b749","6e237921fdc3bb6646a36a3d5e7e3aabc9a91448","8d6a3454b342238fab7a83cba1ba7440204a8504","7a0d40249065b3e21ef25d82068fa018661b36e1","a548cbdb5b2f4918fd1bfc424e39d1039b7e2160","b265d1999dd1a59d5c6a23c3917c0231cd6cf562","4d434de1f17c0ec7689b5fac02872412bbb07fe7","49cf1aa747c481ca1c9ac0f22ac434ea15e2b1f1","21bf95460f8fc9a0f4e719d1cd4c560cc33076d9","6f885471cf2b8aa736ca0e8de2f2cfd86e57aabb","52227a56c4cd46286a504f6b1c61b3222486ed19","ea0299e8a511d764713b450c3d065b3f0a2c7157","b77e76446204a9075cf0dd1ade28619bfce74a9a","b803411f8e7d33d6ebbb560e9dc3949b06da4027","84170303d6e8377845bfc9691949e89fd635ea47","7d9c9991c8851753ddf01f4a672ca91462d45372","895152e64d0f0a01ec93faa806b9574af1837078","3c176a2ca72ae9b65a0b0cbf6ac90ac6a74f209e","68fe003d2f8ac9875514693b39bd98bd54276125","6556223f3726c6a6b426062c85af478f6e86bace","789ec497b80dfcb499377cce86fe694aa51702a4","59715de9946286e502ca87ab2f112bc024d20c3a","41dd06f693bfa4ab7ebe64477a5f2fa2d9059fc0"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.genetics.org/content/genetics/early/2013/11/01/genetics.113.158758.full.pdf","http://www.csbio.unc.edu/mcmillan/Media/KeightleyGenetics2014.pdf"],"title":"Estimation of the spontaneous mutation rate per nucleotide site in a Drosophila melanogaster full-sib family.","doi":"10.1534/genetics.113.158758","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1534/genetics.113.158758","venue":"Genetics"}

The missing element in it, however, is that of religious schools or madrasas. Given that their role in education is ignored even locally, that should not come as a surprise. Madrasas are often seen as a backward and traditional, if necessary, evil – an image that has been exacerbated by the terrorism debate.

The heterogeneous nature of upcoming devices and equipment in CPP require advanced control methods to ensure the integrity and reliability under different operational states. A solution to achieve appropriate controllability, while avoiding complexity, is to sub-divide the control problem based on event-triggered dynamics where the occurrence of specific events could change the state of the system. This idea is employed to formulate the problem of coordination of the devices in a CPP and develop a systematic method to design a supervisory control based on the theory of SCDES. Three modular supervisors are synthesized using the TCT software and simulated using the Simulink. The proposed methodology could be applied to several control problems in microgrids.","inCitations":["61b514f47274d6a15af4b9c67df3b5c138cb6ae1"],"pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1109/TSG.2017.2745491"],"title":"Discrete-Event Systems Supervisory Control for a Custom Power Park","doi":"10.1109/TSG.2017.2745491","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSG.2017.2745491","venue":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid"}

Microbial challenge tests are conducted to determine the effect of electric fields on the inactivation kinetics of selected microorganisms inoculated in real or model foods. The tests are conducted by applying an electric field, which causes the inactivation of a maximum number of microorganisms without an electrical breakdown of the food. The results show that the intensity of the electric field, treatment time, and number of pulses affect the inactivation of Saccharomyces cerevisiae suspended in different treatment media. The direct relationship between the effects of the pulse treatment on cell inactivity and membrane damage—as measured by poor to no spheroplast formation—demonstrates that the death of Staphylococcus aureus spp. is a result of membrane damage. The high inactivation levels obtained over enteric and pathogenic bacteria such as E. coli and Salmonella spp. give confidence in the pasteurization abilities of PEF. This chapter presents PEF studies of many other microorganisms and describes in detail the enzymatic activity reduction and spore inactivation phenomena. It also demonstrates the usefulness of kinetic models to compare the sensitivity of different microorganisms and species under the same treatment conditions.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"PEF Inactivation of Vegetative Cells, Spores, and Enzymes in Foods","doi":"10.1016/B978-012078149-2/50006-4","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-012078149-2%2F50006-4","venue":""}

In this paper a new approach is proposed to directly construct the judgment matrix in analytic hierarchy process according to the fuzzy relative membership degree matrix of single evaluation index. On this basis, a new method namely analytic hierarchy process-fuzzy comprehensive evaluation (FCE-AHP), which can be used to check and correct the in consistency of judgment matrix by means of accelerated genetic algorithm and to calculate the weight of the elements in the judgment matrix, is established. The application shows that this method is universal, stable and the calculation result is objective.","inCitations":["5ba5ad7932096834146d77e1d2f004750161362d","1fda7064af04afd381822e516a74a3fb61e49e0f","2b4e14b6da725b7dc080d8175d1d5c89460ecaa1","a64093219cc290dea782144a17b28e0b1546375b","62f6e68aa4f88c192fdd0ce29c9a76530932eb2c","4713bfd764a96a27877da60fcaae319f18314220","010766a0f8489f843ae491eb0e56a0ca9af9f2e3","b2b599c935cbb94256acf82782ad55866266dbfb","907a22f14d6b0a364f772e3e5ce5f36a1bbb8f47","2b174596f93f64155a14cd557fde2c7019bb7d21","47d67a5f10f1f1c99e974aa31d1f121c75d2cf7d","dbf7fe827d703b743ddc34d28dbb5bf2728acec3","67a47ae03210c687ef43e7ebef06ff9b1c413ba9","ce2b68e5dcf77eec771575a46703e53390d694c1","04e19c13cb2119599326a472d3f3d9afebb30713","c507094e564c3265dd2d62a5ecf822ef9244d2a3","9733648d549d4950a0902751c897909046b00bb8","184ddeb386d10aa3e52b51e70510e5c440287330","79167b45898c0422d040cfaf9c9b833e8a8ecda3","0275ebe9cd7219616b55fae6a32772b3f0f47c1e","787ec6eaff6eb78e35beabf736ebbdd2ce9cf152","40afac0e2cb571a56e207d46ba16d73000e447c6","bfc595d6f00adbc388c91143f30b0958a90c5ec1","39fe5e12d86d334a544f676e9972eb4241362426","09aa4fff2962fc7445e55a30a3b4570cebe47f79","6faf3a5db98293bb6e05b2031ef0b4b69e4c3efe","41087418c7660c68454c60d611d4be40a55a68b5","45da72bdc828f667e16c2a9e8b4064e521f5aa6e","f1ce36c719db63da0ccf6e5927ab9c0b62734ebf","1b9979e811a352f559de439712cbc58d5c2bcefd","cefe630e36f30ce36b20581f3f480cccf6967e3e","9f5efad28a70d138017c4540b97c8b63618a9bde","598e452f93bc1bbacb51c6d621ee6353083d8769","8a1078025536a326ad588ff3461faf77b0511c14","65107f824ed8620e53b62512129dec60ecaff521","9219187af59b1f3d183b164d464bed0af060b2af","d4025177c58ebab4159cf3c622c9ce896cf44e6e","0310ee5cff306aeb817138c3fca8b09d48494aa6","857751a95fed555694d7b6bf0f3048578213b7a8","1fdf021eb36ef6c30638f98b65be1f42f2814be7","e49fb80bec01107202f2ede99f71d25814f6eb45","d2fbfa960a331b539699adb613fb84e38270b2a8"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Fuzzy comprehensive evaluation model based on improved analytic hierarchy process","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Our previous research has indicated that higher chlorophyll, carotenoid, and anthocyanin concentrations were associated with greater tolerance of UV-B stress by 'Georgetown' kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis L.). The objectives of this study were to determine if kentucky bluegrass cultivars with darker leaf color possessed greater pigment and antioxidant defense systems and if such increases were associated with greater resistance to UV-B. Eight cultivars exhibiting a range of green color intensity ('Apollo', 'Brilliant', 'Julius', Limerick', 'Midnight', 'Moonlight', 'Nuglade', and 'Total Eclipse') were selected and subjected to continuous, artificial UV-B radiation (70 μmol.m -2 .s -1 ). UV-B irradiation reduced turf quality (55% to 62%) and photochemical efficiency (37% to 70%) when measured 5 days after initiation of UV-B exposure. Significant differences in turf color, photochemical efficiency, chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, chlorophyll a+b, and carotenoids were found among the cultivars. 'Moonlight' had greatest photochemical efficiency, chlorophyll, carotenoids, and turf quality. Positive correlations of pigment concentration with photochemical efficiency and turf color were observed under UV-B radiation stress, with correlation coefficients ranging from 0.49 to 0.62. The results of this study suggests that selecting cultivars with higher concentrations of chlorophyll and carotenoids and photochemical efficiency may be an effective way for turfgrass managers and sod producers to improve sod establishment and quality in environments with higher UV-B radiation.","inCitations":["5c4d74e1bc1778878a2ae83df3d812e9881b7448","5a1bdd1ad33285fc563a600a661bbc67fc1c263a"],"pdfUrls":["https://journals.ashs.org/downloadpdf/journals/hortsci/39/6/article-p1475.pdf"],"title":"Ultraviolet-B Radiation Damage on Kentucky Bluegrass.

Recent experimental evidence suggest that Na+,K+-ATPase might be a candidate for regulatory phosphorylation by protein kinases. Physiological agonists and drugs which modulate protein kinase A and C, or intracellular phosphatases, have been shown to affect Na+,K+-ATPase activity (1,4,5,9.10). In addition, in vitro (2,3) and in vivo (8) phosphorylation of the α-subunit of Na+,K+-ATPase upon protein kinase C stimulation has been reported. However, so far no evidence has been provided that a direct link exists between phosphorylation of the α-subunit and modulation of Na+,K+-pump activity. To approach this question, we have attempted to identify potential phosphorylation sites on the α-subunit for protein kinase A and C. Threonine (T939) and serine (S943) residues in a consensus phosphorylation sequence (939TRRNS943) in the C-terminus of the α-subunit of Bufo marinus Na+,K+-ATPase (6) were mutated. The mutants were expressed in Xenopus oocytes and phosphorylation of the α-subunit was studied in oocyte homogenates upon stimulation of oocyte protein kinases A or C (3).","inCitations":["c421111459c7c4469a335a8a5e2338dda20a4d6f","237dbdab2317ac47128fc7fac52f3786e31f22f2"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Phosphorylation of Na,K-ATPase by Protein Kinases: Structure-Functions Relationship","doi":"10.1007/978-3-642-72511-1_122","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-72511-1_122","venue":""}

From 15 to 30 percent of metastases are the result of prostate cancer cells traveling through Batson's plexus to the lumbar spine. Metastatic disease in the lumbar area can cause spinal cord compression. Metastasis to the dura and adjacent parenchyma occurs in 1 to 2 percent of patients with metastatic prostate cancer and is more common in those with tumors that do not respond to hormone-deprivation therapy. Leptomeningeal carcinomatosis, the most frequent form of brain metastasis in prostate cancer, has a grim prognosis. Because neurologic complications of metastatic prostate cancer require prompt treatment, early recognition is important. Physicians should consider metastasis in the differential diagnosis of new-onset low back pain or headache in men more than 50 years of age. Spinal cord compression requires immediate treatment with intravenously administered corticosteroids and pain relievers, as well as prompt referral to an oncologist for further treatment.","inCitations":["4165d9982f80322b8f7b803abbcb00ad3cd39153","bfc996b5cc809f87dcfb92ddef236f29b230f39e","0ad0f9e03803ead34aae501fcd9cc333d9cc79b2","49618f5a3dc886890cfe4a435189aaa691b01e2a","c1e79d4c91c67614ad2edfbf3f0749b8bb33f6d4","6a22d16c60513ae6249f059ac6b562561f06673c","f87307d8795ce14b2644d227ecbbaec6871d9341","fcbbc28bac0cd05c2538b0c3fd232dccae037c54","78b1643a978b3986ee31869d830f93abd32dd6d8","0a808a21915e12c3c1cdcb223d37edc0a90db870","7b51a1c074fcfecbaece6830345e642e78313fe9","12a5ba5a1cab01d2cfbce8d4770fc3d6725ddb40","757b34b46a90cbc5a755c7d04299d674505eeff3","0936200946a073cf24ae79956d9a5b3938bd01fe","d7bec8608cff1f3e4ddc5f0a8855943c8eafd5d3","00ae56430bfd2adbf5796064c80cdacb9a3a2528","ecb2939fbd7f79638e36a3c088672e6c6f61b9c9","4dcf5dba2348501d7480163d62614c8fd88d5d10"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.aafp.org/afp/2002/0501/p1834.pdf"],"title":"Neurologic complications of prostate cancer.","doi":"","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"American family physician"}

According to the newspaper account:With a crash and a weird train of shadows, something revoltingly alien and startlingly repulsive crawled across the stage…. The pale pink face, surrounded by bright red hair and beard, with its unsteady, cunning little eyes;the greasy caftan with the yellow prayershawl slung round; the splay-footed, shuffling walk; the foot stamping with rage; the claw-like gestures with the hands; the voice, now bawling, now muttering—all add up to a pathological image of the East European Jewish type, expressing all its inner and outer uncleanliness, emphasizing danger through humor.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"From Jesus to Shylock: Christian Supersessionism and “The Merchant of Venice”","doi":"10.1017/S0017816006001337","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1017/S0017816006001337","venue":""}

We focus on penalized least squares methods in regression models, and discuss in detail two such methods that are well established in the statistical literature, the LASSO and Elastic Net. We introduce bootstrap enhancements of these methods, the BE-LASSO and BE-Enet, that allow the user to attach a measure of uncertainty to each variable selected. Our work is motivated by a multimodal neuroimaging dataset that consists of morphometric measures (volumes at several anatomical regions of interest), white matter integrity measures from diffusion weighted data (fractional anisotropy, mean diffusivity, axial diffusivity and radial diffusivity) and clinical and demographic variables (age, education, alcohol and drug history). In this dataset, the number P of explanatory variables exceeds the number N of participants. We use the BE-LASSO and BE-Enet to provide the first statistical analysis that allows the assessment of neurocognitive performance from high dimensional neuroimaging and clinical predictors, including their interactions. The major novelty of this analysis is that biomarker selection and dimension reduction are accomplished with a view towards obtaining good predictions for the outcome of interest (i.e., the neurocognitive indices), unlike principal component analysis that are performed only on the predictors' space independently of the outcome of interest.","inCitations":["7b07e13a7ce79190286edda386425905f2a69c68","b3f899a78c9b291eba77e0d29ab156d7b8cac2c1","dcf501aea4744f09dfdf66114cab1ab463bf89ce","50da62b98a7c81e3661904cf1b1db8166c0c993c","ced9a10f4fc1c49a1cabf6b95af05aaa3f978788","c54f1068821c9c369d4ad3ecd3f35f42d53de2a4","ff445d1236fc8a570b4dd40af17ca511dd44d02f","f2b27f441d61722235e0eedb4f4ba37a1205dd86","39158ecf5196402c0f9a67305b356e6d0d9a28d4","7c63a6e6d3b31b14ae4236bfbd574ea37cab18a7","79de4c36042bd0c604f4029531ccbe771321bc0a","91dcd7590ec1a8aa9e58ad6029143bbc1b073e29","7d68470bc3d166930b1a14208a58e82b46d72a23","1ae79be6df5634898d3fe949b067a46b7e921b9c","eb94330ebd1135627df870a0bf7c5a8c9936ae12","8e15365d19ce1981bdc375a15913e8e01446570c","d3f2352a6e52883e9ad662293cae75df275caab8","0c768aa6fe3ef44834697626541efa15e6430cb2","8d5a1e6bee78b9ef2c7f9ebc2901ab8a2d4d8bb3","7bd2174878685922c8114429b2d3c724349b7ca1","57070d7de5011f76a4bf9bf09103c8525065b7ab","f1f255b722b4339588ac293edb3c55446368a158","8d706495daaca770b3dfe59a6ab75814dd8bdeba","7e7d0b3195f743c2101530c5a070a8b7dcd1fc1b","19f91865e83bca0bd29a5f937f8b2490721fde98","0183392448e14bf9727429786f2458c8ebb3409a","4448f19e805fca16b9b2049f1b86c56ab5bea8de","973f68ca2066d0e8988473862080136ac3a411f0","856fc13e00e676e8132070f4ecce6a367f7ef7da","2858627b3d7993b5226b00f833f93d49aa32e1a1","62786eaf14f64d31aa0a074b58fb3f6f4b5b7e82","02072741fcd51fcab219349ca241c6bc877e1d94","40e153fccf363f8c040b9fcb7c845b47e37de40b","83f752365c6cb81dd04e4260df34cd3dc4525406","8e1ea3102bb0f2f14019baa0990da9b3c0447d48","f322ac7cc95f0c754df1d6c09e4e00f76c635c9e","82349055ac661cb6ef5893a83194e436d2cf584d","e458600fcab5ea7c2394f2453570f4df48c46276","898b028e96884f667dd518b2d2038fb48adc353f","32d1ed05a0904e6d4827c518f29d41e4e1ccd1a8","b235893bc4bdfd4931950e32d8d6d4f02bf98b3b","c1b707fdc398bb32c66cba029b16acdb65bcb272","1e180d1c41b29b4500d60cbfbfce05c839e63d7b"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.aliquote.org/articles/slides/mva_clinres/biblio/bunea11.pdf","https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1053811910016113","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811910016113?dgcid=api_sd_search-api-endpoint","https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q33774796"],"title":"Penalized least squares regression methods and applications to neuroimaging","doi":"10.1016/j.neuroimage.2010.12.028","sources":["Medline","DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2010.12.028","venue":"NeuroImage"}
