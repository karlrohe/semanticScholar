A combined elastoplastic damage model which accounts for both plasticity and damage effects is used to represent the mechanical response of composite layers and is implemented in the FE code Abaqus using user-defined material subroutine UMAT. A cohesive zone model based on cohesive elements available in Abaqus is employed to simulate delamination behaviour in the adhesive interfaces. Continuum shell elements and cohesive elements are stacked together to simulate composite and adhesive layers, respectively. The model is applied to the progressive failure analysis of AS4/PEEK composite laminates subjected to in-plane tensile and out-of-plane transverse low-velocity impact loadings. It is shown that the model can be successfully applied to the simulations of composite laminates susceptible to delamination failure.","inCitations":["95a9ac572bd4cf1a8ef8206548a0e04998aa07c5","0c33140278a4ccbf01c494966d50b5205c349dde","1308c4efbaa7082d6212f3166d2809e340811a83","2d2fcb75dba2ebcdf5007d427d8c849dea2f79a4","3ee15883bb68fd69879cd6d31b84d0d5f57e967d","94ac66cf46e176dab6ece6c046b147e8e9d58817","db55a029a7e7118bd443bcd69f184d2ea7c17727","9bb5f9c9e2bf971ce1e33b0b763b51f6fe3e947b","476dfb57b3839a797dc3698cd601336403f507dc","9d7ab756706f743dcf849866d6723dd4e28b5a7b","d43844ce0c16f25444dce120dc16046ca4184a87","2ac479d1bf0b037853e2d084d7f5228e6790da17","2ad1287ea58832204ce6c21fc70cda1ad519d533","3e510b9afa539ccb531db7dd81514658614c73a4","2616e8e611ff7da59ee4610e8edf0d7d3363dad0","df7baab2916b20b25788bf8b347d152bb8677a6f","15701deb307af61141c717b9931e0e5df1c0b378","c918c9e0b6da89dce5402861579ea08ea6b81f71","28fd9a0022d01ccb664433e2c8f1911d3ead38c9","dc3a65afb2873e0b52002df8ba4e6fc4560df75f","45452187f302a19f19f33fef82ef3de22fac4ab4","d020a63622a08ed0b8f89a13c37acb89e9ff29ed","6bbe57dad89a15a6b8ae2b2a50dcab8b12195adf","849a64f4508010c14064f86ec453ebafa32a4441","6a6f94114c634865986d6766458cbcce46da2e62","eab7d94ab1480caae516c3427a1215febc804ea0","f514c6a59318c93ced2268cf98a5f526884134ac"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Simulating progressive failure of composite laminates including in-ply and delamination damage effects","doi":"10.1016/j.compositesa.2014.02.013","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compositesa.2014.02.013","venue":""}

The purpose of this study was to introduce an imaging method that allows measurement of regional lung ventilation and evaluation of the function of airways with a small diameter. The experiments were performed at the Medical Beamline of the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility. Monochromatic synchrotron radiation beams were used to obtain quantitative respiration-gated images of lungs and airways in two anaesthetized and mechanically ventilated rabbits using inhaled stable xenon (Xe) gas as a contrast agent. Two simultaneous images were acquired at two different energies, above and below the K-edge of Xe. Logarithmic subtraction of the two images yields absolute Xe concentrations. This technique is known as K-edge subtraction (KES) radiography. Two-dimensional planar and CT images were obtained showing spatial distribution of Xe concentrations within the airspaces, as well as the dynamics of filling with Xe. Bronchi down to 1 mm in diameter were visible both in the subtraction radiographs and in tomographic images. Absolute concentrations of Xe gas were calculated within the tube carrying the inhaled gas mixture, small and large bronchi, and lung tissue. Local time constants of ventilation with Xe were obtained by following the evolution of gas concentration in sequential computed tomography images. The results of this first animal study indicate that KES imaging of lungs with Xe gas as a contrast agent has great potential in studies of the distribution of ventilation within the lungs and of airway function, including airways with a small diameter.","inCitations":["39f517b62dc5af0d6ec0e365733fd78d501a693d","c383bb5db7584e616cb0c4c47a6d5189fd86d0d6","dd31e7e618b41c58225e6967f525c06922abd837","902dce405ba52768949e7296d4c3cd51681c179f","31ef9331ddaac2396c85e2dc121f9bf53bece517","86b6bb35882e0ce3070cba510c64487b06bdbed1","c96e7170ebedb8d8ca3723a5d4a2f76d32afb5f3","eca1c2fe3c73bdf46f6ada9100355270e8659e88","a85936f2a76469fb4cb7ce8ab4b0cfc556c6a6b6","6cc9de2b4442f685ac39df75e939b740919f3cfa","013804c21d37d8b5240a5e3918b2980999982fa9","ea95dc6dfa8c4f25b069a8219e92ccc04a66f65c","b02c6f0e8e613b83c58ca9e7746e50d559afbfba","704256a0fd4b541b4569f7bf972623df09c95480","03ab4767c7f3fd86246541ff1ac99edcca56ce05","a6ed2dc2c62803e03496fb71231c68f4480ba72d","69aea6c6af9d009357d7610d2be3b99d108f1c34","0e36f98af8a4f39eee028dc35b8cdf4fd413bd39","834f6fd755dd449573fb0ee079910a139bb59480","e5f6bd4bcdad46cbb8f5694aea913a8949e3b611","ea888891a9c8c4a5f867ec8f50c4dfb38016cc74","38ea9f996a7801e0d71a384795835ff7b6e9211e","bedb8df3b4db89f349543b279f2fb35c05f88e1d","cc65e636ff6bdcc0fec8132225fe5515fa33a4ab","27fb6c9cb33c93aaba16638c979947a9a7b5bdde","5506ebaf22933c00647aa957bc64aa3623c5a3a6","012620bb19058d645839f458b211e50ab7cfa407","8311cd2964db1459f535f5742931d665efd42fd7","e52d7b358bc08a4c3d13c8ddc33c76907c7a2ba3","70931f740f0628597603c043af7a0da84338b8f7","cf5dc8d232e8f81fc7f478b46452f2b1e1e1ec0a","744cf40539e13203168e7ceacf0807da11ff053e","69bc5f4a0d8154f38054f48fab45c6ef00b6f3cd","33b5a0f3f3853652f547b996e9b113bcb6ee7bb5","57120c1e287a51330771c856038e25f27c1297f8","e187b7d990ac44c41f6afcb881393641260a3089","2195d19d47a3edbde6d590607365b4a04566b445","e4ba80d27fa114af7f25d4f625b54092fb6b6292"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Quantitative functional lung imaging with synchrotron radiation using inhaled xenon as contrast agent.","doi":"10.1088/0031-9155/46/12/315","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1088/0031-9155%2F46%2F12%2F315","venue":"Physics in medicine and biology"}

We recently reported that shed soluble GPVI (sGPVI) was elevated in plasma of 159 ischaemic stroke patients compared with 159 community-based controls (P=0.0168), and in 29 patients with disseminated intravascular coagulation compared with healthy donors (n=25, P=0.002), consistent with a pathophysiological role for GPVI shedding from human platelets. Our new studies now show that transient exposure of human platelets to arterial or pathological shear rates of 3000–10,000 s−1 for 1–5 min ex vivo in a cone-plate viscometer, in the absence of GPVI ligand or platelet activation, activated sheddases producing a 2- to 3-fold increase in plasma sGPVI and a corresponding loss of surface GPVI from sheared platelets. Shear-induced GPVI shedding was blocked by GM6001 or GI254023, a selective inhibitor of ADAM10. In contrast to shear-induced platelet aggregation, shedding was unaffected by inhibitors of aggregation (VWF-blocking anti-GPIbα mAb, AK2, or the αIIbβ3 antagonist, RGD peptide) or by the absence of VWF in a patient with von Willebrand9s disease Type III (VWF antigen levels Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Pathological Shear Regulates ADAM10 Activity on Circulating Platelets","doi":"10.1182/blood.V118.21.2194.2194","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1182/blood.V118.21.2194.2194","venue":""}

Beside personal motivation and discipline, there are objective factors which limit the amount of available laboratory time for students. To deal with the afore mentioned problem for electrical engineering and computer science courses teaching basic concepts of computer architecture at the undergraduate level, we have devised a pocket-size prototyping system which can be controlled from any kind of computer device, here including contemporary mobile phones and tablets. The issue which we tackle in this paper is the efficient use of touchscreen devices to input assembly language code controlling the operation of the main processing unit on the prototyping system. The results of the pilot study performed, which addresses accuracy and time needed to accomplish the task, are rather encouraging, and shows that our special variant of virtual keyboard did not deteriorate students’ performance when inputting assembly code.","inCitations":["6bdcb0976b83a1fb086aa5a7469c482e0ea2f043"],"pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-39062-3_32"],"title":"Improving Students' Technical Skills Using Mobile Virtual Laboratory: Pilot Study of Assembly Language Input Methods for Touchscreen Devices","doi":"10.1007/978-3-642-39062-3_32","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-39062-3_32","venue":"SouthCHI"}

Mais ces deux aspects ont egalement eu pour consequence l'extension des revendications portees par ces associations, qui, de revendications pour le logement des immigres, se sont etendues a la revendication de toute une gamme de droits sociaux.

Furthermore, we wanted to investigate whether data collected with an AIMS are suitable for comparable clinical investigations. Over a 3-yr period (January 1, 1997, to December 31, 1999), data sets of 27,626 patients who were admitted postoperatively to the PACU were recorded online by using the automated anesthesia record keeping system NarkoData(R) (IMESO GmbH, Hüttenberg, Germany). Ten patient-related, 5 operative, 15 anesthesia-related, and 4 postoperative variables were studied by using forward stepwise logistic regression. Not only can the probability of having PONV in the PACU be estimated from the 3 previously described patient-related (female gender, odds ratio [OR] = 2.45; smoker, OR = 0.53; and age, OR = 0.995) and one operative variables (duration of surgery, OR = 1.005), but 3 anesthesia-related variables (intraoperative use of opioids, OR = 4.18; use of N(2)O, OR = 2.24; and IV anesthesia with propofol, OR = 0.40) are predictive. In implementing an equation for risk calculation into the AIMS, the individual risk of PONV can be calculated automatically.\n\n\nIMPLICATIONS\nThe aim of this study was to investigate predictors for postoperative nausea and vomiting by using online anesthesia records. With the help of computerized data evaluation, 7 of 34 variables could be detected as risk factors. By implementing an automatic score into the record keeping system, an individual risk calculation could be made possible.","inCitations":["b74e285fca4a1b9111cacb3f735a4d6c91eb0ed6","cce2bd34f00d9cc680d5f83cc0d52f6c72ae2e7a","10926a67e4a885d9fd2c9d24afdb39d59fcb8634","cc5fbb0dee69696497545c2ccd370de2c78420df","3d06df8c2e693afeb7564cb0915ae9fbdd7c7479","cd6893e07ae486c331e522ff9ebbf18201572685","5241b5aaf818bcbcc1a13b98c27ef30ecaa2969b","c64368eb1e3ae75e5add77bd80bf5dd737ec6b89","cb32ca76081ff64a30a7a4542269389827f492e7","474da6041a9b330e6a2bc2971b01b521631a5608","cdd1e9b409fd6e44248c0a2dc2f88b58da9549bd","7fd1b8fe4b8fdcc686a18fc043716bb243082fcc","29322e044f2b069f772858306982340c4ec4c399","d39492d03de9b6b7e5991feac32096f6452cc6c0","0ecfce867da100f66bde8d0bd59cd9bc1fdde688","325f0e509d382e0c9eca1324a3240d9cb4ea2a6c","b4171046da6a822cc8acebf70022d74ce51dde5b","6d7b6c01def2a81856a55f53531a1541b6aedd9e","9e030e0eaddf03e92ddf26e0745999b7f667922e","11df9096b3c16e8255aca86c92694e01262dd193","7e7d421815215c8cfc95ef236fc6e31b5f1b1d3f","433ca038a7ca45af8b6a1608bc55e93a3d2dcf67","ef318d7613f4a5651b2938375d35232a856cf0d1","06aa83f8f0d5d9dea7cc1e888a9eb3814997b9f6","45ea0d3da1e34fddc14a1f2cad2dedb000bf3c71","fb4c929de4e5995afda3bf3ed66a635aae3088d8","44ef1658fc9275e0ee20a317235673d2dfdbf51d","8731dbc7727398f0bb7599bf2eee0bf693a60550","5a545fc919495e5f8627e6736cb44bf20bb47ba6","35ca780cf1e613ac7ee82c6d9fc6269969b34785","dfdb8eab6711a1ba548b08c3b3c9c2b917a71380","04282a6144a5e11d62e6fa5cb17f7967bc65f83e","1246ec149352e720970cf906dc751bf0288bc40e","d2a4c816a1bae6b32f4845709b4625e2a004efad","fdb7f57826c107dc82adec58f8f0d4b9d250cf2b","ed752dc5ffce8c9c1a5b79e756fe8ebf53dab722","f844e36be4e88567fa38266f123367394bd1e057","9b4491f10df97ec673b7f44b1b0b10fe3d5da1b5","363e5b0247b8c0f7be8192c45cda945c3114b5e7","62e84e9324493ac7e7aa6526dc1bea04dcc694ae","ac73bc2b3ad517c6ac113ee5946512dc25a59c1c","82b00c71ab4ab138f669521d57816d4925e6fca0","e1fcfa52bab66a42a963514ddc4f6a0fa8ae69f7","d4b05457460ae50b9b296a6ce2740867a37ce0a7","24a88dcb51ab98142238c5c79ed41970db74bae4","47ec6b113cdbe6033c1f34c45ac3984b81092f0c","05e91fc7b7b0ab795eff6af90c16b7ea517a0b3a","c97638ad9ad185ec7030a151916207258da753a5","0e59b142cf12d916bfa07a7b7ed978c31fd0e2f0","931419d3dbd1de0f6553aa673fe9e18c39a84401","7ddc6392cf23967c8bd862fec1f85e1d2afd0a45","3818b748287bc6202d2de80ae0e91e85113fce42","e322cbe154b65badf5f858dc3ca4d44a246f5061","bb176b09d2a75e1694ad8332209543cf2f6bc7ac","a4ca2b69c4c07508c120bb26a26a037c00866cc0","dac0e20bd0a270268b1c3b6dc65fe0bdf09481c7","e52909b3745b055fe2ccddb92cdff61466cbd2de","5442b9d0f992287af8056698b2ddde4d475af329","27103987f4c225c22ff2c537a2d0bf187922ada9","bca448af9bf343575d9dc35b6dc0de9e531cfa26","f90b2bc2da42e69031b932ee4b804bed85c465f8","64ec08baed4d4b899cc4e4c5aa9a4110ebcccb08","0725ff88ecedf010b3c30a089e22fbec2833d338","6970925b8920c7028c571ed1c70dfdf649302e1f","facec49f8c61cb6a4d0194235a79b2ec3741951d"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"The use of an anesthesia information management system for prediction of antiemetic rescue treatment at the postanesthesia care unit.","doi":"10.1097/00000539-200105000-00023","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1097/00000539-200105000-00023","venue":"Anesthesia and analgesia"}

The enhancement of portal pressure, nitric oxide (NO) level, pro-inflammatory mediators and down-regulation of Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 1 (SOCS1) are involved in this situations. The present study seeks to examine the beneficial effect of thalidomide on cirrhotic cardiomyopathy.\n\n\nMaterials and Methods\nThe male rats were grouped as: Sham/saline, Sham/Thalidomide, Bile Duct Ligation (BDL)/saline and BDL/Thalidomide. BDL model of cirrhosis was used. In the treatment groups, thalidomide (200 mg/kg/day) was administrated by intragastrial gavage for 28 consecutive days, the chronotropic response was assessed in isolated atria by isoproterenol stimulation. Serum levels of NO, IL-6 and TNF-α hepatic level were evaluated. The intrasplenic pulp pressure (ISPP) as the portal pressure and histopathologic assessment were assessed. Real time RT-PCR was used for the evaluation of SOCS1 gene expression.\n\n\nResults\nOur results showed that thalidomide administration could significantly increase the atrial chronotropic response in BDL animals. The increased level of portal pressure decreased by thalidomide in BDL animals. Thalidomide could ameliorate the histopathological conditions of BDL rats. Furthermore, the chronic treatment by this drug diminished the elevated levels of NO, TNF-α and IL-6 in BDL animals. On the other hand, hepatic SOCS1 expression was up-regulated by thalidomide treatment in this group.\n\n\nConclusion\nThalidomide improves the chronotropic hyporesponsiveness of isolated atria in BDL. This effect is probably mediated by the inhibiting NO, TNF-α and IL-6 production, reducing portal pressure and increasing the expression of SOCS1.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://ijbms.mums.ac.ir/article_13886_0783b44401da8d35992d9e5ddb361bea.pdf"],"title":"Thalidomide attenuates the hyporesponsiveness of isolated atria to chronotropic stimulation in BDL rats: The involvement of TNF-α, IL-6 inhibition, and SOCS1 activation","doi":"10.22038/ijbms.2019.32256.7742","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.22038/ijbms.2019.32256.7742","venue":"Iranian journal of basic medical sciences"}

However, it is currently unknown whether changes in 5-HT mechanisms in this brain area may selectively affect defensive responses associated with specific subtypes of anxiety disorders recognized in clinical settings. To address this question, we evaluated the effect of the intra-LS injection of the 5-HT(1A/7) receptor agonist 8-OH-DPAT (0.6, 3.0, 15.0 nmol) in male Wistar rats exposed to the elevated T-maze animal model of anxiety. This test allows the measurement of two behavioral defensive responses in the same rat: inhibitory avoidance and escape behavior. In clinical terms, these responses have been respectively related to generalized anxiety and panic disorder. The effects of 8-OH-DPAT were compared to those caused by a standard anxiolytic compound, the benzodiazepine receptor agonist midazolam (MDZ, 20 nmol). We also investigated whether the intra-LS injection of the 5-HT(1A) receptor antagonist WAY-100635 (0.37 nmol) was able to block the effects of 8-OH-DPAT. All animals were also tested in an open field for locomotor activity assessments. Results showed that whereas intra-LS administration of MDZ decreased avoidance latencies, suggesting an anxiolytic action, 8-OH-DPAT caused the opposite effect. Neither drug affected the escape performance. Intra-LS administration of WAY-100635 blocked the anxiogenic effect caused by 8-OH-DPAT. No changes to locomotion were detected in the open field. The data suggests that LS 5-HT(1A) receptors are involved in the control of inhibitory avoidance behavior and that a failure in this regulatory mechanism may be of importance to the physiopathology of generalized anxiety disorder.","inCitations":["4b2fff92c9af739c099277de6c7413fa2519f0ba","d31c81703a1c21e6b27883a884d80d0801aa84f0","d691c12dda063bb6d02617806c5cc1da8ea8dc0c","20b81470d7d68372701165516c2a9e7d0acc5fef","31d526546da9515d5de83fac2c90bc5aeacf2515","2a8af5a75788031f93a5ff58f81f64d41243a711","c1af4681285990810763c1ed8b31105f48c905f1","ea82f8f696368d2e592aa0329342c149d8bc2b80","8748034530cadf7514d80b3a9874c9ae7cfbed8c","97ec6c9556b8e76164f1b00451033549c67da324","18743a3f1a3de722168733142dc5cc67eb46976a","59da94d4168fcfa35ae560b911b62fb79ab5dd64"],"pdfUrls":["https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0091305708000221","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0091305708000221?dgcid=api_sd_search-api-endpoint"],"title":"5-HT1A receptors of the lateral septum regulate inhibitory avoidance but not escape behavior in rats","doi":"10.1016/j.pbb.2008.01.007","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pbb.2008.01.007","venue":"Pharmacology Biochemistry and Behavior"}

The study adds to the growing stream of research by investigating how the information age's emerging social challenge – the digital divide – influences rural partnerships and development. Burgeoning literature evidences that the digital divide encompasses not one but many discontinuities. This paper reconceptualises the digital divide concept and explores exactly how its shocks and tensions impact rural partnerships and development. Results of this research indicate that the digital divide is a threat to the performance of rural partnerships, which consequently renders rural development outcomes unsustainable, lopsided and non-participatory. This paper recommends the need for a more responsive and localised approach to rural development partnerships that can enable disadvantaged groups to participate in today's digitally connected economy and society.","inCitations":["8589a2f0efec65084476dbfca10a17b5d2f3d617","f354901cc6363f311050cb7ca22544e9aab16c33","3bff00cfa0e91194149caed5e2d0d443ea1b04f3","7b2426f5f7d816da844233e4a5cb171257d7b87a","bd364ff9fdae635bc1951989179cce031ed8a93b","b2338ab84d066f1aa6216782bf80f9a2f136cb8c","ff7568f027f8d1d38d8446f752525857bbdd2a77","8e2a42042df1a9a4eea2f8407def2bd898343f57","81186c43bc4d7dcb4da4e5431b6abe004f475cc4","58b6de2930de9d64d2a402dc206f096601ffc8bb","29d10c10900d5495252db7d1a4c9ca96cc9120ce"],"pdfUrls":["https://apo.org.au/sites/default/files/resource-files/2015/12/apo-nid137851-1170171.pdf"],"title":"Towards understanding digital divide in rural partnerships and development: a framework and evidence from rural Australia","doi":"10.1016/j.jrurstud.2015.12.002","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jrurstud.2015.12.002","venue":""}

Nevertheless, a number of academically talented young people still hesitate to attend college. This puzzle motivates this paper to test for whether college education is a risky investment. To measure the riskiness of college attendance, I estimate the risk differential in earnings between college attendees and high school graduates. This paper copes with selection bias problems and distinguishes permanent earnings risk from transitory earnings risks. Evidence indicates that investing in a four-year college education is indeed risky, suggesting that, under certain circumstances, the riskiness of college attendance is an important factor in the schooling choice.","inCitations":["964ee44121a9e0c78cec3bddb572756eb802fbc1","af5b49dda8ac7dcf9d15264610ef89b6b84d7f8d","a141cc397792c3b17c6419a98358ab0337094a6c","46a445a6d39599ee12dbc72f46fff31c81f05cbb","26df84c0cb52970f061ab2f6693e653369912a12","453075b1d721da26074ec81ea3ef6b896759740b","eb6cfec57aecf5f765d52639013cbce8d7a4fa17","27afc05f30aa1df946223d45c944ba5eeabb6223","4d1b75a43ac5fc0d4e24cd7dceb4a371c6fd3bad","1d88af38e9b72018334e5c9b24a4d62687239497","b5c906ae97113572268746f04fe8c1838f371331"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.albany.edu/economics/research/workingp/2001/Risky.pdf","http://www.albany.edu/econ/dp/Risky.pdf","https://cirano.qc.ca/realisations/grandes_conferences/capital_humain/avr02/Chen-21-04-02.pdf","https://www.albany.edu/economics/research/workingp/2001/Risky.pdf"],"title":"Is Investing College Education Risky","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

The contribution of this study for management is the insight, that to facilitate the KM culture in their organisation, they should encourage results-oriented, solidarity, sociability, and strong cultures, and discourage a job-oriented culture. At the same time, encouraging a strong culture and a KM culture will increase the employees' intention to directly manage their knowledge in the KM process; but plays a significantly negative moderate role between the KM cultures and an individual's KM intention.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"The relationship between organisational culture and knowledge management culture","doi":"10.1504/ijiscm.2019.10026373","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1504/ijiscm.2019.10026373","venue":""}

Frequent cycle slips or data gaps in real-time operation force repeated re-convergence. Repairing cycle slips with GPS data alone in severely blocked environments is difficult. Adding GLONASS data can supply redundant observations, but adds the difficulty of having to deal with differing wavelengths. We propose a single-difference between epoch (SDBE) method to integrate GPS and GLONASS for cycle slip fixing. The inter-system bias can be eliminated by SDBE, thus only one receiver clock parameter is needed for both systems. The inter-frequency bias of GLONASS satellites also cancels in the SDBE, so cycle slips are preserved as integers, and the LAMBDA method is adopted to search for cycle slips. Data from 7 days of 20 globally distributed IGS sites were selected to test the proposed cycle slip fixing procedure with artificial blocking of the signal; cycle slips were introduced for all un-blocked satellites at each epoch. For a 30-s sampling interval, the average success rate of fixing can be improved from 73 to 98 % by adding GLONASS. Even for a 180-s sampling interval, GPS + GLONASS can achieve a success rate of 81 %. A real-time kinematic PPP experiment was also performed, and the results show that using GPS + GLONASS can achieve continuous high-accuracy real-time PPP without re-convergence.","inCitations":["b1794883066ea7247e20c16d490989a7389e1fe8","7c23218356182682f6fa72f72cebf350638e7ead","10b93ef63315998b17502b9f3c5974475fb757cf","f2d45fee17cb77c7a83934754d4a498ea3e25995","76d5dd53f326a9990564926a0c5b7110437d5582","da8900259e99e6574f913d8acd23eb0328e50de4","42f4323b9fcb31ed40fd799ca5ee6fcbefdf72ec","6877b58097f8ed372455ef32a4f290d2825ed92e"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"A cycle slip fixing method with GPS + GLONASS observations in real-time kinematic PPP","doi":"10.1007/s10291-015-0439-3","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10291-015-0439-3","venue":"GPS Solutions"}

Keeping one group as a healthy control; goats of three groups were given lead acetate 50 mg kg −1 , cadmium chloride at 10 mg kg −1 , or lead acetate 50 mg+cadmium chloride 10 mg kg −1 body weight orally daily for 42 days to study the effects of concurrent exposure to lead (Pb) and cadmium (Cd) on kidney function. Serum urea nitrogen, creatinine, PSP clearance time and histopathological lesions were considered for monitoring renal function. Significant increase in urea nitrogen, creatinine and PSP clearance time, and the presence of histopathological lesions were observed in all the three intoxicated groups. These changes were more pronounced and their onset was earlier in Pb intoxicated goats than Cd or Pb+Cd intoxicated goats. The findings showed that concurrent exposure of goats to Pb and Cd did not enhance nephrotoxic effects produced by either of the metals given separately and Cd reduced toxic effects of Pb indicating a possible antagonistic relation between the two metals.","inCitations":["e613ce972eb27ef0f83711f49ba4ddb9b7a0e1a5","e705defd19b1bb2f2f175512a91b080bf33c4419","a477c08b439f817ad3eac4b75488045d031450c6","65ed41520cc933ac23331ed3cbaf6dcccad51dba","4b6747267112edb22edf303c4c20564ce9defa90","925e580d6f2fca41b01d32390d85073ae998cc6e","48ee9cece3e86a266200f76cea3eeecd8923c8ab","acd3845843d750e50b4a9c288814f633f1092a64","04d86f396a5cdb47aab8cee7d46b9008e4959b02","4da7aac8719e4a7ab23793d64bb2da12b03ba7be"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Effects of concurrent exposure to lead and cadmium on renal function in goats","doi":"10.1016/S0921-4488(97)00083-7","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/S0921-4488%2897%2900083-7","venue":""}

In such models individuals who would have died in an earlier regime are instead revived and returned to the population to face the same age-speciﬁc mortality risks as the rest of the population. A closely related literature has examined inequality in terms of the number of years of potential life that are lost to deaths. Objective: The paper combines several results from formal demography to illustrate the potential gains in life lived from a sequence of revivals, in which everyone is revived 0, 1, 2,. . . times. Contribution: Mathematical analysis yields two new results: A generalization of Vaupel and Canudas-Romo’s e† index to second and higher-order revivals, and an analytical expression that relates gains from revivals to the covariance of remaining life expectancy and cumulative mortality.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://www.demographic-research.org/volumes/vol42/17/42-17.pdf"],"title":"Revivorship and life lost to mortality","doi":"10.4054/demres.2020.42.17","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.4054/demres.2020.42.17","venue":""}

Only by its inclusion in the therapeutic regime can the present best level of about 20 per cent survival be achieved in any large group of patients. Preliminary biopsy is essential and there is no evidence that it is harmful even if followed by a delay of many days before definitive treatment. In patients treated initially by radiotherapy, selective amputation some 6 months later only in patients free of metastases, carries just as good a prognosis for the group as a whole as initial primary amputation in all patients. This method, first described by Cade, is widely practiced in the United Kingdom and spares many patients who develop early metastases following initial radiotherapy from unnecessary mutilating surgery shortly before inevitable death. Local recurrence may follow retention of a femoral stump following amputation for osteosarcoma at the most common site in the lower femoral metaphysis. There are cogent arguments in favor of hip disarticulation in such patients although they do not include evidence of greater survival. The balance between the two procedures is finely drawn but is weighted in favor of disarticulation.","inCitations":["f8b863204a099f60b81fbea9b95903b42f1577f7","3cd25e5a122fb49d7e6ea5a329b851fef6da6cfd"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"The surgical management of primary osteosarcoma.","doi":"10.1097/00003086-197509000-00007","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1097/00003086-197509000-00007","venue":"Clinical orthopaedics and related research"}

The focus of this particular study was to synthesize the truncated neplanocin A fleximers to investigate their potential anti-protozoan activities by inhibition of S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase (SAHase). The three fleximers tested displayed poor anti-trypanocidal activities, with EC50 values around 200 μM. Further studies of the corresponding ribose fleximers, most closely related to the natural nucleoside substrates, revealed low affinity for the known T. brucei nucleoside transporters P1 and P2, which may be the reason for the lack of trypanocidal activity observed.","inCitations":["9905e0370b90e4b8c5648a8858c45ab249bd3389","749032f90319588d31d4ebcab36ba83d8eb546f6","f8540b3d4f17c2c73a9f6bf6f76b2d9350f85c46","f2b621c67b229ea0ece7edf5494082cc08f88d7e"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/19/12/21200/pdf"],"title":"Design and Synthesis of a Series of Truncated Neplanocin Fleximers","doi":"10.3390/molecules191221200","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules191221200","venue":"Molecules"}

The technique was able to modify four common materials currently used for MALDI targets (stainless steel, aluminum, indium-tin oxide glass and polymeric anchor chip). The structure of the deposited dioxide was investigated by electron microscopy, and different surfaces were compared and discussed in this study. Two standard proteins were used to test the enrichment capabilities of modified MALDI plates: casein and in-vitro phosphorylated trehalase. The enrichment of casein tryptic digest resulted in identification of 20 phosphopeptides (including miscleavages). Trehalase was used as a suitable model of larger protein that provided more complex peptide mixture after the trypsin digestion. All four possible phosphorylation sites in trehalase were identified and up to seven phosphopetides were found (including methionine oxidations and miscleavages). Two different mass spectrometers, MALDI-Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (FTICR) and MALDI-time of flight, were used to detect the phosphopeptides from modified MALDI plates after the enrichment procedure. It was observed that the desorption-ionization phenomena on the modified surfaces are not critically influenced by the parameters of the different MALDI ion sources (e.g. different pressure, different extraction voltages), and thus the presence of dioxide layer on the standard MALDI plate does not significantly interfere with the main MALDI processes. The detection of phosphopeptides after the enrichment could be done by both instruments. Desorption electrospray ionization coupled to the FTICR was also tested, but, unlike MALDI, it did not provide satisfactory results.","inCitations":["b35f4d3d046ddfa0caf321e0f7105763e93b0ac0","1f000dab63853e101a3dd773fcc80e1cf17c1e45","074cd5cd1070450665df4ffb3a3cab2575a50a35","cb2282fc1249afb17f86ceff6d8ba0299f085b8d","85380d78d4c5ca9220fac7dcf3366fe7d740c5be","bf7048d7cafa756cd6ff44925ac022c35a91620e"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"In-situ enrichment of phosphopeptides on MALDI plates modified by ambient ion landing.","doi":"10.1002/jms.3081","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1002/jms.3081","venue":"Journal of mass spectrometry : JMS"}

In order to investigate the hormone-dependence of these tumours, we established a human glioblastoma line in athymic mice. The tumour cell type was characterized using immunocytochemical methods. The influence of host sex on growth was evaluated, and hormone receptors were characterized biochemically. The histological features of the initial tumour were conserved in the hetero-transplanted tumours, which consisted of vimentin and GFAP immunoreactive astrocytes. There was a highly significant difference in tumour growth between the two sexes (P less than 0.01). In the male mice, tumours were from 2.5 to 10 times larger than in the females, the latency periods were 30% shorter, and the growth phases were characterized by periods of slow or zero growth. In addition, androgen and oestrogen receptors were detected at low levels (80-270 fmol/g tumour) in the heterotransplanted tumours especially in the males. The fact that the male tumour growth profiles resembled those of some hormone-dependent lines, and that androgen receptors were found preferentially in the male rather than in female tumours would tend to indicate that there is a hormonal influence on the growth of the heterotransplanted tumours. These results provide further evidence for an influence of sex-steroid hormones on the growth of glioblastomas.","inCitations":["ec0c42c1551257a0df5cb91eab2e9fc903426acc","cc53ca5cf3b26a0d62df3a08a537cbd7d6e0f243","c19e8f4e368b75aef9b614763d8b90808ee96e83","52a1ee5e8a664f325daec74e1703569131dd78b8","46f5eb45df3118913bc04678d1a359848424b5bd","e3830b3a1358b3ddd8fae21a2335b6e6ca305237","85534c36144e41f5a88339ce2bb46e2c753744f7","3d474d56dc43ebd22fc6ec2550bce13aea60fafe","00bd08b63a76d87062f555ada75e93067ba46b5b","f50aa8f155f805e04f16846ae1c0882ff034fab5","2a1fa2adca054e59289828f3f2e2f3b8bd2c8279","16d78596f919f3828557dd2962adebb27bf6c24c","6048e8750a85f11827eb3eea95529c207bbcb263","621792fc5199bbff9cbfbe0b56da90ab657c250f","f22986feedd440c00c6c4e5aac22a688626a3e68","e23f84d0847572ce301ba78eda94519ce81bf89c","6c80d2c28ff194aa1347c1af4d889fb7df1c787e"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Influence of host sex on the growth of a human glioblastoma line in athymic mice.","doi":"10.1111/j.1365-2990.1990.tb00943.x","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2990.1990.tb00943.x","venue":"Neuropathology and applied neurobiology"}

And for positive compounds, umu test is tried.

This result suggests that new strain can become a means to screen non-mutagenic carcinogens. Intensity of mutagenic activity of organochlorine compounds in umu test decreased when S9mix was added. When 1-naphthol and quinoline are nitrated, they become to produce O2-. Aromatic compounds existing in tar can get ability to produce O2- after nitrated and can cause DNA damage.

Diante disso, este estudo pretende analisar o panorama do consumo de lacteos no Brasil e no mundo, tracando os fatores que afetam este consumo, bem como as principais tendencias para os proximos anos. Em media, 116,5 equivalentes kg de leite sao consumidos por cada habitante por ano e essa quantidade tem aumentado a taxas de 1,2% ao ano. Os niveis de consumo variam consideravelmente entpre os paises e sao influenciados principalmente pela renda. No Brasil, a industria de laticinios e o segundo segmento mais importante da industria de alimentos. O consumo aparente per capita no Brasil em 2018 foi de 166,4 L/hab., valor que ainda se encontra abaixo do consumo verificado em outros paises desenvolvidos (cerca de 250-300), mas bem acima do total consumido ha duas decadas.

The number of people using passenger ships around the globe is increasing worldwide. Similar to other transportation systems, passenger safety is critical in maritime shipment. As emergency evacuation processes for ships are highly different from and more complicated than those for buildings and other vehicles, many researchers have published a vast range of documents related to this peculiar research area. However, there is a tangible lack of sufficient literature review studies that investigate marine emergency evacuation (MEE). That being the case, the potential of marine transportation and the effect of emergency evacuation operation on life safety have inspired the proposal of this study. This paper offers a review of the available literature on MEE modelling, analysis and planning during the period from 1973 to 2017 using a systematic approach.

Compared to saline-treated controls there was a significant enhancement of biliary gamma-glutamyltransferase excretion after ethanol infusion for 5 hr by 166% (22.1 +/- 2.8 microU/min/100 g body weight vs. 58.2 +/- 13.7; P less than 0.0125), whereas no changes or only marginal alterations have been observed for bile flow and the biliary excretion of total bile acids and alkaline phosphatase. The selective enhancement of biliary gamma-glutamyltransferase excretion by ethanol can be ascribed to an increased solubilization of the membrane-bound enzyme originating from the bile canaliculi of the hepatocytes and/or the epithelial cells of the bile ducts. Since the biliary excretion of total bile acids remained unchanged by ethanol, the observed selective solubilization of gamma-glutamyltransferase may occur by a mechanism primarily not involving total bile acids and could be linked to a direct effect of ethanol on physico-chemical properties such as an increased fluidity of liver plasma membranes.","inCitations":["616583c4cb1d3fa91258e1e4bcde3597ce2988a8","702f1f6933036a33da53f46f9a0e6b6251dac7f0","aa296ec80c876c0a488a8d74d35cd876b3f99f45","52d1644738c91fe0882e668f43ffae1efba60597"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Biliary excretion of gamma-glutamyltransferase.

Advances in diagnostic modalities including endoscopic ultrasonography and intraductal ultrasonography have provided useful information that aids in diagnosing and managing ampullary lesions. Endoscopic papillectomy can be a curative therapy for localized ampullary adenoma and have a role in the diagnosis of indeterminate ampullary lesions that may contain a hidden malignancy. However, the consensus on how and when to use endoscopic papillectomy has not been fully established. This article reviews the approach to the patient with benign or malignant ampullary lesion.","inCitations":["bc917ca5df05ff82bd5e4b417656ad105fb6e49d","da163b11312c74eaf907aedbe04df5d481f660b9","2d6cdb4ce45e0e3787b0ad3ddab7bd827658f377","7f111efefd1aa32dec9d80a611efb6b200e0a32d","e67e5e0536fd51c1b762db4e38d76d37bc3970cf","3cf679966d35116bd6a7bd0452f2a0ee078282c3","e9aab038e06f7c5203d85ef75bfbc89ba2ee33ac","a67b16aeb15c1983095c2866ea0112cee7536fd0","0f6271352acd1c7f9ca14cae1a14997ec2985a24","87a66f1a152d6b969a1815fe70fafa5c2b0dd8a1","f0395ada7ee16099a55c70cddfcd484bc900b2fa","146c89d0deadfcdd31f862f191ef551336dfd73a","351112eaca3dd3e524eb2cd66ecd6a847edef77d","b0f74de6a2a5642aa59c0a74a6dcc4f240dfc1f3","b26b8863c406f988faea675f310ec82cc2bdd9a7"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Endoscopic approach to the patient with benign or malignant ampullary lesions.","doi":"10.1016/j.giec.2013.01.003","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.giec.2013.01.003","venue":"Gastrointestinal endoscopy clinics of North America"}

A method to predict peritoneal recurrence could be helpful in its prevention.\n\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nPeritoneal washings were prospectively obtained from 29 patients in whom R0 resection was performed. Cytological examination (CY) and real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of the peritoneal washing for the detection of cancer-related genes, CEACAM5, KRT7, KRAS, and MUC1, were performed. Clinicopathological characteristics and real-time RT-PCR results of the peritoneal washing were compared between patients whose pancreatic cancer recurred peritoneally (n = 7) and those patients who it did not recur (n = 22).\n\n\nRESULTS\nOnly one CY-positive (CY+) case was detected, and that patient recurred. MUC1 mRNA expression was significantly higher in the recurrence group (P = 0.015). Cumulative incidence-function analysis demonstrated that peritoneal recurrence rate was significantly higher in MUC1-positive (MUC1+) patients (P = 0.044). MUC1+ patients had significantly decreased disease-free survival (P = 0.009) and disease-specific survival (P = 0.031). MUC1 protein was detected in the primary tumor in 18 of 29 patients. However, no significant difference was observed in the expression of MUC1 protein in peritoneal washings from the primary tumor (P = 0.579).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nHigh expression of MUC1 mRNA in peritoneal washings is a significant risk factor for peritoneal recurrence of pancreatic cancer after R0 resection along with poor disease-specific survival. RT-PCR of MUC1 mRNA in peritoneal washing may be useful for individualization of adjuvant chemotherapy.","inCitations":["b98bd4ba6cfcf4cce153902e75de5bc0c3aff7dc"],"pdfUrls":["https://cloudfront.escholarship.org/dist/prd/content/qt4748g6fw/qt4748g6fw.pdf?t=p7t076"],"title":"RT-PCR of peritoneal washings predicts peritoneal pancreatic cancer recurrence.","doi":"10.1016/j.jss.2017.11.009","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jss.2017.11.009","venue":"The Journal of surgical research"}

A questionnaire was filled out. SPSS version 22 was used for data analysis. Descriptive statistics were comprising percentages, and frequency in order to describe knowledge, attitude, and practice. Correlations between main outcomes variables were calculated by means of Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient (r) that measures the linear relationship between two variables. P-value ≤0.05 were regarded as statistically significant.\n\n\nRESULTS\nIn the studied sample, 47% were age more than 45 years. About 71.4% of cases were females. The level of knowledge and attitude had 'good' in 73.6%, and 87.7% respectively but level of practice had poor in 45% of patients. There were good correlations between knowledge, attitude and practice. Significant positive linear correlation between knowledge and attitude (r = 0.503, P < 0.001), knowledge and practice (r = 0.337, P < 0.001), and statistically significant linear correlation between attitude and practice (r = 0.235, P < 0.001).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe overall knowledge and attitude were good, while diabetes-related practice were poor. However results indicate that an increase in knowledge will increase attitude, and practice. A better educational program on diabetes should be conducted to improve patients' attitude, and practice towards diabetes.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"The knowledge, attitude and practice among diabetic patient in central region of Saudi Arabia.","doi":"10.1016/j.dsx.2019.07.049","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dsx.2019.07.049","venue":"Diabetes & metabolic syndrome"}
