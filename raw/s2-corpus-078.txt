It shares a significant genome homology with the common domesticated rice Oryza sativa. Exploiting the fact that the two species are highly related but O. meridionalis has superior heat tolerance, experiments were undertaken to identify the impact of temperature on key events in photosynthesis. At an ambient CO(2) partial pressure of 38 Pa and irradiance of 1500 µmol quanta m(-2) s(-1), the temperature optimum of photosynthesis was 33.7 ± 0.8°C for O. meridionalis, significantly higher than the 30.6 ± 0.7°C temperature optimum of O. sativa. To understand the basis for this difference, we measured gas exchange and rubisco activation state between 20 and 42°C and modeled the response to determine the rate-limiting steps of photosynthesis. The temperature response of light respiration (R(light)) and the CO(2) compensation point in the absence of respiration (Γ(*)) were determined and found to be similar for the two species. C3 photosynthesis modeling showed that despite the difference in susceptibility to high temperature, both species had a similar temperature-dependent limitation to photosynthesis. Both rice species were limited by ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate (RuBP) regeneration at temperatures of 25 and 30°C but became RuBP carboxylation limited at 35 and 40°C. The activation state of rubisco in O. meridionalis was more stable at higher temperatures, explaining its greater heat tolerance compared with O. sativa.","inCitations":["d7588f235cc4579fa177497360eb897092db4f05","2323da9accf4c89ab22cd0b39e16dc22e8fcf46e","4909a61a1d0c513ee42db2b4ce7ead58250d55d4","34e70919c18eff2ba8bffb2701674a781a10f6f2","bf52259ea74cd6c8a49b6ba17124d2aa87b00ca6","f8adfc0e235787e31b079fb12a62164bb9b5eddb","2b139010a816c2c45d6f107c05a36afdb9585afc","5e78531372dff28dbc55eeccef4eeff8856de509","c1b3140a5147e49ff179a696e5836a841859191c","80a1f878ec695fbcdfb8a29079d42a395bd29a7a","3dc5373c8faae0f1e62a8a79e78e5a7111c79bb8","33a8c4eedfe911e1b88f863c0c0cb98c2df8de18","0fc6bba6a53dd431d0b562bab35e2080a4e0fc91","5b0f4d996baaee5ccd7845aea2f4ca968958c723","d6228d2bbfae3d67397853ff8ef2e684955c4f27","119c31c4f0b79c0888bd24b5246b0018bf0c9283","74b23eaaf122e3fc635224f753e97a9fbe01053d","dfdc6a410bf6cd4c1138570c125cba8fa317385e","5cc6e03621de8e893c7fcbf07159358a549eb789","f1acafbcb933bf811cd5b43917790dafa0b11c73","a39224d02fdef5e81f0a48d56100ca91484d45c0","41e28e2cf6530dfedd42cde54accfc953776d140","934d5b02d1d7c592ecc83bcd89f63bb141d6da5a","4f942f626b25bb4ae62f757800eaaec19933f7ee","cd7b9ebcd13937ff33edacc6f4fa43a81dab556e","cd3e439ae85ced875e6e454ee423165882dffa15","a08bf251ab85c58b0cc7c593110d2977d5b17004","fed353a00bdb1b0e8f566c93789f8715dd046f17","701693ef05b034e63e00585311f9abc45c6ce780","ca82ce819ee0b5a1e08691e904f846e08481665b","daa11deb7aa3148a66e5e2575cdeb5b916e6148c","2a57242c71e7496f86a7dd1cbc557a6515ca5f33","d345e1dc046d6ac4197a72917c26ddbbc0b5fb45"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Rubisco activity is associated with photosynthetic thermotolerance in a wild rice (Oryza meridionalis).","doi":"10.1111/j.1399-3054.2012.01597.x","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1399-3054.2012.01597.x","venue":"Physiologia plantarum"}

The rate of albumin clearance was estimated from the luminal perfusion rate and the activity of protein bound 125I in the perfusate and plasma. Partial and total arterial occlusions of 60 minutes to 4 hours' duration produced significant increases in mucosal albumin clearance. The magnitude of the rise in albumin clearance was directly related to the duration of ischemia in both total and partial arterial occlusion models. However, the magnitude of the increase in albumin clearance was significantly greater with total arterial occlusion for any given duration of ischemia. The albumin clearance results obtained in the present study compare favorably with previously reported morphologic changes in the intestinal mucosa produced by both total and partial occlusion of the superior mesenteric artery. The agreement between morphologic and physiologic measurements indicates that mucosal albumin clearance may be a useful tool for studying the pathophysiology of intestinal ischemia.","inCitations":["38ee6943691c8a441ac06d4a4410123965a45f7d","48798bde11217af1e23e768312cd327da570878d","f86f25031856cb3801f4197b5f23350e4d604c83","81556dca1db4fb2039cd2c45a4bd4508790057d8","c89f7fcf71a01b9ca54c9a9f14a3bb377af4ee25","8284af2a70466aab5ed86d83804838b9826a6348","6141a9fdeb57cc8ab9ff54635e0911be3a259c4d","38483d03cb1772776ceb0cb736efb4e4cc484de6","f243281fc9c8f038faf3d118c013c2cc2d209be0","13db01638c0dd6aba1e2955a92a05c7141e13310","7b10e191e20fe7f121658b615916943bf5596c20"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Comparison of partial and complete arterial occlusion models for studying intestinal ischemia.","doi":"","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"Surgery"}

If empirical studies demonstrate effectiveness, virtual environments (VEs) could be of considerable benefit to persons with cognitive and functional impairments due to traumatic brain injury, neurological disorders, and learning disabilities. Testing and training scenarios that would be difficult, if not impossible, to deliver using conventional neuropsychological methods are now being developed to take advantage of the attributes of VEs. VR technology allows for the precise presentation and control of dynamic multi-sensory 3D stimulus environments, as well as the recording of all behavioral responses. This paper will focus on the progress of a VR research program at the University of Southern California that has developed and investigated the use of a series of VEs designed to target: 1. Molecular visuospatial skills using a 3D projectionbased ImmersaDesk system. and 2. Attention (and soon memory and executive functioning) processes within ecologically valid functional scenarios using a Virtual Research V8 Head Mounted Display (HMD). Results from completed research, rationales and methodology of works in progress, and our plan for future work will be discussed. Our primary vision has been to develop VR systems that target cognitive processes and functional skills that are of relevance to a wide range of patient populations with CNS dysfunction. We have also sought to select cognitive/functional targets that intuitively appear well matched to the specific assets available with the VR equipment that is available for our use.","inCitations":["1dd420022f75fc32c182cb4cd610dcb6619498f0","e5db9fa300fc4579a96a9d68d2b49fe9803f0256","9cdeb583e4fa2c357fbe075bb4500f916120ce85","cc557221259f5bdf029c6e39364bc403b991eeb3","3fb64217d17548d5091f445abe0a43f16ebf39b1","648e548c749ce9de3eb1f8c1d1c1456f3cafd6a3","af5841073d42ca4740ca39c584b789658a32a176"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.icdvrat.org/2000/papers/2000_26.pdf","http://playpen.icomtek.csir.co.za/~acdc/assistive%20devices/Artabilitation2008/archive/2000/papers/2000_26.pdf"],"title":"Virtual reality applications for the assessment and rehabilitation of attention and visuospatial cognitive processes: an update","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

This shift will move electricity supply awayfrom the highly centralised universal service quality model with which weare familiar today towards a more dispersed system with heterogeneousqualities of service. One element of dispersed control is the clusteringof sources and sinks into semi-autonomous mu grids (microgrids).Research, development, demonstration, and deployment (RD3) of mu gridsare advancing rapidly on at least three continents, and significantdemonstrations are currently in progress. This paradigm shift will resultin more electricity generation close to end-uses, often involvingcombined heat and power application for building heating and cooling,increased local integration of renewables, and the possible provision ofheterogeneous qualities of electrical service to match the requirementsof various end-uses. In Europe, mu grid RD3 is entering its third majorround under the 7th European Commission Framework Programme; in the U.S.,one specific mu grid concept is undergoing rigorous laboratory testing,and in Japan, where the most activity exists, four major publiclysponsored and two privately sponsored demonstrations are in progress.This evolution poses new challenges to the way buildings are designed,built, and operated. Traditional building energy supply systems willbecome much more complex in at least three ways: 1. one cannot simplyassume gas arrives at the gas meter, electricity at its meter, and thetwo systems are virtually independent of one another; rather, energyconversion, heat recovery and use, and renewable energy harvesting mayall be taking place simultaneously within the building energy system; 2.the structure of energy flows in the building must accommodate multipleenergy processes in a manner that permits high overall efficiency; and 3.multiple qualities of electricity may be supplied to various buildingfunctions.","inCitations":["568d7fb8f9da685b5d83662f8bc31a87f9a2d3f4","ca30440d0d72fd974ad9a162434fd3531e23df0b","a8b6284f8ed7c425765a367439d4934d9627d34b","6d00228996ac729b9d7f1bdf350f7321789273fd","de5c67426da2fae0e1ec67d60087adb83ca1f087","41e37987120d45f003bd119d0322295ee266d60a","b342f5b9f8ac9827111601b3aba53f6ca95e0389","47bf86de6fe8988a583f1db27b7d0c25b2f5e561","d568fe1c6866ae7b341662ef5f11cae93b4287e6","a4981498e2e4e6706f79070869583bfeaa90e43b","730844ade54c13b522613267f847122f8be08ac1","a4c174652a0ecf778798387d6464785676dc5f12","e51854b39ee4fda91d9e5bf50ec091412a54f887","37b0b995bf7626364578c9c62c4abc826d0ccedf","9cd4357f0466ced0968c9d5073c7d4ffe0ee5314","5b002382564942c7da50bfab9d91fbf35315181d","dff0bf3a268db957168e8060bf77b1453a74f91a","3775dd7e0eaaa981e3d29b954a098a900fff5308","6bdeacd62474775a6fa29ccb52dadb74651b4d98","172aab81ad659e6d925eb2638576fc7468617775","f18286f9313f8db8377444edd9b0f9b79ba35f22"],"pdfUrls":["https://cloudfront.escholarship.org/dist/prd/content/qt54b7r66j/qt54b7r66j.pdf","https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc895689/m2/1/high_res_d/923467.pdf","http://eetd.lbl.gov/EA/EMP/reports/62572.pdf","https://building-microgrid.lbl.gov/sites/all/files/conference-paper-lbnl-62572.pdf"],"title":"Microgrids: An emerging paradigm for meeting building electricityand heat requirements efficiently and with appropriate energyquality","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

As Se power directly reacted with Cd(NO 3 ) 2 ·4H 2 O in the above mixed solvents, wurtzite (W) CdSe solid nanoparticles were produced. Time-dependent experiments suggested that the formation of CdSe hollow nanospheres was attributed to an inside-out Ostwald ripening process. The influences of reaction time, temperature and ethanol/oleic acid volume ratio on the morphology, phase and size of the hollow nanospheres were also studied. Infrared (IR) spectroscopy investigations revealed that oleic acid with long alkene chains behaved as a reducing agent to reduce Se powder to Se 2− in the synthesis.

Rates of bacterial ingestion and the activities of cellular acid phosphatase and beta-glucuronidase were measured simultaneously in in situ perfused right lungs by sequential staining of frozen sections for enzyme and bacteria. Quantitative measurements of enzyme activity within macrophages without ingested bacteria were made with a computer-controlled cytospectrophotometry system. Exposure to ozone resulted in diminished rates of bacterial clearance and ingestion, large increases in numbers of intra- and extracellular staphylococcal microcolonies, and an absence of enzyme activity for macrophages containing bacterial microcolonies. Enzyme activity was unimpaired in macrophages without ingested bacteria. These results, in which absence of enzyme activity occurred only in macrophages subjected to the dual insults of ozone exposure and ingested bacteria, prove a relationship between impairment in bactericidal capacity and cellular activities of lysosomal enzymes.","inCitations":["93e809629291b2464df86ac430cfba5bc4bfbee4","37204d2c79f0ec81a19fcb80188fb44f76d2a2e3","c273d1fea83ab0107c5079469f30a427e5117c79","8045de5d0a9a35b6cdf90c03e85c3736db486d82"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Effect of ozone on lysosomal enzymes of alveolar macrophages engaged in phagocytosis and killing of inhaled Staphylococcus aureus.","doi":"10.1093/infdis/138.3.299","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1093/infdis%2F138.3.299","venue":"The Journal of infectious diseases"}

Effective management of this huge data is interesting but faces many challenges in accuracy and processing. When a term huge data arrives then a recent and growing field namely BIG DATA comes into the act as it becomes a mass attracter of industry, academia and government for efficient processing of variety of huge data. This paper surveys a various technologies and the different areas where big data is implemented currently with a help of cloud environment [1] and its complete architecture [13]. Following it also explains about the different map reduce techniques and the framework that is being implanted for processing such huge data. Finally we discuss the future on big data processing with the cloud environment and the challenges [28] faced at these areas.","inCitations":["89b06a06ce4e00ac534d73450d93aa804d3b923f","88acde1e4cadb4e1aa2fc36d672ae08627869bc1","ee786cb8276a6a93dd05c800df04c3033c54440c","800cc3e102dbe1c61e32d05f188c7b8f95837152"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"A Comprehensive Survey on Variants And Its Extensions Of Big Data In Cloud Environment","doi":"10.1145/2743065.2743097","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1145/2743065.2743097","venue":"ICARCSET '15"}

Alzheimer's disease (AD) and vascular dementia (VaD) constitute the two main dementia types. Differentiating them encompasses anamnesis, neurological examination, laboratory and neuroimaging exams and neuropsychological assessment. Neuropsychological assessment produces different findings for each dementia type, and reveals those areas most impaired as well as those most preserved. The aim of the present article was to describe the role of neuropsychology in diagnosing dementia and achieving a differential diagnosis between AD and VaD. A general overview follows of the most widely known instruments used to assess cognitive function in dementia, and the cognitive changes seen in AD and VaD. The conclusion drawn was that there is significant overlap in cognitive changes between both these dementia types, while each type has its own specific characteristics which are identifiable and quantifiable on neuropsychological assessments and provide the basis for reaching a differential diagnosis.","inCitations":["c61488ec1e13168e24247f5bd16bc3b937028940","3d4c998bbedb6ca0fa73ce1bdded905245c7765b","2f1c1842e2bb88b452c911a2bff4daa859d2fa95","bd8e1d86ef320ec0ff632fd7de25860e2f283eb7","a34d96c686414ce40878fc9f71d40ad20cefe2c9","244d9ea5702f4b1263d832972bfa01e45892acc3"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.demneuropsy.com.br/imageBank/PDF/v3n3a07.pdf","http://www.scielo.br/pdf/dn/v3n3/1980-5764-dn-3-03-00214.pdf","http://www.redalyc.org/pdf/3395/339529014007.pdf"],"title":"Role of neuropsychological assessment in the differential diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease and vascular dementia","doi":"10.1590/S1980-57642009DN30300007","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1590/S1980-57642009DN30300007","venue":"Dementia & neuropsychologia"}

Notably, the ACA has created the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation, which is developing and testing promising new models to improve the quality of care provided to Medicare beneficiaries while reducing spending. These new models are part of an effort by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to increase the proportion of traditional Medicare payments tied to quality or value to 85 percent by 2016 and 90 percent by 2018. This issue brief, one in a series on Medicare's past, present, and future, explores the evolution of Medicare payment policy, the potential of value-based payment to improve care for beneficiaries and achieve savings, and strategies for accelerating its adoption.","inCitations":["3ee8991cfd0465dda41381ca3f2173b3b5bc5f17","cc7be49898fdb151042dd119c2075f9a18c63b91","e022658779ec5fd53b418f3bb053180610e6ebc9","555d8603e1a4d176c1865924a8191294e45cd1bf","baf9cf4d3feb832f2178d8acbf9ecdfad2c7f805","324eb8a779981ebc6dfcd9dfa78b44ca823dfd6e","bda3806921fafef0efe4a1b5c88db4fae4d9e308","13429271e467091768467f327a3355d93e207318","fa75cc1910fa15c3956e4a7bc9254335cc4a1132","dbc81f7794d54f04afb5a29b857fc48f6b8c4241","524f1f2544a0554c4c15e99f7504a6fef6b4720c"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.commonwealthfund.org/~/media/files/publications/issue-brief/2015/jun/1826andersonmedicarepaymentreformaligningincentivesmcare50ibv3.pdf"],"title":"Medicare Payment Reform: Aligning Incentives for Better Care.","doi":"10.15868/socialsector.25041","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.15868/socialsector.25041","venue":"Issue brief"}

A strain was studied in which the males defecate less than females, while still ambulating less. Infants of this strain were castrated (males) or injected with testosterone propionate (females) and tested in the open field as adults. There were significant effects of these neonatal treatments on ambulation, but not on defecation, in contrast to previous reports for the latter measure in rats showing a sex difference in defecation taking the usual direction. It is suggested that absence of the usual direction of a sex difference normally under the developmental control of androgen may indicate a genotype which has escaped from such control. Finally, a number of 'sibling' effects' were observed, i.e. effects on the adult behaviour of the members of one sex in a litter produced by treatments administered in infancy to members of the other sex.","inCitations":["352fcc7bc6b79757fba7b11e7d5fedd84a910b05","78d2c717ff87d7eb962cb3e30a74692a5e3cd5b0","fab70131644c413df020737101a57d8f86eba713"],"pdfUrls":["https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/0003347275901050","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0003347275901050?dgcid=api_sd_search-api-endpoint"],"title":"Effects of neonatal castration and testosterone injection on adult open-field behaviour in rats with atypical sex difference in defecation","doi":"10.1016/0003-3472(75)90105-0","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/0003-3472%2875%2990105-0","venue":"Animal Behaviour"}

Scientists might have been trusted experts but this was of minor consequence for most people who rarely brushed with science, either in the laboratory or in the field. During the twentieth century, modern warfare probably brought about the biggest change to the speed of scientific innovation and discovery. The development of the atomic bomb, jet propulsion, radar, satellites and space flight, microelectronics and biological weapons have all produced technologies that have transformed our lives. Together with medical experimentation on humans these developments began to create the view that science could no longer remain independent from social and ethical issues. Science today is very much centre-stage and represents some 2–3 per cent of GDP in major industrialized economies. Both the benefits and the risks associated with scientific innovation are becoming more and more visible and, in our fast flowing world, scientists have a crucial role to play in assessing new hazards — both real and perceived.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Expanding liabilities, science and the precautionary principle — the greatest risk of all?","doi":"10.1057/9780230511415_5","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1057/9780230511415_5","venue":""}

Specifically it examines the relationships between Kigiqtaamiut hunters’ experiences in the world and means by which the experienced world is brought into being through hunters’ ways knowing. This work is informed by three spring hunting seasons spent as a member of a familial marine mammal hunting crew and over 20 months of fieldwork. It addresses hunters’ ways of learning, knowing and directly experiencing the reality of the phenomenal world. Exploring a multiplicity of modes and facets of experience connected to the relationships between hunters’ processual way of knowing bearded seals (Eringathus barbatus) through an experiential ethnographic investigation, I empirically examine the practices of hunting and the ethnography of hunting as linked, reflexive, and ultimately inseparable processes of coming to know. Considering the plausibility that a more rigorous presentation of a way of knowing can be realized through highlighting the reflexive and experiential interactions that shape these two concurrent phenomenological inquiries, this work suggests an “ethnography of knowing” to engage these multiple-linked processes of knowledge construction. It is suggested that separating hunters’ ways of being and knowing misconstrues the depth and complexity of local knowledge as actualized in pragmatic decision-making processes in context of hunting. By examining Kigiqtaamiut/bearded seal relations, the set of hunting practices that most significantly shape the hunting mode of being in Shishmaref are explored. Collapsed into this ethnographic and phenomenological analysis of human/bearded seal ecology are the connections between hunters’ ways of knowing, local pedagogy, the structure and usage of hunting narratives and topical lexicon to convey information and the significance of place and local histories. Analysis of these intersecting and mutually informative themes highlights how hunters’ means of learning and knowing as a continuous process of experience both shape and are shaped by socio­ culturally mediated experiences with natural phenomena. This work speaks to dimensions of hunters’ ways of knowing both manifest in and shaping lived experiences. In doing so, this work furthers regional ethnography, the anthropology of knowledge studies, human environmental relations and understandings of the human condition of being-in-the-world.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://scholarworks.alaska.edu/bitstream/handle/11122/9068/Wisniewski_J_2010.pdf?sequence=1"],"title":"Come on Ugzruk, let me win: Experience, relationality, and knowing in Kigiqtaamiut hunting and ethnography","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

According to the company, the new processors are 32-bit superminicom-puters implementing the Motorola instruction set in the Edge mainframe architecture. This reportedly delivers RISC-like performance through Moto-rola's CISC-based 68000 family instruction set. The dual-processor Edge 1200 with 8M bytes of system memory, 337M bytes of hard disk storage, and the GSX Unix operating system costs around $128,000. It reputedly achieves 11 million instructions per second. The single-processor Edge 1100 in the same configuration costs $104,000. It reputedly achieves 6 MIPS. The 1000 family reputedly features an average instruction time of 1.59 cycles per instruction, with memory boards using dual surface mount technology for high density. The 32-bit processor is a VLSI implementation of a Harvard supercomputer architecture that simultaneously fetches instructions and operands over multiple 32-bit buses. The dual four-state pipelined processor overlaps the execution of multiple instructions. The CPU has two independent, decoupled pipelines: the instruction fetch pipeline and the operand executive pipeline. IFP fetches instructions and OEP decodes and executes them. Pipeline performance relies on the branch prediction unit, which consists of a 4096-entry branch cache and a 16-entry last-in/first-out return stack. The floating-point accelerator conforms to the IEEE standard 754, draft 10.0, and supports 32-bit and 64-bit floating-point formats and 8-, 16-, and 32-bit signed and unsigned integer formats. Both the Edge 1100 single-processor and the Edge 1200 dual-processor models fit into a 17-inch wide, 29-inch high cabinet that includes peripherals and up to 64M bytes of memory.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://www.computer.org/csdl/mags/co/1987/09/01663702.pdf"],"title":"New products","doi":"10.1063/1.4955473","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1063/1.4955473","venue":"Computer"}

La concienciacion feminista ha hecho percibir que un cambio real de la situacion social de la mujer que le permita salir de su historica subordinacion requiere forzosamente un cambio en el orden simbolico. Esto implica la diseccion y denuncia de estos arquetipos y la creacion de iconos alternativos mas acordes con la capacidad y el potencial de agencia de las mujeres en todos los ordenes.

Since this time many contributions have been made to the classification, phylogeny, morphology and anatomy of the group. Though the family has been known for many years, considerable differences of opinion still exist as to the number of genera and species involved. Estimates of the number of species in the family vary from 3000 to 8000. The family is closely related to the Geraniales by structure of the gynoecium, although widely separated from other families in the order by the amount of reduction in most of its flowers (Willis, 1925). Small (1933) combines the Euphorbiaceae and the Callitrichaceae into a separate order-the Euphorbiales. This is placed between the Polygalales and the Sapindales, with the Geraniales immediately preceding this group. Pax and Hoffmann (1931) placed the Euphorbiaceae and the Daphniphyllaceae in the sub-order Tricoccae of the Geraniales. The family is characterized as follows: Flowers hypogynous, actinomorphic, mostly unisexual; perianth rarely double, usually simple or wanting; androecium 1oo; ovary of 3 carpels, trilocular, with 1 or 2 suspended ovules in each cell; micropyle directed upwards and outwards, and covered with a fleshy outgrowth (caruncle). Fruit almost invariably a schizocarp-capsule, splitting into carpels, often elastically. A few of the maj or taxonomic treatmen-ts of the Euphorbiaceae have been those of Baillon (1858), Bentham and Hooker (1883), Croizat (1936-42), Engler and Gilg (1924), Jablonsky (1915), Lanjouw (1931), Mueller (1866), Pax (1890, 191024), and Pax and Hoffmann (1919-31,). Many other taxonomic publications on small groups have added much knowledge as to the size, geographic distribution, economic uses, and relationships of the family and have made many changes in the fundamental lines of classification as outlined by Pax (1890) and Pax and Hoffmann (1931). The Euphorbiaceae are recognized as one of the larger families of the dicotyledons. They are a relatively natural group, although showing many lines of evolution. The impression exists among many plantsmen that the Euphorbiaceae have a general preference for semi-desert or desert regions, but a survey of the geographic distribution of the family proves this to be erroneous. Its members live in 1 Received for publication December 8, 1942. Appreciation is extended to the various Botanic Gardens and to numerous individuals who were so cooperative in furnishing seeds, cuttings and plants used in the course of this investigation, especially to Dr. Karl Sax, Biological Laboratories, Harvard University, for facilities which he so kindly provided and Dr. Leon Croizat, Arnold Arboretum, Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts, for the generous collection of Euphorbiaceous species and his invaluable aid in the identification of much of the material. varied habitats, in many different areas of the tropical and temperate world, and exhibit considerable diversity in growth types. Because of this great diversity of form and habitat, the family is of special interest. The Euphorbiaceae are of further interest due to the great diversity of chromosome numbers and chromosome sizes both between and within socalled natural groups. Certain tribes, or other taxonomic groups, appear cytologically to be natural groups in that one basic chromosome number is found in each, while in another group nearly all the basic numbers present in the family are found, suggesting that the unit is merely descriptive and artificial and not phyletic. The study reported here is concerned primarily with chromosome number and gross morphology. It is hoped that this study may prove to be of value in future taxonomic studies. MATERIALS AND METHODS.-The materials used were grown from seed, from cuttings, or were obtained from various sources as small plants. The plants were grown in experimental plots at The Blandy Experimental Farm during the spring and summer months of 1940 and 1941. In addition to the above, fixations have been made from the collections of Dr. Leon Croizat at the Arnold Arboretum, Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts. Considering the economic importance of the Euphorbiaceae, it is remarkable that so little attention has been paid to the cytology of the group. Previous workers have largely confined their investigations to the cultivated forms of Aleurites, Hevea, Manihot and Ricinus. Undoubtedly the difficult fixation and the small size of the chromosomes have been important factors in the neglect of the family cytologically. The 2n chromosome determinations *have been made from mitotic metaphases in root-tip and stemtip, material fixed in Belling's modification of Navaschin's solution (Belling, 1930), or La Cour's 2 BE solution (La Cour, 1931), embedded according to La Cour's alcohol-chloroform-paraffin schedule, sectioned at 15 microns and stained in Newton's crystal violet-iodine stain. Stem-tips and young leaves were also fixed in Carnoy's fluid and slides prepared according 'to Baldwin's maceration, aceto-carmine technique (Baldwin, 1939). As has been observed by other investigators on Euphorbiaceous genera, the material proved variable as regards fixation, owing to the copious latex present in most genera, the mucilaginous nature of the roots, and the waxy nature of leaf bud material. Belling's solutions have been used largely for the root-tip preparations. A very satisfactory method for removing mucilage from and reducing surface tension on root-tips is obtained by putting them in the mouth and momentarily bathing them in saliva.","inCitations":["7f9f0ebc0bb1206be88352cd555707bc6ba1977c","613ebe6aa0894c8307a84692d9957ec153f25fc8","5e3a64820232866ac19f0ef986ae2ec6ae05be4f","5831928670708c98429c37d177dbf4911222898f","229cfc0107aad7bce11aed52a63c397ca4157944","2b8254c1839b1911d3e931f60827167520414947","c45b908c97dc0a0d21c858f0fe42a9f55ddb2aae","9a1ee7cb3570438cf24fc51e7472b1f63caca846","c8eb82be7ac6c14d73149b9de770d98214c1a8a3","994f693dd820afd8eaa697df78907752ef65d5cc","150df26480a1ab21943903158377343200ca45bb","daaf7e66cad61d39dd7868ee94213232f828a390","7c71cd52a4eb030ee1f86348c4f4057e4dce7d8f","9dd1e8c3184559648c120bfc5cb174c4f0166496","c65be9e64978e9bcc44e557d8fa169a2e92f6aad","a81baa7f6a1a38b226c26597282021bccb8d431e","034fc3d89577551653a494be1898e421c6e6bd96","6de8f82344e2c9884ddc93d3d071d663413676aa","d0138a43140fd0630fefaddf2a52ce263c05a435","e6960ebd670c2aee0011d7d63c90bfd4234ea7f6","62c3fd792facb18952ba6a9ebf3006083f4d09eb","3ab8e756712d41915e04297fd10c1794cdd9d1c8","49026cb8df894a73e867803fcaefde06037a6004","d219e586032cf39eb6f5a140e653164fddd4ea54","2c556a46ca93a5bb90388300dfba42a5aa30dfe2","159b8d5f407889d6e9b7540aa73fd36d1f3d5e83","16f8b6e151e91c74db0cc6038e309d6c4e2b746a","43e538aa304c7fff7a62ca985cba6c95d11f55d5","815c6d722819e5a3b59ca6df22a9f2cea009545a","04e7ed5d9eb7047b2d393689135de889e8d91f2b","d751532b00649f521ff605faee4034814e324658"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Chromosome Number and Phylogenetic Relationships in the Euphorb Aceae","doi":"10.1002/j.1537-2197.1943.tb14796.x","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1002/j.1537-2197.1943.tb14796.x","venue":""}

We have exploited the lensing potential map obtained using a previously developed map-making procedure which integrates along the line-of-sight the MS dark matter distribution by stacking and randomizing the simulation boxes up to z = 127, and which semi-analytically supplies the large-scale power in the angular lensing potential that is not correctly sampled by the N-body simulation. The lensed sky has been obtained by properly modifying the latest version of the LensPix code to account for the MS structures. We have also produced all-sky lensed maps of the so-called ψ E and ψ B potentials, which are directly related to the electric and magnetic types of polarization. The angular power spectra of the simulated lensed temperature and polarization maps agree well with semi-analytic estimates up to l ≤ 2500, while on smaller scales we find a slight excess of power which we interpret as being due to non-linear clustering in the MS. We also observe how non-linear lensing power in the polarized CMB is transferred to large angular scales by suitably misaligned modes in the CMB and the lensing potential. This work is relevant in view of the future CMB probes, as a way to analyse the lensed sky and disentangle the contribution from primordial gravitational waves.","inCitations":["0924496bf7c6f3af0600e1779714e3d60f779f86","59bf4ac2d4053f14137de2e7a2f1102f9901a797","2da6dba6e6b80851a87239531ff3558fe5f4d176","a15009824fe94183162015cfdbda22b6269c421d","ca944e82f06af1788be6c2b95473d44183d23a9a"],"pdfUrls":["http://arxiv.org/pdf/0810.4145v2.pdf","https://arxiv.org/pdf/0810.4145v2.pdf"],"title":"Lensed CMB temperature and polarization maps from the Millennium Simulation","doi":"10.1111/j.1365-2966.2009.14746.x","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2966.2009.14746.x","venue":""}

DNA was extracted from serum obtained at monthly intervals postinoculation for 52 weeks and HBV DNA was amplified using primers specific for the core region containing an insert characteristic of genotype A (nt 2 354-2 359, numbering from the EcoRI site). The amplicons were cloned into PCRScriptTM and a minimum of 15 clones per time point were sequenced in both directions.RESULTS: Both genotypes persisted for the entire followup period of 52 weeks. Genotype non-A predominated in two baboons and genotype A in one baboon. Neither genotype predominated in the fourth baboon, as shown at a 5 % level of testing.CONCLUSION: No conclusions concerning the dominance of either genotype or the natural progression or replication rates of HBV could be drawn because the pattern of the genotypes found may have been caused by sampling fluctuations at the time of DNA extraction and cloning as a result of the very low viral loads in the baboon sera.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Follow up of infection of chacma baboons with inoculum containing a and non-a genotypes of hepatitis B virus","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Multidimensional scaling and Generalised linear model analyses of their answer to a questionnaire evidenced two sources of organizing factors : (1) commitment to CAM approaches and techniques is dependent on the specific approach, and this differentiation may be related to corresponding explanatory principles such as Powerful Action, Healthy Living, and Fighting Stress and (2) broad support for CAM in general, correlated with New Age ideological cultural themes (ecology, the paranormal, Eastern wisdom) which share an underlying framework of demedicalization. It did not prove possible to cluster respondents into types, and factor analysis uncovered but a single factor. This suggests that subjects combine the organizing factors in a pragmatic blend, a finding congruent with a post-modern interpretation that emphasises the blending of high and low, ideological and practical.","inCitations":["6a658ce1d7b6f62a444bf839c69da77e89367612"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.bgu.ac.il/~dleiser/docs/cam.pdf"],"title":"Support for non-conventional medicine : Cognitive and socio-cultural coherence","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

In addition, convective clouds can also be triggered above such mountain regions when vertical velocity induced by gradient of topography lifts up an air parcel above the lifting condensation level. Since these clouds have meso-scale or more finer dynamic structures, GCM community have not paid attention to such phenomena. Higher-resolution GCMs are expected to better simulate the atmospheric disturbances by resolving such finer mountain structures. Thus, this study first evaluated topographic effects on ice clouds over mountain regions by using CloudSat and CALIPSO satellite observations (EarthCARE Research A-Train Product [Hagihara et al., 2010; Okamoto et al., 2010; Yoshida et al., 2010]). Cirriform clouds were defined by ice clouds with cloud bottom temperature colder than 253 K and convective clouds are defined by cloud top temperature colder than 273 K and cloud bottom temperature warmer than 273 K. We illustrated the characteristics of vertical profiles of ice cloud microphysical properties (ice water content and effective radii) and cloud size among ocean, land, and mountain regions.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://confit.atlas.jp/guide/event-img/jpgu2018/AAS04-06/public/pdf?type=in"],"title":"Topographic effects on ice clouds evaluated by CloudSat and CALIPSO satellite observations and a high-resolution global non-hydrostatic model","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

These systems typically present users with hierarchical arrays of icons that are sequentially selected to construct messages, which are then voiced by text-to-speech (TTS) engines. For the people who use these systems, it is important that the message construction task be fast and physically comfortable; unfortunately, current systems are often slow and require repetitive physical movements that are fatiguing. The current work aims to examine three main assumptions that are commonly made during the design of icon-based AAC systems. These assumptions may contribute to design decisions that place the major burden of work on the user rather than the system. This work aims to remove these assumptions from the design process and address the resulting problems with a systematic set of algorithms and design approaches. By mitigating the need for these fundamental design assumptions, it may be possible to shift work from the user to the system and allow for faster, less fatiguing communication. The removal of some of these assumptions may also enable future innovation in the field of icon-based AAC, and AAC in general, especially when leveraging continuous modalities, such as brain waves.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/2444800.2444808"],"title":"Semantic disambiguation of non-syntactic and continuous motion text entry for AAC","doi":"10.1145/2444800.2444808","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1145/2444800.2444808","venue":"ASAC"}

Noyes et al. (2009) published the first description of the potential interactions between a warming environment and toxicology. Four years ago, an editorial in Integrated Environmental Assessment and Management (Wenning et al. 2010) called upon members of the Society of Environmental Toxicology andChemistry (SETAC) to develop research on the potential interactions between global climate change (GCC) and environmental contaminants. An international, Pellston‐style SETAC workshop in 2011 focused on the potential influence of GCC on the foundations (chemical fate, mechanistic/population ecotoxicology) and applications (human and ecological risk and injury assessments) of environmental toxicology and chemistry. This workshop resulted in 7 articles published in Environmental Toxicology andChemistry in 2013 (Climate Change Series [CCS]) and 3 of these have achieved “SETAC top article” status as determined by internet downloads. Despite the Pellston Workshop and several SETAC calls for research, there continues to be a lack of studies seeking to understand the interactions between climate change, contaminants, and environmental risk. We were hoping for more but recognize that these are early days. We can point to several national and international reports on climate change highlighting specific plans and needs for adapting to and mitigating impacts of GCC. In 2013, the European Environment Agency (EEA) published the reports Climate Change, Impacts and Vulnerability in Europe 2012 and Adaptation in Europe—Addressing Risks and Opportunities from Climate Change in the Context of Socio‐Economic Developments (EEA 2012, 2013), and in May 2014, the United States published the Third National Climate Assessment: Climate Change Impacts in the United States (USGCRP 2014). The comprehensive 2014 report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate ChangeWorking Group II on Impacts, Adaptation, and Vulnerability (IPCC 2014) documents a number of observed and predicted effects. The interactions of GCC with land‐use change, water resource development, invasive species, increased economic activity, and biofuel crop cultivation are explicitly recognized. However, these reports do not explicitly recognize how xenobiotics can be a critical contributing factor to the risks that GCC presents to the environment. On the other hand, why would the climate change community acknowledge the importance of the altered mobility and toxicity of contaminants if the field of environmental toxicology, chemistry, and risk assessment does not advance this area of research and articulate its importance to the broader scientific community? The fundamental assumption of the Pellston work is that chemicals and climate change co‐occur and what is done to","inCitations":["b6feef36df53a20dfa82764881292d840a465307","8ff514be777c760841c3e38ca7336f5767aa4804","5a7b4ce4b671c3dcd9a87a386e5ed2bf5b4f270d","604e1519078cd7c7eec22edbe28407fd1a4566b1","e84b24c470dd1affb63914d93fe3f01634167af1","53b042149a4312198cece8b580e41c35a1524349"],"pdfUrls":["http://shell.cas.usf.edu/rohrlab/data/2014%20Landis%20et%20al.%20IEAM.pdf"],"title":"Global climate change and contaminants, a call to arms not yet heard?","doi":"10.1002/ieam.1568","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1002/ieam.1568","venue":"Integrated environmental assessment and management"}

Le but de cette étude est d’évaluer l’intérêt des températures et courbes de fusions obtenues en GAP-PCR temps réel dans le diagnostic des alpha-thalassémies. Cinq patients thalassémiques ainsi que cinq contrôles ont été évalués. Les températures de fusion ainsi que l’allure des courbes de fusion sont différentes dans les deux groupes. Cette stratégie prometteuse mérite d’être évaluée sur d’autres types de délétions.AbstractAbstractThe commonest genetic defects leading to α-thalassemia are genomic deletions encompassing one or both α-globin loci. The aim of this work was to evaluate the interest of melting curves characteristics obtained in gap real-time polymerase chain reaction for the diagnosis of α-thalassemia deletions. Five patients with known deletional α-thalassemia, and five control subjects were tested. The melting temperature and melting curve shapes of the PCR products allowed us to discriminate controls from α-thalassemic patients. This promising strategy should be further tested with samples carrying other α-thalassemic deletions.BackgroundThe commonest genetic defects leading to α-thalassemia are genomic deletions encompassing one or both α-globin loci. The aim of this work was to evaluate the interest of melting curves characteristics obtained in gap real-time polymerase chain reaction for the diagnosis of α-thalassemia deletions.MethodsFive patients with known deletional α thalassemia, —(MED)(2), —(SEA)(2), —(FIL)(1), and five control subjects were tested. Specific primers were used for each deletion. Real-time-gap PCRs, using SYBER-Green mix, were performed on a « light-cycler 480 from Roche® ». At the melting temperature, the released of the SYBER-Green dye bonded to double strained DNA is associated with a dramatic decrease in fluorescence intensity. The rate of this variation was determined by plotting the negative derivative of fluorescence vs temperature (lightcycler 480 software, Roche®).ResultsThe melting temperature (Tm) and melting curve shapes of the PCR products derived from α-thalassemic patients or control subjects, allowed us to discriminate controls from α-thalassemic patients (eg —Phil Tm = 91°C whereas control Tm = 81 and 85,6°C). Some non specific amplified products are still present, probably because of the high GC content and high homology of sequences in the α-globin cluster.ConclusionThis promising strategy should be further tested with samples carrying other α-thalassemic deletions. Nevertheless it appears reliable, cost-effective and safe offering additional benefits including minimal labor, rapid turnaround time and decreased risk of PCR carryover contamination. It may be one alternative technology available for routine diagnosis of all types of deletional α-thalassemia.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"La PCR-temps réel dans le diagnostic des alpha-thalassémies: une alternative d’avenir ?","doi":"10.1007/s11834-009-0125-2","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11834-009-0125-2","venue":""}

Upon activation in colonocytes, GPR109A potentiates anti-inflammatory pathways, induces apoptosis, and protects against inflammation-induced colon cancer. In contrast, GPR109A activation in keratinocytes induces flushing by activation of Cox-2-dependent inflammatory signaling, and the receptor expression is upregulated in human epidermoid carcinoma. Thus, depending on the cellular context and tissue, GPR109A functions either as a tumor suppressor or a tumor promoter. However, the expression status and the functional implications of this receptor in the mammary epithelium are not known. Here, we show that GPR109A is expressed in normal mammary tissue and, irrespective of the hormone receptor status, its expression is silenced in human primary breast tumor tissues, breast cancer cell lines, and in tumor tissues of three different murine mammary tumor models. Functional expression of this receptor in human breast cancer cell lines decreases cyclic AMP production, induces apoptosis, and blocks colony formation and mammary tumor growth. Transcriptome analysis revealed that GPR109A activation inhibits genes, which are involved in cell survival and antiapoptotic signaling, in human breast cancer cells. In addition, deletion of Gpr109a in mice increased tumor incidence and triggered early onset of mammary tumorigenesis with increased lung metastasis in MMTV-Neu mouse model of spontaneous breast cancer. These findings suggest that GPR109A is a tumor suppressor in mammary gland and that pharmacologic induction of this gene in tumor tissues followed by its activation with agonists could be an effective therapeutic strategy to treat breast cancer.","inCitations":["b2d97ee456388a7707525ab32a5961271ef0572c","ce09cf2dd3d5c4abe5f65e785fe0317090684576","50942c081cf41a8318b49cb39940d8d751fd3713","6de9010b9d3cd91c68eceb4916c05a2086db3cd7","c6e5c3959830e65baf40f3ffb71aa75fed6aa9c6","9d8851d7fb9a83baa0d9de22cbe1794b57dc60b7","8c663cff570eb7d08fb48ee30b4158b4a6217b63","90b17f72d674caa21f7337a98d9c08261bb1ffb6","b3e9074e80ba0e7fe4aedabbaeb64a9b94921da3","3d87e188d1ed45dcf3c0c5138c776a9fda0021bc","6950b6151821a0c56764c3744022990fdd2bce95","791b4c099c1adf1ebd67ad8b8c5c42515037bb8d","2943c19531df44bd55bad654a97bfce7f81c3453","1181bd04610db00a2a624090efa0aaecab54dae8","16393a66143a238d0a65387f0ea7f73ceb705d71","94aeb5deb2a4d4994ac2e1da4cf269e864204d55","e5ba663bd9466ebfbf08136262ad0b3fafa3c2ec","def5047e3adc2f08aa2697f3f6915cf09a74df58","734237965ef3770b12b9a5b72d4fea3d9653623c","103a0a091f0a9cfbe79ac15aab4a70ce61e4cc51","89bb0dbf5442f30b7507b18ae33953fbde01c699","c2ca01324e5a5aeaddc6f3b70a58d29278779355","88b07ad172b42caa59b8b82def16d83dbd5dc491","b95e3716576c3da603f5a01f1585beace94134e4","2198b5ad202f5d5013d5d48c30cb7aafe39de6a1","d7b9fe67e30f48261de0a5c8f30036bd9d3b35a1","f5b0b111c7f3d8fb16a0965c5bb8d00bc772bb67","43f2bcfde1963e4dbac1cc9557aef1c3be937b7a","06b5001d4d11edf77776bc88850493b3b343721c","e137fe97efc864e7e823f0911ceb098b10bc10bf","ba0e7f961fc89b27924061a9961fc6268e969956","a394ff0e739c2b89541c8c89ed68ca0e0e48294f","9fc2abaf7e9d0118383788ebc7fd8311bad91c76","8f27a88d4ed14b4a472f9eeeb8b9b3493956634a","f64ced41bdde1660e7651674dde663135d5677d1","1c72c6338ff8ce1beafa801402e95cc226ef96cf"],"pdfUrls":["http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/canres/early/2013/12/24/0008-5472.CAN-13-1451.full.pdf","http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/canres/74/4/1166.full.pdf"],"title":"The niacin/butyrate receptor GPR109A suppresses mammary tumorigenesis by inhibiting cell survival.","doi":"10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-13-1451","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-13-1451","venue":"Cancer research"}

Empirical evidence in the past few years has demonstrated that executive functions can be influenced by acute stress. The impact of acute stress on cognitive flexibility, a key aspect of executive functions, has received little attention in the literature. We present the results of two experiments conducted to examine the effect of acute stress on cognitive flexibility. Acute stress was induced using the cold pressor task. Cognitive flexibility was assessed using the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST). Across both experiments acute stress had an attenuating effect on task switching on the WCST. Our findings also indicate that this effect was moderated by the participant's gender. In Study 1, we observed that following stress exposure male participants in the stress condition made more perseverative errors than participants in the control group. In Study 2, we examined the bilateral hemodynamics in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) during acute stress induction using functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). Our analysis indicated that functional oxyHb signals fluctuated with greater amplitude than systemic components for participants in the stress group relative to those in the control group. In addition, oxyHb levels post stress induction were correlated with performance on the WCST for the male participants in the stress group only. Concordant with previous reports, our findings indicate that acute stress impacts cognitive flexibility in males and females differentially. Our work also demonstrates the feasibility of using fNIRS as a practical and objective technique for the examination of hemodynamics in the PFC during acute stress.","inCitations":["949854522a017dcf486a5b83642edde5def9039b","e3f516e172de958754c7385b7d102b88181bd228"],"pdfUrls":["https://fjfsdata01prod.blob.core.windows.net/articles/files/408220/pubmed-zip/.versions/1/.package-entries/fpsyg-09-02084/fpsyg-09-02084.pdf?rscd=attachment%3B+filename*%3DUTF-8''fpsyg-09-02084.pdf&se=2019-11-02T04:54:53Z&sig=Zn/TsJyUtb3Mae/PjRJjy3MTX%2BRADbpuHWnslh3Fot8%3D&sp=r&sr=b&sv=2015-12-11"],"title":"Acute Stress Attenuates Cognitive Flexibility in Males Only: An fNIRS Examination","doi":"10.3389/fpsyg.2018.02084","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2018.02084","venue":"Front.

Timefrequency ridge line is flrstly calculated of a received data’s mutual correlation to form a series of timefrequency dots. Time-frequency dispersion function is subsequently deflned to describe the dispersion level of the time-frequency dots according to the fact that signal energy gather around the carrier frequency and noise energy disperse evenly among all frequencies. And the dispersion threshold is set to make an existence decision of primary user’s signal. Simulations indicates: the time-frequency dispersion is robust to noise power uncertainty, receiver’s bandwidth and behaves stability with enough data length; the proposed algorithm is efiective both for normal and fading channel and maintains good detecting performance at lower SNRs.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Spectrum Sensing Based on Time-frequency Dispersion Analysis ?","doi":"10.12733/jics20104161","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.12733/jics20104161","venue":""}

The amount of preadsorbed T-hydrogen on the surface of Fe and Fe-Cu sheets markedly increased due to the addition of carbon monoxide. Methane was produced in addition to ethylene, ethane and propane on alumina-doped Fe and Fe-Cu, but did not on Fe, FeCu, Cu, and alumina-doped Cu. These results were interpreted in terms of bulk diffusion of hydrogen in Fe and the occurrence of spillover of hydrogen from Fe to alumina.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://eprints.lib.hokudai.ac.jp/dspace/bitstream/2115/25102/1/28(3)_P335-346.pdf"],"title":"TRACER STUDY ON THE DISSOLVED HYDROGEN IN Fe, Cu, AND Fe-Cu PLATES","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}
