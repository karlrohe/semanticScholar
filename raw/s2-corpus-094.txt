However, the key advantages of this method must be carefully balanced against its inherent problems such as ion implantation to the treated matrix and secondary deposition of the milled material. In this work, we report the effect of Ga + ion implantation in multilayer CoPd matrix on the materials' magnetic properties. The dependence of the effect on both the irradiation dosage and the ion energy is studied. We observe a significant effect at irradiation doses as low as 1* 10 14 ions/cm 2 , approximately 10 times lower than previously reported. However, the total magnetic moment of the medium is not affected, while the anisotropy of the material changes from out-of-plane to in-plane. No effect of implantation is observed at ion energies at and below 5 keV.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"The Effect of Ion Implantation on Magnetic Properties of CoPd Multilayer Structures Possessing Perpendicular Anisotropy","doi":"10.1166/jno.2008.305","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1166/jno.2008.305","venue":""}

Muscat was the point of attachment of the coastal system to the Indian Ocean trade network. The coastal system spatial structure of trade was dendritic, i.e., tree-like, with a well-defined hierarchy of market centers. Trade flowed vertically between levels of the hierarchy. The interior economy was based on traditional agriculture and animal husbandry. Local trade patterns and market structures in the interior Imamate show a number of mini systems, rather than a single coherent system as on the coast. Modern development has seen the linkage of markets. On the coast, horizontal linkages filled in the dendritic structure, and in the interior, the mini systems were linked. There are now also many linkages between the two former systems, so that the market structure of Oman today forms a coherent whole.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Markets and the Development of Oman's Urban Network","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

This type of information is now becoming increasingly available for physiotherapists with expertise in Parkinson’s disease (PD). Our study aimed to explore the ability of people with Parkinson’s disease to recognise expertise, and to what extent respondents selectively choose such expert physiotherapists.MethodsWe used claim data from the period 2009–2010 to select customers with PD who claimed physiotherapy. A random sample of 500 eligible respondents received a paper-based survey. We used descriptive statistics to compare the respondent characteristics, a qualitative programme to analyse the qualitative items, and univariate and multivariate regression.ResultsMost respondents (89%) took their referring physician’s advice when selecting a physiotherapist, although this advice rarely was supported with arguments. The remaining respondents (11%) searched for comparative performance information about physiotherapists. Respondents who recognised the added value of PD expertise among physiotherapists were 3.28 times as likely to search for comparative performance information as those who did not understand. Respondents were willing to switch to an expert physiotherapist (68%), and this willingness increased if they recognised the value of PD expertise (p < .001).ConclusionThe participants were able to recognise certain aspects of expertise. Though they showed relatively few signs of selectively choice behaviour for expert physiotherapists. Both respondents and referring professionals need more understanding about the added value of an expert physiotherapist, to foster selective provider choice.","inCitations":["bed860a23ff9127baa589cdce35b5e1ae0010857","a2a3716cf0001e85c2a7b94de469b32ef0cfaced","992f298b2a74b86698baa0c3c98bf6ef2574d840"],"pdfUrls":["https://bmchealthservres.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/1472-6963-13-430?site=bmchealthservres.biomedcentral.com"],"title":"Recognition of physiotherapists’ expertise in Parkinson’s disease","doi":"10.1186/1472-6963-13-430","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1472-6963-13-430","venue":"BMC Health Services Research"}

Un caso especial de polimero supramolecular es el de los geles supramoleculares, donde el gelador autoensambla de forma ordenada en una dimension, produciendo estructuras supramoleculares fibrosas alargadas que forman redes tridimensionales capaces de ocluir moleculas de disolvente en su interior.En esta Tesis Doctoral se ha llevado a cabo la sintesis de un grupo de moleculas organicas capaces de autoensamblar en disolucion gracias a la participacion de diversas interacciones no covalentes como las interacciones ?-?, los enlaces de hidrogeno o las interacciones de van der Waals. A partir de esta habilidad, se ha determinado el mecanismo de polimerizacion supramolecular seguido por estos compuestos. Adicionalmente, la presencia de elementos quirales en estas moleculas ha posibilitado el estudio de la influencia de dichos elementos en el mecanismo del proceso de agregacion y, principalmente, en la transmision de la quiralidad desde el nivel molecular al supramolecular atendiendo a diferentes factores estructurales. Ademas, la formacion de polimeros supramoleculares unidimensionales ha permitido el estudio del proceso de gelificacion y su posible aplicacion en la cristalizacion de farmacos.Las diferencias estructurales de los compuestos descritos determinan la quiralidad presente en las moleculas y, como consecuencia, la transferencia de la quiralidad desde el nivel molecular al supramolecular. Tomando como referencia este criterio, esta Tesis Doctoral se ha dividido en dos partes atendiendo a la diferente geometria de las moleculas que se describen en cada una de ellas (Figura 22). En la primera parte, las moleculas que se plantean presentan una geometria radial, rectangular o triangular, mientras que en la segunda parte, las moleculas objeto de estudio corresponden a moleculas lineales.A partir de los resultados recogidos en esta Memoria, se concluye que pequenas diferencias estructurales que determinan la participacion de diferente numero de interacciones no covalentes o la eficacia de estas, y/o de distintos elementos de quiralidad molecular, ejercen una enorme influencia tanto en el transcurso del proceso de polimerizacion supramolecular (mecanismo) como en el resultado de dicho proceso (helicidad supramolecular), repercutiendo, finalmente, en su uso como material final (gel).","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Quiralidad en polímeros supramoleculares: efectos estructurales en el autoensamblaje helicoidal de moléculas orgánicas sencillas","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Their surgical resection is still challenging and several surgical approaches have been proposed.\n\n\nCASE DESCRIPTION\nWe present the case of a 59-year-old woman with a cavernous hemangioma of the orbital apex, which was diagnosed incidentally. The hemangioma was extraconal and involved mainly the medial orbital apex; it also extended to the pterygoid fossa, to the middle fossa, to the maxillary and sphenoid sinuses. The surgical resection was performed by a pure endoscopic transphenoidal, transmaxillary, transethmoidal approach, achieving a total removal. The patient had a transient and incomplete paresis of the VI cranial nerve on the left side and did not experience other postoperative complications.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe endoscopic endonasal approach proved successful in the management of this case and it should be considered in the surgical management of extraconal orbital apex lesions with medial or inferior extension.","inCitations":["4d4c25350721dad9125d485d3ba9e810756b14d8","007d952dc0b303ce85c16b62a271779f83fd875c","86c9e496ad6b91e41a2b91fe68f889004306d041","148b49fe3fdeea3ae48b4ee0cdd487403dbf165e","2bbccc187a25027980bd9e3410f6b2219fdc3f6b","baafde8c74f69bc60294b95a84795bfbc8faa23d","c0fbe1965a14f251c28408a02d76e2cb831d40fb","cb8792ebc4ae2b916c861a7a771036e9581142af","c897410fe63aa09e1f1218256cda3b6edd3321b9","51f106aa42baa514005b298b0ed7e7480cde8d77","cd3f1d9e496359cf93efbb1843bde5429a06e9a7"],"pdfUrls":["http://sni.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/3352/SNI-2-58.pdf"],"title":"Endoscopic endonasal removal of a cavernous hemangioma of the orbital apex","doi":"10.4103/2152-7806.80123","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.4103/2152-7806.80123","venue":"Surgical neurology international"}

Methods: The Scania 2000 public-health survey is a cross-sectional, postal questionnaire study including 13,604 persons aged 18—80 years which was conducted in 2000 by the regional healthcare authorities in Region Skåne, southern Sweden, to investigate health-related risk factors in the population. A logistic regression model was used to investigate the association between social capital and lack of belief in possibility to influence health. The multivariate analyses analysed the importance of confounders on the differences in lack of belief in possibility to influence health according to the social capital variables. Results: In total, 31.0% of all men and 33.5% of all women lack belief in the possibility to influence their own health. Lack of belief in possibility to influence health was positively associated with both low social participation and low trust, although stronger for social participation than for trust. Conclusions: Low levels of social capital, particularly low social participation, is positively associated with lack of belief in the possibility to influence one's own health.","inCitations":["106fa3052a7896b7dfc3e7c641fe6e5cbd28ddb0","dee84bf8c949adf920f16786a55f6e7cc82eb8f3","c9d82587957e1f00dbbf8fc8fd4e21cac16df939","ef12537b96b5c3ae6b37d391084da1ee2b8e36c9","5fb1e9950d095bfbb2e03674d72d6c174f322e5f","ba6d99fa793ae7269f3097eebd120f15f2fe0058","a53dd1552e20a9c100af69d462510b01921578d5","31bf9fc0857305d29e2fcad53f2c866e2e5c83d3","9809980c99f0d1f91a3f0a3c984735ac90bbbdb7","b55bcfc43705e2985bf5219334c52d16938c2a2b","96fb841c068c088385d77ac9dd6bd2d1a1b7d10c","b367b19a11a7fe8e3609c883af684cacf855bf16"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Social capital and lack of belief in the possibility to influence one's own health: A population-based study","doi":"10.1080/14034940510032167","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1080/14034940510032167","venue":"Scandinavian journal of public health"}

These new polymers exhibit high thermal and chemical stability and can be easily postfunctionalized under different reaction conditions, allowing the incorporation of acid, base or acid–base groups (TxPPs-SO3H, TxPPs-NH2 and TxPPs-SO3H–NH2) in the polymeric networks, yet displaying a significant porosity. The potential applications of the new truxene-based polymers as heterogeneous catalysts are also presented. The intrinsic photocatalytic activity of the truxene network which takes advantage of the semiconducting character of the constituent units is investigated in the aerobic oxidative self-coupling of benzylamine under visible light.

Multiple linear regression analyses tested associations between psychosocial variables and self-reported short- and long-term PA outcomes. Regression analyses showed that control constructs of both theories were significant determinants of short- and long-term MVPA, whereas affective and self-determination variables were strong predictors of short- and long-term lifestyle PA. Regarding short-term prediction models, TPB constructs were stronger in predicting MVPA, whereas SDT was more effective in predicting lifestyle PA. For long-term models, both forms of PA were better predicted by SDT in comparison to TPB. These results highlight the importance of comparing health behavior theories to identify the mechanisms involved in the behavior change process. Control and competence constructs are crucial during early adoption of structured PA behaviors, whereas affective and intrinsic sources of motivation are more involved in incidental types of PA, particularly in relation to behavioral maintenance.","inCitations":["1ff42e77f938cab57f0ddde789bad5ddca2cf07f","5a9c3b44f887cf328c1811608b26ce4420f8a63d","d97ccfa97374e362930a0f19524e1b485385eff3","12e3da2ad6b088d0b71e5ccc01faf30bd03303ed"],"pdfUrls":["https://watermark.silverchair.com/cyu060.pdf?token=AQECAHi208BE49Ooan9kkhW_Ercy7Dm3ZL_9Cf3qfKAc485ysgAAAjswggI3BgkqhkiG9w0BBwagggIoMIICJAIBADCCAh0GCSqGSIb3DQEHATAeBglghkgBZQMEAS4wEQQMeGwALxspcTyNt4QAAgEQgIIB7ueC93tHfYGsBtQGpb13jTFn1psBZKM-XTAJlhn0E-LaMaIEJahx6klml7FpDvwSkEFbwiGqqeffnxfF46X1rL52wJt9PKdhgL21OAc_8VYrAULrJllMX9qdUWLPtY0ZB64C1ikBEwwaUIDCDHQAjUUzkDeGsy4__rVHrQyIVbTtVHtEHFgaDI9CNj5F5_iX3xRYwapDNTwOdVDgF_EyTzIUtv5DqQXlmhBYEV37OFZ4OQCHV0C0_WUaAfbgZClVd7E9KhsThiXU_SmzcS56yt_IIMkPLgyBoBd-XSPbYJ5QbDsvi3pelG31vXFuVLdTIssxSBNdhClPjQNiCt5XM6iuz2J7ZMIajuWGoHOZ3CMgVgFYOFhcAsV634DWk9zmQ1dUmeKF6M-OVtoQJV4ZMj8urutMT_ZVmN8U9VYWmDcyP4OunmW6E3bct49JW1QcwE33LvDxHyc2Hf3LAygwQsD9pDvk_68SWMXiwEcmuv_wzox5I-Obbt-6XfPo_jDQKc0SWPxO9indJ5zvc9snmojDflWdDQfj-AABDNwiZUJ60rcSDqqC3p4V09xZvUveAdK6hgLBe-2z4wXwsVUkbRy2GdtFVTIYjASXhwYvA9km4LNk_-13y83-kpxBsy4jUnKcHdC2GWFtQ6Gxepo7","http://selfdeterminationtheory.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/2014_WasserkampSilvaSantos.pdf","https://oup.silverchair-cdn.com/oup/backfile/Content_public/Journal/her/29/6/10.1093_her_cyu060/2/cyu060.pdf?Expires=1491975642&Key-Pair-Id=APKAIUCZBIA4LVPAVW3Q&Signature=Vw8kfu2ZMCqQk5hwfDHNdSLflrK~CbN-fpxUM1LPQ0Wtx1ndomj6HroDtcAgrArZUYKS4TkqOTuFCdLfGDT2YhR0-BgT0jn2YetxVaKN-quV4wX8BIjFsa-ISo9kwzURehiIzpcdxmSmmjDDl15uteGnnkE~HQM9BQENtg6Zp1qvHmp5RSGiKpnqWhm-nuNgLJZZhNwGaGNNRKoEOVeRdxeZd8z~QzR3nKo7z3QaJUS0oyWBv7gosuK2XepmCN9z4FJoS2~JIBMC9yyNO5L~MoAEpxui2G5jSixdrtoltEi6Bhv4fAZ6q0pxbZ2JlhUZ1tpbt6FeK3-cjgaCClsaJA__"],"title":"Short- and long-term theory-based predictors of physical activity in women who participated in a weight-management program.","doi":"10.1093/her/cyu060","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1093/her%2Fcyu060","venue":"Health education research"}

В полевых условиях исследовано влияние ограничений полива на накопление масла и белка в семенах двух сортов сои (Zane и Hack). Для экспериментальных и контрольных участков двух культурных сортов сои были установлены режимы полива I1, I2, I3 и I4, которые определяли на основании общего испарения из лотка 60±3, 80±3, 100±3 и 120±3 мм соответственно (класс А). Стадии созревания семян сравнивались как отдельные выборки. Результаты показали, что доли масла и белка в семенах разных урожаев значимо не зависели от режима полива. Однако выход как масла, так и белка на единицу площади значимо сокращался при увеличении дефицита воды. Кроме того, при увеличении среднего веса 100 семян содержание масла снижалось, а белка – увеличивалась. Предполагается, что выход масла и белка сои на единицу площади в условиях как достаточного, так и ограниченного полива можно улучшить повышением урожайности путём селекции семян высокоурожайных сортов. Ключевые слова: Glycine max, накопление, масло, белок, урожай семян, дефицит воды.","inCitations":["c9aee24a903012978bcaa51fd10a399be2054f0b"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.sevin.ru/volecomag/issues/2011_3/PEJ_2011_3_247-255.pdf"],"title":"Oil and Protein Responseof Soybean (glycine Max L.)

Techniques for obtaining cell cultures requires a complex and laborious task that starts from live tissue sampling, continuous with isolation of cells and their preparation for sowing a culture plate. This preparation involves mechanical and enzymatic action from the researcher on biological material. Derived cell cultures are monitored morphologically by high-performance inverted biological microscope, with video camera for image acquisition. In the final stage, the cells are scraped, and through biochemical and molecular techniques, the therapeutic efficiency hypothesis of the investigated natural factor is verified experimentally. The cell cultures can be crioconservated in special containers with liquid nitrogen. 1 Corresponding author: Constantin Munteanu, tel./fax: +40213186458, e-mail: constantin2378@yahoo.com, Mailing address: B-dul Ion Mihalache, nr.11A, District 1, cod 79173, Bucharest, Romania, http://www.cell-culture.xhost.ro/","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://www.bioclima.ro/J13.pdf"],"title":"Experimental Methodology used by Cell Cultures Laboratory from National Institute of Rehabilitation, Physical Medicine and Balneoclimatology, Bucharest, Romania to assess the therapeutic effect of natural factors","doi":"10.12680/balneo.2010.1001","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.12680/balneo.2010.1001","venue":""}

This experiment used roots and stems of cassava, fermented juice of epiphytic lactic acid bacteria (FJLB) and molasses. A completely randomized design was used in this experiment for 8 treatments. The treatments were 30oC incubator, 50oC incubator, 70oC oven drying, freeze drying, 2 d incubator 30oC ensiling, 2 d incubator 50oC ensiling, 2 w incubator 30oC ensiling and 2 w incubator 50oC ensiling. The contents of HCN, acetone cyanohydrin, linamarin, proximate components and in vitro dry matter digestibility were determined in each treatment. The result of this experiment showed that the contents of HCN and linamarin in ensiled cassava roots were lower (p<0.01) than in dried cassava roots. There were no significantly different on residual HCN among treatments in cassava stems. The content of linamarin was higher in freeze drying than that in heat drying methods (p<0.05). There was an opposite pattern of acetone cyanohydrins and linamarin content of roots and stems. The content of dry matter (DM) in 30oC ensiling was lower than in 50oC ensiling (p<0.05). The content of ash increased in cassava roots silage (p<0.01), meanwhile the decreasing of ether extract content was occured in cassava stem silage (p<0.01). Ensiling method was more effective to reduce cyanide than the drying method, and cassava silage showed a proper qualification as feed.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://www.jppt.undip.ac.id/pdf/33(4)2008p247-254.pdf"],"title":"Chemical Components of Cassava Roots and Stems","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

One of the major causes of lipid rancidity is endogenous esterases and lipases. This study evaluated 66 European wheat varieties grown at a single site over three years (2014, 2015 and 2016).\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe 66 wheat varieties showed up to 3-fold variance on esterase and lipase activities. Wheat varieties that are suitable for lipid stable whole grain products ('Julius', 'Lona' and 'Banquet') were selected according to their consistently low esterase and lipase activities. The 3-year mean based broad-sense heritability of esterase and lipase was 0.75 and 0.44, respectively.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe findings indicate great genetic dependence of both esterase and lipase activities in wheat. The moderate to high heritability brings a new prospect of breeding selection of low-lipase-activity wheat for stable whole grain products. This result will improve the use of wheat as raw material, benefit cultivation selection, and provide consumers with better quality products. This article is protected by copyright.

Este periodo se corresponde con el nucleo de lo que los historiadores han llamado «era de las revoluciones» y las corrientes dominantes en historia del nacionalismo han identificado como el momento de transicion de una idea de nacion «premoderna» a otra «moderna», identificada con el principio de soberania nacional. Las fuentes son un corpus diverso compuesto de ciento setenta diarios, memorias y libros de viaje elaborados durante el periodo senalado. El trabajo desarrolla una metodologia de analisis de la nacionalizacion de la experiencia vital y de los marcos cognitivos desde los cuales se narra. Se realizan cuatro estudios de caso y se los compara. En todos ellos se abordan los significados de la palabra «nacion» y sus terminos asociados antes de la revolucion liberal, su utilizacion en los contextos, primero, de las guerras revolucionarias y napoleonicas, y despues, de enfrentamiento entre los variados partidarios del cambio y sus enemigos. Tambien se aborda la relacion entre las diferencias territoriales y los conflictos politicos y culturales dentro de una misma nacion. Como parte de esto, se incluyen los procesos de secesion acontecidos dentro de monarquias transatlanticas en fallido de proceso de transformacion en naciones imperiales. Los resultados arrojan un panorama conceptual complejo que cuestiona el modelo dual de transicion basado en la idea de soberania nacional. En su lugar, se propone una alternativa formada por los conceptos genetico, etnotipico no politizado, etnotipico politizado, liberal y romantico. Ademas, se demuestra una frecuente presencia de la nacion que afecta tambien a sujetos de clases medias y bajas letradas. Esta presencia se ve tensionada por los multiples conflictos politicos propios de la era de las revoluciones, que dividen sus significados y contribuyen a profundizar los enfrentamientos. Simultaneamente, sin embargo, demuestran ser un factor diferenciador respecto al periodo anterior y decisivo para su expansion social y ganancia de protagonismo politico.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Nación vivida, nación narrada: una historia de lo nacional en el reino unido, francia, españa y portugal, c. 1780-1840","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

The possibility of such knowledge has been called into question by contemporary critics of Molinism. The problem is that without middle knowledge, the Molinist account of Providence and the free will theodicy is impossible.

There are many issues behind the implementation of such a system: these are covered in detail, and a software simulation is introduced to illustrate them. Two separate design stages are discussed. The creation of an HRTF database from an extant set of impulse responses is vital to the successful processing of audio through the system; the nature of this processing is also important. Two of the main problems with existing binaural systems are eliminated: front/back confusion is avoided by tracking the listener’s head movements, and in-head localisation is prevented by incorporating early reflections from a simple listening room model into the simulation. The commercial viability of this loudspeaker auralisation system is discussed: it would almost certainly be necessary to improve the simulation by using a faster processor, but a product incorporating this technology would be particularly useful for the film sound and mobile recording sectors of the audio industry.

However, it cannot give good estimation of the states in highly nonlinear system or with non-Gaussian initial conditional density functions. Moreover, while the local methods only approximate the mean and variance, the global ones seek the way to directly obtain the conditional density function of the states. Consequently, all the statistical information is acquired. In this survey, we shall briefly go through the local approaches and put emphases on the existing three major global approaches: finite-dimensional NLF, sequential Monte Carlo methods (particle filter) and the Yau-Yau’s onand off-line solver of Duncan-Mortensen-Zakai’s equation [75].

They have a high rate of reproduction, are cosmopolitan and have the ability to adapt to a wide variety of habitats. Several studies were carried out on myomorphic rodents in the Kisangani ecoregion, while those on sciuromorphic rodents are very scarce. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine the composition of the sciuromorph rodent population in the Kisangani ecoregion. This investigation was conducted in five stations of Kisangani and the sampling was performed between April 2014 and December 2016. The external morphometry method was used for species identification according to Kingdon and Schouteden. Using traditional traps, the trapping was done randomly and 75 specimens of squirrels were captured knowing that 75 traps were installed in each station. In total, the capture success was of 27750 night traps with a weak yield of 0.27%. The findings revealed that the highest rate of species was recorded in the Masako station with a capture success of 1.89% while the lowest in the Mombongo station with a capture success of 0.38%. The 75 specimens of squirrels captured belong to 4 genera and 7 species Masako and Yasikia stations presented a high specific richness (SR = 4) than other stations. Funisciurus anerythrus, Heliosciurus rufobrachium, Paraxerus boehmi are constant (C> 50%) and Funisciurus pyrropus, Protoxerus stangeri, Funisciurus bayonii, Funisciurus congicus are accessory taxa (25% F. bayonii and F. congicus .","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Preliminary Inventory of Squirrels (Sciuridae, Rodentia) of Kisangani Region in the Democratic Republic of the Congo","doi":"10.11648/j.ajz.20180101.13","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.11648/j.ajz.20180101.13","venue":""}

However, the mechanism of AGP-induced cancer cell death is unknown. In this study, AGP is shown to up-regulate intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and induce apoptosis in melanoma but not normal melanocyte cells. By screening genes involved in apoptosis, we identify tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-family members as the most differentially expressed cellular genes upon AGP treatment of melanoma cells. TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1) antagonist-neutralizing antibody specifically inhibits AGP-induced apoptosis signal, regulating apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) activity and subsequent ASK1-dependent apoptosis. Treatment of cells with intracellular ROS scavenger N-acetyl-l-cysteine also inhibits AGP-induced activation of ASK1, as well as apoptosis. Moreover, depletion of intracellular ASK1 reduces the level of AGP-induced oxidative stress and apoptosis. The evidence for TNF-signaling dependence of ASK1-mediated apoptosis suggests possible mechanisms for AGP activation and regulation of apoptosis-signaling pathways in tumor cells.","inCitations":["4fd23d017679a00f7069ba5bce80d6fae51f4e51","419854158f0c98b5e3a28d773dd04457fd45158c","696eb0c1b63471bf3b16e1531b5e1e4bb92242a0","d222848175da121007af99dedcb8eb04e5c0d2bd","8217287979a2ac8d2558215676dc68c623ab3e93","4c7dda2c141bbd0fda76c386b1f3f8a1a4add59a","0ab698963792ef6583ad18dc09f3ebe066e72b6b","b2f1f682f9d038acbe3bd5bb19b8d70326efac4f","3c4402aefdccc5ede9c03ecf13978857416a1f17","bec4794c4844ed7456181badbe69ef4cca8512f6","a0f35db0f774eff8c325a1398bc3f6ddcca64d56","06b9b78157e60b31114de835fd1bf644935d5ff1","247f1239b984d564dac738f40e2da69a256451a4","5861dc56bd513ad25f737f533177b09ad25c7cd4","25f4c04fb02c4883aa16db5523536943f63fce03","4c73b34d961cd79475ac9b9d18940132bf8b7a8c","f5cecb478e47fce625e71d191e95e491f2b0f2b0","2275678027fc3b4e74a06433e811b4a1b3f96690","f501d687c9574222e6fd231bc81ec164a4808579","2e1ab0324b70f8624716310d4501a1e7a4ad09a1","82ab81ac9a6b6319b8f6547c4dd55bb90ecba047","2a032cff6b3239fe0fc2eab9e5148f67711d4b95","37b775f71e87b58636c433252df3f554231aaedb","d36e761d847f3360d82c0a866d555a15a847a862","6f1575589b659b57398cc8ff7931ce55ce03100c","e21849769f10c64af8ed65cad36aa4bdd1c93394","27238b23e7fa44c5e400e70c1ed90977a25fd2db","402af3491057f1763bc9829b6fe6ac39359abc96","a5ccd770eb3fc65ee34e9654cea2ff6477abb713","e99195070dc07a939111fb7302389b7eceb359eb","13c5415e84408d1cb6fe13f78c977d7b9bd5dde3","adb73f236b3f379fe4190093aeaf6ab335fb7094","5edee08ed33ee00533b698f23a9ccb971aa06039","436b1f7489bc7772f735dabbea0b1c870e63590b","8de1d87124fea0adbcb41f7084c0e77b0fe2830f","9ada398dede74f150740a612df777bf1eaf4a569","43a3030bf0b85690df0c074b82b6fbebfa672469","13baa3c84d142b5351f6844fef78627f7ee30af6","00990f044a02bd510700f709aa533c16e593bc2d","1ab03106400b8d6ae13c741c0a276a7b1445333f","e247b08bc1065820c83e30502961e323590df7b8","7845cadcd6c17b31a085fbabcbcbf4d70ea6b1d3","0bf3436383988fb3d2593b9dfaa584f1f61db23d","2078347677d1ce76ff24dff52f75d21d8ecf2f43","bf8eecfd0bb6517964318addd2316427411d9929","e8e0c5e5c8b1717617072e4b71b709de6d8bf340","89b54d164199423b9d7e772a7698095ddabe1d39","67669a3d72a9e259e16e16784d4799eb4b9fc886","70a2239e247d82323b3d4b7b9b0b47ca32eff98f","0d7e29c8f059f969d8656a14043653710e232118","e749f6b430f3fa421b5bb1c3f00f618c40070cf8","a307317aaae97f17f80f12c2662af7cea226859b","09ed082b107bd3d0ab58150fcbfb421cfc8fd97a","6538e0ab4fdfb77c642e17e2c3100ff3d37ba407","c2762df3cb9f12ebe639d63dbef70d38b1d43107","abfe0161c374de1b9519a7d83c9ee18ee666d16a","cfbf8bdd9a34f455432ad7aabe6d529f83a0db6f","50b746d8cc787dc1c9d2cfaeaa8c76f57fc07412","f449519a2b627aaee682df0ba9be7c1277195c26","9e33fe5aacac1ad4821ace0dd988b287be864b38","fbf8badc1526927c2ccc49c91c656c2109f81143","c40830444bd889c7c815877b35343da6e04d2b5b","2b819edb0ae14afd905fb56bfcc08beefa866da8"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Atmospheric gas plasma–induced ROS production activates TNF-ASK1 pathway for the induction of melanoma cancer cell apoptosis","doi":"10.1091/mbc.E13-10-0590","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1091/mbc.E13-10-0590","venue":"Molecular biology of the cell"}

O aleitamento materno e necessario para a garantia da saude e do desenvolvimento adequado das criancas e e considerado o melhor alimento para o lactente, fornecendo protecao contra doencas agudas e cronicas, alem de contribuir para o desenvolvimento psicologico e emocional do recem-nascido. O Ministerio da Saude recomenda o aleitamento materno exclusivo ate o sexto mes e continuado ate o segundo ano de vida. A garantia do aleitamento materno exclusivo e influenciada, entre outros fatores, pela percepcao materna sobre o ato de amamentar e suas dificuldades, e a introducao de liquidos nao nutritivos e uso de chupeta. Orientacoes no pre-natal, condutas hospitalares e suporte pos-parto, acabam por determinar a duracao do aleitamento materno. Com base nas variaveis que podem afetar a pratica do aleitamento materno e consequentemente o desenvolvimento infantil, este projeto teve como objetivo a fundamentacao de acoes de promocao do aleitamento materno em uma Unidade de Saude do municipio de Canoas, RS. Foram realizadas acoes de orientacao e capacitacao das equipes de estrategia de saude da familia e demais parceiros da rede, sendo desempenhadas praticas de assistencia compartilhada e retaguarda especializada para o manejo clinico da amamentacao na atencao basica.  O projeto teve inicio no mes de abril e ate o momento ja assistiu 58 puerperas, essas orientacoes ocorreram atraves de visitas domiciliares e durante a realizacao do teste do pezinho na unidade de saude, os atendimentos foram compartilhados entre a equipe de estrategia de saude da familia, NASF e residentes. Semanalmente foram realizadas interconsultas de pre-natal, puerperio e puericultura e acoes de educacao em saude na sala de espera da unidade. As orientacoes fornecidas envolvem principalmente: posicionamento e pega adequadas durante a amamentacao, manejo de fissuras e ingurgitamento mamario, tecnica de ordenha mamaria e idade ideal para introducao de alimentacao complementar. Observou-se que grande parte das puerperas apresentou alguma duvida ou dificuldade em relacao ao manejo da amamentacao, e que diversas delas ja haviam ofertado em algum momento complemento alimentar aos seus bebes. Alem disso, nos primeiros cinco dias pos-parto diversas maes ja apresentaram agravos como fissuras e ingurgitamento mamario. Sendo assim, evidencia-se a importância das orientacoes quanto ao manejo da amamentacao nos primeiros dias de vida do bebe, e a manutencao do acompanhamento dos mesmos, a fim de promover o aleitamento materno exclusivo ate pelo menos os seis meses de vida da crianca.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Promoção Ao Aleitamento Materno Na Atenção Básica: Projeto Mama Nenê – Relato De Experiência","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Antiepileptic drug (AED)-associated ADRs, demographic and clinical characteristics, AED regimen, and so on were recorded. Causality, severity, and preventability were performed by World Health Organization-Uppsala Monitoring Center scale, Hartwig's severity scale, and Schumock and Thornton questionnaire, respectively.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOf the enrolled population, 53% children had symptomatic epilepsy, and 51% were in 5- to 10-year age group. More than two-thirds of children were on monotherapy, with phenytoin (n = 176, 63.5%) being the most common AED. Three hundred fifty-three AED-related ADRs were recorded in 175 children (63.2%). Poor scholastic performance (19%) was the most common ADR, followed by gum hypertrophy (13.3%), headache (10.2%), behavioral problems (5.7%), drowsiness (5.7%), and others. Two hundred sixteen ADRs were probable, and 126 ADRs were possible. Severe ADRs were noted in 6 children. Girls (odds ratio [OR], 1.93; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.07-3.45; P = 0.03), children with secondary epilepsy (OR, 3.31; 95% CI, 1.76-6.23; P ≤ 0.001), children older than 5 years (5-10 years; OR, 6.28; 95% CI, 2.79-14.12; P ≤ 0.001), and those older than 10 years (OR, 9.04; 95% CI, 3.69-22.17; P ≤ 0.001) were found to be at higher risk of experiencing ADRs.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nMonotherapy was the preferred treatment. Phenytoin was the most common ADR causative agent. Female sex, symptomatic epilepsy, and older age (> 5 years) were found to be associated with higher probability of ADR development.","inCitations":["8ea2be82e7d2d774be164bb97ef981343c9f51e4","f48193dcdbc0c94416803ce5c2a7fa5526d5d64b","15d69e3e1f557384d1c71ebea007a9e4aa689688","1605376accacdc063a31b4549b1545063502bfcb","b628a0c7a0a51748eaa1ebe8bb6c9413c290b888","16d81cfc1cf4885cfc30473146e99b2f641fefed","998c3e04cefdcad5684dd6a4effe73a33d7f7826"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Adverse effects of antiepileptic drugs in North Indian pediatric outpatients.","doi":"10.1097/WNF.0b013e31829a498d","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1097/WNF.0b013e31829a498d","venue":"Clinical neuropharmacology"}

Stating that they enable ‘participation’ is, however, not enough to understand what is at stake in a given context. It is necessary to describe exactly the kind of participation taking place. Despite development projects inceptors’ intentions, the way people use ICT (information and communication technologies) objects sometimes leads to a rerouting of their political meaning. This article deciphers these sideway uses and what they imply in the Ugandan context. Based on the example of ‘serial callers' (people who intensively call in during radio talk shows), it demonstrates that ICT objects become the site of the elaboration of particular ways of conceiving one's roles, status and duties in the polity, as an ‘educator’ or a ‘representative’, blurring established distinctions between political representation and participation, and offers a nuanced picture of the complexities of patronage politics.","inCitations":["db809d61c0baa7040aba1ac76d34079da7adec05","14812dcb43e584e6dc886b58f7571f71e15cf5f1","815720044bd46c34977c4eb17f0323dabbe91d45"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Serial Callers: Communication Technologies and Political Personhood in Contemporary Uganda","doi":"10.1080/00141844.2015.1127984","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1080/00141844.2015.1127984","venue":""}

To generate ideas that overcome obstacles defined for the implementation of smart metering and that are responsive to socio-cultural aspects influencing acceptance, similar open innovation sessions were arranged in three European countries: Switzerland, the Netherlands and Spain. Furthermore, on a methodological level, the suitability of the sessions for the Living Lab project has been evaluated. Results show that the innovations resulting from the three sessions departed from a common view to engage people in their energy uptake: developing attractive, tangible devices or services, which should be further specified for various groups of people within society requiring different approaches in terms of physical appearance, but also through different ways of social networking. The methods applied in the sessions provided to be a useful method for gathering opinions and actively involving experts and companies in a short period of time, but there were difficulties in both preparation and follow up of the similar sessions.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Open Innovation Applied to Smart Metering: a Case-Study into Socio- Cultural Aspects","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Crystals accumulate in the synovial membranes with or without calcification in articular hyaline and/or fibrocartilage, joint capsules, bursae, and tendon sheaths. Almost any joint may be involved by , although the knees, wrists, and hips are most often affected. crystals have a rhomboid shape in which adjacent sides are of unequal lengths and angles are not at 90 degrees. crystals may be identified by polarization optical methods as positively birefringent small ( Objectives The of this study was to demonstrate the advantages of examining unstained histologic sections under polarized light in comparison with haematoxylin-eosin stained ones. Methods At the National Institute of Rheumatology and at the Hospital of the Order of the Brothers of Saint John of God surgical specimens were examined histologically between 1985 and 2010, among them 10 (0.01%) with chondrocalcinosis and deposits. Seventeen tissue samples of 10 patients with deposits were studied in serial sections stained with haematoxylin-eosin and in unstained sections viewed under polarized light. Results In formaldehyde fixed and haematoxylin-eosin stained sections, viewed under polarized light, CPPD crystals were detected in of 10 patients (60.0%), whereas in unstained sections crystals were present in 9 of them (90.0%). CPPD crystals were demonstrable in 75.0% of formalin fixed tissue specimens (in 3 of 4 patients) which were considered negative with haematoxylin-eosin stain. Conclusions The simplest and most effective technique to demonstrate crystals is “not-staining” (1). Textbooks of histologic methods and histochemistry do not mention this simple technique (2-5). It appears that in case of clinically or histologically suspected metabolic or crystal induced diseases it is adventageous to examine tissue sections stained with haematoxylin-eosin as well as in unstained sections. The probability of identifying crystals is much higher in unstained sections viewed under polarized light than in haematoxylin-eosin stained ones. This approach may also be useful in other crystal deposition induced diseases. References Bely M, Apathy Ά: Monckeberg9s sclerosis: crystal-induced angiopathy).

Two open-label studies suggested abatacept (ABA) may have a beneficial effect on disease activity and had an acceptable safety profile in pSS.1,2 Objectives To examine the efficacy and safety of ABA vs placebo (PBO) in patients (pts) with moderate-to-severe pSS. Methods In this Phase III, double-blind, PBO-controlled study (NCT02915159), adult pts meeting the 2016 ACR-EULAR criteria for pSS with EULAR Sjogren’s Syndrome Disease Activity Index (ESSDAI) ≥5 were randomised to receive ABA 125 mg SC weekly or PBO for 168 days (24 weeks), followed by a 197-day (365-day in Japan) open-label period of ABA treatment. All pts had a 168-day post-treatment follow-up period. Randomisation was stratified by corticosteroid (CS) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) use, enrolment in Japan (yes/no) and stimulated whole salivary flow (SWSF; Results A total of 187 (ABA, 92; PBO, 95) pts were randomised and received ≥1 dose of study drug. Baseline characteristics were comparable between treatment groups: mean (SD) age was 52 (12.9) years, 95% of pts were female, 64% were white, 40% were receiving concomitant stable-dose HCQ and 25% oral CS (≤10 mg/day prednisone equivalent). Mean (SD) baseline ESSDAI score was 9.4 (4.3) (ABA, 8.7 [3.4] vs PBO, 10.1 [5.0]). At Day 169, no significant differences were seen between ABA- and PBO-treated pts for the primary or key secondary efficacy outcomes (Table 1). Applying the Benjamini–Hochberg method (with a false discovery rate of 5%) at Day 169, significant treatment differences were observed for 5/12 biomarkers (post hoc analysis) (Table 1). Serious AEs related to the study drug occurred in 3% of ABA- and 1% of PBO-treated pts. Related AEs occurred in 46% and 25% of ABA- and PBO-treated pts, respectively, but this was not enriched for any specific event and there were no new ABA safety signals. Conclusion Despite favourably impacting biomarkers of disease activity, abatacept therapy was no better than PBO for improving the clinical measures of disease. These results do not indicate a clinical benefit of abatacept in pSS. References [1] Meiners PM, et al. Ann Rheum Dis2014;73:1393–6. [2] Adler S, et al. Arthritis Care Res (Hoboken)2013;65:1862–8.

En dat terwijl veel mensen met een chronische ziekte kampen met depressie, angst of onzekerheid. Als we volledige zorg willen bieden aan chronisch zieke patiënten in de huisartsenpraktijk, kunnen we er niet omheen om aandacht te besteden aan deze problemen.In dit onderzoek voerden verpleegkundigen een minimale psychologische interventie (MPI) uit, gebaseerd op cognitieve gedragstherapie en zelfmanagement. Bij deze aanpak leren patiënten om zelf problemen te definiëren en zij leren te onderzoeken wat zij er zelf aan kunnen doen. Het onderzoeksresultaat was dat de patiënten betere zelfmanagers werden en minder depressieve symptomen hadden. Daarnaast was de rol van de verpleegkundige belangrijk. Deze is minder verzorgend en meer gericht op ondersteuning.Dit onderzoek richtte zich op oudere patiënten, omdat depressieve symptomen in combinatie met chronische ziekten vaak voorkomen bij ouderen. Juist bij deze groep onderkent men depressieve symptomen lang niet altijd omdat men ze ziet als natuurlijk gevolg van het ouder worden.Als huisartsenpraktijken deze aanpak verder gaan implementeren, kunnen praktijkondersteuners in plaats van verpleegkundigen de MPI gaan uitvoeren, ingebed in de reguliere zorg die chronisch zieken in de huisartsenpraktijk ontvangen. Binnenkort start in oostelijk Zuid-Limburg een proef waarbij de praktijkondersteuner signaleert welke chronisch zieke patiënten in aanmerking komen voor de nieuwe aanpak en waarbij zij deze patiënten vervolgens behandelt.","inCitations":["476a3773fc8a3a27946a050378dc59a731cab031"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Emotionele zorg chronisch zieken hoort in eerste lijn","doi":"10.1007/s12503-010-0061-3","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s12503-010-0061-3","venue":""}

This book contains the report of his experiences and analyses. Burton defines ideology as \"those representations of the objective structure of a society that dominate the consciousness of a class or social division\" (p. 1). He distinguishes between the total and the partial ideology, the former being the dominant categories of the Roman Catholic population, and the latter being the active program of a political movement, in this case the IRA. Burton starts his analysis with a description of the Roman Catholic community, which he sees characterized by a strong sense of social solidarity. This solidarity is greatly promoted by the dichotomy between those whom he lumps as \"Protestants\" and the Roman Catholics. He seems to disclaim any particular urban model since, as he tells us, \"Belfast, though an industrial city, remains a cluster of Protestant and Catholic urban villages, precisely because pockets of Protestants and pockets of Catholics stand in opposition to one another\" (p. 3). He does not, however, tell us what, if any, significance or structural uniqueness \"an urban village\" has in relation to, say, an isolated village. The community within Belfast upon which Burton concentrates is Anro, a section whose political significance lies in its ability to withstand and absorb external assaults. The solidary of Anro is partially both an effect and a cause of the division that exists between Protestants and Roman Catholics.

Fillers have been used in order to improve, among the others, mechanical, rheological, electrical, magnetic and thermal properties of the host material. Changes in the shape and size of the filler particles are known to affect and, in some cases, magnify such enhancement. This effect is usually associated with an increased probability of formation of a percolating cluster of filler particles in the matrix. Previous model calculations of percolation in polymeric systems generally did not take the possible difference between the size and shape of monomers and filler particles into account and usually neglected interactions or accounted for them in a crude fashion. In our approach the original lattice is replaced by a recursive structure on which calculations are done exactly and interactions as well as size and shape disparities can be easily taken into account. Here we introduce the recursive approach, we describe how to derive the percolation threshold as a function of the various parameters of the problem and we apply the new approach to the analysis of the effect of correlations among monodisperse particles on the percolation threshold of a system. Then in the second paper of the series we tackle the issue of the effect of size and shape disparities of the particles on their percolation properties while in the last part we describe the effect of the presence of a polymer matrix.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://arxiv.org/pdf/cond-mat/0603215v5.pdf"],"title":"Percolation of particles on recursive lattices: (I) a new theoretical approach","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

In this study, STBM were prepared by three different in vitro methods (mechanical dissection, villous explant culture, and placental perfusion) and their functional properties were tested on T lymphocytes enriched from peripheral blood samples. Mechanically- and villous explant-derived STBM significantly inhibited activation, proliferation and cytokine release by T lymphocytes, while placental perfusion-derived STBM significantly induced T cell proliferation and a slight increase in IFNgamma release. None of the STBM preparations caused T cell apoptosis. Therefore, STBM prepared by different methods in vitro exhibit different effects on circulating T cells, a feature that will have to be taken into account when considering their potential role in normal pregnancy and pre-eclampsia.","inCitations":["6c720cd44e8a156b77bf9769f63ba81c739b88e0","2fced758a9f51a5d80e164200e0e4898ae7a1f31","329bc304adc1c234dedf77abcdf1a490cccb1a63","901685ee07b5a98ccbfa07f57f42b06d4baed2a4","5e4daaae07ef5f310009b7061257998d50869aed","ce7dc361b36e6d0a5d05f4288bb0aaec4e0387d4","559b6213eb3c905516395c190ed4036a878be4ec","d59438ca93779a1f6e3421c0113870291303fc97","1b9eb82d53025937f68279f5b1812027b526074a","571244df9eb38573f1246187f95b87734fd21fdd","4eb77c1f0192407bdc5350f51db150e8341b51a3","64842c4c7a39500b0a9a336aeb599c9df6f8944a","04f7bf3c55a6d39a761906480baa7a69f5be9ce1","3b869636ec0447c0a16f6a35c5c8e84671e09511","a67ca4a69a382f12f5b7dad23b58e12da7747baf","50a4906373bc0add191cce5ba9a833cd2518604c","c055dafe57d8fc612c977d6d07e32c980c85f4af","3afae5369fed24d58b2872a798c7663a0b90696e","86487350a50ad4b2c8dacbdad8b40715cd2e6324","5292c26fcebe191c5a3e9fc5dba4d3032dc10b91","97e3fd003924e3423314f500df12eb1c8dc392c5","e384dc967c29e8f23c63c29f17520c2ae3476c24","c76c292b3ad602164451cc45e3f56ef3e8bd1b29"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Syncytiotrophoblast micro-particles do not induce apoptosis in peripheral T lymphocytes, but differ in their activity depending on the mode of preparation.","doi":"10.1016/j.jri.2005.05.003","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jri.2005.05.003","venue":"Journal of reproductive immunology"}

The PLMA is a modified laryngeal mask airway with large ventral cuff, dorsal cuff and a drain tube. These modifications improve seal around glottis and enable better ventilatory characteristics. The drain tube prevents gastric distension and offers protection against aspiration. There were occasional problems, like failed insertion and inadequate ventilation, in placing PLMA using the classical digital technique. To overcome these problems, newer placement techniques like thumb insertion technique, introducer tool placement and gum elastic bougie (GEB)-aided placement were devised. We compared classical digital placement of PLMA with gum elastic bougie-aided technique in 60 anaesthetised adult patients (with 30 patients in each group) with respect to number of attempts to successful placement, effective airway time, airway trauma during insertion, postoperative airway morbidity and haemodynamic response to insertion. The number of attempts to successful placement, airway trauma during insertion and haemodynamic response to insertion were comparable among the two groups, while effective airway time and oropharyngeal leak pressure were significantly higher in bougie- guided insertion of PLMA. Postoperatively, sore throat was more frequent with digital technique while dysphagia was more frequent with bougie guided technique. Hence gum elastic bougie guided, laryngoscope aided insertion of PLMA is an excellent alternate to classical digital technique.","inCitations":["c856ed9be57bc07bba3c8dfb70871bde863a84ff","86ad163920e603179b19c3f7616385159eb6b5bb","5ffd654d538487dcab5bcd7c113c4c29d0e17379","d81564a4a093ec5f753a53d639a21f228ff60f78","15cb14ade9e5a626ecb85d4b25a1be08ed217fce","0bd08b610050d2619918cb14b93ededcceea1ebd","d82c2882af03c4b523b65c1a533daad458ad6789","e725647349f46a7f63a92f080333c7539c866d7d","f4a270bf1332ef5842e7f480c72a988a7a7e5102","7ef44e387264f2866755aa6a976105b5e52c188a","0aeb0f9e66234b6ef991ffde6ed58a2be2ad4dd4","446539d43b1c9bb23e2b1732b7c411be462d8515"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Comparison of bougie-guided insertion of Proseal™ laryngeal mask airway with digital technique in adults","doi":"10.4103/0019-5049.60494","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.4103/0019-5049.60494","venue":"Indian journal of anaesthesia"}

In this paper we explore the nature of that challenge and the implications for archival research and education agendas, and for archival science itself in an increasingly globalised world. Disclaimer: The authors are keenly aware that this article grapples with complex insider-outsider issues and is inevitably framed in terms of a particular world view. This may well be challenged by or will evolve based on the richer understandings of differing worldviews that it is hoped will flow from engaging with the local and the indigenous, and pluralising our research and education agendas on the basis of those understandings. We would also hope to see this engagement reflected in the pages of this and other archival journals. Archival Paradigms In human societies, individuals and groups make and keep records that document their activities and function as evidence and memory. While records and recordkeeping may take many forms, which records are made and kept relates to prevailing ideas about their usefulness and continuing value to individuals, groups and the wider society. Societies institutionalise their collective archives according to their own evidence and memory paradigms. These paradigms influence what is remembered and what is forgotten, what is preserved and what is destroyed, how archival knowledge is defined, what forms archives take, how archives are described and indexed, and who has ownership, custodial and access rights relating to them. They also shape archival notions of reliability, authenticity, and trustworthiness. 1","inCitations":["9393216f6ea446cb74cf27aa3ee9ee76576b92d5","201ec6e4e150f98dfb015b1ce7e1a1be84d47ee1","2939b6bb57b3132a65719ddc001e3525918ec031","c03c819c7644b64a7f2f2e99c96f7a01e3ff7cf6","5a27289a9769fe0821deda7a9df00f46120da953","80e9d267dc5ada81da293a94b3523eccfcac220f","802805f60120cc726ec9a88817a82a0cff6d31eb","ce840461746d92851a82f9f9bf265e4ad14c2c89","2e242afff4ccb4cb3e6276aeca7bbfc0e2189c1f","190cc94dd6741263fbe772e51c502b9ab35370de","1d979c8f4d47932918d95c052ad62ab3b2750f63","bf1dc825e3a697c5010cfb969696ce7a2db3c5e8","3b354fd815a646718e74e894fe00898d509ac94c","b9db6adb6e4edb41bdea8915ece9afc6e7b8e0aa","3dfae8ef1468f133d296e590c5cbf0fda1005f93","11a99e3b1fe2ed7bdc596a602c303120691867e0","bc5bb961b75c05aa974c117ed8899e93e4638d79","e8dddf1f87eefa73d68f2c1c37bbbfe62688bab1","1c9a544834dbc32c499f80da477619cf90c9a90d","f23bdcf8968951fb1b7cff451d48545246b36f45","591d526591ea817c92408fe79174f18e4b5a58dc","e7434f37e984908631cd3b723a07fdeaf7d7d7ab","c86997a1f51260e2cb21aafde599faa8eee966dd","f7718b5bd1ce32ab3ea5f7864834e5dae044402a","648d3587aa9beb74c7d2d870e59f298b763db307","f2b2c5f47dfa0dfb67d76fca9d57e6b3559587d8","e93b4338c8e9ffb3ff260c194d1113643dbae262","4a086d8f3182b8f08ac7fa79453b58cd10602525","75f27332310551217ae9d604d476ebc5fabc4771","acc8840b8a8d43b4b44ad246797a5b7aba506672","2fd2ceb4ac3a9a85b6987a4af98cd44ab502f9e8","ca027088fab575c11d9de5ba7d024221936f4487"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"\"Communities of Memory\": Pluralising Archival Research and Education Agendas","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

The present study used repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to further examine the functional role of this structure in the successful use of the PSVA. Moreover, we investigated which auditory parameter used in the prosthesis (pitch, intensity, or spatial location) might contribute to this occipital activation. Results revealed that rTMS applied to right dorsal extrastriate cortex in EB subjects interferes with both the PSVA use and the auditory spatial location task but not with pitch and intensity discriminations. By contrast, rTMS targeting the same cortical areas in sighted subjects did not affect performance on any auditory tasks. Early visual deprivation thus leads to functional cerebral cross-modal reorganization in the processing of auditory information and auditory-to-visual sensory substitution. The findings also point to the specific involvement of the dorsal visual stream for auditory spatial processing in blind subjects.

This article presents, first, an understanding of legal goods as intrinsic rights in the relationships of justice, and applies them to the Church and its specific legal goods; particularly, to the word of God and the Sacraments. Second, the article offers an interpretation of the legal good of faith as a common good of the Church’s horizontal dimension of communion. Specifically, it shows how sexual abuse crimes against minors committed by the clerk affect the communion within the People of God in terms of faith and hope. The article concludes with some suggestions for a renewed penal canon law, which should expanded to protect the ecclesiastical legal goods as a whole, and value thoroughly the legal process.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"La fe como bien jurídico y los abusos sexuales en la Iglesia: reflexiones sobre el texto del Papa emérito Benedicto XVI","doi":"10.24822/rjduandes.0301.6","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.24822/rjduandes.0301.6","venue":""}

Thus the distinction between these two characteristics becomes important. Distinguishing between chaotic and aleatory signals is difficult because they have a common wide band power spectrum, a delta like autocorrelation function, and share other features as well. In general, signals are presented as continuous records and require to be discretized for being analyzed. In this work, we introduce different schemes for discretizing and for detecting dynamical changes in time series. One of the main motivations is to detect transitions between the chaotic and random regime. The tools here used here originate from the Information Theory. The schemes proposed are applied to simulated and real life signals, showing in all cases a high proficiency for detecting changes in the dynamics of the associated time series.","inCitations":["b1e07604a3676b7115b6387168a61eddbf52c125","3bd8b31136dbcfd2048aff52f8d6b466c0973dc2"],"pdfUrls":["https://arxiv.org/pdf/1702.08276v1.pdf"],"title":"Detecting dynamical changes in time series by using the Jensen Shannon divergence.","doi":"10.1063/1.4999613","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1063/1.4999613","venue":"Chaos"}
