However, the effect of H. perforatum L. on metabolism is still unknown. In order to test whether H. perforatum L. extract (EHP) has an effect on metabolic syndrome, we treated diet induced obese (DIO) C57BL/6J mice with the extract. The chemical characters of EHP were investigated with thin-layer chromatography, ultraviolet, high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and HPLC-mass spectrometry fingerprint analysis. Oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), insulin tolerance test (ITT), and the glucose infusion rate (GIR) in hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp test were performed to evaluate the glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity. Skeletal muscle was examined for lipid metabolism. The results suggest that EHP can significantly improve the glucose and lipid metabolism in DIO mice. In vitro, EHP inhibited the catalytic activity of recombinant human protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) and reduced the protein and mRNA levels of PTP1B in the skeletal muscle. Moreover, expressions of genes related to fatty acid uptake and oxidation were changed by EHP in the skeletal muscle. These results suggest that EHP may improve insulin resistance and lipid metabolism in DIO mice.","inCitations":["7295456cabd8cea6f4e45abca22507a210092974","bd4311439edaa28c4351bcb650175e319636cc45","7a7ea7edeccccad1c848040bfda5b1e109a3253b","e999d23551840ef061b77946d2279f3085676708"],"pdfUrls":["https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/pmc/oa_pdf/89/f5/ptr0029-0086.PMC4303982.pdf"],"title":"Effect of Hypericum perforatum L.

Social work education aimed at students preparing for work in child welfare is no exception. This banded dissertation consists of three products that address linkages between strengths and resilience perspectives to social work education and practice with families involved in child welfare. The first paper is a conceptual article that discusses engaged pedagogy, transformative learning and reflective teaching pedagogies specific to child welfare-focused social work education. The paper explores the cogency of these pedagogies as powerful approaches for educating and preparing social work students for work in the child welfare field. As reflective practice is taught and modeled in the social work classroom, students learn to examine their own biases and attitudes about the child welfare-involved family. The second paper is a systematic literature review identifying current theoretical and practice themes in child welfare work with families. Using the Preferred Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) approach, the review examined the professional literature to identify theoretical and practice themes within the scope of the search. The criteria for inclusion in the systematic review focused on peer reviewed articles published in the last eleven years that were directed at strengths and resilience-focused work with families in child welfare. The third product of the banded dissertation was an annotated narrative of a peer-reviewed national conference presentation in which the author addressed effective pedagogy in child welfare-focused social work education.

James Nash’s understanding of humans as altruistic, creative predators can further Catholic ecological ethics because it strikes a better balance between humanity’s call to love creation and the moral ambiguity of the evolutionary process. Humans as creative predators suggests three new understandings of what ecological sacrifice could entail: 1) to see the death of every creature, even if a morally justifiable death, as a kind of sacrifice; 2) to recognize that ecological sustainability may demand dramatic and subversive shifts in behavior; and 3) to sacrifice our tendency to view nonhumans instrumentally by advocating a Biotic Bill of Rights.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Co-Creator or Creative Predator?: James Nash’s Contributions to Catholic Social Teaching on Ecological Ethics","doi":"10.1163/15685357-01802001","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1163/15685357-01802001","venue":""}

Both PDK1 and PKB can interact at the plasma membrane with a phosphoinositide synthesized by PI3K, the second messenger PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, enabling PDK1 to phosphorylate and activate PKB. In the PDK1 K465E knock-in mice expressing a mutant form of PDK1 incapable of phosphoinositide binding, activation of PKB was markedly affected, but not totally abolished. It has been recently proposed that in the absence of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 binding, PDK1 can still moderately activate PKB due to a docking site-mediated interaction of these 2 kinases. A recent report has uncovered that in the PDK1 K465E mice neurons, a PKB signal threshold was sufficient to support neuronal survival responses, whereas neuritogenesis, neuronal polarization and axon outgrowth were severely impaired. We propose here that the low-efficiency mechanism of PKB activation observed in the PDK1 K465E mice might represent the ancestral mechanism responsible for the essential functions of this pathway, while the phosphoinositide-dependent activation should be considered an evolutionary innovation that enabled the acquisition of novel functions.","inCitations":["608e9508d62ac30d6b3f7fba88b34c2c1009c50a","1c9313152bb17546c5ccd49d45b62a88d385d5c4","9d25ce1b0289857cb6524fa899d715092abfe22e","6de7da31cfbf141fbcc5d6b44a5a9071750411f5","deed29d364e27407886e12e2721064cf4952ffdb","e62689dd380b60ea0200d4361cfa6d57567f2701","a816c6ab6015fd763192e6d0f91279fc26227f14","e539f3f98370ea41927e3c68fa7758b4a4b53fd0"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Fine-tuning the intensity of the PKB/Akt signal enables diverse physiological responses.","doi":"10.4161/15384101.2014.962954","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.4161/15384101.2014.962954","venue":"Cell cycle"}

En mutation constante, les differents acteurs presents sur Internet possedent plusieurs roles dans cette construction identitaire de l'individu en ligne. D'une part l'emergence du web social, sous la forme du profil, fait de l'utilisateur un acteur pluri-positionnel (enonciateur, recepteur, transmetteur, etc.) et lui donne, en outre une identite relationnelle. D'autre part, les contraintes imposees par le reseau et les enjeux situes a des differents niveaux, suggerent la remise en cause hierarchie horizontale de nœuds, – unites minimales qui composent le reseau –, et a son tour les nœuds incarnes par les utilisateurs. Cependant, pourrait un nœud etre social ? La communication digitale interactive pourrait-elle se fonder sur de presupposes qui excluent l'individu ? Au-dela de cette identite relationnelle du web social, est-il possible de concevoir une identite digitale qui soit homologable a l'identite nominale d'un individu d'une societe quelconque ? Les conditions, les premisses et la confluence de plusieurs pratiques digitales sont les facteurs a analyser afin de trouver des reponses possibles a ce type de problematique.

Design/methodology/approach – Altogether, 771 questionnaires were sent to 17 day-care centres in Lower Saxony, Germany. A total of 238 questionnaires were completed. The Perceived Food Risk Index was used to identify the main dimensions of parental risk perception of mycotoxins. Open and closed questions measured aWTP for risk reduction and parental risk estimates. Findings – The respondents believed that mycotoxins posed a moderate health risk for children in Germany.

variety of medications such as anticholinergics, antidepressants, and opiates. In this review, we focus on opioid-induced constipation (OIC), which is often underrecognized and undertreated in the elderly. When opioid therapy is initiated, healthcare providers are encouraged to evaluate risk factors for the development of constipation as part of a thorough patient history. To this end, the patient assessment should include the use of validated instruments, such as the Bristol Stool Scale and Bowel Function Index, to confirm the diagnosis and provide a basis for evaluating treatment outcomes. Healthcare providers should use a stepwise approach to the treatment of OIC in the elderly. Conventional laxatives are a first-line option and considered well tolerated with short-term use as needed; however, evidence is lacking to support their effectiveness in OIC. Moreover, because of the risk of adverse events and other considerations, such as chewing difficulties and swallowing disorders, conventional oral laxatives may be inappropriate for the treatment of OIC in the elderly. Thus, the availability of new pharmacologic agents such as the peripherally acting µ-opioid receptor antagonists methylnaltrexone and naloxegol, which target the underlying causes of OIC, and the secretagogue lubiprostone may provide more effective treatment options for elderly patients with OIC.","inCitations":["e5428a375e3ba689c39dc207c74b0ed71fdb93d6","a0c1e0233fe07a9b1358f3915668d06080d9301f","adc80456efb602a47556bbf63b2098da8b4ec037","f9536704790fb725ce34a6d0e9a544ec554874a5","7e7d40ce5fe46009e1ef2e5b75f3468a1b4037cb","efb23879cce215646ad7908fe543c315eae10412","a2033a890eaa89e0158b8f7fbc9ba9c5781e203c","088bed77ae21fcf99ab1ff1b030f8534aea10e64","06850883060fadbe8b707dcfb04a31395d1f5e6b","e55bdea7514a4575eff0ccccd1ae9d2714028b91"],"pdfUrls":["https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/pmc/oa_pdf/90/dc/40266_2016_Article_381.PMC5012150.pdf","http://books.ebooktake.in/-PDF-Obras-Completas-Tomo-VIII-El-Chiste-y-Su-Relacion-Con-Lo-Inconciente-Spanish-Edition-.pdf"],"title":"Constipation in Elderly Patients with Noncancer Pain: Focus on Opioid-Induced Constipation","doi":"10.1007/s40266-016-0381-2","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s40266-016-0381-2","venue":"Drugs & Aging"}

De igual forma las instituciones educativas se ven obligadas a medir la calidad educativa. Para ello se necesita conocer los factores que influyen en la calidad de la institución, entre ellos, los relacionados al rendimiento académico de sus alumnos y al grado de satisfacción de sus egresados. Para lograr esto se utilizarán valiosas técnicas estadísticas que permitirán clasificar sujetos u objetos a partir de características similares. Estas técnicas se pueden diferenciar por la manera de extraer conocimiento útil escondido en los datos. Por un lado, el Análisis Discriminante, también referido como reconocimiento de patrones supervisado o asistido o aprendizaje con guía. Por otro lado, el Análisis de Conglomerados, referido como reconocimiento de patrón no supervisado o conocimiento sin guía. Como es común recopilar grandes conjuntos de datos, de distinta naturaleza, en voluminosas bases de datos, es que se utilizarán los análisis de Datos Simbólicos empleando la Lógica Difusa, que son también herramientas para Data Mining.

The (0.1{2.4) keV spectra of both objects appear similar. However, due to better sampling spectral modeling is only warranted in case of NGC6240 for which both a single thermal Raymond-Smith model (kT =0 :440:15 keV) or a hybrid model consisting of 80%power-lawwiththecanonicalphotonindex 1:9plus20% Raymond-Smith contribution (kT =0 :63 0:35 keV) lead to good ts. However, the single thermal model turns out to be un- likely because it yields a luminosity of 3:810 43 erg s 1 , which is hard to reach in a starburst superwind{scenario. The hybrid model leads to a more moderate luminosity of 5:210 42 erg s 1 , of which 1:010 42 erg s 1 can be attributed to shocked super- wind gas. We link the remaining 4:210 42 erg s 1 powerlaw to an AGN component because the alternative of inverse-compton scattering of the FIR radiation leads to a too low flux when es- timated with available data. The result appears to be consistent with preliminarily announced ASCA observations. For NGC2782 we nd Lx(0.1{2.4 keV) = 410 41 erg s 1 (within a factor of four) which can be explained by emission from a shocked superwind region with a high preshock density in agreement with earlier optical evidence for an outflowing supershell.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://aa.springer.de/papers/8330003/2300823.pdf","https://arxiv.org/pdf/astro-ph/9710098v1.pdf","http://arxiv.org/pdf/astro-ph/9710098v1.pdf"],"title":"Rosat Evidence for Agn and Superwind Activity in Ngc 6240 and Ngc 2782","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

The negative effect is formalized by introducing inflation uncertainty effects into the aggregate supply function generated by Fischer's model of overlapping wage contracts.

These changes follow since monetary policy will affect the variance of inflation and, hence, real output through its effect in the labor market.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"A note on inflation uncertainty and monetary policy","doi":"10.1016/0164-0704(89)90069-4","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/0164-0704%2889%2990069-4","venue":""}

The aim of this study is to define culture parameters that promote neotissue formation with the use of dermal fibroblasts and SIS. SIS sheets were seeded with dermal fibroblasts and cultured for 4 weeks. The resultant cell-scaffold composites (CSCs) were cultured with media alone, media supplemented with ascorbic acid, or fibronectin-pretreated SIS and ascorbic acid. CSCs were analyzed for cellular invasion into the scaffold, the rate of type I collagen production, MMP gelatinolytic activity, thickness, and ultrastructural morphology. CSCs treated with fibronectin and ascorbate showed an increase in Type I collagen production, no change in the MMP gelatinolytic activity, an increase in CSC thickness, and an organized neotissue on the surface of the SIS. Minimal cellular invasion was noted, suggesting that fibroblasts use the SIS as a template for neotissue growth rather than as a scaffold. These results indicate that fibronectin-treated SIS cultured with dermal fibroblasts in the presence of ascorbic acid will promote true neotissue formation for future cardiovascular tissue engineering efforts.","inCitations":["803d1dac8162e4be1e0f0198b59b07f38ae9b2c6","017481b3193c8e82ddd00a425cae0080989e5258","b2735032e85beee240214067d1356febafe0a794","26a14822b7600f38d23d28b086b3efbd469aaa72","2dac15793ab4eda187fbe65aa8186c457029d130","9c86b6697a00b16f79182ce790598c7152c85b77","5c60e3d3b9c19512cb8ac9b0c4ba07b2d822c2a0","c227211b40ae6320ce3e3e85fe90f90c0e27f01d","b3733d91e3cf8d521df13e94aa206078937fde0c","58fc09587cb246dfb819df06e20b0f16aeeaecaf"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Dermal fibroblasts cultured on small intestinal submucosa: Conditions for the formation of a neotissue.","doi":"10.1002/jbm.a.30493","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1002/jbm.a.30493","venue":"Journal of biomedical materials research.

It has been shown that patient specific factors, perhaps genes, contribute to this process.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nTo determine whether completion of healing after PTCA is part of an acute self limiting inflammatory process and whether polymorphism at important inflammatory gene loci might determine susceptibility to restenosis after PTCA.\n\n\nDESIGN\nDNA samples were collected from 171 patients attending for elective PTCA in Sheffield (S) and Leicester (L), who were scheduled to undergo follow up angiography (at four months (L) or six months (S)) as part of other restenosis studies. At follow up angiography, the patients were separated into restenosers (> 50% luminal narrowing) and non-restenosers (< 50% luminal narrowing). Four DNA polymorphisms within interleukin 1 (IL-1) related loci (IL-1A (-889), IL-1B (-511), IL-1B (+3954), and IL-1RN intron 2 VNTR (variable number tandem repeat)) were genotyped using methods based on polymerase chain reaction. Significance was assessed by chi(2) analysis of the relevant contingency table, and the magnitude of effect was estimated by calculating odds ratios. The Mantel-Haenszel (MH) test was applied to summarise data across the two populations.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAllele 2 at IL-1RN (IL-1RN*2) was significantly over represented in the non-restenoser group (L+S, 34% v 23% in restenosers). Furthermore, IL-1RN*2 homozygosity was increased in the non-restenoser population compared with the restenosers (MH test: p = 0.0196 (L+S); p = 0.031 (L+S, single vessel disease only), and the effect seemed to be restricted to the single vessel disease subpopulation. For other polymorphism within IL-1 related loci no significant associations were found with either restenosis or non-restenosis.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIL-1RN*2 may be associated with protection from restenosis after PTCA for individuals with single vessel disease. As this polymorphism has functional significance, this finding suggests that alteration in an individual's inflammatory predisposition may modulate the blood vessel response to injury.","inCitations":["8f242b9024c1344eae144e2fc2480ab6350cbc80","6dbb00548c763c0880bee6573b355dfdf72a93d0","cdc769e3eaf8fcea28e7bd2f723e43a5a8dea407","1eb88de6db0f6ef87cb0638e7249aba6553a37a1","f7ab8b38370fc79ed91ebf216928985d94b5861c","b46a703c45d9f8359867f6f4ed8b1ce628c7ec12","33fc0d2baff45a7023a0d9940516a636a1ad5f22","bf1429ce444b0db9a3547090ca8a09668fa398a4","1871240c1a655c97445c740948baa2a0299e514e","c48809431fc2573508dc4a163e1935bd45dfd657","58f3ac2d24895aafeba423377caee68edb9500ff","6a9cf407c6659665b9f24c0726fd24ce3b14112c","9578930a90ecbce24418586664fd5f00ae37dd5c","fbfe78b9149976ec60bf62eb757f31d294903385","48926527f5d7e82e2231cad0aaed6262e1486973","14193391024bc56e9432c72a438ae92e21c7579c","7d9339370f3405f0bfc761fb25924c41a02bf3f6","e34b1f0d37c2af0f09c03d6185795be05cd7e5e5"],"pdfUrls":["http://heart.bmj.com/content/heartjnl/86/3/336.full.pdf"],"title":"Interleukin 1 receptor antagonist gene polymorphism and restenosis after coronary angioplasty.","doi":"10.1136/heart.86.3.336","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1136/heart.86.3.336","venue":"Heart"}

RCAS retroviruses that express the avian subgroup A envelope transduce only mammalian cells genetically engineered to express the avian retroviral receptor, tumor virus A (TVA). Here, we generated a knockin mouse line termed LSL-R26(Tva-lacZ) with concomitant conditional expression of TVA and lacZ by targeting the Rosa26 locus. A loxP-flanked transcriptional stop cassette was used for conditional activation of TVA and LacZ expression in a Cre-recombinase-dependent manner. To demonstrate the ability of this system for conditional somatic gene transfer in vivo, we directed TVA expression to the pancreas. Introduction of an RCAS vector with Bryan-RSV polymerase and subgroup A envelope [RCASBP(A)] carrying oncogenic Kras(G12D) induced focal ductal pancreatic lesions that recapitulate human pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasias that progress to pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas. TVA-mediated infection of genetically engineered mice with endogenous expression of Kras(G12D) in pancreatic progenitor cells by using RCASBP(A) virus carrying a short hairpin RNA directed against murine TP53, resulted in dramatically enhanced progression to invasive adenocarcinomas. These results show that conditional expression of TVA enables spatiotemporal gene expression and knockdown in a small subset of somatic cells in vivo. Therefore, it closely models carcinogenesis in humans where tumors evolve from somatic gene mutations in developmentally normal cells. Combined with the growing number of Cre expression models, RCAS-TVA-based gene expression and knockdown systems open up promising perspectives for analysis of gene function in a time-controlled and tissue-specific fashion in vitro and in vivo.","inCitations":["64f975dc7fd9ccd10f8ccd32ccfd062538054420","3f87a2c316b9c5e1e51f1d7da3c3534502405328","bc27ea21ed23f84677d9c00102862ad7969f0992","6e760c2c61b3218bcc06600f1d014fe40ff1fd14","5af04e43e044c9de033c9f84163fa86594bcdd3a","b4f6ada93ecf3080f935d5a642cdf25dd580d9dc","d295f3b9c3345a88fd00e189ac8e03163bb72c91","fbfb090f32b861017847c427c224375d2a097b94","bfe3eafcdbff8a0c98c526ff9f002ff09424713d","2307fa385da2db7bb5da29865c28e1c0ff12b0f5","7486e544dcaab024e637feb27c0623760eb7b8b2","21283b3bd05a619c9681de0f05b03e8da6b47e13","2430d428d4ec8b4f5faa8f7c35ad27aa58424b00","311c552420240866dc48df7587b8e13e6932bc28","828db3ed5728fdc2b640df3afa60b74729bf6003","8e311e32bea045c906336b5640a794c526f92d78","b7c41ecbc37e9c365494e0ef61525ee8823f6866","9fbbbbd2a4bdcefd2914293d3f1529e0e37e4d75","29f6c0af4d912c5a50f0aabe850002dfabb6f45a","b9420dfefe6df1ef5251eecddbb2e3ab7f7f4fb0","0c5b8a36ba9505abba6e12f35e30b881de978938","35b7dad2dd5a4108c4f9070d898616dfeb9a07b2","e967291e31f4007cb630b737e363fa873c043310","b82e1a3a3934038c490f629aaf29e252d8c98d96","39ecfa27ec0f40ecab4e253a07ffbd4a5b5f06ee","fb9c8c0daaa293a87356c5478b87956ec265e451","34a5acf48d99973fd85a72c62d3960c89c74702b","5ed647dbf5417456b746fbd425ac130a64d36975","3f0b60b67a9ad0521e9564be18e6e954d31686a9","54eeb88de399d773c62d7090bb27135aa03c8348","750c307772b08ff0b136a2f4d8fabf5a5ff752b9","ccf2a8b5fd4c81b6133b8bed408bc8e9bc175774","f8ce06a94a9b347a3adda8de40e7701e8b9824ac","81bb3ebea260c4160a9d43d4b7f7961872a6fb0c","5487b3a0b58c2111fc4561000fb8fc7f5328537a","c3b955ddcfb192a87e70c01ff1feef3afee9dd4c","f5697c8194285b9956149a46d19826c24be50d81","2587476cb118481df9ad04b38de5fc426b416243","b1de51362d36d78e591063e634de1b3653fcdae3","e1d70451f94e66822ca1b881a5810b910d16ecb1","f914d85da0b943c24bfcc8f68272334677331435","69442a15b028c0b9a9aee7ab7dac7d0e3bd8994f","68e4555a74e06c759c4db4a9573f533b60943350","1fe1478999e95291ce64e3cbf1a8b2a429bec35d","c44fce31e1103bceb5118336bc2e7bc18c000336","c5b84393df7e48da21f6b28f393e9e8439e2e434","fd36428ecf638cb7a5eb9aab89b9a0c579405dbe","73d0baeb4f5119f1bd459995347789fc49c2d763","94680a2d4fdcbabb9e25f9b7ff1584713fcd0ce8","320a21e74d708ccddfeb471ebb3c79b1519ebf98","25e6c9a24f571a2418b15fc01d222510608cd445","19dd0d4f2b1cdc795c7298495bc98c1ed500bef6","590f39127ca0faa1db7930040aa1c3d59b3ad1a6","44d195ab3fe7fe2e6096caaf8af095bf120890af","1e647db16724470f359df7806bdd6ec44ad69508","e84776676162417e9aa0fc9c2890581fe16d79bf","393ca043dcad38b6404ce348e4f1c12d48d46f94","f6c74cf49cebaefc1f94db16387f1bebb1ccbf37","62c320dbfbe8d825dd6ebcef1f80ecd20da54495","5a49193da05341c121ec7691942bdd94e673068e","6450eabdec6e0a6647d987dae3a77944e6cf3128","beef36dfc3e7dc559fb24ba0e633c252d9afc3f3","476c66699b2d0ffe63d462a214053a74ae0528f3","67f7a8f40c379ba2bcdafe13a349da294a328080","6144c3a236bff65ca86cca8beb0bcc7c3a6312df","78e6320c98985494bb5f20c6d9e82534bb3d5e11","2174e43fcb2d1b1f5c8460a61fa28ef2b052afe5","6b001b72172ea8841f70018b6948ca1549543b20","e42c13001b96d97c13447768ac2d18c959088859","160d2a1d18cfcf929fef044baaf1756b21c0a406","0da2a7c5894075b4ba1fe1936de9426d9fc99710","d03675081185740756768cdbec6d0d44a9ad1d37","6d1ea166210fc9fb5d30bae6d34027bbc0f6dc3e","b68584d0949ff44a15fb99d7498f0a3307e91413","2beb98eacc26164d6337a0c26cc67a9f7aa03287","dcf4d28965150e499a4436e79adb6db8365fcd29","29e2a0eb54c4792013ddce7397116290704f7e50","9db582b6f12e8e3a6c6aa04a4b0262fc69ddb738","9ad86c7d4332c66fef5492aae322b2e7d0dbe649","3a6cec85de1cd0e747cd4988b702c37a6d5fd908","601237971edb351be58c8e7e8055c78e9f4656e9","3ebc8c9b2a55a2a7b66411236f178c7cc0c4d87b","adf2e56c4ceb2241d87b3db01ff26f796056156d","e4602484112b56a500797ace51579560f5594001"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.pnas.org/content/105/29/10137.full.pdf"],"title":"A Cre-loxP-based mouse model for conditional somatic gene expression and knockdown in vivo by using avian retroviral vectors.","doi":"10.1073/pnas.0800487105","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0800487105","venue":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America"}

During the deposition of each layer, the films were baked in a microwave oven which in turn resulted in a low temperature crystallization of these thin films compared to the conventional method. The crystallite sizes of the films were ranged between 25–35 nm depending up on the annealing temperature. The dielectric constant of the films decreased with increase in frequency whereas the loss has increased and ranged between (480–100) and (0.03–0.30), respectively. The DFM (Dynamic force microscopy) images of the films shows the spherical grains with uniform microstructure and an average grain size of 80–110 nm. The hardness of the films ranged between 2–5 GPA.

The aim of computational ethics is to generate populations of artificial agents which are capable of adopting patterns of behavior. There are two types of norm implementations into an agent's environment. They are either the central control where emergence of norms is under the coordinator's control, or the open systems which are more autonomous [1]. There are three phases of norm creation and spreading: the norm formation, propagation and emergence. This three-stage model is called the life-cycle of the norm. There are numbers of ways how to implement it [2]. \n \nThe ethics is a moral framework defined by duties like obligation [3]. We can illustrate this with a situation where an agent has no other moral choice than the one represented by obligation, not to perform this specific action in contrary to morality. The other duty is responsibility. The agent does not have to act on the specific action, but he performs actions contributing to the desired results. In addition to duties, ethics is defined by the set of rights and liberties, and these determine the level of the agent's freedom. But it is important to distinguish the differences between norms, conventions and laws [2]. \n \n!!Aim of the Project \nThe aim of this work is gaining knowledge of computation ethics and prepare a scenario for multi-agent based simulation in NetLogo (modeling environment). Compiling of the scenario consists of definition of agent's types, their cost functions, properties and strategies. This simulation reflects the societal behavior controlled by norms of Golden Rule and Tit for Tat. Golden Rule, or Ethic of Reciprocity is a norm essentially claiming the following [3]: If the agent likes the action to be done to it, then the agent may perform the action towards another agent. The other norm - Tit for Tat - is similar. The agent's attitude is based on experience with another agent - simply he returns exactly what he gets. The scenario must reflect interaction of both norms and their changes in the society with “parasites”- those who violate the norms. The interaction between students and their tendency to sharing their homework is the suitable scenario.

The protection by human milk has long been attributed to the presence of secretory IgA. However, human milk contains large numbers and amounts of complex carbohydrates, including glycoproteins, glycolipids, glycosaminoglycans, mucins, and especially oligosaccharides. The oligosaccharides comprise the third most abundant solid constituent of human milk, and contain a myriad of structures. Complex carbohydrate moieties of glycoconjugates and oligosaccharides are synthesized by the many glycosyltransferases in the mammary gland; those with homology to cell surface glycoconjugate pathogen receptors may inhibit pathogen binding, thereby protecting the nursing infant. Several examples are reviewed: A fucosyloligosaccharide inhibits the diarrheagenic effect of stable toxin of Escherichia coli. A different fucosyloligosaccharide inhibits infection by Campylobacter jejuni. Binding of Streptococcus pneumoniae and of enteropathogenic E. coli to their respective receptors is inhibited by human milk oligosaccharides. The 46-kD glycoprotein, lactadherin, inhibits rotavirus binding and infectivity. Low levels of lactadherin in human milk are associated with a higher incidence of symptomatic rotavirus in breast-fed infants. A mannosylated glycopeptide inhibits binding by enterohemorrhagic E. coli. A glycosaminoglycan inhibits binding of gp120 to CD4, the first step in HIV infection. Human milk mucin inhibits binding by S-fimbriated E. coli. The ganglioside, GM1, reduces diarrhea production by cholera toxin and labile toxin of E. coli. The neutral glycosphingolipid, Gb3, binds to Shigatoxin. Thus, many complex carbohydrates of human milk may be novel antipathogenic agents, and the milk glycoconjugates and oligosaccharides may be a major source of protection for breastfeeding infants.","inCitations":["eaf42ff6d35b281bd896174ab9b38661c7e0724a","46bb5d5b097e574c90d97470376600913cf3b75a","33b1ec49e446e21e3a7a7ddd6cc421b8c815b2f1","8ca83ef1b24ada49d1dba9add69d38e68791f449","86fb8b16b10d6480c628386f828d630e80181a3f","996de81bc3275f04e881ad8d9d9cf2d2b62b6d12","23e0335eae912f11f99602de5c22c5fca942d071","392020a7e8b1d4e000a2d834971b456b8e520797","f4020d1000abcc5c5ca5bf4ef24e3db88711649c","85f2e12a4741c49f27f1962aa94812b9af1c146d","d702b02fe264135152c85400e314aa8d14cbc850","63f83d20823943a2af818a005cd24401177c85e4","d0fb5470945fced197240ecdd544c6b217c91606","f7d78028895b01485f6ae292b7f486668653f666","227243c56bd99ea41d6e1f347b72f04a460313f1","58b0b87d13675662320e258271d612290dc8432d","0c18cf8bd3e051af12fe4e96a4d7392a63a3543d","ff64da3a500807c07ffa3ea3c17885915906797c","a9ba215ab83fecc431ef82fef31ca59d1983b5e6","af29cb6ecf4e48cc01380a012807ca46027db6b7","c958436e623297718feb71a19fdba1b4c7a44875","804160e74b26f59186106df03c5f6ab02599f799","af1bbefa54985c9bb0dde2250a50760ba0a835bc","308282ea0177601d3c029f5594bb5d881320ff43","f207086d990dff101252813c891d8397bb8d38fb","b3c2a50b9d0af439194d5fe767f3aae1cd711a6b","5e8bc98904b223dfe8c013fa62a138dde07967cc","1d475cf6d7fd39195ae20ce51620695d6040e6e4","181dae5295329ae33670b317c44b31eacc28e83a","e007123c76481464fcc52743300f30d2e1de1288","7e2f3c027ec4cb2a22f29e336258437bf7039e62","72dac8c5f138f8af29b0ee5cad4b2c7991c2e4ea","1b5359cde5e96fb71ffa73b9d3063d814b55b97e","5f8d0de04eab044fadd47bc365104f44559b8c49","ecb70f51e017416b4a2d0ea0852b35600e0e0c78","52c5ec3d43934fcb18a31454430d2793127cd13a","99b83e6301385ba254b66649476c07cb94dd486a","671c8685d15b7cb378dab99f80be573e4de8d5e2","2b4d1a32c16dc1026aa6ea7d24817eb07669516e","b2490f72eb7dc2a44bce18525f452ae518020978","ed8c2e808cd9ef3d04a6b9c8cba8e8e7c19c70d3","b151fc23c03ba3491ac7e42cc530b14d69898eec","afcc91bc9cfad87072b63e3ad2937c53121dd95d","00a60a3005512ff4095742534476345e2e31183d","a67c04d1ed1550253808b791bce1bdca993371db","f49cf8723fe84062bda9d5ba455bb583578a85b4","7d9a5ddaeae3dc754c869c66224f953b8bb7bd44","7978ef73323a2dacfe6694fc11dfa68a61c369e5","4ca71e5d8897908f16b921a867627ab008df4815","70e6ee3c85f4705b0ca0488f147a5a17dd749665","42b166c97b2c6885d70e609817ab375ad032292e","c80f5fcd6e529558d92fe0d3319e0737faf45b7f","6bb21c7455a877c14801418e9376c0da591a9c7e","f8ff87960d51f82677b082ef5ac1285ea454c5ec","0d8d13e669d6d1f759443d6998ce0e0bd67a7131","c6ed32cd1273519fac64e746f8e0d46674e766e4","29ce827fdb4f478a87d7be1bee9aa4cf6a07a8fc","41f4080c6e34e29f9c9d415cd6005079bdcc3cfd","64dd9b8e0bc71f02b5957af1d6eb363aeec37a88","d78fc55a8dac8cbed895f8e0930392414558e183","a0c5ca14af3accd6ef8280b5743310ff24eaeb5a","9feaf1327d5b90276aea1f84cb6e4c420c75fd9c","6fa747720df31d128f5b0d777ac6047cb738f03f","8cc294519c08d3fab57b42f1e9de81c16de57d24","07eb21486791cd9c05c5c44ec7afac70dea136cb","34fb2ad83067fb6bc74ffd0e55859cfcc26146aa","796ba67cbfc927229bb907d995afc0bc6b4c1685","b122c2b53ed0803d615dc3658c0d479c4d1d7ebb","d2f8561bf4cddd5fc270e19da8a9d87cff0fdd15","26f19ec01a81aef077c0bd122e574cbf26f3e052","d1ebf4380134c747e432d2b64611c01aebe62d52","1384c8e92fd54ada540388d4984c89c6b205426b","0b3cbfc49bac5d45be80271e4bbb4df454a6b8c0","7be9af30db66b9ae9e712a3f72af2189e8855c7b","feefefe13aba454e528b70c031c2f5909392d861","7b7ee1846a097aac46b7aaa816767fb192948d30","0fc2dd7999089b505cff0c1e7e985c3f8a1f7410","913f38f12249518390a79cadad022a2488cf8386","1b7cc3a79fe95b06d2ab91d53f4b4e7c3903c7c9","d5616da6cb37e68954f75802da2e4f0c866be2c1"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Human milk glycoconjugates that inhibit pathogens.","doi":"10.1002/chin.199920291","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1002/chin.199920291","venue":"Current medicinal chemistry"}

The aim of this work was to review the current practice and search for a standard protocol in the prophylaxis of DVT.\n\n\nMETHODS AND MATERIAL\nQuestionnaires addressing the routine prophylaxis of perioperative DVT for 4 groups of neurosurgical procedures and the estimation of risks and benefits of perioperative heparin (unfractionated and/or low-molecular-weight) administration were sent to 130 neurosurgical departments in Germany.\n\n\nRESULTS\n103 of 130 questionnaires were returned and suitable for analysis. The use of heparin (unfractionated and/or low-molecular-weight) is common, with some variation depending on the type of operation (83.5-99%). In spinal procedures, heparin administration is commonly started early, i. e., between the preoperative and first postoperative day (90.3-97.1%). This differs in intracranial procedures. In most neurosurgical departments heparin administration is stopped at the day of discharge (69.6-77.4% depending on procedure). Enoxaparin is the most commonly used heparin. In spinal as well as in cranial procedures, thrombosis risk reduction is unanimously assumed to be lesser the later administration starts. The estimation of the risks related to heparin injection are considered to be higher in cranial than in spinal operation in the early postoperative period. Most departments use antithrombotic stockings (ATS) irrespective of the type of surgery. However, 11% never use ATS.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn spinal surgery, a trend towards homogenization is observed with the early use of heparin. In intracranial procedures, practice is more heterogenous.

It is a highly selective COX-2 inhibitor. Results from previous feline studies showed that, despite a short half-life in blood, the effect of robenacoxib persisted for 24 h in clinical studies. A tissue cage model of acute inflammation was used to determine robenacoxib's pharmacokinetics and its ex vivo and in vivo selectivity for COX-1 and COX-2 using serum TxB(2) and exudate PGE(2) as surrogate markers for enzyme activity, respectively. After intravenous, subcutaneous and oral administration (2 mg/kg), the clearance of robenacoxib from blood was rapid (0.54-0.71 L·h/kg). The mean residence time (MRT) in blood was short (0.4, 1.9 and 3.3 h after intravenous, subcutaneous and oral administration, respectively), but in exudate MRT was approximately 24 h regardless of the route of administration. Robenacoxib inhibition of COX-1 in blood was transient, occurring only at high concentrations, but inhibition of COX-2 in exudate persisted to 24 h. The potency ratio (IC(50) COX-1: IC(50) COX-2) was 171:1, and slopes of the concentration-effect relationship were 1.36 and 1.12 for COX-1 and COX-2, respectively. These data highlight the enzymatic selectivity and inflamed tissue selectivity of robenacoxib and support the current recommendation of once-daily administration.","inCitations":["e156c57f3023615960a18f437f886cdc5c879f75","7bf3c9b41701cb212e7918a4ba97753343c0594d","1801ed0601ecaf801848526d46c13f4517f6a247","25b248e3793b9152077fb67c24c8d3938d73e2d9","b7e092d4a05ef2f9f66ac4a9d91477991b1bc604","d2dee0d14fcf721fe027d5ffe5a928ca52b5c95f","76e965bd50411f95509d14f073e31486325a65a8","b152f1cde04899a273b38e0a973ec972d83c32e0","e8246bae1cdefa5cbc38cad4db71f62022733bbb","cab21bf272c6e2d7443a1baabdeb4e217df804e3","4e49e44f30c05280c0203e2eeecc31152ef3ab1c","81b66df46757fe3e1342d500bf363098c8a00bdc","038ef6751e61dbbe8cb360cb3871d28e1461a3cf"],"pdfUrls":["https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/54826565.pdf","https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01191246/document","http://prodinra.inra.fr/ft?id=E552EFCE-FDB1-47F9-8BE8-57144B6CD4E2"],"title":"Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic modelling of robenacoxib in a feline tissue cage model of inflammation.","doi":"10.1111/j.1365-2885.2011.01288.x","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2885.2011.01288.x","venue":"Journal of veterinary pharmacology and therapeutics"}

We sought to evaluate the time course of biomarkers of oxidative stress and inflammation after AF ablation and their association with clinical variables.MethodsThirty consecutive patients (57.9 ± 1.7 years, 63% males) with paroxysmal AF underwent pulmonary vein isolation and ablation of complex fractionated atrial electrograms. Biomarkers were determined in blood samples before ablation and 6 h, 1, 2, 7, 30, 90 and 180 days post-ablation.ResultsThe pro-oxidant enzyme myeloperoxidase and oxidized low-density lipoprotein reflecting oxidant damage of lipoproteins increased 2.9 ± 0.2-fold and 1.2 ± 0.1-fold, respectively, and were significantly up-regulated until day 2 post-ablation. The anti-oxidant enzyme copper/zinc superoxide dismutase did not change significantly. Inflammatory markers significantly increased (high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP): 41 ± 8-fold; interleukin-6: 4.4 ± 0.7-fold) for 7 and 2 days, respectively. The increase of myeloperoxidase and hs-CRP was interrelated and both predicted early recurrence of AF within the first post-ablation week (both p < 0.05). The increase of both markers was associated with the amount of delivered radiofrequency energy (p < 0.05). The up-regulation of hs-CRP correlated with troponin T (p = 0.008), while myeloperoxidase and troponin T were borderline associated (p = 0.054). However, the oxidative and inflammatory responses did not predict long-term ablation outcome (p > 0.05).ConclusionsMarkers of oxidative stress showed a significant up-regulation during the first 2 days after AF ablation. Their up-regulation was linked to inflammation, delivered radiofrequency energy, and early recurrence of AF, but did not predict long-term ablation outcome.","inCitations":["e9b9fef979e3474ff99b19bff9f3a6b5fa04bc36","c92e471b67397d8351fdf76694e5e824a96b339d","59247e1fcef7a2c2e8c0f3df6b71f6514ffcd95c","1ae9b3237bd98e98174418001b3dfef9ff085095","85f0082a8ab302c7eaffd46e321e06560c6195cd","14c47b78708f6712b90de7d477b7ca2315e9b148","dd725bf1290c20449e574c13a04599dc04e446b7","ad3eb3531d03a1868da1e7b6a9a21d768b352323","5eefa5ead390590113798e1f43dbc8c235d8c4ff","a3a2879e9768b3affc27a22c76e48ce8b09f0212","09eccc91cd3d4119e02e102e2ac2ebe71a21ed27","49a050170010249c6abb050604201271594a4bcd","c8f8754f2b0e3c22d84fcfe5243da2822d074497","81694e8ce98ed26379f4233e2eccbb06547d9a81","7e280227ecdb241b000440c195395c784840d649","a99c9c3a045b064447b23a185b24c7f15a286ea3","83a22d322423603df713259b64b405a5d348a15e","1864c64d636ace5eab3d1b58a73586404ec1fbe2","e577063a5e07fef055d1dbb912a1530e6170c117","402ba103aeea0e3d4f746184ee20010c1f41f559","868ba94f0b43b34ced361f3425aad26e7bc92658","ee1176424c3957a9e0e533f81e36864bcabef039","0782007a61bcf36bc2e5ca67ba4fad21261d8d3f","a41179fc32c5f39da64a62ad822bdbbe318874ba","801416631e8d869861a38f3ee5f64730a08ee7e5","a36bf06747f817854d5c9a501470ae9ad6f7bdb4","fa86377d264fc977cbdcac5ea832b6dc61b7fd2c","0aa0006b2d598717cc607635d449ccae1fc93de9","285066352428a8684d47310a3c7380e722b831b2","33f5494f0a3d92a2b456bcbfd3c1f9c5c019264d","5beb49005add1b7c8e9c068313f21d3c47815f29","2f00432f2d81163da7b9f3ef5a30d75529dbf387","3793d5e6a5144ff9ecd79da8c528bae164d3cd92","ab38fc8ebce9575d43c73c2de4794022a5e94a05","43390087c3917b0e929fb85eaaed54f4a6a226ca","3c107f8e332724ded01f637921401e6672d36ff0","ec164770a671b23d2b0d3fcad8b75c2cbcf75661","caa58dcd05ccfb948f21482a924452cbe940cd8b"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Markers of oxidative stress after ablation of atrial fibrillation are associated with inflammation, delivered radiofrequency energy and early recurrence of atrial fibrillation","doi":"10.1007/s00392-011-0383-3","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00392-011-0383-3","venue":"Clinical Research in Cardiology"}

An efficient development of median & adaptive median filter is presented for removal of impulse noise mainly salt & pepper noise from digital Images. Performance measurement of mean square error (MSE) and peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) is done to compare these two filters. This paper proposes hardware implementation which is highly required for real time execution. Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) are widely used for real time processing where the requirements of time, speed, area, power become strict. The algorithms of these two filters are discussed in detail which is followed by FPGA based solutions. Simulation is done using Xilinx ISE 14.5 software of XILINX platform where the implementations utilize on Genesys VERTEX V FPGA Board of XC5VLX50T device family.","inCitations":["e7df66af856c767e3757139764cd8c8ce0c6bc29","cec3f40440cde4c6f6e6d86c6894f182448551e5","e5cb279370e755046880cecae6abef9fa863abfe","761f923d6aa7d463b02ed0c8da1acc0640cd27db","d3667a6f5a62b09fe1341474a6d615d17ebd5b13"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Reconfigurable architecture of adaptive median filter — An FPGA based approach for impulse noise suppression","doi":"10.1109/C3IT.2015.7060184","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/C3IT.2015.7060184","venue":"Proceedings of the 2015 Third International Conference on Computer, Communication, Control and Information Technology (C3IT)"}

We studied the invasion of P falciparum into abnormal RBCs from humans carrying the Southeast Asian ovalocytosis (SAO) trait. One particular parasite line, 3D7-A, invaded these cells efficiently, whereas all other lines studied invaded SAO RBCs to only about 20% of the extent of normal (non-SAO) cells. This result is consistent with the clinical observation that SAO individuals can experience high-density P falciparum infections and provides an explanation for previous discrepant results on invasion of SAO RBCs. Characterization of the invasion phenotype of 3D7-A revealed that efficient invasion of SAO RBCs was paralleled by relatively efficient invasion of normal RBCs treated with either neuraminidase, trypsin, or chymotrypsin and a novel capacity to invade normal RBCs treated sequentially with both neuraminidase and trypsin. Our results suggest that only parasites able to use some particular invasion pathways can invade SAO RBCs efficiently in culture.

These recommendations will be based on my research findings, and will also be characterized by my perspective as a current student at the University of Toronto’s iSchool. The project’s focus on student access to resources makes it well-suited to this year’s TRY Conference. My project began with research into the important issues currently facing reference services in academic libraries. Using this research as a starting point, I designed interviews and surveys for staff and students to target key themes, including what students don’t know about library services and why, what prevents students from accessing research help, and what obstacles staff face when delivering reference services. I am currently analyzing the interview and survey results, contrasting staff perceptions with student opinions to identify gaps in OISE’s current reference services. I will then use the research I have performed to generate recommendations for how OISE Library can work to close this service gap and begin providing enhanced reference services to students. This poster will present a summary of the project, including methodology, key findings, and recommendations. It will discuss how student use of reference services is closely linked to library space, lack of knowledge about library services, and a lack of clear communication between the library and the student community. Although the project results will be specific to OISE Library, they will indicate possible solutions that could be adopted by libraries in similar circumstances, and will highlight areas of future research in reference services.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Creating a New Reference Experience at the OISE Library","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

However, fundamental aspects of shock-produced planar microstructures in zircon remain poorly known, such as their deformation mechanisms, crystallographic orientations, and how planar microstructures visible at the grain scale by scanning electron microscopy correlate to microstructures visible at sub-micrometer scales by transmission electron microscopy and electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD). To unify observations of planar microstructures in zircon made at different scales into a consistent framework, we integrate the results of: (1) three-dimensional crystallographic modeling of planar microstructure orientations, with (2) 360° external prism backscattered electron imaging at the grain scale, and (3) polished section cathodoluminescence and EBSD analysis at the sub-micrometer scale for a suite of detrital shocked zircons eroded from the Vredefort Dome in South Africa. Our combined approach resulted in the documentation of seven planar microstructure orientations that can be correlated from grain to sub-micrometer scales of observation: (010), (100), (112), (11̄2), (1̄12), (1̄1̄2), and (011). All orientations of planar microstructures exhibit minor variations in style, however all are considered to be fractures; no amorphous ZrSiO4 lamellae were identified. We therefore favor the usage of “planar fracture” (PF) over “planar deformation feature” (PDF) for describing the observed planar microstructures in zircon based broadly on the nomenclature developed for shocked quartz. Some {112} PFs visible at the grain scale contain impact microtwins detectable by EBSD, and are the first report of polysynthetic twinning in zircon. The microtwins consist of parallel sets of thin lamellae of zircon oriented 65° about <110> and occur in multiple crosscutting {112} orientations within single grains. Curviplanar fractures and injected melt are additional impact-related microstructures associated with PF formation. Crosscutting relations of shock microstructures reveal the following chronology: (1) Early development of c-axis parallel PFs in (010) and (100) orientations; (2) the development of up to four {112} PFs, including some with microtwins; (3) the development of curviplanar fractures and the injection of impact derived melt; (4) the development of (011) PFs associated with compressional deformation; and (5) grain-scale non-discrete crystal plastic deformation. Experimental constraints for the onset of PFs, together with the absence of reidite, suggest formation conditions from 20 to 40 GPa for all of the planar microstructures described here.","inCitations":["b9a13ee6441274b3c6e5b93a2147d3723db68897","525ed416e556aa23e4e0c644cd92ef60c1239407","ff63f8f5b6b8054667fc64558d01da759fa66e20","e7d9caaf15390ed0dcc3cec8452a136dc42e1e91","9263a7c15a05d22a8d4ed9db38f407fb3d46e8ef","0ec5a82223f81123a1a76af0688f8c455b5c0d92","931144a79be76fcaf91d27ef85bb6e994d169279","a18cb2a1cf376f21512e878f3688dffa24b931e6","ccb322b286c4dea87a0591e9f6c781126ccee98b","2855568427de2d6212a5ff1c4a4fc7ba66115b74","c4eccf56776f6bb971de2a64bee5093f0049c509","f39e8765ddb3042b2348e6be2e8a9f47b8b0a144","bd3a3227519a944174e208e9e9886029f448e360","651f073c2622006fb43ac6894f43e30234244576","ea15f28dc9aec532c94fe7ebfd6845bf2330dbf2","fe4edd3a261599fd6707d0b752e1c788f36e36b6","e5cb882006dff4846d3f94ce26eb75aae73e4e3b","7d5fff38be0621827bb21b39b61110ba0769903d","52577491142aab1d9c3be90f2d14c711958cf8d6","0fce467c51187be72013e0f414df7452d6db293a","53c6a11308b5dd543682b5948eab6ee45c7450fb","8ed0e0d49821b1339dcd2e1557c5e0be1a002392"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.minsocam.org/msa/ammin/toc/Abstracts/2013_Abstracts/Jan13_Abstracts/Erickson_p53_13.pdf","http://www.geology.wisc.edu/~johnf/g777/AmMin/Erickson-2013.pdf"],"title":"Correlating planar microstructures in shocked zircon from the Vredefort Dome at multiple scales: Crystallographic modeling, external and internal imaging, and EBSD structural analysis","doi":"10.2138/am.2013.4165","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.2138/am.2013.4165","venue":""}

It is the final stage of the infection, caused by HIV. This deadly disease can be transmitted to a healthy individual through body fluids, placenta, tattooing, unprotected sexual intercourse, etc. It can spread accidentally or intentionally. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that around 34 million people in the world are living with HIV and 1.8 million died of AIDS-related illnesses worldwide in 2010. An increasing number of HIV infected people are being prosecuted for transmitting the virus to their sexual partner(s). As widely reported by sundry media houses, criminal journals, print media and above all in true light of the day there has been a deliberate endeavor or case of recklessness / intentional attempt to transmit virus to non infected Homo sapiens. The three categories of HIV transmission in the context of the law are intentional, reckless, and accidental. Intentional transmission is considered as the most serious form of criminal transmission and some of the individuals concerned have even been imprisoned. Some cases have reported individuals who have used needles or other implements to intentionally infect another individuals with HIV. While some have been established on HIV affirmative individuals who have had sexual relations with the primary intent of transmitting the virus to their partner. This review paper aims to focus on how HIV is being used as a bio-weapon and how transmission of the disease can be linked to the virus employing Phylogenetic Analysis. Thus, Phylogenetic analysis can be utilized as forensic evidence in criminal HIV transmission prosecution.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Hiv: a Weapon of Crime and Its Phylogenetic Analysis","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

O diagnostico precoce das uropatias reveste-se de especial importância devido a sua natureza progressiva e seu potencial de irreversibilidade. OBJETIVOS: Os objetivos desta tese consistem em uma analise mais abrangente sobre a abordagem cirurgica de pacientes com CAKUT (estudo1) e uma mais especifica que consiste em avaliar a evolucao de doenca renal cronica (DRC) moderada ou grave em pacientes com valvula de uretra posterior (VUP) (estudo 2). No primeiro estudo, foi desenvolvido um modelo de predicao para a necessidade de cirurgia em pacientes com CAKUT e, no segundo estudo, um modelo de predicao para evolucao para DRC moderada em pacientes com VUP. ESTUDO 1 - PACIENTES E METODOS: Estudo de coorte retrospectiva de 694 lactentes com CAKUT admitidos na unidade de nefrologia pediatrica do HC/UFMG de 1987 a 2013. O desfecho primario foi intervencao cirurgica. A idade mediana de admissao foi de 2 meses e 65% eram do sexo masculino. Considerando as caracteristicas do paciente a admissao: genero, idade, creatinina serica, ritmo de filtracao glomerular estimado RFGe, oligohidrâmnio, presenca de outras anomalias do trato urinario associadas com dilatacao da pelve renal (megaureter, megabexiga), lateralidade da dilatacao anteroposterior (DAP) da pelve renal (unilateral ou bilateral), presenca de lesoes renais na cintilografia estatica (DMSA), magnitude da dilatacao anteroposterior (DAP) da pelve renal e periodo de admissao (antes de 2000). Um modelo de predicao foi desenvolvido utilizando o modelo de taxas de falhas proporcionais de Cox e a selecao de backward. A validacao interna foi obtida atraves da tecnica de bootstrap. RESULTADOS: Um total de 164 pacientes (23%) foram submetidos a cirurgia com uma idade media de 7.8 meses. Os preditores inclusos no modelo foram RFGe, presenca de outras anormalidades associadas a DAP da pelve renal, presenca de lesoes renais no DMSA, a magnitude da DAP da pelve renal e o periodo de admissao. O otimismo do modelo foi de 0.84. CONCLUSAO: O nosso modelo de predicao para necessidade de cirurgia em pacientes com CAKUT pode contribuir para identificar pacientes de alto risco para intervencao cirurgica. Mais estudos serao necessarios para validar o modelo em amostras independentes de pacientes com CAKUT. ESTUDO 2 PACIENTES E METODOS: Neste estudo de coorte retrospectiva, 173 pacientes com VUP foram sistematicamente acompanhados na unidade de nefrologia pediatrica do HC/UFMG. Os desfechos primarios deste estudo foram DRC estagio 3 ou maior e DRC terminal. As covariaveis estudadas foram periodo de admissao (1970-1989 x 1990-2015), apresentacao clinica (pre-natal e pos-natal), presenca de refluxo vesicoureteral (RVU), lateralidade do RVU (unilateral ou bilateral), creatinina a admissao, RFGe a admissao, nadir de creatinina (menor valor da creatinina durante o primeiro ano apos a intervencao cirurgica), episodios de infeccao do trato urinario e intervencao cirurgica primaria. Duas variaveis tempo dependentes foram incluidas na analise: proteinuria e hipertensao arterial sistemica (HAS). A analise de sobrevida foi realizada atraves do modelo de taxas de falhas proporcionais de Cox com covariaveis tempo-dependentes. RESULTADOS: Depois de um tempo medio de 83 meses, 65 criancas desenvolveram (37.6%) desenvolveram DRC estagio 3 e 39% (22.5%) atingiram estagio 5. Quatorze pacientes evoluiram para obito durante o acompanhamento. Trinta e seis pacientes (20.8%) apresentaram HAS e 78 (45%) apresentaram proteinuria durante o acompanhamento. Apos o ajuste pelo modelo de Cox variavel dependente, creatinina a admissao, nadir de creatinina, hipertensao e proteinuria permaneceram como preditores independentes para DRC maior ou igual ao estagio 3 e DRC terminal. CONCLUSAO: Nossos achados sugerem que a identificacao precoce dos fatores de risco passiveis de intervencao clinica podem contribuir para amenizar a progressao da disfuncao renal.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Modelos de predição em anomalias congênitas dos rins e do trato urinário: necessidade de cirurgia e progressão para doença renal crônica","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

The membranes were characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) for its microstructure and surface pore size. A gas permeation method was also applied for determining and comparing the effective surface porosity and mean pore size of the different membranes. Moreover, the contact angle with water, critical entry pressure (CEP) of water and collapsing pressure of the PVDF hollow fibers were also determined. Five membrane modules were prepared using the spun hollow fibers and applied in removing 1,1,1-trichloroethane (TCA) from its aqueous solution by vacuum membrane distillation (VMD) process. The effects of dope composition and spinning conditions on hollow fiber morphology and TCA separation by VMD process are examined. Post-treating of the spun fibers by solvent exchange using ethanol produced membranes exhibiting higher porosity and higher permeability. A highly porous hollow fiber membrane with a smaller mean pore size can achieve both high TCA permeation flux and high separation factor. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The aim of this study was to evaluate sensitivity and specificity of digital panoramic radiography for detection of proximal caries compared with the bitewing radiography. Materials and Methods: One-hundred patients who had been ordered for taking both bitewing and panoramic radiography were included in this study. Panoramic and then bitewing radiographs were observed by a maxillofacial radiologist and interproximal caries were recorded. Sensitivity and specificity of digital panoramic radiography (CI=95%) was calculated compared with the bitewing radiography as a gold standard. Results: This study showed that the values for sensitivity and specificity were 62.7% (CI 95%=57.7%-67.5%) and 91.0% (CI 95%=89.2%-92.5%), respectively. Conclusion: Sensitivity of digital panoramic is less than bitewing radiography even with processing before printing. Therefore, bitewing radiography is superior for detection of inter proximal caries.","inCitations":["74e14d6389a02f512ce49c6315c00b545185fc9b","0c3daa68bf18bdb78d1679ef24dd88d0a6ea6d23"],"pdfUrls":["http://jdm.tums.ac.ir/files/site1/user_files_de744d/tums-A-10-25-79-01bca46.pdf","http://jdm.tums.ac.ir/article-1-79-fa.pdf","http://jdm.tums.ac.ir/article-1-79-en.pdf","http://jdm.tums.ac.ir/article-1-79-fa.pdf%20","http://jdm.tums.ac.ir/article-1-79-en.pdf%20"],"title":"Accuracy of Digital Panoramic in Detection of Interproximal Caries","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Emissions released were measured at the exit to the chamber using a gas analyser. The results show that the B15 blend generated the lowest emission with a 69% reduction in carbon monoxide (CO), 44% in oxide of nitrogen (NOX) and 34% in unburned hydrocarbon compared to conventional diesel fuel (CDF). However, the temperature profile for B15 is the lowest implying that the heat released is much lower than the other blends. Biodiesel blend of B5 showed the highest temperature profile besides diesel, which gave the highest temperatures.
