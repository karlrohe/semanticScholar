Digitalization paves the way for prosumers participation in energy market with the help of big data and distributed ledger technologies. Hence, power system is becoming more decentralized at distributed level, which consists of prosumers, consumers, and distributed energy resources-based microgrid systems. These microgrid participants require a transactive energy system for energy price signals-based smooth energy transactions among themselves. In this regard, this paper proposes a microgrid transactive energy system design and its functional layers. Blockchain-based transactive energy systems are also discussed.

However, the factors that influence farmers’ decisions to adopt innovations in underutilized crops are not well-documented. Underutilized crops like finger millet have been an alternative form of sustenance for resource-poor farmers especially in arid and semi-arid areas in Kenya. They are more nutritive and resilient to environmental extremes and harsh weather conditions than common crops like maize. The study presented sought to investigate factors that facilitate or impede the probability and level of use of different innovations (improved varieties, conservation tillage, integrated pest and weed management, and group marketing) on the production and marketing of these crops. A multi-stage sampling technique was used to survey 384 finger millet producers in Elgeyo-Marakwet County, Kenya. The study employed a multivariate probit to model simultaneously the interdependent adoption decisions of finger millet farmers and an ordered probit to determine the level of adoption. The results reveal that plot size, off/non-farm income, household credit, and extension contact positively influence the decision to adopt and the level of adoption. Technical training positively affects the level of adoption but negatively influences the probability of adopting some innovations. Awareness of these factors could allow the development of strategies, policies, and plans to increase the uptake and sustenance of agricultural innovations on the production and marketing of finger millet and could, consequently, contribute to the food security and incomes of finger millet farmers through enhanced productivity and marketing of the crop. \n \n Key words: Agricultural innovations, adoption, underutilized cereals, smallholders, Kenya.","inCitations":["363b6c18302fb04ebe46d9795074089d3242eec0"],"pdfUrls":["https://academicjournals.org/journal/AJAR/article-full-text-pdf/DBA74FB58423"],"title":"Factors affecting the adoption of agricultural innovations on underutilized cereals: The case of finger millet among smallholder farmers in Kenya","doi":"10.5897/AJAR2018.13357","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.5897/AJAR2018.13357","venue":""}

Using semi-structured interviews with 22 college students who misused prescription stimulants, we find that they draw on conventional middle-class beliefs (e.g., success and moderation) to make sense of their drug use. They do this by creating identities as people who are focused on success and use stimulants only as a tool to perform their best. They use excuses and justifications rooted in middle-class values to create symbolic boundaries between themselves (as legitimate users) and others (as hedonistic users). This allows them to persist with their illegal behaviors while maintaining an identity as conventional citizens.","inCitations":["0e93286c0951d5a8c73dd0725bf923d279dad77b","1fe63d8649e87ca68e595d733466cd65dd3c0527","57e0b989da732d6a1e5356f8baa7f33f97a3d144","c5f31b20553408d47f0fd8d036e45625fb017abf","400d08ed89f9f6eb6ed7dbdf556741ae9505068c","1a63772070fd8bf74aa2a56b5b2bc9aef1a948b5","b84dbc35e0e93b7bd046e06fd8bb8635e76c4277","740ee2d28b05e084147cd32089f77e6e9ef4576a","09feb74875e818e9033f7766ab6098c4701e0118","3e46847ad0ca9442255f66506f4f8300d94a54af","f006827cc08e1577a7398621e76b1034ea4ee8f1","9f15e3f3cd495b72c646739642effffcfd2e05de","1c412985ceb68abd9aa90a16a8ab9f4babe546e9"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Middle-Class Motives for Non-Medical Prescription Stimulant Use among College Students","doi":"10.1080/01639625.2014.951573","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1080/01639625.2014.951573","venue":""}

Previous research has documented concurrent associations between alcohol use and symptoms of anxiety and depression, but the dearth of longitudinal research, particularly for ethnic minority youth, raises questions about the replicability and causal direction of these effects. The goal of the present research was to clarify these issues, and investigate whether different facets of anxiety and depression are uniquely associated with alcohol use in adolescence.\n\n\nMETHOD\nThe present research examined cross-lagged relations between frequency of alcohol use and internalizing symptoms, using data from a longitudinal study of 674 Mexican-origin youth (50% female) assessed at ages 14 and 16.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAlcohol use at age 14 prospectively predicted increases in overall internalizing symptoms, and overall internalizing symptoms at age 14 prospectively predicted increases in alcohol use. Reciprocal effects were consistently found for the general distress and anxious arousal facets, but not for anhedonic depression and a scale measuring the cognitive aspects of anxiety.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe findings provide evidence of reciprocal relations between alcohol use and internalizing symptoms, but also highlight the danger of treating all symptoms of anxiety and depression as interchangeable components of a single broad domain. Instead, symptoms common to both anxiety and depressive disorders (e.g., general distress) have the most robust reciprocal relations with alcohol use. Thus, intervention programs aimed at reducing early alcohol use by Mexican-origin youth should target this component of the internalizing domain.","inCitations":["ae47817dd4e37e606e90597e3c003d57e6722bb4","2843a192ac2d273bb3abb792cd0049a042f4f1b6","990a77e2724968a9d9ac996886e633a3b82e61ea","a451e96ca8f233eb1cc6ff6a1921374384599846","29070f2358d63540b93d1582759745b67d9dd02b"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Reciprocal relations between internalizing symptoms and frequency of alcohol use: Findings from a longitudinal study of Mexican-origin youth.","doi":"10.1037/adb0000138","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1037/adb0000138","venue":"Psychology of addictive behaviors : journal of the Society of Psychologists in Addictive Behaviors"}

The pH of both tannins was adjusted to pH4 using a 33% solution of NaOH, then the two tannins were tested dynamically by TMA on a Mettler apparatus using a method already reported (Garcia, Pizzi, 1998). Small beach wood plies each of 0.6 mm thick and total dimensions of 21 · 6 · 1.4 mm were tested between 25 C–250 C using a heating rate of 10 C/min. and the exercising rate of fore cycle of 0.1/0.5 N on the specimen. Results and discussions The reactivity of A-ring of tannin has been recognized and well proven by former studies on tannin based adhesives. The TMA curve in Fig. 1 for Ann shows a series of peaks starting at lower temperature. The first peak at 94 C producing a moderate value of Young modulus (1500 M) is due to the formation of an entanglement network, due to the progressive loss of water from the tannins to the wood, and it is directly proportional to the concentration of the tannins solution. The second peak at 131 C is a peak of tannin autocondensation which gives the highest value of Young modulus (3050 Mpa), due to the further reactivity of a phloroglucinolic A-ring of Ann procyanidin. However, the TMA curves show a raise of another peak at a higher temperature of 217 C. This peak is due to the start of lower reactivity of catecholic B-rings of the tannins, which are more noticeable at higher curing temperature and which then participate in the process of the autocondensation of tannin nuclei and lead to a formation of another peak, as a result of the outocondensation of catecholic B-ring nuclei. The curve shows that the B-rings of catecholic tannin reactivate with the increase in the temperature of hardening and lead to a separation of the curve of MOE, after the A-ring nuclei were exhausting their reactivity by formation of the first peak and before the process of the degradation has reached its max. point, as shown in Fig. 1. The TMA curves for Pine tannin in the Fig. 1 is similar to that for Ann, but there are some major differences. The first peak for pine tannin appears at relatively higher temperature (107 C) than in Ann and gives a higher MOE value (3200 Mpa). This peak is followed by another one at 109 C with a much higher MOE value (3600 Mpa) both of these peaks can be considered as entanglement and autocondensation peaks respectively. The curve shows at higher temperature small peaks at 169 C, are due to the tannin degradation.","inCitations":["ef48c13decb2925e95001f3c16bb610c38285a0c","751d2baa4215e7cf4ef0c3a2a1293bf600b115c4","9f52f6e7231c8b4934c38101ff85802b8d046094","fba2650d98e94b9c563d724c7a4e7cbee4f556e1"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Comparison of gelling reaction effectiveness of procyanidin tannins for wood adhesives","doi":"10.1007/s00107-002-0289-x","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00107-002-0289-x","venue":"Holz als Roh- und Werkstoff"}

The test samples were characterized by X-ray power diffraction (XRD) and surface area determination, and compared for their catalytic activity towards H 2 O 2 decomposition using a constant pressure reactor (for 1.71% H 2 O 2 ) and a constant volume reactor (for 50% H 2 O 2 ). The catalysts prepared by thermal decomposition of KMnO 4 or NaMnO 4 ·H 2 O have shown the intermediate formation of potassium (or sodium) manganate, and its partial dissolution during washing with water; higher catalytic activity and larger surface area were observed for the decomposition products of KMnO 4 . The hydrothermal reduction yielded products exhibiting larger surface area and higher specific catalytic activity when carried out under stoichiometric conditions. Comparable kinetic parameters were determined using both catalytic reactors. Unsupported and alumina supported catalysts displayed comparable activity per gram of manganese.","inCitations":["b8834d7bde3387184e0673e9d7c3fa29dec34648","f3492344d8d97eca1daf077aeffda61136444e3d","e272503713c53e8a71bf3bae296dc6568bd318c7","b1be987ee4531992ac22aaf4d29f2efc5825c0c0","c50d1c8ecf2b8914e926bc4d505202faf48cf669","2b856154e2968cab54260da40d96893a0e7e1bec","072934afad5fa20a8bfe60096d91bf3f9e11bea8","23b7bb3d38fba00701fbd1dbeabd5cd3b9962f63","664ec9792be79255248cd1147bd850baba3fc03a"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Monopropellant decomposition catalysts: V.

The complex heterogeneous nature and large data dimensionality of unconventional mudstone reservoirs increase the challenge of lithofacies interpretation by conventional qualitative methods. Quantitative shale lithofacies, which are meaningful, mappable, and predictable at core, well log, and regional scales, can be defined based on mineralogy and Total Organic Carbon (TOC) derived from core analysis and advanced geochemical spectroscopy logs (e.g. Pulsed Neutron Spectroscopy, PNS). However, access to numerous and widespread core samples and geochemical log responses is typically limited by cost and time. We apply different mathematical techniques to ubiquitous conventional well log suites calibrated to rock types, defined by the limited number of wells with high-quality core and geochemical logs. The documented interrelationships between lithofacies and conventional logs are propagated with a quantified degree of accuracy in wells without advanced log or core data. Our study addresses issues of different approaches of quantitative lithofacies classification and prediction techniques from well logs. Various data-driven supervised and unsupervised computational approaches, such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Self-Organizing Map (SOM) and Multi-Resolution Graph-based Clustering (MRGC), are applied and compared to reduce uncertainty of propagating single-well based lithofacies analysis, and efficiently understand geological trends. Two different dataset from the Devonian Bakken and Mahantango-Marcellus Shale formations in North America are used, in order to undertake a comparative assessment of computational techniques for lithofacies characterization. Original shale lithofacies, defined from geochemical logs and core data, are used to compare the results of selected supervised and unsupervised computational approaches. The results show that both Bakken and Mahantango-Marcellus shale members are vertically and laterally heterogeneous, but can be classified into at least five mudstone lithofacies, along with calcareous siltstone and limestone lithofacies. SVM works better than other techniques for lithofacies classification and prediction in reduced computational time, no iteration, and with highly repeatable results. Accuracy of lithofacies prediction increases if the algorithms are supervised with geological rules.","inCitations":["28c2c2bac3c2d898f11025f6b9386008d7907e16","5a5778994471746f302cbdbd3c414a3220329411","6378eb5889f9a6fc72f4c433b67d354804f7e60a","20cb4222d66ec475cdcdb5827ca01ffbc65164b6","36ce9701b546a82b52d3c90b534076222e71bd14","a905e20e535b6c6e71653f4978ea6f39a4f11552","d901c4b2548bee72e0e34fef1439232edf275d6e","4ccf4bf134ddd0ffc579922443c153678715449a"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Comparison of supervised and unsupervised approaches for mudstone lithofacies classification: Case studies from the Bakken and Mahantango-Marcellus Shale, USA","doi":"10.1016/j.jngse.2016.04.055","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jngse.2016.04.055","venue":""}

For growth studies, E. faecium was inoculated into 10% RSM (reconstituted skim milk) and MRS both, incubated at 6.5 and 9 degrees C for 10 days and at 30, 42, and 45 degrees C for 48 h. Cells were enumerated after spread-plating onto MRS agar and incubating at 30 degrees C for 48 h. The ability of E. faecium cells to adhere to stainless-steel chips (6 by 6 by 1 mm, AISI 304, finish #4) was investigated. MRS broth containing stainless steel chips was inoculated to an initial concentration of 10(3) or 10(6) CFU/ml of E. faecium. Adherent cells were stained with acridine orange and enumerated by epifluorescence microscopy. E. faecium grew between 6.5 and 42 degrees C in MRS and between 9 and 40 degrees C in RSM. In MRS broth with 10(6) or 10(3) CFU/ml, the g (generation time) values were 0.62 and 0.42 h and R (growth rate) values were 1.6 and 2.4 h-1. Values of R = 2.3 h-1 and g = 0.43 h were determined for E. faecium growing in RSM with 10(3) CFU/ml. In MRS broth, for samples with a starting concentration of 10(6) cells per ml, adherence to stainless-steel chips was first observed at 2 h. However, adherence was first observed at 4 h in samples with an initial concentration of 10(3) cells per ml. After 10 h of exposure the number of adherent cells was similar for all samples regardless of initial inoculum. These results indicate that E. faecium readily adheres to stainless steel. It also underscores the need to control E. faecium by using appropriate low storage temperatures and adequate sanitizing practices in the dairy industry.","inCitations":["4e956e853e735df555aa19de4fd947d1600de7af","4106a47be3647370460b899f7d4588ba4511270f","989a65c3a8ba97ee5d64a4d0f55194f97d2eede7","82bcd3f510b2b236f3f4ce9a77f2e12afdcd752f","f668f5b37d1baa121e31aaf1ef41fca31e31ba62","a0d4eff01f7e53c84497507a4c3ca2113c471214","cfe7d7fbdc070c1938e0c0e58697c80b73358158"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Growth and adherence on stainless steel by Enterococcus faecium cells.","doi":"10.4315/0362-028X-61.11.1454","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.4315/0362-028X-61.11.1454","venue":"Journal of food protection"}

The servocontrolled gas inbleed system automatically regulates the flow of gas into the test region of the calibration system by maintaining a constant pressure on the upstream side of a molecular leak. Constant pressure on the molecular leak is established and maintained by a shunt control technique in which a gas inlet valve and a gas pumpout valve are operated in parallel. An analog computer was used to aid in the design of the system. The transient and steady-state response of the servocontrolled gas inbleed system is predicted by the computer. Good agreement was obtained between the analog computer data and the experimental performance data obtained from the gas inbleed system. The gas inbleed system can control the flow rate in the range from 0.00001 torr-liters/ sec to 0.001 torr-liters/sec. Other flow rates are obtainable by changing system components; however, the same design procedure is applicable.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://apps.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/669562.pdf","http://www.dtic.mil/get-tr-doc/pdf?AD=AD0669562"],"title":"Design and Development of a Servocontrolled Gas Inbleed System for a High Vacuum Calibration Chamber","doi":"10.21236/ad0669562","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.21236/ad0669562","venue":""}

However, the detailed molecular mechanisms of pathogenicity is still largely unclear. In this study, three different mRNA pool libraries were constructed from its developmental stage, early or late infection stage of the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, and then were investigated by the RNA-Seq approach. The results demonstrated that 1456 novel transcripts that had not linked to any annotated gene were identified, and 296 genes were found to undergo alternative splicing. Comparative analysis of three different libraries further showed that distinct transcriptional changes of pathogenicity genes were found. A large number of genes containing cell wall degrading enzymes, major facilitator superfamily genes and cytochrome P450 genes were highly induced during infection. In addition, several types of well-known effectors including RxLR, CRN, Elicitin and NLP proteins also showed high transcript abundances during infection.

Pesticides, pathogens and other stresses can cause oxidative damage in most organisms. The superoxide dismutase (SOD) family contains some of the most important enzymes in the antioxidant protection system of the fruit fly and other organisms.\n\n\nRESULTS\nFour full-length cDNA sequences encoding one MnSOD (BdSOD2-1) and three Cu-ZnSODs (BdSOD1-1, BdSOD1-2 and BdSOD1-3) were cloned. The expression profiles of these four genes under different stresses showed them to be involved in response to detrimental conditions including heavy metals, pesticides, extreme temperatures and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stresses. More specifically, the expression levels of these genes were found to be depressed in the presence of copper, zinc and manganese. The expression of all four SOD genes increased upon exposure to lead, cadmium, low temperature (0 °C) and LPS stresses. Only BdSOD1-3 transcription increased significantly at high temperature (40 °C) exposure. The expressions levels of BdSOD1-2 and BdSOD1-3 increased significantly in the presence of β-cypermethrin and malathion, but only the expression of BdSOD2-1 increased in the presence of avermectin treatment.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThese different expression profiles suggest that the four BdSODs play different roles and respond to different oxidative stresses in B. dorsalis. Some BdSODs undergo specific reaction in the response to specific oxidative stresses.","inCitations":["ff98f2d847d6e41c7fe76ac8fbe3920434d40a2d","7932b822452098fc223c68aa9390846a56cd4214","4c64a867985aaf528c623101aee34b1876d5dbfb","dad7e3893ce551aa632771b0e10bef85456e1ec6","b8b7ba82cc05fe252807632203edae624d11a857","9fe8454879c2e00a326fc2ae86bb3525e54f6d1a","1d57ab4652586a8ff4398e16d92875e7c1de37a7","ae349cc0cf7f06b3ad2a18feb0d8b78e0975d6f7","333261f34cd7798bf4b79d80c43fce93e6d02f72"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Involvement of superoxide dismutase in oxidative stress in the oriental fruit fly, Bactrocera dorsalis: molecular cloning and expression profiles.","doi":"10.1002/ps.3503","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1002/ps.3503","venue":"Pest management science"}

We have explored alternatives to silanization of the glass surface with the use of additives that either dynamically coat or adsorb to the glass surface. Polyethylene glycol, polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), and hydroxyethylcellulose (HEC) have been explored as potential dynamic coatings and epoxy (poly)dimethylacrylamide (EPDMA) evaluated as an adsorbed coating. By carrying out analysis of the PCR products generated under different conditions via microchip electrophoresis, we demonstrate that these coating agents adequately passivate the glass surface in a manner that prevents interference with the subsequent PCR process. While several of the agents tested allowed for PCR amplification of DNA in glass, the EPDMA was clearly superior with respect to ease of preparation. However, more efficient PCR (larger mass of amplified product) could be obtained by silanizing the glass surface.","inCitations":["fa34bf56e4e85bd1bb6ccdbb1c64d9c24c817e84","1d29e823104c677fed22b00d782f9cae2e561470","9888bace166b41a3791f4d065ec75a80e1f55026","d35ad80ab07de4ead78f3c5d7abb71a95283de48","0d0924800377127acc47fb586a1084d7f4bc301d","6ad637d584c216b7c131c35663873ab135890b53","d6e64e00a0fd04336c0d9b1204c14607613c729d","16c3fb7314fd7060d37d3fe1cda225689ac727f8","4166e509ed8b0a0f9191209a14e7954f0dbd53b6","4fae31c40d362d48470db3ae635434c15d02da6a","b06c286b558b7fed2d9ded12dde64f53b0ad5f39","aa8048167df7188e6f74756250f27152c347aaec","a7069690cad7aa95c622ddd6338c6dc04ffc12dc","2e78dc3d9b5f188fe29951c690ec52cbd6f775b5","5e64c88ff21ba4fbc5d89fba00e3a2d31b198be5","ddfc1b30f0f7b538ef19436766df0a20cadeb854","df411ac635869549f895d2925f259edc43790f76","d9ec20f7c3c9c49d2f58c204cbfa771018839781","d32d07e7cada5430c336d518d99fad4391c3c715","c06e43c9da0c5cf062c7d7a21c14ee92e1bb6f28","8519651870be0c65ab48958e283fcabfe6bad03d","e28b4d72d24ad7e99a17b11df771e9514b120d35","8e75c00bf5132129bc38fc3325e68659bea2e5b6","249f4be3d3315e4ac0fe3d592be2437e11f7afd2","5e5f895d126fea764c600f86f2d7aa6aca1516e9","02e7f82e7df31b1bd18f49c866b29f184b68ca30"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Towards dynamic coating of glass microchip chambers for amplifying DNA via the polymerase chain reaction.","doi":"10.1002/1522-2683(200101)22:2<334::AID-ELPS334>3.0.CO;2-O","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1002/1522-2683%28200101%2922%3A2%3C334%3A%3AAID-ELPS334%3E3.0.CO%3B2-O","venue":"Electrophoresis"}

Using institution-level data on 194 law schools from 2006 to 2015, this study investigates whether students are price sensitive to increasing costs. Incorporating two-way fixed effects models, results suggest that higher tuition and fee prices are not associated with fewer applications to law school. However, higher estimated net costs of attendance are associated with greater numbers of first-year enrollments, particularly among private schools. When stratified by tiers on the basis of selectivity, this positive relationship exists among law schools in the third and fourth tiers, yet no association between net costs and enrollments are observed among law schools in the first, second, and fifth tiers.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Dollars and Sense: Student Price Sensitivity to Law School Tuition","doi":"10.2139/ssrn.3216204","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3216204","venue":""}

This fact has become so apparent in their daily lives that the majority of Colombians manage to grow accustomed to social and political instability. Despite the lack of security, therefore, they lessened the emphasis placed on materialistic goods and allowed for the development of potmaterialistic values. According to political scientist Ronald Inglehart, the postmaterialistic state is one in which \"a growing emphasis on the quality of life and selfexpression is accompanied by a declining emphasis on traditional political, religious, moral and social norms\" (Inglehart 66). With this in mind, the fact that Colombians face increasing levels of poverty and political unrest leads many researchers to believe that the presence of postmaterialism without financial stability and personal security is unlikely. However, the demand for women’s rights and environmental conservation have taken on a greater role in shaping Colombian society, maintaining this belief therefore leads researchers to wrongly exclude Colombia from studies of postmaterialism. Citizens’ desire for environmentalism and women’s rights indicates the unlikelihood that the country is completely without postmaterialistic values. Therefore, researchers should use Colombia to study how various societal circumstances determine the degree to which postmaterialism plays a role in individual lives.

Most state statutes impose financial liability on the owner for the resulting injury; other laws label the nonhuman animal “dangerous.” What happens next frequently depends on whether the dog was “provoked.” This concept, found in the statutes of 41 states, requires humans to decipher what is going on in a dog’s mind. Not surprisingly, experts warn that this is a fool’s errand as it is often difficult for people to understand what other humans are thinking, “[a]dd another species to the mix and you have the potential for significant, even catastrophic, misunderstandings.”Researchers actually did not begin studying canine intelligence and emotions until about a decade ago. My interdisciplinary article reviews the empirical work being done in this nascent field of ethology (the study of cognitive ability of nonhuman animals), and concludes it does not support use of provocation as the test in dog bite statutes. The difficulty in deciding if a dog was provoked, and if so whether his response was “reasonable,” is exacerbated by the fact that there are approximately 4.5 million dog bites a year in the United States. The result is inconsistent, unpredictable verdicts that make it almost impossible for the responsible dog owner to figure out the rules and for the competent attorney to provide appropriate, helpful advice, whether his client is the owner or victim. The costs in continuing to ignore these problems are high in terms of lives lost and money spent. For example, between 2008 and 2010, one county in Florida euthanized 56 allegedly “dangerous” dogs. Insurance companies bear the brunt of the financial burden. Indeed, one third of all homeowners’ claims are dog bite cases. In 2015, the average individual payment was $37,329 and the total payout was close to an astonishing $570 million!Therefore, this article proposes a totally new approach and provides a uniform statute that moves the legal standard from the canine to the more appropriate locus - the owner and whether he properly trained and supervised his dog. This theory forms the foundation both for financial accountability under the civil liability portion of the uniform statute and criminal responsibility as part of the dangerous dog classification. Legislators and animal advocates who want to encourage adoption of this novel but simple solution will find the appendix, a comprehensive compilation of statutes containing the specific “provocation” language from each state, an invaluable tool to start the process.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://works.bepress.com/phyllis_coleman/13/download/","https://www.memphis.edu/law/documents/colemanpub_final.pdf"],"title":"We Say 'Tomato,' They Say 'Woof': The Argument for Abandoning 'Provocation' in Dog Bite Statutes","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

What began a decade ago in West German theatre circles as the somewhat heretical assertion that Brecht's plays were nothing more than a \"constant, liturgical repetition of what one already knows,\"' now stands as common dramaturgical parlance in the GDR as well. \"Brecht is dead,\" was the Nietzschean pronouncement of Hellmut Karasek in the Spiegel,3 to which the celebrated \"Brecht-Killer\"4 and heir apparent Heiner Miiller could only add that it was, in all due respect, a Vatermord (patricide).A And statistics would bear all this out. Whereas 1967 saw twenty separate new Brecht productions in the GDR,6 this number had dropped to eight in 1985, three of which were of The Threepenny Opera and two of The Rifles of Frau Carrar 7 not exactly the center of the classical Brechtian canon. If that is not enough, one need only cite the burial of \"bb\" as a classicist by the Brecht progeny in the Berliner Ensemble. \"Brecht's theatre works of the mature period,\" GDR critic Christoph Funke offers by way of historical explanation, \"make a tired-out, worn-down impression.

Like them, several have argued that paintings, for example, are mere re-presentations of and certainly not, to borrow a term from Kant, the “thing-in-itself.” From a Platonic and Rousseauian perspective, those who behold images and conclude that the “thing-in-itself” (on all occasions) and its rendition on canvas in sundry lines and colors are indistinguishable— indeed, they cannot be—would be led astray from the truth in pursuit of shadows, or worse still, would contribute to the moral collapse of the polis. Yet, that’s what I propose in this essay. More precisely, I want to reject Plato’s claim that art is imitation of what is. Like Parmenides before me, I argue that his heroic pursuit of the form of the Good depends on a set of unproven assumptions concealed in the cloak of an infinite regress. In the absence of such an unhypothetical first principle—and the cornerstone of the Republic—Plato’s lofty fortress collapses, and we are left to our Sisyphean tasks, yet hopeful in the power of our imaginations to set us free to pursue our self-appointed ends. Indeed, imagination’s province is the arts, now emancipated from mere imitation and free to lay claim to what is. To their company the twentieth century added the cinema, which soars from the Republic’s rubble and steads the identity-constructing enterprise in a manner without historical precedent, thus becoming a legitimate object of rational analysis regarding the “reminiscences of the suffering and . . . complaints” of the downtrodden.1 For reasons I will discuss below, professors","inCitations":["7762ec1d80fd0ae020bfdb918d29dfdb1f592bfe","064041b19998a1dc52004c0ad7c2dfb5620e5e72"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"An Interdisciplinary Proposal for Employing Film to Release the Imaginations of Preservice Teachers","doi":"10.1353/jae.0.0071","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1353/jae.0.0071","venue":""}

This paper presents a general overview of product life cycle assessment (LCA) and sustainable product packaging over the last four to five years. The review of life cycle assessment includes on overview of LCAs conducted over the last six to seven years for a wide variety of products. The application of the LCA methodology to the formulation of regulatory and public policies, especially in the USA and the Netherlands, and the outcome of the five-year national Japanese LCA initiative, are presented. The key issues and limitations confronting LCA, notably the role of weighting factors, are summarised. Some of these include the unequal treatment of qualitative and quantitative measures and the absence of a semantic ontology to unify the practice. Finally, the merits and shortcomings of a streamlined (abridged) (SLCA) are briefly reviewed. The review of sustainable product packaging is confined to the LCA of packaging systems and new, innovative environmentally-benign packaging materials, for example, biodegradable agricultural (compostable) polymers. The outcome of any packaging LCA should always be interpreted in light of the prevailing technology and the function of the packaging. Also discussed are the life cycle assessment of some packaging systems, new active or intelligent packaging materials, and initiatives across the manufacturing and service industry at dematerialising packaging. The ramifications of the landmark EU Directive on Packaging Waste 94/62/EU and its corresponding regulations in EU member states and some reasons for the varying degrees of success are presented. A more wide-ranging integrated approach, encompassing economic, social and environmental considerations, in conjunction with more efficient packaging designs, which economise on material and are recyclable, is the key to sustainable packaging.","inCitations":["f20deec3ab1197b3916dba0d81bda4981af853ad","ec61073e0a5712a5ce0192ef6974b8c161edc683","1eb55cd09d0ee5d6ff1d07b02aac55865a9a90c9","692af419d6fcdd529cec64f51dd8a2d751bd0a98","a32b052b47c083f7e765bc08a7c61cc95ee493fb","76d46a0925e60fffa337a7a202aeae956a827887","1e2e614d1cd29fd1d4b4c3e728f84a7c42535cdf","fffa53f316e2e76b34303f0651f2d47e068bd54e","6e19cc6f14b4d69c1b8ad91e28990f54afc5ec8c","8e67af645613c3f858fb5cf6956067294bcd3079","0a52c30a2ac8cfb0b178da0ea9b856001c464ecf","d1adf1db9f0a8281235ff9a58f9740e8594caf7a","79d835446503fcf8b7c724e3b69bcbc790b306bb","7bf6a3d13993d25d442fa1d46d786c3212c6d5c8","a09bed86bca41d2279b92f8c5e4225c20e1007e1","93dcdf136d8746e4066168d40a552296148e5cb2","9a5e04af7c8c13f238dac6b941251fd1a741dcf5","359bdc2aed66ae6fffae7d3c8944e1a3d53095cb","cb6333ae1d22c05c01d894e8e3c088e915b750eb","751fbb91326d702be01e6efa369f961ffe565ac5","92c271fa024239bb6cfa7d71e1ec1b827b49ced5","28b84a1537fd2b915beb948c65e67dbc3eb8dfd1","1d498442e502bb05b78d81638a4bfbdb2021b9ba","d65595a65b409af07fb3643cd079d2bcb892f0bd","6b27be84b51faa301a434d52b86f9f74c009a432","23dc690805fa9fb352440090ef79ff6ce761e537","913823c6909699266e88888e4ba8807b572c2610"],"pdfUrls":["https://d3pcsg2wjq9izr.cloudfront.net/files/6471/articles/6265/f121082911673415.pdf","https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Xun_Xu4/publication/228344850_Design_for_the_environment_life_cycle_assessment_and_sustainable_packaging_issues/links/00b7d5226837192c8c000000.pdf"],"title":"Design for the environment: life cycle assessment and sustainable packaging issues","doi":"10.1504/IJETM.2005.006505","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1504/IJETM.2005.006505","venue":""}

Here, we analysis structural variations (SVs) and mutational signatures via whole-genome sequencing of 168 GCs. Our data demonstrates diverse models of complex SVs operative in GC, which lead to high-level amplification of oncogenes. We find varying proportion of tandem-duplications (TDs) among individuals and identify 24 TD hotspots involving well-established cancer genes such as CCND1, ERBB2 and MYC. Specifically, we nominate a novel hotspot involving the super-enhancer of ZFP36L2 presents in approximately 10% GCs from different cohorts, the oncogenic role of which is further confirmed by experimental data. In addition, our data reveal a mutational signature, specifically occurring in noncoding region, significantly enriched in tumors with cadherin 1 mutations, and associated with poor prognoses. Collectively, our data suggest that TDs might serve as an important mechanism for cancer gene activation and provide a novel signature for stratification.Structural variations in gastric cancer impact progression. Here, the authors perform whole-genome sequencing on 168 gastric cancer patients and identified tandem-duplications of super-enhancer ZFP36L2 in 10% of gastric cancer, and mutational signatures in tumors with cadherin 1 mutations that associated with poor prognoses.","inCitations":["9024f207bab10fc43dedce98ad3b5bf2ee36fb93","0bc0abb2ad4ce40bed683541ca7462c40ef4413a","f853d50f1885b735c36747d6cedbed8f91df96ef","e43fb493667f72fe6e53d4c0706baa3b77d60ff4"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Whole-genome sequencing reveals novel tandem-duplication hotspots and a prognostic mutational signature in gastric cancer","doi":"10.1038/s41467-019-09644-6","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-09644-6","venue":"Nature Communications"}

It is reasonable to use the construction of the manipulator of similar type suggested below under the conditions with the rugged relief of the terrain and expanded service area. The problem of the research of manipulators with flexible links lies in the feedback effect of the lading dynamics on the links dynamics. The non-linearity of the kinematic structure of the manipulator expects the emergence of the feedback effects on the links in the dynamics which can exclude one or several links out of the structure (due to the flexibility of the construction). This makes difficult to use the purely analytical method of problem solving for simulation.

Left ventricular hypertrophy has been identified as an independent predictor of poor outcome after aortic valve replacement as a result of a combination of maladaptive myocardial changes and inadequate myocardial protection at the time of surgery. Glucose-insulin-potassium (GIK) is a potentially useful adjunct to myocardial protection. This study was designed to evaluate the effects of GIK infusion in patients undergoing aortic valve replacement surgery.\n\n\nMETHODS AND RESULTS\nPatients undergoing aortic valve replacement for aortic stenosis with evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy were randomly assigned to GIK or placebo. The trial was double-blind and conducted at a single center. The primary outcome was the incidence of low cardiac output syndrome. Left ventricular biopsies were analyzed to assess changes in 5' adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK), Akt phosphorylation, and protein O-linked β-N-acetylglucosamination (O-GlcNAcylation). Over a 4-year period, 217 patients were randomized (107 control, 110 GIK). GIK treatment was associated with a significant reduction in the incidence of low cardiac output state (odds ratio, 0.22; 95% confidence interval, 0.10 to 0.47; P=0.0001) and a significant reduction in inotrope use 6 to 12 hours postoperatively (odds ratio, 0.30; 95% confidence interval, 0.15 to 0.60; P=0.0007). These changes were associated with a substantial increase in AMPK and Akt phosphorylation and a significant increase in the O-GlcNAcylation of selected protein bands.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nPerioperative treatment with GIK was associated with a significant reduction in the incidence of low cardiac output state and the need for inotropic support. This benefit was associated with increased signaling protein phosphorylation and O-GlcNAcylation. Multicenter studies and late follow-up will determine whether routine use of GIK improves patient prognosis.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://circ.ahajournals.org/content/circulationaha/123/2/170.full.pdf?download=true","http://circ.ahajournals.org/content/circulationaha/123/2/170.full.pdf","http://circ.ahajournals.org/content/circulationaha/early/2011/01/03/CIRCULATIONAHA.110.945170.full.pdf?download=true"],"title":"Glucose-insulin-potassium reduces the incidence of low cardiac output episodes after aortic valve replacement for aortic stenosis in patients with left ventricular hypertrophy: results from the Hypertrophy, Insulin, Glucose, and Electrolytes (HINGE) trial.","doi":"10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.110.945170","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.110.945170","venue":"Circulation"}

The basis for increased nucleic acid oxidation in each of these conditions is presently unknown. Proteasome inhibition occurs in a host of neurodegenerative conditions and likely contributes to increased levels of oxidative damage and neurotoxicity. In the present study we demonstrate for the first time the ability of proteasome inhibition to increase the level of nucleic acid oxidation in primary neuron and astrocyte cultures. Administration of proteasome inhibitors (MG262, MG115) at concentrations that do not induce neuron death in the first 24 h of treatment, dramatically increase the levels of 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) and 8-hydroxyguanosine (8OHG) immunoreactivity in both cell types. Neurons underwent larger increases in nucleic acid oxidation compared to astrocyte cultures. While both DNA and RNA oxidation were observed following proteasome inhibition, RNA appeared to undergo a greater degree of oxidation than DNA. Both 18S and 28S ribosomal RNA were dramatically decreased following proteasome inhibition. Interestingly, an accumulation of unprocessed and/or cross-linked RNA species was observed following proteasome inhibition. Taken together, these data indicate the ability of proteasome inhibition to increase the levels of nucleic acid oxidation in both neurons and astrocytes, and suggest that proteasome inhibition may have deleterious effects on transcription and translation in both neurons and glia.","inCitations":["73c28b1fb81cbe0e4cbc18e1e74ba3eee3abe161","0bf4aa2a9696b4bc2f5b2dfe3f1c9f6dfdd24ca3","b918f59e3289ab4710ec666f5418a578470fc596","38306f1458942f126970db6952ffb75f8856bda3","70a94dc0fed56277ae68f1be2bbedfbc62a830c3","0bb7c86201391155de2050b96e4f977a39d98343","8a5d6f7afc1b0003ca44471a763a490369193be2","92c4d68b0602676c4c13d47d5080d6df9d44afee","1500cb8fc8d2abf4d8a29dba7dca6896d9c66663","511ce33d781d13620238166f77089f9d49652784","3d3fc3d3feff2f1eb5d87144215bde291b495bb0","a8a40a6a1f2d675f3277ba3cfa59b86e07eac664","5142b80d24b2e3a139340429fe9bc71ea7393ad0","d70c81637c016564198157c8c85ce418376d4903","b451260b1b2e158028c56c47e4af77dddcfc4d39","1aa4e7af02a45f3ff928de495e375987f82e77ac","da7d77eceacae808a8daecb9d5f12553c2b23a5e","e93e5ffc9b21ae2edb00e1e5d35bd6d5af12b5bc","8e160207d0e15492bf9d4644a0b1072732e36502","791fee140ee0e74f476c68bd9eb6720248438f53","509b8eaa16e0aeed92c107a58cb4cd504a4f9e68","989312c9a004cbbe5c8196094cb1df3bb5594b4b","157962341e757295e0f4e79fc20991f1efff1326","2f0995baa5a11905da3f607903599a5cc61cb419"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Proteasome inhibition increases DNA and RNA oxidation in astrocyte and neuron cultures.","doi":"10.1111/j.1471-4159.2004.02802.x","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1471-4159.2004.02802.x","venue":"Journal of neurochemistry"}

The results of the research are based on rigorous finite-difference time domain calculations. The resonance transmission peaks in the investigated wavelength range are produced as a result of the surface plasmon resonance collaborated with the localized waveguide resonance. The paper also gives a detailed analysis of the influence exerted by various factors: thickness, third-order susceptibility and line refractive index of the nonlinear medium filled in the gold slits arrays and the incident intensity to the transmission. It is found that the small changes of parameters such as medium thickness, third-order susceptibility and line refractive index of the nonlinear medium filled in the gold slits arrays as well as the incident intensity can bring great changes of lateral shift and magnitude variation of the transmission resonance peaks. The report proposes that these phenomena can be applied to designing precise optical switches.","inCitations":["67778a2a740ae90280f6f92c8c02ee8479c04ce8"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"The effect of the Kerr nonlinearity on the transmission through the nanoslit gold film","doi":"10.1007/s11433-009-0288-6","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11433-009-0288-6","venue":""}

These materials are designed exhibit enhanced properties, and at the same time are endowed with functional groups that control their interactions, and hence self-organization, into a variety of supramolecular architectures. Since most of the multifunctional materials are soluble, lithographic methods suitable for solutions are attracting increasing interest for the manufacturing of the new materials and their applications. The aim of this paper is to highlight some of the recent advances of solution-based fabrication of multifunctional materials. We explain and examine the principles, processes, materials, and limitations of this class of patterning techniques, which we term unconventional wet lithographies (UWLs). We describe their ability to yield patterns and structures whose feature sizes range from nanometers to micrometers. In the following sections, we focus our attention on micromolding in capillaries, lithographically controlled wetting, and grid-assisted deposition, the most used methods demonstrated to lead to fully operating devices.","inCitations":["636c15d5f88124cf94f834c100db52566bcf4981","a6f0442391263816ad56ff778d7d741e0d953e29","40a96751aea8ebff540619c9033a98befb2826cd","ace2b8cb001e619cd69df9890be81b7381da95fd","2958cca92b639720cf3696da753e9a0cac31acf7","58c2e9c7cec6c2f3f41cf78c136bf8ca3d50463f","f5ba6f49fe60e98884ae96bad4bae2e0e0c15712","c3e3e4eaa1569bd40e63e936dcbd351ba5bfe4cb","fe6cb53a42f882738a1d4d2a3e9e3d70fc35a85a","0788a000f7e7a6524d4fccf01ba355364a743e06","9892a6cd23c76693e2908b6c1ac1470ad36bc721","eb673251430e8d8e9e9583957accc828bc15c1d7","2e015e27b8bb657fc5c64a59b250adeae64f5b22","3e2ba5ecb6472e24a6f5ab1446948dfed37ca034","24c44fa63ce5110767e9081ec76fb1f3998ade67","52c9a0375e4537e83dc568cab107737ec2eafd99","6ba04ad4535c3076845d2512089566805bf16e2a"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Nanopatterning Soluble Multifunctional Materials by Unconventional Wet Lithography","doi":"10.1002/adma.200801979","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1002/adma.200801979","venue":""}
