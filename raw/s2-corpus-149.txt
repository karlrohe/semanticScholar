Sulphur application significantly increased dry matter accumulation/plant, leaf area index, crop growth rate and leaf area duration. Chlorophyll content of leaves of opium poppy increased while leaf sap pH reduced by S application. Increasing levels of S up to 150 kg/ ha enhanced growth of crop, whereas, chlorophyll content of leaves increased up to 200 kg/ha sulphur application. Among three sources of S, elemental S proved to be a better source than gypsum and gypsum + elemental S (1:1) in respect of growth in alkaline calcareous soils. Gypsum + elemental S (1:1) also resulted in highest chlorophyll content in leaves at 110-115 DAS. This study conclude that application of S @ 150 kg/ha through elemental sulphur can improve opium poppy plant growth and leaf chlorophyll content and can reduce leaf sap pH significantly.","inCitations":["1ec762a3633d7a52862eb58672690b12498d8cc5","08b9ac95c17ae5c526eea003c5cf1a64cafb2dd5"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Effect of sulphur fertilization on growth of opium poppy in calcareous soils of south Rajasthan","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Acceptance of elderly living-kidney donors remains controversial due to the higher incidence of comorbidity and greater risk of postoperative complications. The objective of this study was to evaluate the graft function and patient survival using kidneys from living-related and unrelated donors who were older than 65 years of age.\n\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nFrom December 2008 until December 2013 we compared the outcomes of 294 patients (mean age, 47.67 ± 12.4 years; range, 16 to 74 years old) who received grafts from donors ≥ 65 years old to 2339 patients who received grafts from donors who were younger than 65 years old.\n\n\nRESULTS\nWe observed no significant differences in sex, time on dialysis, or cold ischemia time between the groups. The recipient ages between two groups were similar. For survival analysis we used the Kaplan-Meier survival estimator. Patient survival at 1, 2, and 3 years was 91.1%, 89.1%, and 88.5%, respectively, for patients transplanted with kidneys from donors ≥ 65-years-old vs 96.7%, 95.9%, and 95.0%, respectively, in the <65-year-old donor group. Multivariate analysis showed the variables associated with patient survival to be donor age at time of transplantation in years (hazard ratio [HR], 1.65; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.59-1.71; P < .05), time on dialysis in months (HR, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.21-1.23; P = .002). Graft survival rates at 1, 2, and 3 years censored for death with functional graft at was 97.6%, 96.4%, and 94.1%, respectively, for patients transplanted with kidneys from donors older than 65 years vs 97.5%, 96.8%, and 95.2%, respectively, in the <65-year-old donor group. Multivariate analysis, HLA-DR mismatches (HR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.12-1.55; P = .050), delayed graft function (HR, 1.77; 95% CI, 1.53-2.07; P = .021), and perhaps acute rejection (HR 1.14; 95% CI, 0.82-1.95; P = .093) were the variables associated with graft survival.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nWe concluded that the use of kidneys from donors older than 65 years of age allows us to increase the rate of renal transplantation to approximately 15 to 20 per million population, with good graft and patient survivals provided that the protocol for expanded criteria organs ensured proper macroscopic and microscopic evaluation of the organ for transplantation.","inCitations":["d3948418d35f3c72c55e8ba205f8c9a6e0b887a7","aa41467439b0dfb3ba18546aa426d9e4ecb3be1e","17fe255d002e30e82a01fa5e6cdaeebd2e525895","28c4376def85919e05cac9c5266215b9a9048cbe","c9970b5f58fcd97ae2f6926bedec38b5ce0dfb3e","70351694f5fd8286a68937cc8775c55b55aa90b0"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Kidney Transplantation From Elderly Donor.","doi":"10.1016/j.transproceed.2015.04.015","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.transproceed.2015.04.015","venue":"Transplantation proceedings"}

I model this using a social dilemma game with publicly observed sequential actions and asymmetric information about pay offs. I find that some informed agents in this model act, individually and without collusion, to conceal the privately optimal action. Because the privately optimal action is socially costly the behavior of informed agents can lead to a Pareto improvement in a social dilemma. In my model I show that it is possible to get cooperative behavior if information is restricted to a small but non-zero proportion of the population. Moreover, such cooperative behavior occurs in a finite setting where it is public knowledge which agent will act last. The proportion of cooperative agents within the population can be made arbitrarily close to 1 by increasing the finite number of agents playing the game. Finally, I show that under a broad set of conditions that it is a Pareto improvement on a corner value, in the ex-ante welfare sense, for an interior proportion of the population to be informed.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://www.econ.ed.ac.uk/papers/id206_esedps.pdf","https://www.research.ed.ac.uk/portal/files/20029237/best_2011_social_learning_social_dilemma.pdf","http://repo.sire.ac.uk/bitstream/handle/10943/289/SIRE_DP_2011_44.pdf?isAllowed=y&sequence=1"],"title":"When Do We Learn to Cooperate?

To understand the breakage behavior due to the insertion and deinsertion of lithium into the active materials, the effect of surface mechanics and the insertion-induced deformation is examined within the theory of linear elasticity. An approach is presented whereby the average size of the fragment pieces due to the insertion of lithium into a spherical particle is governed by the equilibrium of the system energies before and after the breakage, in which the contribution of the insertion-induced deformation to both the total stored strain energy and the total surface energy is included in the calculation of free energy. The ratio of the average size of the fragment pieces to the radius of the spherical particle is relatively independent of the particle size in the range of millimeter to micrometer, and the ratio is a function of ma...","inCitations":["95d191e0203e3199d3d86adbb284dbf5bafc5880","822e4663286522c956aa4b3f985007d4b6f831cf","386df279d19b8a4cef9781ab49de9ba09007b5c6","b75a67f9e60cb147ba6fa25fb8682029f4b6a05b"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Insertion-induced breakage of materials","doi":"10.1063/1.3486512","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1063/1.3486512","venue":""}

However, traditional VSG control will lead to current unbalance and power oscillations under unbalanced conditions. Aiming at these problems, an improved comprehensive control strategy of VSG is proposed based on the traditional VSG control method with voltage and current inner loops. By analyzing the relationship among unbalanced current, power oscillation and negative sequence current, the reference currents under different control targets are obtained. On this basis, the comprehensive control of power fluctuation and current quality is realized by the idea of weighted control. Moreover, the proposed control strategy does not change the voltage source properties of VSG, providing voltage and frequency support for the system, and improving the ability of VSG with unbalanced load under islanded conditions. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy.","inCitations":["6e10e90fb033a622cb50ae675ede3e77752f61f8"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"An Improved Control Strategy of Virtual Synchronous Generator under Unbalanced Conditions","doi":"10.1109/spec.2018.8636005","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/spec.2018.8636005","venue":"2018 IEEE 4th Southern Power Electronics Conference (SPEC)"}

The task is further complicated by the presence of hardware-induced noise, geometric distortions, and intensity non-uniformities (bias field), as well as motion artifacts resulting from patient movement during image acquisition.  This paper presents a new algorithm for denoising dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MR images, called dynamic nonlocal means. It is a variation of the nonlocal means (NLM) algorithm. DNLM exploits the redundancy of information in the temporal sequence of images. We also perform the qualitative and quantitative results which suggest that the DNLM algorithm is more effective in attenuating noise ria � a ��U�oHhow that histogram quadratic distance measure produced more accurate results for image retrieval as compared to other distance measures. liedE � ht��U�oH) convolutional codes and compared with the (2,1,7) convolutional codes. The proposed interleaver is applied to different bits stream lengths of 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, and 16384 bits. The simulation results show the superiority of the proposed chaotic interleaved convolutional codes scheme over the traditional schemes in the image transmission over the mobile channels with respect the shorter constraint length of the encoder. Also, the chaotic interleaver performs better with the packet length increasing. The chaotic interleaver enhances the security with the different secret key for every transmitted packet. The computer simulations are carried out using the widely accepted Jakes’ model. The results reveal that the proposed scenarios can be applied to the long bit stream packets technologies such as Wimax.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"A Novel Variation on Non Local Means Algorithm for Denoising of Contrast-Enhanced MR Images","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Having said that, I have to admit that I am not entirely comfortable with the seemingly free use of arbitrary relationships to represent the coupling between C, N and P cycles. Sure, currently there are many knowledge gaps in how the three fundamental cycles are coupled together, but the authors could have helped their case by presenting their rationales for the quantitative relationships used in their model. For example, what are the bases for the formulations of the N-limiting and P-limiting factors to NPP? Are these factors needed because NPP is not simulated? What exactly is the role of the NPP of Randerson et al. (1997) in this study? Why do you need both the leaf nutrient concentration limitation and the soil uptake limitation? What are the bases for the formulations of the plant N and P uptake?","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://www.biogeosciences-discuss.net/6/C4316/2010/bgd-6-C4316-2010.pdf","https://www.biogeosciences-discuss.net/6/C3237/2009/bgd-6-C3237-2009-print.pdf","https://www.biogeosciences-discuss.net/6/C4299/2010/bgd-6-C4299-2010.pdf","https://www.biogeosciences-discuss.net/6/C3237/2009/bgd-6-C3237-2009.pdf","https://www.biogeosciences-discuss.net/6/C4305/2010/bgd-6-C4305-2010-print.pdf","https://www.biogeosciences-discuss.net/6/C4316/2010/bgd-6-C4316-2010-print.pdf","https://www.biogeosciences-discuss.net/6/C3433/2009/bgd-6-C3433-2009.pdf","https://www.biogeosciences-discuss.net/6/C4299/2010/bgd-6-C4299-2010-print.pdf","https://www.biogeosciences-discuss.net/6/C3340/2009/bgd-6-C3340-2009-print.pdf","https://www.biogeosciences-discuss.net/6/C3433/2009/bgd-6-C3433-2009-print.pdf","https://www.biogeosciences-discuss.net/6/C4305/2010/bgd-6-C4305-2010.pdf"],"title":"Interactive comment on “ A global model of carbon , nitrogen and phosphorus cycles for the terrestrial biosphere ” by Y","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

A typical member of the class is generated as follows. Let X be the feasible set, and x the optimal (noninteger) solution to the linear program associated with an integer program in n-space. Consider a unit hypercube containing x, whose vertices are integer, and the hypersphere circumscribing the cube. This hypersphere is intersected in n independent points by the n halflines originating at x and containing the n edges of X adjacent to x (if x is degenerate, X is replaced by X′ ⊃ X having exactly n edges adjacent to x). The hyperplane through these n points of intersection defines a valid cut, the (spherical) intersection cut. The paper gives a simple formula for finding the equation of the hyperplane, discusses some ways of strengthening the cut, proposes an algorithm, and gives a finiteness proof.

We hypothesised that circulating B-lymphocytes may be useful biomarkers of tuberculosis (TB) infection status in highly TB-endemic settings. Ex-vivo and in-vitro mycobacteria-specific B-cell ELISPOT assays were used to examine the plasmablast (PB) and memory B-cell (MBC) responses in the peripheral blood of adult, healthy, community controls (n = 151) and of active TB patients (n = 48) living in Uganda. Frequencies of mycobacteria-specific PBs were markedly higher in active TB patients compared to healthy controls, and, conversely, MBCs were markedly higher in the healthy controls compared to active TB patients. In addition, the community controls with evidence of latent TB infection had higher peripheral blood PB and MBC responses than those without evidence of TB infection. These data demonstrate that peripheral blood B-cell responses are differentially modulated during latent and active M. tuberculosis infection, and suggest that the PB to MBC ratio may be a useful biomarker of TB infection activity.","inCitations":["5698573d7b07868a76fbf1887ce908eed78eeb8b","01474ddda00608a6805d4c522fb39b2b65b1531c","4f7dec839afb71dddbdd457def607980608b1f6e","f79ae878f7b80137dc506ff719016ec4398a43db","ae7e5dd6e0667277482ac655f7a5070e7c05135b","94c2a4794dd848211b4b45dc9ece92cf8e997190","88a05f3e60139533bfa96d3987072f6b9663f80b","eb94fa45022736017ac6a5c1022602f070709b3c","7251cbcffbac3fca2394b2a25ed35f2c7143398b","9edfd8febf6612210d7a7246ba352b9912f755b3","9ba5cf9145e29b9a94bdd370b3212b02a4422fbe","ff7d5d3e54143f44284755521f2164b2f5c21b50","0e646e6415c0d8b87be0ef20066ac0ce465cdb86","16fff554002adeb240d5dcd65a772a6338840fa8","fde1e1ce33acb9a3253b871b75f0de6b7135c509","50aec6c7da799a2548a4d5a46536075b56c2a82a","e4a189d6dad128f9bfe29ec9afc411a5e10a0bbd"],"pdfUrls":["https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/13111686.pdf","http://researchonline.lshtm.ac.uk/1917897/1/pone.0106796.pdf","http://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/pmc/b3/86/pone.0106796.PMC4156407.pdf"],"title":"Circulating B-Lymphocytes as Potential Biomarkers of Tuberculosis Infection Activity","doi":"10.1371/journal.pone.0106796","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0106796","venue":"PloS one"}

The older and therefore valid name for the known species is reintroduced as O. claneophila (Duclos, 1835), status and repository of type material is given, types are redescribed and figured and the new species O. matanzana is described.

Overall survival has improved due to earlier detection, better therapies, and improved posttreatment surveillance. Permanent sequelae of the tumor and its treatment may cause severe impairment and decreased quality of life (QoL). Pediatric primary brain tumor patients' vision can be severely affected, even when the tumor location does not primarily involve the visual pathway. Visual dysfunction and impaired vision-related QoL may not be detected or screened for in children with primary brain tumors for many reasons, including examination difficulty and lack of awareness. The authors review the ophthalmic presenting symptoms, effects on vision, and quality of life in pediatric patients with primary brain tumors. They also describe and emphasize the importance of systematic neuro-ophthalmologic examinations in this population, which may improve long-term visual and QoL outcomes through earlier interventions.","inCitations":["de25bb98b2752326d63141b1e36d806395030184","4e5a43399c60cb621d75957d7bbaae300356f2b9","4445c6d58364b4856f716027c187f67b1539e357","f9b6537e8c485dcfbf01af28b6548a59dacbcf7f","a59c4062ddb677e8bf962c1b8cf567e8ba6294c6","e13a89ff1350977afa8a81e8edc5825bf6bd32d0"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"The Effects of Primary Brain Tumors on Vision and Quality of Life in Pediatric Patients.","doi":"10.1055/s-0035-1563571","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0035-1563571","venue":"Seminars in neurology"}

Participants in the study were 36 children with ADHD and 43 nonreferred comparison children ages 7 to 11. The participants listened to 1 of 2 folktales and recalled the story both before and after studying a written version of the story for up to 10 min. The stories had been divided into individual events, and each event was coded for the number of causal connections it had to other story events. Each event was presented on a separate page of the study booklet so that time spent on each event could be recorded. All of the transcribed recalls were coded for which story events the participant correctly recalled. For both groups, recall increased as the number of causal connections increased, but the effect of the number of causal connections on recall was stronger for comparison children than for children with ADHD. The results revealed no group differences in studying behavior. However, when recall before studying was included as a predictor of recall after studying, studying was found to be more effective for higher IQ comparison children than for higher IQ children with ADHD, especially at the highest levels of causal connections. The results offer important leads for the development of academic interventions that are specific to the story-comprehension deficits of children with ADHD.","inCitations":["35752354c7814190f076a108edf21513bce9ccb3","403b8aa4d087a5082904d5841ec33461b4a69fda","e49d7428a4cefa36d5ec6d88ac3d3aacc46fb09e","d74efe759eb36571df11814a3af90108f320ca4d","2f3dced434577c4b86033aa375f6a75931055c2b","3b87c9dbe9fc714228eb330b9c11e51cad71fb47","67bb4fce608eac58aacd0d65de619af3d5a07ce6","4ae4bcfb09609a81fd300c0547c9e545dbd7ff35","8557060988264420a8cd0fe27f6dd1c153130994","aeae1c5b89154a5e0a3197dc9bd7131e9770eb8c","504f064a5e4be26a1ac720a4a2935f4684ab25e3","27cda6cd36855fb805ce2a54858d2858b02060ad","15a68b7f7931d5120abe06e1804345a4d381619d","321a0df49e7a2a48e98763025553f5979b230426","ed2e7f269f6e47150e845ca1c6d79d4f6f742906","c344efaf6f5b6ba22ec96bdd5158e2faeeb06554"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Story Comprehension and the Impact of Studying on Recall in Children With Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder","doi":"10.1207/s15374424jccp3303_8","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1207/s15374424jccp3303_8","venue":"Journal of clinical child and adolescent psychology : the official journal for the Society of Clinical Child and Adolescent Psychology, American Psychological Association, Division 53"}

Here we link these traits by showing that when a wild-type chromosome 10 was returned to any of three human glioblastoma cell lines U251, U87, or LG11, they lost their ability to form tumors in nude mice and switched to an antiangiogenic phenotype, as measured by the inhibition of capillary endothelial cell migration and of corneal neovascularization. This change in angiogenesis was directly due to the increased secretion of a potent inhibitor of angiogenesis, thrombospondin-1, because: (a) neutralizing thrombospondin completely relieved the inhibition; (b) the inhibitory activity of thrombospondin was not dependent on transforming growth factor beta; and (c) chromosome 10 introduction did not alter secreted inducing activity. The inducing activity was dependent on vascular endothelial cell growth factor and had an ED50 of 10 microg/ml in media conditioned by parental cells and 9-13 microg/ml in media conditioned by chromosome 10 revertants. Normal human astrocytes were also antiangiogenic due to secreted thrombospondin. The effect of chromosome 10 on thrombospondin production in vitro was reflected in patient material. Normal brain and lower grade astrocytomas known to retain chromosome 10 stained strongly for thrombospondin, but 12 of 13 glioblastomas, the majority of which lose chromosome 10, did not. These data indicate that the loss of tumor suppressors on chromosome 10 contributes to the aggressive malignancy of glioblastomas in part by releasing constraints on angiogenesis that are maintained by thrombospondin in lower grade tumors.","inCitations":["e6c0ac4667fcc933abc768a6b2595f7efd7e8cdb","2da9237ec1363a27787a26e69a6fe25e77e8d526","aee7e9554fcd91c7fa97f92a5191a417bc1074e0","59d7fb0cf2243e7a28a1f31d7c0667079a14a1c2","573fe5ca45df5bc183ce426c44a25677595b2a3f","8b0535a3e969567c6dd43cb720e01984ae1f20ce","fe2625c5877d35090089e5318b42b778e00e2854","8b427521265fdd3608d9584e116b017c9356bea9","fc9ed62b5560cc6ffe961eba52cd67235c24b2f4","71cc5674abd946817320c38a2b6faebb9217431a","1c643a0f47dce01122b606b0cc9ec661b07db9cf","f65fd1bbde377f0e0aabc68ea344326e85980660","ffac7252cffce925cea46817e5d415eeda45a9da","019a65ea04e4158b3c1c3a554ed9e984d946eb96","36707c2b23581e314f310991fb994ada8e8c1234","3be31cd14673163e724fc70262a5155f71905e23","17bc24079f58adaebefcd4805b4b17eba443dffa","2d1af4d9d9ecb5148672cbf5018abf39f77aee05","1822593821d9e996374e84f209cb64baa5c808fa","202849ec60540d60a2a13053c271c65ed855d001","d7ca9e9afaaca7613fd362f1d3b9021d5f460004","c0011442cbff5d8208200d50bd55667c0eb38ed8","32e9f04eab03243f7a64140d7d9eef30d2eb9df8","d9666c8ae56992d983ffb3512391dd3ca0edc77d","c5f30ff0072ab25e2bf12df7a725e4cef78b751d","bd0ce24b4bee80a19a6a056c9b55f0b888745474","6ea24da980451e8a8a392a400a59be78812af9dc","48e5ee087fd5b81ca0787bd66e1878a3c0626a52","4c8d10215e9a2d864ace3090949accd7c79c6121","73b0d286926fb9f34a33365ca709bf6fe417393d","54c17510baacfc461efbd3ffb88aa8155d322735","09e7900c20b1515e40a5fef42d7ee4550dda79d3","9049cb457577eb3e35e62c8d00ca636db8f4fda3","8009857c0228ef01bd71974312b466c19d5fefd9","ae4625a0b741c1c9fefcd50e26138f9c8a3b50dd","7b412800e3b5f83607e5c0d7c5efde3d8f959ddf","384ba53e7a74358aeedb72bd8620352f072a4232","814511895e260319027a91250fb9ab675fba1eb9","58b8c59e14ab42b6c40183f3dbcfed7a8f2df6d9","9d997de0fae535f17b9375a4217476a64c295ef8","0738724f46700da2f82c99d312ecbedffae271d0","9b620bf0c79673eb6a6ed3ecf434669dc9c20f7d","d9889cdcafb03b52115138c363e88c5e00e75186","e3dec706e9ba4e89d4349026c467f3044104ccce","6a43e6812f4fd5fe993f6d42af5bb2cd92c86e53","dea31a7aa4e3b4a2afd9d1971d87162a74cb4834","436ed741429e60b7cc1c84d9c9b969139ca36106","a3fea89be9c6e966069af40e12b2c00f9b56c00d","fc35ad8bd6b30f57742e10bc8f99a51481ffdcd9","9c40a51e24955ef96095917f137fcf6fe20bba06","c4db81e6a2d45851c7f62cb1856bf4650a938d4c","8b3a92e774c732278255861638885c0a76c9c459","29d0a6a291cfd0ac57fc3a4ae6b8c4e332b214c3","d7d83659455357240830f15365ee58b02b1ca050","ae5f4bd73931aed55ee2b335ac1ddb5d77cad8b3","934b198a4052691c5bece8cb19336d47e8701555","0162021ee44872ac692c0f316d8d0b42a099588c","452d017eade34e32b5ee7f8b0474744f2b71feca","1068e828b985f7aca85538d83b7e9f85730d6129","4dcf5bcafa8c260d31b2060278c87d23a6bbc5e5","2df6d57f9b93c36c8e59b5fae3fe571c2a3622e1","81fcdfe598983888b27772ac148e83c399d01267","fb752acc5889ffbc32c457cb1d60e2082050f880","f645a3f1a6e9d43fccf2ad5ba12f444fe87806bc"],"pdfUrls":["http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/canres/56/24/5684.full.pdf"],"title":"Inhibition of angiogenesis in human glioblastomas by chromosome 10 induction of thrombospondin-1.","doi":"","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"Cancer research"}

The chapter explores the induction of fever following injection of bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), which was the first example of neuroimmunmodulation, since it was early shown that LPS not only apparently induced fever on its own, but also released an endogenous pyrogen that circulated to the brain and induced fever. Because of the high potency of cytokines, the amounts circulating in the blood after LPS were too small to isolate to determine the structure of these compounds. The structure of many of them has been revealed and it is now apparent that endogenous pyrogen was at least in part interleukin-1 (IL-1). The understanding of the mechanism of action of cytokines to alter hypothalamic-pituitary function was also made possible by discovery of the many classic transmitters and hypothalamic peptides that control the release of the various pituitary hormones from the anterior lobe of the pituitary gland.","inCitations":["806e740766f84bd10a75bed91f2c544f8e0e00d4","9883c0ecb6c495e615f722ca8012f24a024396ea","0f3296fed4729f4f3976289cc6e9d3549cd12c92","803eaf938accf8ddd7840422dcde7e6327ea1e1f","09b0a30b2ea9c62f690696f815e6415960a95cf9","b6594d932f82b63fadecbc85d4d5215231aa3e7c","1f324d911d1bde38158fc4c37b57c58f464ae95e"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Cytokines and pituitary hormone secretion.","doi":"10.1016/S0083-6729(01)63002-4","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/S0083-6729%2801%2963002-4","venue":"Vitamins and hormones"}

They are composed of densely staining tissue with small isodiametric cells and reduced intercellular spaces. The nectaries of D. quercifolia and A. coronans occur as patches of tissue on the leaf blade. In contrast, the nectaries of D. rigidula and A. acuminata are stand-alone structures.

The discussions on assessment fluctuate between two intellectual extremes: objectified selection or educational diagnosis. In Japan, many teachers make written comments on school report cards with ambiguous expressions to avoid negatively motivating their students. German school report cards, on the other hand, are objective, but may cause pressure through their focus on marks. An analysis of examples of German and Japanese report cards reveals that Japanese report cards give priority to educational diagnosis while German report cards focus on objective selection. It depends on the culture and, in particular, cultural barriers as to which dimension is given priority. A cultural barrier is unique to people of the same cultural group. Japanese cultural barriers are characterised by concern for others’ emotions and as such they prefer to use indirect communication. German cultural barriers, in contrast, are characterised by honesty which makes it difficult to report anything but the truth. Therefore, it can be difficult for Germans to flatter by distorting the truth.

Moreover, the interatomic potentials of L10 phase, L12 phase and DO22 phase changing with temperature and concentrations were computed through utilizing the interatomic potentials equations induced by Khachaturyan’s relational equations between the interatomic potentials and the long-range order (LRO) parameters. Results match preceding work and demonstrate that the phase precipitation sequence of Ni75Al10Cr15 alloy is the disordered phase → L10 pre-precipitation phase → L12 equilibrium phase → L12+DO22 equilibrium phase. Free energies of L10 pre-precipitation phase are higher and interatomic potentials are smaller than those of L12 equilibrium phase; therefore, it is concluded that L10 phase is unstable, and phase transformation would occur to L12 which is more stable; L12 phase precipitates earlier than DO22 phase because L12’s interaction potentials are larger than DO22’s.","inCitations":["4a6caae5e3b03137cdf3dfc64133122525ffa7d5","9f4f45cda0fd57edda912f798a39979ef3421975"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Energy studies of precipitation sequence in Ni75Al10Cr15 alloy based on the phase field theory","doi":"10.1007/s11433-011-4306-0","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11433-011-4306-0","venue":""}

Secondary extracellular products of dependent E. coli were valine and lactic acid; the former was produced in the presence of antibiotic under aerobic conditions, and the latter metabolite was formed under conditions of either antibiotic depletion or oxygen deprivation. The fact that the same products were formed when either streptomycin or oxygen was limiting supports the hypothesis that the antibiotic is required to complete hydrogen transport in dependent E. coli. The formation of valine appears to represent an anomalous pathway of aerobic glucose catabolism, whereby a neutral, relatively highly reduced end product is excreted.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Formation of Valine by Streptomycin-dependent Escherichia Coli.","doi":"10.1128/jb.88.4.1006-1009.1964","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1128/jb.88.4.1006-1009.1964","venue":"Journal of bacteriology"}

An innovative organic-silica hybrid monolithic capillary with bifunctional groups (amino and cyano) was developed and evaluated as an extraction device for in-tube SPME. The morphological and structural aspects of the monolithic phase were evaluated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), nitrogen sorption experiments, X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses, and adsorption experiments. In-tube SPME-MS/MS conditions were established to remove matrix, enrich analytes (monolithic capillary) and improve the sensitivity of the MS/MS system. The proposed method was linear from 45 to 360 ng mL-1 for alanine, from 15 to 300 ng mL-1 for leucine and isoleucine, from 12 to 102 ng mL-1 for methionine, from 10 to 102 ng mL-1 for tyrosine, from 9 to 96 ng mL-1 for tryptophan, from 12 to 210 ng mL-1 for serine, from 12 to 90 ng mL-1 for glutamic acid, from 12 to 102 ng mL-1 for lysine, and from 6 to 36 ng mL-1 for aspartic acid. The precision of intra-assays and inter-assays presented CV values ranged from 1.6% to 14.0%. The accuracy of intra-assays and inter-assays presented RSE values from -11.0% to 13.8%, with the exception of the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) values. The in-tube SPME-MS/MS method was successfully applied to determine the target AA and NT in plasma samples from schizophrenic patients.","inCitations":["8b24aa78efe93f6a5803f5a05fa44eb02c7e7265"],"pdfUrls":["https://res.mdpi.com/molecules/molecules-24-01658/article_deploy/molecules-24-01658.pdf?attachment=1&filename="],"title":"A Dual Ligand Sol–Gel Organic-Silica Hybrid Monolithic Capillary for In-Tube SPME-MS/MS to Determine Amino Acids in Plasma Samples","doi":"10.3390/molecules24091658","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules24091658","venue":"Molecules"}
