The Politics of Vaccination: A Global History, edited by Christine Holmberg, Stuart Blume, and Paul Greenough, describes the political and cultural contexts of vaccination efforts throughout history. The book examines the tensions existing between national independence and global interdependence, top-down program implementation and grassroots development, and individual rights and the common good. Each chapter tells the story of a specific vaccination program, and although time and place differ, when taken together, they highlight the push-and-pull that exists between individuals, nations, and multinational agencies in this context. The book is divided into three sections. The first demonstrates how national identity is shaped by the way the nation’s people respond to vaccine campaigns and interventions, especially when initiated by an outside agency. The second section traces the rise and fall over time of national vaccine production and the eventual transition to and reliance on multinational agencies to meet national needs, other than in outlier countries like Brazil and Japan. These accounts leave the reader unsure of how reliable these agencies will remain for individual countries in the future. The third section studies the pitfalls of the top-down approach in surveillance and prevention campaigns and underlines the difficulty of balancing individual rights with obligations to protect the public. These three sections are outlined in an introduction by the editors, which lays out a map for the reader to follow throughout the book. The commentary in the afterward, by asserting that the top-down approach of vaccine campaigns initiated by outside global leaders in developing nations results in significant collateral damage and ignores the national priorities, finalizes the tone for the book as a whole. Readers, regardless of their stances on the issues raised, will be challenged to think about the different lenses through which individuals or nations might see vaccine campaigns, and even public health interventions in general. Medical historians and anthropologists will appreciate the book’s perspectives on past experiences, which will be thought-provoking to public health practitioners and global health activists as well. Readers will enjoy the rich detail and historical references in each chapter and be intrigued by the character studies of textbook global health heroes, such as Dr. Alexander Langmuir and Dr. William Foege. The expert information can help public health practitioners consider in advance the effects, including potential unintended consequences, that large-scale interventions may have on a population. And, although the book may challenge those looking for a more straightforward account of the history of vaccination, most readers will find topics of interest within the various time periods and countries described. The Politics of Vaccination: A Global History, through its fresh and sometimes provocative perspective on global public health, reminds readers of the importance of political and cultural context when practicing disease surveillance and prevention.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/24/11/pdfs/18-1045.pdf"],"title":"The Politics of Vaccination: A Global History","doi":"10.3201/eid2411.181045","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.3201/eid2411.181045","venue":"Emerging Infectious Diseases"}

Furthermore, many gynecologic conditions, including abnormal uterine bleeding, pelvic pain and infertility, are imputed to deficient cesarean scar healing. Hysteroscopy is the most commonly reported approach for the revision of cesarean scar defects (CSDs). Nevertheless, existing evidence is inadequate to conclude that either hysteroscopy or laparoscopy is effective or superior to each other. Although several management options have been suggested recently, the laparoscopic approach has not been thoroughly scrutinized. We present a case and reviewed the data related to the laparoscopic repair of CSDs and compared the hysteroscopic and laparoscopic management options based on the data from previously published articles. As a result of our analyses, the laparoscopic approach increases uterine wall thickness when compared with the hysteroscopic approach, and both surgical techniques seem to be effective for the resolution of gynecologic symptoms. Hysteroscopic treatment most likely corrects the scar defect but does not strengthen the uterine wall; thus, the potential risk of dehiscence or rupture in subsequent pregnancies does not seem to be improved. Because large uterine defects are known risk factors for scar dehiscence, the repair of the defect to reinforce the myometrial endurance seems to be an appropriate method of treatment.","inCitations":["a797fcfb8754c9a6ced665fc75324cfdbb39c8e0","ddcaf91dbdc61ded8fec290b8088fbd6cfafe2fa","f500fabfd6e719aa1eae3c59ee4380b101d3fcbf","546db25cb08bde0a16b30a897a86025a22c1bc0f","4a51b799964ad760bc83ace5646526b791a2121b","893756c9ed3eab8ae131175b2e896318499024da","f1fc1c2fec5491d754e514e27967f3d87cf8bf39","376a8b510877e61e666bd4a51d60e14d947a74c7","c12caa8dc2ee6939426be997382d4d23a1b84060","f744de64df4a695f1cb89b51c556571ed666f778","5903fbfda8011bc6619d3cf22cc101ccc7a686b9","29188e4a69a1dac157f9b46383e26906df282de0","36d51b229c8161ff6bf2876b711e20f449d661a8","221fbe1b9f546166c160ca8b1d17c12082f5327e","6d94bf23474466f45746a4eb095991b972f23c49","63dd12590f9672203adb187e5a1cdbf9ed61ba6b","8b5095f68a66c0f1a35d938e6a5a565e29566781","c188e5c1580553bac664fb3eb50ffd481677c91a","4ab916b72f2fe8689ee7a4b2d3989c4bf093d1ad","a0cc98fb8c238aa926403ad4aabc4fdb38954284","514f2f1ffdd98e8f49ffb09a1c5bfe86a5e8e275","d047ea1aafaf0a2750dac51792e6050d5b4815c0","baf0195dd86950868d13d5b4ab1fe4b7955bb447","c8bd4dac866effd435674c4ef22e111da7aa9274","cd8d2727574694bd07204443a7adae9f9d7d6558","257e5b56b0d31185f0d98e65ea933915674475c0","be43511a92d34a84eb38b08f2521a70d60778ca9","73453912a3db0a74f78cb9b082beba73663ab7ba"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Should Cesarean Scar Defect Be Treated Laparoscopically?

He has served as head of strategic planning for the Israel Defense Forces and as senior military aide and chief of staff to four Israeli ministers of defense. Given the strategic significance and time frame of the negotiated accord, its consequences can be fully judged only in years to come. For now, however, a proverbial ocean separates the views of the U.S. and Israeli leaders on the prospective accord. For U.S. president Barack Obama, the emerging deal is a “historic opportunity” that could be his crowning foreign policy achievement. For Israeli prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu, the deal is a “historic mistake.” As relations between the two governments almost certainly approach rougher waters, it is important to contextualize their differences. In effect, one must seek to understand how these two close allies can view the same agreement so differently. Extensive discussions with Israeli and U.S. officials reveal the core elements of the U.S.-Israel disagreement to be differing threat perceptions, divergent worldviews and regional assessments, as well as a deep deficit of trust. Indeed, the roots of Israeli unease can be found as much in the context surrounding the deal as in its specific terms.

Although two separate studies have shown that more than one-third of military members think positively about forming a union (Bradley & Charbonneau, 2004; Deneumoustier, 1971), there has traditionally been little movement towards any form of associationism within Canada's military. While there is no formal ‘contract’ between the CF and the government of Canada, an informal social contract has appeared to be successful in maintaining the status quo. Critics of the social contract argue the agreement is one-sided; that is, the responsibilities of the member to Canada are well defined in the National Defence Act and Queen's Regulations and Orders but there is “no such articulation of the responsibilities of the Government of Canada to the men and women of the CF” (Milner, 1998, p. 10).","inCitations":["830f3964915207dd28e488719054b9ae9ef234e4","d6ba7601f29e756722380be8602e26a3c515a94e"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Freedom of Association and the Canadian Forces: Current Status and Future Trends","doi":"10.1016/S1572-8323(05)02030-8","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/S1572-8323%2805%2902030-8","venue":""}

The goal is to identify which patients with liver disease might safely receive warfarin.\n\n\nMETHODS AND RESULTS\nAmong 102 134 patients who received warfarin from the Veterans Affairs from 2007 to 2008, International Classification of Diseases-Ninth Revision codes identified 1763 patients with chronic liver disease. Specific diagnoses and laboratory values (albumin, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, creatinine, and cholesterol) were examined to identify risk of adverse outcomes, while controlling for available bleeding risk factors. Outcomes included percent time in therapeutic range, a measure of anticoagulation control, and major hemorrhagic events, by International Classification of Diseases-Ninth Revision codes. Patients with liver disease had lower mean time in therapeutic range (53.5%) when compared with patients without (61.7%; P<0.001) and more hemorrhages (hazard ratio, 2.02; P<0.001). Among patients with liver disease, serum albumin and creatinine levels were the strongest predictors of both outcomes. We created a 4-point score system: patients received 1 point each for albumin (2.5-3.49 g/dL) or creatinine (1.01-1.99 mg/dL), and 2 points each for albumin (<2.5 g/dL) or creatinine (≥2 mg/dL). This score predicted both anticoagulation control and hemorrhage. When compared with patients without liver disease, those with a score of zero had modestly lower time in therapeutic range (56.7%) and no increase in hemorrhages (hazard ratio, 1.16; P=0.59), whereas those with the worst score (4) had poor control (29.4%) and high hazard of hemorrhage (hazard ratio, 8.53; P<0.001).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nPatients with liver disease receiving warfarin have poorer anticoagulation control and more hemorrhages. A simple 4-point scoring system using albumin and creatinine identifies those at risk for poor outcomes.","inCitations":["67dbe5eb7cfa7e20e4600642ca1c107573a35016","9dcdfdb91025934c44c14b93dd72271b58519b0a","a6f874d989210689c63e797aeeec14f761946036","1a49d7c423de7b5ba3cb568d74fd31fa3f1d1a74","ed6fbcdc104a9e4b044e171b42e05b90e20712c8","2482265f03b210ba65ecd30180a953efe29211e7","3c9880b5a8adc3f0f608005ef1be8462d9092fa1","00fbbc7e247ff838d1f17f78c7c0ef81952c14db","b01a80d97694b5942614e91c858abef3e5275857","98a0ed19e97f63ad4d096f14b70f0e258c7b2264","4f6942e807b5ef87d64772a605c9561aad80eb4b","416e07e6a84689ff95ed3dffd862a44723caf369","74c57c00b0ad8ac59619747393dcee53360763a3","0628cbdb1806815f2b39bd836ce48268551d5309","09829c52690de613bc0810e42e401920a992c8ea","5eb7a037c599f98d08d1190128e7dff7855746c7","257a887dcc2ea673e3096bfc88b463a431f0cbe1","b36ca63ea3a9ce5102592047725580844fd74364","a245ab2898fe207607aea94e78b0a4139f799362","a64cca4f96acb41785d394c666d496055230a177","b49039b8423c2285181a30516e29787e89cdccae","7fccfa75d8de0cb155aaf630d869cbc60f77f629","456a032e8b6754ef18966cdea7e8e262bc932b12","9e01d15b04e09a6c0e1c33f2efc57f8fda2ca75e"],"pdfUrls":["http://circoutcomes.ahajournals.org/content/circcvoq/7/3/461.full.pdf?download=true","http://circoutcomes.ahajournals.org/content/circcvoq/early/2014/05/13/CIRCOUTCOMES.113.000817.full.pdf","http://circoutcomes.ahajournals.org/content/circcvoq/7/3/461.full.pdf","http://circoutcomes.ahajournals.org/content/circcvoq/early/2014/05/13/CIRCOUTCOMES.113.000817.full.pdf?download=true"],"title":"Stratifying the risks of oral anticoagulation in patients with liver disease.","doi":"10.1161/CIRCOUTCOMES.113.000817","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1161/CIRCOUTCOMES.113.000817","venue":"Circulation.

With the introduction of new imaging modalities, recanalization techniques and novel stent design the endovascular approach gained even more popularity and surpassed surgery as the primary treatment option. Still, lessons learned from our and others' experience launches a new era in which we should decide on some unsolved issues. Foremost, reproducible imaging techniques should help to define treatment indication. Second, further research is needed to establish the optimal stent design, but also advice on stenting techniques. Finally, if and when arteriovenous fistulas should be used to support early patency is still unclear. This manuscript addresses some of these technical considerations, pitfalls and complications to advice on materials and methods to optimize the quality of your treatment.","inCitations":["9921cf35dc16f67ddb471d694bfd71cb1c114a7e","30bafdebd6addea8f3da859ce921b14ce4be91b0","ce43a011273c32b9b9c022a211b203ec465c9e87","955c93cb97d76ceeba5cde61799501b7162d4df0","f534620eee39e0310073cf7ae639bb8d8d17eabf","b2e540cc95058a7721867faefb3ee11fcc5ca4b4","05bb8cb793e0bb90c4f398774b305f689e24a18e","708e92c5b14776fa4a56ba3912b3053ee6d22ba0","a4684b8585ecbd758b2e5daacbb1c31a69d77ee4","2c1462ec42caa9061224655045f721db93c98ac9","af2fed82183878b60a49b85cdd1a5455872f1bdd","249aa2f2b7bac9c61c52d55752c1ae3b3fe4eb4e","edfeb9b4ba141305c545153e837be5ed681f6fdd"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Stenting for chronic venous obstructions a new era","doi":"10.1177/0268355513476449","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1177/0268355513476449","venue":"Phlebology"}

Eleven growing barrows (initial BW = 44.6 +/- 6.5 kg) were surgically fitted with a T-cannula in the distal ileum and allotted to a Youden square design with 11 diets and 8 periods. One diet contained 66.7% S-DDGS, 1 diet contained 66.7% SC-DDGS, 8 diets contained 66.7% C-DDGS, and 1 diet was N-free. Chromic oxide (0.3%) was used in all diets as an indigestible marker. The direct procedure was used to measure apparent ileal digestibility (AID) and standardized ileal digestibility (SID) of CP and AA in the 10 sources of DDGS. Results of the experiment showed that the AID of Lys was not different among S-DDGS, SC-DDGS, and C-DDGS. The mean SID of CP, Arg, and Lys in C-DDGS were not different from values obtained in S-DDGS and SC-DDGS. The SID of Trp in S-DDGS (72.0%) was greater (P < 0.01) than in C-DDGS (64.9%), but there was no difference between C-DDGS and SC-DDGS (62.4%). The SID of CP and all AA were different among the 8 sources of C-DDGS (P < 0.01). Among the indispensable AA, Lys had the greatest variation and the SID ranged from 55.7 to 68.7%. The concentration of total and digestible AA was highly correlated (r(2)) for Arg (0.88), Ile (0.85), Leu (0.82), Phe (0.84), and Trp (0.84), but reduced r(2) values were observed for Lys (0.66) and Thr (0.39). A low correlation between the concentration and digestibility of AA indicates that it is desirable to develop in vitro procedures to predict digestible AA concentration in DDGS. In conclusion, SID values for CP and Lys in S-DDGS and SC-DDGS are within the range of values obtained in C-DDGS, but for many other AA, SID values in S-DDGS and in SC-DDGS are less than in C-DDGS.","inCitations":["52e6cf780c6475fbf9ad760d01b09b593db08be0","f04e948b5e002cf81ccde08d832f81f12feb10a0","8c3418bf7de92daf67340dbe4c67c0081a03a3f5","845af68d33cd526a943e6bed5acc4c790e460638","5219fe4066f65268ff4bcd328e352e22a36e84b4","56fbd92ba50fa0648b8aaedcff05af7d49ea30e2","b1d0792655e9aae92726318746d2be61a6d74fa1","3a6005c8c63f28db1e9ad0830202257930d67cf2","364d5dd4e6bff09f4ba7a8f25fe4046c5068d2db","0c2e06c6a1b16e320865fee640988a56061ae79d","27c43bc6a47fb3143875788b496bdb60350bef78","3f6e73338e8ec9879eac08854fa5cfc8414c21b2","a433419a93984ee0098841910ffe78b16c2ec304","8480a956695fba4da5c51290b76ce7ac80b08142","34e331bb2fd5443253433ee19e1a77cdc8330c24","db860320b1148f5701b850f52c33d26dcc72df60","122ee90a41e113c58661e7c6f2a95805d1072582","26357f7d20ab4becdbff08644300efdd5661ae5f","00b9352c3e3fe1e3c381b4ea4e158e5243ed646e","ce65b77fa86c2344fb07802429fd4f32ec4618fa","36cbd13d9fbddc41bc4481b95fd2499a85946261","d711c5ce0b5afdb947e168903ca37e10083c0edb","86a1183cbb44a792b6fc68dbcb06c242bbd1d96f","a83073cd1a6f1428b5edb87315d1dab59a95a8c9","e6df4d4691a3f714f177856ed192c36b482b743a","38e147259fb4d753fcc40afbfca54c54f158e695","f329a544050d5ede26089a732703dcdd38f70cc2","179bcb33d2fb0661016058ae50e5233f46f42aff","63bc47e71114361b159cd2c58e0aa842206d5253","7f7cf17968dd991428f113868fc0178591d5231e","872c0c7687e1e53ebb42055ed263f9e766fea2fc","a6d4840d0f4b2b9a7e529194a9b3f427acc904c5","4f802a12e57477564e92ec5328c10f3867d2cf5e","c76fdea38e0c9b3c84ac4be52a2fad3550c1ca3e","e888615097064cccf36027e2362198a37bfbe157","74225967c3c0a82a05dda45b0ba5d9e8d73edfdb","3de9dbb0ff660da7303a8aed86c2afec155af02e"],"pdfUrls":["https://nutrition.ansci.illinois.edu/sites/default/files/JAnimSci87.2574-2580.pdf","http://prairieswine.com/pdf/39620.pdf","https://www.animalsciencepublications.org/publications/jas/pdfs/87/8/2574"],"title":"Amino acid digestibility of distillers dried grains with solubles, produced from sorghum, a sorghum-corn blend, and corn fed to growing pigs.","doi":"10.2527/jas.2008-1436","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.2527/jas.2008-1436","venue":"Journal of animal science"}

Using outdoor mesocosms, we found lithium to be more conservative than rhodamine-WT when initial concentrations were 4.9 to 64 μg/L for rhodamine-WT and 28–516 μg/L for Li+ (1∶6 to 1∶8 (wt/wt) ratio of rhodamine-WT to Li+). At higher initial concentrations (i.e., 100 μg/L for rhodamine-WT and 1000 μg/L for Li+), both tracers returned more than 95% of the injected amount in submerged aquatic vegetation-dominated mesocosms; rhodamine-WT was returned at only 74–75% in cattail-dominated mesocosms. Batch studies using different sediment substrates exposed to direct sunlight and shade indicated that Li+ was less affected by adsorption and microbial processes than was rhodamine-WT at low initial tracer concentrations of each (4.9 and 19.4 μg/L for rhodamine-WT and 28 and 106 μg/L for Li+). Both rhodamine-WT and Li+ desorb back to the water column in small amounts. The extent of adsorption losses by rhodamine-WT depended on the organic matter content of the sediment and the extent of photolysis. Even though rhodamine-WT was not as stable as LiCl at initial concentrations less than 60 μg/L, the reduction in the recoveries did not affect the accuracy of key hydraulic parameters (hydraulic retention time, dispersion, tanks-in-series, and wetland dispersion numbers) derived from the method of moments analysis as long as a discernible concentration-time response still existed. This is because the tracer losses were approximately zero-order and irreversible.","inCitations":["05eddc7b94d6a1971f84c641506d49d2255a0100","0ee18df782c874e8d2447c8d3811755e4204f0bb","6a20e082b261d3cd4228e84492acfb187114ef8e","b4f7a9034979580341eccb7f415e6cdc8fbdffe9","cd03d7bfcc7a398d6dc1e6d8953cab9e6f559f22","a8fa568a74b08c38987ea248b024d8d6d5e819cc","c6b919d09f87676c4479d3c4c1f4eb6c72298f87","a35e17bed896fb25678a69363ac39e8bd2663914","0fe80cbf1b52846a42bf377517afa9ea1ab9aa2d","91e327456a30a5135459277a96a549dc8f7d3b4a","5aea67b5cb0b1cd767a7c9fc48f47481153546c6","d0d294d6d8e78d99ae23109e282055b11e7b312f","4c643577b8fd13888d5e2de483735a6c79cddfbc","126abb15a62650d483cb390fadee509a911c940c","f2727f6e9b05ebdfcbda40c6a9855e267fe4dee3","a8071f9bc55ed0cebc1221a79669a6c65f976f0c","7127b38f967b4df6d1af33b990fe80865bdd4ab5","b2fc43c7fdef122edaab9c487e701a5a16ed79b3","70a0fbed98c9d75eaba4694a9ea574189bffb716","0e2b71018df0c8ecda31bdc5ab59ff23a7a4316f","9231cd129f0d4b0f15b6701a2d1b57dccc67df8d","f4c4e87e9fd28cd4d8f1c1fb2c960c456bf684aa","442ae53149673c2b444e66f00e31f6143f6f3ed5","9665dcc2e60dc6412a9a43d4b2613591551fa2f1","d22d011fa0044c893e4c103234d5593cfcdafc6a","d9e03adebcbca078194a6a1929554555df637186","4eb30ce45bf03153e7bd236aa84ca142f99e9cfc","61a03f89e29a8d75140423b22a57f16ee6405859","ff071e48236a5642d785020c25d7738ba9705f9c","9da7575746faf76e8bcd619b2a8fdbfcb37c8846"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"An evaluation of two tracers in surface-flow wetlands: Rhodamine-WT and lithium","doi":"10.1672/0277-5212(2005)025[0008:AEOTTI]2.0.CO;2","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1672/0277-5212%282005%29025%5B0008%3AAEOTTI%5D2.0.CO%3B2","venue":"Wetlands"}

Following temporary dependence on mechanical circulatory support the patient was transferred to his own country. The clinical experience is discussed, including aspects of the surgical technique, postoperative complications, indication, relevance of mitral reconstruction and rhythm problems. It is concluded that partial left ventriculectomy can be used to treat end-stage dilated cardiomyopathy, even as an emergency operation.

This briefing report features three essays by experts – Lisa Jones, Ramon Borges-Mendez, and Janis Wolak – who focus on three aspects of youth wellbeing: youth victimization and other indicators of psychological health, youth unemployment, and online sexual predators of youth. Although youth well-being is of primary concern, the worrisome stories about crimes against children that regularly fill the media have unfortunately obscured some more positive news from statistical reports on these same issues. Child victimizations of various types – i.e., child sexual abuse, witnessing domestic violence, child physical abuse, sexual assaults of teenagers, physical assaults and robberies of teenagers, and homicides of teenagers – have been declining nationwide and in Massachusetts since the early 1990s, in some cases declining dramatically.

To evaluate the intensity of leisure participation, we used the Persian version of Children's Assessment of Participation and Enjoyment (CAPE) completed by the participants. Demographic form, Craig Hospital Inventory of Environmental Factors (CHIEF), Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), Family Environmental Scale (FES), SPARCLE cognitive level and parents' version of Gross Motor Function Classification System, Manual Ability Classification System and Communication Function Classification System were sent to the parents with some necessary explanations. Structural equation modeling was used to test the model hypothesis. SPSS version 18 and AMOS version 16 were used for data analysis.\n\n\nResults\nComparative fit indexes indicated a moderate to good model fit. The presented model explained 44% of the variance in the intensity of participation. Constructs such as Family Activity Orientation with standardized total effect of 0.31 and path coefficients of P< .05 showed the most significant direct effect on participation, followed by higher gross motor function (-.26), higher manual ability (-.19), communication function (-.17), higher cognitive level (-.16), more siblings in the family (.15) and less emotional-behavioral problems (-.15). Family structures and relationships (.17) and unsupportive environment constructs (-.14) demonstrated an indirect but significant effect (P< .05). The relationship of family education level and income with participation was not significant (P>.05).\n\n\nConclusion\nThe intensity of CP children's participation is influenced by child, family and environmental factors. Parents' knowledge of recreational activities and their preference to participate in leisure and recreational activities provide children more opportunities to participate. Higher gross motor function, manual ability, and communication function also play an important role in their participation. Family structure means family cohesion, roles organization, and conflicts between family members and encountering physical, attitudinal and structural barriers at home and community indirectly impact children's participation pattern. To enhance children's participation, we suggest therapists to support children's behaviors, family relationships and involvement in community activities and optimize physical function of children with limitations in self-mobility.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Predictors of Leisure Participation in 6 to 14-Year-Old Children with Cerebral Palsy: Structural Equation Modeling.","doi":"10.22037/ijcn.v14i2.23646","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.22037/ijcn.v14i2.23646","venue":"Iranian journal of child neurology"}

The controversy is partly due to conceptual and methodological problems. The objective of this paper is to analyze the main methodological problems in the estimation of placebo effects. Variations in the meaning of the concept of placebo effect are described, and the main methodological problems are analyzed. The notion of placebo effect has at least two main meanings: effect of placebo intervention, and effect of patient-provider interaction. When the terms are defined pragmatically, effects of placebo can be estimated as the difference between placebo and no-treatment in randomized trials. The effect of patient-provider interaction can similarly be assessed by comparing manipulation of the patient-provider interaction with no manipulation. In both cases bias due to lack of double-blinding is a potential problem.","inCitations":["aa4766fd2eff6b4194203016955c75c06e1f3370","78e42382f6e381ef1ee32aa3fb2c02228e356975","620a2c02e490286ade13c10926c5d052509c78af","bee431ee37f08eaeeacecf99635deafbd49ad8c1","a788db286ff7787729c24ad4ce79392f4b8def32","50ab6dfd575c6a433541aeac6952f1ca0660f11f","a31018b01639090b54c90e2daf435727f7e8efe7","8c39b0c02d90fe60f0f268f1da9ad74e40a0bad3","428d336e5b774acf0fe7655c4a76e322029a6f25","2daaa4d9ad066e83cdc9fd42744105f7423608a8","1b012bc779ca2da4b7b09c56709200e99226d178","b7d68464371a4544e8439bd2e3b2e2e0e20816af","2fa59e92eb87c839d5ea4bd201a361932e24935f","996bd8b6fdf45a05c460e718a18cfd6bdbd90ada","94a6eba9de49c6f1143d26fe4d5fba569825cdae","18ce483e7fb72062d0a141a9ba401fdf73ad6d0f","66ab8ee6c4701825e0db54e4fa9388cd021624c3","40b005e4af99e5695d3d48d2b54c23f6e319ea02","c284296df164d9ba7b57d8b825de79d943c04dc9","abc2048c0738d00b6fd8946da78c43de6ea75819","e662064cc7e20fcb18544443a31c703c372d4c85","cbbd80ae263d409578e98258a23ac8e6210aedff","89e752f7337a832e54a0f38c1984b25ca43c1484","7d9022a6e2a6d7a9617b3e14217f64b230cc7e8d","761d34fd8bbf99b98fcf70e361e5fcecf93914b0","fa7d00ab51dd7e37705071d350b2fc5c43b852c7","1e081d7720506929d4625a32caf253d73ad80d8c","7061b740014893ce97e3339b35c5dea9b03ac620","ead479bec633d99a3959aa815f21fd9374ac4e97","78451683ac6fe46705cc3b44072a81d9c57b1b4d","fb582b5ce67798e03bc1708d3793bc844bbf5fa2","436e78b3bd747da1a4ac14677fe82fe3a09e5cda","d962788fd8102e8a9cea7dd2c49810865eb5c189","e93045e2877a0b4caa4f1ae2e1a72c54c4e86ff1","77aa15450ccf7e4f409e35bdea361e489e2165b0","5c94d0994f24df6d7f67e78ea6f23693abc0a250","6c2fb57255435d28f1873f909596f0118b861252","b16a0541e2194abd717384ce3f9271482a36992f","ba22b1e17c7165109451b098f6607737e7d0e40c","97bc938c17f0328a31ca2606726f066c842a2187","7324e4cd44778930f7084b3883b58762668a7d82","ee0bd94380a5685eadf7bf646f053cc6a5082e4e","c073afe0719c252ac808649f005eff3fb454c720","d6a4ddf6e51d0f055ab88b7ba24ba77f227fae57","c5a122f07e063622a628d0c2b66b174ad4ae593f","c0811a6762b0f03861244770a71666c32d48ce86","5c5cdbc772e9fe383766fcfbf13529d505c03387","61e27d4a8aba616de19aca39241121150d692d1f","418908f6a947f4f8098d6522c07c453d99f0417b","d7bb1f510c26c97a2b323a90a276526d2f3a4e38","5d5cd6c5f54d7322aadd063a8f8aa50954d4e997","c1442d5d070c195b9aac88399490c0a3c801d614","805028851003447346ecea5f7f2defec161ecda5","910e74a25d869febcf448bf2704626d276640463","ce1199390d7b8a96ab95eb440827edcc24847a33","9b001e727338219c61b11035b720d74a7112f6d2","529daca78153157091963d693d178307f169368e","d1635caea21a9fc94017c3b2ed15393e24cd16a9","397f5a6a300a6160583e1ef6009ef5c3d32e1baf","b902c95187b04dbb8ccf59de6a286ca877190f0e","252daf48b9a0eceeffcc667d2de622880e417e45","340375b0531312ac2873b75f9efb3b370f3ef940","78400e15dc91e19618dee743e18b66e67b0edf96","615db86b05da65227a5d64f5bffea5ef6146879d","2c1a2919ca05a9900b87f19f2d2c22101ce7c980","79e5862c0af2d05eacd1c633c328c2e971dc5d49","1c00d4a0d9b121c3b569dab67634c96d583ffafd","e7af02f4ae5790f3bf23bb9908fb99c0ec824982","e34750f5ebafe7e5767091d9fb4b627c122df5bb","d69a3451e9a2fb3cc7777f3aa3f8d429ac893853","3b51b40bd8e43d7a84e9f94ec478b83892e5f499","80505818b3f448827ae7094f05a3d242d0633b7a","f37a962680ddb898a25da07d0d2f5a5c552129ae","65899ecf37d4609410cb7037ee2bc24e44bec77b","08798d5234b94c589dd248588dadea08b515933e","b6d15bae2c82036bc904c8aa98673797fb8e20b7","0c84921b639c7b1cb2f9c4a9126a26ec1fe3f698","e89f2f3590b7c9a8bc9e9a82f4743b6ae8f5fc2c","6faed8141df0031e980e93b0ea038c6d11206671","7572de99dd73eab748aa26bc4daf8291ecf7f833","c9155650bc652b93f87939c17d0abd33e5785edf","33f370e6c7bad82b3d9a66468be1a17fa8143d0d","b82a99f33caa06282511e2496ad795b1a8052299","95d4de98a377b4bb8036dbc47dcce82cc81d70c5","c7fa270b681f915b6c9803920146dda7bdf28e8d","766084bc43020362446bae31e1e7dec2030d8582","155435f92addc8551db8486d3bd704e1bcf928db","f0f0c7cd7c9129f200ba3cf348871276ab052874","874b5e73a0af7761aa58d98046be3ab23f063353","c60fec4200a5472a2cba70a190649ee0b2e25489"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"What are the main methodological problems in the estimation of placebo effects?","doi":"10.1016/S0895-4356(01)00496-6","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/S0895-4356%2801%2900496-6","venue":"Journal of clinical epidemiology"}

Twelve patients presented predominantly and their angiograms demonstrated tight thoracic outlets as the underlying cause of vascular compression. Twenty three first rib resections were performed through the transaxillary approach with apparently complete relief of the syndrome. The similar etiology of the thoracic outlet syndrome and subclavian vein thrombosis was discussed on the basis of angiographic findings.

Operational activity and stability by esterification of oleic acid with ethanol and thermal inactivation using these derivatives were investigated. Derivative obtained by sequentially activation with glycidol, ethylenediamine, and glutaraldehyde and subsequent TLL immobilization showed the best performance, with high hydrolytic activity value. Its stability was 15-fold higher than solubilized TLL in the evaluated inactivation conditions (60 °C, 25 mM sodium phosphate buffer pH 7). After 5 cycles of oleic acid esterification, only a few percentage of its conversion has reduced. On the other hand, glycidol-activated chitosan derivative showed very low hydrolytic activity value. Epichlorohydrin-activated chitosan derivative showed regular hydrolytic activity value. Both derivatives showed low immobilization yields. Operational stability of this last derivative was very low, where after the first cycle of oleic acid esterification, only 56% of its initial conversion was obtained.\n Graphical Abstractᅟ","inCitations":["b0ae5de034e6f7026636f7797a349fa1c274a553","779fa4ebe73cb4e610a74b39a441aec86a0b0e80","1d2f5569fed41ec5143f49a6c20a8c988d4e072f","4a91f3d59d86e0042f3401dc2a428ba79f6a0860","47955d251e193a66675586b59203cfc15c818c85","7a6af972611eaebd4ae1daa6ad7c77f6f34d35c7"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Operational and Thermal Stability Analysis of Thermomyces lanuginosus Lipase Covalently Immobilized onto Modified Chitosan Supports","doi":"10.1007/s12010-017-2546-9","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s12010-017-2546-9","venue":"Applied Biochemistry and Biotechnology"}

Objectives: To compare PCV to VCV with decelerating flow profile during assisted and controlled modes in an acute lung injury experimental model. Methods: Severe acute lung injury (PaO2/FIO2 < 100 mmHg) was induced by oleic acid IV infusion (0.05 mg/kg) in seven dogs. The animals were submitted to PCV and VCV in a randomized sequence. After 40 minutes in the assisted mode, ventilation was changed to the controlled mode after neuromuscular blockade. The tidal volume and the inspiratory time were kept constant throughout the experiment. Results: There were no differences in gas exchange (PaO2 and PaCO2), cardiac output or oxygen delivery (DO2) between VCV and PCV. The same was observed regarding maximum airway and plateau pressures, and also to the static compliance. Oxygen consumption (VO2) after neuromuscular blockade was 124 ± 48 in VCV versus 143 ± 50 ml/min in PCV, p = 0.42. In the assisted mode, there was a statistical trend of a higher VO2 in PCV (219 ± 72 versus 154 ± 67 ml/min in VCV, p = 0.06), that was associated with a statistical trend of a higher oxygen cost of breathing (OCB) during assisted PCV, although without statistical significance (31 ± 77 in VCV versus 75 ± 96 ml/min in PCV, p = 0.23), and also in a lower PvO2 (34 ± 7 in PCV versus 42 ± 6 ml/min in VCV, p = 0.02). These occurred despite a higher maximum inspiratory flow in the assisted mode in PCV (58 ± 9 versus 48 ± 4 L/min in VCV, p = 0.01). In both VCV and PCV the institution of controlled ventilation reduced cardiac debit and DO2 in as much as 20% relative to the assisted mode. Conclusions: The implementation of controlled ventilation improved the oxygen delivery/consumption relationship in this severe and with high OCB acute lung injury model. The PCV offered no additional benefits to VCV and it was associated with a higher OCB during the assisted mode.","inCitations":["dc6c9b816d1e9b231ded71526c77e3a04afafa03","c6de43bb893b02448530263dabed14edc53cc109","d3bbdbbfe7272bba1e093a752ce36544008ea9ea"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.scielo.br/pdf/jpneu/v28n1/a05v28n1.pdf","http://www.jornaldepneumologia.com.br/PDF/2002_28_1_4_portugues.pdf"],"title":"Ventilação mecânica volume-controlada versus pressão controlada em modelo canino de lesão pulmonar aguda: efeitos cardiorrespiratórios e sobre o custo de oxigênio da respiração","doi":"10.1590/S0102-35862002000100005","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1590/S0102-35862002000100005","venue":""}

Our reason for doing this is that we are particularly interested in the concept of context and the way in which this concept may be used to shape techniques of task analysis. We argue that the concept of 'context' is most profitably understood as the process of contextualization and a framework is presented which shows how the process of contextualization operates in different interaction styles to serve the user's needs. Further, it is shown how understanding of contextualization enables the designer to reduce the complexity of an interface. The benefit of this perspective is that it clarifies shortcomings in current understanding of the role of task analysis.","inCitations":["909a6776d51bdb9deb1bc0aafaec21de23d34a24","ec25b65b893d999569a70c81c78312db0162f635","9f8527cc20764ad87414218d0bcd4eb610c97219","e9d39e503717c4dd8bd1ca3de5ccb92fc2c7c99d","8bc3eeb474dff381fc2a40fefbc6a34b12e3408a"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Putting task analysis into context","doi":"10.1145/191642.191663","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1145/191642.191663","venue":"SGCH"}

Findings indicate that CHF patients must make significant changes in many aspects of daily life. Previous studies of older primary health-care participants and their activities of daily living (ADL)-ability are rare. The aim of this study was to describe ADL-ability in older people with CHF syndrome. The factors considered were dependence on others, perceived strain, quality of performance, and the association between The New York Heart Association classification (NYHA) and ADL-ability. The participants, recruited from a primary health-care centre, had symptoms indicating CHF and were diagnosed by a cardiologist. Forty persons over 65 years (mean age 81), participated in the study and self-reported co-morbidity was frequent. The Assessment of Motor and Process Skills (AMPS) and the Staircase of ADL were used to describe ADL-ability. Most participants were independent with respect to personal activities of daily living (PADL), and 75% were dependent in one or more instrumental activities of daily living (IADL), usually shopping. Most participants perceived strain, and only three could perform all ADL without strain. Age had a significant impact on ADL performance (motor measures: OR 7.11, CI 1.19-42.32, p = 0.031 and process measures: OR 8.49, CI 1.86-38.79, p = 0.006). However, participants showed lower ADL motor and process ability in AMPS compared with well persons of the same age. Participants in NYHA III/IV (adjusted for age), had significantly increased effort (under motor cut-off) when performing ADL-tasks (OR: 15.5, CI 2.40-100.1, p = 0.004) compared to those in NYHA I/II. Older persons in primary health care with CHF exhibit a high amount of dependence, perceived strain and increased effort during performance of ADL. There is an association between NYHA class III/IV and a decreased ADL-ability (AMPS motor ability) even when adjusted for age.","inCitations":["c573ab8a6c5770e8e9eed91a4ad456e3e619f172","7e3a9a3ea22a797a60e9db5aa4f17b145839b97a","4160c0a321fe732bbb0e6123eec5246148679bbe","cd6676254f81fe2c438437874a4158124aff8006","de4fc2368c4767bc9bdff733f8fc4b1bca9d7ada","e3efc29f070f3c50694bbea1033bf622ab01f19a","dc88adc0454bbac87c84a5fb2673320b454c97dc","606924f5df702fb3f71f69391299ad0e2a81808e","791d1c32f0b268b9b18f3a794482517a4a76601a","917713fcd06f34cfa33752cb712786ec749e4a11","80167cbe421b31f70c9abed857aea6a291ced196","3bea56c470252ae913a1168a73bd20ad14a7751d","d4823b3d05e4eaa79af2fbe6dd69608e347fe2fa","efaa1473368c79ada2c7368c401a193de624f188","3e71a7f6fced26fd2b103655fdf311c3403cc772","8668977a0f8d3359e553d7d7f9add615c822ac38","28b9795b3e1890d51423fc61183282f849a5d97f","58b8aef2494afbc5dfaefc1eea962d490586e7c7","178002f086122b7818a90f9a8e27b2d3949849a2","19ccf04e07d3b2dd5ac9988dd87064c48df4997c","58423d62fe6db41cf81f4e38f04deb0606fe15bb","61997ba392b7a078b57c06cb796d5c8f45f3dcab","fa827add544bcda34bf604bb3ad30861c872e62f","91a1dc348b02a3d463e19be78f4187ee8d431d6a","dfd51596845cbe1f978db5460cd26124a3639e52","92c66dad7583fa6f7a37fb05ad6e4feb2c1ed010"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Activities of daily living for old persons in primary health care with chronic heart failure.","doi":"10.1111/j.1471-6712.2007.00514.x","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1471-6712.2007.00514.x","venue":"Scandinavian journal of caring sciences"}

We evaluated potassium levels in a real-world cohort of patients with HF and its effect on mortality. All patients with a diagnosis of HF at a health maintenance organization were evaluated and followed for cardiac-related hospitalizations and death. The cohort consisted of 6,073 patients with HF. Mean potassium levels were 4.57 ± 0.53 mmol/L. Most patients (68%) had potassium levels in the normal range (4.0 to 5.0 mmol/L). High-normal potassium levels (5.0 to 5.5) were present in 17% of the patients, low potassium levels (<4.0) in 11%, and hyperkalemia (K ≥5.5) in 4%. Mean follow-up was 576 days. The overall mortality rate during this period was 14%. Survival rate by Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated that hypokalemia (K ≤3.5) was associated with the lowest survival rate. Survival was highest in patients with high-normal potassium levels. Cox regression analysis after adjustment for significant predictors including co-morbidities and standard HF drug therapies demonstrated that high-normal potassium levels were independently associated with reduced mortality compared with normal reference levels (hazard ratio 0.78, 95 confidence interval [CI] 0.64 to 0.95, p = 0.01). Subgroup analysis showed improved outcome with high-normal potassium levels in patients with reduced renal function, spironolactone, and loop diuretic therapy. In conclusion, potassium levels in the high-normal range appear to be safe and are associated with an improved outcome in patients with HF.","inCitations":["0b31a0a7672d60e3fa1eb15c7d615d44b26bd5d5","2fbd994cedb92c888d1f92c81c2089927c0a0c1d","25ef4bcf2b9a35db1b42f9cd83ed1c606179396d","824183d9bf8c457da2c607c523921b451d35a50f","dcb241c1f8923026e8d7c854bca28b63c65cb1ed","f3a72ac83108f21b49345bdba448381cce5515ed","9699d4b74ea14d79a74fe7e9645a5ea7aced42ca","2623469958e4df381b739eebd72dc2ca68213116","e6fa6804387537840d15c4668abdd7961f89b987","46892c9e28057d02bfe6fbfe517224c0229e37e9","75995fab030c41a1e7e63a50e629a91399fa1647","2563374cc900bddb92f2820b5417678915a5a276","28afc4ac8c4643d7665f0b1cabd50dbbe99f36a0","7363de4d20856d1fe0cd2fb06d613cfabfd8ea3d","acaefb9eaeec0062e6ca970b4e565bdcd648fb6d","db6aaea87402963c07d35282e4ef0f43264a949f","b3fa1e0409dcdd116f03b41d2ca9021d8d745bf8","4d2523a6fd9ff3c77e108af76374ebc783d8ce8b"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Serum Potassium Levels and Outcome in Patients With Chronic Heart Failure.","doi":"10.1016/j.amjcard.2016.08.078","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amjcard.2016.08.078","venue":"The American journal of cardiology"}

Some of these changes may even be passed on to progeny and eventually lead to adaptive evolution. Transgenerational changes in response to stress include alterations in DNA methylation and changes in homologous recombination frequency (HRF). The progeny of plants that were stressed often show elevated HRF as well as genomic hypermethylation, although specific loci that are beneficial in times of stress may be hypomethylated. One of the possible mechanisms responsible for passing the memory to the progeny involves small interfering RNAs; Dicer-like proteins, DCL2 and DCL3, are in part required for this process. However, while epigenetic modifications are often present in the untreated progeny of stressed plants, they are not usually sustained for multiple unexposed generations. Still, transgenerational inheritance of such changes has already begun to provide evidence for an important role of epigenetics in enhancing stress resistance.","inCitations":["c3c41ee9f09b1f25d8513ae0400816fe0a8888ea","56123caf637b40cc39bf26a4ae8bbaea4354bc49","e7cada68c9cb3610e7a3479cd491dd6f0d99ba43","a4ee5410d324e3d10312591500a3a2c0e0ca0294","0e377775ee846d1bb039b0f6bb9d8806d100b1b5","764c00297c6e2ea0027a39581a711442499d313e","6b7dc838e38f51176b7c082d62baa01c0004ce96","616563aa560de4ddeab345524cf2682f3b056390","00b0ab24e126b4ff24f0d08a97c3ee7491028fb1","5136b316c67059de5077a016a70262192289ecf3","28ff702f821e01c3de5b510a3c8bf25e43bf1ba6","fc0bc8c509a7254c93ae638b44b77f11e056b9f4","a56a5e2765f423485ad647cd9cacb9cab7b89053","7e5f35eb3d1e5340289101e3d9effa76f4486012","bfec59937edccc199970a497b4d3a611abd38bab"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Changes to DNA methylation and homologous recombination frequency in the progeny of stressed plants.","doi":"10.1139/bcb-2012-0046","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1139/bcb-2012-0046","venue":"Biochemistry and cell biology = Biochimie et biologie cellulaire"}

To accurately understand the projected impacts from global warming, it is necessary to understand the sex ratio baseline in advance of climate change. To address this, the primary sex ratio of loggerhead hatchlings, Caretta caretta, was estimated from incubation duration of 27,697 in situ nests from 21 nesting beaches used by two subpopulations of loggerhead turtles in Brazil over the last 25 years. A strong female bias (94%) was observed in all the areas used by the northern loggerhead stock, Sergipe (SE) and Bahia (BA), whereas a more balanced sex ratio (53% female) was estimated at the regions used by the southern loggerhead stock, Espirito Santo (ES) and Rio de Janeiro (RJ). Both inter-annual (SE: 83% to 99%, BA: 79. % to 98%, ES: 33% to 81%, RJ: 18% to 81%) and inter-beach variabilities (SE: 91% to 98%, BA: 89% to 96%, ES: 47% to 69%, RJ: 28% to 55%) in mean female offspring were observed. These findings provide evidence of persistent female bias in Brazil, and importantly identify male producing beaches and months, which will guide management decisions.","inCitations":["4b8ef5037809bac716b2564fe2f08d21b74c9b5a","f3336714ed025275bd9353851389aa00128f73ff","fd6f38bea9d09c4b7cf4be814a2ea6e7212602b2","20c73b5d4352f1cd339fcb6e70920136b7bafe82","6c3c048057a37dda6fe85c22667457f274c830c2","c206ed8aef796b8ad13a1556e8e7b64d7af6fee9","a980a60ac2090ae1867f4716a256a9efa0692871","e75ad415ecbe9e2280cb931fe674835af067ef6f","7d554480e591a2a6f143d20bcacd5d1acfdff53d","ca17449fee85fb9c491fd1415c617b4f2b9d99d8"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.eoas.fsu.edu/sites/default/files/NewsScroll/2016/2016_Marcovaldi_JEMBE.pdf"],"title":"Identification of loggerhead male producing beaches in the south Atlantic: Implications for conservation","doi":"10.1016/j.jembe.2016.01.001","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jembe.2016.01.001","venue":""}

Per AUA/SUFU treatment guidelines, patients should be offered first-line behavioral therapies, second-line medical treatment, and then third-line procedure-based treatment (botox injections or neuromodulation) if needed. Numerous studies have shown that most patients diagnosed with OAB are not prescribed medications and those who are discontinue medications within one year due to side effects, lack of efficacy, and/or cost. However, it remains unknown how frequently female patients in the U.S. progress from second- to third-line treatment in a real-world setting. The purpose of this study was to determine the proportion of women who undergo third-line treatment within two years of initiating medications. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study of adult women diagnosed with non-neurogenic OAB and prescribed a second-line medical treatment was conducted using the Truven MarketScan, a nationally representative administrative claims database. All women aged 63 or less who had their first OAB medication prescription claim between January 1, 2013, and December 31, 2014, were included. Women were excluded if they did not have continuous enrollment for at least one year prior to and two years following their first prescription claim. The primary outcome was the proportion of women at two years following the first prescription claim who 1) never refilled their prescription, 2) discontinued their prescription, 3) had filled a prescription within the previous 90 days, and 4) received a third-line treatment. RESULTS: Of the 17,429 women diagnosed with OAB and prescribed second-line medical treatment, nearly one-third (n=5,331, 30%) did not refill their prescription or receive third-line treatment within two years. A total of 6,295 (36%) women refilled their prescription at least once but discontinued their prescription by two years, and 4,265 (24%) had OAB medication claims at two years. Only 1,538 (9%) progressed from second- to third-line treatment, 383 (25%) of whom also had OAB medication claims at two years. CONCLUSIONS: Two years after initiation of medications for OAB, two-thirds of women were neither on second-line medical treatment nor had undergone a third-line treatment. Less than 10% of women progressed from second- to third-line treatment. While it is not possible to assess symptom severity, response to treatment, or whether third-line treatments were offered in this claims database, when combined with findings from previous studies, these results highlight a potential gap in the treatment of women with OAB.

We performed a comparative examination of each treatment’s complications and cost to assess their relative values. Methods: Using the MarketScan database of younger women with private insurance and the SEER-Medicare database of older women with public insurance, we identified 105 211 women with early breast cancer diagnosed between 2000 and 2011. We used diagnosis and procedural codes to identify treatment complications within 24 months of diagnosis and compared complications by treatment using two-sided logistic regression. Mean total and complication-related cost, relative to Lump+WBI, were calculated from a payer’s perspective and adjusted for differences in covariables using linear regression. All statistical tests were two-sided. Results: Lump+WBI was the most commonly used treatment. Mastectomy plus reconstruction was associated with nearly twice the complication risk of Lump+WBI (Marketscan: 54.3% vs 29.6%, relative risk [RR] = 1.87, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.82 to 1.91, P < .001; SEER-Medicare: 66.1% vs 37.6%, RR = 1.75, 95% CI = 1.69 to 1.82, P < .001) and was also associated with higher adjusted total cost (Marketscan: $22 481 greater than Lump+WBI; SEER-Medicare: $1748 greater) and complication-related cost (Marketscan: $9017 greater; SEER-Medicare: $2092 greater). Brachytherapy had modestly higher total cost and complications than WBI. Lumpectomy alone entailed lower cost and complications in the SEER-Medicare cohort only. Conclusions: Mastectomy plus reconstruction results in substantially higher complications and cost than other guideline-concordant treatment options for early breast cancer.

Such models are motivated by the hope to improve the estimation of the latent traits by additionally considering response time. In this article, the potential relevance of the response times for psychological assessment is explored for the model of van der Linden (Psychometrika 72:287–308, 2007) that seems to have become the standard approach to response time modeling in educational testing. It can be shown that the consideration of response times increases the information of the test. However, one also can prove that the contribution of the response times to the test information is bounded and has a simple limit.","inCitations":["8e25fe4b57ce24a78941d28120e6c0bcd5259e62","7b1567382028dcd6c1eb62d7e710507b50f9727d","a9890953f61eb3a7ff45a513e4dc89a54d7fc83b","7787bc0822862c528192210ee6c071c753d9fd3d","5000e554bc6771f20624069cc271800f0218533e","2d30270cb820db9fa51bbbddd1cdb25d7cf71463"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"A Note on the Hierarchical Model for Responses and Response Times in Tests of van der Linden (2007)","doi":"10.1007/s11336-013-9324-6","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11336-013-9324-6","venue":"Psychometrika"}

The prophylactic action of cassava intake and its deleterious effect on humans are attributed mainly to the toxicity of the aglycon moiety of the cyanogenic glucoside “linamarin”, when the latter breaks down. Particularly this study was focused on validating the proposed mechanism by Koshland et. al. for glycoside hydrolysis reactions towards hydrolysis of “linamarin”. Quantum mechanics calculations in gas phase at B3LYP/6-311+G** level of theory for a simplified model of β-glucosidase active site with linamarin as the substrate, clearly indcated a stepwise mechanism for glycosylation. The rate determining step is nucleophilic substition by Glu373 to form the covalently bonded enzyme substrate intermediate with protonation of the leaving group by Glu165. The geometrical configuration of the transition state for the enzymatic reaction was essentially the same as that found for a gas-phase model involving only the substrate and propionate/propionic acid pair to represent the catalytic glutamate/glutamic acid groups. The model estimated a reaction barrier of 29.65 kcal/mol while the reaction energy being 15.25 kcal/mol for glycosylation step of linamarin. Furthermore it was found that the rate determining step is the first step owing to a higher barrier than the second thus rationalizing the proposed Koshland retention mechanism. The mechanistic insights gained are valuable for not only understanding similar reaction mechanisms but also for rational design of novel linamarin analogs as potent anti-cancer drugs.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://ir.kdu.ac.lk/bitstream/handle/345/2377/Abstract%20Book%20Final%20Version_256.pdf?isAllowed=y&sequence=1"],"title":"Rationalizing the classical Koshland retention mechanism of Iinamarin hydrolysis with transition state modelling using quantum mechanics","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

The most common clinical symptoms are polyneuropathy, autonomic and gastrointestinal disorders.\n DESIGN/METHODS: \nRetrospectively we identify patients with familial amyloidosis assessed in the Neurophysiology laboratory of our hospital from July 1st, 2011 to October 24, 2014. Assessment included sympathetic skin responses (SSR) and heart-rate variability (HRV). Statistical analysis was performed using SigmaStat V3.5, p<0.05 was consider statistically significant.\n RESULTS: \nA total of 43 patients with documented pathogenic TTR mutation were identified; 24 were women, mean age 42±13 years. We compared them with 10 healthy controls (6 women, mean age 46±5 years). Since we found a significant difference in palmar SSR but no difference in plantar SSR between patients and controls, we divided patients into two groups according to presence (PSSR) or absence (ASSR) of palmar SSR (PSSR n=28, ASSR n=15) in order to further identify changes in HRV. During supine position HRV coefficient was significant reduced in ASSR but not in PSSR when compared to controls (6.6±5.4 vs 20±9.3 vs 18.7±6.3, respectively. p<0.001). During active standing, 30:15 index was also reduced in ASSR (1.03 [1.02-1.11]) but not in PSSR (1.25 [1.14-1.40]) nor in controls (1.28 [1.18-1.39]) p<0.001. HR to deep breathing E:I ratio was also reduced in ASSR (1.09 [1.05-1.17]) compared to PSSR (1.41[1.2-1.59]) and controls (1.31[1.29-1.33]) p<0.001.\n CONCLUSIONS: \nAll tests showed significantly less HRV in patients with ASSR than in patients preserving SSR and controls, this may indicate that the cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction is already present when the impairment of sympathetic skin function is manifested. SSR response is a useful measurement to detect early sympathetic dysfunction and may help to encourage prompt HRV evaluation in ATTR patients with abnormal SSR.\n Study Supported by: \nnone Disclosure: Dr. Callejas has nothing to disclose.

In order to accomplish this analysis, evapotranspiration was divided into evaporation from the soil and transpiration from wheat. Moreover, the effect of soil salinity on evapotranspiration was evaluated through the relationship between actual evapotranspiration and potential evapotranspiration (Ea/Eo) and the total soil water potential (Φ) was divided into two components: matric potential (ΨM) and osmotic potential (Ψo). Two sites with different salinity levels were chosen for this study, located in hebei Province, China. Measurements were conducted in April–May 1997 and May 1998. The Bowen ratio method was used to estimate the actual evapotranspiration (Ea), whereas potential evapotranspiration (Eo) was estimated using Penman’s equation. Measurements of soil evaporation (Es) were obtained with micro-lysimeters, and transpiration was calculated from the difference betweenEa andEs. The results show that transpiration comprised on average almost 80% of total evapotranspiration. Evaporation from the soil differed slightly between years, but this variation was dominated by the leaf area index (LAI), which ranged from 4 to 5 during the study period of 1997 and 1998. Soil electric conductivity (EC), which is directly related to osmotic potential, ranged from 1.9 to 3.5 mS cm−1 in 1997 and was negligible in 1998. Our results indicate that lower osmotic potential decreases the total soil water potential, thus affecting plant transpiration. Hence, it is possible to say that soil salinity actually decreases evapotranspiration from winter wheat fields.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Water status in winter wheat grown under salt stress","doi":"10.1007/BF02888691","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/BF02888691","venue":""}

Recent studies suggested that freezing facilitates action preparation and decision-making but the neurocognitive mechanisms remain unclear. We applied functional magnetic resonance imaging, posturographic and autonomic measurements while participants performed a shooting task under threat of shock. Two independent studies, in unselected civilians (N = 22) and police recruits (N = 54), revealed that preparation for shooting decisions under threat is associated with postural freezing, bradycardia, midbrain activity (including the periaqueductal gray-PAG) and PAG-amygdala connectivity. Crucially, stronger activity in the midbrain/PAG during this preparatory stage of freezing predicted faster subsequent accurate shooting. Finally, the switch from preparation to active shooting was associated with tachycardia, perigenual anterior cingulate cortex (pgACC) activity and pgACC-amygdala connectivity. These findings suggest that threat-anticipatory midbrain activity centred around the PAG supports decision-making by facilitating action preparation and highlight the role of the pgACC when switching from preparation to action. These results translate animal models of the neural switch from freeze-to-action. In addition, they reveal a core neural circuit for shooting performance under threat and provide empirical evidence for the role of defensive reactions such as freezing in subsequent action decision-making.","inCitations":["1903db89853ada990ab19c22e0a83025aa8870b3","beb1678613019cabc9b2519c154a5d2c6c963b15"],"pdfUrls":["https://repository.ubn.ru.nl/bitstream/handle/2066/201571/201571.pdf?sequence=1","https://pure.uva.nl/ws/files/35027188/s41598_019_40917_8.pdf","https://pure.uva.nl/ws/files/35027186/41598_2019_40917_MOESM1_ESM.pdf"],"title":"Neural Dynamics of Shooting Decisions and the Switch from Freeze to Fight","doi":"10.1038/s41598-019-40917-8","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-40917-8","venue":"Scientific Reports"}

Astrocytes were loaded with 2-[14C]DG-6-P by preincubation for 15 min in medium containing 2 mM glucose and 50 microM 2-deoxy[14C]glucose (2-[14C]DG). The medium was then replaced with identical medium including 2 mM glucose but lacking 2-[14C]DG, and incubation was resumed for 5 min to diminish residual free 2-[14C]DG levels in the cells by either efflux or phosphorylation. The medium was again replaced with fresh 2-[14C]DG-free medium, and the incubation was continued for 5, 15, or 30 min. Intracellular and extracellular 14C contents were measured at each time point, and the distribution of 14C between 2-[14C]DG and 2-[14C]DG-6-P was characterized by paper chromatography. The results showed little if any hydrolysis of 2-[14C]DG-6-P or export of free 2-[14C]DG from cells to medium; there were slightly increasing losses of 2-[14C]DG and 2-[14C]DG-6-P into the medium with increasing incubation time, but they were in the same proportions found in the cells, suggesting they were derived from nonadherent or broken cells. Experiments carried out with medium lacking glucose during the assay for 2-deoxyglucose-6-phosphatase activity yielded similar results. Evidence for G-6-Pase activity was also sought by following the selective detritiation of glucose from the 2-C position when astrocytes were incubated with [2-3H]glucose and [U-14C]glucose in the medium.

Hence, it does not require each sensor node to be carefully aligned to any one source and makes itself suited for mass-deployment applications such as precision agriculture and structural health monitoring. It harvests as much as 923 $\\mu \\text{W}$ on a rooftop at 1.54 km from an FM tower while retaining omnidirectionality partly thanks to the proposed antenna, which has a wider bandwidth and a higher measured gain (2.0 dBi) than the commercial reference wideband antenna. It achieves competitive efficiency (56%) and sensitivity (−17 dBm) while retaining wideband operation rather than being specifically optimized to individual frequencies. The system (fabricated on low-cost FR4) harvested outside ambient FM energy indoors at the same 1.54-km location to power a wireless sensor node without needing to shut down periodically.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"A Wideband, Quasi-Isotropic, Kilometer-Range FM Energy Harvester for Perpetual IoT","doi":"10.1109/LMWC.2019.2957653","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LMWC.2019.2957653","venue":"IEEE Microwave and Wireless Components Letters"}

The Western traditional ethics, however, pay more attention to the status and dignity of individuals, and advocate the self containing and independence of individual beings. The traditional Chinese ethics can well be summed up by the tendency of “highlighting collective interests and moral integrity at the negligence of individual ones”. In contrast, the West advocates the reasonable pursuit and possession of material interests. Though there are great differences between these two ethical traditions, both have contributed to the development of their own national history. Therefore, both of them can lend credence to us contemporaries.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Differences between Moral and Intellectual Cultural Traditions","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}
