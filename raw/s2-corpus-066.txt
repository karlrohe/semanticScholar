functioning and psychosocial factors in individuals with cervical radiculopathy (CR). Methods: Participants were 157 patients with CR. Also Study II included 33 asymptomatic age-and gender-matched controls. Study I, a prospective randomized controlled pilot trial, investigated outcomes after anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) with interbody cage with (n=17) or without (n=16) cervical collar in CR. In Study II and III, ventral and dorsal neck muscle fatigue was recorded with surface electromyography (EMG) during isometric endurance (NME) tests. Study II compared a CR group (n=46) with healthy controls (n=34). In Study III, results after neck-specific training or prescribed physical activity (n=50) were analyzed. Pain was estimated using visual analogue scales (VAS) and perceived fatigue rated with Borg CR-10 scales before, during and after the tests. Crosssectional, Study IV, identified dimensions underlying measures of impairments, disability, personal factors, and health status in patients with CR (n=124). Results: Study I, Both groups improved in all outcome measures, with a significant improvement from baseline to two years after surgery. Cervical collar worn for six weeks postoperatively, were associated with enhanced neck function and less neck pain even at long-term. Study II showed altered neck muscle endurance investigated with greater negative median frequency slope, variability, side imbalance, lower endurance time, and higher experience of fatigue among in the CR group compared to the healthy controls. Patients with CR had significantly shorter endurance time. In Study III, significant improvement in flexor NME was found after training, but with no difference between training groups. For the neckspecific training group only, there less activation of the splenius capitis during neck flexion after 14 weeks and one year, indicating reduced co-activation of the neck muscles. In Study IV, the PCA model provided three-components: Pain and functioning, Health, beliefs, and kinesiophobia, and Mood state and catastrophizing. These accounted for 73% of the cumulative percentages. Conclusions: Cervical collar post-surgery can help deal with initial post-operative pain and reduce disability. Shorter endurance and higher experience of fatigue was perceived among patients with CR compared to healthy subjects. Exercises increased flexor NME regardless of exercise group. The neck-specific group indicated reduced compensation of antagonist muscles during flexion contraction. To capture a broad picture of patients with CR pain, their functioning, fear avoidance beliefs, and anxiety are important factors in a clinical perspective.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://openarchive.ki.se/xmlui/bitstream/handle/10616/44808/Thesis_Marie_Halvorsen.pdf?isAllowed=y&sequence=1"],"title":"Pain related aspects of neck muscle performance, functioning and psychosocial factors in individuals with cervical radiculopathy","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Following a multi-scenario analysis that comprised of assessing empirical Vs estimation relations [including lithology, porosity (Ø), and volume of clay (Vsh)-based Vs estimation techniques], bivariate statistics, and machine learning, we found that the Greenberg & Castagna (1992) shale lithology constants yield Vs log estimates that best match the measured Montney Formation Vs in our study area, with a regional correlation coefficient of 0.8. We have therefore customized the Vs estimation method in our study to use the Greenberg & Castagna (1992) shale lithology constants. Our working method: •Improves the efficacy of Vs log estimation from Vp logs in the study area•Demonstrates the importance of calibrating empirical relations for Vs estimation to a specific formation, and•Provides a more accurate complementary Vs log dataset for subsequent regional reservoir characterization studies.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"A working method for estimating dynamic shear velocity in the montney formation","doi":"10.1016/j.mex.2019.08.013","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mex.2019.08.013","venue":"MethodsX"}

In this research, thermal behaviour of ground pine chip particles and ground pine pellet particles in the range of 0.25–5 mm was investigated. A single particle from ground pellets was almost 3 to 4 times denser than a single particle from ground chips at a similar size and volume of particle. Temperature was ramped up from room temperature (~25 °C) to 600 °C with heating rates of 10, 20, 30, and 50 °C/min. Pellet particles took 25–88 % longer time to dry than the chip particles. Microscopic examination of 3 mm and larger chip particles showed cracks during drying. No cracks were observed for pellet particles. The mass loss due to treatment at temperatures higher than 200 °C was about 80% both for chip and pellet particles. It took 4 min for chip and pellet particles to lose roughly 63% of their dry mass at a heating rate of 50 °C/min. The SEM structural analysis showed enlarged pores and cracks in cell walls of the pyrolyzed wood chips. As a result, these pores were not observed in pyrolyzed pellet particles.","inCitations":["6b668d603335fd32cc1cecf7deed71e65f3cf12c"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Pyrolysis of ground pine chip and ground pellet particles","doi":"10.1002/cjce.22574","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1002/cjce.22574","venue":""}

Fish with an initial weight of 15.0±1.4 g were reared in a static system and exposed to the total ammonia nitrogen (TAN) concentrations 5 or 10 mg L −1 for consecutive 70 days at 26±0.5°C. NADPH is mainly produced by glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH), 6- phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (6PGDH), and the cytosolic form of NADP-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH). These enzymes have been recently considered as an important factor in cellular defense against oxidative damage as they share in maintaining reduced glutathione (GSH) level. The activity of the enzymes G6PDH, 6PGDH, and cytosolic IDH in liver tissues of fish exposed to different concentrations of NH3 showed significant increase. The degree of increase in activity was positively related to ammonia concentration. The increased activity of these enzymes resulted in higher NADPH availability. This may be interpreted as a defense to maintain a high level of GSH against the expected oxidative stress in ammonia-exposed fish.","inCitations":["336b771343b76269e1c2449c4b276d6128f06aa2","b8abdc0077f0ff93163eb5909b282f919d3188c5","2cf22813d954172438d8620be6eecb9e4d434729","4004884d82d311681ca0cbbdbd3a6502346aa939","d4cde53de4f7ab1192e0de0d016ad4b3edd6cef4"],"pdfUrls":["http://ejabf.journals.ekb.eg/article_2073_d652f578d4a7c0f5ea3b08be33735010.pdf"],"title":"Effect of chronic exposure to sublethal of ammonia concentrations on NADP + -dependent dehydrogenases of Nile tilapia liver","doi":"10.21608/ejabf.2011.2073","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.21608/ejabf.2011.2073","venue":""}

These models have been generated primarily in the context of studies of autobiographical memory retrieval. Less research has focused on the existence and mechanisms of semantic confabulation. We examined whether confabulation extends to the semantic domain, and if so, whether it could be understood as a monitoring failure. We focus on post-retrieval monitoring by using a verification task that minimizes cue specification demands. We used the semantic illusion paradigm that elicits erroneous endorsement of misleading statements (e.g., \"Two animals of each kind were brought onto the Ark by Moses before the great flood\") even in controls, despite their knowing the correct answer (e.g., Noah). Monitoring demands were manipulated by varying semantic overlap between target and foils, ranging from high semantic overlap to unrelated. We found that semantic overlap modulated the magnitude of semantic illusion in all groups. Compared to controls, both confabulators and non-confabulators had greater difficulty monitoring semantically related foils; however, elevated endorsement of unrelated foils was unique to confabulators. We interpret our findings in the context of a two-process model of post-retrieval monitoring.","inCitations":["f68c85cb3d6184076b2d67fae71451120860cc89","36fcf3f98749aa6b78c56906cb54739132161939","ae70109d8cdc03edfcf8ca6d169badbd5fd96a31","4a754bf246feb50d20fad449ea727391d29c1212","9ae1bc0fa4c207f32334aa02b9afe1e5f0c3ad1a","dcfb81b2f3de0971ea938506e571cf65331baaf8"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.bu.edu/mdrc/files/2012/04/2010_Kan_JINS.pdf","http://www05.homepage.villanova.edu/irene.kan/papers/kan10_confab_moses.pdf"],"title":"Memory monitoring failure in confabulation: evidence from the semantic illusion paradigm.","doi":"10.1017/S1355617710000536","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1017/S1355617710000536","venue":"Journal of the International Neuropsychological Society : JINS"}

Design: Cross-sectional survey. Setting: A large pediatric tertiary care center. Subjects: Neonatal ICU and PICU health practitioners with at least 3 months of ICU experience. Interventions: A 41-item questionnaire examining moral distress, burnout, and uncertainty. Measurements and Main Results: The main outcome was moral distress measured with the Revised Moral Distress Scale. Secondary outcomes were frequency and intensity Revised Moral Distress Scale subscores, burnout measured with the Maslach Burnout Inventory depersonalization subscale, and uncertainty measured with questions adapted from Mishel’s Parent Perception of Uncertainty Scale. Linear regression models were used to examine associations between participant characteristics and the measures of moral distress, burnout, and uncertainty. Two-hundred six analyzable surveys were returned. The median Revised Moral Distress Scale score was 96.5 (interquartile range, 69–133), and 58% of respondents reported significant work-related moral distress. Revised Moral Distress Scale items involving end-of-life care and communication scored highest. Moral distress was positively associated with burnout (r2 = 0.27; p < 0.001) and uncertainty (r2 = 0.04; p = 0.008) and inversely associated with perceived hospital supportiveness (r2 = 0.18; p < 0.001). Nurses reported higher moral distress intensity than physicians (Revised Moral Distress Scale intensity subscores: 57.3 vs 44.7; p = 0.002). In nurses only, moral distress was positively associated with increasing years of ICU experience (p = 0.02) and uncertainty about whether their care was of benefit (r2 = 0.11; p < 0.001) and inversely associated with uncertainty about a child’s prognosis (r2 = 0.03; p = 0.03). Conclusions: In this single-center, cross-sectional study, we found that moral distress is present in PICU and neonatal ICU health practitioners and is correlated with burnout, uncertainty, and feeling unsupported.","inCitations":["ffb5e8ee1e96451ee8bda33d8712de62008bed28","e5ac5e1c86ccc4f364bb667022774169d2f732e6","bd8f8458a56b6b6396cf51ef43f6372d5ab2eb18","f02d7f6da63a292bc4817ac036409d7b821fb862","51b90a1bcf1b23ce41f293c9f74e851d4e5777ac","fdc611fa1d433740fcbd67ecf5ae527249510242","41c44a8fbf794d6bb50a870d153662005b3f0568","b95e7552c3d56b165ded338d418e63095620501f","1ad82678194ef4550f5f02e2facac173e9a3ee89","6cb206cfeb39fd815bc8fe7a5e1a4fbbd95cde6d","116ef3f25148786d59aa6239503fdc55b9021a8e","46bd2d36fede501a5ea79306c629cfa23499f00a","265ce0a42970fba7ea82956105061a585ce24445","c5bc72e665470be8f8e5d1e5e5f65da390e3a440"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Moral Distress in PICU and Neonatal ICU Practitioners: A Cross-Sectional Evaluation*","doi":"10.1097/PCC.0000000000001219","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1097/PCC.0000000000001219","venue":"Pediatric critical care medicine : a journal of the Society of Critical Care Medicine and the World Federation of Pediatric Intensive and Critical Care Societies"}

Here, we review a selection of published barcoding data sets to compare species discrimination in plants vs. animals. Although the use of different genetic markers, analytical methods and depths of taxon sampling may complicate comparisons, our results using common metrics demonstrate that the number of species supported as monophyletic using barcoding markers is higher in animals (> 90%) than plants (~70%), even after controlling for the amount of parsimony-informative information per species. This suggests that more than a simple lack of variability limits species discrimination in plants. Both animal and plant species pairs have variable size gaps between intra- and interspecific genetic distances, but animal species tend to have larger gaps than plants, even in relatively densely sampled genera. An analysis of 12 plant genera suggests that hybridization contributes significantly to variation in genetic discontinuity in plants. Barcoding success may be improved in some plant groups by careful choice of markers and appropriate sampling; however, overall fine-scale species discrimination in plants relative to animals may be inherently more difficult because of greater levels of gene-tree paraphyly.","inCitations":["fb21a32c9e613f09b11bfa0f678f2806ae84c87d","86fda936588ff011b6e4821c94e3bd3a3e6de75e","657376d5f98fb6af99af54d8e7b5b0635a0c434d","032c9b39a286c86afac8a149bcd70e0d718f1c53","affa3f1db36695743f7440f0b230513487d03517","c8345d9c084ed3a63c0cbfd12bbb3e9d68cd4f64","edb564c5673f3dcc37dd8fb1d52b50061fea733f","b32b525c0f3d43bb5fa5ab7282e4a61b845693e5","628e645eb5f160c4ab4f9c3150d9fc2f8bb75276","ba3a37d6494b808ba2ecb34513126611133781a7","ac4e7b4ce5752dac0b9f928b256e19aeedf29e6a","ffad6f1e255318172ba689649d3bd6712bc605e5","93842068bdb16a3c6a37539c4e3599cf5269bf2d","60d4a55b51625cd88af97ae06b1696d2fbe62c7b","1ef42f3a61a25877bb7f00797eb19d5c6001afb6","89aa723b090fec5f26a4900729655e09ea583211","9894648a49dedebb3c524f4359c4900fed71b09f","91c7647104456d88eed03763809a31a966e29cb3","b645f4fedcc142666fac9c0d20c7776082434d4a","3090206bec2a39f1586a6eda8923190c3b0e3edf","18647b9dc4d38fa749980d6ad07e4bc75a0854f1","0842b31c24ef42672fc1a550a29ab9749ae8c2b2","78d7d5ef5bd2b8012dc7171192e71e58e27e1f0f","06ab943d3fc0a9847d7006ccb934955489cdaa90","f4e447c63742cca3e9b34e15477eb153d06a1e21","c36ceb09d4c831ddabe4d6ddf3d0610850a2b385","6bc011f16bf2c0dbd602a10b05873487c4d7f681","f93396c0dd66454d925beb2ff687d4a0a9045103","1976a9fc6c7a4e5e32a1aa55266b2549fe8d5fcb","945d10a1fbd606d1aa16847877da9bed93a85a1b","eb8e091bfa3638e67110da50adc1e948d29240a6","4105e9e4173f6019a9198ba92cb47d26fe9f0cff","ee0a2c398e866b96167341866d7026ec7e5df04f","cd3c9218c11dd36abd72e769bc2fcc817f208fa2","8fc545dae172f0b961b44c712e5d002453dce7e2","8707134ec7a81325cd8c89c80daf047f42beaffb","48e93829f72a719ce48025c4b0247ff9c74394bc","339e8b40fb7c5209771e9e803e8494e3194cd070","392a8d61a51653c1f4f96e31b8df7d5b07fb273c","d1aefc452bb5a80fb701014231e34407ad346345","58fa40b6f099f92d26c8ea529bbe367ac01ffc6e","9aebfe1deb73d9ce9ea3865222af9b9e320b6afc","80bc6e7ad853e057e611ea3b319607fda284ef41","25fd9eb502a1b060dc0d11c2ce37641d029cbf4e","436288daec1475596049bd1889d4cbe5afd77cfa","0696d4bc672e9807f098c27cc152ac74592cd1e8","75bc1b9ed7de6443a4eb3186bcd1e244129777ca","b0afe5a80272f74e9ae5cc06547919cb42049d17","3852b17f75a53459c94ace5fcdcb80680d124984","f59db89c5d3dca5f8bdf49dd0bbf9c447803ff09","b862331ef6271d3a212c8c7de1a32f32c62b16d4","784b74c9bb682e8b0a5d8bea53e55e536a81e7db","ffe39a2ffd2ece4350c00e300f8864e2e8d55cd5","80477464482f5e3daff1e65fd0aac288d60bd763","b4c88a15ab8bcb7f23353600cf611339c904882c","2c19b3256e237187280f54faa5d9c169258c8419","1db3c8f06214e26eb3d697db3107024b2a06f691","8a59d4af39c2ddd1f7dfb06de1de44986b819d4c","4e4b8aae37b05f90691aa7023997e74c171b16ac","d42642c8f89b71e67c0d78ef5e74abe3004bc9d1","8079d1bf7b9ea91461ef448a32a2e0f8f6fed3c6","b7725a14a9eb51e2cd33361209799ff73fc5e636","54bdbb1486f8946631421d3e6767667896a29a14","c0d5d8e9708e8a902136938d06b04ace9a454536","bdcfd4e43cbe000c3346401ef6fd7069fee928d0","34e33bb211e31948f8c0e739a1d29e5dc976d0b5","744756a2abb09dec22d6dcc60a1bac72fe384e65","04a321374599f302fb5326fb88cf9b6be8fca129","f3ef125df299c2b69411a3cdf9674c2ffa982ce5","e66186baa6b9c02970ac10f5f2c56f1045e036dc","4b9d015acabfbf1b90884417b84be76329cd980d","846fe83745bf275a4f7eb310842d024171207b8e","37df3f67682f1fb1bf5696ff371932401def455d","b2874b11f797eba00133aec59ee51efae4c6adc2","b2197f363a0bb9901a92f4a5312456fd3400da35","7951fbfcb3901d841a7bda19686fa95514e003eb","a3c461565c2420a8f247bd9ee680c628f4e00e5f","fcddcc2ee7c4760dd2d55c50abbcce79e56d79f5","c9ee0010e948be3b7b9cdcb1275c2fd079829119","2a707a4ba38e6aac4f9f22468afe46949771d4b6","f272e65cef104d0294f3a4b54b9d74e093aff622","e64fae3bf3c97f5397e75eded07022a86478b44e","b29eed1d1d7f2855093317559a04a18f820501cc","1c1a101c0a545f5f06b38ed296fe5e3f755ceb02","f822f86ced97b6e880e96bb058cb7271e65f50bb","bbcec81e660701470c65bda7466143dbb687d013","cc98963c5b6f078596dbea09cc4ea0086f3de997","70fd713fdbb2c7ba60ac262450620de48615c688","3686deb8f3dc806b875c0d94360afce301560d87","064fa59c17636eb084211edd2f35b038e84b7bf9","9a2f159a27dce7772568105edda08db5bea16140","36bb4f41c8e3b8ac8b2b9041cfd3a6efdb3cdbd9","a093751a23d02bd0c427b426d202e028db701455","e85718ff7df922919e08f49b083937c333a05b87","d65eb18136372d0b6be9aa5ea658ddac847bcfd5","aad2d01c1071cf52ca666a2e3ea5da4959acc473","1468e02fd4fad95b6966ab2b2aebac48aa895bca","6dfdcb8d4968043de11fcd3037f5fc519d7db600","9aa5c086daffe658e50d630ecbe27b5e5f49aec0","21ff0999e257fed8e2944dca6456d3e0a45512ef","a64b5f2242a0c568d4930e5b4674646fc7285ef4","7438d7400b4039f647e0fb6affb49e06274a21f1","3fe8e64ed8216ec0f23d4207c5a28fede2692896","aea9ea34186dbc5434e33d8f5062e7143f7d0795","2e735c1065cdab76c497b0420d7d8b96476190df","2430a6e4ed513bd8109e25e06bdf78f4f957b88a","32df94993ffe4b793e0d786e3f7f2554946d3b16","cbcd2d37487c39cb409b5a8ff9072cb4039655ce","8a18d6415ae7e60a28d0a160cdd9a08670a878b0","dbc8814d2fe50e3e2f668222b3e608bf15e1403d","ad24b6ad7f39763967f2dee3acd49863b1b66e9f","f94a6be9acdb1eac671ee0da880610d63dbb94b6","8ec2871b605af71b12dec6ead56026a55e0268a6","a9f19a329bd0801aad8d0e83d767956a3fd38d6b","f40e924595eca8d2506ba1ab38e1c698d2cf62ca","1836e53e6433e099bc10105d32b

The relative importance of each mechanism in controlling organelle dynamics remains controversial, in particular for transport through the Golgi apparatus. Using a stochastic model, we identify two classes of dynamical behavior that can lead to full maturation of membrane-bound compartments. In the first class, maturation corresponds to the stochastic escape from a steady state in which export is dominated by vesicular exchange, and is very unlikely for large compartments. In the second class, it occurs in a quasi-deterministic fashion and is almost size independent. Whether a system belongs to the first or second class is largely controlled by homotypic fusion.","inCitations":["b611faa00a2370b3510c9b6e5d7c242e6b363f85"],"pdfUrls":["https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.01075v1.pdf","http://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.01075v1.pdf","http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1606.01075"],"title":"Stochastic Model of Maturation and Vesicular Exchange in Cellular Organelles.","doi":"10.1016/j.bpj.2017.12.018","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bpj.2017.12.018","venue":"Biophysical journal"}

Although a high aspect ratio swept blade can be designed to achieve the same pressure distribution as an unswept design, this paper shows that the swept blade will inevitably have a higher profile loss. A modified Zweifel loading parameter, taking sweep into account, is first derived. If this loading coefficient is held constant, it is shown that sweep reduces the required pitch-to-chord ratio and thus increases the wetted area of the blades. Assuming fully turbulent boundary layers and a constant dissipation coefficient, the effect of sweep on profile loss is then estimated. A combination of increased blade area and a raised pressure surface velocity means that the profile loss rises with increasing sweep. The theory is then validated using experimental results from two linear cascade tests of highly loaded blade profiles of the type found in low-pressure aeroengine turbines: one cascade is unswept, the other has 45 deg of sweep. The swept cascade is designed to perform the same duty with the same loading coefficient and pressure distribution as the unswept case. The measurements show that the simple method used to estimate the change in profile loss due to sweep is sufficiently accurate to be a useful aid in turbine design.","inCitations":["8c53a2b484d17e0bf2fce0ac2c4058237dcd89e1","dd0108b4c615190398a7d6b8c6fa53db1167e4dd","4b9fc2bf9a7647ecc0cf6ea62d5af089a47da20f","1c99e47a71af0350b8b3382baa9bd5f0c35f7374","7e91d97f985c62d35d59ba200c4fbeed1200c40e","2fc6224deac07d4ed78e70b09993e70b92b6227f","5dd60d56f7e081f9a87f138e5328807a34d7e1cc","8fcb41c8ceaa82e0dddda011643ac066bbdb9a10","a4cd882f607d77d8de9d300c56a1d280cb7c3908","233e088a7b138e227345e8995517bfe7c1742501","807cd2990a37572ffc769fd5afb0ef138b744a4d","e9f9bf44960c11633e07f9cf202387da1061d30f"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Influence of Sweep on Axial Flow Turbine Aerodynamics at Midspan","doi":"10.1115/1.2472397","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1115/1.2472397","venue":""}

This process of antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) against tumor cells is triggered by the interaction of the fragment crystallizable (Fc) portion of the mAb with the Fc receptors on effector cells like natural killer cells, macrophages, γδ T cells, and dendritic cells. By augmenting ADCC, the antitumor activity of mAbs can be significantly increased. Currently, identifying and developing therapeutic agents that enhance ADCC is a growing area of research. Combining existing tumor-targeting mAbs and ADCC-promoting agents that stimulate effector cells will translate to greater clinical responses. In this review, we discuss strategies for enhancing ADCC and emphasize the potential of combination treatments that include US Food and Drug Administration-approved mAbs and immunostimulatory therapeutics.","inCitations":["f9480faa407ca079108a990ab665c0046cd526d0","29b0d1fa9923cb17da9ac0d4e44b37ddf2d1d108","083ecfbfed779d94061119832a23677dfa85dbde","207420985ba0a65b1a74e9491c68786906bff69d","46c1a7f69361b4997782b435c0cf520feb4d43ad","d4422f4a116b0bb4ef41273420b2caa49813eb1b","04c8b5cb580d8d3b17d52d953da5967a9c7aeda0","9d7980847d45e8014d7ee62490fd31e6d547e80d","e364e15f1f74186589c9c569ed6af9a50503cf86","de3eebab243428bfe34387ff3d72885141106999","f5c93db8bc712570d5c195c57ce15f76c96f36f0","a735a91f1a7b5487710cb63cd3d9b0d5bc2e91a6","df2e44e5152f8ca276cc810cb9b5bf457e6427bc","b9d967c9c515eb30b6f150f1b859d66083dd893a","5d5c594f20b7167171bd77748e99f178e406ef16","f6d2d7f1a9b04d577ff00b29d87770478e1af696","f8b76e11e4f6a274626d3a5f0c050691b5f32f69"],"pdfUrls":["https://www.dovepress.com/getfile.php?fileID=25056"],"title":"Enhancement of antibody-dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity: a new era in cancer treatment","doi":"10.2147/ITT.S61292","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.2147/ITT.S61292","venue":"ImmunoTargets and therapy"}

Then she presented with low progressive hyposthenia at four limbs and cognitive impairment, sudden facial right peripheral palsy and complete left abducent palsy. The authors performed brain and spinal MRI, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis and extensive haematological examinations for infections, autoimmune and neoplastic diseases. All the results were not diagnostic. Only repeating for the third time a spinal tap, CSF presented neoplastic B cells suggestive for large B-NHL. The authors diagnosed primary NL. The patient was treated with R-CHOP but she died 2 months later. In front of rapidly progressive neuropathy, a NL has to be considered performing different examinations, especially and repeating them after a short period.","inCitations":["df48f1bc19472238a5d00ffd1743c5d8716e517c","bffbfdcdb889cc690fd342df61f83b63185ced43"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"A case of cranial multinevritis: from the onset to the diagnosis of primary neurolymphomatosis.","doi":"10.1136/bcr.06.2011.4299","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1136/bcr.06.2011.4299","venue":"BMJ case reports"}

Pachepsky","ids":["2190955"]}],"journalName":"Soil Science","paperAbstract":"The objective of this study was to develop and evaluate a simple field method to determine unsaturated hydraulic conductivities using measurements of water flux into a tensiometer. The tensiometer consists of a ceramic cup glued to one end of a piece of plastic tubing. A suction is first applied to the inside of the tensiometer, which is closed to the atmosphere. The reduced pressure in the tensiometer causes water to flow into the tensiometer from the soil. As the water flows into the tensiometer, the volume of air in the tensiometer decreases, and pressure increases. The rate of water flow into the tensiometer, water flux, is calculated from the measured pressures using a form of the ideal gas equation, PV = Constant, and its full differential, PdV/dt+VdP/dt = 0, where P is the measured pressure, and V is volume. The water flux is obtained from the change in volume with time, -dV/dt. The parameters for the unsaturated conductivity equation are determined by using a two-dimensional finite element soil model (2DSOIL) coupled with a Marquardt-Levenberg algorithm to fit calculated fluxes to measured ones. For comparison purposes, unsaturated hydraulic conductivities were also determined for the same soil within 25-cm-diameter rings from measured water contents and matric potentials during drainage for two locations. Fitted and measured fluxes agreed well. Unsaturated hydraulic conductivities obtained from the tensiometer inflow data, however, were much less than unsaturated hydraulic conductivities measured during drainage. We attributed the differences to anisotropy and scale effects although clogging of the tensiometer pores by fine soil material could also be a contributing factor. The method is relatively quick, uses inexpensive materials, provides consistent results and is not limited greatly by the conductivity of the cup.","inCitations":["802d06e29ae72be3bc377e9c3ff932e5aa564243","2c78862e491c5a907712525f303dd276b594c192","b83d2d10817739f99442961298ff8fad640b50dd","c743c94869f0f22ab6d155e0c524efdacf2c8cca","7ad0ae2a73aa0f1f3aafdb8d433f45f0ceac5b0e","cf909fb7800d3fa8a9b90691d67629a077405367","7adc40a123dd814141361c67508071bc2d01f51a"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Measurement of unsaturated soil hydraulic conductivities using a ceramic cup tensiometer","doi":"10.1097/00010694-199808000-00003","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1097/00010694-199808000-00003","venue":""}

The Sleipner storage site, offshore Norway, is the world's first and largest engineered waste repository for a greenhouse gas. CO 2 is separated from the Sleipner gas condensate field and stored in the pore space of the Utsira Formation, a saline aquifer approximately 1 km below the surface and 200 km from the coast. Statoil, the field operator, has injected almost 1 Mt/yr of captured CO 2 into the storage site since 1996. The buoyant CO 2 plume ascended rapidly through eight thin shale barriers within the aquifer to reach the top seal in less than three years. The plume's progress has been monitored by eight seismic surveys, as well as gravimetric and electromagnetic monitoring, which record the spreading of nine thin CO 2 layers. This paper presents a capillary flow model using invasion percolation physics that accurately matches the plume's geometry. The approach differs from standard Darcy flow simulations, which fail to match the plume geometry. The calibrated capillary flow simulation indicates that a mass balance for the plume is likely, but can only replicate the plume geometry if the thin intra-formational shale barriers are fractured. The model enables an estimate of the shale barrier behavior and caprock performance. The fractures are very unlikely to have been caused by CO 2 injection given the confining stress of the rock and weak overpressure of the plume, and so fracturing must pre-date injection. A novel mechanism is suggested: the deglaciation of regional ice sheets that have rapidly and repeatedly unloaded approximately 1 km of ice. The induced transient pore pressures are sufficient to hydro-fracture thin shales. The fractures enable fast CO 2 ascent, resulting in a multi-layered plume. Shallow CO 2 storage sites in the Northern North Sea and other regions that have been loaded by Quaternary ice sheets are likely to behave in a similar manner.","inCitations":["7b42c2e80723eebcdb4ac1827feed0fe636fa1b1","442dc4c8a063e4b42787b8da53f24c8dc06d2d3e","3d744bd391d8f4556728079f40d48c4a366c2f56","b627f026f168afc53017b38970b3622b6249c20b","b19bb9edc096bf4beb23a66cdb29cfcd0ceaea87","a8a9d9b988515b32d882cb72e762878842afd3f8","8933995db2ceb74d2b8903b7d997f82a497f4021","8c1eebd4eb9e5dde76f73ab85fb6fd4907a99baf","a47a7e3dc889a119fd100856c81a8ae9c3a1f590","68b95f402c9019af04d963e842a9c7f9bc1e5585","a646047e6d828d924105da303ba339150b9034f9","b25302fc8a7d9bb115dcecf8bd59793af986e1c7","64241088b1dd390bb68c6397f9e78865bdd45df2","64214d0fbc961029863d26ea345e1cb556382da8","84e4002e209ccd69a8bd70d70df272ae7244900f","981ce43b11049adc23d7d3c871e745c296a852f0","4b5877e8066a2a5ef6be8b2e0a46708d30525638","c43bad506345e2dded0b973bea957c1864d144b9","57a21df7f2f528b769e90631e8a8de6941763cb1","02b7784b8793b5fae77d6fc850e08a7a60d1e97f","5eb1cfcf6086ed4b60d962107f3a829db38434cf","4145464fe19c0c516316b3f185a7b09b7c128919","2e5628edc1d5b7b22a44f571660db240b1f9ae82","49f5e2d8f7bcc20ace20c422d64a78198f42b138","ae333f02a329dd195264e2df0562491ec278919a","7554184b183c6ee0c3c803dcd6b51c7c20f915a8"],"pdfUrls":["https://www.research.ed.ac.uk/portal/files/14859363/Cavanagh_Haszeldine_IJGGC_2014.pdf"],"title":"The Sleipner storage site: Capillary flow modeling of a layered CO2 plume requires fractured shale barriers within the Utsira Formation","doi":"10.1016/j.ijggc.2013.11.017","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijggc.2013.11.017","venue":""}

First, an analytic expression of the erasure probability of punctured recursive systematic convolutional codes is derived. This expression will then be used to study the density evolution of turbo codes over the binary erasure channel, that will allow for the design of capacity-approaching infinite-length irregular turbo codes. Next, a graph-optimal interleaver for finite-length irregular turbo codes is proposed. Finally, simulation results for different coding rates are shown.","inCitations":["4a78ae81df2587810a43ac9bc76b76b7ad0a76e6","6cc3d8822f0afae865db8326daa1db8dd26fb350","b2aa4bee540bc3794301559edfe8e3fb8c254c7c","aa457405ad994621ab14742862b054b3d2fb0333","88d82c44c83dddfd05fce73b2aeafbb162dc0f6e","5adf0f156c67fdcb3e79f0f44666d6aebec698a6"],"pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2010.09.080325"],"title":"Capacity-Approaching Irregular Turbo Codes for the Binary Erasure Channel","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2010.09.080325","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2010.09.080325","venue":"IEEE Transactions on Communications"}

Throughout this book I work with empirical material from the Scottish NHS as a case study of how participation has been attempted in practice, across one health system. This is not because Scotland is an outlier, taking a particularly radical, effective (or indeed, ineffective) approach to the challenges of ‘doing’ participation. It is partly a function of the unusual breadth of empirical data I accumulated (working alone, or with colleagues) in Scotland between 2009 and 2014, ranging from interviews with ‘ordinary’ citizens and frontline staff to senior civil servants and managers. However, it is also an intellectual choice, because in the 15 years since devolution, the Scottish health system had been in an unusual state of flux, in which the path dependency which shapes so much of day-to-day policy in most health systems (Greener, 2002) was, if not negated, at least called into question. As successive administrations have sought to define a way forward for the NHS in Scotland (and in the case of the Scottish National Party administrations from 2007 onwards, to define a way forward which breaks with the past and current status quo elsewhere in the UK) an eclectic and at times downright contradictory set of policy tools as evolved.","inCitations":["3fe36efc761a77fb6f845c51509de63878928252"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Scotland’s NHS: Citizen Participation and Mutuality in Scottish Health Policy","doi":"10.1007/978-1-137-46717-1_2","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-137-46717-1_2","venue":""}

In the present review, we discuss target genes, target gene functions, the potential regulatory role of miRNAs in periodontal tissues, and the potential role of miRNAs as biomarkers and therapeutics. In periodontal disease, miRNAs exert control over all aspects of innate and adaptive immunity, including the functions of neutrophils, macrophages, dendritic cells and T and B cells. Previous human studies have highlighted some key miRNAs that are dysregulated in periodontitis patients. In the present study, we mapped the major miRNAs that were altered in our reproducible periodontitis mouse model relative to control animals. The miRNAs that were upregulated as a result of periodontal disease in both human and mouse studies included miR-15a, miR-29b, miR-125a, miR-146a, miR-148/148a and miR-223, whereas miR-92 was downregulated. The association of individual miRNAs with unique aspects of periodontal disease and their stability in gingival crevicular fluid underscores their potential as markers for periodontal disease progression or healthy restitution. Moreover, miRNA therapeutics hold great promise for the future of periodontal therapy because of their ability to modulate the immune response to infection when applied in conjunction with synthetic antagomirs and/or relatively straightforward delivery strategies.","inCitations":["9f3a97dace33f0f852c06a585c9c47e2d196340f","ea858c63e540b3782e12ac0aa3419652c0e42a58","ab985766697fd5fe7ebbe47cea98a00dc9b612e4","7ff8f7e415ce3ec8e193db08b2281b4a4f35cce2","767d944e7a85c68102fdf81ce68520339c780a89","512209d683b0234943e29ce61380b658207fc70b","e362c26fd0f3d9d933527d5885f7505e159aad8c","6172ace8bd752e883d853331c77d1ddff78a392d","bb414d72db1ad92fa4876c59283a0a9a88ed0a74"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"MicroRNAs and immunity in periodontal health and disease","doi":"10.1038/s41368-018-0025-y","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41368-018-0025-y","venue":"International Journal of Oral Science"}

All physicochemical parameters were affected by the addition of pork backfat in both types of sausages. Sausages manufactured with 30% of pork backfat showed the lowest moisture and protein contents and the highest total fat content. The lower a(w) values in sausages manufactured with higher fat content while in pH happened the reverse situation. The addition of pork backfat modified the total fatty acid profile, prompting a significant drop in the relative percentages of C14:0, C16:0, C17:0, C17:1, C18:0 and TVA (trans-vaccenic acid), together with a marked increase in oleic and linoleic acids.

Three eyes were phtihisical, 1 microphthalmic, 1 buphthalmic, 1 a secondary implant following conventional evisceration and 4 non-phtihisical painful eyes. The technique involved enucleation followed by evisceration of the eye contents. Implants, either coral or acrylic, were wrapped in the eviscerated sclera and replaced in the orbit with the posterior pole of the sclera facing anteriorly. The rectus muscles were then resutured onto the sclera. The patients were subsequently recalled and volume replacement, cosmesis and complications were assessed.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThree coral and 7 acrylic implants were placed, 2 of 22 mm, 7 of 20 mm and 1 of 18 mm. No complications were encountered, in particular no implant extrusions. Cosmesis was graded good in 9 out of 10 patients.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nCombined enucleation and evisceration allows the selection and placement of an appropriately large-sized implant to achieve good volume replacement with no extrusions in our series. This technique is particularly pertinent as an alternative to standard evisceration in phtihisical eyes.","inCitations":["0322d52cc68651b6a8e26a1c8fcdbe9d4b176b4b","b2dccf8462b3a0a3c223e841fd9b6b40aa215505","5b13dae68025f0f14a5d7cd2ddb1607359bb8fa7","e9707857e77f2f12fb5055c74287131eb99cdd63","2d270ebe080b85b5bb6022e1d636b4340c72bd0f","52c82f75c1b1baa94eadee645b58ba87fb435d88"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Enucleation with reverse replacement of sclera as an alternative to conventional evisceration.","doi":"10.1080/01676830590894671","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1080/01676830590894671","venue":"Orbit"}

On the other hand, prostate cancer is a hormone-dependent malignant tumor like breast cancer, it has been reported that chemotherapy is more likely to be effective if there is an abnormality in androgen-receptor splice variant-7 (AR-V7). In an immunohistochemical study, as well, AR-V7 expression was reportedly a poor prognostic factor in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). In this study, we investigated the association between chemotherapy sensitivity and AR-V7 expression in patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) using standardized chemotherapy criteria and regimens. Materials and Methods: A total of 177 patients with resectable early-stage breast cancer were treated with NAC. ER, PgR, HER2, Ki67 and AR-V7 status were assessed immunohistochemically. Results: In the 43 AR-V7 expression positive group, compared to the 133 negative group, TNBC (p Conclusion: These findings show that AR-V7 expression is a therapeutic effect predictive marker in BCNAC, and indicates particularly high chemotherapy sensitivity in TNBC.

The results of these studies were correlated with clinical results of surgery, which were classified as poor, fair, good, or excellent at follow-up MR imaging. In 10 TMJs (eight patients [40%]) the clinical results were excellent or good; in 15 TMJs (12 patients [60%]), fair or poor. The position of the disk relative to its preoperative position was a good discriminator in determination of the clinical success of meniscoplasty. After surgery, in all patients with good or excellent results, the disks appeared to be in a normal or an improved position compared with that prior to surgery; in those with poor or fair results, the TMJs had anteriorly dislocated disks that showed no improvement.","inCitations":["c60328173de54cf854d3ae10c7f7fabe08d4b770","1a8c34a00ab3463bacae485760c6e0f662e0ceec","3da91d04430712b81fab16c983d344d25e12307c","528ff534e9de7111f283e7f18bc25f77f9a759cb","4a8881db07b959c2e19f6a70c8b85bb213bda452","011ccd47b07caceca6e70925e7e9df0fbffffbcc"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Temporomandibular joint after meniscoplasty: appearance at MR imaging.","doi":"10.1148/radiology.180.3.1871289","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1148/radiology.180.3.1871289","venue":"Radiology"}

Male Sprague-Dawley rats received a single dose of DEP (5 mg/kg), carbon black (CB, 5 mg/kg), or saline intratracheally. Three days later, the rats were inoculated intratracheally with approximately 5,000 Listeria monocytogenes and sacrificed at 3, 5, and 7 days postinfection, and we determined the number of viable Listeria in the left lobe of lungs. The remaining lungs underwent bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and the retrieved BAL cells were identified and counted. Luminol-dependent chemiluminescence, a measure of reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation, generated by BAL cells was monitored and the levels of nitric oxide and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-[alpha] produced by macrophages in culture were determined. At 7 days postinfection, we excised the lung-draining lymph nodes and phenotyped the lymphocyte subpopulations. Exposure of rats to DEP, but not to CB, decreased the clearance of Listeria from the lungs. Listeria-induced generation of luminol-dependent chemiluminescence by pulmonary phagocytes decreased by exposure to DEP but not CB. Similarly, Listeria-induced production of NO by alveolar macrophages was negated at 3, 5, and 7 days after inoculation in DEP-exposed rats. In contrast, CB exposure had no effect on Listeria-induced NO production at 3 days after infection and had a substantially smaller effect than DEP at later days. Exposure to DEP or CB resulted in enlarged lung-draining lymph nodes and increased the number and percentage of CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells. These results showed that exposure to DEP decreased the ability of macrophages to produce antimicrobial oxidants in response to Listeria, which may play a role in the increased susceptibility of rats to pulmonary infection. This DEP-induced suppression is caused partially by chemicals adsorbed onto the carbon core of DEP, because impaired macrophage function and decreased Listeria clearance were not observed following exposure to CB.","inCitations":["a967735fdc10933b66308eea3c59b391d28ca964","339c9b1d26108b298ef08d0102b7578409c6f760","cbf4c7c3d748052aa16830226070ae867c205670","06ae48c13318555afc3d9a019241883fdd25de70","b8d3ef68d3aebab3d3ff099d10db4b494a92e9e9","2977d8bf89eaa94f0aa30ee9fa0b4b5d0c84ffc3","1457d8e45d63a4c6ca7c499c03aa9b0a27755cb4","ccfcc2f14bdc81e5d38b882d2ed803afc4793b0f","ab4781f14a89f776b74fc2e98cb2b2390a8b38c0","d6dfb1cd9db6f9607593f08e60ccd39f59f432b2","6fb92a8e6309ad99c3580d41bcff2ed5621bcf33","deab18634665adc8796207fdbb12345c99e49e6b","c51342afac1380c97705b7a316c7ceb16f6d0104","15a5a3fb03d284c51be33af4c9b02ff5706befad","92b678f85735d2cb9d7302f7270f63e607702d6d","76c43d4393d5f46bbed79ed996bbd24e162b2afc","f605ad7fb490ace94c17fc6a35572779d78b5ddb","c046769ac38bbd8bb6a15f6287170cb009f85425","12c66029e1f3ff6ed66322cf2d486524735c5df8","acd5adaaa4bee05b74d73b0f2cc546ad5a9de2c6","03115c06fc778956234777c54bbb8a489f839efb","89a075c2387adb365b8f762a07e508f07e265af5","251985639f69760509c6a44aa0970f6ceb9c9b81","505c8638b5edd7a962eb9eb1eddc3b1661a7b43d","974cd21e8e7309b284162c28af43a40497184a69","6b0038b251bf543b1a28b90a5e8e306ba44b3043","6d03a2df8018ddc9c6097ce5dd60d2a8efa696d2","f492301562b50e0232ee01eb3b9e9fffd78912c4","564de3f97d0eccd3fc509492edf4fd86ae3f966e","a737d92d98b2218540bc46647a6b32dcb7cdb324","e0433862fb0afbe0d7e41a04a751000e1133ab68","b7e56cf9651a9e031aa7f170fd192a69a369423b","04dfb3923af030a861ab4759698e0f9abba08e84","441475b243fa200f83b740c65ccb66b223a57790","01ecbbd4be5386f82165ade5d47bee121165b0d3","e35073ddcc739529033ad7b25d89fb0a3378edb6","5db1d263c3f40950ea17dc74f85334b03ac84d32","927fbb8393c5d885b0603a25253759bf8f304990","9f0684603dc7231b6b5dec98e41365291db3b5ae","3cd9e368626b846b47ea68cc459c3419a8784d35","6fd514893d623a9a711f45a9eee5d92e4b19945c","de9bc82f4451f569bb1315af602fe12dce41bc06","cf8069960ac9181870a9d71fdf437628e5792280","362f2af92efd146b9aa571214eb25bbb020f2048","eda4bfde76446280467c26ccaa57431bf91b28b1","c47fb18e54675cb2416089f786692b8b10410fb4","1a7ef5b9c6939dc6590d3b14cc3fd6c30976ca6e","33e17926db59104eb22364a239bde6b9c4c9aee6","be83c814d372117d186c5506f121aad0987ce66a","4dad7a752b5762e7861a6b85220936caf1f51fed","91f9709793bb85fac01df80a11ad484b3b0888c7","ad6b13c1fe448f423de9b8ff67d69d4df351f051","1eadaa67b04d0c52339ecd88f18169626eeb6bf6","fc59e3ab034833c2192fa9194e64994706ea4581","14d079b76fabbe22d3096f4af05cd43345ac76c2","de7860686509c906ae0635650002251030548e57","bed8a833c8eca36a996a3c269ed43023265c447f","4e4da81ee301909a64dcc816260af0a438f14190","6a065a299b97fd5de9407cb0ea8f31dc1d6e7849","b5c5c906685aef394b0fb6c2f205ddaff58dfb21"],"pdfUrls":["https://p2infohouse.org/ref/52/51588.pdf","ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/pmc/28/2d/Environ_Health_Perspect_2001_May_109(5)_515-521.tar.gz"],"title":"Diesel exhaust particles suppress macrophage function and slow the pulmonary clearance of Listeria monocytogenes in rats.","doi":"10.1289/ehp.01109515","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1289/ehp.01109515","venue":"Environmental health perspectives"}

This Essay uses the publication of Naomi Cahn’s book, Test Tube Families, which advocates both the adoption of a comprehensive regime and the anonymity prohibition, as a lens through which to assess the suitability of these regulatory trends to the United States. First, this Essay develops two dimensions of law and technology theory – timing and uncertainty – to evaluate the effectiveness of adopting a comprehensive regulatory regime. This Essay argues that although belated regulation of a new technology may incur enforcement hurdles due to the entrenchment of social norms, these hurdles are alleviated when, as in the case of ART, the technology is administered by intermediaries. This Essay then distinguishes between two ultimate goals of reducing uncertainty surrounding the use of new technologies: alleviating fears that inhibit the adoption of a new technology and protecting individuals already using a widely adopted technology from unexpected legal circumstances. It argues that the adoption of a comprehensive regulatory regime for ART will relieve the latter type of uncertainty. Secondly, the Essay examines the effects of the prohibition on gamete donor anonymity on the availability of donor gametes and the consequent social adoption of ART technology that is dependent on donor gametes. The Essay analyzes the data from three representative jurisdictions that prohibit anonymity: Sweden, Victoria (Australia), and the United Kingdom. It reveals that these jurisdictions suffer from significant shortages in donor gametes and underscores that efforts to combat these shortages resulted in eroding commitments to equality and the prevention of commodification. The Essay, therefore, cautions against the adoption of a prohibition on donor gamete anonymity in the United States.","inCitations":["a5a83d503060bc42e613ed361beede676ca6d5fa","9fe5a41de47b3452cf1a78bac0f1a1a248fa0ca3","fc277f2e9fc25e9ffca2c6aa35e621bcc979e6b7","c881847d527641ae762d19045a51f805d845a8ce","cda28808f3598e2a910e650d745e20418394baea","13198697d293697f4ed0a210eda57f559784f51e"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.bu.edu/law/journals-archive/bulr/documents/bernstein.pdf"],"title":"Regulating Reproductive Technologies: Timing, Uncertainty and Donor Anonymity","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Borggaard","ids":["6386823"]}],"journalName":"","paperAbstract":"Glyphosate is worldwide the most used herbicide because it is an efficient weed killer with favorable environmental and toxicological properties such as very low human and animal toxicity. Chemically, glyphosate is a phosphonate, i.e. it resembles phosphate. Consequently, glyphosate is strongly sorbed by the same soil minerals as phosphate, especially aluminium and iron oxides, allophane/imogolite and other variable charge minerals, whereas sorption by 2:1-layer silicates is modest. However, this similarity between the two compounds indicates that phosphate may affect glyphosate sorption and degradation. Therefore, phosphate may affect the leachability of glyphosate and, in turn, the risk of groundwater contamination with this xenobioticum. Although the effect of phosphate on glyphosate sorption was pointed out shortly after the introduction of the herbicide in 1974, much is still unclear about interactions between glyphosate and phosphate. Therefore, it has been attempted to summarize available knowledge on influence of phosphate on sorption and degradation of glyphosate and its main metabolite, aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA) at different scales from the isolated mineral to the field level. The summary has shown that the interaction between glyphosate and phosphate can exhibit great variation from mineral to mineral and from soil to soil according to investigations in several laboratories. Phosphate has been shown to suppress glyphosate sorption by some minerals and soils but for most minerals and soils the effect is limited or even absent. This discrepancy has been interpreted as existence of two kinds of sorption sites including common sites subject to glyphosate-phosphate competition and to sites specific for either glyphosate or phosphate, where the two sorbates are sorbed independently of each other (additive sorption). Phosphate seems to have a positive effect on glyphosate degradation in some soils but no or little effect in other soils. Transport of presumably colloid-bonded glyphosate and AMPA in structured clayey soils with macropores has been demonstrated both in several lysimeter studies and few field trials; the leaching is augmented by heavy rainfall shortly after glyphosate application. However, the role of phosphorus in this transport has not been investigated. In sandy soils without macropores, glyphosate and AMPA do not seem to leach. \nThese results are in agreement with those of a Danish field trial, where concentrations of glyphosate and AMPA in soil samples and leachates were monitored during the year following glyphosate application to plots on a flat sandy soil that have received different amounts of phosphorus (and lime) since 1944. This trial showed that less than 0.1 g/ha corresponding to 0.013 % of applied glyphosate was translocated during the monitoring period and the leachate concentrations of glyphosate and AMPA were less than the EU drinking water threshold, 0.1 μg/L and often below the detection limit (0.01 μg/L). The contents of glyphosate and AMPA in the soil samples did not change significantly during the monitoring period, except for decreasing glyphosate content in the samples from one of the four plots investigated, but this decrease was ascribed to favorable pH conditions for the microbial degraders because of liming. The very limited translocation of glyphosate and AMPA found in the leachate and subsoil during the monitoring was attributed to transport by the plants as also seen in other investigations. Therefore, a main conclusion of this trial was that the soil phosphorus status did not influence glyphosate and AMPA dissipation at that site.","inCitations":["68279b4bca6d61edf856e313fbe4fa747347ace7","52a9670e1a8de84bb5a189c653a5880aea82d113","db9813a6b2260bea9fe4cbfcf1b0fe05f3cac53d","549e9f8b72e343590584a42ba5ff00bb729285ed","9a2e3b5cfca8ea64c1792a83af075d4e376f20bd","91e23e8280cc13108e6fc9855fbb803120b48ff8","d1cb70a5a6398553f00670f59850d8e13590cb17","df838f429c5904f9ac3afbe46864dd9d8b113636","88855268dee82d6bd1a780cd15d8bcd9f12ca18e"],"pdfUrls":["http://asciencejournal.net/asj/index.php/tspn/article/download/193/pdf_46"],"title":"Does Phosphate Affect Soil Sorption and Degradation of Glyphosate? - A Review","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}
