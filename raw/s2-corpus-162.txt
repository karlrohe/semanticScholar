Il s'agit de faire dialoguer poetiquement l'orient et l'occident sur le theme de l'amour fou, a partir de la legende arabe de Majnoun Layla (Le Fou de Layla) et de l'âge d'or andalous. Louis Aragon dira lui-meme que \"la poesie arabe est le plus souvent l'illustration d'un commentaire en prose ou d'un traite de poetique\" (Le Fou d'Elsa, poeme, Editions Gallimard, 1963, p. 16). La visee poetique donc de Louis Aragon est en quelque sorte de reecrire un corpus poetique (poeme et prose) arabe et d'operer son transfert dans sa propre langue a lui. A ce niveau, nous essayons de degager du Fou d'Elsa les regles de reecriture qu'il s'est impose et d'etudier leur fonctionnement et leur variabilite. Nous nous interesserons ensuite aux mots arabes qu'Aragon utilise dans son texte et verrons quels contextes syntagmatique, semantique et semiotique il leur donne. Il est evident que le meta texte dans ce sens est d'une importance capitale dans la mesure ou le mot etranger, hote de la langue francaise, ne va pas sans une reflexion d'une langue sans/dans l'autre. Enfin, nous nous consacrerons a l'etude de l'intertextualite, a savoir comment le texte de Louis Aragon marie deux poetiques occidentale et arabe et gere un certain nombre de procedes d'ecriture et de reecriture afin d'elaborer un texte a cheval sur deux civilisations qui se reconnaissent et communiquent dans l'ecart.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Le Fou d'Elsa de Louis Aragon : vérités poétiques et vérités historiques, intertextualité, interculturalité","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Therefore, understanding the attitude and knowledge of individuals that affect their willingness to commit as an organ donor is crucial to develop effective educational programs that raise public awareness and commitment toward organ donation. The current study aims to identify the knowledge level, attitude, and commitment toward organ donation among nursing students in a local university.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA questionnaire was developed and distributed to all full-time nursing students of undergraduate and master programs in a university at Hong Kong.\n\n\nRESULTS\nA total of 362 students completed the questionnaire, including 87 males and 257 females. The mean age of the students was 22.6 years. A total of 147 students (40.6%) had registered for organ donation. Students on average could correctly answer 23.7 out of 33 questions (71.8%) regarding their knowledge on organ donation and transplantation. With regard to attitude toward organ donation, students obtained a mean score of 70.2. Univariate analysis revealed that year of study, religion, and attitude were significantly associated with commitment toward organ donation. In logistic regression analysis, year of study (odds ratio [OR] for year 2, 1.961, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.006-3.824; OR for year 3, 6.915, 95% CI, 2.835-16.868; and OR for year 4, 4.845, 95% CI, 2.071-11.334) and attitude (OR, 1.087, 95% CI, 1.049-1.126) were significantly associated with commitment toward donation after adjusting the age, gender, and study program.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nAttitude and year of study were strongly correlated with commitment toward organ donation; therefore, educational or promotional materials should be provided to improve the attitude of students toward organ donation.","inCitations":["65460b7c433f302fea434a97919c527f635c4acf","0ad61af73225634fff453d92c71ca1f11f4859cb","b9f6c6f11f4205ab097605bcab51c6fd4e6a0609","cfae011bd458bc0f15274da59039be8799b07c58","4e3606a829c6a7114c35d0913289b5f4c51efd13","80845b5ed42d897922358a760e5b0440d3d73e0c","0c12b719fa902ba6e8b8e47e4aa0dfc37806213f","83acc6110c6061f1d9bd5b5f97cf4fa7a4f954f3","868af09f35f25e377448b157e7e8aeb14e51e244","fc000fa005fb7b315b1a48b6a9e1503741723c1b","0b2cf00ce020852191d7877af47954471e5ff5bc","d67d24da8c5c62cd539e406ee0a9c53fad3549e7","64729a87f3e98525129259ee4a259a07f7af9f12","23c7c5f3623e6d8004b71d5a871b32159548844d","cf410958f14894890a4b0afa5658e046c6f8cb4d","0a6a3c46d0b221630e053334ce628d56d7128899","e92bcce7366702e6c3d54416f15722c4ebe26d99","143a5de530390502063693fa7f5abb70cb74bf83"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Knowledge, attitudes and commitment toward organ donation among nursing students in Hong Kong.","doi":"10.1016/j.transproceed.2012.01.108","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.transproceed.2012.01.108","venue":"Transplantation proceedings"}

Twenty species of parasites belonging to six major taxonomic groups were found and identified: 4 Protozoa, 2 Cestoidea, 8 Trematoda, 4 Nematoda, 1 Acanthocephala, and 1 Crustacea. Differences in species composition and degree of infestation indicated that the different populations of American plaice were infested with parasite species which are peculiarto their geographic origin.","inCitations":["12b927c7043ef7ddccbf64ef331a696e407fd1dc","3e69b9c932679fc6da27a3636f48855f449168d2","9dd3399899b202d8a8d714f70e1d8eeb1770af9d"],"pdfUrls":["http://journal.nafo.int/Portals/0/1985/zubchenko.pdf"],"title":"Parasitic fauna of American Plaice (Hippolglossoides platessoides) from the Northwest Atlantic","doi":"10.2960/J.v6.a17","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.2960/J.v6.a17","venue":""}

The fixed points of the action are of 2-types, isolated points which we call “nuts” and 2-surfaces which we call “bolts”. We describe all known gravitational instantons and relate the numbers and types of the nuts and bolts occurring in them to their topological invariants. We perform a 3+1 decomposition of the field equations with respect to orbits of the isometry group and exhibit a certain duality between “electric” and “magnetic” aspects of gravity. We also obtain a formula for the gravitational action of the instantons in terms of the areas of the bolts and certain nut charges and potentials that we define.

The larvae were reared under laboratory conditions from eggs laid by adults and larvae collected from pasture soil. This is the first description of larvae of the genus Phytholaema Blanchard. The larvae of both species have a vestigial sclerotized structure on the pleura of A9 and many other similar characteristics. The similar size of abdominal spiracles A6 and A8 in P. dilutipes is key to differentiating it from P. herrmanni, which has spiracle A8 smaller than spiracle A6.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Description of the Larvae of Phytholaema herrmanni Germain and Phytholaema dilutipes (Fairmaire and Germain) (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae: Melolonthinae)","doi":"10.1649/072.064.0210","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1649/072.064.0210","venue":""}

Para tanto, o palco desse encontro foi a sala de aula de uma escola publica, situada em um bairro pobre de uma cidade de porte medio, do interior do estado de Minas Gerais, que teve como pano de fundo o tema das alavancas, abordado atraves de uma performance que envolveu uma dupla de palhacos e um dispositivo denominado de “Maquina de Levantar Coisas”. Tal objeto serviu de intermediacao para que as criancas confeccionassem desenhos, que juntamente com as narrativas que produzimos, a partir do registro audiovisual da atividade, compuseram o corpus de analise da pesquisa. Desse modo, entendemos o palhaco como um espaco de potencialidades, com condicoes de integrar saberes da arte e da ciencia escolar, sob o foco dialogico da complementaridade na acao educativa, valorizando-se a curiosidade, o desafio, as emocoes e o encantamento. Logo, para o desenvolvimento deste trabalho, adotamos os seguintes procedimentos metodologicos: inicialmente os estudantes assistiram a uma performance de palhacos, que ao final apresentou um problema aparentemente sem solucao. Posteriormente, solicitamos que cada crianca confeccionasse um desenho representando a sua resposta ao referido problema e, por fim, promovemos uma roda de conversas, a fim de tentarmos entender os significados dos desenhos que foram produzidos. Todas as etapas da pesquisa foram registradas em audio e video e totalizaram o periodo de aproximadamente 50 minutos de trabalho. Assim, ao final desse estudo, sinalizamos para algumas possibilidades de educacao em ciencias, percebidas ao longo desse encontro entre criancas e palhacos.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"As ciências, o palhaço e a criança: as possibilidades de educabilidade científica do encontro entre a criança e o palhaço","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Our interest in the FDACL procedure stems from the important contact lens-fitting information and documentation of disease progression provided by the FDACL trial lenses and observation of fluorescein patterns.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThe Collaborative Longitudinal Evaluation of Keratoconus (CLEK) Study is an observational study that has enrolled 1,209 keratoconus patients to characterize the progression of keratoconus, to determine factors associated with its progression, and to assess its impact on quality of life. Ten percent of the patients were randomly selected at baseline for a retest examination. The baseline examination, which included keratometry and FDACL, was repeated in this sample. The FDACL is the flattest lens in the standardized CLEK trial lens set that vaults the apex of the cone. FDACL provides an estimate of the sagittal height of the cone.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe correlation of FDACL with the steep keratometric reading (r = 0.89; p = 0.0001) and the flat keratometric reading (r = 0.83; p = 0.0001) were high. Test-retest repeatability as measured by the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was high: FDACL ICC, 0.97; steep keratometric reading ICC, 0.96; and flat keratometric reading ICC, 0.95. Test-retest repeatability of FDACL remained high in advanced disease.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nFDACL provides a repeatable new procedure for determining disease severity in keratoconus.","inCitations":["a78ebda631d08f8e3f250c068561f18a47d1c917","1864af396ba42736ef4a3ed168577ca7a4f09624","5aa8abdf704bb3ecc84de717321b88aada8b942f","d5a35ca8e7ee7faba05f63bbe9648ef68ebea10d","177d5a154f16a1fc684774a1f1930660f9a2b641","e38886b2796278e4b0ae307570aeed69dfcc15a3","490b6a3062a8be666919eb7b2478dac01c1f350a","062aa5b82d0cccc188518fbcbe86f2bc45d17dee","400a3a1ea346ab3c54ce0569e7f7457cbaf02797","342c0f55fe0f9c4b92b60b3745f62b7f4f1905d9","fb0c738a30f06d88d73a7d5db721e8c6f8e85ae2","914c99dfb6396c22254655a3e824e322591e5b8a","eb4e2ba713c3e286901a31faac3dc3bb9b8e2c61","808d7d86b4fca6d4f6360b53f476fe03660cad6e","88cc9b735ab293aee8d1af68043b62070fed627b"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Repeatability and agreement of two corneal-curvature assessments in keratoconus: keratometry and the first definite apical clearance lens (FDACL).

REBL incorporates a number of novel technologies to generate and expose lithographic patterns at estimated throughputs considerably higher than electron beam lithography has been able to achieve as yet. A patented reflective electron optic concept enables the unique approach utilized for the digital pattern generator (DPG). The DPG is a complementary metal oxide semiconductor application specific integrated circuit chip with an array of small, independently controllable metallic cells or pixels, which act as an array of electron mirrors.

An analysis of their potential was carried out based on the activity of arylsulfatase and the number of Pseudomonas sp. determined on the 25th and 50th days of the study. Cd2+ was applied in the following doses: 0, 4, 40, 80, 120, 160, 200 mg Cd2+ kg−1 of DM soil, in the form of CdCl2·2.5H2O. A complex formulation of the issue was obtained from the presentation of biochemical properties using the RS (resistance of soil) index. Cadmium caused permanent adverse effects in the soil environment, inhibiting the activity of arylsulfatase and the yield of spring barley. The consequences of stress connected with increasing Cd2+ pollution were intensified by an elongation of the accumulation time of the tested metal in the soil. Chances for regeneration of the soil may be sought, most of all, with the application of straw and, to a lesser degree, with basalt meal. Brown algae did not meet the expectations for its potential. An increase in the studied parameters also resulted from sowing the soil with spring barley.","inCitations":["8222ffff22be36e391b6fcc295702195a1264e8d","a5a5b15a57e24515505e850e3cc89c22022a5aa3","317fe3ff1304caa317a0a51c6f04195bf3d495e2","19da7f083a7f2ad2b0630223ddaaccbd6d245f5b"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Brown Algae and Basalt Meal in Maintaining the Activity of Arylsulfatase of Soil Polluted with Cadmium","doi":"10.1007/s11270-017-3449-7","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11270-017-3449-7","venue":"Water, Air, & Soil Pollution"}

A preferred repair technique applies adhesively bonded patches, after the damaged laminate material has been removed by cutting or drilling a hole. In the present paper within the scope of classical laminate theory, the problem of a laminate plate with an elliptical hole repaired by elliptical patches under in-plane and/or bending load is investigated. For the considered base plate and repair patch arbitrary bending extension coupling is allowed. There are no restrictions for the elastic membrane and bending stiffnesses of the underlying layups. With regard to the hole and patch design any size of the elliptical shape is admitted. The analysis of the repair problem is performed by the complex potential method. The complex potentials are defined by appropriate series representations for the base plate, the repair region and the hole domain. The derived closed-form analytical solution provides all essential field quantities for an accurate and effective assessment of the external patch repair.","inCitations":["3b36c92a0fd81a04e21adce47ff047b7a29fb805","37ebb237b7456130c774296a66b9c18305cb1dd6","3e6f87246cfcc8ddd454091f66830e34e8957264","7c31ec71e9bda6e32b0631926a2af43f45830860","eae62f39bd4b8cd7076013f1c6728f320adad43e","38d611c4cf5aede3f8daa2a3116e2d5c4c8aa1d2","cd15d8d07b5a331e95fb9a62bd24091267e5847b","4146c4f809b1d8241de32f381ab65efafd25f3eb","1863023511bb884c4a49529afb7831a12326b346"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Closed-form analysis of external patch repairs of laminates","doi":"10.1016/S0263-8223(02)00011-9","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/S0263-8223%2802%2900011-9","venue":""}

With the exception of the cerebellum the ratio of choline to acetylcholine in different brain regions ranged between 2.5 and 3.6. When the majority of the cholinergic nerve endings in the hippocampus were destroyed by placement of a lesion in the medial septal area the concentrations of acetylcholine and choline in the hippocampus were reduced by 70–74 and 20–32 %, respectively.

A consistent and conservative scheme and projection method on a collocated mesh (Ni et al., J Comp Phys 227 (2007)174-204 and 227 (2007) 205-228) are employed to solve the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations with the Lorentz force included based on an electrical potential formula. As an illustration, three blanket flows have been considered: liquid metal flow in a channel without FCI, with a silicon carbide FCI and with a FCI made of conductive material. It is shown that liquid metal flows in blanket with FCI are 3D developing flows. It is verified that: MHD pressure drop can be reduced by using silicon carbide FCI; PES (Pressure Equilibrium Slot) can balance the pressure difference between two sides of FCI near the slot but the pressure difference is still very large far away from PES; conductive FCI cannot reduce MHD pressure drop. Due to the leakage of current circuit across the slot, with PES opened at one side, a strong reversed velocity is observed in PES.

Tumour necrosis factor superfamily (TNFSF) cytokines play roles in supporting B-cell function as well as bone re-modelling. The influence of smoking on factors that support B-cell function in periodontitis remains unclear.\n\n\nAIM\nTo investigate plasma concentrations of TNF (TNSF1A), soluble receptor activator of nuclear-factor Kappa-B ligand (sRANKL/TNFSF11), a proliferation-inducing ligand (APRIL/TNFSF13), B-cell activating factor (BAFF/TNFSF13B) and Osteoprotegerin (OPG/TNFRSF11B) in smokers and non-smokers with and without chronic periodontitis\n\n\nMATERIALS & METHODS\nPlasma concentrations of TNFSF and OPG were evaluated in 200 systemically healthy subjects divided into four groups: non-smokers with periodontitis (n = 101), smokers with periodontitis (n = 55), healthy non-smokers (n = 27) and healthy smokers (n = 17).\n\n\nRESULTS\nPeriodontitis patients had significantly higher plasma sRANKL, TNF, APRIL and BAFF and lower OPG than healthy subjects (p < 0.01). TNF and sRANKL were significantly greater in smokers with periodontitis (p = 0.011, p = 0.001) and OPG concentrations significantly lower (p = 0.001), whereas APRIL or BAFF were little changed. Plasma APRIL, BAFF, sRANKL and TNF correlated with probing depth and clinical attachment loss.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nTNFSF cytokines correlate with periodontitis disease severity. However, only TNF, sRANKL and OPG levels were altered by cigarette smoking. APRIL and BAFF appear as good indicators of disease severity.","inCitations":["3436900fe080b213ed44fbc4fad167e2ed3ccdf0","eb93604e350c06ca2f94ab3847ab875602e9bb08","48a7d7f549a0e297a3c609bad97fc5eafecf2ee4"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Comparison of circulating tumour necrosis factor superfamily cytokines in periodontitis patients undergoing supportive therapy: a case-controlled cross-sectional study comparing smokers and non-smokers in health and disease.","doi":"10.1111/jcpe.12134","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1111/jcpe.12134","venue":"Journal of clinical periodontology"}

Homeopathy was the most frequent therapy, followed by reflexology, naturopathy, and acupuncture. The most common medical complaint was pain, particularly back pain. The most frequent reason for consulting the practitioner was disappointment with the outcome of conventional treatment. 39% of respondents who visited a practitioner were being treated by a conventional physician at the same time, for the same problem. The medical problems of a large majority had been relieved, but 22% said they were not helped by the practitioner. Women were more likely than men to consult a practitioner. Respondents with secondary or higher education were more likely to visit than those with less education. There were no age or socio-economic differences between users and nonusers. The mean payment for the whole series of treatments was NIS 770 (about $250). Respondents who visited practitioners reported worse health and more pain than nonusers, and were also more likely to have visited their conventional primary care physician in the past month. The findings suggest that nonconventional medicine should be seen as complementary to, rather than in competition with conventional medicine.","inCitations":["896e9dde5766fcf0da5a82598207576d4baea8b2","04ef4a89c75397e6c29b22d1e75f3f8c7be75284"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"[Consultations with practitioners of alternative medicine].","doi":"","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"Harefuah"}

A sphere of an optical glass (BK7) has been obtained through melting and cooling without any crucible. Raman scattering and electron spin resonance (ESR) of the glass sphere showed no spatial anisotropy with respect to the applied field. Microspheres of binary sodium tellurite glass were also obtained for the first time by an evaporation–condensation process in high magnetic fields. Thermal convection was suppressed under a magnetic force of −0.8 g . The size of microspheres produced under the magnetic force was about 500 nm at most. This size is one-half the size of spheres produced without a magnetic field. Raman scattering measurements on microspheres produced under the magnetic field showed different spectra from those without a magnetic field. The difference is due to a deficiency of sodium ions in the spheres produced without a magnetic field.","inCitations":["fc3368c8db839eb601b1291c9b817eeb5484bf9b","3a039b9b712c506433365d77f5a2aa0176459d81","7bdd50b0273feb4599f5a1b53e8d7da73b82f1da","82ec85b16625e898b44a214eaa6b2c7f54f47d1d","38978491831787c40b290377e745d886afe6cf8c","916976d172ef2e7f31a8e3af6698643a2e2d1cc9","2cdf98057c8b12c42676debbce45fbefd857b3cd"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Glass spheres produced by magnetic levitation method","doi":"10.1016/S0022-3093(01)00761-X","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/S0022-3093%2801%2900761-X","venue":""}

Highly- committed birders, a subset of the larger bird watching population, are the target market for specialized guided birding tours marketed by commercial and non-profit entities. One non- profit entity, the Kalamazoo Nature Center (KNC), offers a limited number of guided birding tours to service current members, attract new members, and support its programs. With an eye towards increasing the number of participants on its current tours and potentially increasing the number of future tours, a study of regional (Great Lakes), national, and international birding tours offered by commercial and non-profit entities was conducted. Specifically, this study examined guided birding tours in terms of a number of parameters important to birders, including group size, guide experience, time spent birding, cost, services provided, and tour operator size and length of operation. This paper will present findings on those parameters as well as the participant demographics on the examined birding tours.","inCitations":["062163fd1834780449a4809c4b9b9ee09be6c118","b36cc4144f6c5a3742b64d72ec1be19c825a31c2","f94471f11afe27c86323845510f0493538cfd533","684a6ffd4cc06ebff6daa729a5e22a8b597b80a5"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Guided Birding Tours: an Examination of the Market, Important Tour Parameters, and Participant Demographics","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Using the theoretical constructs of task and social leadership, we explore the patterns of leadership and influence found on the Supreme Court of Canada during the tenure of Chief Justice Antonio Lamer (1991-97). The findings demonstrate considerable evidence of task leadership by the Chief Justice in a period of revolutionary constitutional policy making. Additionally, the results suggest that the Chief Justice exhibited strong instincts in marshalling a consistent winning coalition to secure majority decisions, and in crafting a cohesive court with a low rate of dissent. Still, dissent rates did climb somewhat under Lamer's tenure as chief, with the leading dissenters turning out to be the two women on the bench. One of those relative outsiders has recently ascended to the position as chief (Justice Beverly McLachlin).

Here, we seek to address two issues regarding the mechanical response of small-volume MGs at low homologous temperatures from a continuum-based modeling perspective: (1) are MGs capable of exhibiting a work hardening response, and (2) what is the physical mechanism which causes its work hardening response? Along with implementing a recently-developed finite-deformation, strain gradient plasticity-based constitutive model for MGs into a self-developed finite-element code, we study the tensile response of small-volume MG samples of various sizes through finite-element simulations. Our simulations show that small-volume MG samples are capable of exhibiting a work hardening response provided the following conditions are met: (a) the sample size is small enough, and (b) the appropriate microscopic boundary conditions for the free volume are imposed on the sample.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Effects of microscopic boundary conditions on the deformation behavior of small-volume metallic glasses","doi":"10.1016/j.ijsolstr.2014.09.011","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijsolstr.2014.09.011","venue":""}

Reprod. 71, 993-1001]. Attempts to purify this 'soluble' PrP indicated that it behaves like a high-molecular-mass complex of more than 350 kDa and always co-purified with the same set of proteins. The main associated proteins were sequenced by MS and were found to match to clusterin (apolipoprotein J), BPI (bacterial permeability-increasing protein), carboxylesterase-like urinary excreted protein (cauxin), beta-mannosidase and beta-galactosidase. Immunoblotting and enzymatic assay confirmed the presence of clusterin and a cauxin-like protein and showed that a 17 kDa hydrophobic epididymal protein was also associated with this complex. These associated proteins were not separated by a high ionic strength treatment but were by 2-mercaptoethanol, probably due to its action on reducing disulphide bonds that maintain the interaction of components of the complex. Our results suggest that the associated PrP retains its GPI (glycosylphosphatidylinositol) anchor, in contrast with brain-derived PrP, and that it is resistant to cleavage by phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C. Based on these results, the identity of the associated proteins and the overall biochemical properties of this protein ensemble, we suggest that 'soluble' PrP can form protein complexes that are maintained by hydrophobic interactions, in a similar manner to lipoprotein vesicles or micellar complexes.","inCitations":["60e62b7d584fdf0851c1113e33d973c160cc36c3","c1abd23b1b501843c47f40ff320d57a284373d41","bb82514fdf6c19697e3b3f4bc2d1c395bbd9194c","74652f5607f7f96953b98b5805e43087cb7272b7","40b557b9515f61acd77d5ff5d045ebe298a70e67","e1e9a4030ef23d76adcab8f0c29ee7ad3659728d","7ac2a0105f278760a9f563266416a82d68f9a060","b31c0f4c1c42af1a0885aa7837f6aea5c35fc720","3425bde8ab3743e17ee3276b4af3a539d751ec68","a99b2445e7f12f0831b1346a5283f1a52981537b","76565ca5305a31a66c34aae2b8bcb535907f7246","133b6e72adada878b236760f5c5337196083f038","eda52334ad6fba273d95dd5ca59afd8d07ed3b51","e4d1edb9d7935b0bce01af66a7e05c10e9837ae9","ac0c854c10a583a6f43cf8ce586ff7560f4f5195","608e693242741dc34cbf5832027a58c32aa96bd5","4418643dfd020fa1834cf09431071995629afc21","2fb56380a2a20333ee744e212e6a18d42f0ef9fa","ce3958d7060634d7f214f4fc6d363157f9625d12","d5d0e5b227bbaac4138079a8a9d739e403a965a4"],"pdfUrls":["https://ro.uow.edu.au/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1974&context=scipapers","http://ro.uow.edu.au/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1974&context=scipapers"],"title":"The epididymal soluble prion protein forms a high-molecular-mass complex in association with hydrophobic proteins.","doi":"10.1042/BJ20050459","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1042/BJ20050459","venue":"The Biochemical journal"}

We sought to determine whether neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (CRT) can improve prognosis compared with direct esophagectomy in this patient group. Between 1994 and 2005, patients with cT2N0 esophageal squamous cell carcinoma who underwent either neoadjuvant CRT or surgery as first-line treatment were retrospectively reviewed. We collected information on their demographic characteristics, staging modality, clinical and pathological stages, perioperative course, and survival. The study endpoints included tumor recurrence, disease-specific survival (DSS), and overall survival rate. Of the 71 eligible patients, 14 received an esophagectomy first, whereas the remaining 57 received neoadjuvant CRT first. Despite the high pathological complete response (pCR) rate of 37% after neoadjuvant CRT, routine neoadjuvant CRT did not translate into better survival compared to direct surgery (5-year DSS: 39% vs. 68%, P= 0.17). The dramatic survival difference between pCR and non-pCR patients (5-year DSS: 85% vs. 4%, P < 0.001) accounts for these unsatisfactory results. In our series, the administration of neoadjuvant CRT to patients with clinical stage T2N0 esophageal squamous cell carcinoma did not significantly improve outcomes compared with direct esophagectomy.","inCitations":["2aa279876dc88b807136c552de223543597627a2","85aab0676d0b55a667664095786247c222ef5e2e","517c64bc9b9f8991a99cac72df3e9639338cb1be","e58e27d60b07ee1dc33372782c48ddb810749c70","d46ae643c5370ebc40c65f8f2462a28ccd8d6de1","0f6ee05ff3bd152f3de31a5e6df0e9478fc342ff","517f8653982dccca673fc078800561ac1228b879","911218028f7922860744e2dc2d9db15c54335e91","363a46524b8f542250ea898dcd46cc14e5800810"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Long-term outcomes following neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy in patients with clinical T2N0 esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.","doi":"10.1111/j.1442-2050.2011.01243.x","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1442-2050.2011.01243.x","venue":"Diseases of the esophagus : official journal of the International Society for Diseases of the Esophagus"}

Methods: Between 1980 and 1998 fourty patients underwent anterior-posterior correction for Meyerding Grade 3 or 4 isthmic dysplastic spondylolisthesis. Ten patients were treated with an anterior reduction according to Louis and anterior interbody fusion followed by posterior decompression and instrumented fusion (group A). Fourteen patients underwent posterior decompression followed by anterior reposition and fusion with tricortical iliac bone crest and posterior instrumented fusion (group B). Sixteen patients underwent progressive reduction by halopelvic traction followed by anterior and posterior fusion (group C). All patients completed the North American Spine Society (NASS) outcome questionnaire and the SF-36. The cosmetic assessment was performed by means of a VAS. The mean follow-up period for group A was 13,5 years, for group B 5,5 years and for group C 15,4 years, respectively. Results: The three groups were comparable with respect to age at operation, radiographic measurement of the slip, lumbosacral kyphosis and lumbar lordosis. The incidence of postoperative extensor hallucis longus weakness was 33% in group A, 50% in group C and 0% in group B (p Conclusion: Outcomes of function, satisfaction and cosmesis are satisfactory in all three surgical groups.

Carvacrol or cymene showed inhibitory effect on the growth of L. monocytogenes during lag and exponential growth phases and was more evident with increasing concentrations in brain heart infusion broth at 30 degrees C. Carvacrol or cymene also decreased the survival of mid-exponential-growth-phase L. monocytogenes STCC4031 cells in potassium-N-2-hydroxy-ethylpiperazine-N-ethanesulfo nic acid, at 30 degrees C. The combination of carvacrol and cymene resulted in an increased antibacterial effect on the growth and a synergistic effect on the viability of L. monocytogenes compared with the natural compounds applied separately. The analysis of survival curves by the Weibull frequency distribution function allowed an accurate prediction of the level of inactivation achieved. Interestingly, an important bactericidal effect (4.7-log reduction) of low concentrations of both antimicrobials combined (0.75 mM) was observed on L. monocytogenes in carrot juice.

Yet it has been revealed by a local NGO that some local people are still using the same post-and-lintel construction methods that failed in the earthquake. Why do these people continue to use an unsafe technology? What is preventing them from employing traditional practices of timber-based earthquake-resistant construction? Alternatively, why don’t they adopt other safe construction practices? Does this represent a simple gap in awareness or affordability, or is it the culmination of a more complex socio-political dynamic? This report investigates the uptake of alternative low-cost technological systems in the wake of efforts by the government and international aid agencies to implement more high-cost solutions in the area. Of particular interest is the case of the award-winning Cal-Earth model. The viability of this building system was demonstrated through the construction of approximately 500 small emergency shelters in 2006, but it has since been unable to capture the interest of local people. A key finding is that the lack of uptake is due to a gap between this model’s actual and perceived benefits. The report concludes this gap may be reduced by encouraging meaningful participation by local people in construction-technology decisions. However, a bigger issue in this and similar situations is the social-justice aspect of introducing alternative technologies in disadvantaged communities when such interventions foster dependence instead of independence.

The process had three heating zones (top, bottom and side) to improve the control of the horizontal and vertical thermal gradients in the melt; and, a square crucible to reshape the final crystal into a square horizontal section. Modeling of the starting configuration, where crystal growth from the seed was not possible experimentally, explained that the ascendant melt flow in the center is bringing hot melt to the seed. The addition of a ceramic tube as a radiation shield around the seeding zone and the increase of side heating were modeled numerically as solutions to reverse the melt flow direction. The applied solutions on the experimental furnace allowed the growth from the seed. The process was sensitive to symmetry loss. The asymmetric growth of the crystal towards one preferential direction was explained by a coupling between the sudden increase of emissivity due to solidification of silicon and the local decrease of convection on the side of the preferred growth direction. A symmetric growth was obtained in the model by lowering radiative cooling at the top of the melt surface during the first stage of the growth, and by homogenizing the melt using crystal rotation. As a result, symmetrical circular crystals were obtained experimentally using the same growth conditions without contact with the crucible and with no upward pulling.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Numerical investigation of an experimental Kyropoulos process to grow silicon ingots for photovoltaic application","doi":"10.1016/j.jcrysgro.2016.12.063","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcrysgro.2016.12.063","venue":""}

Following transfection of miR-15b into QSG7701 cells, cell proliferation, glucose consumption and intracellular triglyceride levels were measured. We also measured the levels of miR-15b in the serum of fatty liver disease patients using real-time PCR.\n\n\nRESULTS\nWe found that miR-15b was upregulated in the livers of NAFLD SD rats as well as in NAFLD L02 cells. Increased miR-15b levels could cause decreased cell proliferation and glucose consumption as well as induce the storage of intracellular triglyceride in QSG7701 cells. The expression of miR-15b was also significantly elevated in the serum of fatty liver disease patients compared with healthy subjects.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIncreased miR-15b expression in NAFLD models may lead to decreased cell proliferation and glucose consumption while inducing the storage of intracellular triglyceride, which are all hazards of NAFLD. Therefore, increased serum miR-15b level is a potentially biomarker for the diagnosis of fatty liver disease.","inCitations":["0d9404307287c76b908aeaf0fadf9d4d620a91a3","0cdb7398bb792b64f2a23ce22b886645cc1329ae","5ecf549659c084d6fbebf4852dc97f6a68a706f1","0cdd9c793c21c6f2b95c841e57bd7eb1261101da","e712842ccabbf2ddb1ba1eefd52b3dae303a714c","3a424c8b5db4db9ccfbfe4265bcf39e2773549f2","312fda58214cfbce07a49604cdb865ec1c859a41","1c2bcd50d2369f0c06963e05ff1db4caa047f3f3","c29f25574be6a293087a1e937d3299ac78d82a92","a0411271db6b43ae4e61edce159744c125111506","1e344bc51303e606fd425ad341ec7a799820d950","a1caa3564902708eb377ecd260b7c42500f42dd4","96229629ef47e353a983a8f8a3e0cf7e34b3879c","d90fda19c9b7f4319634c8ce4dbc4ae021b1e40f","ef9fac905f046323bf696807fb8179b8a1b74164","dbafed88ca1a8a4b77f4a3e73b37dbccd49eb4ff","54f8285c08fd67a2528cd3fc527487f5b0584aec","6e7f412c4643c7daa75c363838ada748897107b7","2312b2589f14480e0141dcb858d88d1872d3527b","0cc3e286c42a334408cc052adec889073fd218e2","b26c6fe76f1146b10871772214fd326d69adf9c0"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Upregulation of miR-15b in NAFLD models and in the serum of patients with fatty liver disease.","doi":"10.1016/j.diabres.2012.11.025","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.diabres.2012.11.025","venue":"Diabetes research and clinical practice"}

Let $k$ be an infinite field, $G$ an algebraic group defined and quasi-simple over $k,$ and $G(k)$ the group of $k$-rational points of $G.$ Let $G(k)^+$ be the subgroup of $G(k)$ generated by the unipotent radicals of parabolic subgroups of $G$ defined over $k$ and $PG(k)^+$ the quotient of $G(k)^+$ by its center. Then every normalized function of positive type on $PG(k)^+$ which is constant on conjugacy classes is a convex combination of $1_{PG(k)^+}$ and $\\delta_e.$ As corollary, we obtain that the only ergodic invariant random subgroups (IRS) of $PG(k)^+$ are $\\delta_{PG(k)^+}$ and $\\delta_{\\{e\\}},$ when $k$ is countable. A further consequence is that, when $k$ is a global field and $G$ is $k$-isotropic and has trivial center, every measure preserving ergodic action of $G(k)$ on a probability space either factorizes through the abelianization of $G(k)$ or is essentially free.","inCitations":["679e12f567bf5efe2d641ad735b213361d63d6f6","ed5dd0ee342be4357a08202bc3f988725c6845d2"],"pdfUrls":["https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.06928v1.pdf"],"title":"Character rigidity of simple algebraic groups.","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Typically used heads have the frequency ranging from 7.5 to 12 MHz. Higher frequencies ensure higher resolution, yet they are limited by the penetration depth - reaching from several to several tens of millimetres into the skin. High-frequency ultrasonography (HFUS) appears to be a promising method for the detection and differential diagnostics of selected nodular skin lesions.\n\n\nAim\nThe study aimed at a comparison of the data obtained by using HFUS, histopathological and dermatoscopic images of selected skin lesions to determine their common features.\n\n\nMaterial and methods\nNodular lesions classified as potentially malignant were subjected to clinical, dermatoscopic and high-frequency ultrasonographic examinations. Then the patients were referred for surgical removal with histopathological assessment.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 54 nodular lesions were examined, out of which 34 were diagnosed as non-melanoma. The most common lesions were melanocytic naevi dermatofibroma, nodular basal cell carcinoma and pyogenic granuloma. Other examined lesions included blue naevus, seborrheic wart, xanthogranuloma juvenile and Spits naevus. In all lesions except Spitz naevus, HFUS images corresponded at least with dermatoscopic or histopathology images.\n\n\nConclusions\nHFUS can be used as a supporting diagnostic tool ensuring better pre-operative proceedings. HFUS is a non-invasive, easy and inexpensive screening method for the determination of different skin cancers as it provides valuable information allowing to determine the cutting margins and lesion shape.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"High-frequency ultrasound in the diagnosis of selected non-melanoma skin nodular lesions","doi":"10.5114/ada.2019.89505","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.5114/ada.2019.89505","venue":"Postepy dermatologii i alergologii"}

Today, a significant amount of traffic uses the P2P approach for media transmission. It is a decentralized media communication method, which is more cost-effective and scalable. However, the traditional Peer-to-Peer network suffers various limitations and overlay construction is one of them. Different unstructured overlay approaches like tree and mesh have already been discussed. In this paper, we will provide the utilization-based hybrid overlay for the P2P network. There have been basically two prime considerations for creating the overlay-the upload bandwidth of the peer and utilization of that peer.
