In order to explain published laboratory data on how seismic velocities and electrical conductivity vary in sandstones and granites, the models require a population of cracks to be present in a possibly porous host phase. The central objective is to obtain a consistent mean‐field analytical model that shows how each modeled rock property depends on the nature of the crack population. The crack populations are described by a crack density, a probability distribution for the crack apertures and radii, and the averaged orientation of the cracks. The possibly anisotropic nature of the elasticity, conductivity, and permeability tensors is allowed for; however, only the isotropic limit is used when comparing to laboratory data. For the transport properties of conductivity and permeability, the percolation effect of the crack population linking up to form a connected path across a sample is modeled. However, this effect is important only in crystalline rock where the host phase has very small conductivity and permeability. In general, the importance of the crack population to the transport properties increases as the host phase becomes less conductive and less permeable.","inCitations":["b837e288fbf56af2cc79b3d1602a9a056ccaa573","568449a53fddd9f7f82613ef3aae99f872230dce"],"pdfUrls":["https://cloudfront.escholarship.org/dist/prd/content/qt2qm5652t/qt2qm5652t.pdf?t=osxw4y"],"title":"Changes in geophysical properties caused by fluid injection into porous rocks: analytical models","doi":"10.1111/1365-2478.12435","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2478.12435","venue":""}

The measurements were done at three temperatures (8°, 15°, and 22°C) and at two pH conditions, a stable pH and an adjusted pH, that is, a pH that mimics the cellular pH adjustments with body temperature (ΔpH/ΔT= -0.03°C⁻¹). At constant pH, a change in temperature from 15° to 8°C decreased the apparent $K_{m}$ of mitochondria for pyruvate. However, when pH covaried with temperature, the apparent $K_{m}$ did not change. The $Q_{10}$ for the $V_{max}$ of pyruvate oxidation was 2.5 between 8° and 15°C and 0.89 between 15° and 22°C (adjusted pH). Temperature significantly affected the pyruvate kinetics of PDH when pH was maintained constant (7.8) but not when pH covaried with temperature. Thus, pH regulation would minimize the functional impact of changes in temperature for both PDH ...","inCitations":["f940056d5ebbedf0bc34e79d7127d8ae69739c16","231c2b824ae4ba076d7261c62b72256373791a87","084b4979658b56d1db736da9c22d08ee9dda1392","e3334c4f366936036a00ece87e4661e0ec5ee1ec","557670134bcdd49df9453f2389af600fe7386098","b7d311d553af7feff22b73ef854b3e118149907b","1ee59c0a569eabca339dbbbd0593379412d80c5c","374e8a96437a3ae6a641c1570e152e6e317ad615","8314df4a04b4d339feec207c8411d38733761ac0","67206d378530b884aa73e053798f8e14cdd61290","e9a7f066b710bf4b7a13b35b6a1f96e1c45615df","755a4c8d4947e2ed41cd0bc2191b9e18e516ea35","e52146158cb20bd08adb80efa7834a70ec276ea3"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Effects of pH and Temperature on the Kinetics of Pyruvate Oxidation by Muscle Mitochondria from Rainbow Trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss)","doi":"10.1086/physzool.66.4.30163804","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1086/physzool.66.4.30163804","venue":""}

Using LDL receptor-deficient mice, we now show that atheroma development depends on M-CSF concentration, as not only did homozygous osteopetrotic (op/op) mice have dramatically reduced lesions (approximately 0.3% of control lesion size) but heterozygous (op/+) mice had lesions < 1% of controls. Mice heterozygous for the op mutation (op/+) had plasma levels of M-CSF about half those in controls (+/+). The finding that an approximately 2-fold reduction in M-CSF expression reduced lesion size approximately 100-fold suggests the requirement for a threshold level of M-CSF. The effect of M-CSF on atherosclerosis did not appear to be mediated either by changes in plasma lipoprotein levels or alterations in the number of circulating monocytes, since both op/op and op/+ mice exhibited higher levels of atherogenic lipoprotein particles and (op/+) mice showed a near normal number of circulating monocytes. LDL receptor-null littermates of genotypes from op/op, op/+, to +/+ showed monocyte differentials of approximately 4.5, 8, and 10%, respectively. Taken together, these results suggest that the effects of M-CSF on atherogenesis may not be mediated by expression of M-CSF systemically or by modulation of the number of circulating monocytes. These studies support the conclusion that M-CSF participates critically in fatty streak formation and progression to a complex fibrous lesion.","inCitations":["612861ef3991609b60967ff550db3ec9bae1f616","3a75f8235e41112f417d6f891a35dd8eafb95d91","23d9807b0cf6d9f99b2af36f8557e2b06412591a","6889b2aa9d13f1b5240c47b2cf32c54d3cb99b6f","4e86f85821d97b5f698a4d1cfdb291dba51d3fe6","929fa42ebb8192ef37f7b2ea2b9776e74c46b9a0","efcdd7860ff68d5c17e88452c86ae2332fc80f94","fbf59d6f199d977240f02b0a23d0f62d30cc711a","bc48575f7dac62199970b3a2b740c0e8301048ff","c4fae130a5a831a3e29e0987b7ad8d705552dd4e","30012211b55b26376ddac474fbbdc95476cf3c58","6748a4e1d21bd1b32edeb2f3e327d5a18a22acc3","e2105ffec549022b7ad6aacfb79d5a854854566b","54fc1987f57e0375c7794acc1ed41997a0fded7f","947f60c1c81841e4a915bab06afcc361973c3503","7fd3e7460e08d8a3c76bf0abfa6465e895b7894c","9a596d8014a3b230b25392ee910d02f40b09168f","1b66f38838baf1031bd6114844617ceedeeded25","ec9815c13173d2210fc25bd6c0a2e11bfa12b1b2","08714bf69562f8afc284ee618faee5a67d576648","d77188ea7de442f7b1499556f916b0e313405267","cacf41171d40cabd865a7be984e35d93c1e9942e","dfb229d940635b888edd0bac4e0137dd0d704ce6","5e59642ce852959df3fe4703f862a137ec225e42","98faa1787976539a876beb578966b3236df62d21","7b38555c6a8fc734598bef5e0a47e773b3d2030c","4074b6509e4c6ac23c8159218085ba01866386bc","44306fcb4bc80a1e177de9c7acec95521e87e6d0","422e08e6a090f5d75567be4b7080427b89fcb4e8","23fa5775ff068c085521fa0ce25c31c6ffd46647","f5c49798020ad22104fff5f2414f3b42304219a7","234e8eb8eb5cae542d4fa176473325290a459c46","2ad6b19f1cfff23fa1835f97f9baddefd37c6454","e8cb2817f301c6bae8ae4601cc0d858269812de6","8a5f330f0b68ddb8f2ac8107aff44705dca7b66d","fc91dae6b01de5a6622b88b5069759445c077d5e","64df6c74420cfa4c78b513253c74a5ab9de46268","6bfe25fc2a8831c0bcd4204b7876c457365763ca","d19e822f07c2a67f50a676190f16bfff9a8bf044","25268c79202729d909fb6dd180c16cfe742b38de","9d5d7702c37eb352e21d58917d96afca9329586c","7cc1093731d92f5c9b21eac922883af2670989c8","a24d7ce4ed84ffd5f18b1f8981972f43bed2f021","36c3372a866ee5f340bfaacaa0aae747114121bf","eb86cc3cb10c69333ea9954e7903edecf32fe2de","8462061a9ab7164a787c887a144507030b43c33c","77ee7043fc4199d22aef50bd616e5e78ca798cd5","73b133045f1b961444ed1ba85a560bfbf6eae8a2","7b336832aea77ed155b7909aa19e74bcb5ae8a0f","84a523cb46a47cec3aea55c14e130f1a27b00791","19193f06963af7f3b493462277d4ff37cfe407ad","50ee2f250ab9a5d1e03b65eb6281c6556ce3114c","0471179346a7b4d7f56a09919ebaf6b66fe5da9c","bb780ba271867b537cfcab8dbd206a541b0e61b5","a75e3baecca5fe55e4b725cf2bc24a7454c23b5d","18e201bdc257fc5cb56ed1a621112ae342d77ad1","73baf677a57087577f98220999cc76185ee563ef","66439e91252977364b8d63ce5f79be054db8dc93","04d90ca6c4f5c94e47e2935f91492a25d0d92690","63f4ea05f40d161d574b03a502dfa8657bf4064a","02cd8d1de18a9298cb1327ab5be3675f2aedbb39","11662b5684395b4390877bce799c56451ebca6c0","1fedce57696085f9bd141f1d74de0a4ac62a0d80","bd267b27ba45ab22724b64bac11a2b83afcf1a34","daa29ca10da6136b2c8d249b04550af7de224347","ec42d49873e77381d2ef66c29049366e7d790235","e9622d6b42e2476a67dccf3cd06beea16eba3290","0875b654785fecafc12cb14e7c14d7b8eb88ee62","380412339d0085556a101af0f4238294fce98ef3","e81fc76d1fa9d94b27d6bda31c378795d6bc6c48","0d17ec56e67f80138a57261b0c30a701640fee37","c4984ce1e2fedee992e1571c962f2a83982b5b2c","255cc75dd72b7055a733afa9aebd1470697c7da8","aa8514dde7d4c8258bacac397b3fa7a50381fb1c","939727459efd62d5a9a5e570aba81cf1233909af","eae60eabec140e41d06d9ba0e482da86beda1659","f5976d7317251e787811b1c3ae6f6e275263c183","ec810a8e95f0da1d8a013386759a477d674ad86e","6d2c77b40766171ec7e3d634074ad54d1a18655a","cb62c5916736589479efc6773613afd4fa303c81","3aa75faf84c1f2602a7e8f112d5332839b5a5e65","f8536e9d4c1b5d8f209810467445a40e619bba69","53ca91b16146ef221ff84ad0c5709c54b594db25","23d3373e13f868ee8e9ae66fce4f5855a44b17aa","337802ef864781ba636fb547a8ebeb4a130b6522","c8bbf98be33e680bfd59bed08d440a9b2464809e","ddf54121e497681de1b95a934094859925c59e2d","f03f72f742ddfe064a27123c83bfbb801754ea79","092f603ca1a364aff3c79183e582abb768c43960","c001b9f572c93580b613a6cf8abb65a7391a939a","0f20f11e096d0858d3f0c8f99103d95c25d96eb1","4f3da3082e5b60ded9f40a7499434d6f41ad161d","c99c5f79e160da17f063e72dde71212f8785270b","9313e1f586cc1892ad576e75a538796825fabb9d","5eab91951a6ff07668d0e526c5d0f726afc11962","b4e55580f68d5d38adbd6736b4c308f5dc51f3ea","28cd3c5221db523f10959289a1c12877a222b467","2dc2d5d2ce7da338fa7e16ddc1f01ae29537c517","ebe25eaa0f4a7a33d4a86392378e5307bdf558c7","eb1e1d29a2c10ac71afc830dc3d00a8febb312d7","b6d536daf22e8482b2b0792fbdd72ef0876ce58e","f099258e2edba814f77c2524448cdaa7960d90cd","c7d45fca2b5358bfd3148fd74c5321b9a0acf1a4","dd0c661afe5bc8c9d9f80132e1fb980a29a964f8","af99d4c815eb0bf6df5abd3c4aae025339eefd0e","8b6ec5704e4cbe188488459f69aa6da30db832ef","81459757f67b7b6f624d3a65a08e9e5b796aa409","97ea75cb71e623fcf9fbf195735a6549e27fe0fd","fa1f237a54246d9489b628bd1bb7213b29b86e6a","951b6352d22d21b7c5b660f32e8c15a9a017b9fe","1489058ea0c4e7a0f4f1640a30a382355ccc4cd1","900728c164ddfe9e0db0239ae8cf706b0e51cb4d","c3d0cbf3a4f6fe0c9df9533e06035349dc53bab2","7e7bc7a7695c2836888d4f437279bfe93cf728f8","46e6d6d4c8e16eae87150c9c49f4a7e94835edd5","bba43571b944acab6ee3b8fac96481

Three 120-head grow-finish rooms were separately fitted with a heat recovery ventilator and forced-air heater tandem, ground source heating system, and a forced convection heater. Effect of the heating systems on energy consumption, air quality and animal performance was monitored. Results showed that the use of HRV and GSHP systems during the heating season resulted to 54% and 45% reduction, respectively, in total energy consumption for heating and ventilation relative to a conventional heater. The overall air temperature, air quality and pig performance in the rooms with different heating systems were relatively similar. Analysis of the costs incurred for implementing these heating systems showed that the HRV system had 16% lower heating and ventilation energy costs during the heating season compared to a conventional room, which can readily offset the capital and operating costs for installing the HRV system. On the other hand, the GSHP system required substantial capital and labour costs, which were mostly needed during the installation of the system. Finally, a software tool was developed which would be valuable for analyzing current energy use patterns in existing barns and for assessing potential options that can be implemented in swine production facilities to reduce overall barn energy consumption.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Reducing Energy Consumption in Swine Grow-finish Rooms using Heat Recovery Ventilator and Ground Source Heating System","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

The threading dislocation density of the GaN/sapphire template was approximately 1 × 109 cm–2. The maximum UV output power obtained was as high as 4.1 mW with an injection current of 160 mA under room temperature (RT) CW operation. The maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) was 1.02% with an injection current of 60 mA, which is higher than the EQE obtained for a 350 nm-band AlGaN-based QW LED fabricated on GaN substrate. From these result, we confirmed the advantage of the use of quaternary InAlGaN for 350 nm-band UV emitters in comparison with the use of AlGaN. (© 2005 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The plan-do-check-act cycle of pull planning demanded continuous involvement of team members which was resource intensive.

Flow visualization data indicated significant differences between the measured velocity profiles and Nusselt’s predictions in wavy turbulent films. Also, the experimental data have shown that wave-induced turbulence produces a flat velocity profile within the large disturbance waves and also affects the flow in the substrate film depending on the wave amplitude.

At baseline, the children with epilepsy had poorer everyday memory than the healthy control group. Memory did not change significantly over time in the children with epilepsy, and no changes were found related to surgery or to seizure outcome.

Automation is thought to be high advanced but there are more and more doubts evolving. Results from automation have to be interpreted with care, software has to be taken with caution and raw data have to be carefully and individually checked. Do we have to go back to the past and analyse each protein individually? Now, technology, hardware, is advanced we have to carefully and rapidly work on identification software and ‘‘software’’ in the scientists’ brains. Identification of pitfalls in proteomics is mandatory and the many newcomers in the booming proteomic area have to be trained to prevent overload literature with identifications just based upon ‘‘highest score’’ printed out from instruments.","inCitations":["0a1ca3434c8efaa5c87e6a81522f0c61a27b4f96"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Pitfalls in Proteomics 1","doi":"10.1007/s00726-004-0100-x","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00726-004-0100-x","venue":"Amino Acids"}

While the coder provides excellent compression efficiency, it is computationally demanding. On typical general-purpose processors, it can take up to hundreds of cycles to encode a single bit. In this paper, we propose an architecture for a CABAC encoder that can easily be incorporated into system-on-chip designs for H.264 compression. The CABAC is inherently serial and we divide the problem into several stages to derive a design that can provide a throughput of two cycles per encoded bit. The engine proposed is capable of handling binarization of the syntactical elements and provides the coded bit-stream via a first-in first-out buffer. The design is implemented on an Altera FPGA platform that can run at 50 MHz enabling a 25 Mbps encoding rate.","inCitations":["ef77f373d26b5f4fee4236a90b7f4886cadf6a67","1a9466f484ff184a7d93f851a6b9350f09be4ff9","42b097d894ffa2dcd7d92d6a1c11fb0eba5b8f1e","ef731996381adf1b112d8d6fe8ccbb2964051e2c"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"A hardware architecture for a context-adaptive binary arithmetic coder","doi":"10.1117/12.596811","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1117/12.596811","venue":"IS&T/SPIE Electronic Imaging"}

Researches were made to determine the rate of the oxygen consumption and the Co2: 02 ratio in tissues treated with lichens' extracts. Germinating seeds, grown up roots and root tips of Allium cepa have been used as researche material. The lichens, whose action has been tested, are the following: Usnea barbata, Evernia vulpina, Evernia furfuracea, Evernia prunastri, Peltigera carina, Cladonia pyxidata. Phosphate solutions, buffered at pH 6,8 proved useful as extractive solutions. Measurements made with the Warburg-Barcroft microrespirometer showed a strong decrease of the oxygen absorbed and a remarkable alteration of the respiratory quotient; a particularly poisonous effect appears to be caused by Usnea barbata, as it is also evidenced by microscopical observations.

(SPAQ). These drugs retain their efficacy in the areas where SMC is recommended, but alternative regimens are needed if SMC is used in other areas or if these drugs start to lose efficacy. The aim of this study was to investigate the suitability of dihydroartemisin-piperaquine (DHAPQ) for SMC, using a non-inferiority trial design. 1500 children randomized to receive SPAQ or DHAPQ monthly from August to October, and a cohort of untreated children outside the trial, were followed-up for malaria. SPAQ was more efficacious than DHAPQ, but the difference was within the margin set for non-inferiority. Both regimens gave a very high level of protection lasting 4 weeks. Protection was related to dosage. Both regimens were well tolerated, incidence of mild adverse events decreased in successive months, consistent with toleration to study drugs. In malaria cases, the frequency of the CVIET haplotype of pfcrt, the 86Y polymorphism of pfmdr1, and pfdhfr59 and dhps437 mutations, was greater among children who received SPAQ than in untreated children. However the number of cases, and the prevalence of parasitaemia, was much lower in treated children, reducing the scope for SMC to select for resistance. The frequency of the CVIET haplotype of PfCRT, thought to be associated with resistance to PQ, was not increased in children treated with DHAPQ. There was an enormous burden of malaria in the untreated children. SMC with SPAQ should be introduced for children in Burkina Faso without delay. DHAPQ is a potential alternative regimen in areas where SPAQ cannot be used but there are some drawbacks associated with its use. There is a need to develop alternative long-acting drugs with simple regimens that can be used for chemoprevention of malaria.","inCitations":["9886c2cb8455d8e39ba0579b0b168dd6900a1e2b","94c3192455f18b61c4f8dbaa163b32f88a70601e"],"pdfUrls":["http://researchonline.lshtm.ac.uk/2026584/1/2014_EPH_PhD_Zongo_Issaka.pdf","https://researchonline.lshtm.ac.uk/2026584/1/2014_EPH_PhD_Zongo_Issaka.pdf"],"title":"Efficacy, safety, tolerability of Dihydroartemisinine-Piperaquine and Sulfadoxine-Pyrimethamine plus Amodiaquine for Seasonal Malaria Chemoprevention (SMC) in children in Burkina Faso","doi":"10.17037/PUBS.02026584","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.17037/PUBS.02026584","venue":""}

The methods used, atomic force microscopy (AFM), white-light interferometry, and confocal laser scanning microscopy (LSM), utilize very different mechanisms of image formation. We find good agreement between data measured by AFM and by white-light interferometry. The two techniques complement each other. AFM is not limited to reflecting samples, it has a better resolution than interferometry, and it can measure steeper slopes. White-light interferometry is faster and allows larger areas to be analysed, and data from neighbouring areas can be spliced more easily. When used on strongly reflecting, rolled or etched aluminium surfaces, LSM yields results that deviate strongly from those of the other two methods and from the true sample surface topography.","inCitations":["2f14c6d69ca42c8d1ef4b820870f70c5a859f79b","8d4c6a97bd85d1179f4972828ca7d0bfa434dacc","9c6b61a022708cee994e9b99b514a9d235a3df7b","dbf6d5f36807d394fa86eb625676a90d31cc2cd3","6cda753070cd0166180602599332c6cde3ad9af7","cf60173f00b55f3c336b429d91ee33132b6d1ca6","180edc3cfdfddeb9710a767984a1aea06f2cb6f0"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Quantitative topography measurements of rolled aluminium surfaces by atomic force microscopy and optical methods","doi":"10.1016/S0257-8972(98)00828-7","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/S0257-8972%2898%2900828-7","venue":""}

In truth, though, science is always conditioned by political reality--and by money. So writes journalist Daniel Greenberg in this wideranging indictment of the way in which science is conducted in the United States. Although funding for scientific research has been readily available since the end of World War II, he maintains, research bureaucrats have transformed the enterprise into a clever, well-financed claimant for money and the successful quest for that funding into a condition of employment and advancement. Given that climate, Greenberg suggests, basic research has suffered, so that many diseases go unconquered, while more politically glamorous investigations are rewarded. Increasingly corporatized--industry, he writes, accounts for two-thirds of all research and development dollars spent, and its profit-seeking values are radiating throughout the culture--scientific research is insufficiently policed and criticized, watched over only by the inmates. In the rush for funding, Greenberg argues, science becomes increasingly subject to ethical lapses, with scientists too easily endorsing dubious causes such as the so-called Star Wars missile-defense system and too readily putting human subjects in danger. Greenbergs arguments are broad but well supported, and his book is sure to excite controversy within the scientific community. Lay readers, however, will also find it of much interest. --Gregory McNamee","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://is-this-book-good.info/wp-content/uploads/pdfs/Science%20%20Money%20%20and%20Politics%20Political%20Triumph%20and%20Ethical%20Erosion%20by%20Daniel%20S%20Greenberg%20-%20A%20Polemical%20Triumph.pdf"],"title":"Science, Money, and Politics: Political Triumph and Ethical Erosion (review)","doi":"10.1093/jhmas/57.3.371","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1093/jhmas%2F57.3.371","venue":""}

As avaliacoes de impacto dos programas de transferencia de renda sobre alimentacao dos beneficiarios brasileiros sao escassas e nao apresentam resultados consistentes. OBJETIVO: Avaliar o impacto do Programa Bolsa Familia (doravante denominado programa) sobre a aquisicao de alimentos em familias de baixa renda no Brasil. METODOS: Foram utilizados dados da Pesquisa de Orcamentos Familiares realizada em 2008-09 em uma amostra probabilistica de 55.970 domicilios brasileiros. Esta pesquisa coletou em cada domicilio dados relativos a quantidade e custo de todas as aquisicoes de alimentos e bebidas realizadas em um periodo de sete dias consecutivos. O valor per capita do gasto semanal e da energia diaria, relativos a cada item alimentar, foram calculados. A avaliacao de impacto foi realizada para o conjunto dos domicilios de baixa renda (com renda per capita inferior a R$210,00) e, separadamente, para os domicilios deste conjunto com renda superior e inferior a mediana, doravante denominados, respectivamente, domicilios pobres e extremamente pobres. O impacto do programa sobre a aquisicao de alimentos foi estabelecido comparando-se indicadores da aquisicao de alimentos entre domicilios beneficiados e nao beneficiados pelo programa, que foram agrupados em blocos e pareados com base no escore de propensao de cada domicilio possuir moradores beneficiarios. Pelo metodo do pareamento com escore de propensao criaram-se blocos de domicilios beneficiados e nao beneficiados pelo programa homogeneos com relacao a um grande elenco de potenciais variaveis de confundimento para a associacao entre a condicao de participar do programa e a aquisicao domiciliar de alimentos. Os indicadores da aquisicao de alimentos utilizados incluiram o gasto com a aquisicao de alimentos e a quantidade de alimentos adquirida ou sua disponibilidade. Os valores per capita do montante gasto em reais e da disponibilidade em energia foram comparados levando-se em conta o conjunto dos itens alimentares e tres grupos criados com base na extensao e proposito do processamento industrial a que o item alimentar foi submetido: alimentos in natura ou minimamente processados, ingredientes culinarios processados e produtos prontos para consumo (processados ou ultraprocessados).(AU)","inCitations":["0c56f4c249086743ab0e0e4da0925d7b209b4fae","988de44ad22611a2c8555cc717a2849756e85cfe","9b34adc358864598fe57ef0ad31b8e62067265d1","c5bdbadd8e2358ed0b23c45c3570f055bb27287f"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Impacto do Programa Bolsa Família sobre a aquisição de alimentos em famílias brasileiras de baixa renda","doi":"10.11606/T.6.2013.tde-25062013-155356","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.11606/T.6.2013.tde-25062013-155356","venue":""}

The first task in this research was the determination of the correct moisture calibration curve for the nuclear gages being used (Troxler Models 227 and 2401). Forty-three soils sampled from the three physiographic areas of Virginia and having optimum moisture contents ranging from 5% to 40% were tested. It was found that for the Model 227 gage two calibration curves produced better results than did one calibration curve. With one curve the standard error was 2.7 pef (0.04 g/cc), while for two curves the errors were 1.4 and 1.7 pef (0.02 and 0.03 g/cc), which are judged to be acceptable for compliance testing. From an investigation of the physical and chemical properties of the soils tested it was concluded that the separation of the two curves could be based on optimum moisture content, and that the separation value should be 21%. At this point in the study, the testing of the Model 227 gage was discontinued because the Virginia Department of Highways had replaced all of these gages with the Model 2401. The Model 2401 gage requires only one calibration curve, which has a standard error of 1.7 pef (0.03 g/cc). Using this gage and its single calibration curve, five moisture standards were developed.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Refinement of moisture calibration curves for nuclear gage : interim report no. 1","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

In contrast to earlier studies of prothrombin cleavage in chemically defined systems, the current investigation examines the fragmentation of human prothrombin in normal plasma. Radiolabeled prothrombin was added to platelet-poor relipidated normal human plasma, and clotting was initiated with the addition of Ca(II) and kaolin. Analysis of the radiolabeled prothrombin cleavage products by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of dodecyl sulfate and beta-mercaptoethanol identified a heretofore unobserved product of prothrombin activation with an apparent molecular weight of 45,000. This product was identified as fragment 1 X 2 X 3, the NH2-terminal 286 amino acids of prothrombin. The product was isolated from a prothrombin digest by immunoaffinity chromatography using anti-prothrombin:Ca(II) antibodies and by preparative gel electrophoresis. Its amino-terminal sequence is identical to that of prothrombin. Digestion of this product with either Factor Xa or thrombin yields, at a minimum, fragment 1 X 2 and fragment 1. Amino-terminal sequence analysis of the products obtained by digestion with Factor Xa of the unknown activation product indicated 3 amino acid residues at each cycle consistent with the presence of fragment 1, fragment 2, and fragment 3. To unambiguously identify the COOH-terminal amino acid sequence of the product, its factor Xa digestion products were separated by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography. Edman degradation of one peptide revealed the complete sequence of fragment 3. On this basis, we identify the Mr 45,000 polypeptide as fragment 1 X 2 X 3 and indicate that it is a prominent product of prothrombin conversion to thrombin when activation occurs in plasma.","inCitations":["f11693d7e88d69aebbf128c28b36465910d92223","6552102b65de3722a4cc4ac6db2c2e4c86d9610f","2e7a60e4f13915d1dcdbbc289c108f4bcba2b666","ebbb82846c9080f18a61ccf5393a569c0d3afece","5fd4cb7718e47e92b6aaf7e39984ebe0576485b6","1bebec652efcf92a05a71d37c4bb6f07491acf4f","3159546334566eb8cf7034b560b8467b1f168d7e","9a2f5d22c92f8897ae83a54268c37796d2130c60","f0245f8ee63ca34a3aaf870cf85da66d6e23570a","a2021a362dec971c7ea7a5b46a5ef9914b6be4d0","47a5fb7281c49734ed7e7857b04b5463f50583b6","e75d60c10587db8593a7bdcc5e7b5892d2ee49e1","2a4ba00cf0a5f13e6494ad18d59e531a457d69ec","17cf299f94cccb5f422b2b60556efe21385bea97","4b84e868f07e0d0f55e3f2d363e109b53427aedb","2c9772856b103fccddb1bf17590f93884ec37ef7","18ba0278a3102ed5c1a63930013f9e438cf25bf4","19e4238a16845b397a9a4423cb4da568d22cff89"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Prothrombin fragment 1 X 2 X 3, a major product of prothrombin activation in human plasma.","doi":"10.1055/s-0038-1652318","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0038-1652318","venue":"The Journal of biological chemistry"}

Material and Methods Six patients had a standard cystometry performed as a control. To optimize stimulation parameters conditional electrical stimulation using 8, 15 and 30 pulses per second (pps) in randomized order was performed during three subsequent cystometries. The stimulation was performed on the penile/clitoral nerve in response to one or more hyperreflexic detrusor contractions during the three cystometries. Results Mean cystometric capacity increase compared to control: 1 cystometry 48%, 2 59%, 3 63%. The most effective pulse-frequency was 8 pps. Increase compared to control: 8 pps 70%, 15 pps 43% 30 pps 57%. Conclusion Our findings suggest that repetition of conditional stimulation may lead to potentiation rather than habituation. A stimulation frequency of 8 pps seems to be more effective than 15 pps and 30 pps. Introduction Spinal cord injured patients with a lesion above the sacral micturition center suffer from detrusor sphincter dyssynergia and detrusor hyperreflexia. The injury impairs or eliminates the regulatory input from the higher centres, leading to lower urinary tract dysfunction. Detrusor hyperreflexia disturbs the storage function and it may cause incontinence and reflux. The pharmacological treatments are in many cases insufficient to prevent incontinence episodes and high bladder pressures. More efficient treatments for detrusor hyperreflexia involve surgery, either in bladder augmentation procedures or in dorsal rhizotomy. Bladder augmentation procedures carries side-effects related to the mucosal surface of the neo-bladder, whereas rhizotomy involves irreversible division of nerves and leads to loss of reflex erection. Activity in the dorsal penile/clitoral nerve, which is an exclusively afferent branch of the pudendal nerve, is inhibitory to the micturition reflex. Our group performed a study in 10 spinal cord injured patients using conditional short duration stimulation of the dorsal penile/clitoral nerve (2-25 s). The parameters were: 20 pulses per second (pps), pulsewidth 200 μs, amplitude 2 times threshold for eliciting the bulbocavernosus reflex. Hyperreflexic contraction could be inhibited repeatedly and cystometric capacity was increased by 72%. In order to optimize the stimulation parameters the present study was initiated. By performing conditional stimulation using different pulse-frequencies during 3 consecutive standard cystometries, the effect of repeated treatments and of different pulse-frequencies can be investigated. The study is ongoing. Material and Methods The local ethical committee approved of the study, and informed consent was obtained from the 6 patients enrolled. Inclusion criteria were: detrusor hyperreflexia demonstrated at less than 500 ml infused during a standard cystometry on the day of the experiment, complete or incomplete suprasacral spinal cord injury irrespective of pathophysiological origin, age over 18 years and 6 months or more post injury. Exclusion criteria were: damage to peripheral nerves involved in the reflex-loops investigated, other serious disease or pregnancy. Medical treatment for detrusor hyperreflexia or other diseases was not discontinued prior to the experiment Cystometries were performed according to ICSdefinitions transurethrally, as one continuous infusion of body-warmth saline with an infusion-rate of 60 ml/min via a Ch-8 catheter while intra-vesical pressure was measured through another Ch-8 catheter, using a Dantec Menuet®, Dantec Duet® or an MMS® Urodynamic Computer. Cystometric capacity was established as leakage volume, the volume at which hyperreflexic phase started defined as the part of the cystometry where repeated contractions merged and led to a prolonged phase of oscillatory high pressures, or the maximal infused volume of 600 ml. The cystometry performed as part of the inclusion criteria served as the patient ́s control-cystometry. Electrical stimulation was performed using a bipolar electrode (HUSH-barTM electrode, Dantec-Medtronic®), which was held by the investigator on the skin over the dorsal penile/clitoral nerve. Switching stimulation-trains on/off was performed manually, the \"stimulation on\"-trigger signal being a increase in Pdet of 5 cmH2O, the \"stimulation off\"-trigger signal being a decrease in Pdet. Both triggersignals were obtained by visual inspection of the monitor of of the Urodynamic Computer. Pulsefrequencies of 8, 15 and 30 pps were tested in randomised order (Table 1). Repeated stimulationsequences were performed in response to repeated bladder contractions during one cystometry. Control cystometric capacity was compared to the 3 treatment cystometry capacities.

Da alle diese Quellen hochst fragmentarisch erhalten sind, habe ich mich zusatzlich auf die Erkenntnisse der Neoanalyse gestutzt, deren Vertreter es sich zur Aufgabe gemacht haben, durch Anspielungen auf Vor- und Extrahomerisches Elemente aus alterem Sagengut und nebeneinander existierenden Mythenvarianten zu identifizieren. Im letzten Teil der Arbeit erfolgt eine ausfuhrliche Charakterisierung und eine Art psychoanalytische Betrachtung des Achilleus. Dabei habe ich auch dem Verhaltnis zwischen Achill und seiner Mutter Thetis meine Aufmerksamkeit gewidmet, da dieses die Einstellung des Peliden zu anderen Frauen sehr stark beeinflusst. Das Ergebnis meiner Arbeit ist die Erkenntnis, dass jede Begegnung des Achill mit einer Frau in irgendeiner Weise schief geht, mitunter sogar mit einem Mord bzw. mit dem Tod von vielen endet.

A major contributing factor behind the volatile value of won, Korea's currency, is the government regulation that prohibits won-denominated fund transfers between non-residents, thus preventing an offshore won market from developing. This paper proposes that offshore won trades be permitted as a first step towards the internationalisation of won. Given the size of Korea's economy, stock market, and competiveness and scale of the non-financial industrial sectors, further liberalisation measures of the Korean financial market including permitting an offshore won market will contribute to a more liquid and stable currency market, and thus the overall stability of the financial market.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"On the issue of currency internationalisation - South Korean won","doi":"10.1504/IJEBR.2015.067367","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1504/IJEBR.2015.067367","venue":""}

A linear response was observed from 2.30 to 11.20 μg Hg L(-1). The relative standard deviation was 3.20% (n = 11, 6.81 μg Hg L(-1)), the sample throughput was 4 sample h(-1), and the detection limit was 0.68 μg Hg L(-1). The obtained results with the flow-batch method are in good agreement with those obtained with the reference method.

The sensor can generate strong surface fluorescence as a result of the Cation–Cation Interaction between U (VI) and Eu(III). We used this property to design a surface fluorescence sensing method to detect U (VI). Under suitable conditions, the linear range was 0.02–5 nmol mL−1 and the detection limit was 8 × 10−3 nmol mL−1.

Pola usahatani berbasis karet telah diusahakan petani di Sumatera Selatan selama bertahun-tahun. Salah satu lokasi di Provinsi Sumatera Selatan yang mengusahakan tanaman sela sebagai sumber pendapatan tambahan adalah Desa Pangkul di Kota Prabumulih. Penelitian ini bertujuan menampilkan gambaran mengenai usahatani karet dengan tanaman sela dan pendapatan yang diperoleh dari pengusahaan pola usahatani ini. Metode yang digunakan dalam pengambilan data melalui diskusi langsung dengan kelompok tani yang beranggotakan 23 orang dengan didampingi oleh perangkat desa dan petugas Penyuluh Pertanian Lapangan (PPL). Hasil penelitian menunjukkan bahwa petani di Desa Pangkul pada umumnya telah mempunyai minat dan motivasi yang kuat untuk menerapkan teknologi anjuran. Hal ini terlihat dari produksi tanaman karet yang cukup tinggi serta input yang diberikan pada tanaman karet dan tanaman sela sudah sesuai dengan anjuran. Tanaman sela yang umum diusahakan petani meliputi tanaman sayur-sayuran dan bibit karet. Tanaman sayur-sayuran dapat dipanen dalam waktu singkat sehingga pengusahaannya dapat dilakukan secara intensif. Pada umumnya tanaman sela diusahakan selama tiga tahun masa tanaman belum menghasilkan (TBM). Rata-rata pendapatan usahatani dari tanaman sela adalah Rp 7 juta per bulan. Pendapatan yang diperoleh dari tanaman sela cukup tinggi terutama dari tanaman tomat kecil yaitu sekitar 67% dari total pendapatan usahatani.

Members of Baculoviridae have a large double-stranded DNA genome within the nucleoprotein core of a rod-shaped virion. Baculovirus replication produces two different virion phenotypes: occlusion-derived virions, which initiate infection, and budded virions, which spread infection within the host. Baculoviruses have been isolated only from insects, and have a potential role in insect pest management. The development of cell culture systems and the application of molecular biology led to the development of baculoviruses as popular expression vectors. This chapter summarizes the current state of baculovirology, covering: baculovirus classification, taxonomy, and phylogeny; basic characteristics of baculovirus virions and viral occlusions; features of two unrelated groups of occluded viruses (entomopoxviruses and cypoviruses) and a related group of non-occluded viruses (nudiviruses); mechanisms of infection, gene expression, and replication; their pathology, ecology, and use as biopesticides; and potential new frontiers for study of this group of viruses.","inCitations":["9827879052be4d0bb62d63162987710c2a2e25e8","a523aedcaa657825bcd9a3e9cf13d09b8ff41a83","e70e91164ef147a57e20624ecc9b302646dca6a9","c014c6158ad278deba96ecb265006bb81e30db87","bf37bcf7d2c46155a7fa4fc5b30602e4708576e1","20c238642cec3554ab2c226ca988adccdf3d94ee","6a4606c20795e4134a2e252f4d2dd535bac12679","bb510fc2374aab91004bf88271f1c8905327d8e7","cc22f0429ec57f1e2a584ef6d5de8840f6a5a196","89dbcc32373adb4a8b0d9482600cf25a5e09e7a4","59292c3077d6210b103b8886cde5841e0d719d87","89bb242180a42ffacdbbf967802b8f59deec1d05","610663e7abdb66dd0172ad72c4da3a2378830945","dd4704f57dc940c0b9136da8f4ac20b2c778283f","00a26f7c6f4407141a562ef4bc0664fdd5b3b06a","52f9e06f9909a5dd77a1519ba8b6f17217dac3d7","aea2560187614598ea3d821991187288db136b62","9e327ca4db0d03efb29c1619e3dbdb0ae03551c8","825e91e03c5231629198e31f5c61c91f3953cc4c","e9c2e8bed091f7163cdccb1bfb8fe87a26c56660","a44a6683cd6b22ac877981e85f438ce3845af457","8e49df4581c7158d3305ced48b7c62e43892ea8d","b88a51b0d61426fd78c08bc7694e1621c73799e9","742c844871c42c03fa00a1f33dde9024808bf30c","ae034754e975c44161ba22295d4a0dce565a4fd1","dc356740a69f94ee37188bba4306b010feb1516e","21c3732c408dad4bbe303de215650fc2a519b04b","772c5fc10d2bd0ef2f0946a3e63761f81019cf7a","89c79a5b62d264e111930b51aaecb7343b24b7a9","cb06add3a3b8a1f588f7877f9f84ada131c5539c"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Baculoviruses and Other Occluded Insect Viruses","doi":"10.1016/B978-0-12-384984-7.00004-X","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-384984-7.00004-X","venue":""}

Improving the current situation involves the creation of a communication capability allowing whale position information to be estimated and exchanged among vessels and other observation assets. An early example of such a system has been implemented for the shipping lane approaches to the harbor of Boston, Massachusetts where ship traffic transits areas of the Stellwagen Bank National Marine Sanctuary frequently used by whales. It uses the Automated Identification Systems (AIS) technology, currently required for larger vessels but becoming more common in all classes of vessels. However, we believe the default mode of AIS operation will be inadequate to meet the long-term needs of whale-ship collision avoidance, and will likewise fall short of meeting other current and future marine safety and security communication needs. This paper explores the emerging safety and security needs for vessel communications, and considers the consequences of a communication framework supporting asynchronous messaging that can be used to enhance the basic AIS capability. The options we analyze can be pursued within the AIS standardization process, or independently developed with attention to compatibility with existing AIS systems. Examples are discussed for minimizing ship interactions with Humpback Whales and endangered North Atlantic Right Whales on the east coast, and North Pacific Right Whales, Bowhead Whales, Humpback Whales, Blue Whales and Beluga Whales in west coast, Alaskan and Hawaiian waters.","inCitations":["6af9caa2ee0d4bdf56b698dfa4cc758de49f2f1d","b506f2534a182c906233377a95f63f66d3be5eaa","21a8af50f59f970be17064e769278bc2c9f87ed8","4207de86ffbed3c0b553e33617eb9f89699cd5d8","d69e94221e5c29cd8b4f0eecb3adfd377666b3dc","1e407a9bbbb3e603d7c39f31808f44316c8bfc49"],"pdfUrls":["https://scholars.unh.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1461&context=ccom","http://vislab-ccom.unh.edu/~schwehr/papers/2009-mcgillivary-IEEEOceans-MTS.pdf","http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a527578.pdf","https://apps.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a527578.pdf","http://vislab-ccom.unh.edu/~schwehr/papers/2009-McGillivary-Abstract-EnhancingAIStoImproveWhaleAvoidance.pdf"],"title":"Enhancing AIS to improve whale-ship collision avoidance and maritime security","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":"OCEANS 2009"}

PERKINS COLLABORATION — The functionality of transparency plus conductivity plays an important role in renewable energy and information technologies, including applications such as solar cells, touch-screen sensors, and flat panel display. However, materials with such seemingly contraindicated properties are difficult to come by. The traditional strategy for designing bulk transparent conductors (TCs) starts from a wide-gap insulator and finds ways to make it conductive by extensive doping. We propose a different strategy [1] for TC design—starting with a metallic conductor and designing transparency by control of intrinsic interband transitions and intraband plasmonic frequency. We identified specific design principles for prototypical intrinsic TC classes and searched computationally for materials that satisfy them. The electron gases in the 3D intrinsic TCs demonstrate intriguing properties, such as periodic 2D electron gas regions with very high carrier density. We will discuss a more extended search of these functionalities, in parallel with stability and growability calculations. [1] X. Zhang, L. Zhang, J. D. Perkins, and A. Zunger, Phys. Rev.

Ash solubility and element solubility were chosen for representing recycling property and they were determined based on the measurement of element content using X-ray Fluorescence Spectrometer (XRF). Results show that water solubilities of both bottom ashes decrease with increasing ash-forming temperature and the water solubility of rice straw ash is higher than that of rice husk ash. Investigations also reveal that the easily soluble elements are K, Cl, S, Na in rice straw ash and K, S in rice husk ash. While the solubilities of K and Na decrease with the increasing ash-forming temperature, the solubilities of S and Cl are independent upon this temperature. Difference between the two ashes indicates that the recycling property of ashes from different parts of the same crop varies considerably.","inCitations":["b151dcf75731534417dbd9dd0422fcfaf8ad7fe1"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Effects of ash-forming temperature on recycling property of bottom ashes from rice residues","doi":"10.1016/j.fuel.2015.09.025","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fuel.2015.09.025","venue":""}

The alpha stress is a prescription for turbulence, for which the only existing plausible candidate is that which develops from the magnetorotational instability (MRI).

The Real-time optical target recognition is realized by temporal multiplexing technique with electronic addressing spatial light modulator. The experiment results show that the proposed OPR system is efficient and reliable.","inCitations":["4b2354cf133e288acf9b93314abb7aa027c3f148"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"A real-time optical automatic target recognition system","doi":"10.1117/12.541420","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1117/12.541420","venue":"SPIE Defense + Commercial Sensing"}

In this circumstance, this paper conducted an in-depth analysis on the 12-year spatial-temporal evolution of the international technology spillover effect and its driving determinants in China during the period of 2003 to 2014. Analytical results highlighted that: (1) As a whole, the international technology spillover effect in general has shown an upward trend in China, except in 2008 and 2012, which are observed as deep-V plunge variations. The plunge in 2008 was more dramatic. After 2011, the growth rate of international technology spillover effect from international import trade and foreign direct investment (FDI) respects slowed obviously down. (2) The spatial distribution of the international technology spillover effect from FDI in China transferred from the ribbon-like pattern to the flake-like pattern, while the effect from import trade held steady with little difference in regional spatial distribution. (3) From the drivers, human capital, economic development, trade openness, and institutional factors promoted the technological spillover effect of import trade channels positively, and financial development, human capital, economic development, and institutional factors promoted the technological spillover effect of FDI channels positively.","inCitations":["00e106a3864d0d44417c390a7959edf755d92f54"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Technology Spillover Effect in China: The Spatiotemporal Evolution and Its Drivers","doi":"10.3390/su11061694","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.3390/su11061694","venue":""}

First, the effects of two nonionic surfactants, Tweens 60 and 80, on rumen protease and cellulase activity and in vivo digestibility was investigated. At 0.25% of either Tweens 60 or 80 in the in vitro reaction mixture, both protease and cellulase activity were enhanced (P < .05). The inclusion of 0.5% Tween 80 in the grass hay diet fed to sheep, increased dry matter intake (DMT) by about 40%, and apparent nutrient digestibility by up to 10 percentage units. Hence, the potential benefits of Tween 80 in ruminant forage rations were established. Secondly, the effect of Teepol HB7 on mixed rumen protease and cellulase activity, and digestibility. Up to 0.3% Teepol increased SH masking significantly, without adverse effects on cellulose degradation and microbial protein adsorption. The effective degradation of canola meal protein was decreased (P < .05), while the in vitro degradation of ruminal fluid soluble protein was reduced by more than 40% with the addition of 0.1% Teepol. In vivo rumen ammonia nitrogen concentration also dropped (P < .05). However, DMI and apparent nutrient digestibility were not affected (P < .05). Thirdly, the proteases of orchard grass were characterized according to their mechanistic reactions and pH dependence. The rate of proteolysis (umol glycine equivalent/g/h) declined with increasing acidity (pH 7-4) and ensiling period.","inCitations":["75868079844c21ab1e32e93652bfead54f39a065","c6a76715021725050410479c83a764cf57fe95b8","077fdc1d97c31b63ce4a33dc3776998d34e3ab63","79645f861c5c1718f0be02caf5f497302eb3d521"],"pdfUrls":["https://open.library.ubc.ca/media/download/pdf/831/1.0094702/1","http://erepository.uonbi.ac.ke/bitstream/handle/11295/26660/kamande_Manipulation%20of%20rumen%20and%20silage%20fermentation?isAllowed=y&sequence=3"],"title":"Manipulation Of Rumen And Silage Fermentation","doi":"10.14288/1.0094702","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.14288/1.0094702","venue":""}

This method applies to any synchronous machine, including Permanent Magnet (PM), wound field and synchronous reluctance machines. If the machine uses permanent magnets, then the proposed method allows the comparison of the machine performance for cold and hot conditions due to the influence of temperature on the magnets strength. The proposed method is implemented with inverter supply using the standard set of sensors that are normally on board of any industrial inverter. Nevertheless, augmented accuracy can be achieved when the identification method is implemented using a high-precision, external data recording device capable of collecting the motor voltages and currents, and the rotor position. The paper reports the experimental flux maps for an internal permanent magnet machine and a comprehensive comparison between the machine performance for cold and hot conditions, including the sensorless operation capability using high frequency injection.","inCitations":["f7ca0b3c22272417dd4bbf4f907b2e36aa03dc6a","fce22e8fc1f6fd977ee7d023cf560f42e631a2b0","d2e0ed9e27e8f6deecaf38bdd3128d6a444deb44","3b1c1f1b5915eb89a59d58055d2bf50b1a145613"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Flux linkage maps identification of synchronous AC motors under controlled thermal conditions","doi":"10.1109/IEMDC.2017.8002334","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEMDC.2017.8002334","venue":"2017 IEEE International Electric Machines and Drives Conference (IEMDC)"}

In the present study, there were no significant differences in HRQoL when comparisons were made between the experimental group and the control group. Results show two main findings for patients in the self-care program (n = 97; mean age 71 years): a significantly better HRQoL in terms of experiencing the symptoms that were the reason for pacemaker implantation, as having decreased or disappeared, and a higher level of perceived exertion in a 1 1/2-minute stair test compared with patients who had standard checkups (n = 115; mean age 73 years). It is important to actively include pacemaker patients in a self-care program while still in the acute phase in the hospital. Health care professionals should support the patient in a kind and professional manner by providing clear, relevant information, and planning a self-care program based on the nurse's assessment of the patient's needs. To enable patients to manage their life situations, training and continued education for health care professionals is necessary so that their efforts are based on a holistic approach to nursing care and recognition of the patient perspective, with emphasis on developing education and counselling for women, patients with atrial fibrillation/sick sinus disease, and patients whose pacemakers have ventricular pacing.","inCitations":["140a3794ae9cef0d87223da854d1e521a6281538","ec6296c379ca28a79e94c7592291823224cfb69c","827665db7457723d702a729ba01985e446eb96a5","048668dbd201ed182aab92fe0fbd345a542988b0","478715735bb326246192c29950d08dd953ec977b","0db9a58905ad3873d16c9e88faaa32d4a3cdd656","92bb2c1a929773dbde92a7205c64fab954a16170","afc86526f24aab42d3135b8ed7844585961add7c","25e76be62f8e3164a814e9759e85f0846862b4f1","897cecf187b54503be357d978f7d91dc7b65642f","f94e4de817d63384ecb009b412e92bfaf7029140"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Effects of a self-care program on the health-related quality of life of pacemaker patients: a nursing intervention study.","doi":"","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"Canadian journal of cardiovascular nursing = Journal canadien en soins infirmiers cardio-vasculaires"}

The panelists consisted of individuals from governmental, industrial, and societal backgrounds, representing the conceptualizations of public interest defined by Krugman and Reid (1980), Galtung (1999), and modified by Book (2004). The findings were analyzed using Rogers’ (2003) Diffusion of Innovations as the theoretical framework, particularly the perceived attributes of innovations in relation to public interest, adopter categories, and the innovation-decision process. Overall, the findings indicate that near-universal (98% of U.S. households) adoption of digital television will occur later than the previously proposed February 17, 2009 transition date and that the federal government’s decision to transition to an all-digital television system is not in the public’s interest. The research also found nine prominent issues facing viewers both during and after the digital television transition. Analyses of these, as well as the applicability of the diffusion framework for analyzing the digital television transition are presented.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://etd.ohiolink.edu/!etd.send_file?accession=bgsu1242667859&disposition=attachment"],"title":"Why do I have to switch to DTV?

Nevertheless, for a given application and a given network architecture the non-trivial task rests to determine the necessary number of neurons and the necessary accuracy (number of bits) per weight for a satisfactory operation. In this paper the accuracy of the weights and the number of neurons are seen as general system parameters which determine the maximal output information (i.e. the approximation error) by the absolute amount (network description complexity) and the relative distribution of information contained in the network. A new principle of optimal information distribution is proposed and the conditions for the optimal system parameters are derived. For two examples, a simple linear approximation of a non-linear, quadratic function and a non-linear approximation of the inverse kinematic transformation used in robot manipulator control, the principle of optimal information distribution gives the the optimal system parameters, i.e. the number of neurons and the different resolutions of the variables.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://www-staff.informatik.uni-frankfurt.de/asa/papers/IJAIT92.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1142/S0218213092000193"],"title":"Determination of Neural Network parameters by Information Theory","doi":"10.1142/S0218213092000193","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1142/S0218213092000193","venue":"International Journal on Artificial Intelligence Tools"}
