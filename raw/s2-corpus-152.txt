Series A. Mathematical and Physical Sciences","paperAbstract":"It has been shown that at 530 °C there is practically no decomposition of olefins not possessing b C—C bond β to the double bond. The rate constants for the decomposition of various olefins at 530 °C over the range of p0 from 25 to 300 mm have been measured. The relative rates of decomposition and polymerization of ethylene at 530, 600 and 630 °C have been studied. On the basis of chromatographic analysis of the reaction products both in the presence and in the absence of nitric oxide it is concluded that the ethane formed comes mainly from the secondary decomposition of polymers. At 530 °C the inhibitory activity of nitric oxide is exerted only on some olefins and even then it is rather small. All olefins are, however, subject to a remarkable stimulatory activity of nitric oxide. Over the range of pressures investigated this accelerating effect on the decomposition depends linearly on the olefin and nitric oxide pressures r0 = k0[RK] + k2[RH] [NO]. The values of the constants for different olefins have been determined. The order of magnitude of the constant k2 was found to be the same for all olefins investigated except ethylene and propylene, the values lying between 1.0 x 10-4 and 3.0 x 10-4 min -1 (mm NO)-1. Propylene, which possesses an unusually small number (3) of weak C—H bonds and only primary ones, gave (by an indirect method) the lower value (2 ± 1) x 10-6 min-1 (mm NO)-1. Ethylene, the only olefin without weak C—H bonds, gave (by an indirect method), a value of k2 of about (4 ± 1) x 10-6 min-1 (mm NO)-1. The reaction of hydrogen abstraction from the olefin molecule by nitric oxide is assumed responsible for the stimulatory phenomenon. The low value of k2 for ethylene compared with the values for other olefins and for paraffins can be explained as a result of the strengthening influence of the double bond on the C—H bond with the doubly bound carbon atom. The different roles of the inhibitory and accelerative functions of nitric oxide in the decomposition of paraffins and olefins are considered to be mainly responsible for the changes in the shape of the ∆p–time curves as PNOis varied. On this basis the phenomenon of the apparently transistory activity of nitric oxide as an inhibitor in some cases can be explained.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Investigations on the thermal decomposition of olefins","doi":"10.1098/rspa.1962.0040","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1098/rspa.1962.0040","venue":"Proceedings of the Royal Society of London.

First rib fractures are associated with major thoracic trauma and may involve injury to subclavian vessels, brachial plexus, and mediastinal structures. But these complications are more often seen following unilateral first rib fractures. In contrast, bilateral first rib fractures may follow insignificant trauma, suggesting a different mechanism involved. Serious vascular injuries and brachial plexus injuries are rare and angiograms for evaluation of these patients aren't routinely warranted. The case that we report illustrates this very point.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Bilateral first rib fractures: A case report","doi":"10.4103/0975-2870.140493","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.4103/0975-2870.140493","venue":""}

Muraille","ids":["6093802"]}],"journalName":"Frontiers in Microbiology","paperAbstract":"Acquired immunity against infectious disease (AIID) has long been considered as strictly dependent on the B and T lymphocytes of the adaptive immune system. Consequently, AIID has been viewed as highly specific to the antigens expressed by pathogens. However, a growing body of data motivates revision of this central paradigm of immunology. Unrelated past infection, vaccination, and chronic infection have been found to induce cross-protection against numerous pathogens. These observations can be partially explained by the poly-specificity of antigenic T and B receptors, the Mackaness effect and trained immunity. In addition, numerous studies highlight the importance of microbiota composition on resistance to infectious disease via direct competition or modulation of the immune response. All of these data support the idea that a non-negligible part of AIID in nature can be nonspecific to the pathogens encountered and even of the antigens expressed by pathogens. As this protection may be dependent on the private T and B repertoires produced by the random rearrangement of genes, past immune history, chronic infection, and microbiota composition, it is largely unpredictable at the individual level. However, we can reasonably expect that a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms will allow us to statistically predict cross-protection at the population level. From an evolutionary perspective, selection of immune mechanisms allowing for partially nonspecific AIID would appear to be advantageous against highly polymorphic and rapidly evolving pathogens. This new emerging paradigm may have several important consequences on our understanding of individual infectious disease susceptibility and our conception of tolerance, vaccination and therapeutic strategies against infection and cancer.

Since it is difficult to identify species from the macroalgal fragments within the gut contents of the sea urchin by microscopic observation, we tried to apply a DNA barcoding method for gut contents analysis. We used a partial rbcL gene sequence for taxonomic section and newly designed primer sets, respectively, for brown algae and for red algae. Direct sequencing of the PCR products was carried out. Species identification was based on the phylogenetic relationship. We could objectively identify four species and two taxonomic groups (genus or family) in brown algae, and two species and four taxonomic groups in red algae from the gut contents. Sargassum hemiphyllum was the most abundant brown alga in the gut contents but was not dominant in the study site. The result showed the importance of identification to the species level. In addition, red algal epiphytes were detected with brown algal fragments. The DNA barcoding method will enable the researchers to verify the important role of epiphytes as a potential food source.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Molecular identification of macroalgal fragments in gut contents of the sea urchin Hemicentrotus pulcherrimus","doi":"10.1007/s12562-017-1080-6","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s12562-017-1080-6","venue":"Fisheries Science"}

After using coconut fruit, outer shell is released to the environment as a waste material. Recently, several research studies have been carried out to investigate a possibility of utilize this waste as building material. The block manufactured using Crushed Coconut Shell (CCS) has shown acceptable structural properties and thermal performances at 28 days. Since the coconut shell is a biodegradable material it is important to investigate long term behaviour of CCS based masonry block. As masonry blocks are used as wall, an investigation on the behaviour of a wall panel is useful. In this study, long term behaviour of CCS based block and panel were investigated. Compressive strength, water absorption and thermal performances of the individual block, which was manufactured twelve months ago, were determined. These solid masonry blocks having the size of 360 mm×100 mm×170 mm were cast with a mix proportion of 1:5 cement-sand by using local block manufacturing machine. Crushed coconut shell was used as replacement for coarse aggregates (chips) with 25 % (volume basis). Internal surface and external surface temperatures of the block were measured by using thermocouples. In addition, load-displacement curve of the wall panel subjected to vertical static loading was investigated. As a further development of the block, cost analysis was carried out. From the experimental study, it was found that in long term also, the CCS based blocks exhibit the similar thermal performances as in the short term. Compressive strength and water absorption found in the current study were compared with the same properties at 28 days found in a previous study. Cost analysis study confirms that CCS based block is economical compared with the conventional block.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://dl.lib.mrt.ac.lk/bitstream/handle/123/9018/SBE-12-170.pdf;sequence=1"],"title":"Properties of masonry panel and blocks manufactured with crushed coconut shells (CCS)","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

The radiation-induced intensity changes of the L1 2 superlattice reflections were monitored by TEM technique using a computer assisted, quantitative evaluation of the amplitudes of diffraction patterns obtained by image plates. The dynamical diffraction theory where the thickness of the investigated foils was taken into account was employed to determine the degree of order from the diffraction patterns. The fluences were varied up to 10 dpa. The results are compared with recent measurements of disordered zone sizes after low dose ion irradiation in Ni 3 Al. The measured temperature dependence below room temperature is consistent with the predictions of the thermal spike model for disordering, but for higher temperatures the results hint to a more complicated re-ordering process in disordered areas. A Ni 3 Al specimen which was completely disordered after 10 dpa at 200 K was used for a thermal annealing experiment. The annealing behavior confirms the importance of the heterogeneous state of the order for the re-ordering process under ion irradiation.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Disordering kinetics of Ni3Al under ion irradiation","doi":"10.1016/S0022-3115(98)00711-9","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/S0022-3115%2898%2900711-9","venue":""}

However, the in vivo function for REGgamma in metazoan cells is currently unknown. To understand the role of Drosophila REGgamma we have attempted to identify the type of promoter elements regulating its transcription. Mapping the site of the transcription initiation revealed a TATA-less promoter, and a sequence search identified elements found typically in Drosophila genes involved in cell cycle progression and DNA replication. In order to test the relevance of the motifs, REGgamma transcriptional assays were carried out with mutations in the proposed promoter. Our results indicate that a single Drosophila replication-related element sequence, DRE, is essential for REGgamma transcription. To confirm that REGgamma has a role in cell cycle progression, the effect of removing REGgamma from S2 cells was tested using RNA interference. Drosophila cells depleted of REGgamma showed partial arrests in G1/S cell cycle transition. Immuno-staining of Drosophila embryos revealed that REGgamma is typically localized to the nucleus during embryogenesis with increased levels present in invaginating cells during gastrulation. The REGgamma was found dispersed throughout the cell volume within mitotic domains undergoing cell division. Finally, database searches suggest that the DRE system may regulate key members of the proteasome system in Drosophila.","inCitations":["148b07d8365e31ed7b268a51c2a1932a31412ad7","4444cc3b1af5e683099121ae9fd08967600cbafe","26a1fde383bdb74b3c1bff80d6bca39b885df529","09a396f306e668b637451ec7b604cb2af20e4ce9","c75411da2230426d62ed826d61ee343b1c39fbf7","ca020e5c2018b519e062fcafdf27685fbbe76871","210374543397a5e36e21599051bae80cf674c4fc","820133621f79adfd63235c7de7311fb554e19811","100e4fe53ffcfd4ec9894cd742a540d8146ed2c3","4d99ec60c534ccef556d7095b64cea0580a08cf2","a584d9596804b72aaf28e471ad1af3454635327c","86dc39cda0a7e81fc10742b3bdcbc2e9597680c7","9bf12e97088aff47d2bcee37510d8285a335894f","0b373d41d2b7dafb4dc4b850d0d01e410dbc34a2","8be9598dc85282ba008226f5a21cf4a65860c4f7","b5ca02157c6e21333f9f50a22f688be7432ec241","7c5d0281d75880b85dc00301510382bc88a2d941","f78296becd677c0ea2c7afa7b0c04bc5836d0971","9a68d8e80859bbc2d3d80ae87636e6da2e79da12","28ca81f3cfeb78bf81294a8c4b1eb54e35a9a729"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Drosophila proteasome regulator REGgamma: transcriptional activation by DNA replication-related factor DREF and evidence for a role in cell cycle progression.","doi":"10.1016/S0022-2836(03)00188-8","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/S0022-2836%2803%2900188-8","venue":"Journal of molecular biology"}

It is also known that volcanic activity can be influenced by surface mass loading and the resulting isostatic adjustment of the underlying Earth and that glacial cycles change the distribution of water and ice on the crust. Therefore, the possibility that volcanism might vary in accordance with Milankovich periodicities (changes in the amount and distribution of solar energy incident on Earth due to variations in its orbital configuration) in response to glacial cycling has been an intriguing one. Kutterolf et al. present the most comprehensive data set yet to address this idea, developed from an extensive collection of marine sediment cores from around the Pacific Ocean basin. From these cores, they were able to show that the frequency of circum-Pacific volcanism varied with a 41,000-year period, the obliquity band of Milankovich cycles, and that changes in volcanic activity lagged slightly behind glacial unloading, consistent with the idea that eruptions are forced by the mass distribution variations attendant with deglaciations.\n\nGeology 10.1130/G33419.1 (2012).","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Feeling the Pressure","doi":"10.1126/science.339.6115.11-c","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1126/science.339.6115.11-c","venue":""}

Using zeotropic mixtures as working fluid can provide better temperature matches with the heat source and heat sink, so it is regarded as an efficient approach to improve ORC thermodynamic performance. This paper comparatively investigates the performance of low temperature ORC with pure fluids and zeotropic mixtures. We develop a numerical model considering the size of the heat exchangers to predict both the first law thermal efficiency and cost-effective performance. The results indicate that using mixtures does not gain beneficial effect when the prediction program is improved by taking heat transfer model into account.","inCitations":["2fae0c7d00900b58b96589b002ee7bc71a08d5b9","1fda807b1e7398c1c4f009f2267266dbe3a8cf9a","08561f6b4b420b319e2d26f9518d01050d4899f7"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Potential of Low Temperature Organic Rankine Cycle with Zeotropic Mixtures as Working Fluid","doi":"10.1016/j.egypro.2017.03.444","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.egypro.2017.03.444","venue":""}

Several isoforms of hMCTs are expressed in cancerous tissue as well as in normal tissue. In cancerous tissue, hypoxia induces the expression of hMCT4, which transports the energetic metabolite l-lactate across the plasma membrane. Since hMCT4 is involved in pH regulation and the transport of l-lactate in cancer cells, an hMCT4 inhibitor could function as an anticancer agent. Although several non specific hMCT inhibitors have been developed, a selective hMCT4 inhibitor has not yet been identified. The aim of this study was therefore to identify a selective hMCT4 inhibitor for use as a pharmacological tool for studying hMCT4. The heterologous expression system of the Xenopus oocyte was used to assess the effects of test compounds on hMCT4, whereupon isobutyrate derivatives, fibrates, and bindarit (2-[(1-benzyl-1H-indazol-3-yl)methoxy]-2-methylpropanoic acid) were demonstrated to exhibit selective inhibitory effects against this transporter. It is suggested that the structure formed from the joining of an isobutyrate moiety and two aromatic rings by appropriate linkers is important for acquiring the selective hMCT4-inhibiting activity. These findings provide novel insights into the ligand recognition of hMCT4, and contribute to the development of novel anticancer agents.","inCitations":["26cc857a39ca778a25feb7bbcd200ca6e4460838","b2c5153a7e88348123340794b25736f9ac1e91fa","3afc4938a883d7502ed14027825acc4ae0029028","4deb3782006925067e397e223f073b96692b4c4e","5111e4503fcdbf5ff45a936d1b6557064d39471d"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Identification of a selective inhibitor of human monocarboxylate transporter 4.","doi":"10.1016/j.bbrc.2017.10.025","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2017.10.025","venue":"Biochemical and biophysical research communications"}

In minimally invasive (MI) surgery, since the complex knot-tying maneuvers are extremely tedious, suturing is even more challenging. Knotless fixation implants are, therefore, developed to eliminate the conventional suturing procedure in surgical operations. Barbed sutures [1], surgical staples, and self-closing clips [2] are widely used in open surgical operations. Moreover, special surgical systems such as the Endo Stitch device, the SILS Stitch articulating device, and the Multifire Endo GIA stapler are designed to replace sutures in a variety of MI operations. These devices, however, are not suitable for precise MI surgery in small operation sites since they require considerably large insertion holes and extensive operating cavities. A novel surgical barbed staple and its insertion system, to be used in precise MI operations, are introduced in this work.","inCitations":["60dd8f916d7367eee8174bdcdbd1cec98060d3cd"],"pdfUrls":["http://pasini.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/2014-Javid.pdf"],"title":"A New Surgical Barbed Staple for Minimally Invasive Surgery","doi":"10.1115/1.4027118","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1115/1.4027118","venue":""}

Die abhangig Beschaftigten mit niedrigen Stundenentgelten mussten dagegen erhebliche Reallohnverluste hinnehmen und zeitweilig breitete sich der Niedriglohnsektor immer mehr aus. Diese Trends setzen sich etwa seit Beginn dieses Jahrzehnts nicht mehr fort. Die verschiedenen Lohngruppen profitieren nun gleichmasiger vom durchschnittlichen Lohnanstieg, wenngleich jetzt die Arbeitskrafte mit mittleren Stundenentgelten bei der Lohnentwicklung etwas hinterherhinken. Entsprechend hat sich die Schere zumindest zwischen hohen und geringen Lohnen seitdem nicht weiter geoffnet. Diese Entwicklung ist keineswegs selbstverstandlich, da sich die Struktur der Arbeitsplatze weiter hin zu hoher qualifizierten Tatigkeiten verschiebt. Nach wie vor schneiden die Beschaftigten mit hoheren Stundenverdiensten relativ gut bei der Lohnentwicklung ab; das gilt nicht nur fur den langerfristigen Trend, sondern auch fur die jungere Entwicklung. Eine Langsschnittanalyse anhand von Daten des Sozio-oekonomischen Panels (SOEP) zeigt, dass es vielen Geringverdienern gelingt, uber die Zeit auf deutlich hohere Stundenlohne zu kommen. So zahlte von denjenigen 20 Prozent der Arbeitskrafte mit den niedrigsten Lohnen im Jahr 2010, die in einer Beschaftigung blieben, mehr als die Halfte funf Jahre spater nicht mehr zu den Geringentlohnten. Besonders starke Lohnanhebungen konnten hier die Vollzeitkrafte erzielen. Insgesamt zeigen die Ergebnisse, dass die Stundenlohne nach der Finanzkrise real durchweg zugenommen haben und der Anstieg gleichmasiger als fruher verteilt war. Dennoch haben diese Steigerungen die Reallohnverluste in den unteren vier Dezilen aus den 15 Jahren zuvor nicht wettgemacht.","inCitations":["b7ac1c4479e1a974a2330a4a27ba6ba1ae7bacd7"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Niedrige Stundenverdienste hinken bei der Lohnentwicklung nicht mehr hinterher","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

However, the existing memristor-crossbar based computing is mainly assumed as a multi-level analog computing, whose result is sensitive to process non-uniformity as well as additional overhead from ADconversion and I/O. In this chapter, we explore the matrix-vector multiplication accelerator on a binary memristor-crossbar with adaptive 1-bit-comparator based parallel conversion. Moreover, a distributed in-memory computing architecture is also developed with according control protocol. Both memory array and logic accelerator are implemented on the binary memristor-crossbar, where logic-memory pair can be distributed with protocol of control bus. Experiment results have shown that compared to the analog memristor-crossbar, the proposed binary memristor-crossbar can achieve significant area-saving with better calculation accuracy. Moreover, significant speedup can be achieved for matrix-vector multiplication in the neuron-network based machine learning such that the overall training and testing time can be both reduced respectively.

Additionally, the community expects socially and environmentally responsible behaviour practices; the so-called triple bottom line approach. The paper briefly reviews the development of corporate social responsibility reporting from the perspective of two large Australian banks and attempts to understand their motivation for voluntary disclosure. Stakeholder theory and game theory provide a means to analyse why banks undertake CSR reporting. The paper compares Westpac and National Australia Bank's CSR reporting over the period 2004-2005 utilising external rating agencies and CSR reports to determine the extent of disclosure in relation to employees, environment, community and customers. The paper concludes with a discussion of the pros and cons of CSR, the role of regulation and recommendations for future policy direction.","inCitations":["d8b9c5a51f837836ed71cffec980668c6a67e582","88ed0f4cf6ff48ff8f8eebcbee041b19cce640a8","dd03eb37c79c3a9a564072ad93294dee52b0d7d1","763a2bf8d95a14f5a0f144207fe03e4543bb9fdf"],"pdfUrls":["https://www.virtusinterpress.org/IMG/pdf/10-22495_cocv7i4c1p5.pdf"],"title":"Corporate social responsibility reporting : a business strategy by Australian banks?","doi":"10.22495/cocv7i4c1p5","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.22495/cocv7i4c1p5","venue":""}

In this paper, we present a conference session recommender system. In contrast to the conventional \"query-search\" model where a system passively engages with users, Session Expert actively interacts with users via natural, human-like conversations and provides personalized recommendations. The underlying session recommender engine is designed to handle the cold start problem, and is lightweight to enable real-time session recommendations and rationale-aware response generation. Specifically, the recommender system alleviates the cold start problem by transferring knowledge from another similar conference in an offline setting. This step is achieved by first exploiting a positive-unlabeled (PU) learning model to reveal the underlying user interest from the historical enrollment data, and then modeling a bilinear relationship which captures how user and session features influence users’ interests. Given the learned bilinear model, recommendation scores and rationale can be generated online as it only involves a few matrix-vector multiplications which can be computed efficiently.","inCitations":["1891c984814ae2a7e83e189b3be21c3763450383"],"pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1109/BigData.2018.8622231"],"title":"Session Expert: a Lightweight Conference Session Recommender System","doi":"10.1109/BigData.2018.8622231","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BigData.2018.8622231","venue":"2018 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (Big Data)"}

This environment is an estuary of 91 rivers and channels, surrounded by the metropolis of Rio de Janeiro. The bay receives considerable amounts of contaminants introduced from sewage effluents, industrial discharge, urban and agricultural runoff, atmospheric fallout, and the combined inputs from the rivers, making Guanabara Bay one of the most polluted coastal environments on the Brazilian coastline. The aim of this work is to study the concentration and fractionation of the heavy metals within the sediments of the bay. In order to understand the possible seasonal influence on the heavy metal fractionation, two campaigns were carried out in two different seasons of the year (rainy and dry). Twelve stations, in four different areas, with different oceanographic characteristics, where chosen. To assess the bioavailability of the metals a selective extraction procedure was used to study the geochemical fractionation and bioavailability of Zn, Cu, Cr, Ni and Pb. The rainy season was very important with respect to variation in the total concentrations of Cr, Ni and Pb and their fractionation within different “operational” phases present in Guanabara Bay sediments. The water-soluble phase showed little importance, with respect to metal adsorption and this would suggest very low mobility of metals in the water column. Nevertheless, the potentially available metals within these sediments showed a high probability for their release and therefore cause contamination of the water column, since different parts of the bay are constantly subjected to dredging projects promoted by the harbor authorities.","inCitations":["944c49555a8003240dedd0872e6a210db6552894","326daa86a993faa5f0304679b3b8fbf2293ffcef","529fb28bd458e20d6a57afb325eac606563f8ec8","b3151f132f9cd816e4d7a07f2c9653015b16c1e9","cf2a11ca3a80f367d90394c3927139bbf7fcc2b8","83511d85a9450f8f633b03ea356e62f2583048f9","2992806a5f6f506fd837c8141aa628357ecb5f4f","2d3cbec9cabb798c2fcc2cd551fb9c452d56dbfb","b44109c5a46ea2bcd9a7dcecee2b40fb7d7fb2be","78981a96158612ff9c1b5e3fcf6277b60bd94852","83a9d0c1ffa780fba1f495bacda1608769e2874a","2ed2039c1720b564cef04ba298119433d7d49c30","8a027de24057f61a48776c80a8ce216091e79bb7"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Stormwater impact in Guanabara Bay (Rio de Janeiro): Evidences of seasonal variability in the dynamic of the sediment heavy metals","doi":"10.1016/j.ecss.2013.04.022","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecss.2013.04.022","venue":""}

Particular emphasis is placed upon energy extraction with single pulse propagation. INTRODUCTION The first erbium doped fiber amplifier (EDFA) was reported in January 1987 [1-2] and since then therehave been demonstrations of various host—gla.ss/dopant combinations which provide gain in wavelengthranges useful for telecommunications. In light of this, the modeling of fiber amplifiers has become criticalfor design optimization. Although simple analytical models are of some use, computer modeling is generallyneeded to obtain good agreement with experimental results over a wide range ofpractical situations. Becauseof this, steady state modeling of fiber amplifiers has been extensively covered [see ref. 3-7 to name just afew]. This paper will focus on the temporal modeling of fiber amplifiers which has not received any wherenear as much attention.

The objectives of this study was to prepare a generic level systematic inventory of egg parasitoids, and compare the species diversity and richness between organic and conventional paddy ecosystems, which are two differently managed agroecosystems. The study also aimed to examine whether the differences in the management practices have any vital effect on the diversity of the functional groups, the hymenopteran egg parasitoids in particular, when the major physical parameters like soil, temperature and rainfall, remained constant. Altogether 40 species of egg parasitoids in 23 genera belonging to 5 families (Platygastridae, Mymaridae, Encyrtidae, Eulophidae and Trichogrammatidae) were identified in both paddy ecosystems. Out of the 40 species, 29 belong to 16 genera of family Platygastridae. The number of species found in organic and conventional ecosystems was 32 and 22, respectively. Simpson’s diversity index was also higher (0.978) in organic ecosystem compared to conventional paddy ecosystem (0.878).The functional group analysis of hymenopteran egg parasitoids reflected a uniform pattern of higher functional redundancy in all the functional groups in the organic ecosystem than in the conventional ecosystem. However, egg parasitoid communities present in both ecosystems share less taxonomic similarities.

Some rainfall-runoff models have many model parameters which cause more difficulties and require longer time in the calibration processes. This paper illustrates the application of a proposed hybrid technique between Design of Experiments (DOE) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) for calibrating the parameters of rainfall-runoff models. The DOE is used to select the appropriate sample experiments based on the range of model parameters, and the ANN is used to optimize the value of model parameters. A Mock rainfall-runoff model was used to illustrate the application of the proposed technique. As the model has six model parameters, the model calibration requires 32 runs in the linear full factorial design experiments or 77 runs in the curvature full factorial design experiments. The error back-propagation technique (BP) was utilized in this approach to synthesize the suitable networks for reflecting the relationships between goodness-of-fit criterion, the sum of absolute errors as the inputs and model-parameters as the outputs. Standard statistical techniques of goodness of fit, such as the Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency, NSE and the sum of absolute error, |E| were used to measure the differences between simulated and observed runoffs. Observed runoff and climatic data, including rainfall from 1990 to 2010 for the Babak River Basin in Lombok, Indonesia were used in the calibration process; while, data from 2011 to 2016 were used for verification of the model. The results indicate the proposed technique gave more accurate calibrated parameters than the trial-and-error method. In addition, the proposed method requires less time for model calibration. The application of the proposed technique is not limited for calibrating rainfall-runoff models; however, it can be used to calibrate any kind of mathematical models.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Hybrid Technique between Design of Experiments and Artificial Neural Networks for Rainfall-runoff Model Calibration Method","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

The lower hemiabdomen was irradiated with 2 Gy per fraction to a total dose of 40 Gy. A 2-6 hour delay was used between the irradiation of each half of the abdomen to avoid excessive acute gastrointestinal toxicity. The upper hemiabdomen was irradiated with 1.5 Gy per fraction to a total dose of 30 Gy. The acute toxicity was acceptable, with 53 of 58 patients able to complete the prescribed course of treatment. Three patients (5%) experienced grade 3 or greater acute gastrointestinal toxicity. Fourteen of 60 patients (24%) required treatment breaks because of thrombocytopenia. Nadir platelet counts were lower in patients who had received previous chemotherapy than in previously untreated patients (80,000 vs 118,000; p = .02). However, only 4 out of 60 patients were unable to complete DSA because of prolonged thrombocytopenia. In addition to DSA, patients were also treated with intraperitoneal 32P (52 patients), intraperitoneal human ovarian antitumor serum (14 patients), and prior (14 patients) or subsequent (32 patients) chemotherapy. Granulocytopenia was more severe among patients who had received prior chemotherapy (mean nadir 900 vs 2200). Seven patients (11.5%) developed delayed bowel obstruction in the absence of recurrence. There was one death caused by hepatitis, presumably related to colloidal 32P and DSA. Twenty-five percent of Stage III optimally cytoreduced patients were disease-free at 5 years; these patients had a median survival of 45 months. DSA irradiation is an acceptable technique for delivering a high fractional dose of radiation to the entire peritoneal cavity. Shielding of the iliac crests spares bone marrow allowing DSA irradiation to be integrated into an aggressive combined modality treatment plan.","inCitations":["48085e49ea96568da58b83d10fa0c3d1e46bed51","ca15477d374c2d5e81d8c9634350558cd18d6d0d"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Delayed split whole abdominal irradiation in the combined modality treatment of ovarian cancer.","doi":"10.1016/0360-3016(91)90006-P","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/0360-3016%2891%2990006-P","venue":"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics"}

The isolated compounds showed stoichiometries organotin(IV)/fusidate 1/1, R 3 Sn(IV) FA (R = Me, FA1 ; Bu, FA2 ; Ph, FA3 ). The ligand coordination sites were determined by FTIR spectroscopic measurements. In the complexes, the carboxylate group of the fusidate ligand behaves as monodentate monoanionic donor, binding the Sn(IV) through one oxygen atom. On the basis of C–Sn–O COO angles, calculated through the rationalization of the 119 Sn Mossbauer parameter nuclear quadrupole splitting, it has been confirmed that, in all the solid state complexes, the Sn(IV) was tetracoordinated in a distorted tetrahedral structure. Further data from 119 Sn CP-MAS spectra confirmed the distorted tetrahedral arrangement. In MeOH solution, 1 H, 13 C and 119 Sn NMR spectroscopy showed monomeric complexes, where the carboxylate group mainly acts as monodentate ester-type ligand, and the occurrence of a coordinated solvent molecule to the tin center, as validated by non-relativistic NMR DFT study.","inCitations":["b53247e082ad7aef3acba6cd0c1bd48f2534d89a"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Structural characterization of triorganotin(IV) complexes with sodium fusidate and DFT calculations","doi":"10.1016/j.jorganchem.2010.02.001","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jorganchem.2010.02.001","venue":""}

To investigate the signaling pathways in TNF-α production in cervical mucosal epithelium after T. vaginalis infection, the phosphorylation of PI3K/AKT and MAPK pathways were evaluated in T. vaginalis-infected SiHa cells in the presence and absence of specific inhibitors. T. vaginalis increased TNF-α production in SiHa cells, in a parasite burden-dependent and incubation time-dependent manner. In T. vaginalis-infected SiHa cells, AKT, ERK1/2, p38 MAPK, and JNK were phosphorylated from 1 hr after infection; however, the phosphorylation patterns were different from each other. After pretreatment with inhibitors of the PI3K/AKT and MAPK pathways, TNF-α production was significantly decreased compared to the control; however, TNF-α reduction patterns were different depending on the type of PI3K/MAPK inhibitors. TNF-α production was reduced in a dose-dependent manner by treatment with wortmannin and PD98059, whereas it was increased by SP600125. These data suggested that PI3K/AKT and MAPK signaling pathways are important in regulation of TNF-α production in cervical mucosal epithelial SiHa cells. However, activation patterns of each pathway were different from the types of PI3K/MAPK pathways.","inCitations":["8e63fbf2a0ddb1b1630cf2e6acd713c561856766","8940cbeb9d1405db42411ce605ee32a868f42201","e5f2c781dfdb364aaba3ebaa121eb93f647bdc07","15f6c931b6d2865e8d01f4482324f6d868d40730"],"pdfUrls":["http://parasitol.kr/upload/pdf/kjp-53-4-371.pdf","http://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/pmc/7b/ef/kjp-53-4-371.PMC4566516.pdf"],"title":"Involvement of PI3K/AKT and MAPK Pathways for TNF-α Production in SiHa Cervical Mucosal Epithelial Cells Infected with Trichomonas vaginalis","doi":"10.3347/kjp.2015.53.4.371","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.3347/kjp.2015.53.4.371","venue":"The Korean journal of parasitology"}

This is a result of the assessment process, the demographic changes, modified access to facilities and the changing socioeconomic resources of informal caregivers. The fusion of the health care and long-term care insurance system is now being proposed by bipartisan commitees. This will lead to major changes as well as the immediate announced changes of the long-term care insurance.
