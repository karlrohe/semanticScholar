Dose-volume histograms (DVHs) were compared in order to study dose-volume relations for three techniques: 4FLD, an axial coplanar, four-field box technique; 6FLD, a six-field coplanar technique; and 4NAX, a coplanar but non-axial, four-field technique. All three techniques delivered equal doses to the planning target volumes (PTV). Our statistical analyses strongly indicate that the three techniques can be ranked as 6FLD better than 4FLD (and 4FLD better than 4NAX) as far as irradiating PNS volume during treatment of prostate cancer (PC) is concerned. For each technique, there is a \"spread\" owing to differences in patient anatomy and/or target size, position, and extent, but each technique has a similar \"profile\" or \"shape\" distinct from other techniques. Whether irradiating smaller volumes of PNS will influence the sexual potency outcome remains to be demonstrated. However, PNS should be considered as another critical structure in addition to rectum, bladder and femoral heads in the radiotherapy (RT) of PC, especially in 3DCRT dose escalation studies. Sexual potency outcomes can be correlated to dose-volume relations in the future and this will help refine radiotherapy techniques further.","inCitations":["dfe5b98d3981ee37deaee2d50132dd3c5d4c874a","6bb6e3078b4327a106a0fabc9054212227df6837","c1919a62d1f97474c5f556d6115d15f6c831eaac"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"In the radiotherapy of prostate cancer, technique determines the doses to the penile structures.","doi":"10.1259/bjr.72.861.10645194","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1259/bjr.72.861.10645194","venue":"The British journal of radiology"}

Unfortunately at times this organizational scheme proves awkward and oversimplifies important matters. For example, he places his discussions of sedimentation rate in chapters entitled \"Chest Pain\" and \"Arthritis and Arthralgia,\" but does not mention sedimentation rate when discussing the surgical abdomen, unexplained fever, infections, or myeloma. Also, in his fleeting go at gout, he does not say that gout comprises only one of many conditions causing hyperuricemia.

Recently, artificial intelligence (AI)-aided OFDM receivers have been brought to the forefront to break the bottleneck of the traditional OFDM systems. In this paper, we investigate two AI-aided OFDM receivers, data-driven fully connected-deep neural network (FC-DNN) receiver and model-driven ComNet receiver, respectively. We first study their performance under different channel models through simulation and then establish a real-time video transmission system using a 5G rapid prototyping (RaPro) system for over-the-air (OTA) test. To address the performance gap between the simulation and the OTA test caused by the discrepancy between the channel model for offline training and real environments, we develop a novel online training strategy, called SwitchNet receiver. The SwitchNet receiver is with a flexible and extendable architecture and can adapts to real channel by training one parameter online. The OTA test verifies its feasibility and robustness to real environments and indicates its potential for future communications systems. At the end of this paper, we discuss some challenges to inspire future research.","inCitations":["0954853e42136298a6665888f582110bda762b96","76856b5630b8cb0e919637680c9205eced4f1266","cf958f6b406035f1d24859c2be49c657fb4156bf","7716cc74ce261006d3b6cc4c41955f3a6333d90e","2b0be3a256fc9147beb63c87baa9d790b53d4753","ea323ce6532ae36aab437ea4bd5947519f202a7b","fb0c1ea34fb5a006d8374f1188461bd637dc407f"],"pdfUrls":["https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.06638v2.pdf","http://arxiv.org/abs/1812.06638"],"title":"Artificial Intelligence-aided OFDM Receiver: Design and Experimental Results","doi":"","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"ArXiv"}

Methods Analyses were performed on patient‐level data from individuals self‐defined as African‐American or non‐African‐American in seven phase III studies. Endpoints included change in HbA1c level, fasting plasma glucose level and body weight from baseline, proportion of patients reaching HbA1c target [< 53 mmol/mol (< 7.0%)], and incidence of hypoglycaemia and nausea. Analyses used data obtained after 26 weeks. Within‐population comparisons of liraglutide were performed vs placebo for African‐American and non‐African‐American patient groups. In addition, between‐population comparisons with non‐African‐American patients were performed for each treatment. Results In African‐American patients (n = 225), HbA1c was significantly reduced at 26 weeks with liraglutide 1.2 and 1.8 mg (−11 and −14 mmol/mol, respectively compared with placebo; P < 0.0001). There were also significant reductions in fasting plasma glucose (−2.4 and −3.1 mmol/l, respectively, compared with placebo; P < 0.0001). Statistically significant reductions in body weight were observed with 1.8 mg liraglutide (−2.1 kg compared with placebo; P = 0.0056), but not with 1.2 mg liraglutide (−0.26 kg; P = 0.7307). The P value for interaction between treatment and race was significant for body weight (P = 0.0355). The incidence of non‐severe hypoglycaemia with liraglutide was low (11–15% of patients), and < 25% of patients receiving liraglutide experienced nausea. Conclusions This meta‐analysis suggests that liraglutide is well tolerated and efficacious for treatment of Type 2 diabetes in African‐American patients, with an efficacy that was shown not to differ from that observed in non‐African‐American patients over 26 weeks. What's new?This study is the first of its kind to assess specifically the efficacy and tolerability of a glucagon‐like peptide‐1 (GLP‐1) receptor agonist in African‐American populations.We showed that the GLP‐1 receptor agonist liraglutide was efficacious in the treatment of African‐American people with Type 2 diabetes, and had broadly similar efficacy to that seen in non‐African‐American people.","inCitations":["f2dc865f719a04e9330b567039952822d6ef4c65"],"pdfUrls":["https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/pmc/oa_pdf/81/2c/DME-34-197.PMC5248619.pdf"],"title":"Efficacy and safety of liraglutide, a once‐daily human glucagon‐like peptide‐1 receptor agonist, in African‐American people with Type 2 diabetes: a meta‐analysis of sub‐population data from seven phase III trials","doi":"10.1111/dme.13185","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1111/dme.13185","venue":"Diabetic medicine : a journal of the British Diabetic Association"}

However, it is often that the BAS has no information of the chilled and condenser water flow rates that pass through the evaporator and condenser, respectively, of a chiller. \nThis thesis proposes a virtual flow meter (VFM) to estimate the chilled and condenser water mass flow rates. The virtual flow meter uses a thermodynamic analysis of a chiller under six different scenarios of available sensors from a BAS with some manufacturer data to fill the gaps left by the missing sensors. \nThis thesis presents the use of the VFM in three case studies to estimate the chilled and condenser water mass flow rates. The evaluation of the accuracy of the VFM model is performed using an uncertainty analysis, statistical indices (CV-RMSE, NMBE) and a paired difference statistical hypothesis test to provide insight into the limits of CV-RMSE and NMBE that determine an acceptable model. Then, the estimates from the VFM are used to estimate the virtual coefficient of performance of the chiller and the cooling plant for use with developed ongoing commissioning methods of cooling plants. \nThis thesis presents the development of a graphical user interface for the VFM model and the sensitivity of the virtual flow meter to it inputs is discussed to aid the user in achieving accurate results.","inCitations":["5f0ea5133f4bb603e69be1e8f3a91bcf63322ea9"],"pdfUrls":["https://spectrum.library.concordia.ca/979567/1/McDonald_MASc_S2015.pdf"],"title":"Development and Testing of a Virtual Flow Meter for Use in Ongoing Commissioning of Commercial and Institutional Buildings","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

In addition IF -WS2 pellets were annealed at elevated temperatures under vacuum in a specially designed system. Arrhenius plots for the conductivities of the WS2 samples (2H, IF and IF +annealing) exhibit marked uprise of ∂ ln (sT–1)/∂T–1 with temperature. The resistivity of the non-annealed IF -WS2 pellets is higher by 2–8 orders of magnitude than that of 2H-WS2 pellets, whereas the resistivity of the annealed IF pellets is higher than that of the non-annealed ones. Hall Effect measurements at 300 K show p-type conductivity and similar carrier concentration for both types of materials. The carrier mobility of 2H-WS2 platelets is found to be in the range of the reported values. However, IF -WS2 pellets have shown an unusually low mobility for a semiconducting material. The experimental data was found to be in a good agreement with a model used for analyzing the conductivity of polycrystalline semiconductors, which takes into consideration fluctuations of the barrier heights among the different nanoparticles as well as within a single nanoparticle boundary.

Severe thunderstorms can develop very quickly and can produce high winds, hail, and flash flooding, which are potentially lifethreatening and can cause substantial property damage in a short time. According to the U.S. Natural Hazard Statistics over 30 year average (1977-2006), “Flash floods/floods are the #1 cause of deaths associated with thunderstorms.” (Sky warn review by Phil Hysell). Also, NOAA’s annual compilations of flood loss statistics show that the damage scale of the flood tends to increase with time, possibly mostly due to urban spread. Fast and accurate nowcasting and short-term forecasting systems, including the prediction of timing, location, and intensity of the severe storm, are becoming more and more important in this regard. Mesoscale models together with advanced methods to incorporate radar and other real-time observations have become one increasingly popular research venue in this area. Only radars allow for observing convective scale thunderstorms at high temporal and spatial resolution (Sun 2005). The rapid evolution of mesoscale systems as well as the non-linear relation between radar reflectivity and precipitation intensity makes the assimilation of radar data into models a challenging problem, both mathematically and physically. Specifically, problems include the nonlinearity of the observation operator (Evensen 2003), non-Gaussian background errors (Harlim and Hunt 2007), filter divergence (Houtekamer and Mitchell 1998), as well as the flow-dependence of the background-error covariances (Houtekamer and Mitchell 1998; Houtekamer and Mitchell 2001; Houtekamer, Mitchell et al. 2005).","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://ams.confex.com/ams/pdfpapers/155719.pdf"],"title":"Assimilation of radar observations in mesoscale models using approximate background error covariance matrices","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

We report the first definitive evidence that viruses can persist in the thyroid gland, particularly thyroid epithelial cells in which thyroglobulin is synthesized. Concomitant with the infection of these cells was a significant reduction in the level of thyroglobulin mRNA and circulating thyroid hormones. Another virus that causes persistent infection but does not replicate in the thyroid gland failed to alter serum levels of thyroid hormones, indicating the thyroid dysfunction was not a generalized result of stress accompanying a persistent infection. This alteration in thyroid homeostasis during persistent infection with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus is not caused by autoantibodies to the thyroid. Moreover, despite infection of the thyroid gland, neither necrosis nor inflammation occurs. Thyroid dysfunction was noted both when persistence was initiated at birth and in utero during congenital infection. These observations in an experimental model raise the issue that viruses may play a role in the pathogenesis of some thyroid disorders in man.","inCitations":["a8a79773dfa275b68ac438bab3c6065ee7b0955c","04ef231d3c731635ec778a51b7155ed01c62585d","b784f79d60628a3bba4d65ee3d9e202353135c13","de278866ad6a12cf73cdd7c4328e3d341607cc88","865375360cf2f4a341a106181d0eac8d40ff4747","cadb112ff208f4af9d92d6979bd0b6b9f616a2b6","0596a285261bc529af5a4bea0447bc838f45866f","ebff8d2c98db83de6bfdc51c5a1f096c1f22984f","4c1d24dc2c22606b0b1f8a75f315f65585d6dbcd"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Persistent viral infection of the thyroid gland: alteration of thyroid function in the absence of tissue injury.","doi":"10.1210/endo-122-2-567","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1210/endo-122-2-567","venue":"Endocrinology"}

De un lado, porque se trata del primer codigo de un pais latinoamericano que aborda, de manera organica, integral y sistematica, el conjunto de los procesos constitucionales y los principios procesales que los sustentan. De otro, porque la norma recoge importantes avances e innovaciones, provenientes de los aportes de la doctrina y jurisprudencia de la materia, a la par de corregir vacios y deficiencias observados en el funcionamiento y tratamiento judicial de la legislacion precedente. Debe recordarse que la norma pionera fundamental este campo, la Ley n° 23.506 de Habeas Corpus y Amparo, data de fines de 1982, y ha sufrido modificaciones parciales que, en la mayoria de casos, se dictaron para restringir sus alcances y eficacia. La forma de elaboracion y aprobacion de este Codigo Procesal Constitucional ha sido tambien peculiar y novedosa, pues el anteproyecto no surgio de una comision oficial, creada o convocada por los poderes Legislativo o Ejecutivo, sino de la iniciativa espontanea de un grupo de profesores de la Facultad de Derecho de la Pontificia Universidad Catolica del Peru, vinculados a esta materia en lo academico y profesional. En efecto, a lo largo de ocho anos Domingo Garcia Belaunde, Juan Monroy Galvez, Arsenio Ore Guardia, Jorge Danos Ordonez, Samuel Abad Yupanqui y Francisco Eguiguren Praeli se reunieron periodicamente para preparar el texto de un anteproyecto que fue varias veces objeto de revision y mejoramiento.","inCitations":["26eaa6df3aff7b65f2a1b468080875a24e01f52d"],"pdfUrls":["http://revistas.pucp.edu.pe/index.php/derechopucp/article/download/10331/10780","https://revistas-colaboracion.juridicas.unam.mx/index.php/anuario-derecho-constitucional/article/download/30259/27314"],"title":"El nuevo código procesal constitucional peruano","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

The associations between nursing workload, quality of care, and patient safety are not well understood.\n\n\nOBJECTIVES\nThe concept of workload and its associated measures do not capture all nursing work activities, and tools used to assess healthy work environments do not identify these activities. The variable turbulence was created to capture nursing activities not represented by workload. The purpose of this research was to specify a definition and preliminary measure for turbulence.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA 2-phase exploratory sequential mixed-methods design was used to translate the proposed construct of turbulence into an operational definition and begin preliminary testing of a turbulence scale.\n\n\nRESULTS\nA member survey of the American Association of Critical-Care Nurses resulted in the identification of 12 turbulence types. Turbulence was defined, and reliability of the turbulence scale was acceptable (α = .75). Turbulence was most strongly correlated with patient safety risk (r = 0.41, n = 293, P < .001). Workload had the weakest association with patient safety risk (r = 0.16, n = 294, P = .005).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAcknowledging the concepts of turbulence and workload separately best describes the full range of nursing demands. Improved measurement of nursing work is important to advance the science.

To understand the water quality status and its change processes, we have monitored the lake water recently. The analyses results of the monitoring data show that the mixedness of lake water, which is affected by the strong wind and waves in the Lake Erhai, is the highest in the south of lake where with a shallow water depth, and is the lowest in central part of lake, while it shows a moderate situation in the north of the lake. As one of the typical plateau-type shallow lakes, there is no temperature stratification observed in Lake Erhai, but a weak mixing phenomenon between thermocline and epilimnion exist in the central and north part of the lake in July. The seasonal water temperature changes affect the distribution and content of chlorophyll-a, which is also affected by human activity induced nutrient inputs, especially in the shallow area in south of the Lake Erhai, where is more sensitive to natural factors, such as wind velocity, direction and lake current. The dissolved oxygen (DO) content is not only influenced by the algae in lake water, but also the discharge of rivers into the lake. Our monitoring data reveal a seasonal variation of the DO contents, and show a highest value in January high and a lowest value in July. At the same time, the pH value shows a distinguishable seasonal variation with a lowest value in January. As pH is very sensitive to the photosynthesis and respiration of aquatic animals and plants in the lake water, it varies from one area to another abruptly in July. It has been noticed that a strong correlation exist between the chlorophyll-a content, DO and pH values in October. The seasonal change of turbidity is sensitive to water depth and zooplankton and phytoplankton amounts. The total contents of both Nitrogen (TN) and Phosphorous (TP) reveal that Lake Erhai is approaching to the middle to middle-high eutrophication situation, and strong measurements to prevent the lake from further eutrophication is necessary.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"2015~2016年洱海水质参数季节性变化 The Seasonal Variations of the Water Quality of Erhai during 2015-2016","doi":"10.12677/AEP.2017.74042","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.12677/AEP.2017.74042","venue":""}

The intensity of fast component of light emission obeys sub-linear dose rate dependence. The intensity of light emission and the TOL depend on the intensity of probing light. Lower intensity of the light emission is observed for higher intensity of probing light. The light emission quenching occurs for wavelengths shorter or longer than the wavelength of probing light. Probing with light enhances the TOL and shortens the decay time of TOL. A 'two-photon-flows' model has been introduced to analyze correlation between the effect of light emission quenching and the TOL enhanced by probing light.

The pathogenesis of IBS appears to be multifactorial, which involves altered gastrointestinal motor function, enhanced perception of visceral stimuli, and psychosocial factors. A role of enteric mucosal immune activation has been recently suggested.3,4 Endotoxin, a component from the outer membrane of gram negative bacteria, stimulates various inflammatory mediators, such as cytokines (e.g., tumor necrosis factor) and acute phase reactants (e.g., CRP). Inflammation leads to elevated blood endotoxin levels as a result of increased intestinal permeability due to intestinal mucosal damage.5 Patients with IBS have elevated endotoxin levels, which proves that IBS is associated with microscopic inflammation of the enteric mucosa.6 Colostrum, which is produced by female mammals immediately after giving birth, is a nutrient-rich fluid that contains immune, growth, and tissue repair factors.7 Colostrum contains a significant amount of complement components that act as natural anti-microbial agents to actively stimulate the maturation of an infant's immune system. Bovine colostrum, a raw material for immune milk preparations, can be used to treat or prevent infections of the gastrointestinal tract.8-10 The objectives of this study were to analyze whether the administration of bovine colostrum could relieve all symptoms of IBS (using several scoring systems to monitor IBS), and could lead to a decrease in endotoxin levels in patients with IBS (by measuring the endotoxin level before and after administration). \n \nThis study was a prospective, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial to analyze the efficacy of bovine colostrum. Patients with IBS (aged, 18-80 years) were voluntarily recruited. They were selected according to the ROME III criteria, which was the occurrence of recurrent abdominal pain or discomfort for at least 3 days per month in the last 3 months associated with 2 or more of the following: (1) relieved with defecation; (2) onset associated with a change in frequency of stool; (3) onset associated with a change in form or appearance of stool.11 Patients were randomly classified to either the colostrum or placebo group. A sample of bovine colostrum (15 mL; MuKoBa™, Seoul, Korea) was orally administered once daily before breakfast. All the physical characteristics of bovine colostrum (e.g., smell, color, taste, volume, and packaging) were indistinguishable from the placebo (artificial milk). \n \nThe 8-week study included a 4-week treatment period and a 4-week follow-up observation period without treatment. Clinic visits were conducted at weeks 0, 4, and 8, while phone interviews were performed weekly. Three scoring systems of IBS were used for the evaluation of symptom relief to measure the primary efficacy of colostrum. The first scoring index was assessed by using the IBS Global Improvement Scale (GIS) with the patients' rating their overall satisfaction with their IBS treatment on a 7-point Likert scale, ranging from \"very unsatisfied\" to \"very satisfied\".12 Data were collected weekly by using an interactive voice-response telephone-based system. The second scoring index used was the Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS-IBS), which was a short and user-friendly instrument with excellent psychometric properties.13 This questionnaire included the rating of 13 problems such as satiety, abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipation, and bloating on a 7-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (good status) to 7 (bad status). Data were collected every 2 weeks. The third scoring index was the assessment of the quality of life (QOL), by using the IBS-QOL questionnaire, which comprised 34 questions relating to the symptoms of IBS before treatment (week 0), at the end of colostrum administration (week 4), and at the end of the study (week 8).14 The third scoring index is the most extensively validated of all QOL measures, which has accurate psychometric and methodological qualities.15,16 Endotoxin levels obtained through blood sampling at weeks 0, 4, and 8 were used as a secondary outcome variable. \n \nA total of 18 patients with IBS were randomly classified into the colostrum group (n=9) and placebo group (n=9). Primary analysis by using the IBS-GIS revealed a slightly higher rate of symptom relief in the colostrum group (55.5%) than the placebo group (44.4%) at 4 weeks, but this difference was not significant. The mean symptom score obtained using the GSRS-IBS analysis decreased by 1.3 points (from 4.1 to 2.8) in the colostrum group and 1.0 point (from 3.6 to 2.6) in the placebo group at 4 weeks, and decreased by 1.7 points (from 4.1 to 2.4) in the colostrum group and 1.1 points (from 3.6 to 2.5) in the placebo group at 8 weeks (Fig. 1A). The interval change of this score was not statistically different between the 2 groups at both 4 and 8 weeks. The IBS-QOL analysis, which was converted to a 0-100 scale ranging from 0 (poor quality of life) to 100 (maximum quality of life), revealed that both the groups rather made a little change for the worse. The IBS-QOL score of the colostrum group diminished by 8.8 points at 4 weeks and 9.1 points at 8 weeks, and that of the control group diminished by 4.7 points at 4 weeks and 6.3 points at 8 weeks (Fig. 1B). The overall IBS-QOL score was not statistically different between the 2 groups. \n \n \n \nFig. 1 \n \nComparison of patients in the colostrum and placebo groups using (A) GSRS-IBS and (B) IBS-QOL. GSRS-IBS, gastrointestinal symptom rating scale-irritable bowel syndrome; IBS-QOL, irritable bowel syndrome-quality of life. \n \n \n \nAfter 4 weeks (i.e. immediately after treatment), the endotoxin levels of patients in the colostrum group showed a decrease in 44.4% (4/9) patients, no interval change in 11.1% (1/9) patients, and an increase in 44.4% (4/9) patients. The endotoxin levels of patients in the placebo group did not show any decrease; however, no interval change in the endotoxin levels was observed in 33.3% (3/9) patients, and an increase in 66.6% (6/9) patients. After 8 weeks (i.e. after observation period), the endotoxin levels of patients in the colostrum group showed a decrease in 33.3% (3/9) patients, no interval change in 44.4% (4/9) patients, and an increase in 22.2% (2/9) patients. The endotoxin levels of patients in the placebo group showed a decrease in 11.1% (1/9) patients, no interval change in 33.3% (3/9) patients, and an increase in 55.5% (5/9) patients. Although patients in the colostrum group appeared to have a greater improvement in the endotoxin levels as evaluated using categorical analysis, there was no significant difference in the interval change of the calculated endotoxin value between the 2 groups using a repeated analysis of variance test (Fig. 2). \n \n \n \nFig. 2 \n \nComparison of the changes in the endotoxin level between patients in the colostrum and placebo groups. \n \n \n \nA limitation of this study was the small sample size. \n \nIn conclusion, this study showed that colostrum had no benefits in relieving symptoms and improving mucosal immunity of patients with IBS. The response rate of patients in the placebo group is crucial in therapeutic trials conducted to evaluate IBS. The placebo response rates have ranged from 16.0-71.4% with a population-weighted average of 40.2% in randomized placebo-controlled trials of patients with IBS.17 This high placebo response rate could also confirm the lack of any significant benefits of colostrum in patients with IBS.18 Therefore, further large-scale studies to demonstrate the usefulness of colostrum are required.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/pmc/bf/eb/ir-12-80.PMC4204680.pdf","https://www.e-sciencecentral.org/upload/ir/pdf/ir-12-80.pdf"],"title":"Effect of Colostrum on the Symptoms and Mucosal Permeability in Patients with Irritable Bowel Syndrome: A Randomized Placebo-controlled Study","doi":"10.5217/ir.2014.12.1.80","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.5217/ir.2014.12.1.80","venue":"Intestinal research"}

This paper proposes a phenotypic integrated machine learning framework to investigate functional connectivity alterations between ADHD and control subjects not diagnosed with ADHD, employing fMRI data. Our aim is to apply computational techniques to (1) automatically classify a person’s fMRI signal as ADHD or control, (2) identify differences in functional connectivity of these two groups and (3) evaluate the importance of phenotypic information for classification. In the first stage of our framework, we determine the functional connectivity of brain regions by grouping brain activity using clustering algorithms. Next, we employ Elastic Net based feature selection to select the most discriminant features from the dense functional brain network and integrate phenotypic information. Finally, a support vector machine classifier is trained to classify ADHD subjects vs. control. The proposed framework was evaluated on a public dataset ADHD-200, and our classification results outperform the state-of-the-art on some subsets of the data.","inCitations":["bff13bf9d607797bfd075a822dafe366f9dece11","51f875e12c9950a080c7fefa7372de54304d038c","ab6e9a06fb821743d7f388759111a36c35bd516e","fb366558faf434c3c1b4678878aca64b2bf57c98","01fde59fcee040f83405f5b23f505fc661d93aa2","2a09caf8560bb973098e1dbbda18383f769cbeba"],"pdfUrls":["http://openaccess.city.ac.uk/14265/1/CCIARFinal.pdf","http://www.staff.city.ac.uk/~sbbh653/publications/ADHD_ICIAR2016.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-41501-7_25"],"title":"Phenotypic Integrated Framework for Classification of ADHD Using fMRI","doi":"10.1007/978-3-319-41501-7_25","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-41501-7_25","venue":"ICIAR"}

Mycological media differ from bacteriological media in a number of ways because of the differing requirements for growth. Almost all molds, particularly the saprophytes, are obligate aerobes. Out of the many media used for the culture of molds and yeasts, the following are the more useful: (1) Malt extract agar, (2) Czapek-Dox agar and Potato dextrose, (3) Davis's yeast salt agar, and (4) Rose Bengal agar. Yeasts may reproduce by budding, binary fission, ascospores, or, less commonly, by other methods. Identification is more difficult than the identification of multicellular molds partly because of the reluctance of yeasts to produce ascospores on ordinary media. Sporogenous yeasts can be induced to form ascospores by subculturing twice on a nutrient agar containing 5 percent glucose and 0–5 percent tartaric acid, followed by subculture on to an agar medium containing 0.04 percent glucose and 0.14 percent anhydrous sodium acetate only.","inCitations":["b6047a3afebb18b866e2e09ea64e9a432cf17ae8"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Moulds and Yeasts","doi":"10.1016/B978-1-4832-3205-8.50023-4","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-1-4832-3205-8.50023-4","venue":""}

The crystallization time is shortened by the addition of Ti-MWW seeds and raising the stirring rate. Ultraviolet-visible spectra show that the precursor contains tetrahedral and octahedral Ti species. Calcination of the precursor results in a partial condensation of the octahedral Ti to form the anatase phase. The octahedral Ti species belong to a kind of extra-framework Ti, which can be removed easily by the acid treatment in a short time. The calcined Ti-MWW contains anatase when the acid treatment time is too long. The characteristic infrared band at 960 cm −1 is not observed for the Ti-MWW precursor, but it appears in the samples treated with acid. Epoxidation of allyl alcohol with H 2 O 2 on Ti-MWW was studied. Ti-MWW with Si/Ti ratio of 20 and acid treatment for 12–16 h is more effective. The conversion of allyl alcohol is 88.7%, and the selectivity for glycidol is 99% under the reaction conditions of 333 K and 30 min, but the catalytic activity of Ti-MWW decreases when the acid treatment time is too long.","inCitations":["515bc737095ff179ed4fa57553876eaca7be2c97"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Epoxidation of Allyl Alcohol to Glycidol on Ti-MWW Molecular Sieves","doi":"10.1016/S1872-2067(06)60016-8","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/S1872-2067%2806%2960016-8","venue":""}

The purpose of this study is to assess the prevalence and socio-demographic covariates of low health literacy in Taiwanese adults and to investigate the relationships between health literacy and health status and health care utilization.MethodsA national survey of 1493 adults was conducted in 2008. Health literacy was measured using the Mandarin Health Literacy Scale. Health status was measured based on self-rated physical and mental health. Health care utilization was measured based on self-reported outpatient clinic visits, emergency room visits, and hospitalizations.ResultsApproximately thirty percent of adults were found to have low (inadequate or marginal) health literacy. They tended to be older, have fewer years of schooling, lower household income, and reside in less populated areas. Inadequate health literacy was associated with poorer mental health (OR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.35-0.91). No association was found between health literacy and health care utilization even after adjusting for other covariates.ConclusionsLow (inadequate and marginal) health literacy is prevalent in Taiwan. High prevalence of low health literacy is not necessarily indicative of the need for interventions.

This approach shows a lack of concern for tobacco consumers while allowing government to abdicate responsibility without jeopardising profit. The decision to warn people of inevitable addiction and disease (while protecting those who profit from such sales) fails to recognise previous research into adolescent attraction to deviance and the role of suggestion in cure and illness. The Australian government makes millions of dollars each year by taxing tobacco products--as long as these profits continue to be directed almost exclusively into consolidated revenue, smokers will remain victims of a system unconcerned with exploitation. © 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Successful anti-smoking strategies are evident in Australia. Tobacco smoking has become less socially acceptable and is now appraised more negatively than previously was the case [1]. Legislation relating to tobacco products in Australia has resulted in smoking bans on commercial aircraft, in Australian airports, and in government buildings. Advertising of tobacco products has also been banned in print and electronic media. Restaurants now either provide smoke-free areas, or have a smoke-free policy banning tobacco smoking. Many large shopping centres also ban the consumption of tobacco on their premises. These are important preventive measures, both in a legal and health *Correspondence to: Department of Psychology, James Cook University, Cairns Campus, P.O.

Prominent, explicit health warnings on tobacco products also may appear to be positive health strategies (see appendix A). It is dearly necessary that people fully understand the health consequences of smoking. This information should be provided and understood by the consumer. It should be recognised, however, that health messages high in fear and aimed at increasing a perception of personal vulnerability have a chequered history in adult intervention programmes [2]. For many youths, however, understanding the health consequences of smoking does even less to change the behaviour [3]. High fear messages aimed at decreasing smoking behaviour can potentially produce increases in smoking in adolescents attracted to deviance.

However, the morphological cellular interplay between the different cell types is less clear. To investigate lymphocyte/hepatic stellate cell (HSC) interactions, hepatic fibrosis was induced by administering carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) intraperitoneally (i.p.) for 4 weeks in C57Bl/6 mice. Animals were killed at 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4 weeks. Liver sections were stained for Sirius red. Confocal microscopy was used to evaluate alpha smooth-muscle actin (alphaSMA) and lymphocyte subsets in liver sections. At weeks 0 and 4, liver protein extracts were assessed for alphaSMA by Western blotting and isolated liver lymphocytes as well as HSC were analysed by fluorescence activated cell sorter (FACS). Similar to the results obtained from classical Sirius red staining and alphaSMA blotting, analysis of liver sections by confocal microscopy revealed a marked and continuous accumulation of alphaSMA staining along sequential experimental check-points after administering CCl4. Although the number of all liver lymphocyte subsets increased following fibrosis induction, FACS analysis revealed an increase in the distribution of liver CD8 subsets and a decrease of CD4 T cells. Confocal microscopy showed a significant early appearance of CD8 and NK cells, and to a lesser extent CD4 T cells, appearing only from week 2. Lymphocytes were seen in proximity only to HSC, mainly in the periportal area and along fibrotic septa, suggesting a direct interaction. Notably, lymphocyte subsets were undetectable in naive liver sections. Freshly isolated HCS show high expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II and CD11c. In the animal model of hepatic fibrosis, lymphocytes infiltrate into the liver parenchyma and it is thought that they attach directly to activated HSC. Because HSCs express CD11c/class II molecules, interactions involving them might reflect that HSCs have an antigen-presenting capacity.","inCitations":["a3ffac6999aa6c195c721f83afbfad656dc8eebd","74f05ffc28cf59705fa2b5805f784fc2b74e8940","3eb49c3332a4f47dcf13bbce08b0ed205cde7e88","1ed7d3b5888ad222dca69a4372f12a790ae88f0f","d8245b1a4a30b52c5cce81b28559b124e1d86680","702acb3be3c5930c83f61f69516580718bb10dec","9c8dc0d6a19f78b373b0606363cec8802f688951","94c2d4803a0ff1eba51b0f3cc9e91ed7fc184eb0","332e1c0db3ba3577e9707e93659e6ff15a8482dc","96adb533d5d498761a9adfdc3616b84b43b32f5d","3873da6cb2f1e41c212d6e752030dd29219f85f1","31e8ebfb599ce8e4c2434af9a20819e87adb4781","3c14d58df713bb3b8efab2ca8f8088855389617d","200856f5bbddc132da395d4c4f150b7bec0d62a7","dbb8498408e0d2e36d4600a160cd5b115b5254dd","947010452c349ba165e52ecf86037e523818eb5a","0ad4a2c5861dd442cc43ce280cbd6199353b3d38","6bbb53149570ec8bbddb0c101cbd6dd52943edd1","53e917d130f7055a8f0af711c193abb9da870d41","5da0c2146d29d3aa36282389c2b79a26067fe6d8","5d89df0c9b5e375e7e5ec18318ba505137dc34fc","bb134d5825ffc6331e2f8ec42ec1ba311628c4a6","f57e8eb5e3e0114204eafcd898b6bcbbe85d386c","733e0ac21ef2e8d73cc90c7cd3cc34c7fbd6eb4f","7136317a72557e7034873391e1e5ef2a0a200b91","3f2e186a235a0542b64d645c2a41559574794dcb","8d974e573ea5410e3a42c1b98c18737b874651f0","cabdc6d9dbf089bfc0282d021da90c30e5aafd05","86f254e82ee7007da0c6dd83af5277585ef4dceb","deeffaf560449410ebb09da460e678eb5e73c29a","b933f74ea198d56d8e210393bec994bad27c86ad","86868974a2abccec60341dcac9bebd2e76e4c988","9b3d851c000285ca94ab80c71ea03f03449ee7d2","3ae5fc27391dae775990f3db4c915acc3641d59a","1a931a3c4819f9a9199ac5dce6e028005860b30a","4dcd613dc38a96b7ed97d81da726126c127c0f15","711b9452696822873b30d346e6be1c8558707517","cd19b223c65d6e4cfed50fd51dc4a972dc157a0c","fc45ea326c4060f93700d5596de981ab0f5f4ac4","dd93544af7cd0cec8cab2496762cfc43f9ee3d0b","ced82efc27cfb8715095b0c19d20dcfd88f6080c","4691f037dec62d733f6903ffc92cb3ef6b42b027"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Lymphocyte-hepatic stellate cell proximity suggests a direct interaction.","doi":"10.1111/j.1365-2249.2007.03353.x","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2249.2007.03353.x","venue":"Clinical and experimental immunology"}

Recently, observed deviations away from this classical behavior for Permian Basin Wolfcamp shale (oil) wells have been attributed to reservoir heterogeneity and anomalous diffusion (AD). However, some wells in the basin also produce below bubble point pressure and exhibit characteristics of multi-phase flow. The objective of the current study is therefore to investigate if multi-phase flow may also be contributing to observed deviations from classic TLF behavior. The conventional log-log diagnostics used to identify flow regimes do not account for reservoir complexities such as multi-phase flow and reservoir heterogeneity. Failure to correct for these effects when they are occurring may result in misdiagnosis of flow regimes. A new workflow is therefore introduced herein to improve flow regime identification when reservoir complexities are exhibited, with a specific focus on multi-phase flow. The workflow involves the correction of log-log diagnostics for multi-phase flow through the use of modified pseudo-variables (pseudo-pressure and pseudo-time) once characteristics of multi-phase flow are identified (e.g. rapid increase of gas-oil ratio after bubble point pressure is reached). Although reservoir heterogeneity and AD are accepted causes of deviations from TLF, the impact of multi-phase flow has not been investigated in detail. Therefore, corrections to pseudo-variables for multi-phase flow, a known reservoir complexity exhibited by Wolfcamp shale wells, are presented. Pressure-dependent permeability is also accounted for in pseudo-variable calculations, although its impact is demonstrated to be relatively minor in this study. Application of the new workflow to a simulated case and a Wolfcamp shale field case demonstrates the following: 1) multi-phase flow, and in particular the appearance of a mobile gas phase after two-phase oil and water production, results in deviations from classical TLF behavior when data is analyzed using conventional (uncorrected) diagnostics; 2) application of the modified diagnostics to a simulated case that includes multi-phase flow results in the “true” flow regime signature of TLF being observed; 3) application of the modified diagnostics to a field case exhibiting evidence of multi-phase flow reduces the deviation from TLF. This study suggests that multi-phase flow may be impairing our ability to identify flow regimes using conventional flow regime identification methods.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Evaluation of the impact of multi-phase flow on reservoir signatures in the Wolfcamp shale","doi":"10.1016/j.jngse.2020.103187","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jngse.2020.103187","venue":""}

Human megakaryocytes, cultured from cord blood CD34(+) cells and grown in serum-free media containing thrombopoietin, were investigated to determine if they could be used as a model for studying normal alpha-granule protein processing and storage. ELISA indicated that cultured megakaryocytes contained the alpha-granule proteins multimerin, von Willebrand factor, thrombospondin-1, beta-thromboglobulin and platelet factor 4, but no detectable fibrinogen and factor V. A significant proportion of the alpha-granule protein in megakaryocyte cultures was contained within the cells (averages: 41-71 %), consistent with storage. Detailed analyses of multimerin and von Willebrand factor confirmed that alpha-granule proteins were processed to mature forms and were predominantly located in the alpha-granules of cultured megakaryocytes.Thrombopoietin-stimulated cultured megakaryocytes provide a useful model for studying alpha-granule protein processing and storage.","inCitations":["d1c91ad164673102cf780e0c8039fbf093fb90ce","d5b19ce1ce257ed4e86ebc9c82d4c290588165c3","bd0b41f0e7edbe4b4c0e4a7c83a15061ed4fa2fd","553152f02884237f24914d97c7f9b53325b81ac1","c39eb7c37b4727b2ebf5968a0139228ebaec5aab"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Studies of alpha-granule proteins in cultured human megakaryocytes.","doi":"","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"Thrombosis and haemostasis"}
