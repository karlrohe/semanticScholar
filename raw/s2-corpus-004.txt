The outcome of this research will be beneficial for the runway pavement designer to introduce and design such impact and moving load resistant multi-layer composite and concrete runway pavement and thereby to reduce the damage of runway pavement due to the hard landing of exceptionally large and heavy weighted aircrafts, high velocity and heavy weighted falling objects during accidents, terrorist attacks etc.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Performance of protective composite runway pavement under moving and impact loads","doi":"10.5204/thesis.eprints.116521","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.5204/thesis.eprints.116521","venue":""}

shelf that today is covered by the ocean. However, its extent on the shelf is still not resolved. The bathymetry of the shelf reveals morphologic remnants that have been created by this extensive ice sheet. These remnants, also referred to as submarine glacial landforms, allow us to infer the extent of the past Greenland Ice Sheet as well as giving information of its ice stream pathways and its retreat behavior in the succession of the last ice age. In this thesis, data that have been acquired since the 1980s in the waters offshore Northeast Greenland have been investigated for submarine glacial landforms that are used to derive the setting of the past ice sheet system.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://elib.suub.uni-bremen.de/edocs/00105222-1.pdf"],"title":"Glacial history of the Northeast Greenland continental shelf and adjacent waters revealed by hydro-acoustic data","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

LD-As are set directly on the floor doing horizontal scanning at an elevation of about 20 cm above the ground, so that horizontal cross sections of the surroundings, containing moving feet of pedestrians as well as still objects, are obtained in a rectangular coordinate system of real dimension. The data of moving feet are extracted through background subtraction by the client computers that control each LD-A, and sent to a server computer, where they are spatially and temporally integrated into a global coordinate system. A simplified pedestrian's walking model based on the typical appearance of moving feet is defined and a tracking method utilizing Kalman filter is developed to track pedestrian's trajectories. The system is evaluated through both real experiment and computer simulation. A real experiment is conducted in an exhibition hall, where three LD-As are used covering an area of about 60/spl times/60 m/sup 2/. Changes in visitors' flow during the whole exhibition day are analyzed, where in the peak hour, about 100 trajectories are extracted simultaneously. On the other hand, a computer simulation is conducted to quantitatively examine system performance with respect to different crowd density.","inCitations":["4ed31d4af912ac82ec27b92711aa694671338107","2f48408a5d235e65219d9df9c1040288f752bf70","86e831a31d170551c007a3201edab13a496afd35","ae57d7a3de77124996ff7073246685b8581717a8","2ef39dc5ec422452077ff3cfa5b5d25fcbaa5d75","9d4d97565e34208d7b67a796396a6b5315c96840","fb8d7c00aab2c205b246080604e1fe49935543d7","6fc9e2635d8e1c3273ad2e115a80d6a702c8852e","f23589b00024d3295bbee38a22d6be027b606eb8","82731a7bd0bdb41e0bd9fedd0e9441078ad545d2","a6668d109336d658685d4daa5b0a2c55c8de8b5d","ad1865e348dbe792fdcbff300e92aab1eda416b0","bda594abf87e4f376e6ca2fd45d0addbd5941af0","535879048241da7b6b9b546f828893048763f176","f16dfdb612abe989ae67a01ec5f917fce43d7e6f","a537630bbf15ce3f1948e5fb84aec4b3f374365a","ee641a2658085cf3fe6df326a6cfac9293a5969e","e5429996ac47d823be0d82d7123eafd24b7c0177","518d7f0ea12556e46767a2e30ea342d982cd045d","b45c1821b62983be9ab7ea654739863d51a96364","732f4804e60a982c52dbd898c1786539f49bc2f5","899e2f29e5f45c3b332096bd2f4873da46c28d9b","b048bc589e297f52fdff7de383f7d8b64bbcaf65","480454207e50caa1496cd7825d427578ea9ee019","48fe15207a1edd755bb5557bd893d795d7ef2368","0dea02bd2c1bcffc2e675019d8d17930184da026","9829bb48737009ed3fa47a85ef1c75eb32afe24e","e872f503645ff296b2f16f0595e247922120c1f5","8e56d9fb83271abfc048b95abf8b516a1f18019b","7169e6fd6820e168def2a1b83152af0f0b902197","c92e93b25959f808315b41d30195e2aafc88f548","6737fc8f866c08a89b28e25dc06ad7363ee1e960","34309ffa285a8252bb03a4751e737aaeffaa5f56","d98db41fa2740171ecc241f6eee9f0b19ca3b13e","25944561bd9c092733030f15ae50b7266b0a7d78","e6c371393a5a725a2d1f3a5797ef3b409ec50400","cb1834cc24a526217dfa5cf946b59fe01c68d9fd","e907b1ece2efe8f15779c15a6293ede5cffb533e","189b51bacb01238b1acd9e07e56db2b0f1196136","0e249118e97d36f9cfecbdabd9d8dc8b20bf5ca4","beef6a2992535baf8c871a8b60b9f4a6e0066959","3415d119a8ebaa38a57da9e074c8ecccc5955b33","87cc66a7eae45f9df7fa10c14c77f4178abd2563","7fe3162f009ef6dcead2488d40f5c545b53ca85b","51d438a7d0841fa25367323f7b12d76c76d44caa","c8e839f398a3a5a9aaf1ba4c1525f73ed0b01be6","cb4e17d5713cef00216303ba8da7b9f81ce0d58b","4f5926a91fce0a869eeb0c9aa025a347544706c4","4736c86810cb0245ff45a6b50e4ba9a3bb914a8c","4ec4bde5bcced398f59741c498c3b73da87967c6","91b8045174ab998a436ff9406febfc8eb15ccb83","75898395db3d74df2c96b40c61a142e73f51f00c","b5d1c94579ea759a37dc2a6b036c2d18348c7495","7dfae94e45b68e9636599f120ddedf069e88e8c5","3d6d8d48627179950099fcda11d12157c0a78f42","8cfd812d476d4e1ab40341c707ad52a1e0181e03","f3a9489c4ee322eed4e05aadc8d9c348a15c7af1","6e936ff0e4952e12a33ce191af3d226676f87aac","dcd49e99e05853fdc093a1f02b8426c8a78cbdd7","69a0087693f7331f987d65115f6c156ac8fc2c21","155fe4c3cb2efbc0c4e46a93bcec5aba5fd87158","a888b395686fedfc3dc9aa43104a2ed3b20c8d27","3578e22eb1cd5be24ef28f6604e2170901a3b4bd","a5aa832348f487d4d780d4b6dcf1523fcf4182ba","a80460bdc770f67a130a8abaa1c4cfe5b5c7ecba","f08b25b904aac24b84e35ee7acbe208a7775f27b","179a37cb5416cea7d24b5820e75327ecf105e488","002b489967b23d9cacc55f12b97542a756329beb","0826802f6a47a493de132508505b79475f30356d","3972e4a91194c260d236c50671e39282ae0384e9","9976aa074a4913a9e2675dd7c0342593c4ae38bc","99374de79507beef0fc3f984f6cdb89b98235d9f","f64dd64020cd0a7ef20031a2f2d7f5e05c50e60a","4ff32d86676c1e9977ddd0cdce84c22447fde664","05cf34fe2475d54e5209fb5836bea4c2664e551e","effdb85fe473cd85983751eaf59210a6d351d9c0","ec0585295e05bc8d4eb57c597eff7b274d274704","a9f42ca9f0463eaf96de76aae6372731a54274c3","75e823572574e215056a26a1682ec7a99ba5f106","9c27da2f7f4165da1a91a825bb970bd9a59b09d6","c4c5bf013f175eec2db1ce056e393b15b74814f8","f5e8fea02525d595ecb5a8c196acfe9e179ed8a6","46fb768bb9663b8bd4d8d4aba5f59ce9dabf6a95","7d31a618720de3b9f24b290b964f3938e78d9bd2","92600923ccc3a3ca291e6710237d4d237f2b3a48","a22da21a679b7cddb16c89acdcb63ff0ed861121","904297f4e48d4ecf0e53a7a6bc6ab295d467c67f","1206de8942255cad0df390adf66eb52e0292d129","e37da455cee7a8598d0449382774b72d5b845450","78e4340abbdceff8dd2776cda521d4eeb1520bdb","e523656d18899a7a5c02bba8c4c7b37a19d78e90","7324452ec4b0fb00415dfe8e852853822f2878ff","c177e8777a91d329adcf88b9f5d1393635dbf5c7","74c0288d87b2c51d4fa788090f849e9318d17911","a4b3a534dea00ec9d708d61ad2a3710e5cfbe4c2","235ad66ededfc874381ece15ec4e854f5ee9d8cb","7be6c408443b769ddc0aa0bb13014d6b47186797","6e304f59700f33c7367b58e4784ebe72bec016e6","00dc4f1cee629411250be695216773efe9c9f16d","486be678c119d594f25614b22a07ecaa840bb031","e4bca30e25a35f3b731236f445e683504c2ccedb","b8a21cec281cbaa70ff3bb6b39e49287bf5e466f","4096640ba30720f9a1668302c404da049bab7b43","e0461ff8667472bcb8775a9f84f90e8d60dbbba8","04d804f63eef1931e25b554bd26484d3535b5cf6","24fa5eb7366cddcd87ae1ed80d76d6070d46a28e","dde2bab245d160a845fb4a5de0f24437ada56a90","a61fc608039b9aed4885ad58e1375bf2ef18c8d1","9854907cdfd33d2b58945b398d074bf803ebf5d0","6d9f13fee6668ae2844635fc5d47a1bb298268df","0b3cecf7a24ddf265108a21ac688d9523a8a6290","b1809040853e9f80f09e0fed8dff148207f3439e","f3296cabfda8e7f2eaf20ecfcb3dc4e461c3a02d","e0382e6bc9929fd04ef78d50a6051485871fd469","52f1c78137f5bc82d8bd4e76f9b576678c58ee05","cf8220d148ade52d01f2dbc08a3bc

To determine precisely the site(s) of estrogenic stimulation and the locus of its priming action on estrous behavior, we used steroid autoradiographic methods to assess the diffusion of [3H]estradiol ([3H]E2) from behaviorally effective implants diluted 1:300 with cholesterol. Ovariectomized rats received [3H]E2-cholesterol implants aimed at the ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus (VMN). Females were tested twice for feminine sexual behavior after stereotaxic surgery. They received progesterone on the day of behavioral testing.

Anatomically, the salivary glands consist of two glandular masses, lying in the lateral regions of the body cavity, which are composed of numerous alveoli of two distinct types: (1) non-granule-containing, and (2) granule-containing alveoli, referred to as type I and II alveoli respectively. Type I alveoli lack granules and appear to contribute very little to the salivary secretion, whereas type II alveoli contain two granule types in unfed ticks and three types in actively feeding ticks. Histochemical staining was used in the tentative determination of the chemical composition of some of the granules present in the type II alveoli and possible functions of these granules are considered in relation to feeding mechanisms in ixodid ticks. Also discussed is the possible functional significance of type I alveoli in water transport and ionic regulation as these relate to concentration of the blood meal.","inCitations":["b3e92c102026a848a3e475dd5abc44f4f5520229","a219e490473ec2c4866b63bfa9cd55ce6f0897b6","d58500ec2b8c1be86fcc2a27dd95d2c89beb1bb0","4ecf4f1bb30e33c4dc25fcc5bdbcd4559067f17d","0fd4f74fa52b5f7d774522c58533f2575907f714","4fe6cfa6a14277a33722a6f3a9547dda76407042"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Ultrastructural changes in the nymphal salivary glands of the rabbit tick, Haemaphysalis leporispalustris, during feeding.","doi":"10.1016/0022-1910(71)90138-7","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/0022-1910%2871%2990138-7","venue":"Journal of insect physiology"}

As the usage increased, it has also exposed its users to various security threats. Network forensic techniques can be used to traceback the source and the path of an attack that can be used as a legal evidence in a court of law. Packet attribution techniques like Source Path Isolation (SPIE), Block Bloom Filter (BBF), Hierarchical Bloom Filter (HBF) are proposed to store the packet data into the bloom filters at each router present in the network. All the routers in the Autonomous System (AS) are queried for presence of excerpt in their bloom filters to traceback source and path of attack. Upon receiving the excerpt query, each router search their bloom filters for presence of excerpt and send the result to NMS. NMS receives the response from routers and determines the traceback path from victim to source of attack. In this process, all the routers are engaged in searching the bloom filters, causing possible delay in performing actual routing tasks. This degrades network performance and may adversely affect QoS of network. To address potential performance issues, in this paper, we propose query optimization techniques, reducing the number of routers to be searched to a great extent, without adversely affecting storage and processing requirements as compared to existing attribution methods.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://web2py.iiit.ac.in/research_centres/publications/download/inproceedings.pdf.8357e42feb0d99d4.4f7074696d697a6174696f6e206f6620457863657270742051756572792050726f6365737320666f72205061636b6574204174747269627574696f6e2053797374656d2e706466.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIAS.2014.7064618"],"title":"Optimization of excerpt query process for Packet Attribution System","doi":"10.1109/ISIAS.2014.7064618","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIAS.2014.7064618","venue":"2014 10th International Conference on Information Assurance and Security"}

A qualitative review suggested that meaningful activity may facilitate recovery by providing a sense of purpose in life. Social firms may be well placed to offer this activity due to their ethos of empowerment, their community integration and their similarity to 'recovery-oriented services'.\n\n\nAIMS\nThe aim of this study was to explore experiences of recovery from mental illness in the context of two emerging social firms.\n\n\nMETHOD\nA social constructionist version of grounded theory was used to develop a model of recovery through participation in the emerging social firms. Multiple coding, triangulation and respondent validation were used to increase the rigour of study findings.\n\n\nFINDINGS\nA model of recovery in the context of the emerging social firms was constructed. This was influenced by characteristics such as a flexible structure, a meaningful and diverse activity, an accepting social group and an inclusive leadership.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nSocial firms may provide an important model for 'recovery-oriented services'.

The existence of the three-coordinate boron species in addition to the four-coordinate species in the resin phase is suggested.","inCitations":["6eecc370ba4e0c741b234e842a068bc5987483d0","b863bc164305d9a8931f0e24cb12f6b9927c5301","de9c302e1626ea0691736d4d3ebac734f7e20dbb"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Boron Isotope Fractionation in Liquid Chromatography with Boron-Specific Resins as Column Packing Material","doi":"10.1080/01496399708000739","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1080/01496399708000739","venue":""}

Thus, this study investigated the effect of pretreatment on the retention of the antioxidant properties and color of four tomato varieties; that is, Anna F1, Kilele, Prostar F1, and Riogrande during drying. Prepared quarters were treated by spraying with 0.5% sodium metabisulfate, 0.5% calcium chloride, and distilled water. The quarters were oven dried at 50°C, 60°C, and 70°C to 13% moisture content. Lycopene, β carotene, total phenolics, color, and moisture content were determined in both the fresh and dried samples. Initial moisture content among the four varieties did not differ significantly and ranged between 94.2 and 94.6%. Results showed that the main effects were significant (p < .05) on all measurable variables. Significantly (p < .05) higher retention levels in lycopene, β carotene, total phenolics, and lightness was observed in chemically pretreated samples compared to the control during drying.","inCitations":["c7c361668ba189704316e285f1a745f6c6383699","6dd7be7298866733f84b9422697f325f50c17fbd"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Effects of pretreatment during drying on the antioxidant properties and color of selected tomato varieties","doi":"10.1002/fsn3.581","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1002/fsn3.581","venue":"Food science & nutrition"}

It was shown that the optical technique used to monitor the sorption process in the supercritical fluid allowed the diffusion coefficients of carbon dioxide molecules in the samples to be determined both by analyzing the movement of optical boundaries and from volume swelling kinetics. The diffusion coefficients in poly(methyl methacrylate) and poly(butyl methacrylate) were assumed to be con- centration-dependent, and the models proposed were found to explain the formation of optical boundaries that had been detected experimentally in these samples. The experimental data were fitted to the results of computer simulation of the sorption process. Pore formation in the samples upon desorption of carbon dioxide in different exposure and decompression modes was visualized using optical (in situ) and atomic-force (ex situ) micros- copy. The plasticizing effect of CO 2 on the pore formation process is discussed.","inCitations":["85f710c90656032f02d63af86338444727c2142d"],"pdfUrls":["https://istina.msu.ru/media/publications/articles/315/41e/460383/PSSA581.pdf"],"title":"Poly(methyl methacrylate) and Poly(butyl methacrylate) Swelling in Supercritical Carbon Dioxide and the Formation of a Porous Structure 1","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

TiO2 sonophotocatalysis led to complete (acrylic acid-co-acryl amide) hydrogels degradation with increasing catalyst loading, while, the presence of TiO2 in the dark generally had little effect on degradation. Therefore, emphasis was totally on the sonolytic and sonophotocatalytic degradation of hydrogels and a synergy effect was calculated for combined degradation procedures (Ultrasound and Ultraviolet) in the presence of TiO2 nanoparticles.

The synthesized nanoparticles have been characterized with different techniques, such as x-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, field emission scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, UV–visible spectroscopy and dynamic light scattering measurements. Experimental observations have revealed the absence of any metal oxide layer around the nanoparticles which are found to remain stable under ambient conditions. The featured properties, such as narrow size distribution, stability, make these nanoparticles potential candidates for the synthesis of effective nanofluids. The nanofluids have been prepared by dispersing the nanoparticles synthesized through chemical route in a suitable base fluid. The thermal conductivity of nanofluids with different nanoparticles loading has been measured by transient hot-wire method, and the results have shown that the increasing trend of enhancement in thermal conductivity with respect to nanoparticles concentration is attainable only when the nanoparticles concentration is below some limiting value depending on the type of nanofluid. Beyond this limiting value of loading, the thermal conductivity of the nanofluid decreases due to pronounced agglomeration effect. The measurements of thermal conductivity of nanofluids over varying temperatures for a given volume fraction loading of nanoparticles have shown that the thermal conductivity increases markedly with the increase in temperature. Hence, nanofluids are likely to be much more promising at high-temperature applications.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"A Study on Thermal Conductivity and Stability of Nanofluids Containing Chemically Synthesized Nanoparticles for Advanced Thermal Applications","doi":"10.1007/s11665-018-3506-4","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11665-018-3506-4","venue":"Journal of Materials Engineering and Performance"}

The uniformity of micropore size in both types of carbon is demonstrated by the sharp reduction in their capacity to adsorb alkanes having two or more methyl groups as side chains, particularly when two of the methyl groups are attached to the same carbon atom. Heats of immersion of the carbons in the same alkanes show an even sharper reduction for branched chain alkanes, presumably as a consequence of the constraints imposed on molecules adsorbed in narrow pores resulting in lower net integral heats of adsorption.

Unfortunately, these studies failed to reveal the reasons why the organizations take long time to transit between different levels of CMMI and why every organization has different transition time between CMMI levels. The objective of this research work is to find out the hidden factors that affect the transition time between CMMI levels in an organization. In order to meet the objective of the research the secondary research approach was adopted in the form of extensive literature review and 50 face-to-face interview sessions were conducted with high profile IT professionals of Pakistan software industry. During the interviews, the interwees were asked to rate the identified factors on a 5-point scale and their impact in their respective organizations. This study has managed to identify 34 factors that affect transition time between CMMI levels and out these 34 factors two factors (political instability and waving economic policies) are specific to our country. These identified factors can simply be employed to the benefit of the organizations as has been validated in the interview sessions as scrutinized by this study.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Factors affecting the transition time between capability maturity model integration (CMMI) levels in software industry of Pakistan: An empirical study","doi":"10.1109/icict.2017.8320170","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/icict.2017.8320170","venue":"2017 International Conference on Information and Communication Technologies (ICICT)"}

The mandate of the 80-hour work-week, the introduction of integrated residency programs, increased global awareness about patient safety along with financial constraints have spurred changes in graduate educational practices. In addition, new technologies, more complex procedures, and a host of external constraints have changed where and how we teach technical and procedural skills. Simulation-based training has been embraced by the surgical community and has quickly become an essential component of most residency programs as a method to add efficacy to the traditional learning model. The purpose of this paper is twofold: (1) to describe the development of a perfused cadaver model with dynamic vital sign regulation, and (2) to assess the impact of a curriculum using this model and real world scenarios to teach surgical skills and error management. By providing a realistic training environment our aim is to enhance the acquisition of surgical skills and provide a more thorough assessment of resident performance. Twenty-six learners participated in the scenarios. Qualitative data showed that participants felt that the simulation model was realistic, and that participating in the scenarios helped them gain new knowledge, learn new surgical techniques and increase their confidence performing the skill in a clinical setting. Identifying the importance of both technical and nontechnical skills in surgical education has hastened the need for more realistic simulators and environments in which they are placed. Team members should be able to interact in ways that allow for a global display of their skills thus helping to provide a more comprehensive assessment by faculty and learners.","inCitations":["76f10c8b1284ff2189cafe20cf623fa645d2735e","388fe92d0f6f37bde3df2b901809cba7eb539049"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"The Development of a Novel Perfused Cadaver Model With Dynamic Vital Sign Regulation and Real-World Scenarios to Teach Surgical Skills and Error Management.","doi":"10.1016/j.jsurg.2017.09.020","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsurg.2017.09.020","venue":"Journal of surgical education"}

The most important of these communication processes is synaptic transmission, which accounts for the ability of the brain to rapidly process information, and which is characterized by the fast and localized transfer of a signal from a presynaptic neuron to a postsynaptic cell. Other communication processes, such as the modulation of the neuronal state in entire brain regions by neuromodulators, provide an essential component of this information processing capacity. A large number of diverse neurotransmitters are used by neurons, ranging from classical fast transmitters such as glycine and glutamate over neuropeptides to lipophilic compounds and gases such as endocannabinoids and nitric oxide. Most of these transmitters are released by exocytosis, the i.e. the fusion of secretory vesicles with the plasma membrane, which exhibits distinct properties for different types of neurotransmitters. The present chapter will provide an overview of the process of neurotransmitter release and its historical context, and give a reference point for the other chapters in this book.","inCitations":["f4a3a3ecf836c6bae689d53ab4273db3670f5c8a","b29c91aa4407c7303343db7d010d2efa6bbecb4c","8540671cdd8978697a2214403c741af125eb0fa2","57927365040740492d5cf3e956f13424eda914c2","8845aa00aae067dfadbbe4318290a6cb09563592","6742c6e34047fa6f6725c9f87bc3bcf9749eb84a","a1da952065d5d0a244098c8cbcf6d49c8dc40421","feac0f6304558abbe523d2fa180b0e7d8f537fc7","1b7a0a995ac279442125bebcec3971f808d904e8","3d5fb5b563f8f830f6a2f8c25a20b20f7ad09253"],"pdfUrls":["https://www.springer.com/cda/content/document/cda_downloaddocument/9783540748045-c1.pdf?SGWID=0-0-45-493000-p173756808"],"title":"Neurotransmitter release.","doi":"10.1007/978-3-540-74805-2_1","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-540-74805-2_1","venue":"Handbook of experimental pharmacology"}

They were randomized to have either high-dose NAC (1200 mg) plus saline hydration (Group 1, n=25) or only saline hydration (Group 2; n=20). Serum creatinine levels were determined 72 hours post-contrast. CIN was defined as 0.3 mg/dL elevation of creatinine from baseline and/or an increment of 20% over baseline creatinine and/or 20% decrement of estimated GFR.\n\n\nRESULTS\nIn Group 1, serum creatinine decreased from 0.83 to 0.79 mg/dL, whereas serum creatinine increased from 0.81 to 0.94 mg/dL in Group 2 (not significant for both groups). However there was a significant difference between the creatinine variation of two groups (p=0.031). Furthermore, the groups were analyzed according to overall incidence of CIN. The increase of serum creatinine and decrement of estimated GFR in Group 2 were significantly higher than in Group 1.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nAdding NAC to saline hydration seems more beneficial than saline hydration alone in preventing contrast-induced renal function deterioration in type 2 diabetic patients without nephropathy.","inCitations":["11a1ad0e71e81cee2c8c9285943b399ba766b62b","9a33a70d5485421de08fa5d518c2173b747c4bf1","50889ac50a94986f301c1aa305839c2e7cb0264a","295234676edb50c0adb333429e7c2db40eb54440","2158a486ca84fe1e4a384baa8a0c58ef2b1a9d57","869da936cd5329d6b774e85b0dc68ff07da4a22f","1b9705ba89d8a83efd26f6d30bb0018141a19e7a","3b08acc7db97167201c15f1ab0ab694a124aeefe","5f3d2b5c84ed29d261c054c5c91a042dd50f85b4","bc340d2f9628c31c44181ec71d1d93cbca35fec2","a12a37f6bb241b5e5a93b7d845b5a3a2307d9bc4"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"The efficacy of n-acetylcysteine in preventing contrast-induced nephropathy in type 2 diabetic patients without nephropathy.","doi":"","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"Journal of nephrology"}

Although variations in these abilities are prevalent in the neuro-typical population, persons diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) have deficits in the social domain and exhibit alterations in this neural network.\n\n\nMETHOD\nHere, we examined functional network properties of the AON using graph theory measures and region-to-region functional connectivity analyses of resting-state fMRI-data from adolescents and young adults with ASD and typical controls (TC).\n\n\nRESULTS\nOverall, our graph theory analyses provided convergent evidence that the network integrity of the AON is altered in ASD, and that reductions in network efficiency relate to reductions in overall network density (i.e., decreased overall connection strength). Compared to TC, individuals with ASD showed significant reductions in network efficiency and increased shortest path lengths and centrality. Importantly, when adjusting for overall differences in network density between ASD and TC groups, participants with ASD continued to display reductions in network integrity, suggesting that also network-level organizational properties of the AON are altered in ASD.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nWhile differences in empirical connectivity contributed to reductions in network integrity, graph theoretical analyses provided indications that also changes in the high-level network organization reduced integrity of the AON.","inCitations":["21f1e207fff3d3dcef2ffe0e3dd1539586ef1e0a","160380f915e94e58ca20514495f57e6ae020d6c9","241f6ff3e7847f66a0d50509f9c6faf07149d49e","8e97f5b62bf0464823290fd49b7990a9737e7028","65b2bc46b0c3124a37ef243caed8aff65a939757","ce8d05145501bba07a7561c43486cedbab69288b","9be122cdb398c6e9d190100d6816cd4b0f1599a3","46cc52ee9d70740fe4b41cb85c41fc73bed3b196","324bdf6bad44e3eefd35b8cca8d22ef8775ae030","4c0fbd0d0608ddfef32e97b7f586a150b625f450"],"pdfUrls":["https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0137020.s001&type=supplementary","https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0137020&type=printable"],"title":"Functional Organization of the Action Observation Network in Autism: A Graph Theory Approach","doi":"10.1371/journal.pone.0137020","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0137020","venue":"PloS one"}

Limited by the computer memory, the image must be partitioned into small regional blocks for the reconstruction, especially when dealing with fish-eye images. However, the reconstruction has a major shortcoming, that is, the image block is more blurred at the edge of the reconstructed image than at the center. This phenomenon is caused by the adoption of similar sampling rate to different image blocks in the traditional process. Given that each image block has different spatial resolutions, the sampling process is not reasonable. This paper proposes the fish-eye camera spatial resolution first. Afterward, the sampling rate of different image blocks is improved according to spatial resolution. Finally, some numerical experiments are performed. Results of the numerical experiments show that the method proposed in this study is effective.","inCitations":["ba86f0787bf2a701de332e1ad0b05b009f7c2f46"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Enhancement of fish-eye imaging quality based on compressive sensing","doi":"10.1016/j.ijleo.2015.05.077","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijleo.2015.05.077","venue":""}

We previously reported that miR-124 is correlated with prognosis of colorectal cancer due to PKM-dependent regulation of glycolysis. However, the mechanism by which miR-124 regulates apoptosis in colorectal cancer remains largely elusive. Here, we show that miR-124 induced significant apoptosis in a panel of colorectal cancer cell lines. The mitochondrial apoptosis pathway was activated by miR-124. Furthermore, the pro-apoptotic role of miR-124 was dependent on the status of PKM1/2 level. PKM1 was required for miR-124-induced apoptosis. Via direct protein-protein interaction, PKM1 promoted HNF4α binding to the promoter region of miR-124 and transcribing miR-124. Moreover, HNF4α or PKM1 had a more dramatic effect on colorectal cancer cell apoptosis in the presence of miR-124. However, inhibition of miR-124 blocked cell apoptosis induced by HNF4α or PKM1. These data indicate that miR-124 not only alters the expression of genes involved in glucose metabolism but also stimulates cancer cell apoptosis. In addition, the positive feedback loop between miR-124 and PKM1/HNF4α plays an important role in colorectal cancer cell apoptosis; it suggests that disrupting this regulatory circuit might be a potential therapeutic tool for colorectal cancer treatment.","inCitations":["85238475ee2d28acf3f801f0e149a9acdace8472","1cc2716a3790b5abea6e13328366c5edd9e5f487","11ef8e24e609e0688ebb04a1effad1114713f201","2adde4ee0c064e8b0ac6acab4af8f160feb27b39","6556a352abdd0fc31aa76568afd6d7d9d14b4d74","9840a134284b076ce650c41c0f86c4bf8ec8028f","241bf230eceb6096a917270461c3fa904fdf37e0","4c8fb2ba365d48cfcf07fb7beebe54ab92e838b4","aaf5132b47512053c5765bb3cbe9b7b12b27b601","ad6248e9f506a6c3025de490671fad2dd28fe052","1bef018696b5dc2e6790867d2cde183aff6f665d","e18042a63e0e03f224ace11536d32e45517cca96","e2664275fea4a49c88a6da749cb26a6874db9882","cb05480bb4e6ce723f0a39c28acb32912fb1601b","3221ab53b569bfa08fc9949cc613c0e300b98d53","fa74a35808adf16a07947708f53afd464a34775f"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/15/3/4318/pdf"],"title":"The Pro-Apoptotic Role of the Regulatory Feedback Loop between miR-124 and PKM1/HNF4α in Colorectal Cancer Cells","doi":"10.3390/ijms15034318","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms15034318","venue":"International journal of molecular sciences"}

A total of 599 diabetic patients attending these clinics for review were consecutively interviewed and clinically examined. Data on the care received was also obtained from their clinical records for the previous 12 months. Patients randomised to the active arm of the study were screened for complications.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe mean age was 58 years and 80.5% had a body mass index (BMI) ≥25 kg/m(2). Sixty-eight percent of patients were female. Acceptable glycaemic control and LDL-cholesterol were found for only 27% and 33% of patients, respectively (HbA1c<7%; LDL<2.5 mmol/l). Despite more than 79% of patients reporting to be hypertensive, 68% of patients had a systolic blood pressure above 130 mmHg and 64% had a diastolic blood pressure above 80 mmHg. Evaluating patient records of the preceding year, screening for eye complications was only reported in 8.2%, feet complications in 6.5%, kidney complications in 21.4% and cardiovascular complications in 7.8%. The screening prevalences found were 29% for retinopathy, 22% for maculopathy, 5% for neuropathy (neurothesiometer), 7% for nephropathy (eGFR stages 3-5), 17% for possible infarction (Rose questionnaire) and 36% for severe erectile dysfunction (SHIM questionnaire).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nDiabetes care and screening for complications at primary care level in the Tshwane district were found to be sub-optimal.

As counter- measures, passive filter components and advanced control methods have been proposed [2]. Furthermore, some other configurations of the converter, like neutral point clamped inverter, are able to provide common mode free output voltages under some restrictions in the modulation scheme. Recently Mohan [8] proposed an arrangement of two matrix converters to feed an open winding arrangement of a three phase AC motor. This configuration combines the advantages of an increased output voltage with a common mode free output voltage supply. Unfortunately, the control range for the input reactive current is limited by some restrictions in the control scheme. The aim of this paper is to increase the control range of the input reactive current to the same value as reached with the conventional matrix converter in [9]. An appropriate control method will be presented here and will be proven by simulation.","inCitations":["e5be420b27470848ff765f6a94e4311fc0af83f4","9108808725b14bf00e8c049f3954055ad7887251","8de9c5e800291d13200d2accbd114344844fec7e","1dbd84807df71935f57710bf6ddb97512046ce38","12bf4279bf217bc690d8eb08b7c80b77281be107","2fcfc13eac66fbe932c1a1920ea86367f9b19a25"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Enhancing the control range of a matrix converter with common mode free output voltage","doi":"10.1109/OPTIM.2008.4602408","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/OPTIM.2008.4602408","venue":"2008 11th International Conference on Optimization of Electrical and Electronic Equipment"}

Because of the difficulty of recognizing the condition clinically and the ease with which it is overlooked by the pathologist, the frequency and seriousness of this condition is probably not fully appreciated. Frazier 2 mentions three cases of fat embolism following forcible straightening of joints (brisement force) which were reported in Europe. Warthin 1 collected several others, also from Europe.

This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of vitamin A deficiency among patients with chronic HCV infection and to assess whether vitamin A deficiency could be associated with unresponsiveness to interferon-based antiviral therapy. The analysis included 199 consecutive treatment-naïve chronic HCV patients in whom pretreatment serum vitamin A and 25-OH vitamin D were measured; 119 healthy blood donors were used as controls. Median (interquartile range) serum vitamin A in HCV-positive patients was significantly lower than in controls: 256 ng/mL (128-440) versus 742 (624-942, P<0.0001). Overall sustained viral response was achieved in 122/199 patients, 46/109 infected by difficult to treat HCV genotypes. In these latter, 39/104 (37.5%) were nonresponders. At multivariate analysis, nonresponse to antiviral therapy was predicted by carriage of interleukin (IL)-28B T/* genotypes, baseline serum levels of γGT>60 IU/mL, of HCV RNA>600,000 IU/mL, of vitamin A≤100 ng/mL, and a cumulative dose of ribavirin≤80%. Seventeen patients (9.0%) had both serum levels of vitamin A≤100 ng/mL and of vitamin D≤20 ng/mL; the presence of a combined vitamin A and D deficiency was found to be a strong independent predictor of nonresponse to antiviral therapy.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nA high percentage of patients with chronic HCV infection have serum vitamin A deficiency. This condition is associated with nonresponse to antiviral therapy.","inCitations":["e94c8929f47f749e1afe4adc757fc528bdc0a6b4","4c48d8cd62d8d513ea24b2c01edaf7a8548eb67a","bf7c3538ab4e7ee881453665b1596475ee406e1c","c60f656804aed74d62b8616b9c4f6e82a7647239","54c2e500a98caf5654f5a1fad657d06622d8ff7c","860b20536f72ff9960a0e9341328fa394814891b","6da7c6812d7f376694104c85aec3bda2380b9609","99e8dc55a82c22c4b4cba9c789b110ef07356da7","f4f5da5f6b902f6ffd86665df785c594b462ec59","ae17bc9bb25027976c4a16a8eeed73689f7b9a17","98ca068b18d99874358aef1d46c2dbe270451855","d373358448a07f5f7bcdf8bb7a76badd85959bc0","58ece1f2db97b29a19ed2559918457dbf9d2ba46","74b1fc0710aeb820fae4993d1c26a2ef5f144bf6","bf60afd054dcfeac233d4eba9593229de5b275a4","a565aea6e7f0ce42e64365ed3a38518adafddf19","791f0c68121a474cb0d43a5678d4e8e9ac8de7e8","32d7fc700ff5452e60f2c64764001ec6c46fb542","37d1e5ffd4a033d33a114e070e0e4e2bf359cefc","2672f19d5441ca97294f6692f99a7c9b09b264d7","003ee202055911c4ead992b20c6687c5a5833831","b4e61bf0a32d6e664a7a83eb71a5741143a29a27","2c2d43568d18eea4707f686352cb1b9690e02dcf","7d83e9241487b1f6ef3d9599a2dd21b769969928","f9cc79f1a31e1f3a48ae0946e9ffe7fb3d5f96b1","28dbda60547dddb5981b0022c640bd9b42d36e9d","9c9ab7b66a0f1307a5561d2a191d9eab95addee6"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Vitamin A deficiency is associated with hepatitis C virus chronic infection and with unresponsiveness to interferon-based antiviral therapy.","doi":"10.1002/hep.26186","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1002/hep.26186","venue":"Hepatology"}

The CdS film is formed by a chemical bath deposition (CBD) process and exhibits an n-type semiconducting property. An efficient inverted PSC is fabricated using a CBD-grown CdS film as the electron collecting layer (ECL), which is inserted between the indium tin oxide (ITO) cathode and the polymer bulk heterojunction active layer. The experimental results reveal that the cell response parameters depend critically on the deposition procedures in terms of bath temperature, deposition time and annealing temperature. A two-fold increase in the overall power conversion efficiency of inverted PSCs is realized with the optimization of CBD-grown CdS film properties through the deposition for 2 h at 50 °C and the annealing treatment at 200 °C. The simple and low-cost deposition method of CdS films is promising for the fabrication of hybrid PSCs.","inCitations":["3ccd93ff7bcd4284fb06081cfbf4e93d531d0328"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Solution-processed inverted polymer solar cells using chemical bath deposited CdS films as electron collecting layer","doi":"10.1039/C2CE25698C","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1039/C2CE25698C","venue":""}

The toxicity of these two compounds in aqueous ethanol was studied in guinea-pigs by i.v. perfusion of the solution at the rate of 0.4 mg/kg/min. Alborixin appeared to be two times more toxic than grisorixin and they both produced a marked increase in arterial blood pressure within 5 and 10 min after the beginning of the perfusion, together with ECG modifications such as conduction and repolarization disorders. Similar effects were observed in animals treated by a single injection of grisorixin (2 mg/kg) or alborixin (1 mg/kg). Under these conditions both antibiotics were found to produce a tremendous increase in kaliemia (+ 200%) and a concomitant hyponatremia. They did not modify intramyocardial ATP and ADP levels but they might affect creatine phosphate concentration as shown by an increase in inorganic P levels. It is suggested that the cardiovascular effects observed are due to the alterations in intra- and extracellular ionic activities by grisorixin and alborixin.","inCitations":["dcb14233bcea0661f16137fff73851ebde6a8ef3"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"The cardiovascular effects of two monocarboxylic inophores, grisorixin and alborixin, in anesthetized guinea-pigs.","doi":"","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"Arzneimittel-Forschung"}

Foliar nitrogen concentrations were ephemerally increased by nitrogen fertiliser.","inCitations":["5f646251dd179786178492ad4542b9c178742e76","adde46ccd87cbe9559e453cadd281bd8ebcee8b3","5dddc20eb87d2d43367c12ff3ab890abd193d112","0cbfbefa61a154803d1b80acae49b24e2d2f7a0e","9a7404b67af321de85c4a859fb92a5fe36f9e819","6dd6fe9f26d057ee19a3a0bee9d967d57e08979e","76f859c80c09967c05c4d3472a02614f82d7b0be","632f660d008312701a03fa0d019ed09b5df819bf","50d8120b5bd18bf4ab736a745085697f4f5afc46","f44bf4a90b1df09285ec2ea34f20f95a83d86e52","0bd7b168f21a7d0e019da25edfb149939a66d9e2","78d84c3ee4d285df04839013515a68d130cd513b","27b9d248dfa89f9ece0be9c66d8bdd0fbb566ea0","f6fd4dd680a3852ca4ad4d38ad49277eb83191b5"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.scionresearch.com/__data/assets/pdf_file/0009/36486/NZJFS1311983HUNTER3_13.pdf"],"title":"Growth and Nutrition of Pinus Radiata on a Recent Coastal Sand as Affected by Nitrogen Fertiliser","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}
