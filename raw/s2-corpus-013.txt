One of the efforts to improve long-term national energy security length is through reducing dependence on fossil energy, and the government must take swift action to use renewable energy. The methodology in this research uses internal factor evaluation analysis, external factor evaluation and SWOT matrix. Furthermore, the data used is secondary data in the period 2017–2022 coming from various official sources. The development of renewable energy in the world followed by the technology, more advanced technology used, the cost of investment and renewable energy tariffs will be cheaper, thus will be more competitive with electricity from fossil energy. Currently the installed power generation capacity in Indonesia is 57 gigawatts, of which 86% still use fossil energy and the remaining is renewable energy. Renewable energy in Indonesia becomes a very potent alternative, where the energy source depends on the geographical area and the source of energy it produces. The potential of renewable energy in Indonesia is very big, Indonesia has 40% geothermal potential in the world.","inCitations":["becefca5c647463cb8c8ab7256ce3f7fa643d714","f6486e5b0614bdc52fa218f250ebe38c1e7a0d0d"],"pdfUrls":["https://www.econjournals.com/index.php/ijeep/article/download/6844/3940"],"title":"Marketing Strategy for Renewable Energy Development In Indonesia Context Today","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Millions of children took in his tales of the Disney characters Donald Duck and Uncle Scrooge. Often set in the Global South, Barks’s stories offered pointed reflections on foreign relations. Surprisingly, Barks presented a thoroughgoing critique of the main thrust of U.S. foreign policy making: the notion that the United States should intervene to improve “traditional” societies. In Barks’s stories, the best that the inhabitants of rich societies can do is to leave poorer peoples alone. But Barks was not just popular; his work was also influential. High-profile baby boomers such as Steven Spielberg and George Lucas imbibed his comics as children. When they later produced their own creative works in the 1970s and 1980s, they drew from Barks’s language as they too attacked the ideology of modernization.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://faculty.wcas.northwestern.edu/daniel-immerwahr/DonaldDuck.pdf"],"title":"Ten-Cent Ideology: Donald Duck Comic Books and the U.S. Challenge to Modernization","doi":"10.1017/mah.2020.4","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1017/mah.2020.4","venue":""}

Outcome measures included condom use at last intercourse and frequent (at least \"most of the time\") condom use during the past 3 months. Logistic regression was used to examine the association between each outcome and length of time since HIV testing, controlling for other putative predictors of condom use.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe sample consisted mainly of African-American (79%) heterosexual (95%) men and women, almost half (44%) of whom were less than 26 years old. Regression analyses indicated that recent HIV testing was significantly associated with safer sex. Prevalence of condom use at last intercourse was highest among respondents who received an HIV test <3 months before the survey, whereas frequent condom use during the past 3 months peaked among clients who had been tested 3 to 5 months before assessment.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe occurrence of a brief \"surge\" in safer sex among recent HIV counseling and testing clients, regardless of serostatus, suggests that these individuals may be particularly amenable to additional interventions designed to achieve longer term reductions in risky behaviors.","inCitations":["dfe6426b48d8c512e0f334ef29f39d83017e10b8","4fd75fdad95a809785f2208f75cf91062a6722a4","fa76546e2fe893362237dc9a89d3a325ce424ce4","0d42bf18c9185f42edd3f9ffd1215e3963311dc9","dc1db515c4e578e3358ffe548859b2a53f8d8f6f","a50db52b4687317f9a7aaf61b7643655b4a2d80b","146063e91bb239d18a023e7fea14ab44e5a37b00","dbdb275d47f6e91ba09d1af7270d0dd87247c08b","3e3bf3e6e0efc9c753baa46d11e8e03866027a60","287d391eead98450d1e28a0f75471dca20224070","9feeb9daceece5dad8572d206c110e75e79011a2","fc8aad23a3574e730e56940e53e702ddf5a0c8bb","451f190d643bec12043c43690d85dec6912d929b","8b3c1d25ca8f6e08fe7fe3a69426f3da90a3f7c6","52a9fa8e9ba0d82a2e09a80483100be77c2b3b4f","f96faa8377594f8f027d399e5608077b4fa7feb6","854d0f09c43563c3599f1b8b5040db6ffaa8970e"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Evidence of a brief surge in safer sex practices after HIV testing among a sample of high-risk men and women.","doi":"","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"Journal of acquired immune deficiency syndromes"}

B. [1], [2]) weisen häufig systematische Fehler auf, über deren Ursachen bisher noch wenig bekannt ist. Es ist anzunehmen, daß das Meßergebnis bei einer in der Probe auftretenden Konvektion stark verfälscht wird, da es sich hierbei im allgemeinen um einen Prozeß handelt, der im Vergleich zur Diffusion um ein Vielfaches schneller verläuft. Auf den störenden Einfluß der Konvektion wurde in der Literatur hingewiesen [3, 4, 5, 6], CARERI und Mitarbeiter [7] vermuten einen Effekt, der die Diffusion in hemmender Weise zu beeinflussen scheint, den sogenannten Wandeffekt („wall effect\"), welcher dadurch zu erklären sei, daß die Gefäßwände der Diffusionsproben den Diffusionsprozeß unmittelbar an der Gefäßwand behindern. FIXMAN [8] konnte durch theoretische Berechnungen bestätigen, daß die Diffusion der Teilchen, die sich in unmittelbarer Nähe einer glatten Gefäßwand befinden, gehemmt wird. Da die Wahrscheinlichkeit für das Auftreten einer Konvektion mit steigendem Probendurchmesser zunimmt, würden die Meßwerte der Selbstdiffusionskoeffizienten flüssiger Metalle bei Anwendung von großen Probendurchmessern zu hoch liegen. Der Wandeffekt hingegen müßte sich bei Verwendung von sehr kleinen Probendurchmessern dadurch bemerkbar machen, daß die Meßwerte zu tief liegen. Zur weiteren Klärung der Zusammenhänge schien es daher sinnvoll, nach dem in [1] beschriebenen Kapillar-Eintauchverfahren die Selbstdiffusionskoeffizienten bei Verwendung verschiedener Probendurchmesser zu messen.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Über den Einfluß von Vibrationen auf das Ergebnis von Selbstdiffusionsmessungen in geschmolzenen Metallen, untersucht am Quecksilber","doi":"10.1515/zpch-1962-22127","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1515/zpch-1962-22127","venue":""}

Interconnectivity and macroporosity of β -TCP porous substrate were 99.9% and 83%, respectively, and the macro-porosity of packed granule after crushing was 69%. Calvarial defect model with 8 mm diameter was generated with male Sprague-Dawley rats and 60TCP40HA was implanted. Bio-Oss was implanted for a control group and micro-CT and histology were performed at 4 and 8 weeks after implantation. The 60TCP40HA group showed better new bone formation than the Bio-Oss group and the bone formation at central area of bone defect was increased at 8 weeks in micro-CT and histology. The percent bone volume and trabecular number of the 60TCP40HA group were significantly higher than those of Bio-Oss group. This study confirms the usefulness of the porous 60TCP40HA composite as a bone graft extender by showing increased new bone formation in the calvarial defect model and improved bone formation both quantitatively and qualitatively when compared to Bio-Oss.","inCitations":["cb74af45d90ae35dd01f6945469ab7255197edc5","097d8f111cabb0445339579540b9e7d046faeb47","b292ec9fa8721dae37ca2707b69ed815d631a9a6","87069bcb8701daec610bfcaf222c7ab6eba07ae3","285e3459416ea12361e69074fe4850cabd0288f0","8868f8a6f7a01cd72a3f3f5a7276bb946b00e5cc","84bef829e8783ff72ffedc7ba47873931ac678d8","f0968c9147abdfc68dadf4f77f0a139dd3275402","e7cb98d9c33d77202875eabac7358ec81cb9b72f","2b769e8506090a556792546361ef95705341cf98"],"pdfUrls":["http://downloads.hindawi.com/journals/tswj/2013/481789.pdf"],"title":"Fabrication and Evaluation of Porous Beta-Tricalcium Phosphate/Hydroxyapatite (60/40) Composite as a Bone Graft Extender Using Rat Calvarial Bone Defect Model","doi":"10.1155/2013/481789","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1155/2013%2F481789","venue":"TheScientificWorldJournal"}

We now show that P. cubensis occurs in fruits and seeds of downy mildew-infected plants but not in fruits or seeds of healthy plants. About 6.7% of the fruits collected during 2012-2014 have developed downy mildew when homogenized and inoculated onto detached leaves and 0.9% of the seeds collected developed downy mildew when grown to the seedling stage. This is the first report showing that P. cubensis has become seed-transmitted in cucurbits. Species-specific PCR assays showed that P. cubensis occurs in ovaries, fruit seed cavity and seed embryos of cucurbits. We propose that international trade of fruits or seeds of cucurbits might be associated with the recent global change in the population structure of P. cubensis.","inCitations":["7ada718568c23c5d68ef6a62ccf83c665a930154","2b4ab4a1d4438bb4bb00c69a37a31665202c716c","55603fe0f96154adc009b03720086b1f8e934532","326229c0ac0e25f7852f42d746affcc4b89358bb","cadbc8610f91a3b993bb0b16ed68f79d88977a9e","b3094ae327bf2801a13ee9aa8a55717d1f5f0453","9dee504b3a38d623a92808efd9af271341aa1db6","80c67d1a2b7397081fca07cc09272c14e414b673","210cb4978d58f01dbd9ea7e36c3c142bc4c3f178","610fa2f4103053a40585358a06ccd4293d5ac207","5bef83629c303f8faff9d04303526fc92fb695a9","863e1fe76bd3a674da2313dbea7b0a4aa96c3d6b","61e3be2f7a92a214fa72072eddce1a35db245b0b","393e58c3e7e16beb8f8e6f23bd5113aa3fcf2962"],"pdfUrls":["http://publikationen.ub.uni-frankfurt.de/opus4/frontdoor/deliver/index/docId/35301/file/journal.pone.0109766.pdf","http://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/pmc/d2/42/pone.0109766.PMC4201460.pdf","https://s3.amazonaws.com/udextension/fieldcropdisease/files/2014/10/Seed-transmission-17-10-2014-PolsOne.pdf"],"title":"Seed Transmission of Pseudoperonospora cubensis","doi":"10.1371/journal.pone.0109766","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0109766","venue":"PloS one"}

Patients in the control group received routine nursing care, while patients received early rehabilitation nursing in the study group. Postoperative hemodynamics, quality of life, levels of serum inflammatory factors, lipoprotein associated phospholipase A2 (Lp-PLA2), IL-6 and TNF-α were compared between the two groups. \nResults: Before the intervention, there were no significant differences between the two groups in cardiac output, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, pulse pressure and heart rate (p>0.05). After the intervention, cardiac output of patients in the two groups significantly increased (p 0.05).

Increasing sodicity stress (pH 8.0, 9.4, 9.8, and 10.0 achieved by using sodium bicarbonate) adversely affected growth with delayed initiation of tillering and reduced the grain filling period. Total and filled grains per panicle, 1,000 grain weight, and grain yield were significantly lowered even at pH 9.4. Analyses of the shoot at 30 days after transplanting and at maturity showed a pronounced increase in Na concentration with a decrease in ? and calcium (Ca).

For this reporting period our goals were to fabricate and characterize microparticles to be used in animal surgeries, achieve IACUC/ACURO approval for animal work and start the first phase of rodent hindlimb transplants. Particles containing IL-2,TGFb, and rapamycin were fabricated and this triple cocktail, along with all pairwise iterations of the three components were tested for their ability to prevent hindlimb rejection (via 2 subcutaneous injections). Data at present seems to suggest that the combination of all three factors yields the best results, however some groups are still in the follow up period and accordingly, no statistical significance can be claimed until the follow up period is completed (this will happen within the next month).","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/1034022.pdf","https://apps.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/1064262.pdf"],"title":"Regulatory T Cell-Enriching Microparticles for Promoting Vascularized Composite Allotransplant Survival","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

This is thought to be the oldest discovered human use of tar-hafted stones. The birch-bark-tar adhesive is a simple, one-component adhesive. Although sticky enough, plant-based adhesives are brittle and vulnerable to environmental conditions. The first use of compound adhesives was discovered in Sibudu, South Africa. Here, 70,000-year-old stone segments that were once inserted in axe hafts were discovered covered with an adhesive composed of plant gum and red ochre (natural iron oxide) as adding ochre to plant gum produces a stronger product and protects the gum from disintegrating under wet conditions. The ability to produce stronger adhesives allowed middle stone age humans to attach stone segments to sticks in greater variations, which led to the development of new tools.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Engineering Materials and Surface Coatings","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Gel filtration on Ultrogel AcA 34 of mixtures of 125I-labeled EPA and human plasma, incubated at 37 degrees C, revealed the progressive formation of two radioactive components, one with an apparent Mr of 150,000 and one eluting at the void volume. The component with an Mr of 150,000 was identified as consisting at least in part of EPA-alpha 2-antiplasmin complex since: 1) it reacted with antibodies against alpha 2-antiplasmin, but not with antibodies against the other known plasma protease inhibitors, and 2) formation of this component was strongly reduced in plasma specifically depleted in alpha 2-antiplasmin or when the active site of EPA was blocked. The component eluting at the void volume was identified as consisting at least in part of EPA-alpha 2-macroglobulin complex since: 1) it only reacted with antibodies against these two proteins and 2) was not formed in plasma depleted in alpha 2-macroglobulin or when the active site of EPA was blocked. In purified systems alpha 2-antiplasmin inhibited one-chain EPA with a rate constant of 60 M-1s-1 and two-chain EPA with a rate constant of 130 M-1s-1, which corresponds to a t 1/2 in plasma of 180 min or 90 min, respectively. alpha 2-Macroglobulin inhibited one-chain EPA with a rate constant of 15 M-1s-1 and two-chain EPA with a rate constant of 30 M-1s-1, which corresponds to a t 1/2 in plasma of 4 or 2 hrs. All these findings taken together indicate that EPA is slowly neutralized in human plasma primarily by alpha 2-antiplasmin and to a lesser extent by alpha 2-macroglobulin. There appears to be no specific inhibitor in human plasma, which would inactivate EPA either rapidly or to a significant extent.","inCitations":["17714c5b30121c9711543f8090a029d5eafdc4c5","65d46d71071c0697d0fb13f0c13b9b8a88ebbc8c","efc144f0f8de6a3419b976332788328414b58a14","e1780153810be8213a44606422f415c46252ec5c","0027fd26ce5db124f9fae6199e5ec8d8b4fb7e60","d483c57121111f285b1e6c5d5b77dbf9f4b2be1a","dc9d462ea7b763d519a5586b0572eb1b125f4185","1285adbc701e74db4665489388d4baf531ec55a0","2aa8d8bdb3afb9d97188b893c97b738f17779d61","8e177dafa59df57fe1142e3ef48130d1d61d47b2","1c8672bc99080df461839f19d1e47ef90b0873b3","1d74248fb735038d60507494867a88f2285249a6","60a79d0c990637291ba825591f6bdaf15c1f18ab","c7adb765c5ae64315fc1eb3502e1f4fb3169841b","a916321e6dc791d6bf298ad84e1ca0b3e2f9b60e","aef2c8b300cc7cc96068cfb78783345e70d60448"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Neutralization of human extrinsic (tissue-type) plasminogen activator in human plasma: no evidence for a specific inhibitor.","doi":"10.1055/s-0038-1653443","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0038-1653443","venue":"Thrombosis and haemostasis"}

There was a statistically significant positive correlation between anxiety and ISS (r = 0.536, P < 0.01). Two patients died during the early postoperative period. Two additional patients were lost to follow-up, leaving 36 patients followed for an average of 45 months (range 21-116 months). Deep infections developed in three patients with a posterior pelvic ring injury who had been treated with percutaneous fixation techniques. These were treated successfully with débridement. Nine patients complained of pain of pelvic origin. Nerve deficits recovered completely in four of the seven patients with preoperative neurologic deficiency. Moderate or major depression was diagnosed in sexually dysfunctional patients in the 12th postoperative month according to HDARS (r = -0.559, P < 0.001). At the last visit, there was an inverse correlation between ability to work and depression and anxiety (r = -0.551, r = -0.391). An inverse correlation was found between pain and ability to work (r = 0.597, P < 0.001). Of the 36 patients, 26 returned to their original jobs at the last follow-up visit.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nMorbidity and mortality rates are higher in patients with a completely unstable pelvic ring injury. Emergency department stabilization and reconstruction of the pelvic ring with optimal operative techniques in these patients can reduce morbidity and mortality rates. Anterior and posterior internal fixation results in satisfactory clinical and radiologic outcomes. The affective status of patients is an important aspect that should be considered during the entire care of the patient.","inCitations":["c795aba05de01b9a13c0d92043ef5cb9d02e7613","0990b7615df0dc695882dcf4bd681a6aa6005061","b4c8e0e2ac06c98987733ed784953fb737b1b499","09188e4f5504874165134fd6fd03990a6797a70b","ec5f63f55641166eb44e6f669936e4fbaa711cbb","ff61e969497fb80b15db8b3fde3d32e8826fed11","f2263c29760be9325d60aff0b8672930748f4d18","f227d376d2bb51f21b6d6edbecbf107f10e482c4","0632f007b456b914b539038abb88165c5c3da742","57d6a9a18e293b003f6337ca7fe6d26e1ac043af","57dc589c48a16ce7bd16fbfb76d7603f9365332e","deacf32eebaab7e37f95a9869dd3ba4fc3705003","02bf9fc76c384a941cea42bcb504140e0d36ea55","41c34e50c5401ab87219a55849645849f93ae1e9","2c253984b4c8cddbd0d7b85a321cee4ce564591b","cae9341ad39fd74b93a379925847da2302f30551","1aed974900a0ee08fea6eeccfdca49c124c6df62","3744c7b26eba5c5c322f5570241b66be3f26edd5","50e6ea81a85b9f129dd3f10d4c40ca2d7b120c46","3f6c92792c7b0c8bee1cb172cb7b55394c71c480","0455831bf2020422ae20eae98bfd5cb32f6e5d62","cd7191869239b688068b843b24b73d053c867d49","424f762b18e512557bacbcfb2979e55c1917243d","b2e1d50f7b23b6d9a7677e07ef9ab3a35b406b7f","27a166984111024afe35b76315af0466cb7bf312","bede103931197aaf202d724cb94ea61979e4a2cf","73f84c0b95fddb7c334e0b872fde6540d0279a5b","d2ac63abb3a68bd849c53e4b59dec66c8674bbc6","b22149f48c4a0e690f309105ddcfdc27b2a401cd","f164f621e2b5bada70b9714483c295abe5de66d1","b4201b8776fe6e72b092369440db549d4f147796","291aed5b3a00dce7ebcc0fdb627c5f06b66af170","0d8189c7805d7d3c7655d0bcf2ff7791a02d3597","4bd73da0ca5250a412566308defbf4184a04c0ec","ff8326131d6d5e5fbca583699f813e6e63a075fe","04026690129a493c299d1c3a01820d9eb993b404","44bbc441116f5ca54fc72963219f492cff3f9516","292654c0c0b4dea2e14a1cdcf8ac9748c445ee6e","1bbda75dc9c3780622623da97f9107fab8c2e059","888d900183419775620df0563715b7f27e61e5f9","08cdfd6e51ec992699d4118180dbb050a6eb6df9","3b77dae3f9a1f3a4c7b620ac8ddd744e05811f50","fb3a697d86490890da8cbc41d324665ef5c59f20","601337568521eb2ecf83ae826b94188776ce8e89","9de02c55dc10c0d3184449388c13260d76764fee","fac01468fb1ffdf02529b40f24cbe459bf27b5c6","c3e37e5c12bbcef054765a6e17a6136e6e7f2ace","fee0876a0db67995dffa16c65dc274ab351761cb","a1b6e41510d8704c4f25b60bc6d0c6db7f9cab42","99e78558e5141524b0985acf3ed705dd029df901","6cb78d8a848ff8eac467c70542f73c965d117af4","c9deb360487f25bcdd58ce265568c7a8556fe82f","5286c438f36283cac2574f471fb72e17e1b4f7e2","0b44f03bef6b3b6566258d27ba07c3bb59624989","35dc65e1a6ee76570873a3356156ae5ee704b89d","9edd02eaecb475cd08dabc9996be86443b32c607","1987cb6695751d625871905e1348b2d2b71a21f5","b83b06b93026b42e330771cbb22a45e2d127391a","5333f0751b0d7c2e249b919c00851bd17d4a89b4","9ecc644aaadbe3afab17a8e2d6506e5f92761bfa","3777ac12b8d71d33cc74b2a761153f2b3702128f","42953da0edde496f6271e9f108395f62e0432318","225bbd1488568a7ba4161d21242e89d51532e39f","1a2d2393724bdace99ae5ffb3bd646c0054b5112","5e2e2a386868aa0ea943fbadfed4bfe4094c6081","f9bfd43cc437fcb0185748990d0a21efb24a3df2","867aca69645651ad29e68d796dcdc44c031354f8","a3fe11d80a3ae3400d4be0827cceb5e75fe68efe"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Functional outcome of open reduction and internal fixation for completely unstable pelvic ring fractures (type C): a report of 40 cases.","doi":"10.1097/00005131-200309000-00003","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1097/00005131-200309000-00003","venue":"Journal of orthopaedic trauma"}

The LIL method can be used for a wide range of nano-pattern spacing by adjusting the laser intensity, exposure time, and development time. In addition, it has been used in many studies due to its advantage with regard to the forming of nanostructures over a large area in a short period of time. However, the existing LIL technique requires demanding precision levels to align the laser beam. In this paper, we attempt to solve this problem by using a prism laser interferometer to complement the complicated beam alignment of LIL. In this study, ma-p1205 PR-coated silicon wafers were exposed to a CW laser with 360 nm wavelength using a contact-type and a non-contact prism interferometer. A rectangular triangular prism and an equilateral triangular prism of N-BK7 were used, and periods of 300 nm and 260 nm were fabricated, respectively. The MATLAB and COMSOL programs were used to compare the theoretical values and fabricated patterns.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"360 nm Continuous Wave Laser-Based Contact or Non-Contact Laser Interference Nano Lithography.","doi":"10.1166/jnn.2020.17261","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1166/jnn.2020.17261","venue":"Journal of nanoscience and nanotechnology"}

This role has implications for the poverty status of the rural farming households. The factors that determine whether or not the womenfolk, in the rural farming households, would participate in off-farm economic activities, was investigated. A multi-stage sampling technique was used to obtain primary data from a cross-section of 200 rural farming households. Structured questionnaire was used, of which 195 were found amenable for data processing. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics and Logit regression model. Major findings showed that women educational attainment (β=0.321) and rural household’s total income (β=-0.71) were significant determinants of women participation in off-farm economic","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://www.futa.edu.ng/journal/home/downloadpdf/paper_3_1545131416"],"title":"Determinants of Participation of Rural Women in Off-farm Economic Activities in Obafemi Owode Local Government Area of Ogun State","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

A self-administered questionnaire consisting of both Likert-type and open-ended questions was used to survey registered nurses working in hospitals and community services in a large Australian city. A total of 140 questionnaires were returned from a variety of clinical settings. The study revealed that registered nurses had a significant role in chronic wound management. However, they relied primarily on their own experience and that of colleagues for decision making in which they had varying degrees of autonomy. The authors conclude that nurses and medical staff require more objective, research-based education on wound assessment and management.","inCitations":["529c1ad45e8a5553eb8f49078de2062ee8be95b7","3edaaec35c40a5e879e3eed8c45eb8cb14b9e967","90457ee924577ccd61f53b899ab204004f18c065","f6a6965e730c5f28ef61950c31a9faa23c4ca3e3","2f93bd107f02479a9d4993f4ede8abba0fe49ee1","cd0e24e7c357b9819a553a084b1a4c91c18cdff2","fc20f3564f45058f999fbeeeaf697f856c91961c","ec877901c04c0e16f1146454fd3c136227eced53","0eda4bbc8842549acb016595f060d0838d4fc366","7edf5af63a5224746dd70d90f8d93818924e311e"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"The management of chronic wounds: factors that affect nurses' decision-making.","doi":"10.12968/jowc.1999.8.8.25912","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.12968/jowc.1999.8.8.25912","venue":"Journal of wound care"}

A video system was used to record the ball trajectory in water. The values of the drag force, Magnus force, and drag torque coefficients were determined experimentally and compared with the results of the numerical simulation of the particle motion. The evaluation of the experiments focused on the effects of two dimensionless parameters of the particle motion: the translational Reynolds number (or Reynolds number) and rotational Reynolds number. The experiments were carried out for the relatively slow (the dimensionless angular velocity Γ < 3.5) and relatively fast (5 < Г < 10) particle rotation.

MHz.","inCitations":["ce3ea860641923857bdad52cd8b3d36d93744e06","a91eac96f282aedf0eca2385c3534bfc3fc4a205","99fe66fbe13516fd6ce43e3abe5d55c4b7362223","b2697d7846d7416656bdcd75cf8e9935a45bd13a","c856d752a81ff1c32d8398b969f47d129510ce4d","0e965aab9e5eea52688548c97582c4edf0f8b213","8e22d4a887af5c5cdbb288d2c12e485aca4aae1a","3f3452cc23f12a5b56b735306c8a86d2c589d27f","dd8241378b14a8042a78d866b2efc5cc0a398545","95762833daed8093651e001735300b8a75db79ba","d6307cb987f5538b1be36063327f6df55e117ed7","fd12f6a864f0f074550ddb0e2fa04a1eeeb21dbf","d3aaf7c89e398e6ba0f054e1f297ae4d0e10aee5","b83f086a6f0057688f325277fc8af96a40c33270","2af37a9b12c14183dac4c9055141147dfd1ae97a","d2afadd5ca8876ed08f32bc94065177bdcba4960","abcc9ef5f8abedd32796f7984835d94da13649e3","bbf804e52788f318036c6f26ff64d6ca5a4a501f","fc5bfa4e18c4c84dfbe8d3848a7ebe864d826fb1","a85373351246bbc17b4c6e5c371c8aff895d5e0c","21c0da421b70c02d592837b0168dbcd1174c05fc","443214c5c2a1331686a791814107a633734d35ab","319af1f0cc00c84197657ee4a628154a0a634449","0489aca8ab83ca3b439b95cf262d646ccd87e907","f51816f0af61ec14b39393c0c410a600375e4745","7c76e388bbec23e2e7a7f1d61fa7ac9017a61afe","7267ebc2fe32905500dfc114d91e631c8b6f66f1","44b9a5458bc726326504244491b616162b24bf6c","50331863943018273576a8328f62567c72e29dcf","14f9d8fb3914d68d33d55b4c9c9b981f7a20dff7","615eb05abd59d6df4dcd96033c6a573c9bc10740","00a6e89214a0dd0407a78e0a5840b241dcf87d42","4be5163bf2847ade71190fd5d9a8ed3a632b403f","b684d50ed337ed01c5fac141a44f4e35e74a7be2","f7ff8e01979f0505a553584e77d37f048a17d7bf","41d0683f850dd507167fa6d2ffe5ca9f8de2c51e","f248c071432bcddc54a51a064e32487759f20469","07dda181e0aaa310c4dfff8b5752f2baf082b969","06e720fbf95ff02710c1c51d559391de5b0cd424","6373eb3e5003da5ca88ecfeef435d7f96dc1ed27","b5db0977ce018827e055cda9c9348f14065bed9c","68879395ac1a9242486de06c0e531884095f5d9d","a2860605a3689aeb8dd5ccfa2738869362469510","a9fb4925836e06cca1b30ac9e8515336e8016c50","fcf23148dd1872d1f0e0cc40ecadeb64a196b15b","33988be261560b0bd4e078a487e6dc9abcc15d33","103b83e858fdc54cd6009d46e429fcfb479b9812","aacd7a194369ed1ee48fb171c58bbb47f1e47fa9","2a17e3eab7bb9de7470c0782b4bbf2617db92a9b","afafcc47c61c09a352ef9d449a8b39322ca2533b","fdf4c1a0af819ce71c2bace3845d0d0f605226b9","e513382c81014483bd77bbbbfe21212812decc49","fecd50aee662785f10cdc9c5e87240c592064193","bbf676ad1f66baad8090272d4f5138ba41273e94","ae229e341a10c6a4fc1ece2c40a68ec4c7446ad8","d2ed897f0e280aa23b5140a485ec0ae98e3377a1","363b87d982a613a635e9cc76c946dd3a06f42b00","931360227abc50e5328fe272765ea7ad803c4743","0f2bf8dc40850c8620db0e4e1c150d3b3578b88f","2cebb78db45a38ae7d68ccc38457d155f440efbb","edbc55889450847b7e60859eda5478359f805e38","bdbe5e9470ad01b373d277d15f133e4cf053875e","d853d8f3326e10187a4136792d6585584f03d80e","0c4b73a1b5993f1ababb55fbdeeeef2d25a2736a","6e1c4b3009c1895dbc14f01b262fad766446a459","7d4edeafc71339bfe8b49fa18ca3429729e9039c","02b958ce10343064826cc395d153409d47942aac","5948f77a6dc7644733f163e6750d616636ed594e","5192ba5d00a97dbd07970d34e24bb942cbb05d18","2900b6d461119530ea501238c7dfa80673bc8107","502c9cbdc308e2097195f7999404adb2585b7489","8955c029d7c252ea7e8e45f7113f1297fba2345a","062818df142ddc24eb51a1f6dde549f5fcf6dfe2","cd6faf40cc874274e957882ae7d649e885da8fd8","69532ea29d87af20f10ef98ae423886a15a40e3a","5d08ff021391b281749c9e248e0392070571e194","e5f90848159cd20829df35ab902fef6a17b32f5c","e9b4413041ae4dbef2b135e04d5c9e8cf3c9e78c","79afcb8f59a590179d584f0deac93db4aefe6d44","69a54887ed42a379de6444c09344a9cf79e16166","176f6509cf55897ca6c373dca175138d85f045bd","9eebfd5f4026bd5b517ec193649f033f1327cfc6","15dbd1f1c59eefcc2eae9be5cdfe4b80e3bd3489","b3246ae0302a357b9fd31cc56e8b1dd6e4488f66","fd44af240591615a0d3d5d35f9bac7caf5aae5b0","938f99373d3a14ad5bf22329442dcc1b16338e7b","6cd7808ddd518edc0b2dbb7662e500c22aa57d98","4a7b42c550c7d23cef5f826c0633e588e72c7284","85a0cd96a36375be5964af7ec5b215fac166e784","1af50218e370ed6a6045eaaed7eb81710e645f84","33dae78ecceaa207f732e560d71b622e02b83fc1","3ca999e9dce323c5bc16894ae33f69fe2ad9334f","48303de57e217094095bbc1edd104d1dbb479de7","05d05137ac6f9c78f4da662037b14e8ac9e24f28","816baa2c128c610f9125716b3165abc96e0fdf94","859d46eaf645b149a06ad035efc06a7d447a15bf","9c19f65a5bdfe30fe4891165071103cede1b9b08","e43be0fbe83355d7402865336b3f34c0771a5bdb","ecfa0452164fc39e6b1d63b7e298e1b74582ef8e","eb5d428845b6d68f285242cd06aeb86dc4232a72","4cb0e0ff7c94a350961b991b1d3bbb3dd99fa69a","865a8e37f982169cdc69c5b5620a0cfde8941356","9a6a49293cb43bf20ba2b3708191ec53fc3d20e9","9acb93a2d1b199769503d2d808dd81d2976a18c1","38007802678724e74d8f3f79522c712be18cf348","5371b05fd3b63f65007306044d8e268e83f8f669","a1c090be463e3dde5d25e822187f3048df44698e","e2b7c981beca68318e04ae2577fb3ad5b83d1cb6","6caab0765146458f923c96dc9b3f24b04d859f26","c8764c3479faebecdf0ae4f0375d66ca03b55dc1","30cd7c415186eb0bcb7ca33dc73c56be3e10cad3","f259afd9505d77db66459c1cc6984da0e9e4e87c","c07def3b0d5d0e7d5f08e2f713c58d64a1d2f8d7"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.ee.ucr.edu/~yhua/Printed%20paper%20for%20IEEE%20SPL%20Dec%202012.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1109/L

Method : Acute renal failure (ARF) was defined as a decrease of more than 25% of the clearance of creatinine (Cl Cr) calculated with MDRD method within four days following implantation. Results : We considered 141 patients referred for CRT implantation: male: 79%, mean age: 68 +/−12, diabetes: 71%, HTA: 38%, Cl Cr: 48 mL +/−19, median contrast dose: 48 mL (IR: 30/80), median BNP variation: −30% (IR:-58/-8), Haemoglobin (Hb) variation: −6.3% +/−11.2. ARF occurred in 19 patients (13.5%), 3 of them died and one was lost. Renal function of 14 out of the 15 remaining completely recovered. In-hospital stay longer than 10 days was more frequent in ARF group (OR = 5.18, p Decrease of Hb was the only independent factor of ARF with a negative correlation (OR = 0.94, p  Treatment with ACEI (OR = 6.13, p = 0.09) and HTA (OR = 2.62, p = 0.06) tend to be positively associated with ARF while a contrast dose above 80 mL tends to be negatively associated (OR = 0.24, p = 0.08). High dose of contrast administration was associated with low Cl Cr (spearman correlation coefficient = −0.19, p  Conclusion : Acute renal failure is a frequent and severe complication after CRT implantation. Careful pre and post implantation management is required. Mechanism seems more complex than a contrast induced nephropathy.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"176 Renal failure after CRT implantation: more than a contrast nephropathy","doi":"10.1016/S1878-6480(11)70178-1","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/S1878-6480%2811%2970178-1","venue":""}

Processing is performed (real time or offline) to extract the estimate of the medium characteristics (dynamic and spatially dependent impulse response or frequency transfer function). In both acoustic and radio media applications, this is mostly performed using a correlation process/matched filter (receiver correlates with known emitted signal). The probe signal thus needs to have good autocorrelation properties (the perfect autocorrelation function (AFC) is a Dirac delta impulse function). However, maximum length sequences (ML) are mostly used due to the easy use of binary modulation in RF HW (ML sequences only have one peak and the rest of the AFC is just a ‘correlation noise-floor’ the level of which is inversely proportional to the length of the sequence).","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://kom.aau.dk/~pe/education/projects/2007-10sem-SDR/SDR10-ASPI10%20tertiary%20sequence.pdf"],"title":"SDR 10 / ASPI 10 : Generator & modulator for perfect autocorrelation sequences Contact","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

The aims of this study were to determine the level of stress and intensity of LBP, to examine the association between stress and intensity of LBP, and to determine which kinds of stress was able to predict the intensity of LBP among 223 nursing students in Thailand. A self-reported questionnaire which was confirmed for quality and that was composed of individual data, stress, and intensity of LBP during the previous seven days, was used for collecting the data. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and Pearson’s product correlation and stepwise multiple regression analysis. The results revealed that nursing students experienced stress at a moderate level (Mean = 2.91, S.D. = 0.54) and had intensity of LBP at a mildly moderate level (Mean = 3.47, S.D. = 1.66). The participants’ self-perceived health status and relationship with teachers was able to predict the intensity of LBP among the nursing students at a percentage of 8.4 (p<.05).

We sought to determine whether the institution of a hospital-wide alcohol-based hand rub (ABHR) policy was associated with an increase in the incidence and/or severity of health care facility-onset, health care facility-associated C difficile diarrhea (CDAD).\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe used a retrospective chart review analysis to compare incidence rates of CDAD before and after implementation of the ABHR policy. We also compared rates of sepsis, colectomy, and death in patients with CDAD before and after implementation of the ABHR policy.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe incidence rate of CDAD was 3.98 per 10,000 patient-days after implementation of the ABHR policy, compared with 4.96 per 10,000 patient-days before implementation (P = .0036). The crude mortality rate in patients diagnosed with CDAD was 10.7% after implementation, compared with 13.3% before implementation (P = .275). The rate of sepsis in patients diagnosed with CDAD was 19.6% after implementation, compared with 5.2% before implementation (P < .0001).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nOur data provide no evidence of an increased CDAD rate after implementation of an ABHR policy at our institution. The rate of sepsis in patients diagnosed with CDAD did rise, indicating increased severity of illness in patients with C difficile infection.","inCitations":["104878bebf60fe1b00635745501ff042e2b33ba0","66dc03cf26a38020f04f17e6756bd2dbf2e50cd6","d1426d5f4df3290d9d411ac8188a609b6b929123","3f0ccd896a2e6704fec9a0207df79d92be7fa239","303ca41cf5962a8aabd22e13be74a51c042d33db","6e5b23b05eb8d724866ba7b3f4f07a43976df9d0","3ec48406d68211c24c0077383ee84aff063f5e33","27849b73761ac67841841b5dc77bf0b5bdf03bb9","d6ec36cced7c15c273adceb5a2c5eb5bc70a984c","8f4ac3cbb85b34e00c8a47a0193f1803654a0cef","9ab7c94a4272f53ea4b34071b0b8d393a07f256a","ed73e387ee8a71665032d34d16b0deaa1cec50c9","45f6e07add5b343c7a31d1fa20acae123d5db3fe","dc99d4d1ee310a9bceafeb1f092da8770aa1aed4"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Clostridium difficile colitis: a retrospective study of incidence and severity before and after institution of an alcohol-based hand rub policy.","doi":"10.1016/j.ajic.2009.12.008","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajic.2009.12.008","venue":"American journal of infection control"}

Hyperphosphorylation of neurofilaments and of the microtubule-associated proteins tau and MAP2 was associated with their redistribution from the axonal compartment into the cell bodies of large projection neurones where they appeared as paired helical filament (PHF)-like immunoreactivity. Astrocytes showed a dramatic increase in APP immunoreactivity and changed their appearance to a stellate shape with long processes. The results demonstrate that abnormal tau phosphorylation and changes in the expression and/or metabolism of APP can be induced in vivo by altering protein phosphorylation. The present experimental paradigm might, therefore, provide a useful tool to model early steps of the pathomechanism of Alzheimer's disease.","inCitations":["af748631dcb5252364036feaf74991e4d66ffbbf","533322052f7593379cc22834eba86503a8f8e7e2","9619aebb6b044a3343e948e7906bf07faa60450b","c5bb81e872d94b37e403323ad1bda2e8bab42dc0","dcb7e9209cbece4359a780b9e958625805ad55a9","675f80afc1fd96d6c3fa91ef4e4267c62be2e31a"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"In vivo phosphorylation in the rat basal nucleus induces PHF-like and APP immunoreactivity.","doi":"10.1097/00001756-199406000-00027","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1097/00001756-199406000-00027","venue":"Neuroreport"}

The most frequently mentioned sources of frustration to the physicians were the \"excess work, responsibility, demands and expectations by patients and community.\" The physicians were more reluctant to criticize the care received by the residents of their communities than they were to criticize the care that patients received in other rural areas. Suggestions made by the physicians for improving medical care in rural Washington focused on ways to increase the number of resources used to produce medical care, rather than on structural changes in the way medical care is organized, delivered, and financed.","inCitations":["31bb6c4ab838ae3c118a070d3082fded96d75c60"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Opinions of rural physicians about their practices, community medical needs, and rural medical care.","doi":"","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"Public health reports"}

For the purpose of low cycle fatigue life estimation, the block of variable force was decomposed on the simple cycles. The stress-strain response at critical points, for all simple cycles, was determined using approximate Sonsino’s curve, cyclic stress-strain curve and Masing’s curve.

To help increase the number of women in computer science, we held a coding camp for middle and high school girls and offered three topics to choose from.

Reevaluation of the enzyme structure revealed the presence of two different subunits with molecular masses of 80 and 18.5 kDa. The subunits are arranged in an alpha 2 beta subunit structure. We have cloned and sequenced a 2.7 kb segment of DNA containing the genes for the alpha and beta subunits, which we designate aprA and aprB, respectively. The two genes are separated by 17 bp and localized in the order aprBA. While a putative promoter could not be identified in the vicinity of aprBA a probable termination signal was found just downstream of the translation stop codon of aprA. The codon usage for aprBA shows strong preferences for G and C in the third codon position. aprA encodes a 73.3 kDa polypeptide, which shows significant overall similarities with the flavoprotein subunits of the succinate dehydrogenases from Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis and the corresponding flavoprotein of E. coli fumarate reductase. Part of the homologous peptide stretches could be assigned to domains that are involved in the binding of the substrate or of the FAD prosthetic group. aprB encodes a 17.1 kDa polypeptide representing an iron-sulphur protein, seven cysteine residues of which are arranged in two clusters typical of ligands of the iron-sulphur centres in ([Fe3S4][Fe4S4]) 7-Fe ferredoxins.","inCitations":["3e4cfb4bee4af3c543005526582a92c1fbdd5bf4","db5effa1a2c97a73ed1f2e938fd5a3438add2b8f","b5c8b42e6837a000cf44e32112375e84c7e16c01","0db70061ec1fd0e9b2de9732b28b59bee8fdf72b","baccbaa85871caa6ca0d232af0c3b794f759b52d","6a3bfaced5e7f72eda7150e2d25d1d60b5b7063d","606ff750fc3832e6ffbf11855afc37b648edf278","158ce167ee4463bcc86ec8e9868a49f2cd41fea0","fdb8f3848b75ca35141975869318441aa1c3d4a1","e2eb854424298824debb51b70f11d2c85c314014","686e71b211b941808c3702aa74b56c4bee203fdb","f0f26957bfbdd7f097a7c2bd59dec842cb38e08d","f8c552c98d000ddde9fd7a117e30c7440407c1b7","3823c32d28472f16cf4985fb49f052af0db348e9","dccacda2c81b375e0f00938c85c2867992f052be","cc44608c3ab8637dbb729e054c0c5b845035ffc6","55025d3fd4c2b708cb787d7bc9c33a56d466952e","913f36c4353f5f081821f9fc1624d0abdbb1a6cf"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Adenylylsulphate reductase from the sulphate-reducing archaeon Archaeoglobus fulgidus: cloning and characterization of the genes and comparison of the enzyme with other iron-sulphur flavoproteins.","doi":"10.1099/00221287-140-6-1273","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1099/00221287-140-6-1273","venue":"Microbiology"}
