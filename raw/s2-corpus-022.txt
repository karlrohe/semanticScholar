Causes of the decline have not been identified, but predation by coyotes (Canis latrans), mountain lions (Puma concolor), and wolves (Canis lupus) has been proposed as one of many factors. We reviewed results of published studies conducted since the mid-1970s concerning predator-deer relationships to determine whether predation could be a factor in the apparent deer population declines and whether there was evidence that predator control could be a viable management tool to restore deer populations. We reviewed 17 published studies concerning mule deer. We found only 4 published studies of the effects of predation on black-tailed deer. A larger database existed for white-tailed deer (0. virginianus), with 19 studies examining effects of predation on white-tailed deer. Study results were confounded by numerous factors. A deer population's relationship to habitat carrying capacity was crucial to the impacts of predation. Deer populations at or near carrying capacity did not respond to predator removal experiments. When deer populations appeared limited by predation and such populations were well below forage carrying capacity, deer mortality was reduced significantly when predator populations were reduced. Only one study, however, demonstrated that deer population increases resulted in greater harvests, although considerable data indicated that wolf control resulted in greater harvests of moose (Alces alces) and caribou (Rangifer tarandus). The most convincing evidence for deer population increases occurred when small enclosures (2-39 km2) were used. Our review suggests that predation by coyotes, mountain lions, or wolves may be a significant mortality factor in some areas under certain conditions. Relation to habitat carrying capacity, weather, human use patterns, number and type of predator species, and habitat alterations all affect predator-prey relationships. Only through intensive radiotelemetry and manipulative studies can predation be identified as a major limiting factor. When it is identified, deer managers face crucial decisions.

Wildlife Society Bulletin 2001, 29(1):99-115 Peer edited 100 Wildlife Society Bulletin 2001, 29(1):99-115 Reductions in predator densities have occurred only on relatively small study areas (2-180 km2) where predators were identified as a major limiting factor and deer populations were well below forage carrying capacity (an important criterion). Thus a problem of scale, methods used to kill predators, benefit:cost ratios, results to hunters, and public acceptance are primary considerations. Methods of predator control available to deer managers have been severely restricted and current methods may not be feasible over large areas when and if predation becomes a problem. Public acceptance of predator reduction programs is essential for predator-prey management, but may not be achievable given current public attitudes toward predators. We identified several recommendations and research needs based on our review of the literature given current social and political limitations.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://www.wafwa.org/Documents%20and%20Settings/37/Site%20Documents/Working%20Groups/Mule%20Deer/Publications2/Predator%20Realtionships%20with%20NA%20Deer.pdf","https://nrm.dfg.ca.gov/FileHandler.ashx?DocumentID=51048"],"title":"Predation DEER-PREDATOR RELATIONSHIPS 99 Deer-predator elationships : a review of recent North American studies with emphasis on mule and black-tailed deer","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

In this study, a detailed investigation of the urbanization impacts on runoff regimes is provided by using multiple runoff metrics and with consideration of landuse dynamics. A catchment hydrological model is modified by coupling a simplified flow routing module of the urban drainage system and landuse dynamics to improve long-term urban runoff simulations. Moreover, multivariate statistical approach is adopted to mine the spatial variations of runoff metrics so as to further identify critical impact factors of landuse changes. The Qing River catchment as a peri-urban catchment in the Beijing metropolitan area is selected as our study region. Results show that: (1) the dryland agriculture is decreased from 13.9% to 1.5% of the total catchment area in the years 2000–2015, while the percentages of impervious surface, forest and grass are increased from 63.5% to 72.4%, 13.5% to 16.6% and 5.1% to 6.5%, respectively. The most dramatic landuse changes occur in the middle and downstream regions; (2) The combined landuse changes do not alter the average flow metrics obviously at the catchment outlet, but slightly increase the high flow metrics, particularly the extreme high flows; (3) The impacts on runoff metrics in the sub-catchments are more obvious than those at the catchment outlet. For the average flow metrics, the most impacted metric is the runoff depth in the dry season (October ∼ May) with a relative change from −10.9% to 11.6%, and the critical impact factors are the impervious surface and grass. For the high flow metrics, the extreme high flow depth is increased most significantly with a relative change from −0.6% to 10.5%, and the critical impact factors are the impervious surface and dryland agriculture; (4) The runoff depth metrics in the sub-catchments are increased because of the landuse changes from dryland agriculture to impervious surface, but are decreased because of the landuse changes from dryland agriculture or impervious surface to grass or forest. The results of this study provide useful information for urban planning such as Sponge City design.","inCitations":["9a7630666465f9a03e73ffa5f9a1b081ae080182","ddf12d66caeef4d7b7376cb144ed6decc9712bce","52959c15d80d9c3e3d4610fdc31839823104156b","393db0d11cd664f2a6905b518bf8ee2d54d305b5","66dc4a1ddb47f2e75c6dc75925f0f618ce133427"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Simulation and assessment of urbanization impacts on runoff metrics: insights from landuse changes","doi":"10.1016/j.jhydrol.2018.03.031","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2018.03.031","venue":""}

The objective of this study is to map these irreversibilities in terms of entropy production for methane combustion. The numerical solution of the combustion process is conducted with the help of a Fluent 6.1.22 computer code, and the volumetric entropy production rate due to chemical reaction, viscous dissipation, and mass and heat transfer are calculated as post-processed quantities with the computed data of the reaction rates, fluid velocity, temperature and radiative intensity. This paper shows that radiative heat transfer, which is an important source of entropy production, cannot be omitted for combustion systems. The study is extended by conducting a parametric investigation to include the effects of wall emissivity, optical thickness, swirl number, and Boltzmann number on entropy production.

Social cognitive theory was employed to explore cognitive, aff ective, and behavioral changes faced by Fukushima residents in response to the stigma imposed upon them after the disaster. The study result based on in-depth interviews with residents of Shinchimachi, Fukushima, indicates that aff ectively, participants experienced a remarkable amount of fear and sadness. Cognitively, they focused on concerns about outsiders’ negative images or misinformation about Fukushima, changed priorities or values, and self-effi cacy. Behaviorally, they actively resisted the stigma while strengthening their connections and belonging to their own community. Additionally, residents felt that they were branded as polluted and contagious and attributed the creation of a Fukushima stigma to a lack of full and accurate information as well as mistrust in main information sources, including media and government. This research suggests that developing a more transparent and locally based communication and information system could mitigate the negative eff ects of self-stigma. Theoretical implications for future research and policy suggestions for crisis communications are discussed.","inCitations":["54be92d531bd95ab53a8644c5c1e113d9eccc660","547d8c663a3c0912145ff49f03ae6352f04b33ef"],"pdfUrls":["https://stars.library.ucf.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1018&context=jicrcr"],"title":"A Multidimensional Analysis of Stigma: Findings from a Qualitative Study of Fukushima Residents Following Japan’s 2011 Nuclear Disaster","doi":"10.30658/jicrcr.2.2.4","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.30658/jicrcr.2.2.4","venue":""}

The developments in z-plane electromagnetic transient analysis of the present paper seek to provide means by which this response interaction can be investigated. Representative examples of the methods in application included in the paper have been taken from an extensive series of studies relating to a very long distance transmission interconnection which supplies a load area with a high proportion of induction motor load. Saturated reactor compensators providing voltage-control functions in the primary transmission interconnection give rise to subharmonic modes. Using the modelling methods developed, the contribution of the response of dynamic loads to system subharmonic modes is investigated.

However, only a small proportion of subjects harbouring CD-related genetic risk develop the disease. Among the environmental factors that may influence CD risk, pre- and perinatal factors, delivery methods, parental lifestyle, infant feeding practices, seasonality, dietary factors, drug use, childhood infections and variability in gut microbiota are those most widely studied regarding the risk to develop CD. Although for many of these external factors the exact mechanism of action is unknown, most of them are thought to act by disrupting the intestinal barrier, facilitating contact between potential antigens and the immune system effector cells. Management of CD is relatively easy in patients with a definite diagnosis and requires a strict, lifelong, gluten-free diet. Better knowledge of environmental exposures apart from gluten can facilitate understanding of the pathogenesis of the disorder and the wide heterogeneity of its clinical spectrum. The purpose of this review is to discuss current knowledge on environmental CD risk factors, as well as possible interaction between them, on the grounds of the reliable scientific evidence available. Key messages The risk of developing CD is influenced not only by gluten ingestion but also by a number of environmental factors including childhood infections and variability in gut microbiota, pre- and perinatal factors, infant feeding practices, delivery methods, parental lifestyle, seasonality, dietary factors and drug use, acting mainly by disrupting intestinal permeability. Better knowledge of exposure to these factors can facilitate their identification, and subsequent elimination, in the individual patient.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Coeliac disease: beyond genetic susceptibility and gluten.

Several supplementation programmes are administered through primary health clinics (PHC).

A majority of mothers complained about poor information related to the programmes. More than half of the children who were eligible for NSP were not included. In contrast, the staff felt that they managed both programmes well and problems with implementation were mostly attributed to clients.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn general, the mothers expressed more dissatisfaction and ignorance about the vitamin A programme and the NSP than was perceived by the staff. This apparent discrepancy might, at least in part, explain why these programmes do not work optimally.","inCitations":["b81b4d4f11f5eb8957153d3ee9fb0e213f3a23ae","8180ec1137f53397146feda5f2686d4d63b70d9d","38a2c81f7a803fcd3945e18bdea4298cee204b2d","558b1668012f43abd7470612b43dd36147b0ab4f","33e9b5eb8c96712825a1a5d39ac0a74b2f4d8b3d","d124c3006db9678dd1ec681032d75f2762a016f2"],"pdfUrls":["https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/21FA33B39887279ABC0D90549BC1F03A/S1368980010003319a.pdf/diverging_opinions_of_supplementation_programmes_between_mothers_of_small_children_and_staff_at_primary_health_clinics_in_the_western_cape_province_of_south_africa.pdf"],"title":"Diverging opinions of supplementation programmes between mothers of small children and staff at primary health clinics in the Western Cape Province of South Africa.","doi":"10.1017/S1368980010003319","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1017/S1368980010003319","venue":"Public health nutrition"}

During the reconstruction of the Old Bridge, which was destroyed during the war in 1993, remnants of 2 older wooden bridges were found at the same location. Six wood and 2 charcoal samples were dated using the radiocarbon method. Wood samples with visible tree rings were taken for dendrochronological dating. The results point to several periods of construction and repairs to the bridge and the towers at each end, spanning from the 12th to 18th century. Calibrated 14C and dendrochronological ages were in good agreement. INTRODUCTION AND HISTORICAL BACKGROUND The Neretva River runs through the town of Mostar, which is the administrative and cultural center of the historical region of Herzegovina, the SE part of Bosnia and Herzegovina (Figure 1). Mostar owes its fame to its magnificent Old Bridge, which was added to UNESCO’s World Heritage List in July 2005. (The name Mostar comes from the word “most,” which means “bridge.”) 1Ruer BoškoviÊ Institute, BijeniËka cesta 54, 10000 Zagreb, Croatia. 2Corresponding author.

However, appreciable differences were found in the sensitivity of the individual tumors investigated. We therefore examined whether this might be due to a different receptor status of the cells. The IFN-sensitive cell lines RT4 and SD as well as the IFN-resistant cell line 639V were investigated with regard to their IFN receptor status. It was demonstrated that IFN receptors were present on the cell surface in all three urothelial carcinomas investigated. The number of IFN receptors calculated for the IFN-resistant cell line 639V was 4.661 per cell, whereas the IFN-sensitive cell line SD had 4.391 receptors and RT4 had 3.307 receptors. The IFN affinity of the three cell lines tested differed only slightly. Therefore IFN affinity is unlikely to account for their marked differences in IFN sensitivity.","inCitations":["6e3d2fbc846a36ebe96232a4aaaefbe135b85173","77050bf5ac7b7bda91465cb4be5e919864bd6a58","239d54f0a7d1e1cd87dbf8056e12b8e8cd1bcca1"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Interferon receptors on the surface of interferon-sensitive and interferon-resistant urothelial carcinomas","doi":"10.1007/BF00302471","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/BF00302471","venue":"Urological Research"}

The grabbing hand theory suggests that political connection demand companies to serve political and social obligation that exhaust companies’ financial resources. The purpose of this paper is to extend the previous studies by examining the role of monitoring mechanisms, specifically corporate governance mechanism and institutional ownership (IO), whether they weaken or strengthen the financial performance of PCCs in Malaysia. \n \n \n \n \nDesign/methodology/approach \n \n \n \n \nThe sample consists of all companies listed on the Main Board of Bursa Malaysia (previously known as Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange) for the year of 2004-2007. The time periods were chosen because there were no significant economic and political events that could possibly distorted the financial and non-financial data. \n \n \n \n \nFindings \n \n \n \n \nThe findings show that companies’ political connection (the presence of political figure or government representative as members of board of director) has consistently showing negative relationship with performance. The result is consistent with the grabbing hand theory that argues that companies’ connection with government would actually destroy companies’ value. The monitoring role of corporate governance as measured by the percentage of independent board members does not have any significant effect on firm’s performance. The monitoring role of corporate governance as measured by the composition of independent board members have shown a positive significant effect on the company’s performance. However the second monitoring mechanism, the percentage of institutional investors, have a tendency to weaken the company’s performance. \n \n \n \n \nOriginality/value \n \n \n \n \nThe findings of this study provide an additional understanding of the consequence of government intervention on companies’ performance. This study also highlights the role of monitoring mechanism (independence board members and IO) in strengthening or weakening the performance. The findings suggest that the proper appointment criteria for board members should be seriously considered to ensure better corporate governance structure. Therefore, the formation of the nomination committee as suggested by the current Malaysian Code of Corporate Governance play an important contribution to ensure candidates nominated as board members have proper credentials and qualifications to carry out responsibilities as board members.","inCitations":["1fea79fc51d731fdae0d3484175249206adbca51","01594ca49d40c0ccfbfd8fe4a3c0985fa0cf18e8","a978b4befa0a8a653490de6eb4d4dcabc02f7016","fa96917d0c22fe6c45e0f4e297240dbe06e68709","0e5432b97e0a8c591173e932dff498086d1a5bc8","efdb0424f64ca3c816a1f566d886d32472147342","7633a37cb4ad2780c91fe498cf13e6cdc4306a3f"],"pdfUrls":["https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/JAEE-05-2014-0021/full/pdf?title=the-role-of-monitoring-mechanisms-towards-companys-performance-evidence-from-politically-connected-companies-in-malaysia"],"title":"The role of monitoring mechanisms towards company’s performance","doi":"10.1108/JAEE-05-2014-0021","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1108/JAEE-05-2014-0021","venue":""}

For \"historic\" waste, put on the market before this date, producers are responsible for a proportion of their respective share of the market by type of equipment. For products put on the market after 13 August 2005, termed \"future\" waste, producers should finance operations related to waste from his own products.\n\nGiven the shortage of discussion in literature around practical implementation of individual responsibility, the research identifies practical steps that are needed for producers to address WEEE from private households on an individual, rather than a collective basis. Producers would like to control end-of-life costs; therefore, present emphasis is on setting up a competitive system in Member States. An issue that should be addressed is the fact that national schemes prevent individual producers free access to waste, due to established national networks.\n\nTo address this, developments in some Member States show a national clearinghouse or register is to be formed, allowing producers to set-up multiple competing consortia. Part of the task of the clearinghouse is to apply a scheduled allocation method for pick-ups on a geographical basis, and/or reconcile recycling activities performed by individual producers. Establishing this competitive system with a fair means of dividing up obligations is the aim of producers. It is also more equitable for obligations to eventually be determined by a producer's actual return share rather than present market share, due to product longevity or market saturation of the products.\n\nStimulating environmentally conscious design remains challenging in unsorted waste, as all producers share any financial benefits. Direct customer arrangements are acknowledged to provide opportunities to gain financial feedback, however, must be balanced by the cost-effectiveness of the activity.","inCitations":["fb8ae48483562bd29377f1a117afba8fcc7dbd2a"],"pdfUrls":["http://lup.lub.lu.se/luur/download?fileOId=1329200&func=downloadFile&recordOId=1329199"],"title":"Practical steps for a transition from \"historical\" to \"future\" waste systems Individual producer responsibility for the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Nerve transection induced changes in the expression of C subunit messenger RNAs and RII subunit messenger RNAs. Control facial motoneurons had a high expression of both Cα and Cβ subunit messenger RNAs, but their expression declined after axotomy. The decrease was most pronounced at postoperative week 2 and returned to basal level within postoperative week 4. In contrast, the expression of both RIIα and β subunit messenger RNAs, which were low in control facial motoneurons, was increased after axotomy. Enhancement of RII subunits messenger RNAs was apparent during postoperative weeks 1 and 3, and then returned to the basal level. RIα, β subunits messenger RNAs were strongly expressed in normal facial motoneurons, but were not clearly influenced by axotomy. These results indicate an attenuation of total PKA activity in axotomized facial motoneurons. Furthermore, such gene regulation may imply a change of the targets for PKA in facial motoneurons during the process of neurite regeneration.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/0306452294905754","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0306452294905754?dgcid=api_sd_search-api-endpoint"],"title":"Gene regulation of cyclic amp-dependent protein kinase subunits (Cα,β; RIα, β and RIIα,β) in rat facial motoneurons after nerve transection","doi":"10.1016/0306-4522(94)90575-4","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/0306-4522%2894%2990575-4","venue":"Neuroscience"}

Four groups of probabilistic parameters are determined, i.e., (1) time-dependent chloride content, (2) mean and median of corrosion initiation and repair application times, (3) percent confidence of repairs, and (4) total expected number of repairs. To achieve this, this paper proposes a computational approach and probabilistic data. The proposed approach, which combined the Latin Hypercube technique with the Crank–Nicolson-based finite difference approach, is developed for predicting probabilistic chloride diffusion in concrete with repairs by cover concrete replacement. Probabilistic data of four governing random variables (surface chloride, diffusion coefficient, concrete cover depth, and critical chloride) and six repair strategies for corrosion-free condition are introduced. Numerical assessment is then shown. From the study, it is revealed that the reduction of the amount of chloride ions at the threshold depth due to using higher depth of cover concrete repairs is better than that using higher quality of repair materials. However, the excessive depth of repairs is not always recommended due to another control factor, such as the immediate amount of chloride ions at the repair depth, cost of repairs, etc. From the sensitivity analysis, the cover depth is found to be the most important parameter in the design of chloride-attacked concrete structures to extend the corrosion initiation and repair application times and to reduce the total expected number of repairs.","inCitations":["1e9078e40ec5e91518b59c5c4663fb52d26fc101"],"pdfUrls":["http://downloads.hindawi.com/journals/ace/2018/4525646.pdf"],"title":"Probability-Based Sensitivity of Service Life of Chloride-Attacked Concrete Structures with Multiple Cover Concrete Repairs","doi":"10.1155/2018/4525646","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1155/2018%2F4525646","venue":""}

Bei akuter Herzinsuffizienz wird aktuell eher das Konzept der kardialen Entlastung verfolgt. In diesem Beitrag wird der Einsatz der unterschiedlichen Medikamente auf der Intensivstation bei akuter Herzinsuffizienz und kardiogenem Schock dargestellt. Bei akuter Herzinsuffizienz finden Katecholamine nur noch beim Übergang zum kardiogenen Schock Verwendung. Hier wird viel mehr das Therapiekonzept der ventrikulären Entlastung durch die Gabe von Diuretika, Nitraten, Levosimendan (Inodilatator) oder in Zukunft Serelaxin angestrebt.Das hämodynamische Management beim kardiogenen Schock erfolgt nach moderater Volumengabe mit Dobutamin zur Steigerung der Inotropie. Können keine ausreichenden Perfusionsdrücke erzielt werden, wird Noradrenalin gegeben. Sollte weiterhin keine suffiziente Steigerung der Herzleistung erreicht werden, kann die Gabe des Inodilatators Levosimendan erfolgen. Levosimendan ist hierbei Phosphodiesterase-Hemmern vorzuziehen. Die Maxime des hämodynamischen Managements beim kardiogenen Schock ist der passagere Einsatz der Inotropika und Vasopressoren in der geringsten notwendigen Dosis und nur solange wie notwendig. Dies bedeutet, dass kontinuierlich geprüft werden muss, ob die Dosis reduziert werden kann. Bislang gibt es keine Mortalitätsdaten, die den Nutzen eines hämodynamischen Monitorings anhand von Zielkriterien belegen – für einen sparsamen und rationalen Einsatz von Inotropika und Vasopressoren ist es aber sinnvoll.AbstractVasoactive drugs and inotropes are important in the hemodynamic management of patients with cardiogenic shock despite modest volume administration. Currently, the concept of cardiac relief is pursued in the treatment of acute heart failure. In this article we present the use of different drugs in the intensive care unit for acute heart failure and cardiogenic shock. In acute heart failure catecholamines are only used during the transition from heart failure to cardiogenic shock. Here, the therapeutic concept of ventricular unloading is more sought after. This can be achieved by the use of diuretics, nitrates, levosimendan (inodilatator), or in the future serelaxin.The hemodynamic management in cardiogenic shock occurs after moderate volume administration with dobutamine to increase inotropy. If no adequate perfusion pressures are achieved, norepinephrine can be administered as a vasopressor. If there is still no sufficient increase in cardiac output, the inodilatator levosimendan can be used. Levosimendan instead of phosphodiesterase inhibitors in this case is preferable. The maxim of hemodynamic management in cardiogenic shock is the transient use of inotropes and vasopressors in the lowest dose possible and only for as long as necessary. This means that one should continuously check whether the dose can be reduced. There are no mortality data demonstrating the utility of hemodynamic monitoring based on objective criteria—but it makes sense to use inotropes and vasopressors sparingly.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Moderne Arzneitherapie in der kardiovaskulären Intensivmedizin","doi":"10.1007/s00108-015-3717-9","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00108-015-3717-9","venue":"Der Internist"}

One element which stands out is the fact that during a food crisis there is not only a surge in deaths but also a correlative temporary decline in conceptions and therefore in subsequent births nine months later. This scenario is studied in three cases of large-scale food crises: Finland (1868), India (1867–1907 and 1942–1944), China (1960–1961). It turns out that between the regional amplitudes of death spikes on one hand and the amplitudes of birth troughs on the other hand there is a power law relationship. This confirms the same phenomenon already observed in the wake of the epidemic of 1918 in the United States (Richmond et al., 2018b). In the second part of the paper we explain and demonstrate on three case studies how this relationship can be used for the investigation of mass-mortality episodes in cases where direct death data are either uncertain, suspicious or nonexistent.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1807.05100","https://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1807.05100","https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.05100v1.pdf","http://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.05100"],"title":"The physics of large-scale food crises","doi":"10.1016/j.physa.2019.01.101","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.physa.2019.01.101","venue":""}

An elevated direct bilirubin as greater than 1.0 if the total bilirubin is less than 5.0; and greater than 20% of the total bilirubin if the total bilirubin is greater than 5.0. Unlike neonatal unconjugated (indirect) hyperbilirubinemia, which is more frequently physiologic rather than pathologic, conjugated hyperbilirubinemia should always be viewed as abnormal and should not be ignored. Early recognition of cholestasis in infants and prompt diagnosis of the underlying disorder are imperative to identify those disorders that respond to specific treatment. It is therefore recommended that any jaundiced infant have total and direct bilirubin checked at 2 to 3 weeks of age [1-7].","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Case report of infantile cholestasis with liver hemangioma","doi":"10.15406/jlrdt.2017.03.00074","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.15406/jlrdt.2017.03.00074","venue":""}

Yet, there is no currently accepted method for measuring insight in dementia. The most commonly used methods, which involve comparing patients' opinions of their level of impairment with the opinions of care givers or close family members, are subjective and require the participation of a knowledgeable informant. Here, the authors introduce a new method that allows objective quantification of an individual's awareness of their cognitive abilities and relies upon objective bedside testing.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThe authors administered several tests of everyday, real-world functions to patients with FTD (n=10) and Alzheimer's disease (AD, n=10) and to control subjects (n=10). Prior to the tasks, participants were asked to predict their performance using a percentile-based rating system. They were also asked to estimate their performance after task completion. Differences between their self-rated and actual performances were calculated.\n\n\nRESULTS\nWhereas the control group showed very little discrepancy between pretest predictions, post-task estimates and actual performance (mean difference of 3.9 percentile points for prediction/3.0 percentile points for post-task estimate), both patient groups overpredicted and overestimated their performance, with a significantly greater discrepancy for FTD (49.0/54.3 percentile points) than AD (27.2/28.3 percentile points).\n\n\nDISCUSSION\nFailures of insight and self-awareness of cognitive dysfunction can be objectively measured in dementia without the assistance of an informant, which will facilitate further study of this key component of higher cognitive functioning.","inCitations":["b2a2bfe23f215cf0e66b65ef7ab824b5e9abdb11","1551307c5c1600a9b84cff0ec0631b9b4885cb78","93fe19364ef078d80a577c6395f02445a892fb3d","aa4122670d943b80513a428c62dc41f6e9126f15","8ae96c51089f468ef2de3a8a342c7b27ca9a2d9d","59a9792a4a5ce9ce7652872a51ce2a112e051dce","dd3855013e002a4c9d05fc5af2fa6a253ec104b6","4dcb19461dc7045b6d0a257dbdbe02032863096f","c9249f2cb9eb6594075afc6c8c4296fbdb1c08d4","ec651213df6532e0321ba1136f8530da317d818b","2ec14dfaa6aa1cfd417f7c3089f50ea94c04413d","595e150bd4db2999dece041dac759ce60db8dc4b","fcef62fc5c36f039d62624db909b1b0e64936f50","71d5582fb7ee20325990a239b6f215176cd34d72","e2a6de249ddd60830faf29ca197c41863aed73d9","9f47efea6916e70ef7597a2dc4befc628559fb94","04a6901dc8e689de4ff42e64b633baaa33c287cd","602b2653897bd7bec79e9efc884de6b159842a99","96c6f0ff86b2266e1e249592b6b6b1bfc18eeb40","3889d21ac8aea438e8992932dae38f401afefd85","59a7f020a5581ab408e4f71d24ebc844ba72ea98","ab225eecd30636c98e3b2ced0641980f4154d083","f66dce74eed5b8901e1aa38edf6a80dcb03f4b2c","0019af786478eb7207209a9568eecbba07ec68ac","5dadb11b0cc52ac252463ab76dfeec53eba1acff","601b220fb23d693bd5156c6768bc136cbd9a0e3b","f393f46bd0f22d9562540c1bb421e0d432d1b064","144a520f0d32ad9ed1b9ed750d5f35c12cdb143e","d600736c1edd48020e9c548ce8d5147d5c476e66","045476968a5bf1d71d678e76ebdff95a4d61b66d","547cfa8863c0002aa2d191f4ecf0be3f4d3e72b4","bae716f1501ea5af8934012aefa6d3ef5a7b8f17","6bbfcce7457185764b2bb46c125e81568d0a8541","c4a1be7d988ad247dfb724797c8efe32dcba0b49","64e6779934b51651e388913d77c71c3d5c2af5ff","47e785ef69f8bffd3a70e0a7163b626996d37c02","09a8df41dd9eb669341cdf9fe3a0640420ce6fbb","ed89b80cd4849f1683ccdd74a6989700ace19648","3d729fa4c3f78b1b160df3db839779b1dc0ce923","e0392ba05f95a0dd0cfd36ddeb7db038ebb283de"],"pdfUrls":["http://cpb.ucsf.edu/uploads/1/3/0/4/13040429/williamson_et_al__-_2010_-_standardised_measurement_of_self-awareness_deficits_in_ftd_and_ad.pdf"],"title":"Standardised measurement of self-awareness deficits in FTD and AD.","doi":"10.1136/jnnp.2008.166041","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1136/jnnp.2008.166041","venue":"Journal of neurology, neurosurgery, and psychiatry"}

Multiple choice assessment is largely unused in social work degree courses in the UK because of associations with techniques such as guessing and rote learning, which do not correspond with deep approaches to learning. Strategies used to enhance opportunities for a deep approach to learning within the MCQ exam used in this study included certainty-based marking (CBM), enhancing the use of formative feedback and giving students responsibility for devising the MCQs. Results show that students use similar levels of deep learning when they completed a MCQ exam compared to those students who completed an essay exam. The deep learning approach for the MCQ exam was, however, less when compared to a different module that used an essay assignment. There is an increasing pressure on Higher Education to provide more robust assessment practices, and findings in this study suggest it may be time for social work tutors to reconsider the role of the MCQ format within the existing range of assessment tools.","inCitations":["e5b2b5ba9aff1035503b3e006806597e482f7f14","af09cad524048fc11324258efc38f81ac9a710f9","60e3c24739d96909724a25eed5f0ed6c195d8052","7f9c279274f4661b09c3c0f01d588e14602dc4b6"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Re-engineering the multiple choice question exam for social work","doi":"10.1080/13691457.2012.691873","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1080/13691457.2012.691873","venue":""}

The method combines a unit network model with the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) method. The unit network model was used to predict the liquid distribution at the macroscale by defining 10 distribution coefficients. The distribution coefficients were obtained based on microscale behavior of liquid distribution which was simulated in six representative elementary units by the CFD method. The VOF model was used to capture the interface between the gas phase and the liquid film. Through simulation results, three flow patterns were observed. In addition, the relatively large liquid holdup and wetting area of Winpak were elucidated. The average film thickness in REUs was also investigated. Furthermore, the liquid distribution obtained from the macroscale model indicates that the windows could mitigate the tendency of liquid flowing toward the sidewall.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Liquid Distribution and Local Hydrodynamics of Winpak: A Multiscale Method","doi":"10.1021/acs.iecr.7b04194","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.7b04194","venue":""}

Seventy-five mll1'ked bay scallops were placed in plots at a density of 2.2 scallops per mS on 20 February 1986. A month later, only 18 marked scallops were recovered; of these, 15 were found in the natural eelgrass beds. On the study site, 94% of 207 unmll1'ked naturally occurring bay scallops were found in the natural eelgrass beds. Recovery of marked adult bay scallops was not affected by the distance from the dredge island; rather densities of natural scallop populations increased with distance from the island. A second, modified survey (30 MlIl'Ch to 7 April 1986) was conducted specifically to examine the recovery of mll1'ked bay scallops: this survey again showed a high rate of loss both in the transplanted and unplanted areas. The two surveys showed that recently transplanted eelgrass meadows do not provide the same habitat functions as natural meadows for bay scallops. Stocking ofadult scallops in elIl'ly stage eelgrass transplants to enltance or restore that fishery does not appell1' to be feasible. A protrllCted period of time may pass before habitat function is returned for the bay scallops in transplanted eelgrass meadows. Results from these surveys also illustrate the need for careful consideration in the placement of dredge material in the coastal environment.","inCitations":["368bf33ea8f2cd96a0a86cb70f45b14fd79c8d8c","a4866146828e1bbb80c46feda8480280c75abc87","4deda69117dbfd476a06f3d1b7197fe0c1ffb056","3c4e6c925d3709c43bbf4b47b0951b665d2bf340","6d908ae75246d2aa5d3d4648494c5383f5313972"],"pdfUrls":["https://www.st.nmfs.noaa.gov/spo/FishBull/871/smith.pdf"],"title":"HABITAT VALUE OF NATURAL VERSUS RECENTLY TRANSPLANTED EELGRASS , ZOSTERA MARINA , FOR THE BAY SCALWp","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

They represent a real stake of territorial power for the elected representatives, especially by bringing electricity to remote villages. This system is changing tremendously due to the combined effects of the opening of the energy market and the decentralization, which results in a soaring local influence.

Although the perceived normal blood pressure values can be restored in the majority of preterm neonates by admini-stration of volume and vasopressor-inotropes, some patients will not respond even to higher doses of vasoactive medica-tions. In these neonates with so-called “vasopressor-resistant hypotension”, steroid administration is usually effective in increasing the blood pressure to the perceived normal range and decreasing vasopressor requirement. The etiology of vasopressor-resistant hypotension is thought to be a combination of transient adrenocortical insufficiency of prematurity and downregulation of the cardiovascular adrenergic receptors. In the clinical practice, hydrocortisone is used most fre-quently for the management of vasopressor-resistance. Importantly, low-dose hydrocortisone appears to improve blood pressure without compromising cardiac function or systemic perfusion in these patients. However, caution must be exer-cised when hydrocortisone is administered during the first postnatal week as significant side effects including gastrointes-tinal perforation may occur especially in infants co-exposed to indomethacin.

Die verslae van Berlynse sendelinge oor oorlogvoering tussen Tshivendasprekers \nmaak gewag van 'n paar gevalle waar die liggame van ontslape vyande \"geskend\" of \n\"onteer\" is deur, of in opdrag van die heersers van die oorwinnaars. Etlike van hierdie \nverslae beskryf ook die beweerde eet of gebruik van verwyderde liggaamsdele. Op een vlak sou 'n mens hierdie verslae eenvoudig kon verwerp. Verhale van \nkannibalisme is seker een van die uiterste vorme van die vervreemding van Afrikane \ngepleeg deur Europeers. 'n Obsessie met kulturele evolusionisme het gelei tot 'n \nteenoorstelling van die eie ontwikkelde \"beskawings\" en die \"woestheid\" of \n\"barbarisme\" van die Afrikane; van die \"lig van die beskawing\" en die \"duisternis van \ndie heidendom\". In hierdie artikel kom ek tot 'n ander gevolgtrekking. Deur middel van 'n \ngevallestudie van konflikte waaraan verskillende faksies binne die Mphaphuli-groep \ngedurende die laat negentiende eeu deelgeneem het, argumenteer ek dat die eintlike \nkwessie nie is of die gebeure beskryf in hierdie verslae \"werklik\" gebeur het nie. Dit \ngaan eerder daaroor dat die strydende partye toegelaat het, en selfs aktief gesorg het \ndaarvoor, dat die sendelinge geglo het dat kannibalisme wel plaasgevind het. Op \ngrond van hierdie benadering poog ek dan om hierdie gebeure se moontlike \nbetekenisse en waarde vir beide sendelinge en Afrikane te dekonstrueer.\nBerlin missionary accounts of warfare among Tshivenda-speakers make a number of \nreferences to cases where the bodies of fallen enemies were \"abused\" or \"defiled\" by, \nor on the orders of, the rulers of victorious factions. A number of these accounts also \ndescribe the purported consumption or use of body parts severed from the vanquished. On one level, one may simply reject these tales. Stories about cannibalism were \narguably the most extreme form of \"othering\" perpetuated by Europeans against \nAfricans. In their obsession with cultural evolutionism, they dichotomised what they \nsaw as their own developed \"civilisations\" and African \"savagery\" or \"barbarism\"; \nthe \"light of civilisation\" and the \"darkness of heathenism\". In this article, I have come to a different conclusion. By means of a case study of \nconflicts involving various factions among the people during the late nineteenth \ncentury, I argue that it does not really matter whether the events described in these \naccounts \"really\" happened or not. Rather, what is important is that the contending \nparties allowed, or even encouraged, the missionaries to believe that they did. From \nthis starting point, I attempt to deconstruct some of their possible meanings and value \nfor missionaries and Africans.","inCitations":["728fb716fc0b5d4b0bc85c541fb93f957fe7a5bc"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Consuming Christianity : deconstructing missionary accounts of cannibalism in Vendaland in the late nineteenth century","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

The first presupposition is separation of ought and is, which provides a logical formulation of the separation of freedom and nature. Kant might well have settled on the view that the separation between nature and freedom cannot be bridged. Why did Kant attempt to overcome said separation? The second presupposition of Kant’s project to bridge nature and freedom involves an ought→can inference, stating that moral obligation implies the possibility of its fulfillment. There are at least two ways this inference can be understood. There is a weak sense of the inference, stating that no one is obliged to do the impossible. There is also a very strong sense of the inference, stating that if a moral obligation is found to obtain, it must then be possible to fulfill it. Kant interprets the ought→can inference in this strong as well as in the weak sense. Nature, the law-governed totality of what exists, must be understood as able to provide a suitable field for moral realization. The isomorphism between the lawfulness of nature and that of moral freedom animate Kant’s account of moral judgment, and will provide the main focus of the current investigation. Kant conceives of nature and freedom as twin kingdoms, thus providing a theoretical model validating this ought→can inference. The weaker sense of this ought→can inference does justice to moral judgment without requiring the awesome task of bridging nature and freedom. Why, then, should we maintain the strong ought→can inference in our post-Kantian situation? I suggest that Kant’s insistence on the strong ought→can inference may yield an ethical approach to the ever more powerful ways in which human beings technologically transform nature, including human nature itself.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://cosmosandhistory.org/index.php/journal/article/viewFile/13/25"],"title":"The Freedom to Design Nature: Kant's Strong Ought→Can Inference in 21st Century Perspective","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Speech intelligibility, perception of melody, and identification of source characteristics (e.g., speaker gender or musical timbre) depend on spectrotemporal modulations but can be surprisingly robust to drastic spectral and temporal degradations. We systematically explored which restricted spectral and temporal modulations are essential to the perception of complex sounds. Degraded sentences and musical sounds were obtained by a novel modulation filtering procedure performed on the sound spectrogram. Temporal modulation filtering smeared the amplitude envelope by removing changes above particular Hz.

The purpose of this small scale clinical study was to validate the usability of MEMS accelerometer based bedsensor for detection of AFib. A Murata accelerometer based ballistocardiogram bedsensor was attached under the hospital bed magnetically and measurement data was recorded from 20 AFib patients and 15 healthy volunteers, mainly females. The recording time was up 30 minutes. The sensor built-in algorithms automatically extracted features such as heart rate (HR), heart rate variability (HRV), relative stroke volume (SVOL), signal strength (SS) and whether the patient is in bed or not. We calculated median values for each feature HR, HRV, SVOL and SS, and investigated whether it is possible to separate AFib from healthy with these features or their combinations. Areas under the curve (AUC) were 0.98 for full length signals and 0.85 for 3 min signal segments using random forest (RF) classifier corresponding to sensitivity and specificity of 100% and 93.3% for full length signals and 90% and 80% for 3 min signals. We conclude, that based on our pilot results, the Murata bedsensor is able to detect AFib, and seems to be a promising technology for long-term monitoring of AFib at home settings as it requires only one-time installation and operational time can be up to years and even tens of years.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://www.cinc.org/archives/2019/pdf/CinC2019-320.pdf"],"title":"Atrial Fibrillation Detection Using MEMS Accelerometer Based Bedsensor","doi":"10.23919/CinC49843.2019.9005865","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.23919/CinC49843.2019.9005865","venue":"2019 Computing in Cardiology (CinC)"}

Nevertheless, the components involved in Ca2+ homeostasis have not yet been fully characterized in plants. In the last years there has been growing interest in identifying the plant counterparts of animal Ca2+ buffering proteins within intracellular Ca2+ storage pools. Evidence is accumulating for the expression of calreticulin as the main ER resident Ca2+ binding protein in higher plants. The fundamental role of this protein, involved in many cellular processes, is presented here in light of the latest findings obtained in animal cells.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Ca2+ homeostasis in plant cells: intracellular Ca2+ stores and Ca2+ binding proteins","doi":"10.1080/11263509609439488","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1080/11263509609439488","venue":""}
