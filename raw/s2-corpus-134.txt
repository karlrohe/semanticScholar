An experimental setup consisting of a cast iron cylinder and a tube running through its center was fabricated and tested. The experimental data were compared with the theoretical model. It was observed that the contact resistance between the cast iron and the tube plays a dominant role in extracting the heat. An approximate contact resistance prediction was obtained by assuming the resistance due to the air gap modulated by a correction factor, which accounts for the contacting surface area. Based on the results from the experimental setup and theoretical modeling a prototype storage water heater using cast iron blocks as the storage material was designed, fabricated and tested.","inCitations":["36727f3519ae52ca358e4b4817f57de5e55b85ce","7190100313c1d268ee2cd9704a9e0e1b5aad10ef","a9d5df3ca23f88c7b6f62a346e79397caeebd456"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Heat transfer characteristics of a high temperature sensible heat storage water heater using cast iron as a storage material","doi":"10.1109/IECEC.1996.553454","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IECEC.1996.553454","venue":"IECEC 96.

Therefore, the objective was to document the effects of timber harvest and herbivory on nutritional quality and botanical composition of steer diets in grand fir (Abies grandis [Dougl. ex D. Don] Lindl.) and ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa P. & C. Lawson) forests. Three replicated grand fir sites were arranged as a split-plot design; timber harvest treatments—1) no harvest (CON), 2) thinning (TH), 3) clearcut (CL)—were whole plots, and herbivory treatments—1) large ungulate grazing (Graze), 2) wild ungulate grazing (CExc), and 3) exclusion of large ungulate grazing (TExc)—were the subplots. Three replicated ponderosa pine sites were arranged as a split-plot design; timber harvest treatments—1) CON and 2) TH—were whole plots, and herbivory treatments—1) GR, 2) BG, and 3) EX—were subplots. Diet samples were collected in June and August of 2001 and 2002. Crude protein, in vitro organic matter digestibility, acid detergent fiber, and neutral detergent fiber of the diets were only affected by season of use and were higher (P < 0.05) quality during the June grazing period. Botanical composition of diets was determined with the use of microhistological analysis of ruminal masticate. Within grand fir sites, graminoids were the major constituent in the diet (65%–91%), forbs intermediate (8%–31%), and shrubs least (0.2%–3.5%). Within ponderosa pine sites graminoids were the major constituent in the diet (83%–88%), forbs intermediate (10%–14%), and shrubs least (2%–3%). Season of use did not affect (P > 0.10) botanical composition in either grand fir or ponderosa pine sites. Timing of grazing had a greater influence on diet quality; however, previous herbivory and(or) timber harvest had a greater influence on composition of diets than did timing of grazing.","inCitations":["adf184ff2f7a309febdd1775b3eece32304a8195","fc8f1a31a7a8470f92cb2ba61e97d1ba256fce59"],"pdfUrls":["https://journals.uair.arizona.edu/index.php/jrm/article/download/19744/19370","https://naldc.nal.usda.gov/naldc/download.xhtml?content=PDF&id=14991"],"title":"Influence of Forest Management and Previous Herbivory on Cattle Diets","doi":"10.2111/05-223R3.1","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.2111/05-223R3.1","venue":""}

In contrast, the normal photoreactivation rate is observed if the irradiated bacteria are photoreactivated before phage infection. The decrease of the photoreactivation ratc is understood as a competing effect of the u.v. lesions in the bacterial nucleic acids for the photoreactivation enzyme. This competitive inhibition can be diminished not only by photoreactivation of the bacteria before phage infection but also by hostcell reactivation of the u.v. lesions in the bacterium. The results provide strong evidence that hostcell reactivation and photoreactivation revert the same u.v. photoproducts in bacterial nucleic acids.

It is a quantity to measure the transmission lines security level. Placing of large scale distributed generation (DGs) units can be a key technique to alleviate line congestion, hence enhance the transmission line congestion margin, and grid security levels. However, the influence of DG integration on line congestion margin is effective at locations where transmission lines operate near to their maximum capacity. In addition, determining the required penetration level of DG (DG size) is crucial for maximizing the DG system support benefits in transmission system. A two stage approach is presented in this paper for optimal integration of large-scale wind DG for improving line congestion risk based on the congestion margin level. In stage one, a probabilistic approach is developed to predict lines with the highest probability to be congested considering the uncertainty of the line congestion margin. Once lines with a highest risk to be congested are determined at the end of the first stage, the result from stage one is employed to place DG at the node bus to which the predicted most congested line is delivering power. A Mixed Integer Linear Programing (MILP) optimization model is developed in the second stage to determine the optimal DG penetration level (DG size) for improving transmission line congestion margin considering transmission line investment deferral.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2965157"],"title":"Optimal Wind DG Integration for Security Risk-Based Line Overload Enhancement: A Two Stage Approach","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2965157","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2965157","venue":"IEEE Access"}

Previous research has shown that healthcare utilization and costs differ in women US Veterans Health Administration (VA) patients compared to men. However, none have accounted for the potential effects of clustering on their estimates of healthcare utilization. US Women Veterans are more likely to serve in specific military branches (e.g. Army), components (e.g. National Guard), and ranks (e.g. officer) than men. These factors may confer different risk and protection that can affect subsequent healthcare needs. Our study investigates the effects of accounting for the hierarchical structure of data on estimates of the association between gender and VA healthcare utilization. The sample consisted of data on 406,406 Veterans obtained from VA's Operation Enduring Freedom/Operation Iraqi Freedom roster provided by Defense Manpower Data Center - Contingency Tracking System Deployment File. We compared three statistical models, ordinary, fixed and random effects hierarchical logistic regression, in order to assess the association of gender with healthcare utilization, controlling for branch of service, component, rank, age, race, and marital status. Gender was associated with utilization in ordinary logistic and, but not in fixed effects hierarchical logistic or random effects hierarchical logistic regression models. This point out that incomplete inference could be drawn by ignoring the military structure that may influence combat exposure and subsequent healthcare needs. Researchers should consider modeling VA data using methods that account for the potential clustering effect of hierarchy.","inCitations":["4b712dcb94b443fcf59e95c5502a88ff3ea7523d","e9992886aa5b26089b5b8da7aed4c366a80d9efb","dfe20070cf174477da15f9d6961ba76169bbb114","dff960ea4cd5d5d07ec7ce82eedf466b1b91f8fa"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.lifescienceglobal.com/pms/index.php/ijsmr/article/download/1106/612"],"title":"Accounting for the Hierarchical Structure in Veterans Health Administration Data: Differences in Healthcare Utilization between Men and Women Veterans.","doi":"10.6000/1929-6029.2013.02.02.03","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.6000/1929-6029.2013.02.02.03","venue":"International journal of statistics in medical research"}

The algorithms are implemented by forming an approximation to the gradient at each iteration that is based on the function measurements. Such algorithms have the advantage of not requiring detailed modeling information describing the relationship between the parameters to be optimized and the objective function. To properly cope with the noise that generally occurs in the measurements, these algorithms are best placed within a stochastic approximation framework. This paper discusses some of the main contributions to this class of algorithms, beginning in the early 1950s and progressing until now.","inCitations":["ca7c46cb85b5b3c05ac2d1de263e60037ef450ab"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Developments in Stochastic Optimization Algorithms with Gradient Approximations Based on Function Measurements","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

It has been reported that RIPK3 (receptor interacting protein kinase 3) activates MLKL (mixed lineage kinase domain-like) to cause cell death that requires dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1), because survival was increased in cells depleted of Drp1 or treated with the Drp1 inhibitor mdivi-1. To analyze necroptosis in a system that does not require addition of tumor necrosis factor (TNF), we used a construct that allows RIPK3 to be induced in cells, and then dimerized via an E. coli gyrase domain fused to its carboxyl-terminus, using the dimeric gyrase binding antibiotic coumermycin. We have previously shown elsewhere that RIPK3 dimerized in this manner not only induces necroptosis but also apoptosis, which can be inhibited by the broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor Q-VD-OPh (QVD). In response to RIPK3 dimerization, wild-type mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) underwent cell death that was reduced but not completely blocked by QVD. In contrast, death upon dimerization of RIPK3 in Mlkl−/− MEFs was completely inhibited with QVD, confirming that MLKL is required for necroptosis. Similar to wild-type MEFs, most Drp1−/− MEFs died when RIPK3 was activated, even in the presence of QVD. Furthermore, overexpression of wild-type MLKL or dominant active mutants of MLKL (Q343A or S345E/S347E) caused death of wild-type and Drp1−/− MEFs that was not inhibited with QVD. These results indicate that necroptosis caused by RIPK3 requires MLKL but not Drp1.","inCitations":["2f3306d66499229ed199c4c8b7ee999aeb9880d1","e92041e50fdd84c0183eca244e30145646727c7b","65c2190c2d2c2f97e675d0a9e0ed6e03f11fc34d","9bc11689c3825aaa8c62a742a2d5e7e2f51d9e10","1a4c5db6fb9e161471728740904d251ff658acd1","986ec68a21e258f6b8a73064a5c6860bab93955a","4c655e78eb4ee57e942f3404b8274c6f1e4936b2","a962a3e24265c2e3f80036f4b84d18eccec8ee52","67c7274879503317a0691f6f689d652dc993f406","2f07608fc949041edfe44c47538ef80bbfdb5dc0","a7d773f45f22479456bfb5a32fd4374a44ce1497","8780a863d1a31fd26c2bd6158a0ccbc04a953b04","9ae5f08fc7b401db6d37e287c0e719746d558ea2","fb9ee2f5c39c8c50426bf33af66aa78c81bc6b25","2f0c01ef6ca3bf0c3dee2200826adf7aa21d6c8b","e0b4de160b80196ef94507e3db77c54ffe9b1ece","edba7cf2425fb4990a1913351700fa9ee81e3c04","b1eede3cab7e141dbb7db4524254170491c4b1ca","89aec0365dc563b0233bb2ffbac5e7925506adb7","49ac26add8f17d5f10e51186902e68230547d96c","968f7dd3056e84cd0494537b16e7cb182fa9893d","4193e727d45ee6f327dde0370e0b6efca4f8eba3","a2891f2da0abcb092f57b266dab457adc02db173","07eb8fd86195ab55ccbcd659afb972f999305577","4d864728ec23ce53f2f02ffdd7cca60b2633a992","13c9c84a5832d8420ec8abccc49372fa2094eef6","832622580ccf37b52a763f98e38a95986b837123","36342f394b219b6a6376532536c1c2ae11c55873","04f0a2699185cad29add96f66ef6a8899e9bb78e","fce20e92030de489ea342ca7990ad21b8a50c68a","3a5361d626a5339c1389054ce3ccb8e02406911a","697127704ee3043f19cf5f7c2bdf018a59f48892","86a5b1640eb7ac434f6c8bbeaede4cc7a0047649","114336e7012899c7e488a26598c5c615762b6b58","198291857f5790342b5aebb39a208413447edcc3","39ee30689753d373d7267671187fe6d87585a14a","63989b986d98c5acce6e33264080c5a7e05c1d1e","18da1f4714e2fbc2cbb78588fb256b17dfd9a436","27bba2d44f3e4e552db332b348a2d09a5e96f974","35cd43bd759a5ac2aa640758359b61e56250e0eb","28ae0223657a8bed1122cb8cdd37174171088630","0e517780acc58e9d4ba15d6d1d7699373d9c5030","26afe6a0cc77da589da207e6e168a74a016db9b1","8edeea62f7d6ae42fe37b0e91403151e339535dd","e96f7166c7db12cb8a2358bd2825f6a77531acc0","63e68afe39526fbc9f3669e76a4f5da2535bc277","3d315c92b8dcfd51a5c832359f6977fc204ea01c","f18fde1f0b3bf6d9272cc002a2e3fde7a19106d9","ad2ab5eed27a4036485f12ee7a35fffd39633394","80d4532c0d549e29b17d4064248e1495219178c2","9db8235ecfe1342f6919d0dca2b0eb9293406b22","17999308d2b9196c5b4bb0321ff8f652bfb47124"],"pdfUrls":["http://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/pmc/9f/32/cddis201418a.PMC3944236.pdf","https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/pmc/oa_pdf/9f/32/cddis201418a.PMC3944236.pdf"],"title":"Necroptosis induced by RIPK3 requires MLKL but not Drp1","doi":"10.1038/cddis.2014.18","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1038/cddis.2014.18","venue":"Cell Death and Disease"}

This observation confirmed by experiments allows the derivation of a simple expression for the velocity profile in the log-region. This parameterization of rough walls through u2′|w is suggested by the direct link between wall structures and ∂2u2′2∂x22. Identification of the wall structures, near smooth and different kinds of rough surfaces, demonstrates flow isotropization near rough walls, corroborated by profiles of ∂2u2′2∂x22, is depicted by visualizations of ∇2p. The relationship between the roughness function and u2′|w allows the derivation of a new kind of Moody diagram, useful in the prediction of friction factors of rough flows at high Reynolds numbers.","inCitations":["e9e707166f724f18206e49a507ba9306ef800178","dae2c49737544e776b441981c9faa169288ece3a","3f17c7bea5132ed2c04ccfb4027b97670f5a4528","37cf54cdb18877ee1628d67ac43d1608a4bb5f1d","2e494c7e84762affae4152a09b9eb47cc611ab1b","bd2c323bdb57fae1e81b0f52dd0ff8b623aaa4dd","fde86b04ce690496855f79740651902096ee9a4a","ffcaf07bc150c3b1e935ca14104070574c36eed6"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"The importance of wall-normal Reynolds stress in turbulent rough channel flows","doi":"10.1063/1.4819348","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1063/1.4819348","venue":""}

En segundo, la relacion entre la creencia en la estabilidad del sistema y el uso de argumentos esencialistas en un grupo normativo (heterosexuales) y un grupo no normativo (homosexuales) en una muestra de comunidad colombiana. Para lograrlo, se creo un diseno multifactorial de 3 (manipulacion experimental: percepcion de cambio inminente, percepcion de estabilidad y grupo control) x 2 (orientacion sexual: homosexual vs. Heterosexual), introduciendo esencialismo como variable dependiente. Los resultados sugieren que las creencias sobre la orientacion sexual se agrupan alrededor de dos dimensiones esencialistas aqui denominadas inmutabilidad y fundamentalidad. Adicionalmente, sugieren que las creencias esencialistas en la inmutabilidad predicen actitudes mas favorables hacia las personas homosexuales que las creencias esencialistas en la fundamentalidad de la orientacion sexual.

Defect solutions with boundary conditions for lines to meet at a point (crossing defect) and for lines to twist around each other (braid defect) are sought for 2, 3, 6, and 12 lines. Many results have been unexpected, including the nonexistence of a stable two- or three-line braid. This, and the high-energy cost found for a six-line braid lead us to propose that the equilibrium vortex state is not entangled below the irreversibility line of the high-{ital T}{sub {ital c}} superconductors or in a large part of the vortex-liquid phase above this line. Also, the solution for an infinite straight screw dislocation is found, and used to give a limiting form for the free-energy cost of very large braids.

Having a philosophy to music education enables students to clearly articulate the meaning of music not only in their own lives but also how this might impact on their practice as a teacher. Many philosophies and theories (Elliott, 1995; Reimer, 1970; Swanwick, 1999) as well as particular methods (see Dalcroze, Kodaly and Suzuki for example) have been developed concerning the approaches to the teaching and learning of music. This paper will draw on some of these explorations however its main focus will be on the work of Steve Dillon. It will preface the inquiry by asking Dillon's three framing questions: Where is music in my life? Where is music in the life of a child? and Where is music in the life of a school? (Dillon, 2007). Discourse around these questions will be inspired by Steve's work in schools, universities and music communities. It will also feature interview data with Steve as well as his research publications. We dedicate this paper to him in memory of his passion and commitment to music education generally, but overall compassion and keenness for music and life.","inCitations":["e5b847b8554f97c33f4f4c04201e9b7b1c756cfb"],"pdfUrls":["https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ1000248.pdf","https://research-repository.griffith.edu.au/bitstream/handle/10072/51222/84463_1.pdf?isAllowed=y&sequence=1"],"title":"Where Is Music?: A Philosophical Approach Inspired by Steve Dillon.","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

While this eases administration, it can lead to subâ€ optimal local practice This research focuses on the attitudes of a multinational's sales forces in Australia and New Zealand toward the various practices that are used to train, coach, and motivate the sales force. Scores on Hofstede's national culture dimensions, along with other criteria, suggest similarities between the countries that could lead to the expectation that similar practices will have similar effectiveness in each of the countries. However, the findings suggest that the multinational still needs to customise practices in distinct aspects of the sales system. The findings lend credence to the claim that sales practices need to be adapted to local needsâ€”despite potential temptations for transferring practices across (seemingly) like countries.","inCitations":["f434982e46f978d1ad85a1843b361cca02689187","87ec859ddc87c0331ed2e77ca79eafea8b619bb8","27cc61de98d89ee4c2cd517f04b08bdc4cbe61a1","b85fc1d57c5c54711ad2a5c85aa31bb13b70dc82","04ea963357218a2434b76f02ea02dc8f26e3c1e6","fe22d64236d80720645455283e984bfea14df91a","83a8b9d8509ca0d349b676f1c7fca588015cf4ca","94cca6ab096dbedb6eceff1795fbdcfab1adc6a0","990f47a7a9e58b0cad12d41047dc2d2c909452a8","42d9aacc95325e8754c8b43c987d6f836a6c315c","05740c1417e44d7f266a1118ef3f2e3addbf55c9"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.agsm.unsw.edu.au/eajm/9906/pdf/murphy.pdf","http://www.geocities.ws/noel_hrindia/nationalCultures.pdf"],"title":"Hofstede's National Culture as a Guide for Sales Practices Across Countries: The Case of a MNC's Sales Practices in Australia and New Zealand","doi":"10.1177/031289629902400103","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1177/031289629902400103","venue":""}

Theirs is that Africa’s underdevelopment derived from historical antecedents of colonialism.

By carefully examining the use of presidential proclamations, the authors discover that a majority of presidential proclamations involve presidential authority under congressionally delegated powers of international trade (and presidents most often use this authority to propose new trade arrangements or modify existing trade agreements), and they use this power in coordination with (but largely independent of) Congress.

The empirical analysis is based on linked public register and innovation survey data for Norway. It finds that recruitment from universities, research institutes and higher education institutions has increased the capacity of firms to generate technical inventions. Yet, the organizational knowledge bases and processing routines on which commercial innovation output depends have been strengthened only by the recruitment that has occurred from related industries. Implications for research, management and policy are drawn.","inCitations":["20eff061a16453b6487c163d5a3fe32f1adfcf33","375ab1cb3c478a297e6e70ab8a53363d08a86ffb","fae38f42c2d1f87f8cb3116a7fa1a755c5547255","1127bb5a48760c681b93d46432525ed401ffc736","7e3d478f772c88ed4e72c6962ed0d4c3c8026d46","ed3fa24b704433ae0d86757802d8224ee3b672db","6269f5f18ece43c33bb12dc8569ac64e04414d3f","bfe622358db9f78dcadf5577049b6785f04e717e","061eb06cdb9594ef0cd645c092bb7ddf0cfcb875","12a9cd1474279d15e3f90da12193bb97245b874e","af7f453ac73f6f261c7404b70480f05d84ba92a1","9869ed54047f1583cd16d1ff897807a507038247","d6825662db88554932d6266fa333d539b24057a7","6ae6dc91d35a5323547181a2afc3a94a2b2af46d","235b994f5c590e48e201997920c1eb88c251c0da","3ce41fb06d347722b4da07c72d0a22da8e8d7076","29b2e8bea2cadac0050f2c5cd8836c3c4191a335","f9f9f349d5d4a7164d03dfcb08f93706968bc1a1","b4aaca62e4dc94e3cefa0f27e3a2dcd019c785f5","69e05d89c7f076391ade8bd10827c7f41e8f393d","8389964760dbd31639471c434d02173cc8b28924","4b8c1a97b98354776bc635cf24df7c3ebaa83666","ee56223145e907ee3c9191e283c6ae1bced7a907","f8e4f39ca6b4235537cb5afc14501b76bf0b5dda","3fb4a174e2204fdcde928878023f513515cb1dfa","22b86727e0292389396037bca7e3ecef7bbbd0e2","051ff4cb5928b2579a6496c42468d51a704ee17f","0ca4c75ca7a3b4d39136cb3c4a6b684f921adc69","cfcce543d4c71bcb3be8c83fb7677f93f18bac3f","ef537e2c561b4ecfa2b8b69dda959a6450a96d4e","4dc4180264ea0f2212080bee20b3a7a5eb53c0f4"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.berndebersberger.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SGN_v05_short.pdf"],"title":"Recruitment, knowledge integration and modes of innovation","doi":"10.1016/j.respol.2014.06.007","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.respol.2014.06.007","venue":""}

Specifically, we analyse the incentives for agencies and groups to produce and reveal information during rulemaking. We show that judicial review can produce informed policymaking, but that participatory rulemaking can bias agency policymaking in favour of groups with access to the rule-making process. In addition, the model allows an analysis of doctrines of judicial review of agency policymaking. The model reveals that “politicised” judicial review can be beneficial because of its effects on agency incentives for information acquisition in policymaking. Accordingly, socially optimal judicial review may be “legally irrational” and, contrary to standard doctrines of judicial review in the United States, judicial deference to rules with thin records can be optimal.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~gailmard/gail-pat.jpp.pdf"],"title":"Participation , process and policy : the informational value of politicised judicial review","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

The objective is to help structure application ontologies in areas where specific artefacts are present - in other words, virtually any area of activity. The conceptualization relies on recent philosophical and psychological research on artefacts, having resulted in a largely consensual theoretical basis. Furthermore, this ontology of artefacts extends the foundational DOLCE ontology and supplements its axiomatization. The conceptual primitives are as follows: artificial entity, intentional production of entities, (state of) capacity, capacity to play a role in actions of a given type, function and functional object. These primitives enable artefacts in general to be characterized as intentionally and successfully produced entities, and isolate an important subclass of “technical” artefacts to which a function is ascribed. Lastly, we emphasize the novelty of this ontology by comparing it with other works with similar objectives.","inCitations":["25cca2930cb469e77a4e0bdd438e319dc7af5cc1","313eca0aecac1a975f3598889bf200dee496a546","fe4cc27503d70ed21c28479e85276de769df5dba","85d27365322df991a6913d8587a77910a874ae49","7c7457778020532cc3ecdf1a89cf395bc9560f75","3a8b453b7ae4aae5fdbf3f5566fea7946373f343","6008b93f282cfd8c8e797b36b03c0cb8a60d180d","4178541d67aeaabecd6cbf7fac328359afc98a33","b0e72a6a13f4026942945aea5533dc15b34ecdad","64ec7fe08ead0b232845bdf07374190bf85297b2","b860fa665b34a739bc2f30a07ca4236c627f9bf2","a720e0911f43c458eae6de697e9fc03237f24a78","b685ccc1676cbb129ea48566be58227050a2034b","811fa386f431ce6ef72c4c319bf2564135380fbf","5d1b8f94f82bb1097ca04fca9fd0375433af343d","62ac16432a9e1b22c5f1c040fccd632543d99259","151b462f88de84bd699bd94e1e22e6a9cf656299","1e78461742164cae821d13fb41049ae1073d804c","a5360a1bd761a4bf867076ad79ea80d5599758d3","b59fb996d7de1f7a03a94f96dd48e6996663982f","37368275f176387585e7eddd757a5fac0e880344","12d6bed22232d069b4d531eb700f44d6e9d3b49f","e79b5c0bda686d796ddb04489e4b1184e835c16f","dc81b5441b11e97fa707694b79cdd6ebe068b504","c3be823a862720873d48e5508258d9975cb95cee"],"pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.3233/AO-2010-0078"],"title":"A formal ontology of artefacts","doi":"10.3233/AO-2010-0078","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.3233/AO-2010-0078","venue":"Applied Ontology"}

Racism has been defined widely as an irrational group prejudice asserting superiority or inferiority of members of races on unwarranted groups of physical or mythical properties, such as skin color, blood, and so forth. Consider, however, the following spreading examples: Charles, a white Englishman, votes to end West Indian immigration because he finds his neighborhood transforming culturally from one of \"privacy, chamber music and bacon 'n eggs\" to that of \"public steel drum music, Jamaican food and natty dreadlocks. \" Similarly, Friedrich, a white German, votes to end migrant labor because he watched his turf changing from one of \"Wagner and schnitzel\" to \"belly dancing, shish kebab and Turkish delight.\" Both are clearly racist in their relevant beliefs and acts here.

However, in order to work as a photocatalyst, TiO2 must be dispersed onto a substrate without any binders but this still remains very difficult. We thus attempted to develop a novel TiO2 system with high photocatalytic activity. TiO2 anchored silica fibers (TAS) were prepared by chemical vapor deposition using titanium (IV) ethoxide and 1,3-butanediol. The content of TiO2 in TAS was varied from 0.5 to 5 mass%. It was observed that the surface of TAS was covered with anatase TiO2 particles 5-10 nm in diameter. TAS shows higher activity at a lower loading amount compared to P-25. Measurement of the acetaldehyde decomposition rate constant of P-25 and TAS carrying 2 mass% of titanium oxide under ultraviolet irradiation showed a value for TAS that was 1.4 times that of P-25. TAS showed a solid acidity amount higher than the P-25 in NH3-TPD measurements. It was considered that some Si species from the silica fibers migrated into the TiO2 layer by calcination, increasing the solid acidity of TAS. As a result, the adsorption of acetaldehyde increased, and the photocatalyst activity improved.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Preparation of Novel TiO2-Silica Filter Photocatalyst Derived from Titanium Alkoxy-Diolate Precursor","doi":"10.4028/www.scientific.net/KEM.617.191","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.4028/www.scientific.net%2FKEM.617.191","venue":""}

Data have been acquired from two Siemens ZLC 7500 cameras using 2'' photomultiplier tubes from two different vendors. Each PMT is individually shielded with mu-metal. Point source sensitivity and position stability were studied using 1 mm Co-57 point sources mounted within tantalum well-collimators fixed onto the crystal facing. Measured variations in sensitivity as a function of rotation were 0.35% RMS and 1.2% peak-peak. Centroid position variations were 0.27 mm RMS and 1.0 mm peak-peak. The observed sensitivity variations increased markedly (approx. =x4) if the camera was not shielded from backscatter. The position variation, however, was only weakly affected (approx. =x1.15). Pulse height stability and flood uniformity variations with orientation were studied by fixing a Co-57 flood source to the collimator and acquiring 20 million count flood images. Images corresponding to the average energy signal at each pixel (Z-map) were simultaneously recorded. The variation in regional flood count density, analyzed over 1'' x 1'' regions of interest, was comparable to that found in the point source experiments. Regional and global Z-map data varied approximately sinusoidallymore » with angle - 0.6% (RMS) and 1.7% (peak-peak). Direct measurement of the pulse height spectra versus angle yielded similar results. These data imply that variations of camera sensitivity and linearity during gantry rotation are small and relatively uniform over the detector area. Recent simulations in this laboratory indicate that ECT reconstructions are insensitive to such variations.« less","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"A study of Anger camera sensitivity and linearity as a function of spatial orientation","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Additionally, such diffusion data are of interest for understanding degassing kinetics of glasses and melts. Water and carbon dioxide, the most important volatiles in magmas, can be present in silicate melts both as unreacted (molecular) species and as dissociated species (hydroxyl groups or carbonate groups, respectively) (e.g., Holloway and Blank 1994; Kohn 2000). The contributions of the different species to the overall transport of the volatiles are difficult to separate. In the case of rhyolitic melts it was found that the diffusivity of Ar is similar to that of molecular CO2 (Watson 1994; Behrens and Zhang 2001). Assuming that this similarity is a general property for silicate melts, Nowak et al. (2004) analyzed the diffusion behavior in synthetic rhyolitic to basaltic melts and estimated the relative abundance of carbonate and molecular CO2 in the melt.\n\nKnowledge of noble gas diffusivity is also of importance for interpretation of geochemical findings both on short and on large scales. For instance, the isotopic compositions of noble gases have been extensively used to identify long-lived heterogeneities within the Earth’s mantle (Allegre et al. 1986; Graham 2002). The noble gases He, Ne and Ar are highly incompatible elements, which will be preferentially incorporated into a melt during melting of the mantle, so at partial melt fractions relevant to mid-ocean ridges a primary melt will inherit the relative noble gas abundance pattern of the mantle source (Burnard et al. 2004). Helium, on the other hand, is a geochemical tracer for mantle signatures in rocks. Measurements of both helium abundance and the 3He/4He ratios in volcanic rocks, gases and waters …","inCitations":["9c169023184df13e7292bde1ef36984673c39464","646db403bb8af720ab29b02e575a1448e260561a","f3e13cad78235a9692e55410f77dcea365e5ad70","9cd286331798efb85e83d12bafb7bb5c572cd0a4","86378e434e943dd8403324ed195ccb6f4b30a04c","cbc166fd3a330da046577f9b2f60c8bdc5b5cb02","fb43420794e3ba24b284f4ff0f6873523deff824","6f02bae1572e2e05495a4734e914f03e92684dfe","f166273414d213f883638df99896e5628db6d6d4","0b5258126d3a5764363f809685d27b6815e69c4e","ae22f641f84ae7a446fb9f4413ded39eaf144e23","45c0cc50026106d48f5247fa019089fffc328432","06fec31080551e486f83a113eedc6ddaa9a86320","dbaef12ed3d8ac25f0f6010681d259640f7c1c47","5c5448b4526a581023c958d3edd60b8ca5b8cc95","0f6666f5a39b2f50535f71a66fcc45e7f00ecb6c"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Noble Gas Diffusion in Silicate Glasses and Melts","doi":"10.2138/rmg.2010.72.6","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.2138/rmg.2010.72.6","venue":""}

This reduces the per capita ability of abundant species to reproduce, relative to less common species, and gives rare or competitively inferior species a greater chance to persist. We tested this hypothesis in a 50-ha mapped plot of tropical moist forest on Barro Colorado Island, Panama, by investigating the spatial patterns of sapling recruitment in 80 species of trees and shrubs. Two censuses of adults and saplings were carried out, in 1982 and in 1985. Recruits were defined as saplings of 1-8 cm dbh (diameter breast height) appearing in the 1985 census that were not present in 1982. The distance from each recruit to its nearest conspecific adult neighbor was measured. At various distances from adults, the number of conspecific recruits and the number of recruits of all species were tallied. The ratio of recruits of species i to all recruits was taken as an estimate of the probability that species i would occupy that site as an adult. A few species showed a significant reduction in recruitment probability close to adults, but more species showed a significant increase, and many other species showed no significant spatial pattern. Among canopy trees, about a third of the species showed some sign of local reduction in recruitment, but the distance over which the effect extended was usually less than 5 m; however, the most abundant canopy tree, Trichilia tuberculata, showed a sharp reduction in recruitment probability up to 10 m from adults. In treelets and shrubs, most species showed strong peaks in recruitment probability close to adults. Thus, most recruitment patterns did not fit the prediction of Janzen and Connell; however, two to three of the most common species may have reached densities at which a depression in local recruitment is regulating abundance.","inCitations":["5a52239056bb7fc92eecfac5c57b479e1d99ee19","6f4b9103bba712b3faa5612e51e61191eca41c01","6c14a1d8674255b0479516d0f099514475a2d126","6a69bda61355be6821328e27129e475f624d96b6","9dad580144e23a08193b204bb3b63c52e8571025","fc1a6b151d2229135498fad24fe9ffa671bf1cdb","9871c3e58e971258c0e13ac93d6851d209aa24bb","167ca74eaedcdd3ee77affb532728ce025467f6c","9d8f97349021d47301ba4888807d4831d2df27a9","b1db256bfa6c627b03ada2ceb90638d3bd3a0120","e564d72730d03ea907300d052dda6e92f829b1c2","9b0abf83c3a49c431096246bc9129d2aa95ba358","ddb9a09b4c6d807ed69dac925f1a3f6f5efe177d","d1aac441f1dfb5ce7bda95df54a8ab793f997374","1aef038eecbf89add4f37c7e32af852881dba7c9","6df773b7c8c7748eb8b2231c9ff7553c6d46388f","c066cc44e01c0829c3056e0c3546f619958c4d75","9510f2384a8965b97264579c355a2f60e0d10004","448f9108c2644f108a3ad97b9ace31e6b58af8e4","2da0c3e812dbf43fd6682467821c0f3f80318cdd","cd1fcebd5b15ee85064281c30747ceec9872902f","2a2e8b5f88bcbed5c443e22538e989c818412a27","0302a517090fe8a33963c33631ac1bd120a036e1","e4469c99e329cac9bdc570fd7877a41e04b75b14","e3802d04209109815f2bd9abf20e8e6df0620f2d","1a2ab5bca08347541b6619c1c760c4d4624ba1ea","fb80303045e0350cd6d9afeec118f83a9657daa7","8079c75126d4a3633beb90122e66edb5a3a3781d","30a4c9e9a527b3456661a39b80aa7f962c5e5d20","ef521c01525890aeb3514da395229ec2fa95b380","00924575956664d952b163493da32358524fed1c","423082bf258ad1fb9ef9636385c97a1c04000aaa","4588206cdd5e785c0174c93d8583ff90e0358fb2","d8d73132fb6ea1cd9096841cd30f86821b4455ba","b0ebff229ccd9f2202b9557df344c65225607181","f56a3589b6dfbfadd19278edf4f0dcabd613702b","a62865d4293b1d4d5444e10b12addd2a04fe960a","87093bb979e4600204581c999f8bb2a528aaa81c","92a8933cac3dce11218d0a0bfa0fc1c1607ef224","d67af60f097da15c00ace29e57c7f52491ec814b","a04afc77710d6dd4805f8e361b14a987d48f37e6","8ae24b03dc042d3e965d5cf73b52a326ecfd941a","895f16ae29f1a7e0ac598ae02d4257294e3eea04","436f44986c940ccc27eb3ba16442519bae50be1b","9d48ef02545590ee569ba3c84ad9f3c43cc60dc7","b75737dce51d5dd50884c43b0baa5071b9f79264","8b3c230ad89c09d33d6efc683b37af5beaa61491","4d5b94ee7001dd2aba636cd0eb05352a65727e60","c627981282a9880c7d3a52b6a328abc44bd29fa2","f866e6c0085ce93c89711500299fd59c9785439f","2f754719dbed5944c97d97d8da3568d869a3e075","15febcb8844c93ca5f879c74b31d41fa7e29cd23","a9eabee6fbcdecf254df8591a7c2cf2c0a1d5044","e6d198fec00bdc643ab63fe17a141d982d99999c","e14a066ea18ac29288226ab79b5e2244bbf7efcd","73109264e9b0a9d51d462a051c64bfdb17d97978","3eaa44772313e85c76e7b6f8f384a48c634f4c46","367804d7b16d1f4e48108b57d341c6d98961800d","917452af2edb0b93019c14b732d2c1dd68aeead6","b7107ad677ccea551f73fea6bd1c5c94ac1e5037","49351a234c5da5a230675be38d9d3b91fb2e0a4b","7b6ce6439f7f2a633471758e802a9e672ac05d86","bd022429c3056e20b8f4a110b6a3fee9c59e8811","518593542891e2939074cce2f44a148b946b2a3a","a3e9623bf5448c08fcb05d5215cc1c265d99e434","17e035fa963ac4e6b1875b43ebf8f3387f50f3f4","c4b3149c598b1fe0a4a5dd27ffe8dfa7160341f8","9796207c75120092078723068c0e187e93d441b3","cc3c608ce59073868f4f4b43f964437ab38267ac","9d99f4183f40a3c70119dce1eef7a11dc46faaaa","0fc0e73a35ca681698d35056c4a5aaf143dab076","61b07541733bbddcdce5027354f0120eec2b9511","1329a923f472cd1c4bdcadbd2f6ff5d3111fdc2b","bc90786acf1871843e77c4584b860e6a7b331d9f","d34f7c75e5cfda093209fcaf2a70d96383eb5440","63c11654a51fb2acd3c7e78652ddf78eb02893aa","c524d09ddc78d8f59b380bc71c3854c9629d45f1","cf8ac790e268bed5e6d65bf2417930f140176e85","53b4633d582896c5f81a66c68b4f01b9ba709464","45ca0c24aa137fd04489a407b6ee6e5a2b14f3bd","9dda49056cc357b8c56793e412fa7ee4418dde6e","2b006c4e11eff02e2dfc4845a70b4b25d3b58517","597f8922179dd59a94bd771608da756b1d20bea1","9050e7e766d3d5a4594ef24865dcbe2e0ca1672f","9bc7a207058ae18736cc2478290e7ff6048cc391","8bfdb08a6ab4d44b62e714b25d10852b141fbe22","ebd31c80267ed9dfe752d62e65ba65ad233f3c77","c3573e376dc3b2b27d5ca98288e637685f653db1","188166cc66cce0c826ce5f28edb21d78f3e3092e","d643156d2ace2498be55de1c44d61687b7614825","587060b03d826e67bea9eee131aa705c6482c37c","cdcd997fb53d32094712d0d81b0f4dc47fb64610","6eed45e24a60b9bb0d9ffe70e4fd41b94b33b3c6","f646ec826712a0ad9cb82b089ae5d0b42772b009","0e03cd6088bf251064ad27d55e8adb0833499206","e47f889e977e3e6d8623dd42a242cc55981311f7","935170b377b173aea805d6fd173db253ad6c62a3","c4739f79196c3f264779704f2edf669d5510462f","9c28ebd8c5e160d26aa50d745d5755d9952f8123","5a27e8cd758f94dde859fb4ab9be5ec1ec568382","a3cc223c13abd1c023570a36de3060e79900a34a","2739e6149dcbd00b917a850fa3afaa8b2d0884fc","4082b924d3fb6c5e45b878c808fa297d82a9c8e5","7934f5e2deec6424f48aa510b69b8ae514bd2c55","94c91c46436053f0ea05943f0c58cfe5d93527b2","03a0713d15d4e5d9a50439df26ce98d037594015","a5b521837f7dde031236fbe5134d9190624e6a87","2adc9651ba7ff55f370260a74bd09fe5468a9a0d","320dda720c6dc7b69d5f5eddbb78c5a37cab4810","d5884ba3f94d147231d2db15e1167e36e280db9b","9d28d826e7d566537557c0944234788f6f17cb36","1fccf2be129c2b30855ff45e37ed965f22cb9192","53a518ddcfc45ead91fd030dca08d9df117481c6","a20a39372400c6b1ab50748ed696655a8399e416","6c2d402aeeec952d909584ee39e2f35faa34042a","9cf31c31015a784308a723efd81

It may occur immediately after surgery or some months later, however, most cases it presents within the first 7 postoperative days. Patients report a range of pain characteristics in the absent limb, including burning, cramping, tingling and electric shock sensation. The incidence of PLP has been reported to be between 50% and 85% following amputation. Its management is notoriously difficult, with no clear consensus on optimal treatment. It is often resistant to classic balanced analgesia and typical neuropathic pain medications. Taking into account these issues, the authors aimed to improve the management of patients undergoing amputation at their institution, by ensuring accurate and holistic assessment, the selection of suitable interventions through critical analysis and synthesis of available evidence, and the appropriate evaluation and adaptation of treatment plans, to ensure patients achieved their individualised goals.","inCitations":["f05c597cfbb89b597eeb94cac39ff0d2a5e19cb4","867254f073a3a44a4f936aad02a5f280de170942"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Pain management in new amputees: a nursing perspective.","doi":"10.12968/bjon.2019.28.10.638","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.12968/bjon.2019.28.10.638","venue":"British journal of nursing"}

The typical inputs to such a process consist of a set of customer zones to serve, a set of products to be manufactured and distributed, demand projections for the different customer zones, and information about future conditions, costs (e.g. for production and transportation) and resources (e.g. capacities, available raw materials). Given the above inputs, companies have to decide where to locate new service facilities (e.g. plants, warehouses), how to allocate procurement and production activities to the variousmanufacturing facilities, and how to manage the transportation of products through the supply chain network in order to satisfy customer demands. We propose a mathematical modelling framework capturing many practical aspects of network design problems simultaneously. For problems of reasonable size we report on computational experience with standard mathematical programming software. The discussion is extended with other decisions required by many real-life applications in strategic supply chain planning. In particular, the multi-period nature of some decisions is addressed by a more comprehensivemodel, which is solved by a specially tailored heuristic approach. The numerical results suggest that the solution procedure can identify high quality solutions within reasonable computational time.","inCitations":["cd9129fce0f8bc572814f19ab1d7a14940403ce1","57295fff4a9f36af9573febca3910bf4fdb11b20","231a05897925896ca764b35e9896e29f5d9ef3d1","3df561ce08fa1de4f1ab22d5356ce9b6ee853f12","d861635e4ae133603f0de6636baa6428b4d098f8","4cbcc6108ab9083c854a16158a43263371afbc28","4650cd800bf952a37f6f50da1750affdeac7b8fb","0b9b905049396429043937075b6d0a958c784e5f"],"pdfUrls":["https://kluedo.ub.uni-kl.de/frontdoor/deliver/index/docId/1995/file/bericht140.pdf"],"title":"Network Design Decisions in Supply Chain Planning","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

The incorporation of growing atoms on the crystal surface is discussed based on a crystal surface model composed of kinks, ledges, and terraces. At temperatures higher than 1/2 Tm, kinks act as incorporation and decomposition sites for growing atoms, and the shape of the growth front step is simple and smooth. At temperatures lower than 1/2 Tm, kinks act only as pinning sites with a zigzag step.","inCitations":["bc1b5aa2ed1c984da2cfac7ed5bd3e17d968522f","1daeb68e4ca0bd439f49e0f45283565defe9b263"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Crystal growth model for molecular beam epitaxy: Role of kinks on crystal growth","doi":"10.1088/0953-8984/6/45/002","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1088/0953-8984%2F6%2F45%2F002","venue":""}
