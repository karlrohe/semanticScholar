Different cognitive functions show optimal performance at different times of the day, known as the 'time-of-day effect'. While this effect has been observed for a number of cognitive domains including declarative memory, it is presently unclear whether performance fluctuations are also seen in prospective memory, i.e. memory for intentions to be realized in the future. The present study examined time-of-day effects in four different prospective memory tasks with varying degrees of complexity, taking into account circadian preference (i.e. morningness-eveningness/chronotype) and attentional resources (in one of the tasks). In a pilot study (n = 48) and a main experiment (n = 39), prospective memory was compared between morning groups (˜09:00) and evening groups (˜21:00) of young adults. We found time-of-day effects, with better performance in the evening than in the morning, in a simple one-item prospective memory task (Red Pencil Task, p = .02), a classical event-based prospective memory task including the detection of cue syllables in a lexical decision ongoing task (Syllable Detection Task, p < .048), and a rather naturalistic complex planning task for breakfast preparation (Dresden Breakfast Task, including time-based prospective memory (p = .026) and event-based prospective memory (p = .054)). These time-of-day effects were neither modulated by circadian preference nor by attentional resources. Another simple one-item prospective memory task was not affected by time of day (Color Task, p = .14). Ongoing task performance in the Syllable Detection Task and the Dresden Breakfast Task, overall, did not differ significantly between morning and evening groups. These findings provide tentative evidence for time-of-day effects in prospective memory of young adults, with better performance in the evening hours.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166432819307417","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166432819307417?dgcid=api_sd_search-api-endpoint"],"title":"Time-of-day effects on prospective memory","doi":"10.1016/j.bbr.2019.112179","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbr.2019.112179","venue":"Behavioural Brain Research"}

It is largely associated with activity in the cores of the radio sources, is highly variable, and is strongest during ejection episodes. VLBI imaging and interstellar scintillation arguments show that the degree of circular polarization is as high a few percent in some sources, and is associated with milliarcsecond and microarcsecond source structure. The circular polarization most likely originates as a result of conversion of linear polarization in the relativistic plasma surrounding the source.

The presenting symptoms have usually been bone pain, pathologic fractures or repeating infections. In patients with multiple myeloma, amyloid depositions may be seen in the skin. This form, defined as primary systemic amyloidosis, is characterized by light-chain amyloid fibril depositions. Our case applied with multiple, asymptomatic, yellowish papules localized on the face, trunk, oral and genital mucosa, gradually increasing during the last two years. He had no complaints, except for slight weight loss. In routine tests, the patient had no pathological laboratory findings, except high C-reactive protein levels. Further research revealed histopathologic and immunohistochemical findings consistent with amyloidosis. Upon these results, immunoglobulin G levels were measured and found high, and in protein electrophoresis, IgG monoclonal gammopathy was determined. The diagnosis of multiple myeloma is made by bone marrow biopsy. This patient is presented for being an asymptomatic case diagnosed by skin findings of amyloidosis.

Similar to fungi and some other lower eukaryotes, the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi is capable of synthesizing free or protein-linked glycoinositolphospholipids containing IPC. As a first step towards understanding the importance and mechanism of IPC synthesis in T. cruzi, we investigated the effects of rustmicin and aureobasidin A on the proliferation of different life-cycle stages of the parasite. The compounds did not interfere with the axenic growth of epimastigotes, but aureobasidin A decreased the release of trypomastigotes from infected murine peritoneal macrophages and the number of intracellular amastigotes in a dose-dependent manner. We have demonstrated for the first time that all forms of T. cruzi express an IPC synthase activity that is capable of transferring inositol phosphate from phosphatidylinositol to the C-1 hydroxy group of C6-NBD-cer {6-[N-(7-nitro-2,1,3-benzoxadiazol-4-yl)-amino]hexanoylceramide} to form inositol phosphoryl-C6-NBD-cer, which was purified and characterized by its chromatographic behaviour on TLC and HPLC, sensitivity to phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C and resistance to mild alkaline hydrolysis. Unlike the Saccharomyces cerevisiae IPC synthase, the T. cruzi enzyme is stimulated by Triton X-100 but not by bivalent cations, CHAPS or fatty-acid-free BSA, and it is not inhibited by rustmicin or aureobasidin A, or the two in combination. Further studies showed that aureobasidin A has effects on macrophages independent of the infecting T. cruzi cells. These results suggest that T. cruzi synthesizes its own IPC, but by a mechanism that is not affected by rustmicin and aureobasidin A.","inCitations":["309a8805afe211b930d07385e68810dba43370a8","daf32b399f51b9ec478f3956c5f5375e3a2713fd","69361a1be42bc4bf55f9b32b29624250ee2ff393","8fba0ff9a546ab50cac16b0ff669c759870ec751","d671728c8bb8e961d66a2c384fa79d15d8e95030","566b372b91a27f46f1de05b07d0ebefe538a2d47","fdec92cad398ada46535ca85bf4fe1622daa0910","f9bec1682ef44110639ef7e12e9ce79395d0d5d5","a04fae05770416b729014f2197ce183e0f9b2218","1856eaeaa1c0fe4a3a312da271a4819740d689b9","0d5935d133f8d569e9fce0c77c278db81bd99558","2edb197d721d39ee6e9ea7d797aa18fbb5dfc9c3","b84e6901791ee799d5c219b67e27b439697afa49","b7363b23fe561924259771d9c969313841ee0003","7d0916d9241915a335e5149ed56cbe3f13709a1c","989a98fa7b0684d37bd78758a79fb5d6cb3aec1d","34797964af190c5589e9f913767f9176f65b0ec5","6636dd7bfde33750dba18c40802e55d9787caacb","2182d9153e8f296f104d167634ea6098700ce4db","d0c9cfde596c4640911688cafe4d821230ea64ae"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.biochemj.org/content/ppbiochemj/387/2/519.full.pdf"],"title":"Characterization of the inositol phosphorylceramide synthase activity from Trypanosoma cruzi.","doi":"10.1042/BJ20041842","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1042/BJ20041842","venue":"The Biochemical journal"}

Because of the unique clinical, logistic, and legal aspects of mammography, this study was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of a trigger to flag delayed follow-up on mammography.\n\n\nMETHODS\nAn algorithm was developed to detect delays in follow-up of abnormal mammographic results (>60 days for BI-RADS® 0, 4, and 5 and >7 months for BI-RADS 3) using clinical data in the electronic health record. Flagged records were then manually reviewed to determine the trigger's performance characteristics (positive and negative predictive value, sensitivity, and specificity). The frequency of delays and patient communication related to abnormal results, reasons for lack of follow-up, and whether patients were subsequently diagnosed with breast cancer were also assessed.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOf 365,686 patients seen between January 1, 2010, and May 31, 2015, the trigger identified 2,129 patients with abnormal findings on mammography, of whom it flagged 552 as having delays in follow-up. From these, review of 400 randomly selected records revealed 283 true delays (positive predictive value, 71%; 95% confidence interval, 66%-75%), including 280 records without any documented plan and three patients with plans that were not adhered to. Transcription and reporting inconsistencies were identified in 27% of externally performed mammographic reports. Only 335 records (84%) contained specific documentation that the patient was informed of the abnormal result.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nCare delays appear to continue despite federal laws requiring patient notification of mammographic results within 30 days. Clinical application of mammography-related triggers could help detect these delays.","inCitations":["d886ad6dd35ef9442354fceba16a52902c533e51","3e6ca35e3036aa537b7d8f15efa5f0f94ba8da6a","1d5a5f1a852ef3fa540736d8dfb20e47e57b9812","8d12374030002095308de8cc32df6c9c26984850"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Electronic Triggers to Identify Delays in Follow-Up of Mammography: Harnessing the Power of Big Data in Health Care.","doi":"10.1016/j.jacr.2017.10.001","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jacr.2017.10.001","venue":"Journal of the American College of Radiology : JACR"}

At pH 5, solubility was related inversely to concentration, and most products were highly soluble at the lowest concentration tested. At pH 2, metals from all products were nearly 100% soluble at all concentrations. The relationships among soluble metals and proteinaceous (ninhydrin-reactive) substances in filtrates from solubility tests were evaluated using gel filtration chromatography. Chromatographs revealed that ninhydrin reactants in all pH 5 filtrates eluted in fractions earlier than, and separately from, the fractions containing metals. Ninhydrin reactants and metals in filtrates eluted in the same general ranges of fractions as did ninhydrin reactants and metals from mixtures prepared from pure AA and atomic absorption standards. The minerals solubilized from these products apparently no longer were chelated.","inCitations":["24d6ddad29beafbb428612b38eb0d1bf626985a1","1c0016c2b0dcd8d9a51ccd72159ba44e8994275d","7992b8474e0fa7128e91ccfb08aa2b953deba635","3fe31508bbbe8e07d60eedd5a22677c4b9f58052","3cf7918c8d2d7fe6a24cfb59524bf99f219141f7","db471354d44d798077715c71d25c252c22806c78","f5132aff4e34abf647605b05fa3472ed25acaa25","c212699830840ce67ae8996d75e8bfd9873f6bfe","4fbfccd53fc38586dadc64ea2a86a14f6c627d9a","608bb286f458097078cc29a2c477e1da7f203b7a","5711c24914309deca97d4f3f505304bd1724cea4","a8bec34ea2317eacfcdb9de7b93d77aac0d1ed5f","cb05916ed426b36de00aacef8e05e6a9e5a33bfc","de66e231285c54d5dd92997690dd23e12acc2c53","0c427a7c95aefcf10e14761bd4e08e61e0f05898","2c4bfe0d0d98cfede98b53d37e18f648d8d8477b","0025ab26c3d0d7eca93eed2416335033dd2d2dbd","bf2d8c517747fefa2786e2aa13b43d9a5f06b48f"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Laboratory Evaluations of Solubility and Structural Integrity of Complexed and Chelated Trace Mineral Supplements","doi":"10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(94)76940-X","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.3168/jds.S0022-0302%2894%2976940-X","venue":""}

The following databases have been searched: MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library , Google scholar and the PubMed. The literature search date was from January 1977 until November 2013. Randomised controlled trials and retrospective studies were included. Initial search identified 420 publications. Thirty articles met the inclusion criteria of this review. The most common surgical techniques identified were full-thickness skin graft, Dermatome and linear incision techniques. The result shows that dermatome technique is associated with higher rate of skin complications when compared to linear incision and skin graft techniques. Based on the available literature, the use of a linear incision technique appears to be associated with lower skin complications; however, there is limited data available supporting this. Higher quality studies would allow a more reliable comparison between the surgical techniques.","inCitations":["dbe8e1bfe261ca38f0f6707bfcbc2f7ab75f1a52","a049580b0e32630fb0b17474005c86d6b87ee32e","b75f22529609e4efe773b48f26675ca0d3b2c1d4","f386ad433c0f7dc81ade0a9ee536853a4966efe7","2606ed9322d0d604d65395c097bfd533aeda82f1","a7beb34fb458ae1bb3bf097db40e282616bb10dc","c91337ec36db8bd3453b2b600dc2a22d2872356b","5a75dd74ca9a087d809d6f594cdb591518b5fea9","855fbcf51ea9c79db446a2b8086cd098522354b9"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"A systematic review on skin complications of bone-anchored hearing aids in relation to surgical techniques","doi":"10.1007/s00405-014-3436-1","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00405-014-3436-1","venue":"European Archives of Oto-Rhino-Laryngology"}

The delayed (q gamma) component of the charging currents appeared with a time course lasting well over 100 ms at around -50 to -40 mV, but the currents became larger and faster with further depolarization. The slow charging current was investigated using a 10 mV probe step intercepting the time course of these currents. This procedure showed that the charging currents could last as long as 100-300 ms. The total charge was conserved when the charging current was small and prolonged. The results can be related directly to earlier findings concerning contractile activation of muscle by applied voltage steps to potentials near threshold ( Adrian , Chandler & Hodgkin, 1969).","inCitations":["5e0d681156981273520dc90dd10a9c182d2573a5","20938d3dafdf297f119d99bd21e82fcdafe2a8f3","7bc8ba7e856e263d5d27cce11c6acc1821a93cb4","4298cccb7f2f52296a3757364832b33ee60979ae","df5c13652b72c8d00cd32dd5d84ca7ab29f02e27","a0e7d3f540660ca7778dcd03a1612a128f38af1f","8052623182881bde7076d85fafd251f2afb9c496","1821b83d436875a1ed4007f3a05f54a34ea2100b","2d18cdc1d862e859b56f88f5944883d4b1a4133d","7583810856efb1309d09e87fd7f77c9dde3e101a","07a5b19f45bc2e0e91e2667ffb7c75e6bd9f56c7"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Charge movements near the mechanical threshold in skeletal muscle of Rana temporaria.","doi":"10.1113/jphysiol.1984.sp015169","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1113/jphysiol.1984.sp015169","venue":"The Journal of physiology"}

This divide represents two different models resting on the different timing and nature of migration, and resulting in different policies to fight racial and ethnic discrimination in European countries. In the north – typically the United Kingdom and the Netherlands – the presence of second-generation migrants is accompanied by specific policies to deal with migration, racism and discrimination. In contrast, in the south new migration flows result in ad hoc reactive policies in the form of regulatory campaigns. Anti-racist mobilisation in the south is characterised by the presence of both a ‘weak’ state and a weak civil society. The dominant themes of mobilisation concentrate on new migrants’ primary needs: regularisation campaigns and residential status, housing problems and unemployment (Danese 1998). In the southern model, certain actors play a dominant role. Some scholars emphasise the role of Catholic church-related organisations, such as Caritas, in countries like Italy or Spain (Favell 1998).","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Fighting Denial: New Anti-Racist Mobilisation in Spain","doi":"10.1057/9781137284662_7","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1057/9781137284662_7","venue":""}

While FA has become a widely used tool to detect moderate changes in water diffusion in brain tissue, the measured value is sensitive to scan parameters (e.g. MPG-direction, signal to noise ratio, etc.). Therefore, it is paramount to address the reproducibility of DTI measurements among multiple centers. The purpose of this study was to assess the inter-center variability of FA. We studied five healthy volunteers who underwent DTI brain scanning three times at three different centers (I-III), each with a 1.5 T scanner having a different MPG-schema. Then, we compared the FA and eigenvalue from the three centers measured in seven brain regions: splenium of corpus callosum (CCs), genu of corpus callosum (CCg), putamen, posterior limb of internal capsule, cerebral peduncle, optic radiation, and middle cerebellar peduncle. At the CCs and CCg, there was a statistical difference (p<0.05) between center Iand center IIfor the same MPG-directions. Furthermore, at CCs and CCg, there was a statistical difference (p<0.05) between center II and center III for different MPG-directions. Conversely, no statistical differences were found between center I and center III for the different MPG-directions for all regions. These results indicate that the FA value was affected by the MPG-schema as well as by the MPG-directions.","inCitations":["6f8351123150ab641f262c5db41337d4b4809e00","93679de1d352abd698a6f633677d20a19a8075f0"],"pdfUrls":["https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/jjrt/68/9/68_2012_JSRT_68.9.1242/_pdf"],"title":"[Comparison of diffusion tensor imaging-derived fractional anisotropy in multiple centers for identical human subjects].","doi":"10.6009/jjrt.2012_jsrt_68.9.1242","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.6009/jjrt.2012_jsrt_68.9.1242","venue":"Nihon Hoshasen Gijutsu Gakkai zasshi"}

Despite the success of Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) in the therapy of CML, TKI-resistance remains an unsolved problem in the clinic. We have recently shown that Gab2 signalling counteracts the efficacy of four distinct Bcr-Abl inhibitors. In the course of that project, we noticed that two clinically relevant drugs, imatinib and dasatinib, provoke distinct alterations in the electrophoretic mobility of Gab2, its signalling output and protein interactions. As the signalling potential of the docking protein is highly modulated by its phosphorylation status, we set out to obtain more insights into the impact of TKIs on Gab2 phosphorylation.FindingsUsing stable isotope labelling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC)-based quantitative mass spectrometry (MS), we show now that imatinib and dasatinib provoke distinct effects on the phosphorylation status and interactome of Gab2. This study identifies several new phosphorylation sites on Gab2 and confirms many sites previously known from other experimental systems. At equimolar concentrations, dasatinib is more effective in preventing Gab2 tyrosine and serine/threonine phosphorylation than imatinib. It also affects the phosphorylation status of more residues than imatinib. In addition, we also identify novel components of the Gab2 signalling complex, such as casein kinases, stathmins and PIP1 as well as known interaction partners whose association with Gab2 is disrupted by imatinib and/or dasatinib.ConclusionsBy using MS-based proteomics, we have identified new and confirmed known phosphorylation sites and interaction partners of Gab2, which may play an important role in the regulation of this docking protein. Given the growing importance of Gab2 in several tumour entities we expect that our results will help to understand the complex regulation of Gab2 and how this docking protein can contribute to malignancy.","inCitations":["4c4c686ef1b7aaf69f33d068a6634fe96a0fd641","5a7236084513da1ee61ae9fbd7352c4d2c8f8da9","43ea3ee6a542534d5da55b9d7ef3d689c332b7fc","590dad2ae8b755633d4d2cb6d6218bbd5f710c2b","c1562e087506cb91dd407cc3716af2981ee244e9","bf81a21e330587b3db145ceba7583b2f37fe15a6","7d936643490f45824fc0696cd660f04b3682e8fe","79fd39d43e00f57efe0e477d91bd37cf88e17581","b851ed59bf384aa55db302e5b70e444434cbcc1e","45cbadebfdc3b3c931f533b1645854ece90f531a","dd58c2a0ced6cbd4dca6197cc74ed8aa52f65978"],"pdfUrls":["http://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/pmc/24/f0/1478-811X-11-30.PMC3640961.pdf","https://static-content.springer.com/esm/art:10.1186%2F1478-811X-11-30/MediaObjects/12964_2012_317_MOESM4_ESM.pdf","http://download-redirector.springer.com/redirect?contentType=pdf&ddsId=art:10.1186/1478-811X-11-30&originUrl=http://biosignaling.biomedcentral.com/article/10.1186/1478-811X-11-30"],"title":"Alterations of Gab2 signalling complexes in imatinib and dasatinib treated chronic myeloid leukaemia cells","doi":"10.1186/1478-811X-11-30","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1478-811X-11-30","venue":"Cell Communication and Signaling"}

Algorithms for this problem can be applied to task decomposition in engineering design. Connected components are maintained using a disjoint set data structure and the biconnected components are maintained by a block forest. We implemented an incremental biconnectivity algorithm presented in Westbrook and Tarjan [8] which runs in O(n log n + m) time, where n is the number of vertices and m is the number of operations. However, the algorithm in [8] does not address the issue of deletions in disjoint sets, which seem to be needed in order to implement the algorithm correctly. Hence we develop the concepts of dynamic holes and static holes to support variations of the standard disjoint set structure that allow the deletion of certain elements. We present four different implementations of the incremental biconnectivity algorithm which utilize these variants of the standard disjoint set structure, and analyze their performance. We present extensive timing information for each of these implementations. TR97-17b contains the graphs and the companion TR97-17a contains the write-up.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Experimental Evaluation and Comparisons of Algorithms for Incremental GraphBiconnectivity","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Larvae and juveniles were obtained from a aquafarm in Muan-gun, Jeolla-namdo Province, Korea. The average water temperature at the time of breeding was 23.0°C and average water salinity was 33.0 psu. Freshly hatched fish larvae had not undergone any ossification, but ossification of the parasphenoid bone, which forms the base of the cranium, occurred as the juveniles reached an average body length (BL) of 2.49 mm. At the same time, ossification of the preopercle and opercle occurred in the operculum, and ossification of the maxilla, which forms the upper jaw, and the dentary bones, which form the lower jaw, began. In addition, ossification of the vertebra occurred by formation of 7 vertebral centra and the neural spine in the abdominal vertebra. When the juveniles reached an average (BL) of 5.22 mm, ossification of the nasal, lateral ethmoid, and alisphenoid bones occurred in the cranium; ossification of the endopterygoid and metapterygoid bones began in the palatine region; and ossification of the hypohyal and interhyal bones occurred in the hyoid arch. At an average (BL) of 20.9 mm, ossification of the basisphenoid bone in the cranium and the suborbital bone in the orbital region occurred. Ossification of the vertebra then occurred by the formation of long pairs of ribs from the third to the ninth abdominal vertebrae, completing osteological development.","inCitations":["cc9a5c23c0aa71fb29e52f7f09b3185731970763","bbb099ac9afd970d0989c237963451913b990b2b","976529a14cf7307c0cf9e648d558f12c05d5c9c5","133a2f9c60ded9a45e5481dfb91e6f4fe8c8cfe8"],"pdfUrls":["https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/pmc/oa_pdf/63/a0/DR-20-87.PMC5027225.pdf","https://www.ksdb.org/download/download_pdf?pid=dr-20-2-87"],"title":"Early Osteological Development of Larvae and Juveniles in Red Spotted Grouper, Epinephelus akaara (Pisces: Serranidae)","doi":"10.12717/DR.2016.20.2.087","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.12717/DR.2016.20.2.087","venue":"Development & reproduction"}

The ILS is a valid and reliable instrument to understand leadership for evidence-based practice; however, this scale or the other similar instrument does not exist in Chinese.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe followed the translation and cross-cultural validation guideline developed by Sousa and Rojjanasrirat. Translation included two forward and blind backward translations, and their comparisons. Two rounds of cognitive interview were used to evaluate the linguistic validity.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe translation process took 12 months. In the forward and backward translations, 24 translation issues were identified, of which semantic equivalence issues were most frequent. Ten nurses participated in each round of cognitive interviews and 33 linguistic issues were found. The final Chinese ILS had seven significant adaptations to the original instrument.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThis study provided a deep understanding of using the ILS in the local context and laid the foundation for future psychometric statistical testing.\n\n\nIMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING MANAGEMENT\nImplementation leadership scale could support organisational leadership development programmes and strategies to facilitate and support EBP implementation and sustainability.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Translation and linguistic validation of the implementation leadership scale in Chinese nursing context.","doi":"10.1111/jonm.12768","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1111/jonm.12768","venue":"Journal of nursing management"}

Taking slags from grate firing (municipal waste), rotary kilns (hazardous waste incinerator plants) as well as grate sludges from a multiple hearth furnace as an example, it is being shown that the critical content of actual organic carbon, i.e. the AOC content of all these combustion residues, is always ≤ 2 to maximum 3 wt.-%, and almost independent of the overall residual carbon content. This result is so very convincing that it is possible to restrict the number of control analyses of slags (reduced laboratory expenditure), provided the combustion is effected thoroughly. The differentiated approach with special consideration of the elementary carbon has been accepted in 1997 by the Federal Ministry for the Environment, and was in the same year also incorporated into the deposition approval of the Disposal Centre of Leverkusen-Burrig of BAYER AG.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Erzielbarer Rest-Kohlenstoffgehalt in Schlacken und Aschen von Müllverbrennungsanlagen.

It alters only the sequence and the side-chain structure of the protein, leaving the protein backbone fold intact by definition. The program searches for a constellation of backbone positions arranged such that if appropriate side-chains were placed there, they would bind the ligand according to a pre-defined geometry of interaction specified by the experimentalist. These binding sites are introduced by the program by taking into account simple rules such as steric hindrance, atomic close-packing and hydrogen bond patterns, which are known to maintain the integrity of a protein structure to a first approximation. A test case is presented in this paper where the copper binding site found in blue-copper proteins such as plastocyanin, azurin and cupredoxin is introduced into Escherichia coli thioredoxin. The model building of one of the solutions found by the program is presented in some detail. The experimental construction and properties of this new protein are described in an accompanying paper. It is hoped that this program provides a general method for the design of ligand binding sites and enzyme active sites, which can then be tested experimentally.","inCitations":["203e7c57e4c4321a53ed22680556adafd603a8ce","ebe5819a38a88a978f3ce6419f376b64c1e8b1b1","c1a22e56ea0d7ef80c9ad522d37b196c43924b58","7d3ab0b3bb4fe8f132743bb0c9c0e0707d92be83","bbf7ccecd4d18ff24439fe736992d390bdc0a587","5708d4ca816e557dca9511631cb0f612aa849479","9e1b62facd5f1c349c45f75b9a065aef68697892","80d486195e35fa3c58afef0f5d1401347a09b94f","86d41017a1d83db3d332f6ca4c4c2ad860bfc7aa","47e20c61aa4354a26681fd35e7f717c647bfa802","91875b73a2c32029afc165829a7f5d915a544e1b","5887a8b5ba2f20c17200b86bc9a8e3230e93faf5","eb471b8d8c700236be2484ca7b26dd89903a0c58","5c67622da8a87d311d959dc1a5afe59fba8ad464","80b536ecae4b39d75aca3850d803ef6049963469","0ea30a7a36f9cf38e2ca9c835e482ee4eb97acbb","b556d413b95113f57beaccde9a3bc24c987bcde4","7250644c9a3a1e69662f9b3e40d25c4276c2e058","7a1b3081ab12704b37de0309f157dddf241665b5","53a64906340e92aca3721e4689eb37fd673eea6c","fdd0d7e50047a547b6faa0904fc57473c2b64627","62f320ac413113a3c44eb98f946544cbb1ac879a","5e7ea741b212c8ca757068a264c2b39c4e1b6b25","7420c1a0ecb69d5000fd6e7039124f54f91253e1","11f73df9467e79aaf341587fd80714e5574ff8d2","8059fbe8ef5e5328f11e6d22f1fd97cd68018022","3404e3ea55af0b48248d716885c8bb759c31e9ee","de7c129da8d2e6f5001b98e16ff881d37f53fb55","9632c6565f9f14e8b7a97279b8ffe0bae3d37dc4","69bb07c02c1f1fc4863ef6bb9843e921516d9ff2","5526725c340cabe7de2dcf958f91fee41d473f59","0b55db4530900a7ba54bd1db00bc413a2f15a194","cfabc88c259a3a28964d3b557ce79da3824b7459","5fa49ec59ad7c57e03956651c9a8e5e7b22f3568","96134db4d4e81a93260c35be366909a854c10514","c34b43039bf50a0eeca32a72f84debc1057ec9c7","f2f9158b29617b0b7c011b194419d022a25fd792","a641fc54dbe4b071250940512172541cf667abd5","703279daa9ae400308fee34d2196ed670650d161","2b3c6aaf24daf8c84d2102733d57d4a04bc65a20","8e01a2f34051db7c63f99bc2e93cf68504b70f96","9ed01abfe8cd431df2396ad034171839bc16e3d5","18e29f6d2693473c6896c2dff639e1df74083c1a","ff82f72d7ede4461a594ce188ce5819362c8b9d7","5c162a9b95d56cd6707d139d83dc69bc2141c449","0e9422e9960f2593e6a42750ae24c4c3432c947b","e8c184cf58597f4495b55c30ad75172658ef7574","bd218d7e25bc7aa647b36d48a124545b30e01509","d71d9f88e016a797089ee3ae372aadd34ffbcda2","502dc746498cfcfdf169a30b0586c6097f1725d9","685dd2352e90b638acd5f6ff47e81929a0e6d9f5","2abd33ae55de490dac572fb49e66a717fe675028","65bf065d5f13125297ff97749a23fc323732c866","0e716c92a45a9e541f26e031655a1af00938808c","93baaa361d63086c5fe704ac0c532dfa1bf20f15","43e7bd98fa4e63e7417a25923b9ca4f20db3bab5","4bccdc9147c45ee18ca1bf12dd5158eb8796b3c9","e92a9efe8c6e982bbc1c5eee20f9e4869d69ca0e","4184d7f5eeea423da285a41492074c0bd405a817","cf0177a7ddf927cad7082559b0359024573dc1d9","0e6a6549f1cd2034497259fe27bff9f3e7a356de","19b2a6fa7030cc8d517035905a56d056a8095b2c","86cc00ab28c6e53e3840bfc334dab99851a9e689","fa991fae0a149e2d03b44623355ce4a3edc367e7","afd114ea75cac35ede3cf045bbc4b10917b168d3","184f6d48a20542c9e586646ba74cc9b648f7b05c","3f13e7c6d41684939c7eb7618ec327c3d786d2ba","05e7127703c0c1d0e6cb11aa26cda4e3f5be32c8","6abd2c97134a3075ae877fe9c01daba9bd0bbde3","4e57ab413ab1b19e87acc139de836060e26a9fde","eebd15ffc7d61b3215da70f4b64fea7308bd7a81","cd2384b0292b75aabfdd199d11b3e4342f2554aa","3bf86e572355b0700b933b2467ad13f9ccf41c94","62bf7a54f83bc332d4df3f9f927a7424398e5abf","c595731b9400a9f43154bcf8eee040b86c765f23","07e15608aa7de92cb35034a288ae5b3c29be02e0","f9fe6515cdfaffa73448b63dd5eab6f6df35367b","58f3ec903b13370f8b9e1f64bbffceefb460201c","48007fb67028601b581c8a772499f45e53136e81","cc0a078660151477cd3602616b32c7142c7f53ce","8652895cde062903cdda75d560c13ead3e2e736d","dc3455a6f8054cbcfa11d3b03f6b4d5fb4729380","bb9a7633d8f6ca3be5299b06d13484e44ec20cc7","a5f10927efc7867ce369429cb726a71d1baa08e6","5404f6cbd36a192ef65392fa247c02d8e1039d0b","dbe6a3c0bb449f88f11de844d24b944124cea9bd","a26c4734a07407071077bf0f91b2275e8c1101c0","dabe1d93682c9f41a06acc99d6bf248cce39440b","3b92ea41dbda4d5e79d4789772f3b8c4c66c76da","65079090edc60b97170f86c76e7135f76464263f","7d1bc433edba97997c1dbfe98a344d4ed0dc087c","f30f80990a0d79b543b1b0164f0a7411d1c7e4fc","e8812cc0ba30dfb9c60c0da5914c2d69c1b0419f","c4b0a1406be83f5df9704ccb5073f6a1811cd760"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Construction of new ligand binding sites in proteins of known structure.

Shore","ids":["38856542"]}],"journalName":"Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience","paperAbstract":"Tinnitus or ringing of the ears is a subjective phantom sensation necessitating behavioral models that objectively demonstrate the existence and quality of the tinnitus sensation. The gap detection test uses the acoustic startle response elicited by loud noise pulses and its gating or suppression by preceding sub-startling prepulses. Gaps in noise bands serve as prepulses, assuming that ongoing tinnitus masks the gap and results in impaired gap detection. This test has shown its reliability in rats, mice, and gerbils. No data exists for the guinea pig so far, although gap detection is similar across mammals and the acoustic startle response is a well-established tool in guinea pig studies of psychiatric disorders and in pharmacological studies. Here we investigated the startle behavior and prepulse inhibition (PPI) of the guinea pig and showed that guinea pigs have a reliable startle response that can be suppressed by 15 ms gaps embedded in narrow noise bands preceding the startle noise pulse. After recovery of auditory brainstem response (ABR) thresholds from a unilateral noise over-exposure centered at 7 kHz, guinea pigs showed diminished gap-induced reduction of the startle response in frequency bands between 8 and 18 kHz. This suggests the development of tinnitus in frequency regions that showed a temporary threshold shift (TTS) after noise over-exposure. Changes in discharge rate and synchrony, two neuronal correlates of tinnitus, should be reflected in altered ABR waveforms, which would be useful to objectively detect tinnitus and its localization to auditory brainstem structures. Therefore, we analyzed latencies and amplitudes of the first five ABR waves at suprathreshold sound intensities and correlated ABR abnormalities with the results of the behavioral tinnitus testing. Early ABR wave amplitudes up to N3 were increased for animals with tinnitus possibly stemming from hyperactivity and hypersynchrony underlying the tinnitus percept. Animals that did not develop tinnitus after noise exposure showed the opposite effect, a decrease in wave amplitudes for the later waves P4-P5. Changes in latencies were only observed in tinnitus animals, which showed increased latencies. Thus, tinnitus-induced changes in the discharge activity of the auditory nerve and central auditory nuclei are represented in the ABR.","inCitations":["fe168446c977541787f53863f6fa1404b85199ab","d4a3ca29f668f41076a76651124225604339691f","039a7b554a6687817509b893b68b2deaec51dfc8","d9d22edba41dd08525cf9f47d5a6896bf1db36b9","058e6b1c390423b669005b95faccb4baed0e3c63","8a86d68b6c2019fe936b59edd80146f2dcc5a903","caa8f0ebd14182cde633c91e5b418b2cf3d79cc0","ca2599cd2f67e2df0df5c2c9c2ba3a981fe3da02","8938380fb8aa82e2f2aeadc3d7a979f0e90525f3","f4e9dfe7c768ffce090e57b457b59e926e860830","92cf0d8cf9dfa8e76fec8054922f1973f36ce988","c75550c3b7d3a4a1e0ea5e90ea6c102210caf41a","4a6af935b6b9f98d3493baedb38172537a8620f7","46d91c545f3d0cd3f5aae9ba85cb5bf42af6c215","9d35f3e7b7011d2c9acfa64ef127534968b5afe9","7cc6dce7b18fa4157f9bb90dc07c4b20cd9f68ca","74e1e1becb22cce057186dda69057121007a0db1","692b0d32f3b54a3525c4ed3c245e28f5804718ac","efbe3a46a8f3032ee31a55010733de13bc603c13","a6bc82a1d6f5ad42192bfab834980fe414b9c776","4fe77bd41b5f984367060144d28d5ca2ab9d5533","a667da943efea127ecf0c54b304a9e0fcc9df220","b5a2b01c784e846ba7d39c05c33b40c9d298e707","464fc5ac66229ff583e41e35751330ed059a9922","5879b5425b5cabb12d8cc4eddf967a8625df7d1f","23f44be8ea717f1d24ecfb1108634d480471f018","111b6c27681944daf9be21220734c7907934fbe8","e9b5a7acf4d21b34b8260e963f566a015fc6f4f2","30044569430b104c6428c6f281389c6e92a13c43","9d41ddd109439b59e25d463b1be5f9691486e8fc","e25c963fe2b2b0317ce97176875de4f88e749c38","224314a040b32e3939ee09beab9437ec3baadcb0","420657aa605285c99c26e63a2a0c3805fc432c76","de5ae2c2793a41720f6f5f3a94c188c8a6a96f37","16af0397fd57d95affbec12ab15bf97d69383fb2","326be0de81f795139943aaed81cd2b919d7ee24f","bee997574e589f74cd5bc956f6107b980a52c8ef","ce2853cd83eb3ae5ae9cb3cc1312ca9ca9292757","77d5ea73dce8e28d2233a7fefa6151ea30babe4a","0f89db90cea9b8a91795789ee3eb130584bf77a9","8382c14b4d4df545ed0e449ecff1ccf1a4b967a7","3f42b55c79bb82287854322d3eabae2d38fc5557","a718a5edab0880d9e480903921978a8c9d1aac03","205eae2fd5979617dc173443ed49f8fe55b267f6","dbd072269ed4f144040f828de4ea6caeb42ff4e1","7a7ae9b93eeb9ea6b6792e7b554d513bbc52dbb3","58b44dc11f7788cf44b516e91b238d8e62dbf40f","d299c23bf016effc8f743607f9380e024ca6642d","89f2f6a2faf350eeac2474efdb93134eae052365","b1836b10192f5faf975b18f409bc87d383e57ac1","e3821fd1f1b6ea320f0b07330f1514ad1b31a05e","a28f311c1031a539f32dcba3ab8224a5d17bd747","97c209b02407af2ff0fd7da38850f6dee0c26273","8f89103282dfbfa8e78a94ba09008588391b5d58","3004f903177dadc841c94cba2536c40bc80ef66a","d6cba6648a8d32462669729d5bf0be4213120395","a5cf78bff9ecddbe20ab6028738b32e1041346db","a5dbfab33d5d0ef53d2115b90e2ccca65c9e9311","edf60395538ae70469cf0a5f24fb9983f32d3fa8"],"pdfUrls":["http://journal-cdn.frontiersin.org/article/22597/files/pubmed-zip/versions/1/pdf"],"title":"Gap prepulse inhibition and auditory brainstem-evoked potentials as objective measures for tinnitus in guinea pigs","doi":"10.3389/fnsys.2012.00042","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.3389/fnsys.2012.00042","venue":"Front.

There is the history of the reign of Henry V and, in particular, Henry’s first expedition to France which ended in the victory of Agincourt, and there is the history contemporaneous with Shakespeare’s own life. Perhaps we should bear in mind a third historical dimension: that provided by our own experience. We ‘see’ Shakespeare’s Henry V not as a detached, isolated, work of art. We come to it through what we understand of the world about us. It is easy to see how different that can be for those of different generations living today. Henry’s appeal will almost certainly be very different for those of twenty or less years than it evidently was for Laurence Olivier and those of this generation when Olivier made his film version of Henry V during the last years of the 1939ȓ45 War.

The study focuses on the spectrum differences of a point to which the system arrives from different scanning paths. It is noted that according to this theorem at a common point the system has similar macroscopic properties. Furthermore it was examined the memory string of the system. We concluded that opposite to theorem-6: a) at a common point the system can reach in a finite (not an infinite) number of ways, b) a correction for the thickness of the adsorbed film prior to capillary condensation is necessary, and c) the scattering curves although at high-Q values coincide, at low-Q values are different indicating different microscopic states. That is, at a common point the system holds different metastable states sustained by hysteresis effects. These metastable states are the ones which highlight the way of a system back to a return point memory (RPM). Entering the hysteresis loop from different RPMs different histories are implanted to the paths toward the common point. Although in general the memory points refer to relaxation phenomena, they also constitute a characteristic feature of capillary condensation. Analogies of the no-passing rule and the adiabaticity assumption in the frame of adsorption hysteresis are discussed.","inCitations":["bbd3f948432353b7da8b053acbc179b5cffe1bf6"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Scanning of Adsorption Hysteresis In Situ with Small Angle X-Ray Scattering","doi":"10.1371/journal.pone.0164636","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0164636","venue":"PloS one"}

This, coupled with various hardships and unfilled dreams of fame and fortune, has him attempting suicide. However, his guardian angel Clarence, rescues him.In their ensuing conversation George Bailey wishes that he had never been born. Clarence was able to fulfill this wish and shows Bailey what life would have been like in Bedford Falls if Bailey had not been born. The results are disturbing and show a dark, corrupt, nightmarish Bedford Falls without George Bailey. His life did make a major, positive difference in his community!What if the Smith-Hughes Act had never been passed? What would agriculture and education be like today without this landmark legislation? Let's assume the Smith-Hughes Act never existed and there was no subsequent legislation based on the Smith-Hughes model. While it is a challenge to image life without the SmithHughes Act, here are some plausible possibilities.Stagnant Agricultural Productivity. At the time the SmithHughes Act was passed about 70% of the population lived in rural areas and a typical farmer was able to feed only four other people (Kirschenmnn, 2000). Fast forward to the modern era and we see that one farmer feeds around 155 people (Vilsack, 2010). What has contributed to this increase in productivity? Among the many factors contributing to this increase are mechanization, crop hybridization, agricultural chemicals, artificial insemination and biotechnology. However, we also must recognize that the application of modern farming practices was being taught to countless thousands of young people in agricultural classes. These young people were then applying what they learned on the farm.The Smith-Hughes Act required all students to have \"... directed or supervised practice in agriculture.for at least six months per year.\" (Public Law No. 347, Sec. 10). Students typically grew crops or raised livestock under the watchful eye of the agricultural teacher. Students wanted to do a good job in applying the modern farming practices they were taught. Records from this era show that the crops yields produced by the students were nearly double that of the state average (Uricchio, Moore & Coley, 2013). Many of these agriculture students went into farming. Thus, one immediate impact of the Smith-Hughes Act was increased agricultural productivity. If the Smith-Hughes Act had not existed, it is doubtful that these types of gains would have been made in agricultural productivity.School Dropouts Would Continue. At the time the SmithHughes Act passed, students dropping out of school was a major issue. When students reached the age of 14 they dropped out. They saw no relevance or value in what they were learning. The Smith-Hughes Act contributed to reversing this trend. The legislation clearly stated that vocational education was for those 14 years of age or older. And half of the instruction was to be hands-on. These two facts resulted in students remaining in school.Heckman and LaFontaine (2010, p. 1) reported that \"Throughout the first half of the 20th century, each new cohort of Americans was more likely to graduate high school than the preceding one. This upward trend in secondary education increased worker productivity and fueled American economic growth.\" It is highly likely that the SmithHughes Act, which also established educational programs in home economics and trade and industrial education (in addition to agriculture education) was one of the contributing factors for students staying in school.In the early days of agricultural education, agricultural teachers were expected to teach three groups of students - the all-day students (students who were in school all day), out-of-school youth (students who had dropped out) and adults (more later). The out-of-school youth were taught when school dismissed for the day or in the early evening. …","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"What If the Smith-Hughes Act Never Existed?","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}
