Weak polyelectrolytes are very useful materials in construction of composite systems with thin layer-by-layer organic films on the surface with high potential in solid phase extraction. Herein, two facile strategies to modify silica microparticle surfaces with single branched poly(ethyleneimine) (PEI) multilayers are reported, the formed composites having ultra-fast response and high capacity for multiple loading/release of copper ions from aqueous solutions. The composites were obtained using a layer-by-layer technique in which PEI and poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) (strategy A) or PEI4-Cu complex and PAA (strategy B) were alternately deposited and cross-linked with glutaraldehyde (GA) onto silica microparticles. Silica//(PEI)n composites were obtained after PAA extraction in basic media from silica//(PEI/PAA)n composites or after Cu2+ and PAA extraction from silica//(PEI4-Cu/PAA)n composites. The amount of loaded Cu2+ depended on the amount of composites organic part, while the kinetic of sorption depended more on the flexibility and accessibility of functional groups inside the (PEI)n film. The maximum recorded value, after 10 cycles of loading/release of copper ions onto silica//(PEI)7, was ˜12 mg Cu2+/g composite (or ˜200 mg Cu2+/g polymer). Composite microparticles based on cross-linked PEI chains on the surface of silica could be very promising solid supports for using in multiple loading/release of heavy metal ions with applications in water purification or in chromatography.","inCitations":["7210218d1b3086bb61fd44a08a3b63c748ba9bff"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Layer-by-layer polyelectrolyte architectures with ultra-fast and high loading/release properties for copper ions","doi":"10.1016/j.colsurfa.2019.123704","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2019.123704","venue":""}

Theoretically, the biologically active isomer of FA, 1-FA, should be more effective than racemic FA in modulating 5-FU activity.\n\n\nPATIENTS AND METHODS\nThirty-three patients (pts) with ABC, all previously treated with an anthracycline-based combination for advanced disease were treated with 1-FA: 100 mg/m2 i.v. and 5-FU: 370 mg/m2 i.v. for 5 consecutive days every 4 weeks.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThree complete remission (CR) and 11 partial remission (PR) were obtained for an overall response rate of 42% (95% CI = 25-59). Median duration of response was 10 months, median survival was 15 months for responders, 11 months for NC and 3 for PD. Eleven pts experienced a WHO grade III-IV oral mucositis (33%), 6 pts had grade III and one grade IV diarrhea, two pts had grade IV neutropenia resulting in one toxic death.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn this heavily pretreated population of pts with ABC, this regimen showed an interesting activity with substantial toxicity. Both the response rate and the pattern of side-effects seem similar to those experienced with the racemic mixture of d,1-FA. Modulated 5-FU warrants an increasing consideration in the treatment of breast cancer.","inCitations":["1829b7a7013aeb05c9bacc56ff8a91423cca7dca","dfa604c7b060f184f58d775cf4350dac50769a0a","2b2939f92ae18e6f4ba70bcb78e6ebbf5a015a93","868f83a132de3d4a8e84c35d4b849d99a50b723c","d4e094b580b5824a39835a8b2e04a86c709f35cc","696387994b96f7191f8a7997c8714808dd972b4f"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"L-folinic acid and 5-fluorouracil in the treatment of advanced breast cancer: a phase II study.","doi":"10.1093/annonc/4.suppl_2.S41","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1093/annonc%2F4.suppl_2.S41","venue":"Annals of oncology : official journal of the European Society for Medical Oncology"}

Methods Five mL of blood sample was collected from a total of 1 181 individuals aged 12 years and above. These included 661 (55.9%) from HIV positive patients and 520 (44.1%) from HIV negative individuals. A total of 238 samples out of the 520 HIV negative patients were collected from the antenatal women. Demographic profile of the subjects was recorded. Immunoglobulin G ELISA was performed for all the samples, while only the samples received from antenatal women were tested by immunoglobulin M capture ELISA. Results Seroprevalence among HIV infected and non-infected was found to be 21.3% (95% confidence interval = 18.4%−24.6%) and 14.2% (95% confidence interval = 11.5%−17.5%), respectively. The difference was statistically significant ( P = 0.003). No significant gender differences were found. Seroprevalence increased from 9.1% to 30% with increasing age in the HIV infected patients. Only 2 (0.84%) samples of antenatal women were positive for immunoglobulin M capture ELSIA, while one sample was equivocally reactive. Conclusions Seroprevalence of latent toxoplasmosis in our region is moderately high, particularly in the HIV infected patients, exposing them to the risk of reactivation. This suggests that serologic testing of all HIV infected patients is essential to initiate Toxoplasma prophylaxis. Similarly, screening for active Toxoplasma gondii infection during antenatal care and preventive education is essential to prevent and minimize congenital toxoplasmosis.","inCitations":["5b61440807c15ca1f49d52837a848f3076d292a4"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.apjtcm.com/zz/2015s1/6.pdf"],"title":"Seroprevalence of Toxoplasma among HIV infected and HIV non-infected individuals in North India","doi":"10.1016/S2222-1808(15)60848-9","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/S2222-1808%2815%2960848-9","venue":""}

Direct application of growth factors of the fibroblast (acidic, basic fibroblast growth factor, FGF-5), endothelial (vascular endothelial growth factor) and other series has been effective in preliminary studies. Angiogenesis by gene transfer provides an attractive alternative, with the advantage that the protein may continue to be secreted for a longer period of time and that the gene may be targeted to specific tissues to enhance efficacy and reduce systemic side effects. Angiogenesis by gene transfer is currently under investigation using a variety of growth factors and a wide array of potential delivery systems. These include application of the gene as naked DNA or by viral vector in the proximal vessel by direct intravascular injection, interventional cardiologic techniques (hydrogel coating on balloon, double balloon system, stent implantation) or by direct application to adventitia, pericardium or ischemic tissue distal to the site of arterial obstruction. As our understanding of the molecular and genetic processes underlying angiogenesis increases, and as we examine the results of preliminary animal and human protocols, we hope to develop the potential of angiogenesis by gene transfer for therapeutic use.","inCitations":["10cecfd117b595647708e8472a3b4ded9df3783f","913c98a5d2e367e4392455e952ef01e6639f66c0","826a79f2610655e88a908c512bfcaf298450b33d","615d3483ff16a02a2f42d79413120a9e4d05cdd2","b7df9a485b55568eb2ed13ff9c5c9af05db43473","6db6d90c64dd36d3a02b787418ee7043f98b7774","fc9fdac2651e5be1695949c3443ee979179aebd3","9ef21a28e898b1bef960d14b27a219823f346658","95db11acf2373052dd8dfe9c8206014e83afa35c","3e1a45d5831257ae3ed16cb8a88c566c791f58e5","c291f2cc0ba5cf30ad6c01946f629a9b16d5c7ac","b5f366d522f869e4cacd1756b8bdfaed09a46885","d9a197669bdd3fe99f3240a30d849326d70a311d","29ea07e4f6a3fdd853ce246ec1b1c8980490cccb","6e37d00233431ad6fb621553eeed47e34ef459cd","697d0f9e22ed455bdc09730b7fd3360b8e337a43","5a017836f53822483e7b4d4b0518d04babe62714","a10ab3d3e843431fa3872419c093b0a7ddbacaff","30bf6ff8a5d19400a551c92a9d2e3d0b5b4635f5","cf924470fcebd6edd5a882ee9bda7ecbc6209d0a","256140c55a9bf44ab6c0e28cab8414f295adb61a","6a0d6fc0b7507c4b50861a10dab43821650d5305","fe3129769be87ca948239d4dc895a9ff27fdfa7b","0e4a2b39e47c3b6b4331f7acb60f1eb4a2d89b44","b76e8af975aa6d838f1be4363c091f4f21dbeba4","99d4c7c7fae4a7ee9999a788c4535e572c9c8358","d352a09410e88d0c37f739ee48c56566cb577808","3f8d39f7812805bcad84084769f73c27381588f8","802b089cbb4af88479b339aa8c69b86771ba3f14","fd74450f9b85b65bd3cf686fed4a82dd01c0d23e","780a3e4e529b872c3770ceadf63afe04ddbac514","b5a8b4c9c6e48d1ebf5cc215894151a5102f1de8","9c5d1480f4a8ce28116ee4bf143330744c84a922","b188546c51f19d6fc181f7fcd4b1201c9334ebad","9d1a461180b6d791181ec56bc3337d482fc73b99","bf535ddc37bba3710f683ff5be8aa7c5ca39fb34"],"pdfUrls":["https://oup.silverchair-cdn.com/oup/backfile/Content_public/Journal/cardiovascres/35/3/10.1016/S0008-6363(97)00170-3/2/35-3-490.pdf?Expires=1491374501&Key-Pair-Id=APKAIUCZBIA4LVPAVW3Q&Signature=MkbZw1vO0I0a0Z-yVGHEPZ13yzt9USHvcDqKMtExyeMs7XJwmNIl36B8h3qPSY~-3KnhvAS9cQgJSxR6SqhZgl0guu97xDPOEAgZEWm-46PU1tnyWzeGudsgXbEzFdu1EHZ09eyYSOTnTdA9lyX~RzNZnI1QGWWdGI8Kw08MckyAU2iNjIlY5I7q1D3vFyJKGW7-d0RKWJ2d2Vl89ePBBErXyK-qtoSRTGM0u4MbDYlCI49KtSfyyaYCWnj8qH4GUrFy4VDixESRm7ZCiJYDCHk~QuIJLsJsiY2CAsBtxyVaCmqwKIzfMZ7MUKi2SsEc8Pqin9JfETBtSGUC-QEfpQ__","http://cardiovascres.oxfordjournals.org/content/35/3/490.full.pdf"],"title":"Angiogenesis by gene therapy: a new horizon for myocardial revascularization?","doi":"10.1016/S0008-6363(97)00170-3","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/S0008-6363%2897%2900170-3","venue":"Cardiovascular research"}

PLC manufacturers provide for programmers only basic control algorithms. With the development of PLC and their successors (Programmable Automation Controller – PAC) appeared increased CPU and memory capabilities of the equipment and fuller implementation of programming languages defined in the standard IEC-61131-3. PLCs and PACs now have the computing power and memory of the personal computer PC a few years ago, they can also be programmed in high level languages using matrix operations. Currently, PLC and PAC allow implementation of almost any discrete control algorithm. In this article it is considered the implementation of advanced control method – the algorithm MAC/MPC (Model Algorithmic Control/Model Predictive Control) due to its usability and for the presentation of the implementation process. MPC can be implemented also in the supervisory layer of hierarchical model of the control system, so the whole model is presented. Verification process of implemented MPC controller in the PLC with hardware-in-a-loop structure is presented. Results of cycle durations and memory requirements tests can be used to estimate the applicability of MPC controller on other platforms and for particular objects. Properties of MPC controllers are not available for the classic PLC controllers (PID class with modifications and expansions), therefore, the implementation of MPC in the PLC significantly expands the control capabilities of this platform.","inCitations":["5a3af2c3ba7a5f4fca9cd2a6f0d5d2ae365c3ed6"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Implementacja algorytmu regulacji predykcyjnej MPC w sterownikach programowalnych","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Pathophysiologic problems of these respiratory instabilities in heart failure are sympathetic nerve activation, carbon dioxide chemoreflex hypersensitivity, and hemodynamic deterioration. Generally, the instability of the negative feedback system such as respiratory control arises from delayed signaling and high controller gain, which could correspond to circulatory delay caused by low cardiac output and enhanced chemosensitivity in heart failure. Clinical data suggest that sympathoexcitation is one of the important causes of chemoreflex hypersensitivity. On the other hand, the enhanced chemosensitivity facilitates unstable respiration such as Cheyne-Stokes respiration, which augments sympathetic tone further. Another type of respiratory instabilty is the non-periodic irregular respiration which is likely caused by nonchemical ventilatory modulation such as stimulation of afferent vagal endings by the elevation of pulmonary artery pressure and lung congestion. These respiratory instabilities are not only related to severity of cardiac dysfunction and functional capacity, but the key to enforce vicious circle of sympathetic and chemoreflex augmentation and eventually worsening hemodynamics. These findings indicate that respiratory instability faithfully reflects worsening heart failure and that respiratory stabilization therapy could improve heart failure through the suppression of chemosensitivity and sympathetic nerve activity.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Impact of Sleep-disordered Breathing on Vascular Dysfunction and Ventricular Arrhythmias in Heart Failure Patients","doi":"10.1016/j.cardfail.2013.08.070","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cardfail.2013.08.070","venue":""}

Here, we investigated pioglitazone’s preventative effect against sepsis induced by intravenous injection of a lethal dose of Escherichia coli in elderly mice (50–60 wk old) and examined its immunological and metabolic effects on liver leukocytes. Pioglitazone improved bacterial elimination in the peripheral blood, lowered serum pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-12, IFN-γ), and prevented septic death. It also enhanced bacterial elimination in the liver, by increasing the phagocytic and bactericidal activities of liver F4/80+CD11b+ recruited macrophages (Mφ), their CD206 expression and reactive oxygen species production. Quantitative PCR revealed that pioglitazone treatment enhanced gene expression of rate-limiting enzymes for glycolysis in hepatic CD11b+ cells (including neutrophils and recruited Mφ), and their improved phagocytic and bactericidal activities were abolished by glycolysis inhibiting reagents. These findings present the possibility that pioglitazone strengthens the phagocytic and bactericidal activities of liver recruited Mφ and that these immunological activities are closely associated with their glucose catabolism.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Pioglitazone improves phagocytic activity of liver recruited macrophages in elderly mice possibly by promoting glucose catabolism","doi":"10.1177/1753425919849620","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1177/1753425919849620","venue":"Innate immunity"}

Several studies support a potential link between TAI and the reduction in ovarian reserve. However, robust evidence regarding its prevalence in women with DOR is lacking.\n\n\nSTUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION\nThis study is a large cross-sectional analysis of retrospective data from the Centre for Reproductive Medicine/University Hospital of Brussels. Serum measurements were taken for anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH), free thyroxine (FT4), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and anti-thyroperoxidase (anti-TPO).\n\n\nPARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS\nAmong 5076 consecutive women, 4894 women had their AMH, FT4, TSH and anti-TPO levels measured on the same day. AMH levels were plotted in relation to age for the whole patients' cohort and age-specific AMH values (per year) were considered in order to categorize women according to the AMH levels of ovarian reserve. There were 3929 women who demonstrated normal reserve, 487 women who had low ovarian reserve and 478 women who demonstrated high ovarian reserve.\n\n\nMAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE\nSerum FT4 and TSH levels were comparable between different ovarian reserve categories (P = 0.611 and 0.811, respectively). No significant differences were observed in the prevalence of positive anti-TPO antibodies among women with low (12.1%), normal (10.3%) and high (9.8%) ovarian reserve (P = 0.423). Finally, the prevalence of overt or subclinical hypothyroidism was comparable between the groups (4.1% in low, 4.6% in normal and 3.8% in high ovarian reserve women, P = 0.645).Analysis according to the exact cause of low ovarian reserve demonstrated that women with a genetic cause of low ovarian reserve had a significantly higher prevalence of overt hypothyroidism and subclinical hypothyroidism compared with women with unexplained low ovarian reserve for their age (25 versus 3.2%, P = 0.002 and 18.8 versus 1.6%, P = 0.004, respectively). On the contrary, no significant differences were observed in the prevalence of hypothyroidism between genetic causes and iatrogenic causes (P = 0.316) and between iatrogenic and unexplained causes (P = 0.219) of low ovarian reserve.\n\n\nLIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION\nThis is a cross-sectional analysis based on retrospective data collection. Due to the retrospective design of this study, the presence of biases related to such a study design cannot be excluded. Furthermore, this study assessed only the association of TAI, and not autoimmunity in general, with ovarian reserve.\n\n\nWIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS\nTAI and hypothyroidism are not associated with low ovarian reserve. Future research should focus on examining underlying mechanisms, other than TAI, which may have an effect on ovarian reserve.\n\n\nSTUDY FUNDING/COMPETING INTERESTS\nNo external funding was used for this study. No conflicts of interest are declared.","inCitations":["cc6d480234ebbd949ddf2f5ea2a556e37c6696df","5d91ebf3eb095c86ee7f497425d760a89058efc3","720d47c1cba43f5221c5d3546ba33faa28d8a10a","ac4c0e4f07aec62321ac9067f574787cfbf6e34a","00a97dc5da8af4fd5e0966874fa4787720047740","8146ef9969c5c2c592321bdaab631a11c5f9106a","2625470e8e951b67bf0baed9ec3fa8d73d9f340c","c7dd9751d2586a08f4fbad4d90701d5d1d409c5a","d6e844361ba6696e3cb1c36203293ecbe2f62e50","c9bb9539dc5c9643f2a684b5cda1e2f1fd61d565","546d7259c4e6495add2c617a894761130bbe4756","08086b5e62476cd146dfae4a2956f8d1db7f13ae","5d61c1d5aadba6c1090dfe03667635655e98467a","3567724c0fb2cee9459844904858be08a4954eed","a2970a0780af0807725b7432ddec9fd17dee32dd","d1fe1f532771ab03220063c30192b06ecc642b19","0ed499ad1ea8862f099fb1818cd42e6884d95053","e76e85c25bbfc4bc5ea574047b735b1ee2a61318"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Thyroid autoimmunity, hypothyroidism and ovarian reserve: a cross-sectional study of 5000 women based on age-specific AMH values.","doi":"10.1093/humrep/dev089","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1093/humrep%2Fdev089","venue":"Human reproduction"}

Considerando que a crianca acometida pelo câncer apresenta mudancas tanto do ponto de vista orgânico como na dimensao psicossocial, a brincadeira denota como um recurso no intuito de diminuir a ansiedade da crianca frente ao desconhecido e de permitir a esta, a possibilidade de se mostrar autentico. O presente estudo partiu da seguinte questao norteadora: qual a importância do brincar para criancas em tratamento quimioterapico e para as maes acompanhantes? Para responder a esta questao proposta, a pesquisa tem como objetivos investigar sobre a importância do brincar para a crianca acometida pelo câncer em tratamento quimioterapico e para as maes acompanhantes; analisar os relatos de criancas e maes participantes do estudo a luz da Teoria Humanistica de Enfermagem de Paterson e Zderad. Metodologia: trata-se de uma pesquisa de natureza qualitativa que inclui como cenario de investigacao a clinica de oncologia pediatrica, assim como, o ambulatorio de quimioterapia infantil de um hospital publico situado na cidade de Campina Grande – PB. Participaram do estudo cinco criancas em tratamento quimioterapico e cinco maes acompanhantes. Para a coleta de dados, foi utilizada a tecnica de entrevista a partir de um roteiro contendo questoes norteadoras pertinentes aos objetivos propostos para a investigacao. A coleta ocorreu entre os meses de maio e outubro de 2015 e so foi iniciada apos aprovacao do protocolo de pesquisa por um Comite de Etica em Pesquisa. O material empirico foi analisado a luz da Teoria Humanistica de Enfermagem. Resultados: a partir dos dados coletados, emergiram dois artigos: (1) Ser mae de crianca com câncer e a importância do brincar. (2) Experiencia existencial de criancas em tratamento quimioterapico sobre a importância do brincar. O primeiro manuscrito permitiu apreender as mudancas que permeiam o existir de maes de criancas com câncer e que, a principio, sao determinadas pelo impacto do diagnostico. No que concerne a importância do brincar, as genitoras destacam que as atividades ludicas, alem de ser uma fonte de prazer e alegria, colaboram para que as criancas fiquem menos ociosas. No segundo artigo, os discursos das criancas participantes do estudo revelam que o brincar no ambiente ambulatorial proporciona um momento de diversao e distracao, minimizando a ansiedade relacionada ao tempo de espera. Alem disso, os relatos evidenciam que a brincadeira desperta na crianca uma sensacao de estar-melhor contribuindo para que a mesma enfrente satisfatoriamente a realidade vivida. Conclusao: deste modo, o brincar se apresenta como um importante recurso que pode ser utilizado tanto durante a hospitalizacao quanto durante o tratamento ambulatorial quimioterapico infantil, sendo seus beneficios percebidos tanto pelas criancas quanto pelas maes acompanhantes.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"A importância do brincar para a criança com câncer em tratamento quimioterápico e mães acompanhantes: um estudo à luz da Teoria Humanística","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Indeed optical designers often speak about scattering where manufacturers speak about roughness. This link would enable an easier understanding between both parts, ending up with better designs. Besides, optical design software deal very well with BSDF, but ray tracing time can be strongly impacted when you have a lot of them in your design. Therefore, replacing BSDF by a real geometrical shape such as the roughness could be of a big benefit. How can we link BSDF to roughness? We worked on two ways of finding a link between BSDF and roughness. From measured BSDF with Reflet Bench, we tried to find the equivalent roughness using He-Torrance model. Still using He-Torrance model we also tried to compute the BSDF knowing a roughness profile from a sample. The study showed great results with specular samples. When roughness is at least ten times bigger than the wavelength, roughness could be estimated within 5% precision. Above this limit, roughness can still be computed but with a 50% precision, which gives us at least an order of magnitude estimation. We also found with our method that, the more scattering the sample is, the more difficult it is to estimate roughness. Thanks to such a link between roughness and BSDF, it becomes much easier to understand how to go from one to the other. This can be very useful for optical designers, but also for manufacturer who wants to perform roughness measurement. Designers who need a certain scattering for their optical designs, can therefore easily speak with manufacturers by giving them a roughness value to perform the BSDF they are looking for.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"From BRDF to roughness: defining the link between two key parameters for optical design","doi":"10.1117/12.2190971","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1117/12.2190971","venue":"SPIE Optical Systems Design"}

Different hold times, in the range of 5–2000 s (at 10 μN of applied load), were incorporated into each nanoindentation measurement. The increase in hold time results in an increase in change in depth of the indenter in both samples. The error in hardness/modulus due to creep can be neglected for hold times of ∼400 s or more for untreated PDMS and ∼200 s or more for UV treated PDMS. The FTIR obtained data revealed surface deterioration, while the bulk nanomechanical properties were almost identical. A decrease in adhesive energy in the case of UV treated PDMS was observed, indicating that adhesive forces play a significant role at the nanometre scale in the indentation tests (real contact area determination during nanoindentation measurements).","inCitations":["67171057dd36fa3dc710daeb7a11f24b523c7e3d"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Influence of accelerated aging on nanomechanical properties, creep behaviour and adhesive forces of PDMS","doi":"10.1179/1743289811Y.0000000013","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1179/1743289811Y.0000000013","venue":""}

It is often diagnosed in older, brachycephalic breeds, and although its typical clinical features and neuroanatomic location have been well described, less common presentations may hinder its diagnosis. We describe 3 cases of canine cerebral oligodendroglioma that clinically and grossly present as intraventricular tumors. Histologic findings in all cases were typical of oligodendroglioma. Neoplastic cells were uniformly immunoreactive for Olig2 and negative for neuron-specific enolase, neurofilament, and glial fibrillary acidic protein. In addition to the immunopositivity for Olig2, a cluster of morphologically distinct neoplastic cells in one of the cases was immunoreactive for synaptophysin, and the case was diagnosed as an oligodendroglioma with neurocytic differentiation. Based on these findings, oligodendroglioma should be included as a differential diagnosis for intraventricular neoplasia in dogs. Furthermore, oligodendroglioma with ventricular involvement should be differentiated from central neurocytoma by immunohistochemistry.","inCitations":["b9cc0a0e423e42bb05d106a048f69d8ae801a33e","1e61b1c4075cfceb86f56873e7b7108669d899c4","5913d7cfbb5f1feb91cc41c8191890961ab8a1fc","4aaa5bffec527a068b59674578deda4c718b9665","236f63d112be104826672af45635c9d2bba23d19","dc14595b83a869af9e575b0d7169ae7bb01c3866","38562fadcb72b37a491181d1982f02b283d53edc","b6ea9f44d9a84d26903418c9cd94d17d365060d6"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Cerebral oligodendroglioma mimicking intraventricular neoplasia in three dogs","doi":"10.1177/1040638715584619","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1177/1040638715584619","venue":"Journal of veterinary diagnostic investigation : official publication of the American Association of Veterinary Laboratory Diagnosticians, Inc"}

This paper studies personal characteristics that encourage drug use by adults and how those characteristics help explain women's greater use. Data are from a general population survey of white adults in metropolitan Detroit, which has information on drug use from health interviews and also from health diaries kept for six weeks. Results show that morbidity is the strongest predictor of both curative and preventive use for adults. Age ranks second (older people use more drugs), and inability to ignore symptoms ranks third. Disruptive events, feelings of helplessness about life, poor self-rated health, and recent stress also boost drug use to a smaller extent. Personal characteristics are not only crucial to explaining day-to-day drug use by women and men, but also to accounting for sex differences in use. Detroit women's drug use is 50–80% greater than men's. The women also tend to have personal characteristics that boost drug use. When those characteristics are statistically controlled, the sex differences in drug use diminish. This is especially true for curative use, because it is so strongly affected by morbidity and women report much greater morbidity than men do. Structural characteristics (features of health services, medical care practice, health insurance, drug industry) are not measured in the data, but they are probably important too since people's ability to obtain prescriptions and to purchase drugs ultimately affects their daily drug use.","inCitations":["bd744476a9914fadd2df39b593ed9339da1cf4b9","ba6e038b40fcd162a3969efed3ea88bd3244d4e1","4e3b8ebab8412088226eeffa4fd86511b97d4ccf","72738d053652453cdd2fc9b57fe165466f686365","74a348bb2004676cdb770b04d96328dc529d97a4","0ac9164e14bf1903376649280ab62dc87929658c","feb7dcf98745e7be74e267b730f74e6d117691c6","11858f3a47a90b6f6f936b3f7adf4a1afecee1bd","d6ee5f6949a533f91ecf5c7d21f4144a74a8db54","0658aa1ae00f2a9997186223df3c91156a8d551b"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Sex Differences in Legal Drug Use","doi":"10.1111/j.1540-4560.1982.tb00118.x","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1540-4560.1982.tb00118.x","venue":""}

We successfully operate QKD at 1310 nm over a fibre shared with four optically amplified data channels near 1550 nm. We identify the dominant impairment as spontaneous antiStokes Raman scattering of the strong signals, quantify its impact, and measure and model its propagation through fibre. We describe a quantum networking architecture which can provide the flexibility and scalability likely to be critical for supporting widespread deployment of quantum applications.","inCitations":["d93bfc6e187cb33267abde199979034b87957a09"],"pdfUrls":["http://d.researchbib.com/f/0nnJcwp21uYzAioF9jqJWfnJAuqTyioaZioJSlL2tlZQR0Y1LlFGZkAl5jMTL.pdf"],"title":"Key Pre Distribution Using Quantum Key Channel – A Survey","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

The theory reduces to an equivalent of the SAFT equation of state in the bulk, thus making possible the modeling of both bulk and interfacial properties with a single set of parameters. The performance of iSAFT is illustrated through comparisons of the theory predictions with molecular simulation as well as experimental data for vapor−liquid surface tension. The formulation of iSAFT DFT preserves the computational efficiency of an atomic DFT, thus enabling the theory to deal with molecules comprising hundreds or even thousands of segments, such as the polystyrene and polyethylene included in the present work.","inCitations":["eda0a4fd84bf4d6bf5a1a0b3b8e03a85e1173aff","e9405c86298084b389e89e8f09a27f07f5492357"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Bulk and Interfacial Properties of Polymers from Interfacial SAFT Density Functional Theory","doi":"10.1021/ie060329e","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1021/ie060329e","venue":""}

Many redundancy analysis (RA) algorithms have been developed to repair the memory faults. However, it is difficult to achieve high repair rate and fast analysis speed. The previous RA algorithms do not achieve both high repair rate and fast analysis speed. To overcome this problem, a new RA algorithm called one side pivot (OSP) is proposed. Using the property of pivot fault and its repair priority, the analysis time to find a solution can be reduced. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is efficient in terms of repair rate and analysis speed.","inCitations":["2673443e9bb1378c9f7c27366ea63b2608f5dcb1"],"pdfUrls":["http://soc.yonsei.ac.kr/Abstract/International_conference/pdf/143_A%20New%20Redundancy%20Analysis%20Algorithm%20Using%20One%20Side%20Pivot.pdf"],"title":"A new redundancy analysis algorithm using one side pivot","doi":"10.1109/ISOCC.2014.7087609","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISOCC.2014.7087609","venue":"2014 International SoC Design Conference (ISOCC)"}

By also performing an analysis based on a model with a bare nucleon state, we find that this two-pole structure is insensitive to the analytic structure of the amplitude in the region below the π N threshold. Our results are M pole = (1363 +9 -6 - i793 +3 -5 ) and (1373 +12 -10 - i 114 +14 -9 ) MeV. We also demonstrate that the number of poles in the 1.5-GeV ≤ W ≤ 2-GeV region could be more than one, depending on how the structure of the single-energy solution of SAID is fitted. For three-pole solutions, our best estimated result of a pole near N(1710) listed by Particle Data Group is (1829 +131 -65 - i192 +88 -110 ) MeV, which is close to the results of several previous analyses. Our results indicate the need for more accurate π N reaction data in the W > 1.6-GeV region for high-precision resonance extractions.","inCitations":["e48d7b62ae46361fb9181878342a074151adb930","4b11bdf417f701c0ed3800a273c059ec903d35a3","169ac8ef367b7d555cbb111d51870077dac3e428"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.pef.uni-lj.si/bojang/Gradiva/SatoLee_PRC_2010.pdf","http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1001.5083","https://arxiv.org/pdf/1001.5083v2.pdf","http://arxiv.org/pdf/1001.5083"],"title":"On the extraction of P11 resonances from pi N data","doi":"10.1103/PhysRevC.81.065207","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevC.81.065207","venue":""}

Herein, we present a more direct and efficient FADH2 regeneration system using the nicotinamide cofactor mimic 1-benzyl-1,4-dihydronicotinamide (BNAH) as the sole reductant. Thus, BNAH replaces two enzymes and the nicotinamide cofactor, resulting in a significantly simplified reaction system.","inCitations":["3283ab51ace6c8a5f5f00db1a405d38e6f551e79","df4c5a43045b7fbcc9afd805775b3d07e49679ec","a5f30b0948ce8a752116276aab884f0525a32884","4a1949cf68a74235846f41e62d2c3153bc0c92c5","af2ff5272293574579f0a97f5403fb7edfdeb2d1","e43f98116803b5b5e59bd698dd87867b079e0d14","684ef087856835938322fdc436d1243e6f005fde","c583eb664239ab3753b48737caaf2856f8dae5a3","b835f60190b8d133c00073fbe065648169f29e07","0fc66e75dc1e0371cfbe3ba2a8297bfdacdce9d7","1abdbc6cecf3b3efdbf35dcb36b1f0c1b3ced5a7","e789a9179718d922d58d1e5a95c3b4c43691b34f","17ab6cdf4e97b65cfa413e98ead571f21210bedc","a626eff530caa81294a0f6f7c809ad1bbd09f96a","b52f0b6c06e52880b1d4c8986b230b6ef98bba15"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Nonenzymatic Regeneration of Styrene Monooxygenase for Catalysis","doi":"10.1021/acscatal.5b00041","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1021/acscatal.5b00041","venue":""}

Educational level was not found related to the service ideal, as shown by support for the service function and a more positive attitude toward the public, or to greater emphasis in exercising discretion. Educational level was found to be related to placing greater value on the importance of ethical conduct, but it was not found to be related to intolerance toward the misconduct of fellow officers. Education also is related to a less parochial organizational identity and insularity because it increases support for lateral entry and decreases support for maintaining organizational secrets.","inCitations":["8052476a502fb7a27ff71ebafd98c4373f94d44c","3ad716159e2237097b68dd81bd02d3ccf692eb61","1d97d0155ace07e6ec42fcd04d21576a5718ea53","5e3f4547f2ed11e12f6aec3e74b1beafd27db0b1","51fbeee796e08e207f0ea71bd0d99e91bee0f9f5","69e9062894149691ee2cb3763452dd46279442e5","8b89eaa86ee657b61c6282c750779f5da28b894a","3acdd95b92f02dbf71c429dd7d1c96f4a314f992","a8712fd9ad1b3c86535c92843c34346100a334d5","9ffa2f40ef281273672bcc7288cec44f43442937","96fa24ecafe1bb4d2bb5644fafe9f9228461b016","cbe06ece7ca5a6fcfd4908ac555a0805f5b75b78","8d6170ca9751d4415e06441335e9d086e1833774","f25f13af6c48fed77326de55b0393f3394fbc149","d3820f326dbaad9fa8d91c1dd715e7e9bcce42d5","bef2fa355d0fd8c166c9d6cc9a7aeaf63ab11484","43dcd1843b080de2074da0ed64a38b62d53b97fc","a93b543ba27035526aeddc7eb221a3176c88e8f7","aa8df7d074396917e1615a2f6fe88441b5e89c64","ea86e94b128ed740a3a381da5be2070618e119d7","4f0812fab0330a66208a64b06e51df00bf5e86a1","22cd8569d70f85ce26f296b55f729e9d566b627a","996214cfb809c81a264c51b7f58eccd3063bfc8f","fab268e07b0ddd7e149b766ac8b58795f8e863e3","c54e8fd7b11ce504ba767311d46b1f8ac254e753","a95ebadb8ef1f06a8cc7b09ef3b1e779528b0db9"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"The Effects of College Education on Professional Attitudes among Police","doi":"10.1080/10511259200082531","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1080/10511259200082531","venue":""}

The average number of nodes obtained during laparoscopy was 10 ± 7.04. As operator experience improved, the number of nodes increased to an average of 11.6 for the last ten node dissections. Likewise, the number of nodes remaining after laparoscopic lymph node dissection fell progressively to an average of 1.7 during the last ten lymphadenectomies. In the preceding 30 standard pelvic lymphadenectomies performed by the authors (control series) an average of 13.4 ± 6.72 nodes were removed surgically prior to radical prostatectomy.

Blood is conveyed in \na closed network composed of 2 circuits in series — the systemic and pulmonary circulation \n—, each constituted by arteries, capillaries, and veins, under the synchronized action of the \nleft and right cardiac pumps, respectively. Air is successively inhaled from and exhaled to the \natmosphere through the airway openings (nose and/or mouth). In the head, blood generates \nthe cerebrospinal fluid in choroid plexi of all compartments of the ventricular system and \nreceives it in arachnoid villi. Other biofluids are either secreted, such as bile from the liver \nand breast milk that both transport released substances with specific tasks, or excreted, \nsuch as urine from kidneys or sweat from skin glands that both convey useless materials and \nwaste produced by the cell metabolism. In addition to the convective transport, peristalsis, \nwhich results from the radial contraction and relaxation of mural smooth muscles, propels \nthe content of the lumen of the muscular bioconduit (e.g., digestive tract) in an anterograde \ndirection. \nBlood circulation and air flow in the respiratory tract are widely explored because of \ntheir vital functions. Note that inhaled air is transported through the respiratory tract by \ntwo processes: convection down to bronchioles and diffusion down to pulmonary alveoli.1 \nFurthermore, investigations of these physiological flows in deformable bioconduits give rise \nto models such as the Starling resistance that themselves become object of new study fields \nin physics and mechanics (e.g., collapsible tubes) as well as of new developments in math- \nematical modeling and scientific computing. Whereas fluid–structure interaction problems \nin aeronautics and civil engineering deal with materials of distinct properties, blood stream \nand vessel wall correspond to two domains of nearly equal physical properties, as both blood \nand vessels have densities close to that of water. New processing strategies must then be \nconceived.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://hal.sorbonne-universite.fr/hal-01393604/file/BiofluHeatTrfCRC16.pdf","https://hal.sorbonne-universite.fr/hal-01393604/document"],"title":"Biofluid Flow and Heat Transfer","doi":"10.1201/b19031-35","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1201/b19031-35","venue":""}

It is thus essential to accurately predict these pressure variations when planning to increase the speed of Shinkansen or Maglev trains. We have developed a one-dimensional flow simulation program to calculate the pressure variations and the wind velocity in a high-speed railway tunnel. This program can perform predictions for tunnels with shafts and/or stations/terminals for train speeds up to about 500 km/h. The simulation results agree well with the results of model experiments.","inCitations":["324f0c29efd73a7bb7c777bf6c44a4689045f2af","f7a055bf8002c7f5f3e726aa0b53bad9c68b3984"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Numerical Simulation of 1-D Unsteady Compressible Flow in Railway Tunnels","doi":"10.1299/jee.6.723","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1299/jee.6.723","venue":""}

(CB1R) was initially identified as the neuronal target of Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the major psychoactive substance of marijuana. This receptor is one of the most abundant G-protein-coupled receptors in the adult brain, the target of endocannabinoid ligands and a well-characterized retrograde synaptic regulator. However, CB1Rs are also highly and often transiently expressed in neuronal populations in the embryonic and early postnatal brain, even before the formation of synapses. This suggests important physiological roles for CB1Rs during neuronal development. Several recent reviews have summarized our knowledge about the role of the endocannabinoid (eCB) system in neurodevelopment and neurotransmission by focusing on the metabolism of endocannabinoid molecules. Here, we review current knowledge about the effects of the modulation of CB1R signaling during the different phases of brain development. More precisely, we focus on reports that directly implicate CB1Rs during progenitor cell migration and differentiation, neurite outgrowth, axonal pathfinding and synaptogenesis. Based on theoretical considerations and on the reviewed experimental data, we propose a new model to explain the diversity of experimental findings on eCB signaling on neurite growth and axonal pathfinding. In our model, cell-autonomus and paracrine eCBs acting on CB1Rs are part of a global inhibitory network of cytoskeletal effectors, which act in concert with positive-feedback local-excitation loops, to ultimately yield highly polarized neurons.","inCitations":["93e0413dd866371ab8628828f183695d14e17d95","e096325c9c1489ddc7517b3eef1147c5902c4b4d","880ac3fd10f2661e01cf2c788db3dc5ce2481c60","5bb9dc1ac6e9d2e429a4e754e1f4c07687d17f96","f96a0995de56b6eb5d7af5f468e4c4eac2747123","223bc3277af8166d49711aa94346d1234632fe39","f0bc15c6d1a08ea192a8cf8560227fa8ebacdef8","a6351b2cd133d6e691f03dee846a63a3e9aef327","5be39401f3430f3ec3b5b69669517fb40fa4326e","73f825be7ee251cfa9ce528af161234eb2905c03","f64ef1d4a8f9adfcb4f2f805987a75b999ffa092","1bb447aa6fbba3e2ea274f3e1307ea2f42a559cc","a2f8e7d0021a44f9a938526a3a131fc7e92090a9","cd942765a88b75a3d19d6368fb293b8c315a2a76","420851a02f2154ffe34036626f33257a75c24c3a","b247ff4be79318a79dd5c3b4ac6f02afd6f4a4ba","9e0b08e062f43ca8321dcf25686c4f93d66612ed","0374566d51cb3f1033c06883430d4e3fa9645042","3a70ae6788496c6498fb3cd1936a9e0ecf2f52f4","d85bac6660c79d92d121260c88e11410aece16d1","c940dfd86747d83603bc096cf420211065f1bd74","8bd65734121465b9aae0ed22e9445d02dca0660f","0677d567a9945a145d8394f60635e33d312d1c7b","65e748c49d13b532f7351ce1edf652525dc18ab6","607f3a531d8473f7c15878715fda89fd3fabbf8a","998b76e375ce77a1ff8514c8dfc88d05e5b89787","ecdcf8a33d1ce86f62d43af7be704ba5b7209a4f","a12e20a1686b18ec8046430cdfafe1ed20442ccb","da5738fb036e3db6586ab203e14dc9c4db2c3640","4b3045488fefcf9a7cc1284f73368eea8a446338","c39d9024d3af112d461936e2acea4dc92b973f21","3809f1a5242a71f453565d7272f0166924331bad","244b88289c6d243fe3c66d590d93f66e4f5daab0","e5c906332024a969eb6f6d1786b2f708b1dc1925","3f8e14c4f883b922f4c615faace0e989295082cf","feb05bb48668bbeb58498ed9941f975a0e3ddf07","0e818e29e83b410c5289dec18053da0a91666810"],"pdfUrls":["https://www.bio.espci.fr/sites/www.bio.espci.fr/IMG/pdf/Gaffuri_2012.pdf","https://www.karger.com/Article/Pdf/339075"],"title":"Type-1 Cannabinoid Receptor Signaling in Neuronal Development","doi":"10.1159/000339075","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1159/000339075","venue":"Pharmacology"}

The reduction of its intake is necessary because of public health problems, such as hypertension.Many are the available techniques and studies already developed on sodium reduction in foods; however, a single and low cost method that does not modify the consumers? acceptance to different food products has notbeen identified. This paper presents a general perspective regarding the functions of sodium in health and foods, the current intake scenario and recommendations in Brazil and other countries, and also some aspects regarding consumer perception when sodium is reduced in different foods. O sodio tem papel fundamental na saude e na producao e palatabilidade dos alimentos, porem as recomendacoes atuais do consumo diario de sodio sao ultrapassadas em muitos paises. A diminuicao de sua ingestao se faz necessaria devido a problemas de saude publica, como a hipertensao. Muitas sao as tecnicas disponiveis e os estudos ja realizados para a diminuicao de sodio nos alimentos, todavia, ainda nao se identificouum metodo unico, de baixo custo e que nao altere a aceitacao dos consumidores e suas propriedades tecnologicas nos diversos produtos alimenticios. O presente trabalho apresenta um panorama geral sobre as funcoes do sodio na saude e nos alimentos, cenario atual de consumo no Brasil e no mundo, recomendacoes em termos de reducao de sodio, alem de aspectos relacionados a percepcao do consumidor ao se reduzir o sodio em diferentes alimentos.","inCitations":["3b56017aef9684cb1e6ca7794de14942efc836f5"],"pdfUrls":["http://sban.cloudpainel.com.br/files/revistas_publicacoes/440.pdf"],"title":"Redução de sódio em alimentos: panorama atual e impactos tecnológicos, sensoriais e de saúde pública","doi":"10.4322/nutrire.2014.034","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.4322/nutrire.2014.034","venue":""}

This approach requires personalised assay design due to the lack of universally mutated genes. In contrast, early methylation alterations are restricted to defined genomic loci allowing comprehensive assay design for population studies. Our objective was to identify cancer-specific methylated biomarkers which could be measured longitudinally in cfDNA (liquid biopsy) to monitor therapeutic outcome in patients with metastatic CRC (mCRC). Design Genome-wide methylation microarrays of CRC cell lines (n=149) identified five cancer-specific methylated loci (EYA4, GRIA4, ITGA4, MAP3K14-AS1, MSC). Digital PCR assays were employed to measure methylation of these genes in tumour tissue DNA (n=82) and cfDNA from patients with mCRC (n=182). Plasma longitudinal assessment was performed in a patient subset treated with chemotherapy or targeted therapy. Results Methylation in at least one marker was detected in all tumour tissue samples and in 156 mCRC patient cfDNA samples (85.7%). Plasma marker prevalence was 71.4% for EYA4, 68.5% for GRIA4, 69.7% for ITGA4, 69.1% for MAP3K14-AS1% and 65.1% for MSC. Dynamics of methylation markers was not affected by treatment type and correlated with objective tumour response and progression-free survival. Conclusion This five-gene methylation panel can be used to circumvent the absence of patient-specific mutations for monitoring tumour burden dynamics in liquid biopsy under different therapeutic regimens. This method might be proposed for assessing pharmacodynamics in clinical trials or when conventional imaging has limitations.","inCitations":["fbd016c598848050c0349ef5dfff147c85f67a0a","74d4c99168d7e049c92e3869a33685d5ee1daa52","904151568d6f03a2074c6270e23cba963db9b235","0d1e7e76b369466968e2c5f74f342f1d2528b89f","66135c0da8624511bcd604f115b6506226be0b21","9a58adc874f9f30bd0d169cc230b258bab3fc3c7","0b277e53a6d3dcd6282079e5ac60e769f8aa3595","ba430e0b37e7ee97797619541ee9abb12a1d4aaa","0f94378eb2401015b97d46cbe1fd03ac791f4b3c","fc6c36d95722721fc40a44db21ee35efd6be4f43","dc263b753b0eb6ae515930e1f5a7f17a9ec3e02f","8e083474099a2b8641e368f4634c184717be870b","a926e56021ac68fd7003a9d4c0fc3b44ac1b8302","9b82449019f41fed47a4c5d60079026970242f4b","8c116752e99d09397769c56375effd12ba378aaa","d758f97608d3f09f4bdf62bf9c562c498af8dbf0","e49520521aa7e16191a5c904de47a74aa97a4b61","d17c7437521581b0317fd96adea6599f35e449b6","0c13ea759be5e501ed5e681d2a0905881fba0acc","0be5ab816aba7e02f03f4ea4900a1818d7ee0d07","c1746cea1a7da9e9418e5ccb83029b3a88e238f3","6495bf645cfc44ab94eacae3ad4756dc6f61a45a","ffbfdc3839229b13fb1a3a32a91a5a7cc7038c96","3a0df55fdb33cc8078e3a2a737340b8cdd3938a6","c5a8f99abdbc93b0682206536e1567121521a9bf","fc2186311798dee52fb59e908aeab28a42d62e00","cf3b2ce53ea88cc2640a66da3383e7aa5516cc60","80fef442075afbde45438f145f56e14501f8dacd","120c578361b799cfff10076a0da89b93b91b89e8","4a0b8233d07df59910af90bcbeb8c8cb0221aa56","8ed760ee6ca4ac1c77f11443d952cd49e2c8c605","5fd7da93d3eb7800f22cbcaf4744fb245687ba52","468346f1e9c1f474d5fe51cc7dec0405fdec2ffa","d77f45f1c85c92b012eee34cb8007963709ff999","a6beb12ec38e491b88efe2ea70c91627f8d06c36","67156cb733bf5bffe687e739835299a3318bac2a"],"pdfUrls":["https://iris.unito.it/retrieve/handle/2318/1650175/383405/Gut%20post%20print%20+%20copert%20for%20IRIS.pdf"],"title":"Discovery of methylated circulating DNA biomarkers for comprehensive non-invasive monitoring of treatment response in metastatic colorectal cancer","doi":"10.1136/gutjnl-2016-313372","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1136/gutjnl-2016-313372","venue":"Gut"}

Methylphenidate (MPH) blocks dopamine and norepinephrine transporters causing an increase in extracellular levels. The use of psychomotor stimulants continues to rise due to both the treatment of ADHD and illicit abuse. Methylphenidate sensitization mechanism has still poor knowledge. Neuronal calcium sensor 1 was identified as a dopaminergic receptor interacting protein. When expressed in mammalian cells, neuronal calcium sensor 1 attenuates dopamine-induced D2 receptor internalization by a mechanism that involves a reduction in D2 receptor phosphorylation. Neuronal calcium sensor 1 appears to play a pivotal role in regulating D2 receptor function, it will be important to determine if there are alterations in neuronal calcium sensor 1 in neuropathologies associated with deregulation in dopaminergic signaling. Then, we investigated if methylphenidate could alter neuronal calcium sensor 1 expression in five brain regions (striatum, hippocampus, prefrontal cortex, cortex and cerebellum) in young and adult rats. These regions were chosen because some are located in brain circuits related with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Our results showed changes in neuronal calcium sensor 1 expression in hippocampus, prefrontal cortex and cerebellum mainly in adult rats. The demonstration that methylphenidate induces changes in neuronal calcium sensor 1 levels in rat brain may help to understand sensitization mechanisms as well as methylphenidate therapeutic effects to improve attention deficit hyperactivity disorder symptoms.","inCitations":["8779abb780e0a8dfa45795b48113439723d80ba5","4a989e631c760c15699ea18c4a11a9f125022314","d4add8e0a8b774929df6181ed37ae01578668df7","e600f90919cba0456cb2c48b73839beebaea6be3","ef72c14b807b262d773c090af0cb6b59d3a62ee7","8399ef90417026b63510b22eb9b976fb70e7d1c1"],"pdfUrls":["https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0197018608000703","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0197018608000703?dgcid=api_sd_search-api-endpoint"],"title":"Methylphenidate alters NCS-1 expression in rat brain","doi":"10.1016/j.neuint.2008.04.007","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuint.2008.04.007","venue":"Neurochemistry International"}

They are poised to expand their role in medical education. This systematic review, conducted in accordance with PRISMA guidelines, aimed to synthesize current serious gaming trends in health care training, especially those pertaining to developmental methodologies and game evaluation. PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases were queried for relevant documents published through December 2014. Of the 3737 publications identified, 48 of them, covering 42 serious games, were included. From 2007 to 2014, they demonstrate a growth from 2 games and 2 genres to 42 games and 8 genres. Overall, study design was heterogeneous and methodological quality by MERQSI score averaged 10.5/18, which is modest. Seventy-nine percent of serious games were evaluated for training outcomes. As the number of serious games for health care training continues to grow, having schemas that organize how educators approach their development and evaluation is essential for their success.","inCitations":["98136155e9f3a862e4521e73b0fb8b93de9f73af","11d82e69e078ae0cd63b7cba5743b3ffe5037950","b65b0ad5981826394776bbb09084269adeb3c11a","402aa1dc93113179976910d4879c0eb3038b831a","bd68ac4745ca8dcbebe4cfe9083b2dc9353f8c7b","da795b2a6e516ebfae9a0913b87089c41ac8b75b","7530bae41d65dd9f19ccd9ae798f772fbeb9209e","fae05180176a71650827c905e23c13c46867d11c","8fae743ce24656a1f7bc4fee95b69ac49832b6ac","7eb875b9f814e4906273d67d3135b7c3062135e2","74e31c5a765a2fd4ffac1c8906cf7c1082107d70","0bdf6c9aef4db6b65d3ecf36e9eda6115985f736","8e4506e6630d0b3002713989fe37ef53189f3090","b44231c09b03008559c1f1cec4a927fcfed4edcb","0282f5820e87ac5d54b734437d8e51d0c86792bf","2e09fd0e11415bad2d2a4e7e5cdcf2bb1f93d033","31a3696615e2326062109501c6efe4e889b0bc2b","3776fac7f477397916e4f20fadc32af67c18ab9d","918895ad49f3e6f7c792eae332430c04a9efadab","2d808e492a849d9faadd9911fe2e7fb65773c690","fd83df1aab91dfc27790bfccaa7a8725a9450df9","388ef683983fdf42360a7093eca3c9971bef88ae","3f96cdc2094b85cf77453cf6b3c7bc4e93a4d913","c935eb1f53fb93474a992b2ef7142ae371d184e5","af0dad2bb2e5d189c126254506964882776dc2ce","0c4a77f5fe74b6dd5e5a1bffdf8aabfd6480e329","ff11c202ee69206efe3a497686d63cdc6e9a6be2","4b56456bacd4aeea4f7b605912a390afd4b96e20","68a07a793871107a3deabd39a94a024a3b21b3bb","58d0952a31e324be462067271fd8808c22d3d468","0628c0097f04c2aaf371a6725150126055e8831f","23e846c1fa2a254bb7d5c6b371b59163d69ece6f","2ef324127fdcdf7e789ce36ee475eca66e940a6b","9683415f2dd66910cbce180f1e04a739587e9df5","de9c5ce8976fb6368b1cf80fdd3ae0c0cdecb961","a4b9a87a06ec66cb94bc288ad79180a754923ed3","583cb40666b39aa26f5bdf9568da3716d14313f2","74e743498c3b00ba3442f9804def4eb67b365c5d","51cdcb81681871abcc12a571fb5ddeb052a58f15","26046395795dd94fda1bd0ace3695a6dc8bba2c1","d83166d5addeda4e1eed0145405b5316b9b66333","c8d4a0ccff2996f693c89896cf29ea41a31c9cae","fe10e3add79def20476bb1af881bef1b3f45ac73","9570a615e108541aa9b319fa019e4bc2b5857796","94d9cdbd4c724f56d51724a6a2b8be48edcd05b6","7bd20106b46a9028368ec41240508e9152962721","93a843ebf4cfc8699219fcf39bec45c465cc935d","7975aebb396ebaa01e9053eee81b7513687294f0","bbed2296f7bb98b0104b5fbc58197ccab7d623e3","b39195adc6a3e2307c51d932c97ab7b6ea646fb5","27eebe667af25f7bac750a47a3f6340607fe60da","18a766f78e2acbce0adc079d216f8b0f98c285b1","4feccbcb146f28ebd3421bf61e8cf2d29bc61f54","f841c32094c953a829a296053a617fd26e13be91","821f7cf133d46bf6ef94bc35a27fd2e3fe75e5fb","b18beebb0320e0c30e50439c3058d2edae9ceb98","870a839e9b38b728f4bd8db67cb422f3126ddecf","ac7762026a234a11cccb3d87898ed3e89ea3e1df","b50ef9704fd7cd1a80ff0b6502801c4783566b38","66869e3ce65e4a52dcf5b421681f4e7a81fe6391"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"A Systematic Review of Serious Games in Training Health Care Professionals.","doi":"10.1097/SIH.0000000000000118","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1097/SIH.0000000000000118","venue":"Simulation in healthcare : journal of the Society for Simulation in Healthcare"}

El 82 X 100 de las muestras esta contaminada con bacterias coliformes totales, el 20 X 100 esta contaminada con E. coli y el 11 X 100 con Staphylococcus aureus. Los analisis fisico-quimicos indican un promedio del contenido de grasa de un 3.46 X 100. El 100 X 100 no presenta adulteracion con agua, segun el punto de congelacion. Un 18,16 X 100 de las muestras, esta descremada, debido a que esta por encima del limite de la densidad (g/ml) y el 2.27 X 100 esta adulterada con agua. Los solidos no grasos son mayores al 8 X 100 en todas las muestras, por lo que estan aptas para su consumo; el 2,27 X 100 de las muestras, no llega al minimo de proteina estipulado. El 43.13X 100 de las muestras presenta alta incidencia en celulas somaticas (mastitis y la mala higiene en el ordeno) siendo no apta para el consumo.En la prueba de acidez, el 18.18 X 100 de las muestras sobrepasa el limite superior, por lo que no es apta para su consumo; y de la prueba de alcohol, el 100 X 100 dio negativo, siendo apta para el consumo, segun las normas COGUANOR, MAGA y RTCA","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Diagnóstico de la calidad higiénica y parámetros físico-químicos de la leche de vaca en los expendios de la cabecera departamental de Retalhuleu","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Designs have been considered for improving cycling safety at roundabouts, including cycle lanes, underpasses, special crossings, etc. It has been claimed that there are safety benefits in signalizing roundabouts, and this article investigates cycle accidents at these junctions. The objective was to explore the relationship between accident rates and the signalizing of roundabouts to see if there was any evidence that the installation of signals led to a change in the numbers of all accidents. The methodology of the study is briefly outlined.","inCitations":["1fbdbcabce9142afdca10cd6b0a0a4dbf505eda7","a18a18a25f5d473e3b5eecaebb0de58b94138c78"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Cycle accidents at signalised roundabouts","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}
