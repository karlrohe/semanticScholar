These regions had different policies on screening for congenital anomalies (CAs) and on pregnancy termination.\n\n\nPOPULATION OR SAMPLE\nBirths 22-31 weeks gestational age.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThe analysis compares the proportion of TOP among very preterm births and assesses differences in mortality between the regions.\n\n\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES\nPregnancy outcomes (termination, antepartum death, intrapartum death and live birth) and reasons for termination, presence of CAs and causes of death for stillbirths and live births in 2003.\n\n\nRESULTS\nPregnancy terminations constituted between 1 and 21.5% of all very preterm births and between 4 and 53% of stillbirths. Most terminations were for CAs, although some were for obstetric indications (severe pre-eclampsia, growth restriction, premature rupture of membranes). TOP contributed substantially to overall fetal mortality rates in the two regions with late second-trimester screening. There was no clear association between policies governing screening and pregnancy termination and the proportion of CAs among stillbirths and live births, except in Poland, where neonatal deaths associated with CAs were more frequent, reflecting restrictive pregnancy termination policies.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nProportions of TOP among very preterm births varied widely between European regions. Information on terminations should be reported when very preterm live births and stillbirths are compared internationally since national policies related to screening for CAs and the legality and timing of medical terminations differ.","inCitations":["933405d886eb9ab123faf8851ac18941a3a44721","62cea5ea216673d6fb5effbcf92003047af74c7c","2985ffdda420b5a8a41bc23a139db3d5d3399568","037ed3b55011f9c00f21158efc610bdc13c15e3a","62d953dd4a1e5ad79d9959ef9ec898de0b3576c0","77e3069faf12d026a779ef073af33c3e749746fb","8eb4773be0ff7f493cf46ae7feb94c55ee0fcd97","d423e1b35b619317ac1fe4d6e5fbaa2f9b6a16c7","bd28ad3d8ac3c8c198a4fec144e1f0b3485ae74b","7f1ca423f81729f59d89f420dc108e4141940f47","589b8c90f7dc119bf1b1e78882984320b63d2cac","1bc973ad8ec1c1cdc2744ec397f42569b83d531f","52c615e47984a1c27da43b0f3085c96e214aa4dc","b35ed5b353f1e031a42e6c63cce30efea2dd712d","77b43d1ac3d875900dca9a2f1efa65f2879eba4c","99612e5ca73b0204399a977924a0d0ba1e5bc9c0","e5f937fe52f86cc0fa341fefeb0e3bc296bed6ed","f6bdc83d2cf4ea2f067ee695a3a0b73f76b7da5a","abbca563c0ff284a23195ffc7684e616f4c70509","951c5025da0fd90846769fcee5226cae159b2b31","a68a6990e3a924963b0c148754b22244e3521400","8b6b67294eb16a42f912ce57fa2883a893264c90","56834eaf847bbcfbba815bed4837890db2bb4f9c","484d1c0b3b9e60ca8845382253ed1f80d3329e4c","97276cbed35edad32422bdafe3af837843aedf09","1d984188f9f257d0dd59b7bf20b1c63c0e7e9fbd","7a1cb3565736b8a2dc4256dbcb9fb34db9c77a35","2aa55aed3d228489dcf18c20a162d598428b98a6","a34d8ab3869eb8999672b028c914c36ea72caba5","8d12a1d49cb2e5b9b36a729f736d700e0c2a384d","09dbc04179a8f7f878437a2935472dbc7cc9f384","b3f07f7dac4ea6b8e272b86bf18e529b21bfb258","b33b673778ad8b11a08a8040acd9d2e77544e19e","6e277473eb1aebdbc783d650f33711dee41e89e5","8b98571ea668e258a9b2fb0b61fc638206dd4613","11bcdab9673f8853a9f701ed97bca3e1405d33ff","0fb1c3020bcaa4a58ce3c9f3b0c9e60d076a707e","84acdfa005fc38d2bb696f3696d8bb9dde557f0b"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Termination of pregnancy among very preterm births and its impact on very preterm mortality: results from ten European population-based cohorts in the MOSAIC study.","doi":"10.1111/j.1471-0528.2007.01611.x","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1471-0528.2007.01611.x","venue":"BJOG : an international journal of obstetrics and gynaecology"}

However, the current techniques lack the efficiency required by Wright Laboratories. Two noted dependencies between turbine engine fan pressure ratio, bypass ratio, high pressure compressor pressure ratio and overall engine mass flow allows for a reduction in the number of independent design variables searched in the optimization process. Additionally, through the use of spatial statistics (specifically kriging estimation), it is possible to significantly reduce the number of time consuming response function evaluations required to obtain an optimal combination of engine parameters. A micro Genetic Algorithm (microGA) is employed to perform the non linear optimization process with these two computation saving techniques. Optimal engine solutions were obtained. in 25 percent of the time required by previous automated search algorithms.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Improving algorithmic efficiency of aircraft engine design for optimal mission performance.

Rubredoxin is an iron-containing protein which serves as an electron carrier in bacterial enzyme systems. This red protein is isolated first from Clostridium pasteurianum and later from several other anaerobic organisms. No specific function is known for this protein in anaerobic organisms. A similar protein is isolated from Pseudomonas oleovorans . In this organism, rubredoxin functions as an electron carrier in the ω-hydroxylation system. There is no common and specific biochemical assay for the rubredoxins, and the rubredoxin content of extracts is generally monitored during isolation by absorbancy at 490 nm. A biochemical procedure, which is used, is the reduction of cytochrome c by nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate reduced (NADPH), spinach ferredoxin-NADP reductase, and limiting amounts of rubredoxin. The procedures used primarily for the purification of the protein from clostridial organisms are described. The steps for the isolation of the more complex rubredoxin from P. oleovorans are outlined in the chapter.","inCitations":["7096647b012afbd9962bc1008f83bb3e664b7b74"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"[42] Clostridial rubredoxin","doi":"10.1016/0076-6879(72)24093-9","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/0076-6879%2872%2924093-9","venue":""}

Apart from knowledge regarding conventional breeding methodologies it provides necessary information regarding co-evolutionary process between plant and pollinators which is helpful further for conserving endangered ornamental plant species by protecting the plant specific pollinators. Plants and their pollinators form a mutualistic relationship, a relationship in which each benefits from the other. Though most of the flowers provides reward in form of pollen, scent, nectar etc. but deceptive systems can also be found among a diverse group of plants, the flowers of which signal the presence of a resource without providing it. Deceptive flowers have accordingly evolved the ability to emit signals that trigger obligate innate responses in the targeted insects.

Basic language primitives and solid type discipline based on session types are established as a foundation for communication-based concurrent programming. The main theorems for the type system are formalized. Authors also show how proposed primitives can be used to express well-known communication patterns, applied in the programming languages, such as call-return and method invocation. At first the authors give a brief overview of the existing approaches for software based on communication,thus showing the need and importance of a new concept. It is pointed out that neither of the approaches provides a clear and concise way to express a series of reciprocal interactions between two parties. Such communications are expressed as series of distinct interactions, which leads to less code readability and concurrency bugs. The theory of session types aims to brings that gap.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~rn710/Summary_BinarySessionTypes.pdf"],"title":"Summary of Language primitives and type disciplines for structured communication-based programming","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Although most human infections result in no or mild flu-like symptoms, the elderly and those with a weakened immune system are at higher risk for developing severe neurological disease. Since its introduction into North America in 1999, WNV has spread across the continental United States and caused annual outbreaks with a total of 36,000 documented clinical cases and ∼1,500 deaths. In recent years, outbreaks of neuroinvasive disease also have been reported in Europe. The WNV strains isolated during these outbreaks differ from those in North America, as sequencing has revealed that distinct phylogenetic lineages of WNV concurrently circulate in Europe, which has potential implications for the development of vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostic tests. Here, we studied the human antibody response to European WNV strains responsible for outbreaks in Italy and Greece in 2010, caused by lineage 1 and 2 strains, respectively. The WNV structural proteins were expressed as a series of overlapping fragments fused to a carrier-protein, and binding of IgG in sera from infected persons was analyzed. The results demonstrate that, although the humoral immune response to WNV in humans is heterogeneous, several dominant peptides are recognized.","inCitations":["2bbbb24b0a3ee202e3bc5724a73e1cd09d64764c","cdfeff89da50f182bf90937a170a9ebca765ce87","acc16bc104c7ca224314d60b7551ace29090f78c","61538d1955d3ebb7c1af45ea9b63fa0bbe488dfe","bd53ed355b19e870bd3685c2493b2276fe1cae6f","2571ad0d1123b2d8da6deef71ab35c84c0bb3d1d","5cbab5757b969d59af7ab8a5b925dc8611bd9931","7d71519b764438105aec42d6df9e0492c8bd0153","15ecd53a00185f70be3f961ff7d1648e937236a4"],"pdfUrls":["http://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/pmc/39/c2/pone.0066507.PMC3680493.pdf","http://digitalcommons.wustl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2574&context=open_access_pubs","https://digitalcommons.wustl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2574&context=open_access_pubs","http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0066507&type=printable","http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0066507.s001&type=supplementary"],"title":"Antibody Responses in Humans Infected with Newly Emerging Strains of West Nile Virus in Europe","doi":"10.1371/journal.pone.0066507","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0066507","venue":"PloS one"}

Regression on closed-form functions of time produces a time-varying FPS or ER. Evaluation of these functions at a specified time point produces a system characterization for that instant. In an important subset of surgical procedures, the procedure itself poses a significant threat to the patient's nervous system. In order to reduce this threat, neurophysiological function of the structures at risk may be monitored during surgery using time locked sensory or motor ER's. By fitting polynomial functions of time to capture time variations in the evoked response, /sup SIGNAL//sub NOISE/ enhancement comparable to that of averaging is obtained. More importantly a considerable improvement in time resolution is gained.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Instantaneous characterization of time-varying systems [neurological surgery]","doi":"10.1109/IEMBS.1995.579738","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEMBS.1995.579738","venue":"Proceedings of 17th International Conference of the Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society"}

Oral language, phonological processing skills, naming speed and alphabetic knowledge are now considered to be important precursors to reading learning in the early ages as they have a high correlation with decoding processes and initial learning Of written language, however, has not been established when it has begun its development. The purpose of this study was to analyze the moment when the precursor reading skills present a higher incidence in reading learning in the early ages in order to clarify the best period to begin teaching. A longitudinal quasi-experimental study was carried out in 432 children from 5 to 7 years of age. Data analysis was performed using a mixed ANOVA of repeated measures, which included three factors: assessment (6 measures), group and sex. The results show an improvement of the participants in all variables analyzed from the first year of intervention that is maintained during the following two years. The effects of the program support the development of teaching models that integrate these variables for the improvement of the learning of the reading, reason why it is suggested its inclusion in the curricular objectives of the first ages.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://rua.ua.es/dspace/bitstream/10045/71522/2/2017_Gutierrez-Fresneda_etal_RevEdu_eng.pdf","http://www.educacionyfp.gob.es/revista-de-educacion/dam/jcr:8cc3899e-19b4-4dff-ae02-90090907321e/02gutierrez-pdf.pdf","https://rua.ua.es/dspace/bitstream/10045/71522/1/2017_Gutierrez-Fresneda_etal_RevEdu_esp.pdf","https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/94142424.pdf"],"title":"Longitudinal study on learning to read in early ages","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

When defining criteria for intervention, it was necessary first to establish what needs are required to be addressed and then to define a methodology of intervention while considering indicators of quality and indicators of best practice. The aim is to contribute to a successful conservation approach, in order to better address threats. The research methodology of this investigation was based in a case study strategy using qualitative methods. Data were collected using documentary, questionnaire and interview methods from three sources, the case studies, the stakeholders and a selected group of international key-experts in earthen built heritage conservation. Seven key components were identified for the methodology of intervention and the criteria for intervention were examined through three types of approach: descriptive, evaluative, and prescriptive A serious lack of understanding was found among experts in conservation of the meaning and need for a methodology of intervention in conservation and the meaning or need for devising criteria for conservation intervention.","inCitations":["5e8b00c532a9c25091d44a65c1283eb039315672","710417469c10ff4104d1c634521eb84ce35f7ae8","5d4224931b2ec023a1e511c6fea00a2c8da70aec","83a7944117637a5e7ff4e23fe67c45c459220c85"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Defining Criteria for Intervention in Earthen-Built Heritage Conservation","doi":"10.1080/15583058.2012.704478","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1080/15583058.2012.704478","venue":""}

On the one hand, serotonin (5-HT) receptors regulate the effects of dopamine agonists on several levels, ranging from molecular signaling to behavior. These interactions include 5-HT receptor-mediated facilitation of dopamine receptor-induced gene regulation in striatal output pathways, which involves the 5-HT1B receptor and others. Conversely, there is evidence that dopamine action by psychostimulants regulates 5-HT1B receptor expression in the striatum. To further investigate the effects of dopamine and agonists on 5-HT receptors, we assessed the expression of 5-HT1B and other serotonin receptor subtypes in the striatum after unilateral dopamine depletion by 6-OHDA and subsequent treatment with L-DOPA (5 mg/kg; 4 weeks). Neither dopamine depletion nor L-DOPA treatment produced significant changes in 5-HT2C, 5-HT4, or 5-HT6 receptor expression in the striatum. In contrast, the 6-OHDA lesion caused a (modest) increase in 5-HT1B mRNA levels throughout the striatum. Moreover, repeated L-DOPA treatment markedly further elevated 5-HT1B expression in the dopamine-depleted striatum, an effect that was most robust in the sensorimotor striatum. A minor L-DOPA-induced increase in 5-HT1B expression was also seen in the intact striatum. These changes in 5-HT1B expression mimicked changes in the expression of neuropeptide markers (dynorphin, enkephalin mRNA) in striatal projection neurons. After repeated L-DOPA treatment, the severity of L-DOPA-induced dyskinesias and turning behavior was positively correlated with the increase in 5-HT1B expression in the associative, but not sensorimotor, striatum ipsilateral to the lesion, suggesting that associative striatal 5-HT1B receptors may play a role in L-DOPA-induced behavioral abnormalities.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Selective Regulation of 5-HT1B Serotonin Receptor Expression in the Striatum by Dopamine Depletion and Repeated L-DOPA Treatment: Relationship to L-DOPA-Induced Dyskinesias","doi":"10.1007/s12035-019-01739-x","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s12035-019-01739-x","venue":"Molecular Neurobiology"}

Msx2 expression patterns in limb development strongly suggest an important role for Msx2 in the AER. Our previous studies identified a 348-bp fragment of the chicken Msx2 gene with AER enhancer activity. In this study, the functions of four potential homeodomain binding TAAT sites in this enhancer were studied using transgenic mice and in vitro protein-DNA interactions. Transgenic studies indicate that the four TAAT sites are not redundant and that only the B-TAAT site is critical for AER enhancer activity. The expression patterns of Msx2 and Dlx5 genes in the AER suggest that they might be involved in the regulation of Msx2. In support of this hypothesis, we found that Msx2 and Dlx5 can bind to the B-TAAT site as well as to a fragment containing the D- and E-TAAT sites in the Msx2 AER enhancer sequences.

This review describes and compares the pharmacology of the beta(2)-agonists and explains how these differences translate into differences in efficacy and beta(2)-adrenergic-mediated adverse effects. Questions commonly asked by clinicians regarding the efficacy and safety of short- and long-acting beta(2)-agonists include issues about cardiovascular effects, tolerance to their bronchodilator and bronchoprotective effects, blunting of albuterol response by long-acting beta(2)-agonists, potential masking of worsening asthma control, and the role of long-acting beta(2)-agonists as adjunctive therapy with inhaled corticosteroids in maintaining asthma control. Pharmacogenetics may play a role in determining which patients may be at risk for a reduced response to a beta(2)-agonist. The continued use of racemic albuterol, which contains a mixture of R-albuterol and S-albuterol, has been questioned because of data from preclinical and clinical studies suggesting that S-albuterol causes proinflammatory effects and may increase bronchial hyperreactivity. The preclinical and clinical effects of these two stereoisomers are reviewed. Data describing the efficacy and safety of levalbuterol (R-albuterol) and racemic albuterol are presented.","inCitations":["18eb6e61afd8a4510d219f6bd0e8f4d3b2543e6e","f33526e192ed5838d66da51e3aa3f4be67c173ee","2fa780bb6d69eb15dcfb634a7a9ef3c8c5506fe5","8affa1d9a71b20dcde283eca22a1491eb6c81a19","f7213ded49d598e693344947392fcb7a543730fc","3391c5ccae7f0ac1d11e7c8dea23b9df50e6b761"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Risk versus benefit considerations for the beta(2)-agonists.","doi":"","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"Pharmacotherapy"}

It must be differentiated from non-painful phantom phenomena, residual-limb pain, and non-painful residual-limb phenomena. Central changes seem to be a major determinant of phantom-limb pain; however, peripheral and psychological factors may contribute to it. A comprehensive model of phantom-limb pain is presented that assigns major roles to pain occurring before the amputation and to central as well as peripheral changes related to it. So far, few mechanism-based treatments for phantom-limb pain have been proposed. Most published reports are based on anecdotal evidence. Interventions targeting central changes seem promising. The prevention of phantom-limb pain by peripheral analgesia has not yielded consistent results.

For each defective pixel present between the first target pixel and the second target pixel, an interpolation value is calculated. Further, for each pair of the first target pixel and the second target pixel, a weight coefficient is calculated. The technique stores such plurality of interpolation values and weight coefficients.

LTBP-1, 3, and 4 covalently bind latent TGF-β and modulate tissue levels of this potent cytokine through regulation of its secretion, localization, and/or activation. To address LTBP function in vivo, we generated Ltbp-3 null mice. Ltbp-3 −/− animals developed craniofacial abnormalities due to early ossification of the skull base synchondroses and displayed reduced body size. In addition, histological examination of Ltbp-3 −/− skeletons revealed an increase in bone mass. The osteoblast numbers and mineral apposition rates were decreased in Ltbp-3 −/− mice, whereas the osteoclast numbers were similar in null and wild type mice. Histological examination revealed persistence of cartilage remnants in Ltbp-3 −/− trabecular bone. Taken together, these results indicate that the Ltbp-3 −/− high bone mass phenotype was due to a defect in bone resorption. We hypothesize that lack of Ltbp-3 results in decreased levels of TGF-β in bone and cartilage, which leads to compromised osteoclast function and decreased bone turnover.","inCitations":["389e4a2cb049726cda9010ce6fdcc46df1ce6610","160cf075de8aa3ce39f99ba4700d9cabede6eb38","1b0f5ac52c2137423eff8cf3663b3efae843d4f0"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Osteopetrosis-like phenotype in latent TGF-β binding protein 3 deficient mice","doi":"10.1016/j.bone.2005.02.021","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bone.2005.02.021","venue":""}

The filtered vorticity transport has been formulated using diffusion-velocity method and then solved using the vortex method. The methodology has been tested on a spatially growing mixing layer using the two-dimensional vortex-in-cell method in conjunction with both Smagorinsky and dynamic eddy viscosity subgrid scale models for an anisotropic flow. The transport equation for filtered probability density function is solved using the Lagrangian Monte-Carlo method. The unresolved subgrid scale convective term in filtered density function transport is modelled using the gradient diffusion model. The unresolved subgrid scale mixing term is modelled using the modified Curl model. The effects of subgrid scale models on the vorticity contours, mean streamwise velocity profiles, root-mean-square velocity and vorticity fluctuations profiles and negative cross-stream correlations are discussed. Also the characteristics of the passive scalar, i.e. mean concentration profiles, root-mean-square concentration fluctuations profiles and filtered probability density function are presented and compared with previous experimental and numerical works. The sensitivity of the results to the Schmidt number, constant in mixing frequency and inflow boundary conditions are discussed.

Considering the limited bandwidth available for mobile streaming and different device requirements, this study presented a network and device-aware Quality of Service (QoS) approach that provides multimedia data suitable for a terminal unit environment via interactive mobile streaming services, further considering the overall network environment and adjusting the interactive transmission frequency and the dynamic multimedia transcoding, to avoid the waste of bandwidth and terminal power. Finally, this study realized a prototype of this architecture to validate the feasibility of the proposed method.

However, the functional significance of these abnormalities is unknown at present. In the present study, we evaluated the relationship between the presence of pontine lacunae and postural stability measured by stabilometry. A total of 209 consecutive patients without neurological signs were divided into three groups according to the territory of lacunae on magnetic resonance imaging: (1) non-lacunar group, (2) pontine lacunar group, and (3) non-pontine lacunar group. Stabilometry was performed and statokinesigram measures including each Romberg quotient were compared among the three groups. Using multivariate analysis, postural stability was found to be disturbed in the pontine lacunar group compared with the other groups. The data of stabilometry in this group were compatible with disturbance of the central controlling system for keeping postural stability. Pontine lacuna is associated with patients with postural instability. This result may be related to the deterioration of the central coordination system for posture and locomotion.","inCitations":["1de684965731fc600c7dacda74e245bc7cd14ea0","2f61ddbca13f6566a1957a4281edb22d7b6a221d"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Association of Pontine Small Infarction (Lacuna) with Disturbance of Postural Stability","doi":"10.1159/000077064","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1159/000077064","venue":"European Neurology"}

To steer by its beams is therefore impossible, and when the dark spell is on them men of genius are, it is said, much like other people, (Orlando, 207-8) VIRGINIA WOOLF, THROUGH much of her life, considered Thomas Carlyle this lighthouse genius. Carlyle, as seer and prophet, was a colossus who represented the writer of genius, the literary icon of the nineteenth century. Woolf's particular vision of him is that he would hole up in his sound-proof room, then suddenly emerge with roaring manifestos for the rest of humankind. It is this very soundproof room, constructed at the top of Carlyle's house in Chelsea to insulate him from any outside disruptions, that becomes in A Room of One's Own (1929) a symbol of male privilege. As Woolf asserts, for the female writer \"to have a room of her own, let alone a quiet room or a sound-proof room, was out of the question ...\" (49). When Woolf's Orlando \"visited Carlyle's sound-proof room at Chelsea\" she/he concluded sarcastically \"that genius since it needed all this coddling must be growing very delicate\" (291). Carlyle's sound-proof room, the emblem of the genius in the tower, is what Woolf deplores in her A Room of One's Own. The lighthouse genius, epitomized by Carlyle, is contrary, capricious, impossible to steer by--nevertheless, we are still drawn toward it. It is my contention that Carlyle as lighthouse genius impacted Woolf personally and professionally, as she was both attracted and repelled by this icon of Victorianism. The trick for Woolf was not to be just a moth drawn to the light, not to experience a fatal attraction. I do not assert that Woolf merely rebelled against Carlyle and all that he stood for--she did not, after all, advocate bombing the sound-proof room. Instead, she maintained that each woman should have one as well. Woolf is not just a rebellious child, throwing tantrums because she is denied access to where the important people go, only to re-embrace male tradition as she matures. It's not that simple. She used Carlyle as a swimmer does a wall of the pool: to push herself off, further, faster. As a child, Woolf had been burdened with a specific, sculptured notion of genius, reinforced by her father, Leslie Stephen, who piled on book after heavy book for her to read. Woolf's life was spent crawling out from underneath. Her father tutored her extensively in all the great nineteenth-century writers, most notably Carlyle, who was a dominating figure in her adolescent years. Stephen even read Carlyle's The French Revolution aloud to Virginia and sister Vanessa when they were children (\"Impressions,\" 128). In 1895, one of the articles Virginia wrote for the family newspaper, the Hyde Park Gate News, is \"a long and competent report of a meeting held at the Mansion House with the object of rescuing Carlyle's house in Chelsea `from the tooth of time'\" (Bell, 37). Virginia was just thirteen. At age fifteen she was reading Carlyle's Reminiscences, The French Revolution, Oliver Cromwell, and The Life of Sterling, as well as Froude's controversial biography of Carlyle (Bell, 50-51). By the time she was twenty she had read \"masses of Carlyle\" (Diary I: 310), including The French Revolution and Reminiscences, and Froude's biography of Carlyle. It is not surprising that Stephen directed his daughter to read Carlyle, for Stephen was a Carlyle devotee and considered himself one of the fortunate few to have the opportunity to have frequent talks with the then elderly Carlyle. As the editor of the Dictionary of National Biography, Stephen wrote the essay on Carlyle himself, afraid that no one else could do him justice (Selected Letters, 317). Carlyle often was critical of Stephen when they conversed, but apparently Stephen took it all in stride, like the disciple he was (Selected Letters, 126-27). …","inCitations":["e022d9912f0d90a9330059fd0f9274feb2196ae2","b994f7605ae8d8a149e4928cb8971950dbb13fd2","7ed07ccb1e941d3bdc55a4b2bf013dbbab6ac786"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Getting to the Lighthouse: Virginia Woolf and Thomas Carlyle","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

The BIAcore biosensor which was employed was based on surface plasmon resonance detection. One commercial antibody against ampicillin which had much higher affinity for open beta-lactam ring than for closed ring was chosen. Two different pre-treatments were tested prior to the biosensor assay to open the ring in order to increase the assay sensitivity. These two ways were enzymatic (penicillinase) and chemical pre-treatment of the samples. Limits of detection for ampicillin in milk were 33 and 12.5 μg l −1 after enzymatic and chemical pre-treatment, respectively. There were no cross-reactions with cephalosporins and other families of antibiotics or proteins in the buffer and in milk after both the pre-treatments. Percentages of cross-reactivity with nine tested penicillins were often clearly higher in milk than in buffer. Moreover, a lack of sensitivity after penicillinase pre-treatment was observed. Conversely, penicillins G and penicillins M could be detected at or below their respective MRLs (4 and 30 μg l −1 in milk) and ampicillin and amoxicillin could be detected only at about three MRLs after chemical pre-treatment. However, the enzymatic pre-treatment was much easier to perform and led to more stable results.","inCitations":["40e2bdce8c0418ca6e05e76221cf3c9b0eec2a17","0be70372f52672aaec4ed903c952f306ef78b996","08120619141fa0e9d26a0e4fc0d5056da4e2ccf7","94695e9d272c4dc529085013478a9b554ca57cf7","3a465f866ccd767d4b309d9e911973dd4b5154bb","89ad9649b9f959bcf671aa578f730c55941aab30","dd4af8f7607b9bbad6271ed4c441d9f108d3c481","e41e5af77e7e073e24e0543a6e6d9afb55912bc8","beadf9ea31b351c6f51ad32493f854cfe470a9ac","1e14e4f3d109475fb88b5a0da596ff964763e93b","b12e8083a430710b96e60ac1bad9781fbe0469c4","400a85cd90e36e41e5c189410ea8677827163b20","383e8d5881232b297747afd92fda59f62053615b","5fbdc717cc06376ba5a5998d83e7ae03bbddc66e","8cd5153fb50eddd78018deba6a34cc60ac50eb7f","843ac4151962b2e7ff1c568f14a8722d0f94407c","a6ce457b2b58e5aadadcb514283dab9fab85fa1c","05dfc5868a4c4dce67602e9d9964df3289ea4b8c","60cb689b700fb0b59b784c2df2fcb2124f107b2c","15d36596e65427a1ce5e61cee550c95c0368e83a","c992709636a7c9a1da9fb68155cd48059bbf9952","acce9e961a794a29adfac64cd37fa1742098e9d2","8c264cb39f47013f42f37e0ff8086fd99fc169a2","63063ea4c1a333a74b2478ccf14b6981eeaf5285"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Screening of penicillin residues in milk by a surface plasmon resonance-based biosensor assay : comparison of chemical and enzymatic sample pre-treatment","doi":"10.1016/S0003-2670(01)00948-5","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/S0003-2670%2801%2900948-5","venue":""}

The mechanisms of brain damage observed in this disorder are poorly understood. In the present study we investigated some oxidative stress parameters in the brain of rats with experimental hyperphenylalaninemia. Chemiluminescence, total radical-trapping antioxidant potential (TRAP), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activities were measured in the brain of the animals. We observed that chemiluminescence is increased and TRAP is reduced in the brain of hyperphenylalaninemic rats. Similar data were obtained in the in vitro experiments using Phe at various concentrations. CAT activity was significantly inhibited by Phe in vitro and in vivo, whereas GSH-Px activity was reduced in vivo but not in vitro and SOD activity was not altered by any treatment. The results indicate that oxidative stress may be involved in the neuropathology of PKU. However, further studies are necessary to confirm and extend our findings to the human condition and also to determine whether an antioxidant therapy may be of benefit to these patients.","inCitations":["f5d9f75d5a433e929fc99ef1a6ecf8e535bfa92a","4417e67fc57ac6d3e5075bc26d10701235afaae1","d53f3bfc17bac867bd31cb7c0690a454affc88cb","209d417a580e067e3e38c83b3d16efc39f4fab8f","40d1b2b468b22cc37925c03d4791607ec0a5c22e","a7b5af5762cc667d3b730b66d3f4891163d08c01","3b5b8124a72f105a36a8c699cf6f4db7a238b90b","c55abbd464b75224c670a89447971af295795cd4","624f1679606faa9b5dcf5e75a100d860bb7a9f78","a6774b8a7cfe84a8ced7eeba3ef108d13bc063a1","3fb727cebe295e107fc63967febd4d2253634d31","a5b85e3aef76b80a6eae7bb2287d390bb8e8f911","7273b679dd6ee1a30f27db2c41d0c8df99a64d59","7e19a5b0bd1bdcf283adcc6cbae59eee4b3947c4","d5cd02571786e1c5f93f0128977557c93151705d","df16cb122e6c9b33b9e7081a5eae60ed54f57ef7","054fc9a06c5477893d158c1f90611ab6f113ba48","b7765dcf1faa490907e54a73f327a720211f7d3b","6c7f43c605d8d9d6e6f81460e025b241916a0a15","c238bcd1b0518f0cc5c567cd4d4ef9e8e80bbef8","f8b5f129fe0352f788a142f89657be6c97c7c092","f2ce9cf3ed1fef7340f16e23af6524dcc04a261e","b7cd26b9c6dec9bba86ee44f7bdd9c9595f86bcf","33d0730635459bd32dfb563349f9c0b9fc16e9ca","034e813595963df0df4364b318f42d8aecc65525","efe36e0c84769ebb8e7b4965ba208408c2057caa","2eff71a83bdb1206827797713c4ae87aec31395a","3579aeb257171d72de122220f4157aeb3540860b","173431c32052d8607ac951c2978b82ef5d6299ce","9dbc30bdbcac2c505e86dcfbb7f95e0c5a0f54cd","2474ae99790112bb4d68e5946e15da3735dca066","b8b5f85211f203fda5fa1a60875ba495d82d3831","63bfb275fda05bea5984eae622bfc090a4e28ab7"],"pdfUrls":["https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82316682.pdf"],"title":"Experimental hyperphenylalaninemia provokes oxidative stress in rat brain.","doi":"10.1016/S0925-4439(01)00112-0","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/S0925-4439%2801%2900112-0","venue":"Biochimica et biophysica acta"}

Removal of these deposits is important in maintaining flux and preventing retention of valuable species. In this paper, the effect of interaction between bovine serum albumin (BSA) and yeast particles on the reversibility of cake formation during microfiltration was studied. Critical flux and hysteresis of flux–transmembrane pressure curves are evaluated using flux stepping experiments. Intermittent filtration was used to observe cake dispersal and re-establishment. Washed yeast formed reversible, low resistance cakes even above the apparent critical flux. At a low yeast concentration of 0.3 g/L, the introduction of 1 g/L protein into the feed solution reduced the apparent critical flux significantly. However, at higher concentrations of yeast (0.8 and 1.45 g/L), the introduction of protein had little effect on the apparent critical flux. It was observed that even 0.1 g/L BSA was sufficient to introduce irreversibility in the cake formation with 0.8 g/L yeast. The rate of fouling appeared lowest for pH 3.0 for these mixed systems, suggesting that rapid binding of BSA at the top of the cake due to electrostatic attraction prevented further penetration of the particles into the void space of the yeast cakes.","inCitations":["3728311cf8d7ff04f8cde9a90d7631afe32addd7","47514bb0d547c89399533c9a075938199bfdfb74","0f96df1fa7840843a7f47dcd97556ff92ceb87eb","25394a2d60cdb809c15b96a307320059fb5f8f64","a652f7e10932578a8d8badc48befd834e017b202"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Reversibility of heterogeneous deposits formed from yeast and proteins during microfiltration","doi":"10.1016/j.memsci.2005.04.031","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.memsci.2005.04.031","venue":""}

Although these connections are apparent to clinicians, they are difficult to prove qualitatively or quantitatively. Enteral feeding and polymeric diets are equally effective at bringing about remission in Crohn's disease (CD). Parenteral feeding is also effective, although none of these methods is as effective as corticosteroid therapy. However, enteral feeding is preferred in the pediatric population because linear growth is more adequately maintained via this route. Exclusion diets in patients brought into remission using an elemental diet have been shown to maintain remission for longer periods. Studies that aim to isolate culpable food groups have shown that individuals react differently on exposure to or exclusion of various foods. The commonly identified food sensitivities are cereals, milk, eggs, vegetables and citrus fruits. Studies that have looked at gut mucosal antigen behavior have shown higher rectal blood flow, in response to specific food antigens, in those with CD over healthy subjects. Exclusion of sugar shows little evidence of amelioration in CD. Omega 3 fatty acids show promise in the treatment of IBD but await larger randomized controlled trials. Patients frequently notice that specific foods cause aggravation of their symptoms. Whilst it has been difficult to pinpoint specific foods, with advances in the laboratory tests and food supplements available, the aim is to prolong remission in these patients using dietary measures, and reduce the need for pharmacotherapy and surgical intervention.","inCitations":["d625ba8995056f6a8b14456688d047b4c17c2715","b9b38df4d24f8b6c8c811baca52b8465ca1d363b","1c5f9438871fd65988777e176fe8e362be2b284a","5656860bdfe56af3f7d9dd37cb54689dc4fe39c1","be62b4f23209846e87eb4df8359c145973a731f1","d6d4a04472156b9bdfd6cd2119775a3f9210f090","b48f86cb11332ee3ff09440cff21f29bf2c76b38","7dacb12699dd9c7ce1d30a005df97b9afcedc3af","d69fdc625c922d882b11754442d251bb73943c47","8f719a8b40002860e1b57b520d17ba882627f9d2","45661de023ef6bb3e9059766b2d3978e7e865dc6","0596b8249ae2870e3be8194683a534564ff6b5e6","4f13c059b4dd58db6f8bda6c2231db12759f5695","1e0b31ed09747d2132f588013b83e9dfc6eaac80","3385b50d67157a3ee1cb1638fb48c0cca73c5e66","6f7d39d09fde025b11b9474be97f0abc7922baa2","05ce40e21b2cd383b88855f4eb61d51ed0d345c2","6bcff817d8a50ce402032eb5e5634712c1731522","0d11aeb972815bb32336bbb89c01dbf1eb030811","c50efa54af717613ccb479d9d0e1026c5f9aad83","0631274ce3e2344badb4a83ffb0c63c540d68de3","725a13c3abd9e14a13beec3e2c7c67ae9947d766","47c18df0719b55847530d45bf262b91fb7292cd6","da7469b31a0683add84fd2abd80937c8f0d92e13","1c6ecfe9cc875eecb9eb093f6fa77f1ed5e4ad6c","c892e73463cd9747c3a1110500f76d79043b4b6a","bab87759a938a637810a672cae64c80931fe8b8e","1a546f83f7959432b522d7040ce4382eb9446a9c","ceb80f1b6aee34f4bbc16b5fabc02d5f003364d4","aa923b8b0d163dde505c12cf29f7a3c8fc4535b5","e693419fce96c792359ff523f341a91c422df78c","47ef3caa5cf7a3a8d30954469cf7a5a967607fd8","3b64804388bdf8a078518de364b44ae24b3d9c4e","c249a2083d281e23be4d53b6f5ec1ff1f7f71f08","c42dea94fa6115318279866fc89a5c6732e704c1","f84fb72396a3772c0ca91e71d5708bf946747f64","53052bca17ed100d33783edda030f5c48048d776","b09db1b24529fcb4ce18a007524278c9180d6014","766a5de7bf54122c5c6bff8ee3fed5fa40c55afe","2ca3669c129945416970e18bf109ebb79b53ca9f","e09d9c78d4fb9f167ddbf4cd3533d5eaf306f980","7c032472158f2012482215d24372d556074d5575","3c8d1fb10bb8a6a25c058778c2bb93832e57eb43","8227cfb587dbcd537703c8d3e47132bc0fe92e70","dadc4d46007a15ff952d659447bb47b1c86bb485","c36f669deea855db8bdc36c96524316754e5c2fe","3b54c0e394229fd737e98b494e3305050e91db78","57643b407451f97cc97f40c4f9b012ddeb963b03","a88d46554905e6c770c2b3d6759b795885a3852a","b465447be82259f6fdd7ccfbd9b1eb98448b7c3c","6497a86a3941b13ea4901d47990177a2836ce514","ca4e0b787d8c2c93c841cdc71eab3eebec43e722","26a3ea1c1f4dec15e773c7f83089ba86be6fe979","c5ba87ba52dcda9bf7cfd14560d583c47efcae1d","25ae6d75f5e60d969dbec4c864b1a061cba90c27","d577a0fe6d6b75b75105997f4ed58322892d32ce","113e7ea7149f89c5f294cd3585b62c3e5ce50787","93ef0fc6da7ac2de1ae105a19019311bd582f497"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Role of diet in the management of inflammatory bowel disease.","doi":"10.3748/wjg.v16.i12.1442","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.3748/wjg.v16.i12.1442","venue":"World journal of gastroenterology"}

(1) He had been an officer in the guards and a nephew of Charles Mordaunt, Third Earl of Peterborough, the Whig politician, military leader, and, over many years, close friend of Pope. Mordaunt left a suitably grim note: \"But the truest laudanum of all / Is resolution and a ball\" (qtd. in Mack 416). Not long afterwards, Pope composed a short poem on the subject of his own birthday, the twenty-first of May, which that year happened also to be the day on which Robert Harley, Earl of Oxford and father to another close friend, Edward, died, though Pope did not discover the fact until his arrival in London on the twenty-second. Pope's poem is unusually bleak: On a Late Birth Day. 1724. With added Days, if Life bring nothing new, But, like a Sieve, let ev'ry Pleasure thro'; Some Joy still lost, as each vain Year runs o'er, And all we gain, some pensive Notion more! Is this a Birth-Day? ah! 'tis sadly clear 'Tis but the Fun'ral of the former Year. If there's no Hope, with kind, tho' fainter ray To gild the Evening of our future Day; If ev'ry Page of Life's long Volume tell The same dull Story--Mordaunt! thou dids't well. (6: 247) Death, in Pope, is always moral. As we live, so shall we die, and Pope rarely introduces a death without its being made an appropriate commentary on the life that preceded it, or even produced it. The Duke of Buckingham, \"Sir Balaam,\" Anne Oldfield (\"Narcissa\" in the \"Epistle to Cobham\"), \"The Man of Ross,\" even Hector, Patroclus, and Priam in The Iliad, all provide in their mode of dying some form of summary and judgment on their lives, manners, and morals. (2) Suicide, supremely, would be expected to cap the life and temperament that brought it to pass. Suicide, after all, is the last refuge of the self, the self that cannot face, or that cannot forget, or that has been brought to despair so great that the ultimate act seems to provide the only escape. Yet the sentiment expressed with regard to Mordaunt is, in spite of its being couched in conditional terms, unusually bleak: this death was well done. Moreover, the weight of evidence built up over the nine preceding \"if\" lines sufficiently diminishes the force of the conditional to render the last couplet well nigh conclusive. \"If\" life is indeed like this, then Mordaunt's decision is not only understandable, it is the only rational one. Pope does not often write about suicide. Eustace Budgell, for example, killed himself in 1737, between the two Dunciads, yet the lines referring to him in 1743 are identical to those in 1728 (5: A.ii.365; B.ii.397). He does, though, enter into circumstances in which writing about suicide might seem a logical course of action. One of his earliest is in the prologue that Joseph Addison invited him to write for his play, Cato, an occasion that could well have lent itself to reflection on the rationality of suicide. But here Pope is content to confine himself to a confirmation of Cato's status as a true patriot in the Roman republican mode: Cato is described as \"godlike\" (18); he is \"A brave man struggling in the storms of fate, / And greatly falling with a falling state\" (21-22); and, his corpse displayed in triumph by Caesar, he is recognized as Rome's \"dead Father's rev'rend image,\" which darkens the \"pomp\" and causes tears to gush \"from ev'ry eye\" (31-33). Above all, though, Pope is concerned with transposing the effect of Cato's death from ancient Rome to the London stage of 1713. So, \"He bids your breasts with ancient ardour rise / And calls forth Roman drops from British eyes\" (15-16). This play, he asserts, will display \"no common object to your sight\" but \"what with pleasure heav'n itself surveys\" (19-20). In particular, he attempts to predict the audience's response to the several successive scenes of Cato's story: While Cato gives his little senate laws, What bosom beats not in his Country's cause? …","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"“Mere Despair”: Pope and the Death of Hope","doi":"10.1353/sli.2011.0004","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1353/sli.2011.0004","venue":""}

Following previous work showing that recognition memory can be used to index knowledge activation (Farwell & Donchin, 1991; Lykken, 1981), Seymour, Seifert, Mosmann, & Shafto (2000) proposed a new “Guilty Knowledge” Test (GKT) based on the response-time (RT) and accuracy to critical information. In the GKT paradigm, participants are first exposed to critical “Probe” or crime information. Following a delay, and in an ostensibly novel task, participants learn a new set of “Target” phrases (e.g., “Blue Coat”) and are given a speeded recognition task. When presented with Targets, participants are to press a button indicating “Old.” When presented with new “Filler” phrases as well as familiar Probes, participants are to respond with a button indicating “New.” If Probes are familiar, participants may respond differentially to Probes and Fillers. However, when Probes are unfamiliar no differential response is expected. Despite being motivated to respond identically to Probes and Filler, and thus masking their knowledge of the Probes, participants’ responses to Probes were reliably slower and less accurate than to Filler items. This “Guilty Knowledge Effect” (GKE) did not occur when participants responded during a block where Probes are unfamiliar (Seymour et al., 2000). This differential pattern of results for Probes and Fillers led to a high hit rate and low false alarm rate when compared to other test using physiological measures such as heart rate, or more direct measures such as EEG (Farwell & Donchin, 1991).","inCitations":["13ed7d5a87503f3aa5523e0869020d3800a9f4bd","31816cd85b29460c187b84a44c1d104a8048cb78"],"pdfUrls":["http://csjarchive.cogsci.rpi.edu/Proceedings/2003/pdfs/332.pdf","https://cpb-us-e1.wpmucdn.com/sites.ucsc.edu/dist/9/365/files/2016/05/cogsci2003poster.pdf"],"title":"Extending the Response-Time “Guilty Knowledge” Test","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Acht grundlegende Wahrnehmungsfunktionen wurden mit dem Brain-Boy Universal Professional (BUP-System) erfasst. Die funktionalen Analphabeten und Analphabetinnen und die Kinder mit Lese-Rechtschreib-Schwache schnitten in allen acht grundlegenden Wahrnehmungsfunktionen deutlich schlechter ab als die normalen Leserinnen und Leser. Funktionale Analphabetinnen und Analphabeten und Kinder mit Lese-Rechtschreib-Schwache unterschieden sich nicht voneinander. Die Ergebnisse zeigen, dass erwachsene funktionale Analphabetinnen und Analphabeten in ihren grundlegenden Wahrnehmungsfahigkeiten beeintrachtigt sind. Dies konnte, wie fur lese-rechtschreib-schwache Personen beschrieben, zu Problemen bei der Ausbildung von Phonemreprasentationen fuhren, die ihrerseits den beim Schriftspracherwerb zentralen Prozess der Graphem-Phonem-Zuordnung massiv erschweren. Weiterhin deuten die Ergebnisse darauf hin, dass es sinnvoll sein konnte, in der Alphabetisierung Trainingsprogramme einzusetzen, die die grundlegenden Wahrnehmungsfahigkeiten verbessern konnen. Einige derartige Programme sind bereits mit Erfolg bei lese-rechtschreib-schwachen Kindern eingesetzt worden.

However, calcium carbonate (commonly reported as calcite crystals) can form on the surface of bioactive glasses as well, instead of or in competition with hydroxyapatite, during in vitro tests. Major factors that govern calcium carbonate formation are a high concentration of Ca2+ ions in the testing solution - and, in this regard, glass composition/texture and type of medium play key roles - along with the volume of solution used during in vitro tests. To date, this phenomenon has received relatively little attention and is still partly unexplored. This article provides a critical overview of the available literature on this topic in order to stimulate constructive discussion among biomaterials scientists and further research for better understanding the mechanisms involved in glass bioactivity. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: A literature search indicates that a layer of apatite - and not calcium carbonate - is well known to form on the surface of biomaterials during the bioactivity assessment. However, calcium carbonate can form on the surface as well, instead of or in competition with apatite. To date, this phenomenon has received relatively little attention and is still partly unexplored. This review provides a critical overview of the available literature on this topic in order to stimulate constructive discussions that can be further useful for clinical success.","inCitations":["7c06a14cb70fadadbb00e02ded5845583032ef79","cd4432ac991ebb6a5534a2bc254aa2b2165190b7","12a6b8a6799ed0226da992f8610ac1df53424683","898eb26260dad63866b0bbd17fa5b55f823c3f51","b5a60e510446b24fc11598797f9d5bb15f604641","1cfeb32a362c246772e50ab8f07373b9cfc031fc"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Calcium carbonate: Adored and ignored in bioactivity assessment.","doi":"10.1016/j.actbio.2019.04.039","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.actbio.2019.04.039","venue":"Acta biomaterialia"}

Tests were conducted to observe the leakage (functional) failure of the composite pipe subjected to various hoop to axial stress ratios. The change in stiffness in the axial and the hoop directions and change in the Poisson's ratio are discussed. The results show that there is a significant nonlinear change in the stiffness and the Poisson's ratio prior to leakage. The nonlinear change in the Poisson's ratio proved to be a useful indicator of damage, independent of the tested stress rate. Macro and micro observations indicate that a dominant axial tension gave a uniform type of matrix cracking within the specimen, where a dominant hoop stress induced delamination within the laminate.","inCitations":["2a14bd326b531a108057ae8a3e543701854761fa","68b241da1625004eb4a6f06095bf7cb66d3db8ac","a32ccce03c1985c549c89ed454f60b37f60983f3","73e61161f4d1838352382bfe5227ac7d6aa5168c","4b884e30491e09a8ed33e46fad413757494fa5b9","233bd04142d710191053d421098c4c042b53b667","6204fb48a96a9ebdf4fd04f0256255ec46d3851b","6f93f95518e0de58594c1c50c928552ca754ef40"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Biaxial monotonic behavior of a multidirectional glass fiber epoxy pipe","doi":"10.1016/S1359-835X(00)00041-5","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/S1359-835X%2800%2900041-5","venue":""}

The experiments include: (1) an introduction to the scanning confocal Fabry–Perot cavity, and to its use as an optical spectrum analyzer; (2) laser frequency modulation and observation of FM sidebands using the optical spectrum analyzer; and (3) the Pound–Drever method for servo‐locking a Fabry–Perot cavity to a laser.

The observed dissociation in performance between the naming of written letters and the naming of letters in oral spelling as well as the dissociation between oral spelling and written spelling are shown to support a model of letter processing in which a distinction is drawn between visuo-spatial and abstract levels of letter representation. We also describe symmetrical deficits in the reading and writing of letters. These can be understood: in reading, as the result of an impairment to the processes which mediate the conversion of visuo-spatial letter representations to abstract representations, and in writing, as a deficit to the processes which negotiate the apparently reverse operation. This finding is interpreted within the context of the notions of neural and functional proximity and we raise the possibility that processes which perform distinct computations may, nonetheless, share certain computational resources.","inCitations":["679bea669fb65176a613939b0c26093c5777dfab","c1c5dc2e82a7f22910a1b9125e70f51798be16a6","40bf565830a5b9063475bd0e77c57218385bb735","6f6d5041342353e42a56d8772822a44d070fcd4a","e60b4b2dd286ead0a6b072251f94d980a9a4278b","056439b4476a46f5277d06d8e73a88eb255873ba","44799582964ba024be13d7d6a32e4784cf14c8e1","1ff62345dadc65e3b1b16f595d5391147f9f4a2e","84d921275232d9a7d17739e87223213754726fb3","293fad9a690e741121cfd57f9d6c62ddb0d475ea"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Letter processing in reading and spelling: Some dissociations","doi":"10.1007/BF00178834","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/BF00178834","venue":""}

In this paper, the atomic friction between the two nanocomposite components is greatly amplified by locally increasing the density of the energetically higher non-covalent bonds. This gives rise to a new material design concept in which crystallite structures, nucleated around the carbonaceous nanofiller, become the source of enhanced energy dissipation. The rheological concept is a nanopiston unit consisting of a carbon nanotube (CNT) as nanofiller coated with crystallite structures which, upon unconventionally and reversibly overcoming the interfacial interaction forces, monolithically roto-translate from an energetically stable state to the adjacent states. The efficiency of this novel \"sliding crystals\" mechanism is proven by its higher dissipation capability that turns out to be at least twice as much as that of the conventional CNT-polymer stick-slip within a larger strain range.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"\"Sliding Crystals\" on Low-Dimensional Carbonaceous Nanofillers as Distributed Nanopistons for Highly Damping Materials.","doi":"10.1021/acsami.9b12536","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1021/acsami.9b12536","venue":"ACS applied materials & interfaces"}
