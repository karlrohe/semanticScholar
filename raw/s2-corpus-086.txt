Vimentin but not alpha-IN localized within filopodia-like neurites of undifferentiated cells. During differentiation, alpha-IN immunoreactivity accumulated within axonal neurites following vimentin but, as previously describe in neurons in situ, before the appearance of NF-L. We therefore manipulated alpha-IN synthesis, accumulation, and function in attempts to determine whether or not this intermediate filament species played a role in axonal development. Intracellular delivery of anti-alpha-IN antisense oligonucleotides and antibodies was permissive for neuritogenesis, yet compromised neurite elongation; this effect was further reflected in diminished levels of stabilized axonal microtubules. These data suggest that alpha-IN plays a role in the development of neuronal polarity. Relatively more alpha-IN than NF-L accumulated within the plastic axonal neurites induced following serum-deprivation, while stable, dbcAMP-induced neurites treatment contained equivalent levels of each. Protease inhibition increased NF-L and NF-H but not alpha-IN immunoreactivity within serum-deprived neurites, suggesting that proteolysis restricts NF-L accumulation pending neurite stabilization. To test the possibility that NF-H accumulation is dependent upon NF-L and cannot be mediated by alpha-IN, we examined levels of NF-H co-precipitated from cells with alpha-IN and NF-L. Virtually all newly synthesized NF-H co-precipitated with NF-L, while only a small percentage co-precipitated with alpha-IN. Finally, NF-H or NF-M were absent from the axon hillock or perikaryal area at the base of neurites, where alpha-IN immunoreactivity is prominent. These data extend earlier cell-free demonstrations that NF-H preferentially associates with NF-L rather than alpha-IN.","inCitations":["d5b0a1f3d862453baf05d08ae1539db66d65b9c8","e0b7c2cdd370ae4a1150b929c4cecb94c7173203","7ef69f2790e66026b3b8f92b04575faebe8e5656","9a76eb9f9ed57a94ab964c8aed5784b8fd53db48","e80c30d899f5bf255c7f13f42dcfa342df734c5d","f19f90d37c6b487d3dfb15c5eb2153ea1ee432a6","6521f5fef4ed31c237c2be17db4142bfb12fbe26","29822028303365a1b8fbae8ad779fbe7bc646f0c","32b0e7c9852cf3af57bc26761f86a993d665b765","a594fb42dad16029c11426d46b2a945151cc2afb","284ecfb789c552abf6cd78494baa35382b55192b","5160fa10b371490d418f2c9b62da76bfc27a72fd","e284710d9222ee237a7be7d8ae07f574f9f47706","ca562c045c0417d4f0c94ec4dcc3d0a9d2a75dc8","05a01cf7caf5af1e51a792f22ab0f87263943bda","131b73be943933df5e736d5bf5f9585e0b053b98","353fe110e83717bf0d41e8ba42d728d1f24e424d","1da7153731596ab96c8b8ffdfe3532f4a2412e5c","c2846eb9108bebf3c884d710fa895f4f80961976","12a4ef35547ea14db8722faaf6dc285818f7f344"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Neuronal intermediate filament protein alpha-internexin facilitates axonal neurite elongation in neuroblastoma cells.","doi":"10.1002/(SICI)1097-0169(1999)43:4<322::AID-CM5>3.0.CO;2-B","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1002/%28SICI%291097-0169%281999%2943%3A4%3C322%3A%3AAID-CM5%3E3.0.CO%3B2-B","venue":"Cell motility and the cytoskeleton"}

Motivated by the recent success of similar ideas in object detection on static images, we generalize the notion of 2D box features to 3D spatio-temporal volumetric features. This general framework enables us to do real-time video analysis. We construct a realtime event detector for each action of interest by learning a cascade of filters based on volumetric features that efficiently scans video sequences in space and time. This event detector recognizes actions that are traditionally problematic for interest point methods - such as smooth motions where insufficient space-time interest points are available. Our experiments demonstrate that the technique accurately detects actions on real-world sequences and is robust to changes in viewpoint, scale and action speed. We also adapt our technique to the related task of human action classification and confirm that it achieves performance comparable to a current interest point based human activity recognizer on a

Given that the vast majority of the current global hydrogen is produced from fossil fuels, CO2 capture and storage (CCS) emerges as a promising strategy for delivering clean hydrogen on a global scale. The primary challenge with CCS is the large energy penalty imposed, but this problem is circumvented by the membrane-assisted gas switching reforming (MA-GSR) technology evaluated in this work. Combined reactor and process simulations showed that the MA-GSR process achieves a similar equivalent H2 production efficiency as conventional steam methane reforming without CO2 capture. The results of the process simulations also show that the new MA-GSR concept can achieve a higher H2 production efficiency than the conventional plant when integrated with CO2 capture (20% higher). However, a drawback of the MA-GSR concept is the low utilization of the membranes in the system, requiring a large membrane surface area for a given rate of hydrogen production. This makes the economics of the concept highly sensitive to the cost and durability of the H2 perm-selective membranes. In the base-case, the cost of hydrogen (0.274 €/Nm3H2) was lower than the conventional process with CO2 capture (0.282 €/Nm3H2), with a cost of CO2 avoidance of 85.14 €/tCO2 instead of 97.06 €/tCO2 for the conventional technology. Future technology improvements leading to a threefold reduction in the cost/permeability ratio of H2 perm-selective membranes can allow the MA-GSR technology to produce hydrogen at a similar cost as conventional steam methane reforming without CO2 capture.","inCitations":["fa362f73f8c5a1025d0133a3372142cc0db498f8"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Techno-economic assessment of membrane-assisted gas switching reforming for pure H2 production with CO2 capture","doi":"10.1016/j.ijggc.2018.03.021","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijggc.2018.03.021","venue":""}

The appropriate consideration of the effect of passivation on electromigration damage makes it possible to evaluate the reliability of the metal line with choosing kind or thickness of the passivation. This paper is focused on the effect of passivation thickness on the failure prediction. The failure prediction considering the passivation thickness is shown. First, the film characteristic constants depending on the passivation thickness are experimentally determined in the lines with three kinds of passivation thickness. Next, by extrapolating the obtained dependencies, the characteristic constants are determined to predict the lifetime of the line covered with the thicker passivation than that employed in the experiment, and the lifetime is predicted by the reliability evaluation method based on the numerical simulation.Copyright © 2003 by ASME","inCitations":["ba669615d5fb79130631812aa38a7a6ad5d8156d","3d84fb7d949b91a1cfe6b7d7e81bc2c06ade1ced","f60d97614862498e40cdc6126b6fdae5ece0d787"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Prediction of Electromigration Failure in Passivated Polycrystalline Line Considering Passivation Thickness","doi":"10.1115/IPACK2003-35065","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1115/IPACK2003-35065","venue":""}

Such applications are commonly sold as feature-bloated off-the-shelf products to be used by people with variable needs in the required features and layout preferences. Although many UI adaptation approaches were proposed, several gaps and limitations including: extensibility and integration in legacy systems, still need to be addressed in the state-of-the-art adaptive UI development systems. This paper presents Role-Based UI Simplification (RBUIS) as a mechanism for increasing usability through adaptive behavior by providing end-users with a minimal feature-set and an optimal layout, based on the context-ofuse. RBUIS uses an interpreted runtime model-driven approach based on the Cedar Architecture, and is supported by the integrated development environment (IDE), Cedar Studio. RBUIS was evaluated by integrating it into OFBiz, an open-source ERP system. The integration method was assessed and measured by establishing and applying technical metrics. Afterwards, a usability study was carried out to evaluate whether UIs simplified with RBUIS show an improvement over their initial counterparts. This study leveraged questionnaires, checking task completion times and output quality, and eye-tracking. The results showed that UIs simplified with RBUIS significantly improve end-user efficiency, effectiveness, and perceived usability.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://oro.open.ac.uk/45960/1/akiki16tse.pdf"],"title":"The Open University ’ s repository of research publications and other research outputs Engineering Adaptive Model-Driven User Interfaces","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Patients were classified into five groups preoperatively according to Lichtman's classification: stage IIIA, 1 patient; stage IIIB, 11; and stage IV, 3. After an average follow-up period of 57 months, the clinical results were evaluated by the method described by Lichtman et al. Twelve patients were rated as satisfactory, and three patients were rated as unsatisfactory. Clinical results were good with regard to pain relief and grip strength, but poor with regard to range of motion of the wrist. Five patients revealed postoperative progression of osteoarthritic changes at the radioscaphoid joint, and this appeared to be a main factor influencing clinical results. Two of these five patients had subsequent wrist arthrodesis. We conclude that stage IIIB is a specific indication for scaphotrapeziotrapezoidal arthrodesis.","inCitations":["2f47cabe54517576082124cf8845aa5410d46268","bba9809b58aa335a6b7c5d0cfc752a41ddca631e","1745b338497f6d68bce10476a69ea9e89a8bdc89","59967622645b48068800f779b7d83e2ea409b5a5","dc8c5df76fa2f11941e86474ae7f16f9992ed1fb","1a6d85e0d8003f6ad2856de16adf3d4fba5c5536","f4c570bd4932413e38bd2d32706ec3ea7f355e77","2404a3048101da8474067f497b606a295a92f6d3","0117b3c2b1c5dfde4e82821fbe9539b9544f7b78","95bbfcd188aa6e7da5e836530a48dd9864b57fc9","c1ca5ea42d7ae81cdc91f958edca2d7f63e621a6","a926b43a91bd4c1787a6226c53ef861d659778a9","016680ba4f731345a3b7985815d54e4228aa2c60","83dad4fe1e684152bfe24ac67c63618b16d6b1fb","fc7f12d32c991511119d57bc3fe4c90cb988da85","0df1c9f3c9a5c9960bc2ba1e61acebdca66048e5","47c165f5ec6d48056d006aa10d85a5dee25dcc65","ba6262500caa8be1cf5a4397c8687001cf64c779","df5ec6ccfb9dd102b414f8027d37cb73aa9f4cb2","7452894714e8a0936b4caed61b3b7ed2d7c53478","26dc130037758b0972b36f64afd6c1ce06f4c3c5"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Long-term results of Kienböck's disease treated by triscaphe arthrodesis and excisional arthroplasty with a coiled palmaris longus tendon.","doi":"10.1016/0363-5023(94)90009-4","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/0363-5023%2894%2990009-4","venue":"The Journal of hand surgery"}

How the different imaginal discs acquire and maintain their appendage-specific determined states are problems that have been addressed using experimental embryology as well as genetic and molecular approaches. Here we discuss the concept of cell determination and describe what is known about how determination is established and maintained in imaginal disc cells. The phenomenon of imaginal disc transdetermination, originally discovered in the 1960s, has remained an intriguing problem for understanding imaginal disc cell determination. We review the topic of imaginal disc transdetermination and describe how recent results from molecular genetic approaches have provided new insights into imaginal disc transdetermination and determination. We also discuss how an understanding of imaginal disc transdetermination can aid our understanding of parallel phenomena in other organisms, including human metaplasias.","inCitations":["03a66d38fe3f6348aa707e97c1e80b2081c1cef3","8f6023cebf117e8525d803c99598b31ef5726f60","8ab62dc003830aebc2020cb11328ee59abe1177a","bb0b76f33b2e35b1168cb1e24f43631c71c7426d","97cb3eaf2e7d6e298b8caaa8f40a07a08440a4ea","0a2ac345455bf937dcbcb3647c40b6853e2beafc","9689aab207cfa7a1d850cd7d5b5663750e72b400","811d9217f56d15c421216f0a2b8699819a2cc5e9","32d9be1ae5dfcf645952ef6200dc3d3fa3abdf52","10335821660f34ccbb43b2cf8c8c9627ea2795f9","48e0aac22dcdcf781e871f12a7360fae24297848","0bc594f8dcb3ed97803551c3132ca72fa4166a37","f471c5b2fdcc522fc81319c1f723b6139c7981a3","3af7d2ff947274b30d4eef2769c855b5722dcf4f","916906209688b74fb6626e61a89267bed5bf63ea"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Cell determination and transdetermination in Drosophila imaginal discs.","doi":"10.1016/S0070-2153(08)60380-4","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/S0070-2153%2808%2960380-4","venue":"Current topics in developmental biology"}

The maximum current electrode separation attained was 600 km. The sounding was situated on a shield area with a thin cover of sedimentary rocks (Karroo System) overlying the archaean granite. The center was chosen near to the village of Dealesville. \n \n \n \nIt is shown that lateral effects at large AB spacings are unlikely, but due to numerous dolerite intrusions in the sediments surface electrode effects must be guarded against; thus AB positions were chosen by geologists.

In addition, the impact of a membrane in the reactor was evaluated, showing an increase on Fe(VI) generation rate and current efficiency. The rate constants for ferrate generation are affected by the initial concentration of Fe(III) and current density, and to a lesser extent by the temperature. Results show that the use of this type of reactor leads to higher current efficiency in comparison with a batch reactor, exceeding 90% for the first 25 minutes using 30 mM of Fe(III) and 10 mA cm−2.

Information about soil characteristics and its spatial distribution is important to allow secure intervention in the case of an accident (oil spill). The objectives of this chapter is to present the methodology used to built a soil digital data base of this region combining soil surveys that are mainly available as printed maps at different scales. First, the soil maps were scanned and vectorized and the soil units were identified. All information was put in a digital soil database, with scales from 1:250,000 to 1:10,000. The predominant soils near the borders of Solimoes River are Eutric Fluvisols and Eutric Gleysols, whereas in the terra firme predominate yellow Ferralsols, Acrisols and Plinthosols occur. Some Podzols are found scattered in the area, normally at the base of short valleys. Anthrosols with rich antropic horizons also occur, which are called Terra Preta de Indio. A soil digital database using this approach to collect all information can be used to plan, monitor and reduce the impacts caused by the petroleum exploitation. It is also useful for land use planners in this region.","inCitations":["0190b534808b3246a1f158cd72c076fa5c8aad75","6482455c05f0f45ae0315876e389037429f4f961","a92a22e3dc70383121495b200b646abaaf35fc27","c168c7208f098466bebbcaa7176268ff6fbd4cf7"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Building a Digital Soil Data Base of the Solimões River Region in the Brazilian Central Amazon","doi":"10.1007/978-1-4020-8592-5_29","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4020-8592-5_29","venue":""}

The obtained cheeses were stored at 4 °C during 24 hours and then analyzed for physicochemical and sensory properties. The replacement of milk fat in white brined cheese resulted in a lower total solids content due to the higher water-binding capacity of fat replacers used. Fat content was significantly higher for low-fat white brined cheese-like product than in low-fat control cheese. This result was attributed to fat retention capacity of the fat replacers used. Lipolysis index was the highest in the case of low-fat white brined cheese-like product due to changes in cheese microstructure after fat replacers incorporation in low-fat products. Milk-olive oil emulsion showed the lowest cheese-making yield compared to its full and low-fat counterparts.

After compression tests at 20 °C, an experimental procedure was designed for high-temperature testing. The cylindrical samples were heated in a muffle furnace, then were inserted into a specific apparatus (called ‘thermos’) for maintaining the prescribed temperature, and finally were subjected to a mechanical compression test. The results obtained by applying this procedure show a common variation of the strength, reduction of modulus of elasticity, and corresponding increments of the ultimate strain with temperature enhancement. Specific diagrams and discussion on the results are performed for each material.

Hopwood, 1972; Otley, 1978) on the effects of supervisory styles on subordinates' job related tension have been contradictory. Subsequent studies using the contingency model to resolve these conflicting results have identified budgetary participation (Brownell, 1982a) and trust (Ross, 1994) as important moderating variables. With respect to participation, a number of prior studies found that a compatible combination of high budget emphasis and high participation was associated with better behavioural outcomes ( eg. lower job related tension), than other combinations of budget emphasis and participation. Yet there has been relatively little research to investigate why this particular combination of budget emphasis and participation is associated with better behavioural outcomes. This thesis therefore investigates a number of important issues. First, it investigates whether different combinations of budget emphasis and participation affect subordinates' propensity to create slack and job related tension differently. Second, it examines whether a high budget emphasis-high participation combination results in lower subordinates' propensity to create slack and lower job related tension than a low budget emphasis-high participation combination. Third, it investigates the reasons why a high budget emphasis-high participation combination leads to lower propensity to create slack and lower job related tension. The interaction between budget emphasis and participation was dealt with by testing a model on supervisory styles in a high participatory environment. Norway was hypothesised to have a high participatory environment because of its high power distance culture and its highly centralised and formalised industrial relations systems which emphasise democratic work environment. Moreover, its highly homogeneous population and society are likely to result in a small diversity within its national culture, which in turn, leads to a smaller range of participation. Hence participation in Norway is expected to be not only high, but also widespread. This means that a high budget emphasis situation in Norway is similar to a high budget emphasis and high participation combination, whilst a low budget emphasis situation in Norway is similar to a low budget emphasis-high participation combination. This allows a high budget emphasis-high participation (Norway) situation to be compared with a low budget emphasis-high participation (Norway) situation. Consequently, a high budget emphasis situation in Norway, which is similar to a high budget emphasis and high participation situation, is therefore expected to be associated with lower job related tension than a low budget emphasis in Norway. In order to investigate the reason why a high budget emphasis-high participation combination promotes lower propensity to create slack and job related tension, path analytical models, which investigate the intervening effects of participation, trust and organisational commitment on the relationship between budget emphasis and propensity to create slack/job related tension, were developed. Testing these models in Norway permits two issues to be investigated. These are: (i) the interaction between budget emphasis and participation affecting propensity to create slack/job related tension, and (ii) the intervening effects of participation, trust and organisational commitment on the relationship between budget emphasis and propensity to create slack/job related tension. The results support the expectation that Norwegian managers generally enjoy very high level of budgetary participation.

Terpenes of cannabis and hops are typically simple mono- and sesquiterpenes derived from two and three isoprene units, respectively. Some terpenes are relatively well known for their potential in biomedicine and have been used in traditional medicine for centuries, while others are yet to be studied in detail. The current, comprehensive review presents terpenes found in cannabis and hops. Terpenes' medicinal properties are supported by numerous in vitro, animal and clinical trials and show anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, analgesic, anticonvulsive, antidepressant, anxiolytic, anticancer, antitumor, neuroprotective, anti-mutagenic, anti-allergic, antibiotic and anti-diabetic attributes, among others. Because of the very low toxicity, these terpenes are already widely used as food additives and in cosmetic products. Thus, they have been proven safe and well-tolerated.","inCitations":["49921076d02a986f1be83983b642ea5870deb0cd","3b5081f1adb876030dc94f9decae82cd03cf06a8","ebf6ec2077412b771f65d5be7912f15d2afbf61c","bd39ea87aa95db6a242491fc02fc6b80a0227811","99014f45be7c8f27f9d501a849b38d969de05701","0d1c05c801d8aa6fa00110e5dfc792da7761086d","c9f3a584a7b21b381613721977274b5e20a70007","4e22e57a9261b431ee6834211900fc20bc7cce8c","3896303ad3ac7e61ae32bc3bebdefb8ee1fbf2e4","55105d865678937f252f762ffe6512ec8c63b884","3cf6616a26f5a09886af62116fd7adee9e700a6e","51e6d4f3f032884ae0588b6a53054c64c7321ed2","8d9cf1e0130826ddb9aeba6884e9bf6d0d1b8091","67341dacc0461cf8537323e2e88526face10d73d","2990e38527ea2f353e7ed6694497cf0a1fd91c0a"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Medicinal properties of terpenes found in Cannabis sativa and Humulus lupulus.","doi":"10.1016/j.ejmech.2018.07.076","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejmech.2018.07.076","venue":"European journal of medicinal chemistry"}

A","paperAbstract":"The performance of charged aerosol detection (CAD) was compared to evaporative light scattering detection (ELSD) for the analysis of Leishmania membrane phospholipid (PL) classes by NP-HPLC. In both methods, a PVA-Sil column was used for the determination of the major Leishmania membrane PLs, phosphatidic acid, phosphatidylglycerol, cardiolipin, phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylethathanolamine, phosphatidylserine, lysophosphatidylethathanolamine, phosphatidylcholine, sphingomyelin and lysophosphatidylcholine in the same analysis. Although the response of both detection methods can be fitted to a power function, CAD response can also be described by a linear model with determination coefficients (R(2)) ranging from 0.993 to 0.998 for an injected mass of 30 ng to 20.00 microg. CAD appeared to be directly proportional when a restricted range was used and it was found to be more sensitive at lowest mass range than ELSD. With HPLC-ELSD the limits of detection (LODs) were between 71 and 1195 ng and the limits of quantification (LOQs) were between 215 and 3622 ng. With HPLC-CAD, the LODs were between 15 and 249 ng whereas the limits of quantification (LOQs) were between 45 and 707 ng. The accuracy of the methods ranged from 62.8 to 115.8% and from 58.4 to 110.5% for ELSD and CAD, respectively. The HPLC-CAD method is suitable to assess the influence of miltefosine on the composition of Leishmania membrane phospholipids.","inCitations":["bb38850891699278e5f6642773b2126ecb682900","06185e5c3bb29101362bc8e9eae0bc1e5fedf5d6","c10c48fec376bba7aa5b171569b44f2065033248","f80ab9f670c2c8d2230d1fbd8115714823e48204","e7b3b2934725ef9facc33fe9fc6d37e84a4cb479","48623a5225c8bd7aaefd648c80d8de42ad22b535","3da5f67bbfea4a28250144af81c6823b97935605","0986ce681e3b2ca70465696cf22bd0059e6565bc","9b0ccd9969e195bb97507290c90e0a971d0e7687","b0cedc2d08094921400384d8913faa64f87683ac","f2cb959a3f9797f3eb7b8a7df51757291190854f","77e6d8210e067bf5974416eb1a26741e5763b8a8","4a0af68066177e8c07bb1dba92851f27be56eb5c","8c6119e7bc049cccd1bce7b34ae943600559b6ab","fb2977848d48145a741d87b15664c6bebd1c7904","a2ac7c4b780c300d1e836397ed19ef9d4087b22a","9cdff5eba2fdeab86e8a2fd1e0a29206b52a75d3","eadd511cc6dd634e6d024095b98189d6851abbe5","8fba0ff9a546ab50cac16b0ff669c759870ec751","ab4048fe8ef8be490f7c6e9533b62b3f40d995cd","fc8965c8236dc12d4f315e017a285b231ccdf7c7","1ee9db067d84a40d7587b533e80d44e85d72e785","379eaa06e5176d42d1c37c22e271cd74c5506e69","0e719d4d7e7001c6706b9973099eeda030bf71f6","6c3d13a0df07d0545aa4ac5e6dd708b7172deabd","7c75453d36ac17b19a14f0fe95d860b4d1d26f42","f730a7663d6e8cba013d35782094102f77e89b69","0cf193a489dc7cb5de23071050425e3a47b738fa","e5f383bbdbf636c121d95afcd411fca2f81f51e0","a14e40a68b674955a03efc4d147defd8f2f04afc","7abd5d89e42403f067d42b49ce495b0be0540e9c","ce43c44cee2893fd33f1f43bba2809081c7bc69d","bb8252e1666e6fa70412c2fe0d26eb1ea2c0d455"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Comparison between charged aerosol detection and light scattering detection for the analysis of Leishmania membrane phospholipids.","doi":"10.1016/j.chroma.2008.07.080","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2008.07.080","venue":"Journal of chromatography.

To overcome the sensitivity to noise and outliers in fuzzy clustering, a simple but efficient M-estimator, Gaussian estimator, has been introduced to clustering analysis as weight or membership function. When applied to image analysis, the proposed Robust Gaussian Clustering/Segmentation (RGCS) algorithm exhibits more reasonable pixel classification and noise suppression performance with respect to FCM. Moreover, by using a uniform resolution parameter scheme, this method avoids producing coincident clusters, which occurs often in possibilistic clustering segmentation. Experiments on both the synthetic data and real image demonstrate the validity and power of the proposed algorithm.","inCitations":["8b8511bf0a124fecac08f44900b09e93b01f570f"],"pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-540-30125-7_10","https://people.smp.uq.edu.au/GeoffMcLachlan/nm_dicta03.pdf","http://www.maths.uq.edu.au/~gjm/nm_dicta03.pdf"],"title":"Image Segmentation by a Robust Clustering Algorithm Using Gaussian Estimator","doi":"10.1007/978-3-540-30125-7_10","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-540-30125-7_10","venue":"ICIAR"}

Transgenic stack hybrid maize (MON 89034X NK 603) was developed by Monsanto for checking yield losses of maize crop to increase productivity. Transgenic stack hybrid maize was claimed to have both insect protection and herbicide tolerant traits to provide protection to the crop from target pests and also provide effective weed management. MON 89034X NK 603 is 2nd generation glyphosate tolerant with Bt maize technology effective against lepidopteron insect pests with “dual mode of action”. A field experiment was carried out at ICAR-Directorate of Weed Research, Jabalpur for two years during Kharif (rainy season) 2009 and 2010 to evaluate the efficacy of transgenic stack hybrid maize (MON 89034X NK 603) against shoot borer (Chilo partellus), cob borer (Helicoverpa armigera), non-target insect pests and beneficial insects. Treatments consisted of two transgenic stacked hybrids named ‘Hishell’ and ‘‘900M Gold’’ with two conventional hybrids namely ‘Proagro-4640’ and ‘‘HQPM-1’’. Artificial infestation of Chilo partelus revealed complete absence of stem borer infestation in all the transgenic entries of ‘Hishell’ and ‘900M Gold’ with less than one leaf injury score (LIS), while in other conventional entries, stem borer infestation was observed and LIS was more than one. Hlicovepa armigera infestation was also not observed on transgenic hybrids whereas in the remaining non-transgenic maize treatment, significant attack of Helicoverpa armigera was observed in the range of 37 to 56%. These transgenic entries were not found resistant to aphids and grass hoppers. Beneficial insects were observed to visit transgenic Bt maize and conventional maize entries with no significant difference.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://isws.org.in/IJWSn/File/2017_49_Issue-3_241-247.pdf"],"title":"Glyphosate tolerant and insect resistant transgenic Bt maize efficacy against shoot borer, cob borer and non-target insect pests","doi":"10.5958/0974-8164.2017.00063.6","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.5958/0974-8164.2017.00063.6","venue":""}

Central to that initiative was Mr. Wolfensohn's plan to transform the World Bank into a Knowledge Bank. As he pointed out, the Bank works on development issues with a wide range of stakeholders, including donor governments, non-governmental organizations, private sector and not-for-profit development groups, and borrower governments. This puts the Bank in a unique position to collect and redistribute knowledge about development. Mr. Wolfensohn's goal was that by the year 2000, the World Bank would be the first resource that anyone contacts for information about development. This case covers the time period from Mr. Wolfensohn's arrival as the ninth President of the World Bank Group through the target year of 2000 for accomplishing his objective. This paper begins with a discussion of the chronology of transforming the education sector into a knowledge-centric organization through the creation of distinct communities of practice, called Thematic Groups, and the implementation of an Education Advisory Service. This process and its results are evaluated in light of the implementation of knowledge management throughout the Bank in general. The paper concludes with some propositions about where and why the education sector's experience with knowledge management produced success, and the implications for other organizations attempting a similar revolution in how they do business.","inCitations":["a25b8522f74d96e2cf03a7d580bf8e89870e6d31","1737c637a087cc43efec9de0b46a7350b59ce99b","44f0c4832c29bbda25761df92df6382a57a647a7","348724ea3d63b7c442bf9d4aec2f9feac3336457","d63453574f91f2bdb67e0ef50899170ba4bf5293","b75f895a9c645dcce30ce961dfd8e34655a50944","fa4bf0981d1f86146962342812538d1b0391a0e3"],"pdfUrls":["http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/574241468763497022/pdf/286220decree0or0choice0WBI0WP.pdf","http://www.worldbank.org/ks/articles/by_decry_or_choice.pdf","http://siteresources.worldbank.org/WBI/Resources/by_decry_or_choice.pdf"],"title":"By decree or by choice ?

Twenty-five patients were osteoporotic treatment-naïve (naïve group), and 11 patients were previously treated with BPs (switch group) (average 7.9 years). BMD and BTMs were measured before and 6 and 12 months after treatment.ResultsBTM levels were higher in the naïve group at baseline. However, the same level of suppression was achieved at 6 months in both groups. Spine BMD increased significantly in both groups. There was no significant difference in the mean percent changes of BMD of the spine (naïve group: 6.8 ± 0.8, switch group: 5.1 ± 1.5), femoral neck (2.9 ± 1.4, 2.9 ± 1.3), and total hip (1.7 ± 0.9, 1.4 ± 1.1) between these two groups at 12 months.ConclusionsThe effects of denosumab on BMD and BTMs of the switch group after long-term BP treatment are comparable to those of the naïve group in RA patients. Thus, switching BPs to denosumab is one of the useful options to treat osteoporosis with RA.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://jeo-esska.springeropen.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s40634-019-0211-7"],"title":"Effects of denosumab on bone mineral density and bone turnover markers in rheumatoid arthritis patients switching from bisphosphonates","doi":"10.1186/s40634-019-0211-7","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s40634-019-0211-7","venue":"Journal of Experimental Orthopaedics"}

Stirred vessels are very common in the process industry and large amounts of energy can be saved by optimising their operation. Several types of unit operations such as chemical reaction, leaching, dissolution and crystallisation involve solids suspensions. Axial flow impellers are best suited for suspension of solids and therefore, pitched blade turbines were used in the present work. A standard type of stirred vessel with a single impeller and an industrial type of tank with two parallel impellers, were studied.\n The single-phase flow and the simultaneous flow of particles and liquid were investigated. Measurements were made on the single-phase flow using Laser-Doppler anemometry and on the two-phase flow using Phase-Doppler anemometry. Numerical computations were performed using the commercially available CFD-code CFX4. The two-phase calculations were done using the multi-fluid approach.\n Good agreement between the experiments and calculations was obtained for the fluid phase but the particle phase predictions were less satisfactory. The axial component of the slip velocity was generally slightly overestimated and the radial and tangential components severely underestimated by the computational model.\n The single-phase flow in a completely filled vessel equipped with a lid was investigated in detail and compared with results for a vessel lacking a lid. It was found that the influence of the lid was small and changes in the impeller discharge flow were observed only after lowering the lid to half of the vessel height.\n The simultaneous measurement of fluid and particle velocities revealed that generally, particles lag when the fluid is moving upwards and vice versa but also, that exceptions to this are common. The largest differences between the velocities of the two phases where found in regions with large mean velocity gradients such as the impeller discharge.\n For the industrial type of tank, it was found that horizontal displacement of the two impellers in opposite directions could break-up the segregated mixing zones that tended to form in the tank.","inCitations":["0ecfaac19a62816c0c385d6ef54cebe7f3d095c6"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Fluid and Solid Particle Dynamics in Stirred Vessels","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Charged particles can be accelerated efficiently in the presence of spatially corre- lated MHD waves, such as short large amplitude magnetic structures, by successive mirror reflection (Fermi process). In order to understand this process, we study the reflection probability of particles by the MHD pulses, focusing on the adiabaticity on the particle motion. When the particle velocity is small (adiabatic regime), the probability that the particle is reflected by the MHD pulse is essentially determined only by the pitch angle, independent from the velocity. On the other hand, in the non-adiabatic regime, the reflection probability is inversely proportional to the square root of the normalized velocity. We discuss our numerical as well as analytical results of the interaction process with various pulse amplitude, pulse shape, and the pulse winding number. The reflection probability is universally represented as a power law function independent from above pulse properties.","inCitations":["6d6eadb47eca2623387cee1680ec5bbd762679fa"],"pdfUrls":["http://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/docs/00/30/29/77/PDF/npg-15-265-2008.pdf","https://www.nonlin-processes-geophys.net/15/265/2008/npg-15-265-2008.pdf","https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00302977/document"],"title":"Nonadiabatic interaction between a charged particle and an MHD pulse","doi":"10.5194/npg-15-265-2008","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.5194/npg-15-265-2008","venue":""}

In this paper, we propose a different way to calculate the position of each particle which will not lead to any loose of information and will speed up the whole procedure. This was achieved by replacing the equation of positions with a novel procedure that includes a Path Relinking Strategy and a different correspondence of the velocities with the path that will follow each particle. The algorithm is used for the solution of the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem and is tested in the two classic set of benchmark instances from the literature with very good results.","inCitations":["4ce7d8995c0aac7f2f3d604e7e291560215614cf","6ef079b27f5c94632bf94bab446910e412c89474","a5f16dfab67a65240a1f7560f5109413f8907272"],"pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-37198-1_12"],"title":"Combinatorial Neighborhood Topology Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm for the Vehicle Routing Problem","doi":"10.1007/978-3-642-37198-1_12","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-37198-1_12","venue":"EvoCOP"}

Hemostatic studies, including platelet counts, platelet aggregation, assays of coagulation factors, and plasminogen activity were all within normal limits. The levels of antithrombin III, alpha 2-macroglobulin, protein C, and protein C inhibitor were also normal. However, functional protein S activity in plasma was markedly decreased (9%) in the propositus. The family study revealed that the reduced levels of functional protein S, less than 5% to 29% of normal (normal range: mean +/- 2 SD of 15 normal adults were 44 to 180%), were found in 11 members of this family over three generations. Six of 11 members had severe protein S deficiency (less than 5%), whereas five had partial deficiency. Four of eight adults with protein S deficiency had recurrent episodes of thrombosis. Immunologic levels of protein S antigen were variable in this family and did not correlate closely with the functional levels. These results suggest that the recurrent thrombotic disease in this family appears to be associated with an inherited deficiency of functional protein S.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Inherited deficiency of protein S in a Japanese family with recurrent venous thrombosis: a study of three generations","doi":"10.1182/blood.V67.2.406.406","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1182/blood.V67.2.406.406","venue":""}

Finding an explanation to this topic might have important implications for the understanding of the differences between men and women in diseases and possibly lead to the development of gender-specific strategies for its management. Recent studies have proposed that the capacitive or reservoir function of the aorta and large elastic arteries plays a major role in determining the pulse wave morphology. The pressure waveform can be explained in terms of a reservoir pressure related to arterial compliance and an “excess” or wave-related pressure associated with traveling waves. Gender-differences in the ascending aorta pressure waveform reservoir and excess components are to be characterized. The aim of this study was to evaluate, by means of a mathematical approach, gender-related differences in the central aortic pressure waveform components. Central aortic pressure waveform was non-invasively obtained in 22 healthy subjects (Age: 20 years old; 11 female). Males and females showed differences in the level and time to maximal excess pressure component, but no gender-related differences were found in the reservoir one.","inCitations":["1c8d945f777636520756103341ac1ec81355021b","d38515b9092e24688abb40cda7076fc23c51859e","0b7cb25ded009ad55c4b0573f959396c547542d7"],"pdfUrls":["https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q51367293"],"title":"Gender-related differences in the excess pressure component of central aortic pressure waveform of healthy young","doi":"10.1109/IEMBS.2011.6090037","sources":["Medline","DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEMBS.2011.6090037","venue":"2011 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society"}

In this study, we tested the hypothesis that upregulation of hypoxic inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) would improve the actions of cyclic GMP signaling following simulated ischemia-reperfusion. HIF-1α was increased with deferoxamine (150 mg/kg for 2 days). Rabbit cardiac myocytes were subjected to simulated ischemia [15 min 95% N2-5% CO2] and reperfusion [reoxygenation] to produce myocyte stunning. Cell function was measured utilizing a video-edge detector. Shortening was examined at baseline and after brain natriuretic peptide (BNP, 10-8, 10-7M) or S-nitroso-N-acetyl-penicillamine (SNAP, 10-6, 10-5M) followed by KT5823 (cyclic GMP protein kinase inhibitor, 10-6M). Kinase activity was measured via a protein phosphorylation assay. Under control conditions, BNP (-30%) and SNAP (-41%) reduced percent shortening, while KT5823 partially restored function (+18%). Deferoxamine treated control myocytes responded similarly. In stunned myocytes, BNP (-21%) and SNAP (-25%) reduced shortening less and KT5823 did not increase function (+2%). Deferoxamine increased the effects of BNP (-38%) and SNAP (-41%) in stunning and restored the effects of KT5823 (+12%). The cyclic GMP protein kinase increased phosphorylation of several proteins in control HIF-1 +/- cells. Phosphorylation was reduced in stunned cells and was restored in deferoxamine treated stunned cells. This study demonstrated that simulated ischemia-reperfusion reduced the negative functional effects of increasing cyclic GMP and this was related to reduced effects of the cyclic GMP protein kinase. Increased HIF-1α protects the functional effects of cyclic GMP thorough maintenance of cyclic GMP protein kinase activity after ischemic-reperfusion.","inCitations":["b5a91ae825fcbb80e5562378e61faef80bf642b9","b09bf18ffe9f617804afa140abf2050a43bd889f","0981e5e13bf0a408dfb4bbf9f50289e5ec31e09e","e9af32cc9884100bcd205c3fb043d91c5ddfccef","41f4ac30fbfeea8c4b56162d605b2d4965786e94","b96ba792a19c777d22c6d056cb8d2f0cc5448a94","d0ea5b4f3a495297d59a76229f9ea7e289432078","9aac7be81cf063526527fd887556009bf78b6041","dc07ad9bc35233c1beb5a8147998db01deed5f0d"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.karger.com/Article/Pdf/129634","https://www.karger.com/Article/Pdf/129634"],"title":"Hypoxia Inducible Factor-1 Improves the Actions of Nitric Oxide and Natriuretic Peptides after Simulated Ischemia-Reperfusion","doi":"10.1159/000129634","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1159/000129634","venue":"Cellular Physiology and Biochemistry"}

However, their large-scale applications are still limited by the low electrical conductivity, easy agglomeration and inferior cycling stability of the active materials. Herein, sandwich-like carbon-anchored ultrathin nanosheets are put forward for the first time as an excellent platform to achieve ultrafast lithium storage kinetics and superior cycling stability. Taking the synthetic sandwich-like carbon-anchored ultrathin TiO2 nanosheets as an example, a capacity of 101.9 mA h g−1 is achieved at a current density as high as 40 C (6.8 A g−1), while a capacity of 150.4 mA h g−1 is obtained even after 1200 cycles at a discharge rate of 5 C. This work develops an in situ carbonization of organic octylamine for fabricating sandwich-like carbon-anchored ultrathin nanosheets, holding great promise for the future design and synthesis of high-performance active materials for lithium-ion batteries.","inCitations":["f1f46adb8eae0208b44f214bd26b625976f2fb5e"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.rsc.org/suppdata/qi/c3/c3qi00050h/c3qi00050h.pdf"],"title":"Sandwich-like carbon-anchored ultrathin TiO2 nanosheets realizing ultrafast lithium storage","doi":"10.1039/C3QI00050H","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1039/C3QI00050H","venue":""}
