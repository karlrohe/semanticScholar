There is a continued prominence to leaders of the field from 25 years ago but who are now deceased, notably the top-ranked Carl Rogers. Three books on the top-10 list represent empirically supported therapies (ESTs); two are treatment manuals for an EST, and one is a self-help book derived from an EST that has itself been shown to be efficacious bibliotherapy. Differences between psychologist and nonpsychologist therapists in the choice of influential figures, authors, and books are negligible. Implications are discussed in terms of the contemporary context into which therapeutic innovations are disseminated, as well as the conditions that may be necessary for successful dissemination.

These properties, achieved through their small microstructures (100-300 nm) and unique defect structures (of grain boundaries and dislocations) make these materials ideal for lightweight medical implants and aerospace structural components. Methods of actually manufacturing UFG materials for these advanced engineering designs have yet to be considered. For UFG materials to be manufactured and used in industry, further machining research is needed to form and shape these materials into their final dimensions. Because of their high internal energy, UFG materials are known to have microstructures which are susceptible to undesirable changes at low temperatures. Since machining is a heat dissipating process, the thermal stability of UFG materials must be carefully considered as not to deteriorate their unique properties. The machinability is also of interest due to its importance in possible part production. In this study, pure nanostructured copper and titanium as well as their respective coarse grained (CG) counterparts were tested for their relative machinability and microstructure stability through lathe turning. To evaluate the machinability cutting forces, tool wear, chip morphology, and surface roughness were studied using different cutting conditions. Tungsten carbide (WC) and polycrystalline diamond (PCD) cutting tools were utilized for turning the copper iv workpieces while only PCD was used for titanium. Microstructure stability was examined by measuring grain size and dislocation density using X-ray diffraction (XRD) techniques with some subsequent electron microscopy imaging. Experimental results confirmed that both the UFG Cu and Ti bars could be machined as efficiently as their CG counterparts. Cutting forces generated were less for the UFG copper compared to the regular copper but were approximately equal for the two titanium bars. Similar tool wear patterns and mechanisms were observed for the nano and coarse grained Cu and Ti. Chip morphology changed little during the course of machining. Surface roughness was improved when machining the UFG copper bar, yet was slightly larger for the UFG titanium at higher speeds. XRD results showed little changes in grain size after machining while dislocation density was shown to reduce the greatest near the machined surface.","inCitations":["46bb9dfe3aabda939347b02aeb50868473edcfe6","96c90984cb89c4669d4145a6e8d30a7bfab32954"],"pdfUrls":["https://tigerprints.clemson.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1093&context=all_theses"],"title":"Machinability and Microstructure Stability during the Machining of Pure Copper and Titanium Processed by Equal Channel Angular Pressing","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

INTRODUCTION The electronics industry is the largest manufacturing industry in the United States, employing three times as many people as the U.S. automobile industry and contributing significantly to the major trade imbalance between the United States and other countries, most noticeably Japan.(1) Ironically, it is not American-owned companies that reap the benefits from this industry. In fact, American-owned consumer electronics companies have all but disappeared over the past few decades.(2) Several American-owned companies, which once dominated the world electronics market, have been forced out of business or have merged with Japanese companies over the past few decades.(3) As a consequence, U.S. presence in the consumer electronics market has been virtually eliminated.(4) Japanese-owned companies now dominate and control the consumer electronics market within the United States. The Japanese dominance over the consumer electronics market has helped create the enormous trade imbalance between the United States and Japan.(5) The U.S. trade deficit with Japan totalled $59.6 billion in 1991.(6) Japanese investment in the U.S. market has grown substantially over the past two decades, while U.S. investment in Japan has remained insignificant. Between 1980 and 1988, Japanese direct investment in the U.S. market increased by more than 1000%.(7) Yet, total U.S. direct investment in Japan totaled only $17 billion in 1990, which constitutes roughly one-fifth of the amount of Japanese direct investment in the United States.(8) This considerable imbalance is exacerbated by the fact that the U.S. economy is twice the size of Japan's.(8) If this trend continues, it is estimated that Japan will become the largest foreign investor in the United States by 1995, and by 1999, \"Japanese investors will hold more American assets than Britain, Holland, and Canada combined.\"(10) The influx of Japanese consumer electronics imports into the United States has greatly contributed to the trade imbalance between the two countries. In 1989 electronics contributed $20.5 billion to the trade imbalance.(11) The video cassette recorder (VCR) industry is responsible for $5 billion of the annual trade deficit.(12) This trend is likely to continue over the next few years. In the past decade, Americans have purchased 80 million VCRs and are now buying VCRs at the rate of 33,000 per day, none of which are manufactured in the United States.(13) Because Japan maintains a profound position in the U.S. consumer electronics market, it plays a critical role in influencing the policies that will determine the survival of U.S. industries, the growth of the economy, and the security of American jobs. Japanese companies have been accused of questionable business practices for the tactics which they have employed to dominate the U.S. consumer electronics industry. These business practices have prompted allegations of antitrust violations and other unfair trade practices.(14) This Note examines the most recent technique employed by Japanese companies to gain control over the U.S. consumer electronics market--the pooling of patents by Japanese cartels over critical components of electronic products. Section II of this Note outlines the structure of the Japanese business market and the keiretsu companies that dominate that market. Section III reviews allegations of antitrust violations asserted over the past few decades against the dominant Japanese consumer electronics firms. A case study of the most recent of these allegations, involving a dispute over a dual-deck video cassette recorder, is examined in section IV. Section V of this Note provides an over-view of applicable U.S. antitrust and patent laws. Section VI discusses the different types of patent pools, their economic impact, and the implications of U.S. antitrust law on patent pools. Section VII analyzes alleged unfair trade practices by Japanese companies and discusses whether such practices violate U. …","inCitations":["9a34d53798852c25588cc136d974e2b9ebf2743a","a7d9d8c3e08df81a10b333a221affe0d94d61c48"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"The Sinking of the United States Electronics Industry within Japanese Patent Pools","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

We extend these results to N observables for a quantum particle and prove uncertainty relations for the sums and products of their variances \nin terms of the commutators. \nFurthermore, we present a general theory of preparational uncertainty relations for a quantum particle in one dimension and derive conditions for a smooth function of the second moments to assume a lower bound. The Robertson-Schroedinger inequality \nis found to be of special significance and we geometrically study the space of second moments. We prove new uncertainty relations for various functions of the variances and covariance of position and momentum of a quantum particle. Some of our findings are shown to extend to more than one spatial degree of freedom and we derive \nvarious types of inequalities. \nFinally, we propose a generalisation of the Arthurs-Kelly model of joint measurement of position and momentum to incorporate the case of more than two observables and derive joint-measurement inequalities for the statistics of the probes. For the case of \nthree canonical observables and suitable definitions of error and disturbance we obtain a number of error-error-error and error-error-disturbance inequalities and show that the lower bound is identical to the preparational one.","inCitations":["28969858b7bd442f23fe5c6a2bbb9d699ad510ec"],"pdfUrls":["http://etheses.whiterose.ac.uk/13222/1/Kechrimparis%20-%20Thesis.pdf"],"title":"Uncertainty Relations for Quantum Particles","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Having fully withdrawn from the organization, the United States nevertheless maintains active contact, retaining almost as large an observer staff in Paris as its former official delegation. As a formally accredited observer, the United States presently has only two other companions-the Vatican and the Palestine Liberation Organization. The only alternative activities that the U.S. administration has identified so far as likely to receive its support are activities that are already Unesco sponsored. As the United States sits on the sidelines, it loses all opportunity to influence deliberations directly. There is a further discomfort for those who have a strong commitment to international cooperation as a means of benefiting humankind educationally and culturally. An administration so deeply indebted to the tenets of extreme conservatism as the present one in the United States seems an unlikely leader in furthering their cause. The administration came into power to cut the costs of government, to deal with domestic waste, inflation, and the escalation of public entitlements, not to propose new governmental mandates. It derives its strength from a resurgence of libertarian, individualistic values, which have not been in the mainstream of American political thinking since the isolationist years antedating the Depression. These values emphasize the virtue of self-help rather than cooperation to overcome social ills; their part in the U.S. decision to withdraw could be seen in such comments in the congressional hearings on withdrawal as the \"United states does not need Unesco.

We derive some formulas, which indicate that the representative consumer’s impatience decrease over time, and whether his risk tolerance increases or decreases over time depends on the sign of some weighted covariance between the individual consumers’ cautiousness (derivative of risk tolerance with respect to own consumptions) and impatience. These results are then used to show that the short rate tends to decrease over time and the market price of risk is volatile in some special cases of heterogeneous economies.","inCitations":["999d3310e7f638c2b9302ac6584451f5d1966387","1ac28ad8d6d2f69a5c88ba9567dd1be6b2d29311","8c539e27e07bf5df2dfb24b062454c481d8038c5","ca5477244f3c2e0ec65c53343bdd5a263f52907d","2afff6ab79f43ac6f2ef18b88e7009d3b5871480","1170349a8605c6c658377d6c9a9fa0a64e847d62"],"pdfUrls":["http://hermes-ir.lib.hit-u.ac.jp/rs/bitstream/10086/17298/1/pie_dp425.pdf","http://www.ier.hit-u.ac.jp/pie/stage2/Japanese/discussionpaper/dp2008/dp396/text.pdf","https://www.ifd.dauphine.fr/fileadmin/mediatheque/IFD/MAFE/HARA.pdf","http://www.hara.kier.kyoto-u.ac.jp/HeteroDiscount.pdf","http://www.kier.kyoto-u.ac.jp/DP/DP665.pdf","http://hermes-ir.lib.hit-u.ac.jp/rs/bitstream/10086/15916/1/pie_dp396.pdf","http://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/research/math/seminars/200708/Hara100307Two.pdf","http://cis.ier.hit-u.ac.jp/Japanese/publication/cis/dp2008/dp425/text.pdf"],"title":"Heterogeneous impatience in a continuous-time model","doi":"10.1007/s11579-009-0017-y","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11579-009-0017-y","venue":""}

Here we present field data on 19 varieties of L. corniculatus, 2 varieties of L. uliginosus and, additionally, a glasshouse experiment using 6 varieties of L. corniculatus and 2 varieties of L. uliginosus. Current methods for the quantification of condensed tannins in crop species are slow and labor intensive and are generally based upon polymer hydrolysis following the extraction of chlorophyll in a liquid phase. Presented here is a high-throughput protocol for condensed tannin quantification suitable for microtiter plates based upon the precipitation of condensed tannin polymers in complex with bovine serum albumin (BSA) with subsequent hydrolysis of precipates using butan 1-ol/ hydrochloric acid.","inCitations":["f6624a5e980021ea12c2f11f8909c3e85a9c0b5f","4a4df43256d5b09651a5dbfd659c3ea310759a2a","0a82abe6476df4d6c1f12d64b923c5199eea5bfb","daa1ea4838ba0b3757c6eb2c5641db69f49ee882"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"A high-throughput method for the quantification of proanthocyanidins in forage crops and its application in assessing variation in condensed tannin content in breeding programmes for Lotus corniculatus and Lotus uliginosus.","doi":"10.1021/jf072330+","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1021/jf072330%2B","venue":"Journal of agricultural and food chemistry"}

The extent of binding, however, tended to decrease at low albumin concentrations and higher drug concentrations; Scatchard plot analysis indicated the existence of two classes of binding sites with association constants of 34.3 x 10(-6) and 1.43 x 10(-6) M respectively.

Whether the quartz-poor DMP represents metamorphosed iron-bearing ultramafic rocks or chemical sedimentary rocks is still unclear. Pyroxene compositions in the DMP are low in Al 2 O 3 and TiO 2 , which are similar to those from the BMQ and altered marble and pyroxenite. However, the compositions are different from those in the metamorphosed ultramafic rocks. The DMP and BMQ also show similar major element contents, with dominant SiO 2 , total Fe 2 O 3 , CaO, MgO but low contents of Al 2 O 3 , TiO 2 , MnO, Na 2 O, K 2 O, indicating a similar source through submarine chemical precipitation with little input from terrestrial or volcanic materials. The BMQ, DMP and magnetite separates from these rocks exhibit seawater-like signatures of REE patterns with LREE depletion, positive La, Gd and Y anomalies and high Y/Ho ratios, indicating that seawater participated in the formation of the iron ores. Combined with strong positive Eu anomalies, we infer that the deposition of the BMQ and DMP was mainly controlled by the mixing of seawater with hydrothermal fluids. The lack of negative Ce anomalies of the DMP, BMQ and magnetite separates indicate an anoxic marine environment. The DMP is rich in carbonate but relatively poor in silica and the BMQ is rich in silica but poor in carbonate. The protoliths of the DMP and BMQ in the Tieshanmiao-type iron deposits are inferred to be quartz–carbonate iron-bearing formations which underwent subsequent metamorphism.","inCitations":["c197d00d202005c0855044d4f48f041f0a1e1461"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Origin of the disseminated magnetite pyroxenite in the Tieshanmiao-type iron deposits in the Wuyang region of Henan Province, China","doi":"10.1016/j.jseaes.2015.03.050","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jseaes.2015.03.050","venue":""}

This contrasts with the opposite, inhibitory effect produced by skeletal muscle tropomyosin. The degree of activation or inhibition depends on the ionic conditions, which influence the affinities of tropomyosin and HMM or SF1 for actin as well as on the molar ratio of actin to myosin. \n \nEnzyme kinetic analysis indicates that the inhibitory effect of skeletal muscle tropomyosin results from an approximately six- to tenfold increase in the apparent affinity (Kapp) of the myosin head for the F-actin-tropomyosin complex with a concomitant six- to tenfold reduction in the maximal turnover rate (Vmax). Thus, there is no direct competition of skeletal muscle tropomyosin and myosin for the same site on actin. Brain tropomyosin has an opposite effect, decreasing the apparent affinity with concomitant increase in the Vmax. \n \nThe effect of smooth muscle tropomyosin is more complex. At high ratios of myosin to actin this tropomyosin produces the same change in the Kapp as skeletal muscle tropomyosin but yields a value of Vmax that is about twofold higher. At lower molar ratios (below about 1 to 5 myosin subfragments to actin) the activating effect of this tropomyosin remains unchanged while the apparent affinity decreases to that observed for pure F-actin. \n \nOn the basis of these data as well as from experiments carried out at fixed actin and varying SF1 concentrations, it is concluded that tropomyosins act in general as allosteric un-competitive inhibitors or activators of actomyosin by increasing or reducing the co-operative activation of myosin by actin at the level of product release.","inCitations":["76cf0565d5b92530528c095ea321d98d681efbc5","499d0dfb1763c0e23d2e0b01b07b30ebeec3fecb","02e7e98e3b91972e2ea3c97c85ef2becb6c8512a","8ce7f5a66d4c61d74c1b6c0f9c0a9b00efc3ea7b","56ad819f4afc38d25fe184aec5d1d36ce6ba3e83","9068c22400f7364e9f001a53fb219a8440ddcf7e"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Steady-state kinetic studies on the actin activation of skeletal muscle heavy meromyosin subfragments.

Folic acid (FA) offers a means of targeting human cells that greatly overexpress the folate receptor (FR). By the use of confocal microscopy and quantitative flow cytometry analysis, we demonstrate the receptor-mediated delivery of FA-conjugated nanocomposites targeting FR-positive cell lines, such as KB cells. The receptor-mediated targeting was confirmed by a comparison with the uptake of these nanocomposites in FR-negative cell lines, such as MCF-7. These results show that the silica-coated upconverting nanophosphor (UCNP) nanocomposites prepared by our strategy can potentially be useful as multimodal bioimaging agents.","inCitations":["8fd93a3f25f10f00205f3bc023ddf7cee9544cc9","205fc8c6a55455a09cedb8bb623382954a60cfdd","dcf2a3adf4b91aa10016e20b98a5e7b261adef02","344ad1aa80af792f8441266768aeb2aaf24cbb9d","dfaad8730eae4806ec8ab33f7df3fb1964bd182a","b91d5f8be66398f8f859663e6e39ea1b138e53bf","37226abac9bafaba985d961758f9c585ec5a496a","c38b01175652d188c4097f034cc093cdbe7775d8","a8ad89d53446f0d9446c7fd8db61e363d78b7e41","0dcd9f68e1d9ea56581c70640948a5fbbf43c3ba","37486b4bdda4c7b60dc432fc8cf7794c9e14a76f","d90e07d953bcba1de94ae0c1b889b8e6c7fc8344","665eff1c5ea9fe15171a73083709145cab786dad","a864b124de95ff6fdd2e0bded10ea1e7c7afa222","b1c025120a5eb1a9a885842dfcb7c0ebeb50a0da","fd9bacbbee86657fb707950ea8417223889f8f22","14a5f3e1cdfd12692770a25b30c4e68d5ee337bd","fd5604787c7c26640e9d4bf8d5991bec1793e808","291925d81bc81df6c265486d8a78ff3d9e99cf02","288b733698e1a1c6c50f989dba367c3058e4ce11","60378cedcf09123fc81572ba3cae368508a68e12","79da96ce756fd8dcdeeb5e6bf327951ae87b329a","64502bb4e7125d7674e4e75dfc49f8d35ca988ec","0fb3cbd0cacae94686e6821cd0073371f320a51b","22c3eb0d280080e05d1083f901c0f4ba510fc723","212f763359291d483e5dde62cabe388755b5a494","fa19ae6ff270a7c6837cfbd05e095f1bb1c58e9d","9c3eeb44e62de2ebc367833326bc3966883bc7cb","8efe080bab0e298c36b98a12063c053b6343a3d6","7c235d65e8add392d485b42cd95ecad07860f342","2ad9c4f6368f424189f8deeee6e9e484ac306e9c","e84954a5cd4b6059da00184d2f49b35a039e1ea9","2d23814bf73e973e338d03e29cdacc8610ac0f4e","f297dc03a5500d114b2c25f2279aa5589dc5249c","cd2d3c323fdeb8fd53e748fa1c9d9e1995c70f0c","c074ae812a3222697f682090021fe18b47a47e2f","5bc6c1a663643efaea93d45747c3f431b608b49f","be71bf306915c110aec3f729862ec9f6599f455c","71c734775ef38cb2b77effe03beabb24566a1fe1","e7dc2dec1d8229dd1f01bf42cf94bcf6cd669179","9445a952156e353de74286fdc3b717f1305fe655","e9216aedcb5f8fe9eeed60840fc8b4bd8ab24bc1","d8ba5e21f8d5a10ab44be816c591bc6e3f06cfb0","2229e7d6cabbaf97dc2d777a8a3ffc44e32490f8","e22894b2e95782fb4d7ded8b7a13cc059de2c36c","157d2563ddfde60e0c4c66dd801f2f151605a711","73c8ed19f465c3ddd8b903b06c72a951776b5a6d","ccdafc236770d15eb2dbb920bf672c6c599c933c","ffd37c35e2656df3e54be31e7282e515491cbe71","e1ca0c3497f443a5d13d260dbdb887507a93f98a","b7e0ffde7054392441a2e761a6716202f2351cf9"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Multimodal-luminescence core-shell nanocomposites for targeted imaging of tumor cells.","doi":"10.1002/chem.200802261","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1002/chem.200802261","venue":"Chemistry"}

Seedlings in the ages of <2, 2–4 and 4–6 months were infested with 75 field-collected coconut mites and the population growth was determined up to six weeks after introduction. The populations of coconut mites increased exponentially up to five weeks after introduction and declined thereafter on seedlings of all ages with significant differences among the three groups of seedlings occurring over time. At week 5, a significantly higher mean number (±SE) of coconut mites (20,098 ± 3,465) was bred on 4–6-month-old seedlings than on smaller seedlings, and on the largest seedlings the numbers were highest at all time intervals, except at week 2. Neoseiulus baraki was reared on embryo culture seedlings of the three age groups infested with coconut mites, by introduction of five female deutonymphs and one male, three weeks after introducing coconut mites. Predator numbers progressed significantly over time, but the size of seedlings did not significantly influence the numbers. On all groups of seedlings, the mean \nnumber of N. baraki increased up to two weeks after introduction on to seedlings and then declined. Many coconut mites were successfully reared in the laboratory for a longer period by this method and it could also be used as an alternative method to rear N. baraki.

We develop an aggregate model to infer the distributions of agents at meso level using representative states. In particular, we estimate the access probability for agents in different states consistently with macroscopic economic constraints. The model is calibrated on the basis of a sample of firms, drawn from the AMADEUS database, within the manufacturing industry made up of nine sectors of economic activity from 1995 to 2004, and results come to experimental proof at aggregate macroscopic level.","inCitations":["6041abaeaef2fe43bfa46dea5764bc6ad786ed17","92fe181f2e943b898743f5163cf470f457b4f4a7"],"pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1142/S021952590800201X"],"title":"A MaxEnt Model for Macroscenario Analysis","doi":"10.1142/S021952590800201X","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1142/S021952590800201X","venue":"Advances in Complex Systems"}

This paper presents a method of decoupling the stator and rotor contributions to total cogging torque. Rotor causes are further decoupled into magnet placement and strength variation. Decoupling is possible due to stator and rotor affected harmonics being independent of one another. Magnet strength and position decoupling is based on the analysis of the cogging torque waveform generated by the rotor interaction with a single slot stator and utilizes the zero torque produced when a single magnet is directly over a slot. Superposition and least squares minimization is then used to determine strength variation and simulate cogging torque with and without placement and strength variation. Analysis of ten production stators and rotors is presented and discussed, with the overall findings confirming that for the motors tested, the largest contributors to manufacturing induced cogging torque were the stator, magnet placement inaccuracy and magnet strength variation. Eliminating stator variation would improve cogging torque by 45%, perfect magnet placement would result in a 29% reduction in cogging torque and eliminating magnet strength variations would achieve a 7% reduction.","inCitations":["70c9e08436a2c96bba73cd6dbfd1370ceef415c3","f895ed36545f838d62300fcd96c4ba70a99c905c","b7b01a012353360a49029092f019c8faa7b5157a","0b37b96a610ae23af51f9d7d6faa132c325c8a94","c26207a22a8cf7d15c52a135ffb4f1923292deb7","73d453cbf28e5ebcfc40e31d03aa1c7eacc7250d","a70fc243536cf713b3b9751ca6bd9d4f292c9e60","e78c7a3168ee69ed1a624c472ad8aee4fbb4a102"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Decoupling manufacturing sources of cogging torque in fractional pitch PMSM","doi":"10.1109/IEMDC.2011.5994939","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEMDC.2011.5994939","venue":"2011 IEEE International Electric Machines & Drives Conference (IEMDC)"}

We wanted to evaluate whether patients using a tablet computer aimed at improving self-care behavior could do so and also whether it affects quality of life and health-related quality of life, disease knowledge, and in-hospital days. Methods and Results: Patients with HF (n = 82) were randomized to the intervention group (IG) with a tablet computer (giving information and advice) or the control group (CG) that was subject to standard care. Study was completed by 72 patients, with a mean (SD) age of 75 (8) years, 68% male, and 74% NYHA class III. Self-care behavior measured with the 9-item European Heart Failure Self-Care Behaviour Scale, health related quality of life measured by the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire, quality of life measured by the Swedish version of the Health Survey, knowledge measured by the Dutch Heart Failure Knowledge Scale, days in hospital, and adherence were analyzed. The IG displayed better 9-item European Heart Failure Self-Care Behaviour Scale score (median IG, 16.5 [interquartile range {IQR}, 12–22], vs median CG, 23.5 [IQR, 18.8–30.0]; P < .05) and improved health related quality of life (median IG, 72.7 [IQR, 50.8–87.9], vs median CG, 51.8 [IQR, 40.9–62.8]; P < .05). A significant difference in knowledge was seen, with an 11% increase in IG and a 1% decrease in CG (P < .05), as well as a reduction in hospital days in IG by 2.7 days per patient (relative risk, 0.72; 95% confidence interval, 0.61–0.84; P < .05). Conclusion: The tablet computer significantly improved self-care behavior and health related quality of life, increased HF knowledge, and reduced hospital days.","inCitations":["49c9d9a00849f2cc639496e1ba33d1a9c10d172e","e4bb39c8fd2eee6c8b0265377fcc8edb6e389a2d","1b969de1459ce265da3bfbee52947c633457be56","fd7d5427699dd2392f16569ee09efd9519192421"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Effects of a Tablet Computer on Self-care, Quality of Life, and Knowledge: A Randomized Clinical Trial","doi":"10.1097/JCN.0000000000000462","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1097/JCN.0000000000000462","venue":"The Journal of cardiovascular nursing"}

The photoelectrocatalytic (PEC) activity toward degradation of methyl orange (MO) aqueous solutions under visible-light irradiation (λ > 420 nm) by p−n junction BiOI/TiO2 NTs was investigated. The results from the current study demonstrate that the as-prepared BiOI/TiO2 junction NTs display much greater PEC activity than the respective pure BiOI and TiO2 counterparts due to the synergetic effects of several factors including the strong visible absorption, the formation of p−n junction, and the impact of external electrostatic field.

Spiniform structures are present in the proximal part of the uterus of X. achalae, X. amazonensis and X. balcarceanus and appear to be attached in a uterine network. Spines seem to be absent from the uteri of X. minor, X. saladillensis and X. tucumanensis, but this needs further confirmation.

Shpall","ids":["48091377"]}],"journalName":"Blood","paperAbstract":"Background: Over the past decade, bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (BM-MSCs) have been used therapeutically in a variety of clinical settings including graft versus host disease, ischemic/non-ischemic cardiovascular disease, ischemic stroke and as gene-delivery vehicles. Limitations with BM-MSCs include the declining number and differentiation potential of the cells with increasing donor age, the inconsistent quality of BM-MSC products and the invasiveness of the requisite BM aspiration procedure. Following a normal infant birth, the cord blood tissue (CBt) is typically discarded, thus collection of the starting material is non-invasive. CBt-MSCs can expand to higher numbers more rapidly than BM-MSCs, and have similar immunosuppressive properties. We therefore chose to develop a GMP-compliant procedure to generate large numbers of CBt-MSCs for clinical use. Methods. CBt was obtained from consented healthy mothers of full term neonates following elective cesarean section. The CBt was transported in plasmalyte with penicillin/streptomycin. The CBt was cut into 7 equal fractions and incubated for 76 minutes in 370C in C-Tubes (Miltenyi) with various enzyme combinations including collagenase-NB4/6(Serva) and hyaluronidase (Sigma Aldrich) with or without DNase (Genentech) in the GentleMACS Octo Dissociator (Miltenyi). The cell suspension was filtered, washed and resuspended in alpha-MEM media containing 10% Platelet lysate, L-glutamine, heparin (complete media) with pen-strep and seeded into T175 flasks, then cultured until the MSCs were 80% confluent. The cells were harvested and expanded to P1 in T175 flasks to 80% confluence using complete media without antibiotics. After harvest of P1, the MSCs were analyzed for the expression of the typical MSC surface markers by flow cytometry and cryopreserved. Expansion was subsequently performed in a Quantum Bioreactor (Terumo) for 5-6 days. Immunosuppressive potential of CBt-MSCs was tested in vitro by CD4+ T cell proliferation assay (CFSE) and CD4+ T cell cytokine secretion assay. Half of the CBt-MSCs were preactivated with Interferon Gamma, then seeded into a 96 well plate and the others were seeded untreated. The following day, the MSCs were incubated with 10⁵ isolated CD4+ T cells at ratios of 1:1, 1:2, 1:10 and 1:20. CD3/28 beads (ThermoFisher Scientific) were added to all wells except the negative control. Isolated T cells were stained with CFSE for 10 minutes then incubated with 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS) prior to co-culture with MSCs. After 72 hours, the wells were treated with BFA (10X), PMA (100X) and ionomycin (10X). Half of the wells were harvested, washed and stained with anti-CD4 (Biolegend) and Live-Dead dye (ThermoFisher Scientific). After Cytofix/Cytoperm Fixation and Permeabilization Solution (BD Biosciences), then 1X buffer were added, cells were stained for IL-2 (BD), TNF-alpha (BD) and Interferon gamma (BD Biosciences). On day 5, the remaining wells were harvested and stained with anti- CD4-APC (Biolegend) and Live-Dead (ThermoFisher Scientific). Flow cytometry was performed on all samples using the Fortessa X20 (BD Biosciences), then analyzed with FlowJo software. Results Following enzymatic digestion, the samples without DNase had poor P0 to P1 growth (less than 80% confluent by day 10) thus were eliminated. NB4, hyaluronidase and DNase became the standard enzyme combination. After seeding the Bioreactor with a median of 51 x 10E6 CBt-MSCs (range 45 to 62x10E6 cells), expansion in the Bioreactor for 5-6 days yielded a median of 1495 x 10E6 CBt-MSCs (range 1245 to 1935 x 10E6). The median doubling time (the time required for MSCS to proliferate and double in number) for CBt-MSCs was 28.2 hours (range 24.5 to 29.7) (n=3). The immunosuppression assay demonstrated that CBt MSCs inhibit the proliferation of CD4+ T cells in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, CBt-MSCs reduce the cytokine expression on stimulated CD4+ T cells (interferon-gamma, tumor necrosis factor-a, IL-2) with each successive generation of CD4+ T-cells. Conclusion: We standardized a GMP-compliant protocol for the isolation of MSCs from whole CBt. Large-scale expansion of CBt-MSCs with immunosuppressive properties can be generated quickly and efficiently in the Terumo bioreactor. Clinical trials with these cells are planned.

Current therapy, consisting of corticosteroids and calcineurin inhibitors, fails to achieve a sustained remission in most patients. Therefore, there is a pressing need to develop new treatments for this glomerulopathy. Traditional approaches have focused on agents that modulate the immune system. In this review, we summarize preclinical and clinical data with newer agents that may ameliorate FSGS. We focus on drugs that inhibit immune injury or inflammation, such as abatacept, rituximab, adalimumab, and stem cells. The potential of agents that block the glomerular action of circulating permeability factors such as soluble urokinase receptor is reviewed. Finally, because fibrosis represents the final common pathway of glomerular damage in FSGS, the experience with a wide range of antifibrotic agents is presented. Despite extensive research on the podocyte dysfunction in the pathogenesis of FSGS, there are few agents that directly target podocyte structure or viability. We conclude that FSGS is a heterogeneous disorder and that intensified translational research is vital to improve our understanding of distinct subtypes that have a defined prognosis and predictable response to targeted therapeutic interventions.","inCitations":["7d4df3c6f53bb539f9f530432ce65132e2a8f684","68d633c75e414146d8e61399c2c81ae98a2b75ec","212a6ead4554ea89c03122f205a78106d320af56","7f2bd37fe649b4b9926a365735633b6b4cc67c2c","53df70e0bcfb233701bf898963936891fc435985","a5bae2786345ddee5d6c9bcdc732212ca0b6ee5c","17b0dd58f9c321adab214a423acd7d5a6e617899","6565d4591cbe91b38cd3f2abf33943e4ae967de1","24b29320a594791d18b03fab808e256544e72a08","e8cd2d13cd8525c5036996e33356b42a8283f9c1","899fe233e3ab2947baba142b918743ef53c1f007","b4df5293fdb7a10dbe028bae8447ecc731333eb4","18fb502e9d877175d51c02e24bf5621163c1a2ac","f733d2e07153c3377abc5f4d22782a401cd17336","ff6954316dda2896439e4dbbce4f585f9118e9aa","fda1a4667016034806d6f01af27221b19ffc82d2","f1786cdc34708dc216c88135daf58f5f789f4597","59fde5d7943297d0557a3f59c0d86dd9e2565ae9","a3934feec91e818856884ffcc43e52c4acde8e24","1cec32658650c0e4952ac94b2a36b11f433943cd"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Novel therapies for FSGS: preclinical and clinical studies.","doi":"10.1053/j.ackd.2014.10.001","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1053/j.ackd.2014.10.001","venue":"Advances in chronic kidney disease"}

The first part of the study identified optimal drop height for all subjects using the maximum jump height method. The identified optimal drop heights were later used during the DYNDJ protocol. The second part compared the 3 warm-up protocols above to determine their effect on 20-m sprint performance. Twenty-nine subjects (age, 20.8 ± 4.4 years; weight, 82.6 ± 9.9 kg; height, 180.3 ± 6.2 cm) performed 3 protocols of a C protocol, a DYN protocol, and a DYNDJ protocol in a randomized order. A 20-m sprint was performed 1 minute after the completion of each of the 3 protocols. Results displayed significant differences between each of the 3 protocols. A significant improvement (p = 0.001) of 2.2% was obtained in sprint time between the C protocol (3.300 ± 0.105 seconds) and the DYN protocol (3.227 ± 0.116 seconds), a further significant improvement of 5.01% was attained between the C and the DYNDJ protocols (3.300 ± 0.10 vs. 3.132 ± 0.120 seconds; p = 0.001). In addition, a significant improvement (p = 0.001) of 2.93% was observed between the DYN protocol (3.227 ± 0.116 seconds) and the DYNDJ protocol (3.132 ± 0.116 seconds). The data from this study advocate the use of DYNDJ protocol as a means of significantly improving 20-m sprint performance 1 minute after the DYNDJ protocol.","inCitations":["79a326c2903c2a9fb2c31214c5da19f3fd644dad","48fa8e330e87b70d2c4d1ddb220d1fc0b1a54bdf","417d9ed4f38c9986809c16acefff68c307aca764","66dc0477882a68099483621d89f1c0591d79b2e8","9000a907a209865aeda67a895cdff5454c375933","bd3acd9340d2010f931a273887b2cce3c62c3ddd","36b461d7a4a48d2e83f34984d99c36df0360a5c2","949e4f9a72dadaf178b258eb99601d0411bc8e8f","d07670ee9952fce04321a8ffa275d7e1d44bd2eb","0d0362206f5663e3a2aa8ee31d6dd8d58d7b736e","ecb0449d6b253e6bac8906a5092c0cfa9f18620e","66e78b5277f001f5bb44ba54159828b0a0f74e3f","e7ea87981cbe6313f0ecd44ed770a0891ab545ae","e531b0f5b16a8e5600e7d21cf90c9c982bdc25cc","13eb7fdad14c4b05a2e4090768cfb15bdf2c9afa","d8a0c63adde947d14935134cd28db52697748cc0","fc84914d8202bd3f84b53fa174bb31624e890d32","79b982e98d9c79d23900b24eaf0d9904004e532e","dec5b886212421af51dfe6591b82af0adf40a1ee","8630c101fbf8f9502d591b2244413ffde1142c65","9a2df82cb397de191f895d55f0d64e3dde0f4c0c"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Acute potentiating effect of depth jumps on sprint performance.","doi":"10.1519/JSC.0b013e3182a0d8c1","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1519/JSC.0b013e3182a0d8c1","venue":"Journal of strength and conditioning research"}

Survival of the transfected lines in a 'TK+ selective medium' indicated that the viral gene was actively expressed at a level sufficient to rescue the TK-deficient phenotype of the parent line. Unlike the parental cells, TK+ transformants (TK6:hsv cells) were sensitive to 5-bromodeoxyuridine, and contained DNA corresponding to the constructs introduced by transfection. This TK selection system will facilitate recovery of other cotransfected, non-selectable mosquito genes in cultured cells. Transformed cells were treated with several antiviral drugs to define conditions for a 'suicide selection' system, in which cells expressing the viral thymidine kinase enzyme (TK) under the control of an inducible promoter would be selectively destroyed, whereas cells expressing the endogenous mosquito enzyme would remain relatively unaffected. The anti-herpetic drug (E)-5-(2-bromovinyl)-2'-deoxyuridine (BVDU) showed greater cytotoxicity against transformed cells expressing the viral enzyme, and less toxicity to wild-type mosquito cells. This cell culture system provides a model for initial evaluation of suicide selection systems that may ultimately be adapted to the mosquito using sex- or tissue-specific promoters to drive expression of heterologous genes.","inCitations":["4ec654488c7055c4522fc8ca574baaa8001e2352","eb119e75f7906c5eecdc4e8507d3dc472a1e5de3","13a60875ad43622114789739a68dbaba458b4e1b","91ceaffbcc9b5c506a334cab8d6656d3abaeabc1","0e875abe4f5b17fecc91a5c809436b22377dc016","ee7fd0e89f22c54484d8f01a780bea69b2e5c4ef"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Evaluation of a viral thymidine kinase gene for suicide selection in transfected mosquito cells.","doi":"10.1111/j.1365-2583.1995.tb00017.x","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2583.1995.tb00017.x","venue":"Insect molecular biology"}

Full participant, participant observer, and full observer were the three methods of observation used in the various social settings.

Here, we have used solvation dynamics to monitor the changes in a specific domain of the multidomain protein human serum albumin (HSA) in the presence of various crowders. The solvation probe 6-bromoacetyl-2-dimethylaminonaphthalene was site-specifically attached to the cysteine-34 of domain I of HSA. Analyses of the time-resolved Stokes shift of this probe in the presence of crowding agents revealed a significant retardation of the solvent coordinate, particularly in a crowder-dependent manner. We attribute the observed slowing primarily to the increased internal protein friction in the presence of these polymers, implying considerable stiffness of the protein matrix. We have discussed our findings with regard to recent reports on cellular interiors and have also made an attempt to assess the importance of the physiological concentration of macromolecules in protein dynamics and function.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Crowder-Induced Rigidity in a Multidomain Protein: Insights from Solvation.","doi":"10.1021/acs.jpcb.6b10478","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.6b10478","venue":"The journal of physical chemistry.
