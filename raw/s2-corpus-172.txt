Due to its ability to act as an ER-intraluminal Ca2+ sensor, it regulates store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE), which is a Ca2+ influx pathway involved in a wide variety of signalling pathways in eukaryotic cells. Despite its important role in Ca2+ transport, current knowledge about the role of STIM1 in neurons is much more limited. Growing evidence supports a role for STIM1 and SOCE in the preservation of dendritic spines required for long-term potentiation and the formation of memory. In this regard, recent studies have demonstrated that the loss of STIM1, which impairs Ca2+ mobilization in neurons, risks cell viability and could be the cause of neurodegenerative diseases. The role of STIM1 in neurodegeneration and the molecular basis of cell death triggered by low levels of STIM1 are discussed in this review.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/pmc/oa_pdf/e3/41/WJBC-9-16.PMC6288638.pdf"],"title":"Role of STIM1 in neurodegeneration","doi":"10.4331/wjbc.v9.i2.16","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.4331/wjbc.v9.i2.16","venue":"World journal of biological chemistry"}

Several studies have documented that peer victimization is positively associated with PIU. However, little is known about \"how\" (i.e., mediation mechanisms) and \"under what conditions\" (i.e., moderation mechanisms) peer victimization is associated with adolescent PIU. To contribute to this gap in the knowledge, this study used a large sample of Chinese adolescents (N = 2758; Mage = 13.53 years, SD = 1.06) to examine deviant peer affiliation (DPA) as a mediator and family functioning as a moderator in this relationship. Students completed anonymous questionnaires to measure the main variables. After controlling for important covariates related to PIU, the results indicated that (a) peer victimization was positively associated with PIU, (b) DPA partially mediated the link between peer victimization and PIU, and (c) family functioning moderated the association between peer victimization and DPA. Specifically, for adolescents with better family functioning, the relationship between peer victimization and DPA was weaker. The current research deepens our understanding of \"how\" and \"under what conditions\" peer victimization is related to PIU in adolescents.","inCitations":["da1e8d933132d6bdd6fe212b5827a3baa1d37c01","d2584d71b45af515a74391925a04bc62ad19e832"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Peer victimization and problematic internet use in adolescents: The mediating role of deviant peer affiliation and the moderating role of family functioning.","doi":"10.1016/j.addbeh.2019.04.016","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.addbeh.2019.04.016","venue":"Addictive behaviors"}

The complexity of the interactions among the physical environment, forest growth, the management and utilisation of forest resources, and market responses has stimulated efforts to model the impact of global changes on the forest sector by linking impact models developed from different disciplines. This paper reviews existing experiences in integrated forest sector impact assessments. Different ways of integrating cross-disciplinary impact assessments are classified as linking, coupling and integrated modelling. To date the most common method is a “one-way” linking, where results from one model are used as input to a different model. When different impact models are coupled, feedbacks can be analysed, e.g. between ecological and economic systems. Integrated modelling is described as a third step, where different sub-models are embedded into a common model framework. The concept of balance is introduced as a key to successful integration of different disciplines in integrated assessment (IA) studies. The review of existing experiences emphasises the problem of complexity and the need to simplify disciplinary approaches. It also illustrates how methodologies applied to forest sector IA studies have evolved over the last few years. Several scaling issues that are particularly important for IA modelling in forestry are discussed, including the consequences of heterogeneity in site conditions, the variable influence of extreme events on ecosystems and on the economic sector, and the differences in temporal and spatial scales over which key forest growth and renewal processes operate. Climate impact assessments include uncertainties. Some common sources of uncertainty in forest IA modelling are outlined, and methods that have been used to address this uncertainty are reviewed. We discuss the policy relevance of integrated impact assessments and stress the importance of stakeholder involvement in IA projects. The paper concludes with some recommendations for future developments in this relatively new field of research.","inCitations":["b79d295d8b45df6937689cba24cfefca0874de74","f5695deffd2082d3a045de873e06dc9cf8f934d6","e82449aa749cc5ccf770ec9c853216be1a0d464b","d2d2109b07e45af982ec0fed31853d0ca0abca6f","23f001dd8d5d00bced4d681c844735103f0bb182","a0d2b4e4fa3db7c7784308ea1d08f2fa49fe9618","fa75598d7931ccf45d0bcd8a448b54a114f0020c","c0b112852dc9f57e480262ad85b70f036982af47","156058bdf79447ad095fbe4cd5a32e9f2727bc2b","5a59bbe3c05acd707dbdc93282a5475334f32019","53b8162ce42264db81ac37897dae4b38cc5a0f64","213309027546294d8ec3b2a759e30fb9c57f28e4","09996f464614df2a6cf46dc0c684b89d06e3b1ee","108b085ced12b4f2ab93245aaff4caaad908fa39","bb1860d173859f8bff2a76479697bbaebd8f07c1","a959b58ecba22a85ee675fccd27837cecbed1b7f","ba0b75eafb7be4891db0e5bb1025121468668fc7","85ced184f06f8de28d6305f64b4dc705b76f6f82","d3cb38cbc7f708171731f3c03d4ecc9f34ef48c1","56d413f99c20e84fc8fea4f27b40219cad5a73e7","bfdade1697620fbd0cd59ec2c57c9c03dc3da789","ae64f1605c45274f4e680d1f88c05f3595bb637b","feb1c8bdf9c9d649a7dc1ea13d65f577ebfe67fb","4f0ce95c0d0fd472ed550ab86a06ed75af956850","eb8ce1a1be0629c02499b79dfb2e6bfa39503ab3","c60c89c6c7b0f7746d330bc0e2b77addd57ed001","8de771c312d6a33203a1e41be80f5f6a0a1404e8","8d5c90c3a5617da4cb58adb248020bbb7b13f9fc","6cf63499d615ed0302cad42cf414f9064ce85819","b258f30c05bd43f338b80557b7615ee897775b3d"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Integrated forestry assessments for climate change impacts","doi":"10.1016/S0378-1127(02)00054-3","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/S0378-1127%2802%2900054-3","venue":""}

Information objects are not isolated anymore. They are frequently connected via metadata, semantic links, etc. This leads to various challenges in graph-based information retrieval. This paper is concerned with the reachability analysis of multimodal graph modelled collections. We use our framework to leverage the combination of features of different modalities through our formulation of faceted search. This study highlights the effect of different facets and link types in improving reachability of relevant information objects. The experiments are performed on the Image CLEF 2011 Wikipedia collection with about 400,000 documents and images. The results demonstrate that the combination of different facets is conductive to obtain higher reachability. We obtain 373% recall gain for very hard topics by using our graph model of the collection. Further, by adding semantic links to the collection, we gain a 10% increase in the overall recall.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q59607672","https://publik.tuwien.ac.at/files/publik_264569.pdf"],"title":"A faceted approach to reachability analysis of graph modelled collections","doi":"10.1007/s13735-017-0145-8","sources":["Medline","DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s13735-017-0145-8","venue":"International Journal of Multimedia Information Retrieval"}

The developed visualization has potential to help users in this context, by interacting with different views, it allows to combine a document search by similarity and by different topics. We conducted an evaluation, to measure the usability of the developed application, and its utility, to validate the data visualized.

The continued worldwide emancipation of women and rising income and wealth inequalities all change how we see ourselves and treat others. We are also changing how we wish to be grouped and seen. The BBC class survey (http://www.bbc.co.uk/ news/magazine-22000973) and the article published simultaneously in Sociology (Savage et al., 2013) have generated considerable public discussion in the media but that debate is still largely parochially British. A public debate was initiated over how class is defined and about the relevance of social class in the contemporary world. Contributors ranging, in occupational class terms, from celebrity comics to the elite of the intellectual commentariat began to re-engage with the importance of social class as an explanatory concept. But if class matters as much as we now think it does we need to know how it is changing and how we can help change it for the better.","inCitations":["4003d917cd40b4ed6acdfbaf43b3de65d78874fb","2084f8a94d225c3e30b497f54ab95aa469f118a6","438d47542faf992964682de7c6696cc8c1e2c253","355aaad862d575ac06520714000c1dfc4235d5d7","a53730cd34d057b22fbbadcc26d65879b373c413","f7f6c1bb03484db024b1d1f4ca676ddc0fd33c75","4d517c4af168abe3ffac9803e85bb24f6cb9fbb1","adb1e86097a48ed5569d2571cf33bc8121ffd469","4885612ebd4fb8a4776e386fc2d4be4be969c908","2fa728b11115e17d827959d0b4e8351f6e573abf","fe5db4689c8696ee660b5e56a97491280ba638a8","7fbfb80fa227e91bc78c596e035f16b773daeaf4"],"pdfUrls":["https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:c554227c-5ae3-4229-9633-46282e012d1a/download_file?file_format=pdf&safe_filename=ThinkinAboutClass_Dorling.pdf&type_of_work=Journal+article","http://www.dannydorling.org/wp-content/files/dannydorling_publication_id4074.pdf"],"title":"Thinking about Class","doi":"10.1177/0038038514523171","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1177/0038038514523171","venue":""}

The facility includes discrete air volumes which can be varied to alter the pumping system’s compliance, and hence susceptibility, to surge. With this facility, the first detailed measurements of surge behavior for a low specific speed, shrouded, centrifugal pump have been obtained and compared with theoretical predictions. The pump tested is a geometrically and dynamically scaled model of a small industrial pump with known surge tendencies. A thorough characterization of the surge phenomenon has been performed, including surge cycle frequency, amplitude, point(s) of inception, and variations with operating point. The results underline the dominant role of: (1) the shape of the pump performance characteristic and (2) the system stability (B) parameter in determining the pump behavior. A simple 1-D model of the pumping system is shown to capture all observed trends in the experimental data. The model accounts for variations in pump wheel speed with mass flow, and employs a first order time lag in pressure rise to model the pump response.Copyright © 1994 by ASME","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Dynamic Surge Behavior of a Centrifugal Pumping System","doi":"10.1115/94-GT-150","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1115/94-GT-150","venue":""}

The ultra high frequency (UHF) band 1 (225 - 400 MHz) seems to be a good compromise giving acceptable range and coverage with acceptable bandwidth. The paper reports on adapting commercial-based technology for military applications. It describes a solution for UHF 225 - 400 MHz wideband ad hoc tactical wireless local area network (TWLAN) based on the IEEE 802.11b standard in order to emphasize on commercial developments of wireless radios. The ad hoc routing protocol used is the optimized link state routing (OLSR) protocol. Two systems are presented. One system based on a modified D-link IEEE 802.11b WLAN card were frequency was converted to 323 MHz, output power at 3 W but without rate reduction. The other system was similar but with the bandwidth reduced by a factor of four giving 250, 500, 1375 and 2750 kbit/s. Two versions of this radio were used: a small \"soldier version\" at 1 Watt output power and one \"vehicle mounted version\" at 3 Watts output power. The radios are used between vehicles in a squadron and also between the soldiers within a unit and through the unit's vehicle back to head quarter. Calculations indicate 2.5 kilometers transmission range within 50% probability according to Egli (1957). The measurements show that communication limited by attenuation is possible within a few kilometers with high probability but the signal is susceptible to multipath fading. Since there is no forward error correction (FEC) implemented in 802.11b, adaptive FEC would probably improve performance at the two lower bit rates that uses BPSK and QPSK modulation","inCitations":["0bfa9c084be918611eecfee21d010e97b6e386bd","053d7e0d0a74871f246bdea3bd9f7f1d66d45777","7a750624da88a6ed3d206d8dc59cb4a3c32f016c","1916794acf68a35ef011f1a9e92b1d5e803253fe","1c45378582c491b6c9198ee43cac086366387bbf","7f21d766a5dcf051df7d45bd949487c22fd435ea","68e9c21ea6a9bdd8f8ac50a39dbcc67acaf9da43","12c61b2be47aafd9df42b39e01e130d18c028472"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Field trials with IEEE 802.11b-based UHF tactical wideband radio","doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.2005.1605731","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MILCOM.2005.1605731","venue":"MILCOM 2005 - 2005 IEEE Military Communications Conference"}

In this chapter, a model for the prediction of the formability of an MWK fabric to a 3-D surface is described. For this purpose, a detailed characterization of the forming behaviour of MWK fabrics containing two bias inserting yarns (TBMWK fabrics) is made. A mathematical model is established for predicting the deformations of TBMWK fabrics during the hemisphere-forming process. The shape of flat TBMWK fabric that can yield the corresponding hemisphere during the forming process as well as local deformations can be calculated through this model.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Formability of multiaxial warp-knitted fabrics","doi":"10.1533/9781845694982.174","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1533/9781845694982.174","venue":""}

This chapter reflects on key features of reform in mathematics education by examining the effectiveness of a major system-wide attempt to change curriculum and teaching in English elementary schools, the National Numeracy Strategy. This is then contrasted with a more local intervention, Primary CAME. Process and outcomes in these different cases are considered, and some lessons suggested which can be drawn from them. In particular the notions of superficial change and deep change are used to analyse development in teachers’ behaviours and beliefs.","inCitations":["d115705eec10a647a21a7c69cac8cc4d2e58af74"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Curriculum, Teachers and Teaching: Experiences from Systemic and Local Curriculum Change in England","doi":"10.1007/978-94-007-7560-2_18","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-94-007-7560-2_18","venue":""}

Results Cardiomyoctes in rabbit RVOT showed marked dispersion in action potential(AP) repolarization and action potential duration(APD). The amplitude of transient outward current was markedly different in RVOT cardiomyoctes. In RVOT, some myocytes had less nonselective cation current (NSCC) or even had none and concomitantly their APD was very long and early afterdepolarization (EAD) could be observed . When we used some reagents to activate NSCC, plateau phase of APD decreased and EAD was diminished in some RVOT myocytes. Conclusion Cardiomyoctes in rabbit RVOT show marked dispersion in AP repolarization and APD. Marked dispersion in APD can induce reentry. NSCC is smaller or even lacking in some RVOT myocytes. Under this conditions, EAD might be responsible for the occurrence of right ventricular outflow tract tachycardia.","inCitations":["8a6ab57057e3523b174bcb5bfc8fa2bc435eb605","980fe4a9aa3d0b6e64423fc1725aaf3d2b3627ed"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"The electrophysiological basis of right ventricular outflow tract arrhythmogenesis","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

The aim to identify the main risk genes for depression in addition to the gene-environment interactions pointed to the importance of intermediate phenotypes, like rumination, to improve our understanding of the biological mechanisms of depression. Catechol-O-Methyltransferase (COMT) gene is extensively investigated in depression with contradictory results but its association with rumination, as an intermediate phenotype in depression, has not been investigated yet.\n\n\nMETHODS\nIn our study, four tagging SNPs in the COMT gene (rs933271, rs740603, rs4680, rs4646316) were genotyped in a nonclinical Hungarian sample (n=939). We investigated the association between the COMT gene and rumination scores measured by the Ruminative Response Scale using haplotype trend regression.\n\n\nRESULTS\nWe found a significant association between COMT haplotypes and rumination scores (p=0.013) but no significant association was apparent between the functional Val158Met polymorphism (rs4680) and rumination in any genetic model.\n\n\nDISCUSSION\nVariations in the COMT gene exert complex effects on susceptibility to depression involving intermediate phenotypes, such as rumination and also impulsivity, as we previously demonstrated. Both rumination and impulsivity represent maladaptive cognitive styles that can lead to depressive state by influencing the response to negative life events and life stressors. In conclusion, our findings provide evidence that in addition to other genes, COMT also has a significant role in the development of depression, and demonstrate that analysing the complex phenotype associations of genes by haplotype tagging is a powerful method.","inCitations":["644191ea1f216984223e53e62e84df788d0aebb9","06fee6a5ba89899fee51497349a651c067ca5547","42012f939950cc02fe39f8aa57cab701a3c60ea9"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.mppt.hu/images/magazin/pdf/xiv-evfolyam-4-szam/pap_web.pdf"],"title":"Association between the COMT gene and rumination in a Hungarian sample.","doi":"","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"Neuropsychopharmacologia Hungarica : a Magyar Pszichofarmakologiai Egyesulet lapja = official journal of the Hungarian Association of Psychopharmacology"}

The crack has a finite width and the material is subject to a constant tensile stress. The procedure consists of first approximating the cracked layer as a beam on a rigid half‐space. This provides a significant surface deflection. The deflection of the half‐space due to the interface stresses is then added. Comparison with the exact solution for a crack of infinitesimal width and with experiments on finite width slots indicates that the approximate procedure is valuable for analyzing this and more complex configurations.","inCitations":["ca607b996888cd5b3507038c482667fd89ba1b72","2b20ce43992f59e33e9523d63dca72eee36a61d6"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Surface deflection due to the presence of a crack in a half‐space","doi":"10.1063/1.94950","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1063/1.94950","venue":""}

The SC and FC of the bacterium increased the fresh shoot weight, while the blank, the SC and the FC of the bacterium increased the dried weight of the shoot.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://www.nzpps.org/journal/67/nzpp_672130.pdf"],"title":"Spraying hydroponic lettuce roots with a suspension concentrate formulation of Bacillus velezensis to suppress root rot disease and promote plant growth","doi":"10.30843/nzpp.2014.67.5734","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.30843/nzpp.2014.67.5734","venue":""}

However, the role of SATB2 in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) remains unclear. In this study, the SATB2 expression was examined at mRNA and protein levels by quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), Western blotting, and immunohistochemistry in ESCC tissues and adjacent non-cancerous tissues. Statistical analyses were applied to test the associations between SATB2 expression, clinicopathologic factors, and prognosis. Western blotting and qRT-PCR showed that the expression levels of SATB2 mRNA and protein were both significantly lower in SATB2 tissues than those in non-cancerous tissues. Immunohistochemistry analysis showed that SATB2 expression was significantly correlated with clinical stage and Histological differentiation. The results of Kaplan-Meier analysis indicated that a low expression level of SATB2 resulted in a significantly poor prognosis of ESCC patients. Importantly, multivariate analysis showed that low SATB2 expression was an independent prognostic factor for ESCC patients. In sum, our data suggest that SATB2 plays an important role in ESCC progression, and that decreased expression of SATB2 in tumor tissues could be used as a potential prognostic marker for patients with ESCC.","inCitations":["73f740192cb3fa66a1561b37ebbe4ced91b1b082","881577d4115ccb355ad31cc68a9c05c89a83861a","0d8b64058aa861c0d0a960ab4cde5983f018d90d","d0a317bfd597295ab942b3e8e4fe2e15cb5c41d8","a1f1200071b790472a1a2a0ec8affc4ab2d72514","9cf36dfdc8df49e1a203ac3b59ed4f45f036363b","d4cb5dbd25b0f211390ee6e9dd07e3d13c17508f","19e0cbba742d100b8c729d6aec996048549261e3","4d92cc981663c5a9637dd10fdcb8610ff67d0bf4"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Prognostic value of SATB2 expression in patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.","doi":"","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"International journal of clinical and experimental pathology"}

However, the initial attachment process mediated by N-acyl-homoserine lactones (AHLs) is difficult to be fully understood due to the lack of non-invasive and on-line investigation techniques. In this study, the AHL-regulated wastewater biofilm attachment was quantified using ultrasonic time-domain reflectometry (UTDR) as an in-situ and non-invasive monitoring technique. Results demonstrated that the reversible adhesion time in municipal and industrial wastewaters was significantly decreased in the presence of exogenous AHLs. Biofilm thickness in municipal and industrial wastewaters increased significantly with the addition of exogenous AHLs. Also, the addition of acylase delayed the initial biofilm formation (lengthened reversible adhesion time and decreased biofilm thickness and density). Compared with biofilm behavior in the presence of low concentrations of AHLs (4.92 ± 0.17 μg/L), both reversible adhesion time and biofilm thickness were not significantly increased (p > 0.05) with an increase in AHL concentration (9.75 ± 0.41 μg/L). Furthermore, the addition of exogenous AHLs resulted in significant changes in the attached bacterial community structures, in which both QS and quorum-quenching (QQ) bacteria were stimulated. The current work presents an effective approach to in-situ monitoring of the regulation of AHL-mediated QS in the initial attachment of biofilms, especially in the reversible adhesion process, which may provide a potential strategy to facilitate biofilm establishment in wastewater treatment processes.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"In-situ monitoring AHL-mediated quorum-sensing regulation of the initial phase of wastewater biofilm formation.","doi":"10.1016/j.envint.2019.105326","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2019.105326","venue":"Environment international"}

С учетом специфики российского общества и его проблем, большинство серьезных ученых и организаторов образования сейчас понимают ущербность курса на вхождение в \"болонский\" процесс. Плоха не система российского образования, а условия, в которых она и многострадальная Россия оказались в конце XX столетия. Ключевые слова: системный кризис, социокультурная ситуация, проблемы высшего образования Объективно наше общество в ближайшие годы ждут глубокие перемены во всех сферах социальной жизни. Длящийся около двух десятилетий всеобъемлющий системный кризис привел к последствиям, преодолеть которые возможно только в рамках радикального мобилизационного проекта, системными мерами и в плановом порядке. Не случайно в ноябре 2006 года заместитель главы президентской администрации В. Сурков выступил с программной статьей \"Национализация будущего\" и идеей построения в России \"суверенной демократии\". Это подводит черту над вопросом о судьбе либерализма в экономике. Либеральная экономическая политика в постсоветское время привела к деградации всех отраслей народного хозяйства. В 2008 году выработка электроэнергии сравняется с потреблением, и государство обязалось вложить в РАО ЕС 78 млрд. долларов. Износ вагонного парка страны - 78 %.

Abstract Steady increases in CPU core speeds continue to extend the range of applications for computer-based solutions, resulting in the creation of ever more responsive systems. At these higher core speeds, on-chip cache architectures are used to prevent the CPU from stalling when accessing relatively slow off-chip memory. In normal operation, most fetch-execute cycles occur internally, guaranteeing the execution of the maximum instructions per second. However, this also serves to hide the state of executing code from the user. Given the fact that it is not possible to directly monitor the execution of code within such a CPU when it is running at full speed, is it possible to guarantee and control the performance of Real-Time software on these cache-based CPU architectures? This paper investigates this issue by first offering a definition of Real-Time software, together with a discussion on what must be done to prove that the system will meet its performance objectives in all circumstances. In addition, the range of software performance monitoring techniques that are currently available will be discussed, together with a summary of the pros and cons of each measurement technique. The conclusion of this paper is that it is close to impossible to make deterministic software performance measurements using traditional techniques on a CPU that heavily utilizes on-chip cache, so it is therefore almost impossible to guarantee the performance of Real-Time software based on these styles of microprocessor architectures unless new measurement techniques are utilized. Real-Time software is distinguished from any other application by the fact that performance criteria are included in the specifications. This means that for Real-Time software to be verified as being correct, it has to be proven that the software will always meet its performance objectives. With cache based microprocessor architectures, software performance measurements are extremely difficult to do without causing serious perturbations, affecting measurement accuracy. This holds true across all possible measurement techniques. Accurate, hardware only performance measurements are generally not possible on architectures utilizing on-chip cache. Software performance measurement techniques range from hardware assisted solutions, to software only ones. All techniques, however, rely on being able to get information about the current state of the executing code off-chip. Pure hardware or hardware assisted solutions such as Logic Analyzers (LAs), In Circuit Emulators (ICEs), or dedicated pure software performance monitoring devices cannot determine what code is executing in the cache-based CPU core by monitoring external microprocessor signals.

Conclusions: Combined immunomodulatory therapy with ulinastatin plus thymosin α1 appears to yield improved survival for patients with sepsis; this finding should be verified in larger clinical trials.","inCitations":["acb3100aa89784573d3326be5101e4725ce37f32","01f75602d729711786cee9699474e7bb8b37bda6","d54a6dc36083761c8a82401c2165da0e5f4fb2bf","3bbde3bcc63d31fccf808e4fcc5614bd5c164ee1","1b9aec55729764179ef2c25d5a20f05c49d04c98","5cd99ffb7f086ad653bb5092472feaff33f57b80","2e541a4ad31efeef88226fd5c0b7591949de3236","d1803a96d103e0fc0adc969c88b6ed3654b0b681","afe145ad02b48da9ccb3db26bf4032ee20e353e5","1513ccad434a69adb1eb1cebe789749f0cec7106","24c44b63995dc1c1e10d15c13e931216532bd421","73819fc35debff3d6d4a4aee4349b5745188565e","d1f4dfe74229c24797ba0fa15e81ff32b48e0144","2292e204c0fbe3bbecb7b52b4b78ab27649a234c","c15b2e8659a06520e433ba1afaab75864f04d79c","3ac3a4674c44bb6423dd427a87f123584ac4e312","69b98c04c5dfb8b431ba8fb7d6a535510781ce78","f05f8139915b03a28bdabedd749ae68827304afe","507ff4817579e597b36af2aa742e8cc64b82e212","6ad6a3b9ac9578edfe85bd50858971ae1bc59424","76470392a9d3e592eb7f322a302ad9616ea631a3","b3378a2eb9fcef933c05af2505b633d03f06c0d0","71478acecf2803bc3c36c4ee88b02aa5faff9263","a06eb3174fa292fe37d06be29a6aaa0515b030ef","0100d32d4c12d7446959c6a57e46fc650011e5fe","c3e827a6f4c8de40f4d29aa833acce99a0a060c5","ca613e4dad2ca837aea0ca3cdb4ed2f0b393b742"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"A New Immunomodulatory Therapy for Severe Sepsis: Ulinastatin Plus Thymosin α 1","doi":"10.1177/0885066608326970","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1177/0885066608326970","venue":"Journal of intensive care medicine"}

However, over the last decade, minimally invasive procedures have been developed to avoid high risks associated with conventional open-chest valve replacement techniques. Such a recent and innovative procedure represents an optimal field for conducting investigations through virtual computer-based simulations: in fact, nowadays, computational engineering is widely used to unravel many problems in the biomedical field of cardiovascular mechanics and specifically, minimally invasive procedures. In this study, we investigate a balloon-expandable valve and we propose a novel simulation strategy to reproduce its implantation using computational tools. Focusing on the Edwards SAPIEN valve in particular, we simulate both stent crimping and deployment through balloon inflation. The developed procedure enabled us to obtain the entire prosthetic device virtually implanted in a patient-specific aortic root created by processing medical images; hence, it allows evaluation of postoperative prosthesis performance depending on different factors (e.g. device size and prosthesis placement site). Notably, prosthesis positioning in two different cases (distal and proximal) has been examined in terms of coaptation area, average stress on valve leaflets as well as impact on the aortic root wall. The coaptation area is significantly affected by the positioning strategy ( − 24%, moving from the proximal to distal) as well as the stress distribution on both the leaflets (+13.5%, from proximal to distal) and the aortic wall ( − 22%, from proximal to distal). No remarkable variations of the stress state on the stent struts have been obtained in the two investigated cases.","inCitations":["8ef114ecfc50c86814b4929933e27c3357206efc","b16ce8d2a2d1966f0c7b60add287cf895b9d62d0","71ca2753a719d272e7ef886ce108901c080449c4","f3ffc0e6642d5e95d30cbac243649f8fa4b28c0c","03c7975bed8ba4e485d505a0fb9d5baaffdd56a8","459a20d845550dfab7068ece63b8c399c1b7d9d1","89207f798e160a501c3e9acc8a8e7540008e0120","e2f897eb37938264bc0fccd8d0934bdbb685fdc5","ec74a609ecf6fbd4e371049d74fca705f5dc6259","b0de44995340a41438e59d08a430a4bd1bb9b8c4","da0a7405b93755d8f5717b4b3aba3d4d4a97575d","5dab6b884456bfce84874d540af93b2f2435153e","c8748f1da9f6bbe4d9effce5ff92c4421393b9d4","1b86243fc083c6588e5ec14b8b76fb802842f6db","1cdcf7844cfd0958d812f3667b170f26dd5632ef","f2c39beb15bf13b2c7001d9aee82ef7f0087c930","6e8d54433d5c73a0ea68c7f735397cddb546408d","e7a73fb135501e5de82a4a254ba95faedefa81b2","e52b7cf8b7cfa49c25c4609edb0a155af0461515","0c4a079ce5ac2dfed60f69554ea56a91609a76ab","bff0784f293cba3413a8db99902e0c9a000ac0a9","7efe2649e87f2525f9d6c2ac3ec94e8604099438","05dff614c22161c2aabb2554d4b3bb1da7b1f7c4","9fa8a6029bb4b23554ffe96d876ddfb4000189ae","954b6ca7a7faf72c7afaab5e0b3ea641b7d970c0","666b80cd4a390dd6193b9e97cbdfaade51f8d039","91e790c69d7f11a2fa7cf70fdd4579f92040a27d","ce7acfcc0a3c5c5b7857ed996b6453d12b7a17c3","4234d5c252e6c715718b67bf37069155ef9cbaad","412ee80c7db84c2aa393210ed9b1f29310072844","d6bc307e031e80b9b6099645d4524e4cbaac5678","5e7a06b531afb716063fbda4ef6cd5042dded127","80a0bf3ac3064ba6d8186f7447b42aaa7bf3bfcf","ab62022bbf62feb64e13ddc91ae6e663cc20d479","a437f0b8ee9ddd77f11e5b2f8b6578e28a91e693","43984b3dcc2d1b49a1532859983cac6f354a16c0","5af2df653beea7cd467e0a6c23f444b5496620aa","118050cfd2541671af621b79f5c1ada515bbd3e7"],"pdfUrls":["http://www-2.unipv.it/compmech/publications/2013_4.pdf"],"title":"Simulation of transcatheter aortic valve implantation: a patient-specific finite element approach","doi":"10.1080/10255842.2012.746676","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1080/10255842.2012.746676","venue":"Computer methods in biomechanics and biomedical engineering"}

However, no extensive performance evaluation and comparison is available in the literature. In this paper, after a short review of the major dynamic QoS routing schemes, we analyze and compare their performance referring to several networks scenarios. In order to set an absolute evaluation of the performance quality we have obtained the ideal performance of any routing scheme using a novel and flexible mathematical programming model that assumes the knowledge of arrival times and duration of the connections offered to the network. This model is based on an extension of the maximum multi-commodity flow problem. Being an integer linear programming model, its complexity is quite high and its evaluation is constrained to networks of limited size. To overcome the computational complexity we have defined an approximate model, based on the multi-class Erlang formula and the minimum multi-commodity cut problem, that provides an upper bound to the routing scheme performance. The performance presented in the paper has been obtained by simulation. From the comparison of the schemes considered it turns out that the Virtual Flow Deviation routing algorithm performs best and it almost reaches, in several scenarios, the ideal performance showing that no much gain is left for alternate new schemes.","inCitations":["37a99aa70dbcac4311cd03d37cc93a727a3c96e5"],"pdfUrls":["https://www.lri.fr/~fmartignon/papers/QoS_IP_2005_VFD.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-540-30573-6_36","http://www.lri.fr/~fmartignon/papers/QoS_IP_2005_VFD.pdf"],"title":"On the Performance of Dynamic Online QoS Routing Schemes","doi":"10.1007/978-3-540-30573-6_36","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-540-30573-6_36","venue":"QoS-IP"}

By day 42 of the experiment, which was 2 weeks after the third dose, all subjects had developed NA titers of 0.5 IU/ml or higher. The geometric mean titers of ELISA antibody and NA were 3.8 EU/ml and 5.7 IU/ml, respectively. Overall, the vaccine was well tolerated by all subjects. These results suggest that PCEC-K used for pre-exposure immunization according to the WHO schedule is as immunogenic and effective as the current pre-exposure immunization regimen in Japan, which consists of vaccines administered on days 0, 28, and 180.

The rise of pH upon immersion in SBF solution was slower for the novel glass in comparison to 45S5 Bioglass ® . Nevertheless, both glasses exhibited similar behaviour in early formation of crystalline apatite demonstrating their osteoinductive features. The in vivo investigations in rabbits demonstrated good compatibility between the glass and surrounding tissue along the whole implantation period with negligible adverse reactions.

In the present study, we detected cell viability with methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT) assay and cell membrane permeability with propidium iodide (PI) fluorescence dyeing, and calculated cell membrane fluidity change as fluorescence anisotropy. Fatty acid content in cells was measured by gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy (GC/MS), and the relationship between fatty acid composition and cell viability was studied. We observed that n-6 PUFA linoleic acid (LA) inhibited tumor cell growth at high concentrations (≥300 μmol/L), while low concentrations (100–200 μmol/L) seemed to promote cell proliferation. Analyses of cell membrane permeability, cell membrane fluidity, and cell fatty acid composition suggested that the anti-cancer action of LA could be related to changes in the ratio of n-6 to n-3 PUFAs. We observed that pre-incubation of cancer cells with 100 μmol/L LA for 24 h enhanced cell sensitivity to the cytotoxic action of LA, whereas undifferentiated cell line LoVo seemed to have a distinct path in LA-induced death. These results showed that one of the mechanisms by which supplementation of LA induces cancer cell death could be altering the ratio of n-6/n-3 PUFAs, and this may be related to cell differentiation status.","inCitations":["f9247f0c5dfc556438d6ad1e66387117da10dcec","9e23316a335de6045536aced4547864b5eda5825","a22e5efece44bd82ce2902303762a5f01cdaeacf","4754ca7cde62e0100de5946d1d9eca3f5a0e124c","2cc1b5cea7d79bd3c862c77b5820ffaa839bac29","b45f274833dc5ba4a1a8751b2b1eabccd0beb532","f9869fb762396dc58f0685c4292be3ff6802f895","b36e6aabbafae7482bafb5d3b83d5fffb7fd1f22","59090b6bb2ddfd673ea638c1db259d4decf43529","bbf334638d9242853b778b60b91c5c1fb6c58827","74529da89ed00326413e30272912af3108de8ae6","f60ac868fc03315600f8eacb282942dcb393877e","cba9cd44475253f31f0baa90726b0be70eb45558","2cdc2702471c7c8ff802de6cc05f2d35ca4dbf32","687a641f0e49f1b762abeba2a82490b57e9fc263","72a459acb146da1b3813e9d22a5b81ecb0ecffa1","6e9707b832341100188acb34dedafbf1b25f76ff","2c0aa61ca26e33ee33a0bcbc95543f9959321640"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Colorectal cancer cell growth inhibition by linoleic acid is related to fatty acid composition changes","doi":"10.1631/jzus.B1000125","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1631/jzus.B1000125","venue":"Journal of Zhejiang University SCIENCE B"}

Ageing in women was associated with B40 and DR5 in a recent study, but other studies yielded conflicting results. In none of the studies, however, did the young and elderly samples originate from the same homogeneous population. Homogeneity is dependent on geographic origin. The aim of this study was to investigate whether differences in geographic origin between age groups could explain the age-associated differences in the frequencies of B40 and DR5. The authors used the new design of a 'birth-place-restricted comparison' in which the origin of all subjects was ascertained. The total study population comprised 1010 young women aged 25-40 years and 660 elderly women aged 85 years and older. The 'birth-place-restricted comparison' included 66 young and 285 elderly women from one geographic area (Leiden, the Netherlands). Men were not included because ageing in men was not associated with HLA antigens in a recent study. In the total population, the frequency of B40 in young women of different origin varied between 16 and 28%, and the frequency of DR5 between 11 and 23%. Similar differences were observed in the elderly women. In the 'birth-place-restricted comparison', the frequency of B40 was 15% in the young women and 11% in the elderly women (difference 4%, 95% confidence interval, -5 to 13%). The frequency of DR5 was 20% in the young women, and 28% in the elderly women (difference 8%, 95% confidence interval, -4 to 19%). Thus, marked differences in HLA antigen frequency were found between populations of various geographic origins. Definition and ascertainment of the target population are therefore necessary in genetic studies of ageing. In such a 'birth-place-restricted comparison', the authors confirmed that ageing in women was negatively associated with HLA-B40 and positively associated with HLA-DR5.","inCitations":["0dbc9708eb8e5f16e93469b812f23862ea8027d1","57b8834507444014ed6515626a9e7e864ab304c2","af6762141a8e0e57c2ff53c6e5b4395372568103","eea0a0bb9b9c088e0ef7de66e9bb426be6ce7af6","e9c1529b9c128a20e82d39a8531da293053c04d4","faa1e87aaa74440dd511459b7eabfd3e66e63788"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"The effect of geographic origin on the frequency of HLA antigens and their association with ageing.","doi":"10.1046/j.1365-2370.2000.00206.x","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2370.2000.00206.x","venue":"European journal of immunogenetics : official journal of the British Society for Histocompatibility and Immunogenetics"}
