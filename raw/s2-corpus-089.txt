Accordingly, the following research focused on the development of a novel gadolinium-doped electrolyte material i.e. BaCe0.59Zr0.2Y0.15Gd0.06O2.97-δ (BCZYG59) for PCFCs using solid-state and wet-chemical synthesis approach. X-ray Diffraction Analysis (XRD) and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) were carried out for analyzing microstructural morphology, grain-growth and characteristics, densification trends and other phase/structural transformations, whereas, electrical properties were investigated via DC conductivity testing to examine BCZYG59's feasibility as electrolyte. Homogenous cubic perovskite phase for ensuring proton conduction was achieved at 1300 °C and 1500 °C for BCZYG59 synthesized from wet-chemical and solid–state methods, respectively. These materials showed corresponding conductivity values of 3.20 × 10−4 S cm−1 and 4.70 × 10−4 S cm−1 at 650 °C in air with the promising prospects of exhibiting greater proton conductivity making it a fairly convincing choice among present-day electrolyte materials.","inCitations":["ba279324662840bc66d96ed254a017ad3a7fda50"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Influence of temperature and synthesis dependent changes upon structure, morphology and electrical properties of BaCeO3-based proton conducting electrolyte","doi":"10.1016/j.matchemphys.2018.04.020","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.matchemphys.2018.04.020","venue":""}

The initial trisomics often were not morphologically distinguishable from diploid sibs. Distinctive characteristics – such as slow growth; small, compact habit; lack of interstitial leaflets; and a bilobed stigma — were apparent in the backcross progenies. Most of the trisomics were fertile enough to be used in further genetic studies. Transmission of the extra chromosome through the female for three trisomics was 20–24%. Only primary trisomics were expected but meiotic study of seven clones indicated that all were secondary trisomics.

Karaba","ids":["116386757"]}],"journalName":"Boston University Law Review","paperAbstract":"Multidistrict litigation (“MDL”) has, in recent years, become so central a device in complex litigation as to be almost routine. As authorized by federal statute, the Multidistrict Litigation Panel of federal judges regularly transfers cases which may share no more than one common issue from federal districts all over the nation into a single transferee district. The transferee court is then in charge of all pre-trial procedure for all of the cases on a collective basis. This includes conduct of discovery as well as pre-trial motions, including summary judgment. While the transferee district is not permitted to adjudicate the merits of the individual suits at trial (other than in the form of several test cases, binding only on the specific litigants involved), as a practical matter cases return to their transferor districts very rarely. Instead, there is constant pressure to form a global settlement. While individual claimants may opt out of that settlement, the settlement usually effectively ends the process. The claimants’ pre-trial cases are controlled by an appointed steering committee of selected attorneys.Although much has been written on the subject of multidistrict litigation, none of that scholarship to this point has directly challenged the constitutionality of the process. This Article, in contrast to all prior scholarship, conducts a frontal assault on the constitutionality of MDL as a stark violation of the individual claimant’s due process right to her day in court. In so doing, the Article explores the underlying political and constitutional theory of a litigant’s right to her day in court, and explains how current MDL practice unambiguously undermines that right. MDL amounts to a strange cross between The Wild West and political smoke-filled rooms of the twentieth century — hardly a combination that augurs well for either due process or the rule of law. The Article considers and rejects the supposed utilitarian values of efficiency attained by use of MDL as an asserted justification for the serious interference with the individual’s control of her own case. In making its case against the constitutionality of MDL, the Article contrasts the methods by which class action procedure — itself subject to several challenges over the years on due process grounds — seeks to protect the due process rights of absent class members. The Article concludes that whatever due process problems impact class actions pale in comparison to the dangers deriving from the crude form of procedural collectivization imposed by MDL. The Article ends with an exploration of ways in which MDL’s constitutionality might be salvaged through important modifications in its processes.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://www.lfcj.com/uploads/3/8/0/5/38050985/ssrn-id2499623_martin_reddish_mdls.pdf","http://www.bu.edu/bulawreview/files/2015/02/REDISH.pdf"],"title":"One Size Doesn't Fit All: Multidistrict Litigation, Due Process, and the Dangers of Procedural Collectivism","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Calvatia nipponica (Agaricaceae) is one of the most rare species in the Calvatia genus. It was first validated in 2008. Due to its scarcity, C. nipponica has never been chemically investigated. Its recent discovery in Korea allowed to conduct this study, and using bioactivity-guided fractionation for antiangiogenic activity, chemical investigation of the MeOH extract of the fruiting bodies of C. nipponica led to the isolation of five alkaloids (1-5) and two phenolic compounds (6-7). This is the first study to report the chemical investigation of C. nipponica, and compound 1 was previously reported as chemically synthesized only until our report of its isolation and identification from natural sources. The structure of 1 was determined by spectroscopic analysis by 1D and 2D NMR spectra and HR-MS. All compounds (1-7) were tested for inhibition of angiogenesis using human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Compounds 2, 4 and 5 significantly inhibited the promotion of angiogenesis in HUVECs. Compound 5 showed the most potent inhibition via downregulation of VEGF, p38 and ERK signaling pathways. These results suggested that the rare mushroom C. nipponica might be beneficial in antiangiogenesis therapy for cancer treatment.","inCitations":["7aa32b3cfa0f42fc8abff604dfbad2c11d307a20","9a7d78924db11c9c81323b9514ac169162225ba2","025a2c8743259a83fdb78bfd7fa8308b0f1c76b5","a28e44c7d2a2430972a06fe4774efa49dbbfc95b"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Chemical constituents from the rare mushroom Calvatia nipponica inhibit the promotion of angiogenesis in HUVECs.","doi":"10.1016/j.bmcl.2017.07.036","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bmcl.2017.07.036","venue":"Bioorganic & medicinal chemistry letters"}

However, as AFP becomes mainstream, the manufacturing of tooling used in AFP requires additional attention for large and complex-geometry composite structures. Based on this requirement, fused deposition modeling (FDM) has been identified as the most suitable technology of choice for rapid production of high-temperature, low volume, composite lay-up and repair tools, also for moderate temperature production tooling. In this current research, 3D printing and AFP technology are combined to manufacture the composite parts with high complexity. Also, the curing process of prepreg material, which is most important for manufacturing process, has been monitored. The cure behavior was first characterized using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) using isothermal condition. Then, the 3D printed substrates were fabricated and AFP prepreg lay-up experiments were conducted. Prepreg lay-up can undergo deformation and slip between each layer over a 3D printed substrate. As a result, the final product quality gets affected, with defects such as delamination, overlaps and gaps. Therefore, experimental investigations were done with an in-house robot-based AFP system by varying process parameters like bed temperature, compaction force and lay-up speed.

Accumulating evidence suggests that cellular redox status plays an important role in regulating viral replication and infectivity. In this study, experiments were performed to determine whether the thiol antioxidant glutathione (GSH) blocked influenza viral infection in cultures of Madin-Darby canine kidney cells or human small airway epithelial cells. Protection against production of active virus particles was observed at a low (0.05-0.1) multiplicity of infection (MOI). GSH inhibited expression of viral matrix protein and inhibited virally induced caspase activation and Fas upregulation. In BALB/c mice, inclusion of GSH in the drinking water decreased viral titer in both lung and trachea homogenates 4 d after intranasal inoculation with a mouse-adapted influenza strain A/X-31. Together, the data suggest that the thiol antioxidant GSH has an anti-influenza activity in vitro and in vivo. Oxidative stress or other conditions that deplete GSH in the epithelium of the oral, nasal, and upper airway may, therefore, enhance susceptibility to influenza infection.","inCitations":["cdfbc504a1ed47bac43cbf221a12a3f9cc1a4c81","a1f9f91e4ddad1973869436820b17671d7fe613f","b9f8e9004653271406e7f086be526fa8c1897e3e","c1ea94caf6a3fed3504440635290b2084fc2b594","6d48c66aa93260a98b3d6b0360b8f5560c0ae1ea","0f6b1645fdc27b32ae9fdb4f99dbbb30eb1dfd7f","953b57783d1a7dd9bfd953d50cd59eb22de69b5b","832dcd0b9cd413797aac0f4f87fcb26c3969b9e8","5a46663b138b5c6854f65fa045515a0bade477ff","e3c1c75f9c17a2bdd8986d272a218ee655d8d3b1","85875f4f22f871677845b7ee7231ba614f379671","0a55cc8c60653b740a849b2ef29ea7f397e8f62d","ca9007941386955d6f2e4a9ea66eb650fbcd0d28","71333b3e69ecb17e5d71ca1be32bb7499f7dae9a","90fbae85aa2141396730a80abcd8b85356360cb2","0190208df252668c295002bfd808e7a85677bce6","4893e78fd8a397f904ce910b57bf35ff6a097e11","7acf92473235757698ec82fa41b65492f25e3062","f587a7ea25cd907c7f16e5ad4cff80180ff94c5a","2d5a036da3eec69cf318ee695e8bd53347a61a1e","4bb2d5e55a2216facaeae329876a20c7db6b99a3","8d75beb81408131bcb7dd7c70f7d8c6b51c00292","e68625cec7b0d4c36d1a729dfb67a87a25230378","df63c94a77afa7c0d669d34af5d9b6ea77a61783","860664f713a1198acb359a07e8d01197d35031e1","529b3db638992811da47f57e528dc34694016e2a","5fc9523915b057c03afa54f111fe9fd1995dd1ad","c2d4bbac8cc2e1d681ffd74964246f6ab6dfa8d3","37432dba03547b3c8a172e6d129d868ed07fc082","117156e9b4a525bea58ce88b44c8026f43181c8a","ea86952c7c169c06a56ceeb6d25f98349630784e","87595034cd4ba4628df6be97c646cd3ad90cee0c","67abb685817889249e776826aa17b1615d6e54c5","1e60ea11dea6a7b5ab86efa86418f0816863624a","cfb6a8f4447b2dc4bcaabf97be42f8fa055f3932","a863666b3f879e4a399979834c02cea6ea0404c2","448769105ccb48960762cce007d096a9241f5081","eddda9ab5e3dbfb5597bcfc7ecf2b4008c741205","410d1517c8b1ba51e767acd70583b73b9438e491","17848c7e9a637262c54f723dc12456034594f6b2","d0b2b01615235f2cb450f4f3f36eb59fcf1328f0","a090ece564ef7a717da9521c97603f70ec483329","33e9de016070778ef452513acd2a28d22dae35c6","8b0955c8d552c4be97af669cef936dc162f191f6","a8f85e79f22758923eac0075bc7405c9f15ee33e","3a9bf714f9df17c5b2f458a0260dd1f1fc305b43","87fe284c39f9fff7e98e8669e48426445fbca54e","5427e725e7c330448ca3b15efdc4c73a714a4d25","08d05ba409b0edc38fa6a5646010771cb395675d","b61a82e94ed3ab6150de9babbdc2c99442c4d3cf","b4bbac0bf7579faa2d06ff70c243bba2a451b85a","974cd21e8e7309b284162c28af43a40497184a69","f2b8c240fbdcb8298499f9a123320412211e4818","e8ae0b9a82c073cfa59d10c2e871f27b5b406157","5d1434d0868010f9b3d13b41931bcd458de8ae8e","6a3b13f8e166e4e421aa7faac7dfc3148e992253","d3dfdc18e5e5e0799130e86486acbd9705dfe128","79200cf76fc9dd477af20f0e94a9b0353b7733a7","5d1891531c5d315b81e3504a934b64bb6393e24f","8138c86296a173b50017885f4f20b7fc11a25247","c2df9dfdf67c26c16bea8d8ecd43bbf30da64f18","8be18d936b3917c4bbef6eeb5bbd08a064d12aef","7ac54db3298b52d9d78f4255e40447904bd90ad7","f92659c88190bab439b3abf19603682c0438e99b","bd718323b8a353a79ae4763a4624b5010c9204ad","5934e8c444fa8d36fd779d4a0b232798169fa027","30c3fdd16c98c988466645a00e34259d16bd3457","dd849314daddbe8161b9b660de3cc9cf3277c85a","4fed3d75a7d4965d39d6b27c6701cd15b761c8aa","9339796e75bb576c0f3bc65cfdbcfece6f587b24","b1bbacf41aa36ee133e7882d9814ddbdee8ad1b7","d6aec36e3f54585094e1cb358796a8465b294517","6a9510b98f1656b82f6fe40603c0b81f5c2d7dc8","c58dda95cf7b9770078388c68e55718676aa76de","d2ddbac7877903c90be03d65686ed011805e02cc","db8cb677dc51cab859514ea059566327a96a7e4c","2932c5442905e93643aaaf2929513837046248e8","bec309f4fc82c7734180902355fdecdff3c53b41","0cab00ecb65e87992d4bb443fdaa23e7acb4dbed","a67dbcb783bfff5df8598d7812631ee45e490e50","728463479a9395d417e239ad5b867f7cfd7600c4","4fb1a605a7c8852c7a383a9eb1bc6a5d430229b1","fb2b6ad5ffd26d47b18fdf9324779b69da49dbcc","87dfe6260a2877c83facb2c19fe81eb19807e553","f5a92facf9654ef3a34e6822c5e7da612e3549c4","6d5c64a3dfab3e61bd5cd310b0082b540a9dd289","b83cf3fa727e2b53f7984482a79fd6d38a4f8081","fe2a46befe65d5a935a77af8e28a14817d56ffe7","e5b69cb1259880b29ba89e560622d5c1a126d993","4e4da81ee301909a64dcc816260af0a438f14190","2e8c541bab2384a1e848386548ed1fef4ed0aa22","86e342bb203528c4fcdb2509284aa55be7667628","8ce8f62c69841b1d1db1df313b89849348370cc1","be77f960307531696a8378ff2f0750d84cde9e5d","43954b1df991e05b6ccfb4f4a81702ab98c2b2e3","14e5862691c554260b0a1041a17f31f72a711b1c","6b826c67423b25454106459efd5c2de9c060967c","44a57414845352ce1eea1857301c726ca955c079","59243ca8a6eee51680e942464519d7406b631d43","ab7061b3658ce9f131c55aa534abfd052d79466a","f5475895d05208590e92e30b79d6aa96d7d3dcca","5a98ac04251e7cf23d63dfda6e299c041ee20f50","a38d98aebdc121425ac7de4f23ec3af1d2c322c7","78201e1d523ab0c7a8d842437aa0fba0c89a3685","f3b7f4469ac01f1ce916d24172570c43c537627e","af5967863e65ae3ff59c744f86985c8d9cc892b5","dc4818f60418fd6ca925b81fe848db6cacd4f3f5","64a71e7aee2cecccf0f0bd782d1565a00a766a75","8b1d9aa399ed7547fbe8ba7152e12605433e2be7","928d3198b9cd4c0ff787459e79cf59ac7a55718b","20d6794c9278b17ce8fb9baef13703e4cf031b09","f2524821da80969ca87598b80d088f65f5db9541"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Inhibition

In designing or updating a ship's navigation systems, it is possible to choose from a continuum of options from simple stand-alone EC devices to completely integrated \"cockpit-style\", one-person INS stations. The effectiveness of these systems in preventing navigation accidents depends on both system design and training of operators. Little hard data on the effectiveness of specific systems have been published to date.

Polymyxins exhibit their antibacterial killing by initial interaction with lipid A in Gram-negative bacteria. Polymyxin resistance can be mediated by phosphoethanolamine (PEA) modification of lipid A, which abolishes the initial electrostatic interaction with polymyxins. Both chromosome-encoded (e.g. EptA, EptB and EptC) and plasmid-encoded (e.g. MCR-1 and MCR-2) PEA transferases have been reported in Gram-negative bacteria; however, their sequence and functional heterogeneity remain unclear. This article reports a comparative analysis of PEA transferases across 10 clinically relevant Gram-negative bacterial species using multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis. The results show that the pairwise identities among chromosome-mediated EptA, EptB and EptC from Escherichia coli are low, and EptA shows the greatest similarity with MCR-1 and MCR-2. Among PEA transferases from representative strains of 10 clinically relevant species, the catalytic domain is more conserved compared with the transmembrane domain. In particular, PEA acceptor sites and zinc-binding pockets show high conservation between different species, indicating their potential importance for the function of PEA transferases. The evolutionary relationship of MCR-1, MCR-2 and EptA from the 10 selected bacterial species was evaluated by phylogenetic analysis. Cluster analysis illustrates that 325 EptA from 275 strains of 10 species within each individual species are highly conserved, whereas interspecies conservation is low. This comparative analysis provides key bioinformatic information to better understand the mechanism of polymyxin resistance via PEA modification of lipid A.","inCitations":["63f6024f78c948d220f7795a3dd62515af39dc7a"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Comparative analysis of phosphoethanolamine transferases involved in polymyxin resistance across 10 clinically relevant Gram-negative bacteria.","doi":"10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2017.12.016","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2017.12.016","venue":"International journal of antimicrobial agents"}

Q and V(A) were measured in 1.7 ml lung volume pieces using injected and aerosolized fluorescent microspheres, respectively. Hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (HPV) in the atelectatic lung shifted flow to the ventilated lung. The increased flow in the ventilated lung ensured adequate gas exchange, compensating for the hypoxemia due to shunt contributed by the atelectatic lung. Left lung atelectasis caused a compensatory increase in the ventilated lung FRC that was smaller in the right (RLD) than left (LLD) lateral posture, the effect of lung compression by the atelectatic lung and mediastinal contents in the RLD posture. The O2 deficit measured by (A-a)DO2 increased with left lung atelectasis and was exacerbated in the LLD posture by 10 cm H2O PEEP, a result of increased shunt caused by a shift in Q from the ventilated to the atelectatic lung. The PEEP-induced O2 deficit was eliminated with inversion to the RLD posture.","inCitations":["7f1947ac974050c888d12b8a2ddc4d344f72a845","f14e365973e34c90bc9ced741a4c073f37e4ac8c"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.cps.org.tw/issues/file/82b53028d408755d6d3bd9ec0d975873.pdf"],"title":"Redistribution of blood flow and lung volume between lungs in lateral decubitus postures during unilateral atelectasis and PEEP.","doi":"","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"The Chinese journal of physiology"}

Preliminary result shows that the proposed design is able to reach a high worst-case throughput rate at 78.562 Msamples/s, which is 3.928 times better than the CCSDS Rice coding chip. With the low power consumption at 0.0105 W/Msamples/s, we show that the minimumredundancy prefix coding is well suited for future satellite entropy coding standard.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://homepages.cae.wisc.edu/~ece734/project/s09/chenc_rpt.pdf","http://homepages.cae.wisc.edu/~ece734/project/s09/chenc_pro.pdf","http://homepages.cae.wisc.edu/~ece734/project/s09/chenc_pre.pdf"],"title":"An FPGA Implementation of the Fast Minimum- Redundancy Prefix Coding","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

The probability of symbols does not change and CABAC decoding has no effect after encryption. Several different YUV sequences are used for experimental evaluation of the proposed algorithm.

The accumulation of JA, induced by signals from biotic and abiotic stresses, results in the degradation of Jasmonate-ZIM-domain (JAZ) proteins, followed by the de-repression of JAZ-repressed transcription factors (such as MYC2) to activate defence responses and developmental processes. Here, we characterized a JAZ family protein, GhJAZ2, from cotton (Gossypium hirsutum) which was induced by methyl jasmonate (MeJA) and inoculation of Verticillium dahliae. The overexpression of GhJAZ2 in cotton impairs the sensitivity to JA, decreases the expression level of JA-response genes (GhPDF1.2 and GhVSP) and enhances the susceptibility to V. dahliae and insect herbivory. Yeast two-hybrid and bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays showed that GhJAZ2 may be involved in the regulation of cotton disease resistance by interaction with further disease-response proteins, such as pathogenesis-related protein GhPR10, dirigent-like protein GhD2, nucleotide-binding site leucine-rich repeat (NBS-LRR) disease-resistant protein GhR1 and a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor GhbHLH171. Unlike MYC2, overexpression of GhbHLH171 in cotton activates the JA synthesis and signalling pathway, and improves plant tolerance to the fungus V. dahliae. Molecular and genetic evidence shows that GhJAZ2 can interact with GhbHLH171 and inhibit its transcriptional activity and, as a result, can restrain the JA-mediated defence response. This study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms of GhJAZ2 in the regulation of the cotton defence response.","inCitations":["d12afbdf9f7e278e930af6942b3e98b3d9dff791","01d767bae447b39da8b747b14b09950b58ee55b6","8ef5667d9e7267b1c421b8c44e567b72577dfe7b","bd93953cee8d647f01a319fc4830a81d8f72b527","81fda8255aea0c9229de3645b29bad4143d7e4de","a230cc99909fb08beb7b938092315ba6617898f7","6e92d31e4769b5cdcf3081c97eb37de715ccec5b","9923acf41382663ed1374f25afebde75e99b2051"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"GhJAZ2 attenuates cotton resistance to biotic stresses via the inhibition of the transcriptional activity of GhbHLH171.","doi":"10.1111/mpp.12575","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1111/mpp.12575","venue":"Molecular plant pathology"}

Increasingly, subclinical disease activity is becoming an integral part of our definition of disease course in MS. In many patients, the relapsing-remitting phase starts as subclinical activity, likely long before they present with a clinically isolated syndrome. Differentiating progressive MS subgroups is also becoming less relevant. This is illustrated by comparing progressive MS that evolves from an asymptomatic state in individuals with radiologically isolated syndrome (primary progressive MS) and symptomatic individuals with relapsing-remitting MS (secondary progressive MS). In each case, the background disease activity and pathology can be indistinguishable. These phases evolve on a continuum and largely follow the aging process with little influence by the preceding clinical activity level. Recently, it also became evident that one or a few poorly recovered relapses at the beginning of clinical manifestations of MS predict much earlier progressive MS onset.\n\n\nSUMMARY\nThese findings suggest that interventions to prevent progressive MS, when they become available for clinical practice, may need to be considered as early as when the asymptomatic radiologically isolated syndrome is detected. This early treatment approach is being evaluated with ongoing trials with available disease-modifying therapies. In contrast, continuing the use of disease-modifying therapy beyond a certain age may have little benefit. However, being in the progressive phase of MS is not, in itself, an argument against disease-modifying therapy use in active disease in younger patients.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Phases and Phenotypes of Multiple Sclerosis.","doi":"10.1212/CON.0000000000000737","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1212/CON.0000000000000737","venue":"Continuum"}

It is impractical and cost prohibitive for physical therapists (PTs) alone to provide all mobilization activities to hospitalized patients. Patient mobilization requires an interprofessional approach with all staff prioritizing patient activity. This descriptive research captures the productivity and patient effect of a patient mobilization program within an inpatient unit: Does the implementation of a mobility aide (MA) in an acute care hospital increase overall patient mobilizations? Does the use of an MA alleviate the workload of a PT to allow focus on skilled intervention and decreased frequency of visits? Methods: The MA's primary responsibility was to provide mobility interventions for patients under the direction of the PT in collaboration with nursing staff to improve frequency of mobilization and allow PTs to concentrate on skilled interventions. The PT and MA educated registered nurses and family members on mobility techniques for specific situations and promoted patient mobilization by nursing staff. The MA workload log, physical therapy orders, treatment frequency, and category of professional/caretaker who provided the intervention were recorded for 519 patients after the MA program implementation. This was compared to nursing unit-level, baseline mobilization metrics 1 week prior to MA program implementation. Physical therapist use measured as frequency of visits in the plan of care was compared to an equivalent time period prior to program implementation. Results: Since implementation of the MA program in this acute care hospital, there has been an observed 36% increase in patients walking on the unit as well as a 48% decrease in patients with no mobilizations. Trends in PT encounter frequency and increased PT referrals suggest that the PTs are able to focus on skilled intervention rather than general mobilization. The cost of implementing the MA program has been determined to be offset by a 10% increase in new PT referrals. While daily and twice a day visits by the PT decreased, the frequency of 1 to 3 visits per week increased suggesting increased breadth of PT services. Conclusion: Adding an MA to patients' plan of care may be a cost-effective method to optimize patient mobility in the acute care hospital setting. The addition of an MA to a medical/surgical unit produced positive outcomes in number of patient mobilizations and allowed improved use of the PT.","inCitations":["990715686b5155635f46d1f7e57c3ca436ff18e1"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Achieving a Culture of Mobility: Implementation of a Mobility Aide Program to Increase Patient Mobilizations in an Acute Care Hospital","doi":"10.1097/JAT.0000000000000058","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1097/JAT.0000000000000058","venue":""}

To that end, in this article, we introduce a model of Argument Revision, presented in terms of the contraction and revision of a system of structured argumentation. Argument Revision is influenced by theAGM model of belief revision, but with certain key differences. First,Argument Revision involves modifying the underlying model (system of argumentation) from which beliefs are derived, allowing for a finer-grained approach to modifying beliefs. Secondly, the richer structure provided by a system of argumentation permits a determination of minimal change based on quantifiable effects on the system as opposed to qualitative criteria such as entrenchment orderings. Argument Revision does, however, retain a close link to the AGM approach to belief revision. A basic set of postulates for rational revisions and contractions in Argument Revision is proposed; these postulates are influenced by, and capture the spirit of, those found in AGM belief revision. After specifying a determination of minimal change, based on measurable effects on the system, we conclude the article by going on to show how Argument Revision can be used as a strategic tool by a participant in a multi-agent dialogue, assisting with commitment retraction and dishonesty. In systems of argumentation that contain even small knowledge bases, it is difficult for a dialogue participant to fully assess the impact of seemingly trivial changes to that knowledge base, or other parts of the system; we demonstrate, by means of an example, that Argument Revision solves this problem through a determination of minimal change that is justifiable and intuitive.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://www.arg.dundee.ac.uk/people/chris/publications/2017/jlc2017.pdf"],"title":"Argumentation corner Argument Revision","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Although the term of office may be divided into three broad phases, with a shift towards more liberalising, business-friendly policies over time, it is argued that the period as a whole shows a high degree of continuity, with liberalising measures already evident from 2012. The policy output may be characterised as a project of ‘bounded flexibility’ in which marketisation is contained within certain limits as defined by trade unions’ ability to set the agenda of social partner negotiations. However, towards the end of the presidency the push towards labour law reform, whilst falling short of a wholesale revision of France’s protective legislative architecture, ushered in key changes which the Macron presidency intends to take forward and radicalise, leading to a potential ‘tipping point’ of labour market deregulation.

However, in his original judicial role, the Dutch prosecutor remains a powerful player. Only he can bring criminal cases to court and determine the parameters of court proceedings.

The scheme utilizes six basic steps to determine an index of morphological response (IMR) for each individual larvae; these steps evaluate (1) the loss of genuine segments and/or the presence of questionable segments, (2) the reduction in length of the antenna, (3) the displacement or loss of the ring organ, (4) the fusion of the apex of the basal segment, (5) the displacement of accessory organs, and (6) the presence of structures of unknown homology. The values for IMR are summed and divided by the total number of larvae examined to calculate an index of severity of antennal deformation (ISAD) for the sample population.

The overall mortality rates for kids and lambs were 30.8% and 33.5%, respectively. Significantly higher proportions of kids (80.2%) and lambs (75.6%) up to 3 months of age died compared to kids and lambs from 4 to 12 months of age. The differences in mortality rates, either between male and female kids and lambs or between single-born and multiple-birth kids and lambs, were not significant. The odds ratio (OR) and relative risks (RR) for lambs and kids, on the basis of sex and birth types, were not significant; neither were the values obtained for attributable risk, attributable fraction, population attributable risk and population attributable fraction. The overall mortality rate on the basis of species of animal was not significant. At the village level, significant differences in the proportions of mortality on the basis of sex were seen in two villages. At Akotokyir, more male lambs (54.2%) died compared to females (27.6%), while at Apewosika more female lambs (42.2%) died compared to males (16.7%). The only significant difference in mortality proportions on the basis of birth type at the village level was seen at Apewosika, where more single-born kids died (52.8%) compared to kids born with sibling(s) (28.4%). The significant ORs for mortalities were 3.10 for male lambs at Akotokyir, 3.35 for female lambs at Apewosika and 2.82 for single-born kids at Apewosika. The corresponding RRs were equally significant. On the basis of species, significantly more lambs died at Akotokyir (44.2%) and Kwesimprah (44.7%) compared to kids. The implications of these findings are discussed.","inCitations":["58621e03f9a8f23951d2b29004c63a9d0fd22797","315756245001a5214edc4e115c94230b3603851d","bc0a92c7f1f66da883b0f789576e12aeb78e3491","8a35628a326fd51967096c9db856fa70d93bb4e2","cd17128a5aa3f0b3095699ec2fc060d586ffb943","22d1838ae50bc8de218b948276b15e24e46564b2","baefe27b2820ad58551887b500e18185b86f210b","b519ea2cf2743f92de1315674c2e5368dfdf8aa1"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Lamb and Kid Mortality in Village Flocks in the Coastal Savanna Zone of Ghana","doi":"10.1023/A:1027314800711","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1023/A%3A1027314800711","venue":"Tropical Animal Health and Production"}

In this paper we explore the relationship between the finite and asymptotic means and variances of these statistics. We show that the asymptotic means and variances ofq converge to the same limits as those of ˆ ρs, as the number of quantile-categories increases. Also, these point estimates have distributions derived from the \"empirical bivariate quantile-partitioned\" (EBQP) distribution (Borkowf, Gail, Carroll and Gill (1997)), so we can use nonparametric EBQP methods to estimate the finite variances of these statistics from data and to compute the asymptotic variance ofq for any underlying bivariate distribution that satisfies certain regularity conditions. These results imply that we can numerically approximate the asymptotic variance of ˆ ρs, for which an explicit formula is not available except in special cases, to a degree of accuracy limited only by computing power.","inCitations":["8cc42c9344642c1ddce0eb538402c6d10419076a"],"pdfUrls":["http://www3.stat.sinica.edu.tw/statistica/oldpdf/a9n212.pdf"],"title":"A New Method for Approximating the Asymptotic Variance of Spearman's Rank Correlation","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

The CO 2 evolution rate from cultivated clay Phaeozem (Russia, Moscow region; 54°50'N, 37°35'E) were studied under field conditions from November 1997 to October 2002. The daily mean CO 2 evolution rate varied widely - from 0.9 to 246 mg C/m 2 /h. The total annual CO 2 flux from cultivated Phaeozem averaged 352 ± 148 g C/m 2 /year, the interannual variability amounted to 42%. We found significant linear trends ( R = 0.46- 0.55, P < 0.001) reflecting the relationship between CO 2 emission and soil temperature through the whole observation period and during spring and autumn seasons as well. The exponential equations described these relationships for the same periods more adequately than the simple linear equations (R = 0.62-0.68, P < 0.01). The temperature coeffici - ent Q 10 comprised 2.3 (for the whole data set) and was essentially higher 3.2-3.6 during the spring and autumn. The correlation between CO 2 evolution rate and soil moisture was insignificant for the whole period, winter, spring and autumn seasons as well. During the summer, correlation between CO 2 evolution rate and soil moisture was positive and very close (R = 0.74, P < 0.001), indicating that the soil moisture content was a main factor limitative the rate of CO 2 emission from soil for this period.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://www.agriculturejournals.cz/publicFiles/50959.pdf"],"title":"Effect of soil temperature and moisture on СO 2 evolution rate of cultivated Phaeozem: analysis of a long-term field experiment","doi":"10.17221/3576-pse","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.17221/3576-pse","venue":""}

This belief influenced the first Marists' descriptions of Pacific peoples, notably New Zealand Maori. The Marists consequently emphasised the noble savage trope and downplayed cannibalism.

Depression elongation is defined by the ratio of the long axis of the depression to its short axis. Depression orientation is measured by the azimuth of the long axis in relation to the azimuth of an associated line of structural fracture. From these data the percentage of structurally aligned depressions was determined. The percentage of structurally aligned depressions was found to be highest where the following conditions prevailed: 1) in areas where limestones were characterized by low insoluble residue contents; 2) in areas where hydraulic gradients were high, as indicated by the existence of high karst relief ratios; 3) in areas where a high proportion of the surface runoff was concentrated in the subterranean drainage systems; and 4) in areas, which were located near the mouth of the subterranean drainage system.
