The starting materials necessary for producing MOC were obtained from dolomite ore. Expanded perlite and exfoliated vermiculite were selected as filler for this study. The microstructure of MOC was imaged by scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction analyses. The experimental results demonstrate that the use of filler in the MOC led to a decrease in its density and thermal conductivity. The workability and fluidity of the MOC were strongly influenced by the amount of the filler. Although the amount of carbon in the MOC decreased with an increase in the amount of the filler, the carbonation of MOC was not totally prevented and it occurred through exposure of its surface to carbon dioxide at ambient temperature after 600 d of curing.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Influence of filler on the properties of magnesium oxychloride cement prepared from dolomite","doi":"10.1680/jemmr.17.00012","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1680/jemmr.17.00012","venue":""}

It is essential to consider all aspects of on-line analysis and automation, especially in the area of primary and subsequent sampling. More than 50 on-line analytical systems are now in use in a number of industries where processes can be automatically controlled. Many are operating under closed loop control. Dry powder processes such as cement, coal, iron ore, dried slurry, glass kiln feed, etc. can be controlled by automatically grinding, briquetting and presenting the sample to a Quantometer and by utilizing the 20 element assay obtained in 30 seconds as the input to digital controllers. In the cement industry the analysis is used to control weigh feeder belts and so eliminate the need for blending silos. It can be shown that the energy savings alone are more than sufficient to amortize the system in a year. In the mining industry all elements from Si to U are assayed in slurries. As many as 20 streams are assayed in 10 minutes. All assays are supplied by computer in dry weight percent including all corrections for pulp density and other elements. Many solutions can be readily analyzed for elemental concentrations down to 0.25ppm in an on-line mode. Oils can be analyzed for S and blended to ensure that the percent S in the final blend is correct prior to shipment. Oil blending systems can drastically reduce the blending and loading time of containers. Rapid amortization is obtained by reduced time and turnaround of vessels. Savings are obtained from on-line mining systems by increased throughput, increased recovery, reduced reagents, reduced maintenance and total reduced costs.","inCitations":["029e4bfeb4622c0a8110b076672fde18f99fbc28"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Automated on-line analysis for controlling industrial processes","doi":"10.1351/pac197749101609","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1351/pac197749101609","venue":""}

After 10-14 days, diabetic and age- and sex-matched control animals were killed, and their proximal small intestines were removed. Villus-tip, mid-villus, and lower-villus enterocytes were harvested from each group with a method that combined divalent cation chelation with mild mechanical dissociation. These fractions were used as starting material to prepare brush-border membrane vesicles. Preparations from each of these fractions were then analyzed and compared with respect to their Na(+)-gradient-dependent and Na(+)-independent D-glucose transport, lipid fluidity, and lipid composition. The results of these experiments demonstrated that 1) maximum rates of Na(+)-gradient-dependent D-glucose transport (Vmax) were greatest in membrane vesicles prepared from mature cells (villus tip and mid villus) of control rats; 2) the glucose concentration producing half-maximal rates of transport (Km), however, was significantly lower in lower-villus membrane vesicles of control rats, suggesting that a distinct glucose transporter existed in the membranes of these relatively immature enterocytes; 3) Na(+)-gradient-dependent, but not Na(+)-independent, D-glucose uptake was greater in diabetic membrane vesicles prepared from mid-villus and lower-villus fractions but not in vesicles prepared from villus-tip cells; and 4) no obvious relationship between alterations in membrane lipid fluidity and enhanced uptake of Na(+)-gradient-dependent D-glucose by these transporter(s) could be established in this experimental model of acute diabetes mellitus.","inCitations":["76215332b4c4cf7dc0f2827bad67c6ec50899697","e9fd484d5c53c5cc92d0298e425caf0f03434a90","846c487ca2aaf8fb0c21533759842deb8684327b","5d9ceef992ed6cfc9129212b1aecee36bcefd795","546db810b637726de4d53cfcf041a0023e1ee8e1","41518d68e51f959e99e0418c0e6e62b521b045d3","d6c625cb00010a02f7dbdbecccb93078569ea4da","dbc051a70827c0a252e584ae4a90906161a6ddff","c92ea1d76542bba8f356b5f97d954dcc2f5ff7c2","1d8010895c272f4734b2d891a4de0b9483dd035d","beaca3e1188419f27f058ec1dc27ee7dff5f53da","cf62f4b03c4f26acde0ff81743c779c66db43f7d","b65e7cf4b2fd92cfc142c0ae13c574af4756f716","891cb1b0d8d0cb1409fcc8788ad87134c3ce5e7d"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Intestinal D-glucose transport and membrane fluidity along crypt-villus axis of streptozocin-induced diabetic rats.","doi":"10.1152/ajpgi.1990.259.4.G571","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1152/ajpgi.1990.259.4.G571","venue":"The American journal of physiology"}

The Council for Agricultural Science and Technology has recently published a comprehensive review of the fate and transport of zoonotic pathogens that can be associated with swine manure. The majority of microbes in swine manure are not zoonotic, but several bacterial, viral, and parasitic pathogens have been detected. Awareness of the potential zoonotic pathogens in swine manure and how treatment, storage, and handling affect their survival and their potential to persist in the environment is critical to ensure that producers and consumers are not at risk. This review discusses the primary zoonotic pathogens associated with swine manure, including bacteria, viruses, and parasites, as well as their fate and transport. Because the ecology of microbes in swine waste is still poorly described, several recommendations for future research are made to better understand and reduce human health risks. These recommendations include examination of environmental and ecological conditions that contribute to off-farm transport and development of quantitative risk assessments.","inCitations":["c95c1f6e5b410e24a76aef47676ca6f464123de8","623db26aa8099ee08f9bacc5d108cf7bd2c50596","eb64ac3132826d0fd0110ad0dd083220eecb537a","69a71591b2fd98937402efbbb9f19931589551b5","2d8d0e21ea3625dc539efd6c1f97986d46b14ec2","a9de4f480e7ae3763c7d6832c3e95b209919f06f","dcff87c45be03b47a666215df9683f23fbf70db9","f9deb3a9b207afe1607f3bc3f3fc7032b71fff8c","e8458d3f2eb2fc599857885266d9180e7823adbe","49d46bf098f32d5c6d738dfb3711a58af54c5c8c","e18e563936dd8aefc05525efbf2146e5740ece05","8b4d16f59f53d92b4732e7c4c6927a3aed0ce55a","2ea6ede73b911ca0adefb3a430692a5bbb415273","e37a0a61f251043ccbece77f01ab96564b26751d","3ea5237be91dc243ab17a44b100a7c81cb3fa58b","08e9d74c81e2c0429c67deb203e6dd79a6389409","23483484e3de0fa06c76bbe47d7e5fc4067b7f50","28f8284adbe8c02526c85cbf99cd0b57fa773dff","135ce7b062ed8b44f527bcf58974aa99f0871b19","7f571624d906b7fc63ae96c3625dd60ad48cc59a","2331a493cd95adf3b4c22dd0c94c752c29f2b2ec","56f913230f6db5d3100a69e451bbdba42a4f9263","174f91b7f3137af53739977e11a6fc78d358c464","6ca5783024e7a80d83fa9dea4a6659dadb78f735","ba353008cdba0cebd13bf4ef08c8358e79695443","fd3f7f18acaa61331efe3c581b487f857113f7c0","5394166f91e7816c43c541fb63be052afd83a172","37574cc5d3926970e017394f05ec314b67bd9d25","baed51dd7121252d27a11a7af094b18740569c1c","13fcc56ebf104f69a2a3849142616974730ff7ec","9baf94c34f6704701bf683916a009f4e1319a792","5cab529e78a0c8a6bb68b7567e7d202bac67fd3b","53b1ec4ffa0b8928099979e18642d7405c85ed74","2a58a602a0154e9297823b793cd51d026ec4c8b8","f3a1b575c27c623bd6e8e576f324ed7b42ca3084","8d67220966be14c07b0a5bd02433b1268120c204","5dd739bd22afa9bbdf22a9ba1154965451539e89","007f54ce30014b413644b6a941dc8561788a7a8d","08dc253787735f826877863ef1707744db657cef"],"pdfUrls":["http://old.pork.org/filelibrary/resources/04838.pdf","https://www.animalsciencepublications.org/publications/jas/pdfs/88/13/E84"],"title":"Fate and transport of zoonotic, bacterial, viral, and parasitic pathogens during swine manure treatment, storage, and land application.","doi":"10.2527/jas.2009-2331","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.2527/jas.2009-2331","venue":"Journal of animal science"}

Consumption poverty is found to be high, with an overall head count of 47 per cent, in 1994, and 40 per cent, in 2000. As monetary measures may not appropriately capture welfare in non-monetary dimensions of life, non-monetary indicators, such as, subjective welfare status, nutritional status of children and housing characteristics are also examined. The findings indicate that there is a significant association between consumption poverty and subjective welfare status, but a weak agreement in ranking of households. Non poor households, in terms of consumption, are found to enjoy better housing amenities. However, the association between consumption poverty and child nutritional status is not strong. Poverty dynamics is also analysed using transition matrices and multivariate regression techniques. It was found that over 58 per cent of panel households had experienced poverty at least once during the period. Of these, over half had been chronically poor. The poverty transition was also quite significant with over a quarter of households experiencing a change in their poverty status. The results also showed that households with higher dependency ratio and whose heads are self employed, casual workers, pensioners and unemployed have a lower probability of exiting poverty.

OL- and serine-glycine-containing lipid (SGL)-induced TNF-alpha production in J774.1 and RAW 264.7 cells required serum. However, in CD14-deficient LR-9 cells, TNF-alpha was not induced by the OLs in the presence or absence of serum. OLs and a SGL almost completely inhibited the binding of (125)I-LPS to J774.1 cells.

In Korea, composite steel and concrete construction, and cast-in-place concrete flat plate construction are the most commonly used structural systems. However, there is a lack of data related to the relative construction costs of these two structure types. This paper compares material quantities for representative building models up to 80 stories in height using both types of structural system. Based on a typical floor plan, six models are developed and the buildings are designed for gravity and lateral loading. Quantities of materials for each model are calculated and compared. The information presented can be used with appropriate cost data to compare construction costs for the two structural system types.

Our approach, which has been proposed in Turski (1984), is based on the theory of singular surfaces. This theory has been developed by Thomas (1961) and recently generalized by Cohen and Wang (1982). In order to express the first variation of the action integral in the class of discontinuous fields, in terms of arbitrary variations, variational conditions of compatibility are formulated. These conditions generalize Thomas' kinematical conditions of compatibility. The necessary and sufficient conditions for the action integral to be stationary in the considered class of fields are given. As an application, the problem of wave propagation within the framework of plate model with the fourth order differential equation for the transverse vibrations, including rotational inertia term, is investigated. The speed of propagation and the wave amplitude as a function of time, for the third order waves, are given without any restriction on the geometry of wave fronts.","inCitations":["cc282f7180c08d24a533b8d2a8ffea0da544f1cf","58c7817480f6d674bf16a8da993c9a5cc9b9fb2e","5e36ec8ac483797d60dcd9c1e5e9e631aa2d7bd0","7316a784d06583ae594f1461ececc872ef32faaa","d4475a596b00d1f98dc7a58b8d20261b1b419ec4","6039f4a28745088fc6e227ac3a49402d5861dfa0","bb7ca69baa00dc13eb042c5a8b9bfc19f079e93e","cc363139bb25087feaa09d4f89567dbd33706ecf","78534fc102f9327c3b646012ecd4b0ef7f1230aa"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Variational Principles in Continuum Mechanics and Their Application if the Study of Propagating Discontinuities","doi":"10.1016/B978-0-444-42697-0.50035-7","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-444-42697-0.50035-7","venue":""}

TREM like transcript-1 (TLT-1) is a membrane receptor found in platelets α-granules with activating properties. We have demonstrated that activated platelets release a soluble isoform of TLT-1 (sTLT-1) which is not found in the plasma of healthy individuals. Moreover, evaluation of patients suffering from inflammatory diseases, such as sepsis, reveals a significant increase of plasma sTLT-1 levels. It is not known if TLT-1 plays a role in auto immune diseases such as Lupus. In the present study we evaluate the potential that TLT-1 may play a role in the etiology of SLE. We assessed the plasma of 46 SLE patients and compared to 28 healthy controls by ELISA. Our results showed that SLE patients had a significant decrease in plasma sTLT-1 levels compared to healthy controls (9.0 [7.2] vs. 18.6 [22.3] ng/ml, p=0.008).

Viral RNAs were isolated by oligoprobe capture, and a 605 bp fragment containing a part of the viral coat protein gene was amplified by RT-PCR. Sequence variation among isolates was characterized by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis and confirmed by sequencing. The GFLV infections are found as a complex mixture of closely related genomes. In further studies, RFLP analyses of virus isolates using AluI showed that GFLV populations in Tunisian vineyards consist of two restrictotypes corresponding to distinct sub-populations Sp1 and Sp2. The relative field distribution of these sub-populations showed that Sp2 was more abundant. Individual genomes were recovered by cloning the RT-PCR products. The sequences were found to vary from each other by as much as 11%. Cloning from mixed infections showed that Sp2 are also predominant.","inCitations":["5b1be15f84a860f9fb4bf27182db56ed4c7a6ab9","cd42d5dbdbe1b6bd5f296aabe46a70d4965e9a43","7d55e6068392b91cc2dd54cd04ed66e8e00d6d3a","1b7e1d0d9b527332e617fe5297953357d360afb2","d77efe192ebeef4a8cfed400792532bd90d6fe0f","59afbcc12a97cb5db4b14dac2776f980a0bc197e","d04c4ef0822ce70bee17a7f8455059f9d81240a4","f17d34905247b252c662cc752beda91d14cf5392","5fbf507bc2f08ce5c6ad61f538b74aaaa05d6bab","bbf8b913e799a81479213d91ef9550d70522a957","244f1e34d52c18e2fbf38927e0346e524dbdfd88","36968e560dec25e63f52ba378a02d7bfa4ef1971","db5d22f478d139791bb4a1c764900622b764e989","5e63f39ca86cdc7e91f92e9076d8f8ec1162d4b8","2ad5df810c188c93bd06aa3cc03d0097181427a5","c77b2a7c35b0d6357116dbae676861fa20de9cbd"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"RT-PCR-RFLP for genetic diversity analysis of Tunisian Grapevine fanleaf virus isolates in their natural host plants.","doi":"10.1016/j.jviromet.2005.03.008","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2005.03.008","venue":"Journal of virological methods"}

Loss of MT1-MMP results in craniofacial abnormalities. Here we show that MT1-MMP forms a complex with FGFR2 and ADAM9 in osteoblasts and proteolytically inactivates ADAM9, hence protecting FGFR2 from ADAM9-mediated ectodomain shedding on the cell surface. In Mmp14-/- osteoblasts, FGF-induced proliferation and downstream signaling are specifically compromised, in conjunction with ADAM9 upregulation and FGFR2 shedding. The retarded parietal growth in Mmp14-/- embryos starts at 15.5 dpc, attributable to the impaired FGFR2 signaling due to increased shedding mediated by ADAM9. Adam9 depletion completely rescues the defective FGFR2 signaling and largely restores calvarial bone growth in Mmp14-/- embryos. These data reveal a regulatory paradigm for FGRF2 signaling and identify MT1-MMP as a critical negative modulator of ADAM9 activity to maintain FGFR2 signaling in calvarial osteogenesis.","inCitations":["d2d93673c32013143f9f6ca3f1f0551bdbf460be","1654cb38ef96dc6f1df425e291788ce605ac20cc","fdb1edd212c2485286cdfc51b89b74518cbb6f5d","79f2e28ebfd99daa789bc0dfb50b0fe65ae4f1a2","f1074ce556c9f6d4ec3d90b19c922b306518166d","1f1d655330f7b671c02b74a5c6eb54c4b68aef8c","8b4d23d548d2df859e35db948e5e2a60582c0dd0","ed597fc277d46cd5a9370f981ffb212dfafc893e","2d7175dc55e0dfccd83eefbcb5f8a7ea9679b18b","66d28aa76945d56e3d60b665eb1d3932c12f2ae4","ac447835992b24a0e359fb7512020740bd639d2e","3abba60ee4fcb08a48710fdf1bca9b4dde08ad78","a8ad4a01f01b3c2470855d270f99a4ed96793d62","bafe7c053a8c98ba2b7c69b69d3455f7f145a0cb","6092d87c6602f014600e2eae4aee15f7dc6dc880","4ef16ad9cdc2af0c5a235795ab23a6b5814a4eb3","a5f7e8f4953dee46b3504b75337598983ee5a1d3","b9a49553400822f658fa825ddb387a76434448cf","180e17a9374581dff3f638ec6ec37cac2492dac2","1cad417bb5ee522f008cf172211d2a7d67661451","9839e9cb267a4454b04e89e6333473a00de173cb","c18385b83e987136f69779b699a114d7156d71a2","29f22641832b87a07c5150475865d8b2d378f3e7","295c0a1bb53d63c0e4e9e6ea5605fb5a675ed5ef","9fb8ec59def903975501efa6dcfaca2aa4863166","96c277d5da0eb6fb602ed22748f5cff37aaa5948","cceefab4315b5a1071860c3dfccf9702b43796be","b5d1194b59d71eaa32761dc82461b007c313aece","e0cc89a85df27aa9f599b3e4e2e3a73727141f40","f219b6de45fb50581a37b95238cdb9ff9ebe0a77","92d1226afafbb5beb5d82f857ff1b0fa36cd27db","eb5d18b4d285853550334eacd4b20fe1b7ab5c79"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"MT1-MMP inactivates ADAM9 to regulate FGFR2 signaling and calvarial osteogenesis.","doi":"10.1016/j.devcel.2012.04.014","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.devcel.2012.04.014","venue":"Developmental cell"}

The main obstacles encountered are still at least proposed of Raperda derived from the legislature. To overcome these obstacles, local governments and DPRD are making efforts to improve the human resources of the DPRD through education, training or comparative studies.

The Ambassador adaptation process was evaluated to 1 Identify the major challenges encountered and successful strategies utilized; 2 Assess strengths and weaknesses by benchmarking it with the ADAPTE framework; and 3 Identify opportunities for improvement.\n\n\nMETHOD\nExternal consultants reviewed the Ambassador and ADAPTE materials and conducted semi-structured telephone interviews with 29 participants from the AAP committees. All participants were asked about the major challenges encountered and potential areas for improvement.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe response rate was 83% (29/35). There was strong consensus that the Ambassador guideline adaptation process was sound and rigorous all respondents indicated willingness to participate in further iterations of the Program. Key elements of success were identified. The main steps and sequence of the process were closely aligned with the ADAPTE framework, although the AAP incorporated additional enhancements which augmented the process. The main divergences between the two frameworks centred on the organizational structure and the methods used to overcome methodological difficulties.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe AAP successfully utilized existing stakeholder interest to create an overarching guideline for managing LBP across multiple primary care disciplines. The study highlighted the strengths and weaknesses of the Program, and identified practical strategies for improvement. Evaluating guideline adaptation processes is pivotal to ensuring that they continue to be an efficient, rigorous and practicable option for producing contextualized, clinically relevant guidelines.","inCitations":["6e0db63b80f70f319959b2718f7129213d26995f","e3b636862e864e61bb41337cf1a8f6eb27443ac4","8c25d071be839637543b19237d53d80e1f699804","56babda9264fed3dacf162c0387efb57bd5470ce","5d864034a6f34bd18f8d2c12457a1471e36b3ae8","f48ad443c8af28fe5dee8a6bed9459a1e0d24d47"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Adapting low back pain guidelines within a multidisciplinary context: a process evaluation.","doi":"10.1111/j.1365-2753.2012.01848.x","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2753.2012.01848.x","venue":"Journal of evaluation in clinical practice"}

Necroptosis, or programmed cell necrosis, is mediated by the receptor interacting protein kinase-1 and -3/mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein (RIP1/RIP3/MLKL) pathway, and is involved in several neurodegenerative diseases. Here we aimed to explore the involvement of necroptosis in 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1, 2, 3, 6-tetrahydropyridine hydrochloride (MPTP)-induced PD and determine the potential mechanisms. We found that the protein levels of RIP1, RIP3, and MLKL increased significantly in a MPTP-induced mouse PD model. High expression of RIP1/RIP3/MLKL was associated with severe loss of dopaminergic neurons. Pretreatment with necrostatin-1 or the knockout of the RIP3/MLKL gene to block necroptosis pathway dramatically ameliorated PD by increasing dopamine levels and rescuing the loss of dopaminergic neurons, independent of the apoptotic pathway. Moreover, upregulation of inflammatory cytokines in MPTP-treated mice was partially inhibited by deletion of RIP3 or MLKL gene, indicating that a positive feedback loop exists between these genes and inflammatory cytokines. Our data indicate that RIP1/RIP3/MLKL-mediated necroptosis is involved in the pathogenesis of MPTP-induced PD. Downregulating the expression of RIP1, RIP3, or MLKL can significantly attenuate MPTP-induced PD. Future therapy targeting necroptosis may be a promising new option. In this study, the authors show that RIP1/RIP3/MLKL-mediated necroptosis is activated in a mouse model of Parkinson’s disease. Blockade of necroptosis through pharmacological intervention by Nec-1 or deletion of RIP3/MLKL gene increased dopamine levels and the number of dopaminergic neurons in mice. Moreover, necroptosis enhanced the expression of pro-inflammatory genes, which may have initiated neuroinflammation and in turn aggravated dopaminergic neuron necroptosis.","inCitations":["99cd36a9c390dc348c2977da19d6424a38d956a6","c684be3b033208e88e82988ed7156e7334e3d3dd","af9d35ed1b87dd1158939728b3cf869597b06745"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"RIP1/RIP3/MLKL mediates dopaminergic neuron necroptosis in a mouse model of Parkinson disease","doi":"10.1038/s41374-019-0319-5","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41374-019-0319-5","venue":"Laboratory Investigation"}

This study aimed to investigate the correlation between the molecular subtype and immune contexture of gastric cancers.MethodsThe immune contexture, including the type, density, and location of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), of gastric cancer patients was examined and immune subtypes were classified based on it. In particular, PD-L1 expression on tumor cells and TILs and Foxp3+ TILs was assessed in accordance with molecular subtypes.ResultsHigh levels of visual TIL estimates and Foxp3+ TILs were markedly associated with increased overall survival (P = 0.001, P < 0.001, separately). Immune subtypes were associated with tumor size, gross type, depth of invasion, lymph node metastatic status, lymphovascular invasion, perineural invasion, and microsatellite instability status. EBV-positive (C1) and MSI (C2) gastric cancers, considered subtypes with better prognosis, were significantly associated with high TIL levels (P < 0.05). In contrast, epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT, C3) gastric cancers with poor overall survival displayed low levels of Foxp3+ TILs. Type II tumors (low level of TILs/low PD-L1 expression) displayed a significant correlation with poor overall survival (P = 0.004) and accounted for the highest proportion in the aberrant p53-expressing (C4) gastric cancers.ConclusionThe molecular subtype of gastric cancers is correlated with the immune subtype, including immune contexture and PD-L1 expression, within the tumor microenvironment.","inCitations":["a8a49d1453113ab69141539fbe02e4031e26be85","e8a86a1bc6b5bd73b5f148d3771732e6678ce2eb"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Differences in immune contextures among different molecular subtypes of gastric cancer and their prognostic impact","doi":"10.1007/s10120-019-00974-4","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10120-019-00974-4","venue":"Gastric Cancer"}

La tasa de 11,3 suicidios lo ubica como pais de alto riesgo. Objetivo: identificar caracteristicas de personalidad y cognoscitivas del grupo de suicidas de Chile que dejaron nota suicida, realizando un analisis de su contenido. Metodo: estudio de campo, descriptivo y ex post facto. Se analizaron todos los casos de suicidio registrados del 2010 al 2012 por la Policia de Investigaciones de Chile, localizandose 203 notas de 96 suicidas. Se aplico el metodo de interjueces y la guia de categorias de Darbonne para el analisis de contenido. Resultados: la edad promedio de los suicidas fue 44,2 anos (SD = 18,53). La mayoria de las notas fueron dirigidas a familiares (51,7%). Las razones para el suicidio mas comunmente expresadas fueron maritales o interpersonales (24,6%); otro 23,6% expreso una falta de sentido para vivir (incluyendo desesperanza, depresion, deseos de morir y baja autoestima). El contenido mas frecuente fueron instrucciones (sobre dinero, hijos o funeral). Todas las notas mostraron un curso de pensamiento logico y fueron escritas con coherencia y claridad. Notablemente, 42% de las notas tenia afectos positivos, amor y dependencia de otros. En cuanto a actitudes, las mas comunes fueron de escape o despedida (42,4%), seguidas por fatalismo, desesperanza, frustracion y cansancio (40%). En las diferentes categorias de analisis (razones manifiestas para el suicidio, sentimientos, actitudes, afectos y enfoque general de la nota) se encontraron 24 diferencias significativas segun cohortes de edad, estado civil y sexo. Conclusiones: los resultados coadyuvan para crear el perfil del suicida chileno y para la implementacion de programas de prevencion del suicidio.","inCitations":["3855bbcf5335760e044117f295f414be611078ff","2a0b5992cb5867b0aad57084354df7993e367356"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Perfil de suicidas chilenos vía análisis de contenido de notas póstumas","doi":"10.12804/apl34.3.2016.06","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.12804/apl34.3.2016.06","venue":""}

This can be a result of a number of factors including increased tidal water heights due to low localised atmospheric pressure, increased wave set-up due to strong sustained winds or large rainfall events over the catchment following landfall of the cyclone. The relative rarity and complexity of these events mean that a realistic measure of the flood risk facing these catchments based on historical data may be difficult to determine. Stochastic models of cyclones provide a tool to produce longer simulated records which maintain observed statistical measures. Cyclones exhibit a number of joint probability effects in both spatial and temporal domains, and also often have physical trends or constraints imposed by the local bathymetry and weather patterns. A method for modelling cyclone occurrence and tracks is presented along with a case study showing the application to cyclones formed in the North Indian Ocean, focussing in the Bay of Bengal. Cyclone occurrence is determined using a Temporally-Varied Poisson process model, whilst the cyclone tracks are modelled through the use of multivariate VAR models. The trivariate relationship between cyclone intensity, cyclone location and cyclone duration is investigated and a model based on Acceptance-Rejection techniques, which preserves both the spatial and temporal distributions, is proposed. The methodology is general and may be applied to other cyclone-prone regions, provided sufficient data is available.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Stochastic Cyclone Modelling in the Bay of Bengal","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

The attribution of cancer to environmental causes has been difficult. There are uncertainties because of the long latency period in the development of cancer, the difficulties in characterizing past exposures, the lack of scientific evidence about the cancer risk of most environmental toxicants, and the growing awareness of cancer-predisposing genes. It seems that cancer reflects the confluence of many processes. In the simplistic two step model of cancer, the development of clinical cancer requires both initiation and promotion, but the latency period between initiation and promotion could be as long as thirty years. Sunlight exposure ranks as the most important environmental carcinogen, as there is strong evidence that excessive sun exposure causes skin cancer. Environmental tobacco smoke (ETS), also commonly known as second-hand smoke or passive smoke, originates from the exhalations of smokers and the side stream emissions from cigarettes, cigars, or pipes between smokes. ETS contains all of the established and suspected carcinogens found in mainstream smoke generated by active smoking. Both researchers and the general public have long suspected air pollution to be a cause of cancer, in particular lung cancer.However, there are many difficulties in identifying airborne carcinogens and calculating their cancer risks.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"51 – Environmental Exposures and Cancer","doi":"10.1016/B978-012288145-9/50059-0","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-012288145-9%2F50059-0","venue":""}

When inactivated, secreted frizzled receptor protein 1 (SFRP1), a cellular Wnt-inhibitor protein, may enhance cancer development. The aim of this study was to assess the expression of SFRP1 in the invasive front of tongue squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Immunohistochemical expression of SFRP1 in the cohesive and discohesive invasive front of 36 resection specimens of tongue SCC was investigated. Immunostaining was compared with tumour size, tumour thickness, and neural invasion. Immunoreactivity increased in depth from the surface of the tumour to the invasive front. There was a statistically significant association between type of invasive front and pattern of SFRP1 expression. A discohesive invasive front showed more intense immunoreactivity. No statistically significant associations were found between the intensity of staining and relevant prognostic factors. Tongue SSC has variable SFRP1 expression in different parts of the tumour and the greatest expression is in the invasive front. The more intense staining in the discohesive invasive front compared with the cohesive invasive front might contribute to the worse prognosis of cancers with a discohesive invasive front.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Immunohistochemical expression of secreted frizzled receptor protein 1 in the invasive front of tongue squamous cell carcinoma.","doi":"10.1111/eos.12252","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1111/eos.12252","venue":"European journal of oral sciences"}

In total, 19.3% (6/31) of the farms had at least one animal positive for T. foetus. The contact of females with males from other farms [Odds ratio, 5.9; 95% CI, 1.5–22.4; p = 0.009] was identified as a risk factor for T. foetus infection. This study demonstrates that T. foetus infection is prevalent among dairy cows in the state of Paraiba, Brazil. Sexual resting, removal of positive females, and avoiding contact of females with males from other farms are recommended to reduce the risk of infection.","inCitations":["e3b52740063932210627a683691041fdd63fefaa","0168c7635c78f2040401723a7a1d960123b4beda"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Prevalence and risk factors associated with Tritrichomonas foetus infection in cattle in the state of Paraíba, Brazil","doi":"10.1515/ap-2018-0039","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1515/ap-2018-0039","venue":"Acta Parasitologica"}

This study aims to determine factors associated with adverse outcome of TB treatment in PLHIV. Materials and Method: The study was retrospective cohort study which includes 958 individuals aged ≥15 years who were registered in a large ART program with comprehensive care for HIV in Yangon. The study period was between January 2012 to December 2014. All individuals who were diagnosed with both HIV and TB were included in the study. Patients’ characteristics, TB history, ART status, CD4 cell count and sputum smear microscopy result were extracted from the clinic database and patient’s medical journals to determine the association with TB treatment outcomes. Data analysis was done by univariate and multivariate logistic regression. Result: Median age of patients was 34 years and 61.5% were male patients. Of 958 patients,654(68.3%) of participants had favorable treatment outcomes, whereas 186(19.4%) died, 88(9.2%) loss to follow up and 30(3.1%) treatment failure during 12 months of study period. The ART coverage was 80% in all TB-HIV co-infected patients. The adverse outcomes were mostly seen in the group of patients who did not receive ART and who did not get tested for CD4 cell counts. Patients who did not receive antiretroviral therapy during the course of antituberculosis treatment and low CD4 cell count at the diagnosis of TB were statistically significant predictors (P value .000) for adverse treatment outcomes of TB. No difference in adverse outcome was seen in patients who had ART in 8 weeks of ATT and after 8 weeks of ATT. Conclusion: Early diagnosis of both infections and early ART initiation during the course of ATT are important factors in preventing adverse outcome of Tuberculosis.

The author’s aim of this work is to suggest his own way of the patient’s intubation in a field condition by the application of the method which has not been described in the literature yet. A several dozen of patients have been intubated by this method in such conditions which did not represent even the minimum for intubation done in a conventional way, but they were enough to prove our method. Maximum performing time for the sample was 15 seconds. We consider that, using this method, the endo-tracheal intubation can be realized in all conditions up to now thought untouchable. This method requires only 30 to 35 cm wider space than patient’s shoulders occupate and 20 to 30 cm extra of his height. The only noted inadequacy is the risk in spine injury intubation, but with more careful treatment it can be avoided. Key words: Endotracheal intubation, cardiopul-monal resuscitation, field condition, restrained space.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Endotracheal Intubation Done In Field Conditions Of Restrained Space","doi":"10.15360/1813-9779-2010-3-87","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.15360/1813-9779-2010-3-87","venue":""}

The Sino-British Joint Declaration on the Question of Hong Kong calls for maintaining Hong Kong's lifestyle and \"high degree of autonomy\" for fifty years after its transition to the Hong Kong SAR. The primary research question that this thesis will attempt to answer is: How has the concept of \"high degree of autonomy\" been operationalized since its inception in the \"Joint Declaration of the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Government of the People's Republic of China on the Question of Hong Kong\"? This thesis argues that during the period of time from the signing of the Joint Declaration to the actual reversion to Chinese sovereignty the negotiations over the concept of Hong Kong's \"high degree of autonomy\" established the framework for the post-reversion way of life in Hong Kong. This thesis looks at this issue in three areas - the political arena, the security environment, and the economy. This thesis also examines the situation in Hong Kong one year after reversion and answers the question, \"Has China lived up to its promises in these three realms of autonomy?\" This period marks the start of a new political and economic experiment for China. China is attempting to regain the sovereignty of Hong Kong peacefully without disrupting its economic, social, and political systems under the framework of the Joint Declaration. The reversion of Hong Kong to Chinese sovereignty will be a test of China's \"one country, two systems\" concept.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"High degree of autonomy : the reversion of Hong Kong to Chinese sovereignty","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Parents completed a standardized questionnaire regarding health events and lifestyle factors. In addition, skin-prick tests were performed and total serum immunoglobulin (IgE) was determined.\n\n\nRESULTS\nLifetime prevalence rates for atopic disease and rates of allergic sensitization were highest in children from social class III (in which parents had more than 10 years of formal education) and lowest in social class I (less than 10 years of parental education), while rates in social class II (10 years of parental education) were constant at an intermediate level.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe data confirmed the assumption that in formerly socialist countries social inequalities existed under the socialist system, which were reflected by a social gradient in health outcomes. The findings support the hypothesis that increased access to modern lifestyle could be one reason for the increasing rates of atopic disorders during the last 3 decades.","inCitations":["5ecfdfa0d5b52cf770c044c2404aef74eac74308","5defed038d0814895cb53aebbb8a156b8aee7459","7fc870e046af4b004cd9528797c9c6f8e0070268","b7abf9f0ce3c9b1c7e4ee8185456aa7f50100f89","1c2084cd5b7f987fd41656e1177ae04504a87f49","58e5a18a0cd9bbbe2f1f8b8fd2bc337f540e986f","1cdb1d11112b8a0e1b531e7858a9f56290036ec9","7adb5cacdd3623b45548defc76d2a7ffa29522f2","e47898e6aaefe556817095f5512797ddece74b59","ddb4ab421ad4fa29a5ee4abc5fb1ab3acd41144d","b7beddbd15428e1eeb53865bd1b5babd1f058ae9","bc03c7ba4229105dd74621711b535def5a3723ee","ccaf2e77447b8452dee32dcf90170c87f6f451c8","c944a23b3971a4d07c8ecf60bc2f364b12fc16a8","dae92f7f0315196e582770e43816c2e6691b4236","7f90bebf83172127783e9be094f6a53ce8925169","06ae48c13318555afc3d9a019241883fdd25de70"],"pdfUrls":["https://www.st-va.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1509081/pdf/amjph00021-0031.pdf"],"title":"Atopy in children and parental social class.","doi":"10.2105/AJPH.88.9.1319","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.2105/AJPH.88.9.1319","venue":"American journal of public health"}

In this study, we investigated the relative abundance, occurrence, and seasonal distribution of polio and other enteroviruses at three wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in Naples, Southern Italy, from January 2010 to December 2014. Influent and effluent samples from the three WWTPs were collected monthly. One hundred and sixty-one of the 731 wastewater samples collected (22.0%) before and after water treatment were CPE positive on RD cells; while no samples were positive on L20B cells from any WWTPs. Among the 140 non-polio enterovirus isolated from inlet sewage, 69.3% were Coxsackieviruses type B and 30.7% were Echoviruses. Among these, CVB3 and CVB5 were most prevalent, followed by CVB4 and Echo6. The twenty-one samples tested after treatment contained 6 CVB4, 5 CVB3, 3 Echo11, and 2 Echo6; while other serotypes were isolated less frequently. Data on viral detection in treated effluents of WWTPs confirmed the potential environmental contamination by HEVs and could be useful to establish standards for policies on wastewater management.","inCitations":["058e889223a7dd0154867289d1df00d7d75099b4","f851dcfc8422c55896f290b2790215068d6b4226","a3740a1694e901d7df308d6d2c6df9ea0592cb54"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Large-Scale Survey of Human Enteroviruses in Wastewater Treatment Plants of a Metropolitan Area of Southern Italy","doi":"10.1007/s12560-017-9331-3","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s12560-017-9331-3","venue":"Food and Environmental Virology"}

The molecular factors that cause an acute wound in diabetic patients to become chronic have not yet been established. Wound healing is known to require a balance between the accumulation of collagenous and non-collagenous extracellular matrix components and their remodelling by matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and the tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs). Our aim was to assess if the concentrations of MMPs and TIMPs were different between acute and chronic wounds in diabetic patients by analysing biopsy samples.\n Methods. A 5 mm punch biopsy was taken from 20 diabetic foot ulcers of patients before initiating treatment and from traumatic wounds of 12 non-diabetic patients 2 days after injury. The concentrations of MMP-1, MMP-2pro, MMP-2active, MMP-8, MMP-9 and TIMP-2 were measured in detergent extracts of the biopsy homogenates using ELISAs and gelatine-zymography.\n Results. The concentration of MMP-1 was increased 65-fold in biopsies of diabetic foot ulcers compared with the concentrations measured in biopsies of traumatic wounds. Similarly, MMP-2pro were increased threefold, sixfold for MMP-2active, twofold for MMP-8 and 14-fold for MMP-9 compared to average concentrations in biopsies of traumatic wounds. Furthermore, the expression of TIMP-2 was reduced twofold in diabetic wounds compared with lesions of non-diabetic patients.\n Conclusion/interpretation. The combination of increased concentrations of MMPs with decreased concentrations of TIMP-2 in chronic diabetic foot ulcers compared with healing wounds in normal patients suggests that the increased proteolytic environment contributes to the failure of diabetic wounds to heal. New treatment strategies for healing chronic diabetic foot ulcers could be directed towards reducing concentrations of MMPs and increasing levels of TIMPs.","inCitations":["cb4c222ccf1f032f1508e6a7ce2e4040bc256cfc","da19a8fe024be4f774dc755a902a87f307a50cc5","f8fdff9f0932d7da03f687d86f4a05e868a6a607","6406ec4770d40bc468d7318909facceb435619ba","5821a0b51d7df4d1272856e4cc17fdc012f546dc","d1caf1713440f45277d6622168057e9beac4a7e6","bf8c762025b25f9835fe96395ed84baa053d6042","16e55f1a6a3004c238df677d46d7d855624e7baf","e19b352fc09b1c6a50eb1e5212b37aae3d6996a1","57c4666672b97c429fadb51fa2a149dfa543329c","ff4d46bc47a47bbf6ef17cee5003be9459c05382","6bc10e179710a3b7741d12f0fb96d58d899fe091","5970feae55426c74becd2720e07f62d6ff26d2f7","e4823154383c235766df408b03795ee24ee54c40","912ed0b4ab84ca627009d29cd0a7705b40903427","50c706562feb707440f2da2917880d814a566851","30a2724a7cf0b1941e754fb262e87b5740da4edf","fa0eb980cc7263c9ab9514c6fb4c86fc383a30df","4a31c424fc70ad45712b33885fa72b4c4fc1b168","54adafce2679a8ea112fa6502b03d63d4ce7f942","ea7fd6e2fcdfd3ac8704e5b24c52e839575a7d8b","3a95b717856c21abf46db5076089e946031e3958","ec854e8ca9037153c53943c77ba4ffc1d3e8b984","fcec1de971b9f3b42083c74689ee78470837b471","b9388eecf26eccb3e2afff1f5b7212cbab4563ed","5d3187c46e9a4a22a72cc8e071ad3f7f1dca0f69","14d03e82026cfd778ab5ea1145af1c0d22b6599b","897428c0b362c616fe62b21ffb2ce9b16e733ff6","b31dd63dbe609486441279e71779294b9a64c627","877f6e4234de2e83e47a016dedf4061575bfafea","80ed95c9aa919e8e57b79f96f61381699d5fc30f","f546e91254f2e4a42fb1c4529983014f76aea894","57b415043840336b79d821c721aa2ea27493b440","0855d8ed7074b1d88b15d4aa07e17d4272a96301","98216fa5f80d8247a4d4ede9dbc98feb75c71e15","13a558dc8747cb64782d77fabde8cdbe0c69b805","7870aa36b4f3564a858e4c1f39f0a2d7e03f1ae6","24a5bcc9408cfd5450f2bb3278ecb72a5e7d4b89","03b5312d08a91108277a5b86d533c5cfc38db6b4","fc8c32a930cdab8a8c49a6910a6286ba2bbcf706","0397d839eb77376d4811c9cd02f779737de35479","1a7c60f7f6caa909e6c7ff61c4439b34b3fefce7","dd1c8de40bf30185c34bf7308b152b29bf3ac474","483d7fcc9635ee5e71ac30bf55653f33462b1afc","55ba02563930f981a2458f9cbd3331f2291e1af2","9332cb410f7af1a791ef0ffc74af62db6d8a42e9","3211d43759e827c34234fa0e34482d3e626278a1","b52a58ba8dc84b1c197dec1dba4f8d58eff978aa","9dfb0c483124a880177edfff4ab209d589e21d3e","8f278d88906a6d7dad53ca7e76f96195201ff2a8","2ab62bfe76ac5e5b3080efaefb80d57eabab3805","edf6cf9ad8923ed88e55c29a82787b0c0d7d71f4","5dcce70f87034a22168d0b6d87dec6b1623a51a7","fbb24ec3dcea3fcbb5787a2a815a7a838dcd383e","03d606f70cf5ef4b7d5696db4cd0fd9e6d8f9234","4769ab3e1ffc235d45b306f746067747b28931e6","685af6accf5d4ade39c18eaf7fb3d5a953535016","229488ba59c5d283a61d84e04abeb8bf8599dd2c","02c76445d665c31d491afa689de675a361bd8495","cc79426ddc9b41eb72a7cc2ae61b3702d2dc1e86","5070c5a4322f4d1754f541b0df6a3c718c29466e","78d9dde70e8b4644a22bc8bf6a7ea4759e54dacb","70f0406cc439d017c7957385cfc7620f7ba1f01e","10b2c001e04c4763b63823afc59ba40a7272c346","4ad953e50cf54c1382b528efebddca8daf8b1101","037c224d4d098589e74053261c6a9d6221f2a5dd","86b18e4adab6f16c344b72be89dfc044f7e25a5d","b0ac1752d3a1a18423ed0bccc16dba249164a6d4","4bdef6946dc3fb14e05e15caae39f4ba3bd46ffd","2c061ea93b7eccda2d85897da241a2b616265a4a","7a0189b4e0905b01d3652d50df1f39e0c3896c5a","5214dcc6e0b5044fe486c0d660e74b7fc0b0643d","83391143d68270bf5a0905a3db5816685b099fd3","0aab482d5bc9377b48a235e2310d0ef5b402c298","324f4f8f8fbf40aaa0403a3b40ff70fef3197fac","b4aea087b1e199204f6f84bf63112210269ba0e3","40f7957d968f0aaf3570dce335996efff8c484cb","5281fe511874192323309b55c04d193a53dd2201","bdab2c703f336e4dfece2832927c81918444e30f","88573c485b9afad3ad8b18e062b08d2235ee234e","193ea81b58f077c80decb9b3113848b6f6219420","fc786cae789a5937637f172b32b0a1a6bfadc061","f5f838c257aad5ad7817f8f176b4affac148b0ca","0790f65483656dc98b863f627e5b5e89f9e5d939","7e1205edf93aafd0ddd5deb773c89d16165093a0","1a7c500b2fd5f898ab271f8c81b1b45210bc6ae9","babcc7fc9009ab5b25b151e3c4a04c82d0c2d420","be57b9292c80b717a933f76a74488aef49de1486","6a8ba75fd2b1dfb298a27b075e7017324854093e","a2e55112c724e21dea12520372947590f7b1d40f","cc4e5315c85abb6dc12161e77a7f9b3629f736c0","19df59d60acffe86f77321528b9f6b703fe283dc","a1a51e4b8976d479caf91bbe46ae535a6ff9c8c4","1409a1a0b9a0f3a7be472fcd704dc825ae0cdaeb","196229955410826d98c4eb6c4523edaee9e912dc","da812cb899141d777b5a7ff791c9aaf3d7c8507e","37c5cef5587948c858b1a8714952e4684c16976f","0847b8f846051d7154f3396cc55d39d5b172ca98","9f683bfae99f59dc1462dbe79ebcc04291c50b15","98dd38d9586c39da89ecc35e791ee481beb98a87","24d7260731607c147128f12e83884a2d28dd85c0","dccd4fd3a9398018bd3735ad17dcb2e299b89316","f5eb9f605e78c2ec6a98c0f0c00bd5d8ca474409","902636bc465d2ea6e908a8a6037d755e52a7c25f","aa11a8f55d73531441859cefb88d64a653e24455","002636453844325188d5b322d8c5af8f483a2dbd","cf881a389ac7da4cb067dad1c763bb25d66f4b60","1920358d869ee4b687c61f56b317b57080b7f239","f2c90273f048e44f95d73c7e20f687468b5d9150","c39fce9e57551f9a3c141901ac95f42a768c140f","daf6d708b2e2ea0d7d246edd08d89693585d3d0a","f79c92709e7be559b75c77da6a03d9b082bb0abd","2b6c9884e6cdd36559604e1e8f300394544c6f0c","94bc440dbc7237513232f8c39918e495403fceaf","e63d4a8ce51b48c45d8ed6f2ef9abfe88f2e456b","b42afa5e649c243114fd5dbd990d730

This article is an exploration of queer pedagogy, its basis in queer theory, and its implications for educators. I begin with a brief explanation of queer theory, and a description of the relationship between queer theory and pedagogy. Then I address the question of why we need a queer pedagogy—that is, what does queer pedagogy offer that other pedagogies do not? Finally, I explore the implications of queer pedagogy for educational practice and review some examples of queer pedagogies in action.","inCitations":["fd7b9211bc3310ad3dd598dc5a5521599c740ecc","54e16cebbc3d19d81093c69cf39acd99ec457527","6ac39fb4ffe1fdb7447e3bc861b3f265c52d93e0","2fe1fd51abbee619ee1f2b01a95f5766a4e06be5","e1b3c1791b678a6ba4ec1bf2f8926f092e2738a2","b5fd9575485f345e9406693e45e48532e6ec0139","ad57b47e487f91dffe83a029022d54fc1d5fc1ac","193e56bb73cdd882ccbfa270f2cfb8a19c52e661","5aea7db49638d74c8e0ea8e5565c1a9fe9c6c8f9","52ccc0c76925fc9800dc96fbe1ef181b2d4c3f1c"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Queer (v.)
