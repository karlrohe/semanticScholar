In all, 43 species and 7 genera were identified from the weekly samples taken from a 1 x 1 x 1-m water column at sites I and II. The most abundant taxa were Cyanophyta (34.8%-37.8%) and Bacillariophyta (34.2%-34.3%), whilst Euglenophyta was the least abundant (4%-5.3%). The relationships (r) were significant (P < 0.05) and positive between water temperature and abundance of Euglenophyta, Secchi transparency, and Chlorophyta and Bacillariophyta, dissolved oxygen and Chlorophyta, dissolved chloride, and Cyanophyta and Euglenophyta, phosphate-phosphorus and Cyanophyta, and organic carbon and Bacillariophyta. In contrast, the relationships (r) were significant (P < 0.05), but inverse between water temperature and abundance of Bacillariophyta, Secchi transparency and Euglenophyta, dissolved chloride and Bacillariophyta, nitrate-nitrogen and Euglenophyta, and organic carbon and Euglenophyta. Furthermore, regression coefficients (b) indicated a significant (P < 0.05) positive relationship between Secchi transparency and overall NPP abundance, and a significant (P < 0.05) inverse relationship between silica and overall NPP abundance. The diversity indicated high values with peaks in species abundance in March, May, and September at site I, and in May, September, and November at site II. The seasonal abundance and frequency of occurrence for a few dominant species of Cyanophyta (e.g., Anabaena circinalis, Nostoc carneum, Oscillatoria formosa, Rivularia haematitis, and Spirula subsalsa), Chlorophyta (e.g., Spirogyra communis, Ulothrix tenerrima, and Zygnema pectinum), Euglenophyta (e.g., Euglena viridis), and Bacillariophyta (e.g., Cyclotella glomerata, Navicula capitata, Nitzschia acicularis, and Pinnularia major) in the surface water of this lake were 3.3%-5.5%, respectively.","inCitations":["a360f2218b2f7764ef707acfd41619952779c334","6fba35e58afc023d22d6092c13ed60652c86d618","ee73c5d23177328394680843628fd1dd7c1fcf30","fc53470fe5d7b43c6602048c1da31ff7e0cc8d24","b318bd81c2657365ad9ed583baa30481829cd9f5","15da35528ac6eb8389f836ae38db65c10c2cbd5e","b1f9f40be0025d9866fe2dc391b15c23c391649c","b12063b657c9668dd6e7b762b4abe273afe71e05","72b99ee99e3d8b2bb43d2925eac900e1590a5333","ba690e9a1ded22ac98732f3e830b73461559cb0a","949ab38f7f0e231a77e63671fb67536a4e15f633","f99bcc96058c8f12b8ce43caf50ab55f4c9c5e2c","a77b459191508188a8eb53d66352549b5ac9a3cf","64628d6b1de5f9fe74d183c28e480fa4c4e72a11","412ab20c00eddd5df5129cec268770c07d1563b9","dbf4b04b72ec8fbf6e4e189cb356ef76226dfcf9"],"pdfUrls":["http://journals.tubitak.gov.tr/botany/issues/bot-07-31-4/bot-31-4-2-0604-4.pdf"],"title":"Temporal Changes in Environmental Characteristics and Diversity of Net Phytoplankton in a Freshwater Lake","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

His skin was thin, dry, inelastic, and telan-giectatic. Biopsy revealed basal vacuolization, loss of rete pegs, atrophy of sweat glands, perivascular lymphocyte cuffing, and dense dermal collagenization. Because of the dermatologic similarity to PSS, we compared this patient to 38 PSS patients for evidence of systemic involvement. He had significant restrictive lung disease (VC and TLC 50% of predicted), cardiac conduction abnormalities (first degree heart block, right bundle branch block), and a pericardial effusion. Each of these abnormalities was found in 30-40% of the PSS group. Arteriolar intimal proliferation was seen in the heart and kidneys of our patient at autopsy. This finding has been noted in approximately 25% of PSS patients. Our patient had Raynaud's phenomenon as did 95% of the PSS group. He had a striking polyclonal elevation in serum IgG (4 gms/dl), an uncommon finding in PSS. 84% of the PSS patients showed esophageal dysmotility, but our patient did not have this abnormality. The clinical and pathologic similarities between this patient and PSS patients suggest that CGVHR and PSS may have a common pathogenesis. The use of animal models of graft versus host reaction may lead to an understanding of mechanisms responsible for both disease processes.","inCitations":["b2ee1e571947bd8b395e1a49272d60f15bd6b5e7"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"703 Progressive Systemic Sclerosis (pss)-like Syndrome following Bone Marrow Transplantation","doi":"10.1203/00006450-197804001-00708","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1203/00006450-197804001-00708","venue":"Pediatric Research"}

Using a discursive approach informed by Foucauldian, postcolonial and feminist theory, I unpack the ways in which they construct notions of ‘community’ (implicitly classed and racialised) and of ‘mental health in the community’, and explore the positioning of community as something ‘out there’, separate from the psychologist they are becoming. ‘The professional psychologist’ is represented in their talk as politically neutral and emotionally detached from the difficulties that the community faces. But there are also tensions in their accounts between this professional position and other positionings, as black or white women, as South African women. They talk about their work in the community as ‘tainted’ by social, political and emotional sensibilities. These tensions are enacted most potently in supervision, which is represented as a space in which they hide their activist and engaged psychological work, representing it as a sanitised and asocial psychological story, suitable for presentation within a professional psychological context","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Working with 'the community': student accounts of community based work in South Africa","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

However, siting large-scale solar projects is complex. In addition to the quality of the solar resource, solar developers must take into consideration many environmental, social, and economic factors when evaluating a potential site. This report describes a proof-of-concept, Web-based Geographical Information Systems (GIS) tool that evaluates multiple user-defined criteria in an optimization algorithm to inform discussions and decisions regarding the locations of utility-scale solar projects. Existing siting recommendations for large-scale solar projects from governmental and non-governmental organizations are not consistent with each other, are often not transparent in methods, and do not take into consideration the differing priorities of stakeholders. The siting assistance GIS tool we have developed improves upon the existing siting guidelines by being user-driven, transparent, interactive, capable of incorporating multiple criteria, and flexible. This work provides the foundation for a dynamic siting assistance tool that can greatly facilitate siting decisions among multiple stakeholders.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy14osti/61375.pdf","http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy14osti/61375.pdf"],"title":"Geospatial Optimization of Siting Large-Scale Solar Projects","doi":"10.2172/1126849","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.2172/1126849","venue":""}

Patients and methods Forty patients of both sexes, aged between 25 and 70 years; American Society of Anesthesiologists I–II, who were submitted to elective upper limb surgery by supraclavicular brachial plexus block were included in the present study. They were selected during the period from March 2016 to June 2017. The patients were divided randomly by sealed envelopes into two equal groups (n=20). Group I: 20 patients received 30 ml bupivacaine 0.25%. Group II: 20 patients received 30 ml bupivacaine 0.25% plus 100 μg dexmedetomidine. Results The duration was reported in group II 13.13±1.10 and 16.50±1.63 min for the onset of sensory and motor blocks, respectively, and in group I 14.90±1.18 and 18.63±1.12 min for the onset of sensory and motor blocks, respectively. There was significant decrease of median pain score in group II when compared with group I at 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24 h postoperatively. Conclusion Dexmedetomidine had significantly better postoperative analgesic effects, longer duration of sensory and motor blockade, and earlier onset of action.

Hippocrates can be thought of as a distributed transparency projector. The teacher can project transparencies on the screens of the students’ workstations and can emphasize or indicate regions of interest on them by using the graphical tools offered by Hippocrates. Immediate results of the use of Hippocrates are the fast updating of the personnel in remote areas and the upgrading of the quality of the services they offer.","inCitations":["e117d9e6392aa716879aa07c287648b6c5f80094","3ce2aeefe4f14fdb41cdc78d250e510aba6060ad","49462044b83bc45b83069289f41cff787ba52e97"],"pdfUrls":["http://ru6.cti.gr/ru6/system/files/publications/2777305.pdf","http://ru6.cti.gr/Publications/305.pdf","http://ru6.cti.gr/ru6/publications/2777305.pdf"],"title":"HIPPOCRATES : A Tool for Distance Education","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

The primary endpoint of overall survival was improved signifi cantly with the combination of nanoliposomal irinotecan plus fl uorouracil and folinic acid when compared with a control of fl uorouracil and folinic acid (6·1 months [95% CI 4·8–8·9] vs 4·2 months [3·3–5·3]; hazard ratio [HR] 0·67, 95% CI 0·49–0·92). Subgroup analyses consistently favoured the combination treatment, further supporting a robust treatment eff ect on overall survival. NAPOLI-1 is one of two phase 3 trials to be done in the second-line gemcitabine-resistant setting, the other study being CONKO-003. In that trial, second-line oxaliplatin plus fl uorouracil and folinic acid was assessed with fl uorouracil and folinic acid alone, and the primary endpoint of overall survival was also met. Metastatic pancreatic cancer has a dismal prognosis, with median survival of 4–6 months, and is associated with substantial morbidity. Because of its particular biology, pancreatic cancer is notoriously resistant to many types of chemotherapy. As a result, few treatment options currently exist for patients who have progressed on fi rst-line gemcitabine-based therapy and are willing and able to undergo further chemotherapy. Hence, a confi rmed survival benefi t in this population of patients with an unmet clinical need is especially exciting. Expanded analyses of NAPOLI-1 in the per-protocol population have further confi rmed the favourable eff ects of nanoliposomal irinotecan plus fl uorouracil and folinic acid on overall survival, compared with fl uorouracil and folinic acid. In patients who received an 80% or higher dose intensity of assigned treatment within the fi rst 6 weeks of the study, median overall survival was 8·9 months in those receiving the combination treatment versus 5·1 months in controls (HR 0·57, 95% CI 0·37–0·88), and this fi nding was similar across various subgroups. Of note, nanoliposomal irinotecan plus fl uorouracil and folinic acid also improved overall survival in the non-per-protocol population compared with controls (median 4·4 months vs 2·8 months; HR 0·56, 95% CI 0·33–0·97). Several secondary endpoints also recorded gains with nanoliposomal irinotecan plus fl uorouracil and folinic acid compared with control, including progressionfree survival (HR 0·56, 95% CI 0·41–0·75) and time to treatment failure (0·6, 0·45–0·78). A partial response or better was achieved by 19 (16%) of 117 patients assigned nanoliposomal irinotecan plus fl uorouracil and folinic acid, which is especially noteworthy in view of the second-line setting. Findings of phase 3 studies assessing use of standard irinotecan for treatment of pancreatic cancer have been disappointing. In an earlier study, addition of irinotecan to fi rst-line gemcitabine did not improve the primary endpoint of median survival compared with gemcitabine alone. Similar outcomes were seen in another trial, in which fi rst-line irinotecan plus gemcitabine was also compared with gemcitabine alone. Similar to albumin-bound paclitaxel for pancreatic cancer, reformulation of an existing drug can produce very interesting results. A key feature of nanoliposomal irinotecan administration is the resulting high intratumour concentration of its active metabolite SN-38 after administration, up to 5·6-fold higher than concentrations seen with the standard formulation irinotecan. High intratumour concentrations of a chemotherapeutic agent confer important benefi ts, with respect to both effi cacy and toxic eff ects. In NAPOLI-1, nanoliposomal irinotecan plus fl uorouracil and folinic acid had a fairly favourable safety profi le, including little neurotoxicity and a low Gemcitabine-resistant pancreatic cancer: a second-line option","inCitations":["8d6f216675dc3db78fc118661f42ac22db23954e","60b4440e411ec5eb4b11e960491615f009f785d9","e65ce74598bc3eab69d137f257a721377d4d6dbd","781156260e5d9d65486ad26374a1d8e7d8de4574","447a1f93e3c9a9abfc644d43c6ffc68532b6e24f"],"pdfUrls":["https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0140673615010351","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673615010351?dgcid=api_sd_search-api-endpoint"],"title":"Gemcitabine-resistant pancreatic cancer: a second-line option","doi":"10.1016/S0140-6736(15)01035-1","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736%2815%2901035-1","venue":"The Lancet"}

It is being cultivated in India for both as fresh vegetable and as a dried spice. It also has many medicinal properties and sometimes it is used as medicine. Gingerol, an oleoresin in ginger accounts for the aromatic and pungent characteristics, which makes it indispensible in the preparation of food, beverages and medicine (Sundari et al., 2013). It is cultivated in India, China, Japan, Nigeria and Indonesia. India is the largest producer and consumer of ginger contributing about 32.75% (305900 tons) of total world’s ginger production (Aggarwal, 2012). The consumption trend show that 50 % is utilised as green ginger, 30 % is converted into dry ginger and only 20 % used as seed materials. Major market is capture by dried ginger and exported due to its medical properties, which is used in the treatment of stomach ache, nausea, indigestion, asthma etc. (Sundari et al., 2013).","inCitations":["9f77d775b66bdec38245fc66e59fb7796935d72e"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Economic Analysis of Hybrid Solar Dryer for Ginger Drying","doi":"10.20546/ijcmas.2018.711.312","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.20546/ijcmas.2018.711.312","venue":""}

The expression level of P-glycoprotein on lymphocytes that is encoded by ABCB1 gene is considered to be one of the major causes of differences in intracellular CSA concentration. The clinical relevance of ABCB1 mRNA expression in peripheral blood was analyzed. We examined (i) the relationship between ABCB1 mRNA and the intracellular concentration of CSA in vitro, (ii) the change in long-term ABCB1 mRNA expression levels, and (iii) its association with acute rejection (AR) or cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivation in living-donor renal transplantation. A significantly negative correlation between ABCB1 mRNA expression and intracellular CSA concentration in vitro was obtained (p<0.05). ABCB1 mRNA expression was significantly reduced (55%) 1 week after transplantation (p<0.001) and returned to the pre-transplantation level after 1 year. Although the sample size may be too small to obtain a definitive conclusion, no association was observed between ABCB1 mRNA expression levels and AR or CMV reactivation.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Changes in ABCB1 mRNA Expression in Peripheral Blood Cells before and after Renal Transplantation.","doi":"10.1248/bpb.b15-00690","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1248/bpb.b15-00690","venue":"Biological & pharmaceutical bulletin"}

The two groups were similar in age (mean age=83.2 years), gender (80% female), and other casemix factors. Median time from admission to theatre was shorter in NSH, (21 vs. 44 h, p-value< 0.0001). Length of stay was significantly shorter at NSH (mean difference 4.4 days 95% CI 1.1–7.6 when adjusted for casemix factors). Significantly more NSH patients were transferred for rehabilitation than MMH patients (75% vs. 51%). At discharge, significantly more MMH patients (34% vs. 14%) were treated with alendronate. Of 126 patients admitted from home, 81% returned home, 4% went to rest homes, 13% to private hospitals and 2% died; differences between centres were not significant. Overall inpatient mortality was 3.9%. Conclusions: The orthogeriatric model of care at NSH was associated with a shorter overall length of stay, earlier transfer to the AT&R setting, and a higher proportion rehabilitated in AT&R.

Following an intravenous injection of the radioactive hormone, serum chromatograms (molecular exclusion chromatography) are characterized by three radioactive components. The first one, a rapidly formed high molecular weight heterogeneous fraction, involves the non-covalent interaction of the hormone with one or more circulating proteins. These high molecular weight complexes are cleared rather slowly from the circulation, relative to the non-associated hormone. A second component co-chromatographs with control hormone and is rapidly cleared from the circulation. These two fractions retain full biological activity judged by their ability to stimulate testosterone production in Leydig cell suspensions. A third component is observed in the circulation about 15 minutes after injection and was shown to represent tritiated amino acids. The lag period for the appearance of the labeled amino acids in the circulation correlates with the kinetics of hepatic and renal uptake and subsequent lysosomal catabolism of [3H]methylated-LH. The high molecular weight fraction may represent a physiologically important circulatory storage form for LH by conferring a relatively long circulatory half-life. This appears to be brought about mainly by reduced urinary excretion, presumably due to its high molecular weight.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Biotransformations of pituitary luteinizing hormone in serum and urine.

While glycogen synthase kinase 3-mediated and inositol depletion-dependent effects of lithium have been described extensively in literature, there is very little knowledge about the consequences of lithium treatment on vesicle recycling and neurotransmitter availability. In the present study we have examined acute and chronic effects of lithium on synaptic vesicle recycling using primary hippocampal neurons. We found that exocytosis of readily releasable pool vesicles as well as recycling pool vesicles was unaffected by acute and chronic treatment within the therapeutic range or at higher lithium concentrations. Consistent with this observation, we also noticed that the network activity and number of active synapses within the network were also not significantly altered after lithium treatment. Taken together, as lithium treatment does not affect synaptic vesicle release at even high concentrations, our data suggest that therapeutic effects of lithium in bipolar affective disorder are not directly related to presynaptic function.","inCitations":["ac80b63a91ddb7fb22e3734bdb96f0d396256f32","6ad9a56a3e7ea01d2dcdc046b353721a5bb43306","3cd24ab33bf8c6cccae5194f8a29b7468e677bb7","18a67698ca73093651804a7ce029788f13261140","619158e1912924d652a3119114fa5d457131168f"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/90355/1/LueKe_JNeuralTransm_2013_.pdf"],"title":"Basic presynaptic functions in hippocampal neurons are not affected by acute or chronic lithium treatment","doi":"10.1007/s00702-013-1087-9","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00702-013-1087-9","venue":"Journal of Neural Transmission"}

By transmission electron microscopy and X-ray powder diffraction, it is shown that the substitution of Rh for Co takes place at the two cobalt sites of the structure but for the low enough Rh contents, this substitution is made preferentially at the level of the CdI{sub 2}-like layer. Thus, a generic formula [Pb{sub 0.7}(Co{sub 0.4-z}Rh{sub z})Sr{sub 1.9}O{sub 3}]{sup RS}[Co{sub 1-y}Rh{sub y}O{sub 2}]{sub b1/b2} (0=<y=<0.5 and 0=<z=<0.3) can be proposed for this new family of misfit phase. As observed for the pure misfit cobaltite, the thermoelectric power is also very large, close to +140{mu}V/K at room temperature. The Rh cation can adopt a mixed valency Rh{sup 3+}/Rh{sup 4+} (4d{sup 6}/4d{sup 5}) with low spin states t{sub 2g}{sup 6}/t{sub 2g}{sup 5} equivalent to the ones of low spin Co{sup 3+}/Co{sup 4+} (3d{sup 6}/3d{sup 5}). The large thermopower observed in the Rh substituted compounds is therefore a direct proof that the coexistence of low spin states t{sub 2g}{sup 6}/t{sub 2g}{sup 5} contributes to the thermoelectric power enhancement in these oxides.","inCitations":["cfac729a2e99147dce69381ede70e633b5c43da9","96dc90091345b82fd3e2095f171950e009c38e0c"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Partial substitution of rhodium for cobalt in the misfit [Pb0.7Co0.4Sr1.9O3]RS[CoO2]1.8 oxide","doi":"10.1016/j.jssc.2004.11.021","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jssc.2004.11.021","venue":""}

Compared to secondary access LSA offers a more attractive case for long term investments. The contribution in this paper is that we look into how LSA can be used by different types of actors. The outcome depends heavily on what type of actor that makes use of the spectrum using LSA. Based on cost structure analysis (leading to required investments) and analysis of availability of the basic spectrum resource we can identify clear differences of the commercial usability of spectrum awarded using LSA, all depending on what actors that make use of the LSA contract. Cases where new actors need to invest a lot in new infrastructure do not that look that promising. We cannot identify a separate LSA business case that is feasible from a business perspective (where the key resource for the operator is spectrum awarded using LSA). Service availability that cannot be guaranteed due to LSA type of spectrum being the only resource seems risky, especially when combined with high investments. However this applies only for outdoor deployment. For deployment of a new indoor network the situation is different. The cost structure is the same no matter if a new or existing actor deploys the networks. In addition, a multitude of spectrum bands and spectrum access options exist indoor so the service provisioning will be less vulnerable if some part of spectrum is not available some period of time.","inCitations":["95fe64b36610d35712d8ccf8a98d117e02bddbcb","d9d6693f8153c115a329265afd182a2919bdcf37"],"pdfUrls":["https://www.metis2020.com/wp-content/uploads/publications/ITS_2013_Markendahl_etal_BusinessModelsForUseOfLicensedSharedAccessOfSpectrum.pdf"],"title":"Business models and Investment options for use of Licensed Shared Access of Spectrum","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Only a handful of ROS1-positive (ROS1+) cancer models exist to use in research and developing new treatments. Few research facilities encounter ROS1+ patients–the incidence of ROS1+ cancer is only 1% to 2% in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and ROS1 testing is rarely done in other cancers. To address this, a group of ROS1+ patients and caregivers (“the ROS1ders\") collaborated with advocacy organizations, researchers and industry to form the Global ROS1 Initiative. Methods: The ROS1ders and partners informed patients, caregivers, and clinicians of the initiative through social media, patient blogs, websites, distribution of fliers in several languages at cancer conferences, and contacts with their clinicians. The ROS1der online community shared ROS1+ information about treatment options and side effects, expert clinicians, clinical trials, research and general support. An epidemiologic survey captured data about ROS1 patient histories and treatments. When a member in the ROS1der community shared news of an upcoming surgery, biopsy or thoracentesis, a ROS1der leader told them of an opportunity to donate excess fresh specimens to create cancer models. Tumor samples and resulting cell lines underwent drug testing and sequencing for mechanisms of resistance. Results: The ROS1ders members include 166 patients (more than twice the largest ROS1 clinical trial cohort to date) from 16 countries representing 6 types of ROS1+ cancer. Four attempted fresh specimen donations resulted in 2 new ROS1+ cells lines, CUTO27 (CD74-ROS1) and CUTO28 (TPM3-ROS1). These cell lines have already been distributed to academic and industry partners to increase the value of these rare resources. The ROS1ders shared study results within their online group. The Initiative is now working to continue the longitudinal epidemiologic survey and create clinical studies that will generate ROS1+ cell lines and/or patient-derived xenograft (PDX) mouse models. We will conduct genomic analysis of the models to determine the presence of resistance mutations as well as ROS1 pairing partner genes. The resultant renewable tissue resources of PDX models and cell lines, when linked to the clinically annotated genomic database, will be broadly shared to help clinical and translational research understand mechanisms of response and resistance to therapies, and assist in drug development. Conclusions: This project demonstrates that partnerships between patient-caregiver groups, advocacy groups, researchers and industry, combined with social media outreach, can increase the available oncogene-driven patient data, specimens, and cancer models in small, geographically distributed patient populations.

Computations have been carried out for typical cases for both E_{\\theta} and E_{\\phi} components in the principal planes. The second part presents the experimental results.

They consist of a single named species, Trichoplax adhaerens and have roughly six morphologically distinct cell types. With a sequenced genome, a limited number of cell-types and a simple flattened morphology, Trichoplax is an ideal model organism to understand cellular dynamics and tissue patterning in the first animals. Using new approaches for identification of gene expression patterns this research looks at the relationship of Chordin/TgfB signaling and the axial patterning system of Placozoa. Our results suggest that placozoans have an oral-aboral axis similar to cnidarians and that the parahoxozoan ancestor (common ancestor of Placozoa and Cnidaria) was likely radially symmetric.","inCitations":["ab6bea7b8098c82dcc15e8bc2c770168924f079b"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"The radial expression of dorsal-ventral patterning genes in placozoans, Trichoplax adhaerens, argues for an oral-aboral axis","doi":"10.1101/345777","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1101/345777","venue":""}

In this paper, the effect of fully nonlinear Taylor-Gortler vortices on the growth of small-amplitude Tollmien-Schlichting waves is investigated. The basic state considered is the fully developed flow between concentric cylinders driven by an azimuthal pressure gradient. It is hoped that an investigation of this problem will shed light on the more complicated external-boundary-layer problem where again both modes of instability exist in the presence of concave curvature. The type of Tollmien-Schlichting waves considered have the asymptotic structure of lower-branch modes of plane Poiseuille flow. Whilst instabilities at lower Reynolds number are possible, the former modes are simpler to analyse and more relevant to the boundary-layer problem. The effect of fully nonlinear Taylor-Gortler vortices on both two-dimensional and three-dimensional waves is determined. It is shown that, whilst the maximum growth as a function of frequency is not greatly affected, there is a large destabilizing effect over a large range of frequencies.","inCitations":["1da86bcaf7c7e77ee451be3e1547f3f7db01524a","143807ec86a78f9f9f1ab93891450e4e15451c55","433f4aff815b3141572aab7d78df8fa1ccd513f8"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"On the secondary instability of Taylor-Görtler vortices to Tollmien-Schlichting waves in fully developed flows","doi":"10.1017/S0022112088000229","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1017/S0022112088000229","venue":""}

Namun, Implementasi \nkebijakan pendidikan gratis ini banyak menimbulkan permasalahan baik dari pihak \npelaksana di tingkat sekolah, hingga persepsi yang negatif dimata masyarakat karena \nbanyak munculnya masalah pungutan untuk sumbangan. Dengan melihat Pro dan kontra \nadanya kebijakan pendidikan gratis di masyarakat sedikit banyak akan memberikan \npemahaman dan persepsi yang berbeda-beda di masyarakat. Untuk itu, peneliti merasa \ntertarik melakukan penelitian mengenai Persepsi Orangtua Siswa Dalam Implementasi \nKebijakan Pendidikan Gratis Di Kota Bengkulu. Rumusan masalah adalah \nbagaimanakah persepsi Orangtua siswa dalam implementasi kebijakan pendidikan gratis \ndi Kota Bengkulu dengan Studi Kasus SMAN 3 Kota Bengkulu. Tujuan penelitian ini \nadalah untuk mengetahui persepsi Orangtua siswa dalam Implementasi Kebijakan \nPendidikan Gratis Di Kota Bengkulu. Jenis penelitian ini adalah penelitian kualitatif \ndeskriptif. Penentuan informan menggunakan teknik snowball sampling. Fokus \npenelitian yang digunakan ada 6 item yaitu penilaian orangtua siswa terhadap sosialisasi \nkebijakan, penilaian orangtua siswa terhadap pelaksanaan pembebasan biaya pendidikan \ndi sekolah, pendapat orangtua siswa tentang pembebasan biaya pendidikan, pendapat \norangtua siswa mengenai pengadaan pakaian seragam, buku dan LKS dikelola oleh \nPihak Sekolah, penilaian orangtua siswa tentang dampak/manfaat dari kebijakan \npendidikan gratis serta sikap orangtua siswa terhadap kebijakan pendidikan gratis. Dari \nhasil penelitian diketahui bahwa persepsi orangtua siswa dalam implementasi kebijakan \npendidikan gratis adalah positif meskipun masih ada 2 variabel yang dinilai negatif yaitu \npenilaian negatif terhadap sosialisasi kebijakan pendidikan gratis, dan penilaian negatif \npelaksanaan pembebasan biaya pendidikan di sekolah karena dinilai belum dapat \ndilakukan secara maksimal dengan alasan masih adanya pungutan. Persepsi positif yang \ndiberikan oleh orangtua siswa terhadap implementasi kebijakan pendidikan gratis \nmeliputi, Pendapat positif terhadap pembebasan biaya pendidikan,Pendapat positif \nmengenai pengadaan pakaian seragam, buku dan LKS dikelola pihak Sekolah, Penilaian \npositif terhadap dampak/manfaat kebijakan pendidikan gratis, Sikap yang positif \nterhadap kebijakan pendidikan gratis itu sendiri karena dipandang tujuan kebijakan itu \nsendiri serta demi kepentingan dan kemajuan pendidikan di Kota Bengkulu.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Persepsi Orangtua Siswa Dalamimplementasi Kebijakan Pendidikan Gratisdi Kota Bengkulu","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Les maladies de CMT reliees aux mutations du gene de la periaxine (PRX) sont rares et sont caracterisees par une demyelinisation majeure restreinte aux nerfs peripheriques. A la suite de la decouverte d’une grande frequence d’une mutation particuliere de la periaxine a l’Ile de La Reunion (E1085fsX4 homozygote), nous avons examine tous les patients francais connus comme porteurs de mutation du gene de la periaxine , soit 24 dont 18 issus de l’Ile de La Reunion (6 familles et 10 cas sporadiques). Les six autres patients sont originaires de la Metropole et sont issus de deux familles comportant deux sujets atteints et deux autres cas sporadiques. On denombre 17 femmes et sept hommes. La marche est acquise avec retard, en moyenne a 3,4 ± 1,6 ans. Un patient n’a jamais acquis la marche. L’index CMTNS (Charcot Marie Tooth Neuropathy Score) est en moyenne a 24,5 ± 8,1. Sept patients ont perdu la marche en moyenne vers 24 ± 22 ans. D’autres symptomes sont notes : une scoliose majeure presente au dela de 12 ans, parfois compliquee d’un syndrome respiratoire restrictif, une deformation des pieds, d’un strabisme, d’un glaucome et d’une myopie. Lorsque les vitesses de conduction sont enregistrables, il existe un ralentissement majeur de la vitesse de conduction motrice du nerf median ( periaxine doit etre envisagee chez les patients presentant une neuropathie demyelinisante severe de debut infantile associee a une scoliose. Le pronostic fonctionnel est pejoratif etant donne que 29 % des patients sont en fauteuil roulant et presentent une insuffisance respiratoire restrictive.

Diagnosis concordance was 52.5% and 53% for Jorhat and Halwara for VTC vs S and F, while it was 75% and 25% for Jaisalmer and Naliya. For VTC vs FTF, the concordance improved to 60.66% and for S and F vs FTF it improved to 91.8%. Concordance was better for localized lesions than for generalized lesions especially of the papulosquamous group of disorders. Another reason for the discordance with VTC was poor resolution of cameras at the peripheral units.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nTeledermatology is useful for patient care in the absence of local specialist cover and the patients have to travel long distances resulting in loss of manhours. However, better camera resolution at peripheral centres will result in greater concordance.","inCitations":["5ec00d23ba87377c112714a20d44f0b48df9e2de","398e6b5afc600bd7ddcb09e89fa4504b310bb78a","6a71b50b2522fd4d0784601cc5786cce04bce8fa","d0f1df08f3f6c65204d7711de7d3ceaed450b0e5"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Teledermatology in Air Force: Our Experience.","doi":"10.1016/S0377-1237(09)80096-8","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/S0377-1237%2809%2980096-8","venue":"Medical journal, Armed Forces India"}

We use two different multi-section design variants, with the absorber section placed either in the center or at the end of the ridge. Profiting from the very low lateral conductivity in the p-type GaN top contact layer, we implement the multi-section concept just by etching off small sections of the top metalization on the ridge. The physical mechanism underlying short pulse generation within such system, operating in the 400 - 435nm wavelength range, strongly depends both on the reverse bias applied to the absorber and the forward current in the gain section. Varying the applied reverse bias affects both the absorption and the carrier lifetime in the absorber section through changes in the QW internal field. In consequence we can distinguish between different modes of operation. For moderately long carrier lifetimes the absorber stabilizes relaxation oscillations in the GHz frequency range and self-pulsation occurs, of relatively long duration. With increasing reverse bias, and thus decreasing carrier lifetime, we observe a transition to self-Q-switching. Finally, at large enough negative bias, the carrier life time in the absorber is so short that the laser diode operates in a passive self-mode-locking regime with a repetition rate of 87 GHz and pulse duration of 2 ps for a cavity length of 540 μm.","inCitations":["db1eb338ff8f6d7b22f054d0536183d2e44b9535","8074ac7ee37d652277ff58692fec9d10ad35e0ea"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Picosecond pulse generation in monolithic GaN-based multi-section laser diodes","doi":"10.1117/12.2001774","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1117/12.2001774","venue":"Photonics West - Optoelectronic Materials and Devices"}

Method: A total of 120 Patients who were diagnosed as a case of vit-A deficiency (any sign or symptoms of VAD), were included in this cross sectional study. An assessment of present complaints, detailed clinical history, BMI was recorded. Ophthalmological check up as external examination of the eyes, visual acuity, torch light examination, slit lamp examination, Fluorescein eye staining, Schirmer's test, refraction, direct ophthalmoscopy, was done. Results: In this study, the male female ratio was 1:1.2. Vit-A deficiency was most commonly observed in children with 5-9 years of age group, who belongs to poor socio-economic, rural and illiterate family background. Incompletely immunized and underweight children were more susceptible to VAD. Conclusion: Vitamin A deficiency remains widely prevalent in the developing world. India is currently at a stage when universal vitamin A supplementation must immediately transit to a targeted supplementation programme","inCitations":["5a07bb95f47ee2b45932219a6c4a1a3649ed3136"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.iosrjournals.org/iosr-jdms/papers/Vol18-issue12/Series-8/A1812080105.pdf"],"title":"Ocular Manifestations of Vitamin A Deficiency in Bundelkhand Region","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

This way the formerly established advantages of very high robustness and massive parallelism become available for this practically very important case. The approach is thus very suitable as a basis for the construction of highly parallel computers for the solution of hydrodynamic problems solving viscous fluids.<<ETX>>","inCitations":["9d7afcfb93aaf2226d09ba998aa51805544c182b","11d4c32a4593cf531ae0d224e5fffa6d49cf795f","99d2cc6bde32b9d191e860c8817cd5e7c0634674","469cdd759105cec41c73da5247e7f05957bf4af6","af4ef0e3e9d60c18d708d2204c261870a5048db4","0e7efb6385f7a3fb89e5c738bdc5085c45e2f654","86554a9f340f8c08b9c7e2388d328338d93fd144"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Discrete passive modelling of viscous fluids","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.1992.230363","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.1992.230363","venue":"[Proceedings] 1992 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems"}

These are important tools to base drugs approval, clinical protocols and guidelines formulation and for decision-making. However, this traditional technique only partially yield information that clinicians, patients and policy-makers need to make informed decisions, since it usually compares only two interventions at the time. In the market, regardless the clinical condition under evaluation, usually many interventions are available and few of them have been studied in head-to-head studies. This scenario precludes conclusions to be drawn from comparisons of all interventions profile (e.g. efficacy and safety). The recent development and introduction of a new technique - usually referred as network meta-analysis, indirect meta-analysis, multiple or mixed treatment comparisons - has allowed the estimation of metrics for all possible comparisons in the same model, simultaneously gathering direct and indirect evidence. Over the last years this statistical tool has matured as technique with models available for all types of raw data, producing different pooled effect measures, using both Frequentist and Bayesian frameworks, with different software packages. However, the conduction, report and interpretation of network meta-analysis still poses multiple challenges that should be carefully considered, especially because this technique inherits all assumptions from pairwise meta-analysis but with increased complexity. Thus, we aim to provide a basic explanation of network meta-analysis conduction, highlighting its risks and benefits for evidence-based practice, including information on statistical methods evolution, assumptions and steps for performing the analysis.","inCitations":["d4f4951fc5fecc2325afe725e8fb588447d27c06","0c6238a6c65e9ea2b2458fd19d32766a4edba5c5","64e6f4fe01844b04382639fd148031dc6711bed5","7d9f64a6ef3a7e9542be13e25213d44c9fbdbdfe","8c58e6ea603b80947a8bb58bdd8dee0413f88acd","36c6f98ae97a89458c26cdc807edd2308d5da8c1","1b2388e309241730a45181ec49fc79575d987930","f13731f956ff84216dabd19412ac5c5df00b332a","05be51e12fddcfae58131c089c3d13714c876d39","c6403deec0373133cd9b0feaf9af5f883dcb7aaf","a2180886601466067c6284d3132e53ace46ff813","1be0b9d6dbd53e882759d6770d39cd1b56abdd2f","3d9ed22eff7009b91b1f36b44b3b93703cd11262","a5fa556df7ab6bede8963522cd131fcdd75ecd22","1cf6f4f5dd1af9bb427e88d0a57154166a847b94","29a739bd91be64743e6413d5181ab4d446faa936","d3ae9a7e677c52b045d84377aa87c8c29fa47126","f219c64682cef4d7aac8107217220757ca5c67e1","19a3d6aba47e1ab98d708228855881b52c517dd3","3a75c0f2525731cb2bd0d78a22d05e2a0e7878ea","83449036e33cb5678d8f5e91d1f210bda8205ab8","25ff7724dcf1d7005e77bc82b39c4ccad448ee15","492884dcb57c8330b965b9eba98160c09319e434","19fc291e5a1f741e4a614cc6a9bd4eec85fc2548","1c465e3d571f29184add406d31f6a8855c33f548","5916a7cdabaf45cb3d02d444cf8f57a672f0b716","3bd90d9b89944f624ab9986905dcad51c9626cb5","7c3fcf7a6b64414ba6ca6fe14b5477c599c4278a","489dac8644833bf5fb4db28ea14a8309729c65c6","03e716cdad88619835f3ecdf842bbee8cda703f7","d2144070f6a6744d0d0deb9e431dbb6ab7976248","ff1052769d234ab8e0ea88d1e97b9b2af8f86a5e","20cd5f84f6822c246773fd64aead11854edb9db7","b52fd4494128b0fd1a811f766ae311f274d07970","44298399c5e23bed159f0654dd7a01720fc1e3d2","759862eb46a1eea30bd8168b551eafdbd2a1630f","d00e9bb714ef6725742b08f8fdc75821a5936584","75e37670840b696f445b0c80f730b3279a5d1c73","e0b37b60c45a18526d69e18d3af93593a4dcbad7","2b2f8b60bf74bc1c7bd92096b2347cc7562aee7a","2275200cc84b9d53a694667735a57421b027fb1c","1e9f6039fde387253321d038b763affabc109469","210ebd2d37ffde9ab4f5e6881e304b97fc3577f9","1a6091b5c5891ed7609956d63e01c6ae9cf264d0","fd3e3dd1b3c5933fc2c4ef76ff45e79cd8372225"],"pdfUrls":["http://scielo.isciii.es/pdf/pharmacy/v15n1/1885-642X-pharmacy-15-01-00943.pdf"],"title":"Network meta-analysis: a technique to gather evidence from direct and indirect comparisons","doi":"10.18549/PharmPract.2017.01.943","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.18549/PharmPract.2017.01.943","venue":"Pharmacy practice"}

Leukemic promyelocytes have the unique ability to undergo differentiation after exposure to retinoic acid and both differentiation and apoptosis after exposure to arsenic trioxide (As 2 O 3 , ATO). Emerging evidence has implicated Src family kinases (SFKs) as regulators of proliferation and survival of myeloid lineage cells. Recent studies showed that inhibition of SFKs resulted in enhancement of retinoic acid-induced myeloid differentiation. In this study, we demonstrated that the SFK inhibitor PP2 enhanced the differentiation of NB4 cells when combined with ATO as well when combined with as all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) and the difference in the retinoic acid-induced gene expression between the cells treated with PP2 in combination with ATRA and the cells treated with PP2 in combination with ATO. SFK inhibitor PP2 significantly enhanced ATRA- or ATO-induced differentiation of NB4 cells. The synergistic effect was significantly stronger when PP2 was combined with ATRA than when PP2 was combined with ATO. Flow cytometric analysis demonstrated a significant increase in CD11b-positive granulocytes up to 60.73% and 31.58%, respectively. These results were confirmed by morphologic analysis using Wright stain and NBT staining. These effects were not related to apoptosis. Annexin-V-fluorescein staining revealed that PP2 combined with ATRA or PP2 combined with ATO did not induce apoptosis in NB4 cells. Retinoic acid-induced gene expression was different in both groups. ICAM-1 expression was significantly increased in the cells treated with PP2 in combination with ATRA whereas cathepsin D expression was significantly increased in the cells treated with PP2 in combination with ATO. These findings suggested that the synergistic effect of SFK inhibitor PP2 in combination with ATRA was significantly stronger than that of PP2 in combination with ATO on NB4 myeloid leukemia cell differentiation and this difference was related to the disparate activation of retinoic acid-induced genes. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Src Family Kinase Inhibitor PP2 Has Different Effects On ATRA or Arsenic Trioxide-Induced Differentiation of Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia Cell Line","doi":"10.1182/blood.v120.21.4800.4800","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1182/blood.v120.21.4800.4800","venue":""}

Males, however, alter their behavior in the absence of parturition, postpartum ovulation and lactation, and therefore do not experience the hormone dynamics associated with such conditions. Paternal males might nevertheless use the same hormones to activate pre-existing maternal behavior pathways in the brain. Positive and inverse associations between prolactin, sex steroids (estradiol, testosterone, progesterone), glucocorticoids, oxytocin and vasopressin and paternal behavior are reviewed. Across biparental rodents (Phodopus campbelli, Peromyscus californicus, Microtus ochrogaster, and Meriones unguiculatus), as well as non-human primates and men, hormone-behavior associations are broadly supported. However, experimental manipulations (largely restricted to P. campbelli) suggest that the co-variation of hormones and paternal behavior is not causal in paternal behavior. Perhaps the hormone-behavior associations shared by P. campbelli and other paternal males are important for other challenges at the same time as fatherhood (e.g., mating during the postpartum estrus). On the other hand, each paternal species might, instead, have unique neuroendocrine pathways to parental behavior. In the latter case, future comparisons might reveal extraordinary plasticity in how the brain forms social bonds and alters behavior in family groups.","inCitations":["5a96e680ca07d5f338cefb413e03dd359537075c","cabd190d789bf0a22eaa77a3fc6bf8d7850a1397","d1eae5ed759c40746677637ce15b12f095814c2b","31710cbb3bcd0910fe0382c651cbd7cd0f7a759d","b75aef63fe0ac7400d23be7c556c972f5434551c","67e67ccc9f2b3a3963cf84098691034a61f3926f","a5ceacb732e0bd8bf4ad61f7b6bb51da1764defb","8f76f32dabc51dd5787c42c223bf89e15064b8fa","c44e2a66b5302b53fc86eb5023ba937729451660","a6c475c032b74995baebdfcfb5f874b3cd537468","3dabbcc94808ddda753c63bd267253e358466acb","13c195d997bfa794946336e5e901f2bd38fbaa18","bf049583ee3c5201816605a4b058a9b461fb7921","a650e7a4c9b0a92c9c526f604dd36d76c21ee101","60fd6fbe10cc9e800ad5d6e05558fcc4fb9804dc","f410ea5d92e207dea38870ed637a48be79fa2378","3b4350e807f767ce524bc57e85bac0dafbd41ddb","ce2c20d0869c00ce94dba05628027052cd3b327a","55994e165f1b08217d9f9c195d580d0d89015f37","27c235902b374ee97e7344512c8be1457c105bf8","366c7cd6cc43e246a276d1e220fdc83cbafccfc2","6e962becc491648aaf031a0d5e3b56a782c1bba9","9bd0e8ce4c2996bcd1febf6fc66c0ce535667058","266cad17f065a2dd6a6f17de04c334404b4126fa","02f5e75c423eaf8aa595ae9aa3c12d502e234288","9c35fe15c116cabc91d08c1557af6e3fcb025f8b","1c5d7d1540779b6c57a8d03650d913ff7d1d8c8b","89e6035cc4112541c214b1ab8f24ff1a143a62a1","d15f59dfbf5d994105d0c83fa8f7b9572bc68ec9","d80bef93b8aaee0ee1342566f95659c2e7f214d7","6454527e764713495819843622274c246e76a704","2389c8786398fe908cfbf75ee3846113bba38320","f73a327e33e42b066e4978183184f54aed94921b","05c4f917e88ea35e31936dd92e057bae78b9b922","ede3971ea6019da7022e2ce3078359e2f9713861","53f218738c1b6b2ff8ab17baf0db637bdb263212","87454da8989da01c6719d2ed84b9e2a76f1d6232","620086bdf649f780a5980d2f7d5937cac4f1a7e7","bfc51cd5df452b165181ea13df5b345ab3777d6c","e0838809a580d9efae1dd70d8a2799b88b145f40","7f30fce7d8eba0a2637b49029c5f161d1f0f78a2","24585cce5002de5a162d9a22e8d6887c9d99c382","19eb4a02de0d9eb3a79129698f6508b21bcc3806","663ae7ce1181f6595073d8510ef7dfd7c7bbd59a","fc4562cdcc24cc01e4f42a3a2c590f746fd55b4f","829afbdb20d781d995dae4803b2d00195fd04515","e5eece268dfba829098f253f8fcfd5512ee9a767","0379f015b6cd7596a22ba0bfd8448becba8cc737","914dfb64218a6f043512ad1ce37a6608cdb78024","5c5717c37b5b898f9ee48ab6d20587e4fd69b2dd","9929fa08190827735bdd07857f4bf6a927ec4fcb","d84d8bdb6ccf7cee5ea0f60d3194070cba638abf","a05d7b6eba75fed9ca4eaf6420d964b12023f4e5","e984d1ce2e079e3fb47ce190ce3d48d7fce76a7e","7b1490737545246d119bd03f45d637376da4d40f","301ca675e41e42d65c09f7cad571ad90a75c2d1f","a0c48520de0b500fd1f8a06f6252492f6ecdb144","4bd05a8879423b2334055c8b27475505dc04fb7b","d68367d57a750aa25a1edecca27e1cc85c2128a0","29010584941881709623c1e5977a848e1e5ed4bc","7ff8cf68cd0da06ad72d372f6980307b2d51aafb","b4f542e88f6b58d077e4a41cb9690a8b4ec074f7","0b9b7b603178f02400f946b775d81483a0fa093d","203c77de420e5d7de9b905e642aa0b64040a5643","5e4fdedd15c12c094cec87cd5abe74b7e9f09fb6","4477d56741c6a797f1cb624858d7a4e5e7bbecbe","d4889602a4f21e562a15f8bb0ae86680e3f94e72","40f169fcb29d475a7128b8092083aeaaff91d08e","5c7979925ca29a3447c37f64007d245f2c523c2c","8e9c3031109f10b20775abde9acec11fc2fe8c37","dcc80d477e1195f179b0e6a670ce7d7ede5c8510","1bfbecfabe67a66a5550ddd25a62c436c1abe731","7519803c693398671c7046f26ff8b4454abda2f3","5d9051e5b0e2e758999e1fd7e153d645cd022881","133f5060f9226e1751ee045240f8f73dc6addd51","2ffe5ed739b1ea0ccc53278b5f079bf8c58b99d1","160489e80206e66de69974b6aad4b778e4285f39","c629b3371161d6e64a94f8e1db63ce552abab0c1","5b850d59d28e51668022c305d72d9e27a3115057","03488ec108b16aab43290cebc49ef645711f2a70","eb7f93e54728dea0303f6bdb3614629dfca0c443","5a62d3ea0a67929e215ee147c62473f7a4737bb4","f7c9ad65e8145143d18315aaf07a67140a2ada31","c81ac3bc6a3a42275e17fe128a4694dc66911d04","f8abd8d5b0de26872b1fb75563fd48f966b5ba3c","58c4cc478f1f2998f06f2b7b14a48e5d3a90ae0e","3b894fb4f7fa20c598736c0d9fbfc84dd262de78","b9c067aae7d4c804dd1f9572e2f2c4c078fa1444","a529733443599009ace34596a56ff3e019e976a5"],"pdfUrls":["https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0018506X07000645","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0018506X07000645?dgcid=api_sd_search-api-endpoint"],"title":"Paternal care in rodents: Weakening support for hormonal regulation of the transition to behavioral fatherhood in rodent animal models of biparental care","doi":"10.1016/j.yhbeh.2007.03.018","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.yhbeh.2007.03.018","venue":"Hormones and Behavior"}

Neurophysiological studies (e.g. Experimental Brain Research 65 (1986) 38) show that face-selective neurons in the superior temporal sulcus (STS) are remarkably size-invariant in their responses. If the site of adaptation underlying the FDAE is the homologous neuron population in human vision, then the FDAE should also be highly tolerant to changes in size between adapting and test faces. Here, we test this prediction. Observers were adapted to distorted upright/inverted faces of three different sizes (3.3 degrees x 3.7 degrees, 6.6 degrees x 7.5 degrees, and 13.1 degrees x 14.8 degrees ). For adapting faces of all three sizes, observers adjusted test faces of all three sizes until they appeared normal. Significant FDAEs were observed in all conditions. For both upright and inverted faces, FDAEs were approximately twice as strong when adapting and test faces were the same size than when they differed by even a single octave in size. The magnitudes of FDAEs were comparable for upright and inverted faces. The larger FDAEs for same-size adapting and test faces suggest that part of the FDAE derives from a neuron population with narrow size-tuning. However, the significant FDAEs obtained for adapting and test images differing by two octaves implicate a different neuron population with broad size-tuning, possibly the human homolog of the face-selective neuron population in monkey
