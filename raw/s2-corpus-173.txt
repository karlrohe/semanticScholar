Calculations were made in a three region reference man phantom described in Combinatorial Geometry. Calculations were performed using cross sections and KERMA factors from the 37 neutron-21 gamma ray group DNA Few Group Library. KERMA factors used in the calculation of dose were those for the constituents of active marrow alone for neutron dose and active marrow plus trabecular bone constituents for photon dose. Dose deposition (or response) functions (rad (marrow) per unit incident radiation fluence) are tabulated in energy differential and angle integral and differential form for gamma ray dose from incident gamma rays and for neutron and gamma ray dose from incident neutrons. Tabulations are for eight skeletal regions and for reference man. The dose deposition factors have been used to determine marrow dose from hypothetical contemporary weapon types and for Little Boy and Fat Man.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Radiation Dose Deposition in the Active Marrow of Reference Man.","doi":"10.21236/ada084030","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.21236/ada084030","venue":""}

An open-chain variation of the SB, that positions the participant in an inclined side-lying posture, may be useful for those who report shoulder pain or fatigue as the reason for terminating the closed-chain SB. Low back loading demands of the open- and closed-chain variations should be matched to facilitate comparison of SB endurance measures.\n\n\nPurpose\nTo quantify the low back reaction moments during the open- and closed-chain SB and determine the appropriate open-chain angle of inclination that matches the lateral bend moment magnitude of the closed-chain SB.\n\n\nStudy Design\nObservational cohort.\n\n\nMethods\nUpper body and trunk postural data were obtained during the closed-chain SB and during the open-chain SB at each of four inclination angles from a group of eight healthy male adults. Ground reaction force (GRF) data were also collected during the closed-chain SB. Low back reaction moments were calculated using a static 'top-down' linked segment model in both SB variations. Latent growth modeling was used to determine the angle of inclination in the open-chain SB that produced a low back lateral bend moment that matched the closed-chain SB. Sensitivity of the matching open-chain inclination angle was evaluated by rotating the measured GRF vector from the closed-chain SB by five degrees clockwise and counter-clockwise in the frontal plane.\n\n\nResults\nThe open-chain inclination angle that best matched the loading demands of the closed-chain SB was 38 ± 12 degrees. Clockwise rotation of the measured GRF in the closed-chain SB increased the matching inclination angle to 56 ± 17 degrees. Counter-clockwise rotation reduced the matching inclination angle to 17 ± 11 degrees. Secondary descriptive analysis of spine posture and off-axis low back moments revealed biomechanically relevant differences between SB positions.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe average open-chain SB angle of inclination that matched the closed-chain SB approximated the 45-degree recommendation offered in the literature. Differences in spine posture and off-axis low back reaction moments, and the potential impact on holding times, should be considered if using the open-chain SB.\n\n\nLevel of Evidence\n2b.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Biomechanical Matching of Low Back External Demands during the Open- and Closed-chain Side Bridge.","doi":"10.26603/ijspt20200053","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.26603/ijspt20200053","venue":"International journal of sports physical therapy"}

In routine serological diagnosis of the disease, after screening with Rose Bengal test, the positive samples are studied with standart tube agglutination (STA) test with serial dilutions. However false negative results can be seen in STA test due to the existence of blocking antibodies, this test should be verified with Coombs anti-Brucella (CAB) or immunocapture agglutination (ICA) tests. In recent years Brucella Coombs gel test (ODAK Brucella Coombs Gel Test, Toprak Medikal, Turkey) developed in our country, was available as a new and rapid agglutination based method. The test is performed in vials that contain Coombs antibodies within gel matrix and results are evaluated visually within two hours.The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy of Brucella Coombs gel test (BCGT) with STA, CAB and ICA methods in serological diagnosis of brucellosis. A total of 100 serum samples with suspected brucellosis sent to our laboratory between January 2012-August 2013 in which 31 high positive (≥ 1/160), 23 low positive (≤ 1/80) and 46 negative samples diagnosed with CAB test (Seromed, Turkey) were included in the study. All the samples were studied using titrations with STA (Seromed, Turkey), ICA (Vircell, Spain) and BCGT (Islab, Turkey) methods. With STA, CAB and BCGT tests ≥ 1/160, with ICA test ≥ 1/320 were accepted as positive titers. The correlation between the tests were evaluated with Cohen's kappa (κ) analysis. In our study, seven of the samples yielded positive results with STA, 30 with ICA, and 32 with BCGT. The number of the sera which yielded positive results with all three methods was 28. Two samples positive with CAB and BCGT resulted low titer/negative with ICA, one sample positive with ICA and BCGT resulted low titer/negative with CAB, and one low titer/negative sample with CAB and BCGT yielded positive with ICA test. STA test was not included in the statistical evaluation due to its very low positivity rate. According to the kappa analysis, almost perfect agreement was detected between the other methods (κ= 0.887 for CAB and ICA, κ= 0.977 for CAB and BCGT, κ= 0.907 for ICA and BCGT). In conclusion, BCGT method showed excellent correlation with both CAB and ICA tests; the application of the test was practical; resulted in a short time such as two hours and visually evaluation was determined to be practical compared to other methods. Although BCGT can be recommended for routine diagnostics, evaluation of specificity and sensitivity with comprehensive studies including a greater number of cases and control samples should be considered.","inCitations":["dc886b058d281d198ee17b0e1abe6ad796b58aef","ab4f20acaeb17600c12834d3a8a4565a664f7426","51e2ae988561e893c87519c53ed9ee26cf950023","72c19972c3cf3c55d9900830f422b0fe060a3d4a"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.mikrobiyolbul.org/managete/fu_folder/2015-02/2015-49-2-181-187.pdf"],"title":"[Comparison of a new and rapid method, Brucella Coombs gel test with the other methods in the serological diagnosis of brucellosis].","doi":"10.5578/mb.8881","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.5578/mb.8881","venue":"Mikrobiyoloji bulteni"}

While ultracentrifugation has been used to separate and purify raw SWNT soot, this method removes all but the shortest nanotubes. Therefore, it is not practical for many electronic applications.

It was found impossible to count the number of embryos in the seed, in spite of the size of both seed and embryo. But the cotyledons are in such a way twisted around each other that it is impossible to separate them. Thus it was necessary to take into acount only the embryos which were able to germinate and their number was determined after 3 and 7 months. It was necessary to dig up the seedlings and wash off all soil in order to distinguish ramifications of shoot and root from the actual polyembryony. In 7 months old seedlings a new complication arises owing to the complete fusion of their base. Evidently there is a pronounced variation in the occurrence of polyembryonic seeds.

This article sets out to examine Plato's concept of  eros (in its most elevated sense) and his description of the nature of absolute beauty, through a close reading of the words of Diotima.

However, that study was restricted to a sample of 8 EM residency programs and used individual faculty ratings from milestone reporting forms that were designed for use by the program’s Clinical Competency Committee (CCC). The objective of this study was to investigate whether similar results would be found when examining the entire national cohort of EM milestone ratings reported by programs after CCC consensus review. Method This study examined longitudinal milestone ratings for all EM residents (n = 1,363; 125 programs) reported to the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education every 6 months from 2014 to 2017. A multilevel linear regression model was used to estimate differences in slope for all subcompetencies, and predicted marginal means between genders were compared at time of graduation. Results There were small but statistically significant differences between males’ and females’ increase in ratings from initial rating to graduation on 6 of the 22 subcompetencies. Marginal mean comparisons at time of graduation demonstrated gender effects for 4 patient care subcompetencies. For these subcompetencies, males were rated as performing better than females; differences ranged from 0.048 to 0.074 milestone ratings. Conclusions In this national dataset of EM resident milestone assessments by CCCs, males and females were rated similarly at the end of their training for the majority of subcompetencies. Statistically significant but small absolute differences were noted in 4 patient care subcompetencies.","inCitations":["a741991b910130f9a77f03eab41d54dac59f4cb1"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Comparison of Male and Female Resident Milestone Assessments During Emergency Medicine Residency Training: A National Study","doi":"10.1097/ACM.0000000000002988","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1097/ACM.0000000000002988","venue":"Academic medicine : journal of the Association of American Medical Colleges"}

About 30% of children with IgAN will eventually have end-stage renal failure after 20 years from onset. A nation-wide survey was conducted and data of hospitalized children (younger than 14 years old) with IgAN during the period of 1995 to 2004 were analyzed. The aim was to investigate the clinical and pathological characteristics, treatment and outcome of the hospitalized children with IgAN.\n\n\nMETHODS\nQuestionnaires concerning children with IgAN were designed by the Subspecialty Group of Nephrology, Chinese Society of Pediatrics and distributed to the doctors of 33 hospitals in China. The criterion of IgAN was prominent and diffuse IgA deposition and to a lesser extent, other immunoglobulins in the glomerular mesangium and/or capillary loops, and purpura nephritis, lupus nephritis and hepatic disease were excluded. The data were collected and analyzed.\n\n\nRESULTS\nFrom January 1, 1995 to December 31, 2004, 1349 hospitalized children were diagnosed as IgAN. The cases of childhood IgAN accounted for 1.37% of the hospitalized cases with urologic-kidney diseases and 11.18% of those who underwent renal biopsies. Complete records were available for 1203 patients. The male to female ratio was 2.07:1. Both the median ages at the disease onset and diagnosis were 9.0 years. The median duration from onset to diagnosis of IgAN was 4 months; 55.94% of patients had predisposing causes, especially infection. Recurrent macroscopic hematuria was the most common clinical manifestation (41.15%), followed by nephritic syndrome (23.77%) and hematuria and proteinuria (20.78%). Subclass III (41.40%) and II (28.51%) were the most common histologic types. The main type of immunofluorescence examination was IgA deposition (34.50%). The intensity of IgA deposition in patients with hematuria and proteinuria and in acute rapidly progressive nephritis was the strongest (+++). There was no unified treatment scheme. Some patients were treated with corticosteroids and immunosuppressants, and 69.24% of the patients with IgAN showed clinical improvement, 10.39% remained unchanged, and 2 cases presented deterioration. The rate of follow-up was 23.35%, the mean duration of follow-up was 24.4 months.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe mean age of onset of the primary childhood IgAN was after 6 years. Hematuria was the most common clinical manifestation. Subclass III and II were the most common histologic type. There was no unified treatment scheme. The rate of follow-up was lower and the rate of lost follow-up was high. It is necessary to establish a normalized management, treatment and follow-up system for childhood IgAN in China.","inCitations":["ab62b6e9d281b7b2cc70eebca46aa47d45035736"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"[Clinical and pathological manifestations of Chinese childhood patients with primary IgA nephropathy: a national collaborative study of 33 hospitals].","doi":"","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"Zhonghua er ke za zhi = Chinese journal of pediatrics"}

It was crucial to study the relation between Phot2 localization at chloroplast membrane and phosphorylation of TOC GTPases under blue light intensities. Kinase activity of Phot2 towards TOC GTPases was characterized in outer membrane of Pisum sativum. TOC GTPases were specifically and differentially phosphorylated under diffrent light quality and intensities. Gene chip analysis was performed to correlate between expression of TOC complex subunits and blue light receptors genes using A. thaliana. It was found that transcript level of AtToc33 was the highest observed expression with AtToc159 and AtToc75-III. Also, 26 phototropins and photropin-like genes were identified. Coexpression gene netweork of AtPhot2 has revealed a close connection with TPR-containing protein (At1g01320) and chloroplast Toc159 (AT4G15810). Co-immunoprecipitaion assay has evidenced that no intercation was detected between AtPhot2-KD and PsToc34. However, AtPhot2-KD was found to interact with AtToc159. Chloroplast outer and inner envelopes purified from A. thaliana knockout line of Phot2 has phosphorylated AtToc33 and AtToc86/159 in vitro. Hereby, Phot2 is not the specific protein kinase for TOC GTPases. Hence, it was suggested that certain signal cascades may directly or indirectly link phosphorylation of TOC GTPases, protein levels of PHOT-LIKE proteins and irradiation conditions. Therefore, TOC GTPases phosphorylation might be an external regulatory signal to regulate preproteins import into chloroplasts in response to light changes or as a signal of chloroplast biogenesis.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Dynamic Interaction between Toc159 and Blue Light Receptors at the Chloroplast Outer Envelope of Pisum sativum (L.)","doi":"10.21608/ejbo.2018.5958.1239","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.21608/ejbo.2018.5958.1239","venue":""}

The state-space exact feedback linearization has not been possible in the past for the point stabilization of mobile robots due to the restricted mobility caused by nonholonomic constraints. Under some proposed coordinates, however, the point stabilization problem can be exactly transformed into the problem of controlling a linear time-invariant system. Thus, using well-established linear control theory, the point stabilization of robots can be easily formulated.","inCitations":["67928ff2f8b95fa079156f0cdf3d721cf481db32","f4a938da797d16ab1a074bb6290ffb658f47836a","49f1b98b73d3aba5d89ce7d3772005681a0cb510","cdef952a431a5d8b2fc6f4690fd9b832c60c2547","8ab890a9ba6be3568d63ded0a9f7caf7d4c4a88b","7d229c90889ecdab7ba23d2d4a4618abeb615cac","62990d022b19aa0f05fef69f959dadb8aa23ce8b","918a4d87ad3fd99f518a55ef43d716daf1c5cd4d"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Point stabilization of mobile robots via state-space exact feedback linearization","doi":"10.1016/S0736-5845(00)00008-9","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/S0736-5845%2800%2900008-9","venue":""}

However it requires a pure tissue time activity curve (TAC) in order to calculate the system parameters. Pure tissue TACs are particularly difficult to obtain in the brain as the low resolution of PET means almost all voxels are a mixture of tissues. Factor analysis explicitly accounts for mixing but is an underdetermined problem that can give arbitrary results. A joint factor and kinetic analysis is proposed whereby factor analysis explicitly accounts for mixing of tissues. Hence, more meaningful parameters are obtained by the kinetic models, which also ensure a less ambiguous solution to the factor analysis. The method was tested using a cylindrical phantom and the 18F-DOPA data of a brain cancer patient.","inCitations":["0d658972a97013699d150ef41744dcd0f61b1fa5","5aa40b45c9a59d593e72fb22bf7ed8b30f8c04f9","3b1da0559713a79ade373399ff8fe347319b85eb","f8cdb3f5a40ff265ff548f5edbd8c90a01071795"],"pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-15745-5_23","http://www.researchgate.net/profile/Alan_Coulthard/publication/46818707_Joint_factor_and_kinetic_analysis_of_dynamic_FDOPA_PET_scans_of_brain_cancer_patients/links/09e4150ce48ae04ae8000000.pdf"],"title":"Joint Factor and Kinetic Analysis of Dynamic FDOPA PET Scans of Brain Cancer Patients","doi":"10.1007/978-3-642-15745-5_23","sources":["Medline","DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-15745-5_23","venue":"MICCAI"}

The antenna consists of a rectangular loop, a coplanar waveguide (CPW), and a microstrip line. The dual-band characteristic is realized using two different type resonant modes of the loop-slot antenna, namely, a loop basic mode in the lower band and a slot basic mode in the higher band. A CPW is used to excite vertical polarization modes and a microstrip line is used to excite horizontal polarization modes to achieve dual-polarized performance. The overall dimension of the prototype is only 55 ×57 mm2. The proposed antenna is built and tested. It has two common -10 dB impedance bandwidths of 420 MHz (2.34-2.76 GHz) and 660 MHz (3.22-3.88 GHz) to cover 2.4 GHz WLAN band and 2.5/3.5 GHz WiMAX bands, respectively, and the isolation between the two ports is better than 21 dB in the dual-band. The antenna has stable radiation patterns and gains in both bands. The antenna also has the merits of compact dimension, low cross-polarization, and low cost.","inCitations":["c5bd75730feae8d2c20c84985a7ef6959ae5fb14","5f9fc48a69b70a238e57beefca46b75765254f4e","8db24c88212c31e7725b8eb4092e92e8a3f835e5","1b67ffbcadd163e3c487b1077a1d66b904e3730d","f9896712af5571241df144be08d02082e95c9f0b","e2ce0c0b48ed2f3c8ca4d53db360aad8865d0de4","9a0967b4713e28587c5bb19ae01e7261c9d180e5","0f9298ad52b33c5717ae3e87e3571f05e7a56de2","69030bd6b70edbec2445e1e7c25bcec724eee32c","b22bf2586d1f3212da59fd22ac21710a296d8375"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"A Compact Dual-Band Dual-Polarized Loop-Slot Planar Antenna","doi":"10.1109/LAWP.2015.2421731","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LAWP.2015.2421731","venue":"IEEE Antennas and Wireless Propagation Letters"}

These theories are mainly based on the assumption that the particle velocity at the boundary of the hole wall is equal to zero. This assumption is valid when the panel/membrane is massive and does not vibrate. This paper aims to investigate the effects of the panel/membrane vibration on the acoustic impedance of micro perforated structures. When the panel/membrane is lightweight and vibrates, the particle velocity at the boundary of the hole wall is assumed equal to the velocity of the panel/membrane vibration. Based on this alternate boundary condition a new expression for the acoustic impedance of micro perforated panels and membranes is developed. This expression may be used for the prediction of the sound absorption of lightweight micro perforated panels and membranes.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://www.iiav.org/icsv21/content/papers/papers/full_paper_506_20140314070241129.pdf"],"title":"Boundary Condition for the Acoustic Impedance of Lightweight Micro Perforated Panels and Membranes","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

While our understanding of the clinical and molecular basis for this association has improved since the first case descriptions and series were reported nearly a century ago, our means of prevention and treatment, primarily colonoscopic surveillance and prophylactic surgery, remain modest, though circumstantial evidence supports their use. CRC still accounts for a large proportion of the premature mortality in both UC and CD. This chapter will review the pathogenesis and clinical epidemiology of CRC in IBD, as well as the theoretical and literature-based strategies for CRC prevention.

Drebrin couples dynamic microtubules to F-actin in growth cone filopodia via binding to the microtubule-binding +TIP protein EB3 and organizes F-actin in dendritic spines. Precisely how drebrin interacts with F-actin and how this is regulated is unknown. We used cellular and in vitro assays with a library of drebrin deletion constructs to map F-actin binding sites. We discovered two domains in the N-terminal half of drebrin-a coiled-coil domain and a helical domain-that independently bound to F-actin and cooperatively bundled F-actin. However, this activity was repressed by an intramolecular interaction relieved by Cdk5 phosphorylation of serine 142 located in the coiled-coil domain. Phospho-mimetic and phospho-dead mutants of serine 142 interfered with neuritogenesis and coupling of microtubules to F-actin in growth cone filopodia. These findings show that drebrin contains a cryptic F-actin-bundling activity regulated by phosphorylation and provide a mechanistic model for microtubule-F-actin coupling.","inCitations":["aa1daa01cc310bd2b5dea8fd37bcfa41cf6d4971","83acbb9908da77e020a763c8b4635c1c05c6edf7","b75a7cb60ea51cfb9a39dc0f73fe677fda5c5a91","a3d5511b06a84436bb2eeedccffec4e7d009c2e8","f0e53be2b1a6d6d44835d9a8b8696db5e6288260","58dc5c5eae60a72b5b81246951ee9261ef430063","739fd01f4618b899655646730f24d2fb27c7d757","365cfe9b2b14cba24784fa59faf7eba674806da7","5635b305eb8959f93b95f386ad5c9482dbae62f1","8e03fc5ae407e7932b776fb21868a126d7edf40b","d28cb1a62a366899ff348f0bc898dc1aa64a7780","f6b056c5cbd2b948a7dd257d5ceb7f4efb54ea54","841064f59336bccfde98caf9c935e626e3c71ed4","e84f0775058e64363759762ef0c299f64894d1e6","e22d01192d3b419c8bafb1aee259e3b830ec0d70","e289302335de1612a49483c68c262b162ebc4399","d700bc57775c021828a8535c40867eaa744fed0f","41e298a5bc0c27a45d858a4bb2b779b5714834d8","47ac4e86ecb65d38ed148622cb2282616bb1b8dc","0e13ce7c98f88b17a84eef42b977209fceafa3a8","79223f360cff3d54bb34d327a1698aa0052e661b","72eff94f4233740a598bca49606c8f30490b1d57","13b09ea995b61740cae7beb0c603b6578174f068","0cbc7a3b549cc6733c6c10e49569df71af703edb","44c8125d8107967088f05a44675cf97892de3765","94b429548a33a97aed3bbd2b9e6c4dbb6ac987da","7418a5db46b6858fba16c7b6f0c818fbc0a9126b","104d97f7449324c8d9ef7391c8ea4967707103bd","2bbb08e6206ba108e1f0dc4c924846fdb5f5e807","9b115c9464031f1db3b58656c5cda2eceb060900","1c35c0a22f4381a9647b6dfe88ff88d0333e3fe1","bfeb02ab434b8e2c68f43c1f06781db055b17e34","4c9f8b12a314cf5fd221752a7c0b42965313dc83","11e8cd242d76bd38361ea6eb83bad1bfe747e58c","3bf300f0e5092bb318d7e3a36b6e46612d45b6a5","388afadbb6caa347e9c163b6cb60d4c686d9ece1","593ee7d2c6ae9b2e29f1cdc5fe6ecb728683baca","98c137e54f229709c542bd28d77d0d40bb7dfb0a","f32099fee9a8f31c36937dfa6d429afb0ae65aee","eab1bf34971b8d70588edcfabe5c39a17a4f6fc7","cd8690c7f6ccd21006851971207ce9fc7eddb7fd","967c6d733d0df77ede07e2e9f11bf407956f3dc6","bff9ba8704fc484cf63fc6f97d93f6ba58aedf00","4f7905e8855d20d12955917aae6d43f8b1462bb4","bfd602711286612c6ee84db694722181183b804f","97598cd47a1f159e5136b6becb07cf30e3b2e6bb","ee18b672789c7cb0ac4d8a30077baed4246230e3","46d6c9e4338b50e49b6cba6fb99e092ddd9ca954","f3cf5e0ded11653f4f1a5ac0c53f8e10b8d5f8dc","68bb62a998b6b4e2f2e4774af614f7e099e6ce88","8a8f407839209d6fff9c4d26f1539614d64b0062"],"pdfUrls":["https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/pmc/oa_pdf/4f/a3/JCB_201303005.PMC3760615.pdf"],"title":"Drebrin contains a cryptic F-actin–bundling activity regulated by Cdk5 phosphorylation","doi":"10.1083/jcb.201303005","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1083/jcb.201303005","venue":"The Journal of cell biology"}

This has led to extensive research in phyto-remediation; the use of aquatic plants such as vetiver grass to reduce pollutant levels in wastewa ters. This paper describes the comparative performance of vetiver grass system s in the treatment of domestic wastewater when the plant is established u sing three different techniques: in a soil medium (soil-based system), w ith roots suspended in water (hydroponic system) and as a hybrid of these two. Three experimental units of dimensions 1.0 x 0.6 x 0.4m (length x widt h x depth) fabricated from sheet metal and established with 120 vetiver plants using the three techniques were involved. They were administered with post-sep tic tank domestic wastewater whose levels of BOD 5, TSS, TN and TP were measured prior to application, and five days after. The results indic ated that generally, the soil- based vetiver system achieved the highest reduction in pollutant levels, followed by the hybrid and the hydroponic systems. For instance, in case of BOD 5, the soil-based, the hybrid, the hydroponic and the control units achieved 75.12, 68.44, 65.64 and 37.66 percentage reduction rates respectively. Analysis of variance at 5% significant level and th e comparison of means by the least significance difference (LSD) test at P < 0.05 consistently indicated the existence of significant differences between th e vetiver treatments and the control, and between the soil-based vetiver system and the others. The major findings were that both the soil medium and the vet iver plants play a major role in wastewater remediation. Based on these find ings, it was concluded that constructed wetland vetiver systems should preferab ly involve a suitable solid growth medium.","inCitations":["53a853798df8ae47c3969e6479cc568d5883eb11","9f2de9caff5a2042d6cbdf010043ce2fcb1e3eef","7efb72a07eee487e4e3b460ce32f1c57fce5e71f","26bab85c4b621975c33f1fda3211cd20fd9cde03","eccdf163a954d31d8724a011766d5035d0a52f29"],"pdfUrls":["http://elibrary.pu.ac.ke/ir/bitstream/handle/123456789/727/Efficacy%20of%20Hydroponic%20and%20Soil-Based%20Vetiver%20Systems%20in.pdf;jsessionid=35C749928DA954BD96DB8818C8046ECD?sequence=1"],"title":"Efficacy of Hydroponic and Soil-Based Vetiver Systems in the Treatment of Domestic Wastewater","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Successful grafting of the polymeric interface and subsequent assembly of cobalt-containing catalysts are confirmed using grazing angle attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Photoelectrochemical testing in aqueous conditions at neutral pH shows that cobaloxime modification of either crystal face yields a similar enhancement of photoperformance, achieving a greater than 4-fold increase in current density and associated rates of hydrogen production as compared to results obtained using unfunctionalized electrodes tested under otherwise identical conditions. Under simulated solar illumination (100 mW cm(-2)), the catalyst-modified photocathodes achieve a current density ≈ 1 mA cm(-2) when polarized at 0 V vs the reversible hydrogen electrode reference and show near-unity Faradaic efficiency for hydrogen production as determined by gas chromatography analysis of the headspace. This work illustrates the modularity and versatility of the catalyst-polymer-semiconductor approach for directly coupling light harvesting to fuel production and the ability to export this chemistry across distinct crystal face orientations.","inCitations":["e413ff1f3a7cf99274f5ba01aceba666c0f23125","2e7cd9b47964fa762f947a6c033413102faab62b","48c46e96b18b761d592b1c4cc179e8be85c66a1d"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Solar Hydrogen Production Using Molecular Catalysts Immobilized on Gallium Phosphide (111)A and (111)B Polymer-Modified Photocathodes.","doi":"10.1021/acsami.6b01557","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1021/acsami.6b01557","venue":"ACS applied materials & interfaces"}

The optical gap closes around 8 g/cm 3 . Above 4 g/cm 3 an additional absorption band with negative slope appears in the near-infrared region and grows rapidly with increasing density. The shape of this near-infrared band is appreciably changed by the addition of a multivalent element such as Bi, while it remains unchanged when the divalent Cd is added. The thermopower for Hg remains negative and attains an extremely large value in the vicinity of the critical point. It is suggested that the results may be interpreted by assuming the existence of dielectric clusters in the critical region.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Cluster formation in expanded fluid mercury and dilute amalgams near the liquid-gas critical point","doi":"10.1016/0022-3093(93)90074-8","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/0022-3093%2893%2990074-8","venue":""}

The study revealed out that inter-ethnic conflicts between the \"natives\" and \"settler\" communities taken place at different time due to economic factors such as, landownership and entitlement, resource competition and tenure security. in the same realm political factors such as representation issues both in the regional and local council, and politics of exclusion are among the central ones. The finding revealed that both formal and non-formal conflict transformation mechanisms were used via identification of the structural conditions, actors, issues and the general context of framing the conflict. Various intervention mechanisms were proved successful in light of the theory of conflict transformation and brought constructive outcomes. However, still there are some areas exhibited where the process failed to address and need to be further transformed.Generally the process brought the conflict in to the level of non-violent and mend the peoples attitude.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Inter-Ethnic Conflict Transformation in the Post 1991 Ethiopia","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

In that context, a method was developed and implemented combining wind speed data probabilistic analysis techniques and numerical codes for simulating wind fields over complex orography. By applying that method to several long time series of wind speed data recorded on the Ligurian territory, high resolution wind maps at 10 m height were elaborated for both the data population and the extreme values, as well as a probabilistic model of the reference wind speed, i.e. the mean speed at 10 m height on an ideal flat open terrain. The implemented method was tested comparing the wind map with both literature and the available experimental data. Good agreement was found, especially for extreme values, showing a satisfactory reliability of the method.","inCitations":["3dd62c8362bce2cce49afaed6cfa1801a014a25d","86f2fb24e33ee1c0479b2572707f9343879cd55d","46316cc13f115d590e107dd5de61c59560e39f82","3e2c8b7aa9a43635da5d621453f85022eb317022","5288a692c1fae2d6bf502a3c6ef6eb879890d276","20782bf736af1c3d8b249936a993b696df53fb31","d66ff7f07b1bfbc63cb685c2265d2ae330dfd927","d275cda759d8cd17f5f734e1954a9c7d84f0867b","cc97cd2f4c85909c944795bf32483474f84ffcd7"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Wind climate micro-zoning: a pilot application to Liguria Region (North Western Italy)","doi":"10.1016/j.jweia.2003.08.004","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jweia.2003.08.004","venue":""}

Although the lapse of time between the completion of the second stage and the administration of the basergen varies, the interval rarely exceeded one to two minutes. Within one minute after the injection, expression of the placenta was attempted. An occasional delay of one or two minutes occurred whenever there was no assistant available to tie the cord. While it was necessary in most instances to express the placenta by compressing the anterior and posterior surfaces of the uterus, spontaneous expulsion within two minutes after the administration of basergen was by no means uncommon. In a control series of 200 patients no attempt was made to expedite the separation of the placenta. In this group, the placenta, after spontaneous separation, was expressed by pressure on the fundus, and the patient was then given an injection of 1 cc. each of ergone and posterior pituitary extract. The time of placental expulsion as well as the loss of blood were recorded for comparison. Both groups comprised a consecutive number of patients regardless of the method of delivery, cesarean sections being excluded.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Intravenous administration of Basergen during the third stage of labor","doi":"10.1016/S0002-9378(42)90963-3","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/S0002-9378%2842%2990963-3","venue":""}

One hundred four clinical isolates previously characterized by BACTEC 460TB/MGIT 960 were included. Specific mutations were targeted in gyrA, rrs, eis promoter, and embB. When there was a discordant result between BACTEC and pyrosequencing, Genotype MTBDRsl (Hain Lifescience, Nehren, Germany) was performed. Sensitivity and specificity of pyrosequencing were 70.6% and 100%, respectively, for fluoroquinolones; 93.3% and 81.7%, respectively, for kanamycin; 94.1% and 95.9%, respectively, for amikacin; 90.0% and 100%, respectively, for capreomycin; and 64.8% and 87.8%, respectively, for EMB. This study shows that pyrosequencing may be a useful tool for making early decisions regarding second-line drugs and EMB resistance. However, for a correct management of patients with suspected extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis, susceptibility results obtained by molecular methods should be confirmed by a phenotypic method.","inCitations":["6aaca05c2a72d5f90662983b71d6a5b7b63a9c43","2e712874646916fb4ba6f8b2763d849e60cc6e24","3271f76fe0f1b3fceffd6c91798ad17a819f14b5","eb6179a8ee25766c05cbf9d2e622c1ceb6b53736","e96b96c9682d115a400a37eb99e1e015c133af2f","9c8a97e2fa41f08090347f2f990bee8dd8064cc1","d3ef0739430a90a8a697fd139b63d1f5516f6f89","1755529c0257644367a50c519b2f69c05eae11eb"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Pyrosequencing for rapid detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis second-line drugs and ethambutol resistance.","doi":"10.1016/j.diagmicrobio.2015.07.004","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.diagmicrobio.2015.07.004","venue":"Diagnostic microbiology and infectious disease"}
