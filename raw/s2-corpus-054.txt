Items were rated for category membership and typicality in each category separately, and in their disjunction. The results showed non-Boolean effects of both overextension and underextension of the disjunctions. Typicality in the disjunction was highly predictable from constituent typicality values, using regression equations with negative interaction terms. The results are compared with similar effects for concept conjunctions and are discussed in terms of an intensional model of conceptual combination (Hampton, 1987b, 1988).","inCitations":["f267c3fafd846b3b5d7fc7df57553cc9e086e6fd","051c8c690048eb03e4ac9e1ca37c2883b243d893","eee0a4c4d78e5b0de165ac1e1493de8898c14ee6","de471c9d83516fd57e9080db2fd2209e0a3c1ff7","bfa5db1ec24f2f502a173a17058f8b6a66d75fa7","fcb797157c29267783a64c18e04bf186acce5ee3","1c0dfc8171d80ea84c14fa46fc181e06a8e7f9f9","099da46a271575fcdedf188aa09166795f03219e","cbda7efd0125b83b808be1619f1cf20ade52fa06","ed3ae77a996d6283edcdda274426b625679f9450","c71a4aa9e8e83cd7283444d41f4d840a66f6444f","56d76c829f9e30abdda4bfc08613eeb4d1d28621","a4051b40c62acb13ce5a9e3b01d3971d653ac105","79c9d6e2708f69d5c1ac36728cdfd882a916b797","dec77af59165f2a6a300e56140964da5cfce0500","b08eb5986de71696672a307ee4b41c1fbe554a04","5ff330a2c1bea61da4df28fb195bdd3af77a2d0a","da05762c371fd2ceda57bbd69952d10d39fa1538","3e121f455459e156efbff010042ce99986663a42","3bf247cc2e325fd3f2c2e59ccb80ed9fb1379018","6a14456a719b757e411853ef9b23f607c71a0e27","1dc9ab9d54fbc0f97066aae873b497fe83ee0b81","6ed5dc3652b14a15e5811d9957a41155d9f6a199","b537b71dc44238f8bbbe1464d7036173e6a53a5e","0b048fdf50bacf4de29e0bc94b8fc86a19287ace","5dc7ff3bf5e7d7817a2fe0957768f1214bf6f7e4","18482b1855e7de9d497609b8d48cbfdd737185a8","46dbc868bf520b34c2208e7fb2a0eac755ad9497","5bf88ec0cc3b378fdfb28b96105a880670d84626","b1eb5b2f9a2da79db7d02c1df0c90ac7782ae7cc","b805139b3a192e22700b2d4982fb43e7571278c8","b2b0857ea605b8afc860ce7c4f27fb8a2efc7547","aac55f27d6d45587d134b9a92fbd4edb8ab4df51","fc96cbf7f983a3facecd2427a10ad65658e971ae","3204f2818676940c134850ce39198d655fc9bf9a","cd1c6b73ba520d1abf108487d52abed33d3fe581","2cbdb144a1960a49cef9ce666d5bcb34bea43365","e7b4fa2df824392fbf0e22f03df83aabf9665509","940b60c92f74786e1fdb799f642c0812381b15c9","0290fbbf0cd5430d5b79e95854077f0e18ae5c85","6d11476b9b25370d81e3cff3f8d380d67b4ad85e","d66ada789c9ee21f7f01621c5bcea6bcc4d113ea","897367d8a4ae6a46870c68fbace2edc02f6c70f8","bb6ccf926f18de0043df7be484da02151118424d","4808fcf981504158e54f935b9cdba5ea5c330110","5a4e4f2e7c0743c2f5ab8a37f1a27b96d21d49c6","f2df0166efab9e7f12dc93861a0e8489f879101f","26fe9c30d23b4fd06cebd2ef9120cf9328904747","3bbf95a167ab912bd60fcce69d67b0d7a723e0e9","270f095966ad7b3ce1c40a1283a2a6c076c36603","e7ceeb2be2ba93fe1346bc93b16a6b0f62303f00","4be17bfb0c825e642e9e2d2a6030ed1eb2872e52","693f0a76f24a2cfe1b7b151a772f6292eee61672","89c3a11f17ced3889c0bb9a136c0e56392df3fbe","1ea5c684d684a50f69af23c7397af3405105bd26","c703433ec293d21f5f0f2704b88b180c03a57d1a","a081371069323daf28aa7f46170541326aff83f4","67bb9d5a431881b6474215a00653ef7411ac23dc","9031177970ce2618d18be2dd0f389bc250725c72","6715296b6bdb0b08853f3ca86ac3aa6d595a85d0","7379bc1f6846fb3cdf4d0a4d8455d2df9d9a7d71","76f467b7357179b9baa4184fac2694bc3b26825b","791bc8e137fe539a4e491769954eb5048a346f2b","9c8115441dbcc73e5b950ac484592123876d64f7","c4b2771eed98af054261c5f92f50c768f27c1087","f0a6b5df51d2f28394830a1407a9099e0208dd6f","e269175198eaf83e3bdc75f9d98e5ccb0eeef76b","6e133cf2383e27d3a4e1bfd9447095a14a416d49","dffb1ed22c9a3a129ae4d10e1d02e96446468c0f","71647a8a189ee1e637a66d20260a2ceb643d7d84","08975ab287cb629b769854f771ff2688c3189ca4","8a23023761f643b83482d66a77d16ae1811af51e","006a0daa934e958048bc8ca589a1d475d9a539c3","03118748c87a28b00853f77f35d8dd8576fa2f8a","d14c76b7f0f1420e94ea8070fec7708ac1f17684","6f41af13b2a6a0f2581e4300f2bd5a2d8b7e1021","e4330addb10795f8e416d1638587908e092f2247","ba68d3cc2ab3aae55a255686dfe336db180fed99","bd3c9dafc88afd1185254551c311bad2a834c3de","0a25c1d47a72a68509d265ab5c73e051e55fff20","80bbb2e1e51de1a440e0e49c50e45aff480cdb2b"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Disjunction of natural concepts","doi":"10.3758/BF03197059","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.3758/BF03197059","venue":"Memory & cognition"}

The etiology of acquired NLDO is multifactorial and is not fully understood. Dacryocystorhinostomy (DCR) is the surgical correction of NLDO, which aims to establish a new drainage pathway between the lacrimal sac and the nose. The success of DCR is variable; the most common cause of failure is fibrosis and stenosis of the surgical ostium. Antimetabolites such as mitomycin-C (MMC) and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) have been shown to be safe and effective in reducing fibrosis and improving clinical outcomes in other ophthalmic surgery settings (e.g. glaucoma and cornea surgery). Application of antimetabolites at the time of DCR has been studied, but the utility of these treatments remains uncertain. OBJECTIVES: Primary objective: To determine if adjuvant treatment with antimetabolites improves functional success in the setting of DCR compared to DCR alone. Secondary objectives: To determine if anatomic success of DCR is increased with the use of antimetabolites, and if the surgical ostium is larger in participants treated with antimetabolites. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Register for Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (which contains the Cochrane Eye and Vision Trials Register) (2019, Issue 9), Ovid MEDLINE, Embase.com, PubMed, LILACS (Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature database), ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic searches. We last searched the electronic databases on 6 September 2019. SELECTION CRITERIA: We only included randomized controlled trials. Eligible studies were those that compared the administration of antimetabolites of any dose and concentration versus placebo or another active treatment in participants with NLDO undergoing primary DCR and reoperation. We only included studies that had enrolled adults 18 years or older. We also included studies that used silicone intubation as part of the DCR procedure. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Two review authors independently screened the search results, assessed risk of bias, and extracted data from the included studies using an electronic data collection form. MAIN RESULTS: We included 31 studies in the review, of which 23 (1309 participants) provided data relating to our primary and secondary outcomes. Many of the 23 studies evaluated functional success, while others also assessed our secondary outcomes of anatomic success or ostium size, or both. Study characteristics Participant characteristics varied across studies, with the age of participants ranging from 30 to 70 years. Participants were predominantly women. These demographics correspond to those most frequently affected by nasolacrimal duct obstruction. Almost all of the studies utilized MMC as the antimetabolite, with only one using 5-FU. We assessed most trials as at unclear risk of bias for most domains. Conflicts of interest were not frequently reported, although the antimetabolites used are generic medications, and studies were not likely to be conducted for financial interest. Findings Twenty studies provided data on the primary outcome of functional success, of which 7 (356 participants) provided data at 6 months and 14 (909 participants) provided data beyond 6 months. At six months, the results showed no evidence of effect of antimetabolite on functional success (risk ratio (RR) 1.12, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.98 to 1.29; low-certainty evidence). Beyond six months, the results favored the antimetabolite group (RR 1.15, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.25; moderate-certainty evidence). Fourteen studies reported data on the secondary outcome of anatomic success, of which 4 (306 participants) reported data at 6 months and 12 (831 participants) provided data beyond 6 months. Results at six months showed no evidence of effect of antimetabolite on anatomic success (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.11; low-certainty evidence). Beyond six months, participants in the antimetabolite group were more likely to achieve anatomic success than those receiving DCR alone (RR 1.09, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.15; moderate-certainty evidence). At six months and beyond six months follow-up, two studies reported mean change in ostium size. We did not conduct meta-analysis for the various follow-up periods due to clinical, methodological, and statistical heterogeneity. However, point estimates from these studies at six months consistently favored participants in the antimetabolite group (low-certainty evidence). Beyond six months, while point estimates from one study favored participants in the antimetabolite group, estimates from another study showed no evidence of a difference between the two groups. The certainty of evidence at both time points was low. Adverse events Adverse events were rare. One study reported that one participant in the MMC group experienced delayed wound healing. Other studies reported no significant adverse events related to the application of antimetabolites. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is moderate-certainty evidence that application of antimetabolites at the time of DCR increases functional and anatomic success of DCR when patients are followed for more than six months after surgery, but no evidence of a difference at six months, low-certainty of evidence. There is low-certainty evidence that combining antimetabolite with DCR increases the size of the lacrimal ostium at six months. However, beyond six months, the evidence remain uncertain. Adverse effects of the application of antimetabolites were minimal.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Antimetabolites as an adjunct to dacryocystorhinostomy for nasolacrimal duct obstruction","doi":"10.1002/14651858.CD012309","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD012309","venue":""}

The effects of oral ferrous fumarate and intravenous iron sucrose on clinical disease activity and plasma redox status were investigated in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).\n\n\nMATERIAL AND METHODS\nNineteen patients with iron deficiency anaemia and Crohn's disease (11) or ulcerative colitis (8) were included in a crossover study. The patients were randomly assigned to start treatment with ferrous fumarate (Neo-fer) 120 mg orally once daily or iron sucrose (Venofer) 200 mg intravenously 3 times during a period of 14 days. Clinical disease activity assessment and blood and faecal analysis were performed on days 1 and 15.\n\n\nRESULTS\nFollowing oral ferrous fumarate clinical disease activity (p=0.037), general well-being score (i.e. patients felt worse) (p=0.027) and abdominal pain score (p=0.027) increased, while no changes were seen following iron sucrose treatment. C-reactive protein (CRP) and faecal calprotectin were unchanged after both treatments. As compared with iron sucrose, ferrous fumarate increased Crohn's disease activity index (CDAI) scores of general well-being (p=0.049), whereas alterations in clinical disease activity (p=0.14) and abdominal pain score (p=0.20) did not differ. Ferrous fumarate did not significantly alter plasma malondialdehyde (MDA) or plasma antioxidants. Iron sucrose increased plasma MDA (p=0.004) and decreased plasma vitamin C (p=0.017) and betacarotene (p=0.008).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nOral ferrous fumarate, but not intravenous iron sucrose, increased clinical disease activity in IBD patients. Intravenous iron sucrose increased intravascular oxidative stress.","inCitations":["4a63e29dd2d430f8a4f096a523a375610e77e2f7","61725253575dd7adc332bf87999b3ecfdced4efb","e658ec31acfffbb891b417e7bfb33c590fc90e18","c73c96bec9a61cf233cb42b60138cbd64bb04c51","ca56d45adce921a70e35d0788cc5690ae670070a","02aa734d801e6293279034c6bd21fe1bdf596b22","bd1524d7ba555e468f898fd38f7c80ce659beeb4","8043b446ef1d20757a5280846a93e7a08e707777","a2d626503bfe945e5f59a4d8658652819ac6d111","38e758c8cca493e475026fade974e53a7e6273a0","6d7596d6668a7584cb6c8cd22d741bea64b88aee","790a12e03d32ce9c3aeb3902ea846513fdeb1ec9","976199b54bf58224f7c2783ea8b1591c434dc70d","8d65327c34126d1ff77112f6ed47605910b11ae3","bfff739b80ff7e589564e360501600e53dd92abf","f6f1e1276886acce0d63bafda4969aa53759be5a","53dce6297b4dce08309eaa482057a4768cae73fe","4a5ea59a1b68c0ec922be440e8a28c4051a657e2","1b9977334141e2de079a89e851efe4a9a35d8449","0a6a4db74b3c141f00ede2e4e4e260a01ce91bde","a684068f8ea41157fbc1c6ba19086ce0679eafcb","b797345b79b5ae2fce06ebdaf6b34f81317c0538","783a92bbf317970963ccb7bce131b9c3e6c5dbf3","296e6c33de9bf08a56d65bebc269e30d70131131","0e726b4a87bc0c65abd169f11227f77efc94cdda","9ef8ea85ff67ed526afb2eaf39fbb85963bf1e71","8667c9396fbee357356e135c0b41bf4d2476f8a7","3447cd5d25fbd96ec1416d8388fa763aef673b33","60f6f6b1256668f4e1b1e7b63b6a7972bb85ad13","e60f6d9a5dd0feef4cc2ae832dca8ccb46d651b4","d11182565ca4950a295d8522b4cbc0164a6d50ac","81808de3d69380c7b9a0e1e5b043dac99adf738a","47844240e46357ac26ecba4637b27a25aecb6848","6207ff5237572be995185afd7a697e7fc4331026","b050465c07c7ad96b40925ceddf9b6ba09d04368","bba969b708844fba11102e1d9e11f8f271b91e98","56fdf644e4d3ee974c4712106eb313c5537ed6bd","8193ed1281de81cba33e1b1e17bcdf2bb6d2367a","055169cbf42c6d708eb29baccef298ff13957f82","0b088952dac5985288944b9ca5df2ba64032478f","85b563f20c5784f9240ada83d4c2df39209b36d4","69488d8970c4f20d5f829e852b7c9ad06f067f13","ffe17e144348143e4f0b6603782dc13c6fc8b949","e4abc467d0642f7d8e7ba7be4ca23cacc71b4a24","1bf053592c6f9371bedb2a28fa94f30773802e86","23a5355941624eb7c43e9c68c450c3551b5457da","4ad55cf34d54265042efc3b07a9591fb877987f8","77c22c91df6dd2c8bbbe331e2643d003343562be","0b0843aa38120eac6ea997399e0852faef223dbd","f616d8075ebfa14d30e68aa6cda64ad5adc5ccc9","4d63d285a9e9daa783e3e4974885a55a66949469","d77fdc021f46fc9fb0c40a01dfc9c36cd299ac65","81d93d21d2a18e9079cd1e02788677360348a72a","3c7dcd6903e8280319ac027b29ccd16ae38ac1aa","db9622942531c93f74cccccfbe83c4187fc9a62c","e80cf07fab9cf98e7caa76162925fb36386ef20a","38263c80bdceb6efcd6ca516bbb4c29d2ec7120f","0f7990afd4c9d353f6349c88f8160e670cd0a961","a93280053c2527e95ee0838f90e7beb21fe747e1","4af61576ee8cd797fcb3e30cb7000577b9f96c7c","6957ec3c9b894ea4147141cb9508b87a6dbc0e33","6f241a78b628dc865774165502341d40ec5be5f5","c9533112e3403a29375b85ac31014aa3464267a5","de019598059328e15eeb1d6ded052cd249229fcb","15084d3c8a0f5231de35fa3451a120653c1dc226","51c140c6941a1ffb49dc7da1cba304a5b1824b8d","d9e46b51b441dcd0829a69b880e038af7981956c","e7d834be6d9775ab04db75cef4f6cd34e86fb599","78d0ad4f7ccee55297150bd94cc6c1742fdd495d","9dbfd4a7afad20793406524204730f1050814bc8","940ec8af90ad682e7e8b06965ea332276c5abae1","c6ffa1e4a9590e370d0e371d93d81d7f90693ef8","136c32e602d43034827de65d7ec2c74dcdfaf896","dedb2c02672c30594f359efb4ddbe954aa906dbc","4ae5404bc30df77eab542bc12113ab199922286a","4733d8f3c5eef2cfc4404c39f1a1e1ee6f767f9e","0a1a47f18d396ad38426473fb703d708f4d53ed0","b9b20ff67c80f60d9047bffe204be80bbe59f4a1","c363f3fa745b62f52589bf9a22db73be240c6367","a9da909a1415ad73fbcbeb11f1dc6510b0ebee51","f786d9b971549b688c02008dab6bf987b30d7a79","c3bbbccca55b53f541ccc123927a16e40a17f506","d71791c3bc554953684278128193ba4a1e505924","13d73870af83225bf72a2f7449fcd2d0f14adee3"],"pdfUrls":["http://bora.uib.no/bitstream/handle/1956/1069/article%20iii.pdf;jsessionid=4A4E51BB81A1E082E731ADD8B1899711.bora-uib_worker?sequence=4","https://bora.uib.no/bitstream/handle/1956/1069/article%20III.pdf;jsessionid=B24F6D70826A6FBC83A497082926AFA4.bora-uib_worker?sequence=4"],"title":"Oral ferrous fumarate or intravenous iron sucrose for patients with inflammatory bowel disease.","doi":"10.1080/00365520510023198","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1080/00365520510023198","venue":"Scandinavian journal of gastroenterology"}

The Hymenoptera venom is composed of allergenic proteins and vasoactive amines which are responsible for venom toxicity. This patient also has a history of atopy giving a predisposition for developing IgE-mediated allergic reactions. Hymenoptera stings can be severe in atopic individuals and anaphylaxis may ensue. However, it is a rare cause of myocardial infarction (MI) (Kounis syndrome). Multiple wasp stings in the past may have contributed to sensitisation.

The measurements use microgravimetry and mass spectrometry during irradiation and temperature programmed desorption after irradiation. At low photon fluences, the desorption flux consists mainly of O atoms and, after ~1017 photons cm–2, it is dominated by CO with smaller amount of O2, C, and CO2, with the presence of O2 indicating solid-state chemical reactions. At high fluences (up to 1018 photons cm–2), the desorption yields saturate at values much higher than in previous studies. The yields (molecules/photon), derived assuming stoichiometric desorption, reach 0.014 at 6 K, growing to ~0.2 at 50 and 60 K. Warming the films during irradiation gives rise to pressure spikes that suggest desorption of trapped species in pores or at defects, possibly assisted by radical-induced reactions. Such an effect could be significant for radiation-processed CO2-coated interstellar grains that are heated by, i.e., cosmic ray impacts or grain-grain collisions. We discuss the experiments considering photochemical mechanisms and compare them to the results of ion irradiation.","inCitations":["2fdcf4de758d063d0c8132e8f281a4c93964bbb0"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Photodesorption of Solid Co2 by Lyα","doi":"10.1088/0004-637X/761/1/36","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1088/0004-637X%2F761%2F1%2F36","venue":""}

Techniques for providing safe access to lateral wall vessels were applied in a largely unselected group of 665 OPCAB patients with emphasis on the avoidance of right ventricular compression. Safe access to essentially all target coronary arteries was achieved with very little need for pharmacological or mechanical support. No patient required new intraaortic balloon pumping and no patient required urgent conversion to cardiopulmonary bypass. Access to essentially all target coronary arteries can be achieved and myocardial performance can be maintained when strict attention is paid to operative strategies designed to minimize right-side heart compression.","inCitations":["97cd05acd65c9cc1bacbf0f81cc8c0926dcb06f4","9bdddb588c30830a5d0372ac2316962717158779","de3aa81b85eed1e07a6270012971ec385ad2471a","050f6e508c03ee16d071b155a854b7001c84e3f2","a2f925bca23048de100328e90d4c851806c62474"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Maintaining hemodynamic stability and myocardial performance during off-pump coronary bypass surgery.","doi":"10.1016/S0003-4975(02)04695-7","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/S0003-4975%2802%2904695-7","venue":"The Annals of thoracic surgery"}

The current literature focuses on the role of two carbohydrate fractions in breast milk, and their relationships with infant outcomes in the first six months of life: oligosaccharides and fructose. A small but growing body of research indicates robust associations of both oligosaccharides and fructose in breast milk with infant weight and length, as well as bone, fat, and lean mass. There is also emerging evidence to support the role of these same carbohydrate fractions in breast milk in infant cognitive development.\n\n\nSUMMARY\nThe present state of the science suggests that oligosaccharides and fructose in breast milk play a role in infant growth and body composition and introduces intriguing associations of these two carbohydrate fractions with infant cognitive development as well.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Carbohydrate composition in breast milk and its effect on infant health.","doi":"10.1097/MCO.0000000000000658","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1097/MCO.0000000000000658","venue":"Current opinion in clinical nutrition and metabolic care"}

Analyses of viscous multilayers of N equally-thick stiff layers show that the rate of fold amplification and the dominant wavelength to layer thickness increase with N . This suggests that large-scale multilayer folds would initiate earlier than small-scale minor folds in a single layer or a few layers. How then do the latter amplify at a faster rate than the former to become minor folds on the limbs of larger-scale folds? To answer this question, analytical models of fold initiation in multilayers that contain stiff layers with different thicknesses and viscosities were studied. The models comprise five alternating stiff/soft viscous layers, with a thinner or thicker central stiff layer, in a soft confinement by either viscous half spaces or finite layers against rigid frictionless platens. One or two maxima may occur in the amplification rate – wavelength spectrum: if two, the stronger buckling instability may be either that of the multilayer or a single layer. Early initiation of single-layer folds in a central thin layer is favoured if the multilayer is narrowly confined, and if the layer is significantly stiffer than the adjacent stiff layers. Folds then develop on two scales, creating potential ‘minor’ and ‘major’ folds. In models with a thicker central layer, amplification rate decreases as the layer thickness increases. Unusually thick competent layers in a confined multilayer do not act as ‘control units’ that enhance folding; instead they impede folding.","inCitations":["93ef0d4adffa4555091f4538c2c7e69fd5bfb989","2d661229564eb261ecf6c3a67ee1bbb1aaa633cc","d340bcba5d78f77b4533f425f8596feaa107fa35","c5fe36ebcb6b6c5f45f8697f42cd9afea57c3983","d86845a2caa0063656529be2463bed0adb584247","ec1d242585ad490fb901839423413eb60ca0f9f5","d4a19031f05d00489d9d40be4094a89ff1bceecd","64e73149a11f1595d33a15ff5e66bc32ea5b8759","bc4222adab77ab7408b2a65afc90a031141c84b7","3042e4b3f28682f4f0cea0b3cab0b803573da7ef"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Controls of folding on different scales in multilayered rocks","doi":"10.1016/j.jsg.2009.07.009","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsg.2009.07.009","venue":""}

We have reconstructed and analyzed ten balanced cross sections distributed along the entire length of the Himalayan arc. Here, we focus on the Siwalik Group, which represents the deformed part of the foreland basin and consists of synorogenic Middle Miocene to Pleistocene sediments that form the youngest and frontal part of the Himalayan orogen. We make two important observations: (1) a distinct west-to-east increase in strain and strain rate correlates with plate convergence rates, and (2) belt morphology is inversely correlated with rainfall amount. According to the predictions of the critical taper model, an eastward increase in convergence rate would induce higher rates of material accretion. Thus, the Himalayan fold-and-thrust belt should widen eastward, yet we have observed the opposite. However, higher annual rainfall amounts and specific stream power appear to favor a narrower belt. Thus, we suggest that the morphology of the Himalayan foreland fold-and-thrust belt is controlled primarily by surface processes, in accordance with the critical taper model.","inCitations":["9d77e6f3eb23a2a42871055f5dce3bd3894f7ef4","d4976a7a128135e53491e36af4a51b592a4cfa13","597d2043d09db6075e468485175a28ef21659164","358d673723c6a58e8f0422c9c98886dedcb38496","90a975b59f8537c71a5ab3ef510655a79b41dbdb","e596c2fb1e5a5e1dfdc621374879bf455d7fac7d","34285f5f7ea449ef37e38cd0ff36e50f240a5d38","4157e78d667302f1128ba63e694a9a7305babb92","955b000a18c65195928a65b06a2ed6c964c9240c","1671f9bf2d4341da447a40ca20b2d41cf54a5346","0f348c621fe74792a7acac665b776fcd5a9f8c0b","a2da164c5653a327229aa88c73588ac7a2115092","b6f2dd242c2f14e6e02c9a97e307be0bbf37a40d","7f2fba63b318b7ac2ca619600287af255c18f5a2","e3784e701f3d87222ec4b3e35ea41686dddc0c8d","66b2b931c35ba9b3710104ac7e7e68136cd7acdc","64c0b18bee70330a9cbb525f5f20706180969559","7252aa06424da4ddb4a178156b647c175766d53f","61e1ed1f4e71ed2bf40bda104997693da3fdf8be","4c9a830c6485dc2bda8563fc35fb1cbeeb6a0ec0","7eefa09bc7089616cceed7e164e6a7b2c7a9e9fb"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.geog.ucsb.edu/~bodo/pdf/hirschmiller14_Himalaya_FTB.pdf"],"title":"What controls the growth of the Himalayan foreland fold-and-thrust belt?","doi":"10.1130/G35057.1","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1130/G35057.1","venue":""}

We fit these data to 'standard backgrounds' plus a new source, assumed to be a separable function of position and energy. For the spatial part, we consider three cases: annihilating dark matter, decaying dark matter, and pulsars. In each case, we use GALPROP to inject energy in log-spaced energy bins and compute the expected cosmic ray and photon signals for each bin. We then fit a linear combination of energy bins, plus backgrounds, to the data. We use a nonparametric fit, with no prior constraints on the spectrum except smoothness and non-negativity. In addition, we consider arbitrary modifications to the energy spectrum of the ordinary primary source function, fixing its spatial part, finding this alone to be inadequate to explain the PAMELA or WMAP signals. We explore variations in the fits due to choice of magnetic field, primary electron injection index, spatial profiles, propagation parameters, and fit regularization method. Dark matter annihilation fits well, where our fit finds a mass of {approx}1 TeV and a boost factor times energy fraction of {approx}70. While itmore » is possible for dark matter decay and pulsars to fit the data, unconventionally high magnetic fields and radiation densities are required near the Galactic center to counter the relative shallowness of the assumed spatial profiles. We also fit to linear combinations of these three scenarios, though the fit is much less constrained.« less","inCitations":["34e55e41e25bfc47b2572ea10b6caac4ad10dca1","d643945ea5c3f85228c27161503869b811e4591b","e4720134ab62b0c47a845830c2c1e8967df452c4","749afa8a67683acf008b308a257c2f55c3955e73","6f872d855c3717aa2fadaf24e55c97fb914cd8b6"],"pdfUrls":["https://arxiv.org/pdf/1004.0989v2.pdf"],"title":"The electron injection spectrum determined by anomalous excesses in cosmic ray, gamma ray, and microwave data","doi":"10.1103/PhysRevD.82.023518","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevD.82.023518","venue":""}

Daging kelinci memiliki kadar protein yang tinggi, kadar lemak rendah dan kadar kolesterol rendah. Manajemen pemeliharaan yang baik didukung oleh berbagai faktor, salah satunya adalah faktor pakan. Pakan merupakan faktor yang berpengaruh terhadap biaya produksi sehingga diperlukan efisiensi pakan, hal ini dapat dilakukan dengan penambahan feed additive. Selama ini feed additive yang banyak digunakan peternak adalah antibiotik yang dapat menimbulkan dampak negatif yaitu adanya residu pada daging. Probiotik mulai dikembangkan sebagai feed additive penganti antibiotik karena lebih aman. Probiotik dapat memaksimalkan penyerapan nutrisi melalui senyawa yang dihasilkan sehingga dapat meningkatkan kualitas karkas kelinci. Sejauh ini penggunaan probiotik sebagai feed additive pada kelinci belum banyak diterapkan. Maka perlu dilakukan penelitian dengan tujuan mengetahui pengaruh dan level pemberian probiotik bentuk tepung yang tepat dalam pakan lengkap terhadap kualitas karkas yang ditinjau dari bobot lemak abdominal, daya ikat air, keempukan dan kadar kolesterol daging kelinci peranakan New Zealand White periode lepas sapih. Penelitian dilaksanakan selama 8 minggu dari tanggal 28 November 2016 hingga 25 Januari 2017, lokasi penelitian di Azhar Farm Bumiaji, Kota Batu. Penelitian ini menggunakan kelinci peranakan New Zealand White periode lepas sapih sebanyak 40 ekor. Kandang yang digunakan adalah kandang battery ukuran 70 cm x 50 cm x 50 cm sebanyak 20 buah. Pakan basal yang digunakan adalah pakan lengkap dengan perlakuan penambahan probiotik berbentuk tepung dengan kadar P0 = 0%, P1 = 0,25%, P2 = 0,5%, P3 = 0,75% dan P4 = 1%. Pengelompokan kelinci didasarkan pada bobot badan yaitu dari yang terkecil 391 g dan bobot terbesar 704 g, yang kemudian dibagi menjadi 4 kelompok K1, K2, K3 dan K4. Variabel yang diamati meliputi bobot lemak abdominal, daya ikat air, keempukan dan kadar kolesterol daging. Metode yang digunakan dalam penelitian ini adalah percobaan lapang dengan rancangan percobaan yaitu Rancangan Acak Kelompok (RAK) kemudian dilanjutkan uji jarak berganda Duncan’s apabila hasil yang didapat berbeda nyata. Hasil penelitian menunjukan bahwa penambahan probiotik bentuk tepung pada pakan kelinci dapat menurunkan kadar kolesterol daging, namun tidak berbeda nyata terhadap bobot lemak abdominal, daya ikat air dan keempukan daging. Perlakuan berpengaruh sangat nyata (P 0,05%) dengan penambahan probiotik bentuk tepung. Kesimpulan dari penelitian ini adalah penambahan probiotik bentuk tepung dalam pakan lengkap kelinci peranakan New Zealand White periode lepas sapih belum dapat meningkatkan daya ikat air daging, menurunkan keempukan daging dan menurunkan bobot lemak abdominal. Meski demikian, pemberian probiotik mampu menurunkan kadar kolesterol daging. Penambahan probiotik tepung pada level 1% memberikan hasil optimal","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Pengaruh Penambahan Probiotik Bentuk Tepung Dalam Pakan Lengkap Terhadap Kualitas Karkas Kelinci Peranakan New Zealand White Periode Lepas Sapih","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

These methods have been shown to perform well if the number of covariates is relatively small. However, as the number of covariates increase, their influence on partition probabilities overwhelm any information the response may provide in clustering and often encourage partitions with either a large number of singleton clusters or one large cluster resulting in poor model fit and poor out-of-sample prediction. This same phenomenon is observed in Bayesian nonparametric regression methods that induce a conditional distribution for the response given covariates through a joint model. In light of this, we propose two methods that calibrate the covariate-dependent partition model by capping the influence that covariates have on partition probabilities. We demonstrate the new methods’ utility using simulation and two publicly available datasets.","inCitations":["3b8a4fe850d50fcc1b182f8c0c664c5861b9cbb7","3482d984fd1c60416e40ba4409a42addbc74da7f","36acb1efa73a92172999c21f38de80e2d90712ac"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.mat.uc.cl/~quintana/PPMxCalibratedTR.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11222-017-9777-z"],"title":"Calibrating covariate informed product partition models","doi":"10.1007/s11222-017-9777-z","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11222-017-9777-z","venue":"Stat.

It has been shown that this ability relies on motor areas of the human brain that are not only active during action execution and action observation, but also during anticipation of another person's action. Recording electroencephalograms during a triadic social interaction, we assessed whether activation of motor areas pertaining to the human mirror-neuron system prior to action observation depends on the social relationship between the actor and the observer. Anticipatory motor activation was stronger when participants expected an interaction partner to perform a particular action than when they anticipated that the same action would be performed by a third person they did not interact with. These results demonstrate that social interaction modulates action simulation.","inCitations":["d60b055f2ed53a5cce93551c4e1ad7df23514827","8f06b4f38c27b83d600bbec39cc82e5350bc9da3","366177ab4417f853a4c5519dec9eacb42570743c","de46587885a44613b999fc58085d8852e6a18d58","53a0e26d32d5a89486c1347d5ccbbf964390a139","9145915a8265e5214e92f6ed98d6ec149af0391f","38ccd7e5b898f1a3383a0139629d4e7d866e53ca","50c4d6d27845782a98f2a87ebf50112242012d74","2000bfeaec53afd4dc2833661b0c703f37c38bfc","56534c15b019c6c646ecedb56a1fde32feaf2c81","9cdba1ce09d16fdbb38061be460f36c077d40655","731609b3bbb0c17fa44350f49eacdab5c24383d1","ac4cbf66981f370e4ddb829b2fd41d2ee047871b","db19bd13af9ebca7b414aa323ce5e0b44e30d047","b910b39c7092d59fb59a35e83ff45d34342ff036","d2c28906cd60b946350f230a8e953a67634e2d2c","65d5cbe4ba1940da98e7c7d7dbef046d14543be3","d2dcfe72bbfd7e71eba3e559a91354e124dfa67e","ae2de8b93e4accb3b00d0dea5b23c441d514fc5a","f4e650ad10a729059b33b8df740858f024504055","d510e1c51bb4f4296dbcc74d68abb469b0870299","e27165d3336c777a34f43044e3fd4e91be6a7d5a","fdc215a0787e8b467d981e21390a58f9ea0af831","ef1ce887682996ed25e349c1b4c478f984849ef8","a86de07ff2d376620dae44ca895e8f71f8f40dbd","7838e738282f99f5f0ffb315da77583f72ee5a78","16daef8e9a5ee810116d7553bf016ceff91f3778","f5978369fe5d3259dcf3bd0534bb294d84a4aba8","1c17129b0c7874410d8195546d9281e54d430330","c0e850bab971639fde9f1950aa55f8a1701e0723","5bc957cfa421559c611e5517f27f25fea3102851","dc9f12ebedb769840424387ca3c3b935c6f12860","67d3f1d4512ab64f7a6a187a95de5eff97f0950b","874f9d93c29a76cc3a74b2b6fe5dfae4abd4d34b","f23d84dfbe0b2b38bd523ebf5d67ccaccb52e433","4011a2776c57335cfcaca108980f64ebd3930910","692b9d6469db9a897b176517b0a74a09b8df3059","e80eac729b0811e4780b439f858bf3e9c18dc07c","cc22b01c2a8ab39c84a6afe879c604867738ba9b","158a1fbc887638cbb12dbb7e579e6faf671d30ab","40bcdabd4b8ed08bed15fc09fb79fcd0c377df1d","e04e918c0dec6ab70441c2e0c37cda970983ec5c","25df5f0422282aa4e486794554dcfdfc6fa3d8d5","f977b87e5f459b9393e22f33a07279469a6912dd","66cd3044335618a39a245eb1bfe5ae7807ca92c2","ab574e2dedccd3acb9a8a4cb30f6b18fa3ffb73a","0746e5be2d0cda7020e8b07456838bbd30d370ce","42fb694729d677740ad2907d9213d7064a0b52cd","adcf221f1cdde27b00f31cfa885da62c1f617818","df9c9607a2d439fe4fc128b3b29dcd38ed3303c9","265e6f55e6774dfc80cc40aa3b90de2e5c8e6704","fc175a141df5c60200f492d2ffe4146b0a294d1a","77940cd786b802bd3f1f68696ae55ce60a47e90e","4efd10d68995e70e9a529734a1afffd4c9b9e7fa","ab5439677ee08754e316f3222eab3b3d4ef72fee","71712e308cbbbab452bf9d6b8241352288b4023f","9d5466e07d18980a59db17e79d7d6d72713482f9","8b8ba50fbdcb078c8dbafa839b9342fabc428a0a","e984fe2fea50ef66a01e131d7ef4709856b3bcb7","0f556b64a9f364b667d1f05df495d857c18d0d1b","3ff7148b23b776608c4e0c5e3820ab34e6cbbea3","094234ecf45054e7b37fee67ec7f6138fbe8130d","bf85df244bc53197324cc975c400597ecf829389","43ac488b7b81ddeb9d9bd2aa0e4aa3dc54ef7568","72acaf87e819536b483b238533e162cf21f26657","1c7bb61fedb580d1ff03d7317c24f3049a4ed96f","e106a7d4b4f370ee786ea9aabcdd0a7d81a0ef63","85864d8da2da6c1d4c5bca54a27f6b4add6b4a99","b28dd3cbd122ba9faec2b336df3ac0998b0c720c","a3065786c986291734ae976acda1c3f4f958d06e","40d7619a5a97a16958cf1e03504116f701be626f","c69b36cf807b25ecfcc7dadfb177756965e1d43c"],"pdfUrls":["http://rsbl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/roybiolett/early/2010/06/15/rsbl.2010.0478.full.pdf","http://rsbl.royalsocietypublishing.org/panels_ajax_tab/roysoc_tab_pdf/node:17675/1","https://somby.ceu.edu/sites/somby.ceu.edu/files/attachment/basicpage/6/2010kourtis.pdf","http://rsbl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/roybiolett/6/6/758.full.pdf","http://rsbl.royalsocietypublishing.org/panels_ajax_tab/roysoc_tab_pdf/node:23888/1"],"title":"Favouritism in the motor system: social interaction modulates action simulation","doi":"10.1098/rsbl.2010.0478","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1098/rsbl.2010.0478","venue":"Biology Letters"}

Of normal prostate specimens, 76% showed no staining while the remainder showed only weak epithelial (glandular) staining. No significant stromal staining was noted in any normal prostate specimen. In contrast most benign prostatic hyperplasia specimens showed abundant staining. Epithelial staining was observed in 88% and stromal staining in 73% of specimens. A majority of prostate carcinoma specimens also stained, with 62% and 36% showing epithelial and stromal staining, respectively. No association was noted between staining and either tumor grade or clinical stage. These data argue against any clinical usefulness of immunostaining for ras p21 in the diagnosis or grading of prostate cancer.","inCitations":["ffbe75ea812526190756eab0e530abd54f640920","da74c78acc63884ce021339d2c3f6e7cabab1b08","f4cd1ee1aaf3285c2a73b37d351a78fa6e89a3e4","8d8611e19125abe8f3bfa29aba73e97497594ed8","21b6749a9cc7d640e3d0f77a3373eba4b1a312c0","6ab99b6341c537232c041031a2253d1756695ebd"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Immunohistochemical staining of ras p21: staining in benign and malignant prostate tissue.","doi":"10.1097/00005392-199501000-00083","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1097/00005392-199501000-00083","venue":"The Journal of urology"}

Des potions locales et d’autres produits provenant des grandes villes du pays, du Nigeria, de la Cote-d’Ivoire ou de la Chine, sont exploites dans la prevention et la guerison. Les pratiques magico-religieuses et divinatoires occupent aussi une place importante. Certaines populations pratiquent l’isolement pour limiter la contagion. Le recours a un specialiste ou un centre de sante n’intervient que lorsque les traitements susmentionnes echouent. La vaccination est percue comme une strategie efficace, mais elle est entravee par differents facteurs lies aussi bien aux beneficiaires qu’au personnel de sante. Les femmes jouent un role important dans le suivi des symptomes et le lancement des alertes. Les hommes apparaissent comme les seuls decideurs et se presentent egalement comme des guerisseurs de la maladie.

In this study, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the risk factors associated with lymph node metastasis for the patients with non-curative endoscopic resection of early gastric cancer.MethodsThe related studies were identified by searching PubMed and Embase databases. According to the status of lymph node metastasis, all patients were classified into node-negative group and node-positive group. The relevant clinicopathologic factors were extracted, and the pooled odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CIs) were assessed using a fixed effects model or random effects model.ResultsA total of nine relevant studies involving 1720 early gastric cancer patients who underwent additional surgery following the non-curative endoscopic resection were included in this meta-analysis. The results indicated that deeper submucosal invasion (SM2) (OR 3.44, 95% CI 1.94–6.10, P < 0.001; I2 = 0%), positive vertical margin (OR 2.35, 95% CI 1.57–3.53, P < 0.001; I2 = 0%), lymphatic invasion (OR 11.06, 95% CI 5.47–22.36, P < 0.001; I2 = 0%), and vascular invasion (OR 2.79, 95% CI 1.68–4.64, P < 0.001; I2 = 0%) were significantly associated with lymph node metastasis for these patients. However, horizontal margin, tumor size, differentiation type, and ulceration were not identified as risk factors associated with lymph node metastasis.ConclusionLymphatic invasion, vascular invasion, deeper submucosal invasion (SM2), and positive vertical margin should be strongly considered in selecting the candidates for additional surgery treatment.","inCitations":["6eafac0cd0ddfbe4d4ae2837e7b5ccb4f43bdbf6","d69140dae11de4aea89920c3835edead7b134b43","49fd24a27d370313168be2b5cdbe70940622f6e1","f33f5c71809cf68f624172831c0e5c2de5b67674","90857362a02ca02ba8b86e62bdc0f99fe1e20593","00f15107855177220dae545640e73d229d0fee9f"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Risk Factors Associated with Lymph Node Metastasis for Early Gastric Cancer Patients Who Underwent Non-curative Endoscopic Resection: a Systematic Review and Meta-analysis","doi":"10.1007/s11605-018-3924-5","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11605-018-3924-5","venue":"Journal of Gastrointestinal Surgery"}

Limited data exist on how theses therapy modifications are used in patients with PsA receiving biologic treatment in real-world settings. Objectives To describe therapy modifications (adding non-biologic medications or dose escalation of the current biologic therapy) in patients with PsA receiving biologic therapy in the United States. Methods This study used US administrative claims data from the Optum Research Database. Adults with PsA who newly initiated (no evidence of use in the 12 months prior) a biologic between January 1, 2013 and January 31, 2015, and were continuously enrolled in a commercial or Medicare Advantage health plan 12 months before (baseline period) and 15 months following the index date, defined as the date of first pharmacy fill or medical infusion, were included. To reduce confounding by patients with an early switch/discontinuation, therapy modifications were identified only in those patients who persisted with their index biologic for >90 days. Therapy modifications identified included initiation of add-on medications (disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs [DMARDs], nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs], opioids, corticosteroids, antidepressants, anxiolytics, sleeping aids and topical analgesics) after the first 90 days of persistence, and dose escalation of the index biologic. Dose escalation was defined as a patient receiving a dose >10% above the reference dose from the product label for ≥90 days. Results Of the 1,010 patients included who persisted on their index biologic for >90 days, 80.5% initiated a subcutaneous tumor necrosis factor inhibitor (TNFi-SC; adalimumab, certolizumab pegol, etanercept or golimumab) as their index biologic, 12.0% initiated an intravenous TNFi (TNFi-IV; infliximab) and 7.5% initiated ustekinumab. During the 12-month baseline period, patients had a mean (standard deviation) number of claims of 2.9 (4.3) for conventional synthetic DMARDs (csDMARDs), 2.6 (5.0) for opioids, 2.2 (3.1) for NSAIDs and 2.0 (2.9) for corticosteroids. Overall, 45.5% of patients received ≥1 additional medication during the period from 90 days after the index date to the end of persistence with the index biologic or immediate 12-month post-index period. The most commonly added medications were corticosteroids (22.0%), opioids (17.1%), NSAIDs (12.9%) and csDMARDs (5.3%) (Table 1). Overall, 9.6% of patients had a dose escalation of the index biologic (33.9% for TNFi-IV, 6.4% for TNFi-SC and 5.3% for ustekinumab) in the immediate 12-month post-index period. Figure. No caption available. Conclusions In this descriptive, administrative claims-based study, nearly one-half ($≈ $ 45%) of patients with PsA receiving biologic therapy initiated an add-on medication, most of which were pain medications. Further research is needed to better understand the reasons for therapy modifications during biologic treatment and the impact of insufficient control of pain in patients with PsA in the United States.

The sequence terminating with a peck on the matching key (a \"match\") was treated as a unit, analogous to a single key peck in conventional schedules. Except for intermittent reinforcement of matches, no consequent stimulus distinguished matches from mismatches (sequences terminating with pecks on the nonmatching key). The pattern of matches during nondrug sessions resembled that of simpler operants maintained by similar schedules. Matches increased in rate toward the end of both components; mismatch rates increased more slowly. Imipramine increased the rate of mismatches, disrupted schedule patterning, and lowered accuracy in a dose-dependent fashion. Chlorpromazine lowered the overall rate of matches but affected schedule patterns and accuracy less than imipramine. The types of errors during drug sessions were not systematically related to the types of errors that appeared during nondrug sessions. Stimulus control was evaluated for each of the four possible color configurations and was found to be by the entire configuration of colors, not simply by the color of the sample.","inCitations":["a234f188373cac844846242f85a1fa00da8d286a","e96464f18e76dc54d25375d1ce1f99ea92b1d19e"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"The effects of chlorpromazine and imipramine on rate and stimulus control of matching to sample.","doi":"10.1901/jeab.1985.44-49","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1901/jeab.1985.44-49","venue":"Journal of the experimental analysis of behavior"}

However, specifically for materials of high thermal conductivity, the appropriate time interval to be considered in calculations is a decisive factor for getting accurate and consistent results. In this work, a numerical simulation model is proposed with the purpose of determining the minimum and maximum measuring time for the hot wire parallel technique. Nevertheless, the factor that limits the application of the hot wire technique for high thermal conductivity materials is the maximum measuring time for the experimental thermal transient registration. An alternative experimental arrangement is then proposed for materials with thermal conductivity higher than 15 W/mK. In this technique, the time interval considered for the calculations may be several times bigger than that one corresponding to the parallel technique, what means in practice that it may be applicable for materials with higher thermal conductivities. Fourteen different specimens of refractory materials, and four polymers, with thermal conductivities ranging from 0.04 to 14 W/mK, in shape of rectangular parallelepipeds were employed in the experimental programme. An empirical equation determining minimum and maximum measuring times is also obtained for the hot wire parallel technique. In this work is also proposed a technique of insulation of the hot wire, what makes possible its application to electrical conducting materials.","inCitations":["c7a2e3f94a7b5418d04848bcd549b9eae7f2bc4b","799f1d0726c1ab70e5cffe952e375f9dbf7dbfff","50bad0f40cf4a11e4cd5155c0dc3fd802eabcce6","d6c2d366d7c87bc40721f016bdc96239de152008","ea963e7bd716ede37e2e87abc2f99ffb91578707","c34a36d998ee3b91a56e6907c3d3ebe29078ee59","f67adcfebfc591b9e6089d88891ec503766d9dfd","b551c8e2af7107c33611ca8a7814f68ce6adf551","093c19caa84a6ddca0701083f9c2a4425ef0e6ee","d87e88b800c7c652447a186b1980da7bf457074a","040c0ef582cf962407af62f4741d6c6f062ccafd","b6c7445dafb77b5b38ae66f05e2eb1f0c704585e"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Advances on the hot wire technique","doi":"10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2007.04.012","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2007.04.012","venue":""}

The pulsed direct liquid delivery is demonstrated to be an efficient process technology for the controlled supply of the precursor solution in the evaporation chamber, which is shown to be one of the main process parameters to tailor the thin-film properties. We investigated the influence of the precursor concentration ratio Cu(thd)2 (bis[2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-3,5-heptanedionato]copper(II)) and Cr(thd)3 (tris[2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-3,5-heptanedionato]chromium(III)) on the crystal structure, morphology and electrical conductivity, at a reduced temperature of 370 °C. We observe for a low ratio, a pure delafossite phase with a constant Cu-poor/Cr-rich chemical composition, while at a high ratio a mixture of copper oxides and CuCrO2 was found. The as-grown 140 nm-thick pure delafossite films exhibit an exceptional high electrical conductivity for a non-intentionally doped CuCrO2, 17 S cm−1, and a near 50% transparency in the visible spectral range.","inCitations":["c7fde0640564d170a28dfe1c0064ea7a46429584","1f0b66596b68d31658103b06ad9f5ba5024050a0","f66b336f6dc676d2afbd2021cab4fae35a2ec440","ad117521739bfb3e9c8bca4a19f87a328442f97d","bea624233e1dfb7e7c7d3b14603b833067414cd3","b5912f14f71ed93411d7cf77bec5dcbb82743229","ac6851114e408a0a9d5d454ce257ff1bc05c85d9"],"pdfUrls":["http://orbilu.uni.lu/bitstream/10993/26865/1/2016_Transparent%20conductive%20CuCr02thin%20films%20deposited%20by%20pulsed%20injection%20metal%20organic%20chemical%20vapor%20deposition_etc.pdf"],"title":"Transparent conductive CuCrO2 thin films deposited by pulsed injection metal organic chemical vapor deposition: up-scalable process technology for an improved transparency/conductivity trade-off","doi":"10.1039/C6TC00383D","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1039/C6TC00383D","venue":""}

Genetic Network Programming(GNP) has been proposed in recent years as one of the evolutionary algorithms and applied to data mining successfully, because of the prominent representation ability with the compact program derived from the directed graph structure and node reusability of GNP. Conventional GNP-based rule mining focused on binary-valued transaction data. Therefore, Fuzzy GNP based class association rule mining has been proposed to deal with the continuous-valued data types in the real network connection data. In this paper, firstly, many interesting rules are extracted by Fuzzy GNP-based hybrid class association rule mining from training data. Then, a post-processing method is used to prune class association rules. After that, a classifier is modeled based on the multi-dimensional probability distribution for testing data. Experiments on KDDCup 1999 data show the substantial improvement of the detection ability of the proposed method.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Efficient hybrid rule pruning for intrusion detection using multi-dimensional probability distribution","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":"SICE Annual Conference 2011"}

(International Commercial Law)%%%%The principle of party autonomy is a fundamental characteristic of private international law. The contracting parties’ freedom of choice regarding the law governing their contract is one which optimises the fundamental principle of party autonomy. It is generally accepted that a choice of a governing law by the parties should be respected by adjudicating bodies such as domestic courts and arbitral tribunals. It would often benefit contracting parties to choose a neutral legal system so that there will be a “fair playing field” in case a dispute arises between them. However, some domestic legal systems and regional, supranational and international commercial instruments limit the choice of law to that of a recognised domestic legal system. Accordingly, choosing the UNIDROIT Principles on International Commercial Contracts as governing law will, in most cases, not be a viable option for the parties concerned. Such a limitation on the choice of a governing law does not promote the fundamental principle of party autonomy, which is characteristic of private international law. Parties to an international commercial contract should be able to choose a non-state system of law to govern their contract. The UNIDROIT Principles of International Commercial Contracts provide a comprehensive, complete and easily obtainable system of law compiled by legal experts in the various fields which form part of international commercial law. It follows a via media system of law with regards to Civil Law and Common Law legal systems. This paper will discuss the principle of party autonomy, as well as the possibility of a choice of non-state law, in particular the UNIDROIT Principles of International Commercial Contracts, as the law governing an international commercial contract. The choice of law will be discussed with reference to the position taken in domestic courts as well as that in international arbitration. To review the impact and success of the UNIDROIT Principles in the realm of international commercial contracting, various international commercial instruments will be discussed.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Choice of the UNIDROIT Principles of international commercial contracts","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

In the present study, the cDNA sequence of cyp19a1a was cloned and characterized from miiuy croaker Miichthys miiuy. The cDNA encoded a protein of 519 amino acids with five structural regions. Higher identities of amino acid sequences and conserved structural regions were found between Mmcyp19a1a and other cyp19a1a genes. In addition, Mmcyp19a1a was clustered together with other seawater fishes. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that Mmcyp19a1a was localized exclusively in the cytoplasmic of thecal and granulosa cells surrounding the oocytes. Both the protein and mRNA levels of Mmcyp19a1a were increased significantly at the stage III follicles (mid-vitellogenic) and then decreased along with vitellogenesis. Interestingly, strong immunoreactive signals were also detected in the supporting cells of connective tissues during ovarian development. A 1777bp promoter fragment of Mmcyp19a1a was also isolated, and functional analysis using an EGFP reporter fusion in zebrafish larvae presented positive signals in the above of yolk sac, where is the region of pronephros and germ plasm occur. The Mmcyp19a1a:EGFP expression pattern was generally consistent with the endogenous cyp19a1a genesis. These results indicate that the Mmcyp19a1a gene plays an important role during vitellogenesis and oocyte maturation. The constructor of Mmcyp19a1a:EGFP may provide a useful tool for genetic analysis of gonad development in teleost.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Cloning, expression pattern and promoter functional analysis of cyp19a1a gene in miiuy croaker.","doi":"10.1016/j.gene.2017.06.042","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2017.06.042","venue":"Gene"}

In India, rice (Oryza sativa L.) is the most important cereal crop with an annual production of more than 87 million tonnes (MoA 2005) and 120 million tonnes of paddy straw. Half the quantity of paddy straw produced finds use as roofing material, animal feed, fuel and packing material, the other half disposed off by burning in the field. But paddy straw is not considered to be good animal feed due to its low protein content, poor palatability, high silica (11–15%) and lignin content (12%) and low digestibility. Burning paddy straw in the field is considered a cheap and easy means of disposal of excess straw, however this practice contributes to air pollution and increases soil erosion (Abdeel Azim 2001). Direct incorporation of rice straw in field solves the problem of air pollution but it is not feasible due to the short time gap between harvesting of rice and sowing of wheat. (Triticum astivum L.emend. Fiori & Paol.). Besides, it involves additional cost of labour, irrigation and extra tillage. Moreover, observations of long-term experiments indicate that though incorporation of rice straw in soil improves soil health significantly, it may decrease the subsequent crop yields due to production of microbial phytotoxins and immobilization of the available nitrogen. Besides, rice straw incorporation increases the Methane emission from rice field,","inCitations":["f7668fdaedfc33bb735d39699e2324dee58075b4","f9a4289e054b9e81367cfa2a5d5c0599cbc5f0fa"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Carbon nitrogen and phosphorus dynamics during vermicomposting of paddy straw inoculated with lignocellulolytic fungi","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Initiatives such as positive youth justice, Children First Offenders Second, and the Surrey model all utilise aspects of social justice, and have been praised for their innovation. This chapter considers all of these approaches in relation to the applied principles of social justice, and identifies areas of good practice. Whilst change is occurring in isolated areas, and has been noticed by policymakers, for this to be applied in a truly effective way, we need to consider why this works, rather than simply what works. This chapter argues that unless we consider the underlying values, ideology, and principles of youth justice, the same issues will reoccur again and again. To develop a system of youth justice that carries out work that is both efficient and effective, those within the system need to accept that their work has inherently philosophical roots, and allow this to support the organisation and resulting practice.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Signs of Change","doi":"10.1007/978-3-319-73043-1_8","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-73043-1_8","venue":""}
