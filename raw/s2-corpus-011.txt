Because melanoma is typically refractory to available anticancer therapy, exploration of preventive strategies has become a priority. In this review, the rationale for chemoprevention, a new and potentially powerful approach to controlling melanoma, is discussed. Chemoprevention success is based on the principles that ultraviolet-induced melanoma is a multistep process, and that molecular events and pathways associated with these steps can be targeted. Early studies using genetically engineered mice have begun to identify a number of relevant molecular pathways in melanoma. For example, Ras signaling pathways comprise all melanoma-related alterations in N-Ras, B-RAF, MAPK/ERK, and Rho proteins, and thus provide a host of potential molecular targets for melanoma chemoprevention. Among the available prospects, the statins, which inhibit Ras and Rho, have shown much promise as chemoprevention agents. However, thorough evaluation of chemoprevention candidates will require the identification of surrogate biomarkers for risk and molecular targets for intervention, as well as high-risk groups in which to focus clinical studies. We anticipate that melanoma chemoprevention research will progress in step with advances in genomics, proteomics, and preclinical mouse modeling, and ultimately provide us with powerful weapons in our struggle to control this escalating, often fatal disease.","inCitations":["08e6fe87f2c5a7632c9b21a439ce073c4dcf6698","72455c5f06e60a9c8f32620b9e4624d6debbed68","d07503c095e076cd9760f5f05d921b1d3a20f47b","f6a269c9a2b30ad86e4484476f52be79b484b9a1","18d6b7838833e8597bb46626fa26a03726a9e0b6"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Chemoprevention of melanoma","doi":"10.1007/s11912-004-0068-4","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11912-004-0068-4","venue":""}

Ribosome profiling (RP) studies suggest that translating ribosomes are pervasive within 5′ leaders across model systems. However, the significance of this observation remains unclear. To explore a role for uORF usage in a model of neuronal differentiation, we performed RP on undifferentiated and differentiated human neuroblastoma cells.ResultsUsing a spectral coherence algorithm (SPECtre), we identify 4954 consistently translated uORFs across 31% of all neuroblastoma transcripts. These uORFs predominantly utilize non-AUG initiation codons and exhibit translational efficiencies (TE) comparable to annotated coding regions. On a population basis, the global impact of both AUG and non-AUG initiated uORFs on basal CDS translation were small, even when analysis is limited to conserved and consistently translated uORFs. However, uORFs did alter the translation of a subset of genes, including the Diamond-Blackfan Anemia associated ribosomal gene RPS24. With retinoic acid induced differentiation, we observed an overall positive correlation in translational shifts between uORF/CDS pairs. However, CDSs downstream of uORFs show smaller shifts in TE with differentiation relative to CDSs without a predicted uORF, suggesting that uORF translation buffers cell state dependent fluctuations in CDS translation.ConclusionThis work provides insights into the dynamic relationships and potential regulatory functions of uORF/CDS pairs in a model of neuronal differentiation.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s12864-019-5775-1"],"title":"Translation of upstream open reading frames in a model of neuronal differentiation","doi":"10.1186/s12864-019-5775-1","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12864-019-5775-1","venue":"BMC genomics"}

In nursing, it is a situation that produces anxiety responses, mental distress thereby sleep disturbance. It can affect the whole lifecycle of a nursing student. Paulido-martos, Augusto-landa and Lopez-zafra in 2011 conducted a study to assess the main sources of stress among nursing students, identified academics as the first and clinical practice as the second source of stress among t he undergraduate nursing students. Objectives: The study objectives were to assess the level of stress and to determine the causative factors for stress among the nursing students of a selected nursing institute. Methods: The research design selected for the study is a non experimental descriptive design. The study population consists of students undergoing basic BSc nursing course. Stratified sampling technique was used with a sample size of 60. From each strata of the specified population that is , first year, second year, third year, fourth year, 15 samples were randomly selected. The tool comprised of three sectionssocio demographic data, rating scale to assess the levels of stress, a scale to rank the factors contributing to stress. Rating sca le was prepared and grouped into 6 domains to assess the levels of stress. Ranking scale was prepared to assess the factors contributing to stress. Results: Out of total study samples (n=60), 68.3% were in the age group of above 20, 31.7% were in the age group of below20, 20.5% of the total samples were graduates where as 95% have got 12th standard as their basic educational qualification. 15% of the sample belongs to joint families and 85% are from nuclear families. Analysis shown that 68% fell in moderate stress group, 27% fell in mild stress group and 5% fell in severe stress group. Among first year students, 35% were under stress due to clinical assignments, in second year 42% were under stress due to theoretical exams, in third year 53% and 54% of the fourth years were under stress due to academic ass ignments. Out of sample (n=60), 41% of the sample are stressed due to academic assignments, 22% are stressed due to clinical assignments, 18% due to theoretical exam, 13% are stressed due to practical exam, 3% due to Co-Curricular activities and 3% of the sample are stressed due to student nurses association portfolios. Conclusion: The present study among the nursing students of a selected nursing institute helped to know the level of stress and factors contributing to stress.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://www.ijsr.net/archive/v5i9/ART20161902.pdf"],"title":"A Descriptive Study to Assess the Level and Factors Contributing to Stress among the Nursing Students of Selected Educational Institute","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

A meta-analysis was conducted to compare the outcomes of transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) to those of medical/endoscopic therapy for acute variceal bleeding in cirrhotic patients.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThe PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library databases were searched for all relevant comparative studies. Odds ratios (OR) and hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI)were pooled for dichotomous and time-dependent variables, respectively. Subgroup analyses were performed according to the type of study design (randomized or nonrandomized studies), source of bleeding (esophageal or gastric varices), type of stent (covered or bare stent), and patient selection (high risk or unselected patients).\n\n\nRESULTS\nSix papers were eligible. TIPS was superior to medical/endoscopic therapy in decreasing the incidence of treatment failure (OR=0.22; 95% CI, 0.11-0.44), improving overall survival (HR=0.55; 95% CI, 0.38-0.812), and decreasing the incidence of bleeding-related death (OR=0.19; 95% CI, 0.06-0.59). Although TIPS did not significantly decrease the incidence of rebleeding (OR=0.27; 95% CI, 0.06-1.29), it became significantly greater in the subgroup meta-analyses of randomized studies (OR=0.09; 95% CI, 0.03-0.32) than in those of nonrandomized studies (OR=0.76; 95% CI, 0.40-1.45; subgroup difference, P=0.003), and in the subgroup meta-analyses of studies including high-risk patients (OR=0.06; 95% CI, 0.01-0.23) than in those including low-risk patients (OR=0.83; 95% CI, 0.44-1.56; subgroup difference, P=0.0007). In addition, TIPS did not significantly increase the incidence of posttreatment hepatic encephalopathy (OR=1.37; 95% CI, 0.63-2.99).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nWith the exception of the benefit of prevention from treatment failure, TIPS with covered stents might improve the overall survival of high-risk patients with acute variceal bleeding.","inCitations":["b7d2f91e6713c2a41138b5194ec748c8203baa95","1a327b2276980eed99cee2a15ea9889dda9e5e62","117da036e8a78dcf5927a6be3363970aa996e871","4417c83fc806beaebccc26d1a650cfe0b5b2804a","a5effe55a613899219ba4951db6770908f2afa7a","55cf711e898bb390697ab895aab8a5eb81665fad","ff6d752132ed362c09020afc9a1362040cc40dcb","99f8e2471be933e93ab4cb997d246c7c3bc880b4","01389b8d1413a49862b80ac27379a48654c8d268","3ce17a4024b1755c21bd4cec19bbd8b5ba288d2e","32ce43ef3a336b74c4cddc70252d74d711837cdf","d544b478e30b213fdbe40204c4edf311c6fe51cc","79455c165ea0f83d60018b90daef7cb020a17206","21c0bc7bbe469ceba5759222e18052a62b73328b","1a2df4d875dfb188482850af7f6f5df31840302c","c33d2aea3dd9b05f46965277453408548296ce57","bedff7d15e0fdc4f6a70d99fab53440a1fd3d6f6","76261c6e27bcdb5ffac4c260c537ad2e1f10f7ce"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Transjugular Intrahepatic Portosystemic Shunt for Acute Variceal Bleeding: A Meta-analysis.","doi":"10.1097/MCG.0000000000000205","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1097/MCG.0000000000000205","venue":"Journal of clinical gastroenterology"}

In shoots, malate was the most abundant organic acid (164 to 248 μmol/g f.w.), followed by citrate, succinate, and oxalate. A significant correlation between soluble Zn and both malate and oxalate was observed in shoots, but not in roots. In shoots, a significant correlation between inorganic cation equivalents and organic acid anion equivalents was found. These observations and the finding, that organic acid concentrations were high even under suboptimal Zn supply (1.5 μM) suggest that in T. caerulescens the high organic acid concentration in shoots is a constitutive property. The variation of the organic acid concentrations seem to be a consequence of the cation‐anion balance rather than a specific Zn tolerance mechanism.

Quantification of such limiting factors is pivotal for any management in these areas. In this investigation novel deterministic linear and nonlinear models were derived for predicting plant response to interactive effects of salinity and phosphorus through integration of a non-linear salinity model with two basic soil fertility models. To examine and evaluate performances of newly proposed models, several experiments were conducted under separate and combined salinity and phosphorus levels in field conditions. Treatments were consisted of five natural salinity (0.3, 3, 6, 9 and 12 dS m−1) and four phosphorus levels (0, 20, 40 and 80 mg kg−1 soil as KH2PO4), each with three replicates. The obtained results indicated that the proposed nonlinear model (Eq. 7) with R2 of 0.92 provides better estimations than other proposed models for canola yield under different levels of salinity, different levels of soil phosphorus and under combination of different levels of salinity and phosphorus. All proposed models accounting for simultaneous salinity and phosphorus showed that applying 20 and 40 mg P kg−1 soil, or even no use of phosphorus in soil had no significant impact on performance of salinity threshold value, while adding 80 mg P kg−1 soil would lead to increase the salinity threshold value.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"A Predictive Model for Plant Response to Interactive Effect of Salinity and Phosphorous","doi":"10.1007/s42106-019-00057-5","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s42106-019-00057-5","venue":""}

Reactivity of microglia, effectors of the brain innate immunity, is known to increase in the aged brain, but little attention has been hitherto devoted to T cell recruitment. Data in rodents point to a gradual enhancement of T cell homing to the brain in the steady state since the middle age. Experimental findings also point to enhanced transmigration of lymphocytes as part of an amplified response of the aging brain to acute exogenous inflammatory insults. Thus, available data support the capacity of the aged brain to mount a robust immune response, in contrast with peripheral immunity decline, and indicate that such central response involves recruitment of lymphocytes. These findings open many questions, including blood-brain barrier molecular regulation and infiltrated T cell subtypes during normal aging. The crosstalk between T cells, glia, and neurons also remains to be clarified in the aged brain parenchyma. This intercellular dialogue and related signaling could be relevant for both protection of the aged brain and its vulnerability to neurological disease.","inCitations":["57ebd0d83eb4889db150dfb68bc384aa91259e21","8f5c69ffd543feb60cccaed3dd0a2164dae68b1d","6ab701489765029434f94b422cd55638fee8aa1d","23abf358c72cd15f1956c613244299d9b0aab8e5","d7d90bc43e3faf6f00b475f64255fbc7a165ee76","678b33bf4db4d466175e18a7124c2124e5f12be3","49ff993b5721696916854e4b363145dd459b1a5e","83552961d1c9950583e7e3e15c27638797aebbeb","fe9a475968f1e18dc6c53d98310379f41368235f","d01bea50f40df6ec74a447cc6b21ea7f2274b010","722b487f61ec0dc73f644dddbe0a14f356a5e999","129de0bdaa6d906a252a24319692e50eb69d55b5","3fbda92ed59fa4baa4aed68da4b1f1cbb4c4871f","b85df4003bf6a3d3d676be1381441d8e890e4610","5218adf4b9552c2fd30fe8974e45410959735178","46c16c810f7737fa98017c4205e0d7c6ad56f9b6","1ba8d26a50219366892fe514f41bbd824e2ae3b2","8662a31d86a8f429f9a9b3894ef068bf63cd5bec","f1c01f4e3b41942f0bfe18f6e1b03327a15c99f8","338572939f112a01a946278bec5ebf8b59600ac9","afdf20e2ae9781fe276ca4204a15b5dba3bc5a8a","f6d2ee32437bf8b2cee805d17157c12370110c15","1feffeaa22300a769d563270d582da33f53efa3c"],"pdfUrls":["http://journal-cdn.frontiersin.org/article/31545/files/pubmed-zip/versions/1/pdf"],"title":"T Cell Recruitment in the Brain during Normal Aging","doi":"10.3389/fncel.2012.00038","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.3389/fncel.2012.00038","venue":"Front.

Yet, little is known about how functional connections between the basal ganglia and cortex relate to PD speech impairment (PDSI). Whole-brain resting-state connectivity analyses of basal ganglia nuclei can expand the understanding of PDSI pathophysiology.\n\n\nMETHODS\nResting-state data from 89 right-handed subjects were downloaded from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative database. Subjects included 12 older healthy controls (\"OHC\"), 42 PD patients without speech impairment (\"PDN\"), and 35 PD subjects with speech impairment (\"PDSI\"). Subjects were assigned to PDN and PDSI groups based on the Movement Disorders Society Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) Part III speech item scores (\"0\" vs. \"1-4\"). Whole-brain functional connectivity was calculated for four basal ganglia seeds in each hemisphere: putamen, caudate, external globus pallidus (GPe), and internal globus pallidus (GPi). For each seed region, group-averaged connectivity maps were compared among OHC, PDN, and PDSI groups using a multivariate ANCOVA controlling for the effects of age and sex. Subsequent planned pairwise t-tests were performed to determine differences between the three groups using a voxel-wise threshold of p < 0.001 and cluster-extent threshold of 272 mm3 (FWE<0.05).\n\n\nRESULTS\nIn comparison with OHCs, both PDN and PDSI groups demonstrated significant differences in cortical connectivity with bilateral putamen, bilateral GPe, and right caudate. Compared to the PDN group, the PDSI subjects demonstrated significant differences in cortical connectivity with left putamen and left GPi. PDSI subjects had lower connectivity between the left putamen and left superior temporal gyrus compared to PDN. In addition, PDSI subjects had greater connectivity between left GPi and three cortical regions: left dorsal premotor/laryngeal motor cortex, left angular gyrus, and right angular gyrus.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe present findings suggest that speech impairment in PD is associated with altered cortical connectivity with left putamen and left GPi.","inCitations":["42d8cb5e78b2a4395d5329ccc3c9f87e8ffa8fb8","db3be729c2c9fbf572a04d08bc7c8edb89e0e44a","365cd3ba4fa22a472544304b7a1a2ea8599cb034"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Altered resting‐state functional connectivity of the putamen and internal globus pallidus is related to speech impairment in Parkinson's disease","doi":"10.1002/brb3.1073","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1002/brb3.1073","venue":"Brain and behavior"}

METHODS: this is a prospective and descriptive study of HIV-infected women that have been followed up at the gynecological clinic from November 1996 to December 2002. These patients were subjected to a specific protocol which included an interview, a gynecological evaluation and a collecting cervical sample for Pap smear, research of HPV (PCR) and colposcopy. Cervical biopsy was performed when necessary. Data were stored and analyzed by Epi-Info, version 6.0. RESULTS: the mean age was 34.5 years. The small number of sexual partners, average of three partners, and the predominance of heterosexual contagion should be mentioned: 271 (90.6%) patients were contaminated through sexual contact with their partners. There was a high prevalence of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) representing 21.7% of the total group. Of 109 patients subjected to PCR, 89 (81.7%) were found to have some HPV genotype. An inflammatory smear was present in 69% of the patients. CONCLUSIONS: there is a high frequency of CIN and genital infectious diseases among HIV-infected women, mainly HPV.","inCitations":["3f9a5af97ad28bfd0a8b45ef26bf85a9de67185b","f34901c35760b965c5f506c9e97c858d6f55fd17","5c1e93f7fb342cd0c57e66c1a5ab4bfdda5f1995","e50ae96ef6ebe39d9c5edea064fe035eca605db6","ded6b35fbac40257707637e064c473874006c255","c59a27e8f7072cff49ed376102270111d0d868c4"],"pdfUrls":["https://www.nescon.medicina.ufmg.br/biblioteca/imagem/0487.pdf"],"title":"Problemas ginecológicos mais freqüentes em mulheres soropositivas para o HIV","doi":"10.1590/S0100-72032003000900007","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1590/S0100-72032003000900007","venue":""}

These rivers are now subjected to the good potential status objectives required by the Water Framework Directive. The impact of the recurrent resuspension by the current boat traffic of polluted sediments (due to strong historical pollution) on the water quality is the main concern of this work. Our study reveals that the navigation seems to play a limited role on the enrichment of the water columns by dissolved metals and phosphorus, as well as on the oxygenation of surface waters. Conversely, the cycling of the phytoplankton over the year appears to partly control the physico-chemical and chemical evolutions of the overlying waters.","inCitations":["77b000ec8c05ff07fbecba78339494a6eb178a2b","3b4c7e1c1fc3f811c9095cf6dd16133ff3beea8e","a650a80d40f7e73da7905befd57646651e4d9395","6112f65e148550598a7950d4cbb2b0ad48d4552a","cc6e0184b310d87b7f26640c74a8eaba6421b333","4b52ca5762a0580f39fb7afd3fbd4eb6553f8f77","d1ea33e77e7c69eb9d475d67d5ea77e966ae23ee","9018e0fb1cfa000a01390620caf83ddb3802a80e"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"On biogeochemistry and water quality of river canals in Northern France subject to daily sediment resuspension due to intense boating activities.","doi":"10.1016/j.envpol.2014.11.022","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2014.11.022","venue":"Environmental pollution"}

The colour stability of ZrN layers is used to characterize the corrosion resistance after testing. It has been shown that the morphology of reactively sputtered ZrN layers affect the corrosion resistance and hence the stability of the colour. The corrosion resistance increases with decreasing grain size and surface roughness. However, it was not possible to avoid corrosion completely by changing the structure of the ZrN films. For complete corrosion resistance of ZrN coatings, a new layer system based on ZrN was developed. Leaving the brass colour unchanged the new layer system possesses a high corrosion resistance and also improves the wear resistance of ZrN.","inCitations":["e9fbcf6b7ff84e5524335801df5db0c47ec185dc","d66acc4dfb2c551154f996c70297048d6e806e35","d5188366f443a4061facc02b54bea30771ce232d","dab4d13cc757e2aff152f50b2bc5bd66621cd114","439295809f9ac3fb1c4351dd834e21cc282e9dd3","3e3b8c94d1d4e976e4644e8806398f38e6e40c2e","ede7bb5dcb33f64e7b4d30126d99bbb430b68526","992c35e52366d79bc12e60da52659b6434d49bba","12cbf28943788ce2027e2811deda55275afbacf2","32973d3f9acbfb836bb9a97a2a8e870e50046d08","1d49611b0ff7243c70dff115f6912dbfd4752fbd","358c4995a9013e1b875f767b98a6b03eacf9b20a","4842280fc57ab068c9521c1ac25e7e5bbe57474d","9c60d867aaed32d72daf23ce41595a6208034c4f","be1d34b08a859357a1344f8f4d0bcb3c79682d73","2cbec64bcbdd989b397580ad771fb45e1120d026","73169457fdc429b330b1f3c1227cd47cb21812c4","fc18fe2b403fee90e2b239d35473b40d03ccbf43","d3cc6f5e5d8d3f4781369afd5561ed0dd7e309dd"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Decorative hard coatings with improved corrosion resistance","doi":"10.1016/S0257-8972(98)00791-9","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/S0257-8972%2898%2900791-9","venue":""}

This paper presents findings relating to the changes in the role of the nurse teacher following the formation of links with higher education. Some of the issues discussed include the difficulties related to academic status and the relationships between nurse teachers and other lecturers in higher education, changes in teaching styles and the place of student nurses within higher education.

The theoretical part of the term implies some degree of removal from the organism. By this distancing of morphology from the organism, theoretical morphology tries to explain morphology or aspects of morphology in terms of core principles of geometry, function, inheritance, growth, and development (McGhee 1999). Theoretical morphology can be restricted to the simulation of biological form via “programs” of morphogenesis or growth (Reif and Weishampel 1991). These can be actual computer programs, purely mathematical or analytical models, or physical models. Two basic kinds of morphologic models can be differentiated (Konarzewski et al. 1998). The traditional model, meant to provide an empirical description of growth, has the goal of detecting patterns of growth among organisms. These models emphasize generality and simplicity. The traditional approach is descriptive and mostly falls within the domain of biometrics. This approach is exemplified by the morphometric paradigm (Bookstein 1996). The second approach is the simulation of the mechanisms that cause morphogenesis. This dichotomy of meaning has been reiterated as either simulation of some aspect of form with a simplified set of parameters or simulation of the morphogenetic processes themselves (McGhee 1999).","inCitations":["dbdf7d25efcd24bdc939e4c269602d683a296d65","c362b1c88367ef3eae2af283d8a2e56d44b1f6fd","37fbd35a5f9afe87e96ca2cc8e478e93f1daca0e"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Computational Model of Growth and Development in Paleozoic Echinoids","doi":"10.1007/978-3-642-16271-8_5","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-16271-8_5","venue":""}

VAT has been in operation for the last Eighteen years; still it is facing a number of challenges owing to poor administration, lack of good faith and honesty, rampant corruption, political instability, the problems of non-issuance of bill, narrow coverage, etc. For the improvement in effective VAT implementation, various areas including proper billing system, efficient tax administration, intensive billing enforcement, wide coverage, computerization, etc. VAT registrants are involving in VAT fraud. In this situation IRD has the various challenges to control the VAT evasion and implement the policy in effective and efficient way. The study is focused on the effectiveness of the VAT implementation of VAT collection policy in real field. Hence, its main objective is to analyze the effectiveness of the VAT implementation. For efficient implementation VAT officials have to perform effectively. The IRO Pokhara is working hard to collect more and more VAT so far as possible from its working area. Many taxpayer educations program in different places and compulsorily registration campaign to VAT program have been organized by IRO, Pokhara. The effectiveness of IRO, Pokhara and its officials seemed as satisfactory. With regard to fairness, friendliness with VAT registrants and overall effectiveness is at satisfactory level. Most of registrants are satisfied with the administrative mechanism of VAT in Nepal as well as with the availability of VAT document and information and its clarity. But in case of getting VAT refund in cash VAT registrant are not satisfied. Except in case of VAT refund in cash most satisfaction level of VAT registrants toward present VAT collection policy and practice seems to be at a satisfactory level. The market monitoring and investigation is the main tool that IRO, Pokhara is applying to control the VAT evasion. Similarly taxpayer education, current year audit and tax audit, billing enforcement, and e-base tax system are the other the major tools and techniques obtained by IRD to control the VAT evasion. Janapriya Journal of Interdisciplinary Studies, Vol. III (December 2014), page: 34-46","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/JJIS/article/download/17895/14526"],"title":"An Experience Of Executing Value Added Tax (Vat) In Pokhara","doi":"10.3126/jjis.v3i0.17895","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.3126/jjis.v3i0.17895","venue":""}

Randomized controlled trials (RCT) or quasi-RCT in adults with acute gout that compared GC, colchicine, NSAID, IL-1 inhibitors, and paracetamol to no treatment, placebo, another intervention, or combination therapy were included. Two authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias. Primary endpoints were pain and adverse events. Data were pooled where appropriate.\n\n\nRESULTS\nTwenty-six trials evaluating GC (N = 5), NSAID (N = 21), colchicine (N = 2), and canakinumab (N = 1) were included. No RCT assessed paracetamol or intraarticular (IA) GC. No RCT compared systemic GC with placebo. Moderate quality evidence (3 trials) concluded that systemic GC were as effective as NSAID but safer. Low quality evidence (1 trial) showed that both high- and low-dose colchicine were more effective than placebo, and low-dose colchicine was no different to placebo with respect to safety but safer than high-dose colchicine. Low quality evidence (1 trial) showed no difference between NSAID and placebo with regard to pain or inflammation. No NSAID was superior to another. Moderate quality evidence (1 trial) found that 150 mg canakinumab was more effective than a single dose of intramuscular GC (40 mg triamcinolone) and equally safe.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nGC, NSAID, low-dose colchicine, and canakinumab all effectively treat acute gout. There was insufficient evidence to rank them. Systemic GC appeared safer than NSAID and lower-dose colchicine was safer than higher-dose colchicine.","inCitations":["0c5c12c8f21d13305183619a33677c76d6823db6","677a457b88df605b58112e944aec2da0fd5ac00f","4924fb77bf164fcc39e372593b429ccc321059a7","9449b33dcbc0eabf640ce8b25394557f2c874b6f","42f1c939ea19eaed427bd7fbaa5d1772a6b762d6","0756f0af00c79d6900f7fb929c39e3b62487d8b7","0a439eb49d122b22f0a38ded809944e608a5a4b2","4a4f7c8d4f9740362b1b9208dc83b5a62c7057db","5fef818f98698c1daa5268c6d3ac4eae0b84f20a","438df39c34e0674c4562cbf2d28cd476dbbb2320","0ac581ebc252a77151a4d81ea98fead0d0172844","b2e1e71a89b555e49b5d1d215cb555be9687b230"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"The efficacy and safety of treatments for acute gout: results from a series of systematic literature reviews including Cochrane reviews on intraarticular glucocorticoids, colchicine, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, and interleukin-1 inhibitors.","doi":"10.3899/jrheum.140458","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.3899/jrheum.140458","venue":"The Journal of rheumatology.

With respect to the number of patients with good or excellent improvement (75-100% improvement) there was no marked difference between RePUVA and PUVA treatments. Retinoid alone proved to be the least effective, showing, however, a good to excellent result in 65% of patients.

However, much of this knowledge is based on culture studies with individual species. Our objective was to measure the effect of dissolved inorganic P (DIP) concentrations on DIP uptake rates by phytoplankton, in the context of seasonal phytoplankton succession in a large monomictic, DIP-depauperate lake. We demonstrated an inverse relationship be - tween surface DIP concentration and DIP uptake rate, with substantially higher uptake rates occurring under thermally stratified, DIP-depauperate conditions. The combination of surface water DIP concentration and water temperature explained 50.3% of the variation in uptake rates. DIP concentration explained the majority of variation, with a concentration of 4.75 μg DIP l appearing to be a transition between low- and high-affinity uptake. Variability below 4.75 μg DIP l was further explained by water temperature. High-affinity DIP uptake was most common when Cyanobacteria dominated the phytoplankton assemblage. We validated our field results by conducting a DIP starvation study on an isolate of a dominant cyanobacterium, Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii. High-affinity uptake was demonstrated as the culture became progressively starved of P. Our findings indicate that rapid DIP scavenging via high-affinity uptake is advantageous under DIP-depauperate conditions during the summer-stratification period. It may also contribute to the switch from diatom/cryptophyte/chlorophyte dominance to cyanobacterial dominance in summer. This study also has implications for phytoplankton-nutrient models, which typically do not incorporate high-affinity P uptake.","inCitations":["197e131e1e034eb2b9699f3df71e6a2c7869c395","15b67c59524e5965a95a6be7eba40321f0effcdf","768784cb521f51538e4495b787a422333091b3e5"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"High- and low-affinity phosphate uptake and its effect on phytoplankton dominance in a phosphate-depauperate lake","doi":"10.3354/ame01751","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.3354/ame01751","venue":""}

Eighteen of these sarcomas generally conformed to classes of anaplasticity defined earlier in our laboratory. Myxoid areas were apparent in two of these sarcomas. In addition, a hemangiosarcoma and a bone-forming sarcoma were studied. In spite of the heterogeneity of sarcoma types obtained in this study, all sarcomas were characterized by ( a ) pericellular, periodic acid-Schiff-positive, argyrophilic, and filamentous substance resembling basal lamina; ( b ) a sparsity of collagen production; and ( c ) prominent cytoplasmic accumulations of 60-A microfilaments in 60 to 100% of the cells from each sarcoma. Sarcomas from six mice with leiomyomatous cells, containing extensive concentrations of microfilaments ultrastructurally, also had many acid fuchsin-positive cells when examined with the light microscope. The consistent presence of these morphological characteristics despite variability of histological sarcoma types suggests that a pluriopotential mesenchymal cell type other than the fibroblast is the common progenitor cell. This cell must be presumed to be derived from the local tissue at the implantation site since chimera studies have already excluded radiosensitive stem cells of the bone marrow as the source. The pericyte, besides closely related cell types that are a fixed structural part of the microvascular bed ( i.e. , endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells), was considered to be the most likely progenitor cell because ( a ) it possesses mesenchymal pluripotentiality to account for the histological variety within and between sarcomas and ( b ) it possesses subcellular morphological features compatible with those seen in the tumor cells. Virus particles were present in 15 of 20 sarcomas studied. Intracisternal type A particles were demonstrated in 12 of 17 sarcomas of CBA/H and CBA/H-T6 animals (or their hybrids) while 3 of 3 sarcomas induced in ARK mice contained immature type C particles. The significance of virus particles associated with foreign body sarcomas remains to be determined.","inCitations":["85b9c9cb62fdd392317b72eea28d1423cb9a7ee1","2c16b4e717be0e3ca14dc5c4dcf6a65e11c39285","64d1e30ea72e86e36a50883b9364b47edac0f06e","e76db5a0d6f8ce983ec0b21a26fdda21e479266a","c6cbdd27ead3e00e72c7df3488a059c513bcd945","c973c6ae89901c04dac71187068b3b3066739699","ac9a9b8f80820f8a5ac7c55fc1330b6a6d320d50","6ef487b5745a682420d8eb6cdacf6718f8c60fc1","b2ffbd883a2b013d025b0db82f793085545b6457","4d12847cb1caba8aa49632957f77fd304a8ecbfc","c8a4203ef570a78925a93badf076a16b8907760e","1f673503f573fa3187159ac03adf4eb6dee5febc","1786b407fa1414fd5372afa7060f67bdc9fc066b","91b6e36654cde9feeb83d6d7c637ddb59b638744","e6f5f6ac3ba0d98dd2dc7ab04e160dfb2e239ab0","3dc629a04986370b0a1812b69a2531d175ceb5d1"],"pdfUrls":["http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/canres/33/12/3139.full.pdf"],"title":"Nonfibroblastic origin of foreign body sarcomas implicated by histological and electron microscopic studies.","doi":"","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"Cancer research"}

In a retrospective analysis, we investigated the reoperation-free survival as well as the clinical and radiological results. Mean age at operation was 51 +/- 6.4 years. Mean follow-up length was 11.9 +/- 1.6 years. Reoperation-free survival was 88.9%. Four (11.1%) reoperations were performed, in three patients due to aseptic loosening and in one patient because of a fracture distal to the lateral plate. Three of the reoperations were performed between 12 and 32 months postoperatively. The major complaint was pain at the lateral side of the hip (44%). Radiolucencies did not exceed 1 mm, but 35% of the hips showed resorption of the cortex directly under the thrust plate, together with cancellous bone hypertrophy at the calcar, noted in 97%. Because of the relatively high reoperation-free survival and favourable radiological results, the Thrust Plate Prosthesis appears as a possible alternative to stemmed total hip arthroplasty, especially in relatively young patients.","inCitations":["02ead2019a3ef761d9dc7e48547c5b5c0f74a78a","2f81f69b05a88d9b6fc64dded3b79380e2ea17b3"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.actaorthopaedica.be/acta/download/2013-3/10-Diederix%20et%20al.pdf"],"title":"The Thrust Plate Prosthesis: long-term clinical and radiological results.","doi":"","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"Acta orthopaedica Belgica"}

At the same time, more research is looking at how physiotherapists in the emergency department affect patient outcomes and departmental efficiency. From the late 1990s to the mid-2000s, observational studies and commentaries were used to build a description of what a physiotherapist in the emergency department might manage. Now, however, more robust clinical studies exist and they support physiotherapists being safe, effective and efficient managers of soft tissue injuries or minor trauma. There are studies that have targeted isolated clinical conditions (eg, back pain, soft tissue injuries). Other studies have looked at professional issues that may have initially been a barrier to the uptake of physiotherapy in the emergency department, such as patient satisfaction. However, the diverse potential of emergency department physiotherapy has not been fully demonstrated in this body of evidence. With many major emergency departments now having a dedicated physiotherapy service, it is appropriate to look at how the position has been shaped and where a new wave of research could direct emergency department physiotherapy within the shifting landscape of the healthcare system and the profession itself. The published literature recognises two distinct roles undertaken by physiotherapists in the emergency department: the advanced practitioner or specialist role (also known as the primary contact role) and the secondary contact role. The advanced practitioner role has been a particularly exciting and debated development in physiotherapy. These physiotherapists assess, diagnose and provide specialist clinical services within an expanded skill set that, in the emergency department, may include: requesting and interpreting radiology; applying plaster; managing minor wounds and fractures; assessing analgesia needs; referring to other medical and allied health disciplines; and applying a broad range of hands-on physiotherapeutic interventions. In Australia, there have been neither nationally nor professionally coordinated guidelines defining what physiotherapy services are needed in the emergency department, because clinical priorities differ between departments and locations. Most tasks in the emergency department have focused on non-urgent patients, particularly less medically urgent musculoskeletal patients who may otherwise compromise the department’s ability to meet its targets for length of stay. Studies have demonstrated very high degrees of clinical proficiency for primary contact physiotherapists working in the emergency department, but the ad hoc nature in which many of these physiotherapy services have been rolled out has made it challenging to determine the true nature of responsibilities adopted by those in these roles (in particular, the scope of practice) and the effectiveness of these roles.","inCitations":["b4135b4f521d3f8e09e64dfe9a7c683f081dfdce","ab48364e5db8d02ba68f1ae8d493cada32dc5cdb","6c02da38e7897d35242147b52bef952185982c52"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Establishing the diverse value of the emergency department physiotherapist.","doi":"10.1016/j.jphys.2015.11.001","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jphys.2015.11.001","venue":"Journal of physiotherapy"}

High electrical current is not required when the rib plate is used to reduce the engaged area for large hole. Traditionally, the hole polishing requires a sequence of complicated premachining or scarce manual skill. In the current experiment, six types of electrode are completely inserted and connected to both continuous and pulsed direct currents. The controlled factors include the chemical composition and the concentration of the electrolyte, and the diameter of the electrode. The experimental parameters are the current density, on/off period of pulsed current, rotational speed of electrode, and the electrode geometry. For the inserted electrodes, a thin rib plate with small wedge angle towards the root of the plate provides more sufficient discharge space, which is advantageous for polishing. The electrode of single plate performs better than the double-plate electrode. The electrode of a single plate with slant discharge flute performs the best polishing effect. Pulsed direct current can slightly improve the polishing effect at the expense of increased machining time and cost. It was also found that electrobrightening after reaming or precise turning uses quite a short time to make the hole bright, and the electrochemical smoothing saves the need for reaming or precise turning, making the total process time less than the electrobrightening.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://maps.pme.nthu.edu.tw/backup/%E7%B6%B2%E9%A0%81%E5%8D%80/paper/PUBLICATION-TEXT/095-1.pdf"],"title":"Design of rib plate of electrode in electrochemical smoothing and electrobrightening of large hole","doi":"10.1007/s00170-006-0621-4","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00170-006-0621-4","venue":""}

This allows the user to evaluate the application requirements and set the desired quality while minimizing the energy consumption. This paper presents an energy-scalable encryption processor in which the level of security (i.e., quality) and energy consumed to encrypt a bit can be traded-off dynamically, based on demand. Since transmitted data streams can often be partitioned into different priority levels, an energy-scalable processor ensures that important information is adequately protected, while sacrificing some security for low priority data, to reduce total system energy.","inCitations":["013f9dbf40be21910d7bc4a34b1bd8568b99d7b4"],"pdfUrls":["http://www-mtl.mit.edu/researchgroups/icsystems/pubs/conferences/1998/goodman_isscc_paper.pdf"],"title":"A 1 Mbs energy/security scalable encryption processor using adaptive width and supply","doi":"10.1109/ISSCC.1998.672394","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSCC.1998.672394","venue":"1998 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference.

It is envisaged that the research undertaken will be used to benchmark the cooperative's current strategy (reorganization) and help identify factors that will lead to a successful reorganization. SASCCO was officially registered as an apex body for all Savings and Credit Cooperatives (Saccos) in 1988 under the Cooperative Act of 1964. SASCCO is at present constructing a multi-million Emalangeni Cooperative Centre that will be wholly funded by its members. Dividends for members are expected to be not less than 12% a year. The cooperative is at its maturity stage. Its grand strategy is joint venturing with other cooperatives. It has further formed partnerships and strategic alliances with both local and international organizations. Its generic strategy is to create, market unique products and services for varied customer groups through differentiation. Its mission statement is \"to be a member controlled and owned financial cooperative that establishes financially strong and sound savings and credit cooperative societies by providing them with quality financial, education and technical services in order to improve the socio-economic needs of their members at grass roots level\". The management problem is finding a suitable reorganization strategy that will maximise shareholders' wealth and correctly position the Cooperative for the proposed Cooperative Bank. The Cooperative has serious financial problems, operating a poor balance sheet and lacks some key skills. The main objective of the research is, therefore, to analyze, assess and evaluate suitability of the Cooperative's current strategy based on both strategic and financial management views and then recommend a right way to a successful reorganization. A modified model adapted from (Johnson and Scholes, 1999) was used to map the whole study. The main findings centred on the Cooperative's reorganization's strategy and its suitability. Management is clear with the strategic direction. However, the strategy is not implemented and executed very well. SASCCO is capable and has the opportunity to own the largest market share in the financial arena due to the low interest rates it offers. It was concluded that the cooperative suffers because of its imbalanced capital structure and recommended that a suitable optimal capital structure would be found by gearing the cooperative adequately. However, due to the exploratory nature of the study, it was difficult to empirically investigate some of the issues fully. As a result, a further, more representative sample that will be able to generalize the results to the whole population is recommended.","inCitations":["c82da9e2e1f58fdba5e89368b76f48033ffc53c3","c4cab35b543de9c40c0e5ecf97aea947888dacef"],"pdfUrls":["http://researchspace.ukzn.ac.za/bitstream/handle/10413/1807/Zwane_Lillian_Xolile_2004.pdf?isAllowed=y&sequence=1"],"title":"Testing the suitability of SASCCO'S current strategies.","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

All participants reported some increases in headache activity from 12-month to long-term follow-up, but at relatively low levels compared with baseline. Headache-free days were 51% to 86% fewer. Headache severity was 81% to 94% better, and headache duration was 75% to 94% better than baseline levels. Medication used was limited to over-the-counter analgesics on an as-needed basis for all subjects.

Repeated X-ray flaring is found in PDS 456, over the duration of the 340-ks long BeppoSAX observation. The X-ray flux doubles in just 30 ks, whilst the total energy output of the flaring events is as high as 1051 erg. Under the assumption of isotropic emission at the Eddington limit, this implies that the size of the X-ray emitting region in PDS 456 is less than 3 Schwarzschild radii, for a 109-M⊙ black hole. From the rates of change of luminosity observed during the X-ray flares, we calculate lower limits for the radiative efficiency limit between 0.06 and 0.41, implying that accretion on to a Kerr black hole is likely in PDS 456. We suggest that the rapid variability is from X-ray flares produced through magnetic reconnection above the disc and calculate that the energetics and time-scale of the flares are plausible if the quasar is accreting near to the maximum Eddington rate. A similar mechanism may account for the extreme, rapid X-ray variability observed in many narrow line Seyfert 1s. In the case of PDS 456, we show that the X-ray flaring could be reproduced through a self-induced cascade of ∼1000 individual flares over a time-scale of the order 1 d.","inCitations":["11fdd8a3c1f4ba41c87365e0e79282948dca03e3"],"pdfUrls":["https://arxiv.org/pdf/astro-ph/0209120v1.pdf","http://arxiv.org/pdf/astro-ph/0209120v1.pdf"],"title":"Extreme X-ray variability in the luminous quasar PDS 456","doi":"10.1046/j.1365-8711.2002.06038.x","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-8711.2002.06038.x","venue":""}
