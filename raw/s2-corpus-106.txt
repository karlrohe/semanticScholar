Normal development of the facial primordia requires remodelling of the extracellular matrix, which is mediated in part by the matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). MMPs can be considered a group of candidate proteins for the etiology of cleft lip with or without cleft palate (CL/P) due to their role in craniofacial modelling. The purpose of this study was to determine if polymorphisms in MMP1 and MMP3 gene promoters were associated with CL/P.\n\n\nDESIGN\nDNA was extracted from buccal epithelial cells and genotypes were obtained from CL/P cases and controls through PCR with allele-specific primers (MMP3, n=333) and restriction-fragment length polymorphism techniques (MMP1, n=395).\n\n\nRESULTS\nSignificant differences between cases and controls were observed for MMP3 [5A/6A allele frequencies (p=0.00001) and genotype frequencies (p=0.00001)]; and between cleft types and controls (p=0.00001 for CL/P; p=0.04 for CP). No significant differences were found for MMP1 allele and genotype frequencies between cases and controls or between cleft types and controls.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAn association between a polymorphism in MMP3 gene and CL/P has been observed. Although the extent to which this polymorphism may actually contribute to the affected cleft status is yet to be clarified, polymorphisms of MMP genes may be good candidates as genetic factors for their role in active ECM remodelling.","inCitations":["9df2f01720b8d756c85163d6893516ffed209e84","a7ca4dce03a2a7935807c15ca152e445dc0b8227","06fc421399bb76ffd05b084362e5d3b344ac6a1b","84a3fc912d120a5bc1088e9f6c5062245bc7f981","63b93678898a4c5b0cbbf211fd8987dd264bf0a5","238da2879813ca9c771414169b3189d46e8df94d","b8641aa14b8baf8fa1288ec273943b6d134d037d","878a9ed4062a56bbd866b9bfd133e2c7b2f350b1","89bb844c27783772210a68b390d87706c05e47d5","3b54da4e43cc61afb2de5a364d63462479a4d84d","ffad4ed2aea86c0bd1e42e7a8161e6f236ed5439","a57c0b1d47e2f3ef0ac14b2eff833f399951ae8a","95b348b0145e395174401fa0251d71e32b99e60c","ae757587ea9d9ded70c350de859147d5d6aa8491","983ef78249b767654df93f582e10ae0b4d721f4e"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"MMP gene polymorphisms as contributors for cleft lip/palate: association with MMP3 but not MMP1.","doi":"10.1016/j.archoralbio.2007.04.005","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.archoralbio.2007.04.005","venue":"Archives of oral biology"}

We examined the possibility that this NO system acts as an endothelium-derived relaxing factor (EDRF) in carp aorta using the carp aorta alone and in a combined carp-rat aorta donor-detector system. Use of the typical NO stimulating agent in mammal acetylcholine (ACh) only induced constriction of the carp aorta. This response was not modified by denudation or by NO synthesis inhibition with N-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester. Neither the indirect NO stimulating agents bradykinin and histamine nor the direct NO releasers sodium nitroprusside (SNP) and SIN-1 induced vasorelaxation. Both SNP and ACh elevated the cGMP concentration in rat aorta, but not in carp aorta. In the aorta combination set-up, where carp served as a NO donor and rat aorta served as a NO detector, no relaxation of the rat aorta was observed. The calcium ionophore A23187, a known EDRF producer in mammals, induced relaxation of carp aorta through an endothelium- and cyclooxygenase-dependent mechanism. These results indicate that carp aorta does not produce NO as an EDRF nor does it respond to exogenously supplied NO. The major EDRF in carp is apparently a product(s) of cyclooxygenase metabolism.","inCitations":["0067d0dc6e601f66f171306b9b51178d277ab4af","7f4994014edf4d506dd3962a30b2f5412e3fd923","8df175f2a32ee0cb79ec7d8639751563967784e8","ef7e032f0601fb00deb50a9cc4b1643ed0c5a140","9050c45336013d04546868a0badaaf36a3b5d4e7","190a8098bba680cb13fb43df5ea9b44a1271d56f","a65433df3229d70dcb1a7d33fda79eb878d32002","aaa34ddedbe9f75ff0fc0e62f525897aef628475"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Cyclooxygenase-derived products, rather than nitric oxide, are endothelium-derived relaxing factor(s) in the ventral aorta of carp (Cyprinus carpio).","doi":"10.1016/S0305-0491(00)00264-9","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/S0305-0491%2800%2900264-9","venue":"Comparative biochemistry and physiology.

La taxonomie deduite de ces definitions classe les echelles mesurant le syndrome de la depression en trois categories, a savoir: - echelles a un volet de temps: echelles de mal-etre, - echelles a deux volets de temps: echelles de depression-vecue et echelles de qualite de vie- intrinseque, - echelles a trois volets de temps. L'echelle synoptique des trois temps ES3T reunit trois types d'echelles: 40 items disposes sur un axe vertical y etudient la depression selon trois volets de temps: passe, present, futur inscrits sur un axe horizontal. Les diverses etudes metrologiques basees sur un echantillon de 110 sujets depressifs montrent que l'ES3T a des qualites tres satisfaisantes.

Until recently assessments of pill risks and benefits often traded the health benefits of preventing unwanted pregnancy against direct adverse effects on the cardiovascular system. The protection against cancer provided by the pill more than outweighs the low risks of cardiovascular disease in younger women while in older women the reverse is true. A high contraceptive prevalence helps to bring down mortality especially maternal mortality; a Family Health International Study shows that the death rate among women using contraceptives in a traditional society is half that of those not using a contraceptive method. The idea that the availability of the means to control fertility encourages promiscuous sexual bahavior is strongly held by some groups but has not been demonstrated. The world is slowly learning to adjust mans reproductive potential to new patterns of mortality but methods of fertility control--especially hormonal contraceptives--carry with them a range of risks and benefits. Modern contraceptives are necessary for 2 reasons: 1) they adjust achieved family size by lowering infant mortality so that an adult couple can be succeeded by 2 children who survive to reproduce in the next generation and 2) they replace the pregnancy spacing once achieved by long intervals of breastfeeding. Overall the pill may be as philosophically important as it has been in the range of its clinical action and in its significance to individuals.

A desire to change, often triggered by a pivotal event, was important in turning away from risk behaviours. Other contributing factors included the negative impact of drug abuse, leadership and social skills, academic competence, access to social support and religious beliefs. Maintaining a prosocial life style was supported by giving back to others and an effective substance abuse programme.

As yet, however, there has been an absence of research on this phenomenon in adults with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The current study examined the association between ADHD symptoms and mental health discrimination in the general adult population.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThe analytic sample comprised 7274 individuals aged 18 and above residing in private households in England that were drawn from the Adult Psychiatric Morbidity Survey, 2007. Information on ADHD was obtained with the Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale (ASRS) Screener. A single-item question was used to assess mental health discrimination experienced in the previous 12 months. Logistic regression analysis was used to examine associations.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe prevalence of discrimination increased as ADHD symptoms increased but was especially elevated in those with the most severe ADHD symptoms (ASRS score 18-24). In a multivariable logistic regression analysis that was adjusted for a variety of covariates including common mental disorders, ADHD symptoms (ASRS ≥ 14) were associated with almost 3 times higher odds for experiencing mental health discrimination (odds ratio: 2.81, 95% confidence interval: 1.49-5.31).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nADHD symptoms are associated with higher odds for experiencing mental health discrimination and this association is especially elevated in those with the most severe ADHD symptoms. Interventions to inform the general public about ADHD may be important for reducing the stigma and discrimination associated with this disorder in adults.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder symptoms and perceived mental health discrimination in adults in the general population.","doi":"10.1016/j.eurpsy.2018.12.004","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eurpsy.2018.12.004","venue":"European psychiatry : the journal of the Association of European Psychiatrists"}

The monitoring of adverse drug reactions (ADR) through active pharmacovigilance is vital to patient safety. The new oral anticoagulants dabigatran etexilate and rivaroxaban were added to the hospital form of our hospital in 2012 and were included in a system of active pharmacovigilance implemented by the pharmaceutical services, to assess the safety profile. Purpose To identify and classify adverse drug reactions (ADRs) of the new oral anticoagulants dabigatran etexilate and rivaroxaban through a system of active pharmacovigilance. Materials and methods From September 2012 to April 2013, a prospective study was conducted at the university teaching hospital Cova da Beira Hospitalar Centre, Covilha, Portugal. The study included inpatients and outpatients followed by the clotting service of our Hospital, treated with dabigatran etexilate or rivaroxaban. Questionnaires were sent to doctors and nurses regarding inpatients treated with drugs or who discontinued the treatment and/or required symptomatic treatment of ADRs. Questionnaires were also given to outpatients, completed with information from the doctor. The information obtained regarding patient demographic data, diagnosis, suspected ADR and concomitant drugs was recorded in the active pharmacovigilance printed form by a hospital pharmacist. ADR severity and causal relation was classified according to Portuguese Pharmacovigilance System criteria. Results The study included 67 patients, 41 of whom were treated with dabigatran (average age of 71, 25 male) and 26 patients with rivaroxaban (average age of 62.5, 13 male). Dabigatran was used for prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in adult patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation with one or more risk factors. In this group, 27 patients reported adverse events (65.8%). 61 ADR were reported by patients, the most common being gastrointestinal adverse effects (64%), 10 episodes of bleeding (16.3%) mostly not serious. Two ADR were considered serious (3.3%) corresponding to two cases of gastrointestinal bleeding, requiring discontinuation of dabigatran treatment and administration of activated prothrombin complex concentrates; both patients recovered. A causal relationship was likely (86.8%). Rivaroxaban was used for primary prevention of venous thromboembolism in patients undergoing elective total elective arthroplasty of hip or knee. In this group, 12 patients reported adverse events (46%). 59 ADR were reported by patients, the most common being gastrointestinal adverse effects (44%), 4 episodes of bleeding (6.7%) none considered serious after medical evaluation. One was considered a severe ADR (1.7%) corresponding to a case of rash which required discontinuation of treatment. A causal relationship was likely (81.4%). All ADR detected were documented in the drugs summary. Conclusions The ADR detected were mostly not serious, gastrointestinal symptoms being the most common. We identified 6.7% of non-serious bleeding associated with rivaroxaban and 16.5% of bleeding associated with dabigatran, of which 3.3% were considered severe gastrointestinal haemorrhages. No conflict of interest.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"PS-024 Monitoring of adverse drug reactions in patients treated with new oral anticoagulants","doi":"10.1136/ejhpharm-2013-000436.375","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1136/ejhpharm-2013-000436.375","venue":""}

Feedback from one-on-one interviews was compiled and distributed to participants who selected key topics. Topics chosen formed the basis for the discussions of this multidisciplinary panel that reviewed data on the safety of analgesics, particularly in regard to comorbidity and concurrent use with other therapies.\n\n\nMAIN MESSAGE\nTreatment should begin with an effective analgesic with the best safety profile at the lowest dose and escalate to higher doses and different analgesics as required. Acetaminophen is a safe medication that should be considered first-line therapy. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are associated with potential adverse gastrointestinal, renal, hepatic, and cardiovascular effects. Physicians should not prescribe NSAIDs before taking a careful history and doing a physical examination so they have the information they need to weigh the risks (adverse effects and potential drug interactions) and benefits for individual patients.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nTaking a complete and accurate history and doing a physical examination are essential for choosing the safest analgesic for a particular patient.","inCitations":["9764c7f24e0466b135540ca5bb657ac8f2aec2b6","23c7a5149f3c0bbb03bf54e10e6fca3430221332","eeecd453012d7c7f4cdae670de284fa885947c05","69fdd61abaa5e8e1981ce6610156f2a89e88bb52","019961b4302dc7d7c886fd482d1c1f4fdce44de5","83f5a80da59e03bd21551063a55309d1e445158d","e239c5d140794cab3ad59c42de6a5992184b6cb6","aa415aa7be80cccddd33e008e25f41fe77531060","0e901d77d8cdd758ab565632b5086b91fec86ef9","469d06b8349b0f33a56d580c79e278144aceb76c","f206ffe563a516e473cb8c998cc97ec550764f5e","1feca61a705918f8e5ad21399c1bceb70d3f447f","f699541b313c6b6c538c3f308d69ac7958b8cb80","17e5c6853414c2988d7d289da0ac40c3bac0720b","4e6a35c3c3e856e2094476e1c1297c44a1203dad","e83f170f0986ce0052196332a13e635f8c295bd5"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.cfp.ca/content/cfp/53/7/1177.full.pdf"],"title":"Approach to managing musculoskeletal pain: acetaminophen, cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors, or traditional NSAIDs?","doi":"","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"Canadian family physician Medecin de famille canadien"}

Initial rates of OTA uptake into S2 segments were saturable and adequately described by Michaelis-Menten kinetics, with an apparent Km of 2.2+/-0.3 microM (SEM). Several lines of evidence indicated that peritubular uptake of OTA in S2 segments was effectively limited to the \"classical\" organic anion transporter. First, 5 mM p-aminohippurate (PAH) cis-inhibited the uptake of 1 microM OTA into tubules by 96%. Kinetic analysis of the inhibition of OTA uptake by PAH (100 microM to 5 mM) yielded an apparent Ki of 164 microM, similar to the 100 to 200 microM range of Km values previously reported for the peritubular uptake of PAH. Second, efflux of OTA from tubules was trans-stimulated 3.2-fold by the presence of 2.5 mM PAH in the uptake medium. Third, 100 microM alpha-ketoglutarate (alphaKG) trans-stimulated the uptake rate of 1 microM OTA by 1.8-fold. Fourth, besides PAH, other organic anions effectively cis-inhibited the uptake of 1 microM OTA into tubules (inhibitor, % inhibition): 1.5 mM alphaKG, 80%; 1 mM probenecid, 100%; 1 mM piroxicam, 100%; 1 mM octanoate, 100%. In contrast, 1.5 mM tetraethylammonium, an organic cation, blocked uptake of 1 microM OTA by only 7%. The inhibition of OTA uptake into S1 and S3 segments of the proximal tubule was qualitatively similar: 5 mM PAH cis-inhibited the uptake of 1 microM OTA by approximately 95% in both S1 and S3 segments. Thus, peritubular OTA uptake into all segments of the proximal tubule appears to be dominated by its interaction with the classical organic anion transporter. The high-affinity and relatively high capacity of this pathway for OTA suggest that peritubular uptake may be a significant avenue for the entry of this toxin into proximal tubule cells.","inCitations":["15fdb962f3c082148c2edaac2490b6a1513a7fdd","609bc1768abdc87d13efa2b7ecc18226b2d9b23d","44e18456977a61a589ad97b660939c6eff0897f4","9719f9c36e3e4f97fad00fd8d4e3e6d8d9bd6c4f","93321aed9121dfe7cb72b1df15b5356e447c4539","6619b13b85737a975bec54e6e5a45210c2f8ff16","4e9356d87a723ffebc26d2f3ae68384ce64b8ab5","99436fc5fff6a534c29c034da154205b94b3e06e","a624946fee7d4227236b6b02bf3de6c90c5928d8","938d4d2dc397f06080f8d88fe86056794ba0a166","31e530bf5be747ad61ef1fe822dd59acaf23d13f"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Peritubular transport of ochratoxin A by single rabbit renal proximal tubules.","doi":"","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"Journal of the American Society of Nephrology : JASN"}

By 2009, one-third of microfinance clients in the country had at least two loans and were unable to make on-time repayments.

In the first study, anesthetized miniature pigs were given DXS alone, DXS plus BAY x 4620 in various doses, or saline. As expected, DXS alone produced a profound but transient systemic arterial hypotension with a concomitant reduction in kininogen. Circulating kinin levels, complement fragment des-Arg-C3a, and fibrin monomer were all increased. Treatment with BAY x 4620 produced a dose-dependent attenuation of these effects with complete blockade of the hypotension as well as the observed biochemical changes at the highest dose (360 mg). In a second study, two groups of pigs were given either DXS alone or DXS plus Hoe-140. DXS-induced hypotension was completely blocked by Hoe-140 pretreatment; however, kininogen was again depleted. We conclude, therefore, that DXS-induced hypotension is produced by activation of plasma kallikrein that results in the production of bradykinin and that liberation of bradykinin and its action on B2 receptors in the vasculature are both necessary and sufficient to produce the observed effects on circulatory pressure.","inCitations":["488869bd4fed7db0f1bfcd553a3b920f119997ce","1928b7d7fb922e1e2816ef976b6c2d06583d5bbd","fe748ed1006c80e5f5eefe983a75920d81d57b0d","2a529161a8242036402da7955ea0925da94cd4d9","2f8e19ce562147066667a21701e2a667bb9b8077","affa5f08f73680c03b5328619f6150fcf991e613","326a95d8c9b03e3f30ee37abe901f27897d80ff4","e7c5fd3761d623de0be57eb7e9e3cdb5b6ec30cd","d58c74aee1f5fec90f170370289bff0b2d26bdfd","1d2f58e8033cb9dbeef0346069c558c0a87da096","b50f8d8af39670c379e34f9eaa3b1e7ad574e686","f81a9b12974309aca6a1bb0012d7c473ccabf325","6809b12207b3bb7d12cdbef330845e78cd79421e","1a8488f31b321564d43188776078f907ba5003f0","d093aa9cf8e5119f6fe344ed7d07c0cc7356a509","b19e2080dbd69f7e29f92bff2ad5c670afcee7f8","3e6f611d926c6829198e404be3536819dbf7e458","d12097e828e64ade01468a2294f016d7028561d6","4ea5e3aadb98eb5453d835230c148016ac491812","85778320c5455e6201f63f0d0f4057f1e9384525","9c8d13c5303a79c894fbba48532436525991970c","917825aee4af11249a14591abb764faeab1fa047","b1f279974122f74ff2cc11c420dcfa78c8ded7ee","e31eb93e7ef74556cc8c323de2608c80e2063e61"],"pdfUrls":["https://epub.ub.uni-muenchen.de/9795/1/9795.pdf"],"title":"Dextran sulfate activates contact system and mediates arterial hypotension via B2 kinin receptors.","doi":"10.1152/jappl.1994.77.6.2675","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1152/jappl.1994.77.6.2675","venue":"Journal of applied physiology"}

Ten countries had petroleum production; this totaled 1,689,090,000 bbl (4,627,648 b/d), a decrease of 2.8% from the previous year. The volume decline came mainly in Venezuela, the major producer of the region (76.7% of the total), where production was down 4.3% to 3,549,000 b/d. Production increased moderately in Argentina, Chile, and Brazil, and Bolivia's temporarily disrupted operations made a strong recovery; but downward trends in Peru and Trinidad continued, and Colombia's production was off slightly from a record 1970 level. Total drilling decreased to 1,887 wells, 91 less than in 1970; but the number of exploration wells was 410, up by 20. Exploration drilling was carried out in 18 countries, but no new countries came into commercial production. Party-months of geologic and geophysical field work were: surface geology, 212 (329 in 1970); seismograph, 671 (659); gravity, 53 (51); and magnetometer, 5.0 (12.6). Successful exploration drilling continued in eastern Ecuador and in eastern offshore Trinidad; heavy development drilling was done in several of the discovery areas; and first export production from the new major fields will come in 1972. The high level of 1970 exploration drilling effort on the Brazil continental shelf was maintained through 1971. Additional offshore drilling in Argentina and off the east coast of Nicaragua was disappointing; and results of first tests in the northern offshore Trinidad permits, and on the outer shelf of Guyana and of Surinam, have been only moderately encouraging. The major acreage development of 1971 was the signing of the first service contracts in Peru, followed by several more in early 1972. A further highlight was formal award of the south-central Lake Maracaibo contract areas. Private companies did not acquire significant amounts of new exploration acreage elsewhere in South America during the year.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Petroleum Developments in South America, Central America, and Caribbean Area in 1971","doi":"10.1306/819A410E-16C5-11D7-8645000102C1865D","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1306/819A410E-16C5-11D7-8645000102C1865D","venue":""}

This mast cell hyperresponsiveness might help explain why patients with a genetic disease known as Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome (SLOS) are prone to food allergies. \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 1 \n \nDegranulation is enhanced in mast cells lacking the enzyme that reduces 7-dehydrocholesterol (DHCR KO). \n \n \n \n \nPatients with SLOS have abnormally low levels of circulating cholesterol—and a corresponding abundance of the cholesterol precursor 7-dehydrocholesterol (DHC)—due to defects in the gene that encodes the DHC-reducing enzyme (DHCR7). This cholesterol deficiency causes a bevy of developmental defects, consistent with the known requirement for cholesterol during embryonic development. \n \nBut the allergic manifestations of SLOS are poorly understood. Kovarova and colleagues suspected that mast cells—the principle allergy-triggering cell type—might be involved, as mast cells rely on the proper distribution of cholesterol-rich lipid rafts in their membranes for appropriate activation and deactivation. \n \nTheir hunch was right. Mast cells from Dhcr7-deficient mice were hyperactive compared with wild-type cells, as measured by increased degranulation and proinflammatory cytokine production upon activation. But to their surprise, the deficient cells had normal numbers of lipid rafts—although the abundance of DHC and paucity of cholesterol made the rafts less stable than normal. \n \nThe destabilized rafts contained fewer molecules of the kinase Lyn, leading to a decrease in the Lyn-dependent activation of Csk-binding protein, a negative regulator of the degranulation-stimulating kinase Fyn. Depleting wild-type cells of cholesterol had the same activation-enhancing effect, which was reversed when cholesterol was added back. But adding cholesterol to the Dhcr7-deficient cells had minimal effect, suggesting that the activation defect was caused by the accumulation of DHC, rather than the depletion of cholesterol. \n \nThese results suggest that patients with other diseases involving defects in cholesterol biosynthesis might be more prone to allergies—a possibility that remains to be tested.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Loose lipid rafts lead to trigger-happy mast cells","doi":"10.1084/jem.2035iti2","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1084/jem.2035iti2","venue":""}

Such stages are what they recognize as achievements to them. However, as women, they do also face challenges. Looking at women achievements and challenges with a gender lens, requires narrowing the inquiry on how patriarchy ideology can influences the two. This work serves to explain how patriarchy ideology determines what rural-urban women migrants regards as achievement; the challenges they face and efforts they make to release themselves from such challenges. In-depth interview was conducted among the Gogo rural-urban women migrants in both Dodoma town and Dar es Salaam city. This aimed at enhancing the respondents to build up their life stories as regards their experiences within patriarchy system in their areas of origin, the way they negotiated through it and how it influenced their integration process in destination areas. It was found out that for women migrants, acquiring whatever they missed within patriarchy system in rural areas is an achievement for them. However, women migrants are still surrounded by patriarchy system in town which becomes sources of challenges in their integration process in town. Moreover, the patriarchy ideology among women and the society at large in town, do affect they way women fight against challenges the face. This implies that patriarchy ideology has got its roots in every place where men are, be it in rural areas or in town. In order to eliminate its intended negative impact over women, much effort has to be directed toward educating men on the need of gender equality in society for their benefit and the society at large. Women will hardly find their right within a strong patriarchy system wherever they are.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Reflections of Patriarchy Ideology in the Achievements and Challenges Faced by Women Migrants in Town","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Nanobiotechnology offers possible solutions to several key constraints of agricultural production systems, which is evident from the recent research developments. Nanomaterials are often considered to be ‘smart delivery systems’ and exhibit unique and varied functions; therefore, nanoparticle-mediated plant genetic engineering, nanofertilizers, nanopesticides and nanosensors find potential applications in agricultural systems, which could substantially contribute to sustainable agriculture.

Once operational, it will provide an unprecedented combination of angular resolution, sensitivity and field of view. Its layer-oriented MCAO systems (one for each arm of the interferometer) are conjugated to the ground layer and an additional layer in the upper atmosphere. In this contribution MCAO wavefront control is discussed in the context of the overall control scheme for LINC-NIRVANA. Special attention is paid to a set of auxiliary control tasks which are mandatory for MCAO operation: The Fields of View of each wavefront sensor in the instrument have to be derotated independent from each other and independently from the science field. Any wavefront information obtained by the sensors has to be matched to the time invariant modes of the deformable mirrors in the system. The tip/tilt control scheme is outlined, in which atmospheric, but also instrumental tip/tilt corrections are sensed with the high layer wavefront sensor and corrected by the adaptive secondary mirror of the LBT. Slow image motion effects on the science detector have to be considered, which are caused by flexure in the non-common path between AO and the science camera, atmospheric differential refraction, and alignment tolerances of the derotators. Last but not least: The sensor optics (pyramids) have to be accurately positioned at the images of natural reference stars.","inCitations":["3ebcf6e95f852f73f1bb8d220d85631c833c68bc","d359f20518cb831316563316782be811019f4bb7","322ba8f348a8fcefcc86405d9337b76cdfd82a4d","28b0c843bd5285ff4070d2be69dc0342160544f3"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"The MCAO systems within LINC-NIRVANA: control aspects beyond wavefront correction","doi":"10.1117/12.857097","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1117/12.857097","venue":"Astronomical Telescopes + Instrumentation"}

One of the most important assumptions is that traits are controlled by many genes of small effect. This leads to a prediction of a Gaussian trait distribution in the population, via the Central Limit Theorem. Since these biological assumptions are often unknown or untrue, we characterized how finite numbers of loci or large mutational effects can impact the sampling distribution of a quantitative trait. To do so, we developed a neutral coalescent-based framework, allowing us to gain a detailed understanding of how number of loci and the underlying mutational model impacts the distribution of a quantitative trait. Through both analytical theory and simulation we found the normality assumption was highly sensitive to the details of the mutational process, with the greatest discrepancies arising when the number of loci was small or the mutational kernel was heavy-tailed. In particular, skewed mutational effects will produce skewed trait distributions and fat-tailed mutational kernels result in multimodal sampling distributions, even for traits controlled by a large number of loci. Since selection models and robust neutral models may produce qualitatively similar sampling distributions, we advise extra caution should be taken when interpreting model-based results for poorly understood systems of quantitative traits.","inCitations":["5fe86c044cb40bd2f9cd1bbeffccac7e1906f54e","e4f362f85fa6781d0e942f5b6be32135333fa35e","b0c5a63d054f8de5150067ca5e85e886d2a33673","d8280cb558bcc03e9b8af7c9f11203e2b3b58be8","956d151f9fa70cdef8566f948f164d7f8601dd51","1285b0e64b50c4e30b1ad0a6711c4faa0a517dab","a4559d9c775e5b0310f1baf6de88e1469d30842c","66ffc501fde122614bdee453c64f9e592ced1f9e","628f6c2bf868463e4531f4c3e2062a9e9e4def12","f83f26cdc015553c76dc0826f9c0208b576c27ef"],"pdfUrls":["https://landislab.github.io/assets/research/pdf/Schraiber_Landis_2014_TPB_quant_coalescent.pdf"],"title":"Sensitivity of quantitative traits to mutational effects and number of loci.","doi":"10.1016/j.tpb.2015.03.005","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tpb.2015.03.005","venue":"Theoretical population biology"}

As the authors indicated, the algorithms employed to calculate the area of the 95% prediction ellipse using the chi-square or the Rayleigh distribution are in fact only exact when the number of samples of the bivariate variable tends to infinite (when each univariate variable is assumed to have a normal distribution) [2]. As the authors also observed, for a typical data size in posturography, 30 s of data sampled at 100 Hz (3000 samples), this approximation is probably good enough, since the error is only 0.1%. The problem appears when the data size is much less: for 100 samples, the error is 2.5%, and for 10 samples, the error is 26%. These last two cases are unlikely scenarios in posturography, but possible for an unadvised user; and besides, the prediction ellipse area can be employed in any other data analysis. The authors described the calculation (see the supplementary data in [1]) but did not publish any algorithm to compute the exact 95% prediction ellipse area. They only made available the algorithm with the known approximation (i.e., they used the chi-square distribution and not the F distribution for the exact calculation).

The concept of organizational buying behavior was clarified with a specific focus on Kazakhstan construction companies. Issues related to the construction and concrete markets in particular were explored. The main issues related to the situation in the construction market in general were studied, including topics such as the decision making process, factors affecting decision making, current economical and construction trends, and the Kazakhstan construction market. Since August 2007 construction volumes in the Republic had a continuous decrease stemming from the financial world crisis. As a result, the volumes of the concrete market decreased down the chain.

The Tower of London-Drexel (TOL(DX)) was administered to normal control (NC; N = 56) and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD; N = 99) children (ages 7 to 12) to determine whether age-related changes in performance were evident, to gather normative data, and to evaluate the test-retest reliability and criterion-validity of the measure. The results revealed age-related changes in score performance, age-group normative data, an acceptable level of reliability and significant differences in performance of NC and ADHD subjects. Further, discriminant analysis classification rates determined that the TOL(DX) was sensitive and highly specific to ADHD. Implications and limitations of the study are discussed.","inCitations":["df42a236e6424dcd087094448b74e86595a92ae3","ff464fe4889a04d046b176958d8faaee15a2ca24","0f28542dabb3747e38037a48200482ea9d8c62ac","176000597be5cca46bc58f12d1576fb5100f0817","4b9bc1db44ae09a89a8a4395dd242eb636c82061","b796fbc2ffd8dbd7d404be9bbb38cecb94772fbc","2ca725ba02a7ca31347d18e97cb1fbe9325d75d2","6728ab580d0ac42d2006084555de86206e74eff7","0ab4e230b8e287efa170525fc93c3aaf1a6476ae","8b348af44dbd332741cb43677749995f28ee5b21","b42e66c843de3a0c8c3fc2ab1c2adb8d7bb06e21","134c1b775c7e34ab388142b5c1964fe52eceeb9b","16bd3b926c8d5a556a331f1d9a255f384592d3fb","600ec92f04c278904accf9ad483beccf42fc192e","0028e3245dc73b8ff0e3fed3da815fd3f8d294e0","fe91507fa6b66750181707dbd033f699e83d29c4","8e373996da6588b0820424e758b32a0d110287a5","fbe03e7246f9afed363b42288432a2779ad3f38c","b3c1766997be912164df4485fd28728ee3767cc8","a8e23138b2ab8d30357e6cd8396a0c948e7ebb0a","69fef11d167fc30b54d799931603b104c3a8f889","427fdf5664484950fd939b2b345c70b0fb9f101e","c83491ef606a3101137096705f2cb043ad396d42","8bc11be39eb7d3b67428bfbec3d724cfea285cde","6b865bac789ce607d624c2df8ba7005ab40d6264","00448152c45e9393c55184788919d619cf590e6b","70ad23df8e8c0aff825c6b8ec1b0dca8d0f50bac","0c1fbdb962c6a6bfb1a3bc73efb9a09dd939b93a","61ea9dab19390191df025cc33b93dbc3541aefa9","f6494016069a568250739c70703cb2680ccc2b1c","7eb19cd7aca7515b9e4f48687af5f116871c784f","51f264513fbebb13c6a06d36fc2e0b2ce0998764","490a675963b9e0347800dc9c251135c213dac016","0eb68e26540dd468fd1709a18cabfc2075c6d57a","10301caeaaabf436778f303ddbf972efc0959761","699875af97400b8145191f7236abdafd0e0b5ecb","25804e93f59bee1c5888bcc34790443d016c1b7e","088272e716bda37b6301b02f588cf6aacf035348","9f009727ee6752774d87272f6ac600bda9ae2b45","7a57db82fd639ea2c2e03c4c10f2b5aa8f5448cb","f5039d99eb887dc3b6ed7b479a4e1f735c6d5a32","597949ce0e822eb25225d29e9731fbd0510f3391","35db6f5e7fc819446efdef7ccf8fa84fe44615a0","025aef7cf6427b2eef95c273096eae5c5bb4a067","568a5479eb373c7857a342cb53b170fbfba2be57","41457a2152c64ad817c4997e52f6193060a10ac8","590026cd4f19815c648d288961ba7bf26b4d1f80","57766b47e767867b6a5d1347d0976dc42ec9ba38","1795c9a9c29ca2b8056333681faa4ccb94096c4d","643c81ab067cb5fdc15cd094f56a7effac6943c4","f8d469d9350c15c8e6a252a0e37d879ea9330277","94fe630fdb7a8a841cf315572831281f90abc8cf","2a3a48ad29bcde45fba31f5993c5e93c3d9f0d5d","e236ec35a0945ac9e7155bc9e8ec961a0dcf4a19","34c2df8707743176343059afe13a9e9b27099e29","3ae2e48063aaceb356c90ba6e10295bca8884a4f","7ca1d2c2ee9a210687ac86dbc51d0546342f06ec","f43292bf6c03f38089cd4c5542c574def2af58a1","bb9676542fedd775af9861604316cd15086812b2"],"pdfUrls":["https://watermark.silverchair.com/13-3-285.pdf?token=AQECAHi208BE49Ooan9kkhW_Ercy7Dm3ZL_9Cf3qfKAc485ysgAAAaEwggGdBgkqhkiG9w0BBwagggGOMIIBigIBADCCAYMGCSqGSIb3DQEHATAeBglghkgBZQMEAS4wEQQMbRIc0TH8UbnKDXz-AgEQgIIBVIMFhU6LFD3vMTb0XMQlggCkOjTK6P-6riKc-erlL3p60kKcQNPphD_uMimCva7K4dCHOif_9V2XtPzugXXAy_HtODLTrv5XTl3UzFUg398k8PIjBPoofK_AidTaAIgiO7dtFueaLzz3pKLsnCXzDJf5MseQJUjFQb5qwTOnIJ-TJ54RLVOapMcZh0oZ8HdMZ7zlVQC6Cm9nYb4d-S280-dk6PiMngYHUEBB1XwwCTT8qz14bW9gzhj-ZPcV2kOQLRKGlFp9-wFf6da6-RId8aAec9-MjOEDDtHGdsNWUDwHyk5ffl3XU2yyoDzL5mZL6cWvmSA1J8Ug2YhwhcD0Crh1dYTlFn7rPyMvVpojZPldTVOD3QZPBXzJD1cwWy_8pbuysVj1wT4Lu6n1-Te0Mu8h34IBKpJpuh2etLC1c3ps709aot_ZBaP6k3m4-tl8KA1mJ1Q"],"title":"The Tower of London(DX): a standardized approach to assessing executive functioning in children.","doi":"10.1016/S0887-6177(97)00033-4","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/S0887-6177%2897%2900033-4","venue":"Archives of clinical neuropsychology : the official journal of the National Academy of Neuropsychologists"}

Following a previous report on the qualitative application of C4D for fibers, the present study provides a thorough analysis of the signal response to fiber conductivity. Using reduced graphene oxide (RGO) fibers, the detector response as a function of fiber length, cross-sectional area and resistance has been investigated. To study the effect of insulating coatings, Parylene-coated RGO fibers were also investigated. In addition, measurements were performed in different coupling environments, such as in a capillary tube or air. The analysis of the measured data allowed the determination of the C4D conductivity of various RGO fibers, and the correlation with contact methods through empirical relationships to be determined. It was found that the detection limit and sensitivity of resistance measurements are mainly dependent on the sensor design, and also on the fiber properties. The detection threshold can be defined as the ratio of the coupling impedance to fiber resistance. In our case, the detection limit was found for impedance ratios equal to 14. This limit sets a functioning mode in C4D for fibers, which may be used as an area or resistance detector for the impedance ratio above or below the detection threshold. A semi-log linear response of the fiber resistance to the voltage output was found for impedance ratios between 2.66 and 0.63. These impedance ratios may serve as a reference for designing C4D, depending on the fibers to be tested and the analytical information needed. In summary, we suggest that C4D has the capacity to emerge as a new characterisation tool for micron-sized fibers, due to its applicability to any conductive material, ease of use, and the contactless nature of the measurement.","inCitations":["d39cb84fe5fc807f2983ab25f59d0375e98db106"],"pdfUrls":["https://ro.uow.edu.au/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3948&context=aiimpapers"],"title":"Quantitative characterisation of conductive fibers by capacitive coupling.","doi":"10.1039/c7an00442g","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1039/c7an00442g","venue":"The Analyst"}

In our laboratory, we are interested in the geometrical distribution of coronary capillaries. Traditionally, capillary supply has been characterized only by measures of capillary density, from which it is possible to calculate average inter-capillary distance (ICD). The deficiency in such a calculation is the assumption of a uniform distribution of capillaries. The heterogeneity of inter-capillary spacing is clearly an important factor in myocardial oxygenation, over and above average ICD. Methods for assessing the heterogeneity of capillary spacing, and it’s effect on myocardial oxygenation have been recently analyzed (Rakusan and Turek, 1985 and Turek et. al., 1987). Another important parameter for modelling oxygen transport is the knowledge of the direction of blood flow in adjacent capillaries. Our recent application of coloured microspheres, for the analysis of myocardial flow pattern, revealed a predominance of concurrent flow in neighboring capillaries (Reeves and Rakusan, 1987). Nonetheless, a uniformity in flow direction does not ensure that the spatial position and P02 values of neighboring capillaries are synchronous. One may envision a situation where the transverse arteriole furnishes capillaries at staggered levels in the tissue.","inCitations":["6bb530b4326a52c7f3106396df63a8543e8ef091","012f1ccf4c3ec14cf9f398b31d2732f0cc08e638","059705fcedff19535095d3b72a2477565fbf6c95","18e0b47039841b49f311c4db32ab2d79b696c156","6e087e0f75ddd277e010c43402d82cef314e5236","14acf275ebe16e1831e7d58d542b578e928f83ce","95e506805a0d73d3bfcb2f49a2c765ad349696b1","57fb5e4a7db2ed3974357a005a89bb66ef8da807"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Spatial distribution of coronary capillaries: A-V segment staggering.","doi":"10.1007/978-1-4684-5643-1_28","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4684-5643-1_28","venue":"Advances in experimental medicine and biology"}

This study evaluated the efficacy and durability of covered stents in treating CVOD to preserve a functional dialysis access circuit.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA retrospective review was performed of all patients with clinically significant CVOD who were treated by placement of covered stents from April 2007 to September 2010. Demographics, lesion locations and anatomic characteristics, stent graft, and access patency rates were determined. Complications, reinterventions, and factors influencing their outcomes were examined.\n\n\nRESULTS\nIn 25 patients (56% men; mean age, 57 ± 29 years) with CVOD, covered stents were used in 20 to treat symptomatic venous hypertension or in 5 at the time of access creation to enable functionality. The target lesion was accessed via the dialysis access site or the common femoral vein. The Viabahn endoprosthesis (W. L. Gore and Associates, Flagstaff, Ariz) was used in 24 patients (average size and length, 11 mm × 5 cm) and a 13-mm × 5-cm Fluency covered stent (Bard Peripheral Vascular, Tempe, Ariz) was implanted in 1 patient. Technical success was 100%, and resolution of arm edema occurred after covered stent deployment in symptomatic patients. Two postprocedural cases (8%) of thrombosis occurred, one within 30 days and another at 3 months. Both required percutaneous thrombectomy and percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA). Three additional patients (12%) required PTA due to restenosis in one of the ends of the device. Covered stent primary patency (PP), assisted primary patency (APP), and secondary patency (SP) were 56%, 86%, and 100% at 12 months, respectively. Access patency rates at 12 months were 29%, 85%, and 94% for PP, APP, and SP, respectively, in patients that received a covered stent for access salvage; patency rates were 74%, 85%, and 94% for PP, APP, and SP, respectively, in patients in whom the access was created after the venous outflow restoration.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nPlacement of covered stents for hemodialysis-related CVOD is safe, effective in relieving symptoms, and enabled functionality of new dialysis access circuits. Further prospective and randomized studies are necessary to determine whether covered stents provide superior long-term results to those achieved with PTA and bare metal stents.","inCitations":["e17ebce841d5c713df771641e12a34fa1d300b36","dbf6398daaa9a58eaaa1ed2a5149174c7241c265","2f550027a6408ea4511cd1e32faa97797f758ff4","4167b6906fb257323fec0541e7fd06c5dd70b314","11e53de6d180e45ca1e5c7533ca9502027324a94","59eb956d9e0d664951770884a10e09fc2eaa60bb","a2852c7c0e998cf93555479a90ad404a96bef5ca","764f0752ebf5a09677e072dbfe535a7d4e525c3c","92ea26576a5fa0e2fe459c4b65e7771121af9ecd","7901fec4bdeaf2281b7bcc58dc86f983e32cbf59","9eefb8cd89f6d85c47def08f8fdc04b2f5782cd2","31b54ce0f7289c3a4e278460dfd15772e9a4c696","f09ac2c1e349310c99f8f8062d35881c64840754","b2e4fbff8342e1a9ea30ac7257af654fe34d7158","2dc7cd15e4adb5ab67feb69d8931eaf5b7bf7250","c2560857e25655f4dd611895f78796ea681fb31c","e23db2226681f81e3df6154e02f7ef2776c22fb7","1132dc12e1b45e85a5267507c5ad2935f863de99","41714f1e582a0d7b685d6b0861e4ae5b73dddbf9","1b324f301705aed447c898d27431ed5a09638fb9","eaefa40f4744825751d2ef8f8daf8b746d35f748","ba3dec9e3bf03b097cc9b9a5575ce7ea06e140e5","a51ed1bfd92ceee4dce35304627202c76da61fce","58f5ad104589bdf83ac4980bac029d9f78eb775a","900a671242bdc196995c82c851ff854efd1b7225","40f09c1978c1aca39b202f3ea0ea0103059c3cca","240a183e9ce9e183627498d1d60facd39bd932b7","71b33ee132e46482d38bf8803404ad0964035751","d5eb3092f68979d7ccc8bd49d846caec14ff8e13","58c3f3bed9c83aa0e3ace6c1227b5cf035ad4ecc","0d7d99b66517583c3ad29d1c843049655c375703","a150812fadad4b9cc21f0c1129c6bbcba226b125","d80ac959c4b33be77e1cb60a9a8bb9992425a38f","5312ca852fe4fb9a9d1173353cc46863cb62850d","c40c379492d70a84b332c63aca8ca169b0117afd","5f5d2c550981ca1c5ced77539b8292bf27f34a98","9659ebc5fc4cabe69c72c5bcad9de99d503827bd","4593da00862664a0376cb81138f7360425cc8ab8"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Efficacy of covered stent placement for central venous occlusive disease in hemodialysis patients.","doi":"10.1016/j.jvs.2011.03.260","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jvs.2011.03.260","venue":"Journal of vascular surgery"}

These 2 dural layers join together in most parts of the skull base and cranial convexity, and separate into the orbital and perisellar compartments or into the spinal epidural space to form the extradural neural axis compartment (EDNAC). The EDNAC contains fat and/or venous blood. The aim of this dissection study was to anatomically verify the concept of the EDNAC by focusing on the dural layers surrounding the jugular foramen area. METHODS The authors injected 10 cadaveric heads (20 jugular foramina) with colored latex and fixed them in formalin. The brainstem and cerebellum of 7 specimens were cautiously removed to allow a superior approach to the jugular foramen. Special attention was paid to the meningeal architecture of the jugular foramen, the petrosal inferior sinus and its venous confluence with the sigmoid sinus, and the glossopharyngeal, vagus, and accessory nerves. The 3 remaining heads were bleached with a 20% hydrogen peroxide solution. This procedure produced softening of the bone without modifying the fixed soft tissues, thus permitting coronal and axial dissections. RESULTS The EDNAC of the jugular foramen was limited by the endosteal and meningeal layers and contained venous blood. These 2 dural layers joined together at the level of the petrous and occipital bones and separated at the inferior petrosal sinus and the sigmoid sinus, and around the lower cranial nerves, to form the EDNAC. Study of the dural sheaths allowed the authors to describe an original compartmentalization of the jugular foramen in 3 parts: 2 neural compartments-glossopharyngeal and vagal-and the interperiosteodural compartment. CONCLUSIONS In this dissection study, the existence of the EDNAC concept in the jugular foramen was demonstrated, leading to the proposal of a novel 3-part compartmentalization, challenging the classical 2-part compartmentalization, of the jugular foramen.","inCitations":["809fa48adacb1ca1cfbf2983edb9e7afd7798150"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"The interperiosteodural concept applied to the jugular foramen and its compartmentalization.","doi":"10.3171/2017.1.JNS161890","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.3171/2017.1.JNS161890","venue":"Journal of neurosurgery"}

Rabbits were anesthetized with isoflurane. The MAC was determined by skin incision on the lateral aspect of the chest; clamping of the tail, paw of the forelimb, and paw of the hind limb; and application of electrical current to the oral mucosa (dogs only), forelimb, and hind limb. The MAC was the end-tidal concentration midway between the value permitting and preventing purposeful movement in response to noxious stimuli.\n\n\nRESULTS\nIn dogs, mean +/- SEM MAC for isoflurane was 1.27 +/- 0.05% for clamping stimuli, 1.36 +/- 0.04% for oral electrical stimulation, 1.35 +/- 0.04% for electrical stimulation to the limbs, and 1.01 +/- 0.07% for surgical incision. The MAC for halothane was 0.97 +/- 0.03% for tail clamping, 0.96 +/- 0.03% for clamping of the limbs, 1.04 +/- 0.03% for electrical stimulation, and 0.75 +/- 0.06% for surgical incision. In rabbits, MAC for isoflurane was 2.08 +/- 0.02% for clamping stimuli, 2.04 +/- 0.02% for electrical stimulation, and 0.90 +/- 0.02% for surgical incision. The MAC for surgical incision was significantly lower than values for the other methods in both species.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE\nUse of electrical current and clamping techniques resulted in similar MAC values. Surgical incision underestimated MAC values in dogs and rabbits.","inCitations":["7e9ba21a501f62f6069d77949d769689f5355546","0320359908155a2c6cca0c0bef5ce491442cf948","24b9f60b1d99d87a78446bab93d70f21cfc426a8","580342da11aa818423e21636593e720a902c4f4c","b079632a02198e243220ce68cf0415253016ee6f","fd5d611f4c331d83abb33b2eac2bfeff58d83135","a4ea240b15ed4fd0d3bc7819d90b9a8cb60c3f9d","1e31d8111a4ef33e5ac8079d95e1a692eec6fb34","fbfba57b130861f08fa9f3872cabe20abe840fdb","16af415c5faf429c068f2e7d5cb23a3e2bc4e27c","ab4357b78a9505e41eb4dcc85cbfc15703ebe937","d6d0d3304e0e32d2cad2242a1f0f8f8535de78e0","06f2a892c0ad14803c699d808b9f5a00d7060e2e","21df3de5512796d5774a24d6f2cbd92325b5eb0d","179d09f59f0f0cf07df7f588d467c776ad02cf75","720f03a27557d8bafbdc8b1e7b3fae315b6b5cd4","2ef066f8c9e8b81b03f3cebd5f7bf92ba372f7cd","a0f9746c89e892aa8668f00454b0309d43557100","0cc996d010b994b699119cd841b80a1bed17cda6","78f7281edef9157357ebc141acf3acea3a917f43","53c94d6f8f19422639f5030125368a0943fa5bea","f77c84a359fffedd46caa292ad97b0802418c9a3","70d0760d833e26d4d16cb9866641f9a1ea84e68b","e76ad7a24078442e67c1e2ff2c8f7c4a61d413e7","914459be36e23079ec21ee5921e1c0011e8d0bb6","59210da0137a00c9fcc30dfc15db7ba049562222","fe8c79a12d380eb406fd0a1e334afa72f992cd21","976e9a7a2c613761f7bc560fe42f41600c2cfd90","81d9d32e8aa47abca2d2d0ef3dc65815b62a57d0","d80cf0c0ec8c690b9b69aee7ed3de3b42d5e6c89","f0d731dbbd4b15d2adeb9fcbb7120e6ea1af0f80","2d93fe23f91d474f11e9fb3548d3c6b9a543f527","65d75021e922adfe48131a1769d6848d5d585d30","634ba7d771b6a38c4fa36af2491670a041da4d48","59ce4360722ed2deddfc9117d52d0d521e8b740c","b878f130665648e7d32c6974539135cbecd64833","4bcc4f55b43343a560ddab36c0aedc47782997de","3708be62d1c9a0410e142b3c66a1b06f0c665b66","2e5c2f7009bab10e47ddf4ca7b1101ab56d72960","8e169ec1645208f221cff06a99e389b88d282a1c","5ba4b1cfe4220eb1f4286b2c9c28f91fcdfc454a","ee5753988bd481476ca4d918e924bc82a97d5139","b5f628737eb5206070036a4e78ab2933f30d4380","dd8f5b286ff6bd7c96c6f6e0373abbf5484ac5e3"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Validation of several types of noxious stimuli for use in determining the minimum alveolar concentration for inhalation anesthetics in dogs and rabbits.","doi":"10.2460/ajvr.2003.64.957","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.2460/ajvr.2003.64.957","venue":"American journal of veterinary research"}
