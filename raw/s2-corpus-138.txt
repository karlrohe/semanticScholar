One of the key elements in correctly defining a concession scheme is to establish an adequate risk-sharing mechanism among the stakeholders that take part in the process. This paper describes and analyzes the effect of the new Spanish Concession Law on risk sharing, in particular, the effect of the so-called progress clause on the calculation of risk held by the concessionaire. This law was designed both to reinforce private financing of public facilities and to improve the legal framework by defining a new risk-sharing approach, particularly in relation to the risks involved in estimating traffic demand. The paper finishes with an analysis of a specific application of the traffic risk-sharing approach for highway concessions in Spain.","inCitations":["d940c106065065a9c0697a7d770d21288472211e","0513bc9cf399ad51cd2d0581ec014fd3b9784408","60fe99105a34444810d8dcc6332ec03f751c4efa","620da23b7a5a8be0b9a60ec6e7aa4c1c07444c76","d36d2034c4f98b4e4037b88d80bc7421698e3734","0e557f9f3d4245af7a0ee7a760239ddda40a51ab","5915d3dbdcd74fd3d92fca30857b5a07a500ff01","ea0aed3cf4f5ae5d771b5e47c1736021b4e591e5","734d0e10af6bad190f5c68e732be52dc729428ad","77cddc24915cf7a8e824cf34ee2651cffd53772d","60e615c96a1bd0f613922d213d3ee21811249e76","bf817bbe0b28fdae974753c6d8415b05c378851d","6720402a4a692eeaddcb2a6c5cf171f3b2bd8e93","c2ae00cc4db14906d01bf0ad9798be2493e71646","0c8efeb78b4be7d65c93ecea1c637af60dd1ce31","c32aed975f706cea07456f085dcd3508d9efe343","09a3c8872e35921227a37c042067eb94a8ae3619","a7ac04700feecc6790b10231fc8428969b8c4323","aa484ff7ec1ae1f80f1b327ac4c11ffd257d0122","e5e9620d0e5fb9784125997044a000ea0de5ba08","5badb8940bb331414fdf1f4b4525be9ca6ef0e78","bb29618e9319aa3d1257c10bfc580d6f45d0e3e6","d78db76118cfa35786658a3ba76134f214873ff0","a2d8d1ee07da6658ef956d1887a504c5ac600255","13043346c343ca9a325b99ba6752209d0a38442e","754d80b9d6672c3b526f98f6cd8446743d346b12","9e5fce9bd1d8c3193fa2186584fbc44593830233"],"pdfUrls":["http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTTRANSPORT/Resources/336291-1171658979314/3056-01_0459-Vassallo.pdf"],"title":"Risk Sharing in the New Public Works Concession Law in Spain","doi":"10.3141/1932-01","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.3141/1932-01","venue":""}

In 1999 the Philippines Department of Health, with assistance from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), implemented the Philippines Field Management Training Program (FMTP) to provide local health officials with the managerial skills needed to perform their new, more responsible jobs. This paper addresses whether the FMTP has provided participants with useful managerial skills needed for their more responsible positions.MethodsThe method involved reviewing program outcomes, including results of applied management improvement projects the participants completed to solve managerial problems.ResultsBetween 2000 and 2010, 294 participants completed the FMTP and many were later promoted to more responsible positions. The participants also completed 204 applied management improvement projects resulting in documented improvements in service delivery, information systems, logistics, health insurance, policy and laboratory outcomes. Examples of their successes are included in this paper.ConclusionsThe results provide compelling evidence that managers are using the skills learned to solve significant managerial problems.","inCitations":["bd41b3115f0e0457245edbbc5af7e52dcca49793","5ee54b704d40e74d3ae820d01b532f3339614dd1","c0c0921959acbd1e1b3535f1c54097ad519c8385","35937656dd60ed11cae7f3925e5b3570735ae07f","174cc8c4dd5710a1f11b5e45b6f5f3c35ac870de","de489adc1a4ae3344a052c40b1a8277a99e73861"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"The Philippines Field Management Training Program (FMTP): strengthening management capacity in a decentralized public health system","doi":"10.1007/s00038-014-0603-5","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00038-014-0603-5","venue":"International Journal of Public Health"}

The conventional method is limited because of its time consuming and large sample size (several mg of individual porphyrin) required. Therefore, it hampers the application of porphyrin carbon isotope composition into the chemistry and geoscience. The present paper describes a quantification method to prepare bis-(tert-butyldimethylsiloxy) silicon (IV) [(TBDMSO)2Si(IV)] porphyrin which is sufficiently volatile at 300 degrees C and can be used for GC-IRMS analysis. The analysis of carbon isotope composition of aetio I as the form of free base, nickel, demetalization derivative, silicon(IV) and (TBDMSO)2Si(IV) have shown that aetio I porphyrin has no obvious isotope fractionation in the whole synthesis procedure for (TBDMSO)2Si(IV) porphyrin. The carbon isotope study on the porphyrin mixtures of aetio I and OEP indicates that isotope exchange between porphyrins during the synthesis of (TBDMSO)2Si(IV) porphyrin is absent. The method can be applied to the determination of porphyrin carbon isotope compositions. The advantages of the method are time saving, less sample size and lower standard deviation.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"[The determination of porphyrin carbon isotope composition by gas chromatography-isotope ratio monitoring mass spectrometry technique].","doi":"","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"Se pu = Chinese journal of chromatography"}

Macroscopically, the rate of spreading can be quantified through macrodispersion coefficients, the determination of which has been the subject of stochastic theories. This work compares the results of a volume-averaging approach with those of the advection dominated large-time small-perturbation theory of Dagan [1982] and Gelhar and Axness [1983]. Consider transport of an ideal tracer in a porous medium with deterministic periodic velocity. Using the Taylor-Aris-Brenner method of moments, it has been previously demonstrated [Kitanidis, 1992] that when the plume spreads over an area much larger than the period, the volume-averaged concentration satisfies the advection-dispersion equation with constant coefficients that can be computed. Here, the volume-averaging analysis is extended to the case of stationary random velocities. Additionally, a perturbation method is applied to obtain explicit solutions for small-fluctuation cases, and the results are compared with those of the stochastic macrodispersion theory. It is shown that the method of moments, which uses spatial averaging, for sufficiently large volumes of averaging yields the same result as the stochastic theory, which is based on ensemble averaging. The result is of theoretical but also practical significance because the volume-averaging approach provides a potentially efficient way to compute macrodispersion coefficients. The method is applied to a simplified representation of the Borden aquifer.","inCitations":["4434da0334a17cbe1baf236cc151ee8a47a59112","ff569a2dd1ec97b5f659fcdfebe16d0699bfbdef","62d4f33790882972853632208fa7469083b5b8d1","11df6d4c506f6a4056796359fb75668ae7e7100c","c2fc2e3f4f8665302febe5e92994524a1c28a3a6","2bbf66b51149ab1f45d4498ff80fe5b88f5f5b0a","3987c0256f51fe0a21d6807b8a67247f4ebcc1f3","b5a35a11ade56b897ec0a0ed62ae9ae59a812ac9","b569a929780e827ae596647f1e8c38dc02d26788","532bedcb12faa91af80dbbcec835f735fe2c0375","042c33086dc27911a71d503cb16aa7253902f8af","96521a3576390a396375d86bf4e6210f4855f82b","9269f9c172a3fa6974e23ce2e9b72c4bc99dffeb","9af84f148ed4bde4f43026a34592d6aab65aaf3d","45499f7952de12a77bf56f6d5d5cf853e1347a15"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Analysis of macrodispersion through volume averaging: comparison with stochastic theory","doi":"10.1007/s004770050032","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s004770050032","venue":""}

Reproductive and sexual health issues are becoming a hot topic among teenagers. Evaluation of the program was conducted to assess the extent of evaluation of adolescent reproductive health promotion program at Radio Fourteen FM. Method: Data collection through indepth interviews and FGDs on key informants (Fourteen FM trainers and Pilar volunteers) and supporting informants (students of SMAN 14 Semarang were 31 students, principals, and two broadcasters). Validity and reliability of data use source triangulation and techniques as well as reference materials. Result: At Input, Man is good enough but needs improvement such as training and capacity building continuously to help use question and answer method. In process, broadcasting is in conformity with IEC guidance but monitoring aspect is rarely done and there is no joint evaluation between Fourteen FM and Pilar. At output, the target achievement is still low from the expected target. The allocation of broadcast time is still less than optimal because it coincides with KBM and becomes a priority thing to be improved by changing the time of the broadcast. Conclusion: The Input is good, strengthening the quality of monitoring and program evaluation still needs to be intensified. Capacity building for volunteers and broadcasters needs to be done continuously. \nKeywords: Evaluation, Radio, Adolescent Reproductive Health","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"EVALUASI PROGRAM PROMOSI KESEHATAN REPRODUKSI REMAJA MELALUI RADIO(Studi Pada Fourteen FM di SMAN 14 Semarang)","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

In the setting of obscure gastrointestinal bleeding (OGIB) its diagnostic yield exceeds 50%. The location of CE in the diagnostic algorithm for investigation of OGIB is still debated. Objective: To evaluate if clinical practice has changed with more rapid referral for CE and whether this change decreases endoscopic exams without affecting clinical outcomes. Methods: All CE for OGIB from a single academic centre were reviewed. 310 CE were completed from 12/01-11/04 (267 for OGIB). We collected data on investigations, transfusions and management prior to the first CE. CEs from 2001-2002 (Group 1) were compared to those from 2003-2004 (Group 2). The information was available prospectively from a CE database. Statistical analysis was carried out using Chi-Square, Fisher’s Exact or Wilcoxon Rank Sum Tests. Results: Complete data was available on 221 of 267 CEs completed for OGIB. The time to referral for CE was O24 weeks of disease in both groups (83 vs 74%) however there was a trend to earlier referral in group 2 (!12 wks 8 vs 15%). The number of patients undergoing i Y3 upper endoscopies before CE was greater in Group 1 (upper: 52 vs 30%, p ! .001). Nuclear scans and angiograms were fewer for Group 2 (40 vs 19%, p ! .001). The mean number of colonoscopies, small bowel barium studies or transfusions was not different between the two groups. Enteroscopies were performed more frequently in Group 1 pre-CE (mean: 0.7 vs 0.3, p ! .001) but a trend suggested more enteroscopies after CE in Group 2 (21% vs 13%. There was no difference in the number of lesions found on CE that were accessible by standard endoscopic techniques (24 vs 17%) or the number of definitively positive findings (57 vs 55%) between the two groups. Conclusion: The number of investigations performed prior to CE referral has significantly decreased at this centre and the detection rate of abnormalities remains unchanged. This suggests that earlier implementation of CE in the diagnostic algorithm for OGIB has the potential for more targeted post-CE therapies as well as significant cost savings.

The core layer is the ITU-T G. 729 at 8 kbit/s. A first enhancement layer is a bandwidth extension algorithm requiring 2 kbit/s to widen the G. 729 narrow band output speech. The difference between the wideband original and reconstructed signal is transformed in the time-frequency domain by a full wavelet decomposition. The resulting coefficients are quantized by an embedded quantizer at 22 kbit/s. Listening tests show the relevance of such a scheme when compared to a pure wavelet packet decomposition. In addition, listening tests suggest that the proposed codec is equivalent to the ITU-T G. 722 at 48 kbit/s for speech signals.","inCitations":["4adb932272e40ecdb84a23e897d60408da09e259","c9e8156ff49682cc68ba03f0a5223cb9fe4eca06","5394c78de1393d275350ca01c19ab523b683efee","768c18b79fb071d02e473719018911597ed1f104","e8085694757aba98250f83affb282be40ceb0dc0"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.ind.rwth-aachen.de/fileadmin/publications/demeuleneire06.pdf","http://www.researchgate.net/profile/Dominique_Pastor/publication/224641010_A_Celp-Wavelet_Scalable_Wideband_Speech_Coder/links/00463538c7000eba28000000.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2006.1660116"],"title":"A Celp-Wavelet Scalable Wideband Speech Coder","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2006.1660116","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2006.1660116","venue":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics Speech and Signal Processing Proceedings"}

We described the prevalence of any symptoms and moderate/severe symptoms approximately four to six months after diagnosis. We used logistic regression to identify patient and clinical characteristics associated with symptoms, and calculated adjusted proportions of patients with symptoms.\n\n\nRESULTS\nIn total, 5067 (93.5%) patients reported at least one symptom in the four weeks before their survey, with 51% reporting at least one moderate/severe symptom. Lung cancer patients reported more symptoms than colorectal cancer patients. Patients who received treatment or had more comorbidities were more likely to report symptoms. For example, after adjustment, patients who received chemotherapy during the six weeks before the survey were more likely than others to report at least one symptom (97.3% vs. 90.8%, P<0.001), and at least one moderate/severe symptom (56.8% vs. 46.2%, P<0.001). After adjustment, early- vs. late-stage patients did not differ in reports of at least one symptom (93.6% vs. 93.4%, P=0.853) and differed only slightly in reports of at least one moderate/severe symptom (53.3% vs. 49.6%, P=0.009).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nMost recently diagnosed lung and colorectal cancer patients have cancer-related symptoms regardless of stage, and more than half have at least one moderate/severe symptom.","inCitations":["ad48d3f5fd10ec139511b573e56f144977e3eb7a","65fb43d4d14f4c725dcfc85e2d03fff281c183c9","b49ed7d4a4aecb4e72a5e3c542342e7e56d471dc","73e63c8d2d3fbfeee77603ff976ec6a88c8d3c18","a5b13745138aabaeed15d460869f66f8c41f3308","fba3e8103b54e054575bce5db291f2b948fcddb8","446d683bbac99b7bbb5d84274e72fb23551f6508","92caddcfbcd898d58eff3443bfa36fabca8c100d","f4000d00e18479cc5978e2d44999a44f4129807c","dc525932a322f040cc1b45b9f17dc9bf0740efa9","204d7b5f9dec06f5e30a590ba841b8c11ef8c9dd","1c7cd8d9fd7051038ab41cd0ab877c2fc0a1045b","e0c5b89acee69429dc2ee30ec352a8d4c29f9205","dc31aacc1a6dca3f5d1ce522cddc49432101ede0","66ac66a395e33f61fbe07de0f58dfc7d55717d69","ecd9662dc79eacfe545aaf9bc74ca1c2e788c43e","2cd7dc2ebceebd6a686f434c8b2002a09230b56a","56958318955e241aed4fa0f49ccbdcabb38db934","d2d523669ea896cf4cb6afedcdc3197673bec782","4999c8b8f6e151b0dbd60fc28eb3057bf185c316","cd42f2dd540d0ee845a97d08a132916a21a33301","97cea2968fa6fcd4df5381fb67448db5e967b0dd","b11fc308ec01cfb343722da26e354d9a57a64f73","2f303ad376b5f907091a10921d5cc80f57c91aa5","da2866625220e7e0ee2d8756809755bf74cec345","edd882413c5201c57eaea71a3b7d7d0978a7277a","acb7927b1775ff12168d4ab38e522b2c2e25bdca","55193f02753d06b403117367fb00b86a135dbe0c","a5ec1208751926b1e5ab102002ccd7f34f797ae1","98e60f121c49e604a32565901bf8f2a5c152ac9c","931917f7f0fc286dc439b4166921d9f0c9158801"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Symptom prevalence in lung and colorectal cancer patients.","doi":"10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2014.06.003","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2014.06.003","venue":"Journal of pain and symptom management"}

In this chapter, the authors investigate the rejection rate of the SIS procedure on a multiple logistic regression models with categorical covariates. Using tools from algebra, they show that in general SIS can have a very high rejection rate even though we apply Linear Integer Programming (IP) to compute the support of the marginal distribution for each variable. More specifically, the semigroup generated by the columns of the design matrix for a multiple logistic regression has infinitely many “holes.” They end with application of a hybrid scheme of MCMC and SIS to NUN study data on Alzheimer disease study.

PA44 has been successfully cloned, sequenced and expressed in Escherichia coli. The gene is 1593 basepairs and encodes a precursor protein of 530 amino acid residues with a calculated molecular mass of 55.7 kDa. The enzyme is isolated, however, as an active 40.6-kDa proteinase, without a 139 amino acid residue N-terminal prosequence. Under mild conditions the enzyme undergoes a further autocatalytic cleavage to give a 29.7-kDa proteinase that retains full enzymatic activity. The deduced amino acid sequence of the enzyme has high homology to proteinases of the proteinase K family of subtilisin-like proteinases. With respect to the enzyme characteristics compared in this study the properties of the wild-type and recombinant proteinases are the same. Sequence analysis revealed that especially with respect to the thermophilic homologues, aqualysin I from Thermus aquaticus and a proteinase from Thermus strain Rt41A, the cold-adapted Vibrio-proteinase has a higher content of polar/uncharged amino acids, as well as aspartate residues. The thermophilic enzymes had a higher content of arginines, and relatively higher number of hydrophobic amino acids and a higher aliphatic index. These factors may contribute to the adaptation of these proteinases to different temperature conditions.","inCitations":["b268f9c8fbbcd02066273c293b1095c3befd501a","9e8cb8cf59043a2572baccdc4f4d564e19ee9ba3","ac6eef5b12d16f6fefb7bd357feadf16622e5a66","3a6567351dd0c9bfa5f914afbf5bc017c72e6bf9","e35a9939a29867023e9e3af2d55a4a7fe111e1f4","ec631ce56d01c178962d93a6a88e8d5fa3efd95f","2185ce43bd41c9e7b602406ee4e086d86ff0fe54","e4e59b6e2a2d668c48bbd5e41f22a0ed5c9364d8","61b008bccbb7ac4ba65795895d7f7f2878830e5e","5b6d14dd8327251d224bc7723dbb0a33347a548e","c4722239214b99df3361088b4393adaf8e00ca8f","3b15697c7712e71f62bbd32d4295cfbb30303f78","65ca6b9f478fe7665f8e33eff41a1db96b2906a3","99635f8f94f595e9c81340ce6559e1a7b03ef2c1","9ddaa3c0dec0a370cd1ad6c6fed223288b34d2df","754815ed5208d2a8e6f15f98fb384c3e5646b0c9","c56e711e8b0f7e16ca87a45d2f8cc336011f4a79","2e470efe0db76c673bc2f8d61c2d95f3f91a6b29","b9e78cf06de75eaca74dca98020044a58cbc8b44","04030ce6d6dd9e1037ba951213d230fca0169dfd","99be7d473def6245d3ad8561d6c65a5db576ad00","c303e535c9c434c74f578b4309b5f841706092a6","768b9e1ad3fce59e1f71ba511502d698161a886b","5fff68752235a24f678c06029621bffb148b4579","e5939136d4ee511f9fb445b1a1eb2a540e8d175b"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Characterization of a cloned subtilisin-like serine proteinase from a psychrotrophic Vibrio species.","doi":"10.1046/j.1432-1033.2002.03259.x","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1432-1033.2002.03259.x","venue":"European journal of biochemistry"}

Many highway agencies, where equipment for evaluation is not available and maintenance funds are limited, may not be able to carry out a detailed structural evaluation on individual pavement sections. An attempt has been made in this paper to develop a simple and cost effective model for structural evaluation of existing pavements. The important features of the model are (1) it can be executed with minimal amount of data, (2) the model is simple and does not require use of any costly equipment, and (3) the output of the model can be directly used for prioritization of maintenance needs at the network level. Two such models have been developed. The models are statistical and are derived from the long term pavement performance (LTPP) database developed by the U.S. Department of Transportation. The models have been validated and their predictions for remaining structural life (RSL) have been compared with the RSL obtained using the fatigue and rutting distress models of the Asphalt Institute. The results indicate that the proposed models are capable of predicting the RSL of existing pavements with reasonable accuracy and consistency, given that their primary use is in evaluating pavement structural conditions at the network level and for the purpose of prioritizing pavement sections for maintenance purposes.","inCitations":["b41d29b3d4a018b89d130ede2b57e517203a5a31","2ad69ab828855c901c23346fda13e9f997d64f13","c37e6e0558ca5e03ac30240211112d0147df3a12","4535f853806a8a592b580b78394f71ad544f2a4b"],"pdfUrls":["http://home.iitk.ac.in/~partha/asceIS2006"],"title":"Simple Model for Structural Evaluation of Asphalt Concrete Pavements at the Network Level","doi":"10.1061/(ASCE)1076-0342(2006)12:1(41)","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1061/%28ASCE%291076-0342%282006%2912%3A1%2841%29","venue":""}

A randomized, double-blind, cross-over, placebo-controlled clinical trial with two parallel groups was carried out in 12 healthy individuals, six with a family history of diabetes and six without such family history. The volunteers were randomly assigned to administration of a nicotine or placebo patch and were crossed-over with a difference of at least 3 days between each patch. The insulin sensitivity was estimated by means of the total glucose metabolism, which was obtained with the euglycemic- hyperinsulinemic clamp technique before the randomized assignment and on the following day for the corresponding patch. At the beginning of each clamp technique procedure, the metabolic and hepatic profiles were measured. We found that the total glucose metabolism value was not modified with the administration of nicotine, either in the group with a family history of DM2 (3.9 +/- 1.0 vs. 3.5 +/- 0.7 mg/kg/min; p = 0.60) or in the group without such a family history (5.4 +/- 2.0 vs. 5.1 +/- 1.6 mg/kg/min; p = 0.34). The administration of placebo did not modify the insulin sensitivity in either group.

This sorbent, a mixture of mainly Fe(III) and Ni(II) (hydr)oxides, has been used both in its native form and entrapped in calcium alginate. The effect of sorbent concentration in the gel bead, solution pH, contact time and As(III) and As(V) concentration on sorption has been studied. Furthermore the effect of the gel matrix has been investigated. A 10% (w/v) of (hydr)oxide in the gel beads was found to provide both spherical beads shape and good sorption performance. Solution pH was found to exert a stronger influence in As(V) than in As(III) sorption. The optimum pH range resulted to be within 5-10 for As(III) and within 6-9 for As(V). Taking into account these results, pH 8 was chosen for further sorption experiments. Equilibrium was reached after 48 h contact time for the studied systems. Kinetics data of both As(III) and As(V) onto native (hydr)oxide (O) and entrapped in calcium alginate beads (10% O-CA) were successfully modelled according to pseudo-first and pseudo-second order equations. Sorption equilibrium data were evaluated by the Langmuir isotherm model and the maximum capacity q(max) were 77.4 and 126.5 mg g(-1) for As(III) on O and 10% O-CA, and 26.8 and 41.6 mg g(-1) for As(V) on O and 10% O-CA, respectively. The entrapment of the (hydr)oxide in a calcium alginate gel matrix improved the As(III) and As(V) sorption by 60%.","inCitations":["683b0753b8cf1f6a1191595678ab2728eb1b7da2","7b57ab00c1098803be1d759c4927e8884260848f","1f008eb8d9400d3e52c29087da45778ec2424fc2","01379ca2e8e6fc30df66be7c5e438025d9c676de","a9a7ef49ec2c674e04d57a132ed6c2f04289af34","0f7af206b4b44b082eb8c1a8dc4ec10345a6ae51","f9f51e005a71c5e2e5a473a2c6c82d0d242a1704","d4338e4a6bf77ed80828e8b5544292a716ade9b2","8f83911f521009f8ed6ba8463522d7ed6672455f","fec03f7725b048857f6812099af3036a1685abfc","56e486052b961b2eaa00b855faf25e9e3ad31837","0fbb6601e8f1f83764f68a03da03a20ae9d5bb48","12911cbe79bd39f6282c19c71df8b7a51c9e5b53","36d80f1487d8fdd9ae32af13839225db6a38982b","adaf914589129ec50affbf5d293df5be7b966876","62e6a2e908a3a8e496ea35435b88cac6895bf23f","1500b08e3e200b054143fdb84c6e379b579c6afc","f307f0fb80f1ba9b4b204c8ed7805341d8f13592","50637e6fed8fa99b1093f112476fe01492fbab23","bbabb261656f519120de7d94bbbe45dfe972d46c","db01fd8ab29ddc38e7bc85d459309f2a17710ebd","ad453d6509025285c567a13a38adab0f8ff9684d","4116c96c4958087d73abfda07154142d7ccc6710","879280ae63df6156bcab26df5340c4c81d03cfa8","024d85ce02a814cc1457b47eb088cea51b886887","21eaa9f32f450198e94850fa84fce079197f6709","b8f6617aab3b48428764567be801e100f4b09a22","a006401c7907930d51836d3fdd82514842d5f244","096afa8da57a2d5ccd27578a303fb8242e724150","1c7b5cfe189c563d90e17a7d632c5c319536cde1","6170dced2c8603dd6f6cc24cd916bc119b77ccd0","0b730beeaea8e46bca6a7e79967198bb037fdf9b","e200f6b364afa4fa081f6355ad9928e64490874d","3d8a7de9cd61ff298c4fcc45302f02d4b609a775","9050b4da410ee414b2838ddd403215224d30e2ff","7cf89168bb5886132f67aa6aba0c01fa4f57351d","e3ebbfd65e826c90dda9d9e87b4abaafa3b06e56","e3d54dff7b6431f6893461331511dc6de667dcee","4857a17159b9ac4ef0509975f70ffa37a5a19ecc","a3f50943a8794b70c396f884768b3bbcdfff2df8"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Arsenic removal by a waste metal (hydr)oxide entrapped into calcium alginate beads.","doi":"10.1016/j.jhazmat.2008.08.042","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2008.08.042","venue":"Journal of hazardous materials"}

MOEA/D has high search ability as well as high computational efficiency. Whereas other EMO algorithms usually do not work well on many-objective problems with four or more objectives, MOEA/D can properly handle them. This is because its scalarizing function-based fitness evaluation scheme can generate an appropriate selection pressure toward the Pareto front without severely increasing the computation load. MOEA/D can also search for well-distributed solutions along the Pareto front using a number of weight vectors with different directions in scalarizing functions. Currently MOEA/D seems to be one of the best choices for multi-objective optimization in various application fields. In this paper, we examine its performance on multi-objective problems with highly correlated objectives. Similar objectives to existing ones are added to two-objective test problems in computational experiments. Experimental results on multi-objective knapsack problems show that the inclusion of similar objectives severely degrades the performance of MOEA/D while it has almost no negative effects on NSGA-II and SPEA2. We also visually examine such an undesirable behavior of MOEA/D using manyobjective test problems with two decision variables.","inCitations":["d9f13d51f01b2a80b33836febc7b9994b4de923a","3bbfc240888f02e789841553126fca3758b3b0ef","df86dc8267cef09d587022faa52ca1eaffcb11e3","38b7dd6789d053bb9e24a3c53266ad3d2812ece3","3ed79f273ccc1f8622299cdbfd7f2b0f922ff2a7","0ad9e28f96ad85f51424d1832a509b277eaddf9b","6835e7c8b5006fbc94fd52df8fca5b87ab4a29e8","83578a9227fdc789d61a57b83e2fbe41ca182bf6","8a24c59daa3461a351ee73fa0be0ebd9435f73a1","6d4e1d62e57bbb6e1f6c6df5ddbf59a1c0d07f0f","67f9a3be09e5f5450685c60dfa9f9a6d09b6c7e8","f5790af039eea536a940f2fe14ce58d2e8ebdb3f","d05b957a1dc4525b1831358ac2ef4e2d6bb7f7e8","41c6bf581877c809ae5bbe170d5f84c266990e86","dc5e8ab3c9313ae096f707930b0cc710a040368a","7184c3e2bd4fd314d8650b5dd0fef8a09d361f1f","dc78fb2bfa8d67c4b2a1fab8ffe28f257c482689","38cd6fcae05be7c6b7aae8cf0ef7853400a136c8"],"pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-19893-9_12","http://www.ie.osakafu-u.ac.jp/~hisaoi/ci_lab_e/research/pdf_file/multiobjective/EMO_2011_MOEA_D_Camera-Ready.pdf"],"title":"Effects of the Existence of Highly Correlated Objectives on the Behavior of MOEA/D","doi":"10.1007/978-3-642-19893-9_12","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-19893-9_12","venue":"EMO"}

Several important traditional perspectives on human nature include the theory of acquired habits from the Confucianists and Mohists, the theory of the original goodness from Mencius, the theory of evil human nature from Xunzi and the Legalists, and the simple and true theory of Taoism. These schools of philosophy addressed human nature in relation to the elements of traditional values in Chinese culture, the view of feelings and emotions in learning, the functions of the teacher, and the roles of the government. In addition to analyzing human nature, the implications of these traditional values on current educational practice in Taiwan are presented. Amidst these complicated and sometimes contradictory traditions, the changeable human nature is affirmed, the autonomy of teachers and learners is recognized, and deliberation on the learning process is recommended.

A physical activity programme, including an education programme, was developed for older adults with ID using behaviour change techniques. The programme aimed at improving or maintaining adequate levels of physical activity (primary outcome measure) and motor fitness, cardio respiratory fitness, morphologic and metabolic fitness, activities of daily living, cognitive functioning and depressive symptoms (secondary outcome measures).\n\n\nMETHOD\nThe programme's efficacy was evaluated in a cluster-randomised clinical trial among people aged 43 years and over with mild-moderate levels of ID. Five day-activity centres were randomised to the participation group. In these centres, 81 older adults participated in groups of 8 to 10 in the programme, three times a week during 8 months. The programme was executed by physical activity instructors and staff of day-activity centres. Five other day-activity centres were randomised to the control group; 70 older adults in these centres received care as usual. The generalised linear model with mixed effects was used to test the programme's effectiveness.\n\n\nRESULTS\nSignificant effects were found on physical activity, muscle strength, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, serum cholesterol level and cognitive functioning, in favour of the programme's participants. No significant improvements were found on balance, serum glucose, weight, waist circumference, walking speed, mobility, depression or instrumental activities of daily living.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe physical activity and fitness programme has established small but significant effects in this sample, but generalising the findings to other settings is difficult due to significant participant dropout. Implementation of evidence-based physical activity programmes among older adults with ID is recommended. Further research is needed to investigate the effectiveness of physical activity on daily life functioning and the development on chronic diseases in the long run.","inCitations":["7c49cccff1efdbd3bccb0e219a3cf1ff013d289c","a2d1fc72815e6c08c8a35164689e06bea0564c1c","88ce83a20800c821f5bedf963de5c2d38e062457","7e0b1fecfb48b078984a4c0602cf146e3bb1eed6","a59a8a7776d16c89b0018e11861e3e2ed22b630f","13dd2fdd935a0b5f147ea1b0a33b9319fee0ff66","e83732fa52b024dfc95951236e1b817805623388","e1d0c90c65f36511139bee7fd086e279368702d6","ff04301f0a388805d18b5afe43afeeed41129c92","e0282194717e4a25118c4776430aee93e5625069","54bfcc2412b08da6b2778d7b164d247568acc8c9"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"A structured physical activity and fitness programme for older adults with intellectual disabilities: results of a cluster‐randomised clinical trial","doi":"10.1111/jir.12267","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1111/jir.12267","venue":"Journal of intellectual disability research : JIDR"}

Este campo de investigacion se conoce como Music Information Retrieval (MIR) y ha ganado mucho interes en los ultimos anos. En este sentido, el entender cuales son las propiedades que caracterizan a este tipo de senales es de gran importancia. En particular, la senal musical esta altamente estructurada atendiendo a la secuencia temporal de los eventos musicales que la componen y el analisis de esta estructura es fundamental para el desarrollo de metodos especificos de procesado de senal musical. El objetivo de esta tesis es proponer metodos para el analisis de la estructura temporal de senales musicales reales. Asi, exploraremos tecnicas para la deteccion automatica de onsets, aquellos que definen el instante de inicio de las notas musicales, y beat tracking, que es equivalente al acto humano de seguir con el pie el ritmo de la musica. En primer lugar, centraremos nuestro analisis en el problema de la deteccion de onsets e introduciremos el concepto de decodificacion ritmica. En lugar de detectar los onsets individualmente tal y como se ha venido haciendo hasta ahora, se propone un modelo estadistico para decodificar la secuencia de onsets que mejor definen la naturaleza ritmica de la senal musical analizada. El modelo propuesto define un metodo generico que puede ser utilizado combinando con cualquier extractor del acento de la senal musical y estimador de ritmo. Despues de esto, extendemos nuestro modelo estadistico a un problema de seguimiento de beat. El objetivo es demostrar que la informacion que observamos en los instantes de tiempo donde no existe un beat puede ser tambien aprovechada para estimar el beat. Ademas, introducimos una nueva medida de evaluacion, la information gain, que mide la ganancia de informacion proporcionada por un beat tracker cuando se compara con una estima completamente aleatoria. Por ultimo, estudiaremos la forma de medir automaticamente la precision de las estimaciones de beat proporcionadas por nuestro algoritmo de beat tracking, a la cual denominamos reliability. La combinacion de algoritmos de procesado de senal es un aspecto muy importante para el futuro en Music Information Retrieval y estas medidas de precision son, por tanto, de gran interes ya que permiten evaluar el valor de la aportacion proporcionada por cada algoritmo automaticamente.","inCitations":["541c16f19ecc1e90d6af64ef88ad7ba658e9a37a","40bf96fca7a6eb3eced283f9a3fb2105465702d7"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Signal processing methods for analyzing the temporal structure of music exploiting rhytmic knowledge","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

In this work, the method is used in the study of environmental concern. The new instrument usefully chart also ways in which less evident forms of engagements may be recognized. The study uses data from the 2000 World Values Survey and International Social Survey Programme. First, Mokken Scale Analysis is applied to build a cumulative scale of mobilization for the defense of the environment. Second, Guttman errors are analyzed to identify specific patterns of activism. The analysis of the indexes enable the isolation of an often elusive phenomenon not shown by other techniques: the presence of individuals with a pronounced degree of activism but who do not share the attitudes of the majority of environmentalists. These particular patterns might constitute specific ways to relate to the environment. Guttman errors analysis can be fruitfully applied in measurement of attitudes or behavior. In particular, it can shed light on the presence of individual that sociological research should consider, study and label separately.","inCitations":["c08d085e1e3ec5bd3da82e36e71c3db7c05b292a"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"A new way of looking at old things.

While some of the goals can be attained by the States on their own, others can only be attained with the cooperation or active support of other similar entities beyond their borders. All decisions in form of actions or reactions, dealing with such matters requiring cooperation or active support of others across the borders of a given State for their attainment, fall within the ambient of foreign policy. Thus foreign policy is authoritative actions taken by governments or those governments are committed to take in order to either maintain the desirable aspects of the international environment or to amend its undesirable aspects. Also, Hoisti in Obi defines foreign policy as the action of a state towards the external environment and the conditions usually domestic under which these actions are formulated [1]. This invariably means that foreign policy is the category of actions a government takes to deals with defence, security, international political relations and international economic relations. As a necessarily calculated and goal-oriented activity, foreign policy is purposive. This purpose is altering or creating a condition outside the sovereign boundaries to gain national advantage, usually defined in terms of national interest. National image both at home and abroad is an ethical issue. It may appear intangible but the benefits and advantages flowing from a good image are inestimably unquantifiable. The perception of a country by members of the international community, how a country pursues its relations with others and particularly, the behaviour of its citizens at home and abroad can affect a country’s image thus, image making it an essential feature of a nation’s foreign policy.","inCitations":["ea147b837b87b105e814e1551155fe84e41f816d","182d3dc1f4e552e8feec4350f14a544bb7ec3db3","9af4aa5b1b9c17eb9ee7d829f967c92a8985c9e9"],"pdfUrls":["https://www.hilarispublisher.com/open-access/nigerian-foreign-policy-and-global-image-a-critical-assessment-of-goodluck-jonathans-administration-2165-7912-1000279.pdf"],"title":"Nigerian Foreign Policy and Global Image: A Critical Assessment of Goodluck Jonathan’s Administration","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Argentine history represents a progression, via bloody dictatorship, from peripheral colony, to successful immigrant nation with a constitutional government, an important role in the economy of the world and an optimistic future. Its initial promise was followed by a steady decline after the Depression, marked by a transition from populism to authoritarianism, the empty exhuberance of the Peronist era, a cycle of military intervention and repression, the occasional release of pent-up nationalism and the state-sanctioned terror of the Junta period, culminating in the frustration of the Falklands defeat and new attempts at democracy - all formidable problems for the historian and social scientist to explore and explain. Rock argues that Argentina's decline during recent decades - and the instability linked to this decline - stems from the collapse of long-established links with Western Europe and the country's failure to establish substitutes. He shows how the early colonial period works as a crucially formative influence on the country's later development, and he brings together a wide variety of issues which have previously been treated separately and disconnectedly. Professor Rock has also written \"Politics in Argentina 1980-1930: The Rise and Fall of Radicalism\". His work on Argentina has won him the Herbert Bolton Prize for Latin American History.","inCitations":["e7c485a876b856cb85ca5b9c58d8ab92d4f1bbd5","0e0786740c9097ee734c65f35022af8da28be5db","92df2394978895df7295572a89ffd3f91cfe027d","5b90a256d2a4f468c2b912ceb61f6a0862c0ae10","956b0a11fa6744e481127b2566acb0001eebb342"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Argentina, 1516-1987 : from Spanish colonization to the Falklands War and Alfonsín","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

As the rainfall observation using satellite is becoming plausible, it is necessary to know how to capture the bias between the remotely sensed data and the true one. In this paper a method to capture the bias based on the second order statistics of rainfall field data is introduced and the application study based on several multi-dimensional precipitation models are tried. The results showed that all three models gave similar dimensionless root-mean-square(RMS) errors and that about 60 visits (about one month) are necessary to achieve about 10% RMS deviation in a special situaltion of continous raining. In reality the raining time during observation is less than 10 % (8% for the GATE), thus much longer observation time is necessary (more than one year).","inCitations":["722106f86e02a7fde3aa9d0e3e86317023c6037f"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Multi-dimensional precipitation models and their application to the ground-truth problem","doi":"10.1007/BF02830126","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/BF02830126","venue":""}

Arbetet handlar alltsa framst om det skydd mot renommesnyltning som naringsidkare kan parakna sig i olika marknadsforingssituationer. De materiella reglerna i MFL bestar av en generalklausul (4 §) och en regelkatalog (5-13 a §§). Renommesnyltning har inte fatt nagon sarskild regel i regelkatalogen, med undantag for fall av renommesnyltning i samband med jamforande reklam (8 a § 7 punkten). Renommesnyltning som sjalvstandig grund har istallet utvecklats genom praxis med utgangspunkt fran generalklausulen i 4 §. Renommesnyltning i marknadsrattslig mening kan utifran Marknadsdomstolens (MD:s) praxis definieras med fyra kriterier: Det skall vara fraga om en naringsidkare som i sin marknadsforing obehorigen anknyter till en annan naringsidkares verksamhet, produkter, kannetecken eller liknande. Det som utnyttjas skall vara val kant pa marknaden sa att det forknippas med den andre naringsidkaren. Det otillborliga bestar i att den snyltande till sin ekonomiska fordel utnyttjar det varde som ligger i en positiv forestallning hos konsumenten, vilken skapats genom insatser av den andre naringsidkaren. Ett sadant utnyttjande ar typiskt sett ocksa agnat att i en eller annan form skada den utsatte naringsidkaren och att forsamra konsumenternas marknadsoverblick. Genom den praxis som utvecklats under de senaste aren har MD lamnat den restriktivitet som praglade den tidiga rattsutvecklingen. MD har genom sin praxis utvecklat kriterier for vad som utgor renommesnyltning och darigenom avgransat och preciserat begreppet. Det kavarstar dock en hel del svarigheter. Renommesnyltningsskyddet har inte fatt nagon enhetlig reglering fran lagstiftarens sida, vilket bl.a. paverkar mojligheten till skadestand. Det ar dessutom svart att fa ersattning for den reella skadan i det fall dar skadestand kan yrkas. Vidare ar det praktiken svart att fa till stand interimistiska forbud med renommesnyltning som grund. De kriterier MD stallt upp synes i sig medge ett relativt omfattande skydd. Praxis har dock framst handlat om till synes uppenbara fall av snyltning. Granserna for ett andamalsmassigt skydd maste rimligen sattas genom mer svarbedomda fall. Det ar darfor svart att med utgangspunkt fran foreliggande praxis mer precist avgransa vad som kan utgora renommesnyltning. Ett annat satt se pa saken ar att det utifran foreliggande praxis om renommesnyltning endast foreligger ett relativt oansenligt skydd for gott anseende.

Efter att ha last den utmarkta kursen experimentell immaterialratt for professor Marianne Levin vid Juridiska institutionen i Stockholm var det klart att det skulle bli ett arbete inom immaterialratt/marknadsratt pa nagot satt. Da Juridiska fakulteten i Lund saknade handledare pa omradet vande jag ater till Stockholm och Juridiska institutionen vid Stockholms universitet. Det ar i detta sammanhang pa sin plats att rikta ett sarskilt tack till professor Marianne Levin, som narmast spontant erbjod sig att stalla upp som min handledare: Stort tack for det, Marianne!

Although many Jewish jokes use scripts that are congruent with anti· Semitic stereotypes, the tone of the jokes teils us that the tellers are neither hostile to their own people nor inclined to support the parallel stereotypes. Jewish jokes play with hostility and stereotypes; they do not endorse them. The thesis that Jewish humor has a distinctly self-mocking and selfderogatory character is one that has been frequently stated (for example Freud 1960: 111-112; Grotjahn 1970; Mikes 1980: 49) and yet also denounced äs a myth (Ben-Amos 1973). If all that is meant is that Jews teil and invent large numbers of jokes about members of their own Community that impute negative qualities to them, then the thesis is true but not very important. The stronger version of the thesis, that those Jews who invent, teil, and enjoy such jokes are masochistically attacking their own group and by extension themselves (see Greenburg 1972: 145-147; Grotjahn 1970), would be important were it not false. The purpose of this paper is to explore the territory between these two versions, first in relation to minority groups in general taking the Jews äs one example, and then in the special case of the Jews seen in the light of their distinctive culture and history. The self-mocking and allegedly self-derogatory jokes for which the Jews are famous are in some respects at least very similar to the jokes of other ethnic minorities; that is, Jewish humor is a special case of a more general phenomenon, namely the asymmetry (see Middleton and Moland Humor 4-2 (1991), 189-209. 0933-1719/91/0004-0189 $2.00 © Walter de Gruyter","inCitations":["bd9246b4d3b703850f8e15c7919f92d3f2b81b54","7816ebaef5e3121289aa21cf135d82212a3c7834","273c52d755ec85ca82cd531fcb824a7a5be83542","f3112d461d0983fe0975c37d7a17ae0e235a0160","dd7ca002c23799fade6358ff565d88cd442d4bbf","067fa98cbba39a149862cb2f4cbb08e9ecc657ec","a9859c375d2ffe097ee668e7239e3968907a1494","58327e52cb03d510ffb7feb708b28156a577ad49","5323669e9acb4826c178a6f92cdfea9c89aef889","9eed239963a9ec8790ae580cd412eddf7bf53f25","879d1c01c19ce5424879a7a18c232258593d003f","c9133a30c655c4f13fc2a8413e9fd8ece657a057"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Exploring the thesis of the self-deprecating Jewish sense of humor","doi":"10.1515/humr.1991.4.2.189","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1515/humr.1991.4.2.189","venue":""}

They have been fully established. Routine measurement procedures using manufacturers' reagent kits must be calibrated with the CRM and are standardized to maintain the commutability of measured values. In TC and HDL-C measurements, the commutability of measured values from reagent kits has been maintained by calibration with the CRM. However, it is likely that different values will be obtained due to the reactivity with abnormal specimens based on measurement principles and performance of the reagent kits. This different reactivity is a typical phenomenon in abnormal specimens on conducting lipid measurements. This phenomenon cannot be avoided using the CRM. On selection of the reagent kit, it is necessary to perform evaluation studies using abnormal specimens based on the comparison method. Direct methods standardized for LDL-C measurement are selected based on evaluation studies. In TG measurements for international standardization, it is necessary to change the procedure to measure the total glycerides instead of the elimination of free glycerol by the JSCC method. This is done to avoid the influence of LPL activity on heparin treatment for cardiovascular disease patients.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"[From the Point of View of the Production of Reference Material].","doi":"","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"Rinsho byori.

Only few studies have investigated the use of AMs among newly diagnosed patients with SLE. Objectives To analyze prescription patterns of AMs in newly diagnosed SLE patients in Denmark for the years 2000 -2011. Methods Using The Danish Prescription Register (DNPR) we conducted a nationwide Danish cohort study including all patients with a first time diagnosis of SLE (The Danish National Registry of Patients (NPR)). We used Kaplan-Meier estimates to compute the cumulative probability of starting AM treatment within a year and Cox regression analysis to compare time to treatment between patient groups. Results AMs were prescribed to 37.7% of the newly diagnosed SLE patients within the first year of follow-up. Approximately 20% did not receive any treatment. Women were more likely than men to start AM (adjusted HR of 1.26 (95% CI 1.06-1.50)). Patients diagnosed with SLE between in 2005-2011 were more likely to start treatment than patients diagnosed in 2000-2004 (HR of 1.33 (95% CI 1.17-1.51)). Patients with renal disease were less likely to start AM treatment than patients without this condition (adjusted HR of 0.67 (95% CI 0.56-0.83)). Current users of prednisolone were more likely to start AM treatment than non-users ((adjusted HR 1.93 (95% CI 1.68-2.23). Conclusions Our results showed that more Danish SLE patients should be prescribed AMs, especially patients with renal disease, to be in agreement with evidence based international guidelines.

From a human rights and humanitarian perspective, the human element of maritime security is worthy of specific focus, particularly in light of the present world economic crisis. This crisis has highlighted the threats of human trafficking and maritime migrant smuggling, both of which are long-standing issues. These issues are prevalent in many areas of the globe. The Caribbean has for decades had a particularly acute problem in these areas. However, from a maritime perspective, maritime migrant smuggling is more topical in light of the sea transportation element. A combination of desperation and dissatisfaction has for years influenced numerous persons to flee north by boat, thereby endangering, and in many instances losing, their lives. This work explores the motivations behind and the methods employed in such travel within the region, the major places of origin and destination, and the International Conventional response to the problems. Ulitmately, it focuses on Jamaica and suggests legislative and other measures to tackle the problem of Haitians arriving in Jamaica illegally by boat.","inCitations":["d0e7373943319b661b1edafbf2a14745b6f8be1c"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"The Human Element of Maritime Security and the 21st Century Challenges","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

This buffer material is expected to fill up the space between the canisters containing the waste and the surrounding ground by swelling. To produce the specifications, such as dry density, sandbentonite mass ratio, and dimensions, of the buffer material, the swelling characteristics of compacted bentonite and sandbentonite mixtures must be evaluated quantitatively. New equations for evaluating the swelling behavior of compacted bentonite and sandbentonite mixtures are presented that can accommodate the influences of the sandbentonite mass ratio and the exchangeable-cation composition of bentonite. The new method for predicting swelling characteristics is presented by combining the new equations with the theoretical equations of the GouyChapman diffuse double layer theory and of the van der Waals force, which can evaluate the repulsive and attractive forces ...","inCitations":["5a54969541dd29d1be5a433227035217291d0835","a2356eab92d06f3f0c9231f9535ea3a3eb079f5c","33c37cd7fabc9eebeb4dafcbe75c6cccb9e709fb","61089ab90473bcaa179d37ceb8b75c6696a6a74a","175c62cf3a4892dc6051faa83fdc5e2c168e0f79","d35ad607e284cf12c658e75dbd968f78a77b9bc8","2b4edc2373d6b2ba36b130f516c5dafb495e953e","16b036f097c3f598da9f92bd5762b98d27682b71","cfb4d66fe1f5e09abf97e08c7622ae1be8027906","7a47fe7ff8e4b7ed911ac5336d9a1d4049724845","ef1f8f2706e65a4e3641b77c0ead10b44bfbe81e","0ad01b4a3a0d2c4e6ce84218370ba01797a1dbec","ddfb6efc44ab3c9348e724eac251156305f55dea","c67a4f48e60d124ddd81e32d153273f1fe10b7d7","566c862808da44a7eef94c91be298e356e667e95","d40b520691673db9a303752f434665dbfe30ccdc","fee9210e4dd4d8fd9cb166aa0f847103f391a3bf","480495599f85f18810729d489c80d557b7d27e20","4a147677ed3e772f74da8c4966c2e3ff76067d0c","2979e24b09ab0efc59509ebc95547808ef2f7c26","645643bd16984a7b1e61f6d01a510108da65abf5","4ba4c66d64a62c6541743c0cc22f02f5c4101ff4","ba34785ee6377b64709fc232c2d89e5cfdbab24f","f568ce4cb20218c42bfed33cec8bc845bff21a7d","075e244300086f517b86877ac9b9f8ef689f614f","7675a6693d99749b4eabe6c13c993b73f2183271","fa436efe87e8f8262b69ebbf221c1397868129d6","84d85eb985d204ca5be107beaf4ffc4eeeec1d44","84b3ebd1fd907d1da64948204b28f9e2dbc5e20c","f5c53d75ec2349e7ab710b4b6bfde2be67a6574f","e53fdd2b2080d4a4a1f9c4bb31d7fb431827882d","d98f0735b1e5bad4da1afdcda5cb030103018fa3","b957197a3a086697b3da23ed0e70338606d1f10d","7f5357a95c26f616e9fc8c07a8612286149db329"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"New equations for swelling characteristics of bentonite-based buffer materials","doi":"10.1139/t02-115","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1139/t02-115","venue":""}

Especially jasmonic acid (JA) and salicylic acid (SA) are well known defense-inducing hormones. Here, the effects of MeJA and SA on the Arabidopsis thaliana kinome were monitored using PepChip arrays containing kinase substrate peptides to analyze posttranslational interactions in MeJA and SA signaling pathways and to test if kinome profiling can provide leads to predict posttranslational events in plant signaling. MeJA and SA mediate differential phosphorylation of substrates for many kinase families. Also some plant specific substrates were differentially phosphorylated, including peptides derived from Phytochrome A, and Photosystem II D protein. This indicates that MeJA and SA mediate cross-talk between defense signaling and light responses. We tested the predicted effects of MeJA and SA using light-mediated upward leaf movement (differential petiole growth also called hyponastic growth). We found that MeJA, infestation by the JA-inducing insect herbivore Pieris rapae, and SA suppressed low light-induced hyponastic growth. MeJA and SA acted in a synergistic fashion via two (partially) divergent signaling routes. This work demonstrates that kinome profiling using PepChip arrays can be a valuable complementary ∼omics tool to give directions towards predicting behavior of organisms after a given stimulus and can be used to obtain leads for physiological relevant phenomena in planta.","inCitations":["276a16e2b1733fb639a3fa899923dc08ef25c237","71e998489dd62d90965b13508ff8246a1d9e8874","2175433d04e14fc304fd09e413a30fd48b8aacd6","b583f25541ec723d9a559c8a5e7eb5ffe16fab3a","438b77f5118b26de96053c365dc6871e6cc6dce6","16975e79b687273f5299088c9cc8718d3dacc39e","7145429a59947067cbb1f203d55bebef593182c7","1ca10b977b1cd41c65e532f0f9f180179b763e6e","8e1ec25cf40c4f0e0fcc7b4e0230d7cf16cb2bfb","3882f06eb17c905af7c1a220cddfde101febc650","1b3e0f2782bf0f57ccb46f566fb707486665df23","7a4c4ebe360208cbfb9658819e961e1f3242b62f","90a77dbe0df3b9514611db4f82bf45e97196ba75","bd221c760c1e1469dec03c86d5811f678bd40cca"],"pdfUrls":["http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0014255&type=printable","ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/pmc/73/66/PLoS_One_2010_Dec_8_5(12)_e14255.tar.gz"],"title":"Kinome Profiling Reveals an Interaction Between Jasmonate, Salicylate and Light Control of Hyponastic Petiole Growth in Arabidopsis thaliana","doi":"10.1371/journal.pone.0014255","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0014255","venue":"PloS one"}
