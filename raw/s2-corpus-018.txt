Cobalt bioaccumulation by Rhodopseudomonas palustris via different metabolic pathways was investigated for various pH levels, temperatures, co-cations and initial Co2+ concentrations. The distribution of cobalt and its chemical nature in R. palustris were examined by cell compartmentalization and X-ray diffraction analysis. Our results indicated that biomass and bioaccumulation capacity were superior under aerobic conditions in the dark at pH 6.5 and 30 °C. Cobalt removal efficiency and bioaccumulation capacity were, respectively, 84.9% and 287.18 mg/g for cultures with an initial Co2+ concentration of 160 mg/L. A pseudo-second-order kinetic model fits the removal process well (R2 = 0.9508–0.9913). Co2+ removal efficiency was not significantly influenced by Cu2+, Zn2+, Cd2+, Mn2+ or Fe2+ but was influenced by Ni2+.

The Ne spectrum is used to determine accurately the zero energy change position for subsequent analysis of the three other systems. Six capture channels have been unambiguously identified for Ar, all producing Ar + in the ground [3p 5 2 P 0 ] state. Kr exhibited eight capture channels and Xe seven, with both systems exhibiting spin-orbit splitting of the 2 P 3 2 , 1 2 state, Kr + being split by 0.67 eV and Xe + by 1.3 eV. The Kr + spectrum is neatly ordered into four well separated doublet peaks, whereas the relationship between doublets for Xe + is less obvious. Using a statistical model to compare the expected populations of the spin-orbit states of Kr + and Xe + to the observed populations, a novel method for calculating the gradient of the reaction window for systems which exhibit spin-orbit splitting has been developed. By comparing partial cross section data from all collision systems under study the results were found to be in good agreement with the Landau-Zener curve-crossing model.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Single electron capture by B2+ ions in Ne, Ar, Kr and Xe","doi":"10.1016/S0168-1176(97)00059-1","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/S0168-1176%2897%2900059-1","venue":""}

The low-temperature photoluminescence (PL) probes the topmost GaN layer (<100 nm) where any influence from the oxide is expected. Thermal oxidation results in a 6 meV blue shift of the main PL band (3.478 eV) that is attributed to stress due to formation of GaON/β-Ga2O3 upon the GaN surface. A weak PL feature at ∼3.38 eV is due to diffusion of oxygen into the GaN. The Al2O3 deposited by ALD does not result in the 3.38 eV band following deposition and subsequent annealing. In contrast, HfO2 deposited by ALD results in sub-band gap features, which strengthen upon annealing. No appreciable stress is observed for either oxide deposited using ALD, which are not expected to produce GaON/β-Ga2O3 layer.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://digital.library.txstate.edu/bitstream/handle/10877/8203/2014-Optical-studies-of-the-effect-of-oxidation.pdf?isAllowed=y&sequence=1"],"title":"Optical studies of the effect of oxidation on GaN","doi":"10.1116/1.4858467","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1116/1.4858467","venue":""}

The collaborative learning model described in this paper identifies the specific characteristics exhibited by effective collaborative learning teams, and based on these characteristics, suggests strategies for promoting effective peer interaction. The model is designed to help an intelligent collaborative learning system recognize and target group interaction problem areas. We describe the empirical evaluation of two collaborative learning tools that automate the analysis of peer interaction and activity. Results from our study confirm that effective learning teams are comprised of active participants who demand explanations and justification from their peers. The results also suggest that structured, high-level knowledge of student conversation and activity appears to be sufficient for automating the assessment of group interaction, furthering the possibility of an intelligent collaborative learning system that can support and enhance the group learning process.","inCitations":["871d56f84e973462bb8c6ca3058ad5f3a0682749","1f748e437090160a049689c9a2c50dd8ae556be4","7506848a953229a3cbea48e9728e062526ee227c","69d65bf1a8914443192d9f4c56c30df8eb1755c5","b40ae9083cc242494bea667f6a1ef51881c030b4","35cae811fcf7300ca53dbb5f89c5500e3e58884c","37685a1a194a7ca5678b6ae88712a0e135d5c3fc","2dbe2675589352e93f33f6496dda80a0b99d6fcc","4f6e700a942a6ec796f4f35b4a21cb5d07172b0e","481fc6bb9a8565a982bad29462e94c0650e7965e","34f8fed473286651a85aed63dcea6984963f21a4","ada31c0c65dd40bff019c4f19b1f1f2701247666","b6527a76df37e59df2d6eff29d9c6d832bac7b2b","e8df43b5ffa372a313e97055e031ffeb207924e7","a203d4ea9b0d1e68df35ae7cc5932259973e425e","8eb26ea6753f30bcaecdda47faa30d078892bfe6","0094c297a2bcf6a2205ea66cae8484ad1773610b","0453cb2bc282bb25010350508c89ae4737b65293","79ae63f3b493396189aedcc7fcaf1988ccc16983","35eee215a482b52b55758e2967d058222abe3c76","7b66b6331baf143b4b88ba41de99f382a9633c85","0703c7672a35dd9a85b0509ad2b2c61a8a5e5336","4ff41bef4da91170568652f91576a665f03aa24d","890f20c7832381ea7a283ef8a6b572d434fed0ac","1cdf0763d05c150d9a2e0f9696b0c813761799bd","1d82605b8749f7d17a1277bf2b777bc4071a6951","29213f0386e32fa21cf41db20ba657de54774291","0a58b0e5b8f009f1da21cb7973166ca14aeca8e0","1a48e1169e0389a3fdb48e64c736ac092a6f3724","7b1b9604b15505bf28271f111aa02952072acfae","ec969c80b44d7a7e37206f49b20b1ee1da9ed378","4b61dc5e974f30db050f256daf2ae06f07ab2b62","f455586b59702f7e7f1db5abe610eb7adfce66f6","9b80627f9f010f03c792a904587a530d2ffe7510","254de0c5477d34c418305dcd521c1971b8f2f601","12ca92e064d28a703130e1e122001bf313b9a978","2491806e7749bbe7204a7c18d5536d0002708d91","0652fcb46c91193cc4ca8dfe85c0d9883a6459cc","1a44d202684c18cadf4258c92a6784f2b621662b","86e976bbec5dc5008946d8b0cd4e1cc2e2f5cfef","771d3e54660995155d26ad17e2558a8c4792da69","1688b56d02db8567926b393cfc3a4297f04ea4b1"],"pdfUrls":["http://sra.itc.it/people/soller/documents/Soller-etal-AAAI-99.ps","http://www.aaai.org/Papers/Symposia/Fall/1999/FS-99-03/FS99-03-017.pdf","https://www.mitre.org/sites/default/files/pdf/peer_interaction.pdf"],"title":"What Makes Peer Interaction Effective?

Patients with end-stage liver disease are at high risk of infection with multidrug-resistant organisms, which may affect the outcome of LT. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of pre-transplant infection on the outcome of living-donor LT.\n\n\nMethods\nProspective follow-up was done for 50 patients with chronic liver disease who had had LT performed from September 2013 to December 2017. We divided patients into group 1 (patients who had had infection within 3 months before transplantation with adequate treatment [n=20]), and group 2 (patients without infection [n=30]). Both groups were followed for 4 months post-operatively.\n\n\nResults\nPatients with high Model for End-Stage Liver Disease scores were more susceptible to infection pre- and post-operatively, and chest infection was the most common infection pre-transplant. There were no significant statistical differences regarding hospital and ICU stay and post-operative course between the groups, but the mortality rate was higher in group 1 (40%) than in group 2 (23.3%), and the causes of mortality in the group 1 were mainly due to medical causes (infections and sepsis, 75%) versus 28.6% in group 2.\n\n\nConclusion\nLiver-cell failure and concomitant infection 3 months before LT with adequate treatment had no significant statistical differences regarding hospital, ICU stay, or medical complications, but post-operative infection and mortality rate were more frequent in group 1 and the causes of mortality were mainly medical.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://www.dovepress.com/getfile.php?fileID=51489","https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/pmc/oa_pdf/db/06/idr-12-2277.PMC6661986.pdf"],"title":"Impact of pre-transplant infection management on the outcome of living-donor liver transplantation in Egypt","doi":"10.2147/IDR.S208954","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.2147/IDR.S208954","venue":"Infection and drug resistance"}

Comparison of the intrinsic kinetic characteristics (obtained at zero driving force of the CPET reaction) shows that consistency is indeed observed after a careful identification and quantitation of side factors (electrical work terms, image force effects). Water (in water) appears as a better intrinsic proton acceptor than hydrogen phosphate in both cases in terms of reorganization energy and pre-exponential factor, corroborating the mechanism by which electron transfer is concerted with Grotthus-type proton translocation in water. Detailed compared analysis of the approaches also revealed that modest but significant electric field effects may be at work in the electrochemical case. Comparison with phenoxide ion oxidation, taken as a reference outer-sphere electron transfer, points to a CPET precursor complex that possesses a precise spatial structure allowing the formation of one or several H-bonds as required by the occurrence of the CPET reaction, thus decreasing considerably the number of efficient collisions compared with those undergone by structureless spherical reactants.","inCitations":["d3f62f6f6809ba32ee8cf413f771fc2f00cf235c","e66760e6f659cd6827c3399158704b33fc4483ae","69e8fee26fcaccb1f417f322dd0269f9c399b60f"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Concerted proton-electron transfers.

In more technical language, the fitnesses of different phenotypes are frequency-dependent. Evolutionary game theory has been developed to analyse such cases. In this paper I aim to do three things. First, I describe the concepts of evolutionary game theory in the context of a simple game, the Hawk-Dove game, and compare them with the concepts of classical game theory originating with Von Neumann and Morgenstern (1953) [1]. Second, I list some of the applications of the theory. Finally, I suggest how the theory can tell us something about the evolution of learning.","inCitations":["4f9d7843a141b92b7f21bacf1d70a3d5488f4490","b981fa3e0aad562682a1ad03c9b3e4bc3fb62d35","b48d13991d77f3d3c131cec7527daef0e5587734","623acd34ae535bc3d9af4c3d167e6decfafd5070","3cba5c52edd25aba56a4399f1cb3a303ce2bec0e","df10e2e9ca7fe27a123daa6253db690b1f3d807d","f210aa8a21465c5f4aa366ef03e636beee0e0a80","cf69d12d40a315e7e65334c0d42505f5b396bcb9","505c58c2c100e7512b7f7d906a9d4af72f6e8415","17a313885496324bafc9e4cdff22a8466d82514b","42d17937aa9778eea6d073385b44341e8aff3583","2ff7eab9a3da8be7fd05dbb6a4c4b71b1e52a43d","d66216a2a12d7f3014567772565b34dd213c09a5","080cfebc0723e9e57a03d1268a3f0c3ac1292a32","a730fdbe73ed97f01e7fb4d07c406ebcc1d89789","9125e34b8eeaf680582e905bdf0b62c9f837e27e","fcbc36461f3c9a9149ec4ffa27fef8fd3a8ab840","c7e5ee29b89d3793a8f20ee74bd4240f4e78f4c7"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Evolutionary game theory","doi":"10.1016/0167-2789(86)90232-0","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/0167-2789%2886%2990232-0","venue":""}

Secara tidak langsung ialah dengan memberikan dukungan kepada penguasa politik (kepala daerah), sedangkan secara langsung ialah dengan menjadi anggota legislatif (DPR) dan tampil sebagai khalifah/raja atau kepala daerah. Ada tiga faktor kaum sufi memasuki kancah politik, yaitu kedekatan tokoh sufi dengan penguasa politik (penguasa), keinginan menyeharikan nilai-nilai Islam, dan tanggung jawab teologis. Keterkaitan dengan politik ini memiliki dampak positif dan negatif. Dampak positifnya ialah semakin memudahkan menyeharikan ajaran Islam dalam kehidupan yang lebih luas. Sedangkan dampak negatifnya ialah tergoresnya ajaran sufi yang asli yang dipahami secara tradisional yang pesimis. Untuk mengurangi dampak negatif tersebut kehadiran tasawuf modern atau tasawuf fungsional menjadi kata kunci. Dengan demikian terdapat hubungan yang erat di antara kaum sufi dengan politik, yaitu sama-sama berupaya menyeharikan nilai Islam dalam kehidupan sebagai sebuah tanggung jawab teologis.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"TAREQAT DAN POLITIK; Studi Kiprah Politik Kaum Sufi","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Automated Multi-Level Substructuring (AMLS) was developed to meet similar challenges in the automotive industry and has become an automotive industry standard. The current aerospace industry standard, MSC NASTRAN using a LANCZOS eigensolver algorithm, requires more time and resources for identical response computations with large automotive models. This paper compares AMLS computation of response for large models of ultra-lightweight aerospace structures to response computed using the LANCZOS algorithm implemented in NASTRAN. Model sizes range from several thousand to hundreds of thousands of degrees-of-freedom. Further comparisons include computation using AMLS on a single-processor workstation and a single processor of a supercomputer. Unlike LANCZOS, AMLS is amenable to parallelization, so performance is also evaluated on a multi-processor supercomputer. Timing studies were conducted for the evaluations. Results demonstrate that AMLS requires less computational time and effort than LANCZOS for these models. Parallelization using up to eight processors significantly reduced the time to compute the response. Specific studies included thin-film reflector dynamic response with variation of curvature and inflatable torus support structures with self-stiffening designs. An additional aspect of this effort was development of model generators to create large models.","inCitations":["63d0df63658fa3211661f7a9d1d590e4a1f839a5"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Efficient Computation of Dynamic Response of Large Flexible Spacecraft","doi":"10.2514/6.2005-2051","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.2514/6.2005-2051","venue":""}

We examine how the exchange rate affects the supply of short-term debt facing the government. We show that under a credible hard peg (currency board), default is a more likely outcome, even without an exceptionally large short-term debt, precisely because a devaluation is not an option. In a more conventional fixed peg, it can be optimal for the government to choose a level of the exchange rate that would be likely to result in partial or complete debt default. Depending on the exchange rate regime, multiple equilibria exist, in one of which the interest rate is high, the exchange rate is overvalued, output is low, and default is high. Under a hard peg, there is a unique equilibrium.","inCitations":["556bc67d934e95c1cf3d6c9d85d4ea365d1587ad","1eb8b519e79151624ae2cfa21a6059add7121dcb","6b0493515d31c41144447aecbdad68a870f18566","c232a8874e2ecc6a25cd0533c1a23e32d8723e02","9a302017c39868fc7eb2c694875e13ec3b5301f7","09acec8cb1bf99c42170003912aeef63151b451d","6919a21f9dc07d994a7750e674347ba9dbb06fc1","c858ad1dd9f4f5f44ab708eb23fdf6d103fb2b16","3f7f110bca6fdf23c11b7ebf8d0ede9c34725775","5fc7f0cfa0874c197e38e17e5286e881f6c0b0dc"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Exchange Rate Policy and Debt Crises in Emerging Economies","doi":"10.5089/9781451848076.001","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.5089/9781451848076.001","venue":""}

Previous studies of this device have focused primarily on laminar flow regimes, and have shown that the maximum aerodynamic power conversion can achieve values of about 34 %. The comparative analyses of the energy extraction process in a realistic turbulent flow regime and an ideal laminar regime, reported for the first time in this article, highlight that a) substantial differences of the flow aerodynamics exist between the two cases, b) the maximum efficiency of the device in turbulent conditions achieves values of nearly 40 %, and c) further improvement of the efficiency observed in turbulent flow conditions is achievable by optimizing the kinematic characteristics of the device. The theory underlying the implementation of the adopted compressible turbulent flow solver, and several novel algorithmic features associated with its strongly coupled explicit multigrid integration of the flow and turbulence equations, are also presented.","inCitations":["7b73f0b46ad103aff59f1a1cd1d7d95871658869"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Analysis of an Oscillating Wing in a Power-Extraction Regime Based on the Compressible Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes Equations and the K–ω SST Turbulence Model","doi":"10.1115/GT2013-94531","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1115/GT2013-94531","venue":""}

Although\n protective in the short-term, stress responses may have pathological long-term\n effects presumably due to a prolonged, inadequate, or\n exaggerated endocrinologic and autonomic\n functioning. Stress hormones, like cortisol, are\n supposed to contribute to the pathogenesis of psychiatric disorders by having\n devastating consequences on brain function and structure,\n predominantly on brain regions that are crucial for emotional processes and the evaluation of stressful\n situations (e.g., the amygdala). Pathological brain changes as well as behavioral outcomes (e.g., anhedonia)\n similar to that observed in human patients suffering from stress-related\n psychiatric disorders, can be provoked in animals by exposing them to\n stressful situations. Thus, animal models are widely used in neurobiological\n research to mimic certain aspects of these diseases aiming to understand the\n neuronal mechanisms involved in their aetiologies.\n The primary objective of this project was to examine stress-induced neuronal\n plasticity and stability within the main\n output station of the amygdala, i.e., the\n central nucleus. The central nucleus has a key role in the mediation of\n physiological and behavioral stress responses and is strongly involved in the\n hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis regulating\n the production of\n stress hormones. For the purpose of this project, the first step was to\n establish and evaluate a suitable stress paradigm for our animal model, the\n Short-tailed fruit bat, Carollia perspicillata. For evaluating the selected stress\n paradigm (i.e., chronic immobilization stress) a two-stage approach was chosen. First, a noninvasive and feedback free method for\n measuring fecal cortisol\n as a reliable physiological parameter for stress was successfully established and verified in the bat. Second,\n stress effects on the locomotor and exploratory behavior were examined by adapting a commonly used behavioral paradigm for characterizing stress coping\n styles in animals (i.e., the elevated plus maze) to bats.\n For\n stress induction, adult bats were subjected to chronic immobilization stress\n (one hour per day) over a period of ten days. For the stress hormone\n measurements, fecal samples were collected pre- and\n poststress. Following chronic immobilization, all\n animals studied exhibited a significant increase in fecal\n cortisol concentrations compared to prestress conditions suggesting that repetitive immobilization\n over ten days represented an effective stressor in this bat species. The successful establishment of a method for fecal cortisol analysis in the Short-tailed fruit bat, C. perspicillata,\n provides a practical tool for wildlife and stress research.\n For the behavioral study, the locomotor\n and exploratory behavior of each animal was\n analyzed in a custom-made plus maze for bats, consisting of four arms: two\n oppositely oriented arms were left sound-transmissive\n (termed “open”), whereas both of the other arms were made\n sound-reflective (termed \"enclosed\"). The plus maze was designed\n 3-dimensionally because of the bats' ability to fly. In this newly invented\n design, the behaviors of the stressed animals were\n compared with a control group (not subjected to immobilization) with respect\n to the percentage of time spent in the open arms and the flight activity in\n the entire maze. The results show that chronic immobilization stress changes\n the locomotor and exploratory behavior\n of C. perspicillata.\n Moreover, when exposed to the plus maze, stressed bats seem to display two\n divergent adaptive behaviors, apparently indicating\n different coping strategies of the individuals.\n The neuroanatomical part of this project was scheduled in two\n steps: First, based on cytoarchitectonic properties, an\n exhaustive parcellation of the bat's amygdala was done which did\n not exist for C. perspicillata\n before. Second, by\n measuring nuclear volume, total number of neurons, and neuronal soma size,\n stress-induced neuronal plasticity and stability within the central nucleus\n of the amygdala was examined. Following chronic\n immobilization stress, significant decreased neuronal soma sizes within the\n right central nucleus and a slight decline in the nuclear volume of the left\n central nucleus of the amygdala were found. These\n findings were in line with recent literature demonstrating that brain regions\n involved in the neuronal processes for emotions and the mediation of\n behavioral and physiological responses are affected by stress itself.\n The\n central nucleus is often\n traditionally viewed as a passive relay of outputs of the basolateral\n complex toward downstream brainregions. This\n project supports recent evidence suggesting that the central nucleus may also\n be a target of neuroplastic changes and emphasizes\n its possible role in the cellular mechanisms underlying stress-related\n disorders.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Keeping the gate","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

By applying these procedures, the present method has succeeded in overcoming the main difficulty of computation in the large-amplitude sloshing analysis. In the Lagrengian calculation, a new fractional step method that satisfies the free-surface boundary condition has been applied, and treatment of the free surface on the multi-sloped wall boundary has been advanced. In the remeshing procedure, a method based on boundary-fitted coordinates is introduced. Numerical results are compared with experimental results, and it is shown that this method is sufficiently accurate to calculate the three-dimensional sloshing.

Its subsequent development was shaped by a succession of qualifications and elaborations that stressed how prisons differed from one another in their scale, regime, composition, and conceptions of prisoners' rights.

It presents a study that deals with some properties of phosphorylase from fat body of Locusta migratoria and its regulation by hormone(s) from the corpora cardiaca (CC). Locust fat body contains active phosphorylase a (AMP-independent) and inactive phosphorylase b (AMP-dependent). Results of various incubation experiments with crude extracts of fat body showed the presence of phosphorylase b kinase activity, being ATP and Mg 2+ dependent, and of phosphorylase phosphatase activity that is inhibited by NaF. Each of these enzymes may be involved in the regulation of phosphorylase activity and, thus, of the rate of glycogenolysis. Injection of locusts with CC-extract results in the activation of fat body phosphorylase. At least, a part of this effect may be attributed to adipokinetic hormone (AKH) produced by the CC as shown by the injection of synthetic AKH. As little as 0.02 pmol AKH—corresponding with 0.0001 pair CC equivalents—causes a significant increase of phosphorylase activity compared with water-injected controls.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Properties of Fat Body Glycogen Phosphorylase in Relation to Flight Directed Carbohydrate Mobilization in Locusts","doi":"10.1016/B978-0-08-028845-1.50069-X","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-08-028845-1.50069-X","venue":""}

In four chapters, I examine films, literary texts, and selected academic and intellectual prose that engage astrology and its symbolism as a response to the experience of modernity in Germany. Often this response is couched within the context of a return to early modern German culture, the historical period when astrology last had popular validity. Proceeding from the understanding of astrology as a multiplicity of practices with their own histories, my dissertation analyzes the specific forms of astrological discourse that are taken up in early twentieth-century German culture. In my first chapter I examine the revival of astrology in Germany from the perspective of Oscar A. H. Schmitz (1873-1931), who galvanized a community of astrologers to use the term Erfahrungswissenschaft to promote astrology diagnostically, as an art of discursive subject formation. In my second chapter, I discuss how Paul Wegener's Golem film cycle both responds to and intensifies the astrological and the occult revivals. As the revivals gain momentum, Wegener explicitly depicts seventeenth-century astrological and occult practices with the intention of generating a \"purely filmic\" experience. I provide new insight into Wegener's last Golem film through the film architect Hans Poelzig's personal investment in both baroque architecture and contemporary astrology. My third chapter explores Aby M. Warburg's lifelong preoccupation with the investigation of astrological symbolism in art. This pursuit led him to create an institution that has played a pivotal role in the material conditions of possibility for people to study the history of astrology, even today. In my fourth chapter, I investigate the many references to astrological phenomena in Walter Benjamin's intellectual work. I read his work on mimesis and experience alongside his practice of graphology in order to situate him in the debates brought up in the first chapter on the idea of astrology as an Erfahrungswissenschaft. My dissertation reveals how aspects of astrological discourse--specifically its approaches to issues of legibility and interpretation--constructively informed and shaped the middle brow (Schmitz) and the high brow (Warburg), the cinematic (Wegener) and the literary (Schmitz), the institutional (Warburg) and the philosophical (Benjamin) realms of early twentieth-century German culture.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://digitalassets.lib.berkeley.edu/etd/ucb/text/Zahrt_berkeley_0028E_12179.pdf"],"title":"The Astrological Imaginary in Early Twentieth-Century German Culture","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Indices have been developed to help in the identification and monitoring of drought and characterization of its severity. In this context, this work aimed at assessing the temporal variability of the Standardized Precipitation Index in Lebanon for improved understanding of drought occurrence. This is expected to help in mitigation and response actions to future drought circumstances across the country. The methodology of work involved the calculation of the Standardized Precipitation Index over different time series from four regions across the country using both the Variability Analysis of Surface Climate Observations (VASClimO) gridded rainfall dataset for the period 1951–2000 and the European rainfall dataset E-OBS for the period 1950–2014. In general, higher precipitation values were recorded by the VASClimO dataset than those coming from the E-OBS dataset. Intra-annual precipitation changes showed increasing precipitation starting in September-October and decreasing precipitation starting in February. The VASClimO dataset showed a 50% increase in the frequency of severe drought conditions, while the E-OBS dataset indicated a 60% increase in the frequency of moderate drought conditions. In addition, it was observed that the winter of 2014, characterized by extreme drought conditions, was the driest in the past 56 years. Although specific years were commonly characterized by severe to extreme drought conditions with the use of both datasets, considerable differences between the two datasets were observed with respect to the identification of the degree of wet and dry conditions for some other years. Overall, trend lines for the Standardized Precipitation Index values, as derived from VASClimO and E-OBS datasets, commonly point to a relatively slight increase in drought conditions mainly in the winter-spring season; however, the situation on the ground could vary greatly given that many other environmental factors (e.g., changes in land cover) may also play an important role in affecting drought conditions.","inCitations":["b7c714fc5870ac474ebe5d0602bb06b9e015e016","271ad361a7183a00294a9df12048aa5124c73eed","f0eee8e63d047bad0beef1382e2ae2f7891119c9","cdc154425d7ed88c9825700bad76a31717339b3d","f0b8ba5dfefb8033f8c27c13cfefcc8f83e1b504","df36be849dbec6cbc00cf87d047979dda8f17bf5","bfe6ea07488f363530950966f18ec3b1d2b2f96d","188410f1f018221f0b9164c7a2f4e848e4e5007b"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.mdpi.com/2225-1154/4/2/27/pdf"],"title":"Investigating the Temporal Variability of the Standardized Precipitation Index in Lebanon","doi":"10.3390/cli4020027","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.3390/cli4020027","venue":""}

Multicore logic-memory die stacking has been considered as one candidate for 3D ICs by utilizing the TSV to provide high data bandwidth between logic and memory. However, 3D ICs suffer from the low-yield issue. This article proposes effective yield-enhancement techniques for multicore die-stacked 3D ICs. Two reconfiguration schemes are proposed to logically swap the positions of cores in the dies of 3D ICs such that the yield of 3D ICs is increased. Two algorithms also are proposed to determine the reconfiguration effectively. Simulation results show that the proposed reconfiguration schemes can achieve a yield gain ranging from 1% to 11%.","inCitations":["3a60ce29a6ac6d5561d44a35172c033de0cff885"],"pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/2567933"],"title":"Yield-enhancement schemes for multicore processor and memory stacked 3D ICs","doi":"10.1145/2567933","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1145/2567933","venue":"TECS"}

Recently developed direct-acting antivirals targeting hepatitis C virus (HCV) enzymes reportedly increase the virologic response to therapy but may lead to a selection of drug-resistant variants. Besides direct-acting antivirals, another promising class of HCV drugs in development include host targeting agents that are responsible for interfering with the host factors crucial for the viral life cycle. A family of host proteins known as DEAD-box RNA helicases, characterized by nine conserved motifs, is known to play an important role in RNA metabolism. Several members of this family such as DDX3, DDX5 and DDX6 have been shown to play a role in HCV replication and this review will summarize our current knowledge on their interaction with HCV. As chronic hepatitis C is one of the leading causes of hepatocellular carcinoma, the involvement of DEAD-box RNA helicases in the development of HCC will also be highlighted. Continuing research on the interaction of host DEAD-box proteins with HCV and the contribution to viral replication and pathogenesis could be the panacea for the development of novel therapeutics against HCV.","inCitations":["43c93aa801a10a9118878665b8f65a31ec120cd2","47742b4fd09c5bf1e105b33316a9e0a6fa210674","db7b65577c85cf659463ed091c5866afabbfa582","c83490670b121405627c160d980c3efcb6d374dd","9561552ddb7b238b2f4d928fbdfe07ceed55ae1b","e7d6eb18b3cffbf1dfa5449a2f0ad89b2897e6a4","ba1a34ae67fb2dcd9ad6cdf6d5b5e1fc32202839","96cb8642bc772cbc519af39243eec2809cbba57e","ae7abee06ed353bbb2d85218f5a5f953cbc9db41","5bcd3c424887a848429ff1027ac2aacf50944fbf","9c5f699cfbc7cb24c42d0a7f6eabaa4f0184714d","ac5c5b3983f791b7124f106e537583ca61a83a19"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Understanding the interaction of hepatitis C virus with host DEAD-box RNA helicases.","doi":"10.3748/wjg.v20.i11.2913","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.3748/wjg.v20.i11.2913","venue":"World journal of gastroenterology"}

Although initial studies showed a critical contribution of IL-17 and Th17 cells in mediating autoimmune B cell responses in BXD2 mice, the role of follicular helper T (Tfh) cells remains incompletely understood. We found that both the frequency of Th17 cells and the levels of IL-17 in circulation in BXD2 mice were comparable to those of wild-type. By contrast, the frequency of PD-1+ CXCR5+ Tfh cells was significantly increased in BXD2 mice compared with wild-type mice, while the frequency of PD-1+ CXCR5+ Foxp3+ follicular regulatory T (Tfr) cells was reduced in the former group. The frequency of Tfh cells rather than that of Th17 cells was positively correlated with the frequency of germinal center B cells as well as the levels of autoantibodies to dsDNA. More importantly, CXCR5+ CD4+ T cells isolated from BXD2 mice induced the production of IgG from naïve B cells in an IL-21-dependent manner, while CCR6+ CD4+ T cells failed to do so. These results together demonstrate that Tfh cells rather than Th17 cells contribute to the autoimmune germinal center reactions in BXD2 mice.","inCitations":["ff0c22a95cc9690e31a42b678201babf54f4704a","7153f99bbc5d29675efa0267ba73087a4d2efacf","63da7f5730b2e66f6b3100c4121f6ce11576b906","756db4f4dccfbe840fb8496f48794861ba31e30c","b641c417c513a57d4e3a1f8a842c2164b02a0f34","7b7f1650000cfe7837c3a2020075544833853eb0","bf4e2c1a40bbc30f18130f9e4725a79f25e6d5c2","4eb169a04e7885603c352a251de8963b987e5c01","3fd6947bf34b81567839a2c7a8482b85a41943ce","9933b7620e8d87b517970e30326020d515078dfa","1465e0a020ee6213a51245c9780545dbbea7de12","d368e2bf5867b0e122dd74db0a481f153bc7abf4","fcaf3fee0927ff0c3fa4ec8e3d04cc76346c92f6","bac9acaf700ea6afdfd6ff63cb1390dace7b72c2","0b6218ee5e097a7975d43de761b31e7b2a1a5fbc","4f1082e4c1af39b2a0434fd1b1cedbe3ee741c42","b327d5b03ad1631a1b91af1108aeecb69e95ce9d","fc791ef7fbb5997867e3ec17329782019e291456","37ae853716d1d53b786cd6f089184db3eccb8970","ac003ef8de6fb53631802db2c490d59eae2f8cb9","02fe929794573335c13cf60eadaf56f5f5b3087e"],"pdfUrls":["http://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/pmc/1a/66/pone.0120294.PMC4358919.pdf","https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0120294.s001&type=supplementary","https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0120294&type=printable"],"title":"Regulation of Autoimmune Germinal Center Reactions in Lupus-Prone BXD2 Mice by Follicular Helper T Cells","doi":"10.1371/journal.pone.0120294","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0120294","venue":"PloS one"}

A resuscitation regimen that modulates this coagulopathy may prove beneficial. We sought to evaluate the effects of lactated Ringer's (LR) solution and Hextend on the resuscitation of uncontrolled hemorrhagic shock.\n\n\nMETHODS\nTwenty swine underwent invasive line placement, midline celiotomy, and splenectomy. After a 15-minute stabilization period, we recorded a baseline mean arterial pressure and created a grade V liver injury. The animals bled freely for 30 minutes, after which we measured the initial blood loss (that after injury). We blindly randomized the swine to receive LR solution or Hextend to achieve and maintain the baseline mean arterial pressure for 90 minutes postinjury. Laboratory values were obtained at baseline and on completion of the 2-hour study period.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe initial blood loss (before resuscitation) was 22 mL/kg in both treatment groups (p = 0.97). Animals required 119 +/- 78 mL/kg of fluid in the LR group and 40 +/- 21 mL/kg in the Hextend group (p = 0.01). After resuscitation, the secondary blood loss was 3.7 +/- 1.7 mL/kg in the LR group and 4.7 +/- 1.1 mL/kg in the Hextend group (p = 0.1). Thrombelastography revealed a hypercoagulable state in all animals after injury. This was less pronounced in those animals resuscitated with Hextend. Routine tests of coagulation did not reveal a hypercoagulable state.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nModulation and restoration of normal coagulation is critical in the management of trauma patients. The patient's coagulation profile might determine the type of fluid to be used at various times during their course. Thrombelastography is superior to routine coagulation assays for the detection of a hypercoagulable state. Resuscitation with Hextend results in a decreased fluid requirement and attenuation of hypercoagulability after injury without increased blood loss.","inCitations":["3fe96747ec703473b8bb1a864e29ef37af3e27cc","507c149d24c4f8bb7c5cef72f779fbd63559afad","1e0c56f8c850803e497854cc3b411c16c6f24e0e","6adc3f2fe2f3f6db87c14509453a9d22ab2f0a6d","3b5b56bc3f6cd6c2a502aaf9fd4510dc3c17c116","e69c09ea68fabf767b116ff237df4ddd9b11d9a7","f7c258b54886af1e816c9ac53a396e07ea8aaa05","0ad5146f3aa65fcd7cfbab6b6e68e020adc62d13","702dcc27ec5fedb8cbd6070bd8434984d64de866","7918b1e5957d892214ee18b772b87611917e0158","8164f05cdebb6e16595296d904179f4036b9bb6d","96549d896e0b058289ced08377df8eaf150ff833","4fa3f786f0e14337debbbd43c47ed8f4f34d79eb"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Hextend attenuates hypercoagulability after severe liver injury in swine.","doi":"10.1097/01.ta.0000177723.20678.bb","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1097/01.ta.0000177723.20678.bb","venue":"The Journal of trauma"}

The mechanism by which SIgA concentrates on mucosal surfaces is examined here using a tissue culture model with real saliva. Salivary mucins may initiate the formation of the mucosal pellicle through interactions with membrane-bound mucins on cells. Further protein interactions with mucins may then trigger binding of other pellicle proteins. HT29 colon cell lines, which when treated with methotrexate (HT29-MTX) produce a gel-forming mucin, were used to determine the importance of these mucin-mucin interactions. Binding of SIgA to cells was then compared using whole mouth saliva, parotid (mucin-free) saliva and a source of purified SIgA. Greatest SIgA binding occurred when WMS was incubated with HT29-MTX expressing mucus. Since salivary MUC5B was only able to bind to cells which produced mucus and purified SIgA showed little binding to the same cells we conclude that most SIgA binding to mucosal cells occurs because SIgA forms complexes with salivary mucins which then bind to cells expressing membrane-bound mucins. This work highlights the importance of mucin interactions in the development of the mucosal pellicle.","inCitations":["ca4be88f1d1a88d1abef0509cf12f30a327833f9","eedde296cf1644dcc55863d059d610e698b6169c","0637a8fb149bc7fd52ef5f26477b432f4df3ea13","edcc0ad9ca14035c079206323b6c164901e19406","3183428ca4dc0805ae6bebea2c40193f97ed8e80","d4f0b0400b3f7ef9dcdc39290ec4fd1a07586bcc","9c53cce89b8f41395bb79adab394ff7076ae6119","23c85793b209a0e64864d53209d60a3f41e5829f","434bf71a47527d40ddb56848e6abec8007da6ef8","06374faad276a389a252629e6e60d03e554e78f2","72abec306aa357f099b41df0b3d7259a7131a26d","3c7d83c172e1f3dcd47da74c55fc619e367ea697"],"pdfUrls":["http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0119677&type=printable","http://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/pmc/bf/b3/pone.0119677.PMC4368717.pdf","https://kclpure.kcl.ac.uk/portal/files/46194880/journal.pone.0119677.pdf"],"title":"SIgA Binding to Mucosal Surfaces Is Mediated by Mucin-Mucin Interactions","doi":"10.1371/journal.pone.0119677","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0119677","venue":"PloS one"}

Suction catheter aspiration is another technique, but it is not widely known and almost no data exist regarding its diagnostic efficiency. 272 patients were included in a prospective and randomised study between February 2007 and October 2009. All were referred for bronchoscopic evaluation of pulmonary nodules/masses or infiltrates. We compared the diagnostic yield of forceps biopsy and suction catheter aspiration for a definite diagnosis and looked at whether such a diagnosis depends on the underlying pulmonary change. All patients underwent bronchoscopy with forceps biopsy and catheter aspiration. A definitive diagnosis was reached in a total of 183 (67.3%) patients, with catheter aspiration in 140 (51.5%) patients and with forceps biopsy in 136 (50.0%) patients. In 90 (33.1%) patients, a definite diagnosis could only be reached with the combination of both techniques. The diagnostic yield of forceps biopsy was better than catheter aspiration in infiltrates (p = 0.027), but was no different in nodules or masses (p = 0.09). Suction catheter aspiration is a useful technique of bronchoscopic tissue sampling. The combination of catheter aspiration and forceps biopsy results in a higher diagnostic yield than either method used alone.","inCitations":["174d3b20dbc09e09f6261b6d33342867c3255a9c","e86709a814ebbff3c497342cd1215e50ef9c02c1","505238078deebdcef43c111597b65269ef4751ab","037fd77485494427860b49b4dd9a0fb1b17e8a20","ddab0c441c80fe8a8525d1da78eccbb481197a73","b35b2ea065bf3e894488a61ad4c1b2fe01df65cd"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Forceps biopsy and suction catheter for sampling in pulmonary nodules and infiltrates.","doi":"10.1183/09031936.00024111","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1183/09031936.00024111","venue":"The European respiratory journal"}

Sensor nodes initiate a broadcast in the network, when the measured quantity assumes a value in the range of interest. Specifically, we consider randomly deployed networks of location-agnostic wireless sensor nodes, which broadcast messages by flooding. The node-to-node delays are assumed to be random. In networks of this type, the hop count of a broadcast message, given the distance from the source node, can be approximated by a simple parametric distribution. The mobile platform can interrogate a nearby sensor node to obtain, with a given success probability, the hop counts of the broadcast messages originating from different source nodes. By fusing successive hop count observations, the mobile platform infers the locations of the source nodes and thereby, the spatial distribution of the quantity of interest. The path taken by the mobile platform should minimize the resulting mapping error as quickly as possible. We propose an information-driven path planning approach, in which the mobile platform acts by maximizing a weighted sum of myopic, mutual information gains. We show by simulation, that suitable control of the weights is effective at reducing the error between the true and the inferred map, by preventing the information gain to be dominated by only a few source nodes.","inCitations":["a8c0bac68fb2df95628de9f1eb7af4745ad56d43"],"pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1109/WIVEC.2014.6953270"],"title":"Wireless sensor network-assisted, autonomous mapping with information-theoretic utility","doi":"10.1109/WIVEC.2014.6953270","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WIVEC.2014.6953270","venue":"2014 IEEE 6th International Symposium on Wireless Vehicular Communications (WiVeC 2014)"}

We propose that the presence of N 2 in the plume indicates thermal decomposition of ammonia, and hence high temperatures in the interior of the moon (e.g., 500 to 800 K). Such an environment also appears to be suitable for the production of methane (CH 4 ) from carbon monoxide (CO), or carbon dioxide (CO 2 ). The presence of C 2 H 2 and C 3 H 8 strongly suggest that catalytic reactions took place within a very hot environment. The internal environment of Enceladus is inferred to be or have been favorable for aqueous, catalytic chemistry. This permits the synthesis of many complex organic compounds that could be detected in future Cassini observations.","inCitations":["c83064132e3025cff3e6b3a30836142c5ddadafc","443dbb6d0805d440ada7e0f884082333e02091c7","6151c657f50118dafc81b7c5faebb04b5705c94a","74ef35a2a09a0640662da783eb3df1c4a5126c71","917981b6d3199e4abbfb96faa871f61567f0842c","d698d31bcc50d69d618ee242eeff1cfeaf60f274","ba28827953a1b958fc4d767b2191ee1ed04d9054","197a33e6ccfbe263f66f521103f5765ecfa4bfa6","3a7c7608569d7aaffdca65b3c0f1570dbf2c4e14","06f679316cb7928fa7575f4c6126c77bf5f9602b","687ca08f372bcd19273235bbb294362fd8aabc76","67185977435fa42ba9a9f54a623a654a6e1d8ddb","5afda875ad58da942190b306160f4c3392c9ab75","587dccae20523541939b5791fdce00f1e50535fa","db3069a216c2da6494ec888747c85f00ae18e16a","259ce152923358e55d50d6c084238e6a7ba81b8d","87c482116ab473a47c51231246f6a1eac2ff54c7","f7d99e05231bc7172328696f1d0fcd54414fd329","2d0cbc910f6ac0b4b03efabd489d5bbd4b605873","38c37ace8408defb8b78dcee33fb10b884819303","8b6b6ba63e8b9b4da4d35c664267518fe08c5dfc","83685ac9283897ba405150bc1a42a7d6f44632b9","29cc03dbf3b554c1317693de3be9eea5211b821e","8df03c747631f8ed199a7ebc5c90fa245a74e64e","d54748cd7b7d7027c1abadc1d4d31f7a93c5c1ec","9623b709f2684c5051d50063060a392074eb3fef","7f5f1ec3a339c8e60374193935f607373018f4ad","280ee90c81cab9562d53a0289eb99b24d42e6ab9","0b0d1cc4742df9045d5ad6c069d9ca28ee664f00","5478169f2badcbc6148f5448d7c51a831224b423","e522c85ee47c4e9a4a743e7f01b75c5f50247984","4aabdb2ca3905a04ff2446e9b3a5740648c04488","4640dbd8b18b4b1f1e2b49a5e441b5d65299a6dd","e8d94023d011a259490cd55c301359c58e83fc2c","cf7e9ecc27a02b78f3140d68edcfee160525b6be","88d9b736859fafc9d3a882ceece2c14f1b8b1c38","d5a59447125769a428a8e94703fc409bd48bda86","0f4070ee879de01e6f01cf32efc040e5108a589e","186d6031cda16302286be14ea7f4796dee1ef94f","c8e260e90aec1f46927be9d87722ae73f66a3e22","5de0b0f495c1d663cab968554fdf4d431f7deb3d","bdfde23aee8460333872a472d4d203f939ae885f","9da6fce4bc16ca13225826c664ba2fe63643a7eb","32d6d2f343b0d58ece25e006cbfc9e33b528a730","fe5e718408cbdf88b5c77e75065464b07b675c54","40dc527acddfc819c1580fac7b205c62e6a636ab","1252a84eaa55e67c579328982d25e21478b8ac03","5ade1452403db5defd69bfa32979a037a0073653","753a0e8bb691c5dfc35a37519962358a5aa2996f","8c953130517e382a8192541e53ab8598024042d9","2fe2581233b391a44bbde3fea36d93641b3fc67f"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Enceladus' plume: Compositional evidence for a hot interior","doi":"10.1016/j.icarus.2006.10.016","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.icarus.2006.10.016","venue":""}

As mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) encodes for components of the electron transport chain (ETC) and plays a critical role in ATP synthesis capacity, we determined the effects of cryoprotectants on mtDNA in hard coral (Echinopora spp.) oocytes using quantitative real-time PCR. Our results showed that an insult from a cryoprotectant may be compensated for by the genetic defense mechanisms of these cells. Methanol was found to have the least effect on coral oocytes with regard to their energy status. A single oocyte without cryoprotectant treatment produced an average of 4,220,645 ± 169,990 mtDNA copies, which was greater than that in mammals. However, relatively lower mtDNA copy numbers (<2,000,000) were observed when oocytes were treated with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), propylene glycol (PG), ethylene glycol (EG), or glycerol at a concentration of 3 M for 20 min. These results provide direct evidence that hard coral (Echinopora spp.) oocytes are extremely susceptible to cryoprotectants and support the concerns with regard to the adverse effects of cryoprotectants.","inCitations":["be726fbb7c3714b0cffa09d185f8f704ee31c36e","b9698cb1dc100efb6421e6b6dd1ad595d1a50c06","a8e2aa9e6b5fe5fbf14ba7d570e777cc2366c529"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Degradation of mitochondrial DNA in cryoprotectant-treated hard coral (Echinopora spp.) oocytes.","doi":"10.3109/19401736.2013.855734","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.3109/19401736.2013.855734","venue":"Mitochondrial DNA"}

We reconstructed several environmental variables (i.e. pH, total [Al], and [Ni]) by applying weighted-averaging regression and calibration models to our paleolimnological data. As a result of emissions from the Coniston Smelter, the lake started to acidify from a high pH of about 6.5 in 1940 to a low pH of 4.2 in 1975. During this period, inferred lakewater [Al] and [Ni] also increased dramatically. Following the closure of the smelter in 1972, inferred lakewater pH and metal concentrations recovered close to pre-industrial levels. The inferred pH recovery corresponds closely to the known lakewater pH recovery (a difference of about 0.4 and 0.6 of a pH unit was observed between measured pH, and chrysophyte and diatominferred pH, respectively). Our study demonstrates that algal microfossils can provide high resolution inferences of past environmental trends. This approach holds great potential for documenting a lake's response to decreased loadings of sulphate and metals, and in helping to establish and implement emission standards.","inCitations":["5df295a5d700501136ca051174ca841780a3700c","43edd2fe51cd128b05af918f23d567466afe7c3d","fe20a6d617ef298942ddd0b2832c2c3936af7b80","0d6034b56724343760bf9a1a93f9f750247d0d70","affb16324ac0dc24c93ad2b16b9c60de9bd28e2c","9ab71e565ad43d2f07c24581bcd88fcf1531f05b","42ea85eb348d53a5b0fe6ef46904c58c220c00af","3aecb91fbc9ed9ee09f3f17cbdb59d64655d6a72","8095ef9163ecbb1c675af576674dcabe22057890","b8d4ba8b3abad102ef8e755eeef9e0a962170ef9","a08e93bd8beed0508db5a74d30907e8a98a89103","1d256884c670526519d097fa2ae43034e9379713","ee12c627cc189684df0363efcd73466187681ea4","577870ef69c7ffc34ae2f2611089c37d4157f4ab","676659b43f722834c9706c90731a191ce071ea88","89bfbb0d9d917619b25f13858f464e6a3c1d0c3e","fe935d1329a98c7d4036325b8dbe7e0be9c3909f","850a2dbe4e45f703b2f3bbbd02a938f8442cd336"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Algal microfossils provide high temporal resolution of environmental trends","doi":"10.1007/BF00478454","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/BF00478454","venue":""}

This makes clear that it is the most widely used script in India. Most ancient documents are written in Devanagari script. The script has 16 vowels and 36 consonants. Unlike, English language Devanagari script does not have any upper or lower case characters. Instead, it has a horizontal line at the top called as shirorekha which joins the characters to form a word. Thus, the report gives a brief review about the development of Optical Handwritten Character Recognition for Devanagari script, the techniques & algorithms which are designed for examining & recognizing the Devanagari script. Further the report focuses on the key principles of the system such as text analysis and segmentation, matrix matching and recognition of single and compound characters. To keep up accuracy in recognizing the characters, the system uses some neural network algorithms.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Development of Intelligent Optical Handwritten Character Recognition System for Devanagari Script","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

The aim of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of MR arthrography of the distal radioulnar joint in depiction of peripheral tears of the triangular fibrocartilage.\n\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nForty-one patients (18 women, 23 men; mean age, 38 years; age range, 18-60 years) underwent MR arthrography and wrist arthroscopy. For MR arthrography, iopamidol (300 mg I/mL) and gadopentetate dimeglumine (4 mmol/L) were injected into the distal radioulnar joint. Consensus review of both MR arthrograms and conventional arthrograms was performed by two experienced musculoskeletal radiologists. Presence or absence of communicating and noncommunicating tears of the ulnar attachment of the triangular fibrocartilage was recorded. Arthroscopy was used as the standard of reference for determining sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy in detection of tears of the ulnar attachment.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAt MR arthrography, communicating tear of the ulnar attachment was diagnosed in three patients, noncommunicating tear in 19 patients, and normal attachment in 19 patients. Arthroscopy revealed peripheral tear of the triangular fibrocartilage in all three patients with communicating tear, in 14 of 19 patients with noncommunicating tear, and in three of 19 patients with normal attachment. The sensitivity was 85% (17/20), specificity was 76% (16/21), and accuracy was 80% (33/41).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nMR arthrography of the distal radioulnar joint is accurate in depiction of peripheral tears of the ulnar attachment of the triangular fibrocartilage.

The stable and metastable microscopic geometries of group-II (Be, Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba)–H complexes have been investigated. The calculated results indicate that BC|| is the most stable configuration for isolated interstitial H+ and Be–H complexes, while it is ABN,⊥ for Mg–H, Ca–H, Sr–H and Ba–H complexes. Moreover, the vibrational frequencies and the values of k and |α| for the H atom with LVM are calculated. Here, the values of k and |α| are used to describe the parameters of the harmonic and anharmonic contributions, respectively. The calculated results indicate that the larger the size of the doped ion is, the shorter the N–H bond length is, and the larger the potential energy, the vibrational frequencies, the values of k and |α| are. This implies that the size of the doped ion has an important influence on the vibrational properties of H.","inCitations":["930266e6f8bd81e52ebeb2051fdb52057ba6d8f2"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Stability and vibrational properties of the hydrogen atom for p-type AlN doped with group-II: a first-principles study","doi":"10.1088/1674-4926/31/6/062001","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1088/1674-4926%2F31%2F6%2F062001","venue":""}

(FEVi) <40%, and the ability to tolerate 12 cmH20 of pressure on a non- invasive ventilator performed two maximal exercise tests on a cycle ergometer, with and without ventilatory assistance prior to exercise. Blood samples, respiratory metabolic measures, heart rate and rating of perceived exertion (RPE) were obtained throughout each exercise test. \n \nResults: Peak work rate (W), total exercise time, and respiratory rate were higher (p<0.05) when exercise was preceded by ventilatory support compared to no support. There was no difference in peak oxygen uptake (V02), carbon dioxide (VC02,), heart rate (HR), minute ventilation (VE), tidal volume (VT), blood lactate or RPE between the two experimental conditions. A total of 12 subjects completed at least 5 stages of the exercise protocol, and their physiological response during exercise with NIV and without NIV were compared. RPE was significantly lower during the first 3 min in the NIV condition than the no NIV condition.

There was no difference in RR, VT, HR, %HR, VE, V 0 2and %V02 between the two experimental conditions during sub maximal exercise. \n \nConclusions: Application of non-invasive ventilatory support prior to exercise improves maximal exercise performance, but has no effect on cardio-metabolic response during submaximal exercise in patients with COPD.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://doras.dcu.ie/17202/1/anita_doggett_20120703102203.pdf"],"title":"Effect of inspiratory pressure support on exercise performance in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

In pretreated NSCLC, EGFR TKIs are considered more effective than standard monotherapy with cytotoxics in presence of classical EGFR mutations, whereas in the EGFR wild-type population, a similar efficacy to docetaxel or pemetrexed in term of survival has been demonstrated. In ALK-translocated NSCLC, a Phase III trial demonstrated the superiority of a multi-target TKI, including ALK, in terms of progression-free survival, response rate and toxicity profile when compared to standard second-line chemotherapy. New agents targeting EGFR or ALK are under evaluation particularly in individuals with acquired resistance to EGFR TKIs or crizotinib.","inCitations":["735b3f7c4bc746d844c0c79baaa018799da417a5","b4947a8267270b4d5118d15bb0bb87b5fcb69810","87114648365bd54f950961503e36ba57352cafe6","5395e08afb1b0d55b5117938cb049579db682ef1","ddeb45d3886a698df0019d71f01b9fea2043fc85","1b3c703f9b80daabda72206d6b991fbe832643f0","67e13720fbc9b56d30361263e24a69b8a5f0a2a1","a9c1287a2f64803712c2a2ea0fcf3aa5547a9882","df1e7f1011b4e23af727d541772802f9da00040e","278b840e76fe6b3dbcc17213d59650d4997ccc0c","9d413ac5ff6765d8486911b66986074f11ca9fe7","d13c6d1f6a274b17592ebc124fe611dfc684a5cf"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Protein kinase inhibitors to treat non-small-cell lung cancer.","doi":"10.1517/14656566.2014.909412","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1517/14656566.2014.909412","venue":"Expert opinion on pharmacotherapy"}
