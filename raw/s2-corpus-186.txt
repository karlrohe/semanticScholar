And among allergies, none causes as much concern and controversy as peanut allergies. Air quality issues, including mold and dust, are difficult to control in aging school buildings. Many products that schools routinely use contain latex, and school lunch programs have difficulty avoiding all of the food products that might cause allergic reactions. However, peanuts are potentially more life-threatening than other allergies. Peanuts can induce an anaphylactic reaction, causing difficulty in breathing and swallowing, throat tightness, and hives (Sicherer, Burks, and Sampson 1998). Without swift and proper attention, the person may die (Bock, Munoz-Furlong, and Sampson 2001; Ramesh 2008). In fact, allergies to peanuts and tree nuts are the leading cause of the near-fatal and fatal anaphylactic reactions to food (Sicherer, Munoz-Furlong, and Sampson 2003). Doctors are diagnosing peanut allergies in younger children. The average age of diagnosis is now 14 months, compared to 22 months less than a decade ago. In addition, the number of children with peanut allergies has doubled in the past decade (Green et al. 2007). Although some people may outgrow their allergies to peanuts, the majority of people diagnosed with a peanut allergy will have lifelong sensitivities to peanuts (Lee and Sheffer 2003), and allergy shots have not been developed to minimize the risk (Clark et al. 2009; Leung et al. 2003). Parents of students with peanut allergies want to protect their child from any unnecessary exposure, and some pressure school leaders to make appropriate accommodations in every grade, including demands to make entire school districts peanut-free environments. However, school officials face a backlash from other parents if they implement such a policy, and they also know that becoming completely peanut-free is next to impossible. These facts all point to the urgency for more focused research on the effect of peanut allergies on students and appropriate accommodations and responses from school personnel. We explored the practical, legal, and psychological issues surrounding this gnarly issue in three phases. We reviewed the literature on peanut allergies by medical professionals and education leaders. We interviewed doctors, school superintendents, parents with children who have peanut allergies, and parents whose children don't have this allergy. All participants were selected using purposeful sampling, based on their expertise or experience in this area. Finally, we looked at the legal arguments for various accommodations, particularly within the context of Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. By combining the wisdom of professionals in medicine, education, and law, a clear course of action for schools emerges. MEDICAL GUIDANCE FOR SCHOOLS The consensus among medical professionals is that reactions to airborne exposure are quite rare and that actual contact with the allergen is needed for a reaction (Gottesman 2006). For example, airborne reactions might occur if there were a high concentration of peanut dust particles in the air--as might be the case in places with people cracking open roasted peanuts--or if peanuts were being boiled, which releases vapors into the air. But the severity of the reaction is proportional to the degree of contact (Wood 2007; Young 2003). Ingestion is most likely to cause anaphylactic reaction, whereas contact on the skin \"does not lead usually to a severe, whole-body allergic response\" (Gottesman 2006). But, there's also widespread agreement that this allergy is on the rise and that reactions can be very acute (Burks 2003; Lacketal. 2003; Sicherer and Sampson 2000). According to Dr. Robert Wood (2009), \"Anaphylaxis is a serious allergic reaction that can be caused by exposure to minuscule quantities of nuts or other food allergens and may even cause death. …","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"A Peanuty Dilemma: To Protect Children with Allergies, Schools Are Being Pressured to Become Peanut-Free Zones.

Two patients had no history of trauma or ocular surgery and were considered to have congenital cysts. The other patient had a history of strabismus surgery that had been performed 7 years previously. The anterior wall of the cysts was removed by trephination, and the epithelial membrane lining the posterior wall was peeled off. Lamellar corneal buttons obtained from preserved corneas then were put in place and secured with 8-10 interrupted sutures. In one case, because the cyst was large and extended to the pupillary axis, peripheral LKP was performed for removal of the scleral and peripheral corneal cyst, and the inner wall of the central corneal cyst was removed with vigorous irrigation and a spatula.\n\n\nRESULTS\nHistologic examination showed that all of the cysts were lined with nonkeratinizing epithelial cells. In all three cases, cysts have not reformed after a 1-5-year follow-up.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe cysts were lined in epithelial cells, and removal of these epithelial cells was considered to be important for the prevention of recurrence. Peripheral LKP is effective for the treatment of corneoscleral cysts, since this procedure removes displaced epithelial cells and reconstructs the thin part of the cornea and sclera.","inCitations":["2c2dff46edb045da96167579bb8fea293b503321","41611d6d353a84aef53ada0b6a9be1977a54d18a","baa4d82ca5925d618fd474b6f38ee70a4796e81f","e83ef33f7fb5185f8fdc5c0630788f0ff31e4dfe","8f48b705ec3a6e05783df0ca1276a28544c1ef2e","f7858d221b523eec5ca674ca7480905111a3f944","a616bd5672f2abfa354df5ffed407e74da61160b","ca5eea88111c1a91553d0b5f8b08c093a1dd6324","a6b81e6d36076e54ef3f85af66cbb4f0b0447cc2","c08b4292f919bba04c901d7336a9e1d3490efd09"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Peripheral lamellar keratoplasty for corneoscleral cyst: three case reports.","doi":"10.1097/00003226-199903000-00015","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1097/00003226-199903000-00015","venue":"Cornea"}

An increased steeping time increased malting losses, total beta-amylase activity and Kolbach index. On the contrary total nitrogen, friability and viscosity of consequent congress worts were decreased. A maximum alpha-amylase activity was found in buckwheat malted with an out-of-steep moisture content of 45%. Beta-amylase existed in a soluble and latent form in buckwheat. The latent form was solubilised during malting. In addition extra beta-amylase was produced. In general the optimum out-of-steep moisture content for buckwheat is between 35 to 40%, which is a compromise between attaining the desired malt quality and minimising malting loss.","inCitations":["5afa56f72364201c375c45d15266b85872c0a543","10f415d396a21795b2afc9e1fba20c41fdf00a2b","62d60210be7ee7fbe5e963ec2a95e11b45ddc976","ac6d98eaf07c020eb3cdeaf6a962249af538d5ff","e8d46222a090ef2a6dca3a3302821000f1d748b0","4ad169282b72cc966a2228fdabb900fe4a1682c8","1ddc244cafb9771d12f9d223c88185b3f09d2c25","d3e1e673f920d50a0fc90b3b37a0e616dce5fe2b","8f9d1fa9746d4da0d1f1e0ae878e96134eac221c","f95c2fdd890b11a810ba1e1c28640c65dc76d877","d9c418cc15af63d6d54662508453617c129864dd","eb31b41bbaa05e2044d8867cc9a1c131df35fcfc","01705232f3c51e404e96d8a17a0e48495ed5e28f","3bdee94f41df43611d889bcf3a9cf05834912cf2","fd0ee576c127e3f8d2d7c9c669a5af5db21d2a49","29546e929cc499136e4e55d9d3a9d53da8fe88f3","3779d39db0548b596449e2bf8039bc9610cbd2a6"],"pdfUrls":["https://www.fagopyrum.eu/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/The-Effect-of-Steeping-Time-on-the-Final-Malt-Quality-of-Buckwheat.pdf"],"title":"The Effect of Steeping Time on the Final Malt Quality of Buckwheat","doi":"10.1002/j.2050-0416.2005.tb00683.x","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1002/j.2050-0416.2005.tb00683.x","venue":""}

We show that the shear-wave velocity is actually unnecessary for fitting the slowness-of-polarization dependence of P-wave VSP data. For the most common geometry of a vertical borehole in a vertically transversely isotropic subsurface, such data are governed by the P-wave vertical velocity VP0 and two quantities, δVSP and ηVSP , that describe the influence of anisotropy.

As part of the medical student curriculum, it is usually taught in 2D using illustrations and plastinated brain section, since the number of hours devoted to anatomy have dropped in the curriculum, making the dissection of brain too time-consuming to be done. In this study we are analyzing the role of innate spatial ability of novices in learning some basic structures and placing them back in a 3D volumetric brain. Two tasks are performed after a short training session: the first one is to localize the ventricular tip as would be required during a temporal lobectomy, and the second task requires that the subject 'reconstruct' 3D anatomical structures within the context of our 3D brain model. We report our findings on the performance scores obtained from a population of subjects of differing backgrounds and spatial abilities.","inCitations":["cb110dfedc68525f72ec7e539d4a642fcbdf26fa","89b0754c0303e058a352a78b7f18e0feb1387c99"],"pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.3233/978-1-61499-209-7-324"],"title":"Spatial Ability and Training in Virtual Neuroanatomy","doi":"10.3233/978-1-61499-209-7-324","sources":["Medline","DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.3233/978-1-61499-209-7-324","venue":"MMVR"}

In the other article, I tried to show that East Asia is required to cope with the double situations of inheriting the Western imperial desire towards East Asia and even its self-reflection on the one hand, and establishing the East Asian inherent tradition and history on the other. It is in this respect that we need to de-construct the East Asian origin and re-construct its new identity; here a new discourse of East Asia needs to be imagined not in the dimension of the dichotomy of Western empire and Eastern colony but in the critical analysis of the internal and external competitive aspects that the East Asian countries encountered in the process of constructing the modern nation-states. The aim of this work was to imagine the East Asian community, ultimately linked to seek the way towards the global co-existence by escaping from the trap of exclusive community that has been promoted by the West, and then by the nation-state-centered hegemony inside East Asia in the complicity relationship with the West. The imagination of a literature that East Asia's nation-states hold in common is expected to contribute to that work insofar as East Asian literature allows itself to be directed towards the so-called universal literary-value. The practice of interpretation as a resistance against all kinds of homogeneity is the core instruction for this new figure of East Asian literature; indeed 'literature' itself implies this kind of resistance. The reason why I discuss resistance is derived from the observation that we need to change the current situation of East Asia governed by the order of power to the future's possible world achieved by the order of culture. I think that the comparative literature will be able to contribute to this enterprise. Here the comparative literature is no more the 'particular' one born in the West and generated centered on it but rather should be the new one that asks where the general literary value is and what it is; in other word, the East Asian literature may become an engine for re-identifying the true 'literature'. If the East Asian literature is possible, it is through the task of comparative literature that we should suggest newly; conversely, the task of comparative literature will be able to be describe on the possibility of the East Asian Literature. If we may say that literature is the form of life and the way of practicing it, and the community of literature is a procedure sustained by them, the East Asian literature may base itself as an appropriate reason for imagining the East Asian community. This is because 'literature' questions incessantly about the identity of a community, and further the East Asian literature can be maintained by virtue of the authenticity of literature. The incessant questioning itself makes the identity of a community flexible and open to the Others so as to allow it to build up its own position. This work can be realized by de-constructing the binary opposition relationship between universality and particularity and re-constructing their relationship of mutual exchange. I strived to criticize the nationalism, including cultural nationalism, as a representation of exclusive power that disturbs the realization of that re-construction and to suggest the possibility of interpretation-practice as a strategy of resistance against homogeneity. More precisely, the objects of discussion in this paper are: 1) the situations of the study of comparative literature in the East Asian nations such as China, Japan and Korea, 2) the new interpretation of Choi Junghee's Yakukcho as an example of resistance against the homogeneous structure, 3) the problem of unification of the written and spoken language, 4) the problem of cultural nationalism and cultural relativism. The ultimate aim is to pursue the East Asian literature as an example of realization of the true universal literary value emerged from the conjunction of the universal and the particular.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"동아시아 문학은 어떻게 가능한가","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

There is a need to screen varieties of medicinal plants to identify more sources of antiangiogenic compounds, as anticancer drugs with less side effects. This study was designed to explore the antiangiogenic property and cytotoxicity of Moricandia sinaica (Boiss.) in zebrafish embryos, as well as its anti-migratory potential in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrophotometry was performed in order to identify bioactive molecules present in the stem and leaves part of Moricandia sinaica.

In this work, we report for the first time that sulfated chitosan can promote the neural differentiation of ESCs. As a type of sulfated glycosaminoglycan analog, sulfated chitosan with well-defined sulfation sites and a controlled degree of sulfation (DS) were prepared through simple procedures and the influence of sulfated glycosaminoglycan on neural differentiation of ESCs was investigated. Compared with other sulfation sites, 6-O-sulfated chitosan showed the most optimal effects. By monitoring the expression level of neural differentiation markers using immunofluorescence staining and PCR, it was found that neural differentiation was better enhanced by increasing the DS of 6-O-sulfated chitosan. However, increasing the DS by introducing another sulfation site in addition to the 6-O site to chitosan did not promote neural differentiation as much as 6-O-sulfated chitosan, indicating that compared with DS, the sulfation site is more important. Additionally, the optimal concentration and incubation time of 6-O-sulfated chitosan were investigated. Together, our results indicate that the sulfate site and the molecular structure in a sulfated polysaccharide are very important for inducing the differentiation of ESCs. Our findings may help to highlight the role of sulfated polysaccharide in inducing the neural differentiation of ESCs.","inCitations":["705f45742f7351f981ab91ae29ac8e1ffe21935b","eeb20ddf9ec24765627a91a1a4ddbbac7e5a9187","ccf381f97d7e5dafdb8bcb0a0b1436ceeed4079a","ab94bcf9016b24aadc8705652d6d19fa76358046","13da0e5731ecc6da0dac9022b4152db8784b8f6e","d5d4d7b45ed5658a7172d6601684e6f5cb156bc7","ffbc7468e840f059dd8bbd6efb0639a63df8a8b6","eabceead61bba260b0a611748adc2c8d8aa17eef","5edcb535141b8742d801a5e0aecc51387a5f47cb"],"pdfUrls":["http://or.nsfc.gov.cn/bitstream/00001903-5/197678/1/1000009040787.pdf"],"title":"6-O-sulfated chitosan promoting the neural differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells.","doi":"10.1021/am505628g","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1021/am505628g","venue":"ACS applied materials & interfaces"}

We assessed rates of insurance clearance for trial participation within our large early-phase clinical trials program, before and after implementation of the requirement.Experimental Design: We analyzed the departmental database for the Clinical Center for Targeted Therapy (CCTT) at MD Anderson Cancer Center (Houston, TX). Among patients referred for sponsored trials, we described rates of insurance clearance and prolonged time to clearance (at least 14 days) from July 2012 to June 2013 (baseline), July 2013-December 2013 (following CCTT staffing changes in July 2103), and January 2014-June 2015 (following implementation of the ACA). We used multivariable logistic regression models to compare rates across these time periods.Results: We identified 2,404 referrals for insurance clearance. Among privately insured patients, insurance clearance rates were higher for those referred from January 2014 to June 2015 than for those referred from July 2012 to June 2013 (OR, 4.72; 95% CI, 2.96-7.51). There was no association between referral period and clearance rates for Medicare/Medicaid patients (P = 0.25). Referral from January 2014 to June 2015 was associated with lower rates of prolonged clearance among both privately insured (OR 0.57; 95% CI, 0.38-0.86) and Medicare/Medicaid patients (OR 0.39; 95% CI, 0.19-0.83).Conclusion: Within our large early-phase clinical trials program, insurance clearance rates among privately insured patients improved following implementation of the ACA's requirement for coverage of standard-of-care costs.

Una de las peliculas en las que Charles Chaplin hace uso de elementos de iconografia musical es Sunnyside, obra en la que el concepto de lo absurdo, ampliamente explotado por el cineasta, se descubre a traves de las situaciones que se desarrollan en torno a la musica y el ejercicio musical. El presente trabajo, con base en el analisis iconografico de la imagen de la musica que integra la pelicula objeto de estudio, pretendera establecer los significados que se le otorgan y la importancia que esta adquiere en la definicion de la situacion emocional o social de un determinado personaje o del propio rumbo del desarrollo dramatico.

It is difficult to treat and is usually associated with an inexorable, rapidly fatal clinical course. Chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and surgical excision are core components in the management of malignant glioma. However, chemotherapy, even with the most active regimens currently available, achieves only modest improvement in overall survival. Novel agents and new approaches to therapy are required to improve clinical outcomes. Irinotecan, a first-line treatment for metastatic colorectal cancer and an agent with high activity against solid tumors of the gastrointestinal tract, is an inhibitor of topoisomerase I, a critical enzyme needed for DNA transcription. Irinotecan crosses the blood-brain barrier and, in preclinical investigations, has demonstrated cytotoxic activity against central nervous system tumor xenografts. Its antitumor activity has also been demonstrated against glioblastoma cells with multidrug resistance. Studies in adult and pediatric patients with recurrent, intractable malignant glioma have evaluated irinotecan as monotherapy and in combination with other agents, including temozolomide, carmustine, thalidomide, and bevacizumab. Studies of irinotecan in combination with other medications, particularly temozolomide and bevacizumab, have yielded promising results. Irinotecan monotherapy has demonstrated efficacy; however, its efficacy appears to be enhanced when used in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents. When administered concurrently with enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs, the dosage must be increased to compensate for enhanced cytochrome CY3A4/5 enzyme activity. Toxicities associated with irinotecan have been manageable; the most important dose-limiting toxicities are neutropenia and diarrhea. Irinotecan-based chemotherapy of malignant glioma merits further study.","inCitations":["6415a29c07c1860c475fd2f3d2479111a7192a1c","7b4d305d51dee034df3543a8be84b0745f8707fe","7b85feeef00a03fc70bc9c35113388b668cb9805","c2b21652b61ebad9e45d58c47d198fe3a9d4a76a","fdf8d818e061a10452a4946ac1548094f68b6a5e","15c56169d89d667c64570131f493eebc5295b094","a0e4af9d037688006adc1a5deece95130bd86b0c","def5bfaaa0fd0ede1b90149946fa664bf1173723","70db7f77c0a142b613763749332e4217aab163b4","c82ae5cf5a2482be328a44facb3c297ebeda0aa0","0bbf4a97b5497c5b0bcd6b82fc28ac6be68ed49b","f3098dab16b660fefdac5aaf53a78b198a70b941","c8285d90244f1bb6f03caaaed9ba26f2b35a2b35","d448f81d2d1bb6fce95c17f4cc44a8b8040930b8","f399e6d9c340c017ce9fbc579b33997aed29a4e5","18f979a50dd733f6c3f245952f487e5598016f3a","f5257961f5a1b0ba591393b77b2059f3689695ec","b9052fdda3701ada1cbea94a86d7e74bb89064e4","610407255f9a55a745666fe513d4298293122609","4fea4078c5f5d9e867a2e6a8b5aca9482fbae1fc","563593fd30cf065f0a5acd64b819ff6c8e24480f","7ea11a73f10852b784eae16d98f607276e7c5621","d0b306dcc360638cb8a682cff58208f323cfccc0","d0df5ec0653afaa7777fb464cd9a10c71f37743b","8bbf8f04079bb94fd9748d304befbed413556864","ff849970ecee1221361f7336b45107ae322eb5ec","d1cddf19a5ffa4c5476ffa82a12db8ab886e6272","1fea9d1989c0305267fbb42a6db57e34953ff01a","66f8683942d64ae40280c5e87199967cef4b8aeb","963ab810d167799dcc3eb7f2c5b00969a6ba6aa4","2ab563acbde0f7089e4c2f8e980e1415d699b369","19b849603736b81b63cad04e055097f6720f40e6","13e72794c41a0220022660f1360823d4e1835fe5","7b7d7abc88abda33280e25db5c31d6e3df51630f","381593b6dce90721c26d13dfef96f522504ba702","4d835db7b68a53b9a68b42f3be5990d10582c23d","891ea448b10b6f9c701bc4195bc18acea10b3085","96de03a5a1e33278262d69aa9fa4608759e9d887","2f7e21a75ef0e64589d9796ca4bf8ce530509632","329cced9e9a6b71542f45793a9972a3cf3460b9c","7abea2d73f2b4da76c0c88f307d216768cb051fd","dd848005784d122f4ce731dbaee85bf7ccad3b9f","da7c173487f6bac5e75e8f33317baf5d7109f583","5a919b281903e004ad5688d63fc96f9163f19bfc","4c5a67f8d02e38dd4f59256c6f65a1b63c9f42b5","54fb5a98e45e73b43f940f7370226665edb6031d","150d68a8631a0ac5755cabe50e2575a9e7a1c535","10e1059cb23a71f4ce16117d9f30137b90024981","66b8caf22286a24570e8e184be123eb4641cbb8c","02b8f6bc6abec186d2383ef2b593b999ff469498","4cd6d195b2ddfce721536c6874e7b42a72eec02a","97b81c56cdacc0db330d72c38ddd9b4770889fab","8bd8ba3cc0d8a808d4ff8ed6d60aa215fb6b75d5","e2df78ef6bd279ff060bd88c2392aa3314318440","851e2d43e308d6c4947c6f29e167421d28baca90","d26bd2277541ceed497710d268fdb6f618bfc3a1","cb1028dd1351061faaae28cbd9a5dba853a1c243","db31e692496ed928e0e0c58afd285d905e62dc3d","c7ec920aa1cfbe604fcc7077589a589b58b862c4","60f5e7f03d9c2ce006f65c0db83c8f8647a84ae1","d69ef02822acfd6bd65e7de378fd41bbef12c51e","1aef0280ee3db508e9d0d82993fb5cdf2d90ae94","cc77215e7923a92856fa71642a92dd1b8d4312ae","6fd7c056812658923ce6b56ee9a8fd60e45affe7","3563c43b1778d63694f95c8d948e6b36b442fa16","9e3039b0b8cd76c5ea2e24f20a35a4b17a71849f","3aa6b0879e566b4b43e6b32fb65a7c569e88f57e","494d35b77ca933fccf14baf997adb9a83f2312ca","c2fa9b50ab38ea047ac8624f812cedc5360a691b","fe2a51178e52180fcfbc8d124bbdfebc9a0a85c1","3bb191dca3d6569fb5b53117360079e2c9779925","9a6b3c72a8c74a80e76c1415758ca8899301893d","e530dd0e28d882f427c79017a5815a9e7397b047","ede719a1287a5858abc54dde490e499dddbbd127","c133a6e42b9c5d9a8ae4c907360ab233f814d717","433ccdb18533aeac00e0ab79713fd3633bf2df72","2d0b79c496335303c2ff01e4130e022c03ade64d","a11e393bd81d43f2e87d701d9170412f6a41cc69","5cd1ea91584120a3a336ec14f655fbb11b363a3c","34563ff055daf957a3b7bc5b2a7b570f9b9bdc92","e7e2f494d398ea47c9a643a769440afeac3a9bfd","6ad66651560da752b2ff42ece661483f67106f77","40ed1e9269db2c8aab114e4dfa71d6d091a19568","ee6fbb20cde3187dff3ec077534569f9acccbd67","c22a5af44e0c5696e8e42e456d6c1f503fc2517c","cf5aa8d6c2ddb278053ca20fe7af8f53f81e54ee","b8e6b4fe6bff99dfd2fc08497e7836a58b1e9d97","637460bcb72c894396838fd6f5501ae786e31eaf","8cf6d53662a0ebf2a99a7c68d3745940a100cbe3","431c30411151a0e16c6dbd3173a82fced58ebdc0"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.brainlife.org/abstract/2008/vredenburgh_jj080910.pdf"],"title":"Experience with irinotecan for the treatment of malignant glioma.","doi":"10.1215/15228517-2008-075","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1215/15228517-2008-075","venue":"Neuro-oncology"}

Recently, we isolated a human recombinant multilineage CSF (hMulti-CSF). We investigated the ability of hMulti-CSF to stimulate AML clonogenic cells in seven patients in direct comparison with the effects of human granulocyte CSF (hG-CSF), human granulocyte- macrophage CSF (hGM-CSF), and feeder leukocytes. We show that hMulti- CSF is an efficient stimulator of AML colony formation in four of seven cases. In these patients, hGM-CSF was also capable of stimulating AML colonies in vitro. In two of seven cases hMulti-CSF appeared to be a weak stimulus of AML-CFU proliferation. In these latter two cases, however, hG-CSF and in one case hGM-CSF effectively stimulated AML-CFU growth. In one patient none of the hCSFs, either alone or in combination, induced AML colony formation, whereas AML colonies consistently appeared in the phytohemagglutinin (PHA) leukocyte feeder assay. This finding suggests that PHA stimulated leukocytes produce components other than the tested hCSFs that may have a role in the proliferation of AML cells in vitro. Multi-CSF, like hGM-CSF, revealed a limited capacity to induce progressive maturation during AML colony growth, ie, not beyond the promyelocytic stage. On the other hand, in one case, hG-CSF stimulated the growth of AML colonies containing (meta)myelocytes and granulocytes. We conclude that hMulti-CSF is a regulator of AML-CFU proliferation in a significant number of cases. The patterns of responsiveness of AML precursors to the three hCSFs in different patients show a striking variability, which may indicate that AML-CFU are the neoplastic representatives of normal bone marrow progenitors at different stages of maturation and with distinct CSF requirements.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Human recombinant multilineage colony stimulating factor (interleukin-3): stimulator of acute myelocytic leukemia progenitor cells in vitro.","doi":"10.1182/blood.v70.1.333.bloodjournal701333","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1182/blood.v70.1.333.bloodjournal701333","venue":""}

They are a family of heterotrimeric molecules created through association of an α, β and γ chain. We previously reported that two zebrafish loci, grumpy (gup) and sleepy (sly), encode laminin β1 and γ1, which are important both for notochord differentiation and for proper intersegmental blood vessel (ISV) formation. In this study we show that bashful (bal) encodes laminin α1 (lama1). Although the strongest allele, balm190, is fully penetrant, when compared to gup or sly mutant embryos, bal mutants are not as severely affected, as only anterior notochord fails to differentiate and ISVs are unaffected. This suggests that other α chains, and hence other isoforms, act redundantly to laminin 1 in posterior notochord and ISV development. We identified cDNA sequences for lama2, lama4 and lama5 and disrupted the expression of each alone or in mutant embryos also lacking laminin α1. When expression of laminin α4 and laminin α1 are simultaneously disrupted, notochord differentiation and ISVs are as severely affected as sly or gup mutants. Moreover, live imaging of transgenic embryos expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein in forming ISVs reveals that the vascular defects in these embryos are due to an inability of ISV sprouts to migrate correctly along the intersegmental, normally laminin-rich regions.","inCitations":["d3d79daf30369b8a1851b6b6fdcf60e6ef09eba6","2ff6dfb16b03ee712219fe4541842de33fc3e331","487a52938287e9e0b011b50b7f68023f31b6da5b"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Essential and overlapping roles for laminin α chains in notochord and blood vessel formation","doi":"10.1016/j.ydbio.2005.10.006","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ydbio.2005.10.006","venue":""}

The paper adds to knowledge by providing a cross-disciplinary study of how African firms undertake technological learning and capability-building. The conceptual framework used in the paper, the TCB system approach, suggests that the underdevelopment of the strategic and systematic management of technological learning capability development is a major constraint for developing country firms and cannot be explained by country-level factors only. It therefore suggests that a simultaneous focus on internal factors that contribute to effectiveness, and on boundary conditions, is necessary. This paper focuses on the internal, intrafirm dimension and provides insights on how features such as ability to manage cultural change, leadership and organisational integration influence and explain variation in the ability of telecom firms to build capabilities.

These \nstudents tend to behave poorly and frequently disengage from learning tasks, and thus \none of the greatest challenges for teachers is to keep them focused and active. The \n‘academic learning time in physical education’ is very low, about 14.4%. \nPurpose: This case study investigates the relations between the students’ motor and \nsocial involvement and the class management strategies of four experienced physical \neducation (PE) teachers in a difficult educational context. \nParticipants and Setting: This case study focuses on four secondary school classes with \nthe same characteristics: all are part of theE´ CLAIR program, are taught by experienced \nPE teacher, with hardly manageable underachieving students in drop-out situations (16 \nin total, between 12 and 16 years old), and offer four units of gymnastics (for a total of \n26 lessons). The classes were organized as group activities, with instruction sheets, with \nan educational project based on the students’ sense of autonomy and responsibility. \nResearch Design: This research was conducted following a situated approach from the \ncognitive anthropology framework of ‘course of action’. \nData collection: Extrinsic classroom data were collected by observing the students’ and \nteacher’s activities within the classroom and using audiovisual recordings. Intrinsic data \nwere collected during self-confrontation interviews held after the lessons. \nData Analysis: The data were processed in three stages: (a) the structure of students’ and \nteachers’ behaviors; (b) the dynamic of students’ and teachers’ experience, and (c) the \nclassroom management strategies related to student misbehavior. \nFindings: The findings reveal that in spite of permanent classroom agitation, working \ninvolvement predominated with only short periods of student disengagement. \nCompromises organize the relation between students’ involvement and teacher \nmanagement strategies. There is a compromise between work and play time for the \nstudents – they mainly remained involved in their work, and were appropriately \ninvolved in their task both physically and socially. Then, there is a compromise of \nacceptance for the teachers, as they use specific management strategies based on \ncontrolled short drop-outs as a source of student involvement in work. \nConclusions: These findings raise the question of how PE teachers working under the \ncompensatory policy can best manage student misbehavior. The teacher’s acceptance, \ncompromises within the classroom, zone of acceptable responses, and articulation of \ninstruction activity with misbehavior management, are as many factors improving \nteachers’ professionalization.","inCitations":["7bf175dc5b5673ce34aad0147914e7c1cf8951b5","dab006ee950f00db9ec950c1ae283b319edf46d5","15b0e615531bc10cb14c2d4a6bd51c66c23b2658","2321cc616f9937b1b4c9865357505cab6f9ad5b9","b7e444dc80026d7b88822333359b6a56b51aef47","518d18a8a12ad0769eb9f75b5b05ef583b4a9fd9"],"pdfUrls":["https://apprendreeneps.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/2015_vors_gal_pesp.pdf"],"title":"Relation between students' involvement and teacher management strategies in French ‘difficult' classrooms","doi":"10.1080/17408989.2014.882889","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1080/17408989.2014.882889","venue":""}

A better understanding of this phenomenon would allow an improvement of road safety. This study comprises a review of laboratory test and a model simulating the polishing of road surfaces. The laboratory test uses a polishing machine so called 'Wehner–Schulze' which can reproduce the evolution of the road texture from specimens taken directly from road or made in laboratory. The model is based on contact mechanics considerations and considers that the local polishing rate is controlled by the pressure distribution between the car tyre and the road surface. The model evaluates the pressure distribution by taking into account the surface roughness, the applied load and the mechanical properties of the bodies in contact. From the pressure distribution and a proposed wear law, the local roughness evolution of the surface pavement can be readily evaluate...","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Tribological approach to study polishing of road surface under traffic","doi":"10.1179/175158408X293746","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1179/175158408X293746","venue":""}

Many diagnostic laboratories are adopting next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology to increase their screening capacity and reduce processing time and unit costs. However, migration to NGS introduces complexities arising from choice of components of the BRCA testing workflow, such as NGS platform, enrichment method and bioinformatics analysis process. An efficient, cost-effective accurate mutation detection strategy and a standardised, systematic approach to the reporting of BRCA test results is imperative for diagnostic laboratories. This review covers the challenges of BRCA testing from the perspective of a diagnostics laboratory.","inCitations":["52d94a96c06301a0767f619b9c818873b31ffeb2","479dadde0f71548f0d2a6c56f0486445f01fa606","9d2d6135753013f5eadee8777e0f4acddabc7917","1e0082c4d3bc6223b3e4a01fa440700194a9fdb7","931549813e013ee10681b9bf6cfcb9ee7ae1708e","36dea4803bd77e7b3a29a421a41f70c95db4bdde","df5e6a4dd2e0390169695a63b92febcbb0cfe308","4fe57aa22d99419a23b0c8f556107598d4a3956a","73407bcb9dcf272022bcf2865705971906d18ec3","b2cf00f511f9f1269668a46a837d229e5d1c114e","ffe427150ad7da391ef0fda229b95d685f6d84ca","4984e6addc81e9fb6cf7a1a14bca3fa321ea5fe3","180e23ce51d454af444d77a7f024681a6d6dc4d8","8d9e35c253c1e5de16212e7d3954ade4a0abf336","7c42d6b1d99dac15e29be7261fc9521a670581aa","45935c67a00eafd336839dde9d2d632d581ce8be","e33488e73f36682cb64e3148bad371e2aea23f47","43d5af1f42adfa14666162434b6e38cca3f0587b","561796d2ac203b42cba38e7b5e498cd1d82176c9","340585a2be5d3887868f2c8a7a4f57404f941a7a","662858e047d1563fa5444cf5d316a63d4c498d68","3471e14d860dcc4fb047c7a2410b38f10f08ac76","1842101673e9db3bd14e52b9301c24dacd50c991","0b688d3a680362d60d9fcf14e4ebc258618f2a12","ad119e069164a5890081073c1e93fde4ec74c0f8","3297890f17baddddd4d159530355e7ef7191191a","b94b5678d0565779e9df3fdfd3473e7e09f30302","8ea724965d9d65ebd64b8be2e61cd8efcf64ec76"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.multiplicom.com/sites/default/files/ejhg_newchallengesforbrcatesting.pdf"],"title":"New challenges for BRCA testing: a view from the diagnostic laboratory","doi":"10.1038/ejhg.2016.94","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1038/ejhg.2016.94","venue":"European Journal of Human Genetics"}

The experimental setup is composed of a glass cell placed on a lab-jack and a needle connected to a micro-syringe which controls the volume of the droplet. We acquired videos over the dynamics of the phenomenon with a fast CMOS camera attached to an objective with a microscopic magnification. Depending on the fluids properties (in our case water, respectively solutions of glycerin in water) and the distance between the needle and the fluid surface, the coalescence phenomenon evolves in different manners. The study emphasizes the effect of viscosity over the dynamics of the droplet and on the evolution of the capillary bridge between the needle and the free surface.","inCitations":["004192bc8adec65d5cdd0bf260c08b39845d1ff3"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Coalescence of liquid drops with free surfaces","doi":"10.1109/ATEE.2015.7133872","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ATEE.2015.7133872","venue":"2015 9th International Symposium on Advanced Topics in Electrical Engineering (ATEE)"}

ACM Program. Lang.","paperAbstract":"Callbacks are essential in many programming environments, but drastically complicate program understanding and reasoning because they allow to mutate object's local states by external objects in unexpected fashions, thus breaking modularity. The famous DAO bug in the cryptocurrency framework Ethereum, employed callbacks to steal $150M. We define the notion of Effectively Callback Free (ECF) objects in order to allow callbacks without preventing modular reasoning. \n An object is ECF in a given execution trace if there exists an equivalent execution trace without callbacks to this object. An object is ECF if it is ECF in every possible execution trace. We study the decidability of dynamically checking ECF in a given execution trace and statically checking if an object is ECF. We also show that dynamically checking ECF in Ethereum is feasible and can be done online. By running the history of all execution traces in Ethereum, we were able to verify that virtually all existing contract executions, excluding these of the DAO or of contracts with similar known vulnerabilities, are ECF. Finally, we show that ECF, whether it is verified dynamically or statically, enables modular reasoning about objects with encapsulated state.","inCitations":["1c3ce2e546f2e53e886844d9dc415857ce84cd1e","dd570c1c253093484fb6a408dc942e548bd551a5","a937d4140c289faf03eb5a4046e24351c81b9670","988f0d3dec21f0f17447e58eb5e83a5890297cf3","12c37ed1451eb3279bac8cf83c7adaf7a1032b43","fe140b3f24c28899d3358973576cae5b7966b35b","b4b7d5837f73399a91a1c8fd55a26a84fe570931","272850f06a2aa8c0831f68cf832412852aab5dc8","eefc18a175645bbbaf6f016ca79ba3ed118d6775","729e2ee148f8413eeeb60f0ece4b1a1a9725e538","ac915f4ad1cb8b0b536592f455a38cb58ee884dc","0d33257fd1481a92380396c7882ccac87c294e78","9c94f3cb7878fc53d9734fe398868d45669f9471","4157cefb6d687b01a752da33fec9f8979f51388d","4477f051a457c1d4bd482dcc2311a61e3489ae8f","5eda007a9fc4d6184922f1d730177036a9b48b6f","5dd5ba3ccb6f8af66166814355c5268836088faf","b136a45f37c3744bbdffc742e34ce3ce01888157","93333ca590b8bf98c2947b62c3f6c4eed3c18ed1","469966b4e4fd81a1b9162961ea1d9d6ae30d9827","416c37be6bf29df56122550d209248a29caf8aa1","16faf56efdda91fa07e6f532a34d36ecba25acd6","194ce8423950b777b23ebe791fea99a62099c627","4adeb4a80aaa7e23c316f9c6bc15a92368819b33","5547b58b35fa496025a873f0638a02635def388e","d10384f967089f1a68e81e6d4be40d7dafa715b6","ada9c609f33cd00a43826a63cfb7c0d4a7497230","976f20edf92c60e65c32562b3f546cd5ef1df657","faac612534848f93a8b0766f2dd85c40f11d05d1","9fb3c23d6a9757c13b625d8384c01439f94a1496","7601fca28df4b30fe03bb0eb19014d3ad7ce74bf","bbf9fc120b2b29f25dbf4565fb8055d97d83001d","536b13e052676fa9c8f235af1f2956ac79cddc9e","6a50880c0aadb70a3fa2dc03577b100fa510f5a7","b83325b2447489ad252bfb9803e49f0a579113cf","9d95e18f0a2ce72ce8f17888ba26f2d906af38c6","85e0063f0c988703fdb0163b6665c4b3e45cdb3e","366ef0fdaa62540392e3d013fc0dc85d22bb0f9b","9af9e73cfa4a091e8c33acad0b2634f236e75130","8e8cc2d59c8ce7b1f63c0801c945670f9555bdb8","8266b9a3a1865ae7896d9e1ab528ecc7e745551d","09a8c3fd2df61decf527a6af4c8edafddecff024","f456ac5ad1fbe9cd0116bc2ae69849f06826cbad","fa6f3532f2d7e10ab297e12c9cd4d1c4bdbbf2f6","68c89823f6027795738edde03960bfd2a4b07e9d","c7854fc78a73cbdabf7b9593ca8ca5ad7976723f","e4e879a83eb33492f317f0b2782862831e4a9ad7","7b5abcc4f10da32cb26040a82e90a0c186d930ca","9c420931f82b913cf4cfa6d750785395ff0464c9","bdef2c6323ba6e02ac8ff265d3652bc5027b3d97","be28d28b546e5f0904cd1a56485511b706363587","b1104178ef15326c085d769322255b018fe032ff","ab8b8cfc9ebe2012858d24c8a441617ccdaffbd1","25d9e16a16582ce46607e6b646015a82d1188a74","6e05f77d50bd5776023cc05e1e9bfc5abec00eeb","a91238dc8b64684e5f3a7464b2882b992803ad1d","127c3b9cf151bbab30439e2d95c360b09a6c8c73"],"pdfUrls":["https://webcourse.cs.technion.ac.il/234291/Winter2018-2019/ho/WCFiles/Grossman.Shelly-popl18-paper.pdf","https://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1801.04032","https://doi.org/10.1145/3158136","https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.04032v1.pdf","http://www.cs.tau.ac.il/research/yoni.zohar/popl18.pdf","http://www.cs.tau.ac.il/~maon/pubs/2018-popl.pdf","https://allquantor.at/blockchainbib/pdf/grossman2018online.pdf","http://arxiv.org/abs/1801.04032","https://www.cs.tau.ac.il/~shellygr/pubs/ecf-tr.pdf","http://www.cs.tau.ac.il/~shellygr/pubs/2018-popl.pdf"],"title":"Online detection of effectively callback free objects with applications to smart contracts","doi":"10.1145/3158136","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1145/3158136","venue":"PACMPL"}

We have argued that economists have erred in viewing the situations these methods posit as necessarily fictional; that the data generated by the methods may, for non-marketed goods and the activities with which they are associated, accord more closely with the conditions of received economic theory; that the methods can make it easier to remove the difficulties of estimation and interpretation introduced by confounding variables; and that they often permit one to deal more readily with phenomena that have not been in the range of historical experience. Nevertheless, whatever the advantages, a major disadvantage remains. Until detailed analytical knowledge is acquired of the manner in which expectations are formed, there exists no way to refute empirical propositions established from contingent markets. Nevertheless, the previously mentioned South Coast Air Basin experiment, where the bids obtained for clean air conformed fairly closely to the values implied in a residential property value study, suggest that contingent valuations have a basis in the real decision processes of consumers.","inCitations":["70b159acc6aab12e40fee62c0118c12c9ff6a021","d8bed53957ac7aa9ddd80495577f9cb68bf418d6","4e9b6b9a490d6ff53123cbcc82012181b9806bab","6b996791ffc259b065ab37d95d73bf24ca42271a","302da8ed210b28a427b0bbb3f478a00ee5c4b66e","fc4b928bf6583f82dce15cd9a44bf1054da1e136","dd63d2a6059b463122969668759201fc7e294c7d","21afe914505465913133c43de86abb4aa115d3ae","faaf60c02cf2a52796c74eccf68ccc809c189d99","551304776eafa4e745ef1ef770e7cd4265a583f8","624b7a52c12bda171f028a582dfebb3e05f5a4dd","d8de1b2588f077804429ff72e6a9ce71ea1b3069","211fd572e97ff13ada2e5e54d1b5828476e85e73","98bde4e50d5b9b5afded6e40b66b5e4a585d0e73","d0a4dd0751d2fdb61d2527bc87fa456693a3dcd3","c80abe114c881d2bcd8bd9e96de187ae5190ab6b","13b8d5713ad1447428661a04dafd8bdf2cc4382f","1bf8ef02d1afa26960d96dcba0fc9c6774d5825a","22b21647537a1c0a0c6b26c072e0db10f4bbcf8d","0ccc975c43fc5177a0a97624738a1dba65db0721"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"The advantages of contingent valuation methods for benefit-cost analysis","doi":"10.1007/BF00123782","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/BF00123782","venue":""}

VisiLaw markings visually separate sentences and clauses within sentences, making it easy to see where each begins and ends. The ability to see sentence structure at a glance makes it possible to read clauses one at a time, without losing orientation in the overall structure. Within each constituent clause, underlining identifies a skeletal sentence. That sentence includes the subject, verb, direct object and a few other words. The underlining enables the reader to quickly get the gist, and understand the structure, of the constituent clauses.

There were 16 males and 32 females, with an average age at the time of surgery of 17.1 years. Lenke Type I was found in 17 cases, Type II in 9, Type III in 14 and Type IV in 8. There were 27 patients used selective posterior fusion in thoracic, 21 cases without selective fusion. Observation index: the Cobb angle on coronal plane, translation and rotation of apical vertebrae, the coronal balance, the Cobb angle on sagittal plane, obliquity between lowest instrumented vertebrae (LIV) and the pelvis, intervertebral angle and rotation of the LIV. The patients were followed up at an average time of 15.1 months (12-27 months).\n\n\nRESULTS\nIn the 27 cases with selective fusion, thoracic coronal Cobb angle was (17 + or - 8) degrees after the operation, with an average correction rate of (76 + or - 11)% at final follow up. The lumbar Cobb angle was (13 + or - 7) degrees after the operation, with an average correction rate of (72 + or - 9)% at final follow up. In the 21 cases without selective fusion, the thoracic Cobb angle was (20 + or - 7) degrees after the operation, with an average correction rate of (74 + or - 15)% at final follow up. The lumbar Cobb angle was (16 + or - 8) degrees after the operation, with an average correction rate of (69 + or - 9)% at final follow up. The average number of vertebrae retained below LIV was 4.4. There was 1 case developing thoracolumbar kyphosis. During the follow up, there were no major complication of neurological injury, no pseudarthrosis and no spine decompensation.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nPosterior bilateral segmental pedicle screw simultaneous correction technique as a technique for correcting thoracic and lumbar curves scoliosis can improve the treatment of idiopathic scoliosis with fewer vertebral fusion and complications.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"[Treatment of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis with posterior simultaneous correction by bilateral corrective rod on the convex and concave sides].","doi":"","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"Zhonghua wai ke za zhi [Chinese journal of surgery]"}

Vegetable oil has been proposed as an agent to stimulate the natural microbial community. This system becomes anaerobic as the vegetable oil is consumed providing the necessary conditions for metabolizing volatile organic compounds (VOCs). In order for this process to be effective in remediating groundwater contamination, the vegetable oil must be introduced into contamination either directly or by creating a “curtain” down gradient.","inCitations":["a9ef6c375290d4f26af1d6d955a8039370067e8a","5870cd5821655547ffaeac9ba935d0ef276c83f4","ddfb7606ca1fa73593a18bb0cc9800901e49593a","cce6143a9af32a1308a538cf99ded0c4f0e926f0"],"pdfUrls":["https://water.usgs.gov/ogw/bgas/publications/2003-LeadingEdge/2003-LeadingEdge.pdf"],"title":"Offset vertical radar profiling","doi":"10.1190/1.1634910","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1190/1.1634910","venue":""}

Data modulation is carried out by binary phase shift keying and direct sequence spread spectrum signaling. The micro-cellular communication media is modeled as a frequency selective fading channel with multipath propagation. The multipath diversity of the received signals from the K users is exploited by a bank of K RAKE correlators. Algorithms based on the maximum likelihood rule have been developed for estimating the complex channel coefficients as well as for detection of the desired data packets from the sufficient statistics provided by the RAKE correlators. The performance of the resulting multiuser detector is evaluated analytically and via Monte Carlo simulations. The results indicate that the estimator of the channel coefficients has a variance close to the Cramer-Rao lower bound, and that the proposed multiuser detector is capable of eliminating the near-far effect as well as processing the signals propagated through multiple paths. >","inCitations":["55e672ffdc02e77aaed63fe77d63fe062cce52e2","b00fddf0f26edf52118d0d34c81062980d9e1aed","cf574ac69517045faf1efaf2670f3eb147ab2be2","f5fd5228644ab077d06a2a0e76d349521422baab","ab125c2f238986c7ce886cd8fd6ebcb123765407","d1570ec80ad9614b4db0fb9634f379b4edf2e604","ab059252ff9bde9c6ee79db9df5978a8391a98bd","ea52cf356aa8e142a0431a3fa58890b3df1d6041","a1055614fd799245637ca469bb862ad41cf7eaba","befb616502930bf4cbe7833559843e1bd51c9565","884541fa1abb764d9833f17ce36522c3a055b7fb","20c6e4ea04872bf54dfe450254a595ef103eccee","6bc88c146d071bb49a21717601fc33160675d0c2","5115d5cbd810ba5808c975a237bfe9111501c585","de7c8d32602e1904f840c26c20bfe4c2885c7cc5","e3d7b03d2eb43c4ecd69b1baeb4fb073e92384f5","6e5ae8562597168cf15c0afbaf22f3aa7c6f1ed2","5977abfbaabf9546aff831178f4141dd2967443a","df116fe57588147e6fcd1d0161bf053e1e0ccca7","9e9014b9926174aed580b2b44b820f0d7c04ce47","a3bbe46f31b7a2cd203bb032a4e9d4aec91e4750","e00434c64402d05773a2b9814135b141d06c5ce5","ce32f245da68c1dd89e7c912c5183b7cd6c289d8","d2e1cb0a703555ddff4cac759beff35043c3e52a","719d86d4f1ebdc94267d15a6bf0f130b433e458e","62cd0501f3038a56dc13154b67c0213247c7ce9d","395020c017df6b183893399d48b6c4d3b275b9c3","3f0cdcb0d090e75b7053a0bd080aa0aef47f4bee","35268f1acd07fbedb97f8ea3f32bc3876be66859","894410eeaf5202902c626aaa4b0c9f4ae0349955","9c38e4ae82b974c418f5d1b295bdfd8cc076719e","662cd5a3a3c821f19b90b5ede80fa6cf441e23eb","c7ef8a402eb70c3ce0bb66348d013aa3ba1a5151","bed87823925668a450db295a99bdfcf75e6cfa2d","ddd733d1bfe21ae421d64164f040e9446c8fc0b3","e987325cc5d1331b40fef383c141dede67d148a2","85d684000e207bac9e7e93f17871cd37449071a9","47c25444d28f2242978b71eb3032f73735046d93","a6dacfa02db50396ce4963a9db6cbf98870a7e25","e989ae164b17ff19929fa3a51835f9367c62f542","42205de901e5d82f6a05f7645a5d6af851793891","4bf63acd357c9cdc3829badbd6275fcce23d9c9d","ac962ecc804ad0a2b7fb4b283e11b9bc1af8590d","5e46c2b45cb08c1fce3b459d3f5bf92849e999f5","a3817dd860f6bb06a8011f51ef58ab581b5f96f1","9e4ff611a857e2c41a402e93c4ad6f3acebfeb8a","41577e83acd25cf69581e002da1ded5e0f50117b","62c4c420d2cb06f1010689496f8850bbe77703ee","505af991732e2dc3a0d053efe203c400e0986018","3c3c0e985abeb94aa50dd790e1a031610280f3a7","a4cfa8dad1c57a017194f5849996475c2e12d0b7","4f6d6ee0afc5ff012160c7f6e33eea7fc550af82","63bd3bfd9a4f0f94e9d646976a0b754550de341a","2cebb78db45a38ae7d68ccc38457d155f440efbb","79599f96536f8e2850e005146976c4634d7ff0c4","c32d68e402b8aa46412e57fa1457ec64015ef811","b44b7200c6685cd0292d6f1df28e99af7bd1b270","ec5794a18f1d1e7939850413272c14f6d548154b","f7f33c6b74350d5c513dbecebd76ba4b1be33462","782536539103ce28985efba764919d05f4b2d33c","2c47e614493ca5ad731029f055f167fa8b372591","d4874edf4a7e828ae2a616e9663efb1c55d4aa4b","e5fc533e0263690c7c980b6a255b09ceabfd8dce","9f3b4468dc5bb1cf13d75302f9020d5eb5dfe817","fcedd62baeff1858f65486130a6c8946871b3a57","1e31961ea1df04b6f69e063525048412c6586760","e79ea0367e879c574c1f2a731f4f9c37f24b64f1","7a8a6ed519aea38effc897df8b1878a4e53190a5","25e0dae2f5564b1de189c98a0153df20c9ed217d","0ca849f5fa56e3a8babc68fcb9b7e85e2d5752b9","61833813daf6e909d0b60cd44c9fd3e0d377ee2a","a5c9abdad1b1188520d50e8b13c381bf431b94ca","308a62f4c1401e378609f392749cf45dc4f1528b","e167f9c971a260874e6d3318e0ec52776c41f205","837379bbb805a589415886a8e0b435ac64ef19bf","26983cd978504bd3b456051776edd8bad11af192","20e61fb1ea6eb581352e062c2bd11ed349829907","f7a2dbd220112683a7fb4dcbc8be9cff1716f058","aeb79534ccddd2d4c10ed94279f026f7fdcacaf7","e3fd2ad25ba361c7e83eb0659e6038031b31ef41","dffb24c2ff9d1aeae45a262a7d4b2ae5dda6d4c9","b0f4606939c47cd8ce87b6c56a5936571f57d11a","bda3f5021a33a15d0c97fb0a563753d8db2d3df8","90f3cb6610aad0e193039bf6218505ec357f76b8","d2cb7d406f8ca656327c5ad83c262adc5a8ac2a4"],"pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1109/26.380205"],"title":"A multiuser receiver for code division multiple access communications over multipath channels","doi":"10.1109/26.380205","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.380205","venue":"IEEE Trans.

Since patients who are in a critical condition face serious consequences, target waiting times must be determined based on patient acuity levels. To reflect the special situation in emergency care centers included in this study, patient flows are formulated using an open Jackson network with multiple patient classes. This paper is unique because of the integration of pooling and prioritizing patient classes with the open Jackson network. In particular, a hybrid priority model is presented in which a first-come-first-served discipline is applied in some processes and a priority discipline is applied in other processes in the open Jackson network, in order to minimize waiting times for patients with more urgent concerns. A case study based on actual data from an emergency care center demonstrates that the proposed model of pooling and prioritizing patient classes is effective in decreasing waiting times for higher-priority classes without substantially sacrificing those for lower-priority classes.","inCitations":["a76b43d45c60e64482f0f8925e6ce9795cee5e6e","3a05bbde8996b399deee59c00f015be734286683","7bc57dacf907d509fd5f3bc2820ac1be6b8158e1","386b62b47dbfc1d8ed02bf2e454a2fee8c1dbf5c","dccbbd4acb6ca387c1735500ce247f7250215d78","5d959e05e1af750459626a3232af534ff5c144b9","2f922c6efbb13a1d0a169b2984b28d97e45fec02","513d0f6bfffaa28b48f31acb2e0e86ddadbe03ac","672a945b9f8edfdfbedf00ad04fb8ade31d4556e"],"pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1007/s10479-013-1477-2"],"title":"Differentiated waiting time management according to patient class in an emergency care center using an open Jackson network integrated with pooling and prioritizing","doi":"10.1007/s10479-013-1477-2","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10479-013-1477-2","venue":"Annals OR"}

The general patterns of pollination and fertilization found in the family are discussed, as well as the structure of vitaceous berries and seeds.

Light microscopical examination of Giemsa-stained cells revealed no significant differences in the meiotic figures between mutant and wild-type strains. However, only two of the four meiotic products in a developing ascus matured to ascospores in SOS4. Dyad analysis was carried out on an hfd1-1 mutant strain heterozygous for three markers, asp5, gal1, and arg4, which are closely linked to their centromeres, and for his4, which is loosely linked to its centromere. The two-spored asci produced by the hfd1-1 mutant segregated dominant (+) and recessive (-) alleles of each marker in a 1:1 ratio; they generally contained one + and one - spore for any given marker. The occurrence of rare dyads with two + or two - spores can be explained quantitatively by recombination between the marker and its centromere. From the results of these cytological and genetical analyses, we infer that, in the mutant strain, one genome set is partitioned to each of the four second-meiotic division poles, but only two nonsister genomes are incorporated into mature spores. Thus, the hfd1-1 mutation in SOS4 blocks incorporation of two nonsister nuclei into mature ascospores, but does not block enclosure of the remaining two nonsister nuclei.","inCitations":["dbbe984389f38f884f95dd8e7c0f68bcd078c22d","7262a259506644f2c02cb2d6dd55e03188eef464","3f9aace4c1d29f308ed6537618ad4ab066a7230c","6cd5e6605733911536cbc00540c5f97aa7140aea","00f0de9f28f59ead5d369c53e1847dd8fd224296","058ce58892e3f97a0d11ed1c754512208b544992"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Selective abortion of two nonsister nuclei in a developing ascus of the hfd-1 mutant in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.","doi":"","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"Genetics"}

The numerical values at the centres of the rods were compared with values obtained from scan simulations that isolated the effects of the filtered backprojection. Both real scan and simulated data were reconstructed with different algorithms. Air was found to give markedly depressed attenuation values in real scans, but not in the simulations. This effect was considered to be the result of smoothing or inappropriate beam hardening corrections. In the simulated data, air resulted in elevated attenuation values due to overshoot of the point spread function. Such overshoots varied with object size and had a more extensive influence than could be appreciated from the real scan data. Different algorithms produced different central attenuation values as a result of differing overshoot effects. These and other artifact influences make attenuation measurements taken from CT images unreliable for the assessment of pulmonary nodules. Area measurements made over a period of time may more reliably discriminate between benign and malignant nodules.","inCitations":["d410431404595c4140c329384869b60b555e90db","4993c3793e06fbeb042a2e141512b19024e47b3a","e4931cd5d2e431348a205cfa052dca98ddb8320e","7365fe4d9c9cd2d6a5e602a07770c0e07547defa"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"An investigation into the problems of attenuation and area measurements made from CT images of pulmonary nodules.","doi":"","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"Journal of computer assisted tomography"}

The basic mechanism reason for better analgesia effects by stimulation of acupoints than of non-acupoints still remains inconclusive. In this work, the role of mast cells in acupuncture analgesia was investigated in Sprague Dawley (SD) rats. Acupuncture delivered to Zusanli (ST36) significantly increased mast cell degranulation in the acupoint and increased pain threshold (as indicated by increased latency of tail flick response), while injection of disodium chromoglycate (DSCG) to Zusanli (ST36) significantly inhibit mast cell degranulation and attenuated the acupuncture effect. We suggest that mast cell degranulation plays a role in acupuncture-induced analgesia. INTRODUCTION Acupuncture is a traditional Chinese therapeutic technique and used widely for pain management However, the mechanisms underlying the acupuncture-induced analgesia are not well understood. One of the major problems remains unsolved is what the physical basis of meridian is if they exist. More recent researches have focused on the correlation between acupuncture points, meridians and connective tissues. Durimng acupuncture, needles pull and distort the surrounding tissue and thus deliver mechanical signals to the cellular level, leading to \"downstream effects\" that could activate certain cellular pathways and facilitate healing. Based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), anatomical and X-ray Computed Tomography (XCT) of morphological location, all point to the probability that the physical basis of meridians and acupoints was in a complex system mainly of connective tissue. Mast cells, as a resident of connective tissue, have aroused scientist’s attention since early 80’s. It was observed that acupoints have a higher concentration of mast cells than that of non-point location in control areas . The same was true for acupoints along the low impedance meridian lines . Mechanically, by causing local microtrauma, acupuncture stimulated the mast cells in-situ to degranulate and release their mediators. These active mediators, including histamines, caused many local changes such as phagocytosis. The released mediators also cause vasodilation, increased capillary permeability, and triggered a cascade reaction. In the present work, we asked whether mast cell degranulation plays a role in acupuncture-induced analgesia. This work focused on Zusanli (ST36) because Zusanli (ST36) has a high concentration of mast cells and stimulation of this acupoint could induce significsnt analgesia . Tail flick latency was used as the measurement of pain threshold , and the change rate of it reflected the effects of acupuncture analgesia of rats. Besides, numbers and degranulation rate of mast cells in specimens (skin and tissue) from ST36 were statistically calculated within initialized group of rats. (put in the methods). MATERIALS AND METHODS Animals and Groups. A total of forty male and female laboratory-born Sprague-Dawley rats bought from Shanghai Experimental Animal Centre of Chinese Academy of Science were used in this experiment, each with normal tail flick latency and weighed 200±20g. Animals were housed in cages at controlled temperature (20 ± 2°C) with a 14/10 hour light/dark cycle. Food and water were made available optionally. All animals were handled with care to prevent infection and minimize stress. Rats were randomly divided into the following groups: six of normal pain threshold served as the control (A); others were divided into Acupuncture ST36(B1) and sham point Nearby-ST36(B2), Injection of DSCG(C1) and NaCl(C2), Acupuncture after injection of DSCG(D1) and NaCl(D2), and Acupuncture opposite side of injection of DSCG(D3). Nociceptive Testing Model. Flick latencies to a radiant heat stimulus 23 were assessed for each rat using a Model 33T Tail Stimulator Analgesia Meter (IITC Life Sciences, Woodland Hills, CA). The room temperature was kept at 22°C±1 °C.A light beam (40% intensity) was focused on a 2×2 mm region of skin. Flick latencies were obtained by shining the heat light source on the tip of the tail until it flicked. Temperature Change in the tip of the tail was recorded as the flick latency. A 20-s cut-off maximum was programmed into the timer to prevent tissue damage. Rats were habituated to the testing apparatus for 10 min prior to testing on each test day. After the habituation period, the average of 3 times of basic flick latencies was measured for each animal. Then, the changed latencies tested every 5min divided by basic ones are taken as the changed ratio. Acupuncture Stimulation. Manual acupuncture stimulation was performed for 30 minutes with twirling and lift-thrust manipulation every 5min. Sterilized stainless steel acupuncture needles of 0.3 mm diameter were inserted into the loci of Zusanli (ST36) on left feet, located 24 at 5 mm lateral and distal to the anterior tubercle of the tibia. Sham point Nearby-ST36 , which is 0.3mm away from ST36 (in direction to the fibula), was adopted as control point. To quantify the manual acupuncture stimulation, a self-made acupuncture needle real-time forced monitored was used to detect the wave shape of needle manipulation at ST36 on rats. During the acupuncture stimulation, animals were kept in plastic holders with their tails and hind legs protruding out. Animals in the control and injection groups were similarly kept in holders without acupuncture stimulation in order to rule out variations due to stress caused by the restraint. Inhibition of Mast Cells. An inhibitor of degranulation function has been applied to mast cells in Zusanli (ST36), in order to determine the role of mast cells in acupuncture analgesia. Twenty μl of 5% DSCG was injected into ST36 by microliter syringe. The amount and concentration were decided referring to the method of conversion between experiment animals and human. The same amount of 9% NaCl was used as control solution. Specimen Preparations and Microscopic Examination. Specimens at Zusanli (ST36) with a volume of 0.33 cubic millimeters were collected after decapitation under narcotism of the experimental and control animals. Continuous paraffin slices of 4μm in thickness were made from corresponding groups. Some specimens with the same volume were collected from the non-acupoints, which was 0.3mm away from ST36. The slides were then stained with two methods : Toluidine Blue and Neutral Red. Photomicrographs of the slides were taken at 400 with a 40 objective and investigated using light microscopy. The population of mast cells per microscopic view (×200) were taken count of. Only cells with visible nuclei were counted. And the ratios of degranulation and normal mast cells were calculated. To observe the degranulation inside mast cell more clearly, transmission electron microscope (TEM) slice was made for acupuncture and control group. The collection of specimen was the same as paraffin slice. Photomicrographs of the TEM slides were taken. Statistical Analysis. Statistical analyses were performed to compare the tail flick latencies of experimental and control animals. Influence of disodium chromoglycate on the role of mast cells in acupuncture analgesia was estimated as changes in pain threshold 0 pt P P R Δ = ,Where P0 represented the average baseline flick latencies average of 3 times and △P represented the increase or decrease of tail flick latencies. The quantities and degranulation ratios of mast cells per unit area in specimens from all groups were calculated. Differences between groups were considered significant if p < 0.05. All data are represented as mean ± SD. Tests performed to assess significance of differences in the estimates were two-tailed with no adjustments for multiple comparisons. The test statistic used to determine statistical significance of differences between two percents was b 2 a b a S S X X Z + + = , where Xa and Xb are the two percents being compared, and Sa and Sb are the standard errors of those percents. The critical value used for two-sided tests at 0.05 level of significance was 1.96. RESULTS The Criterion of De-qi Sensation. (Fig. 1, Fig.2). Based on previous studies , a self-made acupuncture needle real-time forced monitor was used to detect the wave shape of needle manipulation at ST36 on rats. The mean force of 240-280mN in lifting and thrusting and moment of 10-15mN·mm in twirling may be regarded as a regular range and parameter of De-qi. According to this method, each manual needle insertion in the following experiment could be basically identified to achieve de-qi sensation. The Effect of Acupoint Specificity (Fig.3). During 30min acupuncture at acupoint ST36, pain threshold increased significantly during the first 20min of acupuncture. In contrast, acupuncture in the groups of sham point Nearby-ST36 and blank control did not induce analgesia (How about Nearby-ST36? See Fig 3 Legend). Influence of DSGG injection on the pain thresholds (Fig.4). Same dose of DSCG (20%) and NaCl (0.9%) were merely injected to ST36 acupoint as well as the blank control point. After injection, there was a slight increase in pain thresholds at first. Twenty minutes later, there were no significant differences between the injections with two kinds of solutions. Influence of DSCG on the role of mast cells in acupuncture analgesia. (Fig.5, Table.1) Since the injection temperately increased pain thresholds (Fig. 4), acupuncture was made 20min after the injection. Figure 5 summarized the results of acupuncture effect on various groups. When DSCG was injected to Zusanli (ST36) to inhibit the mast cells, acupuncture analgesia was attenuated. However, injection of NaCl solution at the opposite side did not significantly affect the acupuncture effect ( Table 1).

The validation of long-term cloud data sets retrieved from\nsatellites is challenging due to their worldwide coverage going back as far\nas the 1980s. A trustworthy reference cannot be found easily at every\nlocation and every time. Mountainous regions present a particular problem\nsince ground-based measurements are sparse. Moreover, as retrievals from\npassive satellite radiometers are difficult in winter due to the presence of\nsnow on the ground, it is particularly important to develop new ways to\nevaluate and to correct satellite data sets over elevated areas. In winter for ground levels above 1000 m (a.s.l.) in Switzerland, the cloud\noccurrence of the newly released cloud property data sets of the ESA Climate\nChange Initiative Cloud_cci Project (Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer afternoon\nseries (AVHRR-PM) and Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Aqua series) is\n132 to 217 % that of surface synoptic (SYNOP)\nobservations, corresponding to a rate of false cloud detections between 24 and 54 %. Furthermore, the overestimations\nincrease with the altitude of the sites and are associated with particular\nretrieved cloud properties. In this study, a novel post-processing approach is proposed to reduce the\namount of false cloud detections in the satellite data sets. A combination of\nground-based downwelling longwave and shortwave radiation and temperature\nmeasurements is used to provide independent validation of the cloud cover\nover 41 locations in Switzerland. An agreement of 85 % is obtained when the\ncloud cover is compared to surface synoptic observations (90 % within ±  1 okta difference). The validation data are then co-located with the satellite\nobservations, and a decision tree model is trained to automatically detect the\noverestimations in the satellite cloud masks. Cross-validated results show\nthat 62±13  % of these overestimations can be identified by the model,\nreducing the systematic error in the satellite data sets from 14.4±15.5  % to 4.3±2.8  %. The amount of errors is lower, and, importantly, their\ndistribution is more homogeneous as well. These corrections happen at the\ncost of a global increase of 7±2  % of missed clouds. Using this model,\nit is possible to significantly improve the cloud detection reliability in\nelevated areas in the Cloud_cci AVHRR-PM and MODIS-Aqua products.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://www.atmos-meas-tech-discuss.net/amt-2018-18/amt-2018-18-RC2.pdf"],"title":"Correction of CCI cloud data over the Swiss Alps using ground-based radiation measurements","doi":"10.5194/amt-11-4153-2018","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-11-4153-2018","venue":""}

This work examined the ability of quercetin and quercetin-β- d -glucoside to inhibit lipid oxidation in mechanically separated turkey (MST). Quercetin inhibited formation of lipid peroxides and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) more effectively compared to quercetin-β- d -glucoside during frozen storage ( p  0.05). The possible mechanisms that cause glycosylation to decrease inhibition of lipid oxidation were also examined. Hydroxyl radical scavenging activity was similar when comparing quercetin and quercetin-β- d -glucoside, which indicated that the free hydroxyl group in 3 position of C ring in quercetin did not enhance its hydroxyl radical scavenging ability. Since muscle membrane lipids are susceptible to lipid oxidation, the ability of quercetin and quercetin-β- d -glucoside to incorporate into cellular membranes was studied. After adding quercetin and quercetin-β- d -glucoside to minced chicken muscle, flavonol content in the membrane fraction was determined. Around 32% of added quercetin partitioned into the membranes whereas quercetin-β- d -glucoside was not detected in the membranes. Similar trends were observed when each flavonol was added to isolated membranes. These studies suggest that glycosylation of flavonols weakens their ability to inhibit lipid oxidation in muscle tissue partly by decreasing the amount of flavonols in the membrane phase. In order to understand whether metal chelation by flavonols is a likely mechanism involved in the inhibition of lipid oxidation in MST, the role of endogenous metals in promoting lipid oxidation was examined. Addition of the metal chelators ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) and tetrakis(2-pyridylmethyl) ethylenediamine (TPEN) to MST did not inhibit lipid oxidation, which suggests that endogenous metals present in MST were not promoters of lipid oxidation. Hence it seems unlikely that the mechanism of inhibition by flavonols involved metal chelation in the comminuted muscle.","inCitations":["5e852741793d4bb7a2bdcfbcc2e46657ac2df2db","f58ce989891a06b2174760bd4b3dca8e894be232"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Mechanisms by which flavonol aglycones inhibit lipid oxidation better than glycosylated flavonols in comminuted muscle tissue","doi":"10.1016/j.foodchem.2009.03.079","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2009.03.079","venue":""}

The degree of osteogenesis in the implant was evaluated by histological analysis and histomorphometry 20 and 60 days after the implant. The results showed that new bone formation occurred in all the implants, most evidently in those containing TGF, TNF or IGF. The histomorphometric results, however, showed no significant differences between the groups, perhaps because of technical artifacts and the small number of animals. On the other hand, the formation of new bone was due to osteoconduction rather than osteoinduction, as shown by the observation that osteogenesis decreased with the distance of pHA granules from the calvarium. The earliest evidence of osteogenesis was the presence of dense borders on the surface of pHA: some of them were vacuolated and contained glycoproteins, others resembled osteoid borders. The bone formed at 20 days was of woven type, whereas that present at 60 days was of both woven and lamellar type, suggesting that some degree of remodeling takes place as the implant ages.","inCitations":["a783b7b6a1495a58eca15b689b036acecdabdd1a","8b9c34ed190e2151ced12eae29b12edf8df973e7","12a5cd19cc933226d3377e0257276f5d66f9bd5d","45e23e5b177b6b14a4e64f3d09574bc7d7c600dc","9b84e74acd08ac91e525546d9555749062302ba3"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"The presence of different growth factors does not influence bone response to hydroxyapatite: preliminary results","doi":"10.1007/s10195-004-0037-6","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10195-004-0037-6","venue":"Journal of Orthopaedics and Traumatology"}
