This book by Amiria Henare, a museum anthropologist at Cambridge, is both a product of and an argument for this renewed interest in objects’ potential for yielding insights into cultural dynamics. It is simultaneously a historical and a material ethnography. Henare’s focus is on the shifting significances and movements of artifacts in New Zealand and Scotland from the late eighteenth century to the present day. Within this historical framework, she explores how objects and collections both constitute and instantiate social relations. In so doing, she offers a meticulously researched, object-centered historical account of changing tides in both anthropology and museums. She also shows that certain theoretical trends in anthropology have sometimes obfuscated the ways in which museums and their collections have served compound aims and purposes, often embodying myriad and opposing agendas. As one might imagine, Henare’s work is grounded in a theoretical perspective in which objects’ meanings are generally in flux. However, she is careful to articulate that her endeavor is distinct from anthropological work that conceptualizes objects as vehicles for human agency, as well as from work that views objects as “texts” with encoded meanings awaiting anthropological unpacking. As she observes, such studies tend to eclipse the sensuality of objects and the ways in which their physicality can instantiate meaning. In this sense, she is arguing for a view of objects similar to that proposed by Robert Plant Armstrong, although he is missing from her extensive bibliography. Armstrong (1971) pioneered a vision of art as an “affecting presence,” arguing that certain material objects, by way of their physicality, their repeated appearances at significant events, or their associations with cultural codes, become imbued with emotive force. As Henare’s book and other recent works attest, this approach to material and expressive culture is enjoying renewed popularity in anthropology (see Adams 2006; Krantz 1994). Likewise, while Henare nods to studies that highlight the social lives of objects and applauds scholars’ recognition of the parallels between people and objects (our corporeality in the world, etc.), she underscores that while our presence in the world is limited by death, artifacts are able to perform their unique roles in social life precisely because of their potential longevity—they “collapse spatial and temporal distance, bringing people together who would otherwise remain quite literally out of touch” (p. 6). Henare returns to this point throughout her book, offering compelling historical and ethnographic examples drawn from New Zealand and Scotland. By the end of her book, readers will most likely appreciate her corrective to critiques likening museums to prisons that remove artifacts from communities (thereby severing flows of exchange). As she surmises, a view of museums as enclaving objects from social life obscures the fact that museum artifacts still enable social ties. Museums, she argues, bring together researchers, descendants, curators, and others to study their collections. Although they certainly restrict the mobility of objects in space, in so doing museums ensure the ability of these artifacts to move through time. While Henare’s perspective may seem conservative to advocates of repatriation, she offers her intervention with delicacy and finesse. Still, I wish that her position had been presented in tandem with a broader array of the voices of peoples whose objects inhabit these museum collections. Henare strengthens her argument concerning the social potency of museum artifacts by interweaving her historical analysis with brief excerpts from her field notes. These excerpts recount her experiences on research visits to collections in Scotland and New Zealand. Sometimes she is joined by the Maori artist Maureen Launder, whose creative works grow out of her own studies of Maori artifacts. Through these personal vignettes, readers gain additional glimpses of the ways in which museum artifacts make possible social ties and indirect dialogue between people from distant times and places. Henare’s first substantive chapter traces the movements of some of the artifacts acquired by Captain Cook and his men in New Zealand. Acknowledging and engaging with the prior work of scholars such as Nicholas Thomas (1991) and Adrienne Kaeppler (1978), Henare recounts how Maori and early European explorers used these objects, in tandem with verbal exchanges, as the basis of engagements, challenges, and seductions. She also explores the shifting significances attached to these “artificial curiosities” in eighteenth-century Britain. Her second chapter traces Joseph Banks’s journey to the Scottish highlands shortly after his travels on Cook’s first voyage, noting the comparisons he drew between Scottish highlanders and groups such as the Maori. As Henare observes, Banks and other Enlightenment thinkers relied heavily on objects, as well as language, as keys to understanding these “hinterland” cultures: artifacts in this era were emerging as valuable scientific specimens that could yield insights into the nature of their creator peoples. In her words, “Like their makers, they were objects not only of measured curiosity and detached speculation, but of sensuous engagement. . . . [Thus] the treatment of artifacts epitomized the entanglement of reason and the passions in the Enlightenment, the coupling of sense and sensibility” (p. 73).","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"A Paean to the Epistemological Potency of Artifacts","doi":"10.1086/512994","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1086/512994","venue":""}

One of the open issues in hand-vein verification is the lack of robustness against image quality degradation, which may comprise the verification accuracy. To achieve robust verification, vein feature extraction approaches, especially vein texture segmentation, have been extensively investigated. In recent years, deep neural networks have achieved promising results in medical image segmentation and have been brought into vein verification, but current solutions suffer from two challenges for vein segmentation: 1) lacking the labeling data, which is expensive to obtain and 2) the incorrect label data obtained by manual labeling scheme or automatic labeling scheme may strongly influence parameters when the network is trained, which may degrade the verification performance. This paper proposes an iterative deep belief network (DBN) to extract vein features based on the initial label data, which are automatically generated using a very limited a priori knowledge and iteratively corrected by our DBN. First, a known handcrafted vein image segmentation technique is employed to automatically label vein pixel and background pixel. A training dataset is constructed based on the patches centered on the labeled pixels. Second, a DBN is trained on the resulting database to predict the probability of each pixel to belong to be a vein pixel given a patch centered on it. The vein patterns are segmented using a probability threshold of 0.5. The resulting vein features are employed to reconstruct the training dataset, based on which the network is retrained. During the iterative procedure, the incorrect labels of training data are statistically corrected, which enables DBN to effectively learn what a finger-vein pattern is by learning the difference between vein patterns and background ones. The experimental results on two public hand-vein databases show a significant improvement in terms of hand-vein verification accuracy.","inCitations":["498688dc051d727e2ede5aa49495feca443d1fe1","03f23522a99bb283d43aa8ff8f7500180a7eba92","e4e502975f0f507682224410d382d9aa7e5ba178"],"pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2901335"],"title":"An Iterative Deep Neural Network for Hand-Vein Verification","doi":"10.1109/access.2019.2901335","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/access.2019.2901335","venue":"IEEE Access"}

It generates 10–100 MWth for ∼66 and 5.9 full power years, respectively, without refueling. Natural circulation of in-vessel liquid sodium cools the reactor core during nominal steady-state operation and after shutdown, with the aid of an in-vessel chimney (2–8 m tall) and an annular Na/Na heat exchanger (HEX) of concentric helically coiled tubes. A natural circulation thermal-hydraulics model of the SLIMM reactor is developed to investigate the effects of thermal power, in-vessel chimney height, and HEX design on the circulation rate and core exit temperature of in-vessel liquid sodium and the pressure losses during steady-state operation. The HEX design parameters investigated are the number, pitch and tube diameter of the helical coils, and the temperature pinch between the in-vessel sodium flow in the downcomer and the secondary sodium flow through the HEX coils. Increasing the reactor thermal power or the in-vessel chimney height increases the flow rate of the in-vessel liquid sodium by natural circulation, but decreases its exit temperature from the reactor core. Conversely, increasing the number or the tube diameter of the HEX helical coils decreases the flow rate of in-vessel liquid and increases its exit temperature from the reactor core, and decreases the HEX total height. Depending on the steady-state reactor thermal power and HEX design, the in-vessel sodium flow through the reactor core contributes ∼64–69% of the total pressure losses, while the sodium flow in the HEX contributes ∼32–29%, respectively","inCitations":["dc16fe2838a86897f7addc37914b969571c6078b"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Natural circulation thermal-hydraulics model and analyses of “SLIMM” – A small modular reactor","doi":"10.1016/j.anucene.2016.11.036","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.anucene.2016.11.036","venue":""}

In parallel, most hospitals face increased pressure to contain costs. This article presents a study of managers’ perceptions of tightness of budgetary control and how their views vary systematically with personal characteristics and organizational conditions. Method: Data were collected through a postal survey in 2005 to 173 clinical department managers (response rate of 70%). Statistical analysis was performed by factor analysis and logistic regression. Results: The data suggest that clinical department managers’ perceptions of tight budgetary control were related to how long they had been in their current position, their profession (whether they were doctors or non-doctors) and their sex. Further, their perceptions could be explained by how close the managers’ departments were to their budget targets. Conclusions: Perception of tight budgetary control by managers depends on both their personal characteristics and the financial situation of their departments. Differences between men and women, and doctors and nondoctors call for additional research about the possible impact of changes in the composition of clinical department managers on how budgetary responsibility is exercised.","inCitations":["e2b3e14d4c3e3bc8e1a452d589999f114932d780","3fdb9c527ffb0388f3f42494b2f532a662993b3c"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Tight budgetary control: A study of clinical department managers’ perceptions in Swedish hospitals","doi":"10.1258/jhsrp.2008.008063","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1258/jhsrp.2008.008063","venue":"Journal of health services research & policy"}

However, its application to nekton living in open coastal areas is still very scarce. This study aims to test if stable isotope analysis can be used for this purpose over a much wider spatial scale than previously investigated. Stable isotope analysis was used to 1) investigate isotopic variation in shrimp and fish, in 11 sites, along a 160 km coastal stretch, to 2) determine the site fidelity of the individuals within each species, and to 3) test the relation between the body size of the individuals within each species, at each site and the percentage of isotopic deviants. Site fidelity was the highest for the intertidal fish Gobius paganellus and Coryphoblennius galerita, with 60% and 64% of individuals considered residents, respectively, and lowest for the demersal fish Diplodus vulgaris and Diplodus sargus with 23% and 33% of resident individuals, respectively. The percentage of isotopic deviants was not correlated with length in any species. Site fidelity was considerably higher than that previously found for other open coastal areas and similar to more structured environments, like coastal ponds. It was hypothesized that the complex tri-dimensional structure of the rocky reefs that occur in this area, often encompassing channels and tide pools, offers conditions favourable to high site fidelity. This study shows that stable isotopes can be used to infer nekton movement in wide open coastal areas.","inCitations":["20cd33cfffe125c5823277832f5c46452933d1a4"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Can stable isotopes be used to infer site fidelity of nekton in open coastal areas","doi":"10.1016/j.ecolind.2016.06.055","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2016.06.055","venue":""}

NITS spectra is able to accurately predict for oleic, linoleic, and palmitic acids (R(cv)>0.844, R(2)>0.886). R(cv) are 0.91987, 0.95755, and 0.84447, and R(2) are 0.9424, 0.9682, 0.8862 for NITS models of oleic, linoleic, and palmitic acids, respectively.

H., Lee, M. F., and Liao, S. C.(1995) J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 96, 352-359). This article presents the nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of two cDNA clones encoding major allergens of P. americana. Clones C12 and C20 encode proteins of 685 and 631 amino acids with two potential N-glycosylation sites each. The predicted molecular weights for C12 and C20 cloned proteins are 79,300 and 75, 500 with isoelectric point values of 6.26 and 6.63, which are compatible with the determined sizes (Mr 78,000 and 72,000) and isoelectric point value (6.2) of the Cr-PI allergens of P. americana. A high degree of identity (69.1%), including several overlapped predicted central antigenic determinant residues, was found between two allergens. The anti-fusion protein antibody-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was able to detect crude American cockroach extract, Cr-PI, recombinant proteins, and commercial cockroach extracts, which provides further evidence that two allergens share common antigen determinants. Recombinant allergens of clones C12 and C20 both showed 47.4% skin reactivities on 19 cockroach-sensitive asthmatic patients. Unexpectedly, although no sequence similarity was found to other known allergens, two aromatic amino acid-rich allergens were found to have a striking sequence identity to insect storage proteins (20.1-33.9%), insect juvenile hormone-suppressible proteins (30.9-36.4%), and arthropod hemocyanins (29.7-34.6%). Results suggested that two prominent allergens of P. americana are ancestrally related to these insect hemolymph proteins and represent a new group of proteins in the hemocyanin superfamily. These data will now facilitate epitope-mapping studies, and the recombinant allergens may be valuable for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes.","inCitations":["930c91cf9ed5ef63886e6e51f1e4b1092e4bf5f3","3690e7b79d5c30a0ed265ae90cf5f3cf49fb5ccc","2448034a1f7856cb13e9d26c48765871f2d653c1","5ce41bb460da965dff5c3ce2590f8a41477f7770","88a718539893c9b21ea2746f320ff97c9047b4bf","d015fa66b7e5d4ba4bee4998f27f07a7ebae8aee","f4fe2846933f088e8abc138e08dde9af081c8ffe","d7c2557c53dd7e1280b30cd5fedf45630ce636f6","5e5bbc3a38edbe2a89f6220ae98ced2d681a267f","4f19270cef30d0d807d5c2c41df81214688534eb","0c5d8cde12b6e357eb0d287cd2722ab6a50e5014","74104dfd2927bf14227303d7f6c48103807c7d6b","ffe1ea74627595eee759979d064f161fe4b27567","461ee5cd23628c828fa0e9ca37d249aea9204a63","dd245dfc1915f503e7edc52ad6ab0600e813dce3","2b064d0904b31c74c981acfd00d8671215f57b17","4697cfab0f5a751e87771e55f50f6eef78de421f","c58266718fdea1fa221110b958027c9576567dc1","9ea7bd9c160e2755fb03af7255574c08a769c209"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Sequencing analysis of cDNA clones encoding the American cockroach Cr-PI allergens.

Aim: The aim of this study is to elucidate the role of Indian variety of R. mucronata leaves on glucose impairing metabolism during diabetes by in vitro and in vivo methods. Materials and Methods: The ethanolic fraction of R. mucronata leaves extract (RHE) was assessed for DPPH (1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl) radical scavenging and in vitro anti-diabetic action through α-amylase and α-glucosidase activity assessment. Oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and insulin sensitivity test (IST) were assessed and their counteraction with RHE (100 and 200 mg/kg, p.o) and glibenclamide (10 mg/kg, p.o) in streptozotocin (STZ) (50 mg/kg, intravenous) induced hyperglycemic rats were also monitored for 28 days. The data were analyzed statistically using t-test. Results: RHE dose-dependently inhibited α-amylase and α-glucosidase enzymes and lowered the area under the curve (AUC) for glucose on both OGTT and IST. RHE also significantly (p < 0.01) controlled glycemic index and thereby reducing diabetic complications as assessed by lipid profiles, atherogenic index, and coronary index in STZ rats. Conclusion: RHE at doses of 100 and 200 mg/kg/day for 28 days provided a significant decrease in diabetes complications and metabolic impairment.","inCitations":["cf64f5a38c9a9f8808535f12fc6911e6a629ac1a","c44fc52e2f4bbf4a6607afa8d490c496bba80b25","444cb6fd3001135105eecd8622ebb6649df56822","4795672c1552137b5dd5c778a88881606b1ce965","536407dc3f43401e5a794b0ca107ce36d8e9e71a"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Antidiabetic and antioxidant activity of Rhizophora mucronata leaves (Indian sundarban mangrove): An in vitro and in vivo study","doi":"10.4103/ayu.AYU_182_15","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.4103/ayu.AYU_182_15","venue":"Ayu"}

Оскільки до 40 % твердих побутових відходів відноситься до органічних, що легко розкладаються, вилучення цієї частини відходів зі звалищ через компостування та перетворення відходу на вторинний матеріальний ресурс суттєво зменшить екологічне навантаження на фактично діючі та потенційно заплановані звалища. Аеробне компостування є однією з найкращих найбільш доступних технологій для інтегрованої системи управління відходами за рахунок мінімізації антропогенного впливу на довкілля, відповідності новітнім вітчизняним та зарубіжним розробкам, економічній та практичній прийнятності технології. Метою експериментального дослідження є вивчення можливості прискорення процесу компостування харчової складової твердих муніципальних відходів за рахунок внесення мікробіологічних добавок для впровадження в якості природоохоронної технології на звалищах. У статті представлено результати дослідження впливу мікробіологічної добавки на перебіг процесів компостування харчової складової твердих побутових відходів з метою його прискорення в мезофільному і термофільному температурних режимах з керованими параметрами. Для підвищення ефективності процесу компостування та порівняння особливостей перебігу процесів в якості інокуляту використовували ґрунт, в якості мікробіологічної добавки – екстракт з ґрунту. Показано, що мікробіологічний комплекс прискорює процес компостування харчової складової твердих побутових відходів в 3,3 рази за термофільного режиму і в 2,1 рази за мезофільних умов проведення процесу компостування, що свідчить про ефективність його використання в процесах переробки твердих побутових відходів з метою підвищення загального рівня екологічної безпеки. Ключові слова: компостування, відходи, суміш, яка компостується, мікробіологічна добавка, мезофільний і термофільний режими.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://repositsc.nuczu.edu.ua/bitstream/123456789/6847/1/13-21-%D0%9Elga%20Sagdeeva.pdf"],"title":"Цієї Частини Відходів Зі Звалищ Через Компостування Та Перетворення Відходу На Вторинний Матеріальний Ресурс Суттєво Зменшить Екологічне Навантаження На Фактично Діючі Та Потенційно Заплановані Звалища.

It is based primarily on the concept of the structural conservatism of the cortical fibrillar structures. Three subphyla, the Postciliodesmatophora, Rhabdophora, and Cyrtophora, are described. These three subphyla are divided respectively into the following classes: (1) the Postciliodesmatophora, into the Karyorelictea and Spirotrichea; (2) Rhabdophora, into the Prostomea and the Litostomea n, nov.; and (3) Cyrtophorea, into the Nassophorea n. nov., Phyllopharyngea, Coipodea, and Oligohymenophorea. The subclass divisions of these eight classes are briefly discussed. Problem areas are indicated where further research will test the relationship proposed by this new macrosystem.","inCitations":["34c5300b11c6c31f7cef378e6abb3bac6ab727b0","de4c994a9a577f4e05e01fa2f8c3c4e1be2b6138","90d97ffd9e93e7cdd08b8dc6bf41ee344bfded7a","b8115f3a7b56e3fb49d21b8e69c54e33104ab42c","9632b85eb735aca74c0a27b5f576ca12a96f1828","c75aa8ec71c9612114f7ce2ee61c102835e34b61","8260a017cc7455c8c3cc4022b6d488cbcf3e3b31","68eb2a426b2be2bab53ebaf7813d43651404608a","3492326d871bb71790beeff7bd25136e6850579b","9ba5a5d4638f23c34800f74432e57c6429e4d0fa","f6f447942e2abd124bbda8ea25db1a6f0589c7aa","f54c9edd244536afc8d1976f68f22bfd1abfd3b5","104f41d26ad02225b2ab974cf385d81ee4a2a73f","8191a4c66d4bd9c7c3e02e516834ac4aad16b531","75b1663241f5f731d21fdf020e64ee9a958a97fa","92cfe7664d2ba04fb953347cea4382cf0d122487","44f3db6ac82319c55a560946007c68e18992ca21","786f81e680748429ac2dd61e32a2f3904b7cce3b","34abe77404736cfe5b11a173726a5642883e9dad","15a40a71240c394ae9c8640d20b263a3c88a2e05","38db7f170ba41a1ca8ef9786bdaa6595b0d864b9","d3bcd9a54d2b3a29c05a49de0a12737002ae8301","dbe8a91d79a6ef686894d35d3e8e999c2a10add8","7dfd7be234a9c68f2cc9125d2181a4f1fafe0414","e27b26dda1919ca81bec5c8f79ea6bfb6f98f93f","d5ee7e573afe463222d4f680a44e42a96af38ca9","09bfd2979a0fc1fd401a8838cca436c813560dd2","87fc81ab3c021c1dd14f6c789cb4b6a5b110a7ee","1f520a2846a86e18f5edf36a8e0662cb29677c8a","82ccf3e4663b4928cd9e71f7252fe0aec4f37141","721ee69991f88d65eb5426a308ca881b846b1653","2e0967f8f102890dba4b64f53688ac63e48a4c1f","60b26cafb0d39922f315e6f6a3af1845a2b7c35b","1a5ff730a148a67051b539c0e8efda1ed9b88e01","63002c6765bdd8d4095e08284a64cbc4098f0816","92a35dd470479c63c002fa9ae5711616d203a00c","7e3055792426432b010496794dc15b39c59ef058","26348b2e0c07004459415d93721056d53230d6cb","829dfa1ef597f2ee04be2bd3bf3af0328fbe04dd","323368d354bb8b1c6cd8a3b1538e09ea485a3c71","cfef22adb62f9f6b884959e041f5ce52c4b7863f","42be8ae45e50e7ca081b3fd6f1c3b81f9017940c","8272e197937cfddcb2558ebedf90f3c690afa4b2","a89cd9aa3974b57c81b3681c0a6d99553efd8007","1e27c67a6909589714829a3433ea393093ee97ae","1228bb30ad9053d4a3b0f17a633bb01169d932b3","549eb1f71aabf2eef17fab41db4416df0a30daea","075702faeb4c1deaf537c457651916c894d1d970","12ffdf6e29e1bd9bdb706ab27b8ad8d15b48a1ed","61332930dc93cce4dda61d184ef138911684ab4b","a4deb6a4694ae6f52b26a8820d5241c435752c57","ef020b80cda501711a2e7c7d243e29b193530091","93462be2add1b5be07fc254c61fe8bbcf164f33f","c5c8915093418547b71477f4afe288f9b23a68ee","55a2d434c34afb4936ba03cce6a4a7d0a6d9fb65","17c54984202d354aba7bfde9a971237339b56afc","4a492e411b24b4919c041cdbb1654a467c156b2c","d6d112c29c6baf0095d8017f6db04f7dbd31562f","9c9364d7a801ebf55802cd38de4201394287a094","24f7e9f3939d9c0a4af64f6640cc48582d137d11","422f3b142c3aa48bad727ced45e413e8df739d9f","f2d8cf88533697c9dfb9bde4ff8773c662b96015","7f6c785b604c0e67bfaa76b352683da6ea702ec2","714c38ee550872088cf6aa390871e323a374727e","1e7e034cb7b68a706bab617c88dcbdaca508c6dd","d479ded6d9063504c7ac7749f524b38b3b74f6af","77140d54f56516c5ad9ddc17ce82cb9298718045","e385ce6f252f58d2f01908b8e3cbb5f7352e65fe","9743e5940ebdd3970c9c9c93ef104d98aafeb048","303b0fa9c2b00e4dafd37044a075c4166e66ea20","60beb996222aae26d9d0fde623d641576851dbba","542f17fac4dbdeb217541548b279379c73b7951b","add33cb68f1fdd4bf51774c5d17edc959c3596d1","99ae503898c49a448644df1d74a4e51e825bb472","9d17644d9f60b2d74f72045101923b1bf8e2b095","b75a4b105cd5ec751b28dfb62153ab6973b739d9","a0be2c8f1d6e994949c1a906c32f33349d9a9903","ae7a68e771c11e19e7f2c6ace6596035858f449b","02d7b8131e62f09ccedc78189a23b0407aacf399","e11bb8b29d1addfb8e7b803a9d8e4ef76f7f872d","4e86b6803f5ddbc05ec8f09b835336c2989de4ba","e71d756f7b50f2ba8df624cdeeaf01940e80b736","f092ce6d9f8889be937e5b5e0f4e869eca635fb6","5725cebd81b90be3cd6ec64c41159a6000a574f2","d125af0e20a6932d3f502c781b508da718200c60","67637cfa0a5b0700cb5ef5bcda2c877584cc6364","94a248aaf1c07957cd5c916e346b5e8819404268","9e09de18be02b308149fb6daf4a2d4da220a4427","9e37c67024e29c2d24c9cded4706de383f7a5574","36e6da473d83ffd4bbfed9f7e3823a6f7031e54c","fa7fe07a106999419f04f02fe12554743634232d","c2c58563fc6ebd235119b184f6058ac293c82a40","af989f4a6d1a9a0a77e02b418026fff6224923cb","f39565b70755f238963161517d6eb434f33aafe6","adb1108926d376b134573cebfab2f04997601826","9a9a43fadf8c8ca34871586b1fbda4aed6c55d8f","d81c835d8e5a3e4c9cfd05cae3a798fc1cbcedc1","44aa6d6f285dcd6fbf4bb8bf3012218ec57c518f","193db71eb76e050ed6c5848a21812693b26daa98","f85df6ad92d52cba87016bae0e36497e6b9e62ee","5ccbebdf398281e73f84020607ccfe4b1b2aaeb0","d57174f6ff3b1293564ce0b196031872908050e0","607c075e00c9f5ad48f1c8c1349d623638e2c41d","a812962395578f39963f15c15a36fc1c5ed1c435"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"A new macrosystem for the phylum Ciliophora doflein, 1901.","doi":"10.1016/0303-2647(81)90045-9","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/0303-2647%2881%2990045-9","venue":"Bio Systems"}

In a previous paper (Tunca, C.; Ford, D. M. J. Chem.Phys. 1999, 111, 2751), we used multidimensional TST to obtain the escape rate of adsorbate molecules from an a cage in zeolite ZK4 as a function of loading. A physically reasonable approximation was applied to make the TST partition functions tractable, and they were evaluated with a nested Widom insertion scheme. However, that study was limited to the case of empty neighboring cages and nondynamically corrected rate constants. This paper extends the work in several ways. First, we consider the effects of adsorbate occupancy in the neighboring cages. Our results show that the TST escape rates increase with loading in the original cage but show nonmonotonic behavior with respect to loading in the destination cage. Furthermore, we employ an expanded ensemble method (EEM) to obtain the partition functions, thus avoiding the limitations associated with the Widom insertions used previously. Even at high cage loadings, the results have small statistical errors due to the use of the EEM. Finally, we calculate and present dynamical corrections to the rate constants.

ABSTRACT : The increase of microelectronic device potentialities essentially derives from the reduction of feature size down the nanometre scale. Multi-nanodots memories are one illustration of this trend. Low Pressure Chemical Vapor Deposition (LPCVD) seems to be one of the most efficient ways to form silicon nanodots for industrial applications. We have deposited silicon nanodots in two technologies of hot wall reactors, an industrial tubular one called TEL and a prototype sector reactor. Nanodots have been elaborated from pure silane in the TEL and from silane diluted in nitrogen or pure disilane in the Sector. The run durations are very short, less than 1 min. In order to optimize nanodots fabrication, studies of density and size reproducibility and uniformity on wafer have been carried out in the TEL and in the Sector. The uniformity wafer to wafer has been also studied in the TEL reactor. With the aim of a better control of the phenomena involved during silicon nanodots deposition, a multi-field study has been performed. The influence of various process parameters has been analysed by experiments method and numerical simulations at the reactor scale with the CFD software Fluent. Very high densities, till 1.3 1012 dots/cm2 have been obtained for the highest pressures tested. The specific role of unsaturated species about nucleation for the ultrathin deposits has been evidenced. New operating ranges of pressure and temperature have been found allowing to increase deposition durations. New kinetic heterogeneous laws adapted to nanodots deposits have been developed allowing to correlate the process parameters to density and size of nanodots. This first modelling tool will allow to test various mechanisms of interaction between surface bonds and gaseous precursors","inCitations":["fcd51bc93d34f33602c4d6dad0e243372a4845c2","a79285e36fda3e8837d9e4a2e7dab86eb195b1d2"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Synthèse de plots quantiques de silicium par LPCVD pour les nouvelles générations de mémoires non volatiles","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Without competitive elections, freedom of expression, or interest-group mobilization or participation, most determinants of policy routinely studied in Western democracies are inoperative. Furthermore, given that State socialist regimes and centralized economic planning appear to be historical dead ends, what can be learned today from the study of this political experiment? In this article on housing policy in the GDR, I will argue that the question of knowledge, its construction, its circulation, and its uses are at least as essential to the intelligibility of these regimes as the study of ideology and repression. Central State control over all economic and symbolic resources and the systematic exclusion of autonomous social input makes State socialist systems an interesting place to study bureaucratic domination in a “pure” form. 1 More precisely, in a context where decisionmakers were largely insulated from social forces, statistical knowledge, surrounded by its aura of scientific objectivity, 2 constituted an essential basis for policy formulation and a vector of the bureaucratic domination of society. 3 For scholars of State socialism, policy analysis holds the potential to link together “top down” and “bottom-up” approaches by studying the bureaucratic ordering of society and the effects of policies on social identities. More generally, the study of the construction and uses of statistical conventions in State socialism mirrors, in an extreme form,","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Knowledge and Power in State Socialism: Statistical Conventions and Housing Policy in the GDR","doi":"10.1353/jph.2007.0016","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1353/jph.2007.0016","venue":""}

Thermoresponsive AIE supramolecular complexes were prepared on the basis of electrostatic attraction, hydrogen bonding interactions and host–guest interactions between amino-containing thermoresponsive hyperbranched polymers and carboxylic acid-containing AIE molecules. Different from the other thermoresponsive AIE systems, the as-prepared thermoresponsive AIE supramolecular complexes exhibited two different temperature-dependent emission responses, i.e. one signal experienced an obvious emission boost with increasing temperature around the phase transition temperature (PTT), whereas the other signal showed a monotonous emission decrease with increasing temperature accompanied with a slope increase change around the PTT. From these two different temperature-dependent emission responses, the PTTs of these thermoresponsive AIE supramolecular complexes could be facilely read-off even in dilute solution, where the traditional turbidimetry technique loses efficacy. The influence of solvent composition, complex concentration, complex composition, inorganic anions and inorganic cations on the phase transition behavior of the as-prepared supramolecular complex was explored in detail by using the fluorescence technique.","inCitations":["335298a108a12e2df9221355063b01218af60b42","047c13346ea109d628874c7057c0cfd83163a442"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Thermoresponsive AIE supramolecular complexes in dilute solution: sensitively probing the phase transition from two different temperature-dependent emission responses","doi":"10.1039/C8TC01323C","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1039/C8TC01323C","venue":""}

The area of Baikal Siberia is cultural importance for study of early human dispersal and the peopling of the New World and the Japan Islands. A Siberian Paleolithic Radiocarbon Database has already been compiled, allowing us to get chronological comprehension of human colonization of this area (Vasilev, Kuzmin, Orlova, Dementiev 2002). However, charcoal and bone remains almost were not found in several the Upper Pleistocene sites, the time scale was decided by few radiocarbon dates in each site. Furthermore, thin occupational layers coupled with variability and complexity of physically mixed artifacts often yield ambiguous C results from nearby material but not intrinsic to the artifact. Therefore, in order to get the accurate and precise radiocarbon chronologies for this period, it is necessary to construct a soil science procedure for radiocarbon dating which has the potential to overcome the problems. In this study, we have mainly present the comparison of radiocarbon dates among total organic carbon, humins, humic acids and carbonate in soil samples, charcoal and bone remains associated with artifacts in Bal’Shoj Naryn sites, located the Northwest of Lake Baikal (Fig. 1). The interpretation of soil materials in radiocarbon analysis have been widely discussed (e.g., Chen, Polach 1986; Orlova, Panychev 1993; Kristiansen, Dalsgaard, Holst, Aaby, Heinemeier 2003) , but the dates in Baikal Siberian sites have not been reported. Our results showed that the dates of charcoal and bone remains comparatively corresponded with soil components. We conclude that our method of soil science procedure and radiocarbon dating of soil materials has the potential of being a useful tool which evaluate the dates of archaeological sites and the process of the deposit in the Baikal Siberia.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://www.kunstkamera.ru/files/lib/978-5-02-025271-4/978-5-02-025271-4_11.pdf"],"title":"Radiocarbon Dating of the Upper Pleistocene Stratum","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Intravaginal FGA sponge was inserted for 13 days and 600 IU equine chorionic gonadotropin was administered for ewes of FGA and FGA-PGF groups at the time of sponge removal (day 0). In addition, 10 mg was administered to ewes of FGA-PGF group on day 0. Blood and milk samples were collected from all ewes on days -13, -6, 0, 1, 2, 7 and 14. Estradiol had significant positive correlation with the SCC during the periods of sponge insertion (P = 0.015, r = 0.235) and within two days (P = 0.063 r = 0.23) after sponge removal with no correlation with SCC of both udder halves during the luteal phase. Progesterone concentrations, on the other hand, had a significant positive correlation (P < 0.001; r = 0.420) with the SCC of both udder halves during the luteal phase of the experiment, but not during the periods of sponge insertion and expected estrus. SCC returned under the influence of endogenous progesterone on days 7 and 14 to pre-synchronization values. In conclusion, sheep milk SCC is affected significantly with induction of estrus and steroid hormones concentrations. However, peak SCC recorded during estrus was far below the upper limit of the current standard for normal milk. With the current standards for SCC of 1,000,000/ml as legal limit for abnormal milk control programs in sheep, estrus synchronization programs and the estrus status should not be considered when bulk-tank milk SCC is being investigated, but should be considered during the process of setting new standards.","inCitations":["1efc41f09ded128be077fca2ee70c6aeeab160e6"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"The effect of estrus synchronization treatments on somatic cell count of transitional-anestrus Awassi ewes' milk.","doi":"","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"Tropical animal health and production"}

La palabra editorial se defi ne como: «articulo de fondo no fi rmado»,1 y en realidad esto no nos da una perspectiva verdadera de lo que signifi ca. Una ampliacion del signifi cado de la palabra puede ser: «articulo de opinion escrito por el editor de un periodico o revista. Usualmente no lleva fi rma y por lo general refl eja la opinion de la revista.»2 Sin embargo, este articulo si lleva fi rma, y aunque podria refl ejar la opinion de la Revista Mexicana de Trasplantes, es mas bien una interpretacion personal del titulo de este articulo. Para poder escribir lo siguiente me pregunte que tan importante era la participacion del area medica en general respecto a la investigacion en el pais. Para responder a esto consulte la evaluacion del ano 2009 del Sistema Nacional de Investigadores de CONACYT y me di cuenta de que el Area III de este sistema (medicina y ciencias de la salud) es la de mayor numero de articulos publicados por cientifi cos mexicanos durante 2009 (1,057), pero a su vez la que tiene el menor numero de investigadores de las siete areas que lo comprenden, con un total de 1,592. Como habitante costero de nuestro pais, evidencie como el 61% de estos investigadores (919) estan en el Distrito Federal y el resto en el interior.3 No ahonde en la presencia de la medicina de trasplantes plasmada en estos datos, ya que al simplemente leerlos me convenci de que era imposible generar un estimulo hacia la investigacion cientifi ca con cifras tan desalentadoras, basado en la interpretacion de que la investigacion cientifi ca en medicina y ciencias de la salud era productiva pero reservada para un numero reducido de profesionales de la salud en la capital de nuestro Mexico. Estos hechos me hicieron ahondar en la historia de la investigacion medica en nuestro pais y recordar que fue en 1772 cuando se edito la primera revista medica de America: Mercurio volante, y en 1876 cuando se realizo el Primer Congreso Nacional de Medicina en Mexico;4 pero aun asi no fue sufi ciente. Lo que me hizo darme cuenta de la verdadera importancia de la investigacion medica fue el escuchar, recientemente, la frase de un colega argumentando que a todos sus pacientes siempre les iba muy bien. Esto me hizo recordar una de las fuentes del conocimiento para las ciencias de la salud conocida como «autoridad»: personas con conocimientos especializados falibles («...en mi experiencia»), y entonces buscar en la metodologia cientifi ca la importancia de la investigacion no solo en trasplantes sino en medicina y ciencias de la salud. El conocimiento es la relacion entre dos objetos: el sujeto o cognoscente y el objeto o conocido. Del conocimiento se genera la ciencia, la cual tiene cuatro funciones basicas: describir las propiedades y las relaciones de los hechos que estudia, explicar la causa de los fenomenos asi como sus propiedades y relaciones, deducir de una hipotesis, ley o teoria fenomenos nuevos, y aplicar los conocimientos encontrados en benefi cio de la humanidad. Estas funciones de la ciencia le otorgan signifi cado a la realidad, y la investigacion cientifi ca es el instrumento por el que se llega al conocimiento cientifi co.5 Ademas de la autoridad, la investigacion disciplinada es una de las fuentes del conocimiento para las ciencias de la salud.

In this paper, four medical records of him were introduced, including using Modified Xiehuang Powder in treating patients with oral ulcers, using Modified Maxing Ganshi Decoction in treating children with fever, using Modified Jiaoai Decoction in treating patients with irregular menstruation, using Modified Baihu Decoction in treating patients who grind their teeth in sleep. Prescriptions of four cases which are efficient and simple, are closely linked to disease pathogenesis, so patients are healed. Although the medical records are of different treatments, clearing heat or dispelling cold, but they demonstrate that treatment in Chinese medicine should be based on syndrome differentiation, and using different medicines according to different syndromes, not rigidly adhere to a disease or a symptom.

Over 800 of these children were still being followed at adolescence allowing the characterization of several distinct wheezing phenotypes throughout childhood, as well as, those risk factors associated with the development of asthma and its persistence. Evaluating the persistence of asthma is a complex issue. There are several distinct wheezing phenotypes in childhood, which vary in prevalence and course with age. The challenge here is that the phenotypes of wheezing illness change with age; i.e. in infancy most children with wheezing illnesses are transient wheezers who will cease wheezing by age six. In contrast, by age six most children with wheeze have either persisted since infancy without apparent remission or have late onset wheeze. Both of these groups have increased rates of atopy representing dysregulated immune systems. Although its prevalence decreases substantively by early adolescence, non-atopic wheeze continues in a relevant proportion of school age children. Further, although the majority of adolescents with asthma have developed wheeze by age six, there are some who first present with asthma after this age. Thus, as children age, the meaning of wheezing transitions from most likely not being asthma in the first 3 years to most likely being asthma by late adolescence. This article will review the progression of wheezing from infancy through early adolescence and will address both changes in phenotypes as well as risk factors for both persistent and incident asthma in childhood.","inCitations":["260e74642b59e56f63dd9422f0084ba2816dcf38","5f5a5a472a91eb857b4cd11c12155df93394c9bb"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Factors predicting the persistence of asthma insights from the Tucson children’s respiratory study","doi":"10.1016/j.allerg.2005.08.006","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.allerg.2005.08.006","venue":""}

The claims state that some investors in the NYSE are financing militias in those countries to close down oilfields and ports, and buy oil before this incident occurs. By doing so, they have access to information that no one else in the market has, and make profits from this information. Using a vector autoregression (VAR) model approach to detect this phenomenon, and being inspired by the asymmetric information theory, we fail to support those claims. We tried to put this theory under investigation by running test on three oil-disruption incidents that occurred in 2013, and all of the results turned out to be insignificant. Nevertheless, this approach was able to detect a period which might involve asymmetric information in the NYSE. In addition, using a VAR model enabled us to measure the duration and magnitude of the effect of a shock in volumes of trade on oil prices in that market.","inCitations":["a4f34b914cbc005eb72384cb54ab928c4b19da9c"],"pdfUrls":["https://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/64933/1/MPRA_paper_64933.pdf"],"title":"Testing for the Presence of Asymmetric Information in the Oil Market: A VAR Approach","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}
