In the evaluation system, 3 criteria and 10 indicators are established for underground water source heat pump, 3 criteria and 8 factors for soil source heat pump, all levels of judgment matrix are constructed and precision through consistency checking. The results show that the area of underground water source heat pump suitable and suitable for the survey area with a total area of 38.99%, which mainly distributed in the fault basin, Yellow River level I - III and the large parts basin of Heping and Dingyuan that the water rich water content is better, the single well water inflow 1000 - 5000 m3/d, the mineralization degree is less than 1.0 g/L. The soil source heat pump suitable and suitable areas for 68.57% of the total area of the survey area, which mainly distributed on both sides of the Yellow River level III - IV higher-order region and the Loess Hilly transition zone, Heping and Dingyuan basin, which aeration with fine grain layer thickness is greater than 20 - 40 m, groundwater depth more than 25 m. The rest of the survey area is not suitable for the construction of shallow geothermal energy. The research results have an important guiding role for the development and utilization of shallow geothermal energy in the central urban area of Lanzhou city.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Suitability Evaluation of Shallow Geothermal Energy on Analytic Hierarchy Process—As an Example in the Central Urban Area of Lanzhou City","doi":"10.12677/ag.2016.65043","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.12677/ag.2016.65043","venue":""}

We present stability conditions for the case when individuals play unconditional cooperation, unconditional defection or conditional cooperation. We then consider the removal of one or two strategies.

In this paper, we report the details of research on the above problem. We defined the traffic transit coefficient (TTC) and traffic time-consuming index (TTCI), and then deduced formulas of for both. Based on the formulas, we designed a minimum timeconsuming path planning method and desinated it the ETC (where E represents the Elman neural network, T the traffic transit coefficient, and C the traffic timeconsuming index) path planning method. First, this method predicted the traffic flow on a road using the Elman neural network model. The TTCI of each section of the future unit time was calculated using the TTC. Finally, we used the Dijkstra algorithm to obtain the shortest path. Experiments and theoretical analysis showed that the ETC path planning method can adjust the parameters according to different road conditions. The method has high adaptability, high precision, and less time consumption. It has broad application prospects compared to the ordinary path planning algorithm in a Big Data environment.","inCitations":["0209a583c6f26aea3624ed8186c284dcf7c9a5bb","7bdab6c680a3dc00d373b0842de90f043a7dbc9d"],"pdfUrls":["https://jit.ndhu.edu.tw/article/download/1682/1690"],"title":"ETC Intelligent Navigation Path Planning Method","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Particular emphasis is placed on the measurement of the kinetics and stability using thermodesorption experiments and measurements of pressure-composition isotherms, respectively. The interface reactions in the composite reaction were analysed by in situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and by simultaneously probing D(2) desorption from NaBD(4) and H(2) desorption from MgH(2). The observed destabilisation is in quantitative agreement with the calculated thermodynamic properties, including enthalpy and entropy.

However, as the report notes the current financing structure of early care and education does not ensure equitable access to high-quality care for all children and does not adequately meet the needs of the early care and education workforce. The current financing structure supports children’s participation in early care and education through a combination of various funding streams such as federally funded Head Start programs, state and city funded public pre-kindergarten, state child care assistance programs, and tax preferences. The result is a fragmented system which leads to gaps in coverage and quality.

The determination of the resistance of the samples was done by weight loss, according to ASTM D-2017 standards. The Copper sulphate at 3.5% concentration has shown the best protection to the samples of Bambusa vulgaris and Eucalyptus urograndis, being classified as resistant against the attack of fungi Gloeophyllum trabeum and Trametes versicolor. The treatment with Sodium tribromophenate (2% and 4%) was the less efficient one in the protection of the samples of B. vulgaris against the attack of the fungus G. trabeum, being classified as moderately resistant. However, the samples of B. vulgaris treated with Sodium tribromophenate were classified as resistant against the attack of the fungus T. versicolor. The samples of E. urograndis treated with Sodium tribromophenate were classified as resistant against the attack of fungi Gloeophyllum trabeum and Trametes versicolor.

The possibilities of the model suggested for thedescription of the plastic strain localization are illustrated by several examples.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://publications.drdo.gov.in/ojs/index.php/dsj/article/download/1640/735"],"title":"Multiscale Coupled Model of Thermoelastoviscoplasticity and Damageand its Application for Modelling Metal Forming Processes","doi":"10.14429/dsj.58.1640","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.14429/dsj.58.1640","venue":""}

Reasons for this renewed interest include the simplicity, speed, and stability of the method, as well as its competitive performance on $\\ell_1$ regularized smooth optimization problems. Surprisingly, very little is known about its nonasymptotic convergence behavior on these problems. Most existing results either just prove convergence or provide asymptotic rates. We fill this gap in the literature by proving $O(1/k)$ convergence rates (where $k$ is the iteration count) for two variants of cyclic coordinate descent under an isotonicity assumption. Our analysis proceeds by comparing the objective values attained by the two variants with each other, as well as with the gradient descent algorithm. We show that the iterates generated by the cyclic coordinate descent methods remain better than those of gradient descent uniformly over time.","inCitations":["88c37d98f7e2bf1704aab378394db2fddfcf579b","e0f4889a4748f051db1a904d2dbc0b235df38394","486956c45fa19b2d0d794501ec296f607ed1eeb5","9f4d2a080c83a306b68d9ab9d7c7dc89a2a683ee","289dc059835f966bed15c09ce518c9f386d6eda8","c97e88b25eb161f96124d85af35696c6dbd1145e","5be4c06e24ae190429bfa60f5ef6ae3cd33cf0e6","7a6862979316780b226cfaab6a35b23162955276","f0f81007fa7472a83db7c641dac3925bbf0da5a4","b43753f30e2fd28e6403890c83fae765564add91","587d12517909df6c8838303f72df77f744fcfaff","1f31b45406ab9e362e0eef09accbca2fa2d7ba67","4783543ae6b2c385cae1116cb5c21a4bbbec2fd3","621c02a3919471107f69319259c7311063aad216","8dcd49ea538473ca855403c01c9a688f2a2709aa","451b36cf5ef73d5dae5db59a3e661585c86ed0ef","7bb46dc623c948b6f848125ceb044f40fee35d3c","46500cdf9b5ee58a976713e04b92569865c035c3","26885db911e8c859525591fce395d46aafb028c2","a0a0c17a3a6031aa49b303400d4275e3e5c624d5","7c3c39538e57620746ab8c80e4b58c9579855536","0637f4824bfd81f5ee6ea3ed4622e9e1b14d59d5","b3a4ccd4a2cc614318227a558ec65b2b6ae5f600","f864f95e39d125d39552655cef09f5781d7e485b","0edaa032777f39f5d736a960474b1a2c3e3e966e","25e60172a650b3e7482732d65a1f1cc179dfca65","157cfc1fb5c9b8ab08a6617d947e63a8fca74a13","00445368dbe137c07addd6ea70f348a6f2755b78","ec5ffa994c947b6eaa0e13758ea2d20d2c07c834","cf39b5550807be83de1c1ff9ba8e005ae284fc94","f28bb0f739fbc1e2ec2c5852ff0ea99c3bf742ca","8c70176a82d202cf94d94e4026f6cf2744881ec5","8a385313a796053801d7d036c85dd91dc654f96a","5c2776b8beff2a2bd998a453e3e4af46d0e180d6","70742a8a089c9e42291b3d2f039786449779a8e6","ee3a6bf1c89562e6c641c47f3c6769fb65d5e8ed","361a4d014d9dd497735ffac85da358cce1290ed9","042b6d1ec41f070102f2a95db72b69a1824f18f7","e6fd804ad1d28ca3223d1157dff5ede13b626348","8eb583954960e54ce4c17c429914087cce5bfbd8","18b4d305c4a1151e5e08061e67bf1d726d36a022","db9aac5e004485279a55b4b2896f06a9565ab179","fbf2348821f41dc14602b3c9bf37624a787d436f","26a5ea837ccefbf12ab7289b5cc31fa77957bf8c","3db1e2a309c802a85e6b31a881c2bae7deda9798","8ee535862bb2f331a57b51d66d50a76527456b1f","08036268c7bc4bd83bcff2c55eefdaaf3c082d73","6d5248226d3dc08d285c3991d8dd56105c1e628b","04f09054e30f9790fb8c198cdda1b59cb95deef8","36413d1a8190df78a9cbd4d5b304d39b6ba60f91","ced313b4d7c1776e267a7c054b8c0fab5740ff96","16aa7db5c18fc9177cbc3127c82397ead91ab5f3","135edbb6f6133203497925547dc644faf83754df","03f357cd27f939342cd44c173b82b5f0fbb14c23","2103448f9e0bc57fc2f13895456118fa721799fa","effb923a22dc5b86486c7ad57bb22684852b6203","8fa74f84e43dc811672a41db4b3724fdf590c3d5","f3fb7796781c6d7a44d1f9e525de7c32e2d9643c","5f8b409d48d08cca63ab6d5bedf769b78677b890","5d4b71408a79c6780c5e238c871d431504425195","357a3fd02903f4d27a1429b16e7f391aa49d7e66","949b7fcc9fbb5e78c57160f19db121b8cf2bc922","00715f02ba59f772f469800e25bf07e834b631a2","415dbd96f737d4b7df9bd3870d35a4b18cf721a8","c5265a4ea2e286f57312a2528c68abeb62827536","8bb069741301a5ae9080963de20d01348c890f6e","6ec33e355ce49bcbc8382f3954b8a529b3c6d341","ee42544fb9585f8649117d1ffbcebd68f50d3a4d","2a7461c9f46863a3f614bc7660d6e72d53d1f652","43d1fe40167c5f2ed010c8e06c8e008c774fd22b"],"pdfUrls":["http://dept.stat.lsa.umich.edu/~tewaria/research/saha13non-asymptotic.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1137/110840054","http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~ambuj/research/saha12non-asymptotic.pdf","http://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~ankans/Papers/ccd_journal_version.pdf"],"title":"On the Nonasymptotic Convergence of Cyclic Coordinate Descent Methods","doi":"10.1137/110840054","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1137/110840054","venue":"SIAM Journal on Optimization"}

On the other hand, two are distortions of conventional research have led to its failure: first, using a methodology of experimental designs and second, applying theories and alien to the process of teaching conceptual frameworks. This made it possible for educational research to restart their own way from her natural object: education. In this regard, it should be to differentiate between the professor who assesses and researcher who teaches. I.e. between the efficient teacher who teaches for the domain to Professor cognitive research who teaches from doubt, with attitude hermeneutic with attitude dialectical prompting methodical change of position and perspective which evaluates to find explanations to their mistakes and find change of positions. Assess is to investigate, for us this means that all educational research is an interpretation, is a qualitative evaluation of the experience which is capable of being rational, and produces new knowledge.

The test and control animals received a single 15-min exposure to cadmium (cadmium oxide) and aluminum (alumina) microparticles, respectively. The air cadmium content was 10 mg/m3, and 4 microgram of this metal was retained by the lungs of the rats. The animals were observed for 24 days. The following significant differences appeared between the control and test groups: in the cadmium exposed rats the relative lung weight (percentage of body weight) became temporarily higher; the absolute number of alveolar macrophages decreased at first and then increased; numerous polymorphonuclear and lymphocytic cells appeared in the alveoli. According to these inflammatory phenomena, at the 48th h after exposure, there was an alteration in the clearance kinetics of inhaled bacteria and an increase in the death rate of cadmium exposed animals following a test infection with Salmonella enteritidis (rats) or Pasteurella multocida (mice) aerosols.

The nanoscale precipitates were analyzed by the element mappings in scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) mode and electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) mode, which included elliptic alloy precipitates with elemental Cu, Cr, Fe and Si, except for Al, and B4C nanoparticles with polygonal shape. The interface characteristics showed that the (021) crystal plane of B4C particle and (111) crystal plane of aluminum matrix grew together. The lattice misfit was about 1.68% for (111)Al//(021)B4C.

This plumage shows yellowish brown at the trunk and white for all the tail feathers and a part of the primaries. In other words, this plumage occurs when areas, normally black for “buff columbian” plumage are replaced by white ones. Genetic analyses revealed that the gene controlling the appearance of the white area is an incompletely dominant autosomal gene. The homozygous condition for the mutant gene completely inhibits the expression of black pigmentation, leading to the replacement of black areas with pure white ones. The inhibition effect in the heterozygote however, is incomplete, resulting in the white areas (feathers) that have a slight gray tinge and many minute gray or black speckles. The mutant gene also has a weak effect in inhibiting the expression of brown color. Furthermore, when birds have the mutant gene with a wild-type genetic background for other plumage color genes, they exhibited the “red-pyle” plumage pattern. Therefore, there is a high possibility that the mutant gene expressing white areas (feathers) in the Chabo is identical to the known dominant white (I) gene, because the effect and mode of inheritance of the mutant gene possessed by the Chabo are quite similar to those of the I gene. This could be the first finding of a dominant mutant gene controlling white plumage in Japanese fancy fowls.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Genetic Analyses for the White-Tailed Character of the Chabo (Japanese Bantam)","doi":"10.2141/jpsa.43.104","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.2141/jpsa.43.104","venue":""}

Some researchers have argued that the link between disgust and fear of small animals is spurious. On the other hand, disgust may play a functional role, as might any negative emotion that is strongly stimulus-bound, in which escape or avoidance is negatively reinforced. It is therefore important to clarify whether disgust has a functional or epiphenomenal role in avoidance of feared stimuli. The present study examined the degree to which disgust motivates avoidance of spider-related stimuli using a series of behavioral avoidance tests comparing a harmless tarantula, a pen that had come in contact with the spider, and a clean pen. Peak disgust was a stronger predictor than anxiety of avoidance of both the spider and the \"contaminated\" pen.","inCitations":["68f3b351c3430867984e0d62e6ebb260a1eebd71","2dc9ee485d02f1b4f3befeee0544f7844ad047c4","15e5a2a834cffb163c7582b28a7bedb1bc3e7ef4","25ebd8ecb595efd96748d2fd95242fe83820c481","a77052939951452027da2f1636710a041a4b9ec5","7c8a8986b6605ce325dff2f7a3ad6b3ec421e79d","930aff5d38bcb7b21eb8c256236eaf5c6786b818","4ceea520acda3dfd2af056e51aa3614eaae30140","88371588df75220b2491c410961d679690297287","e142008a88e208f539f3c96890752210e32d6d7a","d97cb55af04fcf3e1085eb5f6632ddc188bfe530","1ddebbbff7c41a6571e4d9faaa08e728cf175d37","e7c87ff7993f99eb595b204350199833eeec50cb","89ddcb4b3925c54ff4363f75f3e28f38edb415f6","7da87cdb2f8629fdc6eee8f4d77b3f3ee19a63d1","e878b1c4252e08489a60cd1f63dc11a0168f4e1f","683926746c6493145d53a07f9791186b047e48fb","baf2a7619ca30704bf9bfded927628accb656fc1","693ce6df032923b7e105b65279f85c7b4f196fb7","80b7a293d2318dbf313f715d649dd1652e547b47","a4805ff28f4f79a9fdf01913ee8e62b47448fe82","f75556b5041fa10c2a683fe7c07798eb94dea89e","db4a56f8163d06077eff7d4fbb40fc6fc84fdbfa","b7284a555e3860cb24a4b8b3064ece0e60159993","69eb1ad6eb97fc81fec8102883a6837d8dcf181b","e7c1d3b9fcf1f739fc43f27af1094a9572e65248","9b74f23afb4ceccb84db24191347e29457e45d2c","fd580484a03e9e64e14a5ff88269e716664b8ed7","c5be8a8b4fd333846994701bff915a43ca898adb","bf331ef9e209472e2c57da71e6b22585c150a6b2","00ffb1e3ae21f1ea8bd09b5c13a4ebf1f36303e5","822c6818356c28caf6734f6d2fdeaa429fbac295","505def6b1c9911043c5ab00d4addccbed2df0bb5","eb08a0c282dc6e92645aaef92ac0015454b5eb97"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Disgust as a motivator of avoidance of spiders.","doi":"10.1016/j.janxdis.2004.04.002","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.janxdis.2004.04.002","venue":"Journal of anxiety disorders"}

The film stress was determined from the change in deflection curvature of the substrate after deposition and was studied as a function of different parameters: growth temperature, composition (0% ⩽ × ⩽ 60%) and annealing conditions. The stress is mostly compressive and greater than that observed in films prepared under similar deposition conditions by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). We observed an additional contribution of about 1 GPa independent of the film composition and thickness. The evolution of stress upon post-growth annealing conditions was followed. A plot of ln(σ) as a function of 1/kTa reveals a thermally activated process. All samples (0% ⩽ × ⩽ 8%) yield a similar value for the activation energy (QSR=0.1−0.3 eV). This value is considerably lower than that obtained for epitaxial films deposited by MBE or LRP-CVD. We speculate that the stress observed in IBSD layers is due to the effect of bombardment of the growing film by energetic particles. Measurements by Rutherford backscattering spectrometry show that the concentration of rare gas (xenon) incorporated in the films is too low to account for the stress. However, it is found that backscattered ions and (or) sputtered atoms that strike the growing film may have energies large enough to displace atoms and lead to compressive strain. To support this model quantitatively, computer calculations were carried out using an advanced version of the Monte Carlo transport of ions in matter, TRIM.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Stress in Si1−xGex films prepared by ion sputtering: origin and relaxation","doi":"10.1016/0040-6090(92)90064-I","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/0040-6090%2892%2990064-I","venue":""}

However, this has typically been demonstrated using explicit tasks. We investigated whether this association would be detectable using a more implicit measure-a sequential priming task. We began with a replication of the standard Maluma/Takete effect (Experiments 1a and 1b) before examining whether round and sharp nonword primes facilitated the categorization of congruent shapes (Experiment 2). We found modest evidence of a priming effect in response accuracy. We next examined whether nonword primes affected categorization of ambiguous shapes, using visual (Experiment 3) and auditory primes (Experiment 4). We found that ambiguous shapes were categorized as round (sharp) more often following the presentation of a round (sharp) nonword. This suggests that phonemes may activate related shape information which then affects the processing of shapes, and that this association emerges even when participants are not explicitly searching for it.","inCitations":["9f999ba13351d64081dc1213bb7ab824073a097f","a2c413d7bec629639677c4ffa33b9f180e51c1f8","8fc2142d4809a6215ad6a1be4c805903e76eaa00","8611f152d77567c2e560987fbe2e3a48c88b7e2b"],"pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1111/cogs.12438"],"title":"A Prime Example of the Maluma/Takete Effect?

We present a real-time tracking method that performs motion estimation of a consumer RGB-D camera with respect to an unknown environment while at the same time reconstructing this environment as a dense textured mesh. Unlike parallel tracking and mapping performed with a standard color or grey scale camera, tracking with an RGB-D camera allows a correctly scaled camera motion estimation. Therefore, there is no need for measuring the environment by any additional tool or equipping the environment by placing objects in it with known sizes. The tracking can be directly started and does not require any preliminary known and/or constrained camera motion. The colored point clouds obtained from every RGB-D image are used to create textured meshes representing the environment from a certain camera view and the real-time estimated camera motion is used to correctly align these meshes over time in order to combine them into a dense reconstruction of the environment. We quantitatively evaluated the proposed method using real image sequences of a challenging scenario and their corresponding ground truth motion obtained with a mechanical measurement arm. We also compared it to a commonly used state-of-the-art method where only the color information is used. We show the superiority of the proposed tracking in terms of accuracy, robustness and usability. We also demonstrate its usage in several Augmented Reality scenarios where the tracking allows a reliable camera motion estimation and the meshing increases the realism of the augmentations by correctly handling their occlusions.","inCitations":["26fcd81b11d1898853f9487493764c0639dc27d5","fe8e0548a914116e33786aad2d1a16489ea7bdb9","36dd940df47153dd16c2be9acb09015a919403e6","1b915a716cac0b6c733f0613cb2199dcd29087c7","f00fa3111f9f99b22c541a53f3238e363d0a38f3","e60d41b497e9032eb8f9f9e757231947927658c2","0a139afce75ec18a7aa24ea47b2f133368ec576a","7fb3adcd3022760d49af752f2ac807b48f6d0e34","b8e10f143dd9f4cda9012ed8779e3102bde5171f","220e7374a001b07dfefa1bb4d214e8ef7c2c2457","d435d58932156c5970e54cf2a327b73eb16d44f5","d268d3a7e0baf5c159402785424d08beac181d9e","4c8fa3773365ba0f43a9f5c25c6c459d9a9a233f","f18938f2df87839fb42a9d944306498bdc9cbb25","8be07562ff297c03cad0f0900f2743012cff46e5","64d42d6f60898987e838cb087787ad03fed2fdd4","9fbc2f570c40c6d346ba9db4d65be098fa2f2be5","fb4835cb068bde41842e8b33eba4a83d64c04d80","275b5091c50509cc8861e792e084ce07aa906549","db110f2ac02887c0eb76587f33879fac611c5911","7f26c615dd187ca5e4b15759d5cb23ab3ea9d9a9","3a08a804af31d91b86e4939f3cfdbcaf05f1ec95","ef0ad501b87556625e614d270ca3cc6749d8dd8f","04a704cf2428b24b3d7ef5ce61ed628a33076cdc","442a03f7575b6f85f287a2fda412259d5453f3ac","6da0d63da4b768ced5e15171f409fcc0bdca1f96","bd72d217109452d390113501daeb15db0c4f917b"],"pdfUrls":["http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/ISMAR.2011.6092380","http://campar.in.tum.de/pub/lieberknecht2011ismar/lieberknecht2011ismar.pdf","http://far.in.tum.de/pub/lieberknecht2011ismar/lieberknecht2011ismar.pdf"],"title":"RGB-D camera-based parallel tracking and meshing","doi":"10.1109/ISMAR.2011.6092380","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISMAR.2011.6092380","venue":"2011 10th IEEE International Symposium on Mixed and Augmented Reality"}

Recently there has been a renewed interest in linearized polynomials because of new connections to coding theory and finite geometry. \nWe consider the problem of calculating the rank or nullity of a linearized polynomial $L(x)=\\sum_{i=0}^{d}a_i x^{q^i}$ (where $a_i\\in \\mathbb{F}_{q^n}$) from the coefficients $a_i$.

McGuire and Sheekey defined a $d\\times d$ matrix $A_L$ with the property that $$\\mbox{nullity} (L)=\\mbox{nullity} (A_L -I).$$ We present some consequences of this result for some trinomials that split completely, i.e., trinomials $L(x)=x^{q^d}-bx^q-ax$ that have nullity $d$.

Understandably, the effect is significant for very light molecules that necessarily have large couplings between vibrational and rotational degrees of freedom. Although known, the conceptual basis of the Herman–Wallis factor are nevertheless not clearly established in the literature. Over the years, different approaches have been proposed to explain the corrections to spectral line-strengths and, recently, an experimental study has demonstrated that Q-branch Raman transitions of H 2 are highly sensitive to the theoretical model employed to determine the Herman–Wallis factor. In this paper, this fact is used to analyze the consequences on thermometry based on coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS) designed to probe H 2 molecules in combustion studies. It is found that the different Herman–Wallis factors lead to relative thermometric disagreements from several tens up to hundreds of degrees. This analysis could explain why H 2 CARS thermometry has been considered less reliable than thermometric predictions based on CARS of more common molecules such as N 2 , O 2 and others. In particular, it is remarked that unreliable expressions of Herman–Wallis factors have been used so far to interpret Q-branch H 2 CARS experiments.","inCitations":["036698e1ad83f850f80ad61416b47d5422268eb0","cbcd7309c67bbc3f94d637da3a0da51f75ffc71d","7b978326b0e6e53319e72107bd40199bce32b4c5"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Herman–Wallis factor to improve thermometric accuracy of vibrational coherent anti-Stokes Raman spectra of H2","doi":"10.1016/j.proci.2008.06.045","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.proci.2008.06.045","venue":""}

In this study, surface water storage (SWS) variations are estimated at monthly time-scale over 15 years (1993–2007) using a hypsographic approach based on the combination of topographic information from Advance Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) and Hydrological Modeling and Analysis Platform (HyMAP)-based Global Digital Elevation Models (GDEM) and the Global Inundation Extent Multi-Satellite (GIEMS) product in the Ganges-Brahmaputra basin. The monthly variations of the surface water storage are in good accordance with precipitation from Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP), river discharges at the outlet of the Ganges and the Brahmaputra, and terrestrial water storage (TWS) from the Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment (GRACE), with correlations higher than 0.85. Surface water storage presents a strong seasonal signal (~496 km3 estimated by GIEMS/ASTER and ~378 km3 by GIEMS/HyMAPs), representing ~51% and ~41% respectively of the total water storage signal and it exhibits a large inter-annual variability with strong negative anomalies during the drought-like conditions of 1994 or strong positive anomalies such as in 1998. This new dataset of SWS is a new, highly valuable source of information for hydrological and climate modeling studies of the Ganges-Brahmaputra river basin.","inCitations":["666cb3e583e49628d1984620c30c0325d4ca0acd","58b3e84f276ab8a7799f9e1eeedfc3cc3bb20583","cc03f8dddb6ec44243a157bff49df13c10b0ee2e"],"pdfUrls":["https://horizon.documentation.ird.fr/exl-doc/pleins_textes/divers17-10/010070351.pdf","http://www.mdpi.com/2073-4441/9/4/245/pdf"],"title":"Fifteen Years (1993–2007) of Surface Freshwater Storage Variability in the Ganges-Brahmaputra River Basin Using Multi-Satellite Observations","doi":"10.3390/w9040245","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.3390/w9040245","venue":""}

Two disease-specific clinical prediction tools have been developed, the Bronchiectasis Severity Index (BSI) and the FACED score, both of which stratify patients into severity risk categories to predict the probability of mortality.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe aimed to compare the predictive utility of BSI and FACED in assessing clinically relevant disease outcomes across seven European cohorts independent of their original validation studies.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe combined cohorts totalled 1612. Pooled analysis showed that both scores had a good discriminatory predictive value for mortality (pooled area under the curve (AUC) 0.76, 95% CI 0.74 to 0.78 for both scores) with the BSI demonstrating a higher sensitivity (65% vs 28%) but lower specificity (70% vs 93%) compared with the FACED score. Calibration analysis suggested that the BSI performed consistently well across all cohorts, while FACED consistently overestimated mortality in 'severe' patients (pooled OR 0.33 (0.23 to 0.48), p<0.0001). The BSI accurately predicted hospitalisations (pooled AUC 0.82, 95% CI 0.78 to 0.84), exacerbations, quality of life (QoL) and respiratory symptoms across all risk categories. FACED had poor discrimination for hospital admissions (pooled AUC 0.65, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.67) with low sensitivity at 16% and did not consistently predict future risk of exacerbations, QoL or respiratory symptoms. No association was observed with FACED and 6 min walk distance (6MWD) or lung function decline.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe BSI accurately predicts mortality, hospital admissions, exacerbations, QoL, respiratory symptoms, 6MWD and lung function decline in bronchiectasis, providing a clinically relevant evaluation of disease severity.","inCitations":["10eab11d763dc9a8a60ece874c188063ab8619cd","e8bc5fa8bef3cd3515abf0e8b6d50d062b9b0d1a","04b05f73b97b853a1ebb69b840ce8c5b62ecf7b8","0ee6aa6b4c33f9c90f5dd67ae0382b3b866797bc","a2b57e49bdbd2a7c6ec0a0268d36c104669fdce7","f480c9f36bc15f1e8c8802ceacf09694d485136b","6e495b85a6326fe106bca27a6a51a0b5712ea982","2dde77f935d401798c0d4e25802212c662c2c9fb","56ea8fbc5b6a29f7c94b31f35d450c98cc42e652","50c9b4387745cd195b2347c2a864a3f6bd94e3b6","1eb0935ee298013272017c385d4b492e70f6ea94","1d6d0bc8a760d6f78480d7369453d6f7274872f0","b34e8a839030550cccb1d5bd25c8fdeb9206b24f","1c5f019d813d2357bc85fb94b3c44b7ed84cc2cb","e3a932a70dd00896061981a41c4b5961933117bc","15cab6637ee5071b6a4c5dcdf3c64c686eb9337a","26a8e07edd23e9f5e46b114e4d5cfebc0036fb1c","989e5ea18ffc520931e7850f828f1998f80f6434","7cc5098293ece9c829b3abff5a8412e352f2b6e2","83729aaa9c50ccd38a1875ef9e0ba705e28b40a3","3a6c1cd6c335fd7637560f3a94e260e34932c262","a15610dd1408a5ab3975362d1d838fd6d1136192","6890403a2650f14c46045c9bedc45e296e9605d8","f8aa3eca930684a850dc6344a3eb1d30fbcdea9d","f6dbe43ff60513b14eeee36e402fb3707142a2ba","4fa0936df5a2385d3690f8030756aa6031f54f7e","c0878e490a240f70c446eb57dedbbb21abd79077","cfd905d87ccb08973d1db7350e8e6c8aef38a784","8f0671d88c7a18c4589f4375a2af6883dea7be22","b17b6f1f22dcd89765ce0168863d049d9e491538","841597e64cb92aaf1f0f473fa9b3800bb1d7d283","1b5b001afc761c35074f089c7db7b54de714058c","bb19630831d7a2627799079f81b1715dfa1a5cb2","f7eb70d7f784a2e897e9a40520a2e0d0d2e8daa9","7b58fa1414d64378d195369b7d9f6e3a41a53049","9936b20cc49317f605c3bd77bae775ea78f57299","a59a8f81a867ef9d0c95a6b941637bf83555b4ab","280a802954f23a4a8b43203aa8eec5b7b5baa921","7b17da77d49557c1cac9f4296eb36b8410431dbd","778b235f6de01e2b19b5afdc9417e73ec9b44c4e","5932728666a8feab0de87f357ecc9e45b1a3a5cf","4f2c376ff4b9f92b2c129e56948b977d7b6d963b","7aafee5c61ac7c4d37384d25ee086f2a5672a6a7","1955a6be7f116dd051afe31829cb05feb1483e17"],"pdfUrls":["http://thorax.bmj.com/content/thoraxjnl/71/12/1110.full.pdf","http://www2.mf.uns.ac.rs/userfiles/File/Akreditacija%20-%20nova%20stranica/Nasi%20u%20WOS-u%202016do15jan2017-1.pdf","https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/pmc/oa_pdf/37/9d/thoraxjnl-2016-208481.PMC5136700.pdf","https://eprint.ncl.ac.uk/file_store/production/227361/9083C9DE-EFE8-4254-9FD6-1156F15F3A97.pdf"],"title":"Multidimensional severity assessment in bronchiectasis: an analysis of seven European cohorts","doi":"10.1136/thoraxjnl-2016-208481","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1136/thoraxjnl-2016-208481","venue":"Thorax"}

At the end, an improvement of the regularity of the solution is derived for the same set of parameters previously considered.","inCitations":["486d4daac6ff4b4fd90f18dfbb08e07baac566a2","30259204ff3162d8c9e1076ca3c257b069f72ccf","9976c84b3390099aeed004474e38cb8247ee93d5","1e27fc4b26808c294b23069090379f97736f2930","1ff9989d3da0ae3be215c7df7719558816ae11f9","af083ffa16f2e5c63d0102934ce9ce9b4ee930c9","428f7b2752fb08c46b1dfa27df7d21c1a82ebf15","a28b11e369f6f2aa1faca5eae27a87bd772c577a"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"The impedance boundary-value problem of diffraction by a strip","doi":"10.1016/j.jmaa.2007.04.037","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmaa.2007.04.037","venue":""}

If the judgments are \"substantially different\" then that likely signals different models being employed by the agents. As a result, if the experts’ judgments are disparate, then it is unlikely that the judgments should be combined. However, developers of multiple agent systems have combined substantially different judgments by averaging. Such a combination is likely to provide a composite judgment that is inconsistent with each individual judgment. An important aspect of verification and validation of multiple agent systems is the analysis of the combination of such judgments. Thus, a critical issue in multiple agent systems is determining whether or not the judgments of the experts are similar or disparate. As a result, the purpose of this paper is to investigate the combination of probability judgments in multiple agent systems. Traditional statistics are used to investigate whether or not different judgments are substantially different. In addition, a new approach is developed to determine if probability distributions of agents are similar enough to combine or disparate enough to treat separately. A case study is used to illustrate the problems of combining multiple agent systems and to demonstrate the new approach.","inCitations":["db32623000006b7e1d1d61a44e2f1dbb39a7aa9b"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.aaai.org/Papers/Workshops/1993/WS-93-05/WS93-05-004.pdf"],"title":"Verification and Validation of Multiple Agent Systems: Combining Agent Probabilistic Judgments","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

The minimum number of holes (0.80 per grain) made by pulse beetle was recorded in grains of Punjab-91 compared to the maximum of 1.77 holes per grain in Paidar-91. The maximum number of eggs (3.12 per grain) of pulse beetle was observed in Paidar- 91 and the minimum eggs (0.48 per grain) were recorded in Dasht. The adults of pulse beetle fed on Paidar-91 gained the maximum weight (10.27 mg) while the minimum weight of 7.02 mg was recorded for adults fed on grains of Bittle-98. The minimum grain damage (24.35%) was recorded in Bittle-98 while the maximum of 54.46% damage was seen in Flip 97-192C. The minimum grain weight loss of 25.66% was recorded for Dasht compared to the maximum weight loss (39.48%) in CM-2000. The minimum adults (2.96) of pulse beetle were attracted towards Parbat grains and the maximum of 5.07 adults were recorded in grains of Flip 97-192C. Chickpea cultivars of Punjab-91, Dasht, Bittle-98 and Parbat were resistant against pulse beetle while Paidar-91 and Flip 97-192C were found susceptible.","inCitations":["a3207502690aa78bb9ce20180aca0b082dc6c232","f2784759ed5fe766d69bbb88dc34f393ee415d7f","a18093a6fdbade70181d5c374bd6ce03478515f0","5f3d59d8d9c78b90245623fe28fb97b563810b28","90158fc9e9178b932b6a27408a630ad309cfbecb","cde07078762597f8369422a1c16ff50f7cc08d4b","e580b62ec59d13c9a37600e3440f9be11a512a0d","86c8b4bb67187caf653a3d3dfe2f261f7d6414e3","0b21aaf84d8bcbc88e2086eff27cf40c0624c7c4","8fcfc7cfd27c51b5c84c8bf40724958d50289439","fbf30840b5a554be775bbd1284d9b65552937530","f272506c58b24825a2eb554e2db64e8c5132bc44","fbaeef67d9014d21ca5d96feb12d752baf921d78","7697a664e7a7d942608907c8ab751cacdd3d6a78","064cd53d93411387cd6ad5bbe8ae6ccdffa99085","26f5a32b7fb847625d02c77dd9c4f87292240e85","5a86d030511d54167fa82c14fcf617de67095198","a3e8943e811c850a168b3d5155c35a9ad7877f6d","ba4649cf5fdc9c18a7e399dd7128de122322291a","f011f2c4d7895a8f09796ebf68f6826ea7119612","fd7a295bf468ed2b1082b8aed32be1b9fdbd6e9c","9887015608da3505b9f90790e3fb5c39105cf9f1","140c8b0a0c50261c791537fdfddad68bcf8cfd8f","d467106759a8620c26c5eaf02b2d6817bd7acc73","56bdfd5fbc5d14a906e4a4fdf85ccdab5bd6fd90","8d4d75883b599d1941bd58cb96261c56561fac4b","5243fc1d24cbf8069669503072d3d66e1fca94ec"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Resistance of Chickpea (cicer Arietinum L.)

We have also sorted various numbers of antigen-specific CD8+ T cells into 96-well plates to demonstrate these T cells are capable of expanding into nearly pure CD8+ T cell lines. Our approach has the advantage of sorting antigen-specific T cells without knowing their specific antigenic epitopes or restricting HLA.

We previously showed that a 12-day in vitro follicle culture supports normal imprinting establishment in mouse oocytes. The aim of the present study was to assess whether a shortened in vitro follicle growth (8 days culture compared to 12 days, as a model for human IVM) or pre-ovulatory intrafollicular oocyte ‘aging’ in culture (14 days culture) leads to imprinting mutations in oocytes. Limiting dilution bisulphite sequencing showed that shortened in vitro follicle growth (8 days) does not induce oocyte epimutations at the imprinted Snrpn and Mest genes. In contrast, extension of oocyte residence in large unluteinized follicles in vitro was associated with a low level (one out of 54 alleles) of epimutations for Mest, but not for Snrpn. The latter condition may occur during controlled ovarian stimulation where the oocyte growth phase may be extended for several days. Furthermore, we studied the dynamics during follicle culture of transcript levels for genes previously shown to be essential for imprinting establishment in oocytes: Dnmt3a, Dnmt3L and Zfp57. Oocyte total mRNA levels during in vitro follicle culture showed the timely shutdown in transcription at the antral follicle stage and total mRNA levels were comparable to in vivo grown eCG-stimulated oocytes.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Dynamics of imprinted DNA methylation and gene transcription for imprinting establishment in mouse oocytes in relation to culture duration variability 1 Short title: Imprinting in oocytes related to culture duration","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

They serve as targets for drug development against cancers, diabetes and depression. Several DUSPs have non‐canonical conformation of the central &bgr;‐sheet and active site loops, suggesting that they may have conformational switch that is related to the regulation of enzyme activity. Here, we determined the crystal structure of DUSP13a, and identified two different structures that represent intermediates of the postulated conformational switch. Amino acid sequence of DUSP13a is not significantly homologous to DUSPs with conformational switch, indicating that the conformational switch is not sequence‐dependent, but rather determined by ligand interaction. The sequence‐independency suggests that other DUSPs with canonical conformation may have the conformational switch during specific cellular regulation. The conformational switch leads to significant changes in the protein surface, including a hydrophobic surface and pockets, which can be exploited for development of allosteric modulators of drug target DUSPs.

In general, it is necessary to impose a known heat flow with a suitable profile to reliably estimate the parameters. This is demonstrated with test cell measurements taken before and after changes were made to the test cell. The eventual goal of this project is to develop a practical methodology to determine long-term retrofit performance from short-term tests.","inCitations":["08fb298455379f39275961a62a8c1bc017b4c1b4","faf44c71f07d40acce60c23ea0a8ec809f385391"],"pdfUrls":["https://www.nrel.gov/docs/legosti/old/2639.pdf"],"title":"Short-term measurements for the determination of envelope retrofit performance","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Material balances on the sediment and overlying water yielded two ordinary differential equations for the contaminant levels in each of these compartments. Integration of the model equations simulated the transient concentration in each compartment. The influence of a cap layer on the attenuation of contaminant release was also modeled. The model was verified by experimental data on a laboratory column in which gas was introduced at a steady rate into sediments. The model was used to calculate the contaminant flux into the air for both capped and uncapped sediment under simulated field conditions. It was also used to investigate the effect of total suspended sediment (TSS), gas flux, and sand cap on the contaminant flux into the air. In an uncapped sediment, the resuspension of sediment and associated contaminants dominated the flux, while in capped sediment, where direct resuspension was eliminate...","inCitations":["2e0a4e9616e2d2b21fe1537e354eb100a3d1c62a","cae5f676d7e8f3c126d79689122a6302a453e536","7883ba75442de4a8bfb2e6ee041c77b3e2e034b1","b6f5e8396acf79b8d649eabdb5f316b534fe62dc","341d1d6eed5596bc936b1c4a21db06ec9e81ad15"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"A model for contaminant and sediment transport via gas ebullition through a sediment cap.","doi":"10.1089/ees.2008.0269","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1089/ees.2008.0269","venue":""}
