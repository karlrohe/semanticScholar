When an insurgency (i.e., non-state actor) challenges a host nation (i.e., state actor), often an external counterinsurgent force intervenes. While researchers have categorized insurgencies with social science techniques and United States Army doctrine has established possible counterinsurgency strategies, little research prescribes host nation and counterinsurgent force strength. To this end, we develop a mixed-integer program to provide an estimate of the number of forces required to maximize the probability of a favorable resolution to the counterinsurgent and host nation countries, while minimizing unfavorable resolutions and the number of counterinsurgent deaths. This program integrates: (i) a multivariate piecewise-linear regression model to estimate the number of counterinsurgent deaths each year and (ii) a logistic regression model to estimate the probability of four types of conflict resolution over a 15-year time horizon. Constraints in the model characterize: (i) upper and lower limits on the number of counterinsurgent and host nation forces and their annual rates of increase and decrease, (ii) the characteristics of the type of counterinsurgency, (iii) an estimation of the number of counterinsurgent deaths, and (iv) an estimation of the probability of one of four resolutions. We use Somalia as a case study to estimate how counterinsurgent strategies affect the probability of obtaining each conflict resolution. We conclude that a strategy focusing on building and empowering a stable host nation force provides the highest probability of achieving a positive resolution to the counterinsurgency. Senior leaders can use this information to guide strategic decisions within a counterinsurgency.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Combining regression and mixed-integer programming to model counterinsurgency","doi":"10.1007/s10479-019-03420-x","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10479-019-03420-x","venue":""}

Stratospheric particles were collected by impaction techniques on specially treated substrates. For the first time, Nitron- nitrate reaction spots were detected on the ice crystal replicas, indicating the presence of NO 3 - ions on/in ice. Because the reaction spots were detected only on very small crystals (r<1 μm) and never on larger crystals, suggest that the amount of NO 3 - coating sufficient to initiate reactions will accumulate during ice crystal evaporation in ice subsaturated air. This may slow down the evaporation rate and enable ice crystals to survive longer in subsaturated environment. That provides an explanation of why on both days ice crystals were replicated at temperatures above the frost point, when their appearance and size suggest substantial evaporation.","inCitations":["daac820c7fab0e2d548165b47de8276fd10563f0","337a49d0e1c7b1dafeacd2cad1fb8fdb7ff459fd","0fb41fb011241e8cc254fe08f3863835d474f264","9052d459296e489fd1cee8caa3f5535084693b90","5efc5612a486bfb6755a99a1a40290e11f305625","2d328517b1feb0ffc171b52ccfc3d91b0c3c12fa","d798f936b8bc74a8682dbf95aab0f75db63b60a6"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"New evidence of size and composition of polar stratospheric cloud particles","doi":"10.1029/97GL00256","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1029/97GL00256","venue":""}

Due to poverty and illiteracy, ost of the patient come to the hospital in later stage. smoking and indoor pollution is major problem in urban and rural community of Nepal. This study was to find out the epidemiology and prevalence of lung cancer in community. Methods:A case-control study involving interviews and clinical reports with 764 patients with lung cancer and 795 population-based controls was conducted in different part of Nepal, where mortality rates are high among men and women Results: Cigarette smoking was found to be the principal cause of lung cancer in this population, accounting for 55% of the lung cancers in males and 37% in females. The attributable risk percentage among females is high compared to elsewhere in Nepal, largely because of a higher prevalence of smoking with local made alcohol among women and poor nutrition diet. After adjustment for smoking, there were also significant increases in lung-cancer risk associated with several measures of exposure to air pollutants. Risks were twice as high among those who reported smoky outdoor environments, and increased in proportion to years of sleeping on beds heated by coal-burning stoves (chulo), and to an overall index of indoor air pollution. Threefold increase in lung cancer risk was found among men industrial occupation. The associations with both smoking and indoor air-pollution were stronger for squamous cell and small cell carcinomas than for adenocarcinoma of the lung. The patient intakes mostly smoked food and having poor vegetables and fruits regularly.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82195581.pdf"],"title":"Genetic polymorphisms of metabolizing enzymes involved in detoxification of tobacco carcinogens and matrix metalloproteinase-1 in relation to lung cancer in Northern Thailand: P1-033","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

There is currently limited evidence of how such aggressive behaviours, including physical and verbal aggression, influence support worker’ wellbeing levels, or how care organisations can mitigate the detrimental impacts of challenging behaviours on staff wellbeing. The current study explores the relationship between client-on-staff aggression and support worker wellbeing, and whether prohibitive voice and social support influence this relationship. An online survey was conducted among 225 support workers from a New Zealand care organisation. Moderated multiple regressions were conducted to test hypotheses followed. The results show that clienton-staff aggression is negatively associated with wellbeing, and that social support, but especially prohibitive voice, have positive impacts on support worker wellbeing. Furthermore, the findings also suggest, while the interactions hypothesized were not significant, the joint effects of prohibitive voice and social support uniquely explain the relationship between clienton-staff aggression and wellbeing.

Such footwall erosion is predicted by the domino model of extension, in which rigid fault-blocks rotate as extension proceeds. Profiles of three North Sea fields (Snorre, Brent and Heather) are analysed to estimate the amount of uplift that accompanied Late Jurassic normal faulting, and these estimates are compared with the footwall uplift predicted by the domino model. Agreement between observed and predicted uplift is excellent, varying from >1 km at Snorre to c . 100 m at Heather. For a given amount of extension, large fault-blocks tend to be bounded by large faults and to show a greater degree of erosion. The Brent Province of the northern North Sea is an area of prolific hydrocarbon discoveries. Almost all of the major oil-fields occur in tilted fault-blocks which were formed by Late Jurassic extension and subsequently buried by Cretaceous-Tertiary thermal subsidence (Badley et al. 1988; Marsden et al. 1990). The crests of the tilted blocks are typically eroded or degraded, with varying amounts of Middle-Lower Jurassic and Upper Triassic section removed. This footwall erosion is commonly ascribed in the literature to pre-rifting doming (Ziegler 1982), heterogeneous stretching (Coward 1986), local transpression (Beach 1985) or even regional compression (Frost 1987). The purpose of this paper is to show that the uplift and degradation is a direct consequence of the Late Jurassic normal faulting and fault-block rotation.

During this period, 7,648 infants were transported including 3,301 newborns of more than 36 weeks of gestational age and less than 72 hours of life. These neonates came from 73 different hospitals. Among these 3,301 infants, 237 neonates (124 boys and 113 girls) with anoxic-ischemic encephalopathy related to asphyxia were selected in the present study. Inclusion criteria were association of one obligatory criterion of fetal distress during delivery and at least one criterion of neonatal asphyxia or one criterion of anoxic-ischemic encephalopathy. Data were compiled and analyzed with Epidata package and Epi info package, respectively.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThese 237 neonates with anoxic-ischemic represented 12% of MICU activity at the same gestational and postnatal ages. The mean gestational age was 39.5 + 1.5 weeks. The mean birth weight was 3,188 + 559 g. More than 50% of these neonates were born in level I maternities. Fifty-three percent of the infants were born by caesarean section. Eighty-three percent of the neonates had an Apgar score at 1 minute <3. Eighty-eight percent of the neonates received resuscitation care at 5 minutes of life and 34% of these had an Apgar score at 10 minutes <5. In 50% of the cases, the MICUs arrived at the maternity of delivery within 1 h 45 min of life and transportation of the neonates was completed after 3 hours of life. The neonates were transported to an intensive care unit in 88% of the cases (half to a polyvalent intensive care unit and half to a neonatal intensive care unit). Forty-four percent of transported neonates had no encephalopathy, 30% had a severe encephalopathy or seizures, 27% had multiple organ failure. Mortality reached 28% and encephalopathy accounted for two thirds of these deaths. Neonates who arrived in pediatric care units after 3 hours of life had more severe morbidity than neonates who arrived before 3 hours of life.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nPediatric MICUs transport the most severely affected neonates. The initial clinical state is critical, and systemic and neurological complications are frequent and severe. Calls to the MICU should be made earlier in order to enable a better impact of new neuroprotective strategies.","inCitations":["5962e8c9214923c358fcc205c515a31567aebde5","dec5ebc4bd59d354269d31515dd68545a22a5b9b","ed0ed76236ca4d3d0a65e0e53580dab8179936df"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"[Newborn asphyxia at term during delivery].","doi":"","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"Journal de gynecologie, obstetrique et biologie de la reproduction"}

In such cases the primary intension cannot be univocally mapped in one and only one indexical world, thus standard two-dimensional semantics cannot efficiently address the problems presented. Subsequently, a modified model is presented which leads these problems to be averted in the replicated cases. This modified model admits primary intensions that are not univocally mapped. The conclusion discusses the advantages and disadvantages of the modified model and analyzes its possible consequences for the philosophy of mind.Keywords: two-dimensional semantics, primary intensions, philosophical zombies, epistemically indistinguishable(ProQuest: ... denotes formulae omitted.)1. IntroductionHow should one account for the linguistic use of phrases such as, \"Russia might not have been the largest country in the world,\" even when the largest country in the world is Russia? We cannot say that the quote means Russia might not have been Russia. However, it does have a meaning. As many philosophers would agree, the statement roughly indicates that the object we refer to when we speak of Russia is an object of this world, which, when considered counterfactually - as all the things it could have been in other possible worlds - might not have been the largest country in at least one of these worlds. One of the main formalizations of the solution to this dilemma is known as two-dimensional semantics. We say that Russia has a twodimensional meaning. One is the function which maps \"Russia\" in our world - the indexical world, the world to which we belong - called primary intension; one is the class of functions which maps \"Russia\" in all other possible worlds, called secondary intension.Secondary intensions may appear as improbable ideas. Accordingly, some would find the notion that something belongs to other possible worlds imaginative; useful in fiction but not in philosophy. Conversely, primary intensions always appeared much better behaved, since we ought to have the right to make expressions about our own world. Primary intensions, however, are arrogant foes indeed. Under what grounds would we have the right to isolate only one world and then map entities on only this particular world? We would indeed have to possess extremely fine grained information about our placement in the vast realm of possible worlds.1 If we cannot have all the relevant knowledge which would be true in one and only one possible world, how can we single out only one of them as indexical? We must ascribe indexicality to all the worlds in which what is both believed and true would in fact obtain, that is be true. But if, behaving humbly, we do so, then how can the primary intension be just one function and not a class of functions on all the worlds that could be indexical?Enquiring more generally, how can we presume that we can speak of one indexical world and select an object in that world in a univocal fashion? Who gave us the power to choose the indexical world from among all the other epistemically indistinguishable worlds? Who filled us with the necessary divinity to track the untraceable and find the identical hay in the haystack? Can we subscribe to a more humble theory of primary intensions and continue to account properly for counterfactuals? After a brief introduction to standard two-dimensional semantics, a problem case will be presented in which these enquiries will be enacted, revealing faults with this standard model. A modified model where those faults do not arise will be introduced and its consequences for David Chalmer's arguments against physicalism will be explored.2. Two-Dimensional SemanticsIn Chalmers (2006),2 two-dimensional semantics is summarized as the concept whereby meanings are intensions divided into two dimensions. One is a function mapping entities in our world (primary intension) and one is a class of functions mapping these same entities on other worlds (secondary intension). …","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Humble Primary Intensions: Fixing Two-Dimensional Semantics","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

It is unknown whether this extensive stroma promotes or prevents tumor growth. In this thesis project, I attempted to elucidate the interactions between pancreatic cancer cells and fibroblasts, a major cell type in the stroma, using an in vitro co-culture model. I co-cultured CFPAC-1 pancreatic cancer cells and Hs 343.T fibroblasts, sorted them by flow cytometry, measured their gene expression, and inferred molecular intercellular interactions due to co-culture. Analysis revealed abundant changes in the gene expression in fibroblasts that were co-cultured with pancreatic cancer cells. These involve pathways such as ECM, TGF-β, Ras/PDGFR, HIF-1-α, Notch, and Rho GTPases. I also identified many factors produced by cancer cells that can potentially induce the expression changes observed in co-cultured fibroblasts. This study offers a simplified approach to begin dissecting the complexity of PDAC stroma. ii Acknowledgements This thesis project has been a remarkable scientific experience. It would not be possible without the generous and strong support of many individuals.

Methods: Irradiations were performed using 6 MV beams of a Varian Trilogy linear accelerator with an aS1000 EPID.Images were acquired using 360 MU irradiations at 600 MU/min in cine acquisition mode at 2 Hz frame‐rate. To establish the gantry isocentre, a Winston‐Lutz technique was used with a circular collimator rigidly attached to the gantry head. The displacement of the centre of a fixed tungsten ball at isocentre from the field centre was determined on each image with a sub‐pixel thresholding technique. EPID coordinates were transformed to room coordinates. Jaw and MLC sag relative to the gantry head were determined from the displacement of a gantry‐mounted tungsten ball relative to static jaw and MLC positions. MLC speed constancy was determined by segmenting MLC positions on each image for a constant leaf‐speed test pattern. Gantry speed constancy was assessed with an independent liquid‐based inclinometer and the linac gantry angle potentiometer. Results: The gantry isocentre was ∼ 1 mm amplitude with changes in isocentre occuring over time suggesting frequent measurement is required. Jaw sag was found to be very small ∼ 0.2 mm amplitude, with MLC sag ∼ 0.6 mm. Average leaf speed was found to be consistent for the MLC leaves however the variation in speed varied systematically across the leaf bank which requires further investigation. Gantry speed was consistent although the inclinometer was found to lag ∼ 2 degrees in reading from the potentiometer. Conclusions: The cine‐EPID based method quantifies the mechanical motioncharacteristics of the linac as a function of gantry angle during arc‐therapy with improved precision and efficiency of quality assurance over previous methods.

The driving force is to give a feeling for the philosophical problems facing those that build mathematical models from data. Special attention will be given to grey-box approaches in nonlinear system identification.

PAX6 represents a universal master control gene for eye morphogenesis and in cattle PAX6 has been shown to be essential for eye development and for tissue-specific gene expression within the eye (Jaworski et al., 1997). Various known mutations in the PAX6 homologs of man and mouse cause different congenital ocular disorders. Mouse Pax6 heterozygous mutants have small eyes, whereas homozygous mutants have only remnants of ocular tissues (Graw, 2003). In humans PAX6 mutations mainly cause aniridia and less commonly cause isolated cataracts (OMIM 607108). The human PAX6 gene consists of 14 exons spanning about 21.3 kb and has been mapped on human chromosome (HSA) 11p13 (Glaser et al., 1992). A considerable number of the sporadic aniridia cases in man have large chromosomal deletions in 11p13 detectable by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis, and some are also visible with conventional cytogenetic banding (van Heyningen and Williamson, 2002). Because of the possible involvement of PAX6 in bovine congenital ocular diseases (OMIA 0049/0050; Nicolas, 2003) we have started to clone the PAX6 gene in cattle. This report describes the identification and mapping of a PAX6 BAC clone which provides a basis for cytogenetic studies of possible chromosomal deletions that may occur in bovine anopthalmia/ micropthalmia. We report here the assignment of the bovine PAX6 gene to BTA15q25→q27 by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and radiation hybrid (RH) mapping. This location is consistent with known conservation of synteny between cattle, human and mouse genomes (Hayes et al., 2003).","inCitations":["2ae3128a212fa5b6d30580030e0e831b0601e391"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Assignment of the PAX6 gene to bovine chromosome 15q25→q27 by fluorescence in situ hybridization and confirmation by radiation hybrid mapping","doi":"10.1159/000084220","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1159/000084220","venue":"Cytogenetic and Genome Research"}

We employed a modified Varian Gen II MBE system using H 2 O 2 as an oxidant. ZnO layers with thickness from 100 to 600 nm were grown on (0001)-sapphire using an MgO buffer. The surface morphology of the samples was studied by atomic force microscopy (AFM), optical microscopy with Nomarski contrast and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The crystalline quality of the layers was investigated using X-ray diffractometry (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Optical properties of the ZnO layers were studied by photoluminescence (PL). The surface roughness (rms) measured by AFM for the best layers is about 0.2nm. The formation of hexagonal ZnO pyramids was also observed in some cases. XRD measurements of the obtained ZnO layers show the excellent quality of the single crystalline ZnO heteroepitaxially grown on sapphire. The FWHM of the XRD (0002) rocking curve measured for our best layers is as low as 27 arcsec.The influence of growth parameters on structural properties as well as on surface morphology of the zinc oxide layers on sapphire is investigated and discussed. High-quality ZnO-on-sapphire epiwafers with a very good lateral uniformity revealed both by XRD and PL measurements could provide an alternative to bulk ZnO wafers.","inCitations":["cb39521cef29786420a10edc6b9bfeb045707955","ff1fd99bea1f2b2314ffa860983456555ab76458","416839bc8c3aa7f508c70ac82e1a0a9fcc0c7dee","32e611bbb53a2b4f0789f880d00ccf5d16124b5e","e480fd8b239c8b2e2c0f7437ce492c855be55c65"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"MBE growth of ZnO layers on sapphire employing hydrogen peroxide as an oxidant","doi":"10.1016/j.jcrysgro.2005.10.033","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcrysgro.2005.10.033","venue":""}

Numerous studies have shown the efficacy of different vaccines to protect individuals from various diseases. However, some parents choose not to vaccinate their children for reasons such as, among others, doubts regarding their usefulness, concerns over safety or efficacy, etc. Physicians are known to exert a direct influence on immunization rates by answering questions and clarifying misconceptions. Yet, it is unknown how they immunize their own children.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nWe sought to assess how physicians interested in vaccination issues immunized, or would immunize, their own children.\n\n\nDESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS\nAn 11-question, Web-based survey with a total of 102 discrete answers was sent to 2070 Swiss physicians in October 2004. All physicians were subscribers to a nonprofit, Web-based expert network (InfoVac, www.infovac.ch) that distributes monthly newsletters and answers question within 2 days on immunization issues. The InfoVac network reaches > 95% of pediatricians in Switzerland but < 20% of general practitioners. All responses were anonymous, and no identifier could be used to trace the participants of the survey. Questions were divided into 2 parts: (1) physicians who were parents were asked which vaccines they gave to their own children and at what age, and (2) all physicians were asked which vaccines they would give to their own child and at what age if they had a newborn child in 2004. Vaccines available in Switzerland at the time of the survey were offered as possible replies, and recommended vaccines were considered as those noted in the Swiss federal immunization schedule issued yearly. One question compared their immunization practice between their own children and their patients. Sociodemographics, qualifying year, membership in different professional groups, and their type of practice were also requested. Statistics. Standard descriptive statistics were used for sociodemographic characteristics. Univariate statistical analyses were performed for each variable to determine its relationship to the dependent variable, being a pediatrician or nonpediatrician. Logistic-regression analysis was used to calculate the adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs), controlling for any statistically significant demographic variables that might function as confounders (gender, parenthood, workplace, year of diploma, and type of practice). For all statistical tests, differences were considered significant at P < .05.\n\n\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURE\nWe performed a comparison of past and projected immunization rates in the children of pediatricians and nonpediatricians.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOne thousand seventeen valid questionnaires were received (response rate: 49.1%; pediatricians: 53.3%). Nine hundred fifteen physicians (90%) had > or = 1 child. All physicians reported immunizing children in their practice. Pediatricians were more likely to be women and to work in private practice than nonpediatricians but less likely to belong to a self-reported alternative medicine association. Among the nonpediatricians, 317 were general practitioners, 144 were internists, and 95 were other specialists. Ninety-two percent of pediatricians followed the official immunization recommendations for their own children. In contrast, after controlling for gender, workplace, type of practice, and year of diploma, nonpediatricians were more likely not to have immunized their children against measles, mumps, hepatitis B, or Haemophilus influenzae type b. They more frequently postponed diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP) (OR: 4.5; 95% CI: 2.0-10.19) and measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccination. Although projected immunization rates were higher than effective rates, 10% of nonpediatricians would still not follow the official immunization recommendations in 2004. They would more frequently refrain from using combination vaccines and postpone DTP and MMR immunization to later in life. Several comparisons confirmed the weaker use of the more recently licensed vaccines by nonpediatricians. In addition to vaccines currently recommended in Switzerland, both groups of physicians added hepatitis A, influenza, and varicella vaccines to the vaccination schedule of their own children. Pediatricians were more likely to give pneumococcal (OR: 2.26; 95% CI: 1.004-4.68) and meningococcal C (OR: 2.26; 95% CI: 1.62-3.17) vaccines to their own children. In contrast, they were less likely to give tick-borne encephalitis virus vaccine (OR: 0.65; 95% CI: 0.44-0.95).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nNinety-three percent of the surveyed physicians agree with the current official vaccination recommendations and would apply them to their own children. However, the observation that 5% of nonpediatricians would not use Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine if they had a child born in 2004 is unexpected and concerning. In contrast, both groups gave additional vaccines than those recommended to their own children. Among physicians in Switzerland interested in immunization, a significant proportion of nonpediatricians decline or delay the immunization of their own children with the recommended MMR- or DTP-based combination vaccines, which indicates that clarification of misconceptions such as fear of \"immune overload\" has not yet reached important targets among health care providers who thus are unlikely to answer parental concerns adequately.","inCitations":["ffa29e67d1be734b2c4fe59ca3dd8c7e1d941d07","ec721e88248b7a820ff28df2737a932a0b4ff623","2a1f15e0257c640909a3a098cdcd99ec8452c4e8","de05c48640826f74a4c46ea631ed34c692595305","a18be4dd91a13cb5749fc0fa48853dae167eb85c","01c0a9b6ee32e567dc8712a13977ad3b8f2c57ac","78fdfa440c88a2c7e7ab5473f482f39c3084db6f","82bc626aa8d52ea0dd732f4445d3bd1af512c221","4150555a1005800fc73831fc2df0d083e76c34c1","d91dfc49348e9d98c82f65c73842931c17b523f0","d277b43121c7c4c113df912dbadf565f89c1a1cf","ca06d0febb4b3406d13b9adacbf8178d4a9a8c3c","0ffae33bbae22409fd5763ea1303227925c4ea7d","ce1a64135f55680155be3d0b7e5b8221f6d59041","baf243bfa6756b003c55e78301b8d425ce3c38c3","dc3dc75a95296ea9689fe6a13e9431f6cb6dd49a","d9bd4cf7b950035a69593a56c31527c010ab4c0f","d5c91b135591c533f6b0d7928ecb95bcae1d1dfd","228f19806b049d2face053a3a9f7e69a25e65ac7","0eefe53ff3549b16e388e94512a6b60c8b2dbccc","9c0653e356fdce97948818ceca5e58f8577954d4","f837bd3fb02e8cf97ee057b0a808320668bba7c9","0f61b72f78abf54a253ec1bcea636437fe2920f1","51a4c436975ff9c676941cc96ccc3409bca04077","3231ad1e9ec4bd23f7f7e20c6f9962778438b420","9ed36e232990c4b9d31e09fdc4445d1149826505","72f754bee5d5fa85f1aaec9f63331639505368b0","bf3c027c5f215a6c2f93127c2dbe69a0674f9c76","144512c587f7117497a722a34af5edb03cea8984","0811d3c4139813961463b5eae0d0a39681feeb1d","cdb302582bd701ea9fa121b55904eb20fd220d70","ca6855be6822b3e732ee7a47d2ddbcabe39e7f5c","11d52378a6f6e8b5f5d16e415e389d0de29aad1b","fed1f44c2443747ee622b4d9e9c18cfc69d718d4","7a1e6806521242bb0b7364695fc5222a496718ef","4e70600f44efec2adfbe214799596acaa84f5ceb","7c4479e408179bd7fef88e16c948a3a76b4fa5b1","03c42b8ed05cab0dfc6a0a332d5207f110bbaf6a","3ffd686f21c9fff6d16e9419fef92a2c64d21dce","6ccd8fbecbc39c64a1db7b9fdbd4c88b30b5a2b4"],"pdfUrls":["http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/pediatrics/116/5/e623.full.pdf"],"title":"How do physicians immunize their own children?

Frequently, lightpipe radiation thermometers are used to measure wafer temperatures in RTP reactors. While the lightpipe distorts the wafer temperature profile less than temperature measurement techniques which require physical contact, the presence of the lightpipe influences the wafer temperature profile. This paper presents the results of a theoretical study exploring that influence for an idealized RTP reactor in which the wafer is treated as a nonconducting, opaque, constant-heat-flux surface imaged by the lightpipe. The coupled radiation/ conduction transport in the lightpipe measurement enclosure is solved numerically. Radiation transfer in the system is modeled with varying levels of rigor, ranging from a simple volumetrically nonparticipating treatment to a full spectral solution of the radiative transfer equation. The results reveal a rather significant effect of the lightpipe on the wafer temperature, which depends on the separation between the lightpipe tip and the wafer. The study illustrates clearly the need to model the lightpipe as a volumetrically participating, semitransparent medium, and further, the importance of accounting for spectral variation of the lightpipe properties in the prediction of the radiative transfer. Finally, two primary mechanisms are identified by which the lightpipe affects the wafer temperature distribution.","inCitations":["f8de6ee0964ee8801499c2e1e2e8459857dbdba5","1ee30e9fca2abdf758151e3eadf4996b998c9fa0","d6ccb3b2c9c1063334e8d8565f39d284932a7441","90e39fcbe7e3b74747dae1e1c74f149b0f64b13b","b29ec9c23ce259ee740abc70eefb8610b8859ecf","07b169ea8a03f0b26d8b6628f865b92cfab566d2"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Investigation of Lightpipe Volumetric Radiation Effects in RTP Thermometry","doi":"10.1115/1.2136917","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1115/1.2136917","venue":""}

Pharmacology : Advances and Applications","paperAbstract":"Mutations of the CFTR gene cause cystic fibrosis (CF), the most common recessive monogenic disease worldwide. These mutations alter the synthesis, processing, function, or half-life of CFTR, the main chloride channel expressed in the apical membrane of epithelial cells in the airway, intestine, pancreas, and reproductive tract. Lung disease is the most critical manifestation of CF. It is characterized by airway obstruction, infection, and inflammation that lead to fatal tissue destruction. In spite of great advances in early and multidisciplinary medical care, and in our understanding of the pathophysiology, CF is still considerably reducing the life expectancy of patients. This review highlights the current development in pharmacological modulators of CFTR, which aim at rescuing the expression and/or function of mutated CFTR.

Preservation of these \nbuildings is important for its historical values and knowledge for the future generations. \nIn the developing country like Malaysia, particularly in the city of Kuala Lumpur, where \nrapid development progressed, these heritage buildings are facing threat of being \ndemolished. The existence of legislations, the latest being the National Heritage Act 2005 \n(Act 264), seems not to be effective in curbing the demolition of these kinds of structures. \nThe legislation has succeeded in preserving government owned buildings but not the \nprivate owned buildings. There are imbalance between the economic development and \nheritage preservation. It is believed that the lack of awareness of the buildings’ \nsignificance, the lack of incentive to encourage conservation, and the lack of options the \nheritage building owners could choose in developing their sites contribute to the factor of \nthe disappearing of these invaluable urban fabrics. The paper dwelled into the problem by \nseeking information on awareness and feedbacks in regards to heritage matters from the \npeople involved in the city planning and development as well as the heritage building \nowners. Subsequently, the research looks into the Transfer of Development Rights \n(TDR), an incentive program, as a tool used in conservation of heritage buildings. It is \nproposed that this TDR program can be utilized by the heritage building owners as an \noption to balance the economic and preservation needs and thus, preserving the heritage \nand historical building in Kuala Lumpur.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"A study of Transfer of Development Right (TDR) as a tool inconservation of heritage buildings.

However, due to the social nature of human beings, group activities have become an integral part of our daily life, thus the popularity of group recommender systems has increased in the last years. Unfortunately, most existing approaches used in group recommender systems make recommendations through aggregating individual preferences or individual predictive results rather than comprehensively investigating users social features that govern their choices made within a group. Therefore, we propose a new group recommendation approach, it incorporates user social network into the random walk with restart model and variously detects the inherent associations among group members, which can help us to better describe groups preference and improve the performance of group recommender systems. Besides, on the basis of multifaceted associations incorporation, we apply a partitioned matrix computation method in the recommendation process to save computational and storage costs. The final experiment results on the real-world CAMRa2011 dataset demonstrates that the proposed approach can not only effectively predict groups’ preference, but also have faster performance and more stable than other baseline methods.","inCitations":["4046a7391ea5bdecc64e95fa8964260905be3b0b","6ba67b9c5b4cb781524214e414de1c41995b83b8"],"pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1007/s10489-018-1375-z"],"title":"Merging user social network into the random walk model for better group recommendation","doi":"10.1007/s10489-018-1375-z","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10489-018-1375-z","venue":"Applied Intelligence"}

Treated Municipal Wastewater (TMWW) in five levels was applied to Brassica oleracea var. Capitata (cabbage) in four replications. The experiment aimed at investigating the effect of TMWW on: (a) the interrelationships of cabbage plant parts (roots, stems, leaves, and heads) heavy metal content, with the respective dry matter yield. (b) The relationship between each individual soil bioavailable diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA extractable) heavy metal, with the dry matter (dm) yield of the abovementioned cabbage plant parts. The heavy metals of cabbage plant parts dry matter were significantly related negatively and statistically with the respective dry matter yield. Similarly, the soil available DTPA-extractable heavy metals were generally negatively affecting the dry matter yield of roots, stems, leaves, and heads. Conversely, Co, Cr, and Cd were found to be positively associated with the dry matter yield increase of the aforementioned plant parts. This effect was indirect, probably being due to contribution in essential elements by the synergistic interactions of these heavy metals with plant nutrients, such as Ca, Mg, Fe, and Mn.","inCitations":["b9ffb107c17300b012e1d7db7d16fd63d1aac60b","3922dee429faff4caca9f4576325afab1f596ca9","520e48dadc04a0e5bdc7cf204f23600c94dd2d19","003e957b2905db12486092ca1d687d588c98c72e","f486a0f535c5978f4bf2197cb27e79ff6697eb8d","dc47e404ccd90440078276532b3d16b54c9269eb","c48ebc461eda1134f5e34be2d43e80aaa1794dc8"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Plant Nutrition Aspects under Treated Wastewater Reuse Management","doi":"10.1007/s11270-010-0658-8","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11270-010-0658-8","venue":""}

This in turn activates calmodulin that triggers CaMKII, MAPK, CREB, and PI3K pathways, among others. However, NMDAR signaling is more complex. In the last two decades several groups have shown that the NMDAR also elicits flux-independent signaling (f-iNMDARs). It has been demonstrated that agonist (Glu or NMDA) or co-agonist (Glycine or d-Serine) bindings initiate intracellular events, including conformational changes, exchange of molecular interactions, release of second messengers, and signal transduction, that result in different cellular events including endocytosis, LTD, cell death, and neuroprotection, among others. Interestingly, f-iNMDARs has also been observed in pathological conditions and non-neuronal cells. Here, the molecular and cellular events elicited by these flux-independent actions (non-canonical or metabotropic-like) of the NMDAR are reviewed. Considering the NMDAR complexity, it is possible that these flux-independent events have a more relevant role in intracellular signaling that has been disregarded for decades. Moreover, considering the wide expression and function of the NMDAR in non-neuronal cells and other tissues beyond the nervous system and some evolutionary traits, f-iNMDARs calls for a reconsideration of how we understand the biology of this complex receptor.","inCitations":["d045b973ff68fa0b1cdc3002a7bcb4910a0280de","3d123f26892f8569de8ccd7d2ba17c93b4a04ce9"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Flux-Independent NMDAR Signaling: Molecular Mediators, Cellular Functions, and Complexities","doi":"10.3390/ijms19123800","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms19123800","venue":"International journal of molecular sciences"}

In these patients, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors improve exercise performance. The present study was designed to assess whether skeletal muscle dysfunction develops in the early stage of cardiac overload and if so, whether such functional alterations can be prevented by ACE inhibition. Mechanical performance, cross-bridge (CB) properties, and myosin heavy chain composition were investigated in respiratory and limb skeletal muscles of rabbits with moderate cardiac hypertrophy, and after single therapy with the ACE inhibitor perindopril (PE). After constriction of the aorta, the rabbits were treated during a 10-week period with either PE (1 mg/kg/day; n = 9) or a placebo (PL; n = 15). A third group of sham-operated animals received PL (n = 10). Analyses were performed on isolated diaphragm and soleus strips. Compared with sham-operated animals (shams), peak tetanic tension in PL fell by 40% in diaphragm and 34% in soleus. There were no significant differences in peak tetanic tension and the maximum shortening velocity between PE and shams. In both muscles, the total number of CBs was significantly lower in PL than in shams, but did not differ between shams and PE. The elementary force per CB did not differ between groups. In both muscles, the myosin heavy chain composition did not differ between groups. The study demonstrated that intrinsic performance of diaphragm and soleus muscles was affected early in the development of chronic pressure overload. Single therapy with PE tended to preserve muscle strength, essentially by limiting the loss of CBs.","inCitations":["f12cbd89c0f7ca06ed388aa20773441d7859a24f","839da10ec8cfebee8b6fd2f1d9976ffb5e9b30a5","6b7728250f50a4e947466bc11fef5d2c1ce2bfed","6d01b72a8775737a25ce83f81a382b9769cac0f0","0d3ebb40a6ac29281462067e475a6a749723b6c5","643f49071a383c4a5413cee82a936531a99b73da","ec6fe9eb52ffe9482d1db5dcd8ad04a2bdd867bc","5ca268de150c61fef535b77525976ea3519a0853","eb34af97e368ac73c97280546167a7b83e78edad","3e6cd43af922423c52c72392d35c23581fce38f6","e092148b4f37d671355936eac2990148ec02ac3a"],"pdfUrls":["http://jpet.aspetjournals.org/content/jpet/291/1/70.full.pdf"],"title":"Impaired skeletal muscle performance in the early stage of cardiac pressure overload in rabbits: beneficial effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition.","doi":"","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics"}

The etiology is still a dilemma. Studies about suggestive hypothesis are ongoing. Most of the times it affects lung, liver and bones, although this kind of tumor may involve the head and neck area, breast, lymph nodes, mediastinum, brain and meninges, the spine, skin, abdomen and many other sites. Because of its heterogeneous presentation, as it represents less than 1% of all the vascular tumors, it is often misdiagnosed and not suitably treated, leading to a poor prognosis in some cases. Over 50-76% of the patients are asymptomatic. A small number of them complains respiratory symptoms. Bone metastases might cause pathological fractures or spine compression, if they arise in vertebrae. Imaging is necessary to determine morphological data, the involvement of surrounding tissues, and potentially the cleavage plan. It is important to recognize the expression of vascular markers (Fli-1 and CD31 are endothelial-specific markers), and the microscopic evidence of vascular differentiation to make a correct diagnosis, as many pulmonary diseases show multiple nodular lesions. Because of its rarity, there is no standard for treatment. We focused on radiotherapy as a good therapeutic option: despite the poor prognosis, evidence is in favor of radiotherapy which offers local pain control with good tolerance and better quality of life at least at a one-year follow-up in most of cases. Further studies are needed to establish the standard radiation dose to be used for locoregional control of such a complex and extremely rare disease.","inCitations":["fa115deb4dc1152987e519ac200614c526be854c","a3ffae22da86b22503121ce26d854083e2518a53","f25e1fb093b027a3b528d004a6c67c03a26a24d5","bd17ffa4d0a63a68958d0045a786dd00dbe84a05","1e73c6781c92960b06724581226a7fcb7caaf62b","44b1b4101c121be885cc5c8c42062ede1ae24edc","d8f1b66cb05b0a9de58dd64f1163c081f3ce6dde","158b78f35e6def6dcbd706e26f254d8d19812bef","afa92a26379242c09cc0687980fa06c983446a34","aced1751e55346e4e1137ff28683bef6db8d0ca5","6f471912cd9ca645dce50e3b5adbcc28b486c7c1","bb7c87ab67ce8dfef193345702bce123726e0b86","3986ce669c99b491fbdb9fb03ca445022d20983b","6ecb83b3eace64f740e40acca6e8b336b21fcf92","1e75b464560b230cff80ae91070c49b1468a54e4","1dad40e81a33465d98280eba98b79238117c077e","172f965d27d24d5aa5b0fd62275a1430106a00d0","79d3ca841a29af46d875cd88831c96d9f8511295","d525ea33b7dab3263c93b9d9269d54306af19726","1216d92fa45fced22d5ff45535a009e51ca6a03a","a44cb4265da0a11d5c9014347f7bd4d04b3661d4","21f75a28a892b904181975db5533098aeb6a8c56","9c261acae3c114cef16399a13b9c0fd232b0d2a4","a56128ac831a179aa6ff0ebeccb0ab7bbe9e1c12","e80e3d05b0308b746d33f54f7db2c5d9999f2da7","0c09e27c0ca2e704993f0c270140b32af90f0d61","e96db6a7215a53887532f3f7053f193b973e4739","9c1750af4920697dcf7b200f432acd692f896ff1","9e137d36daba0853b0bec65d2abba7ea89b320c1","79aa8d76ce12ac3f1437671ec8036f1bbfdfcaa3","aea4c5087d5ad2fdc28374cf52af79fecb396b21","637ed75d41313ee2bb819f5646c3d02e2798496f","689c066bdcc887e40b64542dbdc0b7f97f9434d1","a2bbb412043fd5a22645c852aecee399d8df4085","6a8a4d6a14d82211bd773c78c2a84da1af4946d2","616036d0f5856d7bc64f8bdd639482f908bdb765","bdd17ee9407c1ea14851d304d51090cc3b21755e","cfba0cd8291fdc5f16704b11fd971c16453e1767","596665675186910cd1ae4a83fb17a2c3b07931d8","2f6b29052f3b53bcf37342606719e4e438c6c39f","5fff25dddb68fbf3a47e4640a8e2dc84c43df185","4e8a7df1467ef8e9d643c82a4bdf446e3605ca1a","7a8cb09e9f38af342342356c3057c3eb5281bd62","dd7c2a25ccd463b419a6cddda8b3218fb32a27eb","fa1d132c694d665985358830dfd06e8e3ed3669a","7ea267666e7212d6f7e8424aee85f63a65058c21","906abed23576a76868b72b0c83b4aa648f7b39fe","279332c463897efcbe96471672b33b6468640d6f","5eec1866e0b80d7e8cb85129310ad9c6987c7f05","beec9e0725c83c519698b822373f03609f58e30d","e37fb6e6d0927963a51c0e4f14aa37750a3194c6","a64ba68e92973a54971f8ce448fcbe8c8e10782a","35706cf1cc0a9ef39ba5306202f8a544f2b8d3e0"],"pdfUrls":["https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/pmc/oa_pdf/96/d8/onco-2014-2-259.PMC4419652.pdf","http://www.oncologyreviews.org/index.php/or/article/download/259/206"],"title":"Epithelioid Hemangioendothelioma: An Overview and Update on a Rare Vascular Tumor","doi":"10.4081/oncol.2014.259","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.4081/oncol.2014.259","venue":"Oncology reviews"}

We conducted a prospective randomized comparative observation of the mobilization with a single dose (10 μg kg once a day) or split dose (5 μg kg twice a day) of lenograstim following chemotherapy in 25 multiple myeloma (MM) and 15 non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL) patients. Chemotherapy was cyclophosphamide 4 g/m2 for MM and ESHAP with or without Rituximab for NHL. The median number of harvested CD34+ cells was 19.4×106/kg and 15.8×106/kg in the single- and split-dose groups, respectively (p=0.47).

The nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)/antioxidant response element (ARE) pathway plays a key role in inducing phase II detoxifying enzymes and antioxidant proteins and is now considered as a interesting therapeutic target for the treatment of stroke. The objective of this study is to investigate the protective effect of Gualou Guizhi granule (GLGZG) against oxidative stress and explore the protective mechanism of the Nrf2/ARE pathway. In vivo, administration of GLGZG in a rat model of focal cerebral ischemia significantly suppressed oxidative injury by increasing the activity of superoxide dismutase and glutathione level and decreasing reactive oxygen species and malondialdehyde levels. Western blot analysis showed that GLGZG induced nuclear translocation of Nrf2, and combined with real-time PCR results, which indicated that GLGZG up-regulated the Nrf2/ARE pathway. In addition, in cultured PC12 cells, GLGZG protected against H2O2 induced oxidative injury and activated the Nrf2/ARE pathway. All the results demonstrated that GLGZG in the management of cerebral ischemia and H2O2 induced oxidative injury may be associated with activation of Nrf2/ARE signaling pathway.","inCitations":["d501823d126f5578b3d3164c0c4b2a4f166c16bd","d935ce909cdf5e61b61699aabd647c11da6c9ccc","07b9c93f88ba07ef7186b8d451ef37db716bbf50"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Gualou Guizhi Granule Protects Against Oxidative Injury by Activating Nrf2/ARE Pathway in Rats and PC12 Cells","doi":"10.1007/s11064-018-2507-x","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11064-018-2507-x","venue":"Neurochemical Research"}

With the use of a DNA fragment containing the DNA polymerase gene of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) as a hybridization probe, we were able to localize the DNA polymerase gene of murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) to a region within MCMV EcoRI fragment B which spans the HindIII site separating HindIII fragments D and H. This site is colinear with the HCMV strain AD169 DNA polymerase gene. To confirm that this region encoded the MCMV DNA polymerase gene, we sequenced a 5131 nucleotide fragment from the PstI site in HindIII fragment D to a BglII site in HindIII fragment H. Initiating in HindIII fragment D and extending into HindIII fragment H was a long open reading frame (ORF) 1097 amino acids in length with extensive homology to the DNA polymerases of HCMV, herpes simplex virus, and Epstein-Barr virus. Upstream of the polymerase ORF was a reading frame with considerable homology to the carboxy terminal half of the glycoprotein B gene of human herpesviruses. At early times in the infection, we could detect with a probe representing part of the polymerase ORF two 3' coterminal transcripts, 3.9 kb and 1.7 kb in length. S1 nuclease and exonuclease VII analyses indicated that both transcripts were unspliced and initiated at independent sites in HindIII fragment D. By primer extension, we were able to map precisely the 5' end of the 3.9-kb RNA to a site 186 nucleotides upstream of the beginning of the DNA polymerase ORF.","inCitations":["5aaf434882de426af909fb01549d6edc5bae6db0","ad06e03eceefa7fff35758d3013072cc76238b60","5cd4b3d5b51064bac18d275c5994f2fa855abb2c","d0d4143bf885eaad9101d38ec2b44dd867a59503","fef21ec8d5164f89c514cbe8593effa01f0a4340","f5b458b796117e00a9f3a0163e3a771f5f2df695","50627c6d41206d28b1eb41e586dac5bad3be8c09","91b62191ade75133abde82f2ebb6595e5b9d9aba","997592f0772a23ac2f97501e85ab6dd048d6a434","6064dedd6151a0ceb34b70c2580055d81bdf6b17","f826d5616e42542031f187dabe6fd0ba96ade302","0a2582943f1ae02c2688797096d5c528258295da","a0cc84c789d41fbfeb8a25440c9820a89f28fbf7","93ad2af92fb279fd13168018b1b2aebdeb02985b","6e9c1b051baf1c38d426dd0835850d9789a81c9a","ca75104d39848a496e6b18bb1d446c87a4a4b3d8","f566ef70e8a71c19a506dcb740dcc37f06660fa1","a147bea14f1c5dcd669a40ada18300daa51006a6","5e9f5f2090afd810d1a461416c497ba776a98de2","e3354bbe14612f238c407dccaca5c5ddc7b96bd9","92a7a5575ef8c17a29453d0b567ac95e82887788"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Transcription analysis and sequence of the putative murine cytomegalovirus DNA polymerase gene.","doi":"10.1016/0042-6822(91)90765-4","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/0042-6822%2891%2990765-4","venue":"Virology"}

Muscarinic M2 receptor-mediated inhibition of adenylyl cyclase activity has been demonstrated in smooth muscle and since beta-adrenoceptor relaxation of this tissue is mediated via stimulation of adenylyl cyclase, an interaction between muscarinic M2 receptors and beta-adrenoceptors in smooth muscle has been postulated. Such an interaction has been demonstrated in guinea-pig ileum and trachea using two different approaches. The present study investigates whether interactions between muscarinic M2 receptors and beta-adrenoceptors also occur in guinea-pig oesophageal muscularis mucosae. Using the technique of selective muscarinic M3 receptor alkylation, we were unable to demonstrate muscarinic M2 receptor-mediated re-contractions in oesophageal smooth muscle, as described previously in ileum. In addition, while increased functional antagonism of relaxant responses to isoprenaline could be demonstrated in tissues pre-contracted with oxotremorine M compared to histamine, muscarinic M2 receptor activation did not contribute to this effect, as described previously in trachea. These data suggest a lack of interaction between muscarinic M2 receptors and beta-adrenoceptors in guinea-pig oesophageal smooth muscle, but suggest an interaction between muscarinic M3 receptors and beta-adrenoceptors.","inCitations":["55860b3db861f477b98c6f762ffd6d15b862eb08","763d54fba6fcc3f1127ef665546235d78c8303bb","a4fabc2fc4409be2f88074bbb7768900fe535735"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Characterization of muscarinic receptor and beta-adrenoceptor interactions in guinea-pig oesophageal muscularis mucosae.","doi":"10.1016/0014-2999(95)00656-7","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/0014-2999%2895%2900656-7","venue":"European journal of pharmacology"}

Two implicit discretisation of order O ⁢ ( τ ) {O(\\tau)} and O ⁢ ( τ 1 + 1 2 ⁢ σ ) {O(\\tau^{1+\\frac{1}{2}\\sigma})} are derived, respectively.

As questoes versaram sobre as possiveis relacoes entre a categoria de redes sociais em saude, em tecnologias de informacao e comunicacao (TIC), em educacao e nas ciencias sociais. O programa Telessaude Brasil no Estado do Para ainda e embrionario, com um Projeto Piloto iniciado em setembro de 2010, pela SES/PA, no municipio de Santarem-PA. A participacao na Rede Universitaria de Telemedicina (RUTE) ocorreu desde 2009 com a inclusao dos dois Hospitais Universitarios da UFPA. A roda de conversa que inicialmente envolveu docentes da area da saude e das ciencias humanas (Antropologia) apontou para discussao das redes sociais em TIC, por meio do telessaude, serem voltadas para a saude coletiva e publica, na perspectiva da integralidade, assim como, para a memoria, saberes e os significados sociais atribuidos aos participantes da rede no processo saude-doenca. As criticas iniciais alertaram para a possibilidade de desenvolvimento de Projetos com acoes pontuais, fragmentadas e de caracteristica apenas de urgencia. Apontaram ainda para as dificuldades do trabalho em redes virtuais cujos objetivos nao estejam definidos e acompanhados e a dificuldade de lidar com diferentes profissionais e seus saberes. Objetivos: 1) aproximar diferentes areas em torno da categoria redes sociais. 2) reolhar a aplicabilidade de projetos e/ou programas a distância em saude publica.Metodo: Adotamos o metodo dialogico, com as tecnicas de exposicao dialogada e roda de conversa, envolvendo os docentes, equipe do projeto de pesquisa e discentes de graduacao. Resultados: Consideram-se como resultados parciais que: ainda ha poucos estudos sobre redes sociais em saude no Estado do Para; a politica publica de saude estadual pouco avancou para a implantacao de projetos de telessaude no Estado; ainda ha baixa formacao e capacitacao de recursos humanos voltada para redes virtuais em saude; as iniciativas institucionais sao desafiadas a estabelecer uma rede entre profissional de saude e usuario do servico continua, com memoria, com significados e com troca de saberes; e os projetos de telessaude deverao ser estruturados e alinhados buscando aproximacao com o cotidiano dos usuarios e as questoes de saude coletiva e publica, na perspectiva preventivista.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Uma roda de conversa sobre telessaúde, política pública, significados, saberes e redes sociais.","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Aside from neutral-ablation shielding, none of the shielding mechanisms studied is very effective. Dissociation of hydrogen molecules extends pellet lifetimes by 10-20%. Ionization reduces the temperatures in the ablation by about a factor of three, but extends pellet lifetimes by only a few per cent. Excitation of atoms is not important because the fraction of excited atoms does not exceed a few per cent anywhere in the ablation.

The classification of gases detected by an artificial nose is one other area where Deep Learning techniques can be used to seek classification improvements. Succeeding in a classification task can result in many advantages to quality control, as well as to preventing accidents. In this work, it is presented some Deep Learning models specifically created to the task of gas classification. Resumo. O uso de técnicas como Deep Learning tem se mostrado promissor para problemas de classificação, principalmente em relação a classificação de imagens. Classificação de gases detectados por um nariz artificial é mais uma das áreas em que técnicas de Deep Learning podem ser utilizadas para aprimoramento de classificação. O sucesso na tarefa de classificação de gases pode ser vantajoso tanto para controle de qualidade, quanto para prevenção de acidentes. Neste trabalho são apresentados modelos de Deep Learning voltados especificamente à tarefa de classificação de gases. 1. Introdução A detecção de compostos odorantes pode ser utilizada numa variedade de aplicações do mundo real. De controle de qualidade, até detecção de alimentos deteriorados e também na prevenção de acidentes com gases que são explosivos ou nocivos ao corpo humano [Zanchettin and Ludermir 2007]. Principalmente em situações onde o olfato humano é falho, ou até mesmo inútil, para detecção de certos tipos de gases. A detecção de gases é realizada com o auxı́lio de dispositivo denominado nariz artificial [Fonollosa et al. 2016, Zanchettin and Ludermir 2007]. Tal dispositivo gera dados que podem ser avaliados por modelos de aprendizagem de máquina para distinguir qual tipo de gás está sendo detectado. Neste trabalho são apresentados três configurações diferentes de modelos de aprendizagem de máquina para completar esta tarefa. Isto foi feito com o objetivo de investigar o desempenho dos modelos implementados de acordo com os conjuntos de dados utilizados. O resto deste trabalho está organizado da seguinte forma: A seção 2 é dividida em duas partes. A primeira contém uma breve explanação sobre os conjuntos de dados, bem como algumas explicações sobre a aquisição dos dados. Na segunda parte, há uma explanação de como os modelos de aprendizagem de máquina foram definidos. Na seção 3 são mostrados os resultados dos modelos de acordo com cada conjunto de dados. A seção 4 contém a conclusão e também são discutidos possı́veis trabalhos futuros.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://sol.sbc.org.br/index.php/eniac/article/download/9339/9241"],"title":"Modelos de deep learning para classificação de gases detectados por matrizes de sensores nariz artificial","doi":"10.5753/eniac.2019.9339","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.5753/eniac.2019.9339","venue":""}

As an alternative, phosphor-doped silicone resin wheels have been used to convert blue-ray laser diodes. However, high-temperature photonic decay and cracking on the lens surface significantly degrade transmission. Recent research has explored the possibility of replacing the silicone encapsulant material of the phosphor layer with glass. In this study, the thermal effects of a glass-based phosphor-converted color wheel (GP wheel) and a silicone-based phosphor-converted color wheel (SP wheel) were investigated using various parameters and geometries. A thermal-structural coupling finite element (FE) model of the color wheels was employed to simulate the thermal and stress distributions. To construct the FE model, experiments were conducted and the inverse engineering approach was employed to extract the optical-to-heat conversion coefficient and the heat convection coefficient. In addition, an arc-shaped moving input heat flux was used to simulate a moving laser input and reduce the calculation time of the FE model. Based on the numerical and experimental results, the FE model developed can simulate the steady/transient behavior of the resin and the GP wheel. In addition, the results reveal that thermal failures of the SP wheel are very likely to occur under all parameters employed in this study, whereas the maximum temperature of the GP wheel reaches only approximately 40% of the glass transition temperature. The numerical results indicate that the GP wheel may be useful for overcoming all of these thermal disadvantages in a high-power laser-lit projector.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Effects of Coating Film Parameters on Thermal and Stress Distributions of Glass-Based Phosphor-Converted Color Wheels","doi":"10.3390/coatings8050188","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.3390/coatings8050188","venue":""}
