Author believes that the battle strategy has the profound impact to the result. Since Virchow discovered the cellular origin of cancer in 1863, cancers are being seeing as a localized disease resulting from foreign invasions whereas eradication therapies have been the dominant practices. However, people neglected the overall relationship between cancer and human body therefore overlooked the solutions from transformation, modulation and regulation point of view. Author recently wrote three books with new ideas and directions for cancer prevention and control by adopting the concept of \"adopting Western for Eastern and making the past service current\": \"Elimination combined with transformation in parallel— academician's view for war on cancer\", \"Chinese way of battling cancer—wisdom from Sun-Zi's Art of War\" and \"Controlling rather than confronting the cancer—MAO Ze-dong's On Protracted War and the strategy of cancer prevention and control\".","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Elimination plus Transformation—Chinese and Western Medicine Integration Brings Hope to Protracted War on Cancer","doi":"10.1007/s11655-018-2990-6","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11655-018-2990-6","venue":"Chinese Journal of Integrative Medicine"}

Here we show different types of responses to task-irrelevant visual features in three functionally dissociated groups of primate prefrontal neurons. Two Japanese macaques participated in a go/no-go task in which they had to discriminate either the color or the motion direction of a visual target to make a correct manual response. Prior to the experiment, the monkeys had been trained extensively so that they acquired fixed associations between visual features and required responses (e.g., \"green = go\"; \"downward motion = no-go\"). In this design, the monkey was confronted with a visual target from which it had to extract relevant information (e.g., color in the color-discrimination condition) while ignoring irrelevant information (e.g., motion direction in the color-discrimination condition). We recorded from 436 task-related prefrontal neurons while the monkey performed the multidimensional go/no-go task: 139 (32%) neurons showed go/no-go discrimination based on color as well as motion direction (\"integration cells\"); 192 neurons (44%) showed go/no-go discrimination only based on color (\"color-feature cells\"); and 105 neurons (24%) showed go/no-go discrimination only based on motion direction (\"motion-feature cells\"). Overall, however, 162 neurons (37%) were influenced by irrelevant information: 53 neurons (38%) among integration cells, 71 neurons (37%) among color-feature cells, and 38 neurons (36%) among motion-feature cells. Across all types of neurons, the response to an irrelevant feature was positively correlated with the response to the same feature when it was relevant, indicating that the influence from irrelevant information is a residual from S-R associations that are relevant in a different context. Temporal and anatomical differences among integration, color-feature and motion-feature cells suggested a sequential mode of information processing in prefrontal cortex, with integration cells situated toward the output of the decision-making process. In these cells, the response to irrelevant information appears as a congruency effect, with better go/no-go discrimination when both the relevant and irrelevant feature are associated with the same response than when they are associated with different responses. This congruency effect could be the result of the combined input from color- and motion-feature cells. Thus these data suggest that irrelevant features lead to partial activation of neurons even toward the output of the decision-making process in primate prefrontal cortex.","inCitations":["49986cecfc353e6a782ce19b64b16e9d62ccc743","e11eb1a16ab80067479c53a68d3211cf55584ca1","3b2238108c7319b16cffd865d3d6d223693cdad0","221d5d6376e3d277fd6f522251d529df0f8c0ec4","38230fd2495f73bd78aff74fbdafe12bb81a8f13","dbb1397ec236bf543b00a17d6df6d2cd0a8cde9e","cda00ffb1760f7a4ef59040ae76d6e420e5d2da2","9b718c79ef63bb7ddececdd1b07e1effd5c5b339","37158678e64376c805acf45b8084cf43e7c03865","c5febb8230852a8fb57b417227862e11d6214199","2cc3ee094b58f763b93b89e67c5905cdd09b2fd5","5bc245086a0eb4d64770915378939fd313a32d0d","b6557d2d9098b4b3ef27ace13c902f5631c50655","1ad4a57d4243cea279d183985fba74901bf99d2f","663f006cbc9a371e796ee1a637c0c4667ac3e861","3108503917679e06cdcf9627038ce5d134ba63af","c582158be47e8bcc2fe844b105f0457a6989706c","34d2879f785aecc8eb3b151903537c5e871fe07f","964cd4a31f778cc84966e667e279ba4b2c146a04","27cf4ae310f396c68c991c3bdba2cef10ad015ca","24ba1b7220d6d71ac9d77050b01dd2baf0a87bfd","6155b27836845f7144483fad918ddcb5772c1589","c429dda5c67c184b7e16240cdea191882c5c31a2","32bf4c5a05504676659021b3690574ea3c10b63f","c2fb68d35caeedb50b2e5c93b78d2e694e762709","c479f2667be2bc43e9901477d3f94c39efd7e00d","4a7929bb0fe99a18198b0b6e2615ed48fba8501d","89cbfe5610eb57481c03e0e21edfa1efa7eba2c3","393dd11055bdc22b07716ce1723e51551218b716","07a73c8fb5b3f25fefa925753425a11f7b6d3d3b","8ff670bc2c9387c50f48b5ac3a0cc4e3d1b6f893","85dae68a9ed4eceb0654ec7d608e979cd4d36d7e","52e9538b57d351d0baf6386c29f88775c5ee95a7","aa232d3e132d0c78110b421515fd766ba753e6c4","d5898e792b41e68db0092d348979ccc44591c529","23ffbbd2fbbd35639e972c3d488cf6d27690ef55","c2e395cfaa94321aac83aa856cfe19e92b72cba1","0a3c2ed0df6d736d01ef60186cc122117f0baab9","917b069acd1077e06296f9a570e60faff8ffd7f4","f504a5ee90f84ced722efa9b6269b7dc3d80b8a4"],"pdfUrls":["http://jn.physiology.org/content/jn/86/4/2001.full.pdf","http://www.victoria.ac.nz/psyc/about/staff/pdf/jl5.pdf","http://lsr-web.net/Assets/NEIPages/OkihideHikosaka/pdfs/LauwereynsSakagamiTsutsuiKobayashiKoizumiOH01.pdf","http://www.lsr-web.net/Assets/NEIPages/OkihideHikosaka/pdfs/LauwereynsSakagamiTsutsuiKobayashiKoizumiOH01.pdf"],"title":"Responses to task-irrelevant visual features by primate prefrontal neurons.","doi":"10.1152/jn.2001.86.4.2001","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1152/jn.2001.86.4.2001","venue":"Journal of neurophysiology"}

Given the quantum field particle pair model, and consequently polar nature of the quantum field, we can reinterpret Gauss’s Law so that polarization causes charge rather than charge causing polarization. That is how unit charge is independent of particles, and thus the same for all free particles. It is also important to note that as the quantum field becomes polarized, rotation is induced, leading to the spin quantum and magnetic moment. The author has previously shown that mass-energy can be explained as a quantum field effect since, as Dirac first hypothesized, a particle must exert energy for a particle to exist in the quantum field, which equals its mass-energy. This is also true for quantum fluctuation particle pairs, such that their energy and energy continuum are due to the instantaneous local energy of the quantum field exerted on individual quantum fluctuations. Likewise, frequency and wavelength are also a function of this quantum field interaction. This origin of frequency and wavelength also gives us the origin of time and spatial dimensions. An electron behaves like it has a central bare electron that acts as a negative polarizer and is matter as opposed to antimatter. Its remaining properties, including charge, spin, magnetic moment, and mass are explainable as quantum field effects.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://vixra.org/pdf/1809.0533v1.pdf"],"title":"Electron Properties Explained as Quantum Field Effects","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

The effect of food on the in vivo erosion behavior was investigated on two formulations containing different contents of the same HPMC grade. The in vivo erosion behavior and gastrointestinal transit were investigated using magnetic marker monitoring (MMM). The in vitro and in vivo erosion-time profiles show that the erosion was strongly dependent on the composition of the formulation. The formulations containing a larger proportion of high molecular weight HPMC or higher content of HPMC exhibit relatively slower erosion rate and vice versa. In vivo erosion rates were significantly higher under postprandial administration as compared to fasted state administration. No rapid disintegration of any of the formulations (i.e. formulation failure that can potentially cause dose dumping) was observed.","inCitations":["3d3f209345e9f4f023daa51ff5ede3919b356d95","d219569ab26964a3c566ec7555b11bbdea5b2d97","63af97f160e533395cb80674f5e117c0a0191838","06936db3cbc24bafb8200074c326521494c2abfa","0c0853939935a67378f76b7d987a7370b8d590a4","b55469330fe599dbdfa02ef69668db1265c34723","6ecc27809cafbdde162699e9eb181079613fe59f","0fe9ded2b55006b9848d975a1533cfcb1c8901b7","1e3fac834d7fa6c5f0968eab40ee8d050b3f4bb4","0fddf426cbaca507ff6993135c011387e8d03016","0a9b8bd590cdce658800053cc9abfcc9e09e9aa1","b13fb876c3e5872fe290db023a804dc39c30f102","670c05c50f9514ff346f2745f8c53fec3e5900e3","c5787825686c8d6182e642867464e2b7bab79fa5","119947e3fc6177a0ebe6ae4590a3d2d30ec1ce3c","22edfa545a0aa4d06a75ef02bdd8cb48df9b7f55","7af9355e06b818d24d428c2395dc165ff6867bcd","e16f872c50aeea9350a9a30abef2ef063f71053d","175fd64586302368ea5712dcad9e851ce546fb5f","614b2d717444e7ced542723b7a84fd89a6be1ed1","df88eb6fbc7f9a522f4b4933e835be4b3499cdf1","8fd93c09f0e28378afb06d5a7873e765579059f2","beb997581079a488bdfaba69c4537557288004c9","8b35af83b8d1819ac7d3931a702892fd871026e6","16d57a36553ed0cb3de3e85132dc1eeb1d1796bf","52d350de69ce56573010075131252cc661195175","6ad444a4cebc55f25798939b18aaa292ed93d18d"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"The influence of hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) molecular weight, concentration and effect of food on in vivo erosion behavior of HPMC matrix tablets.","doi":"10.1016/j.jconrel.2014.04.058","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jconrel.2014.04.058","venue":"Journal of controlled release : official journal of the Controlled Release Society"}

At the same time, continuous monitoring WSNs suffer from limited network lifetimes, since they need to propagate large amounts of data over regular time intervals towards a single destination in the network. Propagation of information is done through multiple hops, suffering from collisions, retransmissions and therefore high energy consumption. Moreover, since there is a bottleneck effect around the network sink, all routing layer algorithms will always deplete the power of the last tier before the fusion center. Finally, theory shows that in such networks scalability could become an issue since transport capacity per node is severely affected as the number of nodes within the network increases. Therefore, in order for WSNs to be considered as an efficient tool to monitor the health state of large structures, their energy consumption should be reduced to a bare minimum. In this work we consider a couple of novel techniques for increasing the lifetime of the sensor network, related to both node and network architecture. Namely, we consider new node designs that are of low cost, low complexity, and low energy consumption. Moreover, we present a new network architecture for such small nodes, that would enable them to reach a base station at large distances from the network, with minimal energy.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://vbn.aau.dk/files/67090285/MS02_1628_FPAP_PDF.pdf"],"title":"Low Cost Wireless Sensor Network for Continuous Bridge monitoring","doi":"10.1201/b12352-28","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1201/b12352-28","venue":""}

A comparative study is made on different parallel solvers. The numerical models are presented, including hydration models, water cooling models, modulus models, creep model, and autogenous deformation models. A finite element simulation is made for the whole process of excavation and pouring of dams using these models. The numerical results show a good agreement with the measured ones. To achieve a better computing efficiency, four parallel solvers utilizing parallelization techniques are employed: (1) a parallel preconditioned conjugate gradient (PCG) solver based on OpenMP, (2) a parallel preconditioned Krylov subspace solver based on MPI, (3) a parallel sparse equation solver based on OpenMP, and (4) a parallel GPU equation solver. The parallel solvers run either in a shared memory environment OpenMP or in a distributed memory environment MPI. A comparative study on these parallel solvers is made, and the results show that the parallelization makes SAPTIS more efficient, powerful, and adaptable.","inCitations":["b8e4f44547bd37f0ba1a4fb45c138837e23b43fa"],"pdfUrls":["http://downloads.hindawi.com/journals/mpe/2013/764237.pdf"],"title":"A Comparative Study on Different Parallel Solvers for Nonlinear Analysis of Complex Structures","doi":"10.1155/2013/764237","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1155/2013%2F764237","venue":""}

The full length of the FABP gene is 878 bp, with the open reading frame being 399 bp and the non-coding regions of the 5′ end and the 3′ end being 94 bp and 385 bp, respectively. The gene encodes a protein composed of 132 amino acids. A homology analysis showed that the FABP gene has high similarity with fatty acid-binding protein and retinoic acid-binding protein genes. Real-time PCR showed that the FABP gene was expressed mainly in subepidermal adipose tissue, and secondarily in intestine and heart. The expression characteristics at different developmental stages showed that the expression of the gene was low at the larval stage (0–25 d) and reached the highest level after 30 days. RNA interference results showed no significant difference in the appearance of E. carinicauda and no individual death after this gene was silenced. Compared with the control group, except C20:2n-6 which increased, the contents of the other 12 fatty acids in shrimps in the RNA interference group decreased significantly, and the total amount of fatty acids also decreased significantly, which suggests that the FABP gene is closely related to changes in fatty acid content in shrimp.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Cloning and functional study of fatty acid-binding protein-like gene of the ridgetail white prawn, Exopalaemon carinicauda","doi":"10.1007/s10499-020-00540-1","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10499-020-00540-1","venue":"Aquaculture International"}

When applying the coarse-grain tree graph representation, introduced by Shapiro and coworkers in the 80's, it is possible to predict mutations leading to conformational rearrangements in RNAs of around 50 nt and higher. However, for small RNAs, such representations at the level of stems, bulges, and loops become ineffective. Recently, there is an interest in investigating secondary structure rearrangements in small RNAs, following their structural probing by comparative imino proton NMR spectroscopy. For computational predictions of mutations leading to the structure rearrangements of small RNAs, it is necessary to use a fine-grain graph representation as introduced by Waterman in the 70's at the level of nucleotides. Each nucleotide becomes a node in the graph and its equivalent Laplacian matrix is of the size N /spl times/ N for a sequence of N nucleotides. Conformational rearrangements caused by mutations can be studied using measures to assess the differences between Laplacian matrices of fine-grain graph representations. The second eigenvalue of the Laplacian matrix can be used to filter mutations that lead to a structure similar to the wildtype but additional measures are needed. Image analysis techniques, by moving a sliding window over Laplacian matrices, can facilitate in differentiating between local rearrangements and global rearrangements.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Fine-grain matrix graph representation for predicting mutations leading to conformational rearrangements in small RNAs","doi":"10.1109/CSB.2004.84","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CSB.2004.84","venue":""}

Also, whether the basal cell layer retains within it, some properties of ectomesenchyme, which was imbibed during the early embryogenesis and hence its neuroectodermal relation, is not known. Here, an attempt is made to establish the hidden neuroectodermal potential of the oral epithelium, especially the basal layer, by observing the expression of known neuroectodermal markers, NSE (Neuron Specific Enolase), Synaptophysin and CD99. The expression of the same markers has also been studied in Ameloblastoma, connecting it with oral epithelium, in turn establishing basal cell layer as a potential source of Ameloblastoma.\n\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nSections of formalin fixed, paraffin embedded tissue samples of 20 cases of Ameloblastoma and 10 cases of Normal Retromolar mucosa, were stained immunohistochemically with NSE, Synaptophysin, CD99 and also with CK-19 and evaluated for positive expression.\n\n\nRESULTS\nPositive reaction was obtained in all the cases of Ameloblastoma and NRM (Normal Retromolar mucosa) with NSE, all the cases of Ameloblastoma and eight cases of NRM with Synaptophysin and in six cases of Ameloblastoma and NRM with CD99. The staining was diffuse and more marked in case of NSE than Synaptophysin and CD99. CK19 staining done to assure that the tissue antigenicity was maintained was positive in all the samples.\n\n\nINTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSION\nA strong relationship between the neuroectoderm, Ameloblastoma and the basal layer of the oral epithelium is established by the study. It favours the hypothesis that the basal cell layer of oral mucosa may be the sought out culprit in most cases of the Ameloblastomas, especially those occurring in the non-tooth bearing area. This would call for the need to incorporate additional therapy in the form of mucosal striping along with the conventional treatment.","inCitations":["db2250e581918fd0def64a3e6e31c76e27bdf94c"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Origin of ameloblastoma from Basal cells of the oral epithelium- establishing the relation using neuroectodermal markers.","doi":"10.7860/JCDR/2014/6740.5026","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.7860/JCDR%2F2014%2F6740.5026","venue":"Journal of clinical and diagnostic research : JCDR"}

Here we show that the scent from virgin flowers of the host Yucca glauca is sufficient to attract its obligate pollinator Tegeticula yuccasella in Y-tube olfactometer tests. Interestingly, both sexes of moths were attracted to the scent stimulus. Because yucca moths mate inside host flowers, the attraction of both females and males to host floral volatiles is likely to increase encounter rates. In a second test, female moths did not discriminate between virgin and hand-pollinated flowers, indicating no post-pollination change in scent production by the host that would lead to a reduction in pollinator attraction and thereby limit exploitation of the available seeds in host flowers. However, other mechanisms that could stabilise the mutualism between T. yuccasella and its yucca hosts have already been documented, i.e. selective abortion of heavily infested flowers, and a female-derived host-marking pheromone. Headspace collection and GC–MS were used to identify the blend of floral volatiles emitted by Y. glauca, which was found to be very similar to those of two other allopatric capsular-fruited species, Y. elata and Y. filamentosa, revealing strong conservation of this trait within Yucca section Chaenocarpa.","inCitations":["93c0436377688d65f49f5bd7396da750f7c18c94","678d6972a2172918dbdadbcee9d04ea6019bce92","c74c9c43003137aef21e08182a3a87c95a3d9f2c","d9a06a24a4cda82a9645796b15b070ca5894bac9","cfe33e21eb234c3fe72de84b1948270d8c07a0d5","1efd880ad24a7af2cd6d96f231b31e35b577f3c3","eb0629bc9243fb8fcbee7a2f153938d37c2f2824","dc541cca3890eac2bb82c17a85b75b11955914c6","4db67253879bea886cd486ae17838d2df2fab86f","bbc51da0e2cbabaa11495996c9751166450ff7f1","327a121b50304f827481c157fd3fb68c0748efa8","61b703ad75335a8e36d9ef349364b1d1472e8df9","28d1100223e1506593a4e81dbb144953016aa508","527038f04ea8476c6b4e5203d21a7415c442328e","43e6288f471b27e00bc15fb234e0f381d8e66515","a40487c6b955da3eae607213b951b3bac636755e","924b798e5b5ec610a8a4c03abfe84ffaea715889"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Pollinator attraction to volatiles from virgin and pollinated host flowers in a yucca/moth obligate mutualism","doi":"10.1111/j.1600-0706.2011.19258.x","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0706.2011.19258.x","venue":""}

J., Vol. 11, no. 2 We will be working with formulas of propositional calculus. In usual treatments of propositional calculus [2], formulas are built from statement letters and binary (two variable) connectives. These connectives are usually written as infix operators, yielding formulas like P → Q. We will also be using ternary (three variable) connectives, using prefix notation as shown below. We say two formulas are logically equivalent if the last columns of their truth tables agree. Each ternary (three variable) connective has a truth table with eight rows. There are 256 such tables and so 256 ternary connectives. We can label a connective with the hexadecimal code for the last column of its table. The truth table for [E0](P,Q,R) is shown below. P Q R [E0](P,Q,R) 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 E 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0  0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 [E0](P,Q,R) has exactly the same truth table as P ∧ (Q ∨ R). (If we like we can use single digit hexadecimal representations for the binary connectives, writing P ∧ (Q ∨ R) as P [8](Q[E]R).) Also, though this is not at all obvious, no formula with fewer than two binary connectives has the same truth table as [E0](P,Q,R). Since two is the smallest number n such that [E0](P,Q,R) is logically equivalent to a formula with n binary connectives, we say that the connective [E0] is 2-optimal. We generalize this notion in the following definition. Definition. A ternary connective [i](P,Q,R) is called n-optimal if it is logically equivalent to a formula containing n binary connectives, but not logically equivalent to any formula containing n− 1 binary connectives. It should be noted with our definition we consider only formulas with binary (two-place) connectives. Consequently, ¬P can be written as [3](P, P ) using one binary connective. The 0-ary (zero place) connectives > and ⊥ are logically equivalent to [F ](P, P ) and [0](P, P ) respectively. For the cases described above there are no logically equivalent formulas that can be constructed (using only binary connectives and statement letters) with fewer than one connective, meaning they are 1-optimal. Our goal is to find all the ternary connectives that are n-optimal for each value of n. For the initial case, we can easily find the 0-optimal connectives. Lemma 1. Every 0-optimal ternary connective [i](P,Q,R) is logically equivalent to P , Q, or R. Proof. A ternary connective is 0-optimal if it is logically equivalent to a formula consisting of zero binary connectives and a statement letter selected from the set {P,Q,R}. The only formulas of this sort are the single letter formulas P , Q, and R. RHIT Undergrad. Math. J., Vol. 11, no. 2 Page 151 Now we can take each of the three 0-optimal formulas and write out their truth table as a ternary connective. The table for the formula P is as follows. P Q R P ≡ [F0](P,Q,R) 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 The hexadecimal code for the last column is F0, so the formula P is logically equivalent to the ternary connective [F0](P,Q,R). Similar calculations for Q and R complete the proof of the following proposition. Proposition 2. There are exactly three ternary connectives that are 0-optimal. They are: [AA], [CC], and [F0]. The 1-optimal connectives are all those connectives that are not 0-optimal and are logically equivalent to a formula with one binary connective. Whenever two of these formulas are logically equivalent, they both correspond to the same ternary connective, so examining one of them is sufficient. The following lemma identifies many logically equivalent pairs. Lemma 3. Every formula of the form P [i]Q (with one binary connective) is logically equivalent to a formula of the form Q[j]P . Proof. Suppose that the binary connective [i] has a truth table whose last column contains the binary string abcd. If we like, we can write [i] as [abcd]. Let [j] be the connective [acbd]. Then P [i]Q is logically equivalent to Q[j]P , as shown in the following truth table. P Q P [i]Q Q[i]P Q[j]P 1 1 a a a 1 0 b c b 0 1 c b c 0 0 d d d Informally, swapping the middle bits in the connective and swapping the order of the letters in the formula are inverse operations. Applying Lemma 3, we can find a smaller set of formulas that still includes at least one formula that is logically equivalent to each 1-optimal ternary connective. Lemma 4. Every 1-optimal ternary connective [i](P,Q,R) is logically equivalent to a formula in the list P [j]Q P [j]R Q[j]R where 0 ≤ j ≤ F. (Here F is the hexadecimal code for 15.) Page 152 RHIT Undergrad. Math. J., Vol. 11, no. 2 Proof. A ternary connective is 1-optimal if it is logically equivalent to a formula with 1 binary connective. The entire list of formulas that contain letters taken from {P,Q,R} and one binary connective is: P [j]P , P [j]Q, P [j]R, Q[j]Q, Q[j]P , Q[j]R, R[j]R, R[j]P , R[j]Q where 0 ≤ j ≤ F. We need to show that all of these are logically equivalent to a formula of the form P [j]Q, P [j]R, or Q[j]R, where 0 ≤ j ≤ F. P [j]R, P [j]Q, and Q[j]R are already in our short list of formulas. A formula of the form P [k]P must be always true, equivalent to P , equivalent to ¬P , or always false. The following table shows that P [k]P is equivalent to a formula of the form P [j]Q for an appropriate choice of j. P Q P [F]Q P [C]Q P [3]Q P [0]Q 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 Similarly, Q[k]Q is equivalent to a formula of the form Q[j]R. Formulas of the form R[k]R are equivalent to ones of the form R[m]P , which are in turn equivalent to ones of the form P [j]R by Lemma 3. The connectives Q[j]P , R[j]P , and R[j]Q can all be addressed by Lemma 3. In light of Lemma 4, we can discover all the 1-optimal ternary connectives by examining the truth tables of the 48 formulas listed in the lemma. The total number of formulas that contain statement letters from {P,Q,R} and exactly one binary connective is much larger. Since each letter can be selected from a set of three letters and the connective is selected from a set of 16 connectives, the total number of such formulas is 3 · 16 · 3 = 144. Thus Lemma 4 substantially reduces the number of truth tables that must be checked. Even so, many of the formulas listed in Lemma 4 are logically equivalent to each other or to a 0-optimal connective. Consequently, when all 48 truth tables are computed, only 35 different 1-optimal connectives are found. We used Maple software to calculate these truth tables, verifying the following proposition. Proposition 5. There are exactly 35 ternary connectives that are 1-optimal. They are: [00] [03] [05] [0A] [0C] [0F] [11] [22] [30] [33] [3C] [3F] [44] [50] [55] [5A] [5F] [66] [77] [88] [99] [A0] [A5] [AF] [BB] [C0] [C3] [CF] [DD] [EE] [F3] [F5] [FA] [FC] [FF] For 2-optimal and 3-optimal connectives, the number of formulas to be searched increases very rapidly. The next lemma allows us to eliminate a number of connectives from our formulas, saving a substantial amount of computer time. RHIT Undergrad. Math. J., Vol. 11, no. 2 Page 153 Lemma 6. Suppose that n ≥ 2 and φ is a formula containing n binary connectives. If φ includes the connective [i] where i ∈ {0, 3, 5, [A], [C], [F]}, then there is a formula with less than n connectives which is logically equivalent to φ. Proof. We will argue by contradiction. Suppose n ≥ 2 and n is the least integer such that there is a formula φ containing exactly n connectives, at least one of which is in {0, 3, 5, [A], [C], [F]}, and no formula with fewer connectives is logically equivalent to φ. We address two cases for each proscribed connective. Case [0]A: Suppose φ is α[0]β. Then φ is logically equivalent to P [0]P , where P is a (actually any) statement letter. This contradicts the claim that φ is not equivalent to any formula with fewer connectives. Case [0]B: Suppose φ is α[i]β where β or α contains [0]. First, suppose that β contains [0]. If β contains two or more connectives, then by the minimality of n, β is logically equivalent to a formula with fewer connectives. Substituting this formula for β yields a formula with fewer than n connectives which is equivalent to φ, contradicting our hypothesis. Thus, β must be of the form P [0]Q for some choice of statement letters P and Q. Consequently, φ is α[i](P [0]Q). Suppose that the binary representation of [i] is [abcd]. Then φ = α[abcd](P [0]Q) is logically equivalent to α[bbdd]γ for any choice of γ, as shown by the following truth table. α γ α[abcd]γ P [0]Q α[abcd](P [0]Q) α[bbdd]γ 1 1 a 0 b b 1 0 b 0 b b 0 1 c 0 d d 0 0 d 0 d d In particular, φ is logically equivalent to α[bbdd]P which has fewer connectives than φ, yielding another contradiction and completing the case when β contains [0]. By Lemma 3, the situation where α contains [0] also yields a contradiction. Case [F]A: Suppose φ is α[F]β. This case is similar to Case [0]A, except φ is equivalent to P [F]P . Case [F]B: Suppose φ is α[i]β where β or α contains [F]. This case is similar to case [0]B except α[abcd]β is logically equivalent to α[aacc]P . Case [3]A: Suppose φ is α[3]β. Then φ is logically equivalent to ¬α. If α is a statement letter (say P ), then ¬α is equivalent to P [3]P . If α is not a statement letter, then α has the form γ[i]δ where [i] is [abcd]. In this situation, ¬α is equivalent to γ[āb̄c̄d̄]δ where s̄ = 1 − s for","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://scholar.rose-hulman.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1131&context=rhumj"],"title":"Fall 2010 Calibrating the Complexity of Ternary Propositional Connectives","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

The data can be provided by observation, experiment or knowledge; their nature can be numerical, qualitative or logical. First, the classical view of the context of data representation, in which the algorithm of hierarchical ascendant construction of the classification tree is set, is treated in a synthetic manner. The main notion in our method is one of 'similarity'. This must be elaborated in the best way, taking into account the mathematical nature of the objects to be compared. Here we adopt a set of theoretical and combinatorial representation of the descriptive attributes, which are interpreted in terms of relations. Then we introduce a probability scale for similarity measurement by using a likelihood concept. The largest part of the paper concerns an illustrating example, moderately sized, detailing very minutely the different steps and the different calculations assumed by the method. The data structure handled with this example is the simplest possible. Then, general aspects and methodological extensions are evoked. We end by indicating the interest of the described approach in future works, in which we are involved, concerning typological organization of genetic sequences. We emphasize the 'explanation' aspect of the obtained results, with respect to a given description. For this purpose, classifications (on the object set and on the attribute set) on the one hand and machine learning techniques on the other, intervene efficiently.","inCitations":["22345593acce3198fde929c9127c557ec51b2777","0c14701fc00aaf487ea2678f6a83889f148be716","9e441b03673dc3dbfc409a47cd2009865c65ba56","0d4f54724cc457ac462c897aebbf948fa8d81a33","82ecfe8fb35f07ca7d491ada41d2695573f7c7a6","db6ad809934fafc40720a2e84b426c23ec24da9c","ecdaceb914696953a5aa79cc96ff0aa55ad06da9","44d71be492b9806a894e35321659626b7ebcf2a3","d31b62329705be859c1d28a31333206eb966fe53","96e09459317abd674e65df0a9f8c6b20a97320a0","7a9c352f172bb9b88796404d2365b44b104e30f7","bf40e19347411c388d44190447c428680efecd36","4cfbb910f92e3252c375a5b340b26580c0b182f8","de2faaedf6be81eb4d07b3b3beca6ffee832f3ea","85213de7ab4fea5a5f3efccc2350cce214712f9e","4646641eb9e33b3038a58d2ef3099e5bbd5c26a1","f1d597d979c237d5f7ffa6ecefbd5e9956175e2c","2ecd8b65de173adf5a3c8a00a3a2c525b2660193","099fde0313009a024b9445e7319b1671d92551b7","381f93eab468f263702473f69aea6d1b839425db","5627048cc647b8372829b9e314f9a933a3fb034c","4cafd1f6428d5ae450c9a47b1c6a842c6362d9e7","63feab61569dd0c8d7158e72355b091d4c0a30fa","2938226d0fc9de04eb247cb5501886c12c87ea0c"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Likelihood linkage analysis (LLA) classification method: an example treated by hand.","doi":"10.1016/0300-9084(93)90172-O","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/0300-9084%2893%2990172-O","venue":"Biochimie"}

In the isolated colonic mucosa of Bufo arenarum, under special circumstances, there is a variable fraction of the short-circuit current (0-38%) that is unaccounted for by either the Na or the Cl and bicarbonate transmembrane net fluxes.2. The hypothesis that a special kind of bicarbonate transport may account for the non-Na component of the short-circuit current was investigated. According to this, bicarbonate ions formed within the membrane await transport towards the mucosal solution within a compartment that does not undergo isotopic exchange with the serosal bathing solution. This kind of transport may be detected by a lowering of mucosal specific activity of bicarbonate but would not be revealed by the classic method of comparing the difference between the unidirectional fluxes with the short-circuit current.3. The specific activity of bicarbonate was determined in the inside solution (initially bicarbonate-free) of ten normal and four everted colonic sacs incubated in an external medium (reservoir) containing a constant specific activity of bicarbonate. Comparison between membrane-to-internal solution bicarbonate flux and non-Na component of the short-circuit current was carried out in two different ways: (a) by measuring the remaining short-circuit current in Na-free medium and (b) by determining simultaneously the Na net flux.4. Whatever the value of the short-circuit current and its non-Na component, there is no reduction of the specific activity of the bicarbonate appearing in the inside solution of the everted colonic sacs.5. In the normal sacs there is a reduction of the specific activity of bicarbonate which accounts for a membrane-to-mucosa bicarbonate flux which parallels the variations of the non-Na component of the short-circuit current although quantitatively representing only 68-87% of it.6. There is no systematic decrease in the rate of reduction of the mucosal specific activity of bicarbonate in successive experimental flux periods; this excludes a slow equilibration of the intracellular bicarbonate with serosal bicarbonate.7. Other possible explanations of the present results are discussed, as well as the availability and hydration rate of metabolic CO(2) necessary to account for this kind of bicarbonate transport.","inCitations":["142367672e321615faceb87a986fd13ee103e3d0","cc665fb563f5eb320eddb67e35f5429873244ed4","a9b9fea3690f92df518f2c590390d31ab1b9f42f","a82c44cc5be8ea4b7bfb406eadf0b0c1fcc9524b","4737f82c5990d719080cd907f0486d3a5ed3ce61"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Bicarbonate secretion and non-Na component of the short-circuit current in the isolated colonic mucosa of Bufo arenarum.","doi":"10.1113/jphysiol.1970.sp009029","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1113/jphysiol.1970.sp009029","venue":"The Journal of physiology"}

This evidence takes the form of in situ analyses [1-4], previous and continuing Earth-based telescopic spectroscopic observations [e.g. 5,6], Viking Lander and Orbiter multispectral imaging [7-10], and Phobos-2 multispectral imaging [11,12]. Information regarding the crystalline or amorphous nature of the iron-bearing (and other) surface materials on Mars can provide insight into the availability of liquid water at the surface and the duration, mode, and extent of weathering. Data from Viking X-ray fluorescence analyses, magnetic experiments, and aerosol imaging were interpreted as indicating the presence of a variety of iron-rich materials, including iron oxides [ 1-4,13]. However, since the Viking Landers did not carry any instruments capable of determining mineralogy, the exact mineralogical form of the iron'bearing material remains uncertain. Interpretations of continuing visual, near-, midand far-infrared spectroscopic observations of Mars from the Earth and spacecraft over the past 20 years have revealed that the ferric mineralogy occurs in two distinct forms: (1) nanophase or truly amorphous Fea+-bearing materials [14,15] that spectrally resemble certain terrestrial palagonites [e.g. 16-20]; and (2) well-crystalline ferric oxides like hematite (_-Fe203), maghemite (7-Fe203) ' or magnetite (Fe304) [1,13,15, 21-24]. The available data indicate that the poorly-crystalline \"palagonite-like\" phases are spectrally dominant [e.g. 5,6] and that the well crystalline ferric oxides cannot constitute an abundance of more than about 4-8 wt. % [24]. The research presented here represents the initial phase of a broader project that is intended to provide data in the midand far-infrared spectral region for both well-characterized iron oxides/oxyhydroxides and poorly crystalline or amorphous materials (e.g. palagonites). Such information can be used in the interpretation of past and future thermal infrared observations of Mars. Spectral Studies: In the middle infrared (5-25 #m), spectral features arise from vibrational motions of atoms and molecules which compose the materials. These fundamental modes are much more intense than any associated combination and/or overtones of these modes and hence remote sensing observations in the infrared are extremely sensitive to minor concentrations of these absorbing species [25]. Careful laboratory studies have shown that the coloring agent in certain Mars analog Hawaiian palagonitic soils is nanophase iron oxide [18,19,26]. We have measured the emissivity of two Mauna Kea palagonitic soils whose transmission spectra exhibit different spectral features [27] and of a thermally-altered volcanic tephra sample that exhibits a wide range of crystallinity and degree of alteration (from black cinders to fully hematitic) [19]. Both of these samples may represent analogs for formation mechanisms involving the production of highly-altered secondary weathering products on Mars. The emission spectra of all samples were measured at the TES spectroscopy laboratory [28] at Arizona State University with the cooperation of Dr. Phil Christensen. The data were converted to emissivity using blackbody measurements combined with measurements of each sample at different temperatures [29].","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19940030946.pdf"],"title":"3 o 7 , 0 .

The aim was to detect expression of perforin in both decidual lymphocytes (DL) and peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) in the first trimester of pathological pregnancies: Anembryonic pregnancy and missed abortion.\n\n\nMETHOD\nDecidual tissue from a normal pregnancy group and from pathological pregnancies was obtained by vaginal curettage. Perforin (an intracellular antigen) and the cell surface antigens CD3, CD4, CD8, CD16, CD56, CD11c, and CD45RA were quantified simultaneously by flow cytometric analysis.\n\n\nRESULTS\nIn the missed abortion group, we found: 1) a relative decrease in the frequency of both CD4+P+ cells and CD56+P+ cells as well as the mean fluorescence intensity for perforin; 2) a relative increase of CD16+P+ PBL cells; and 3) a relative increase of CD4+ cells in PBL compared with anembryonic pregnancy and normal pregnancy. There was also a significant relative decrease in the proportion of CD4+ and CD8+ cells among perforin-positive PBL in both anembryonic pregnancy and missed abortion.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nOur results show that significant decreases in the prevalence of perforin-positive lymphoid cells, their subpopulations, and mean fluorescence intensity for perforin are associated with pregnancy failure.","inCitations":["ac5a783a4c5e1acf88a4b15a0222165f08442f13","05d5d8a7d2e955f2fbd73cbde3f7ec14125f6678","033d0b211dbc1587f31100919a09084d76d166ed","290da0c646d3343341247defb4f9c73447dad5c9","68e5657bd5e1f77a68e0ffc82edd6db96adb1a39","9a113ece97b0260195eab05b5fcec3753a7ec7e1","821c8053a829f7fbcd0beb029d0d5a02696c0fe5","467dc8ff99eda8ee5e298c5aa0a8eb405a26d6fa","9ff9ce79b157ad35219269773f315fb6b209b18b","d1c7a67761d2161fe1f3ac899b70e23858517243","2a2e06c82e1c9161d5afb8a9042547d56d805c2a","80ea67c2f17a438354ca1ab1753d4070ea06b85c","db53fa6b4882974e5d8c5c7a6988582b4823f995","6628ebaa80c3da30b5507d5d87a1d6398acfbfff"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Perforin-expressing lymphocytes in peripheral blood and decidua of human first-trimester pathological pregnancies.","doi":"10.1111/j.1600-0897.1997.tb00270.x","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0897.1997.tb00270.x","venue":"American journal of reproductive immunology"}

Aims To investigate the prevalence of mental disorders in early pregnancy and the diagnostic accuracy of depression-screening (Whooley) questions compared with the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), against the Structured Clinical Interview DSM-IV-TR.\n\n\nMETHOD\nCross-sectional survey of women responding to Whooley questions asked at their first antenatal appointment. Women responding positively and a random sample of women responding negatively were invited to participate.\n\n\nRESULTS\nPopulation prevalence was 27% (95% CI 22-32): 11% (95% CI 8-14) depression; 15% (95% CI 11-19) anxiety disorders; 2% (95% CI 1-4) obsessive-compulsive disorder; 0.8% (95% CI 0-1) post-traumatic stress disorder; 2% (95% CI 0.4-3) eating disorders; 0.3% (95% CI 0.1-1) bipolar disorder I, 0.3% (95% CI 0.1-1%) bipolar disorder II; 0.7% (95% CI 0-1) borderline personality disorder. For identification of depression, likelihood ratios were 8.2 (Whooley) and 9.8 (EPDS). Diagnostic accuracy was similar in identifying any disorder (likelihood ratios 5.8 and 6).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nEndorsement of Whooley questions in pregnancy indicates the need for a clinical assessment of diagnosis and could be implemented when maternity professionals have been appropriately trained on how to ask the questions sensitively, in settings where a clear referral and care pathway is available.

By using the method based on the experimental gradient matrix, the activity of slip systems was obtained in magnesium single crystals deformed to shear strain 1.2γ, where well developed stage B of work hardening was observed. It was shown that primary (0001)⟨1120⟩ slip system was dominant in the whole investigated range of the examined deformation. The observation and analysis of etch pits on the {1210} plane showed the heterogeneous distribution of dislocations formed during deformation into walls of dislocations perpendicular to the (0001) slip plane. The suggested model of work hardening of magnesium single crystals, which is worth taking into consideration, shows the in uence of the long-range stress eld derivating from the groups of dislocations arranged in dislocation walls.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://przyrbwn.icm.edu.pl/APP/PDF/122/a122z3p26.pdf"],"title":"Work Hardening of Magnesium Single Crystals Deformed to Stage B at Room Temperature","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

The components of the interior MP(…1(M)) of AH(…1(M)) (as a subset of the appropriate representation variety) are enumerated by the spaceA(M) of marked homeomorphism types of oriented, compact, irreducible 3-manifolds homotopy equivalent to M. In this paper, we give a topological enumeration of the components of the closure of MP(…1(M)) and hence a conjectural topological enumeration of the components of AH(…1(M)). We do so by characterizing exactly which changes of marked homeomorphism type can occur in the algebraic limit of a sequence of isomorphic freely indecomposable Kleinian groups. We use this enumeration to exhibit manifolds M for which AH(…1(M)) has inflnitely many components. In this paper, we begin a study of the global topology of deformation spaces of Kleinian groups. The basic object of study is the space AH(…1(M)) of marked hyperbolic 3-manifolds homotopy equivalent to a flxed compact 3manifold M. The interior MP(…1(M)) of AH(…1(M)) is very well understood due to work of Ahlfors, Bers, Kra, Marden, Maskit, Sullivan and Thurston. In particular, the components ofMP(…1(M)) are enumerated by topological data, namely the set A(M) of marked, compact, oriented, irreducible 3-manifolds homotopy equivalent to M, while each component is parametrized by analytic data coming from the conformal boundaries of the hyperbolic 3-manifolds. Thurston’s Ending Lamination Conjecture provides a conjectural classiflcation for elements of AH(…1(M)) by data which are partially topologi","inCitations":["c401783786587bfde7bac3b3caa2c473b41194f7","c6447cb00cff9c4d202ba8b75d1e5b258e85685e","9a3af6a3aa8348e8263fe3f3b93f0c52fc915187","a607105c1f0512a91b18161808f2f09ca947938e","58a307982568cdc2316d73ec891cbbe92169a049","97d883d61978da5f1933049881f5b72277023d8b","6641a034c0a61c7f75788e65c90f4444f8d58a1e","26a2c0c4358bc29c450a5668afc4cc1005785fc6","ee946840b831d2d7aa3b5fe8e6fd37025f8c8d6e","9128ebf74eb6b3ce705af7047dec536937db9654","d1fec2b951fe7653b3af51cfe383ce34dd25796f","22d5192541eada6cd4410e7a38049c53a4c5bcbf","1a1a066d9ce069a609a6f42706eec4fab8fdb4af","6d72d3d6b4c00ec9654a107dd4f596e9b12db826","b45e911d7407c13cab25a7cb0a196d7124457018","7e362be0f486b915be66df852d69e3da93c8eb77","e6bc473425c340e260b3c6bc031543cacdeed9e6","9304aeeed161ca738aee548e437e21b17787a3e0","76215d0c5b541708a327e0772c24f1e234c8ac71","8c5808f0109a64728d7f85b3581684519cf4d42f","57d46169de9a3be63e9d56fbcd049c57d6a9ded1","df72d3f40065b9c5f85bca3e70eb3c72d5cc3457","5cf2ba78b8a8beb3503024aeba7c859c9488e84b","df6c56eae7fc59a3d26fd244ea748f57e8519aa9","76a4785e39434156cad108d15ca20fbf04f495d6","df8b9a309fab08d85922395e798d818879bd3ee7","e103c6000bfef42ab0a89cef930c44c209e78403","ba3caa2391b19ccaa5e539cf79183c644a7fc444","c4e6b1e3370988a20590fa9af827d466d7a6d52c","4e27ff4a8819773963d1aebd3517dcb8f071dcbd","3ac8a7076ea8bcdfab5b8bbaac7025af1c5d796d","f3fd77f9c8b243c8fb7413bf079352d8d9b12238","fdacea4806c193c38bce6aa25e00986e2d3d91d6"],"pdfUrls":["https://arxiv.org/pdf/math/9806079v2.pdf","https://www.univie.ac.at/EMIS/journals/Annals/152_3/anderson.pdf","http://www.maths.soton.ac.uk/~jwa/preprints/shuffling.ps.gz","http://arxiv.org/pdf/math/9806079v1.pdf","https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/29872/1/topology_deformation.pdf","http://arxiv.org/pdf/math/9806079v2.pdf","http://www.maths.soton.ac.uk/staff/Anderson/paper_files/topology_deformation.pdf"],"title":"The topology of deformation spaces of Kleinian groups","doi":"10.2307/2661352","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.2307/2661352","venue":""}

The situation is more ambiguous in large groundwater bodies located in the eastern part of the country, where the unsaturated zone increases from near zero along the edges to about 40 m in the centre of the area. As depth of the unsaturated zone increases, groundwater level reacts with an increasing delay to fluctuations in climate and influences of human activities. The aim of the present paper is to model groundwater level fluctuations in these areas using a linear stochastic transfer function model, relating groundwater levels to estimated precipitation excess, and to separate artificial components from the natural groundwater regime. In this way, the impact of groundwater withdrawal and the reclamation of a 1000 km2 polder area on the groundwater levels in the adjoining higher ground could be assessed. It became evident that the linearity assumption of the transfer functions becomes a serious drawback in areas with the deepest groundwater levels, because of non-linear processes in the deep unsaturated zone and the non-synchronous arrival of recharge in the saturated zone. Comparison of the results from modelling the influence of reclamation with an analytical solution showed that the lowering of groundwater level is partly compensated by reduced discharge and therefore is less than expected.","inCitations":["2e408734a241722afd24a390a918e4fed288f2ad","26aebc7c60012b79d226ed954b7ae67e61ccf6da","dfbfd691061749266160fdac22f7f8999cddeecb","33e118ea745fbd107f15ad2a1bd2d1ed77b634ab","d59ef7c43b2837b9068a95a8d769d4234c73c4a4","9f2e17960fc4463da48fbb57498d71e999e93586","4f1dc87f9e2aa812af9e6b888bfbc8a67ee5e989","eb0d04d19c40ea8d3ff0faffb0e3cc436627af2a","5f8530b7331add9d9f8a8998c34679d1f5d00ca7","00efe2da3b41623e8b6bff545260c724f6555f97","7c653b4619433e7ba582efb2bccf40ca8c215d01","036c895dfd307667ba6aca539a38c0660a7d4b97","d9d9c865fd1e650edf2c0061de0d00458ec1e5b5","c449b83003a42a82242df4197886c50957c6bdee","3e816e671d082b99bf7a4ef8936194ddf2c6a2a7","6028b246aee043ba5f98513ef326c767260c8aeb"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Decomposition of groundwater level fluctuations using transfer modelling in an area with shallow to deep unsaturated zones","doi":"10.1016/0022-1694(94)90101-5","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/0022-1694%2894%2990101-5","venue":""}
