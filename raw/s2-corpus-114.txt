The opposing view is that womens status was good in many (not all) Third World societies in the past and that the structure and ideology of male dominance were introduced as corollaries of colonialism. Furthermore accumulating evidence shows that although contemporary development may afford political and professional roles for a few token women given its imperialist context it continues to undermine the status and autonomy of the vast majority (Boserup 1970; Bossen 1975; Nash 1975; Remy 1975; Rubbo 1975). The discuss the impact of development on womens status in society therefore means to confront the reality that womens oppression is inextricably bound up with a world system of exploitation. To analyze the status of women in order to change it is to analyze the need for and possibility of the most fundamental social transformation.

Due to nonlinear characteristics of PV cells, the maximum allowable power level from PV panel changes with atmospheric parameters which are solar irradiance and temperature. In this context, maximum power point tracking (MPPT) algorithms are essential to maximize the output power of PV panel for any solar irradiance and temperature values. In the literature, various MPPT techniques have been studied to deliver maximum power from PV systems. Hence, this study discusses intelligent control techniques, which are called fuzzy logic controller (FLC) and neural network controller (NNC), and compares efficiency performance and convergence speed to conventional perturb & observe (P&O) and incremental conductance (Inc. Cond.) tracking techniques for MPPT of PV system. In this paper, 150W PV panel model is investigated for different atmospheric conditions in MATLAB. Results of simulation show that NNC based and FLC based MPPTs have 4.66% better tracking accuracy than conventional P&O and Inc. Cond. under standard test condition (STC). NNC based MPPT has best iteration response rate among the other MPPTs under uniform atmospheric conditions. Therefore, the NNC based MPPT presents best superior quality in terms of efficiency and convergence speed for PV systems among the other MPPTs.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://dergipark.org.tr/en/download/article-file/826681"],"title":"An Investigation of Intelligent and Conventional Maximum Power Point Tracking Techniques for Uniform Atmospheric Conditions","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Thus far, most researches on the cooperative transmission have been studied from the reliability point of view focusing on a single transmission and showing that the cooperative transmission can increase transmission reliability. In this paper, we study the effects of the cooperative transmission from the system throughput and fairness point of view, considering the following fundamental questions: Is the cooperative transmission always helpful to increase the system throughput and improve the degree of fairness among nodes? If not, when is it helpful to increase the system throughput and improve the degree of fairness among nodes? We provide the answers to the above questions with a simple system in which two source nodes are capable of being cooperative with each other by using the decode-and-forward cooperative scheme to transmit their data to a single destination node.","inCitations":["3e9482dcca1420704230a7a24b9b5a84f91f4700","824b87f57d44b3bd5846f9df599861ce227cb44f"],"pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2012.121008"],"title":"To Cooperate or Not to Cooperate: System Throughput and Fairness Perspective","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2012.121008","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2012.121008","venue":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications"}

It is believed, that MSCs could be transformed into cancer stem cells spontaneously or under influence of genotoxic factors and trigger the growth of tumors. The aim of this work was to study the possibility of malignant transformation of cultured MSCs from murine bone marrow (MSCs-BM) after g-irradiation in vitro and characterize of biochemical and histological features of the tumors that developed after transplantation of MSCs-BM into syngeneic mice. Tumors were observed in 3—4 months after MSCs-BM transplantation. After administration of MSCs-BM irradiated at a dose of 1 Gy, tumors were seen in 2 of 5 mice. After transplantation of MSCs-BM irradiated at a dose of 6 Gy, tumors were found in all 5 of 5 mice. In the case of control MSCs-BM, only one tumor appeared in 6 months after transplantation. The telomerase activity was two times higher in the tumor developed from 6 Gy irradiated MSCs-BM than from 1 Gy irradiated MSCs-BM. The tumors developed from control and irradiated MSCs-BM were classified as multicomponent mesenchymomas («mixture of sarcomas»). Histological examination showed that tumors contained tissue areas of different histogenesis. Thus, MSCs-BM g-irradiated at doses of 1 and 6 Gy and, much less frequently, control MSCs-BM can transform into tumor cells and induce development of multicomponent mesenchymomas.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Characteristics of Tumors That Developed in Mice after Treatment with Irradiated Syngeneic Mesenchymal Stem Cells of Bone Marrow.","doi":"","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"Tsitologiia"}

Genotyping ntethods include ribotyping, insertiort sequence (lS) 200 fingerprinting and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). In addition to providing a genomic fingerprint PFGE can be used in conjunction with gene probing to locate specific DNA sequences of interest such as rRNA or antibiotic resistance genes. More recently the applicability of a range of PCR-basecl methods including rep-PCR, ERIC-PCR and RAP-D have been assessecl.

Unfortunately, no generic approach integrates all the theoretical needs. So we finally propose a new way to embody all these identified requirements through a combinatorial paradigm. This metaheuristics based technique consists in selecting reliable and consistent subsets of discrete data which lead to the most “plausible” local minimums of a given regression problem. Among these local minimums, we may expect the best one (in a certain sense) to be the global solution if we are purchasing a single correct fit...

No recorte temporal trabalhado, 1889 a 1931, houve um embate sobre o modelo ideal de soldado (militar) a ser formado nessas escolas: se um soldado-cidadao, preparado para enfrentar questoes intelectuais e politicas do seu tempo; ou um soldado-profissional, afastado do ativismo politico, respeitoso da hierarquia e da disciplina, e voltado apenas para o manejo de armas e preparo para a guerra. Porem, todas essas duas nocoes de soldado apresentaram-se marcadas por inumeros valores identificados ao militar e interligados ao campo mitico, como rituais de passagem e cotidianos; cerimonias civicas; culto a personagens historicos como modelos de soldado; uso de uniformes; alem da constituicao de uma serie de simbolos que buscavam nortear condutas. Assim, o objetivo desta pesquisa foi compreender a relacao dos mitos e ritos constituidos nas escolas militares com a construcao de um modelo identitario de oficial do Exercito. A metodologia compos-se da analise e fichamento das fontes, buscando compor conjuntos de informacoes que ajudaram a entender determinadas construcoes miticas sobre o militar. Foram utilizadas fontes primarias, com destaque para a documentacao produzida pelas Escolas Militares do Ceara, do Rio de Janeiro (Praia Vermelha) e do Rio Grande do Sul. Utilizaram-se, tambem, impressos, como revistas e jornais, produzidos pelos alunos das escolas militares, bem como publicacoes memorialisticas de ex-alunos. Dado que os “mitos” e os “ritos” foram as perspectivas por meio das quais se propos compreender a formacao nas Escolas Militares, buscou-se um aporte teorico em autores do campo da Antropologia que discutiram esses conceitos. A pesquisa apontou que tanto a formacao baseada no modelo de soldado-cidadao como a formacao baseada no modelo do soldado-profissional foram marcadas por valores que buscavam dar uma identificacao ao militar e nortear-lhe condutas e papeis a serem desempenhados. Conclui-se que, no recorte temporal analisado, a identidade militar constituiu-se de forma dinâmica, mas sempre ligada ao campo dos mitos, ritos e tradicoes.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Escolas Militares do Exército: a formação, seus mitos e ritos (1889 - 1931)","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

At the core of this model is the assumption that bilateral parietal cortex hosts an approximate number system that codes for the cardinal value of perceived numerals. I will review studies that ask whether or not the numerical coding within this system is invariant to varying input notation, format, or modality, and whether or not the observed parietal activity is number-specific over and above the parietal involvement in response-related processes. Extant computational models of numerosity (the number of objects in a set) perception are summarized and related to empirical data from human neuroimaging and monkey neurophysiology.","inCitations":["8d682cd5dd53990de274ee3682d799d3e3e3e73f","76dcc0d9b2c699cff81190fa15c96139df5a6954","2663a2b0b11a31b8870af079d18315f02e9e41bd","00f03b339390db4b9bc5f6934b4a6893b0a61651","390595639c046ca615f3f6c7e14ec9606afaa979","96417caed378b64d781ab3e615a250f53db57151","af0bf747f72cdee33ebccc49c8aeada74d79fca0"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Probing the Neural Correlates of Number Processing","doi":"10.1177/1073858416650153","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1177/1073858416650153","venue":"The Neuroscientist : a review journal bringing neurobiology, neurology and psychiatry"}

Environmental heterogeneity may constrain or change the optimal strategy and thereby alter baseline immune function (possibly mediated by stress responses). We tested several hypotheses relating variation in climatic, ecological, and social environments to chronic stress and levels of baseline innate immunity in a wild, cooperatively breeding bird, the purple-crowned fairy-wren (Malurus coronatus coronatus). From samples collected biannually over 5 yr, we quantified three indexes of constitutive innate immune function (haptoglobin/PIT54, natural antibodies, complement activity) and one index of chronic stress (heterophil-lymphocyte ratio; n=513-647 ). Using an information-theoretic and multimodel inference statistical approach, we found that habitat quality and social group size did not affect any immune index, despite hypothesized links to resource abundance and parasite pressure. Rather, short-term variation in temperature and rainfall was related to immune function, while overall differences between seasons were small or absent, despite substantial seasonal variation in climate. Contrary to our expectation, we found no evidence that physiological stress mediated any effects of short-term climatic variables on immune indexes, and alternative mechanisms may be involved. Our results may be interpreted from the perspective of reactive scope models, whereby predictive homeostasis maintains standing immune function relative to long-term demands, while short-term environmental change, being less predictable, has a greater influence on baseline immune function.","inCitations":["42f790362558ea2e3ad808cee04ea0c091465218"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Short-Term Climate Variation Drives Baseline Innate Immune Function and Stress in a Tropical Bird: A Reactive Scope Perspective.","doi":"10.1086/702310","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1086/702310","venue":"Physiological and biochemical zoology : PBZ"}

The mass loading of the transducer is attached to the long process of the incus in the form of floating mass transducer (FMT) or applied near the incus-stapes joint by a magnet of contactless electromagnetic transducer (CLT). By changing placement of the transducer, crimping connection and damping parameter of the crimping mechanism, theoretical performances of the transducers were investigated on mechanical characteristics in two aspects: (1) displacement change at the stapes footplate, which describes the change in hearing due to placement of the transducer; (2) the equivalent pressure output of the transducer, which relates the footplate displacement driven by transducer to the sound pressure applied to a normal ear to produce that displacement. For the FMT with a less tight crimping connection or low supporting rigidity, a large drop of the sound-induced stapes displacement occurs at a specific frequency, with a peak reduction about 25.8 dB. A tight connection or high supporting rigidity shifts the drop of the stapes displacement to higher frequency. For the CLT, an electromagnetic transducer of 25 mg placed near the incus-stapes joint produces a maximum decrease of the stapes displacement around 16.5 dB. The equivalent sound pressure output and electromagnetic force requirement are proposed to produce the stapes displacement equivalent to that ear canal sound stimulus. The drop of the footplate displacement caused by mass loading effect can be recovered by the transducer stimulation over frequency range from 1500 Hz to 4000 Hz. The FE analysis reveals that enhancing the coupling stiffness between the clip and the ossicular chain is much helpful for maximizing the efficiency of the transducer stimulation.","inCitations":["a607143ba6bb6de181b4e9e5efbc3439d11b93d1","cffa959c8c721fed496569f6effbee635502a774","dd747b7059642416db2242fc6754afc783e9f6f6","e0cc3a8e20d39bef0f1bd1c96786f710f72dfc0e","ca2184ebbaf4b70059e95e10298c4a8d951b077b","ea6d4df322d47cdc24fc0bf419ac13e4d7b78755","7c620a008a0c9ea92acbe2ae75de1b2d6e66b90b","05bbb0a246ed5ca99b99ca9cca0379d24a78863c"],"pdfUrls":["https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378595511001146","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378595511001146?dgcid=api_sd_search-api-endpoint"],"title":"Finite element analysis of the coupling between ossicular chain and mass loading for evaluation of implantable hearing device","doi":"10.1016/j.heares.2011.04.012","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heares.2011.04.012","venue":"Hearing Research"}

En total se obtuvieron 1054 cuestionarios que responden varios temas sobre convivencia con animales. Como resultado se identifico que el animal es valorado como miembro de la familia por parte del custodio, independientemente de su raza, gasto mensual que genera o numero de hijos existentes en el nucleo familiar. Los resultados evidencian que las personas valoran y perciben como beneficiosa la compania y convivencia con perros y gatos.

Es wird gezeigt, daß im Falle von ferromagnetischem Nickel und Kobalt sowie bei gewissen ferromagnetischen Legierungen diese Schwierigkeiten zum Teil überwunden und der Restwiderstand von Gitterfehlern in guter Näherung berechnet werden kann. Die Sonderstellung dieser nicht-einwertigen Metalle hängt damit zusammen, daß der elektrische Strom überwiegend durch jene 4s-Elektronen getragen wird, deren Spinrichtung parallel zur Magnetisierungsrichtung ist.Die Rechnungen werden für Gitterlücken in Nickel durchgeführt und ergeben gute Übereinstimmung mit dem gemessenen Zusatzwiderstand pro Atom. Die Bildungsenergie von Gitterlücken in Ni kann heute noch nicht ohne Zusatzannahmen berechnet werden. Durch eine vergleichende Diskussion der experimentellen Daten und der theoretischen Möglichkeiten kann jedoch gezeigt werden, daß sowohl für die Energie von Gitterlücken als auch für die Kohäsionsenergie metallischen Nickels die homöopolare Bindung zwischen den 3d- Elektronen benachbarter Atome ganz wesentlich ist.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Elektronentheoretische Untersuchungen über Fehlstellen in Metallen","doi":"10.1007/BF01327658","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/BF01327658","venue":""}

Serial plastinated whole-organ sections of 34 normal adult larynges were examined. A cartilaginous crest subdivided the ALSAC into a cranial triangular fossa and a caudal oblong fossa and provided attachment to the lateral fibers of the vocal cord. The thyroarytenoid muscle was mainly anchored within the oblong fossa, but a few lateral muscle fibers extended further cranial ward along the ALSAC. The triangular fossa was the area of fixation of the vestibular ligament and was filled with adipose tissue as well as mucous glands grouped together by strong collagenous fiber septa. These septa revealed a craniocaudal orientation medially and a horizontal anteroposterior orientation laterally. These findings suggest that the septa guide early local cancer extension parallel to their own arrangement, acting as barriers that cannot be easily crossed. Correspondingly, cranial and horizontal-lateral cancer spread along the ALSAC has been reported in the clinical literature.","inCitations":["33f40a72e684f7832b9a65e7f549311a94c4e9b2"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Topographical anatomy and oncologic implications of the anterolateral surface of the arytenoid cartilage","doi":"10.1007/s004050050031","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s004050050031","venue":"European Archives of Oto-Rhino-Laryngology"}

The island fox is classified as a threatened species by the State of California, and recently three of the six subspecies have experienced abrupt population declines. As part of a continuing effort to determine the cause of the declines, we tested island fox serum samples collected in 1988 (n = 176) and 1997–98 (n = 156) over the entire geographic range of the species for seroprevalence of canine heartworm (Dirofilaria immitis) antigen. Using a commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (PetChek®, Idexx Laboratories, Westbrook, Maine, USA) we detected heartworm antigen in four of the six populations of island foxes. On San Miguel and Santa Rosa Islands, seroprevalence in adult foxes was >85% (n = 62) in 1988 and increased to 100% (n = 24) in 1997–98. On Santa Cruz Island, seroprevalence in adult foxes decreased from 83% (n = 30) to 58% (n = 26), whereas on San Nicolas Island, seroprevalence increased from 25% (n = 32) to 77% (n = 30) during the same period. All of the pups assayed (n = 33) were seronegative. The seroprevalences of heartworm reported herein for the four populations of island foxes are the highest yet reported for a fox species.

In particular, the potential role of miR-21 was focused on in this study.Methods: Thirty cholesteatoma tissues were processed for RNA and cell culture. Cholesteatoma keratinocytes were transfected with miR-21 mimics, miR-21 inhibitors, or negative control miRNAs; and growth curves were drawn. RT-PCR was used to assess the expression levels of miR-21. EdU incorporation assay and TUNEL staining were used to assess the proliferation and apoptosis of cholesteatoma keratinocytes, respectively.

Furthermore, there is also an effect on the water cycle, the biogeochemical cycle and the climate. Especially land use practices like non-adjusted agricultural methods, overgrazing and degradation of the vegetation cover through deforestation are the main driving forces for desertification. The present study examines how different agricultural practices in Binh Thuan province, Vietnam, influence soil fertility. The region is characterised by sandy soils as well as a semi-arid climate which complicates agricultural production. In order to improve soil fertility and subsequently crop yields and economic development in the coastal area, sustainable management practices are needed. To evaluate which sustainability strategies are applied in the area and how peanut and dragon fruit cultivations influence soil properties, soil analyses for different soil parameters were combined with a socio-scientific survey based on quantitative interviews and a SWOT analysis. Results show that most farms apply conventional farming together with different sustainable agricultural practices but are threatened through local environmental conditions. Furthermore, a higher amount of total organic carbon, total nitrogen as well as dissolved organic carbon directly next to the dragon fruit indicates that dragon fruit cultivation contributes more to soil fertility than peanut cultivation. This is especially through the application of mulch around the plant which increases the humus content in soil and keeps the nutrients from leaching. To conclude, desertification due to human impacts and climate change is an ongoing local and global problem. For that reason, agricultural practices adapted to environmental conditions become even more important and should be accelerated even in the frame of the SDGs (Sustainable Development Goals).","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://www.tropentag.de/2017/abstracts/full/581.pdf","http://www.tropentag.de/2017/abstracts/posters/581.pdf","http://www.tropentag.de/2017/abstracts/links/Rabitz_5YYACzgL.pdf"],"title":"Soil fertility and agricultural sustainability strategies in the desertified area of Binh Thuan , Vietnam","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Apart from graphical illustrations, this latter task is performed by the effect coefficients proposed by Boyd. This contribution demonstrates that these coefficients under certain circumstances can exaggerate the effect of short-term influences on the vote, proposes a modified formula, and shows how normal vote analysis can be adapted to comprise the notion of statistically controlling for third short-term forces. Finally, an attempt is made formally to relate the effect coefficients of normal vote analysis to the decomposition of variance in multiple regression analysis. It is demonstrated that such a formal relationship cannot be established, so that in terms of variance decomposition normal vote analysis is incapable of precisely and numerically comparing short-term vs. long-term influences on the vote, or of comparing short-term effects across different variables or even across different samples.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Normal Vote Analysis: A Methodological Note","doi":"10.1111/j.1475-6765.1984.tb00089.x","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1475-6765.1984.tb00089.x","venue":""}

In the presence of Mg2+, the following pattern rules: (i) uncoupler-stimulated ATP hydrolysis of Rhodospirillum rubrum chromatophores which shows an optimum concentration of the divalent cation; (ii) ATP-induced proton pumping in chromatophores; (iii) light-induced ATP synthesis in chromatophores; (iv) no or very low ATPase activity of purified F1-ATPase unmasked by diethylstilbestrol or n-octyl beta-D-glucopyranoside. In the presence of Ca2+, the following pattern occurs: (i) no stimulation of the ATP hydrolysis in chromatophores by carbonyl cyanide p-(trifluoromethoxy)phenylhydrazone; (ii) no ATP-induced proton pumping; (iii) no light-induced ATP synthesis; (iv) a high ATPase activity of the purified F1-ATPase which is inhibited by diethylstilbestrol and n-octyl beta-D-glucopyranoside. Co2+, Mn2+, and Zn2+ are members of the \"Mg2+-group\", whereas Cd2+ is suggested to fall between the two groups. Intrinsic uncoupling of the membrane-bound ATP synthase has been suggested to account for the effect caused by Ca2+ in chloroplasts [Pick, U., & Weiss, M. (1988) Eur. J. Biochem. 173, 623-628]. Such an interpretation is consistent with our results on chromatophores. The uncoupling cannot occur at the level of the membrane since neither light-induced nor Mg-ATP-induced proton pumping is affected by Ca2+. A conformational change is suggested to be the reason for this intrinsic uncoupling, and it is proposed to be controlled by the diameters of the divalent cations (Ca2+ greater than Cd2+ greater than Mn2+ greater than Co2+ greater than Zn2+ greater than Mg2+).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Division of divalent cations into two groups in relation to their effect on the coupling of the F0F1-ATPase of Rhodospirillum rubrum to the protonmotive force.","doi":"10.1021/bi00451a027","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1021/bi00451a027","venue":"Biochemistry"}

The effectiveness of each method depends on the specific project type, organizational culture and managerial skills, discussed in this paper together with the strength and limitations of various evaluation methods. To be effective, especially in complex project situations, the decision-making process often has to go beyond the application of just quantitative methods. Field research shows that incorporating both quantitative and qualitative measures into a combined rational–judgmental evaluation process often yields the most reliable predictor of future project value and success. As equally important, the process requires managerial leadership and skills in planning, organizing, and communicating. Above all, the leader of the project evaluation team must be a social architect, who can unify the multifunctional process and its people. The leader must be able to foster an environment that is professionally stimulating and conducive to risk sharing. Moreover, the evaluation process must be effectively linked to the functional support groups responsible for project implementation, and aligned with organizational strategy. Senior management has an important role in unifying the evaluation team behind the mission objectives and in facilitating the linkages to the diverse stakeholder community. \n \n \nKeywords: \n \ndecision-making; \nengineering; \njudgmental; \nproduct development; \nproject evaluation and selection; \nproject management; \nrational; \nteam leadership; \ntechnology","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Evaluating and Selecting Technology-Based Projects","doi":"10.1002/9781118436707.hmse025","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1002/9781118436707.hmse025","venue":""}

Materials and Methods: Five experimental groups were generated using two different hard relining and conventional denture base resin materials. Groups were consisted of conventional acrylic denture base resin (Acrylic resin), visible light polymerized resin (Triad), otopolymerized resin (Tokuyama), acrylic resin relined with visible light polymerized resin (Triad Reline), and acrylic resin relined with otopolymerized resin (Tokuyama Reline), respectively. For each experimental group, specimens with dimensions of 65×10×3 mm 3 were divided into two groups as control and thermocycling (n=10). Thermocycling was performed for 5000 times in baths held 5 0 C-55 0 C water. Then, transverse strength of the specimens were measured. Transverse strength data of the specimens were analyzed using two-way analysis of variance and pairwise comparisons among the groups were evaluated with Tukey’s HSD test (α=0.05). Results: Thermocycling decreased the transvers strength values of the materials in all groups. The transvers strength values were higher in non relined acrylic resin group, and lower in relined groups. Otopolymerized hard relining material (Tokuyama Reline) had higher transvers strength values than visible light polimerized resin (Triad Reline). Conclusion: Denture base and reline resins were affected by thermal differences. Acrylic resins relined with otopolymerized relining material showed higher strength than acrylic resin relined with visible light polimerized resin.

In order to improve its synthesis, NBG, was prepared by three different methods. Ten samples of PNBG, ranging in Mw from 10,000 to 50,000, were examined viscometrically in DMF and dichloroacetic acid (DCA) and by ultracentrifugation in DMF.

Unfortunately, up to twothirds of patients are ineligible to receive cisplatin-based chemotherapy because of impaired renal function, poor performance status, hearing loss, neuropathy, or heart failure. Although intravesical immunotherapy with Bacille Calmette Guerin (BCG) has been a mainstay in the treatment of non-muscle-invasive urothelial carcinoma of the bladder, only in the past year has systemic immunotherapy shown effi cacy and safety for patients with advanced urothelial carcinoma, leading to the US Food and Drug Administration’s approval of atezolizumab for patients with chemotherapy-refractory disease. In The Lancet, Arjun Balar and colleagues report the results of a multicentre, single-arm, phase 2 study of the anti-PDL-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor atezolizumab in a cisplatin-ineligible cohort of patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma. The results of this study are promising; among 119 patients who received one or more doses of atezolizumaban, the overall response rate was 23% (95% CI 16 to 31), the complete response rate was 9% (n=11), and 19 (70%) of 27 responses were still ongoing. The median overall survival was 15·9 months (95% CI 10·4 to not estimable). Although the results show effi cacy in a subset of patients, the study was non-randomised and many (or most) of the patients might have been deemed chemotherapy eligible in other settings. The criteria used by the investigators to defi ne cisplatin ineligibility for the purposes of the trial are appropriate. However, some of these criteria (eg, grade II hearing loss) constitute relative rather than absolute contraindications to cisplatin, especially when the potential clinical benefi t outweighs the risk. It is important to remember that cisplatin-based chemotherapy leads to long-term survival in a subset of patients whether cisplatin ineligibility criteria are met or not. Unfortunately, even patients who do not meet standard cisplatin ineligibility criteria often do not receive the drug in the real world, thus foregoing this potential clinical benefi t. For patients who are truly ineligible for cisplatin, non-cisplatin-based chemotherapy has shown effi cacy in a randomised trial. A randomised head-to-head comparison testing whether checkpoint inhibitor treatment is superior to combination chemotherapy is needed. Notably, in this cisplatin-ineligible population (mostly with impaired renal function), the proportion of adverse events are not diff erent from previously reported. Reassuringly, the occurrence of nephrotoxicity, which has occasionally been reported in previous studies of immune checkpoint inhibitors across diff erent diseases and settings, does not seem to be higher in this subset of patients; this low incidence of nephrotoxicity has also been reported in another study with similar drug regimens and patient populations. The response rate in this study is similar to other studies with checkpoint inhibitors, with less than a third of patients responding. Determination of predictive biomarkers for response continues to be a high research priority. Response to checkpoint inhibitors is a complex process involving PDL-1, PD-1, CTLA4, neoantigens, cancer epigenetics, eff ector T cells, and the microbiome. The results reported by Balar and colleagues build on this nuanced understanding of host–immune system interaction. The association between high response rate and high tumour mutational burdens supports the hypothesis that somatic mutations have a role in the development of neoantigenic peptides eliciting a cytotoxic T-cell response that is unleashed by immune-checkpoint blockade. The association between the luminal The Cancer Genome Atlas cluster II and response is consistent with the results from the platinum-treated cohort from the IMvigor210 study. However, the basal 1 subtype was associated with increased response rates with the PD-1 inhibitor nivolumab. The intrinsic molecular subtypes of urothelial carcinoma probably represent a continuum and thus overlaps between diff erent clusters and response are not surprising. Additionally, subtle diff erences between the biological consequences of PD-1 versus PDL-1 blockade are not completely understood and the blockade of either might have diff erent biomarker profi les.

The NT Preschool Maths Games, a suite of play-based games underpinned by mathematical concepts, was developed to support the enactment of this curriculum. Here, we explore the impact of attending a preschool classroom in which the NT Preschool Maths Games is being implemented, on child learning outcomes in a pre–post intervention design. Children were assessed in regard to their number naming, counting, and Applied Problems skills. After the baseline assessments, the teachers in the intervention rooms were equipped with the NT Preschool Maths Games and attended a one-day workshop on how to use them. Compared with children in the delayed intervention group, children in the intervention group showed statistically greater gains in their mathematical competencies in a post intervention assessment. This suggests that the NT Preschool Maths Games may support the enhancement of child learning outcomes.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Using mathematics games in preschool settings to support the development of children’s numeracy skills","doi":"10.1080/09669760.2019.1629882","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1080/09669760.2019.1629882","venue":""}

Using planar gamma scintigraphy, we developed new methods to locate and quantify regions of high (hot) and low (cold) particle deposition in the lungs.\n\n\nMETHODS\nInitial deposition and 24 hour retention images were obtained from healthy (n=31) adult subjects and patients with mild cystic fibrosis lung disease (CF) (n=14) following inhalation of radiolabeled particles (Tc99m-sulfur colloid, 5.4 μm MMAD) under controlled breathing conditions. The initial deposition image of the right lung was normalized to (i.e., same median pixel value), and then divided by, a transmission (Tc99m) image in the same individual to obtain a pixel-by-pixel ratio image. Hot spots were defined where pixel values in the deposition image were greater than 2X those of the transmission, and cold spots as pixels where the deposition image was less than 0.5X of the transmission. The number ratio (NR) of the hot and cold pixels to total lung pixels, and the sum ratio (SR) of total counts in hot pixels to total lung counts were compared between healthy and CF subjects. Other traditional measures of regional particle deposition, nC/P and skew of the pixel count histogram distribution, were also compared.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe NR of cold spots was greater in mild CF, 0.221±0.047(CF) vs. 0.186±0.038 (healthy) (p<0.005) and was significantly correlated with FEV1 %pred in the patients (R=-0.70). nC/P (central to peripheral count ratio), skew of the count histogram, and hot NR or SR were not different between the healthy and mild CF patients.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThese methods may provide more sensitive measures of airway function and localization of deposition that might be useful for assessing treatment efficacy in these patients.","inCitations":["2b0508c09bc999a344f2b624f81f9c6fe7450fe1","aefd0fa9cda62c5aa666a78474c13a80246c176e","bfbac88c6911d8d9390edc4fb7707ce5cb9dbbe1"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Heterogeneity of Particle Deposition by Pixel Analysis of 2D Gamma Scintigraphy Images.","doi":"10.1089/jamp.2013.1095","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1089/jamp.2013.1095","venue":"Journal of aerosol medicine and pulmonary drug delivery"}

As a consequence, there remains an interest in immunomodulatory therapies that may enhance immune reconstitution. One such approach that has been under investigation for 11 decade is the adjunctive use of recombinant human IL-2, a cytokine that plays a central role in the cellular immune response. HIV-infected adults with CD4 cell counts of 50–350 cells/mL who had not previously received a protease inhibitor were treated with indinavir plus 2 nucleoside analogue reverse-transcriptase inhibitors, at least one of which had to be novel to the patient. After 12 weeks of antiretroviral therapy, patients with a plasma HIV RNA concentration 5000 copies/mL were randomized to continue to receive antiretroviral therapy (ART) alone (the ART group), to continue to receive ART with a continuous infusion of IL-2 at a dosage of 9 million IU daily for 5 days every 8 weeks (the ART + IV IL-2 group), or to continue to receive ART with IL-2 at a dosage of 7.5 million IU subcutaneously twice daily for 5 days every 8 weeks (the ART + SC IL-2 group). A total of 159 patients were available for analysis. Forty and 51 patients discontinued therapy before weeks 60 and 84, respectively. Grade 3 and 4 adverse events were more common in the groups receiving IL2; adverse events included fatigue, fever, chills and sweats, mucocutaneous events, and (especially in the ART + IV IL-2 group) nausea and vomiting. The primary end point of the study (a 150% increase in the CD4 cell count at week 60) was achieved by 29%, 81%, and 67% of patients assigned to the ART, ART + IV IL-2, and ART + SC IL-2 groups, respectively. The response in each of the IL-2 arms was superior to that in the ART arm ( for each comparison). PaP ! .001 tients assigned to the IL-2 arms also had significantly fewer AIDS-defining events, with 1 event (Kaposi sarcoma) occurring in the ART + SC IL-2 arm and none occurring in the ART + IV IL-2 arm. Seven events occurred among patients assigned to receive ART alone (Kaposi sarcoma, 2 events; Burkitt lymphoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, Castleman disease, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia, and esophageal candidiasis, 1 event each). There were no significant differences between treatment groups with regard to plasma HIV RNA level at week 84. IL-2 therapy was associated with a general peripheral expansion of CD4 T cell populations, including both naive and memory/effector cells and populations bearing CD28 (coreceptor for T cell activation), CD25 (a chain of the IL-2 receptor), and CD95 (the Fas receptor that mediates apoptotic signaling by Fas ligand). There were no significant differences between treatment arms with regard to changes in skin test reactivity or in vitro lymphocyte proliferation. Previous studies found that CD4 T cell responses to IL-2 therapy were confined to individuals with baseline CD4 T cell counts of 1200 cells/mL. In the study by Mitsuyasu and colleagues, although patients with CD4 cell counts as low as 50 cells/mL were eligible for enrollment, IL-2 therapy was not initiated until patients had received 12 weeks of HAART, at which time the median CD4 cell counts ranged from 239 to 305 cells/mL. Despite the success in expanding peripheral CD4 cell populations, IL-2 therapy was not associated with in vitro evidence of enhanced T cell function. Of more importance, however, was the occurrence of fewer AIDS-related serious clinical events among IL-2 recipients. A meta-analysis of previous IL-2 trials also suggested an associated clinical benefit [1]. A definitive answer regarding the potential for prevention of opportunistic infections and malignancies, however, awaits the outcomes of 2 large clinical trials that are currently in progress.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://oup.silverchair-cdn.com/oup/backfile/Content_public/Journal/cid/45/1/10.1086/518969/2/45-1-v.pdf?Expires=1492663659&Key-Pair-Id=APKAIUCZBIA4LVPAVW3Q&Signature=LHIqjA0BuEAVqoPsu87Zje3t6JJEusUnwBXAp09UD8X4wpKoJ-S7o8zDr9ppiXkXNK4DA6n7lRwABvHCRgrN7Vxs1kLfZkJXxm8qR4W5OQY6YfeYrXPUGSZRGdY-SGNwRCynW2oeFvg43hFdkMDjqu2L6R9Vldqsjgj1acLwRUgKHJDGQH1gWcGm0XZOWyQvrZqs5TpxZ19le1-9QGc1KNXZrPSH0jc-6Q3vpKXVt7ZpKo44d76NW~7mmXdb0mBT~DWEqjm6E-LmiCIRKEUScJc5f60IigTJ08BwgjxN2EARPiy4g5JIzUBGURJcZytOouKHE6Dobe816EFXjsVJQg__","http://www.commonwealthfund.org/~/media/files/publications/in-the-literature/2008/nov/cost-effectiveness-of-automated-telephone-self-management-support-with-nurse-care-management-among-p/handley_cost-effectivenessatsm_1192_itl-pdf.pdf"],"title":"In the Literature.","doi":"10.1093/cid/ciy628","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1093/cid%2Fciy628","venue":"Clinical infectious diseases : an official publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America"}

Services are self-describing, open components intended to support composition of distributed applications. Currently, Web services provide a standard-based realization of SOC due to: (1) the machine-readable format (XML) of their functional and nonfunctional specifications, and (2) their messaging protocols built on top of the Internet. However, how to methodologically identify, specify, design, deploy and manage a sound and complete set of Web services to move to a service-oriented architecture (SOA) is still an issue. This paper describes a process for reverse engineering relational database applications architecture into SOA architecture, where SQL statements are insulated from the applications, factored, implemented, and registered as Web services to be discovered, selected, and reused in composing e-business solutions. The process is based on two types of design patterns: schema transformation pattern and CRUD operations pattern. First, the schema transformation pattern allows an identification of the services. Then the CRUD operations pattern allows a specification of the abstract part of the identified services, namely their port types. This process is implemented as a CASE tool, which assists analysts specifying services that implement common, reusable, basic business logic and data manipulation.","inCitations":["1f6bd97003e97f568b17b5fcdb21781fe155817a","7cde0cc865570ff4c934f391d4057f46413c86e6","a1e6b2a71864834e4920e087a795af61a4c86867","e6c91593456af12fb59ff68587fd58247fceb3d7","3f00b77d4157f3871a631a4b31ad5db7fe07aa16","1fe5b450e6b6657dab8e075ddfc33eba4bda18b9","f64a8cddc262712a741acf99cd6fe5c95434e598","e239de98b861b448aa5073e2f176e34496298084","c2156f623552350d30c16c7558d093cfc60d577b","3599ae88badce44627965a04d878d1dfd895569a","24f8bc032a908af4ee6624a336f5301c415102bf","19c9ed5e3fbd7b1672e7d883ad2b9bb1bdfc84d9","0fd593abba2578867a94d8913a57806023b64743","2f430eaa9122054bfaa4b1f0dcf286d96116febc","d16502f24b11435c92f214f44d30392e76caa6d0","1dc40b5cbaea47b307655f2e9c2c07fce8ae2dc2","8d479e8ba47b5347711fc99c11f235150d76ac0c","6a65694b1f0f71b4fe2915c934fdfeb9a4186ae5","c07e74fa6904fcfe8d7daf039b0ef8a18ea960c1"],"pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1007/s10796-006-9007-2"],"title":"Reverse engineering relational databases to identify and specify basic Web services with respect to service oriented computing","doi":"10.1007/s10796-006-9007-2","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10796-006-9007-2","venue":"Inf.

The achievable performance is greatly degraded, however, when non-repeating, stochastic disturbances are present. This paper aims to compare a number of different ILC algorithms, proposed to be more robust to the presence of these disturbances, first by a statistical analysis and then by simulation results and their application to a linear motor. New expressions for the expected value and variance of the controlled error are developed for each algorithm. The different algorithms are then tested in simulation and finally applied to the linear motor system to test their performance in practice. A filtered ILC algorithm is proposed when the noise and desired output spectra are separated. Otherwise an algorithm with a decreasing gain gives good robustness to noise and achievable precision but at a slower convergence rate.","inCitations":["7be7b14598ba6da2185385c53f225bb5c9cfeca3","2eddd4e8aab961e035ed80e37d8878608c7e56ac","48834c3f909d2279001f74575c54186ea0eddd11","9eedfbe15b39893dc713f6847b5608cb7627f526","2e6022a8880cc6399ac6b4a16982dd076388859c","531df8831031434b5e88dc62b93a1533fc499d86","afae8725b203de9fdaaf7c3ad1f6825d1d3d6640","39d7ef5745abdfa8a2cfab118206e106575dd259","0bbee261594c22a62ad540f5ab59be6ff8130a8c","8d5ae19491a8f79231b36fd0b6267b02b436693a","126bafa08966161d95732f9ef243b78dce495d21","a0e426a0375b8f711ec542bf367505b0c8d19b1d","64df92c51e5c5ecf723b6d1cc7fac7241ecc09a5","7a778c3c90448ef32241a4dbabd80e8b2fb4b873","9145ea990664a14ae2d0426da0d9c4b4934bb564","27a06920233e44e9a19237d8302c4e9e61a9758d","a6c8ea9d730c6679cad6caa403a23e270bdfca30","517abc529780386b7f28fb2150be57bb7c7beef7","915fc808205ad1ca28f9103b387808fb248fee4a","5ae871ef1c094fa736d2795d9c7cef4e7b9b334f","13e5d1f805ed69fdb9722abfc8677893dfe1d1c0","f131e2b774b47346ea2eb0b0239855c1d7b40988","135108474741b28dbd7626161395de2093327222","e79f0907b7c3b445fcb728eaba3158e915dddb64","4ae6509a5f8c8eca1e52ec57bfaca257c6ce2f4d"],"pdfUrls":["https://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/89645/files/IJC_2006_butcher.pdf","http://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/89645/files/IJC_2006_butcher.pdf","https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q58220230"],"title":"A statistical analysis of certain iterative learning control algorithms","doi":"10.1080/00207170701484851","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1080/00207170701484851","venue":"Int.

Nous craignons que cette tendance ne traduise une inflexion de la classique relation medicale de disparite dans le sens de la parite. Or nous soutenons que cette disparite est une position therapeutique pour le psychotique, l'evolution vers une parite creant le risque d'un rabattement de la triade psychiatre—savoir—patient en dyade, espace de l'identique, du Meme, registre de l'alienation. Le savoir psychiatrique objectif prend alors dans ce mouvement rang de Verite absolue, au detriment de son essentiel lien a la subjectivite. Nous illustrons notre propos a l'aide d'une vignette clinique qui presente un fragment de dialogue avec un patient, posant le probleme de la reponse a apporter a l'interrogation qui l'anime quant a son activite hallucinatoire. Nous discutons deux types de reponses differentes, moins d'ailleurs pour leur contenus que pour expliciter les positions qui les sous-tendent.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Répondre au patient psychotique: éloge de la disparité","doi":"10.1016/S0014-3855(01)80042-6","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/S0014-3855%2801%2980042-6","venue":""}

capacity in overweight individuals. METHODS: In a randomized crossover design, 19 subjects consumed 300 mL of wine (WG) or grape juice (JG) for two weeks and acutely upon returning to the lab. Blood was drawn at baseline, post two weeks, and acutely. The statistical design was a 2 (treatments) x 3 (times) repeated measures ANOVA. RESULTS: Overall weight gain occurred in both groups with treatment effect (P=0.044) and time effect (P=0.018). Significant weight gain was found in WG (P=0.027). Total fat mass percentage, C-reactive protein and lipids were not affected by red wine or grape juice consumption. Ferric reducing ability of plasma significantly increased after acute, but not chronic, consumption of red wine (P<0.001). Oxygen radical absorptive capacity of plasma did not change significantly for either treatment. CONCLUSION: Adding wine or grape juice to the diets of overweight sedentary individuals, with no other dietary alterations, resulted in significant weight gain. Acute consumption of red wine resulted in significant changes in antioxidant capacity which may confer potential benefits on health variables other than ones examined in the present study.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://libres.uncg.edu/ir/asu/f/Ho,%20Weng%20On_2010_Thesis.pdf"],"title":"The Effects of Red Wine and Grape Juice Consumption in Overweight Individuals on Multiple Health Parameters","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}
