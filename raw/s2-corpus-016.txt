The shunt-current-eliminated diode current could be obtained from the current–voltage characteristics by subtracting the parasitic shunt leakage current from the total current. The temperature dependence of the open-circuit voltage, extracted from the shunt-eliminated (total) current, suggested that the recombination activation energy is comparable to (much less than) the CIGS bandgap. The low-temperature characteristics of the diode ideality factor supported bulk-dominated recombination in the same cell. This suggests that shunt-current subtraction can provide the proper diode parameters of CIGS solar cells.","inCitations":["9d4fe10ed747093f17c0ca670b1d264dacef8fa0"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Influence of shunt conduction on determining the dominant recombination processes in CIGS thin-film solar cells","doi":"10.1016/j.cap.2012.06.006","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cap.2012.06.006","venue":""}

The classification tree of products is used to find the users with similar shopping intention. The sparsity of user ratings, major problem for collaborative filtering, is overcome. A two-granularity user profile is built to reflect the customer's shopping interests. User profile is firstly described as a set of leaf nodes of the classification tree. Then, each category of the user profile is refined by the theory of fuzzy set. Fuzzy sets make user profile and item representation more accurate. At the same time, tags instead of key words extracted from item content, are used for the building of user profiles and representation of items.

The research was conducted in nagari around the Maninjau lake area during 2016-2017. Data wer collected through semi-structured interviews and focus group discussions. The results indicate that karamba has the potential to be developed as a tourism activity through the participation of karamba practitioners as tourism operators. However, the type of participation cannot be entirely spontaneous type, but induced participation type is also needed to develop the karamba tourism.

It is possible that these differences may, at least in part, be related both to phylogeny and the pattern of digestive physiology. 10 −2 M sodium taurocholate and 10 −3 M lead nitrate possess mainly inhibitory effects, whereas 10 −3 M cysteine hydrochloride functions predominantly as an activator. The precise effect in each case depends both upon the species and the pH of incubation.

Here we show that this level of coherence is sufficient to perform an analog of the well known in quantum optics ``laser'' cooling of a nanomechanical resonator capacitively coupled to the qubit. By applying an ac driving to the qubit or the resonator, resonators with frequency of order 100 MHz and quality factors higher than ${10}^{3}$ can be efficiently cooled down to their ground state, while lower-frequency resonators can be cooled down to micro-Kelvin temperatures.

A recombinant plasmid (pcDNA3.1-RKIP) or RKIP-targeting small interfering RNA (siRNA) vector (siRNA-RKIP) was transfected into LX-2 cells to interfere with the RKIP expression. The results demonstrated that increased RKIP expression significantly reduced cell viability, clonogenic growth, and invasion. Further, it promoted cell apoptosis and induced cell cycle arrest in the G1 phase. Overexpression of RKIP led to inactivation of LX-2 cells, as evidenced by the decrease in the expression levels of collagen I and α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA). In addition, increased RKIP expression significantly reduced the phosphorylation of Raf/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), the transcriptional activity of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), and the levels of matrix metalloproteinases-1 and -2. In conclusion, these findings clearly demonstrate that RKIP inhibits LX-2 cell growth, metastasis, and activation, primarily by downregulating the ERK/MAPK and NF-κB signaling pathways.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Role of RKIP in human hepatic stellate cell proliferation, invasion, and metastasis.","doi":"10.1002/jcb.27904","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1002/jcb.27904","venue":"Journal of cellular biochemistry"}

In our previous work we showed how a single agent's survival can benefit from autobiographic memory. In the current work we extend this work by introducing a multi-agent context. Also, we investigate autobiographic agents which are able to share episodic memories (sequences of perceptions and actions) in the form of 'communications' with others in order to find necessary resources for 'surviving' in an environment. This Artificial Life perspective allows assessment of the potential benefits of such communications in a multi-agent context. A virtual experimental-based approach deals with different conditions on agent communications. Extending our previous work, we introduce an improved control architectures design for autobiographic agents that allows them to communicate episodic memories. Using detailed measurements of the agents' lifespan, this is compared both with groups of purely reactive agents and non-communicative autobiographic agents. Results confirm our previous research hypothesis that autobiographic memory can prove beneficial, indicating increases in the lifespan of an autonomous, autobiographic, minimal agent. The paper presents results from simulation runs varying the following parameters: a) with/without communications of episodic memories, b) varying the number of agents in the environment from one to five, and c) communications under different types of conditions, including presence/absence of costs and motivations. Results show that in experiments with certain numbers of agents, communicating memories with others can compensate for the negative effect of generally decreasing lifespan due to multiple agent interference. Experiments on specific combinations of motivation and cost conditions also show that, when cost is incurred for communication, agents perform better if they communicate memories only when they are in need of a resource.","inCitations":["7ea6d4514fc74db68d9c9c93aa30061a5dd57bd3","5eef6714808e6fe0a9782e3a595149d58f8b9d94","6546c8e0e4ebd73ffe964d919d4328851fb95c73","473860776b47ff885b3c90fb8bbcc511b2c74e6a","b6b916237a21100065e8292899d9fa62cb16f390","d59cc61f692c9977146f3f3ddb657ad06c1aadac","e94c2fad4030870771a382e21a553bd2ca0baed9","dd41f4bcfe6c37140deb8f56c27fd8daa647614e"],"pdfUrls":["http://uhra.herts.ac.uk/bitstream/handle/2299/6959/900831.pdf?sequence=1","http://homepages.feis.herts.ac.uk/~comqkd/IAS8.pdf","https://uhra.herts.ac.uk/bitstream/handle/2299/6959/900831.pdf;sequence=1"],"title":"Sharing memories: an experimental investigation with multiple autonomous autobiographic agents","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Recently, the expression of the androgen receptor (AR) has been shown to be decreased in diabetic patients. Furthermore, diabetes has been shown to induce global methylation. In this study, we used an animal model to investigate whether diabetes results in increased methylation of the AR promoter and whether these changes are associated with the decreased expression of AR in penile cavernosal smooth muscle tissue. Twenty C57BL/6J mice were divided into two groups, receiving either high- (mature diabetic) or low- (mature control) caloric meals for 14 weeks. Another 10 mice were killed at 1 week (young control). Animals in the mature diabetic group showed decreased testosterone levels, although this was not statistically significant. In both control groups, no significant methylation was observed in the AR promoter region CpG island (-85 to +339). In the mature diabetic group, significant methylation was observed at +185 and +200 of the AR promoter. These changes were associated with increased homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and decreased corpus cavernosal tissue mass and expression of AR mRNA and protein. We conclude that in these animals, insulin resistance increased the methylation of the GC-rich regions of the AR promoter, leading to decreased AR expression.","inCitations":["2926c43ffe175ebc5c62929ed224138709980df1","6602c950f0ec79fdfac9704ada291bbc454a2f52","1f86af8ab5d3174d5175075a695dbd629f98fe88","9f093c400d94e61ab1e75cddb8a18ed049dbb0b9","16ae0c3c05f834692d9a7c4d5799a1208bbff102","aed1bb6b3ee160922b8338feca4e0dc5287093fb","9b895aa8de9ab1ee153773ccdf41289348126a93","1abf8aa05be60af9d40354b0e75d06d9b1ba649c"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.asiaandro.com/news/upload/20130913-aja201326a.pdf"],"title":"The effect of diet-induced insulin resistance on DNA methylation of the androgen receptor promoter in the penile cavernosal smooth muscle of mice.","doi":"10.1038/aja.2013.26","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1038/aja.2013.26","venue":"Asian journal of andrology"}

A large part of research results is published in scientific literature, and since there are many forms of it, the question arises which form is the most visible and attractive to the world scientific community. The International Consortium on Landslides (ICL), based in Kyoto, Japan, is one of the leading institutions in the field of landslide research and landslide risk reduction. On behalf of ICL, Springer Nature has published the journal Landslides: Journal of the International Consortium on Landslides since 2004. It is a very successful scientific journal with regard to its scientometric parameters. Since January 2018, it has been a monthly journal published in full color in electronic as well as printed form. Another form of dissemination of the ICL scientific and professional activities are published books in the form of monographs and proceedings from triennial World Landslide Forums. This paper discusses the impact of 52 books with 3426 chapters taken from the field of landslide science and published by Springer Nature from 2005 to 2018 in the earth sciences category, using different scientometric parameters, such as Bookmetrix downloads and citations, Scopus citations, Scopus h-index, Google citations, and Google h-index. The analysis was performed on the book chapter level (using mainly citations as the main scientometric parameter) as well as on the book level (using book h-index and percentage of cited chapters). Out of the selected 52 titles, 22 were published on behalf of the ICL, with 1419 chapters. The differences among landslide-related books can be quite large; only a few chapters from analyzed book titles were found to be cited frequently compared to highly cited scientific journal articles. On average, the analyzed 3426 book chapters from 52 landslide-related books have been downloaded since publication over 53,000 times each; 1092 chapters (32%) received 2932 citations (2.68 citations per cited chapter and 0.86 citations per published chapter). The analysis shows that the books published on behalf of the ICL are, together with other landslide-related book titles, on the forefront in the Springer eBook collection Earth and Environmental Science (EES). The selected 52 landslide-related book titles are above the average metrics for the whole EES with regard to the total number of downloads per book, the total number of citations per book, and the total number of readers per book. The ICL-related books are getting more downloads but less readers and citations (so far) as the selected non-ICL-related books. A way in raising the visibility and impact of the ICL books on landslide research community would be to support their open access publication in the form of e-Books as much as possible, and inclusion of ICL books into Web of Science.","inCitations":["e1bd720a68b8349a6f21defece76b0b8bda0b6b1"],"pdfUrls":["https://repozitorij.uni-lj.si/Dokument.php?id=115747&lang=slv"],"title":"The bibliometric impact of books published by the International Consortium on Landslides","doi":"10.1007/s10346-018-1019-8","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10346-018-1019-8","venue":"Landslides"}

The first project is a commercial facility that will be one of the largest data center of Turkey and intended to have Tier III rating. During the design of this project, it is observed that tier requirements for structural and seismic design of data centers are not given in detail in the related IT standards. A detailed design basis, which is presented in the first paper of this study, is developed by authors to facilitate the design after a thorough multidisciplinary design process. As the key objectives, operational level performance is set for the structural and nonstructural components for the design basis and maximum considered earthquake levels. Acceleration limits are set for sensitive computer equipment based on the feedback from IT professionals. Seismic base isolation of the complete building with high-performance friction pendulum isolators is utilized to achieve stringent design objectives. Superstructure is comprised of a steel structure with large spans resting on a thick reinforced concrete isolation slab, which allows large white spaces and future modifications. Substructure is comprised of short columns and mat foundation that provides ample maintenance space. Fundamental results of the design including the structural member sizes, isolator parameters, isolation displacements, isolation and first floor shears, floor accelerations are presented. Design of nonstructural components, anchorages and other components are reviewed and representative details are provided. The second data center is a confidential project with Tier IV class resilience, and a similar design basis is utilized. Structural and base isolation systems of the second project are similar to the first project, and basic results for this project are presented. It is shown that the seismic design of the data centers satisfy the requirements of the design basis and provide a seismic safety suitable for Tier III and Tier IV operational resilience. 1Assist.

A test developed by Conrad and Unger is applied to determine whether the agricultural supply and marketing cooperatives are at a long-run equilibrium capacity. It is found that most of the cooperatives were overinvested in capacity. However,dept does not explain this overinvestment. Finally,the effect of dept on total productivity over the study period is examined. It is found that dept has had a small positive impact on total factor productivity growth.

Goldberg, and Pete Hand, all of the Aperio Group, present six quantitative environmental (E), social (S), and governance (G) strategies for building or restructuring portfolios to align with investors’ ethical considerations and financial goals. Customizing an ESG portfolio requires trade-offs between investment risk and an investor’s values, whether that means tilting the portfolio toward stocks or sectors that the investor likes, or avoiding ones that it dislikes. In exploring these strategies, the authors propose certain practices and analyze options for ESG portfolio construction that balance risk and the ESG preferences of investors. Acknowledging the challenges faced by investors who want to “do well by doing good,” the authors stress the need for investors to clearly understand their goals and constraints, as well as the complexities intrinsic to trade-offs between risk control and exposure to unwanted securities. The quantitative methods outlined by the authors can lower tracking error but may also increase exposure to unwanted stocks or sectors. To mitigate against such exposure, the authors recommend that investors tap the expanding set of high-quality ESG-scored company data during portfolio construction.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Practical Applications of A Guide to ESG Portfolio Construction","doi":"10.3905/pa.7.3.352","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.3905/pa.7.3.352","venue":""}

This approach has also been used to treat depression, chronic illness, and anxiety disorders. EFT appears to translate well across culture and class, focusing on universal key emotions and attachment needs. From the EFT perspective, adult love is a hardwired, adaptive attachment response. The therapist's in-session focus is on the processing of emotions and key interactional patterns as they occur in the present, because emotional experiences are the primary instruments of change in this approach. The therapist is a relationship consultant who offers a safe platform whereby each partner can distill, expand, and transform experience and find new ways to connect with the other. The case presented here illustrates the three stages of EFT: de-escalation, restructuring interactions, and consolidation.","inCitations":["8bf6a0e5b03c697e9b1479b65108b04a5876b9b8","d0846282f471f5519073fe58282bff7fa7cf66a3","93b5663b385497aaac16d766abb5255451d02eb4","9f085268920ff4b27f1cdaa01150f16cb9eebaf0","cb1ffe25da3ade4a3aded37736eca9bd0c186838","eac6d3e7b2a356c77e5eae30786543b1e6d1418f","baf2dd9dabbac8b7c52888c2f173e4387b08bf9d","d5b29e60c306358ac9085d9e124d358548840bc6","61092eb8b6f31dbea3fa55e4bd37e86f430af665","08f30bc3eacbf40181fce810cb3fe1cd2624c66f","44e2f5c793307ab2c372eb927c1d0fb30e4b76a0","8be668b39d6eb8ff8e03bd1a55c5a7dff94e6f7f","82da5f7d4e74a3e1c2813a3021b4a048d0257b78","cde0c3d0bf4d4cfc8b0f18a632373c8ea761cc38","38d037ebd8462c379a238c435cd74324bec71380","9a7220d05e5dccb382ec733f214e85d50ec87153","eb345960727721d351b3a8c28dad438b3e89f2bb","167d0c7342e2de0a6a4d3c9d23a41c1817802c6e","7d81ae385a028dd7251904f1b451683b8d8aefac","fe38441f91d14ad4006944f25845011bb6a75e08","3d47b5635fbb178d3a2985cb5fe9a077b763bebc","7d7cf811784a8e298e5216f6baec56b67db08dd4","79a1af12e077627db044fee31c54c07f9a7365b5","6629594f1cd31e66a055242d7a3a2c1bb74517db","868d787fc933fc67c28801eac1d8caf9b8769634","deb486acd9284bdd80780d1a884a91f77060a02f","2ce90e94160eb2bd8aa7c1a9ac9373cc93fd5f08","0208f0c52dd40dce8fe5d7fa5ed857013ff7d9af","bbd321035ca9ccbab3ae46a75d464d01f591f489","b178676c6594ba966dc5f74f360fbb2d8d47bb5d","25ab491f38849d3e932a762ca88c3b76e7ae0d68","f1058eb80b883b28bb6d0ee3f83842e604f8b7f1","ac0473f6a7858903a42c7223949caf16006305b4"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.evolutionofpsychotherapy.com/download/handouts/Sue-Johnson-Path-to-a-Secure-Bond-Greenman.pdf","https://relationshipinstitute.com.au/uploads/resources/2006p_The_Path_to_a_Secure_Bond.pdf"],"title":"The path to a secure bond: emotionally focused couple therapy.","doi":"10.1002/jclp.20251","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1002/jclp.20251","venue":"Journal of clinical psychology"}

Also different measurement devices for the ultrasound pressure have been suggested. Most common are small detectors based on materials, which exhibit a strong piezoelectric effect and can be immersed safely in water (i.e. polymers such as PVDF). In analytical reconstruction formulas, they are considered point detectors. Other experimental setups have been realized with line and area detectors, which collect averaged pressure (see [9] for a survey). Here, we consider the problem of photoacoustic sectional imaging. Opposed to standard photoacoustic imaging, where the detectors record sets of two-dimensional projection images from which the three-dimensional imaging data can be reconstructed, single slice imaging reconstructs a set of two-dimensional slices, each by a single scan procedure. The advantages of the latter approach are a considerable increase in measurement speed and the possibility to do selective plane imaging. In general, this can only be obtained by the cost of decreased out-of-plane resolution. The difference in this model to previously studied models is that the wave propagation is considered fully three-dimensional, the initialization and measurements are fully two-dimensional due to the selective plane illumination and detection. Therefore, such setups require novel reconstruction formulas, which have been explained in this talk. After the introduction of the universal back-projection algorithm introduced in [11] this goal seems superfluous. However, it has been shown recently by Natterer [6] that universal back-projection is only exact for special sampling geometries. Here, for sliced imaging and certain sampling setups, we can indeed find mathematically exact universal reconstruction algorithms for arbitrary strictly convex sampling domains Ω. We model the sectional photoacoustic imaging by assuming that the initial pressure distribution f : R → R is perfectly focused in the illumination plane {x ∈ R | x3 = 0}:","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://www.csc.univie.ac.at/paper/ElbKirSchSchu12.pdf"],"title":"Photoacoustic and Coupled Physics Imaging","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Group 1 received bilateral SBL-3 IOLs and Group 2 received bilateral Lentis Mplus LS-312 MF30 IOLs, with the near segments placed inferonasally in each group. Group 3 received a Lentis Mplus LS-312 MF20 IOL in the dominant eye with the near segment positioned superotemporal and a Lenstec SBL-3 IOL positioned inferonasally in the fellow eye. Binocular uncorrected (UDVA) and corrected distance visual acuities, binocular uncorrected near (UNVA) and intermediate (UIVA) visual acuities, binocular distance-corrected near and intermediate visual acuities, and quality of vision were evaluated over 3 months postoperatively.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe study enrolled 180 patients (360 eyes). There was no significant difference between the groups in binocular UDVA, UIVA, and UNVA; however, there was a significant difference between the groups in quality of vision (P ≤ .001). Group 3 had significantly better overall quality of vision.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nWhen implanting rotationally asymmetric multifocal IOLs, a combination of superotemporal placement of the near segment (+2.00 diopter [D] addition [add]) in the dominant eye with inferonasal placement of the near segment (+3.00 D add) in the fellow eye yielded consistent, high overall quality of vision and uncorrected visual acuity.\n\n\nFINANCIAL DISCLOSURE\nNone of the authors has a financial or proprietary interest in any material or method mentioned.","inCitations":["d49d211a16e8b807c7b3e56e34160b3b766ef6c5","4747eecfe664a648160076e4c076e4b2e5fd695f"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Comparison of the visual performance and quality of vision with combined symmetrical inferonasal near addition versus inferonasal and superotemporal placement of rotationally asymmetric refractive multifocal intraocular lenses.","doi":"10.1016/j.jcrs.2016.10.016","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcrs.2016.10.016","venue":"Journal of cataract and refractive surgery"}

Metabolic systems that are sensitive to salt, as well as those governing osmolyte synthesis and ion transport, offer routes by which genetic engineering can be used to improve the tolerance of various organisms to salt.","inCitations":["ba4b2502507cc270ab1d94bcfa8d790888627fbb","deb5c67b835b07575074fba3a62a787859aa39ed","22fafee90bc06f7db8bc4e265b6a625a442a228f","df625c93a657c3f3bf95f3e8fa650d96d9a5d3e0","3fd91b3bf2ad426ca53b7e40606078bc8ea03712","fe050dfb39cc4a56b281ac59b651ffe1be071ac3","971360c87b88329d94688d026c3668d8fd2db245","1f7c293a74f42cce475cbac5b6919459aedc46a8","19630daf972e066064b7a1885163c1f824652772","c0962cf281d7b30c6c7db395072f622398df01f7","ddf4b612624661af44e2dcf906c39a828c8dcd5e","262f03180ddb4b6bc45a4334a77a58de711e35a1","e96edc1d387d1fbc627408962a46497c91e9f095","b02593aa08eb5637e7d808a178c8247745d9afb4","f2939d02018499a1e86d7a06755a19654fbb2d82","7f40c1f5c5fc57106cab25a07ce12d98b8cae20e","7d32e3cb0dbcf2ea9e82747629d6ed929fcb94f3","20a5a06b24588b14603cab454403c0c12f0e1418","1280fd1961713ebf7f73affdaa833d8de484452e","05bdb1c96b36ac16d41365781245c4bc517d5875","a70e51249ec3835467d4a4962401995424a567e1","3eca117e38b8116caf2d917267aa2d2f5f35869f","a85a4083ab58a2ea9237770156a3cd5bc08502bb","cb6546d814e2733f653e467e5a4547c4d8d9c9d9","50f9844b190ee50c7f7a22a7caa9f99754d0236b","94b9d4a8928d49ad06c30ab5989ad5ef8051f0e4","bac48d7b55e6be94539988bf223b4df978d6c3a9","885bef9e16dad2fef8a57c604e8d4e82cc379954","d6acd1fee8d9c96753c1c36d11daaf645924fc54","729aa6df0d2d1d45bf9fae06a02b8b054fa30079","186ceb3b3dcee6709d9d6ba35f087fe6dd4c682b","e96082e84a96cced87ad900a2f0ecdbc6a8dfdc6","e096b4cfde31a0bf4d9176d1ab816dfa8272a487","0e2c36038ee1e8d157ff4f4987564ba7063c08e1","8e30aefb822c9391e4ff54d92fc698f4a65f2643","e287ff558d79c9bbc134361b7c5029f411040f61","fce475988b8b0625082ca49225c780ef7cd7f369","21f6177400e669d6698a750cd6e3beef943a2f51","1c54ba6087411e03c5c62fa0a18f90c3a4729ad4","25374ea263a451fdc0bb7699dbe1eed14bc04d26","26bd156e9c0d4b47eb755634d676e8e1638a498c","5c480a17753fec24e904951b82c4918f9a1e431f","1716af815c840ae4a02ae4da053196ba28b2670a","aa0bf7c3008d0f71d00ac667c8296fec1083f619","68b9cf0ad7ebdd06bcfddf47d860e43d5131deaa","674d8d04f434bf566ac007af2f8b790d63b2471c","668676d61b425076d8229b223f4bce2b661b6468","9f341d18b8a23e40eb01dc23ec1b297ff35358b2","69f6a9878d8eb1c0d5434b0dee953b111c4aae01","809fbf4639e5bab6cc8b8cf4642037732e9019f4","fd12cebe286dc29c3a11987520f1a7f5cbc12350","24d0fceba479dd2adf8cc970b1c45253f94777d6","9f65658bf5d8612409f3deb9cb31c1419196cbed","9a234f236a94ad5c035deba5bbb2a8e1ab91948d","ffb1651bf7957410d891989790682ca2549ea686","d7d57524ebd4b25f8f6d0ca5fa9f12b6ce36ef9e","912601f28d7f86a7fa3ee4227bc224b89f2ff71f","e2377e5602816dc91daf5700985b8a1098bd7da1","0899b84f3c02008e2d23d475f57db76060bfaeee","6df19214b57faf4612191a3e875f689160a9fb7a","59e82bea1a8c5b58cd7521e22c7d91b4fc5ada78","366490a1db10b694cceccc58034949c97ec0624a","08a4a1f6ec90c87cb2a315eb18a46d6f476ce911","0552de7ff21d8173e334453d55109b16cf5f901f","1ab14e2b14bb4b5d032acf557b60738973e3dadb","79c73326b7ebf21c8d70b2457726766fc93ae2a8","59689dbf054194773e98a1d227557a04b131e1fe","fcf48e5fb3f94b8cdea7735810093d18fa15eda0","84fefa40a732d2150eb5dd07c4542cbe67f8d234","2d815f7af7ada8fb2652c865c13633e3e115e125","75db285cf22967778fec609d6d5735ea229e9d57","0e532a35450a9c6fe6cc5d5bf4b6471eca4d3f43","7f2512999282187c88521f13ac57d4f62e3e4ca0","62fc11bf8010441ea2c158207de9192215d6bfb6","27faf7a189f5ec03ae3a60dd405ab16aaec09e05","eaa797f780820c955e991f16a7b7e5fccb2c6a97","16efa09660022bc145a1aa3ca1b79137f442b0a7","b0549edac927d487f182825726edae1e23bfffe3","16cfd5b01c5efe823756dd7d6b11bd263d80a470","9187af41659647f3f2fb02b4d961a8d74ace44dd","e948292f92f8a76644768077fc248404e6d7fdc5","6c664272320aaa4622f6595e0c65a920b89de8d8","87ba5bc9ee2d37787625ed4a315ad1d4d6a29c52","8ca77165d870e005b299b89c4ec2197e3216ef4c","1f5ed08692d8ee1b7ad24e984152ee40cbda120b","b93f4de8150ce41599c2b91b273dc1a25ef306d7","8efcd43225d74ab0486615064a818727cf9cc027","40e5a0a6effb6d703233f659bfaaca7a3842fd12","ebcc78447241ec216b054ae05f786f00ecf0888e","15085ea0118d8bf503eee35196b6fe0258dace53","01d121c2ea5fce6d8d99ec50b4884623ce3e36da","d33ad11b8712e7858d212bd116c714d9297d676b","7db07f121c52565056044a05b36777fd6656f72e","f613b0c959d3abed74e5eeb58d1a92c527df7d99"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"A salt-sensitive 3'(2'),5'-bisphosphate nucleotidase involved in sulfate activation.","doi":"10.1126/science.7809627","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1126/science.7809627","venue":"Science"}

A method has been developed to estimate the effects of slight unbalanced network conditions for steady-state operation. A conventional power flow is followed by a linear incremental calculation using a three-phase model of the network. The unbalanced condition is handled like a multiple unbalanced fault. The process is illustrated for the case of a transformer bank with nonidentical single-phase units. The results show the effects of different transformer reactances and different voltage ratios, respectively.","inCitations":["961e0e72bdc75b9eafbc5bb7193280a13e35e37e","873637be3ebff9f0b2bb79644a546a08aa1a4d89","4343a7fdf531877ee41069387e5c50481e63c743","bdc7ccad7197f578dd63287e2a43fcca934d6764"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Estimation of steady-state unbalanced system conditions combining conventional power flow and fault analysis software","doi":"10.1109/59.486128","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/59.486128","venue":""}

Currently, satellite images, aerial images and aerial LiDAR data are mostly used to build 3D models and textures from oblique aerial photographs or terrestrial photographs are used to create 3D image models. However, we are in need of quality 3D image models as current models cannot express topographic and features most elaborately and realistically. Thus, this study analyzed techniques to use aerial photographs, aerial LiDAR, terrestrial photographs and terrestrial LiDAR to create a 3D image model with artificial features and special topographic that emphasize spatial accuracy, delicate depiction and photo-realistic imaging. A 3D image model with spatial accuracy and photographic texture was built to be served via 3D image map services systems on the Internet. As it was necessary to consider intended use and display scale when building 3D image models, in this study, we applied the concept of LoD(Level of Detail) to define 3D image model of buildings in five levels and established the models by following the levels.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Application of Photo-realistic Modeling and Visualization Using Digital Image Data in 3D GIS","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

ELE teacher candidates were required to draw human body and complete the scale of attitude toward life science. On the other hand, individual interview was conducted with two professors. The results showed that ELE teacher candidates who enrolled in professor-A’s (who has a studentcentered approach) class had or at least tended to have more positive attitudes toward Biology than those who enrolled in professor-B’s (who has a teacher-centered approach) class.ELE teacher candidates who attend professor-A class had higher achievement in the Biology course than those who attend professor-B class.The stu dy also examined whether attitudes are associated with achievement measured by participants’ drawing of human bodily function by utilizing multiple linear regression, but showed no significant effect of attitude toward life science on achievement regarding Biology.","inCitations":["441637f5801b6b9f89452240a7609760c548607d","33b0314fad485f91e27068fe59cca3139d0ef777","3066db980ec6623ecd6f90b67b898bb522132831","272ae02340df89c4a15913326d7fd28ecc4c3f4c","57952285844924b3937052b3150dfd5079e9ffb3","bcac61b44a99c5ad89e43371c6789703552213b8","5c83adef938dedbc048831b2a97714a68060e5de"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.krepublishers.com/02-Journals/T-Anth/Anth-16-0-000-13-Web/Anth-16-1-2-000-2013-Abst-PDF/T-ANTH-SV-10-251-13-024/T-ANTH-SV-10-251-13-024-Ab%5B24%5D.pmd.pdf","http://www.krepublishers.com/02-Journals/T-Anth/Anth-16-0-000-13-Web/Anth-16-1-2-000-2013-Abst-PDF/T-ANTH-SV-10-251-13-024/T-ANTH-SV-10-251-13-024-Tx%5B24%5D.pmd.pdf"],"title":"The Effects of Professors’ Pedagogical Content Knowledge on Elementary Teacher Candidates’ Attitude and Achievement Regarding Biology","doi":"10.1080/09720073.2013.11891353","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1080/09720073.2013.11891353","venue":""}

There were no limitations with respect to publication date or language. The references of qualifying articles were also searched. We excluded studies with unclear data or overlapping studies. Twenty-three studies met our criteria, and the quality of these studies was assessed using the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN). The meta-analysis of association between Tregs and HCC was undertaken using the random-effects approach, as described by DerSimonian and Laird. Subgroup analysis was performed when at least three studies were available. Potential publication bias was assessed by visual inspection of the funnel plot, and an asymmetric plot suggested possible publication bias.\n\n\nRESULTS\nTwenty-three studies with a total of 1279 HCC patients and 547 healthy volunteers as controls were enrolled. The frequency of circulating Tregs in HCC patients was 87% higher than in healthy controls (OR = 1.87, 95%CI: 1.49-2.34). The frequency of Tregs in the HCC tumor microenvironment was significantly higher than that in tumor-surrounding tissue and biopsy specimens from healthy livers (OR = 4.04, 95%CI: 2.10-7.79, P = 0.000; OR = 2.869, 95%CI: 2.16-3.82, P = 0.000). However, subgroup analyses based on the different types of tumors or patient characteristics such as tumor size, tumor number or α fetoprotein (AFP) levels in HCC patients, showed that populations of Tregs as a whole were not significantly changed between groups (P > 0.05 for all).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThere is an obvious association between Tregs and pathogenesis of HCC. Further well-designed clinical studies are warranted to illustrate the potential role of Tregs in HCC.","inCitations":["35c11b673ae34fdc65e26f2f2dba7d054e5a5a82","7da3819ac19fa6ae5dbe80154ecadf996af8c6e9","0aa8d2ca76e770f79157b4f850fb37900b2bea91","68146866249e773ea5fb8929ade5aaea0ee30628","d88f92ccf1a31a98f55128e6e1d8c2234315676c","b4d3042a8fb0f7fb328ae75ca4ce8179e0abb686","91198d7c3f1bef01b853404043c00648691f4099","fce8c392dc9fcfdbf6c8d64501b0f9256e794f0f","735e9467415d17fc0bf55e9985040a3c070a2551","03a902f2927b54a8efbc6ac67b33bb511d2e4e40","3de31b0a818e221f4792ec7c8fba1cdb126fdc14","139a0f606a98a04e6174e05ebee60995822d0dd7","e4464612f65406cdc0976f61c471b7962aec17ab","69b78c3ad0a707fa53608d787b5ae1338eeb80f0","d683e545c5ac156248dd2b48e2c4639bfb327a30","91a32f6891ce8e3675a86d4afe860618fef320f1","b60d4037eb13bc97d3eab35fa71c872f3d5d22bf","749e43ae2034ad471bcd90f136b01fb2d288a4d8","82aa5abcc4b3620633ed801bc20a3d14791c5ef2","b24c3d353b57b0e99c0ac4730d0aec331a3f02c7","2da03865ac3928eeb784eb43414020d350bf0f33","f1c3b26b2f6d8e70a0e03c59a5fabf964e5b9c6a","7d7a68faea01dda392ffa49b08172da4c588f0cd","941a79ab0d89a3187c51dddfa6433a23f7812f09"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Roles of Tregs in development of hepatocellular carcinoma: a meta-analysis.","doi":"10.3748/wjg.v20.i24.7971","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.3748/wjg.v20.i24.7971","venue":"World journal of gastroenterology"}

Evans blue, employed as a counter-stain, resulted in improved contrast, thus making the test easier to interpret, yet did not significantly diminish the specific yellow-green fluorescence. Occasional crossreactions were observed with specimens from individuals with viral, bacterial, mycotic, and parasitic infections as well as with degenerative diseases. Although cross-reactions were frequently observed in individuals with mucocutaneous leishmaniasis, negative results were reported from L. tropica patients. Reliable testing for visceral leishmaniasis fluorescent antibodies was possible even when dried blood smears were used instead of serum.","inCitations":["6354ba7d7caa39e5325f43cf220982aa922b084b","1098048509e28409f1f05819258a0a460bd9b1a4","89409106c4377b83d17d4d24fe7027c05493f7ca","e0e20435b2a9c851c5d2111437b1fb101f6ba9e4","66317352054a7c1384810d2b7a27f33531889cd1","ae43cab14630266d9ccc682375c1d86bdee1b425","4190170ac29b2131021008f113bfe4195a68eb41","c7847a51ea4888359ac3ef45af0b3971dcd12cf6","4acbb66963e42dc4a1975aa410ba80c8dbc05e05","da20d12f7139a68addd1760ee8ec61162b1a1135","74e53991b4dc5171a6cdcb5f6ecc04970742094d","544df12ea015244b858b2acfbcfaf79b5180209d","5f0abd76a83e1a43000a90ebcce2478fd1ab859d","a07d5ee65aeb0ffe45ac136c1c232f1982272dd8","ffde7058331aa4ebce7fdf5c966d817949372d62","b9684796487992a3fc13f5eeba97bf44e6df608a","f74fb07bd4a685a30adb921d7386dbc6416683c5","18f13abb1dbddf4c7ae3c9d281d3702a321efca9","0ef2b7315c9e8f32cd0d3b62831f5745bf832b75","33dbeb66a0c8341bd66101cc5de0c03cf4c961c4","f85ddc57bfa9d2820e35ccbfc8278c214e03eb12","847e66afef9209f24271708d75f0d7ff5c6ab445","12a41ea6b66cf2b4b1a7e480f54dce5f4fae40f2","343b61855b204452b7398ec6272546e77d10d39c","4283565ab35d8899dc0ad7cc182261738076a8eb","05809501cf2ae852bbe51d6788a262640496dca7","c3587420c82dcc0d42cd731db69ac684c05b221f","7afdc352d44cb99a215d9667f3ec40f48b1811d4","26fdb238905d3a6cc5531def447c27114e1b85f0"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Fluorescent Antibody Test for the Serodiagnosis of Visceral Leishmaniasis.","doi":"10.4269/ajtmh.1964.13.525","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.4269/ajtmh.1964.13.525","venue":"The American journal of tropical medicine and hygiene"}

At present Finland is implementing the EEC legislation, Sweden and Norway will probably do so shortly and Denmark has been a member of the EEC since 1973. Current food legislation in Sweden only covers materials or articles intended to come into contact with foodstuffs during processing or packaging in the food industry or by retailers. It does not apply to food packaging materials purchased for use at home or to household utensils. Upon request, the Toxicology Division at the Swedish National Food Administration (NFA) carries out evaluations of materials intended to come into contact with food. In addition, a voluntary organization--Normpack--is currently operating in Sweden. Normpack consists of manufacturers, dealers and users of food packaging materials, who have agreed to abide by certain common standards. In Norway, the Packaging Convention (Emballasjekonvensjonen--on safety of food packaging material from the health point view) serves a similar purpose. Research in this field is conducted at the National Food Agency of Denmark, The Danish Packaging and Transportation Research Institute (ETi) of the Danish Technological Institute (DTI), the Food Research Laboratory at the Technical Research Centre of Finland, MATFORSK, Norconserv and Statoil in Norway and the NFA, PackForsk and the Swedish Institute for Food Research (SIK) in Sweden.

Ces piqures sont tres repondues chez les apiculteurs qui sous-estiment souvent la gravite des reactions allergiques. Methodes Il s’agit d’une etude descriptive evaluant la prevalence des reactions allergiques liees aux piqures d’abeilles et le profil immunologique de 67 apiculteurs choisis au hasard dans la region de Sousse, Tunisie. Resultats L’âge moyen des apiculteurs est de 48,5 ± 15 (17–80 ans), 94 % sont de sexe masculin (n = 63). Le nombre de piqures recues par an est tres variable (1–1800 piqures) : en moyenne 108 piqure/an. Une reaction normale (douleur, œdeme, erytheme) est presente dans 75 % des cas. Une reaction allergique locale etendue se voit au debut de l’exercice, chez 31,3 % des apiculteurs, et persiste chez le 1/3 de ces sujets, elle evolue vers la systematisation dans 9,6 % des cas. Une reaction systemique legere (urticaire, malaise, anxiete) existe chez 23,9 % des apiculteurs, obtenue apres 8 piqures en moyenne, et apparait en moyenne 7 mois apres le debut de l’exercice. La reaction systemique forte (douleur abdominale, oppression thoracique, urticaire, malaise…) est notee chez 5 apiculteurs (7,5 %), elle se voit 8 mois apres le debut de l’exercice, avec un delai moyen d’apparition de 33 minutes. Au total, 3 % des apiculteurs ont presente un choc anaphylactique. L’etude biologique montre des taux eleves d’eosinophiles (24 % des apiculteurs), des IgE totales eleves chez 7,7 % des apiculteurs, des IgE specifiques des venins d’abeilles RAST positifs chez 40,4 %, les IgG specifiques sont eleves chez 75 % des sujets. Les tests cutanes allergiques vis-a-vis des venins d’abeilles ainsi que la desensibilisation n’ont pas ete pratiques vu l’absence d’extraits en Tunisie. Discussion Le risque de developper une allergie au venin d’abeilles est frequent les 18 premiers mois de l’exercice. Le nombre de piqures n’est pas un facteur de risque pour developper cette allergie. Conclusion Les reactions allergiques aux venins d’hymenopteres sont frequentes surtout la premiere annee de l’activite professionnelle et potentiellement graves chez les apiculteurs. L’immunotherapie specifique est souvent necessaire vu l’efficacite prouvee.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Allergie au venin d’abeilles : enquête épidémiologique réalisée dans la région de Sousse, Tunisie","doi":"10.1016/j.reval.2018.02.051","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.reval.2018.02.051","venue":""}

Schafer","ids":["78157801"]}],"journalName":"Purinergic Signalling","paperAbstract":"Our previous studies with a line of Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells (FL-MDCK) transfected with FLAG-labeled α, β, and γ subunits of epithelial Na+ channel (ENaC) showed that, although most of the short-circuit current (Isc) was amiloride sensitive (AS-Isc), there was also an amiloride-insensitive component (NS-Isc) due to Cl− secretion (Morris and Schafer, J Gen Physiol 120:71–85, 2002). In the present studies, we observed a progressive increase in NS-Isc and a corresponding decrease in AS-Isc during experiments. There was a significant negative correlation between AS-Isc and NS-Isc both in the presence and absence of treatment with cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). NS-Isc could be attributed to both cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) and a 4, 4'-diisothiocyano-2, 2'-disulfonic acid stilbene (DIDS)-sensitive Ca2+-activated Cl− channel (CaCC). Continuous perfusion of both sides of the Ussing chamber with fresh rather than recirculated bathing solutions, or addition of hexokinase (6 U/ml), prevented the time-dependent changes and increased AS-Isc by 40–60%, with a proportional decrease in NS-Isc. Addition of 100 μM adenosine triphosphate (ATP) in the presence of luminal amiloride produced a transient four-fold increase in NS-Isc that was followed by a sustained increase of 50–60% above the basal level. ATP release from the monolayers, measured by bioluminescence, was found to occur across the apical but not the basolateral membrane, and the apical release was tripled by cAMP treatment. These data show that constitutive apical ATP release, which occurs under both basal and cAMP-stimulated conditions, underlies the time-dependent rise in Cl− secretion and the proportional fall in ENaC-mediated Na+ absorption in FL-MDCK cells. Thus, endogenous ATP release can introduce a significant confounding variable in experiments with this and similar epithelial cells, and it may underlie at least some of the observed interaction between Cl− secretion and Na+ absorption.","inCitations":["f855fcbb7887dd3a2b7b989db20d70d34b59fef1","4f62b34ec85a6fcc75ab46aa7004518e20245d9e","0590843438397f0f095250644e450c1765bb423c","e23c65a314952c8c09d131d1f62e9092b4963ba7"],"pdfUrls":["ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/pmc/16/92/Purinergic_Signal_2008_Jun_8_4(2)_125-137.tar.gz"],"title":"Endogenous ATP release inhibits electrogenic Na+ absorption and stimulates Cl− secretion in MDCK cells","doi":"10.1007/s11302-007-9053-3","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11302-007-9053-3","venue":"Purinergic Signalling"}

The Project aimed at the identification of alternative measures that could help in the preservation of traditional agriculture methodologies – as a support for landscape preservation and rural community well-being in naturally preserved areas. The High Nature Value Farmland (HNVF) is at present one of the European priorities for rural development. The traditional agricultural system that contributes to the preservation of biodiversity ( plant and animal species and associations dependent on this environment), habitat and rural landscape conservation , natural resources protection and preservation, tradition and custom asssociation with the natural cycle.
