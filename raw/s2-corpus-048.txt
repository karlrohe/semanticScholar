This study investigated the most stressful patient symptoms as reported by 111 hospice family caregivers of cancer (n=66) and cardiopulmonary (n=45) patients. Researchers calculated the mean level of stress caregivers attributed to 32 different patient symptoms commonly encountered at end of life. They found the symptoms perceived as most stressful for caregivers were psychological in nature. Study findings suggest that members of the hospice interdisciplinary team should connect patients and their caregivers to various types of support to address psychological symptoms, benefitting patients and caregivers alike.","inCitations":["cbdedd6942316831d606c0910c66d52cf114da76","d92b9720b2dca85d7f9c41d6cd32c17d5606cd78"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"The Stress of Sadness","doi":"10.1177/1049909114540034","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1177/1049909114540034","venue":"The American journal of hospice & palliative care"}

Recent work shows that phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3-K) is coupled to the EGFR only in NSCLC cell lines expressing ErbB-3 and that EGFR inhibitors do not inhibit PI3-K signaling in these cells. The central role PI3-K plays in cell survival suggests that a PI3-K inhibitor offers a strategy to increase the antitumor activity of EGFR inhibitors in resistant NSCL tumors that do not express ErbB-3. We show that PX-866, a PI3-K inhibitor with selectivity for p110alpha, potentiates the antitumor activity of gefitinib against even large A-549 NSCL xenografts giving complete tumor growth control in the early stages of treatment. A-549 xenograft phospho-Akt was inhibited by PX-866 but not by gefitinib. A major toxicity of PX-866 administration was hyperglycemia with decreased glucose tolerance, which was reversed upon cessation of treatment. The decreased glucose tolerance caused by PX-866 was insensitive to the AMP-activated protein kinase inhibitor metformin but reversed by insulin and by the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma activator pioglitazone. Prolonged PX-866 administration also caused increased neutrophil counts. Thus, PX-866, by inhibiting PI3-K signaling, may have clinical use in increasing the response to EGFR inhibitors such as gefitinib in patients with NSCLC and possibly in other cancers who do not respond to EGFR inhibition.","inCitations":["1eddfc0edf0863a7ae41ce62dfca116177aad52a","b3dd72350b0430025c7134fb79636a416ad0bb53","f5b2bd80d2591e1a58cb27983db988290a6a3ccc","bfa75e09d3ee79f650b1924e3953fc94abe7935c","015ffea256d09f2c71e1460087b07dca07e5cdb7","0a9ea96b737d5dad2480be9ac88c9c5e0dbd2cf1","d48b47d5aba87d68db414aefb9ed5c1bbfa396c9","53ec222d767837ac8cb2c79595facf731dd548d2","795e6deeed53462c0e06216dac2d20d8a569cd4d","31949bd0266193fc0d0c6d7ac7ec4a38025db333","69c8cd4621328d7fd2826de10e533e8f0a332445","ee293624a90f66c5058a97a7118d37605e650a6f","d03a7e599f1fbe4e1bec0939eed2374711b4c673","ba3ac8528db98cf27e528726bfb61ad5b6c193b3","6006223c48115459fed7ff506d655b59efc4ee88","ff6366d486af7d05e65a1b5e2f97629cb7d4d4a9","2c40d1cb90b9919278335badff7406e55c87c454","8739430e28713efbb21b8f42915dc2f84e4ec435","7ce6eda2a2b0b46a9148ecfe6304b2a515de61fd","f78443213f9fa254db4eaf0d62d9702c15cb8a09","2189ef5f2b5439b63f6934ea5e388a49f9fc3ee5","e42eb0b3f2fccc8f9a0f51de7ac6996da96cb6df","fbd4595395247639200d2b7088acd8d938bfa612","121d9d5007da5021a8b0b1dd7e17274d59080ecf","f74d379a7c99a2db5026e9809049645cd1b3cf5a","a871b8a62ed7a1a021a5e5ed3d571e7e6ee032e3","3e7f0c46b4b9b49e866585190982aac62e23a333","0501270d651a012eed0e44de8d1fcae3dc2cb517","e4a0a41af9424cc8629137a017f18a11c36f89d3","d73f53ac2d2b4461d1a5c01a3381e1c514ef30ef","0db82c88e0f5e04cb1e41f95df15766b04a8c682","28a330059888470edcf100e3e0bc94a1c0904e93","08b04d12b38bea990cbe9c71579c99ab29e377c1","cd4ce727010bde139a1b0d74c10215ad5b55a90c","42d9efb20f5e7f370f79a470d2da5d6b31ac507a","d5f5deaa865740d208bf79f9ef408baf91f5f0ce","e7b447cce3154f7463337c86675144b6ca65b85f","7910fb8b9112909640d62fdb8fed58ef7a17ef6c","51155fcca3e219a96d59576381ad2f164b99c42d","25b7d4ea1f2c4bb3711244dfc25d616eabb33d87","7f4080a28c1618ceeb21a63d05387657dd66f708","fecea57061c03f302f71b7826968091cbf602235","5ece0217c26ed5d71c30a6f5cc67539a06695e80","b4091ef75f32c46586fd7e2ccf3f9332279a7479","c17033f729928c6eaa77031c8da6c1afc88c8d7f","d2b428c65211656e11fd33c2f3396e9301a008f7","a0bb745a3a0c536b26d6adf61952e046953f1096","5dad83ebafbfd645e8099e442d380d3cb77f552e","341064fa9d4ad656579db591af3016f469809502","626d7fe721df3ae47a7eef7859f2012b3394e2e8","c2678b6eb69ac4ee5378c5ce504e0811b5dee9e7","5d30d5d140f69f2a569ab5d353277aa7c43b6fe2","1dfeb82b72002612ea0b770c9094bf3f05772f5a","8b63be8334af1bd15ce69dee683878d35e3c2cb0","4184f4796d5e3a20bedbf75724422a934434b52a","4fe74c24a0a8b02b9872e0c9b44d2b07520cc34b","0e27165ead002bdb82ed29bc8813935a6680143b","4cc9f2f358b5cb98091dc820548c86c99eb8677e","e1e2158a80878c87829257e5b70c4e60d74d50c0","d487fec95c4c50eab179cd946d98ebd7afc60169","cf8381f70305dcfedf399b3195cce8e1eb4dc56f","b659d139f5760d965070c6ffbb00c5cccfe36916","e6295cc258ee2fba870007d03c6b54752bc083ae","6b116029b96da1c0346543a117a4b8a15e7fa2cc","33792e3a422689bf56e1891c9a25efe0d1e80822","e498b72af7e9633a11561d8a3bf5adcddbc871d1","05b2a3e5713dd349f39981a8dd044afa0e54a5e0","4f7f2f476d92091f63fefa9521efa198c8e9a01b","0deead55e26315f3baa068227ea42b4c5faae643","86a62dd7fe697fe24c9a30f2db4a799e17751ff0","de50ef3c9d36a58b2217a6f425126be8abfcb617","eb0c51fa6059b1d5b8794a3ca29b45bcf77f51bd","1a32a9102ecf137d1a76ce7d78c3f59570d49411","e65eed1cbd24881dbc720c322f03737eb7998c48","e9bddaebbc115d045f356e472eecb1f2153544e2","fa26b84f67548781ee2bba17141360d6bdd6f58c","5381b16fd56af7452bb4b32ad165b7efd18422a6","3b91f667372bbc5295a89f0e576979db6f3ceea4","9740cca4e46102701c923e548c6cb3425d3f7e84"],"pdfUrls":["http://mct.aacrjournals.org/content/molcanther/4/9/1349.full.pdf"],"title":"The phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase inhibitor PX-866 overcomes resistance to the epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor gefitinib in A-549 human non-small cell lung cancer xenografts.","doi":"10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-05-0149","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-05-0149","venue":"Molecular cancer therapeutics"}

The causes of pre-eclampsia are unclear but it is proposed that a factor released from the placenta triggers the maternal symptoms. One possible triggering factor is dead trophoblasts that are shed from the placenta, then deported to become trapped in the maternal pulmonary capillaries. It is hypothesized that trophoblasts die by apoptosis in normal pregnancy, but by necrosis in pre-eclampsia. Deported trophoblasts may be phagocytosed by the pulmonary endothelial cells and we have previously shown that phagocytosis of necrotic trophoblasts leads to the activation of endothelial cells, accompanied by the release of interleukin-6 from these cells. However, the mechanistic pathway linking phagocytosis of necrotic trophoblasts and endothelial cell activation is unknown. Here we show that, after phagocytosis of necrotic, but not apoptotic, trophoblasts, endothelial cells secrete TGFbeta1. Using recombinant endoglin to inhibit the function of TGFbeta1 we have shown that the TGFbeta1 does not directly activate endothelial cells but rather it induces endothelial IL-6 secretion. The IL-6 then induces endothelial cell activation. Inhibiting either TGFbeta1 or IL-6 prevented endothelial cell activation in response to phagocytosing necrotic trophoblasts, but inhibiting IL-6 did not prevent secretion of TGFbeta1, confirming the order of signalling. IL-6 also reduced endothelial cell-surface endoglin but increased the amount of soluble endoglin released from placental explants. These interactions between the IL-6 and TGFbeta1 pathways in both the endothelium and placenta may help to regulate the maternal response to deported trophoblasts in pregnancy.","inCitations":["956b1c245617d98bd0e1764da6b58b7e0ac294b2","528f959d017857c8342d11de502bc83ea8dfc3f2","0a5014a9cc70e1f494027cd99f155d702fa42883","d49df40edf6ab07557fd972b94eccbb92e57337c","5e4daaae07ef5f310009b7061257998d50869aed","bd8d5890290744f21becf1316036d61d5bdbbd85","4510b506536293877b8cd106cc3eab8548aaed07","c2f7e50d9d76130470656b188724fba12d3834da","775155ce2dd44016ca2decacd712db6dba97e6a8","297b4383980a39aed7e36441815e55a4c4cfa8a5","1e4f36139ef437c341e564eb60fad85c0f6dbff6","c795e2553f1f5a8fdfb343d2fbb25ce539054e72","111f56f8fe73800069bf1fd0b2eb5dc99a444ea1","5d419d02b695ff7d709d2930406e896ff49a7f1f","27d67169f155a76e341eea9abb24fa59641ead25","cdf9f4813f6a5ab572d3924427c65f2f545964d3","e66c000807b022d4625a8a9126d99b3177813aaa","0d89dab119a3da39bac99ce19723bb886be12e7b","34afac71746edb2929e9620e3320d41d516647b9","770d8a9cedd9ca19eea22170dfcb576f41280d48","5b96795c1851f6fc13d0605883555814bc42ff24","308c53c81ebfb5cae7c45e75c143284bff24936b"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"The role of autocrine TGFbeta1 in endothelial cell activation induced by phagocytosis of necrotic trophoblasts: a possible role in the pathogenesis of pre-eclampsia.","doi":"10.1002/path.2690","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1002/path.2690","venue":"The Journal of pathology"}

These securities allow a market organizer to infer the likelihood of events of interest as well as if he knew all of the traders' private signals. We consider the design of markets that are always informative, markets that are informative for a particular signal structure of the participants, and informative markets constructed from a restricted selection of securities. We find that to achieve informativeness, it can be necessary to allow participants to express information that may not be directly of interest to the market organizer, and that understanding the participants' signal structure is important for designing informative prediction markets.","inCitations":["0049502b44c0394f1d4be3efb298b99a60f1c53b","dc811c47d4ae68385397353c196876fc796613e3","945adb2c646bacec3b6a57618f07c91615b38498","b1466bc16dc81a26623478647926ff13a54fdcbe","d6caa1940ca945d2deec00fd02672eb44e20e3de","f52c59129d745eea36592173c881be36324c2b71","e41daa2e9ff18740e453f0ad85439f0bad77c299","536d867754889d96265972eb2722ef05c58d2a4c"],"pdfUrls":["http://yiling.seas.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/informativesecurities.pdf","https://arxiv.org/pdf/1210.4837v1.pdf","http://www.jennwv.com/papers/informativesecurities.pdf","https://dslpitt.org/uai/papers/12/p185-chen.pdf","http://www.cs.ucla.edu/~jenn/papers/informativesecurities.pdf","http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/econcs/pubs/chen_uai12.pdf","https://dslpitt.org/uai/displayArticleDetails.jsp?article_id=2280&mmnu=1&proceeding_id=28&smnu=2","http://www.cs.unsyiah.ac.id/~frdaus/PenelusuranInformasi/File-Pdf/203_pdfsam_proceedings.pdf","http://www.auai.org/uai2012/papers/246.pdf","http://arxiv.org/abs/1210.4837","http://arxiv.org/pdf/1210.4837v1.pdf"],"title":"Designing Informative Securities","doi":"","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"UAI"}

The fast phase inversion of PVDF helps to form the core-shell structure of a microfiber and guarantees the in situ encapsulation of ionic liquid. The hybrid microfiber can then spiral and be further solidified to maintain the helical structure with increasing flow rates of the injection fluids. Because of the feasible and precise control of the injection fluids during the microfluidic spinning, the resultant microsprings have controlled core-shell structures, helical pitches, and corresponding electromechanical properties. By further embedding them into stretchable films, the simple paradigm of a flexible device shows great conductive performance in tensile tests and even motion cycles, which could be explored as a promising candidate in stretchable sensors, flexible electronics, and electronic skins.","inCitations":["47e9510d6e7bda9496c09e41aa278cf13ff3e17a","f83c017bdd3c9b75178b3caef1748c8829d45447"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Microfluidic Generation of Microsprings with Ionic Liquid Encapsulation for Flexible Electronics","doi":"10.34133/2019/6906275","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.34133/2019%2F6906275","venue":"Research"}

Screening strategies included liquid-based cytology (LBC) every three years, human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA testing every three and five years, respectively, and a combination of HPV DNA testing and LBC (HPV+LBC) every three and five years, respectively. Model outcomes included cumulative incidence over 20 years, cumulative risk of cervical cancer, costs, life year saved (LYS), quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and benefits. The cost-effectiveness ratios (CERs), incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs), cost-utility ratios (CURs), and benefit-cost ratios (BCRs) were used as outcomes in the health economic evaluation analysis. Univariate sensitivity analyses were performed to examine the stability of the results.\n\n\nResults\nThe cumulative incidence of the five screening strategies ranged from 833.02 to 1,158.07 cases per 100,000 females. HPV DNA testing was most effective in reducing the cumulative risk of cervical cancer, saving life years and QALYs and gaining benefits. The CERs of HPV DNA testing every three and five years, and LBC every three years were considered to be very cost-effective if they were below China's GDP per capita. The CERs of HPV+LBC were considered to be cost-effective if they were below three times GDP per capita. The incremental cost-effectiveness analysis showed that HPV DNA testing every three and five years, LBC every three years and HPV+LBC every five years were dominant strategies.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe findings of this study indicated that HPV DNA testing every five years or LBC every three years should be recommended in urban China.","inCitations":["b966ca858778aa7bf347455fd6a5d449ac3a2267"],"pdfUrls":["https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/pmc/oa_pdf/a3/ed/cjcr-31-6-974.PMC6955165.pdf"],"title":"Economic evaluation of cervical cancer screening strategies in urban China","doi":"10.21147/j.issn.1000-9604.2019.06.13","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.21147/j.issn.1000-9604.2019.06.13","venue":"Chinese journal of cancer research = Chung-kuo yen cheng yen chiu"}

Here, we characterized a group A bZIP gene from “Kyoho” grapevine, VlbZIP30, which was shown to be induced by abscisic acid (ABA) and dehydration stress. Overexpression of VlbZIP30 in transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana enhanced dehydration tolerance. Transcriptome analysis revealed that a major proportion of ABA-responsive and/or drought-responsive genes are transcriptionally regulated by VlbZIP30 during ABA or mannitol treatment at the cotyledon greening stage. We identified an A. thaliana G-box motif (CACGTG) and a potential grapevine G-box motif (MCACGTGK) in the promoters of the 39 selected A. thaliana genes upregulated in the transgenic plants and in the 35 grapevine homologs, respectively. Subsequently, using two grapevine-related databases, we found that 74% (23/31) and 84% (21/25) of the detected grapevine genes were significantly upregulated by ABA and drought stress, respectively, suggesting that these genes are involved in ABA or dehydration stress and may be regulated by VlbZIP30 in grapevine. We propose that VlbZIP30 functions as a positive regulator of dehydration-responsive signaling in the ABA core signaling pathway.Crop genetics: drought tolerance gene found in grapeResearchers in China have identified a key gene involved in drought resistance in grapes. After exposing grape plants to drought, Xiping Wang’s team at Northwest A&F University observed increased expression of the VlbZIP30 gene. VlbZIP30 expression also increased in response to the plant hormone ABA, a known regulator of stress response. Further investigation demonstrated that VlbZIP30 probably regulates ABA signaling, though its precise activity remains unclear. The researchers discovered a genetic sequence consistently present in the promoters of genes activated by VlbZIP30. They also identified over 30 genes regulated by VlbZIP30. While many of these genes are probably involved in drought tolerance, more work will be needed to clarify their functions. These findings may serve to guide efforts to breed or engineer grape varieties with improved drought tolerance.","inCitations":["c2b612906ccdfc658ecca5bf5d0ce0afe8d4828c","cb0bb4ea4d094c42d725075e4cccbdd8966fefd0","0e1e8d9fb3ec88048cdef4c007132d43019b01a7","b82499c8df81442df97c7122a052d85d51e90114"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"VlbZIP30 of grapevine functions in dehydration tolerance via the abscisic acid core signaling pathway","doi":"10.1038/s41438-018-0054-x","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41438-018-0054-x","venue":"Horticulture Research"}

KB sering identic dengan pembatasan jumlah anak, dengan adanya slogan “Dua Anan Cukup”. Sebenarnya KB tidak terbatas pada pengertian tersebut, tetapi meliputi perencanaan keluarga. Masalah yang diteliti dalam penelitian ini adalah : 1. Bagaimana penafsiran Sayyid Quthb terhadap ayat-ayat Al-Qur’an yang membahas tentang keluarga berencana?, 2. Bagaimana konsep keluarga berencana pada masa sekarang berdasarkan penafsiran Sayyid Quthb?. Dalam menjawab permasalahan ini, penelitian dilakukan dengan cara Library Research dengan metode analisis data menggunakan metode penafsiran Maudhu'i. Data primer yang digunakan berasal dari penjelasan-penjelasan mufassir pada kitab tafsirnya sedangkan data sekunder berasal dari buku-buku yang relevan dengan penelitian ini. Ada dua tujuan yang ingin dicapai dalam penelitian ini yaitu untuk mendiskripsikan pendapat Sayyid Quthb tentang ayat-ayat yang mengulas tentang keluarga berencana dan konsep keluarga berencana masa sekarang berdasarkan penafsiran Sayyid Quthb. Hasil penelitian tentang konsep keluarga berencana di sini sebenarnya tidak ada larangan asalkan sesuai dengan syariat yang telah ditentukan. Islam sendiri sangat menganjurkan untuk melakukan keluarga berencana agar dari pernikahan tersebut nanti terlahir keturunan yang sehat dan berkualitas.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Keluarga berencana dalam al-Qur'an (studi tematik tafsir Sayyid Quthb)","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Chapter One establishes how the unique threats posed by HIV to the physical and moral integrity of individuals and societies incites potentially divisive reactions that perpetuate harmful understandings of HIV and those it touches. In contrast, the creative medium of film offers a flexible framework for meditation in which the significations of HIV can be explored and confronted constructively and inclusively. Quebec, owing to its historical situation, its distinctive and vibrant cinematic heritage and status as a hub for HIV/AIDS-related activity and solidarity, represents a rich microcosm of the different social, political and creative dynamics at play within the AIDS crisis. Chapter Two establishes how documentary can enact objective investigations of the AIDS crisis that methodically deconstruct prevalent misconceptions of HIV and People living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHAs). These intellectual studies are also juxtaposed with subjective material that evokes the emotional aspects of the crisis. Chapter Three illustrates how testimonial film can catalyse the interrogation by PLWHAs of their relationship with their HIV-positive status. Through the process of filmmaking, PLWHAs can better comprehend the trauma provoked by their status and form friendships and communities built on the discursive and cathartic act of sharing. Chapter Four explains how feature film, exploiting the popular mechanisms of storytelling and characterisation, can bring considerations of HIV to both niche and broader audiences, potentially provoking far-reaching contemplations of the virus. The thesis concludes by summarising how, thanks to its idiosyncratic filmic tradition, Quebec’s cinematic representations of HIV/AIDS were varied and revealing, questioning and nuancing problematic understandings of HIV and PLWHAs and successfully investigating the AIDS crisis as a local and global phenomenon of human proportions.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://etheses.whiterose.ac.uk/16691/2/Bailey_AG_SLCS_PhD_2016.pdf","http://etheses.whiterose.ac.uk/16691/1/Bailey_AG_SLCS_PhD_2016.pdf"],"title":"The Representations of HIV/AIDS in Québec Cinema, 1986-1996","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Classification by these components could be useful in characterizing subtypes of hypertension which may have a role in selecting treatment strategies. However, hemodynamic phenotypes of a large, stable, outpatient population with hypertension remain unknown.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe included 34,238 people, with systolic blood pressure of ≥130mmHg, who underwent impedance cardiography at 51 sites of iKang Health Checkup Centers throughout China between 2012 and 2018. Hemodynamic parameters measured included: stroke volume, stroke volume index, heart rate, cardiac output, cardiac index, systemic vascular resistance, and systemic vascular resistance index. We characterized these by systolic blood pressure categories and assessed patient characteristics associated with the ratio of cardiac index to systemic vascular resistance index.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAmong the study cohort (n=33,414; mean age 52±13years; 36.6% female), 49%, 40%, and 11% had systolic blood pressure130-139, 140-159, and≥160mmHg, respectively. Among patients with systolic blood pressure 140-159mmHg, 9353 (70%) had high systemic vascular resistance index but normal/low cardiac index, 1949 (15%) had high cardiac index but low/normal systemic vascular resistance index, and 2053 (15%) had low/normal cardiac index and systemic vascular resistance index. Using multivariable analysis, we found that cardiac index to systemic vascular resistance index ratio was negatively associated with age and body mass index (all P<0.05; R-square 0.16, 0.12 and 0.09 for systolic blood pressure 130-139, 140-159 and≥160mmHg, respectively).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nDifferent hemodynamic blood pressure phenotypes were identified across all hypertensive blood pressure categories. While individual characteristics were associated with the cardiac index to systemic vascular resistance index ratio, they only weakly explained the variation.","inCitations":["4abc849ceb773a8f8498b3ae47d9c1dee4dd82e9","60e161140c2a0bb0bfe8be3af3d04c3f046a4cab"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Hemodynamic Phenotypes of Hypertension Based on Cardiac Output and Systemic Vascular Resistance.","doi":"10.1016/j.amjmed.2019.08.042","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amjmed.2019.08.042","venue":"The American journal of medicine"}

They have been used as efficient delivery vehicles for antisense oligonucleotides targeting the interior of cells. We demonstrate that dendriplexes formed from anti-HIV oligodeoxynucleotides ANTI-TAR, GEM91, and SREV in complex with generation 4 maltose (PPI-Mal G4) and maltotriose (PPI-Mal-III G4) modified poly(propylene imine) dendrimers are able to self-assemble into highly organized 1D and 3D nanostructures. The resulting nanostructures were characterized by fluorescence methods, laser Doppler electrophoresis, dynamic light scattering (DLS), atomic force microscopy (AFM) and molecular modeling. The results show that ANTI-TAR and GEM 91 dendriplexes self-assemble into fibrils with length scales up to several hundreds of nm. SREV, on the contrary, forms quadrilateral- like 3D nanostructures. A good correlation between the various experimental methods and molecular modeling indicates the formation of those nanostructures in solution. Space symmetry of the oligonucleotides and the resulting dendriplex monomeric units are probably the most important factors which influence the way of self-assembling.","inCitations":["1affebc4d197d3765248c148ae84a0c56ec194d6","31d3d5c20cf237e25dcdd0245340135db605723a","04231f392194af709254d423965c0b706301e24e"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Highly organized self-assembled dendriplexes based on poly(propylene imine) glycodendrimer and anti-HIV oligodeoxynucleotides.","doi":"10.2174/092986712803306457","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.2174/092986712803306457","venue":"Current medicinal chemistry"}

It is important for each residency program to have a policy for parental leave that is written, that is accessible to residents, and that clearly delineates program practices regarding parental leave. At a minimum, a parental leave policy for residents and fellows should conform legally with the Family Medical Leave Act as well as with respective state laws and should meet institutional requirements of the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education for accredited programs. Policies should be well formulated and communicated in a culturally sensitive manner. The AAP advocates for extension of benefits consistent with the Family Medical Leave Act to all residents and interns beginning at the time that pediatric residency training begins. The AAP recommends that regardless of gender, residents who become parents should be guaranteed 6 to 8 weeks, at a minimum, of parental leave with pay after the infant’s birth. In addition, in conformance with federal law, the resident should be allowed to extend the leave time when necessary by using paid vacation time or leave without pay. Coparenting, adopting, or fostering of a child should entitle the resident, regardless of gender, to the same amount of paid leave (6–8 weeks) as a person who takes maternity/paternity leave. Flexibility, creativity, and advanced planning are necessary to arrange schedules that optimize resident education and experience, cultivate equity in sharing workloads, and protect pregnant residents from overly strenuous work experiences at critical times of their pregnancies.

A document–word matrix is generally sparse and has an ambiguity of synonyms. To solve this problem, we propose a method to use document vectors represented by independent components. An independent component generated by ICA is considered as a topic. In practice, we map the document vectors into a topics space. Since some independent components are useless for recommendation, we select the necessary components from all independent components by a maximum distance algorithm (MDA). Although Euclidean distance is usually used by MDA, we propose topic selection by cosine-distance-based MDA to solve the mismatch of similarities in information filtering. We create a user profile from the transformed data with a genetic algorithm (GA). Finally, we recommend documents with the user profile and evaluate the accuracy by imputation precision. We have carried out an evaluation experiment to confirm the practicality of the proposed method.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://page-one.springer.com/pdf/preview/10.1007/s10015-004-0322-8"],"title":"Information recommendation using ICA","doi":"10.1007/s10015-004-0322-8","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10015-004-0322-8","venue":"Artificial Life and Robotics"}

However, recent reappraisal of these landforms-deposits indicates that these features had been produced and deformed by landslides in Holocene. This involves reevaluation of climatic geomorphology and Quaternary geology as well as paleoenvironmental reconstruction in mountain areas. Furthermore, this also causes a stir in disaster reduction and prevention related to the wide range of landslides. At this meeting, the author will describe the details of the debris avalanche deposits (DA) found from the east side of Mount Ho-ou, the Akaishi Range, central Japan. This DA has been considered to be formed by ice-mass collapse during the global Last Glacial Maximum (tied to MIS2), resulting in prominent river aggradation of the Komugawa River (the upper Fujigawa-Kamanashigawa River system). However, the following evidences and conclusions were obtained: 1) DA consists of a thick gravel layer with granitic rock clasts only although the present-day DA lies in a sedimentary bedrock area. 2) Rock clasts have characteristic auto-brecciated or jigsaw puzzle structure suggesting strong deformation by mass rock creeping and subsequent mobilization. 3) Humic soils with wood fragments are buried immediately beneath DA. 4) DA is covered by fluvial fine sand with wood fragments along the main river, probably introduced by natural-dam obstruction. 5) Wood fragments (total 5 samples including one sample by previous study) gave the ages ranging 770-990 cal AD and 670-890 cal AD. 6) Volumetric magnitude and H/L ratio of DA are estimated to be 1.8 ∗10ˆ7 mˆ3 and 0.32, respectively. 7) The possible cause of DA was historical earthquakes (M >6.5) such as AD762 Mino-Hida-Izu Eq, AD841 Shinano Eq, AD841 Izu Eq and AD887 Goki-Shichido Eq. Either Mino-Hida-Izu Eq or Shinano Eq is believed to be the last event of the nearby Itoigawa-Shizuoka Tectonic Line active fault zone several kilometers east of Mount Ho-ou. Izu Eq could be attributable to the penultimate activity of the Tanna fault in Izu Peninsula, 120 km southeast. Goki-Shichido Eq. is considered to be caused by plate subduction along Suruga-Nankai Troughs, and it led to sector collapse and a natural-dammed lake in Yatsugatake Volcano 50 km north of the Mount Ho-ou.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://www2.jpgu.org/meeting/2011/yokou/HDS027-06.pdf","http://www2.jpgu.org/meeting/2011/yokou/HDS027-06_E.pdf"],"title":"Debris avalanche deposits in historical-time found from the east side of Mount Ho-ou, the Akaishi Range, central Japan","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Analyses of the phyllites generally define a single geochemical group based on major-and trace-element abundances. The phyllites are strongly depleted in CaO, Na 2 O, and Sr with respect to average Archean upper crust. By contrast, K 2 O, Ba, and Rb are enriched several times relative to average Archean upper crust, reflecting basin-scale K metasomatism. Transition metals are somewhat depleted, whereas high field strength elements are typically enriched relative to average Archean upper crust. Samples generally have fractionated LREE patterns (average Ce N /Sm N = 2.4) with small negative Eu anomalies (average Eu/Eu * = 0.78) and generally flat HREEs (average Gd N / Yb N = 1.3). Such geochemical characteristics suggest that the source dominantly consisted of tonalite with less common occurrences mafic volcanic rocks and granite. Mixing calculations, which massbalance the REEs and Th/Sc, suggest 70% tonalite, 15% mafic volcanic rocks, and 15% granite as possible proportions for the source of the phyllites. A nearby early Archean (~3.5 Ga) continental nucleus preserves similar lithologies and is the probable source. Intense chemical weathering of the source terrane is indicated by premetasomatized chemical index of alteration values of 95–100, nearly complete depletion of CaO and Na 2 O, and high Al 2 O 3 /Na 2 O ratios. Fine-grained sediments of comparable age and presumed tectonic setting elsewhere in southern Africa show similar geochemical characteristics, implying that source-area compositions and weathering intensities were similar. These mature platformal deposits suggest a tectonically stable environment where intense chemical weathering took place at ~3.0 Ga across southern Africa.","inCitations":["663c26b431cd1febf795219a109288e486bf975c","5241e88b87e587240248b2e0b8483b91c6d9056e","0cba44afabe51c88d083ce88d4e9c16cf8b728a0","4a261c0c3d3e78f7e30f2d116a11e0db4ee9838d","8f7344481d5e5afbf95c6002671957dbfef762a3","871c502595b23a812e7b4952b1e335325c5617bc","128d640756a71acfca62e5bf1bcd08beff96d74c","033bfcd3d8341a8840e5d143bef715fed3adf388","a68b2a930ecd620e65cf61e78883ff10812c6f31","b266e5e52688393f804d523e4843f181fcb50a0f","faa5b2d7f7582d36cbadbd26af7445ac898e0a0e","99d72e666160dc65e350fc11af0c82465156b5de","4eb48179d675ebc95dae410a3e35035f1cf34cca","b3867dc22ed97344f25f25601c4ef92adafc21ef","066b4e7813e31223c68afebd7b27562bb9b27282","90c8ac0d0a2048bc10f8f051f68cbdd804f5cbca","f194325380bb97897614822fbec9b7ae5054fe05","b83d899edf3e403d16f4c21fb3e2fd141b869b36","42de58b623465d37b19d5a35a99fbbb26fcc5934","57cf2db59afef36cd80311c095ea1768de444168","9ef4ce888c4c7c05149b1e84c2faf75f413d847e","bef2e23813ddcaa0f30a15d0c04d2d358e1be26b","ad5c6b7b4c93d11fa4a3819ecb8bd3e62c0a131a","eb0a96055c1ead43e0634c7cafb45b1e2c9b9299","e2d40ff4a7e23af0f4874732b008d0e5d53f9c54","3b19a6b946bd0cb92d62f8a6af73d3ea53c95236","bc695ce7bcd260a8af6a9ec1f377dbd726fc99dd","366698b926609023efcbf2323f5b4ec12a2fc65a","11bf1a7d9c1d65e99a8186a7ee785eec52dd68c2","9c3719a4d734cded63c94d10c4429df7b5f05f37","c90ee571e353d9f6dca6af970e209c00c7a406e7","08d40f8b9db8fe9f528c0951ba83dde2f9df88db","4c32c48f9be2738f5796f1cbbc2b58bd1404335a","5212ba3fbc2972e79e4146a7c8903f4a894ec4d2","997f18fcf9de723adf5db5cb4f242b7c6e094814","905c9011b6af90cbcb96230fac4028f1058c302a","fc031b8e2f39d03ee43e619fcf3d4cf66871da5d","0c14126827f221eb059ec69e451a5708936fb9ec","84950d55b877bb9ae4d295eaf5c59519f54e1f79","42ed0222d405eaf137c1825f16c21ffa0249dc97","8b094a9997b1aa46a4861711c8f21729a95747e9","d6ac84ad07a437f794f2c56cec42a7e06ee10165","2766a7206fa6cf78166de6dc8044451e4da10d03","ebf184b8a219487342c55f114aea8e99f9137717","6402cbde9b8d0c1d9a62f2c6189c2bc3e25ba20e","3f68b5af4844ebaad7265fa632051fa5936cbdcf","145803318c97add0ca0f32f22b609a093c9ac4d4","e13e69761a633e5ac42527c1e64227cbb7b933c6","efa31d1891b72eb811f2553d97a21aab17e5cd28","031c208c6416a3e56a500d9d32bc950b033c3a12","6dd6ea129ec2e2d41a64bdf93e7cec6a848bfb41","cbbbe10a768958bdec74039d08c14eaa8c1ef4d3","af419b92f9fe44bb1dcc88508fd7b99f0d04ffdd","a35f12c3a9d73b0077631e2e5b5ce079493f738f","36592a59ca9680ca365b7640a5315b7ba84a897c","42bcefa527bd22202fc5747b9aab54f701f02c3e","846a76895dcb985fc380887ae8b0d753107862b3","7fb8ab27254b71f2664c127c5e213fb76f1ad3ea","4ed4acd2f1418627594c172751e0da49f1614918","d23d888cb931c007e7322be888ae271eb7fcff19","d083376fc8ac52187a1334bec76ad169dee3c8d4","6f1fb41b7bf5537fcb653bdb0585a837d195b313","39d36f865abcefc4dc9feb9a5254aef7d2561551","1f7a069379fcfe342acdee9149dfd5ec7faf2fd2","51f3ce9dd09f0461f46b1ca65acdb6328bbdb664","6e17d8ff4ed09e3b585db47a3aec089113a43734","b0129ea9acd59fc01c491dc039da2fe46fcd1a82","27287152c3ebed1686f2fedb14cb4305e3e52bf9","7baedf2da3290126f26dc1f74395b1a2589549f7","3ad530765d580acc5a31b8cd0f69cb850d451149","4c48ef4a1b1e6b9126b728d452872786db4e1ade","4efadcda6ee5cc3193f4172e72c8e59f86e6c2b6","5af72f19fe3bf8e043a69584988ec8ea8e95a128","12910aad8bee754b70aa199252f4c3a0a92daf46","f0daaea8a64fcf8b612b613da4b484ba4b9e4d8d","60fc11530756dd10921877f4d6378498a62b3fe6","f0ed5783bd7bb5b034359ac68270aa0d209b8d7c","d2038e08c93a22929c4ea42f647be3015afcd760","fa3e314fea3557d0e5803db1cf153b5ac280c1c2","376a6a737c3b5a3014db3b35f400ecee9ce14d4b","ba209cd4ccaef739c0a7a442446565adca80d2c5","df4b0af5413b563cdb7f80912a5ef746286ff108","bd2943ced252d7983c41535a1a61d3b62fa1ae04","86f564e8f9115c3e15b57e5c5f88d08efbf5f6fe","b82ad7297542d2f3662658fa8e64904eea876a0d","295e9e3ce81248f73082a6023ab7905a70e98b8f","77a931a792e2b2b947c09f00ce3029af49d10ccc","57bb6314462966ec4a6065ad4962bc257599a1d6","33c0586a6c32f8d9906ae95d64ce0311854118fc","d6aa2cd1d6f4790bd270ac33ff62ff40458e5680","5dd6013fb917af3f40b9035a090804277b636f8e","3c94e85d8a2af537c8280f225da8cf97a86d865b","489cd3ed1935d27361989b7fbc45a6c52ecf0a46","f4904ee379308bc2fb02a2890423b265501dfa3d","09f987e09ab66da23ab06e78647c9fced52fcd3b","daa22facf2c548c3437290e3858da037f6e2bd43","7a9324a71bd659e3d552d645c28cb912c964e2ce","d85e67f16cf1c24ef220cc7411e09973156b8ff9","0b6573e59b5174b85bd698aaf0987ad8ae6e7d8e","100d0e78b00cd6bfc6610a7eff26d6ac28dbab80","a3d63cb8458ab3e3924b88b91813e440c7c28f19","9eaed45ff20552fc79ba0c2a4f830599e76f6012","b13164c6f38b177e6b9dd46c7435913c734a58df","db3f450f9d79488d95501654776509c376df18c2","630ad7c1ac0ab71306b5f41d1c8b9b05d6de7278","84855ea896666eae3d57150bdcfe9e8d8398cd9e","3e005fb98ac463feaff6b6a793320204f9c198f7","4335161e34d5e16aab3ad059c52053f2c6ac907e","660f69b2e06df87e24fd69aa62f00cb764be45e7","bbaa3f53de2ebc57df2b6529bb79037304204ba1","64a250615a60e96dca590985f8e2e0db10da0fdd","3a3e7bd5c0fc5ea95497dcc1b1949b36a14b216d","eb42b747f26eeb24b8130a1c0aa382554a06c63f","82cf3b87b892e57fc05667b46e60615b0939236b","b3fc6e22ce2ba285d0e43eb52d18c8b8696addc2","55a662818071492dc7326cb9bf9bb3

the widest and most diffused class of Novel Psychoactive Substances. The short- and long- term health risks associated with the consumption of SC are often unknown to both users and health professionals. This review aims to provide a synthesis of the most recent and relevant insights on the pharmacology, clinical and psychopathological aspects of SC.\n\n\nMETHOD\nA structured search of two bibliographic databases (PubMed and Scopus) was undertaken according to inclusion/exclusion criteria. The following terms \"synthetic cannabinoid*\", \"synthetic cannabimimetic*\", \"synthetic cannabis\", \"synthetic marijuana\" and \"Spice AND cannabinoid*\" were used as search strings.\n\n\nRESULTS\n162 relevant results, mainly published in the past two years were revealed. Most results emerged for the keyword \"synthetic cannabinoid*\", followed by the combination \"Spice* AND \"cannabinoid*\". Most papers were epidemiological, forensic, toxicologic, or analytical. The results of studies were systematized according their contribution to the comprehension of pharmacological, clinical and psychopathological effects of SC. Fifteen SC-related fatality cases were reviewed according to their histories, pathology and toxicology findings.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe findings of this review confirm the importance of prompt and reliable information available for health professionals More specific analytic techniques and designed preventive strategies are required to face unprecedented SC challenge.","inCitations":["d3830e0979733fd4a86169f4ea27c74c7c2444b5","cbf60c2779cd7c4092b7a9834f56664461a81e7c","6e2c1ed00ed6dcfec1d4552e7ef0b3f5fb0b7e53","162de1859f1630dec51bf8933b337dda272c715e","9277bfdf3c85a7f99abd05fc2235907399a94b4b","8fce95cdbf79b438e7932bc4e4ec091ca2685c6e","98115bf5d6eaf159fceaa76983ce7f6d6d00c975","47a8115c5962315ef39312754d5b8a512a31984c","0a3f32b22dbff812d92c634facae6b245f962f3f"],"pdfUrls":["https://uhra.herts.ac.uk/bitstream/handle/2299/19651/Martinotti_et_al._Synthetic_Cannabinoids_2_1_.pdf?isAllowed=y&sequence=3"],"title":"Synthetic Cannabinoids: Psychopharmacology, Clinical Aspects, Psychotic Onset.","doi":"10.2174/1871527316666170413101839","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.2174/1871527316666170413101839","venue":"CNS & neurological disorders drug targets"}

Legionella pneumophila is an important but uncommon respiratory pathogen with significant morbidity and mortality. Initially recognized as a fatal cause of pneumonia in the 1970s. Untreated Legionnaires’ disease conveys high mortality, therefore a prompt treatment with appropriate antibiotics is of extreme importance. Currently, therapeutic options include macrolides and fluoroquinolones mainly, that have an effective therapeutic profile. Potential issues of bacterial resistance have risen, but overall, this is not a significant limitation of therapy.

The amount of oil extracted increases significantly with increase of temperature at all levels of ethanol concentration. Equilibrium constants are reported at different concentrations of ethanol solution as a function of temperature. The rates of extraction have been determined experimentally for ground corn of various particle sizes. The extraction is much more efficient for fine particles of ground corn at any fixed temperature and ethanol concentration. The diffusion rate of ethanol into and/or oil out of the corn particles is a limiting step in oil extraction from coarse ground corn. The limitations imposed by the low rate of ethanol diffusion can be overcome by pre-wetting the ground corn in ethanol before oil extraction. The characteristic properties of oil extracted from ground corn wetted for 18 h at 68 °C are similar to those from unsoaked finely ground corn. A mass transfer model has been developed to represent the experimental data. Various options for treatment of the diffusion coefficients in the model are examined.","inCitations":["d0ff43e57e06e1d815dd3a78abb713c45a1b0f71","81ef88acff69fb476b62e380201c30f2eb14f6c6","d3163add022306732c45ae1f5fee5b6a7fdb5ed9","deb80c82a5a9fe71a2e1277985958bfed55c26d7","1fb46f79192167b1fc88185e12c279a11fc0f4e5","bcfcc7c06bb2b3608708c0c2a40dcd6fc27bb7e2","559f0ba25dfc22947cabcfd281401b237cd1aeb6","cf6111fbeb4ecbd0a32a94181aaeec67595d4bb2","83f0f201be4e4298b3e795380e0973adbd9adab5","5924aed0bcae8e281dc1dc2be06e3cb1eaf33f79"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Oil extraction of dried ground corn with ethanol","doi":"10.1016/0300-9467(90)80017-7","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/0300-9467%2890%2980017-7","venue":""}

There is a small, but significant, proportion of young people who do not have internet access at home, nor have sufficient digital skills to engage online in ways that are meaningful to them. This paper presents findings from a two-year school and local council-run initiative in England to provide 30 such digitally disadvantaged young people with a laptop and stable internet connection at home as well as school support. Drawing on rich qualitative data (home and school visits; parent, student, and teacher interviews), we explore the experiences of young people, parents, and teachers who were part of this digital inclusion scheme.

Forty-two percent and 52% of the total cellular 5'-nucleotidase and ouabain-sensitive Na+/K+-ATPase activities, respectively, were found in the membrane fraction. The protein yield of plasma membrane was approximately 6% of the total cellular protein. Two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was used to compare [35S] methionine- and [3H] glucosamine-labeled membrane proteins. The incorporation of [35S] methionine and [3H] glucosamine was increased in several proteins when the cultured Sertoli cells were treated with follicle-stimulating hormone, insulin, retinol, and testosterone. Isolated Sertoli cell membranes contained a membrane-associated form of plasminogen activator. Analysis of this plasminogen activator demonstrated that the membrane-associated enzyme existed primarily as a single 38,000-40,000-Mr form.","inCitations":["ceaa40690dd931bdf672adac54933c5e7bf7361e","701852bbed395a2308b095cead4a978a69c0e634","eea6dddda76dcaae369a135c1f39a4f48b5d9a1d","dd901dab4844aae966d1051f77af577c6055b93a","a6ebb6b6c7b84f6fa6e446b27c8057655494fa34","71f99c749a9da81e84820a57d1667a8b785d2a8f","51002d97cb221deccccdb9fd2ec2ed6b60538e4f"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Isolation and characterization of Sertoli cell plasma membranes and associated plasminogen activator activity.","doi":"10.1095/biolreprod32.5.1237","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1095/biolreprod32.5.1237","venue":"Biology of reproduction"}

While gritty individuals are more likely to engage in deliberate practice and maintain commitment in the face of setbacks, what remains unclear are the cognitive processes linking grit and academic performance. Identifying the cognitive processes can play an important role in helping both students and educators apply grit in productive ways. The purpose of this study is to explore the mediational role that psychological capital (PsyCap) may play in the relationship between grit and student academic performance. Drawing from a sample (N = 176) of business students, the results indicate their PsyCap largely mediates the relationship between their grit and grade point averages. In other words, Academic PsyCap consisting of the psychological resources of hope, efficacy, resiliency, and optimism seem to help drive gritty students toward more successful academic performance. A discussion concerning the significance of these findings, as well as implications for management education, are provided.","inCitations":["f99b93980149e006c615489fa8668fac4dffbab6","5f54e49e394fd73644c1e834e15ba9cf8b15504a","6b79abfa9deb8af6972402d08d0459b411a8e17d"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Refining Grit in Academic Performance: The Mediational Role of Psychological Capital","doi":"10.1177/1052562918804282","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1177/1052562918804282","venue":""}

Two stations were compared: the head of the Laurentian Channel (HLC), where intense mixing occurs on the shallow sill that marks the upstream limit of the LSLE, and another station located about 100 km downstream (St. 23), more representative of the LSLE mean mixing conditions. Mean turbulent diffusivities and nitrate fluxes at the base of the surface layer for both stations were, respectively (with 95% confidence intervals): K¯HLC = 8.6(3.2,19) × 10−3 m2 s−1,K¯23 = 4.4(2.3,7.6) × 10−5 m2 s−1,F¯HLC = 95(18,300) mmol m−2 d−1, and F¯23 = 0.21(0.12,0.33) mmol m−2 d−1. Observations suggest that the interplay between large isopleth heaving near the sill and strong turbulence is the key mechanism to sustain such high turbulent nitrate fluxes at the HLC (two to three orders of magnitude higher than those at Station 23). Calculations also suggest that nitrate fluxes at the HLC alone can sustain primary production rates of 3.4(0.6,11) g C m−2  mo−1 over the whole LSLE, approximately enough to account for a large part of the phytoplankton bloom and for most of the postbloom production. Surfacing nitrates are also believed to be consumed within the LSLE, not leaving much to be exported to the rest of the Gulf of St. Lawrence.","inCitations":["4e8d2bb555f0ef2805ba1ca24310ff0348aa528e","548d9937e91856607a3147028b25d5f9a38c958c","0ec696a759dc688febff4fad7f0700f76092be4c","f0e1013961cb8ac84913f97909469e891aabd1e8","0bb02d5208f6a4d5cdc6f73f64b82b66a7d5d225"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.vliz.be/imisdocs/publications/43/271843.pdf"],"title":"Turbulent nitrate fluxes in the Lower St. Lawrence Estuary, Canada","doi":"10.1002/2014jc010272","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1002/2014jc010272","venue":""}
