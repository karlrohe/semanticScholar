Field experiment was conducted on weed control practices and inter-row spacing influences on weed density and grain yield of finger millet at Arsi Negelle during 2011 and 2012 cropping seasons. The objective of the study was to determine the influences of weed control practices, inter-row spacing and their interactions on weed density and grain yield of finger millet. The experiment was laid out in randomized complete block design in factorial arrangement using three replications. The treatment combination was four levels of inter-row spacing (30 cm, 40cm, 50 cm and 60 cm) and four levels of weed control practices (no weeding, one hand weeding (at 20 days after emergence), two hand weeding (at 20 and 40 days after emergence) and post-emergence herbicide (2, 4-D at 0.72 kg ha -1 ) + hand weeding (at 40 days after emergence). Galinsoga parviflora was found to be the most dominant weed species affecting finger millet yield. Significant differences were observed at 5% probability among weed control practices and inter-row spacing on total weed density, weed biomass, grain yield, and plant height, finger per plant and crop biomass. The study indicated that 82% yield reduction was recorded from weedy plot. Twice hand weeding at 20 and 40 days after emergence resulted in the highest grain yield (3.42 t ha -1 ) of finger millet. The highest yield was obtained from 40 cm inter row spacing; while the lowest grain yield was obtained from 60 cm inter-row spacing. There was no significant interaction effect of weed management practices by inter-row spacing. The narrower inter-row spacing resulted in reduced weed density and weed biomass as compared to wider inter row spacing. Therefore, the combination of twice hand weeding at 20 and 40 days after emergence and 40cm inter-row spacing was found to be good to manage weed problem and prevent significant yield loss. Moreover, the application of post-emergence herbicide (2, 4-D at 0.72 kg ha -1 ) + hand weeding at 40 days after emergence with 40 cm inter-row spacing also reduce weed infestation and give good yield.","inCitations":["988dbce834f24a15ca6e4a1b2f01e90e0af2f6d8"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.ijraf.org/papers/v3-i9/1.pdf"],"title":"Weed Control Practices and Inter-Row Spacing Influences on Weed Density and Grain Yield of Finger Millet ( Eleusine Coracana L .

En realite, le jeune Maxime, apres avoir ete reconnu, en 1888, par Francois WEYGAND, est devenu le personnage central d'une oeuvre qui ressuscite des peripeties peu communes et met en scene les hommes exceptionnels qui en furent les protagonistes ou les heros. Decrivant les etapes primordiales de la longue existence de cet homme rigide et entier, \" ombrageux et violent \" qu'est le General d'armee WEYGAND, Guy RAISSAC evoque sous un eclairage nouveau certains aspects dramatiques ou parfois saugrenus des evenements souvent confus, contradictoires et âprement controverses qui se sont deroules de 1940 a nos jours. L'auteur, apres de minutieuses recherches et maintes verifications, relie entre eux, pour la premiere fois, des faits peu comprehensibles jusqu'alors. Il compose un portrait vivant de ceux qui, sur des plans differents et a des degres divers, eurent un role a remplir au cours de ces annees cruciales. Cette vaste fresque litteraire et historique entraine le lecteur de la France occupee a la capitale britannique, de l'Afrique au Moyen-Orient et a l'Allemagne en guerre. Elle depeint au passage les coulisses de l'Assemblee Nationale a Vichy, relate les deliberations secretes de l'hotel du Parc ou du Palais d'Hiver a Alger, evoque meme les reactions de l'Academie francaise lors des temps difficiles. Elle retrace la mise en route laborieuse de la Haute Cour de Justice, de la Liberation, et eclaire certains incidents curieux ou significatifs survenus au cours du proces Petain. L'expose detaille du long conflit qui a oppose WEYGAND a DE GAULLE permet a l'auteur de reveler quelques donnees particulieres de l'antagonisme aussi penible que fondamental qui a, peu a peu, mais inexorablement, dresse PETAIN et DE GAULLE face a face. Il decrit a cette occasion, et pour la pre- miere fois, les phases les plus caracteristiques du contentieux judiciaire dont, au cours de l'ete 1940, Charles DE GAULLE fut la victime, a titre d'ailleurs, symbolique et analyse les mesures de revision qui en furent la consequence L'affrontement durable et souvent passionne qui a successivement mis aux prises le General WEYGAND avec Pierre LAVAL et avec l'Amiral DARLAN est relate, tout au long, avec une complete impartialite. Telle est la substance d'un ouvrage qui comporte maintes revelation inedites et nombre de mises au point historiquement necessaires.

Rhizopus spp. are the most common pathogens isolated from patients with mucormycosis. Previously, we identified R. oryzae CotH3 as a surface protein which mediates fungal invasion of host cells during mucormycosis. We found rabbit polyclonal anti-CotH3 antibodies to significantly block host cell invasion by R. oryzae and protect mice from R. oryzae infection. However, it is unclear if CotH3 antibodies enhance phagocyte killing of the fungus. Here, we used flow cytometry and mouse neutrophil killing assays to determine the binding and opsonophagocytic killing capacities of varying concentrations of anti-CotH3 antibodies against R. oryzae, respectively. Anti-CotH3 antibodies showed high-affinity binding (>99%) to R. oryzae even when low concentration of the antibodies were used (e.g. 3mcg dose). CotH3 antibodies also widely bound to other Mucorales known to cause mucormycosis including Mucor circinelloides, Lichtheimia, Rhizomucor, and Cunninghamella.

Six male cats aged 2-12 years with normal semen quality, copulation capability, and fertility were used. In AIVI, animals received administration of 250 iu hCG once or 100 iu twice on days 2-4 of estrus to induce ovulation, and were inseminated 15, 20, or 30 hr after the initial hCG administration. The success of ovulation was judged by elevation of the peripheral progesterone level after hCG administration. AIVI was investigated at three sperm counts, 20 x 10(6) (Experiment 1), 40 x 10(6) (Experiment 2), and 80 x 10(6) (Experiment 3), with semen collected by the artificial vagina method. Semen was infused in the vagina under general anesthesia by advancing a 9 cm-long nylon probe with 1.5 mm diameter connected to a 1 ml syringe in the vagina for 3-4 cm. Ovulation was induced in 43 of 45 animals (95.6%). One of 16 animals was fertilized (conception rate: 6.6%) by AIVI in Experiment 1. In Experiments 2 and 3, conception was obtained in six of 18 animals (33.3%) and seven of nine animals (77.8%), respectively, and the mean numbers of kits were 4.0 +/- 0.4 and 3.3 +/- 0.5, respectively, and the mean numbers of kits were 4.0 +/- 0.4 (SE) and 3.3 +/- 0.5, respectively, showing no significant difference. There were no differences in the time of insemination after hCG administration and the conception rate among these groups. Our findings showed that the number of sperm required for fertilization by AIVI of fresh semen in cats was 80 x 10(6).","inCitations":["2d3438a9fe9c5542c8eec137fea1f1822a4077f6","b0a47045662f6ec8a04df0875add51a42e35aee3","406988691e2bf430edf2a49d70d0aad79f30b8e9","d38495e7d249c833e5b3b6b6d3062e4aef041f3c","8910f4fa6442864673e1de9ca85cc82c96436a40","3ceec1a0b62042ead96b3d315f5ae43569ae5bcc","552d50b2bafa9e7e2993da2a493f571097aa25d9","80ea0c48fe1b52f199cafe0c5d5fb428ec0e39f5","fb166eb1063fa9c22bbedc693b855ac78ca7f6af","fb41c5776d09c4732a3e7ee50bb334836e48f391","a864392b65102a4e8764a29f63c3ad7fcc7985fd","43fa3738b3952b8dfd17e5ed542dbc1ec97d595a","b8be2a69cbc90901c9c70d0123d66573d51395ab","d8d5675679941be9eddbcb9ade9c25e03018c726","fc4ca6ec30cfaa694d83fbe89788088bdd15ac46","3fdfbc18e0b5316cd4565a7abae7983dd2b20443","2fba00b6bd06668a117e1b8927fe81badaaa51ec","80a680c353a4b323fa13272b7004d19fd3a9b4f6","78e83fc496bafac0abcdd8ca5aa10becf8cf18b9","bac05446450fd585e306d691d60e6f7f717993bb","22343415efd620159697a9f22c696e6f66cf28ff","c810e363c34dce8041fe7496f47c07aa56c4404e","e7522c6775e22195c2217239cfbd249c6e38f3f0","8f85f40bc03af40ef5d450c762e7ca46af2aa74b","d77eab0810ee567e7fe56b2f747d92c496345f67"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Artificial intravaginal insemination using fresh semen in cats.","doi":"10.1292/jvms.62.1163","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1292/jvms.62.1163","venue":"The Journal of veterinary medical science"}

This approximation is based on the classical Taylor’s series expansion combined to the open–circuit voltage obtained when all the constant power load points are disconnected. This solution strategy avoids the usage of an iterative process to solve the load flow problem in DC power grids reducing its processing time. Notwithstanding its simplicity, the proposed method is very accurate when is compared to classical Gauss–Seidel or Newton–Raphson methods concerning the solution quality.

However, although efforts to address the situation through a rigorous water sector reform have shown some improvements, challenges still persist. One key challenge is inadequate capacity of sector institutions to deliver on their mandates. In particular, high Non-Revenue Water (NRW) levels (averaging 45%) negatively affect financial viability of water utilities. Key stakeholders are currently collaborating to improve NRW levels. Through capacity development support, underlying issues have been addressed and service delivery improved. The case of Nakuru Water, Sewerage and Sanitation Company (NAWASSCO), where local and international partners are implementing an innovative NRW model has resulted in commendable gains, is described. The NRW pilot adopted an action research approach to implement the International Water Association methodology of reducing NRW to the local situation through a pilot (NAKA). Emerging best practices will be up-scaled to other areas within and beyond Nakuru. Geographic information system (GIS) and management information system (MIS) tools were developed to facilitate decision-making.

Beyond stenosis, coronary CTA also permits assessment of atherosclerotic plaque (including total and noncalcified plaque burden) and coronary artery remodeling, previously only measurable through invasive techniques. It has been shown that coronary plaque volume for noncalcified and mixed plaques and the arterial remodeling index correlate closely with corresponding measures from invasive intravascular ultrasound. Several studies have also shown a strong relationship between adverse plaque features imaged by coronary CTA and acute coronary syndrome, major adverse cardiovascular events, and ischemia. The aim of this review is to summarize current methods for quantitative measurement of atherosclerotic plaque features from coronary CTA and to discuss the clinical implications of noncalcified plaque as detected by CTA and reported in the current literature.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Noncalcified Plaque in Cardiac CT: Quantification and Clinical Implications","doi":"10.1007/s12410-015-9343-z","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s12410-015-9343-z","venue":"Current Cardiovascular Imaging Reports"}

Objectives The present study aimed to investigate the association between microRNA (miR)-19a, miR-21 and the JAK/STAT signaling pathway. Methods A total of 20 patients with SJIA were included in the study, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 20 normal controls were also collected.RNAiso was used to extract total RNA, and the RNA was then reverse transcribed into cDNA. Primers were designedto detect the mRNA of miR-19a and miR-21, and U6 was set as the internal parameter. In addition, the mRNA of STAT3, suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-&agr; (TNF-&agr;) was detected, and &bgr;-actin was set as the internal parameter. Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction was performed to detect the expression levels of these proteins in patients with SJIA and control subjects, and non-parametric tests were used to analyze the statistical differences in 2-&Dgr;&Dgr;Cq between the two groups. Results The expression levels of miR-19a and miR-21 were significantly lower in the SJIA group compared with the control group (P<0.05). SOCS3, TNF-&agr; and STAT3 were shown to be the target genes of miR-19a and miR-21, as determined by Targetscan. The expression levels of STAT3, SOCS3,TNF-&agr; and IL-6 mRNA were significantly higher compared with those of the control group (P<0.05). Conclusions In the PBMCs of the patients with SJIA, miR-19a and miR-21 expression levels were lower compared with those of the control group, and the JAK/STAT signaling pathway was activated, which indicated that miR-19a and miR-21 may participate in the activation ofthe JAK/STAT signaling pathway.

The sample size topic is today a central issue for the assessment of critical-systems, such as medical devices, because lacks in usability and, moreover, in the safety in use of these kind of products may seriously damage the final users.

Nevertheless, albeit there are no magic numbers for determining \"a priori\" the cohort size, by using a specific procedure it is possible to monitoring the sample discovery likelihood after the first five users in order to obtain reliable information about the gathered data and determine whether the problems discovered by the sample have a certain level of representativeness (i.e., reliability).

In 16:19, a certain group of חכמים is mentioned. Although this mention is made at first glance more or less en passant, and, compared to Deut 4:5-8, seems to be theologically far from crucial, it can provide some insight into the relationship between Deuteronomy and \"wisdom\", since it contains a critical view of \"the wise\", which is related to a (Deuteronomistic) concept of obedience to the Mosaic Torah.

The factor has now been identified as the Bacillus subtilis Hbsu protein. Hbsu is a nonspecific DNA-binding and DNA-bending protein. The beta recombinase, in the presence of highly purified Hbsu protein, is able to catalyze in vitro intramolecular recombination between two specific recombination sites on a supercoiled DNA molecule. DNA resolution was obtained when the two crossing over sites (six sites) were directly oriented, whereas DNA inversion was the product when the six sites were in inverse orientation. The ability of the Escherichia coli chromatin-associated proteins HU, IHF, Fis, and H-NS to substitute for Hbsu was investigated. HU efficiently stimulated beta-mediated recombination, while the effect of IHF was partial and that of Fis and H-NS was undetectable. In addition, the beta protein was able to mediate DNA recombination in both wild-type and IHF-deficient E. coli cells, but failed to do so in an HU-deficient strain. The data presented provide direct evidence that a chromatin-associated protein is strictly required for beta-mediated recombination.","inCitations":["879615b505143c65d2f4fb2df4acd7b29d613a9f","952d6280c667e9f3930dcec41187ae880c7b18d1","ed6dd9f372840468a794d10c4ac6ffef48c1016f","5cd871716fdd33507acf1ef3212438ed3b541517","665d06d63d063a0f4670e5feb5e5d63ada3ff1cf","47604fdb975e131470350b4ac00e26e7615fba56","aa9acd4e452e34621a26b1325de78fd88704b468","4fb3af6102a3646fba25c7d1eefc9ff576c32100","0a0cb9861f17f64ae99828249e0ae060d9144ea8","3c9c3685a1d09722f64075c0cc4aaa0202d83a4c","821c7043f15f4e4444d5a74b8b138338b441adf5","36d39c524d5514bd0b3b62aa1d1b48d5bb83744d","4999f46049b8491966d10e6746e796942ac2e369","9cdd91e94c307a531fd2d72b596bb47b4b28f145","b900fabf70dfed6bf0e274cb79cfca41a5591873","de5ebf1211c1521ccc18815ebe2e8acd05372d04","380755ecf29bc278e1bc9ad5d8b3048092730dbe","d18e6db5d5cda51b8210b91fd46dd92ec2a7b02a"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"The Bacillus subtilis histone-like protein Hbsu is required for DNA resolution and DNA inversion mediated by the beta recombinase of plasmid pSM19035.","doi":"10.1074/jbc.270.7.2938","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.270.7.2938","venue":"The Journal of biological chemistry"}

As expected, the older it gets the more information it contains and thus the number of the web sites with gigantic growth and bad information access rates is constantly increased within it. During the last years the matter is being addressed with the development of several hotlink assignment algorithms for web sites. The main idea behind those algorithms is to spot the most popular or more likely to be accessed piece of information and provide better access to it by assigning links (hotlinks) to the web pages containing it. These algorithms are not applied to the actual representations of these web sites but usually to their corresponding direct acyclic graphs (DAGs). However, it is widely known that a web site in its true form is not a DAG, since there can be found hundreds of links pointing to just one page. Hence, there is a gap between the theoretical determination of a set of hotlinks and the possible application of this set to a real web site. In this paper we first address the issue of recording and persisting the exact map of a web site with its full connectivity, which can be considered as a first step towards the assignment of hotlinks in real web sites. We succeed in that, with the appropriate specification and implementation of a web crawler, with functionality suited to our specific needs. We then propose an administrative tool, the ‘Hotlink Visualizer’, which, after persisting in tabular data all the necessary information to capture a web site’s real map, visualizes the outcome and implements hotlink additions by adding with an automated procedure the generated hotlinks in the web pages of the site. Thus we have the ability to maintain in row data different forms and versions of the originally parsed web site, as it can be formed from the assignment of different hotlink sets to it.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Σύστημα Υλοποίησης Και Γραφικής Αναπαράστασης Αλγορίθμων Ανάθεσης Υπερσυνδέσμων Στον Παγκόσμιο Ιστό","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

The stability constants of NiII complexes of ligands L1 and L2 have been studied at 25 °C using pH titrations. The kinetics of general acid (HCl, 0.04–2.34 mol dm−3) or buffer (DEPP or DESPEN, 0.05 mol dm−3, pH 4.83–5.72)-catalyzed dissociation of these NiII complexes have been investigated at 25 °C using a stopped-flow spectrophotometer. The ionic strength of solution was controlled at I = 2.34 mol dm−3 (KCl + HCl) and I = 0.1 mol dm−3 (KNO3, buffer), respectively. The kinetic dissociation of NiII complexes catalyzed by HCl obeys the equilibrium kobs = k1d + k2H[H+], whereas in buffer solution the observed rate constant kobs = kd + k1H[H+]. At pH < 1.5, both the proton-assisted and direct protonation pathways contribute to the rates, whereas solvation is the dominant pathway at pH > 6. In the 4.8–5.7 pH range, the complexes dissociate mainly through a proton-assisted pathway.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Synthesis, thermodynamic properties and kinetics of the acid-catalyzed dissociation of nickel(II) diamido polyamino complexes","doi":"10.1023/A:1025409918259","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1023/A%3A1025409918259","venue":""}

This knowledge enables more effective use of the local agro-climatic resources and crop placement in the agro-landscapes. The research goal is to study the influence of various slope exposures on the distribution of root rot, weed infestation and spring soft wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) yielding capacity. The studies were conducted in 2010 and 2011 on the fields of the UNTs FGBOU SPO “Aksyonovskiy selskokhozyaystvenniy tekhnikum (Aksyonovskiy Agricultural College) and on the fields of the adjacent farms of the Alsheyevskiy and Belebeyevskiy Districts (Republic of Bashkortostan) located on the southern side of the Bugulmino-Belebeyevskaya Upland. The slopes of southern, northern and eastern exposures were studied. The leveled areas were the control. It was found that the affection of spring soft wheat by root rot on slope lands occurred 1.3-1.7 times more often. The largest number of affected plants was found on the northern slope, and the plants at the bottom part of the slope were affected by 11.8-21.7% more often than the plants at the top or at the middle part. The number of weeds on the slope plots varied from 122 to 200 weeds per 1 sq. m.; their weight reached 341-564 g per sq. m. These figures were 1.4-1.8 and 1.3-2.2 times more respectively than those on the leveled plot. The largest number of weeds was found in the crops at the bottom slope part. In may be concluded that in the Bugulmino-Belebeyevskaya Upland spring soft wheat should be sown at the middle part of slopes; that ensures obtaining the yields of 2.29-2.66 t ha with crude gluten content of 26.9-28.6%. Whenever it is possible the crops should be placed on the slopes of the southern exposure. The average crop yield there is by 11.7-16.1% greater than that one on the slopes of eastern, northern and western exposures.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Влияние Рельефа Поля На Фитосанитарное Состояние И Урожайность Посевов Яровой Пшеницы","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

This work reports on the medium to long-term stability of non-modified gold sensitive layers, and the sensitivity improvements for a modified film for mercury (Hg) vapour sensing. For sensing purposes, it is important to obtain a high sensitivity when using Quartz Crystal Microbalances (QCMs) in the presence of common interferent gas species found in alumina production processes. Increasing the active surface area of the QCM electrode by electro-deposition is thought to reduce the required exposure time of the sensor towards mercury vapour, thus increasing the ability and rate of the QCMs’ regeneration. The long-term stability of the tested sensors is shown to be within 5% for dry and humid conditions over any sequential 2 to 4 day period towards Hg concentrations of 1.87 and 5.7mg/m 3 . The results indicated that a response magnitude degradation of ~40% occurred over the 45 day test period. The effect on response magnitude of the sensors was investigated in the presence of ammonia (1180 – 1770 mg/m 3 ) and humidity (4.2 – 10.4 mg/m 3 ) interferents. Interference caused by 1770 mg/m 3 of ammonia degraded the response of the non-modified QCMs, leading to the sensors reporting a 10 to 20% lower concentration for the tested Hg concentrations.

Ten chronic right hemispheric stroke patients (4 men; mean age: 62.6 years) with USN were recruited. All participants underwent three randomly arranged tDCS sessions: (1) dual-mode, anodal tDCS over the right posterior parietal cortex (PPC) and cathodal tDCS over the left PPC; (2) single-mode, anodal tDCS over the right PPC; and (3) sham mode. Each session lasted 20min. Before and immediately after the stimulation, a line bisection test and star cancelation test were carried out. In the line bisection test, significant improvements were observed after both the dual- and the single-mode tDCS (p<0.05), but not after sham stimulation. Statistical analysis showed a significant interaction between time and tDCS mode, where the dual tDCS had a stronger effect than the single or sham stimulation modes (p<0.05). The star cancelation test did not show any significant change. These results suggest that dual tDCS over the bilateral PPC is an effective method for the treatment of USN in stroke patients.","inCitations":["aef7a71c03995b31d2112eced25934917437b32a","167733d8949f3268b7a071ca82935810655cdf34","dc86e5b9c3cd6e71f64027931248ffca62b6a9c1","ffea59bdc4d9b902942e12c5202257e4eb9e88f6","551ffe8eb03ff6d2748c617047f0cd2e66d12f60","c34866f907df4a2d4cbb42de999df5c51573d82c","8647094876b938000143251551498cbe6ceaeb4f","56e30dbb365841ff431ae7627feca687e035d677","bcb051025fa24a6a852529071b716b66e2c36c4a","bf383417e97cac22551dd403f146c8395a8bf95a","9d57218d505e004a3fb0736642f9a1b8217de816","4226cea21663b0236c9ec014956da8b3ac7da21b","02dccefb798f68bb11438362f60ca1c9aa892a31","b0d052e8871c15bc36d359fce5a12ecb7ad8173f","8d62f3fe459bca168ae827b4cf441880b61d0e39","60b5e6e7c2af1ccda57fad4cc47422902f8839b4","cb3c1038a2206ccbc57c90bbecac849df4f4c1ce","407c812d2743aa10fa57a24e3de8e82634b3db7d","baaf2eec381a0579f172594f15b82d7de3a25b32","a005e6a2d81aa2ae521b16f540fb22f81597eedb","f6b1719393770f43ecde0521bd6bac7dc22b3981","6eb7dd8167d0ce814c92f1d6bcf0ee6117f4ecc5","279ba59625b6b40e8e094969c14ce476405eb849","350ccc1753bb79772701f5dece6f7b129b10ebe6","33e724c6dc1509c81ef6dae7a35858f72574e90b","461121ec13918319971c69cdd5152b442b704b42","61480ab77f337effc3e64c019e2c62c8b7921e0a","69bdadbc4563d90600638d378b213da33d3787ff"],"pdfUrls":["https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0304394013007970","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304394013007970?dgcid=api_sd_search-api-endpoint"],"title":"Effects of dual transcranial direct current stimulation on post-stroke unilateral visuospatial neglect","doi":"10.1016/j.neulet.2013.08.064","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neulet.2013.08.064","venue":"Neuroscience Letters"}

The sub-grade soil is an integral part of these structures as it provides the support to the pavement. The sub-grade soil and its properties are important in the design of pavement structure. Most State I highways particularly in Maharashtra, M.P. and Andhra Pradesh have problems of foundation due to the presence of highly compressible clayey soil (mostly black cotton soil). The present study indicates that the settlement and shear strength behaviour of black cotton soil is changed appreciably if reinforced with layers of woven/non-woven jute geotextile (JGT), non-woven geotextile and coarse sand drain placed at center in horizontal layer and in the form of vertical drain. Results show that compression index values decrease by about 8 per cent. 16.5 per cent and 25 per cent with non-woven JGT, woven JGT and non-woven geotextile respectively when compared with virgin black cotton soil. Further, it is seen that by addition of 10 mm dia vertical coarse sand drain in the center of 76.2 mm dia consolidation test, compression index values decrease by about 35.6 per cent, 36.5 per cent and 37.65 per cent with non-woven JGT, woven JGT and non-woven geotextile respectively in comparison with virgin black cotton soil. It is also observed that shear strength increases by about 13 per cent, 9 per cent, and 1.5 per cent with non-woven geotextile, woven JGT and vertical coarse sand drain respectively when compared with virgin black cotton soil (A)","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Behaviour of black cotton soil with bio-degradable reinforcement","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

However, the function of δ-catenin in lung carcinoma remains largely unknown. In the present study, we revealed that δ-catenin acts as an oncogene promoting the malignancy of lung adenocarcinoma. When δ-catenin proteins of Lewis lung cells were depleted by knocking out Ctnnd2 via CRISPR/Cas9 technology, the cells lost the tumorigenic and metastatic abilities in vivo. Consistently, overexpression of Ctnnd2 enhances the subcutaneous tumorigenesis and distant metastasis of Lewis lung cells in vivo. However, δ-catenin promotes cell proliferation and cell cycle progression of Lewis lung cells. Mechanistically, δ-catenin enhances G1-S phase transition in cooperation with canonical Wnt signaling in Lewis lung cells. Moreover, δ-catenin promotes oncosphere formation of lung adenocarcinoma cells and is associated with the expression of cancer stem cell markers, which indicates δ-catenin enhances colonization and invasion via cancer stem cell maintenance. Taken together, our data suggest that δ-catenin may serve an important role in the malignancy of lung adenocarcinoma through activating canonical Wnt signaling and cancer stem cell maintenance. Our research indicates that δ-catenin can be a new potential target for the treatment of lung adenocarcinoma.","inCitations":["71fafcbfcff02e0afe89ed3a14446a14018f181c","e1aaf39b39684267cae75adeb4318923c75007b1","45ae6a92cc6ce1e398272d4d9272c1c1ca83c637","ef25292294e8da4b5c793e0276ecc5992346774c"],"pdfUrls":["https://www.spandidos-publications.com/or/39/2/809/download"],"title":"δ-Catenin promotes tumorigenesis and metastasis of lung adenocarcinoma.","doi":"10.3892/or.2017.6140","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.3892/or.2017.6140","venue":"Oncology reports"}

This outcome can be interpreted as a combination of the convergence of inflation rates and the convergence of investment barriers. On the one hand, the common monetary policy might have driven a stronger comovement in inflation rates, leading to increasingly similar hedging strategies among member countries. On the other hand, exposure to the common currency might have homogenized bilateral investment barriers, thus inducing increasingly similar portfolio allocations among member countries. We find that the comovement of inflation rates has not significantly increased after EMU inception, pointing toward an exclusive role for convergence in investment barriers.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/13927/1/MPRA_paper_13927.pdf","http://www.fiw.ac.at/fileadmin/Documents/Publikationen/Working_Paper/N_028-giofre.pdf","https://www.fiw.ac.at/fileadmin/Documents/FOKO_II/giofreNeu.pdf"],"title":"Convergence of EMU Equity Portfolios","doi":"10.2139/ssrn.1404595","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.1404595","venue":""}

The new 100 mm2 SDD has been evaluated in an EXAFS experiment at the National Synchrotron Light Source at Brookhaven National Laboratory, which investigated the local atomic structure surrounding Mn in a LaMnO3/SrMnO3 superlattice. Results show that the new large area SDD delivers excellent energy resolution, high peak-to-background and significantly reduces the data collection time for these types of sensitive EXAFS measurements.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"A very large area (100 mm2) silicon drift detector for EXAFS applications","doi":"10.1109/NSSMIC.2011.6154113","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NSSMIC.2011.6154113","venue":"2011 IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium Conference Record"}

One of these strategies is the Community Health Fund (CHF), a voluntary health insurance scheme for the informal rural sector. As its implementation has been challenging, we investigated different CHF implementation practices and how these practices and the wider health financing context affect CHF implementation and potentially enrolment. Two councils were purposively selected for this study. Routine data relevant for understanding CHF implementation in the wider health financing context were collected at council and public health facility level. Additionally, an economic costing approach was used to estimate CHF administration cost and analyse its financing sources. Our results showed the importance of considering different CHF implementation practices and the wider health financing context when looking at CHF performance. Exemption policies and healthcare-seeking behaviour influenced negatively the maximum potential enrolment rate of the voluntary CHF scheme. Higher revenues from user fees, user fee policies and fund pooling mechanisms might have furthermore set incentives for care providers to prioritize user fees over CHF revenues. Costing results clearly pointed out the lack of financial sustainability of the CHF. The financial analysis however also showed that thanks to significant contributions from other health financing mechanisms to CHF administration, the CHF could be left with more than 70% of its revenues for financing services. To make the CHF work, major improvements in CHF implementation practices would be needed, but given the wider health financing context and healthcare-seeking behaviours, it is questionable whether such improvements are feasible, scalable and value for money. Thus, our results call for a reconsideration of approaches taken to address the challenges in health financing and demonstrate that the CHF cannot be looked at as a stand-alone system.","inCitations":["516c4c5f69babd3de1a61f6027896dca7a295f99"],"pdfUrls":["https://www.novartisfoundation.org/sites/www.novartisfoundation.org/files/2018%20-%20HPP%20-%20How%20health%20financing%20affects%20implementation%20of%20Tanzanian%20Community%20Health%20Funds.pdf"],"title":"Looking at the bigger picture: how the wider health financing context affects the implementation of the Tanzanian Community Health Funds","doi":"10.1093/heapol/czy091","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1093/heapol%2Fczy091","venue":"Health policy and planning"}

The two major types of atmospheric modification produced by rocket exhaust are: (1) the formation of large scale ionospheric holes, and (2) the enhancement of the airglow emissions. The ionospheric holes are regions tens of kilometers in diameter where the plasma concentration can be reduced by a factor of ten or more. Plasma instabilities may produce irregularities at the edges of the holes. Communication and navigation systems relying on radio propagation through the modified ionosphere may be affected. Airglow enhancements are a result of excited neutral species being produced by chemical reactions between the rocket exhaust and the ionospheric plasma. For example, the 630 nm line from atomic oxygen may increase twenty-fold in intensity over the ambient level. This paper reviews experimental observations and theoretical treatments of ionospheric modification produced by gas releases in the upper atmosphere. Recent experimental measurements of the ionospheric modification by an ATLAS-F launch vehicle are presented. The plans for future experiments are discussed.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Modification of the upper atmosphere with chemicals found in rocket exhaust","doi":"10.2514/6.1982-145","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.2514/6.1982-145","venue":""}

This model takes into account the fact that the reliability description of the system components is unreliable itself and has some degree of belief to it. It is assumed that there is no information about probability distributions on both first and second levels of the proposed second-order uncertainty model, the available information about the reliability of the system components is heterogeneous, and there is no information about independence of the system components. Algorithms for computing beliefs to the system reliability measures and for reducing the second-order model to the first-order one are proposed. These algorithms are based on the solution of a set of linear programming problems. Numerical examples illustrate the model.","inCitations":["61093664db6b9602f32639ed800c9dcd3728f0ac","99cd95b6030dc2a87260bebabaf29d40e49e6b2f","5c8c14915b0cb202809aa3232a98841bb3c33611","c2bbec5406fd29316a63e166bf04076bf36f06d7","0f9104599e56735f82a8dc4cb9e9dab144952975","ed0567588da98a64494e8d568b71f4c2407dcd90","9983a3383fb4583e7e2a41393aed2822da3bc0eb","cab06aeed16ed36484e2ef1da1efb92d853246a1","9bb0e5f9a7040ad61d1e3c8aca38722760c6f020"],"pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1016/S0951-8320(02)00242-9"],"title":"A second-order uncertainty model for calculation of the interval system reliability","doi":"10.1016/S0951-8320(02)00242-9","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/S0951-8320%2802%2900242-9","venue":"Reliab.

Graft copolymer and homopoly(EVE) were formed in all cases. The presence of water reduced overall polymerization rates, percentage grafting, and homopoly(EVE) molecular weights. With “superdry” EVE, grafting reached 29% at a total dose of 6.9 Mrad. Grafting to PVC films was less efficient than grafting to PVC powder. Application of a relatively poor swelling agent for PVC resulted in an increase in the efficiency of grafting. From a comparison of studies of radiation-induced EVE homopolymerization and the present work, it was concluded that dry and superdry EVE are grafted to PVC by a cationic mechanism and wet EVE is grafted mainly by a free-radical mechanism.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Radiation-Induced Grafting of Ethyl Vinyl Ether onto Polyvinyl Chloride)","doi":"10.1080/00222337808066582","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1080/00222337808066582","venue":""}
