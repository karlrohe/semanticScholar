The mechanically alloyed phase in the as-milled state is determined to be nonequilibrium, or metastable. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) studies show a highly defective microstructure with undefined grain areas, and the alloy can be described as a mechanical mixture of elemental Fe and Zn, based on neutron diffraction measurements. Characteristic stages associated with its transformation to the equilibrium state are identified based on differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements. The activation energies corresponding to these stages are 128, 202, and 737 kJ/mole, respectively, with increasing transformation temperatures. The first stage is related to limited atomic diffusion or rearrangements, such as recovery, during thermal treatment, while the second stage depicts continued recrystallization and long-range atomic diffusion leading to a stable phase formation. The third and final stage marks structural decomposition of the equilibrium structure due to phase transition. Neutron diffraction of the equilibrium alloy confirmed that the structure is C2/m, with lattice parameters of a=13.40995 Å, b=7.60586 Å, c=5.07629 Å, and β=127 deg 18 minutes.

Our sample included 67 nesting cliffs that were occupied at least once between 1972 and 1999 and 38 cliffs with no known history of Peregrine Falcon occupancy. We measured 29 eyrie, cliff, and topographical features at each occupied nesting cliff and unused cliff in 1998–1999 and used them to model the probability of peregrines occupying a cliff for a breeding attempt. Nearest-neighbor distance was significantly greater than both nearest-cliff distance and nearest-occupied distance (the distance between an occupied cliff and one occupied at least once, 1972–1999). Thus, spacing among occupied cliffs was probably the most important factor limiting nesting-cliff availability, and, ultimately, peregrine nesting densities. Although some unused cliffs were unavailable in a given year because of peregrine spacing behavior, physical characteristics apparently made some cliffs unsuitable, regardless of availability. We confirmed the importance of several features common to descriptions of peregrine nesting habitat and found that peregrines occupied tall nesting cliffs with open views. They chose nesting cliffs with eyrie ledges that provided a moderate degree of overhang protection and that were inaccessible to ground predators. Overall, we concluded that certain features of a cliff were important in determining its suitability as a nest site, but within a given breeding season there also must be sufficient spacing between neighboring falcon pairs. Our habitat model and information on spacing requirements may be applicable to other areas of Greenland and the Arctic, and can be used to test the generalities about features of Peregrine Falcon nesting cliffs throughout the species' widespread distribution.","inCitations":["76e96ac33c61c0a0abfcf69925e2f5f6412f9318","6a140ab27e6e10379653386fc51a5d892f752bed","1a7ffc5973cc98ea0ebed4aa2ce0613b5d49bf09","98ea5dfe2b8674d6784d03d0c5872bffc598f1ee","b65ff2424448d04ab8f40e9b7e11ba2a99024e34","dcdafaf644b33c9a299147f1345168856b072d87","9cdcb768f0e8826e0e9de4b47a6b4144a7c9e2eb","8d5e6ee22717c1b51f5c17a207f79edaae53ed02","3d966605d5e240cfe8bf5960f7df7afe437d1d1e","b8d64c7b7b3bddbc153ab264a15ce09bff3d8275","50f362f605f3a6d7717ad2da3da157fd5ff040ed","f6d85e683a733875d9cc7a91a0841c8a6badba36"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Spacing and Physical Habitat Selection Patterns of Peregrine Falcons in Central West Greenland","doi":"10.1676/04-036.1","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1676/04-036.1","venue":""}

This phenomenon is facilitated by the sequestering of p50/p65 NFκB dimers in the cytosol via IκBα's masking of the p65 NLS. Interestingly, IκBα is one of the genes upregulated by NFκB binding to its promoter upon translocation into the nucleus; IκBα then facilitates dissocation of NFκB from DNA thereby creating a negative feedback loop to turn off the NFκB response. NFκB dimers consist of two domains, a dimerization domain and an N-terminal domain (NTD) which are responsible for dimerization/IκBα binding and DNA binding respectively. Since there are no native contacts between IκBα and the NTDs and further, constructs lacking the NTDs bind IκBα with comparable KD values, it has long been believed that the NTDs are not implicated in IκBα binding. I performed hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry to analyze changes in amide exchange in NFκB when IκBα binds. The results show dramatic stabilization of the dimerization of NFκBs upon IκBα binding. In addition, surprisingly, we observe significant stabilization in the NTDs as well. This stabilization could potentially indicate a conformational change that would explain how IκBα binding may facilitate dissociation of NFκB from DNA.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Global Stabilization of NFκB Upon IκBα Binding","doi":"10.1016/j.bpj.2015.11.1224","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bpj.2015.11.1224","venue":""}

The QM/MM-MFEP method describes the thermodynamics of a system on the potential of mean force surface of the solute degrees of freedom. The molecular dynamics (MD) sampling is only carried out with the QM subsystem fixed. It thus avoids \"on-the-fly\" QM calculations and thus overcomes the high computational cost in the direct QM/MM MD sampling. In the applications to two metal complexes in aqueous solution, the new QM/MM-MFEP method yielded redox free energies in good agreement with those calculated from the direct QM/MM MD method. Two larger biologically important redox molecules, lumichrome and riboflavin, were further investigated to demonstrate the efficiency of the method. The enhanced efficiency and uncompromised accuracy are especially significant for biochemical systems. The QM/MM-MFEP method thus provides an efficient approach to free energy simulation of complex electron transfer reactions.","inCitations":["10eb36f6cbf6ad5953b2480491b908bad232e072","40f22d6eba495bb582da5aacf5ea69d1790b94be","69e8fee26fcaccb1f417f322dd0269f9c399b60f","4b934cc1d9936322f052d490671c21e8325331a0","2918626374eeaa9b8b70d12ba1321c1a4f965e37","978515a25f961e3a9a3055c156c3daa92d702abb","ac6b9f98d4362194915fdb78b10b509e8fcfcd2c","ff64b8c1e355a4ab21795aa1f16b4deb2df6bb2d","045f00254a36388790db23cfe1db1e322ed714a6","e8cff504d3c87547510e6a58262f2cf2f858015a","b9f74df873760a524d2835fc002eff9e8a3a8709"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Calculating solution redox free energies with ab initio quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical minimum free energy path method.","doi":"10.1063/1.3120605","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1063/1.3120605","venue":"The Journal of chemical physics"}

It is a predominant component of the hepatic microsomal membrane and reacts rapidly with diisopropylphosphorofluoridate (DFP), resulting in the loss of enzymatic activity toward artificial substrates such as acyl esters of o-nitrophenols. Automated Edman degradation of this protein together with sequence analysis of peptides provided the NH2-terminal sequence of some 70 residues as follows: His-Pro-Ser- Ala-Pro-Pro-Val-Val-Asp-Thr-Val-Lys-Gly-Lys-Val- Leu-Gly-Lys-Phe-Val-Ser-Leu-Glu-Gly-Phe-Ala-Gln- Pro-Val-Ala-Val-Phe-Leu-Gly-Val-Pro-Phe-Ala-Lys- Pro-Pro-Leu-Gly-Ser-Leu-Arg-Phe-Ala-Pro-Pro-Gln- Pro-Ala-Glu-Ser-Trp-Ser-His-Val-Lys-Asn (CHO)- Thr-Thr-Ser-Tyr-Pro-Pro-Met-Cys-Ser-Ser. A carbohydrate attachment was identified at asparaginyl residue 61. The COOH-terminal peptide of the protein was isolated from two independent enzymatic digests, and its sequence was established as Arg-Glu-Thr-Glu-His-Ile-Glu-Leu. In order to isolate the DFP binding peptide, liver microsomes were labeled with [3H]DFP and the 60-kDa protein containing covalently bound DFP isolated in pure form. Following reduction and carboxymethylation, the DFP-labeled protein was fragmented with trypsin and the digest subjected to gel filtration. Digestion of the labeled peptide preparations with chymotrypsin followed by chromatography of the digest yielded two diisopropylphosphoryl (DIP) peptides. Automated Edman degradation of these peptides provided the following amino acid sequences: Gly-Glu-DIPSer- Ala-Gly-Gly-Gln-Ser-Val-Ser-Ile-Leu-Leu-Leu-Ser- Pro and Thr-Val-Ile-Gly-Asp-DIPHis-Gly-Asp-Glu-Ile-Phe. The active site serine peptide of the 60-kDa protein shows some 70% similarity to the active center region of choline esterases. While the postulated active histidyl residue in choline esterases has not been identified, it is proposed that the DFP binding histidine of the 60-kDa protein corresponds to His-438/440 of choline esterases.","inCitations":["0c0faa3629e412b2f407be9a1f56636cea3fc619","d9ba511f056107759c624e82899394a65691f6fb","4d1b9764a98df67404c8be348ff9dcc152f0104a","a3637876d5099e5e8c6a2a9bd475ed13a16b630b","fff5c8a14ba114940ea27fa17abe7afd5b850af9"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Isolation and characterization of a 60-kilodalton glycoprotein esterase from liver microsomal membranes.","doi":"","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"The Journal of biological chemistry"}

Less is known about the prognostic value of LA function, however. We have shown that left atrial (LA) strain (e LA ), a descriptor of LA reservoir function, is reduced in hypertensives (HTN). However, e LA , might deteriorate with age and decrease at higher LA volumes. Our goal was to derive a model for e LA which took age and LA size into account, so as to more precisely diagnose LA dysfunction. Methods: 100 healthy volunteers (NLS; 50±15yrs; 58 women) underwent standard echocardiography with evaluation of diastolic function, LA volume (area-length) and e LA by speckle tracking (STI) (GE). Multivariate models were derived from NLS to generate regression equations that were tested in 50 HTN with grade 1–2 diastolic dysfunction (76±14yrs; 72%females) without significant valvular disease. Results: Reduced LA function was defined as e LA th percentile in normals). In stepwise multiple regression, as hypothesized, e LA was significantly and inversely associated with age (β=−0.29: p LA (e LA -c): e LA_ c=e LA +0.198x(age-50)+0.155×(LAvol)-4, where LAvol is unadjusted LA volume in mL. We then repeated the analysis using this ‘corrected’ e LA -c, with a partition value of th percentile). Prevalence of reduced LA function was significantly higher in HTN as compared to NLS by both classifications (p LA , prevalence of LA dysfunction was significantly lower by e LA -c (16% vs 47%; p Conclusions: Atrial function by e LA decreases physiologically with ageing and increasing LA size. These associations should be taken into account when evaluating LA reservoir function. We speculate that e LA -c might conceivably refine cardiovascular risk prediction of LA size.

Because nTreg is a rare population in a healthy individual, the limited source and the non-selective suppression are major hurdles towards the application of nTregs in the control of clinical GVHD after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). An alternative approach is to generate induced Tregs (iTregs) from naïve CD4 precursors, but the effectiveness of iTregs in the control of GVHD is highly controversial and requires further investigation. The other critical but unsolved issue in Treg therapy is how to achieve antigen (Ag)-specific tolerance that distinguishes GVHD and GVL effects. To address the important issues on the effectiveness of iTregs and Ag-specificity of Tregs, we generated Ag-specific iTregs and tested their potential in the prevention of GVHD in a pre-clinical bone marrow transplantation (BMT) model. CD4(+)CD25(+)Foxp3(+) iTregs generated from OT-II TCR transgenic T cells specific for OVA target Ag efficiently prevented GVHD induced by polyclonal T effector cells (Teffs) only in the allogeneic recipients that express OVA protein but not in OVA(-) recipients. The efficacy of these Ag-specific iTregs was significantly higher than polyclonal iTregs. As controls, OT-II CD4(+)Foxp3(-) cells had no effect on GVHD development in OVA(-) recipients and exacerbated GVHD in OVA(+) recipients when transplanted together with polyclonal Teffs. Because the iTregs recognize OVA whereas Teffs recognize alloAg bm12, our data reveal for the first time, to our knowledge, that Tregs prevent GVHD through a linked suppression. Mechanistically, OT-II iTregs expanded extensively, and significantly suppressed expansion and infiltration of Teffs in OVA(+) but not in OVA(-) recipients. These results demonstrate that Ag-specific iTregs can prevent GVHD efficiently and selectively, providing a proof of principle that Ag-specific iTregs may represent a promising cell therapy for their specificity and higher efficacy in allogeneic HCT.","inCitations":["82094f602628e568453f93b5df2bceabd0a60b14","fc5e0a085b008942b40a341857e62560b65af9ff","bc969d85fe8c6b9b6adb268ee16ef6f6447b5589","dae60edf924774979ac18bd047a989944fd9cb19","ef536be4bc1d8f78f3177a8e49181553af50ac86","8de889a1b2d8b2cea02f2334af512b6ab73c451d","ae8f65deb6c2cc8bfd444e601fee6f95500da483","bd616d932d4d389547f381e409970ef3e3628296","aa7f04b6cce5456eac49d58cfa481abc94a517f1","a7c47ecc8a723c3679951309627a9969fdb9f6bd","756714afc1e7b3fd3b2e664b47b84cf921f5f162","165145578ba6d7cee09192b7d9df2971510299c9","a40898d809ddbbc2ceded5be5ea3d4a39ba3fa23","f81b3881a4b3464cfe83238cf0d1e98b0f448d12","99c6d84b4ad2cfc509986bd96a8208dee2b7d736","1d6042919bc53e38286b706baa04c035af3af37c","881506581ad6ca8d98d6512f92cbed145844324b","43730dc37af903e3a87ff4c644a80745ea2bd85b","5f85d3df9a192d65896104b1c6bd7564c9646bf8","8b7d01ce6dc51420549c7b6d0c91b30343cb42e2","880b1b6e45261d1a00041bfb90e5aaeb16ddbbf0"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Efficient and selective prevention of GVHD by antigen-specific induced Tregs via linked-suppression in mice.","doi":"10.1016/j.bbmt.2010.12.710","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbmt.2010.12.710","venue":"Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation"}

The present paper carefully frames and then critically examines such proposals. It turns out that these are contingent, empirical matters, requiring close examination of relevant research in perception science in order to decide. The paper concludes with extended discussions of the empirical study of the perception of slant, size, and shape.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"The Role of Spatial Appearances in Achieving Spatial-Geometric Perceptual Constancy","doi":"10.5840/philtopics201644216","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.5840/philtopics201644216","venue":""}

The study adopted the quasi-experimental design. The sample consisted of 300 SS II Biology students comprising of (150 males and 150 females) obtained through simple random sampling in three schools (100 students per school). Kolb Learning Style Inventory (LSI 1999 version) was used for the identification of the students’ learning styles. The Biology Achievement Test (BAT) was used for the determination of the students’ performance in both pretests and post-tests. The reliability of the instruments (LSI and BAT) were ascertained by the use of Cronbach alpha statistic and Kuder Richardson formula 20 (K – R) 20 respectively. The coefficients of internal consistency were established at 0.72 and 0.78 respectively. Findings from the study showed that the four learning styles of Kolb were represented amongst the biology AFRREV, VOL. 9(1), S/NO 36, JANUARY, 2015 215 Copyright © IAARR, 2015: www.afrrevjo.net Indexed African Journals Online: www.ajol.info students; that many students preferred to learn by more than one mode of information presentation; learning style varies from one group to another and there is no significant difference in the biology mean scores of the students with interaction between learning styles and their gender. It was recommended among others that Biology teachers should identity the learning styles of their students and use teaching strategies that complements them. Introduction Learning style is defined as the manner and the conditions under which learners most efficiently and effectively perceive, process, store and recall what they are attempting to learn (Zhou, 2011).The different ways of learning are referred to as learning style. To address this concern, teachers should understand their students’ learning style preferences and be interested in developing teaching approaches to address the learning needs of all their students, because good teaching approach or method according to Ibe (2013) will help make the class session more effective and encourage student participation in the class. Students have specific learning style preferences, and these preferences may be different between male and female students. Understanding a student’s learning style preference is an important consideration when designing classroom instruction. To better understand the learners and their learning style characteristics, and to assist in the development of teaching strategies that will maximize motivation and learning for students of both genders, we have to develop teaching approaches that will address the learning needs of all of our students, male and female. Although teachers are still taxed with preparing their pupils for the future, no longer are their lessons confined to the textbook and the traditional classroom, (Finson , Pedersen and Thomas ,2006).). Learning style is seen by Kolb (2000, p. 1) as “the way we prefer to absorb and incorporate new information”. Different people have different ways of learning, and that per se, those ways are neither good nor bad” (Smith & Kolb, 1986, in Kolb, 2000). Given various preferences for perceiving and processing information, Kolb (1984) has suggested four different learning styles: Accommodator, Diverger, Assimilator, and Converger (see Figure 1).

Accommodator refers to a person who favours Concrete Experiencing and Active Experimentation learning dimensions (i.e., a person who prefers to perceive information from feeling and process it by doing). 2. Diverger refers to a person who favors Concrete Experiencing and Reflective Observation learning dimensions (i.e., a person who prefers to perceive information from feeling and learn about the processing of information by watching). 3. Converger refers to a person who favors Abstract Conceptualization and Active Experimentation learning dimensions (i.e., a person who prefers to perceive information by thinking and doing). 4. Assimilator refers to a person who favors Abstract Conceptualization and Reflective Observation learning dimensions (i.e., a person who prefers to learn by thinking and watching/listening). Stages of Kolb’s Learning Cycle (Kolb, 1984, p. 5) Concrete Experience (CE)-Learning from feeling: Learning from specific experiences; Relating to people; Sensitivity to feelings and people and Open-minded and adaptable to change. Reflective Observation (RO) Learning by watching and listening: Careful observation before making a judgment; Viewing things from different perspectives and Looking for the meaning of things. EFFECTS OF LEARNING STYLES ON THE PERFORMANCES OF SSS BIOLOGY STUDENTS AFRREV, VOL. 9(1), S/NO 36, JANUARY, 2015 217 Copyright © IAARR, 2015: www.afrrevjo.net Indexed African Journals Online: www.ajol.info Abstract Conceptualization (AC) Learning by thinking: Logical analysis of ideas; Systematic planning; Develop theories and ideas to solve problems and Acting on an intellectual understanding of a situation. Active Experimentation (AE) Learning by doing; Ability to get things done; Risk taking and Influencing people and events through action. The knowledge of student preferred learning styles is vital if teachers or educators are to provide tailored strategies for individual students (Fleming, 1995). Knowing students’ preferred learning style also helps to overcome the predisposition of many teachers to treat all students in a similar way (Fleming, 1995) as well as motivate teachers to move from their preferred mode(s) to using others. In so doing, they can reach more students because of the better match between teacher and learner styles (McCarthy, 2010, Okur and Bahar, 2010, Mlambo, 2011 and Ossai, 2012). For example, there is a clear trend in university teaching to instruct all students in the same way (i.e., a straight lecture format). Educators use this lecture format because of the relative ease of information passing, the need to cover the content, a long history of traditional lecturing, and perhaps due to their own preferences in learning. This may require instructors to stray from their own preferred mode(s) of teaching and learn to be using a variety of styles, which will positively affect learning. By using a variety of teaching approaches, teachers will reach more students because of the better match between teacher and learner styles. A good match between students’ learning preferences and instructor’s teaching style has been demonstrated to have positive effect on student's performance (Kinshuk and Graf ,2009) observed that when teaching style is matched with the learner’s cognitive operation (learning style), teaching and learning become more productive and rewarding. Learning preference refers to a person’s “natural, habitual and preferred way” of assimilating new information. This implies that individuals differ with regard to what mode of instruction or study is most effective for them. Scholars, who promote the learning preferences approach to learning, agree that effective instruction can only be undertaken if the learner’s learning preferences are diagnosed and the instruction is tailored accordingly (Pashler, McDaniel, Rohrer, and Bjork, 2008). “I hear and I forget. I see and I remember. I do and I understand.” (Confucius 551-479 BC) – a quote that provides evidence that, even in early times, there was a recognition of the existence of different learning preferences among people. Indeed, Mlambo (2011) reports that some students seem to learn better when information is presented through words (verbal learners), whereas others seem to learn better when it is presented in the form of pictures (visual learners). Clearly in a class where only one instructional method is employed, there is a strong possibility that a number of students will find the learning environment less optimal and this could affect their academic performance. Okur and Bahar (2010) established that AFRREV, VOL. 9(1), S/NO 36, JANUARY, 2015 218 Copyright © IAARR, 2015: www.afrrevjo.net Indexed African Journals Online: www.ajol.info alignment between students’ learning preferences and an instructor’s teaching style leads to better recall and understanding. The learning preferences approach has gained significant mileage despite the lack of experimental evidence to support the utility of this approach. The theoretical framework of the study is hinged on Dewey’s Experiential Learning Theory which posits that learning is seen as a continuous and interactive process. Learning style theories help explain the way one acquires knowledge. He formed the learning theory from the combination of acquiring experience and transforming it to knowledge. According to Dewey (1938), experiential learning is the process whereby knowledge is gained through experience, and there are four distinct stages to the learning cycle, as noted in Figure 4. Ezekoka (2010) conducted a study of “gender relationship in the learning styles preference of students in Imo State”. In carrying out the research, she adopted an experimental research design and used Kolb’s Learning Style Inventory (LSI) 1999 version and Biology Achievement Test (BAT) as the Instruments. The aim was to identify the learning styles preference of male and female students. She used 287 students from the sampled schools and the results showed that majority of the females (38%) were assimilators, followed by convergers (30%), and then accommodators (16.3%) and the least were divergers (15.7%). While majority of the males were convergers (51.6%), ","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://www.ajol.info/index.php/afrrev/article/download/113903/103614"],"title":"Kolb ’ s Learning Styles Concrete Experience ( CE-Feeling ) Accommodator Diverger Active Reflective Experimentation Observation ( AE-Doing ) ( RO-Watching )","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

In a transmission scenario such as broadcasting, this structure is quite advantageous as it can be used to address heterogeneous decoding targets with variable needs and requirements. However, this adaptability comes at a slight cost in coding efficiency when compared to single-layer coding. Based on subjective experiments, this cost is evaluated in this paper by comparing the new MPEG-4 Scalable Video Coding (SVC) standard with the now-established MPEG-4 AVC standard. Two scenarios are analyzed in the context of mobile transmission applications. The first scenario uses the same bitrate for SVC and AVC, leading to a slightly lower PSNR for SVC. The second scenario uses the same PSNR for SVC and AVC, leading to a slightly lower bitrate for AVC. The results of the subjective tests illustrate several interesting aspects of the relation between the performance of the two standards. First, we observe that the offset between AVC and SVC is not severe, though statistically significant in terms of user Mean Opinion Score (MOS) in such a context. Second, while adding another layer to SVC always leads to a performance loss, the impact of this loss decreases when the number of layers increases.","inCitations":["b5e22d59f3991df3b43bc77c702b7314e5129ed7","9f740373bafd1e15549c33d9a1fbdc57d0c5c3bc","75e386a04a3f79376888490a6a6a0ceec5f8df51","2ea4e534d1f647d557017b336a578ad796e590dd","5b22162d8436ca86e7c37be989e124dc0aa8a4e7","891999856aafdcfe0377ee058bba716612132213","e4531c384c24d679b0270dff7f3fc3d61432cc54","9b68b03bec9b15da2723fb5302cd96ec7b1f1d4d"],"pdfUrls":["https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/file/index/docid/608333/filename/subjective_quality_of_svc_in_mobile_context_euvip2010.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1109/EUVIP.2010.5699138","https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Patrick_Le_Callet/publication/224214158_Subjective_quality_assessment_of_MPEG-4_Scalable_Video_Coding_in_a_mobile_scenario/links/00b7d520cf30c92877000000.pdf"],"title":"Subjective quality assessment of MPEG-4 Scalable Video Coding in a mobile scenario","doi":"10.1109/EUVIP.2010.5699138","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EUVIP.2010.5699138","venue":"2010 2nd European Workshop on Visual Information Processing (EUVIP)"}

The major instrument used for data collection was the personality traits and students’ career decisions questionnaire (PTSCDQ) and data generated were analyzed using the independent t-test analysis. The null hypotheses were tested at 0.05 level of significance. The result obtained indicated that personality traits of attitude and perception have a significant influence on career decision among secondary school students. Based on this among others, it was concluded that career decision among students are not only influenced by their parents and image figures but their attitude, perception and individual traits depending on how they think about such careers. It was therefore recommended that, professional counselors, parents/guardians, teachers and administrators alike should strive to create career awareness and give more attention to the personality trait of attitude and perception as displayed by students.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://oapub.org/edu/index.php/ejae/article/download/1186/3454"],"title":"The Influence of Personality Traits on Career Decision among Secondary School Students in Yakurr Local Government Area of Cross River State ,","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

In such cases, eddy current losses are induced in those cooling tubes because of the time variant magnetic field. To compute the cooling tubes losses, either a transient finite element simulation (mostly based on commercial software), or a full analytical method, which is more complex to be constructed, is required. Instead, this paper proposes a simple and an accurate combined semi-analytical-finite element method to calculate the losses of electric machines having cooling tubes. The 2D magnetostatic solution of the magnetic field is obtained e.g., using the free package “FEMM”. Then, the eddy current losses in the tubes are computed using simple analytical equations. In addition, the iron core losses could be obtained. In order to validate the proposed method, two cases are investigated. In Case 1, a six-toothed stator of a switched reluctance machine (SRM), without rotor, is employed in which six cooling tubes are used while in Case 2 a complete rotating SRM is studied. The proposed method is validated by a 2D transient simulation in the commercial software “ANSYS Maxwell” and also by experimental measurements. Evidently, the proposed method is simple and fast to be constructed and it is almost free of cost.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://biblio.ugent.be/publication/8635103/file/8635104.pdf"],"title":"Prediction of Eddy Current Losses in Cooling Tubes of Direct Cooled Windings in Electric Machines","doi":"10.3390/math7111096","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.3390/math7111096","venue":""}

The parameters; tool mass  tool natural frequency , tool damping ratio  and feed speed  are considered fixed for the millers. An end-milling tooth normally has positive rake angle and small cutting edge radius thus workpiece material cutting coefficient  is also considered fixed since ploughing effect is not expected to be noticeably affected by change in number of teeth. It is seen that periodic cutting force reduces as the number of teeth increases. A method of milling stability analysis as proposed by Ding et al known as full-discretization is utilized in generating the stability charts. Use is made of the Simpson’s rule in establishing for the studied system that chatter stability decreases as the number of teeth increases in the low spindle speed range  and that lowest chatter stability at high spindle speed range  occurs for the five tooth miller. Recommendations are made for the machinist based on these findings. The critical characteristic multipliers at single minimum point of each secondary Hopf bifurcation lobe (SHBL) are postulated to leave the unit circle along imaginary axis when number of teeth of slotting miller is greater than two. This phenomenon is noticed for the one and two tooth millers at two turning points that are not necessarily local minima of each SHBL.

In this paper, we investigate anti-Ramsey multiplicity for several families of graphs. We determine classes of graphs which are either anti-common or not. Some of these classes follow the same behavior as the monochromatic case, but some of them do not. In particular the rainbow equivalent of Sidorenko's conjecture, that all bipartite graphs are anti-common, is false.","inCitations":["0436460538bc1a3519457a0d88a133ba78831694"],"pdfUrls":["https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.00474v2.pdf","https://ajc.maths.uq.edu.au/pdf/73/ajc_v73_p357.pdf"],"title":"Anti-Ramsey Multiplicities","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

The radiation scattered by an electron subjected to an arbitrary electromagnetic field distribution in vacuum is first derived in the linear regime, and in the absence of radiative corrections; it is found that each vacuum eigenmode gives rise to a single Doppler-shifted classical dipole excitation. This formalism is then applied to Compton scattering in a three-dimensional laser focus, and yields a complete description of the influence of the electron beam phase-space topology on the x-ray spectral brightness; analytical expressions including the effects of emittance and energy spread are also obtained in the one-dimensional limit. Within this framework, the x-ray brightness generated by a 25 MeV electron beam is modeled, fully taking into account the beam emittance and energy spread, as well as the three-dimensional nature of the laser focus; its application to x-ray protein crystallography is outlined. Finally, coherence, harmonics, and radiative corrections are also briefly discussed.","inCitations":["7fa39e9926f428cd8d19e9bde62784323e3e7c1f"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Three-dimensional theory of emittance in Compton scattering and x-ray protein crystallography.","doi":"10.1063/1.1384375","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1063/1.1384375","venue":"Physical review.

These oscillations are considered to be the signatures of a wave phenomenon and are generally interpreted in terms of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) waves. With multiwavelength observations from ground- and space-based instruments, it has been possible to detect waves in a number of different wavelengths simultaneously and, consequently, to study their propagation properties. Observed MHD waves propagating from the lower solar atmosphere into the higher regions of the magnetized corona have the potential to provide excellent insight into the physical processes at work at the coupling point between these different regions of the Sun. High-resolution wave observations combined with forward MHD modeling can give an unprecedented insight into the connectivity of the magnetized solar atmosphere, which further provides us with a realistic chance to reconstruct the structure of the magnetic field in the solar atmosphere. This type of solar exploration has been termed atmospheric magnetoseismology. In this review we will summarize some new trends in the observational study of waves and oscillations, discussing their origin and their propagation through the atmosphere. In particular, we will focus on waves and oscillations in open magnetic structures (e.g., solar plumes) and closed magnetic structures (e.g., loops and prominences), where there have been a number of observational highlights in the past few years. Furthermore, we will address observations of waves in filament fibrils allied with a better characterization of their propagating and damping properties, the detection of prominence oscillations in UV lines, and the renewed interest in large-amplitude, quickly attenuated, prominence oscillations, caused by flare or explosive phenomena.\n","inCitations":["8c7a3b66be0ad0dc3fd49c7e5da34ad043ea0a19","d65ccd4a70facc660969876b61f17d4d0e756132","1940f1c07fa4deef1ec44b621e22564fb25cf12f","eb72447ea1246a2a7a26db1c3a64bce4282e242d","dc69276526418f416afda059fce986d0580d2dad","64527f5840ddd0eea92d4df5276d96590c5ec74e","b7532d179f069b874e7141b20f31cae69f6c8a7b","aaf3a33fdbea6f0b4dc28582b2384a0aa1a11e9f","b3aca7e026a7abeddfa858e46dafa46186c0ae09","59ab0f50a316b1b1be304a29810780b9b8e5f47e","315880e9d6a5d45fd1d3d823c0b00a435a17eada","181e20e57b7936a1772562cc025c24dee47671d1","abac6d7863a0b57a63f3b622e76cc924d9ba6125"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Present and Future Observing Trends in Atmospheric Magnetoseismology","doi":"10.1007/s11207-007-9029-z","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11207-007-9029-z","venue":""}

Melbourne: Five Islands Press, 2006. 120 pp. A$21.95. ISBN 0-7340-3648-5.Quickly, urgently, the first three poems of Robyn Rowland's Silence & its tongues announce themes of silence, despair, and yearning that she will explore throughout the rest of the book. These themes challenge the reader to confront a part of the human psyche not easily understood and therefore too easily ignored or dismissed. In free verse that Rowland uses throughout the sixty-one poems, the first poem \"Dispatch from the dome,\" opines, \"This is where I have always lived-I knew that -/ receptor for a silence that cannot be broken,/ aloneness that cannot be spoken\" (12). The second poem, \"The strength of words,\" establishes both despair and yearning-\"'a thousand letters, a thousand voice.'/And I still wait on one\" (13), while the third poem \"Silence\" combines silence, despair, and yearning in the final powerfully packed lines: \"You do not call or write./[. . .]/ silence is a cold and difficult language\" (14). Rowland devotes her considerable poetic talents and her unrelenting honesty to the remaining poems as she explores family history, illness, friendship, and a renewed faith in love.The most engrossing poems are contained in Part II, \"Dead Mother Poems: a selection.\" They are also the most challenging, even troubling, for the reader to digest. In the \"Acknowledgements,\" Rowland confesses that the poems \"explore depression,\" and that \"learning to manage [depression] [. . .] takes work.\" These poems make manifest that work. This begs the question: why would anyone want to read poems that deal with depression? While readers with a low threshold for poetry that explores depression will have little patience for this collection, I argue that there is much to value. Anyone who has struggled with the loss of a parent will empathize with Rowland's artistic renderings of conflicting emotions. The confusion and anger of \"Adhesion\" is a good example. \"What did you do here to make one mind out of two/then leave me alone?\" Rowland ends the same poem with a necessarily graphic image of cleaving one's image from the parent's: \"It's sliding along my spine now-/the filleting knife\" (49). \"The Moment Open\" describes the moment of the mother's death, and yet there is an absurd amount of color common to much of Rowland's poetry: \"Pink seamist rises in a sigh/as day opens to the unblinking blaze\" (58). Rowland argues that dealing with a parent's death catches one in the warp and weft of both sensory deprivation and overload. A parent's death is a denning moment in a person's life. Few parent-child relationships are without complications, and the parent's death demands a child's reckoning. Rowland's poetry is a literary rendering of one child's reckoning.In addition, anyone who struggles with depression (or anyone who loves someone who struggles with depression) will appreciate the poet's keen artistic insights. …","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Poems Written in \"The Braille of Yearning\"","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

One hopeful approach to reverse the MDR is to develop inhibitors of P-gp in expression and/or function. Here, we designed and synthesized a series of chalcone derivatives as P-gp inhibitors and evaluated their potential reversal activities against MDR. Among them, the most active compound MY3 had little intrinsic cytotoxicity and showed the highest activity (RF = 50.19) in reversing DOX resistance in MCF-7/DOX cells. Further studies demonstrated that MY3 could increase intracellular accumulation of DOX and inhibit expression of P-gp at mRNA and protein levels. More importantly, MY3 significantly enhanced the efficacy of DOX against the tumor xenografts bearing MCF-7/DOX cells with the precondition of unchanged body weight. Therefore, MY3 might represent a promising lead to develop MDR reversal agents for cancer chemotherapy.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Design, synthesis and biological evaluation of chalcones as reversers of P-glycoprotein-mediated multidrug resistance.","doi":"10.1016/j.ejmech.2019.05.053","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejmech.2019.05.053","venue":"European journal of medicinal chemistry"}

More specifically, returns must be high enough to also pay out the value of waiting if conversion into more intensive land uses is to become optimal. However, many environmental policies today focus on nature restoration, where conversion has previously taken place. In this study, we therefore reverse the problem and ask when to afforest productive agricultural land, when we face uncertainty about the value of ecosystem services delivered by afforestation. Furthermore, projects such as afforestation are often associated with joint production of forest products and environmental goods, like biodiversity, hunting, groundwater production, carbon storage, recreation etc. Thus, we extend state-of-the-art models to handle two additive ecosystem services, which both are uncertain and may be correlated. The joint production aspect increases the value of conversion, the stopping value, and hence the incentives to afforest. Increasing uncertainty decreases this incentive, as expected. However, contrary to the existing literature evaluating exclusive options, less than perfect correlation between the values of future ecosystem services decreases the value of the real option and increases the set of states, where afforestation is the preferred decision. This causes afforestation to be attractive for a wider set of states of the world than otherwise and has implications where joint production is feasible. We discuss these findings and the potential application of this analysis for handling real options with joint production in other research domains.","inCitations":["231012e2c8f91382286189e6e3476e7513172efc"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Afforestation as a real option with joint production of environmental services.","doi":"10.1016/j.forpol.2019.04.015","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.forpol.2019.04.015","venue":""}

The aim of this study was to investigate the alterations of cardiac autonomic function of diabetic patients in relation to three types of diabetes-related complications. ECG recordings were collected and analyzed from 169 T2DM patients in supine position who were diagnosed with nephropathy (n = 55), peripheral neuropathy (n = 64) and retinopathy (n = 106) at two hospitals in the UAE. Comparison between combinations of patients with complications and a control diabetic group (CONT) with no complication (n = 34) was performed using time, frequency and multi-lag entropy measures of heart rate variability (HRV). The results show that these measures decreased significantly (p<0.05) depending on the presence and type of diabetic complications. Entropy, (median, 1st- 3rd interquartile range) for the group combining all complications (1.74,1.37-2.09) was significantly lower than the corresponding values for the CONT group (1.77, 1.39-2.24) with lag-1 for sequential beat-to-beat changes. Odds ratios (OR) from the entropy analysis further demonstrated a significantly higher association with the combination of retinopathy and peripheral neuropathy versus CONT (OR: 1.42 at lag 8) and an even OR for the combination of retinopathy and nephropathy (OR: 2.46 at lag 8) compared to the other groups with complications. Also, the OR of low frequency power to high frequency power ratio (LF/HF) showed a higher association with these diabetic-related complications compared to CONT, especially for the patient group combining all complications (OR: 4.92). This study confirms that the type of microvascular or peripheral neuropathy complication present in T2DM patients have different effects on heart rate entropy, implying disorders of multi-organ connectivity are directly associated with autonomic nervous system dysfunction. Clinical practice may benefit from including multi-lag entropy for cardiac rhythm analysis in conjunction with traditional screening methods in patients with diabetic complications to ensure better preventive and treatment outcomes in the Emirati Arab population.","inCitations":["3c6e09b80848d17409a4f7ed8b3e36b726427556","9d733547ddef649cc1d1d32b6a71aff8f659e04c","c6ecf2eb0747a1a4417d4a1f21bd35c66503c056","4f23b7efe46249cc14f75354fde0f282930f76af","c8d01ee82293f5fa3e305415537a3f573377914b","bf998320a424d1687d33b8a2c4da795e1e88ec31","d0a3c0a759936c73f74d572e05899d18b1076b42"],"pdfUrls":["https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0168584&type=printable","https://researchoutput.csu.edu.au/ws/portalfiles/portal/20171920/10264426_Published_article_OA.pdf"],"title":"Association of Diabetes Related Complications with Heart Rate Variability among a Diabetic Population in the UAE","doi":"10.1371/journal.pone.0168584","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0168584","venue":"PloS one"}

La Llei de politica territorial de Catalunya (Llei de Catalunya 23/1983, de 21 de novembre) es presenta, per tant, com el primer sistema d’ordenacio territorial de l’Estat de les autonomies. Un primer sistema d’ordenacio territorial amb uns continguts que semblen condicionats per la influencia d’elements territorials i economics. Cal parlar d’elements territorials per referir-se a les concepcions que identifiquen l’ordenacio territorial amb un sistema de planejament fisic superior. Aixi, la legislacio urbanistica tradicional havia regulat, com a instruments d’ordenacio territorial, el Pla nacional d’ordenacio i els plans directors territorials de coordinacio (art. 7 i 8 del Text refos de la Llei del sol de 1976). Si be aquests instruments mai no es van arribar a formular, almenys amb el contingut coordinador dissenyat pel legislador estatal, no obstant aixo, l’intent d’establir una jerarquia planificatoria entre plans territorials i urbanistics pot tenir origen en les regulacions urbanistiques corresponents. Aixo permetria explicar que en la Llei de politica territorial de Catalunya s’ordeni que els plans urbanistics siguin coherents amb els territorials (art. 11.4). Al mateix temps, la identificacio de continguts de gran transcendencia, que en justificarien la superioritat, en els plans dissenyats per la Llei de politica territorial de Catalunya, sembla que procedeix de la caracteritzacio de l’ordenacio del territori com l’expressio 1.

This strategy is commonly referred to as highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) or combined antiretroviral therapy (cART). Membrane-associated drug transporters expressed ubiquitously in mammalian systems play a crucial role in modulating ARV disposition during HIV-1 infection. Members of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) and solute carrier (SLC) transporter superfamilies have been shown to interact with ARVs, including those that are used as part of first-line treatment regimens. As a result, the functional expression of drug transporters can influence the distribution of ARVs at specific sites of infection. In addition, pathological factors related to HIV-1 infection and/or ARV therapy itself can alter transporter expression and activity, thus further contributing to changes in ARV disposition and the effectiveness of HAART. This review summarizes current knowledge on the role of drug transporters in regulating ARV transport in the context of HIV-1 infection.","inCitations":["c11b7141287c25884774d7a55ce831bd4ae27d37","70cdcf8bd62f873bb5b517a66b4145ad278b0213","71d1f398f88e705422ce43cec818260898a8ca59","a192dc4dd3036fbd4c5574019c2126162509b26c","862f94698c14e9019e44dbaa3375e88af58db20a","2019885835a81a57b5eda86e8043183cefa05c53","5f8e24986903594db4d5f3eb6801c83ebc38c1d3","e922979075207fcc1a5431bcac4410daef205d3a","f7c52df34254e0c0d473b2c7a006b6c2d8365c97","49f3e74b2c2e659dccf1485916d701bc1f6c148c","4386cdd7cf2eae120b937b9748f947f94191eca8"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Role and modulation of drug transporters in HIV-1 therapy.","doi":"10.1016/j.addr.2016.05.001","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.addr.2016.05.001","venue":"Advanced drug delivery reviews"}

The numerical analysis makes use of the recent insertion of a ballast FE into the FE code FIBRE. The element complies with the Italian railway specifications and has been tested and validated accordingly. The program, originally developed to model the seismic (dynamic) response of civil structures, can perform step-by-step non-linear analyses in the time domain using a state-of-the-art library of fibre beam-column elements and other bridge dedicated FEs such as frictional bearing, gap, tendons, etc. Following the implementation of the ballast element, the non-linear static and dynamic responses of railway bridges can be analysed considering the track—structure interaction effects. With the same FE mesh, temperature effects, quasi-static, and dynamic (resonant) response under live loading as well as seismic response of bridge structures can now be analysed with a unified approach. In all these cases, the continuous welded rail significantly modifies the response of railway bridges, especially in the small to medium span range. After discussing the new ballast FE, a numerical case study is presented showing all the different types of analyses that can be performed with the program. The principal mechanisms governing the response of railway girders and bridges are discussed showing the stress—strain time histories of the principal bridge elements.","inCitations":["3365b57ec560d2643e5a72c220c724baa1f197a1","8e562b7c688bafaecf3cec80fe971f77c4872a34","be7e231d507acb66d059546b02056e580f170a9c"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Numerical analysis of track: Structure interaction and time domain resonance","doi":"10.1243/09544097JRRT168","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1243/09544097JRRT168","venue":""}

They can pollute the soil .We realized that there were serious heavy metal pollu-tion situation in Xinxiang through the preparation test. Therefore,we decide to study how to remediate Cd-Ni compound contami-nated soils .Taking the Cd-Ni contaminated farmlands in Xinxiang as research object,An experiment was conducted to investigate the influence of EDTA,citric acid on the activation of Cd and Ni in Cd-Ni contaminated soil. The results showed that the releasing amounts of Cd and Ni increased with the increase of EDTA or citric acid concentration. EDTA was more effective on the activation of Cd,and Ni than citric acid . EDTA or citric acid treated with 10.0 mmol·L-1 had the highest release capacity,Ni was not easy to activate. The results indicated that,when we remediate Cd-Ni compound contaminated soils,the best repairing efficiency was ob-served in the treatment of applying 5.0 mmol·L-1or 10.0 mmol·L-1 citric acid.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Effect of EDTA and citric acid on activation of cadium and nickel in Cd-Ni contaminated soil","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

We used fluorescence microscopy of live fission yeast cells to observe that membrane-bound nodes containing myosin were broadly distributed around the cell equator and assembled into a contractile ring through stochastic motions, after a meshwork of dynamic actin filaments appeared. Analysis of node motions and numerical simulations supported a mechanism whereby transient connections are established when myosins in one node capture and exert force on actin filaments growing from

The position of the permanent maxillary canine at the angle of the mouth is strategically important in preserving the harmony and symmetry of the dental arches. The incidence of maxillary canine impaction in the maxilla is more than twice higher compared to the mandible. Approximately one-thirds of the cases are labially located, and two-thirds are palatally located. Bilateral impaction has been reported in 8% of the patients with canine impaction. The treatment procedure is time-consuming and imposes a significant financial burden on the patient. Impacted maxillary canines could be erupted and guided to an appropriate location in the dental arch with early detection, timely interception, and proper surgical management in order to perform orthodontic treatment. Various surgical and orthodontic techniques could be used to guide impacted canines into the arch. Accurate selection of surgical and orthodontic techniques is essential to the successful alignment of impacted teeth. Management of impacted tooth often requires an interdisciplinary approach. In addition, proper cooperation of the orthodontist, oral surgeon, and periodontist seems crucial in this process. The present study aimed to review the clinical and practical aspects required for the management of maxillary canine impaction based on the location and age of the impaction.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://rcm.mums.ac.ir/article_12395_f6f09c0fc9534cf27c7ad15ea7a67114.pdf"],"title":"Surgical Management of Various Types of Maxillary Canine Impaction: A Narrative Review","doi":"10.22038/rcm.2019.35620.1250","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.22038/rcm.2019.35620.1250","venue":""}

The interactions between solid and liquid phase were presented as forces such as drag, pressure gradient force, virtual mass force, gravity, electrostatic forces, thermophoretic and Brownian forces. The energy transfer from particle to continuous phase can be introduced through both convective and conduction terms on the surface of the particles. A study of both approaches was conducted in the case of laminar and turbulent forced convections as well as cavity flow natural convection. The cases included horizontal and vertical pipes and a rectangular cavity. An experimental study was conducted for cavity flow to be compared with the simulation results. The results of the forced convections were evaluated with data from literature. Alumina and zinc oxide nanoparticles with different sizes were used in cavity experiments and the same for simulations. All the equations, slip mechanisms and forces were implemented in ANSYS-Fluent through some user-defined functions. The comparison showed good agreement between experiments and numerical results. Nusselt number and pressure drops were the heat transfer and flow features of nanofluid and were found in the ranges of the accuracy of experimental measurements. The findings of the two approaches were somehow different, especially regarding the concentration distribution. The mixture model provided more uniform distribution in the domain than the DPM. Due to the Lagrangian frame of the DPM, the simulation time of this model was much longer. The method proposed in this research could also be a useful tool for other areas of particulate systems.","inCitations":["1afd44f1e18fc0e27c4a3fecde7b69c99dc8ddf4","b42eb7ac95282ec53206d3c3f5c131b37f2742b8"],"pdfUrls":["https://repository.up.ac.za/bitstream/handle/2263/61309/Mahdavi_Study_2017.pdf?isAllowed=y&sequence=1"],"title":"Study of flow and heat transfer features of nanofluids using multiphase models : eulerian multiphase and discrete Lagrangian approaches","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

High-resolution G-banding of human, cat, mink, and fox chromosomes containing homologous regions (according to genetic maps) revealed regions of putative homology. The results lend support to the suggestion that the most considerable karyotypic reorganization of the ancestral genome in the order Carnivora occurred during Canidae formation.
