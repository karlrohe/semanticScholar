Narratives about humour and use of humour in the group are analysed from a discursive psychological perspective, informed by insights from both disability studies and critical autism studies. The setting of the research is ethnographic fieldwork in an educational setting in Sweden. In the paper, I show the use of three storylines among a natural group of people with autism (PWA) when talking about humour: the storyline of humourless PWA that dominates within Swedish society; and two alternatives, a storyline of alternative humour among PWA and another storyline in line with the social model of disability, of neurotypical humour or disabling humour. When invoking these two alternative storylines, PWA challenge both the humourlessness storyline and the lack of social accessibility within mainstream neurotypical settings.","inCitations":["0e97287159995d1f88a631923c2d6a3e47e88d96","01f7f5e797977190d12a448744999c64a70b6159","9ccc84d5c55493b394767a8fc1d17ac76cc20cfc","cb658491d170539129569404708a2274c1838df4"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"The politics of joking: narratives of humour and joking among adults with Asperger’s syndrome","doi":"10.1080/09687599.2011.644933","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1080/09687599.2011.644933","venue":""}

The dependence of the Mach number and the period of the wave train on the shock amplitude shows that the shock structure is related to solitary waves. For a larger-amplitude shock, however, the trailing wave train is small or disappears, and a potential jump followed by large-amplitude oscillations propagating with a slower velocity than that of the shock front is observed. The amplitude of the oscillations is sufficiently large to trap a significant number of electrons and to form vortices in phase space.","inCitations":["e2f08d66b7050dc282efc5900d1105f345e32379"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Electron Plasma Wave Shocks in a Collisionless Plasma","doi":"10.1143/JPSJ.35.251","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1143/JPSJ.35.251","venue":""}

Data were collected from 10 blood-related parents of clients who received treatment from a community mental health center's outpatient clozapine clinic. All family members felt that their relative had responded positively to clozapine treatment. Effects were described as subtle yet remarkable to family members. Family relationships improved as a result of the client's positive response, as the positive effects that the family members described largely had to do with the client's increased ability to relate to others, along with an increased interest and ability to participate in social activities. Finally, strong family advocacy seemed to be a major factor in this sample of clients having access to clozapine.","inCitations":["8d6297f2221627264f21478944c502d859ce3a74","8e78d835d82ed2259ab96f6c62b2f9f7ee18c620","68de3b6abeeeff32b68fd2dd6c86f186f66f8ff1"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Family experience with positive client response to clozapine.","doi":"10.1016/S0883-9417(95)80013-1","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/S0883-9417%2895%2980013-1","venue":"Archives of psychiatric nursing"}

Aquest \nre-disseny es basara basicament en la novetat d’aconseguir un \nfuncionament mecanic, estalviant estris i despeses. \nLa maquina consta d'una estructura solida d'acer, a mode de xassis, on hi \nvan allotjats tots els mecanismes i parts de la maquina. Aquesta estructura \nesta protegida amb tapes de seguretat a les zones on hi ha parts en \nmoviment per evitar accidents i per minimitzar l'acumulacio de bruticia que \nhi acostuma a haver en les naus industrials, lloc on es desitja la seva \ninstal·lacio. \nUna altra de les parts importants en que es divideix l'apilador/dispensador, \nes el sistema o conjunt motriu, el qual consta, entre d'altres, del motor \nelectric que acciona la maquina. Aquest motor tindra acoblat un reductor, \nper tal que la velocitat de gir del motor s'adequi a les voltes necessaries \nper moure el Transportador.

Aquest va instal·lat dins de \nl'estructura, collat a ella mitjancant uns casquets o guies per tal de garantir \nel moviment lineal en direccio vertical.

Experimental evidence relating the electron attachment cross section to the dielectric strength is discussed. Conclusions are reached as to the relation of molecular structure to the electron attaching properties of dielectric gases. A variety of mixtures of SF/sub 6/, Ar, Ne, and N/sub 2/ have been studied to determine the relative importance of electron impact ionization and electron scattering on the breakdown voltage, V/sub s/. Electron scattering (especially in the subexcitation energy range) was found to influence V/sub s/ much more critically than electron impact ionization. Preliminary studies involving mixtures of the polar molecules (1,1,1-CH/sub 3/CF/sub 3/, CHF/sub 3/, and CH/sub 2/F/sub 2/ with SF/sub 6/ and N/sub 2/ showed that electron-dipole scattering does not significantly affect V/sub s/.

Asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), an endogenous inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase, induces endothelial dysfunction in different setting of patients. However, at this moment no data are available about the role of ADMA and IR to induce endothelial dysfunction in an independent way or combined between them. In this study, we investigated, in 63 hypertensives and 21 normotensive healthy subjects, the relationship between ADMA and IR and their possible interaction on endothelial function.\n\n\nMETHODS\nADMA plasma levels were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography, and IR by homeostasis model assessment (HOMA). Endothelial function was estimated by intra-arterial infusion of acetylcholine (ACh) and sodium nitroprusside at increasing doses.\n\n\nRESULTS\nHypertensive patients had significantly higher ADMA, insulin, HOMA and C-reactive protein (CRP) values than normotensive controls (P<0.0001). There were no significant differences in mean l-arginine/ADMA ratio between groups. ACh-stimulated forearm blood flow (FBF) was significantly reduced in hypertensive patients (P<0.0001). In hypertensive group, HOMA was the strongest determinant of FBF, accounting for the 45.5% of its variation. ADMA and gender were the independent determinants of HOMA, accounting for 12.3% and 8.3% of its variation, respectively.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe association between ADMA and IR contributes to identify a possible novel mechanism by which ADMA promotes vascular damage, increasing individual cardiovascular risk in hypertensive patients. However, this hypothesis should be tested in a larger study group.","inCitations":["874ead4e5b3208a2b3786ccf0aee2423fdea91ee","e73f972d58cdc63909c05a3f12b4d0aefe955ae2","3de53842a2f9d49d977e6762849c25708d14e29d","8f9176622de229ec2fe8aef5e73bea7bc1e9aaaf","5500fbc4a50b181032b16f81e9fa560294f6a30b","7d03c0f64ef490a223bb4d31e027b6675eee02a2","1b6b5e28eddf7accff6e2f5c5e46dcfcdbf24c6e","a44e212d802347b55d56fda23fc7b4b94ba43493","ec95b1c929f93ee7559b4557926db83a70d9a342","070dcb43588ffa701be302c1fc87417fa1df8a7f","67fe2a7bc22d77768dd991163210e38995845f53","6e7e7950795fdfcd3907e4b70ead13e295d37874","e2b637c7e43c4fb017f146321e4234d20ef8171c","147cdcb84891451b84d3239d57ec5a960ff2821f","d6c3e5ec5d22361aaff60ae683271816fb4d9f7a","dd421b609694d7ec52d11f0ddb6cb5462035fa5c","0ec524d908ecbab4660c0edb2f44c7623b9affd9","84a8792de0936095e7c14618708dd128304cb19f","5ad264be85839623721a0da15f25735db15961ec","bb4d178e71c5d59258a2293103c7ab1c2d5b2e9b","9785972b7870424b9f18ddd2ae3992015e606411","dfd54b9164d99807fdc5fc553554574a8a7ac685","5d9f5819bde26805d6afe40af066d1bed1d09fe9","8cb6eee4188259a352618608b91cef2f6a2a267f","ce68d6bad93f793a10220628c48345cbed01291d","69c6cd66f1a503ac7d36c069039e6408f2c2846e","e73cf7be7cd061b03d6da30ace9b4662bcbeb8ea","14cbbda93bcb65494d5d44dc7336f02bce2ac13b","d2793236dd848d2aaadf5f903fcaa628ad48197f","0d52efb638cbfc07411ca28319bde3318995f43f","ca79a191c140f4e2b645ce3340b2769aee6d0681","841c3097ea26a6d72f44c9d419a13acfc5d52d76","11e53c730116cedc524587d6647b4bd5ea3508ca","fe1eb0201f299e0e95328366e85e910c349d322c","3e501ca60a24fbb8a8f066dfe7903aef86087fae","52ab797426e99d8102e3dcabfbd31a105ed60047","7650a266e0a08637736dab98b397f06a2ef011e4","0804d8266f13b583ee28f0d02dfef84a6532ac6c","61ac3a1aa6b5ead66f2a8f751e658229cedf07b5","a7aa32f2f7710a7a17d530c5981173dd58e669a9","82c6706d1e4edf3838b626bdc4ccac1d45470ec5","e29826cf667d7b5c450070788f93314e607c4d2d","f9d59906c6c92a0bba136f82d2541038c23b12ee","7cff465f387999e5be067917ca964d2ee6f83ca5","731da1e06694c8aca204dc91d605b35b3a0fddec","0301f5bd61dd78bef4695f0480c592cb94634cf0","a2c687d893fea4c696591847359290f10a4af939","a3fd9aa29c083e38124ceceb0ef256cd1c6d2779","3395ec00f83a15e6f83f756e5e098ad5ed7d4112","9626134fff84b1f39f5341603f589dcb78ba97bc","8be8e03629c709340ce33b59499dc43219c6f2cc","e841f7e4f425819d17fa9b9c9803698658ddb6b1","fb0bb95969e38bfd88cb24a058170ddf12d8dd78"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Endothelial dysfunction, ADMA and insulin resistance in essential hypertension.","doi":"10.1016/j.ijcard.2008.12.131","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijcard.2008.12.131","venue":"International journal of cardiology"}

Parameters assessed included timing of chest re-opening or cardiac pacing orders, and any delays in carrying out these orders.ResultsThe median time required for the medical team leader to order chest re-opening was 4 min. New medical leaders took significantly longer to order chest re-opening than experienced medical team leaders (P = 0.02, Mann–Whitney U test). The performance of the team-in-training deteriorated with the introduction of new members but was correctable with serial training.ConclusionsEffective simulation training integrating chest re-opening and cardiac pacing into standard paediatric resuscitation guidelines may be achieved without high fidelity simulation equipment.","inCitations":["522b94d7ad598f1e2a152ee7339cf957dfd2a0ff","ae0154933c86838e320ba76e5f882d33cb0d3a33","5b3a0564533be405c6eb6477a6c99f77e211c9ed","0723d3e24c4026f674bd448ad4cb2fcb985a038b"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Effective performance of a new post-operative cardiac resuscitation simulation training scheme in the Paediatric Intensive Care Unit","doi":"10.1007/s00134-009-1419-2","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00134-009-1419-2","venue":"Intensive Care Medicine"}

Skeletal muscle-derived metabolites can contribute to the regulation of hepatic metabolism.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nWe aim to elucidate which metabolites are released from the working muscles and taken up by the liver in exercising humans and their potential influence on hepatic function.\n\n\nMETHODS\nIn two separate studies, young healthy males fasted overnight and performed an acute bout of exercise. Arterial-to-venous differences of metabolites over the hepato-splanchnic bed and over the exercising and resting leg were investigated by capillary electrophoresis- and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry metabolomics platforms. Liver transcriptome data of exercising mice were analyzed by pathway analysis to find a potential overlap between exercise-regulated metabolites and activators of hepatic transcription.\n\n\nRESULTS\nDuring exercise, hepatic O2 uptake and CO2 delivery were increased two-fold. In contrast to all other free fatty acids, FFA with 18 carbon atoms and more and a high degree of saturation showed a constant release in the liver vein and only minor changes by exercise. FFA 6:0 and 8:0 were released from the working leg and taken up by the hepato-splanchnic bed. Succinate and malate showed a pronounced hepatic uptake during exercise and were also released from the exercising leg. The transcriptional response in the liver of exercising mice indicates the activation of HIF-, NRF2-, and cAMP-dependent gene transcription. These pathways can also be activated by succinate.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nMetabolites circulate between working muscles and the liver and may support the metabolic adaption to exercise by acting both as substrates and as signaling molecules.","inCitations":["0d127125d53c807a06e65c18b8fd99abd8a380cf"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Muscle-Liver Substrate Fluxes in Exercising Humans and Potential Effects on Hepatic Metabolism","doi":"10.1210/clinem/dgz266","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1210/clinem%2Fdgz266","venue":"The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism"}

Moreover, we performed a lepromin test in nearly all of the members of eight families containing at least two siblings affected with lepromatous leprosy. For 26 families the data permitted analyses of the segregation of parental HLA-haplotypes observed among children in relation to leprosy status. Siblings affected with lepromatous (LL or BL) leprosy shared parental HLA-haplotypes significantly more often than expected (p less than 0.05), and a highly significant deficit (p less than 0.0005) of shared HLA-haplotypes was observed among affected siblings discordant for leprosy type. These data confirm the HLA-linked control of leprosy type and, in particular, recently obtained evidence for linkage of predisposition to lepromatous leprosy with HLA. Healthy siblings did not share a haplotype more often than expected, and those haplotypes which were shared among all leprosy patients of a sibship did not occur less frequently than expected among the healthy siblings of the same sibship. The latter data confirm the absence of linkage of genes conferring susceptibility or resistance to leprosy with HLA. An analysis of the lepromin test results observed among healthy siblings showed no evidence for cosegregation of the results with HLA.","inCitations":["12a6a8b80ed4b56600b3fa5486255ef8973e0453","acde10209d8721585de31ace17323b5b35f7f28c","dc7f52c7197fd9e1eb3d0d902ff1167b04b0eea7","0448567e018dbe4f7def32b40efb608d7b4ad741","bc55869e98bcf1cb6a8e3a72907908f51b62ace4","1bf95728404985235df4eb9041af80a3cf73ab4b","de834bb953ec3f8c86a429078b26b5cd4b604358","c85b76d6b48d43508a9d3de4f5c78e8f34344f4d","f9c3d61316449133c1a1b4cc5729a748c931d48c","da73a45edab966f353cff36827739d5c4c7f5741","05069eef2bcb0fb786eab03c35798ac688998331"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"HLA-linked control of predisposition to lepromatous leprosy.","doi":"","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"International journal of leprosy and other mycobacterial diseases : official organ of the International Leprosy Association"}

For each selected plant, stack flue gas samples were collected during processes that included charging coal into the ovens (CC), pushing coke (PC) and the combustion of coke-oven gas (CG). Sixteen individual PAHs on the US EPA priority list were analyzed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS). Results showed that the total PAH concentrations in the flue gas ranged from 45.776 to 414.874 μg/m 3 , with the highest emission level for CC (359.545 μg/m 3 ). The concentration of PAH emitted from the CC process in CP1 (stamp charging) was lower than that from CP3 and CP4 (top charging). Low-molecular-weight PAHs (i.e., two- to three-ring PAHs) were predominant contributors to the total PAH contents, and Nap, AcPy, Flu, PhA, and AnT were found to be the most abundant ones. Total BaP eq concentrations for CC (2.248 μg/m 3 ) were higher than those for PC (1.838 μg/m 3 ) and CG (1.082 μg/m 3 ), and DbA was an important contributor to carcinogenic risk as BaP in emissions from coking processes. Particulate PAH accounted for more than 20% of the total BaP eq concentrations, which were significantly higher than the corresponding contributions to the total PAH mass concentration (5%). Both particulate and gaseous PAH should be taken into consideration when the potential toxicity risk of PAH pollution during coking processes is assessed. The mean total-PAH emission factors were 346.132 and 93.173 μg/kg for CC and PC, respectively.","inCitations":["9f1f86b3efec0493a0e0df2eac8532946bb2bae4","031c963099dc6546d75ba6be9c8c3bfbefae6d2d","b7ecf2e7d937641b37f46631a054ede65389c2fd","4a04b655364024e6b384512dfb5a386d3bc43003","5a4f42cd372e8165de71487b715da460f14f765c","8c81e9f7b282924e6f15e66446115823e042e203","0236b01fca08f7e9528cf7b49a107df6dc2e4856","00d59be8c7814977e0f6aa0d598f11eef576fc24","f97a4ad29232f88af84fa5076d04c8839e8b869a","97120330b507e6984a4adf93212e3904888e534f","c4983229dc2d8a7aac1542b041c23764b6b5caf0","881ede53d82679d75a7ec8675c29475edd280e8c","abbdb1c8f8d8a6fed04d787a6a97b1136de89ab0","2c14f01682475d10472a2b4eaf6290d3abd29c1b","45b73e8ab2ff04e6d9c14f3453275362b6785be6","555eb3caa2afb21bf790de40eac6393d840378cc","360a79532811d58effb8ae87c0cba5a7d6870522","be8769dc1c8328e84c8ab1b85d0ba046d2fa3571"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.klacp.ac.cn/kycg/scilw/201503/W020150326575427053189.pdf"],"title":"Emissions of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons from coking industries in China","doi":"10.1016/j.partic.2012.04.006","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.partic.2012.04.006","venue":""}

The objective of this research was to produce a genetic evaluation for traits related to feed efficiency of Duroc boars. Meeting this objective required partitioning phenotypic (co)variance into additive genetic and environmental components for feed intake and traits indicative of growth and body composition. Boars (N=3291) were housed in group pens of 22 to 24 animals with two electronic feeders per pen and feed intake was recorded for 8 to 14 wk. Body weight was recorded for each boar at the start and end of test, at approximately 100 kg and at up to three times during the test. The pedigree used contained sire and dam of each boar with at least one recorded phenotype (N=4651) and their maternal and paternal grandsires. Variance components were estimated by restricted maximum likelihood for animal models in a series of uni-variate and bi-variate analyses. Two multiple trait genetic evaluations were conducted to predict estimated breeding value for feed intake using animal models. The first evaluation included feed intake (h2=0.33±0.05), age at 100 kg (h2=0.31±0.04), and subcutaneous fat depth (h2=0.47±0.05). The second genetic evaluation included feed intake, average daily gain (h2=0.27±0.04), mid-test weight (h2=0.33±0.05), and subcutaneous fat depth. Genetic correlations of feed intake with age at 100 kg and fat depth were -0.80±0.05 and 0.57±0.08, respectively. Estimated breeding values for measures of feed efficiency (residual feed intake and residual gain) were calculated from the results of the second analysis and the associated additive genetic (co)variance components.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Genetic parameter estimation and evaluation of Duroc boars for feed efficiency and component traits","doi":"10.1139/CJAS-2014-089","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1139/CJAS-2014-089","venue":"Canadian Journal of Animal Science"}

In this study, the investigation is extended to polycationic macromolecules added into mixtures of polyanions selected to mimic polyanionic species present in blood. The poly(l-lysine) polycation was added to binary mixtures of degradable polyanions with different charge densities and hydrophobicity. The polyanions were poly(l-lysine citramide imide), poly(l-lysine citramide), and poly(l-lysine citramide) partially esterified with heptyl groups. We found selectivity and fractionation in the molar mass, which depended on the structural characteristics of the polyanions. The affinity of polycationic poly(l-lysine) macromolecules to polyanions increased in the following order: poly(l-lysine citramide imide) < poly(l-lysine citramide) < hydrophobized poly(l-lysine citramide). These data complements the previous information with respect to the possibility of polyplex destabilization and/or the interactions of polycationic macromolecules in excess with the polyanionic species present in blood, depending on the physicochemical characteristics of the polyplex, the excess polycation, and blood elements.","inCitations":["6e101b2dd7d71395fbf44867eb7125c5d4613878","91801ab294714fb3d62c9fc2816fdb84e468a91f"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Roles of hydrophobicity and charge density on the dynamics of polyelectrolyte complex formation and stability under modeled physicochemical blood conditions","doi":"10.1177/0883911511436003","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1177/0883911511436003","venue":""}

The wavelength distribution of the spectral solar irradiance clearly narrowed with increasing depth into ice, from 350–900 nm at the pond surface to 400–600 nm in the ocean beneath. In contrast, the net spectral irradiance is quite uniform. The absorbed solar energy is sensitive to both pond depth (Hp) and the underlying ice thickness (Hi). The solar energy absorbed by the melt pond (Ψp) is proportional only to Hp. However, the solar energy absorbed by the underlying ice (Ψi) is more complicated due to the counteracting effects arising from the pond and ice to the energy absorption. In September, Ψp decreased by 10% from its August value, which is attributed to more components in the shortwave band (","inCitations":["ee63eaebf05722667a3fb1e1af58f347aef0295d"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Partitioning of solar radiation in Arctic sea ice during melt season","doi":"10.1016/j.oceano.2018.03.002","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.oceano.2018.03.002","venue":""}

El requeriment per part del client al realitzar l’assaig es de que es compleixi que mitjana-4sigma>=1600DaN. \nEs defineixen els factors que influeixen en aquesta caracteristica i es fa una analisis mitjancant la tecnica del disseny d’experiments per tal de definir les condicions optimes mitjancant les quals aconseguim maxims resultats i minima variabilitat en els resultats de l’assaig a traccio. \nAbans de fer l’estudi mencionat ens adonem que hi ha dos factors que podrien fer que no tinguessim resultats comparables entre les diferents probes requerides per fer el disseny d’experiments: la variabilitat en l’assaig depenent de l’experiencia de l’operari que realitza l’assaig i el temps que passa des de que la peca s’ha fos fins que es realitza l’assaig. \nComprovem que hi ha variabilitat en els resultats de l’assaig depenent de l’experiencia de l’operari.

Rape (B. napus) required 26.5°C days above a Tb of 3.3°C, and „Aparima Gold‟ swedes required 34°C days above a Tb of -0.6°C, until a Topt of 33°C. Kale and Raphanobrassica (B. oleracea) cultivars required 60°C days above a Tb of 0°C until a Topt of 27°C. Estimates of Tm were 48°C for B. rapa, 38°C for B. napus and 35°C for B. oleracea.

However, cases of irreversible graft rejection are sometimes seen in patients who have received an HLA-DR-compatible kidney, suggesting that serologic compatibility for HLA-DR may not always ensure reduced alloreactivity toward the graft. We have examined a number of recipients and their serologically DR-compatible cadaveric donors by Southern blotting and hybridization with locus specific HLA class II probes in order to determine whether in these patients there were class II mismatches that had been undetected by serology. The results show that the analysis of DR beta restriction fragment patterns does little more than complement and confirm the serologic identification of HLA-DR. Hybridization with DQ alpha and DQ beta probes, however, significantly extends the number of DQ specificities that can be detected and suggests that DQ mismatches in DR-compatible donor-recipient pairs may be more common than previously supposed, although it is not possible to draw any conclusions on the influence of DQ incompatibilities in the presence of DR compatibility on graft outcome.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Genomic analysis identifies class II mismatches in serologically DR-compatible human renal allografts.","doi":"10.1016/0198-8859(88)90057-2","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/0198-8859%2888%2990057-2","venue":"Human immunology"}

The technique solves many of the statistical problems which arise when ordinary least squares is used to estimate currency correlation. Applying the technique to the dollar-sterling, DM-sterling, and DM-dollar bilateral exchange rates, the results suggest a market weakening (strengthening) of sterling's relationship with the dollar (DM) since the mid-1970s. Additionally, these currency linkages are shown to have undergone a number of regime shifts, suggesting that the timing of the weakening of the dollar/sterling relationship is different to that proposed by previous studies.

The doses were equipotent, as indicated by reduction in exercise-induced tachycardia. The dose-response curves for cardiac output and heart rate can be divided into three groups according to the degree of intrinsic sympathomimetic activity. One group without intrinsic sympathomimetic activity included propranolol and atenolol, which reduced cardiac output (about 26% to 28%) and heart rate (about 15% to 17%). A second group with moderate intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, represented by practolol and BMMP, induced less reduction in cardiac output (about 12% to 17%) and heart rate (about 7% to 10%). A third group with pronounced intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, represented by pindolol and CPEP, did not reduce cardiac output and heart rate. Mean systemic blood pressure was essentially unchanged even after the largest dose of any of the drugs. Mean pulmonary artery pressure rose after atenolol, propranolol, and BMMP but not after pindolol, CPEP, and practolol. Atenolol, BMMP, and practolol are beta-1–selective drugs, it is concluded that the acute hemodynamic response to adrenergic beta receptor blocking drugs at rest is determined primarily by the degree of intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, whereas beta-1 selectivity did not modify the central hemodynamic responses to beta adrenoceptor blockade. \n \n \n \nClinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (1981) 29, 711–718; doi:10.1038/clpt.1981.100","inCitations":["90b90cbabd01f5ca6591a1292bc3f71c11878b88","94dcff1445b2401956603cdd52d12ee8057aadd6","2a198497073bfd2389a4d76620ad068c1e1b225e","53c84a53d89fdaefa1bcc6e993aa4dc5f46d7bc5","751998cecd72880ecd4d6f8556f2a083c6fe7552","346e14e9dfebf8ff73edd59272d062a872eb0d3f","205a9ab5e513e3e5593f0e314e2cf3693696e616","71d249136b65d528368a20edb67080774fc7d331","58589847e98cb4ae1ce2e04c98e9030ba7104ac7","7eb205ccf251f687281bee5dc2e41477e17ba014","680e1bc27362d517b8c9670bc23f9013ab427de4","e9199f21ccaec37507bc1d6c42c44348a07ed506","3055209f67b34c756093d3bd2ee7ffa503b9c2c3","085cf9f1d93dc58adc501c03da29cb895491bc85","f0862a30204758facab8de5f5cbcae54fb564307","2eb4873ad41593f282a290c320fea60f32a10c35","68d1165528121f436634f49a8456bcf312edb01b","cdf9e3622f10085c8c28f9e1e3ddfcf57b5bb65f","8e13cfded41e546717ab093740f67f40fe77851a","dce8b574c4904ad2edc4e155bafb1d7267ba1aff","2e1d696c91530dcbe12213908027e7bce5bf1a78","5633af3e94174b91b5b9837b2b497d493b91f7cb"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Adrenergic beta receptor blockade: hemodynamic importance of intrinsic sympathomimetic activity at rest.","doi":"10.1038/clpt.1981.100","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1038/clpt.1981.100","venue":"Clinical pharmacology and therapeutics"}

One of the two retina cell types performs irradiance detection and the other can perform color detection. Together, via the two parallel pathways the retina chip can perform color change intensity change disambiguation (CCICD). The irradiance detection cell has a wide-dynamic detection range that spans almost 3 orders of magnitude. The color detection cell has a buried double junction (BDJ) photodiode as the photoreceptor followed by two parallel logarithmic I-V convertors. The output from this is a color response which has at least a 50nm resolution for wavelengths from 400nm to 900nm. With these two cells, the array can perform color change -intensity change disambiguation (CCICD) to determine if a change in the output of the irradiance pathway is because of irradiance change, color change, or both. This biological retina-like neuromorphic sensor array is implemented in ON-SEMI 0.5μm technology, a standard CMOS fabrication process available at MOSIS.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Neuromorphic optical sensor chip with color change-intensity change disambiguation","doi":"10.1117/12.851044","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1117/12.851044","venue":"BiOS"}

Two weeks later, the intraperitoneal tumor growth and the tumor dissemination were evaluated semiquantitatively with a scoring system. The scores attributed to each organ were added to calculate the dissemination score of each animal.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe mean (+/-SD) dissemination score was 83.4+/-12 in the laparotomy group and 67.3+/-16 and 71.9+/-17 in the 4 and 10 mmHg CO2 pneumoperitoneum groups, respectively (P < .01). The scores for the peritoneum were 21.8+/-3.8 in the 10 mmHg pneumoperitoneum group and 18+/-2.4 in the laparotomy group (P < .01). In the laparotomy group, the implant found along the midline scar accounted for a mean of 62.6+/-15% of the peritoneal score, whereas the trocar site metastases did not influence the peritoneal score in the pneumoperitoneum groups. The incidence of wound metastasis was 96% in the laparotomy group and 55% and 54% in the 4 mmHg and 10 mmHg pneumoperitoneum groups, respectively.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nIn this model, tumor growth was greater after laparotomy than after laparoscopy, but peritoneal tumor dissemination was more severe after CO2 pneumoperitoneum.","inCitations":["d876518d0f1a5e9ad8efc9c01a3d4ffada0eb387","80bc13d47f94430646facf445ff7bc1fcadc7692","2ce0788c9ab5b4bf8bb36d018734093693b1add6","eb85aafe97afcf7cff20f5c5213eea462bfc3b1b","50a037e97a1e3152b9448a7824fe4b0a4da12341","7642882a10a017d154ff735018fb3db2ca94f183","070cbe76f6d1a89bc0923972b072ced66c9d93db","186a795aaafbfd89b7b7e591754481b4247cb314","9892378b6d5edca124e6a7c50596e0682ce31b98","c26ab60b86543f0bf1bc3e1a7cb06dbdf1d2813f","2a6039121a021100c7c8e0f04c5d6a9c35a15424","1c2337acd4d523c2016dbf9de64aa9bdcf786f66","893249f6721800ad9eba18dbe21a123b9bd166c4","8b5e90fcdae0bfb48956fe9a586e35c2a1b9a482","e9b24b5a069f040a2b8c048e825599461e127b92","504cb229b482462d430f05505f37effdd6da199d","693850a0585a77fe4a2e024e934e864680d5147f","45d23e57949f7806f218e01452564a9dfd31b8a5","fb20f17f8e7590ee8bc96da054b54ade9491b4b9","1750ca0ed36d74937fec06f40e3e27351e5c3564","1215e6652bc8a54f342b0c4fb36d2dde907ee3e4","e39a754edf7a1ed9e507d721b233ecb0d0f8829e","df77ffa6a615049e4835031d99c400320e236abc"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Tumor growth and dissemination after laparotomy and CO2 pneumoperitoneum: a rat ovarian cancer model.","doi":"10.1016/S0029-7844(98)00145-8","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/S0029-7844%2898%2900145-8","venue":"Obstetrics and gynecology"}

Early onset alcohol use is a strong predictor of future alcohol dependence. The study of the effects of excessive alcohol use on the human brain is hampered by limited information regarding the quantity and frequency of exposure to alcohol. Animal models can control for age at alcohol exposure onset and enable isolation of neural substrates of exposure to different patterns and quantities of ethanol (EtOH). As with humans, a frequently used binge exposure model is thought to produce dependence and affect predominantly corticolimbic brain regions. in vivo neuroimaging enables animals models to be examined longitudinally, allowing for each animal to serve as its own control. Accordingly, we conducted 3 magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sessions (baseline, binge, recovery) to track structure throughout the brains of wild type Wistar rats to test the hypothesis that binge EtOH exposure affects specific brain regions in addition to corticolimbic circuitry. Voxel-based comparisons of 13 EtOH- vs. 12 water- exposed animals identified significant thalamic shrinkage and lateral ventricular enlargement as occurring with EtOH exposure, but recovering with a week of abstinence. By contrast, pretectal nuclei and superior and inferior colliculi shrank in response to binge EtOH treatment but did not recover with abstinence. These results identify brainstem structures that have been relatively underreported but are relevant for localizing neurocircuitry relevant to the dynamic course of alcoholism.","inCitations":["b580669176f846ef16eaddda72adcafbee486bc0"],"pdfUrls":["https://fjfsdata01prod.blob.core.windows.net/articles/files/429715/pubmed-zip/.versions/1/.package-entries/fnana-12-00108/fnana-12-00108.pdf?rscd=attachment%3B+filename*%3DUTF-8''fnana-12-00108.pdf&se=2019-09-02T12:43:04Z&sig=kE9bml2FO639tMhofm/PvRestml/VAh1KYbPvDZu0Tw%3D&sp=r&sr=b&sv=2015-12-11"],"title":"Jacobian Maps Reveal Under-reported Brain Regions Sensitive to Extreme Binge Ethanol Intoxication in the Rat","doi":"10.3389/fnana.2018.00108","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.3389/fnana.2018.00108","venue":"Front.

The Endeavour voyage of circumnavigation in southern waters by James Cook and his naturalist Joseph Banks, which was initiated by the Society, had repercussions—far beyond its original astronomical purpose—in oceanography, biology, exploration and world politics. It left a tradition, which still continues in the Society, of promoting wide-ranging expeditions such as those of the Erebus and Terror, the Challenger and, more recently, those to the Great Barrier Reef, the Solomon Islands, the New Hebrides and the island of Aldabra. The sea areas covered are those lying between the South Polar Front and, approximately, the Equator. Small islands and inshore waters are included but not land-based expeditions, such as those to Southern Chile and the Matto Grosso. The contributions of both the Society and its Fellows acting individually have been numerous and varied but here attention is restricted to three interconnected topics: physical and geological oceanography, biogeography and the genesis of coral reefs.","inCitations":["bf5bbc87b46f3e25afa0f36b9f3ba49c030b875e"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"The Royal Society and the South Seas","doi":"10.1098/rsnr.2001.0127","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1098/rsnr.2001.0127","venue":"Notes and Records of the Royal Society of London"}

The Rovenstine Lecture was established in 1962 and today is the 45th commemorative lecture. I did not know Dr. Rovenstine, but I have read his writings. Let me sum him up as an extraordinary early leader in anesthesiology whose lifetime of service had an enormous impact on our specialty and does to this day. I hope you all understand the privilege it is to give a lecture in his honor. I realize that I stand between you and lunch—a dangerous place for anyone in front of anesthesiologists since lunch breaks are most unpredictable and always needed. Aware of this, I am reminded of a vignette reported by Alexander Heard, B.A., M.A., Ph.D. (Chancellor Emeritus, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tennessee) on the occasion of an annual “Dixie Dinner” in New York hosted by the Southern Society (made up of wellheeled but displaced Southerners in that big city) where “the speaker was introduced exactly at midnight and with great fanfare to give ‘his address’—(realizing the lateness of the hour) the honoree arose, gave his house number and street name in Princeton, NJ, and sat down.” You are not that fortunate. We (all who practice anesthesiology) are what we (those anesthesiologists who are in academia) make. Our academic departments have three missions: (1) education, (2) clinical service, and (3) research. We are especially proud of the excellent physicians we educate and the clinical care we provide. We must excel in these two, and we do. However, today I will focus on our research mission, something we do less well, and that needs transformation. In choosing this subject, I am aware of the admonition given by Rhodes in his wonderful book, The Creation of the Future: The Role of the American University: “little has changed in the century that has passed since Horace Mann declared that to disperse an angry mob, all that would be necessary would be to announce a lecture on education,” and I would add research to this. There are several reasons to focus on anesthesiology research: First, it is something that I have been committed to since the summer before I began medical school. Second, I think it is an area in which academic anesthesiology can and must do better. Third there has been a flurry of worry expressed in our journal, ANESTHESIOLOGY, and elsewhere of late. Finally, I have always been convinced that unless we question what we do and what we know through research, we will never improve by doing things new and better. The General Electric slogan of the 1960s, “Progress is our most important project,” has been and always will be my professional credo. It must be the motto of anesthesiology as well. The remainder of this lecture is in three parts: (1) the present status of research, (2) a root cause analysis of our research performance, and (3) a plan to improve the current state of our research.","inCitations":["f65151d05042d478799822eb93a2b4b693d28752","a4f120a873a2c4ed8432ff2e1f9348c325b00dc9","1c76bb9b0be48071a2be92b341074c523bedcd82","508acc1f0afb37c86bca638df9bed722a1bd3448","8b1df77ffda8f90bdb8bc853c04161dca63927b4","ab699db3edd5502da64726ff3a6d64b577e148a7","4d80dc77dfa587abe2da6ca06bc359e33415f09a","03371ede110b9b41680d08fe9352dd2d1e0ea79b","6e919c6bd36fce490dc185ab1dd72b3eb61c4356","61953705814bae63b480efa511ff1d0a7383f125","61d26d1c3b1ad365c81464a70f8d8e5514300192","70faf4494e33dcf0a7a27579a8d8346698cfe26c","d2c1d0135cb9e39c16ff98780a003a356a2579a8","df830cb2f2952ab442bbb0ccf40948d3958d211f","25c4c47efb415c7ca2f3eb45f60e8e4848982741","99a88584a3cdc0e74699fb000f4300ebbad0c3a4","d66e1b809b4e09117a5ee4a7da24f8a9f98d6a5a","37d33a0870a9b3c266adfcb8727e24c7e6aa721f","31d9ad9abc1fd2d7fcd94d324cd322816419e61a","a34d6b2f15b97f38e33c15a46578b1fd9f03e986","2f787f80532f9576fe90c864e4e6a25e0625ce47","365a2d9f2458048aef1522c6deadae10fb94dde8","69d7315da46a00803ecd1a5c78642b6ff7c345bd","d7051941c33bce1e575bb3c2e8618503d613ca25","2625dcce4834713efa939fec3710d74b48bcd00a","c918fb90c514b080de420dfc4fb46459ac50535c","5923127acd04fdcfd2de0d397e3ef6a083df0010","767a9c5731d740fcb97b03f80e6a2a53c84aeb3f","e178af4c39b03e7c1dae681e22f90f321b1c3788","b3e11b690c70e7a97d512121b296c157008cf912","2965207876fc77a69dd0e4d9338ea26f1cb49ee5","bdc20a55fdb9735540773c7294004d6b317d8e44","211048f282f56981096f2faba9da13a3c86f54b0"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"We are what we make: transforming research in anesthesiology: the 45th Rovenstine Lecture.","doi":"10.1097/01.anes.0000264772.71791.58","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1097/01.anes.0000264772.71791.58","venue":"Anesthesiology"}

This study investigated the spatio-temporal dynamics of Inner Mongolia grassland, the main grassland region in China and part of the Eurasia Steppe, to detect the interactive nature of climate, ecosystems and society. Land-use and landscape patterns for the period from 1985 to 2009 were analysed based on TM- and MODIS-derived land-use data. Net Primary Productivity (NPP) estimated by using the Carnegie-Ames-Stanford Approach model was used to assess the growth status of grassland. Furthermore, the factors related to the dynamics of grassland were analysed from the perspectives of two driving factors, climate change and human activities. The results indicated that higher temperatures and lower precipitation may generally have contributed to grassland desertification, particularly in arid regions. During the period from 1985 to 2000, a higher human population and an increase in livestock numbers were the major driving forces responsible for the consistent decrease in NPP and a relatively fragmented landscape. From 2000 to 2009, the implementation of effective ecological restoration projects has arrested the grassland deterioration in some ecologically fragile regions. However, a rapid growth of livestock numbers has sparked new degradation onnon-degraded or lightly degraded grassland, which was initially neglected by these projects. In spite of some achievement in grassland restoration, China should take further steps to develop sustainable management practices for climate adaptation and economic development to bring lasting benefits.","inCitations":["3df088a9011c533ad12c4e80ab372c48ffa2df6e","ba112696c1cb20e2b1b0221cd976ea2b2fd74bbd","a1688ca751aa15b7f46365ae3dbc202f6c8e09a5","bf7e8ac2c553ed1896c55c7d6c6f8feaec0392c4","349ac978014de40802964679c7874655c1cc6f23","d228fbb6f59f11f6fac9dd5c40748d9b84d8623c","bd7963175f56d2dafc5736c4f07dc87493bbae77","5de86e82236d56a2c1ab5805d3af537e8c23157c","cba634aaee0c86635bc6f0e2415f5178ccdd559c","0c86a7aa25ce85a7c8509d68063d9f9730315d0b","7e3f718b56faef4d645f41f56e7a79fbdad2f593"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Grassland dynamics in response to climate change and human activities in Inner Mongolia, China between 1985 and 2009","doi":"10.1071/RJ12042","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1071/RJ12042","venue":""}

The results showed that reading comprehension among Estonian and Finnish children was at a similar level by the end of first grade but Finnish children started to have better performance from second grade onward. These findings suggest that the roots of Finnish students’ strong reading skills are nurtured from the very beginning of elementary school.

Additionally, 22 accessions with various Lr genes from two germplasm collections were tested. A Scar (sequence-characterized amplified region) marker for Lr24 and a CAPS (Cleaved Amplified Polymorphic Sequence) marker for Lr47 were also used to identify those genes in the wheat accessions. Each marker amplified one specific DNA fragment. Three Lr gene markers were identified in wheat cultivars (Lr10, Lr26 and Lr37). Another four markers (Lr9, Lr19, Lr24 and Lr47) were found in breeding lines carrying leaf rust resistance genes. The results were compared with leaf rust resistance gene postulations made in previous studies, based on multipathotype testing. Markers for Lr10, Lr26 and Lr37 may be useful in marker-assisted breeding.","inCitations":["a26d4b98c96d84df3ea83bde8cb6fc232659a692","dcb548335d1835a801cb54cc2e14e65db1476e34","34032fe73c4a288af454206e1b61e1e2305d299a","467576430994e9805607892f8068905fb3d18190","6a8f697490420bf8400a7d6a94e7cc3774e48abc","b1a46da3b542d0e1fa8850f7767eafe6caa6a853","1f4d86c0b3345ad42f50b30543f2291df076551a","ebc2aac3f1e56b19f2192e58ca5984c9c9442f05","192ef403badae832d8c3459b2ccd878201c34171","7e403f9dfe7676b1cd3b2329af605e733a54746a","ead3dcbcc60bfa6828d181b93abc98f1a28b8145","fe94b0020309e13433bf12fa51dfc1b35607bce4","81f81e28d792cd7fbb5bc3278ef642d911a966cf","e9d78b53ac7fc6516405caa5798e492ad2e9d652","75dd2d20ea1287f9a42f6194798de2e394642c42","f7bc46c899898f31defcd021c7e396846032c54d","7528c292c8b291fae9bacaeeeb4ee43fc3e2b46c","aaa0545c5759f08ec04c6be401c3279035520712","90707aa41c512251844f425c6c7ccc195bcfaac1","578c933658147a355c6745e93a12c96319e4d789","9627a137296529cee79a7fdaf5745d2cda5d8445","6c21aa37ff97cf4d7216e1c1a442518fa9d30ba2","711458fa3fd840b19319ffa4281d93edef5cb590","e075f06cfc242a4abb20fdd450a0a2fdb5488df1"],"pdfUrls":["http://jag.igr.poznan.pl/2003-Volume-44/2/pdf/2003_Volume_44_2-139-149.pdf"],"title":"Leaf rust resistance genes of wheat: identification in cultivars and resistance sources.","doi":"","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"Journal of applied genetics"}
