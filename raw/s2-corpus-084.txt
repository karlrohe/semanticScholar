Repository material now evolves on the fly. The approach provides a granular source control to embrace also materials that authors would not publish as open source. We describe both the technical content management and educational setups for live graphics gems.

This notion is largely based on cross-sectional comparisons of athletes using echocardiography. In this study, young (27.4 ± 1.1 years) untrained subjects were randomly assigned to supervised, intensive, endurance (END, n = 10) or resistance (RES, n = 13) exercise and cardiac MRI scans and myocardial speckle tracking echocardiography were performed at baseline, after 6 months of training and after a subsequent 6 weeks of detraining. Aerobic fitness increased significantly in END (3.5 to 3.8 l min(-1), P < 0.05) but was unchanged in RES. Muscular strength significantly improved compared to baseline in both RES and END ( = 53.0 ± 1.1 versus 36.4 ± 4.5 kg, both P < 0.001) as did lean body mass (2.3 ± 0.4 kg, P < 0.001 versus 1.4 ± 0.6 kg P < 0.05). MRI derived left ventricular (LV) mass increased significantly following END (112.5 ± 7.3 to 121.8 ± 6.6 g, P < 0.01) but not RES, whilst training increased end-diastolic volume (LVEDV, END: +9.0 ± 5.0 versus RES +3.1 ± 3.6 ml, P = 0.05). Interventricular wall thickness significantly increased with training in END (1.06 ± 0.0 to 1.14 ± 0.06, P < 0.05) but not RES. Longitudinal strain and strain rates did not change following exercise training. Detraining reduced aerobic fitness, LV mass and wall thickness in END (P < 0.05), whereas LVEDV remained elevated. This study is the first to use MRI to compare LV adaptation in response to intensive supervised endurance and resistance training. Our findings provide some support for the 'Morganroth hypothesis', as it pertains to LV remodelling in response to endurance training, but cast some doubt over the proposal that remodelling occurs in response to resistance training.","inCitations":["3a450292423005bbd229221fc5ec018b06a72002","74fcd8158b5943397bbc4bf39e3b4d1e2352b98e","71d32d7032de97ecbe4406322291a9ee616870b2","1306a16e75447ab1fe28228deaceb6a18ae42493","9c0ab35e988ff9671504712d5e34d2bda014ece9","f7cbe530e1cf29d36afec5c2f59dc8b1a14d4749","dfa31240c07cd80f7d92c25e32534c018ae02c10","4beddab18621dc65e50b7fddce4ac5eac08e07d7","a0dc68f9d421b0623325c05a13005079bf240498","b12e425f0906ad144d6416490b11272718b50092","8188f164edf37b1474b236887a79450f07557e85","f053803f7d020df55a07423080547c2b736021e2","760612d1bf0ac375e3f5cd944c486d2741a61ce7","b76e3b68e688e02738b2ef360921286ed40eeb11","f6005869b27ea2d8bb24acf303316418e903297f","3a1711338bfe84692e382255a2ed898e990ada44","19f03886a91f89d315ed6379df105b051a9c3bd4","273d990dc5a6de79813dc06401adfc4782acf32c","f72338c9a1a8efca45eb157d1b0afeed87943593","089f7aeedf7515df7a262ba37905f95346652639","601db80f9a0f22cfcd8042f8c30ad731083037f4","87b975852ffcab584fd688cf28884e5607f99145","706c83c77ebe1bbb0ed2a825aae666267e6665f0","a00e9d0a48fed1149bffcaef1dd832ee14e9d8d6","a4f54f0a86b90417906d337b64cbcb5aef9b6480","5846dc3e00837be7b687210c36806f4698e47d53","fe3676c708fc43b20275b5ff7415c8f8e5589b7e","95fce205f38149ca9e16ecec0b34a47280e4ca81","5f5d8cdb94dae4e465fb54c9a7067d6c1c487713","df38268ad90f7e6698b684e23305c848e720e7c0","84949b9c0c5b7c101519e1d450edeb1122684b0d","458f58503d8c604f7ce0baee5013c029778fbf8c","f4b6fa5388f17e6f6707355c30605bc2b99c1d3e","917d9f4714b723b740fc3264676c9d4c92491fba","f728d3dfbd83fd2a65134fcb6ce58131d629bbbd","f131b5da4717abb6b70b26bf28061b65b405269d","11e622108602d60a6e67d9c0229a96ab6f3bcf15","90746c4c6bac77abf32eb6dc661dfefe6095b5f7","277617d35092e9ae7d012b979968c1d0e6e8a9c6","b1c5395ff67098c4857e8a0ed44b39b5de5ad6b6","abbed8a9e4ed3fea24e5130a2c4e9901eb115f85","2a3a6b3268807bace8b27ba499145db8c9addebb","bb6839e96958c461cd9eec5de2bd7181e858ef04","9e505149e5df642de0b82cc1049f832790550db9","bf5771e0a47ceddc9be279379944501e6b752272","61d63f823cd551c54d4dd024f2973532f875a8e7","9ccfc9b7411368cf699e1e9419a6c020313a7c58","34526258a5948fa448e697cd4d7aa041ba67fde2","6bf7d93f6104acfbf4609475417770e290cdd954","3542007fa944f36be6077adfa7666edf0bd3d679","e299caa69a30f3e988a0a59f20082896b1fcebc7","e77bdb2e4fc6ed1065f8f71c7afa4ad651a22963","cca9d48518006ce408256a64c02cc1000e2ff4b9","b4d84f0b127e5834dc45a729714a44af443a89ca","6366d841d922763e92c9b717993224b9f7965d1d","74af31360130b670bb61cab923296e5d45576250","f2698282738182a8fdd4535bf53a539020b1a453","8477f26c7b5a0be701aaa781cbf5cb548169dd80","6ad72f339f2ffbbd8b0a6ab66aa924a51c777131","95820203b3451f3edf5c6b3090a0a275e0050655","171ff48606d3d2bdd223cea88ec330b80a0e7621","3324aa7f0cde66ccb9e40ad045a8c400b1ff0a57","8b82260b72979c40e59d734c9bee111e443ccedc","49c394149f0d2cd1d587f6dace4bf8f6b9de097c","58a6541638fba81c0c35cc697ba3ffa986092e6c","24def43a457140062d1109456b9b957168e4c855","f8fae753453962a7a4405b493b0627a29761632f","11ce3aa6869edc412c98676a5ada97086d9b8ce0","c78445c6802fec5f5d2faf2812a0546fc2f39115","25931c361c0b05dd659a7bdbacdb035016934f2c","4f18db57fa5c9deb1f1fafa956f1ad47b8d00faf","1129027a1dc45967f09ac1f218ddb60d3ecd020d","8879e6657d358666fedac35cf071ae3397c740a4","86ca23d383d2c7d0537c366809257fc9dcc12238","0dd38110c6858cb05831f61c4c043fe7e38c17a4","512648f5cc0fe626a3253eed98df34d6ad910b89","9f52059bf5a2f4b0c3087f83a44a30748666445a","708dbbd7ab1f4b775100d53e3853a615818b54ab","ad43e0589d19bcf07f654531be200ca9cca3f98f","a81591eb7d76d172db5a935ed36e796f10ac74c7","af18aa9076126b4e8d0900acec31f334fbce92f3","9d4c4f025a8d3862466bbf17c37f65cd3cfbc780","99f919a766311f380ecd2753117ed0734d221c0a","d9c92b453f87590a076bf0ae5805414cb1a795e1","49d340eddeadb9533ed9fb7a3b3baff7962877a3","4b64c8ebfbfb9204a3d0597ab3e1b21820309d0d"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"A prospective randomised longitudinal MRI study of left ventricular adaptation to endurance and resistance exercise training in humans.","doi":"10.1113/jphysiol.2011.217125","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1113/jphysiol.2011.217125","venue":"The Journal of physiology"}

Three major and five minor adducts were detected in assays of DNA digests obtained from Salmonella typhimurium TA98 cells after treatment with IQ and rat liver postmitochondrial supernatant (S9). A qualitatively identical adduct pattern was obtained with nitro-IQ (3-methyl-2-nitroimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline), a new analogue of IQ with a nitro instead of the amino group. These two compounds, therefore, form the same ultimate metabolite. The same adduct pattern was also found after TA98/1,8-DNP6 (acetyltransferase-deficient) cells were treated with nitro-IQ; this is probably due to a residual acetyltransferase activity in this strain. Upon treatment of TA98 cells with 1 mM IQ for 3 h one adduct was detected in 4.7 x 10(5) total bases; a considerably higher adduct frequency, one in 4.2 x 10(3), was induced by nitro-IQ (70 microM, 30 min). The IQ isomer 2-amino-1-methylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline (isoIQ) and its nitro-analogue nitro-isoIQ (1-methyl-2-nitroimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline) also produced identical adducts. Their common adduct pattern was very similar to the IQ adduct pattern but was located in a position different from that of the IQ adduct pattern. DNA from Syrian hamster embryo (SHE) cells treated with IQ and S9 exhibited adducts apparently identical with those of Salmonella DNA.","inCitations":["a5a2418d3ea09c6359e20a7e7e1543dcd405808a","e26d7125221d3bed70e9c34c5ce98815f93fa1a8","409f16ce0315b4c4fe8713353663dd044e7dea38","c7ae60152197fa5748cf522efb38050e66c83797","b63ea5fad960fc2e2a5bdec27a8f4bcea71c12f6","040422bd7725ec8c88a797528dd7490447bc1a77","7298698869a34fd7ff1c85c560653cf6abceac02","933c89ed5c05cd390b1501f70db287e1c92f1c21","24c87bdf1ee6ef2e03438b38f352db77b62b9489","ecf3f4820fef469bfabde3dff0be844f1abab002","6786373d7d93f38114e042d7b7b9715c57f3f468"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Heterocyclic aromatic amine-DNA-adducts in bacteria and mammalian cells detected by 32P-postlabeling analysis.","doi":"10.1093/carcin/8.11.1589","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1093/carcin%2F8.11.1589","venue":"Carcinogenesis"}

It shows how choices by individual firms affect compatibility among products. Incompatibility, the coexistence of different technical standards for a basic product, limits the availability of complementary products and repair services. The resulting negative impact of incompatibility on consumers (and market demand) is partially mitigated by several factors, including the availability of low-cost translator devices and the value placed on unique product characteristics lost under standardization. Short case studies illustrate how compatibility can be affected by private and collective decision-making.

It examines a number of theoretical trends in anthropology concerning art production, perception, and circulation. Art objects are considered live social beings whose aesthetic value, significance, and emotional efficacy are subject to change in the course of their mobility through time and space. This paper looks at how artworks are incorporated into discourses of empowerment and advocacy, set against the emergence, growth, and intensification of networks of social relations between institutions and individuals, in a particular society and cross-culturally. It is argued that people's engagement with artworks is reinforced by the social parameters of transactional artistic fields of visual representation. Previous knowledge about the meaning and status of an artwork induces particular interpretations and influences the aesthetic experience. Case studies from the colonial Gold Coast and contemporary Ghana discussed here demonstrate that artistic subjectivity is entangled with aesthetic and other culture-specific ideologies within a sensorial sphere of knowledge and experience. This discussion highlights the theoretical implications of a processual relativist view of the performative life of the art object for the anthropological study of art.

Transmittance analyses at two levels were performed on the secondary mirror support towers. Detailed transmittances were accomplished by the use of the CODE V optical design/analysis program and were compared to a quick approximation method that required only tracing four rays. A way to obtain simple, very quick approximate transmittances without raytrace also developed by the same author, is laid out. Point spread function (PSF) calculations, including both diffraction and aberration effects, were performed on CODE V. PSF contours can be delineated on CODE V down to about 10-8 times the peak intensity, fine detailing the differences in the wings of the PSF. As one goes out from the center of the blur (for a point source), two types of support towers showed little difference between their PSF intensities until one reaches about the 3% level. Between the first type of tower and the hexapod tower below 3% of the peak intensity, the PSF contour maps well delineated significant differences in the outer portions of the PSFs. The hexapod tower provided the best PSF. Such differences in the wings of the PSF significantly impact the resolution of brown dwarfs or extra solar planets from their star.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Analysis of a conical and a hexapod secondary mirror support tower for the Next-Generation Space Telescope (NGST)","doi":"10.1117/12.367618","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1117/12.367618","venue":"Optics & Photonics"}

There is relatively little data, however, on the use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in this context.Methods24 week, double-blind placebo controlled study. 31 participants presenting immediately after trauma, and meeting diagnostic criteria for full or partial acute stress disorder were randomized to treatment with 10–20 mg of escitalopram or placebo daily for 24 weeks. 2 participants were excluded from the analysis due to early drop out, leaving 29 participants (escitalopram = 12, placebo = 17) for inclusion in an intent- to- treat analysis. Participants were followed up until 56 weeks, and assessed with the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS). A mixed model repeated measures analysis of variance (RMANOVA) was undertaken to determine the efficacy of the intervention on the CAPS score.ResultsThere was a significant reduction in CAPS score over the course of treatment (F(7, 142) = 41. 58, p < 0.001) in both the escitalopram and placebo groups, with a greater reduction in CAPS score in the placebo group F(7, 142) = 2.12, p = 0.045. There were improvements on all secondary measures, including the Clinical Global Impressions scale, and scales assessing depression, anxiety and disability. Only functional disability outcomes (F(7, 141) = 2.13, p = .04), were significantly different between treatment and placebo groups. In the sample as a whole, improvement in scores were maintained at the 52 week follow-up. Side effects were comparable between the groups.ConclusionsThese data are consistent with other recent work indicating that the SSRIs may not be efficacious in the prevention of PTSD. Nevertheless, the small sample size and baseline differences between groups limit the explanatory power of the study. Although a consideration of the possibility of medication prophylaxis in PTSD remains important, both from conceptual and clinical perspectives, caution is needed with regards to the use of SSRIs until their efficacy can be proven.Trial registrationClinical Trials NCT00300313","inCitations":["732438e0fd281d5466a7387fa6623470cee2257c","2a5c8d397b961f438a7f4c552d49bf2f58866190","489309699c5b5f6933d40eef926d3edb61abb806","e94e0ee5b766e41f35234a32737ef8a935da0513","036f808fa2e9e35d897dad43c4ed6ffef766d117","a59a1959a05ba0591b0d6a34ad1892f30a942e91","c290242c78180835138947bdaa6f68943d73e8d8","c57f29ab4181294d4ce675cfaaaaf02cb162745a","ba174cf56de1a51f3a894395832d9901a1972608","b9de7a204f288b6d2d6647e3c78273ebd51ac5f4","8c95989635cf60cce9a2dcab5216c5efa4a5b28c","198748a8a2ab90aaf454817fd5c50cd1458f5a62","c6ca0804038086c7b2df0ffe16b7a984013d87ea","f653b554bba086a9cc588a21ba8a0b8328924466"],"pdfUrls":["http://bmcpsychiatry.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s12888-015-0391-3?site=bmcpsychiatry.biomedcentral.com","https://scholar.sun.ac.za/bitstream/handle/10019.1/99791/suliman_escitalopram_2015.pdf?isAllowed=y&sequence=1","https://open.uct.ac.za/bitstream/handle/11427/12548/Suliman_Escitalopram_PSD_trial_2015.pdf?sequence=1","https://scholar.sun.ac.za/bitstream/handle/10019.1/97571/suliman_escitalopram_2015.pdf?isAllowed=y&sequence=1"],"title":"Escitalopram in the prevention of posttraumatic stress disorder: a pilot randomized controlled trial","doi":"10.1186/s12888-015-0391-3","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12888-015-0391-3","venue":"BMC Psychiatry"}

METHODS: During two years, 110 patients with consecutive hospitalizations suffering from systemic lupus erythematosus, according to the American College of Rheumatology criteria, were evaluated for moderate and severe NPM. The following parameters were studied in these patients: cause of admission, presence of auto-antibodies, cerebral spinal fluid, radiological imaging, retrospective study of medical records and treatment. RESULTS: The prevalence of NPM was 16.4% (18/110), being seventeen women and one man; the mean age was 29 years; during the hospitalization term, only 33% (6/18) of the patients had an NPM. The occurrence of the first NPM was in 11% (2/18) of the cases before diagnosis, in 33% (6/18) during diagnosis and in 56% (10/18) after diagnosis. The mortality rate was 11% (2/18). The most common NPM's were: seizures and headache (50%), psychosis (22%), cerebrovascular disease (17%), syncope and major depression (11%). Treatment outcome: 28% (5/18) of the patients responded to oral corticoids, 17% (3/18) had a pulse of methylprednisolone and 56% (10/18) were treated with cyclophosphamide. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of NPM in the patients of this study was on the lowest limit reported by the related literature. With no controlled clinical trials, the approach to these patients is based on case reports and the professional experience of the service.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Análise de prevalência e evolução das manifestações neuropsiquiátricas moderadas e graves em pacientes com lúpus eritematoso sistêmico internados no serviço de reumatologia do Hospital Geral de Fortaleza","doi":"10.1590/S0482-50042008000300003","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1590/S0482-50042008000300003","venue":""}

Alternatively, ovulation patterns have been linked to factors such as phylogeny, social system and ecological constraints but no conclusive pattern has emerged. African mole-rats exhibit a unique range of social organizations and experience diverse ecological conditions (i.e. rainfall patterns), with various species exhibiting either induced or spontaneous ovulation in addition to a corresponding variation of penile ornamentation. Investigations of members of this family conducted so far do not allow conclusions to be drawn about the importance of phylogenetic versus ecological constraints for the evolution of ovulation patterns because all species of the genus Cryptomys studied occur in mesic habitats and exhibit induced ovulation. In contrast, the one representative of the genus Fukomys is a spontaneous ovulator that occurs in arid habitats. The current study aimed to elucidate the factors creating the observed ovulation pattern by using a species within a genus for which so far only spontaneous ovulation has been recorded, but unlike the other species with known ovulation mechanisms of this genus, it occurs in a mesic environment. Previously, non-reproductive Ansell's mole-rat Fukomys anselli females were housed individually for a period of 6 weeks before being housed either alone, in chemical or physical contact with a male. Progesterone profiles generated from urine samples collected throughout the study did not differ significantly either before or after the pairing or between the experimental groups, suggesting that they ovulate spontaneously. This was supported by the lack of penile ornamentation found in males of this species. The results suggest that phylogenetic rather than ecological constraints determine the ovulation patterns observed in social bathyergids.","inCitations":["d326ffbd9c3b1efcc4a0b36e75482d676252179b","ad13333bb416719175d37facc8b1d67a1fb79891","714a67fd6a94a7a8439196076fbe3c6092cd908b","1b9428bd685e862e8631950bb690eba3d71a35e3"],"pdfUrls":["https://repository.up.ac.za/bitstream/handle/2263/15555/Bennett_Pattern(2010).PDF;sequence=1"],"title":"The pattern of ovulation in Ansell’s mole-rat, Fukomys anselli : phylogenetic or ecological constraints?","doi":"10.1111/j.1469-7998.2009.00685.x","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-7998.2009.00685.x","venue":""}

[82] The 'h index is calculated based on the distribution of citations that an investigator's scientific work has received for life. Hirsch specifically says: A scientist has an index h if the h of his Np works receives at least h appointments each, and the others (Np - h) works have at most h appointments each. In other words, a scientist has an index h if he has published h works with at least h citations each [82]. Different online programs are available on the Internet to calculate the said h index, as well as other indicators, eg. Publish or Perish R. (http://www.harzing.com/pop.htm). It is even more important to know what is the H index of references in national and international research.

Two ceramics are studied: silicon carbide (SiC, hexagonal crystal structure) and aluminum oxynitride (AlON, cubic crystal structure). Three dimensional finite element simulations incorporate nonlinear anisotropic elasticity for behavior of single crystals within polycrystalline aggregates, cohesive zone models for intergranular fracture, and contact interactions among fractured interfaces. Boundary conditions considered include uniaxial strain compression, uniaxial stress compression, and shear with varying confinement, all at high loading rates. Results for both materials demonstrate shear-induced dilatation and increasing shear strength with increasing confining pressure. Failure statistics for unconfined loading exhibit a smaller Weibull modulus (corresponding to greater scatter in peak failure strength) in AlON than in SiC, likely a result of lower prescribed cohesive fracture strength and greater elastic anisotropy in the former. In both materials, the predicted Weibull modulus tends to decrease with an increasing number of grains contained in the simulated microstructure.","inCitations":["3e17ddf2be4255498c8a315d0de39a79482dc792","09363e717d2904fd9340c5d1ef4ac1eb445ef82c","a3ca614a8289dd7788e28b5aa943a08846edd61b","6a80641bc785912eba5092c780f5da2d2c03420b","f5ae9375407ee7aa5b8f3a824d4c84d1e7969882","110131c9c4db03ad784e7c42090712da1f552117","ce3eb387d02bec92d0dcb42b659f770c338fd034","2e380920e5f8c35f075c9d9f77bcb9df1f671d8e","f01a3f556f87aeae086881cbd7007f40a3d04d15","e03f3a063ce3ca76a737338099b6a7cd08f026ef","ad53b24ad4ecb8b6143758b48f4bfce57c3bd15f","db629ae1e9f29bda49214bce043925f354dbb70f","1e2eea2e80b70080dc35b92d31be2485cdaf5c8f","100003bb307ab20868fccc7faef957e6104b6464","d920c38fda862cc0dab81b6e933d9f5f3d1d5e84","997d70b03b1697defc7a85c9173bbb63c65a013d","1d12416c7050b9db3cf311a7829aa655acb13caa","4651c650a9868d377ce3d985ede13bf9cd66d8d8","bac183e3802b0800617fde52bb6d5b205ff8b354","27acfe6f99da90d09921810db02aaec610f5a652","b3483b71b146f3b3153e3a85a5c792a11f2684f9","a8fc465f2d8395456bdfd0bcf54b781e9dec14de","5af9cd52b229603176e18dd7c9aabf3cc2c03f6e","8cd2bb040ee5fc616e3864675cf7391ac6c5cee2"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a567900.pdf","http://www.arl.army.mil/arlreports/2012/ARL-RP-386.pdf"],"title":"Mesoscale Modeling of Nonlinear Elasticity and Fracture in Ceramic Polycrystals Under Dynamic Shear and Compression","doi":"10.1016/j.ijsolstr.2012.05.035","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijsolstr.2012.05.035","venue":""}

A key element in these systems is the ability of noise and fluctuation to work as a stochastic search process that is able to explore a solution space and settle on a suitable solution. The attraction of this strategy is that it simplifies the mechanisms required to accomplish a task.

Recently, safety concerns have arisen regarding the continued application of transdermal patches during magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) procedures. Case reports have revealed that serious burns may occur in patients undergoing MRI who have transdermal patches with metallic content applied to their skin. The metallic component of these patches acts as a conductor for the radiofrequency pulses of the MRI, inducing an electric current and thereby resulting in intense heat and burns. Currently, over 20 brand and generic transdermal drug delivery systems are available. Not all available patches contain metallic components that necessitate removal prior to MRI. This review provides information related to the metallic content of available transdermal patches and also provides recommendations regarding reapplication of transdermal therapy after a scan. Health care professionals should be aware that published information regarding transdermal therapy and risk of burns appears to vary from source to source as the primary reference for such information is verbal communication with manufacturers. Given this issue, it may be often easier to err on the side of caution and remove the patch prior to MRI.","inCitations":["a79e706c68ae0a0b5d8a665b74645eae3019d37e","c105b52c11088b66a6429a21f272094d7b42d609","6545c390d668815fc997dd5a73c3b704169138cb","ac48d27fd897192abc09c22d47a832627c0ecae0","383bd0ebf7ad7ac0622d9ac99084dd6dbac38c44"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Safety Concerns Involving Transdermal Patches and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)","doi":"10.1310/hpj4510-771","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1310/hpj4510-771","venue":""}

Therefore, these studies were initiated to characterize the cytochrome P-450-dependent metabolism of LTB4 in other tissues. LTB4 was metabolized by rat hepatic microsomes to two products, 20-hydroxy(omega)-LTB4 and 19-hydroxy(omega-1)-LTB4. The formation of these metabolites was both oxygen and NADPH dependent indicating that a monooxygenase(s) was responsible for these reactions. The apparent Km and Vmax for LTB4 omega-hydroxylase were 40.28 microM and 1202 pmol/min/mg of protein, respectively. In contrast, the apparent Km and Vmax for LTB4 (omega-1)-hydroxylase were 61.52 microM and 73.50 pmol/min/mg of protein, respectively. Both LTB4 omega- and (omega-1)-hydroxylases were inhibited by metyrapone in a concentration-dependent fashion. However, SK&F 525A inhibited LTB4 (omega-1)- but not omega-hydroxylase. In contrast, alpha-naphthoflavone decreased LTB4 omega- but not (omega-1)-hydroxylase activities. The differences in the Km apparent for substrate as well as the differential inhibition by inhibitors of cytochrome P-450 suggest that the omega- and (omega-1)-hydroxylations of LTB4 in hepatic microsomes are mediated by different isozymes of P-450. Furthermore, several additional characteristics of LTB4 hydroxylases indicate that these isozymes of P-450 may be different from those which catalyze similar reactions on medium-chain fatty acids, such as laurate and prostaglandins.","inCitations":["9d0fc42ec88fb30a3efee0614f566d2afaf74691","8e723f4d5d98f2fda4f6c2a31830387f5172177b","2675e18ab95010a5624bf26a02a0121a5c4f3c6c","a7ef1a3727eaa828f3db74b6326481a9e2ff6170","7b573f576f28cfe31282a0f68f435c4ef766b471","3c445f84baf516a2465c056a79c2bb6a5f7af120"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Biochemical characterization of hepatic microsomal leukotriene B4 hydroxylases.","doi":"","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"The Journal of biological chemistry"}

In the considered control architecture, the turn-on switching event is determined asynchronously by comparing the converter output voltage with a synchronously generated voltage ramp driven by the digital control using a low-resolution digital-to-analog converter (DAC). Switch turn-off is determined synchronously by the system clock. In this work, the system has been provided with a pulse width modulator which performs a limited pool random carrier-frequency modulation; this provision ensures low EMI emission and simple hardware implementation without affecting the quality of the output voltage regulation.

Parametros hematologicos de sangre perifericas de animales afectados naturalmente mostraron una clara linfopenia (2.66±1.36 x 10.3 mL-1, p<0.05) y neutrofilia (7.96±3.84 x 103 mL-1, p<0.05)comparado con animales controles (n=6). La linfopenia periferica en estos animales se caracterizo por una reduccion significativa en el numero y proporciones de linfocitos TCD5+ y CD4+, observandose paralelamente un incremento significativo en las proporciones de celulas CD8+ y linfocitos B (CD45RA+ y sIgG+).

Los animales clinicamente enfermos mostraron alteraciones en la relacion CD4+/CD8+ circulante, disminuyendo desde 3.9 en animales no afectados con APO a 1.4 en animales afectados con APO.

Because the real glow discharges with a positive column are always two-dimensional, the transversal (radial) term in divergence with the electric field can provide a non-monotonic axial profile of charge density in the plasma, while maintaining a positive sign.

The thermo-hydro-mechanical processes can have a strong effect on the behaviour of interfaces between unsaturated soils and piles. Temperature changes lead to water movement in the soil. The moisture loss or gain in the soil causes drying or wetting. In addition, water movement influences the heat transfer properties of the soil. Temperature and moisture content changes affect the magnitude of soil suction in unsaturated soils. Changes in soil suction alter the strength and deformation characteristics of the soil mass and soil-structure interfaces. Similar to the effects of temperature changes, the mechanical loading and the changes in hydraulic conditions in the ground would cause changes in the void ratio, degree of saturation, suction, strength and deformation characteristics of soil. The interface behaviour under varying thermo-hydro-mechanical (THM) conditions is classified as a coupled problem and this is the subject of the present research. In the present investigation, laboratory studies and numerical analyses are carried out to evaluate the THM effect on the behaviour of interfaces between an energy pile material and an unsaturated soil. A 3D interface apparatus (Fakharian and Evgin 1996) has been modified (Fu et al. 2013) to allow the behaviour of an interface to be studied under thermo-mechanical loading conditions. In the present study, the experiments are conducted on soil samples with low degree of saturation and high degree of saturation. It is found that in interface tests using soil samples with low degree of saturation, the adhesion increased due to a positive effect of suction on strength than the negative effect of increasing temperatures. However, in interface tests on soil samples with high degree of saturation, the adhesion decreased with increasing temperatures while the positive effect of suction was not large enough to overcome the negative effect of increasing temperatures. This is a new finding that has not been reported anywhere in the literature. The friction angle for both soil samples (with different degrees of saturation) changed slightly with temperature change. Coupled finite element analyses conducted in the present study provide the following geotechnical information that would be useful for the design of energy piles: (a) Bearing capacity of the pile with and without the effect of temperature, (b) The effect of degree of saturation (or suction) on the strength and deformation characteristics of both the soil and the soil-structure interface, (c) Temperature effects on the amount of pile head movements (up or down), (d) Temperature induced stresses in the pile, (f) Amount of heat that can be stored or extracted from the ground as a function of time. At the initial stages of this study, THM effects on the behaviour of energy piles under saturated and unsaturated conditions are analyzed by using SIGMA/W and VADOSE/W finite element codes of GeoStudio 2012. Although these codes are not multi-physics FE codes, it is possible to use them sequentially to obtain results that will show the trends in pile behaviour. This numerical approach is used first to analyze the behaviour of an energy pile installed partially in unsaturated soil. The moisture content and temperature distributions around a 10 m long, bored pile are calculated using transient analyses. Changes taking place in the stress state along the pile shaft and the bearing capacity of the pile at different temperatures are calculated. In the second part of the numerical analysis of the present study, THM effects on the behaviour of energy piles under saturated and unsaturated conditions are analyzed by using PLAXIS 2D finite element code. PLAXIS is a fully couples finite element code. In order to enhance present understanding of the behaviour of energy piles and do the analysis correctly, a fully coupled analysis involving thermo-hydro-mechanical processes was carried out. Three simulations (mechanical loading only, thermo-mechanical coupling and thermo-hydro-mechanical coupling) are conducted using case studies that are available in the literature. In addition, the behaviour of a generic energy pile, which is installed in a kaolin-sand mixture, is studied by taking into consideration of thermo–hydro-mechanical processes. The coupled analysis provided the distributions of temperature, degree of saturation, suction and heat flux in the analysis domain. Numerical results of the fully-coupled method are compared with the results of sequential method of analysis.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Thermo-Hydro-Mechanical Effects on the Behaviour of Unsaturated Soil-Structure Interfaces and the Numerical Analysis of Energy Piles","doi":"10.20381/ruor-20812","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.20381/ruor-20812","venue":""}

L-Propionyl carnitine (LPC), an endogenous ester that plays a crucial role in cellular fatty acid oxidation and metabolism, has been shown to exert a protective effect in myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury. Our purpose was to investigate the effects of LPC in an SAO model of ischemia/reperfusion injury. Pentobarbital-anesthetized rats were subjected to 60 min of SAO followed by 120 min of reperfusion. An intravenous bolus of LPC (200 microg/kg) administered 2 min before reperfusion prolonged survival time (116+/-4 vs. 81+/-3 min in 1 mL/kg .9% NaCl vehicle, p < .01), increased survival rate (88 vs. 13.6%, p < .01), and attenuated the percent increase in hematocrits (27+/4% vs. 43+/-3%, p < .05), and the increases in tissue myeloperoxidase activity (1.76+/-.4 U/100 mg vs. 3.79+/-.2 U/100 mg, p < .05). In addition, LPC increased mean arterial blood pressures at 60 min (p < .05), 80 min (p < .05), 100 min (p < .05), and 120 min (p < .05) postreperfusion. Moreover, LPC markedly attenuated splanchnic artery endothelial dysfunction induced by SAO ischemia/reperfusion injury (maximal vasorelaxation to ACh, 74+/-2.7% vs. 57+/-1.9% in vehicle, p < .01). In this murine SAO model of ischemia/reperfusion injury, LPC affords significant protection that may be achieved through inhibiting leukocyte infiltration into intestinal tissue and preserving endothelial function, thereby decreasing microvascular permeability and maintaining tissue perfusion.","inCitations":["48e00cd6a790f7d3940de16b5b834eda4dc29d8b","e0ca37356b9c4bb79929cddd0455fc03f33b6e6e","508d5306c63e1d4b850788b9847a734eb212964f","677142628852d7b268c9acca9b2f2052f9273877","0ecf1d470c77bf40c6b6ab7e9cc15f0dc1c4bed7","d8e37ed188686d59e6f1eae7e8588597ad88f985","f2a2b7cf6d8dd833aefc8d8de3c65c5b2ae49116","dcfdae21a5fee9f7e9191ee1189e36eddaeb858a","ed2789c808ffecd0f8a39c26869004f2b0e85f83","44f47521bb09c3e5f13f07783c94bdb03896c20b","6f53daa16a2ad75d307602de833954714c822bc8","d3bbd716de65267ed5073d121813f43ad8ce01ac"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"L-propionyl carnitine, an endogenous ester in fatty acid metabolism, exerts anti-shock and endothelial protective effects in rat splanchnic ischemia-reperfusion injury.","doi":"10.1097/00024382-199803000-00010","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1097/00024382-199803000-00010","venue":"Shock"}

Refractive-index profiles of the fabricated IGI preforms doped in the core with boron oxide are shown in the paper. The sensitivity of IGI fibers drawn from these preforms to cladding refractive-index changes has been studied by means of the technique of selective excitation of optical models in the fiber immersed in various mixtures of n-butanol and benzyl alcohol. The obtained results are compared with those for reference step-index fibers with uniform pure-silica core. A theoretical model describing the detection process during these measurements has been derived using geometrical optics. On this basis it can be shown that the fiber sensitivity increases in the order of the reference fiber, IGI fiber with linear and modified-linear profiles and IGI fibers with parabolic profiles.","inCitations":["8d97d03664e83cc6580207d5bbe2c48dcd7526f8"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Modified graded-index fibers for chemical sensing","doi":"10.1117/12.373608","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1117/12.373608","venue":"Photonics Prague"}

Some studies have shown a strong epidemiological association between the ingestion of acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) during the viral infection and development of Reye's syndrome.\n\n\nCASE REPORT\nWe describe the case of a 20-month-old female who developed Reye's syndrome within the context of a viral infection and the ingestion of ASA. A hepatic biopsy study is appropriate in this syndrome. The patient presented a non-convulsive status during the acute phase and at one year developed Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. She died from pneumonia at the age of 18 years.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn all patients with clinical features that suggest Reye's syndrome, inborn errors of metabolism that can mimic it must be precluded. Although the incidence of this syndrome has gone down considerably in recent years, it is important to keep it in mind as an early and aggressive diagnosis and treatment of cerebral hypertension will reduce the mortality rate and the sequelae.","inCitations":["ba27eb12dfbbc7c03242bc00f056156b891a2aa9"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"[Reye's syndrome.

It is obtained by dimensional reduction of the 3 + 1 dimensional full theory and by subsequent integration over all static gauge degrees of freedom. The resulting theory corresponds to a 3-dimensional O(4) ferromagnet containing cubic and quartic terms of the field in its potential function. Possible nonperturbative effects of a magnetic screening mass are parametrically included in the potential. We analyse the theory using mean field and numerical Monte Carlo (MC) simulation methods. At the value of the physical Higgs mass, mH = 37 GeV, considered in the present investigation, we find a discontinuous symmetry restoring phase transition. We determine the critical temperature, order parameter jump, interface tension and latent heat characteristics of the transition. The Monte Carlo results indicate a somewhat weaker first order phase transition as compared to the mean field treatment, demonstrating that nonperturbative fluctuations of the Higgs field are relevant. This effect is especially important for the interface tension. Any observation of hard first order transition could result only from non-perturbative effects related to the gauge degrees of freedom.","inCitations":["7944ee1c975b7de346ebfeefce2ca2cd8b27ebef"],"pdfUrls":["https://arxiv.org/pdf/hep-lat/9406012v1.pdf","http://arxiv.org/pdf/hep-lat/9406012v1.pdf","http://inspirehep.net/record/374194/files/arXiv:hep-lat_9406012.pdf"],"title":"Effective scalar field theory for the electroweak phase transition","doi":"10.1016/0550-3213(95)00083-5","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/0550-3213%2895%2900083-5","venue":""}

Control and diseased rats at 4 wk of age were fed either a low fat or high fat diet (5 or 20 g/100 g diet) for 6 wk. In rats with kidney disease fed the high fat rather than the low fat diet, kidneys were 17% larger, renal fluid content was 19% higher and cyst scores were 30% higher, indicating greater disease progression. In diseased rats fed the high fat diet, serum urea was 25% higher, indicating worsened renal function. Serum creatinine was 49% higher only in males. To examine whether high dietary fat worsened renal cyst disease by altering sex hormone concentrations, serum testosterone and estrogen concentrations were determined. In normal compared with diseased male rats, serum testosterone concentrations were one to three times higher. Serum testosterone concentrations were higher in normal male rats fed the high compared with the low fat diet, but were not affected by diet in diseased rats. Serum estrogen concentrations were unaffected by dietary fat levels or by disease state. Although it remains to be elucidated how dietary fat influences sex hormone concentrations in this disease, the current study demonstrates that a high dietary fat intake increases kidney disease progression in Han:SPRD-cy rats.","inCitations":["8c283e721f920de11774849e7ea7bf4bcaee16c9","65b639b42d96538f52e897059c5c936e27d9e734","35447a92ab86758c0df35a7b7f9fbeb5b2b3d0e2","acc71bb9b5c878c0262c468030d5181a9657c1da","17244ac0260eacbde8af4e5609475f321fe7723f","46526c8430adcc9709134258d5b76c63b163947f","20790b733957ea4d7749858a3699a0414f34c5c8","04cfbbddb79d4eba316b8a6031eb5dfbec8946f8","9150b37613dc2a8e2684f7b37ea6cda3042cab8e","4283ef80e816d9743ec82f683226e15179e6690f","2c2039b9dd9067a14b0b0364d99971b64e542f9a","7e3df16b5a3e53f71582e562c8f6b7bdf9d3d4ab","cf7fe513a3bf54cb6d70e1de1ed8a0deefd2d2d0"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"High dietary fat intake increases renal cyst disease progression in Han:SPRD-cy rats.","doi":"10.1093/jn/130.9.2356","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1093/jn%2F130.9.2356","venue":"The Journal of nutrition"}

This makes its utility in patients admitted to internal medicine wards attractive. However, there is still an evidence gap in all the medical setting of how its use affects clinical variables such as length of stay, morbidity, and mortality. A prospective randomized controlled trial assessing the effect of a surface POCUS of the heart, lungs, and femoral and popliteal veins performed by an internal medicine physician during the first 24 h of patient admission to the unit with a presumptive cardiopulmonary diagnosis. The University of Melbourne iHeartScan, iLungScan, and two-point venous compression protocols are followed to identify left and right ventricular function, significant valvular heart disease, pericardial and pleural effusion, consolidation, pulmonary edema, pneumothorax, and proximal deep venous thrombosis. Patient management is not commanded by the protocol and is at the discretion of the treating team. A total of 250 patients will be recruited at one tertiary hospital. Participants are randomized to receive POCUS or no POCUS. The primary outcome measured will be hospital length of stay. Secondary outcomes include the change in diagnosis and management, 30-day hospital readmission, and healthcare costs. This study will evaluate the clinical impact of multi-organ POCUS in internal medicine patients admitted with cardiopulmonary diagnosis on the hospital length of stay. Recruitment of participants commenced in September 2018 and is estimated to be completed by March 2020. Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trial Registry, ACTRN12618001442291.

At present, hyaluronic acid gel is widely used in the primary prevention of adhesion after hysteroscopic adhesiolysis. However, its efficacy is still under debate. Therefore, the aim of this study was to systematically evaluate the efficacy of hyaluronic acid gel in preventing the recurrence of intrauterine adhesion after hysteroscopic adhesiolysis. The Cochrane Library, Embase, and PubMed databases were used to search for articles published before July 31, 2018, using the following terms: hyaluronic acid, intrauterine adhesions, Asherman's syndrome, IUA, hysteroscopy, and hysteroscopic adhesiolysis. Studies on therapies after hysteroscopic adhesiolysis were collected. The recurrence rate of and pregnancy rate in the presence of intrauterine adhesion after hysteroscopic adhesiolysis were analyzed by RevMan 5.3 software. A total of 6 articles were selected, which included 394 patients who were subjected to hysteroscopic adhesiolysis. The meta-analysis results showed that (1) no statistically significant difference was found between hyaluronic acid gel use and without its use on the score of intrauterine adhesion after hysteroscopic adhesiolysis [the mean difference (MD) = -0.89, 95% confidence interval (CI) (-2.53-0.76), P = 0.29], neither a statistically significant difference was observed between the same groups on the recurrence rate of intrauterine adhesion [odds ratio (OR) = 0.75, 95% CI (0.31-1.81), P = 0.53]; (2) subgroup analysis showed that hyaluronic acid gel could reduce the rate of intrauterine adhesion recurrence in randomized controlled trials [OR = -0.28, 95% CI (0.14-0.56), P = 0.0006]. However, the recurrence rate of intrauterine adhesion after the use of hyaluronic acid gel was not statistically significant in non-randomized controlled experiments [OR = 1.53, 95% CI (0.79-2.95), P = 0.21]; (3) hyaluronic acid gel did not result in a significant effect on pregnancy rate after intrauterine adhesion separation [OR = 2.02, 95% CI (0.53-7.66), P = 0.3]. In conclusion, hyaluronic acid gel could reduce the recurrence rate of intrauterine adhesion, but had no significant effect on the postoperative pregnancy rate.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Meta-analysis on the use of hyaluronic acid gel to prevent recurrence of intrauterine adhesion after hysteroscopic adhesiolysis.","doi":"10.1016/j.tjog.2019.09.002","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tjog.2019.09.002","venue":"Taiwanese journal of obstetrics & gynecology"}

The programme was divided into five phases, including: (1) the development of a novel preformed corrugated FRP panel for strengthening thin-walled steel plate girder webs against buckling, (2) selecting the appropriate adhesive and epoxy using double-lap shear and tension specimens, (3) producing the FRP panel, and (4, 5) testing its performance in two main experimental series. The initial series involved tests on 13 steel plates strengthened with the proposed preformed corrugated FRP panel and subjected to in-plane shear loading using a specially manufactured “picture frame” arrangement designed to induce the appropriate boundary conditions and stresses in the web plates of realistic plate girders; a description of this novel testing approach is included. This initial test series investigated the performance of different forms of strengthening under static load, in preparation for a subsequent series of cyclic tests to investigate their fatigue performance. The test variables included FRP type (CFRP or GFRP), form of FRP (closed or open section), number of FRP layers, and orientation of GFRP fibres used to build the FRP panel. This paper focuses on the second series, in which six specimens were manufactured to simulate the end panel of a 15m plate girder. These were strengthened with the optimized FRP panel from the first series and tested for shear buckling under repeated cyclic loading. Test results and non-linear finite element modelling showed the efficiency of the technique at reducing the critical stresses and increasing the fatigue life of the girders. Finally, the most appropriate strengthening method for fatigue performance is given on the basis of the work presented herein.","inCitations":["ad1b832b32749b2dfd2d5edf914788651a3edbe5","b4fa709822762deb2e91ba50dbdfe1af70c92a51"],"pdfUrls":["https://www.research.ed.ac.uk/portal/files/33151519/Al_Azzawi_et_al._ACMBS_VII_2016_Under_Publication.pdf"],"title":"FRP Strengthening of Web Panels of Steel Plate Girders against Shear Buckling under Static and Cyclic Loading","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

The authors examined a total of 75.8 million flashes divided among the three years, 22.7 million (1995), 26.2 million (1996), and 26.9 million (1997). The highest flash densities, uncorrected for detection efficiency, occur in Louisiana and Florida, typically exceeding 11 flashes km−2 on a grid scale of 0.2°. Positive flash densities exceed 1.1 flashes km−2 in Florida, Louisiana, and an area overlapped by the states of Tennessee, Mississippi, and Kentucky. The monthly percentage positive lightning ranges from 6.5% (July 1995) to 24.5% (January 1996). The annual percentage of positive lightning is 9.3% (1995), 10.2% (1996), and 10.1% (1997). Areas of positive lightning greater than 25% occur from the Canadian border as far south as Kansas, ...","inCitations":["cefdb1e8c4e8bb389256d84c997b8a75f310e8fb","6fdefc7738828d6cab9ff513a9c340d9280d3acb","28a0abd67a12b7729347d08613daa805042c4264","56a0d832ff7812a5892a273bb05f2d4339994704","163ff0b385fe94960e05b60db9fb598804534a6f","97a6bcb755ba30d2fdf48f211baa5df97628d354","4ee6ff2a0d7448808c1364afef406d97d673f1ec","6e57514e88f9ea159c0dff097752370655393073","835585abfb7612a1c390bf73fc7d475b7fa172a5","6fb4da32763cbeae14cfcafc1e8451316aac4a94","838fd437631a9a7c44b7a856c8f6288c80bb8910","b5e41669280f49c4248681fd8a407a8b73abf08f","8f0505e180dabcfc771298fcbdfae83f09131d37","d15c93257bde5c7f18d01e0bfb025c983701ed63","583abe8b0cfc864fde73890ff1c8194b422b740f","23b280a249c24b552fe04711f498febe94594905","33140bec4afb52970e9ece41dbedf89554da50e2","d7ddb58c45d42ec12c2a693c58112cdaba0fa570","aa03e0dde0406bcd3b3eab4720ae0d1019e2b313","7adc99aac6d6fe3453c67730ff45e2667b4b8ddb","1ab27ed4771f0b75e5ec1c3874236a9e21ae5f13","c18101e02d728bcf05234b4c9f8ba9f02ee3ea1b","393f8138a5c539b198d199379b865f0d2971f247","15110f5570e680f6ad3b278ba9dfce79d28bd966","8ba99d7f1906b84d503341f94cee80239ab0f25a","5d8563364f89545a26ff9e3bac6a7c5b101d710d","43d218a5d4b5b65c8646bbe022d90e157ba20938","e237c6128193f796c2ec4836e358dbcafe0689ac","2d2e040dcac3b254f3d1bc188060705c6f35ee73","8d8ab8338f64cf5f89bfe743781fb695602919de","1cdc9abe7c60bd51fbc7758c7e6d758e41e11bf0","36b68d800859b71c6d1365a1fab8e212369121ee","993746f91632bc2ae5d5a1fe09560184a3ea4437","5dbc5b02c52c9f545db4849fd432a4786e0abec7","1aed9c595e29bcde05abf04932e2712150b049d7","b893b1c5a960a55a49959db209be4461b568ad9e","3fa1f4f1dd5005f694d47ce17ed7f03056fc2d2d","6eeaca6365b9ed9231bb6be1cb3a9471abe352e3","0d0a5463aed626d4566dc2c0b69a877874ae5074","0cbef6a79ce9150bbb2e961176726c70f495c6e5","73a9124aa59e1eb3f91eb6b9eea231e0d08ea149","e3bf5205540bf8771c35790a5b5181a679feb282","e0bdde4813066aa90408a3f1d15754e7bd6c4b10","1d491533dfa80c4320beff970e9c2532a8c6d66a","da92fe9d47efbeee37eab9e3f369920c38d09ccd","b90a6b4f38db5352a8639621725626f967bc3bb8","128dbc96b1637a9dbd108a74978213a58214d9d5","99e9f94bee9acb863c7b4ca653fa9942d240d322"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Lightning Ground Flash Measurements over the Contiguous United States: 1995–97","doi":"10.1175/1520-0493(1999)127<2693:LGFMOT>2.0.CO;2","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1175/1520-0493%281999%29127%3C2693%3ALGFMOT%3E2.0.CO%3B2","venue":""}
