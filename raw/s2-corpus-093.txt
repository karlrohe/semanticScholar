Multiple-mating strategies are characteristic of the mating systems of small mammals. As such, techniques that provide an accurate indication of how individuals are related genetically is of great importance to assess the mating system of a species. In this study, we applied the DNA fingerprinting technique to captive and wild muskrats (Ondatra zibethicus) to determine its usefulness for parentage analysis in wild populations. We found that DNA digested with the restriction enzyme Hae III and probed with Jeffrey's minisatellite 33. 15 identified a large amount of polymorphism in both groups of muskrats. The DNA fingerprinting technique correctly assessed parentage within the captive group. In the wild population, paternity was assigned between two adult males based on diagnostic fragments and similarity of banding patterns. The likelihood that paternity could be misassigned to a full sibling was high in this free-ranging population. However, because natal dispersal in muskrats is male biased, it is unlikely that two brothers would associate with the same female.","inCitations":["f45d1d4c17ce4c32a26a322a019924ba104ebad7","12fe102ff5cf7cc12278af2d717b2ff4ad745bd7","da98c599ae744037f063046f683dd04fcc259147","f326a102fb864d87260706a71dad653c87f77c0e","fd27cbddb50f9ef8b16e3b140e0d8d63392e6cfc","581d5fcbee409085ef7b9e87834c79ef5c22ca30"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Use of DNA fingerprinting to determine parentage in muskrats (Ondatra zibethicus).","doi":"10.1093/oxfordjournals.jhered.a111231","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1093/oxfordjournals.jhered.a111231","venue":"The Journal of heredity"}

Power Management is critical for roadside units since they are typically powered on for servicing requests from vehicles. In this work, we envision low-power proxy servers to act on behalf of roadside units during periods of minimal activity to enable roadside units to be powered down resulting in power savings. However there exists a need for modeling of vehicular networks with roadside units and proxy servers for analyzing power-performance trade-offs. Towards this goal, we develop a queueing model to understand the impact of highway traffic on the power consumed by roadside units and proxy servers and further propose a threshold based approach for power savings. Our experiments conducted using real traces demonstrate that the proposed approach is traffic-aware in that it balances the trade-off between power consumption and delay.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1109/ANTS.2017.8384181"],"title":"Towards modeling vehicular networks with power-performance trade-offs","doi":"10.1109/ANTS.2017.8384181","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ANTS.2017.8384181","venue":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Advanced Networks and Telecommunications Systems (ANTS)"}

Despite the strength of this motif and its persistence in London's fiction, however, Mills finds its varying applications confused, contradictory, even insincere at times. I wish to suggest, on the contrary, that a close reading of London's works reveals neither his confusion nor his lack of sincerity so much as his remarkable tact in handling complex symbolic patterns. The oversight in Mills's essay derives from his failure to realize that there are at least FOUR separate versions of the symbolic wilderness in London's fiction-not merely one-and that each version is endowed with its own special qualities. The first of these four versions is the White Silence, the vast, still wilderness of the Northland. Here, nature is cold, austere, and inviolable; man, puny and insignificant.

The purpose of the analysis is to compare the performance of the four techniques and evaluate their efficiency in dealing with specific challenges involved in the modal identification of the tested cable-stayed bridge, namely the existence of closely spaced modes, the perturbation produced by the local vibration of stay-cables, and the variation of modal damping coefficients with wind velocity.

Once considered an esoteric tropical disease confined to Southeast Asia and northern Australia, research on B. pseudomallei has recently gained global prominence due to its classification as a potential bioterrorism agent by countries such as the United States and also by increasing numbers of case reports from regions where it is not endemic. An environmental bacterium typically found in soil and water, assessing the true global prevalence of melioidosis is challenged by the fact that clinical symptoms associated with B. pseudomallei infection are extremely varied and may be confused with diverse conditions such as lung cancer, tuberculosis, or Staphyloccocus aureus infection. These diagnostic challenges, coupled with lack of awareness among clinicians, have likely contributed to underdiagnosis and the high mortality rate of melioidosis, as initial treatment is often either inappropriate or delayed. Even after antibiotic treatment, relapses are frequent, and after resolution of acute symptoms, chronic melioidosis can also occur, and the symptoms can persist for months to years. In a recent article, Price et al. [mBio 4(4):e00388-13, 2013, doi:10.1128/mBio.00388-13] demonstrate how comparative genomic sequencing can reveal the repertoire of genetic changes incurred by B. pseudomallei during chronic human infection. Their results have significant clinical ramifications and highlight B. pseudomallei's ability to survive in a wide range of potential niches within hosts, through the acquisition of genetic adaptations that optimize fitness and resource utilization.","inCitations":["c4764a960587d4cac2c831684a27c506f2201219","3477fe2f4378ba84dd1638627cd6058c3ec8f93f","67db3341b4176116fcb379979a6c6f743aba8538","53ad8101ba1b9cf26eb1f4ba756ba164ea3cb1b3","5393189714d48f5242ab127f7713e263f45c2edf","84a6d88fb5b30ca8489c5444149566ac28086aac","e4a4b2d07e6970f6822a44e5accfc84c79912f88","e596c4d12aecc00924410cdde7322adeb5707057","2032797c6c7d71c102c2444fe26bf5e692a916b8","5ebe1997df9656c417b2cffa4022256d05e192ff","89196ecf56a31862e865ccd4f84dec2d6e9a4da8"],"pdfUrls":["https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/pmc/oa_pdf/f5/5d/mBio.00709-13.PMC3781838.pdf"],"title":"Less Is More: Burkholderia pseudomallei and Chronic Melioidosis","doi":"10.1128/mBio.00709-13","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1128/mBio.00709-13","venue":"mBio"}

Hydropathy profiling in combination with the \"positive inside rule\" predicts for most of the homologous proteins an alpha-helical bundle of 12 transmembrane segments, but the positions of these transmembrane segments and the location of the amino and carboxyl termini are by no means conclusive. The secondary structure of DtpT was investigated by analyzing 42 DtpT-alkaline phosphatase fusion proteins, generated by random or directed fusions of the corresponding genes. These studies confirm the presence of 12 transmembrane segments but refute several other predictions made of the secondary structure. Data obtained from the fusion proteins were substantiated by studying the accessibility of single cysteine mutants in putative cytoplasmic or extracellular loops by membrane (im)permeant sulfhydryl reagents. The deduced topology model of DtpT consists of a bundle of 12 alpha-helixes with a short amino and a large carboxyl terminus, both located at the cytoplasmic site of the membrane. On the basis of sequence comparisons with DtpT, it seems likely that the structure model of the amino-terminal half of DtpT also holds for the eukaryotic peptide transporters, whereas the carboxyl-terminal half is largely different.","inCitations":["7efbc885c5228977c515466f129d5b9b1539a21c","e43cf9ae8e800e57536e5c89cac43a39667a38d1","184332a87372d8aa8491f92ba7ea18608dd93865","039a37c0741e78f196850c7f5055bef9c270bac3","deaf7fd11c4410adaa7b4e403a3b5972e4a8c881","baa122edba301ab481bf2822062c44f4d4291869","ac17db512e44fd744d60e5343324a365d0b9d22f","8be21d5fe2bb5cbfaf6a096f6dabacb6402cc2cd","7c8b4ebfaf927499a41a6806b99a11ca1c10ed6d","4e4fb3c314efca4b64b524beadeb63a201f9857b","2abd3dda15a5150ced101344fdb71039b71df40c","6a7574e51b4a32234c1d9fa2f41d71099f124205","31965e4fcb093291a9a0a024877e77c3fb546e0e","d78539a7a65701a8ea2430e9764965fec127179d","046886d79ce26ab2a2ec1c63475456f743e50584","fbfff614604e39fe047b82b1573004ef536513e6","bbc50c08d38601c9944c4abebd8c9568d9f3cb9d","16e57ab2058089a361936bdb3eca4cb934e3a924","a2acf9ed9a2f8e996ed93e668557c1595025f912","8e62845698bd14b3c6c3750f7a04d9cb3fe514c7"],"pdfUrls":["https://www.rug.nl/research/portal/files/3618843/1997BiochemHagting.pdf"],"title":"Membrane topology of the di- and tripeptide transport protein of Lactococcus lactis.","doi":"10.1021/bi963068t","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1021/bi963068t","venue":"Biochemistry"}

Decidual proteolysis and extracellular matrix degradation is mediated in part by a balance between urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1). The effects of sex steroids on uPA and PAI-1 production by human decidual stromal cells is investigated. STUDY DESIGN: Stromal cells were isolated and purified from first trimester and term decidua, and treated with estradiol (10 M [E2]), medroxyprogesterone acetate (10 M [MPA]), both, or vehicle for 7 days. After 24h incubation, uPA and PAI-1 levels in conditioned supernatant were measured by ELISA. Measurements were corrected for protein content, and expressed as meanGSEM. RESULTS: Although unaffected by hormone treatment, basal uPA production was higher by term versus first trimester decidual stromal cells (32.4 G 13.9 vs 4.6 G 2.4 fg/mg protein [P ! .05]). PAI-1 secretion by term decidual stromal cells was higher than by first trimester cells (4.7G 2.1 vs 1.7G 0.2 pg/mg protein [P ! .05]). MPA (not E2) increased PAI-1 production in both populations (3.5and 2.0-fold, respectively). E2 augmented MPA-stimulated PAI-1 production by first trimester (6-fold) but not term decidual cells (1.1-fold). CONCLUSION: Sex steroids exert a differential effect on uPA and PAI-1 production in first trimester and term decidual stromal cells, which may be important in promoting decidual activation and spontaneous labor at term. MPA stimulation of PAI-1 by term decidual cells may account for its pregnancy prolonging properties.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Effect of steroid hormones on uPA and PAI-1 expression in term decidual stromal cells: Implications for the onset of labor","doi":"10.1016/j.ajog.2004.10.370","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajog.2004.10.370","venue":""}

Basically, this study agrees to existing literatures suggesting that Korean tale of heaven-ascending nymph is in a significant relationship with Buryat tribe’s foundation myth ‘Hori Turned Mergen.’ But in view of differences between two tales alone, it is found that the former contains Korean sentiment and cultural nature. Finally, it will be necessary for follow-up studies to find out ‘heavenly swan nymph’ tales. in Indian Buddhist literature, and examine characteristics of each script in academic comparison with tales in other countries, as well as cultural significance contained inside tales.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"몽골의 ‘천녀 설화’의 변천 과정과 한국 설화와의 비교연구","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

This study attempted to evaluate the changes in cardiac output and left ventricular filling dynamics when the pacing mode was switched from V pacing to AV pacing. Study population consisted of 26 patients with multiprogrammable AV pacemakers. Cardiac output was determined as a product of echocardiographically determined cross sectional area of the aortic annulus and Doppler-determined velocity integral of left ventricular outflow over systole. Left ventricular peak rapid filling rate (PFR) and peak atrial filling velocity to peak rapid filling velocity ratio (A/R) were determined from measurements at the mitral annulus. Cardiac output showed a significant improvement when the pacing mode was switched from V to AV pacing, and the percent change ranged from 3 to 73% (average 26%). The improvement in cardiac output brought about by AV synchrony was greater in patients with smaller PFR (r = -0.71, p less than 0.01) and larger A/R ratio (r = 0.77, p less than 0.01). On the other hand, PFR was greater with V pacing than with AV pacing. Greater increment of the PFR was produced by the loss of atrial contraction in patients with smaller PFR (r = -0.82, p less than 0.01) and larger A/R ratio (r = 0.76, p less than 0.01). Thus, AV pacing provides a great improvement in left ventricular filling, i.e., cardiac output, which cannot be obtained with V pacing even with the compensatory enhancement of left ventricular rapid filling. These beneficial effects of AV pacing seemed to be greater in patients with impaired left ventricular rapid filling.","inCitations":["c58f6c1971a3991cff5ea241278960406b44bf08","4231161560a44334db652283a2908016610cdfc7","8434e8de09a50d7449155d2d3437ea11827ca9ec","1ac71a4ea05a83ff0fbf205adcb74cbd36dd0163","203060bc39dc69e13071770834a8a47774123f4a"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Beneficial effects of atrioventricular sequential pacing on cardiac output and left ventricular filling assessed with pulsed Doppler echocardiography.","doi":"10.1253/jcj.50.799","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1253/jcj.50.799","venue":"Japanese circulation journal"}

The 3300-base pair (bp) rat beta-MHC promoter is stimulated by both an alpha 1-agonist and a constitutively activated mutant of beta-PKC (Kariya, K., Karns, L. R., Simpson, P. C. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 10023-10026). Here, we report the convergence of alpha 1-adrenergic and beta-PKC signaling on the same element of the beta-MHC promoter. A 20-bp sequence in the beta-MHC promoter (-215/-196) was required for induction by both alpha 1-adrenergic stimulation and beta-PKC and conferred induction on a heterologous promoter. This sequence bound myocyte nuclear factor(s) through a 9-bp \"enhancer core\" (5'-TGTGGTATG-3'). A 3-bp mutation within the enhancer core which abolished factor binding also abolished inducibility of a 215-bp beta-MHC promoter. These results support the idea that beta-PKC is in the pathway for alpha 1-adrenergic regulation of beta-MHC transcription during cardiac myocyte hypertrophy. The enhancer core is the first PKC response element mapped by transfection of an activated PKC mutant, rather than by treatment with phorbol esters.","inCitations":["0ab70e9ee4f9372cac523f94547a96476d6e7f11","2944c08314fed03b3b7abbf7712e1ce9451f25b5","4ccbe7a86abf4575a589243522d677a155d9467c","fd16ab0c2f9b4ce98d5f366aa8eec1452606b066","d35e01a83b78a111db3bf44474c0772efda30127","fa1e14f0e1916c9b2ba7f77672ff232fe2760be0","361f010136a48970f3b319e18e936479e3df3051","ca5eecf13dc7fb7a1f23a760eb76188e2fd55d41","0d3aaaa9ac875d7174a34cb44b453aa7c1597706","e316d572629f50b2162acdc9066271e5f981152d","0b72dcae9af3b5e311b790a66af00f743b5045e0","aacd7f6b411a79fecdda54fbde0ff4c7c3eb03c7","0bc7678f8d746c15e626023553d18379d7e58a19","2548c9cca5005e93c218073ed325daefc6c9f6fc","0f784376beefd3d95aa08e299ff9b6950730be20","ea149888ebcd2da9526717dabc33f833cc56067b","033e1938548bb1abd03474ea1146210de4bcabe8","0e493c2e5d8cfb38f27335d7873241371ac88e07","ad6286177e8b7abd46d644d855098e03d3af8f3b","d82240455b497378f06c8097c82dad1e7393db97","e334e9446831ee28e9b60967237681c90b4254f7","a97592909128318b8e57b0b9f4571f132d4c5415","585eda29bee0a2eec1e3d6b2b731eb5077ebf8d4","f0dc2b3ddf30458bbe67e9c823d48df28cdc6c75","582acb4e389b49620f5915020989e17175af43b2","8f423cf17e8b56ebe4a387fc26509f21c3d2f9fa","081c8e0df7de6ce1711cd45765bb48128bcbe12d","80d398f90909f5a47116ed0b5eb448dc9469fa86","915a95ea19b2a793545c45bac42eecaa81fe7376","1d063528f1cea486a4c30c3e86897f02bddd2201","07c857b31ec144c188f3fd32e5d4dde4ab8d824b","2971fa6c779e4611980dd95f272f521cd44beba9","2f3d873cd4415556f2c615ca4f4c107fb7f409fa","2abb04a464eafd38bc1faf4ec6ad2aa4bc4d0cd5","6e34f7b385f77dafa4a8a9456c498698840033f8","d90a5b2e6b718344ca66f3ed9afc63e9b32a784a","c60795dc8d73988d733ce2263a15a5b42f0fe0b4","bc2a0efdd4db2a49b81b587ca0e11bc6c7d96721","18bd6a4a59fadd151231cbf7e08a566bb2bed971","6fe459687ed47ce76845c0bced15eede35284058","4121fd51f443b14b7b203af262d18b7957644660","a89cf98b55c93853f6d13edfeecc9c1cff1b423d","6500335620b037f8f17e544fd3c491cd8fff7d59","da0298a1c752e9863c9fd34557a96e7ebf8c27b7","b6cc1da7325ccaa8b5b205e8f0419a7813129a9a","d1cc3d377f1b690bea140cd5f405093aa5916e2a","9fe9b366bafc3dcf3cc0b5343ef7444e9ce4097f","1e7d813ba011a9f37352a9af1615f743f456e71b","cf7fb5755b6bdefb85ce2b13b2857e9f831c47b6","9928ce62e2476718c2c9344712ab60156d101e85","fc8122a259f27ca1711ac57e6832fcae92f4f51e","585b73481d6b9bf4ec753585bf80c8d5242043e4","e53a08eaafa17ad2126ec8767db6317b83ed91a3","5b0e1f52294503fa3fd0959ea035e372d787f687","f4c83b4c5cc61642f2dfb485fffa439f25148257","e7b5f5f7dd93ed50dc236417326382f39b640b6e"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"An enhancer core element mediates stimulation of the rat beta-myosin heavy chain promoter by an alpha 1-adrenergic agonist and activated beta-protein kinase C in hypertrophy of cardiac myocytes.","doi":"","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"The Journal of biological chemistry"}

These fibrin-fibrinogen mixtures in plasma were gel-filtered through sepharose-CL 6B columns equilibrated with buffered plasma (sepharose-plasma columns) at 20°C and at 37°C. Using buffered plasma for elution 125 I-fibrin was separated from 131 I-fibrinogen at 20°C as well as 37°C. At 20°C, a mean of 5.8% 131 I-fibrinogen was eluted together with 125 I-fibrin, whereas at 37°C, only minute amounts (1.2%) of 131 I-fibrinogen were recovered with 125 I-fibrin. When in another series of experiments monomeric 125 I-des-AB fibrin and 131 I-fibrinogen obtained by previous gel chromatography in buffered 3 M urea were mixed with plasma, dialyzed against plasma and chromatographed on sepharose-plasma columns at 20°C as well as at 37°C, fibrin could be separated from fibrinogen. At 20°C, some 131 I-fibrinogen was eluted together with 125 I-fibrin, whereas at 37°C no 131 I-fibrinogen was recovered together with 125 I-fibrin. It can be concluded that high-molecular weight fibrin aggregates formed from previously monomeric fibrin. The experiments presented do not indicate the existence of fibrin-fibrinogen complexes in plasma at 37°C.","inCitations":["bb044970d8bb76561d168995fd7b12e01efce5da"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Separation of human des-AB fibrin and fibrinogen by sepharose-plasma chromatography at 20°C and 37°C","doi":"10.1016/0049-3848(79)90120-8","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/0049-3848%2879%2990120-8","venue":""}

IT is the greatest possible mistake to suppose—as, unfortunately, many yet do—that a scientific education unfits a man for the pursuits of ordinary professional or commercial life. I believe that no one can be unfitted for business life or occupations by the study of phenomena, all of which are based upon law, the knowledge of which can only be obtained by the exercise of exact habits of thought, and patient and laborious effort. I dare say many who have had a scientific education make bad men of business, but so do many who have not had such an education; it is not the scientific education which has spoilt them. Even more directly does the value of scientific education bear upon professional and manufacturing life. The medical man's success depends mainly upon the exercise of faculties which are pre-eminently called forth, and strengthened in original scientific investigations. The manufacturer who aspires to something more than following the rule-of-thumb work of his predecessors, requires exactly these habits of mind which are developed by original research. If the brewer, the calico-printer, the dyer, the alkali-maker, the metallurgist wish to make any advance of their own in their respective trades, they cannot do so without the exercise of powers which an only be gained by the prosecution of original inquiry. Doubtless many—nay, even most—of the great discoveries and improvements in the arts and manufactures may have been made by men who have been self-taught. But these men have acquired for themselves, by slow and difficult steps, the same habits of exact observation, patient and laborious devotion, and manipulative or constructive skill which the modem student of science may, at any rate to a very considerable extent, gain in his college course. So valuable is this kind of education found to be, that in Germany, where it is most practised, the chemical manufacturers now refuse to take young men into their works unless they have not merely had a scientific education, but also have prosecuted original investigation.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Original Research as a Means of Education: II","doi":"10.1038/008559a0","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1038/008559a0","venue":"Nature"}

When treating mixed wastewater with microorganism, it was easy to remove when SCN concentrations of mixed wastewater was 200 mg/L or less. While the treatment effect of COD-causing materials was low at the concentration of 400 mg/L or less, it implies that highly concentrated thiocyanate contains a large amount of slowly biodegradable organics.

This study investigated the molecular mechanism behind GE reduced the high permeability of fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLSs) derived from SD rats with adjuvant arthritis (AA), with the aims of observing the action of GE in AA rats and exploring new therapeutic strategies for RA treatment. The CCK-8 method was used to detect FLSs proliferation. The pro-inflammatory cytokines levels and anti-inflammatory cytokines levels in FLSs were determined by ELISA kits. FLSs permeability assay was performed on Transwell. Immunofluorescence was used to assay the arrangement and morphology of F-actin. The expression of the key molecules related to FLSs permeability (RhoA, p-p38MAPK, NF-κB p-p65 and F-actin) was detected by western blotting. After treatment with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), the proliferation and the permeability of the cells increased significantly (all P < 0.05). The expression of RhoA, p-p38MAPK, NF-κB p-p65 and F-actin in FLSs was higher compared with the control group, and F-actin was redistributed, with the formation of additional stress fibers. But, these conditions were moderated after treatment with GE. We demonstrated that the treatment of different concentrations of GE (25, 50, and 100 μg/mL) had a significant inhibitory effect on the proliferation and permeability of FLSs in vitro. Furthermore, the levels of interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-17 secreted by FLSs were decreased in different doses of GE groups, and the levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-4, TGF-β1) were increased. Under treatment with GE, low expression of RhoA downregulated expression of p-p38MAPK, NF-κB p-p65, and F-actin while compared with control group, and restored the hyperpermeability of FLSs due to LPS treatment. Taken together, GE might play its anti-inflammatory and immunoregulatory effects via regulating the relative equilibrium of pro-inflammatory cytokines and anti-inflammatory cytokines. GE attenuated the hyperpermeability of FLSs. The down-regulation of the conduction of RhoA/p38MAPK/NF-κB/F-actin signal may play a critical role in the mechanisms of GE on RA. GE could be an effective therapeutic agent for the treatment of RA.","inCitations":["1fc028eaddb1a3cbad6e7840d3d4e46f0aa17d54","d8bb4a91e9096ba84ca597f8519e1557aace84e9","23a5b8e989ed46e42c90a4c3ca72453b5870ba38","0cc7d69f80a72cd37521fb0cf6ac3bc81406dbdb","24291af7a3960219350bbe06a5c11c2420dfb221","6122049c911e2f61b016e9037656343fc71e2111"],"pdfUrls":["https://fjfsdata01prod.blob.core.windows.net/articles/files/325589/pubmed-zip/.versions/1/.package-entries/fphar-09-00105/fphar-09-00105.pdf?rscd=attachment%3B+filename*%3DUTF-8''fphar-09-00105.pdf&se=2019-05-27T07:38:59Z&sig=i3F8FaYpCRm3m5t0D2bY7PEBIO3IXKfPJRTNGYWKSZU%3D&sp=r&sr=b&sv=2015-12-11"],"title":"Anti-inflammatory Mechanism of Geniposide: Inhibiting the Hyperpermeability of Fibroblast-Like Synoviocytes via the RhoA/p38MAPK/NF-κB/F-Actin Signal Pathway","doi":"10.3389/fphar.2018.00105","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.3389/fphar.2018.00105","venue":"Front.

What was once considered science fiction is now routinely used to treat disease. Some of the most significant of these breakthroughs have occurred in the fields of stem cells and cloning. Stem cells are relatively undifferentiated cells that can continue dividing indefinitely. There are two types of stem cells, embryonic stem cells and adult stem cells. While both are referred to as stem cells, they have different characteristic properties. Embryonic stem cells have limitless growth potential and can differentiate into any cell type. If they are put back into an early embryonic environment, they can give rise to all the tissues and cell types of the body. On the other hand, adult stem cells are more restricted and can only give rise to certain types of cells. The curative potential of these techniques appears unbelievable. For example, a patient dying of renal failure today faces few viable medical options. While doctors now can only resort to temporizing—not curative—methods, such as dialysis and kidney transplantation, future research promises the use of stem cells to grow a new kidney for the person. In fact, embryonic stem cells could be manipulated for use in any part of the body.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://download.yutorah.org/2011/1053/756179.pdf"],"title":"Jewish Bioethical Perspectives on the Therapeutic Use of Stem Cells and Cloning","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

This was not only infuriating but also causing cash flow problems for me, as were disputes with contractors (one had long delayed the work we had contracted for while refusing to refund my substantial deposit). Our neighborhood was deserted and depressing. I was tired of dealing with piles of debris, things that were broken, and the never-ending series of inconveniences that had come to characterize life in a severely wounded city. My wife was suffering from residual effects of covering Hurricane Katrina for the Times-Picayune as well as burnout from her stressful job of delivering information and perspective to a city starving for both. Tulane University, my employer, was to be censured the following year by the American Association of University Professors because of the termination of tenured faculty and the elimination of major units in the weeks after Katrina without adequate faculty input. We were struggling to attract students and retain faculty. Several of my favorite colleagues had had it and were departing. I was not sleeping well, was easily irritated, and was angry about how poorly government, corporations, and other institutions were responding—or were not responding—to the challenges that their leaders had declared responsibility for.

Interleukin-18 (IL-18) is a proinflammatory cytokine known to play a role in the acute and chronic inflammatory phases of RA. IL-18 binding protein is the natural antagonist of IL-18 protein. We aim to identify the effect of HLA-DRB1*04 gene polymorphisms on IL-18 and IL-18BP gene expressions profiles as well as the time-course profiles following in vitro stimulation with mitogens. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 16 RA patients and 21 healthy controls were cultured for 1, 4, 8, 12, 24, 48 and 72 h following stimulation with either LPS or PHA. mRNA expression of IL-18 and IL 18BP were determined by quantitative real-time PCR using a comparative Ct (threshold cycle) method. IL-18 levels in supernatants were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Basal mRNA (4.5-fold) and protein levels of IL-18 were increased and IL-18BP mRNA expression was decreased (8-fold) in RA patients when compared to controls. Similarly, increased IL-18 levels were observed in active RA patients, whereas IL-18BP expression was increased in inactive patients. There was an increase in mRNA and protein levels of IL-18 in RA patients that peaked at 4 h and 8 h respectively following LPS stimulation. A similar profile was observed for IL-18BP; however, the expression level was higher in controls than RA patients. Persistent high production of IL-18 in RA is associated with disease progression and IL-18 BP seems to inhibit this activity.","inCitations":["77112099d89f13b2bb67d8b31ad551db3c5c4135","18332b948ead5d473047f25049580ad3bae1e6cc","7cca758dc640f5048c5b4f6a010de349ca01fad7"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"HLA-DRB1*04 gene polymorphisms and expressions profiles of interleukin-18 and interleukin-18 binding protein following in vitro stimulation in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells of healthy individuals and patients with rheumatoid arthritis.","doi":"10.1016/j.lfs.2007.02.020","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.lfs.2007.02.020","venue":"Life sciences"}

The acquired profiles, also known as leads in this paper, are expected to contain information which is relevant to the target profile. TONIC problem has been solved by modeling it as search problem and using heuristics to direct the best-first search on the social graph. The problem with this approach is that in case of dense neighbors of the target profile the computation of the heuristic can be significantly expensive. In this paper, we have introduced a k-beam search Heuristic which significantly mitigates this overhead.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1007/978-981-15-0035-0_11"],"title":"Optimization of Target Oriented Network Intelligence Collection for the Social Web by Using k-Beam Search","doi":"10.1007/978-981-15-0035-0_11","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-981-15-0035-0_11","venue":"SocProS"}

The fuel supply circuit for the direct injection of LPG in liquid form was modified into a return-type system comprised of a three-way high pressure pump, a low pressure regulator, a brushless direct current (BLDC) pump, and an LPG tank. Particulate number (PN) and size distribution measurements were performed in FTP-75 and HWFET modes, and also using an engine test bench. The experimental results showed that significant PN emissions were produced during the cold start and the transient warm-up operations of the gasoline direct injection (GDI) vehicle; this production of particle emissions was due to application of split injection and catalyst heating function. A bimodal particle size of 10 < dp < 100 nm was formed in the GDI vehicle, whereas a sub 30 nm nuclei mode was mainly formed in the LPG-DI vehicle. Excessive particle formation during sudden acceleration of the GDI vehicle in the HWFET mode was improved with LPG fuel. The reduction rate of the PN concentration with LPG application reached approximately 98% (FTP-75 mode) and 99% (HWFET mode) compared to the GDI vehicle. The total PN concentration in the LPG-DI vehicle was significantly improved to 1.6 × 1010 (N/km) for the FTP-75 mode and 3.4 × 109 (N/km) for the HWFET mode.","inCitations":["a48aab00ffc9f75cd5ee4570ea72917c781416c3","73d23446dfe3b2d3538f38c9ce27c83cacae545c","126008d03150982ba24be82eef7115100befac5e","f3423a73d691ef9d37f9fcb3fab2847b64b4b5d6","40c515d645264e7ea92cede1a46191c6b7d09a76","16e433dd99c190660f848e2edf2ce4cf03386eb4","4ff2315de7ced620ad8f2b60e74240c7e4d3bfaf","cae0e6fa7ff2d8e1a2093c0324035adfa8bbfec9","35beaa57c66c6897bb7c6f1dc6a7f11b7508cbd0","fb5c5c873bd748b439907a23c67530764227ba9e","bd60fd74836ec2eb54e9a951726eaa3a60ac73d8","d85dc24640460db89299be07a35ce085fb642dc8","a86e0d398f2fc5cec7d904cc14a0abc6d0667c86","9e60e39c7f9d093ae98d147702065b0d37a07d77","a64d16e70113ccadabe37f34da6b8086b3d598ef","9e300fffa2c76e784c79882653142711517facbe","96e6db6174794f9dd127b1738f544fdfd35380c1"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Comparative study of engine control strategies for particulate emissions from direct injection light-duty vehicle fueled with gasoline and liquid phase liquefied petroleum gas (LPG)","doi":"10.1016/j.fuel.2011.10.041","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fuel.2011.10.041","venue":""}

AFLCAI uses the effector map mechanism to obtain the approximation of metadata, and improves the branch coverage and the number of path coverage by heuristic guided mutation. The comparison experiment proves that AFLCAI can effectively improve the code coverage without affecting the running speed.

Fourteen older hypertensive females (age, 62 +/- 2 years) participated in a 6-month AEX program. Following AEX there was a significant increase in maximal aerobic capacity (VO(2)max) (P =.0001), and a significant decline in systolic (P =.01) and diastolic (P =.006) blood pressure. In addition, following AEX there was a significant decline in total body fat mass (P =.005), abdominal fat mass (P =.048), and percent body fat (P =.006). Insulin sensitivity, as assessed by the insulin-assisted frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test (FSIVGTT), increased significantly following AEX (P =.007). Despite the increase in insulin sensitivity and the decline in body fat, plasma TNF-alpha levels were not altered by AEX (P =.223). No significant relationship existed among the changes in TNF-alpha levels and the changes insulin sensitivity or any measure of body composition following AEX. In conclusion, in this population of older hypertensive females, AEX improved insulin sensitivity and lowered blood pressure without a reduction in plasma TNF-alpha levels.","inCitations":["e1150a9d913f82ee7c5cd43b151082ddadba7480","69c8e2dcc429e36675fd17b01a815353e7aa63b5","24421599909c704b8a1a77b40cf5e4c717e35138","c01a28ff7929c3f13f1ec39e564f6552b9f80fe9"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Aerobic exercise training improves insulin sensitivity independent of plasma tumor necrosis factor-alpha levels in older female hypertensives.","doi":"10.1053/meta.2002.35585","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1053/meta.2002.35585","venue":"Metabolism: clinical and experimental"}

Accurately assessing RV volume and systolic function is a challenge in day-to-day clinical practice due to its complex geometry. Tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) and systolic excursion velocity (S') have been reviewed to further assess their suitability and objectivity in evaluating RV function. Multiple studies have validated their diagnostic and prognostic values in numerous pathologic conditions. Diminished longitudinal contraction after cardiothoracic surgery is a well-known phenomenon, but it is not well validated. Despite significant reduction in RV performance along the long-axis assessed by TAPSE and S' after cardiac surgery, RV ejection fractions did not change as well as the left ventricular parameters and exercise capacity. RV contractile patterns were markedly altered with decreased longitudinal shortening and increased transverse shortening, which are likely resulted from the septal damage during cardiac surgery. The septum is essential for RV performance due to its oblique fiber orientation. This allows ventricular twisting, which is a vital mechanism against increased pulmonary vascular resistance. The septum function along with TAPSE and S' should be adequately assessed during cardiac surgery, and evidence of septal dysfunction should lead to reevaluation of myocardial protection methods.","inCitations":["12beb42945309a719ea914ae5c5df22f42c59054","6a8bc88d34774bd32859e846849cb8e2c102f2fe","9a6522e64fc2a2a4e15b3bf22b9311590ba35a38","eb9847b65c0fbe47c3fa057b8cd4c81ae366ae39","009d4eaf9a05686acfdea0ca1cd32b77c094ce08","fe8518fbea3b75213983cca45f393e987be85286","16f3a83136b0c87efeda4a1bf5b1e72c5da03cac","80b8c884572932aa32f4682559fb57d145baa1b2","70dfae1b53a92af69aa7f0abe5296cb295f9349c","08442c64f17c6cca1fb27ddeb68c03836d5aab03"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Altered right ventricular contractile pattern after cardiac surgery: monitoring of septal function is essential.","doi":"10.1111/echo.12657","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1111/echo.12657","venue":"Echocardiography"}

Given these complexities, limited data is available to suggest the appropriate timing of palliative care involvement in the treatment of cancer. Our study aims to describe the referral patterns of inpatient palliative care consultations in advanced cancer patients in a tertiary care center.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA retrospective review was performed. Inpatient palliative consultation was obtained in cancer patients from January 1, 2014 to December 31, 2014. Descriptive statistics are used in data analysis.\n\n\nRESULTS\nInpatient palliative care consults (IPCC) were obtained for 245 cancer patients admitted to Saint Louis University Hospital. Of the 245, 130 were male (53.06%), 115 were female (46.93%), 128 were White (52.24%), and 114 were Black (46.53%). Newly diagnosed patients with cancer during the current admission were 79(32.24%). 57 (23.26%) patients were admitted to the Intensive care unit during hospitalization. A total of 39(15.91%) patients died in the hospital; among those who died in the hospital 34 had ICU stay during the hospitalization or died in the ICU (87%). Malignancies most common were lung 71(28.97%) followed by pancreatic-biliary 33(13.4%), lymphoma and leukemia 22(8.9%), hepatocellular carcinoma 18(7.34%), head and neck 16 (6.5%), and upper GI 16 (6.5%). Disposition at discharge included home hospice 67 (28.3%), hospice in facility 27(11%), home without hospice 71(28.9%), facility without hospice 39(15.9%).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAccording to the National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization as of 2013, 7.0% hospice patients die in acute care hospitals. Our data shows 15.9% who received IPCC died in the hospital with 87% dying in ICU. This is likely due to delays in the initiation of palliative care consultation as outpatient leading to increase strain on tertiary referral centers. In another study 22% of eligible Black patients received IPCC. Our rate of IPCC in Blacks was 46.5%. This highlights the disparity in access to outpatient palliative care in this population. Future efforts should be made to promote early outpatient palliative services to reduce ICU admissions, hospital re-admissions and healthcare costs.","inCitations":["69cb4a855656a9873efc79a220cefb248ad86d19"],"pdfUrls":["https://assets.cureus.com/uploads/original_article/pdf/12159/1537568141-20180921-18087-x6xvrx.pdf"],"title":"Impact of an Inpatient Palliative Care Consultation in Terminally Ill Cancer Patients","doi":"10.1200/jco.2016.34.3_suppl.77","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1200/jco.2016.34.3_suppl.77","venue":"Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology"}

The proposed solution is based on a set of parameterized T-line structures, which include single and two coupled microstrip lines with optional side shielding, accompanied by compact true transient models. The models account for frequency dependent skin and proximity effects, while maintaining passivity requirements due to their pure RLC nature. The signal bandwidth supported by the models covers a range from DC to 100 GHz. The models are currently verified in terms of S-parameter data against hardware (up to 40 GHz) and against EM solver (up to 100 GHz). This methodology has already been used for several designs implemented in SiGe (silicon-germanium) BiCMOS technology.","inCitations":["844cced965516b5e264263e9367e5a08d59013cd","4261e5656fd3167d6fa7e39f695dc61d5d37a736","08fddfb9a04facbec7644ce4fce52d39198da25e","5002ee1bec7249fa96099fab241f14cc6b31bd3a","7e4d41a4073d05baafdc126a8ddc4b3242866e1e","dbb32a3a5c9b175dc0d0878efada8d0a148c6133","6871827ea3b950b9c532d7167ee25e8d43fe62f0","ce3efa5bed5c07f37e804d121739955048b67e23","d4e366ccece8277724ba989de7ac68e364ec5a6a","899b46d7bc29dcf6b460704251c18c2e8d28c763","fc1f43e46bcc3f9ee123232003cf1a6dbaf386fd","e10028d2f1d1100103fecc1a307d2fc919d1e822","b626ab8a192019ea227e41982558f81c20993e95","e8debd44a11464e4b471fcb20407c609065e49ab","e47501d7325078ba405980555404fa566a538cd2","071cf6f7db47d126cd8648b40c0b7bd9de880570","e7358e1988e4267949ca4ce69f8782ecb01dbe4d","14fdbdfee6ac08321694433bfbd57a05a8d6f149"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.cecs.uci.edu/~papers/compendium94-03/papers/2002/date02/pdffiles/08c_1.pdf","http://www.research.ibm.com/haifa/projects/verification/poppins/papers/date_goren_d.pdf","http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=874479"],"title":"An interconnect-aware methodology for analog and mixed signal design, based on high bandwidth (over 40 GHz) on-chip transmission line approach","doi":"10.1109/DATE.2002.998391","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DATE.2002.998391","venue":"Proceedings 2002 Design, Automation and Test in Europe Conference and Exhibition"}

Herein, we describe a case of recurrent primary canaliculitis that was completely cured by 4-snip punctoplasty and canalicular curettage. Patient concerns: A 53-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital with chief complaints of epiphora, discharge, eyelid flare up, and swelling near the inferior lacrimal punctum in the left eye, which initially presented 6 months earlier. Diagnosis: Based on the aforementioned symptoms, the patient was initially diagnosed with bacterial conjunctivitis at a local ophthalmologic clinic and used antibiotic eye drops for 6 months. However, her symptoms did not improve and they worsened at 2 weeks prior to admission. She was subsequently diagnosed with chronic dacryocystitis and referred to our hospital for surgical treatment. Slit lamp examination results showed conjunctival congestion in the inner corner of the left eye, along with eyelid flare up, swelling near the inferior lacrimal punctum, and yellowish discharge and concretion from the lacrimal punctal orifice. Furthermore, punctal regurgitation was not observed in the lacrimal sac compression test. Thus, the patient was diagnosed with primary canaliculitis on the basis of her clinical symptoms and laboratory findings. Interventions: Based on the diagnosis of primary canaliculitis, 1-snip punctoplasty and canalicular curettage were performed, and the patient was prescribed oral antibiotics for 2 weeks together with topical antibiotics for 4 weeks. Overall, the patient's symptoms improved after surgery, but epiphora and yellowish discharge from the lacrimal punctal orifice developed again 2 months after surgery during outpatient follow-up. Based on the diagnosis of recurrent primary canaliculitis, 4-snip punctoplasty and canalicular curettage were performed, and the patient was prescribed oral antibiotics for 2 weeks together with topical antibiotics for 4 weeks. Outcomes: Over a 6-month follow-up period, the symptoms disappeared completely and no other findings were observed. Lessons: Four-snip punctoplasty and canalicular curettage are simple clinical procedures that can minimize the recurrence rate of primary canaliculitis. Hence, 4-snip punctoplasty and canalicular curettage should be considered as the 1st-line treatment for primary canaliculitis and recurrent cases.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"A case report on complete cure of recurrent primary canaliculitis by 4-snip punctoplasty and canalicular curettage","doi":"10.1097/MD.0000000000013508","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1097/MD.0000000000013508","venue":"Medicine"}

Whereas an appreciation of verbal incongruity has been a hallmark of older preschooler humor (e.g., McGhee, 1989), more recently, other violations of expectations and clowning also have been identified as ubiquitous during the first two years of life (e.g., Loizou, 2005; Reddy, 2001). We examined the pragmatics of one 30-month-old girl's humor, and determined how it interactively harnessed the cognitive, linguistic, and socio-emotional resources available to her negotiations within her familial context. Using the methodology of a Day in the Life of a toddler in early childhood (Gillen et al., 2006), the child's entire waking day was videotaped, and all interactions were transcribed and analyzed. We identified many instances of humor, and categorized them into four major types: clowning, teasing, jokes and playful language, and physical actions. Humor served both socio-emotional and cognitive-linguistic functions, and we confirmed Reddy's (2001) finding that early humor is interpersonally co-constructed: When humor operates within the child's inter-mental development zone (Mercer, 2000), it serves to inform her or his intra-mental growth; the inter-mental precedes and enables the intra-mental.","inCitations":["aed5ff0a9c16e4937ca0070a94a64d1fb73e66a4","0f72062b3824d3a14aa0f29974b8815d1da0be03","1dcda1bc7faa41388d9f4279961b221a596f7d6f","b118b443efde12302cad408c97a1ff17e55353ea","6ce37ade0dc6f8aebdf45f76d61e4c9d0d600eef","dcea8c46a9bad40ee2e6b985fcfb36e1346d9291","d7fc085ed07d689b57d1d7b17c63d62de22e53c6","d40b46aa0bcb1f53ebc949fb69b6a0fc47a29390","2c49e580b01b178eb4445bcd605fabd57df38e2f","9e5accca82fac65ed4ddc5eabc22d4cd577f4cee","d4d4b038c6702cf92922f8c5a6b5e37bd7c1d121","519b47559ef35a39663433135d9d84cbeb070e0b"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"“Let Me Show You a Trick!”: A Toddler's Use of Humor To Explore, Interpret, and Negotiate Her Familial Environment During a Day in the Life","doi":"10.1080/02568540809594642","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1080/02568540809594642","venue":""}

The upstream and downstream of MACC1 form a delicate regulatory network that supports its tumorigenic role in cancers. Multiple functions of MACC1 have been discovered in many cancers. In gastric cancer (GC), MACC1 has been shown to be involved in oncogenesis and tumor progression. MACC1 overexpression adversely affects the clinical outcomes of GC patients. Regarding the mechanism of action of MACC1 in GC, studies have shown that it promotes the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and accelerates cancer metastasis. MACC1 is involved in many hallmarks of GC in addition to metastasis. MACC1 promotes vasculogenic mimicry (VM) via TWIST1/2, and VM increases the tumor blood supply, which is necessary for tumor progression. MACC1 also facilitates GC lymphangiogenesis by upregulating extracellular secretion of VEGF-C/D, indicating that MACC1 may be an important player in GC lymphatic dissemination. Additionally, MACC1 supports GC growth under metabolic stress by enhancing the Warburg effect. In conclusion, MACC1 participates in multiple biological processes inside and outside of GC cells, making it an important mediator of the tumor microenvironment.","inCitations":["103541d6d60c26eda7a413392659a45daf34f10f","25ba0d7b5e74c0ec6486bb97afce955dae08251e","c895c9ad1271320fe7344964a0b824afd9826ec8","ee12034fa4ae40975fde5f6abebb483ee9dd38cb","8b05d24343c46a76f20a42564e0a2364163380bc","5aea6acf96c6c021cb23cb73e8e9c7d260e558fe","8cd581d40ca1eb81437f7099625b9812b994175f","99997493815547945555a69da07cfb44ebaf7157","7c6abfb27a5d690c65fc475a913e241d8a457562","9eec4e3cbefce77304a3b7e805d4441c9ddeed8c"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Metastasis-associated in colon cancer-1 in gastric cancer: Beyond metastasis.","doi":"10.3748/wjg.v22.i29.6629","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.3748/wjg.v22.i29.6629","venue":"World journal of gastroenterology"}

Both spatial autocorrelation (the tendency for adjacent locations to be more similar than distant ones) and non-stationarity (the variation in modelled relationships over space) are likely to be common properties of ecological systems. This paper focuses on non-stationarity and uses two local techniques, geographically weighted regression (GWR) and varying coefficient modelling (VCM), to assess its impact on model predictions. We extend two published studies, one on the presence–absence of calandra larks in Spain and the other on bird species richness in Britain, to compare GWR and VCM with the more usual global generalized linear modelling (GLM) and generalized additive modelling (GAM). For the calandra lark data, GWR and VCM produced better-fitting models than GLM or GAM. VCM in particular gave significantly reduced spatial autocorrelation in the model residuals. GWR showed that individual predictors became stationary at different spatial scales, indicating that distributions are influenced by ecological processes operating over multiple scales. VCM was able to predict occurrence accurately on independent data from the same geographical area as the training data but not beyond, whereas the GAM produced good results on all areas. Individual predictions from the local methods often differed substantially from the global models. For the species richness data, VCM and GWR produced far better predictions than ordinary regression. Our analyses suggest that modellers interpolating data to produce maps for practical actions (e.g. conservation) should consider local methods, whereas they should not be used for extrapolation to new areas. We argue that local methods are complementary to global methods, revealing details of habitat associations and data properties which global methods average out and miss.","inCitations":["11e711115433b4b0db3a38aa9160978d3d49ccf7","32e69302be569a64a6a5ad59a69c760457933142","6563534f18f6fec4ad20aae52654172b8fb7be01","15fa58f93384a056af78855872674e409105999c","b8c7e6c351ab48248bef339d88ee6bf4b77e07f0","9ee4f503079d4997ff589e6d74cc2b7a8d69739f","5685112f2e4830dd9872d2b2743276f7af221e54","158b2a40d25074dc37400db55af40a294a7c0a01","90b51d131e3a48873eb085f1b2a7c96488bc5426","865aad81b04d712554b7e3242601cfd4e4d48f8b","e1c767246cb3cd6630e90352afbaa9a2ff1ec8f1","a677a966907c988d4d1951443cede7eee3f2ef8c","00e84e304006d23f3884e9271998058796e79b62","14bbd53f7590fdbca9bb52e75e8fab0934b911d0","4b3be1142775cc7daff81b8cb0ec1088e2fa356c","5717167f4085a2663762609334ab0e588c973ed8","07beb69f92c15aa8867b9922b5301ae57b1fd67b","9951f37e310508ae6fef54d84835fc195f0a545c","7842904c11a73270e4774fe29cbccaa35da3d4a2","2f4da624f549d677d7731cb0a4391e9668488bbb","00df3f3f5d32f0af32c4f884844e081c23dcec28","8dd0ef74d4781ab33491dc673843dd2f896682f1","a25342fad8f228320cbc684aa92eff333374f0c3","986e91af569e4fd5c6054ded7bea9f22a207ff33","8bac2fb519f845ff45a20b35c04129b3c06bc6f8","43ef2d1fe5c86b5ffbc00372a1d166f181349e24","92f4cca0071b7648d84262c9bb4a6191be9891b7","1715fdc4df6774d95ed63f3feb58fa93a84dbed7","b5c9e03ca0367d2a7a6f1948dbd1def0d7cc7fb3","2e55196466515e751e38c5f8adf36356b6eb16a3","162304e80dbcc6fab813c4c3e672b873f5c108d3","7f889431d1ec381a3b9cda20c854b021b0b1f9ff","d9f2fac80943d2814f11e9dcb8c5b593e8abc34c","7e2ec844626a37b4132038de0193d3bc8f9b890a","0970dbb7c476fff30e8745ee3f61b2ad78fea5f5","a466f441ef47853cc9ba338c5e187e7720aa97db","dcee7a9def1fde682fa4a2781ba1fced99d19e72","0363366cebe0ba2acea89147ffa4916401c8c176","d98ba020d33b930b1a69c54c667252b573da82a4","864b3ea4888421f0ed8944611e219a55df4f04c9","ee2464c3b8d9a4f112c8b0000e0d0f4aa637496e","14b03b7c66da7a30de8343e0a96a077dc631a87b","ae0db02108547c011c596fd15d6b73e8da806a16","9b60fbff819a7bcc63c5de5fd27a4db41e18e788","495c1025e0e0bd7e42dc512b6738e0feb45acf6a","cfd2655cd5551457cc67133bac7749f64b6ee287","258522eab5c837f26a8829c4821a8f2bc7df1bb8","15891d4f4507b5b572aae17282f7885efe26c871","d659be873d93bf70bd108869d11b89bf86c2df14","8d328dbb13edaec4d1346a5446911e060b9dbd0f","1291f8d1bfa9e1905f32f577e8112fc915c14214","e1cff5631cda87b18bdd9d1ac18aa068b9b618e2","c98c6e52c2c6131bb661de69791d5496d883952a","b26fda91fa09ed90cba9bd0b03c5cb09c9bcd455","9ad794a701633a6b902daac3a3d7d90c19050cb6","ae4ec8edeb8c305d71e27d5f2af073948303520c","db63924a873504f4f52e8d64f1c076bce781116c","e95fff8b8d83abf46d4d8dacb978c97f748c835b","bada9861c0096d246199dc42163af978b32ba2b1","4c5161d8754cc02a968478a467df9479f23eadf8","1ba08d3ae06b1ec0512eeba4ef36cbe734304486","3ebe69988133fba14a72cc566cd0d852c519aa9b","cd91e0b4cdc561928a1f4c8940293214f02cfb9b","d21d2a615c7b92f1b1796e0cb357a4529b9209c4","10eda9999600fd3a438181d9c901ec0d74715016","e833a484669fee8fd87bec0abb49772d957875e4","0e1565d18e6ca0a7fd1e75fde99a4cd7e2010551","b92b598767b0c6805cd60f0edcac5374755966b4","8d8ecb25bd4a607f57c922fefe7f3ca2564d83ec","27c93ae536fda8787ac5f1d8691b1877a16e4ce7","7e614e08ed66b0b8adc8d398aaed0070e986b3dd","b459a385019f005de945a93c035ce172ec0fd61a","86ad4ec28e9e3c557aac0ab8abc2b958de382652","a5db8cdb8feffd2b7e51f6ebca8ad732ae34954f","120fc37f5d6c0046bfdc5bf2bde6cca7e5935fbf","902dc65fd432d3eb6e3fecaed5dcfa4cb1355db3","bd979edaf805cea584e54fa397db1c7f40373a9d","f8c28370ab4524602b8d37d9d4714eba7d8c7e30","3d74e5be8b9907302cb0335f2aeb2d2a563aff5b","578fea08de90af55f3d0f3cedf0e04b921fde3c2","91cc92ee0d847f83380ce19c6a407cbc29e9ca3d","a86ddd4139a95e77525205c0b8c7e06851fdcd49","09b6440227960a488cd6d4a6a43c39e2f7961067","970e537cf2d100482f1d96edccd8c541471b709b","f24d250d40025748c8975c1798f59f8317d03ef4","79829d9f52022943519d8153ef822f444a338ed2","90e30f853b99443993e4399729faad6895c88402","7e2e93d2b0cadf8a7c56b742d421ef22b3269ac8","4fcd24802f332e302f64c721320ad7381c78214f"],"pdfUrls":["https://susanasuarezseoane.files.wordpress.com/2008/01/divdistributions2007-abstract.pdf"],"title":"Non-stationarity and local approaches to modelling the distributions of wildlife","doi":"10.1111/j.1472-4642.2007.00344.x","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1472-4642.2007.00344.x","venue":""}
