With respect to the latter, schizophrenic patients typically exhibit impaired prepulse inhibition (PPI) of startle, a reflex that can be modeled in many animal species. Certain strains of mice naturally display poor PPI and it was recently suggested that these mice might offer a new way to screen for novel antipsychotic compounds. To examine whether H3 receptor antagonists might enhance PPI in mice with naturally occurring deficits, DBA/2 and C57BL/6 were tested in a startle paradigm with three prepulse intensities: 5, 10 and 15 dB above background. Both thioperamide and ciproxifan enhanced PPI in the DBA/2 strain; thioperamide also showed a trend towards enhancing PPI in C57BL/6. Risperidone, an atypical antipsychotic, enhanced PPI in both the DBA/2 and the C57BL/6 strain. These data confirm previous reports describing a natural deficit in PPI in some mouse strains that is amenable to enhancement with known antipsychotics. Further, these data suggest that H3 receptor antagonists/inverse agonists have anti-psychotic potential for disorders such as schizophrenia.","inCitations":["d57b70192422b3ffc91fede5e09f4883354ed7fb","b5789337eb03ae20ac1ee2f434384f1e6ce90214","afe69ad6322856783b89465d1601102b514974c0","720dba4556d90d910feebcee496f8e10221ebfd6","14039c53b624a4460a47435ee744da1c3a06d4af","2997777d3a3adfe62892002a2686a202307267c7","7d13bb8e8dcab1a11f758e71b0cdcc976d28b48b","8368a36392f9eda2bb62c0531ea3e4964f3d7ad3","ff854c1aa6bb763a4e591fbebb1383b76ced6f7f","a7779cc4c66ae0f12e5b3d7b768e3203cfa450da","5f5ee8a6d234f0c7ea9c64a9fe15170981f54587","562ffe066dbf8d778e21250dd4505794aa61e781","6968a403f4a772c549ba1dc43f8a12e6eafa5cb2","974479c400cc4df157aad21a0ef1e6d220a63107","7ccc7bbf68cac7e73bf65dc4faec909791b6f46d","cf1810c6459455947e395567666d7804877d24fa","9e3dfbf0ef3e24bea41e32054d4a14400f71869b","dc7683da6edca072a9b59611f1bc21e65509a248","b94d792f3387331e1d77e2cd5dcfb085668a199f","4fbe26067124d78395d0ede54ecaf17ec7089028","477d4337fa6621883a4af60da428e8cc82827f23","8c2db1c1765f782850e38d41130d7e31a8ac1c8e","9550ab76842096fb113e594e88ba85d76b445009","1fb45cc370605cfcf7d42d9190f1d5e6fb00f6b7","e9edf7e9bf3f3957ada9bb36bf1269fc06bb79ba","89cd0994f7beddf58332496bae25e3bb1678d718","0167cc2a73f7bde842ec83ea0d99daa6c2ad3470","25d45d8e3bbda7c8b84b7112490533628d45a888","ccb9a8f0e4a63a92ebf251c4bc62aab7a0e8d1e6","74ce1e7fe0d22c557ea06db2010bd76005753648","ef3996aedb0d61644a10e8907366bd581a37a019","481a2c2d0987628af8c4262f43a53c87b7762f6d","119f39e2da6ec45c5937254e0ad61b7a359649fb","e4a488b9f0263f9a1f803e3e5a0f084baddab99c","13e59cfb7198cb7aa61d292d0257f9b7538ad8a4","4d3c3b1a7cea8af6fa059fd66f87b7e56f75cb1c"],"pdfUrls":["https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166432803004224","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166432803004224?dgcid=api_sd_search-api-endpoint"],"title":"Enhancement of prepulse inhibition of startle in mice by the H3 receptor antagonists thioperamide and ciproxifan","doi":"10.1016/j.bbr.2003.11.001","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbr.2003.11.001","venue":"Behavioural Brain Research"}

Aerodynamic forces are also imparted on an impeller blade, which varies with time and position. These two forces play different roles during compressor events. Damage accumulated from these events results in the fatigue failure of impeller material and structure. Therefore, it is important to design an impeller against dynamic and fatigue failure. The finite element method has been used in the study of impeller fracture mechanics and is regarded as an important tool in the design and analysis of material and structures. Novel axial composite impellers, manufactured through filament winding technology, were invented and studied at Michigan State University. These impellers will be used to compress water vapor so as to use it as a refrigerant. In this study dynamic and fatigue behavior of two types of composite impellers 8B and 8C, were analyzed using commercial code ANSYS. Firstly, load cases were identified calculated and evaluated. Static analysis was then performed with a full 3-D finite element model. The critical zone where fatigue failure begins was extracted and used to determine life assessment positions. Secondly, aerodynamic forces imparted on the blade were obtained from FLUENT, so that damage from dynamic stresses could be calculated. Finally, based on the FEM and FLUENT simulation results, a linear damage accumulation model was employed as a damage estimation rule to predict life of the two composite impellers. A conservative life of 6498 h for 8B was calculated by this method, as was a life of 5435 h of 8C. Based on the method, safe fatigue life reduces for about 32% in case of 8B and 40% in case of 8C compared with conventional approaches where aerodynamic forces are omitted.","inCitations":["fe910f8d667787769b7322953f8a61a8fcdd5b62","64c5eb790f276a2ecfdcd83a49b2a826aab1f8e5"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Simulation of fatigue failure in composite axial compressor blades","doi":"10.1016/j.matdes.2010.11.051","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.matdes.2010.11.051","venue":""}

These techniques are not absolute guarantee for a good cosmetic result and therefore some patients will have cosmetic sequelae secondary to poor surgical planning, the effects of adjuvant treatments or the need for resection greater than originally planned. The high frequency of these cosmetic sequelae in oncology practice makes it necessary to classify them for optimal surgical planning. The aim of this paper is to present a classification of cosmetic sequelae after oncoplastic procedures to identify those factors that are crucial to its prevention. This classification contains 4 groups: breast contour deformities, asymmetries, alterations in nipple-areola complex (NAC) and defects in the three dimensional structure of the breast. A significant group of these sequelae (asymmetries and deformities) are associated with breast irradiation and need an accurate information process with patients to set realistic expectations about cosmetic results. Finally, there is another group of sequelae (NAC disorders and three-dimensional structure) that are related to poor planning and deficiencies in surgical approach, therefore specific training is essential for learning these surgical techniques.","inCitations":["7dcdd24bfb18f4f85be2f625414160f1b26ae529","69dadf844247b4d9aa4104f2b0fe6886b0c910fe","088e738a4a608377046113c2534ad8deafa65c2f","f876635544b52b89018e5178498fce02b7d68e6b","fc6d8ff34eac7b13b0296eae82ddb1e65388e78d"],"pdfUrls":["https://www.elsevier.es/index.php?p=revista&pRevista=pdf-simple&pii=S2173507714005341","http://appswl.elsevier.es/publicaciones/item/pdf?estadoItem=S300&idApp=UINPBA00004N&idiomaItem=en&origen=zonadelectura&pii=S2173507714005341&urlApp=http://www.elsevier.es&web=zonadelectura"],"title":"Cosmetic Sequelae After Oncoplastic Surgery of the Breast.

This paper forecasts the number of containers to be transported through long-haul legs for the incoming trip of an intercontinental shipping service. Considering the clear and unique container slot booking patterns in the historical data, three different forecasting models are developed, including piecewise linear regression model, autoregressive model, and artificial neural network model. These three models are further combined into an integrated model to simultaneously incorporate their merits in formulating the container slot booking patterns. Test results show satisfactory forecasting precisions of the integrated forecasting model.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Integrated method for forecasting container slot booking in intercontinental liner shipping service","doi":"10.1007/s10696-018-9324-z","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10696-018-9324-z","venue":""}

The first approach relies on the use of statistical principle with application of well-known evaluation methods. The other bases on quasi essential graph (QEG), an extension of essential graph (EG), that is a presentative graph for all BN of the population. In QEG, each edge is statistically weighted in two parts: (1) undirected part that represents the power of the relationship; (2) arrow part that represents the reliability of the orientation. Results of application to the both simulated and real-world problems show that these proposed approaches are the others helpful solutions for the problem of edge orientation and for the visualization of results of evaluation methods.","inCitations":["9a0fd4f344144a082fac4fd237fb206556bcdec5"],"pdfUrls":["https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00657482/document"],"title":"On Evaluation of a Population of Bayesian Networks","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

of their mechanistic differences, all posit monitoring mechanisms that share general computational principles with action monitoring. This perspective, if accurate, would predict that many electrophysiological signatures of performance monitoring should be recoverable from language production tasks. In this study, we examined both error-related and feedback-related EEG indices of performance monitoring in the context of a typing-to-dictation task. To disentangle the contribution of the external from internal monitoring processes, we created a condition where participants immediately saw the word they typed (the immediate-feedback condition) versus one in which displaying the word was delayed until the end of the trial (the delayed-feedback condition). The removal of immediate visual feedback prompted a stronger reliance on internal monitoring processes, which resulted in lower correction rates and a clear error-related negativity. Compatible with domain-general monitoring views, an error positivity was only recovered under conditions where errors were detected or had a high likelihood of being detected. Examination of the feedback-related indices (feedback-related negativity and frontocentral positivity) revealed a two-stage process of integration of internal and external information. The recovery of a full range of well-established EEG indices of action monitoring in a language production task strongly endorses domain-general views of monitoring. Such indices, in turn, are helpful in understanding how information from different monitoring channels are combined.","inCitations":["caa2f2561430e96adf7b5afc8e9affcaf7c2727f"],"pdfUrls":["https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/psychology/nozarilab/papers/2020PinetNozari.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1162/jocn_a_01500"],"title":"Electrophysiological Correlates of Monitoring in Typing with and without Visual Feedback","doi":"10.1162/jocn_a_01500","sources":["Medline","DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1162/jocn_a_01500","venue":"Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience"}

A single intraperitoneal injection of 2-4 mg/kg of ACM augments the cytolytic activity by spleen and peritoneal exudate cells of normal mice and spleen cells depleted of nylon-adherent cells and peritoneal exudate cells of tumor-bearing mice. In contrast to the stimulatory effect of NK-cell activity by low doses of ACM, a single injection of 8 mg/kg of this agent leads to depression in the level of NK-cell activity in both normal and tumor-bearing animals. We suggest that the mechanism through which the ACM enhances NK-cell activity may be through the deletion of a suppressor cell population acting on the NK cells.","inCitations":["626ab8e7516339a8a94015d1750d055135d71384","65e5220f9a63876394367456828495a09b63a3d1"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Enhancement of NK-cell activity in normal and tumor-bearing mice after administration of aclacinomycin.","doi":"10.1159/000238406","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1159/000238406","venue":"Chemotherapy"}

A partir de este esbozo genealogico, examinaremos las redefiniciones de conceptos como materia, agencia en tanto capacidad de accion, discursividad e intencionalidad y las relacionaremos con sus efectos en la ecocritica y en la etica. EnglishThe proliferation of studies bearing on the intellectual movement known as the \"new materialisms\" evinces that a material turn is becoming an important paradigm in environmental humanities. Ranging from social and science studies, feminism, to anthropology, geography, environmental philosophies and animal studies, this approach is bringing innovative ways of considering matter and material relations that, coupled with reflections on agency, text, and narrativity, are going to impact ecocriticism in an unprecedented way. In consideration of the relevance of this debate, we would like to draw for Ecozon@'s readers an introductory map of the new paradigm and introduce what can be called \"material ecocriticism.\" We will illustrate what we consider to be its main features, situating them in the conceptual horizons of the new materialisms. From this genealogical sketch, we will examine the re-definitions of concepts like matter, agency, discursivity, and intentionality, with regard to their effects on ecocriticism and in terms of their ethical perspectives.","inCitations":["37cf621c7d5051cd5db0b72326410be5f30a7431","d4293cab3efe6c539f1a81ca769ba79fdb06a316","3129e04e3d9516475c77d481ec8976878e39ca9f","022d31cd0fa185cbb52e9942602685daa4aa1ac4","d5a86bf2c3b40d75e3c56590e71b36b46803bc41","337493a29950728ddff46e6d50c9c48a37ecaff5","2e5e11e4c8f4dafa9a63e973b159cd4cf896c213","0261764db3295e9637cbd8a5533f2c4cf41e96aa","411aa2b064902e5f11daf3a7a46f0b43739c37fb","5f0c9d2b943b3c2dc89dab1d45c1341447181740","0ef6c3aed48599670430c8eeaf5db0fdd74c8452","bc2531924a1f1e3e367238da6b7fcee51e2f4fea","77f177b58bc70b2d587e7c9e89bee12d874c14f2","6e737b340aa45f77e46769334764b739bf699992","7dde59a9d10426ccedc84cf221e7b4b5d1ebc148","b47acfbb779015234867ea74cb6dcd3e9c07404d","f157695d5d17731e749329c021db3090e8d9af85","2188810ff92b1c1866600a4ce309360d220c3047","5b6fe26f84a347f7d6eee0bd92e65503029cc799","8b9a0b0c84cc3e646bd5fbc58658e35bcb6e4724","121cbb1348b9272acef8297e0709468207f90a05","6452cd40650bb6d95c7c9be6d82244801ff48c6b","c9ac04f2c3f13a73d84fb44c9f59b32469ac6906","164210c73fa324c45e73245efa83f9e1c82f7808"],"pdfUrls":["https://ebuah.uah.es/dspace/bitstream/handle/10017/20856/material_Iovino-Oppermann_ecozona_2012_N1.pdf?isAllowed=y&sequence=1"],"title":"Material ecocriticism: materiality, agency, and models of narrativity","doi":"10.37536/ecozona.2012.3.1.452","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.37536/ecozona.2012.3.1.452","venue":""}

The method and its variants are named \"EGASP, an acronym for \"EfficiencyGuided Addition, Subtraction, and Permutation\".

Manufacturer submissions.\n\n\nREVIEW METHODS\nA systematic review of the literature on clinical and cost-effectiveness was undertaken. The quality of selected randomised controlled trials (RCTs) was assessed using the Jadad criteria, and of selected systematic reviews using criteria developed by the NHS Centre for Reviews and Dissemination. Economic evaluations were quality assessed by their internal validity (i.e. the methods used) using a series of relevant questions, and external validity (i.e. generalisability of the economic study to the population of interest) by modified standard criteria. The clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of ICDs for arrhythmias were synthesised through a narrative review with full tabulation of results of all included studies.\n\n\nRESULTS\nEight RCTs, two systematic reviews and a meta-analysis met the inclusion criteria of the review. The RCTs were of variable quality, with most trials having a Jadad quality score of 1/5 or 2/5, owing to the nature of comparing a device with drug therapy and the impossibility of double-blinding. The outcome measure of interest was mortality, which was reported as all-cause mortality in most trials and sudden cardiac death in some trials. Eleven economic evaluations of ICDs for arrhythmias were identified. None were shown to have high internal and external validity. One unpublished study relevant to the UK was identified. The evidence suggests that ICDs reduce mortality in patients with previous ventricular arrest or symptomatic sustained ventricular arrhythmias, in patients who have not had a previous sudden cardiac episode or previous ventricular arrhythmia but have reduced left ventricular function due to coronary artery disease with asymptomatic non-sustained ventricular arrhythmia and sustained tachycardia that could be induced electrophysiologically, and in some patients with severe left ventricular dysfunction (ejection fraction 30%) after myocardial infarction. QoL data are inconsistent but suggest that there is impaired QoL in patients who received numerous shocks from implanted devices. Studies show that ICDs improve survival compared with drug treatment, but with considerably increased cost. Incremental cost per life-year gained ranges from 27,000 US dollars to 213,543 Can dollars and incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year from 71,700 US dollars to 558,000 US dollars in the published literature.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe use of ICDs in the UK is increasing, but the technology is still under-utilised compared with other developed countries. Extending the current indications to patients with prior myocardial infarction and depressed heart function would impact on costs and service provision. Further research is needed on the risk stratification of patients in whom ICDs are most likely to be clinically and cost-effective. An evaluation of shock frequency on QoL is also required.","inCitations":["12651820a5613df073c95bf0a7b594c9f3ce1eff","4f5716a2c2a4bf602769873b847b89c6e5a7ef36","6045c7757f7e2b773e7389c1b201297159b5ce1b","15aa73af99889c0aa0b79868349697678f2732d7","165e05d32eb08da9c6f539984cb296e7990263c5","eb04741e8b4eb05f32707b3f8846b1d058e455d4","724c66e21defd6ec1a00265897d4ffeefc65f52f","39a20233ce3e65aba1e53cd4e716007df7b1d9b1","dbac8d291841dccc6484182d8d8404e2ad3ad3ce","9b353bee351dbf35035d6ce2495ecb85e8d054d8","5d7190f71d262b2b17acdf7754f0279ea872d814","fddb3941510adff5d86d6682e2d9a6b6a56c53fb","c9373c041885660c6a39266cd727ce7797ef57b6","9e92583d6496af2da65fd9ea67cdcf3ddc308a6d","8026c7a09cf42b2bbffddb55443849437b598183","7ba644d2c41f67e9ff3e120b8694026e27e514b5","2d8f4f730e82411f7cb917bcb5cd5467ce4db4fe","8fadea15b5e39e05f228d51b3a39fc25f18232d9","005f73895d9dd37f396888f119dbaae451163ca3"],"pdfUrls":["https://njl-admin.nihr.ac.uk/document/download/2004936","https://njl-admin.nihr.ac.uk/document/download/2004986"],"title":"The clinical and cost-effectiveness of implantable cardioverter defibrillators: a systematic review.","doi":"10.3310/hta9360","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.3310/hta9360","venue":"Health technology assessment"}

'It should be like breath on the surface of a pane of glass.' Through an innovative manner of handling paint, a group of American artists around 1900 created deceptively simple canvases that convey images of shimmering transience, visions suggested rather than delineated. Focusing on this singular aesthetic characteristic - softness - \"Like Breath on Glass\" explores this painterly phenomenon through works by fifteen important artists, including Whistler, George Inness, William Merritt Chase, Thomas Wilmer Dewing, John Twachtman, and Eduard Steichen.Leading scholars in American art consider a wide variety of topics: the very different motives - technical, social, religious, and scientific - that prompted these artists in their experimentation; their materials; their techniques for creating the appearance of effortlessness; period notions of 'the vague' through art and writing; and the revival of 'painting softly' in the 1950s and 1960s. This beautifully produced and lavishly illustrated catalogue highlights a surprisingly understudied yet important aspect of American cultural and painterly achievement.","inCitations":["141e93466d09ce0bc852d041746b17196951a861","44622f9d0f820ee6ade5ee31dac8c7a4af320230"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.clarkart.edu/exhibitions/whistler/content/whistler-sample-images.pdf","http://www.clarkart.edu/exhibitions/whistler/content/whistler-exhibition-brochure.pdf"],"title":"Like Breath on Glass: Whistler, Inness, and the Art of Painting Softly","doi":"10.5860/choice.46-3061","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.5860/choice.46-3061","venue":""}

These data correlate well with interpretations from pollen diagrams of climatic and vegetational changes during the same period. The evidence indicates that a large dune field was active in the area during this time.

Plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) was used to grow silicon dioxide pillars to electrically separate overhung aluminum electrodes from an aluminum ground plane.

Biofilms can be defined as an accumulation of microorganisms and their extracellular products forming structured communities attached to a surface. Biofilms are able to build up under natural circumstances, for instance on the urothelium or prostate stones and they can also colonize the surfaces of implanted medical devices. Biofilm infections have a major role on temporary and permanent implants or devices placed in the human body. In the process of endourological development a great variety of foreign bodies have been invented besides urethral catheters like ureter, prostatic stents, percutan nephrostomy, penile, testicular implants and artificial urinary sphincters. Many biofilms are quite harmful but others can have a positive impact, namely lining healthy intestine and female genito-urinary tract. Biofilms have significant implications for clinical pharmacology, particularly related to antibiotic resistance, drug adsorption onto and off of devices, and minimum inhibitory concentrations of drugs required for effective therapy.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://api.intechopen.com/chapter/pdf-download/19320","http://cdn.intechopen.com/pdfs/19320/InTech-Biofilm_and_urogenital_infections.pdf"],"title":"9 Biofilm and Urogenital Infections","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

A necessary and sufficient condition on the powers of the integrators is identified for the solvability of the problem. In the higher order case, the tracking controllers are explicitly constructed by employing the tool of adding a power integrator. In the lower order case, a weak version of adding a power integrator technique is developed to enable us to construct tracking controllers.","inCitations":["38c97b1ee69fbc66d8455272685ba87638d5985e","2110aece8fe4ab6a2df67126aff8aa77c0b3e78b","c550ef6f337f19014827ffcc460055207202e8ee","ef7b1e336107bec1318a90344aed00ff84e26cd3","14f1a697c51b9793cd7bfa96b67e195140b7a431","c25fc725ceed5febd04aa82532b60456eae8456d","a09150896e9cdfc9a56aeaa062dff8eabb90a9ac","2bd660fd194e58565f19a193bf059686a2933976","dfa5b5ceec58058c4606011359ba57fdf883e369","b03da9e6665185ff37af0d2436bb15c2f52d29fb","a92cbd5d58dcc043ced3b422d578d02c2dd49f40","00c2f6fd053e6a626819aae488bb9ba4837489dc","ed1c9b5c9190a5db8d8a5fff8c1c5c1463f2dcfa","3db1893c0c69e28cba90f7f06a2c890cd190dcd4","2dc44518e9770487f9638c8fb80d9e70c4e60261","df2890814651e340c7ec150cbd3cd52674b0513a","a985d8399b959c7779557495785f30f0270a6c1e","c3d0a49d81cdfb2cfc13054fba59e27ada115fe1","bcf4019d59614818c99a52021d7adb9f4008a06c","adcf817c470f1d999933a0977f2d25f2e58ca028","4d2d0dcde903459d2eabc58c57e5f487c91a4bc5","24e9ee8460fea13a8d1a413701a557ba3901261f","f4b4453b1a124fc4d3a4b5ad6119dad622819a93","36a6d4f2b42a7f77d33bb46cc272ce64af0e8279","f243de5a672931dc0d5c3af1105d73cd80bca8b8"],"pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1016/j.automatica.2017.02.026"],"title":"Global asymptotic output tracking of nonlinear second-order systems with power integrators","doi":"10.1016/j.automatica.2017.02.026","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.automatica.2017.02.026","venue":"Autom."}

Morbidity is minimal, but complications do exist. Up to 3 months complications are not frequent, but longer indwelling times are associated with increasing frequency of incrustation, infections, secondary stone formation, obstruction of the stented tract and migration. We report a rare case of a 33 year old pregnant patient with migration of an ureteral endoprosthesis. The patient received a right ureteral stent at 12 weeks for acute obstructive pyelonephritis. When her urologist tried to remove the ureteral stent post delivery, the stent was not found in the bladder. Ureteroscopy was performed but no ureteral stent was found. The patient showed a moderate improvement of the pyelonephritis, but complained about insidious palpitations. A CT scan was performed and showed the presence of the ureteral stent extending from the inferior vena cava up to the right atrium. Endovascular retrieval was performed through a puncture of the common femoral vein, using a curved guide that was introduced through the vena cava into the right atrium. Under fluoroscopic control, it was twisted around the stent and pulled out. The outcome was favorable, and no other complications were noted.","inCitations":["193889f9ecc847e8c47975f4a7fa7c44ab04c3f8"],"pdfUrls":["https://www.jbsr.be/jms/article/download/jbr-btr.842/809"],"title":"Intracaval Migration of Ureteral Stent","doi":"10.5334/jbr-btr.842","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.5334/jbr-btr.842","venue":"Journal of the Belgian Society of Radiology"}

E-mail: romano.locci@uniud.it Abstract. The fungal mycoflora of dried grapes, used in Friuli for the production of “passito” dessert wines, was investigated to detect potential ochratoxin A (OTA)-producers, in particular species of the genera Penicillium and Aspergillus. From samples of five cultivars of grapevines, grown in different locations, 379 strains of Penicillium spp. were isolated, but not one from the genus Aspergillus. Four strains produced UV fluorescent metabolites, as detected by thin-layer chromatography (TLC), on grape juice agar and on synthetic liquid media. Three of these were OTA producers, when analyzed by high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC), following immunoaffinity column purification. On the basis of morphocultural characteristics and ribosomal DNA sequencing, the strains were classified as P. puberulum and P. variabile. None appeared to belong to the species P. verrucosum or P. nordicum.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://www.siencis-par-furlan.net/wp-content/uploads/Torelli.Ochratoxin.pdf"],"title":"Is there ochratoxin A in “ passito ” dessert wines from Friuli ?","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

(1980) J. Biol. Chem. 255, 3707-3712; (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 5177-5182]. When this precursor-containing envelope fraction was incubated in the presence of protease inhibitors such as antipain, leupeptin, chymostatin and elastatinal, a new peptide appeared on a polyacrylamide gel at the position where the signal peptide was expected to appear. This was proved to be the signal peptide of the lipoprotein from the following facts: (a) its appearance is in proportion to the appearance of the lipoprotein and disappearance of the precursor; (b) when the cleavage of the signal peptide from the precursor was inhibited by globomycin, the peptide did not appear on the gel; and (c) the results of labeling of the peptide with [3H]leucine, [35S]methionine and [3H]arginine were consistent with the amino acid composition of the signal peptide. The signal peptide thus accumulated in the envelope fraction was hydrolyzed by an enzyme named 'signal peptide peptidase' when the envelope fraction was washed to remove the inhibitors. The hydrolysis was inhibited by re-addition of these inhibitors. The signal peptide peptidase hydrolyzed the signal peptide only after its cleavage from the lipoprotein precursor.","inCitations":["df1ef49e6f4b2f4ccd0e5b155eb24cd0a535b3a4","98cdc69271e3359f756636e6d2645323867ce164","c6083a04ef10b25372713005f7d1cdae928f9731","22538bac64191c421002d925ae575048dfc18aa1","df016b52bb90a3e983bf0e483276de2ad76f7cf9","f4252767d0e559c99d9ca5ad0cad9b4db758a840","f34b488cf5e93da709bdebdeeb5ad59cadf9e1a0","eed75644e570feb07fb2274b14389914ce993661","65259568e54955c5ef4bf0a813aaf790c6da4b6e","5e4313aa08faa886fa504d949ca151b2344bdd38"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Signal peptide digestion in Escherichia coli.

The empirical results suggest that individuals are attracted to self-employment because of higher expected earnings relative to paid employment and by the freedom from managerial constraints that it offers. Evidence is also produced supporting the prosperity pull argument for self-employment. Marital status, parents' employment status, housing equity, and occupational status clearly emerge as significant determinants of labor-market choice.

This paper provides a critical analysis of broadening participation within geoscience education literature through the use of accessible and inclusive instructional practices that support students with physical and sensory disabilities. Common physical and nonphysical barriers that discourage the full participation of students with disabilities in classroom, laboratory, and field activities are illustrated in this review. In areas of limited reportable data relevant in the geoscience-focused literature, a broader science, technology, engineering, and mathematics perspective is provided. Gaps in the literature were identified to include limited empirical evidence on the effectiveness of inclusive curricular design and the limited opportunities for students with disabilities to participate in advanced, multiday geoscience field trips. The purpose of highlighting this collection of literature is to encourage the use of more equitable and inclusive instructional strategies, including alternative strategies and virtual learning environments that increase access and enhance participation for students with physical and sensory disabilities.","inCitations":["71547fb4c49a4358ef9f8f20e66857d9072770cf","298cb760ace1df16634000620a3da2cf26b71502","281cbe856343e8b0faace280ddcc361eb2c7ed9c","eb804e56c9e759ce31f76ffc91d600125f37c990","0fc001836c752654fcbe88ed84eea74df36b6ffc","d63a1ae0b1d2cf5cd2cedc49aa52a371cbca1cc8","731fa33cd102472b1baab9c8499446927d0df894"],"pdfUrls":["https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ1161345.pdf"],"title":"A Synthesis of Instructional Strategies in Geoscience Education Literature That Address Barriers to Inclusion for Students With Disabilities","doi":"10.5408/16-211.1","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.5408/16-211.1","venue":""}

It is mostly represented in the Neotropics, with one and two genera endemic to South Africa and Madagascar, respectively. Using primers for six single copy WRKY gene family loci, we amplified DNA from 96 samples representing all genera of the palm tribe Cocoseae as well as outgroup tribes Reinhardtieae and Roystoneae. We compared parsimony (MP), maximum likelihood (ML), and Bayesian (B) analysis of the supermatrix with three species-tree estimation approaches. Subtribe Elaeidinae is sister to the Bactridinae in all analyses. Within subtribe Attaleinae, Lytocaryum, previously nested in Syagrus, is now positioned by MP and ML as sister to the former, with high support; B maintains Lytocaryum embedded within Syagrus. Both MP and ML resolve Cocos as sister to Syagrus; B positions Cocos as sister to Attalea. Bactridineae is composed of two sister clades, Bactris and Desmoncus in one, for which there is morphological support, and a second comprising Acrocomia, Astrocaryum, and Aiphanes. Two B and one ML gene tree-species estimation approaches are incongruent with the supermatrix in a few critical intergeneric clades, but resolve the same infrageneric relationships. The biogeographic history of the Cocoseae is dominated by dispersal events. The tribe originated in the late Cretaceous in South America. Evaluated together, the supermatrix and species tree analyses presented in this paper provide the most accurate picture of the evolutionary history of the tribe to date, with more congruence than incongruence among the various methodologies.","inCitations":["8a1afb9a40ecb009dc0652fac7c9ee166aef865a","2d7e93f36095a22e6e622665933b95367b110820","6d06fb98e56176e64991e0592286e7192e76d295","8e5205d7e152e01e34a7969e3bd76147a6026309","ce1bdf0e30b28768bf2d9d5dbfffdb894c6491d0","fcd5b379afddb5f63f54ed73d434cb1b78978213","6c2dfd965fffecac89003f8fd27521891a7a9a2e","dd11ff174d3f5b43999e74dab03a8d1cc92349a0","6f53c0374e477d60a3647df6b3e5cd9d31a0ea85","4a8bac19eec78390a94e39c0ff2a0ff6060543dd","9358d05f30e5875e3f877963a859efa38d5714c6","58146959a30025458e94f23ef8c669839d92e020","71c4d870f3a5da7523b045444b8473b4d1b70c07","48ca980d471e1f86270f91908b82b1a8650572bd","ab7b99b045aa035de323f76e96233fd61afca3bd","50d703948dd056335f80258c2cbd115239961bc0","16120fba153d9b3a2647f9f9404eece2b782164e"],"pdfUrls":["https://pag.confex.com/recording/pag/xxiii/pdf/free/4db77adf5df9fff0d3caf5cafe28f496/paper14694_7.pdf"],"title":"Phylogeny and historical biogeography of the cocosoid palms (Arecaceae, Arecoideae, Cocoseae) inferred from sequences of six WRKY gene family loci","doi":"10.1111/cla.12100","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1111/cla.12100","venue":""}

The total difference between the elemental ratios, standardized to Ca, observed for mining discharge and fecal pellets are 22.9 and 6.8 inUndinula vulgaris, 23.9 and 13.6 inEuchaeta rimana, 23.3 and 2.9 inLabidocera acutifrons, 19.8 and 13.7 inUndinula darwinii, and 18.2 and 4.0 inOncaea venusta for fecal pellets produced by copepods held in ambient sea water and for fecal pellets produced when exposed to a sample of mining discharge respectively. The application of EDAX to chemical analysis of fecal pellets is described and discussed.","inCitations":["e53f83aaeefcb8130aff028b6d34d6e75cdc428f"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Ingestion of deep-sea mining discharge by five species of tropical copepods","doi":"10.1007/BF00279425","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/BF00279425","venue":""}

Twelve wells in each of the seven rows of a multi-well plate were used to incubate the test materials. In combinations of 10 microl distilled water, 100 microl broth, 10 microl 10% sucrose, 10 microl S. mutans, 10 microl 10% sodium bicarbonate, and 10 microl 3% hydrogen peroxide, seven different environments were created for testing. Environments had either sodium bicarbonate or hydrogen peroxide with S. mutans, or a combination of sodium bicarbonate and hydrogen peroxide with S. mutans. The plate was incubated at 37 degrees C and measured at 0, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30, and 42 hours by optical density with a spectrophotometer.\n\n\nRESULTS\nResults showed bacterial growth was prevented by sodium bicarbonate, hydrogen peroxide, and the combination of sodium bicarbonate and hydrogen peroxide. Although hydrogen peroxide is bacteriocidal and sodium bicarbonate is bacteriostatic, there were no significant differences among the three treatment groups in spectrophotometer readings at any of the nine readings over 42 hours.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThere was no significant difference among the effects of hydrogen peroxide, sodium bicarbonate, or the sodium bicarbonate and hydrogen peroxide combination, as measured by optical density. The hydrogen peroxide, sodium bicarbonate, and the sodium bicarbonate and hydrogen peroxide combination prevented bacterial growth of S. mutans. The results show that products containing these agents have the ability to stop the growth of S. mutans. Products containing sodium bicarbonate and/or hydrogen peroxide may be useful to caries-prone patients. More studies are needed to confirm these results on patients.","inCitations":["d87882fbf377d67a4344de150383ff1c84abdf69","91e7d6b1e8a33a0a1922f7ab5b715180acf7ac57","2e57ef9e0a3151c393e799b3abb18b2ad046e961","41b304e3fc2fd4bc8103719225ea1b8d1cc7f268","bf3b2a607c486df1a2a75c51dabd6a77dc05c9c5","53edbbfe2a3e8f113c39992cbc36f72c863b8abc","ede5fa54022e1a95dbfecf05fae1933ce3f2cfe5","9fab1ca6057520fe39aa01a4682b80b53ea12668","fa167bc472c91a6b95802225ae8f104c67a608be","ac8da8b7ed41eaf73e28f8045b1086ce03f077ac"],"pdfUrls":["http://jdh.adha.org/content/79/4/7.full.pdf","http://bashaar.org.il/files/Sodium%20bicarbonate%20and%20hydrogen%20peroxide%20the%20effect%20on%20the%20growth%20of%20Streptococcus%20mutans.pdf"],"title":"Sodium bicarbonate and hydrogen peroxide: the effect on the growth of Streptococcus mutans.","doi":"","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"Journal of dental hygiene : JDH"}

While service performance metrics may not always be available in real time to telecom operators or service providers, service performance prediction becomes an important building block for such a system. However, it is generally hard to achieve. In this master thesis, we propose a machine-learning based method that enables performance prediction for services running in virtualized environments with Docker containers. This method is service agnostic and the prediction models built by this method use only device statistics collected from the server machine and from the containers hosted on it to predict the values of the service-level metrics experienced on the client side. The evaluation results from the testbed, which runs a Video-on-Demand service using containerized servers, show that such a method can accurately predict different service-level metrics under various scenarios and, by applying suitable preprocessing techniques, the performance of the prediction models can be further improved. In this thesis, we also show the design of a proof-of-concept of a Real-Time Analytics Engine that uses online learning methods to predict the service-level metrics in real time in a container-based environment.","inCitations":["17f792e0d79bcc37e5554b5dbf5147c50f73170e"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Predicting Service Metrics from Device Statistics in a Container-Based Environment","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

We used bioassays to assess the variability in virulence (measured as time to death) as well as fitness of the pathogen (measured as spore production) in four gypsy strains challenged with six E. maimaiga isolates, using host and pathogen strains originating from Asia, Europe, and North America. We found that all E. maimaiga isolates tested were pathogenic to all strains of Lymantria dispar, regardless of the geographical origin of the fungal isolate, with at least 86% mortality for all combinations of fungal isolate and gypsy moth strain. We therefore conclude that Asian gypsy moths are susceptible to North American strains of E. maimaiga. No significant interactions between fungal isolates and gypsy moth strains with regard to time to death were found, indicating that each fungal isolate had the same overall effect on all the gypsy moth strains tested. However, fungal isolates differed significantly with regard to virulence, with a Russian isolate being the slowest to kill gypsy moth (5.1+/-0.1 days) and a Japanese isolate being the overall fastest to kill its host (4.0+/-0.1 days). Fungal isolates also differed in fitness, with variability in types of spores produced. These differences in virulence and fitness were, however, not correlated with geographical origin of the fungal isolate. Gypsy moth strains had no or only little effect on fungal virulence and fitness. Based on our studies with laboratory-reared gypsy moth strains, erosion of successful control of gypsy moth by E. maimaiga seems unlikely.","inCitations":["c6f30686a27b6113166e8cbb8a0606346b499a41","0d0bfb62b6fb4311e81231a0a00042705fedc649","314ee40be95712facb059be05cea73cb1f6b8a94","0ea3e40eb3c823c094b892d0fb770b44e5101916","140716faaab2b71fb869b481792eb7238766c785","75ec60635585fa207201c28f82621980a1d3c147","a44a6683cd6b22ac877981e85f438ce3845af457","c29598f617148e48081180f054c4d4d6aef28912"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Virulence and fitness of the fungal pathogen Entomophaga maimaiga in its host Lymantria dispar, for pathogen and host strains originating from Asia, Europe, and North America.","doi":"10.1016/j.jip.2005.05.004","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jip.2005.05.004","venue":"Journal of invertebrate pathology"}

The empirical investigation is an explorative case study of science-driven FEI and HRM practices across one in-depth case study and seven validation studies among international pharmaceutical and biotech companies. The findings provide a theoretical overview of key HRM practices in support of radical pharmaceutical FEI as well as an empirical mapping of how innovation-facilitating bundles of HRM practices are applied to actively develop radical, science-driven pharmaceutical FEI, including the identification of the key innovation challenges and opportunities involving innovation-facilitating HRM practices in pharmaceutical FEI. The article contributes to the existing innovation literature in terms of identifying how radical FEI may be facilitated through the application of innovation-facilitating bundles of HRM practices. The empirical contribution and managerial implications provide nine specific suggestions for how pharmaceutical management groups can better support radical pharmaceutical FEI through targeted HRM practices. The derived results of the study also underline inherent challenges of the pharmaceutical industry and regulations (FDA) that may not stimulate radical innovation, which cannot be resolved by HRM, but require the attention of policy makers. The value added lies in the specificity of the empirical, pharmaceutical context in which the issue of supporting radical, science-driven FEI is investigated.","inCitations":["436a0f7eea866acd0b63cf9f439945a795ac8342","e6f76e643bdaafca3666730fc16e7eac2216fb4d","676cc867b975721508be4d2dd1b4541213946682"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Facilitating Radical Front‐End Innovation Through Targeted HRM Practices: A Case Study of Pharmaceutical and Biotech Companies","doi":"10.1111/jpim.12387","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1111/jpim.12387","venue":""}

Using this definition, it is now well established that Photorhabdus elaborate an extensive secondary metabolism during the post-exponential phase of bacterial growth. This secondary metabolism includes, but is not limited to, the production of light, a stilbene antibiotic and an anthraquinone pigment. In this chapter, the role of secondary metabolism during the life cycle of Photorhabdus will be discussed. Recent work has shown that secondary metabolism in Photorhabdus is required for the mutualistic association between the bacteria and its nematode partner, in particular bacterial secondary metabolism is required to support normal nematode growth and development. An isogenic population of Photorhabdus is phenotypically heterogenous and this facilitates functional partitioning within the population. The relationship between secondary metabolism and the various phenotypic and phase variants that exist in populations of Photorhabdus will also be discussed. Finally, this chapter will also describe the various regulatory nodes that have been identified as being part of the complex regulatory network that is used to control the temporal expression of secondary metabolism in Photorhabdus.","inCitations":["4a8ddf8a9d499d25aa7ca87a41ae978220ace730","3689b001de5e9b5e0d6aeeb71e1cb77ced597cb9","d5e9fe38ad836ba27e7a0217c3b7eb2acf8183ef"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"The Regulation of Secondary Metabolism in Photorhabdus.","doi":"10.1007/82_2016_21","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/82_2016_21","venue":"Current topics in microbiology and immunology"}
