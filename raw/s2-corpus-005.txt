In mice injected in the cerebellum, vacuolization was limited to the cerebellum, medulla and mesencephalon, whereas injection into forebrain regions resulted in vacuolization in all brain regions. The studies suggested that the cerebellum had a selective vulnerability for 22L. In this study we examined the interaction between host genotype and selective vulnerability of specific brain regions. The mouse gene that has the most profound effect on pathogenesis, particularly incubation period, is termed Sinc (scrapie incubation). Groups of mice with three genotypes of Sinc (s7s7, p7p7 and their F1 cross, s7p7) were injected with 22L into the cerebral cortex, thalamus or cerebellum. Analysis of incubation periods showed that, regardless of the host genotype, the cerebellum injection group had a significantly shorter incubation period than groups injected in other regions. After cerebellum injection vacuolization was limited to the cerebellum, medulla and mesencephalon in all three host genotypes. The location of vacuoles within the cerebellum differed depending upon the host strain. Vacuolization developed almost exclusively in grey matter in s7s7 mice, mainly in white matter in p7p7 mice, and in both grey and white matter in F1 mice. These results demonstrate that the selective vulnerability of the cerebellum to induction of clinical disease by 22L does not depend on host genotype, but host genotype does affect lesion distribution within the cerebellum.","inCitations":["d7ea8edc048315eef462bb2a8e9f9550b74ce2da","ec89ee8044d66c5a5bba882d60fcdeeec2750397","4e115568c823d1956fd08124ccd93058bf654b7f","307e8c8e2a4d4ce79911ee2548fbf1988fa061ce","f6d23babc3698160b4bd8a55b8366037b2e074c6","d4c6737f7709f323f820e4a1fb6d073728bf6faf","616a6a6c76e3ae8ab5d165ddbf5928135f82667e","ac8bdf13278a5d165bed8478bfcf5cf42e395092","b84c1174a29afb126d5a24343e041b9c76f91781","61a83f98a0821fec7630807f4cf6b4b16166e78d","49f9aac8b6687b88f2e39b3a3e30dc7e04c6ee4d"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Vacuolization, incubation period and survival time analyses in three mouse genotypes injected stereotactically in three brain regions with the 22L scrapie strain.","doi":"10.1097/00005072-199003000-00003","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1097/00005072-199003000-00003","venue":"Journal of neuropathology and experimental neurology"}

A single ORF of 142 amino acids (Orf142) is interrupted by three self-splicing group I introns, providing the first example of a phage gene with multiple intron insertions. Twort Orf142 is encoded in a message that is abundant 15-20 min after infection and is highly similar to a late gene product (Orf8) of the morphologically related Listeria phage A511. The introns in orf142 are spliced in vivo and contain all the conserved features of primary sequence and secondary structure of group I introns in subgroup IA2, which includes the introns in Escherichia coli phage T4 and the Bacillus phages beta22 and SPO1. Introns I2 and I3 in orf142 are highly similar, and their intron insertion sites are closely spaced. The presence of transcripts with a skipped exon between these introns indicates that they may fold into a single active ribozyme resulting in alternative splicing. Alternatively, the cleaved 5' exon preceding I2 may undergo trans splicing to the 3' exon that follows I3. Regardless of the detailed mechanism, these results demonstrate a new means whereby a single gene can give rise to multiple messenger RNAs.","inCitations":["dc30279cc131b69ff07576b4ea2dbe137e485b48","e987bc765ffa806cf4a058375c53773611f53fe4","e63291ab56416066f34ac26bd1789c0e78494f73","49fa3f753b873aa300705160c3babcf84880b98d","d5ddbb7fb8d262c9968060d01bbd0691dca40192","2ce254465be9b25d1601c93a6e17354e9041d417","85379fc1fbddcccc3849dd96ce7faca775470108","c1c9489b47c600f9b8631546ccf306801455e651","8ade5a4f6e214d464741cba7c6862c7fb957e6c4","1348fb83263b32715ef27e050c28b94220e699ed","a4c924f04f1b8077f3d2034742e961a86f662ae3","3cb89b73e19888586a0a4667bd7f34874c3906ee","2ef63d3f95c8b874dcfcf643958d2ca2ce58eb47","7f33f1cca3894092fd093e90de6c820f5608bcef","8fb286070e115307715e90fb0094dc437eaa20ab","7741e8a7fb0fe837453d7eecc4ace9405e52f1d5","44a19682e811049a4c156534a36e3e4b3bf60c06","6c83fea1355e4a080771571a5f87f4cb8925389f","8bd1f32e2d4153776010c9638fb59969c807ba96","833e4e3b8333a772285266cdbf9516cb4c7cbf2e","dfffbfb26a5772a88dd1788234e594cc80d9bd3d","50e873e166e8c19633a2a419fc3727ffa44a4d75","9f699a02779b63be8d280c4ae98d18498b26d1f7","31c6f58a4dfc0cd48f8f329d24397371892d9a31","740c275a80f765751ac96393b837a14cfb216bae","55930f1a3ba4796fb9afa38700abb28ab5a3162a","fddb0890ff093becc2e904dd45034cb52239a630","26db2b5daf230130a26eea0fe822c28aa6e80e52","29a77fe6fbe6ed1e1cb115e11b9990b6f7cfcdc2","bb2cc5971398450ee21c1b64c18cc5de0237faa6","164f05c8120b8a1517486453caf2535cf1af9435","66c62066b3939d83682dad7b1183e4ca5e93881e","d9e835cc4ab68c68e88de4642d07866f78d8ad01","b74b972353221fc649579eb84780f71df921b2ec","90a62b2db771d35611f3f50f85e1f119008d7cd7","da3eebd032297bb68c43e25098199d0250877061","e73bc08cd2485989dcb2894cac08d0fadab7e08d","76d5ecde14755fe3a33c8c888009d0f251b82044","6826bccb32a41844a43058969175f68b640d5b6a","f29702ebbdebd5213adba0f81ad920c8fa899563","17275a2d8c6708c0b226204336d271b6b1c981b6"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.pnas.org/content/96/12/7005.full.pdf"],"title":"Unexpected abundance of self-splicing introns in the genome of bacteriophage Twort: introns in multiple genes, a single gene with three introns, and exon skipping by group I ribozymes.","doi":"10.1073/pnas.96.12.7005","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.96.12.7005","venue":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America"}

Given the complexity of flow dynamics on such small scales, robust numerical methods have to be employed in order to capture the highly dynamic interfaces and flow intermittency. In this work we use a three-dimensional multiphase Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) model to simulate surface tension dominated flow on smooth fracture surfaces. We model droplet and film flow over a wide range of contact angles and Reynolds numbers encountered in such flows on rock surfaces. We validate our model via comparison with existing empirical and semi-analytical solutions for droplet flow. We use the SPH model to investigate the occurrence of adsorbed trailing films left behind droplets under various flow conditions and its importance for the flow dynamics when films and droplets coexist. It is shown that flow velocities are higher on prewetted surfaces covered by a thin film which is qualitatively attributed to the enhanced dynamic wetting and dewetting at the trailing and advancing contact lines. Finally, we demonstrate that the SPH model can be used to study flow on rough surfaces.","inCitations":["6706f2c8208c33b79a8758e611392956e8046a5d","b7567345ce322d91ebc10283259867080d992a05","15a81ab35cba6630d814bbe005ca636bd4824805","c5fafbf4aa8b89a740c925f9d8a58ed2314c3c62","7b7ef648cc85eb6a90a151458a18c90f1b94b217","2eca26d6bec47b12600b3ab02460df2c33ffdbbb","a71da87cc5c0abd9313049a8a37bda42a9248687","0c099ee08894c700c285e0b4157f8d7a716c5cd4","633c8fe4315f38ba89c32050f52c51dcecb1ecf5","663555e82e952b800289578f92f5e408d70eec75","9e0273889e3539cd1370ab9c0eab3c3058824d7b","e46e3206c5d972bcc4456ac480e48bebd4bf6ef7","e59762268582c89222f836c6747b39acb4eb7d46"],"pdfUrls":["http://janneskordilla.org/files/papers/awr2013_sharing.pdf"],"title":"A smoothed particle hydrodynamics model for droplet and film flow on smooth and rough fracture surfaces","doi":"10.1016/j.advwatres.2013.04.009","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.advwatres.2013.04.009","venue":""}

A major challenge in spin states studies is interpretation of Mossbauer spectra to determine the electronic structure of iron under extreme conditions. In this paper ab initio methods are used to predict quadrupole splitting values of high-, intermediate- and low-spin Fe2+ and Fe3+ in perovskite, as a function of pressure and composition. The calculations in (Mg0.75Fe0.25)SiO3 yield quadrupole splitting values in the range of 0.7–1.7 mm/s for all spin and valence states except high-spin Fe2+, which has two possible quadrupole splittings, 2.3 and 3.3 mm/s. The unexpected multiple quadrupole splitting values for high-spin Fe2+ are explained in terms of small changes in local structure and d-orbital occupations. The computed results are applied to interpret existing perovskite Mossbauer data for iron's spin state.","inCitations":["c3e96ec9f801abc3664fba5e2bd291fdd297d9cd","f98c3fd841d64f869e639d5da923c2100eb3fa78","d3418bf5bbaaa2cae2185aa3d69a4f80f0dd6985","d898cdcc79bb9cb1145cec2dc3d4f647350a3ae4","ce04f8c065ae133865c6cfcc09986d825cf6b832","27113b2a013fd891a2d288b33dbcd41d7d6ddf4f","a6cb73238411ae9368483fef42f89c097f20b5d4","62e76e9a13d3b2b2359ec98338b2b4e404276c6d","3c4a8688eb32883e6d13fabd4b94b86c353e7eb3","b8058d09d62fb46c265bb17739fb21ae6b665746","0ecdb1f6807d46aeb46f2834beff76bc2a1e7254","a9998662775fa5e252a074cb6177a4f43f58b4a0","f5999ab74703d6d282d900aa991b51cfcebeee26","a825292f6b1818a6be813fb8b3beb1c558daf934","4f18359defa24b75de1846b4bdb35f7838eeb8d1","6b523eace8f2ea272820d44ed34914f93645260f","0fc19256c00e93d795e62019bd2abd8c8f3830e1","759c07f1dc27f1d68eea74990dc6ed2c069b4ea3","839b85cd9d6b1e1b3a30d76bfdb4606794563057","6f4c4574dfb288253a4250fe8813af4addde7b37","d3350621e3a13e85f46a7fa350bb85e4e5ebfdd7","caa69d4bf3efaa2814bc6792a5a1c7d9a0d723d9","61d7d3dd0ce2a734d7e1e46c242c2a7e68e9ad78","7aa3b141fd81d8fedafc5f726d6be3551e097b2d","5df20ad1f00bcae482395398ebaf28c3cee3d865","c7b5dfd32dbbafcbbb729f092eb5b8d53c07554e","e45064fcd6a504ba16903378ce52ad16ffdb878a","7c24f3bf7be71e817bcfe9c87d3039c1474c3ef1","a2b2cfd0e3a33844d6a9d09d5f3185ca83f664f2","b02c8118694dd53b18505b09a71516c5955613ab","9bf361576c2387ea03b3ef1d93e11af9c94bb391","745947f1bc403d58dd1593f3ec07483bfb393144","d112b7a439dbdb9e5cca2d0395a1b393b7ed7347","b4bdac4d4096d42a61850f30745c6ca677e738a6","f46d101bf1203c15418dccc5d2e0712afe33ebcf","5f598e1afe6cb182fda49ff5021f7d1aa424832c","d9f4563d0a4c1c0675311f530453b6754c4d2c1b","873344ca6ebd14b5173eff07b7744d13ee4597fe","5471fb1e1381f9bded9d2291e3727271b787966d","84d8ca9d620a53db2952ace53746c114ce08151c","f85a381ca5669712495e9c33b1b1e8d22e265043","76a5c04d3997262fac638222e4e378561b788984","2b9cd292813392e63b046958e8fbdf814cdc8dc5","489c70b76892c704219c727558d036c704b8d334","6267d513e3e5d9763a7c3fac82b4dbd13584b96c","f1d7ddc1ada57d5256b091f73051123eb0f8c47f","9a4b53d9665a8192b30b52cfe1edb7015f78f548","bd44fa67bd6e817561e597f26a427cc949b9c0c6","653fc1dbc778aa23b8f271a46a2a37019c184e5f","42e2a1015f3f532e3c220b5634bfd43777628a8b","a1dd74b25fd84cc85d59dd8f622dd4089f671dd6","19ba9aeaa7cca8eec3166b88808f7db165041fe5","870c210425417f9457819a22b83afefaa5df7e48"],"pdfUrls":["https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/handle/2027.42/95066/grl25962.pdf?isAllowed=y&sequence=1"],"title":"Mossbauer modeling to interpret the spin state of iron in (Mg,Fe)SiO3 perovskite","doi":"10.1029/2009GL038340","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1029/2009GL038340","venue":""}

The research findings were as follows: Firstly, personal factors and relational factors had a positive and significant relationship with knowledge contribution and knowledge utilization respectively, and structural factors had a positive and significant relationship with knowledge contribution, and business characteristics had a positive and significant relationship with knowledge utilization. Secondly, knowledge contribution had a positive and significant relationship with internal process perspective, learning & growth perspective and financial perspective, and knowledge utilization had a positive and significant relationship with internal process perspective and learning & growth perspective. These research findings implied that hotel employees shared necessary knowledge and experiences with their colleagues in job implementation, and they contributed their accumulated job knowledge to their colleagues, and they utilized their received knowledge from colleagues in their job. Hotels could provide differentiated services based on accumulated knowledge through these various knowledge-sharing activities, and potentially gain their competitive advantage over rivals through developing creative products as well.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"호텔기업의 지식경영활동에서 지식기여와 지식활용의 선행요인과 결과요인의 관계 연구","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Z is a cytotoxic agent that induces apoptosis by acting at cell cycle level, has DNA-binding properties and inhibits transcriptional responses. Z has shown anti-tumor activity in vitro and in vivo in xenograft models. Based on the activity observed in a phase I study (1PR and 2 SD) in advanced bladder cancer, we have designed a phase II study to explore the efficacy of Z in this setting.

Twinning activation and evolution are evidenced by scanning electron microscopy/electron backscatter diffraction and analyzed by examining their strain accommodation in the frame of all the potential accommodative systems in their neighborhoods. It is revealed that the formation of twins results from the local incompatible strains produced by dislocation slips in grain boundary areas. Either high positive Schmid factor and low positive Schmid factor twins or even negative Schmid factor twins could be activated. Twins are always accompanied by certain accommodative deformation (twinning and slip) in their immediate neighborhoods. Accommodative slips and twins have different impacts on the further development of the initiating twins. Twins accommodated by twins and possessing high Schmid factors have a higher capacity to propagate and repeatedly nucleate; whereas twins accommodated by slips and possessing low Schmid factors have less power and are static. Twins can be permanent or transient depending on their Schmid factors. For those with positive Schmid factors, their strain contributions are consistent with the macroscopic strains, thus they are stable, whereas those with negative Schmid factors are unstable. The formation of such twins is due to the unbalanced local constraints induced by high Schmid factor deformation that generate the so-called back-stress. These twins make opposite contributions to the macroscopic strains. With deformation, the back-stress could be accommodated by local high Schmid factor compatible deformation. The crystal of the twinned part has to make a positive contribution in accordance with the macroscopic strains to be compatible with its surroundings, which may give rise to the activation of detwinning.","inCitations":["dd78a46befaffdc3c2b1b896f436fee31239e78a","a7da0efbbc2fcfd94295bbd2d9f62b9103846c76","ca3a7fa1ef16aec642777ef8beac35edd52e1f7c","0dd825ca8fc7afc70f6ba058875ff1d8140b2a3c","6900e3700bfdeff25641cd519dbf744cfaea34b1","85667faf49d1713653ce5df5b8f5b5c130b3e4db"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Study of twinning/detwinning behaviors of Ti by interrupted in situ tensile tests","doi":"10.1016/j.actamat.2014.09.038","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.actamat.2014.09.038","venue":""}

Simplistically, the questionnaire concerned parental judgment on (1) the role of the child in decisions about experimental therapy, (2) what information should be related to the child and by whom, (3) parental attitudes toward experimental therapy, and (4) the parents' opinions about ethical aspects of proposing experimental therapy. A high response rate (87.8%) was achieved. A majority of the respondents would allow a child take responsibility in deciding about experimental therapy. In their opinion the median age (16 years) at which a child should be allowed to give consent was higher than the median age (12 years) at which a child should merely be involved in the decision. Parents were more likely to overrule the child's decision if the child decided against experimental therapy than if the child chose the therapy (p less than 0.001). Parents found it more difficult to talk about death than about experimental therapy, and parents would be more willing to involve the physician in discussing experimental therapy than in discussing imminent death with a child (p less than 0.001). Many respondents (68%) felt that the child should be given both altruistic reasons and reasons of self-interest for participating in experimental therapy. About half of all of the respondents believed that a pediatric oncologist should always advise experimental therapy for the benefit of similarly afflicted patients.","inCitations":["831b87f2f90d17e1ee2830aa04c7b68da1b78739","16feb97a8e5c0721989e40d69b491b2c910bfe79","0d0188e8d358baf2d5a0198ecb4fe3603345ff70","b0b402ca5c32cbc395f2d07a7d9c8f01683b5b7a","b9ec7c139b9d97fe217bd4a0a5731ade33922897","f880585d31743e574a0010b03259570e84c607e7"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Experimental chemotherapy in children with cancer--a parent's view.","doi":"10.3109/08880018709141257","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.3109/08880018709141257","venue":"Pediatric hematology and oncology"}

In terms of inequality, it was synthetically found the need to specify the types of spaces under study, such as resource inequality, skills, etc. and the moral issue involved. This analysis supported the understanding of the relationship between inequality and poverty in Sen. Studying inequality and poverty implies observing human diversity. These diversities involve unique characteristics of people, especially their capabilities. Sen argues that poverty derives from the deprivation of these human functioning. The conceptualization of poverty through income turns out to be limited. Thus, rather than income, other dimensions related to skills need to be taken into account, which can be reflected in metrics or indices that facilitate the identification of poverty.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"DESIGUALDADE E POBREZA: Uma revisão de textos selecionados de Hausman e McPerson, Amartya Sen e Amartya Sen e Anand","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Patients with PFO suffering from paradoxical embolism are at increased risk for recurrent events. Percutaneous PFO closure is a new treatment modality aimed at secondary prevention.\n\n\nMETHODS AND RESULTS\nSince April 1994, 132 consecutive patients, aged 51 +/- 12 years with PFO and with at least one paradoxical embolic event, underwent percutaneous PFO closure using six different device types. The embolic index event was an ischemic stroke in 62% of patients, a transient ischemic attack (TIA) in 33% of patients, and a peripheral embolism in 5% of patients. Thirty-six (27%) patients had PFO associated with ASA, whereas 96 (73%) patients had PFO only. The implantation procedure was successful in 130 (98%) patients. During and up to 6 years of follow-up (mean 1.8 +/- 1.6 years, 231 patient years), a total of eight recurrent embolic events were observed, with six TIAs, two peripheral emboli, and no ischemic stroke. The actuarial freedom from recurrence of the combined end point of TIA, ischemic stroke, and peripheral embolism was 95.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 91.0%-96.4%) at 1 year and 90.5% (95% CI, 83.6%-97.2%) at 6 years.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nPercutaneous PFO closure can be performed with a high success rate. The procedure appears a promising therapeutic modality for secondary prevention of recurrent embolism in patients with PFO. Randomized trials must define its therapeutic value.","inCitations":["eebc12eb71b802f4c4819e7b26f13214eb3e4b11","394f3de0342dd91139e9e4d4e6f5515194da7e1a","06e4ee2b1695659d876231d4623ddff53bda715e","2c42ed93676e8be43ba8dea721a353082131da8b","89af7d24b1487bc73f52c396ef21cbdfd5d29fe1","bbe84e12dc2c772213b4541b77b80cff31dfb59a","306b11302fcda964666952c3712c415e70b78fa4","0d791e5fba5af383a4f331b9852ed5b3d7c1ab18","995abfa2ea92e82f4e22cda45086bdc570b67c7c","38e724b2cf1962a1a3e347acb0c3d0a2cfec8a7a","03d5e16cfbcf3d1fc0cd28385fca349f62727aee"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Percutaneous closure of patent foramen ovale in symptomatic patients.","doi":"10.1111/j.1540-8183.2001.tb00736.x","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1540-8183.2001.tb00736.x","venue":"Journal of interventional cardiology"}

Similarly the role of men and women in feud and vengeance is one of the prime concerns of this corpus of literature. Despite this centrality the heroic poems also bear a reputation for grim stoicism and a supposedly barren emotional landscape. Recent scholarship into the history of the emotions and the affective turn has begun to focus on the expression of emotion in medieval literature. This thesis surveys the language of emotion, the physical expressions of sentiment and emotional interactions in the final four poems of the Vǫlsunga and Niflunga narratives of the Poetic Edda; Atlakviða, Atlamál, Guðrúnarhvǫt and Hamðismál. Further, this study provides an analysis of the shield maiden and inciter archetypes of Old Norse-Icelandic literature. It discusses the ways in which the language of emotion and attendant characterisation was used to subvert medieval conceptions around gender, violence and revenge.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://skemman.is/bitstream/1946/23275/1/Nema%20ein%20Gu%C3%B0r%C3%BAn%20er%20hon%20%C3%A6va%20gr%C3%A9t.pdf"],"title":"Háskóli Íslands Hugvísindasvið Medieval Icelandic Studies","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

In the present study, we compared 4 AC–4 T with 6 cycles of TAC in the neoadjuvant setting (A = adriamycine, C = cyclophosphamide, T = docetaxel). Previously, we reported that AC-T resulted in a trend for improved outcome (odds ratio of the pathologic complete response (pCR) of the breast 1.60; 95% CI 0.90–3.21). This present analysis focuses on the results of treatment and pCR in the breast in relation to clinical response. Methods Women with breast cancer, eligible for neoadjuvant chemotherapy, were randomized to AC (60/600 mg/m2 q3wk × 4 cycles) followed by T (100 mg/m2 q3wk × 4 cycles), or to TAC (75/50/500 mg/m2 q3wk × 6 cycles). If indicated, trastuzumab and/or endocrine therapy were given as adjuvant treatment. Physical examination, ultrasound of breast and axillary lymph nodes and breast MRI were performed before start of chemotherapy, halfway and after completion of chemotherapy. These results together determined the clinical response (c) halfway and after chemotherapy. The clinical response was classified as cCR (complete response), cPR (partial response), cSD (stable disease) or cPD (progressive disease). pCR was defined as no invasive tumor in the breast at surgery. Results In total, 201 patients (n = 100 AC-T, n=101 TAC) were enrolled between February 2006 and April 2009. Baseline characteristics (AC-T/TAC) were well balanced. The clinical overall response rate (cCR and cPR) to 4 AC was comparable to that seen with 3 cycles TAC (48% versus 54%). Also, the clinical overall response rate to 8 AC-T was comparable to that seen with 6 TAC (81% versus 72%). In the AC-T arm, a third of the patients with cSD halfway reached a cCR or cPR after 8 cycles, whereas in the TAC arm only 18% of patients with cSD halfway reached a cCR or cPR after chemotherapy. In the sequential AC-T arm, 16% of the patients with cSD halfway reached a pCR after switching to docetaxel monotherapy. In contrast, in the TAC arm cSD halfway rarely resulted in pCR after 6 cycles. Patients with a cCR after chemotherapy had a pCR in 58% and 49% of cases, respectively. For patients with cPR these rates were 29% and 18%, respectively, and for patients with cSD 6% and 0%, respectively. Conclusion: Clinical response rates are related to pCR rates. The meaning of cSD halfway should be differently interpreted for sequential versus concurrent chemotherapy. In concurrent chemotherapy schedules, a switch to a non-cross resistant drug may be worthwhile. Early clinical response may be used as a decision aid during neoadjuvant chemotherapy to recognize non-responders. Support: Unrestricted grants from sanofi-aventis NL BV and Amgen BV.

Autologous fat granules obtained by liposuction from waist, abdomen, or femoribus internus were thus injected into the cavity, over 30 percent of demanding volume of fat suspension. All cases were followed up at least two years to evaluate the effect of correction. Results 31 depressions in 17 cases were corrected with our technique. No serious complications such as infection, necrosis, or liquefaction occurred after therapy. All depressions disappeared and the appearance looked good. Conclusion Injecting autologous fat granules into an undermined cavity is a good choice of correctting local depression in the face. With this technique, It is possible to solve the problem such as pinhole jam-up, uneven fat distributing, low fat survival in nowadays widely used tunnel technique.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Local augmentation by lipoinjection into undermined cavity beneath the depression in the face","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Using the AcrAB-TolC system as a paradigm multidrug-resistant efflux pump and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium as a model pathogen, we have demonstrated that AcrA, AcrB, and TolC are each required for efficient adhesion to and invasion of epithelial cells and macrophages by Salmonella in vitro. In addition, AcrB and TolC are necessary for Salmonella to colonize poultry. Mutants lacking acrA, acrB, or tolC showed differential expression of major operons and proteins involved in pathogenesis. These included chemotaxis and motility genes, including cheWY and flgLMK and 14 Salmonella pathogenicity island (SPI)-1-encoded type III secretion system genes, including sopE, and associated effector proteins. Reverse transcription-PCR confirmed these data for identical mutants in two other S. Typhimurium backgrounds. Western blotting showed reduced production of SipA, SipB, and SipC. The absence of AcrB or TolC also caused widespread repression of chemotaxis and motility genes in these mutants, and for acrB::aph, this was associated with decreased motility. For mutants lacking a functional acrA or acrB gene, the nap and nir operons were repressed, and both mutants grew poorly in anaerobic conditions. All phenotypes were restored to that of the wild type by trans-complementation with the wild-type allele of the respective inactivated gene. These data explain how mutants lacking a component of AcrAB-TolC are attenuated and that this phenotype is a result of decreased expression of numerous genes encoding proteins involved in pathogenicity. The link between antibiotic resistance and pathogenicity establishes the AcrAB-TolC system as fundamental to the biology of Salmonella.","inCitations":["a5b3986025d5da4a7aec578660db6543b625563e","bc7b71f5a6b7857dbe6925df5b907dc5dc9fa340","7a336b4c6049da8af130adcfdcd6c1ade507e990","aa43dbc9786b37576c17ab69169f9021a5f97ffc","16892149109921d3a5c645eb85914d766d745cad","3a2fae3aa6098220dbe85eb6796bd21b64898929","eb58fa87c8e5701cff9ececd6496e32855d6a64b","617a70751de2705d586fb5f61aea6b4a5fca3db4","066ed3340b8d1214399548f883ea08c898b92355","1c63948f83e5e751814559ac8c23b22596bfacd8","c492cac475bf59aa93bba34239a65bcfc139d1e8","0423e6d52db487bbc631205eba53ee41fb70f93b","61bdf002e26f7ac938e1592512ed58f97ccebb7d","863252dfc8ff954ecdb816bda5d9e876457b25c9","4268976bb8ece52db0907649d308114a01f1531f","7ddb3eb2b0fea7527f4bda2c8a46964363cf6282","6bdf8ee4d531d3a2074361a2108c8c3fe73b839c","6dae77ba57c197cf2b63e3413d76d7c217adcbe0","a61afd75ba56bb2a74b780b7c80077ce6927b6da","e0e2f499381370ea302184b483d183bfa641e0c4","b9855ef80029c187ad89fabcd3a7f8186aa9b8c1","305b14e41e96da17b4485921160d4dce5ec1dc57","2b4ae8e3e5a32e698cc7a7bccbd769dee9085962","17c02b5d34906212e956fb3659c1a7b96315aab9","c5cb7d6e7b682a445c059856b4c70c946546dfdd","fe26c21a1c38ac2f627b9e44a0eec62de121a428","98b6b81251612bfa0f992a446b356c8195f6fc69","a26e9705ededdd2d377a638bbccbe7bc40dd0e67","ba0dc8148a7f25523d8831e6b959a6b0afc4faad","23bdbd9a2611b0e4180a0881f650039427e8b574","2094a672f0de1744fc585607f2eb2cf3aef19376","ffc66ae7f20440e9ba04251907d35ebe109384c3","7f4d80db2b974f82f556664111e2b3a66c60efd9","0c734b81bde0ed43316036c579d7155aa3446d0b","4c6693a44c6c7e20bd3d282a6359f977790e61e6","a863de45ffd4dca83665edee4858c336c65be08f","9db9a2761ff35478a8aec2da3ccfab5e65df189d","fa4d3d8b4f68f60553b06204bbf570166da7705f","1fb7faa5881e8f04d2a4d06b59d94d7129216e7f","0de060c4507ac79d5cad28d7eec12eb56746bcc2","fcf48b8301161d96abcc3024bcc46c0cd1201805","388e2411b8b676a6ae886ce7e39fec917bcea1e1","7a380e1fa6ef232f494a0fcaca679483e7b0a3b7","3a0e602732b6a2a9c23acf76e552504665f4ad1e","5e9f448c864d38ea0e8814122a8bd7a8556b356f","81fd7d5592a3ae807d27ab3781ac6e39656337a8","26c6d068518384c0c83a53908bc9b1aa9e591879","aafd5d35904744ec4a5fd3a9460e927548ec05f9","1a4043ef580179512b3fe2bec084f0225f999340","75f4bae1df1c5db09457631d2dd6117620ba6aa6","8dd3e4809917e185f05198b465354751ff07a4ba","31fabd6872e54539ffd94fbc7109eb076d7ee0a9","d12158c2a08d710b7b99a5d30b0eb0317bf0c717","86f551ef692ded823e65b513d45722da51336f26","0ec1c3b8dad69ee59da5ad78ecabf46722749515","0a34d71625d68a3081db3654be2471ed1f935ed1","f31d9f38ac81030f96986d783955b5b9ea43b811","ef098e44cd27ce3c3453921787d26006c0c85c6a","0369f1cab40442737182b36f3a4cd70ce1b1f7ff","68a7f6bc518280a7c00ce1ef10465e032d20559c","053aff89d538551d679ed4f7be9c1b22533b44f3","44ae0fd07ab8e5e39e9ec9ce3ada86cf78b2160a","9902b8e4f1d618a696d27d9991c689160b5f9227","b24288ea63a83ed21038fd92a0dbe484e924b588","ad8f3c783cc5e4f8ed869229e42336fd963241f3","b7baadac09bd0dd4c21a56c3ac3fe1037963062f","6d1d7bd8b97a25a02a44c3ff452c12c47fafc41c","1f444a16b43fc7703e0559a690a15654dc822289","8ccf50fc72bf1fb8a7db6c2ed04b3b464f36b548","025b0ec0a153a69f5a1ef75fcd948f12fc80fef1","ecf29395a043cd785bd180fd93d7fdbb86df6aa9","0496aac4079692548a744d424457d8edc27a1dc2","700c6aab44c2e21e407d4a2d39636f966d52144c","8912671abadd2a54859ebc6fdc2c0b4c15f3a115","5e581f7fac499067e3ba650fd31fd046825b9cbe"],"pdfUrls":["https://www.research.ed.ac.uk/portal/files/9140356/The_Global_Consequence_of_Disruption_of_the_AcrAB_TolC_Efflux_Pump_in_Salmonella_enterica_Includes_Reduced_Expression_of_SPI_1_and_Other_Attributes_Required_To_Infect_the_Host.pdf","http://www.research.ed.ac.uk/portal/files/9140356/The_Global_Consequence_of_Disruption_of_the_AcrAB_TolC_Efflux_Pump_in_Salmonella_enterica_Includes_Reduced_Expression_of_SPI_1_and_Other_Attributes_Required_To_Infect_the_Host.pdf"],"title":"The global consequence of disruption of the AcrAB-TolC efflux pump in Salmonella enterica includes reduced expression of SPI-1 and other attributes required to infect the host.","doi":"10.1128/JB.00363-09","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1128/JB.00363-09","venue":"Journal of bacteriology"}

As in previous studies, lesioned rats that received no post operative drug treatment showed extensive gastric damage when examined 24 hr after the brain lesion. Chlorpromazine, amphetamine, desipramine and isoproterenol caused significant reductions in the extent (total length) and/or number of erosions induced by the brain lesion. Haloperidol and propranolol did not seem to affect ulcer formation. Clozapine increased the number but not the total length of ulcers. Phentolamine, alone or in combination with propranolol, significantly increased both the number and total length of lesion-induced ulcers. Similarities between these results and those reported for most of these drugs in the context of ulcers induced by various experimental stress procedures suggest a degree of commonality between acute stress ulcers and ulcers induced by hypothalamic lesions. The overall pattern of results obtained is also consistent with evidence indicating a protective role for catecholamines in acute ulcer formation.","inCitations":["dc4a9d7e9e45a4a08a50d4fec4e2b6bb82122605","63fcd505546ecf1d3e232333ab6de88979b2102f","84a3ed723fe25d4b08eed8009654773786fb4646"],"pdfUrls":["https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/0091305783900898","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0091305783900898?dgcid=api_sd_search-api-endpoint"],"title":"Effects of catecholamine agonist and antagonist drugs on acute stomach ulceration induced by medial hypothalamic lesions in rats","doi":"10.1016/0091-3057(83)90089-8","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/0091-3057%2883%2990089-8","venue":"Pharmacology Biochemistry and Behavior"}

The spatial regulation of pH within the cytoplasm depends, in part, on intracellular H+ (Hi+) mobility. The apparent diffusion coefficient for Hi+, DHapp, was estimated in single ventricular myocytes isolated from the rat, guinea pig, and rabbit. DHapp was derived by best-fitting predictions of a two-dimensional model of H+ diffusion to the local rise of intracellular [H+], recorded confocally (ratiometric seminaphthorhodafluor fluorescence) downstream from an acid-filled, whole cell patch pipette. Under CO2/HCO3--free conditions, DHapp was similar in all three species (mean values: 8-12.5 x 10-7 cm2/s) and was over 200-fold lower than that for H+ in water. In guinea pig myocytes, DHapp was increased 2.5-fold in the presence of CO2/HCO3- buffer, in agreement with previous observations in rabbit myocytes. Hi+ mobility is therefore low in cardiac cells, a feature that may predispose them to the generation of pHi gradients in response to sarcolemmal acid/base transport or local cytoplasmic acid production. Low Hi+ mobility most likely results from H+ shuttling among cytoplasmic mobile and fixed buffers. This hypothesis was explored by comparing the pHi dependence of intrinsic, intracellular buffering capacity, measured for all three species, and subdividing buffering into mobile and fixed fractions. The proportion of buffer that is mobile will be the main determinant of DHapp. At a given pHi, this proportion appeared to be similar in all three species, consistent with a common value for DHapp. Over the pHi range of 6.0-8.0, the proportion is expected to change, predicting that DHapp may display some pHi sensitivity.","inCitations":["5df3a591b5d5cb204ab59b75533993af14417cea","99202a53b027e101fdbdceb52510e8a4a4392cea","4feffb7aef254e051335c4e7d23ca18d118b47ba","b40314771527cdf655df5ec5b2ccade645cad0cc","36fc1e5330521435cf810bbe2d9e50979ba704df","b4a03eb69eb36270f55e6e149d15111a9536571b","ac8745d055334408c3cb3a64b9ab3727009f03b8","a9e16378aca97419bce4dbdcad2ee3c4397fff08","008f046b749c978edad8c01cdda7877bfce3cb17","2c912e87c96e9b04379a760051b766bcfc08987b","f7ae5deb50ebe112fbcd95435a518ab33af8f733","c805cd46196f1468a1b62e9a634073381460d792","d9b15d0ba21dd1e3857ef36ead5d6053cf9b89ba","388130a2f2457f099fde0aac76ab7c25208678ca","7de41f26ffd755f7198f9a122abd1e87bbdec19c","d226c2a065fdb24a4eacb5d6b2264fdaf6f2eb70","ebe3b06d4aba143b0d06fc6c7f04d02ef0b07464","a9509240520606fcf5a7062b4212ba0108a5f06d","e228bbf99a2b7ed52eaf35d32d33b82ebf0b3e01","99206df7104744956feb34fdeea87721a6bc0875","d2095d7715555506ac8e5c636825d41a57ff32e8","bf6374b4658321f3e3e1ea6a9ef1200396170aaa","ccd6b0e9102f649c8b080f2d9d4f900d3d78c161","c80f496d28be9b82bbdbeaacdfda6aa0b2f8a1ad","eb3dcba0c5c18c610f8de94d28d4a27d02582a14","591a37ebf5bff74f019283ad1a935b373477e66e","fafb4ef3f4f4d309a4d4bcba52a727172a83c61c"],"pdfUrls":["http://ajpheart.physiology.org/content/ajpheart/285/3/h1236.full.pdf","http://ajpheart.physiology.org/content/ajpheart/285/3/H1236.full.pdf"],"title":"Intracellular proton mobility and buffering power in cardiac ventricular myocytes from rat, rabbit, and guinea pig.","doi":"10.1152/ajpheart.00277.2003","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1152/ajpheart.00277.2003","venue":"American journal of physiology.

Such macrocyclic complexes include transition-metal porphyrins (MPs) or phthalocyanines (MPcs)-like molecules, and nitrogen-chelated transition metal clusters in a carbon matrix (pyrolyzed M-N4/C). Although extensive research has been carried out to acquire understanding on how the ORRs progress on these M-N4 macrocyclic complexes, there are still several key fundamental aspects to be clarified. It is still debatable about the nature of the active sites of M-N4 complex catalysts for the ORRs and the ORR reaction mechanisms on the M-N4/C catalysts. In this chapter, we reviewed the studies of ORRs on M-N4 macrocyclic complexes up to date from both experimental and computational perspectives. First, we surveyed the experimental results about the various factors affecting the catalytic performance of the M-N4 macrocyclic complexes for ORR. Then, we specifically discussed how heat treatment and carbon nanostructured substrates would significantly enhance the catalytic performance of the M-N4 macrocyclic catalysts. As the focus of this paper, we summarized the advancements on application of quantum mechanical calculations to gain insights into the ORRs on the M-N4 macrocyclic catalysts at an electronic and atomistic scale.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Oxygen Electroreduction on M-N4 Macrocyclic Complexes","doi":"10.1007/978-3-319-31172-2_1","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-31172-2_1","venue":""}

It is shown that the spectra of several experimental signals can be approximated by trend lines whose slope characterizes their fractional behavior. For the PPP reconstruction of each signal, the time lags are calculated through the fractal dimension. Moreover, to obtain a smooth PPP, the noisy signals are filtered through wavelets. The behavior of the spectra reveals a relationship with the fractal dimension of the PPP and the corresponding time delay.","inCitations":["9795980785d32add3c4c6ee32d19a8dcbb6c44cf","6051cf583734e5031c0bbe3a292d22a786a0fbff"],"pdfUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jose_Tenreiro_Machado/publication/226266904_Representation_of_robotic_fractional_dynamics_in_the_pseudo_phase_plane/links/0fcfd505c26f600f9f000000.pdf"],"title":"Representation of robotic fractional dynamics in the pseudo phase plane","doi":"10.1007/s10409-011-0405-4","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10409-011-0405-4","venue":""}

Previous studies showed subjects with neck pain had altered muscle recruitment patterns that persisted throughout the sustained computing task. Moreover, some studies reported that working posture and psychological stress also influence muscle recruitment. Therefore the aim of this study was to investigate the interaction effect of working posture and psychological stress on muscle activity. Fourteen subjects (7 neck pain subjects and 7 healthy subjects) were recruited in this study. This study designated two working postures (upright sitting posture/ backward sitting posture) and two levels of psychological stress (standard typing task/ stressful typing task), and used surface EMG to collect the muscle activity of the upper trapezius and cervical erector spinae during a10-min typing process. Results showed psychological stress trends to increase the muscle activity, while a backward sitting posture trends to decrease muscle activity. Considering the busy and stressful life in modern lifestyle, this study suggests subjects with neck pain should maintain a backward sitting posture during computer use.","inCitations":["da861587d1026be7a388e254eb4ec2ba18b7c040","440042ff4b4da11309ae3c244fe6ce0448b6a1bc","3ae93e10080e3d93b5a568804c8c17f8a4d34986","5a50f4438c6f3a1015793159f8793e4c1be9da8a","161053e00f702a8e712349a95c13cf02a5543dfc"],"pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-21716-6_3"],"title":"The Interaction Effect of Posture and Psychological Stress on Neck-Shoulder Muscle Activity in Typing: A Pilot Study","doi":"10.1007/978-3-642-21716-6_3","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-21716-6_3","venue":"HCI"}

This paper examines the specified group of drivers from historical aspect and gives an overview of definitions of the group of young drivers through the Croatian regulations that also define road traffic safety. The issue of young drivers has been mapped through eligibility for taking driving tests, acquisition of necessary knowledge and skills, responding to traffic situations, and finally the participation of this specified group of drivers in traffic issues. An initial quantitative research was conducted in year 2011, under the topic of young drivers, entitled “Recognition of traffic rules and regulations of young drivers in road safety” in the Police Academy, Zagreb, 1.

With the advent of arthroscopic repair techniques some surgeons reported higher recurrence rates than with open methods but some of those reports included patients with a variety of problems, including bone loss and those continuing in contact sports. It is unclear whether recurrence rates would be higher in patients without bone loss and those willing to forego contact sports.Questions/purposesWe therefore determined recurrence rates and functional scores after arthroscopic revision shoulder stabilization in patients without bone loss and those not subsequently participating in contact sports.Patients and MethodsWe retrospectively reviewed 16 patients who underwent a revision arthroscopic Bankart repair using suture anchors. An arthroscopic approach was selected in patients with a unilateral traumatic injury and mild to moderate bone loss. Arthroscopic stabilization was contraindicated in patients with (1) multidirectional shoulder instability; (2) greater than 25% glenoid bone loss; (3) a Hill Sachs lesion involving more than one-third of the articular surface of the humeral head; and (4) patients electing to continue pursuing contact sports. At followup, physical examination of both shoulders was conducted. Several functional scores (Rowe, UCLA, and Constant & Murley) were compiled. The minimum followup was 24 months (mean, 31 months; range, 24–46 months).ResultsThe UCLA score (22–31), Constant & Murley score (69–80), and Rowe score (33–80) all improved. Shoulder instability recurred in three of the 16 patients, two sustaining dislocations and one a subluxation. One recurrence was the result of new trauma and this patient underwent an open Latarjet procedure; the other two patients refused further surgery.ConclusionsRevision arthroscopic Bankart repair using suture anchors was associated with a low recurrence rate and restoration of acceptable function in patients without bone loss and not participating in contact sports.Level of Evidence Level IV, therapeutic study.

Since that time, numerous studies, both controlled and uncontrolled, have suggested its utility for the treatment of pain related to acute musculoskeletal injury, postoperative pain, pain of peripheral vascular origin, pain of myocardial ischemia and chronic pain of a variety of causes. Pain of labor in delivery is affected equivocally. Pain complicating cancer has not been reliably relieved. A small number of controlled studies fail to demonstrate benefit, but the preoponderance of evidence suggests that electrical stimulation of the peripheral nervous system is a useful adjunct in the management of many pain states. Most studies indicate that the resultant analgesia is not opioid-dependent. Pain threshold and perception both appear to be reduced. The physiological mechanism by which pain is affected is not defined; local neural blockade, branch block in the dorsal horn and activation of a central inhibitory system have all been postulated.","inCitations":["a083855befe472ca443dbd4b756ba142ace6336c","f8b506d8fbe9ab5a8132f4cfb8a82701ee901dfe","c85de0d3f1d561916241cef186c2d675c96ff128","ef5f91a9dec51c82e6dd64fe54e3e4048bb38205","eba1c9394b023eb868108fcd65e6afe0415de8b7","5b5f5e99a083448afbc67848474f8d4df1d42a95","7cfaf9f40cdb5675716aedb7f3012d8b6d3ed81b","cc0a53000bc22b79ecb8e045c6ded321bf0c2de8","e88c0d6889d52ee97c3ef241a0a80be8cc3cd3b0","99e2922d6f3e2883a8012fb32d66bc675b9df35a","a70684d7dcb6885100169df484b560d6bccebb27","11cc7bf438c80423fb4b1e404cf85bb0863f0053"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Fifteen years of transcutaneous electrical stimulation for pain control.","doi":"10.1159/000099388","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1159/000099388","venue":"Stereotactic and functional neurosurgery"}

Compared to sisal fiber bundle (SFB), elementary sisal fibers (ESFs) afford a superior deposited substrate for Ni NPs, which exhibit highest catalytic rate constant 16.14 × 10−3 s−1 and turnover frequency 1.82 × 10−3 mol mol−1 s−1 at 20 °C and molar ratio of NaBH4: p-NP (100) for reduction of p-NP with only 3.39 wt.% Ni. The outstanding performance of Ni/ESFs obtained here can be assigned to the high content of metallic nickel in nanoparticles, the flexible fiber based 3D network and the synergistic effect of Ni NPs and ESFs. Ni/ESF catalysts were also successfully applied for the catalytic hydrogenation of methyl orange (MO) and Rhodamine B (RhB). Moreover, present catalyst further exhibited excellent reusability derived from their stable physic-chemical structure and magnetically separable feature in the catalytic reaction. As a result, supported by the widely-available sisal fiber templates with tailored structures, present catalysts show the certain superiority in cost-effective hydrogenation of refractory aromatic pollutants compared to the catalysts reported in the literatures.","inCitations":["f12c9996ec215a9dcae77dee9daa4b85f9ff6403"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Nanosized nickel decorated sisal fibers with tailored aggregation structures for catalysis reduction of toxic aromatic compounds","doi":"10.1016/j.indcrop.2018.04.031","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.indcrop.2018.04.031","venue":""}
