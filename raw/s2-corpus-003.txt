Life expectancy and trends over time were estimated by neurological grouping, age and gender, using logistic regression of person-years of follow-up combined with standard life table calculations.Results:For the 5483 cases of traumatic SCI the mean age at injury was 35.1 years, 79.7% were male, 31.1% had tetraplegia AIS/Frankel ABC, 41.2% paraplegia ABC,and 27.7% functionally incomplete lesion (all Ds). On 31 December 2014, 54% were still alive, 42.3% had died and 3.7% were lost to follow-up. Estimated life expectancies improved significantly between the 1950s and 1980s, plateaued during the next two decades, before slightly improving again since 2010. The estimated current life expectancy, compared with the general British population, ranged from 18.1 to 88.4% depending on the ventilator dependency, level and completeness of injury, age and gender.Conclusions:Life expectancy after SCI improved significantly between the 1950s and 1980s, plateaued during the 1990s and 2000s, before slightly improving again since 2010, but still remains well below that of the general British population.Sponsorship:Buckinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust Charitable Spinal Fund and Ann Masson Legacy for Spinal Research Fund, UK.","inCitations":["0e68210fbe74aba6af41e2020b636aab8f8711ef","a5b3d61256ad059de5f62ccb1b4ebd41f1e98ebf","101e2abb02596c1218724351e60f111b945df1a3","8c7d2759a2f0f50de5eef54a10b6bd0c8ddbe9cd","5287a36ac821063b60e771ca2d452abaae184ddc","4702275622e3b9c8dfeb5cdf3750c3f26590d864","a2a6246dd16ae6d3894f836ab0dcd69f560ef986","bf21dd1093a2814c714e07d699ec8f93ac19dc9f","231bdc2677cada12ad8e02cba39d6321913dcca2","b63f274aaf0054fb864135d42e85a15fb3c89308","6d29d1a39bf5e33f86848f5bf0d7bf260f213e7b","92f03389ff9201fc37492938a66b8367260e8073","541675626665a830967135a7b2641eaead1e2b4e","871184a5491abf9cf7f6e791a23f81445a885da3","676ba5a29376387ece360232adddf70f8ac8876d","f3ae3a1e8df83b52baf185e57ad86c8220bbe2c2","9362a777ada539ccd39bbef9e231bed8c1ed544e","f4321a67f024c1f0fa7e3357b3122a6def6e2a2e","a7cd08290aa2c194766a75561834edc64e3691a9","d577fec13d562f447f23338669509d79911a4ff2","a163f9248c452b9ba458357f82af96c1384d2e1d","aa7b20ec8a1b3477db9dfcd074e10354741000d8","ce71ba420502c9f74a5f8759d3daa83c1fc8f39c","2b63e43222f24c470ba8f664df7c08b5dbc3e068","6618e805a91e302ad08f63d447ee3ca08d22cfa7","a56badf093f4af07c82bfe3625c67f5e7de1956d","6e1ea2c85d0fa152d2b569fe97928e4d4a695017","93564b5738f58950efe62d7248caa315affb6518"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.lifeexpectancy.org/articles/savic2017.pdf"],"title":"Long-term survival after traumatic spinal cord injury: a 70-year British study","doi":"10.1038/sc.2017.23","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1038/sc.2017.23","venue":"Spinal Cord"}

On the basis of the MP2 results, there are at least four conformers in the gas-phase mixture. The most stable structure is a cyclic conformer without intramolecular hydrogen bond. The equilibrium composition in the aqueous solution is dominated by structures with extended conformations. The conformational preference is the result of a subtle balance of internal free energy and solvation terms. The extended structure is the favored one in a mixed solvent comprised of methanol and chloroform, as well. Calculations predict 1.9 and 2.3 kcal/mol activation free energy for the formation of a cyclic conformer, prerequisite for lactonization, in aqueous solution and in the methanol/chloroform solvent,...","inCitations":["ad64d556d11906698f909983e82a64e3531a2c29","e77226397ee59d3c8259d563d15d7ffb60583664"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Theoretical Studies on the Conformational Equilibria of the γ-Hydroxybutyric Acid in the Gas Phase and in Solution","doi":"10.1021/jp9710648","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1021/jp9710648","venue":""}

A combination of bracing, tuned mass dampers and viscous dampers form the main elements of the system that will be installed onto the 320m long footbridge with its main span of 144m. Initial designs for the damping system have been refined as a result of prototype testing which has been carried out over the last few months on the bridge. Consultant Ove Arup, which designed the bridge along with architect Foster & Partners, has spent the last six months investigating the cause of the movement, checking the original design and computer models, developing, installing and testing the prototype, and developing and refining the designs for the final system that will be installed on the bridge over the coming months.

Material and Method: In this cross-sectional study, the expression of caveolin-1 was evaluated immunohistochemically in 75 samples including 18 cases of dentigerous cyst, 18 odontogenic keratocysts, 3 orthokeratinized odontogenic cysts, 2 calcifying odontogenic cysts and 34 ameloblastomas (solid and unicystic). Results: Positive immunohistochemical reaction was found in 100% of odontogenic cysts and this was significantly more than both unicystic (65%) and solid (55%) ameloblastomas. Conclusion: The present study showed the expression of caveolin-1 in all odontogenic cysts and more than ameloblastomas. The results suggested that absence of caveolin-1 might enhance aggressiveness of odontogenic lesions and could be a useful marker for distinguishing ameloblastomas from other odontogenic lesions. ÖZ Amaç: Bu calışmanın amacı, bir grup odontojenik kist ve tumorde caveolin-1 ekspresyonunu değerlendirmektir. Gereç ve Yöntem: Bu calışmada, caveolin-1 ekspresyonu, 18 dentigeroz kist, 18 odontojenik keratosit, 3 ortokeratinize odontojenik kist, 2 kalsifiye odontojenik kist ve 34 ameloblastomu (solid ve unikistik) iceren 75 olguda immunohistokimyasal olarak değerlendirilmiştir. Bulgular: Odontojenik kistlerin % 100’unde pozitif immunohistokimyasal reaksiyon saptanmıştır. Bu sonuc hem unikistik (% 65) hem de solid (% 55) ameloblastomada saptanandan anlamlı olcude yuksektir. Sonuç: Bu calışma caveolin-1 ekspresyonunun, butun odontojenik kistlerde ameloblastomalardan daha fazla olduğunu gostermiştir. Bulgular caveolin-1 yokluğunun odontojenik lezyonların agresivitesini arttırabileceğini ve ameloblastomaların diğer odontojenik lezyonlardan ayırt edilebilmesi icin yararlı bir gosterge olabileceğini ortaya koymuştur.","inCitations":["f1bd8ecc8122b5edd09a6e86ded0546db4fe1579","eae63a8455a73339ea21070a617bd9b8c2bcea88","3e0731a9dca84ad1b8a063e9b5667dcd026eb6a8","9d049fb6ca13deb040dba4d2241839d350a66d82"],"pdfUrls":["https://www.degruyter.com/downloadpdf/j/tjop.2014.30.issue-2/tjpath.2014.01241/tjpath.2014.01241.pdf","http://www.turkjpath.org/pdf/pdf_TPD_1675.pdf"],"title":"Caveolin-1 Expression in Odontogenic Cysts and Ameloblastomas","doi":"10.5146/tjpath.2014.01241","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.5146/tjpath.2014.01241","venue":"Turk patoloji dergisi"}

Recent studies have described that PD-L1 is heterogeneously expressed in various types of cancer, although its prognostic/predictive value is still uncertain. These problems are partly due to a not well defined operating protocol for its detection by immunohistochemistry, but also because most of the studies conducted on large case series were made by Tissue Micro Array (TMA). We are going to discuss this latter point, to highlight that TMA must be set up in an appropriate manner, especially for some markers, such as PD-L1, which, besides being poorly expressed in tumor cells, can be expressed by cells of the tumor microenvironment.","inCitations":["56b293b3e47aaf25c0c6a663d3f222660565d9f9","59ffb23f5d7bf4dbc456f56a48030742d1d7beeb","04651018bc6647e556ad2ad496e083bc2ae7e9b8","fbf484f7c328339d9d178d926cb139f9b5f39e71","a562c64e883f8bdb32d55831582e507e14600ce8","8934aa86a60358625fb84a027f3608a94471d88d","e5be61faa999ba8316147c47fc077cfc95552b80","afd80ed6d150fd0cf1851d096b69662041a4cd77","501696e7acb5ecc2f38c9a5874bd19907758da66","85e7792ad45583cb4b995d0b7d050c0b19d8ca40","93d5cec1081a61bf9009d7cb08cb81fc08aacd88"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/17/7/1046/pdf"],"title":"PD-L1 Immunohistochemical Detection in Tumor Cells and Tumor Microenvironment: Main Considerations on the Use of Tissue Micro Arrays","doi":"10.3390/ijms17071046","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms17071046","venue":"International journal of molecular sciences"}

A total of 23 hives (10 plastic and 13 wooden hives) were used. The mean frame count for the plastic and wooden hives, respectively, were 13.25±0.28 and 14.77±0.48 (Z= -1.24, p=0.22). Survivability rates for the plastic and wooden hives, respectively, were 90.00% and 53.85% for at the end of first year (Fisher’s exact test p=0.089) and 30.00% and 15.38% (Fisher’s exact test, p=0.618) for at the end of the study. The plastic hives decreased the death incidence at the end of the study [relative risk ratio (RR)=0.82]. Swarm rates were 40.00% and 15.38% (Fisher’s exact test p=0.341) for the plastic and wooden hives, respectively at the end of first year. Swarm condition increased about 3 times more in the plastic hives as compared to the wooden hives (RR=2.60). Mean honey yield per honeycomb was higher in the plastic hives (2264.65±182.39 g) than in the wooden hives (1634.20±191.08 g) (t=2.39, p=0.028). As a result, it was thought that thermo plastic hives can be efficiently and successfully used by bee keepers since they may increase survivability and honey yield and are easy to use.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Comparison of Plastic and Wooden Langstroth Hives in Terms of Some Traits","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

The feasability of protein S100B as serum marker for brain damage after cardiac surgery was studied in this thesis. One unexpected finding was made, which changed the basis for interpration of S100B levels. Shed blood collected during surgery with cardiotomy suction contained high levels of S100B. In parallell, shed blood collected after surgery from drainage tubed also contained high levels of S100B. Retransfusion of this blood by means of cardiotomy suction or autotransfusion increased serum levels of S100B, making interpretation of serum samples drawn after retransfusion difficult to interpret, since the measured levels of S100B partly depended on extracerebral contamination. Th in vivo half-life for S100B was determined 25 minutes, and was not found to depend on glomerular filtration rate. As a consequence, any infusion of extracerebral S100B will be eliminated within 2-3 hours. A model for early S100B release was constructed, which corrected for extracerebral S100B and estimated release after surgery. With this model, a weak association was found between neuropsychological decline and increased release the first 4 hours after surgery. The nature of this association makes it difficult to use S100B in clinical practice for evaluating cognitive function in patients after surgery. In patients who suffered a brain infarction, absolute S100B levels 48 hours after surgery were found to correlate with size of the infarcted brain tissue. In these patients, S100B levels also predictedsurvival. In this group, patients with S100B above 0,5 microgram/L had shorter survival compared to those below that level. Increased S100B 48 hours after surgery was also associated with risk-factors for adverse neurological outcome.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"S100B and Cardiac Surgery","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

A standard trawl with a diamond mesh codend, as currently used in the fishery, was compared against a trawl with a Swedish grid and against a trawl with a Swedish grid and square-mesh codend. The trawl with the grid and diamond mesh codend caught no cod of marketable size and fewer large whiting, plaice and haddock than the standard trawl. However, that trawl caught twice the number of small cod and more haddock (and more Nephrops), as did the standard trawl. The trawl with the grid and square-mesh codend caught less cod, haddock and whiting in all length classes, but Nephrops catches were around half that of the standard trawl. Using the grid meant a ∼75% reduction in revenue from bycaught fish and squid landings, and when combined with the square-mesh codend, a further reduction of 50% in revenue from Nephrops landings. The implications of these economic findings are evaluated.","inCitations":["47f44ab1b9e1aad224182159a0c87e326292225b","f7e3f98490b61171dcd590de8d1d002af321f9a1","5b3891ccc5b486e826424362ed63ee75b1843ea1","d5c3c7da7fa54a327a9f4bb310049d4bbe513cbc","5490fd8c84ce701fde62e607531ee8909ce3d340","a39c8b0c9a52ccf536caf06594c0ef132fbe8db7","5dd4059299d71ccba974cbccc309f9789e23fb9b","35962009da4655a8efd6a8cc3894ff5a6349afd2","42e872d2e1a087c6f78fe62b257c51d31dd68081","cb7ef05dd03591c6ed472f6ed0acc976dd668b9e","bf3d9d02d2001eb010833feb993c6c6c32888d70","2c6cba7f1266b64f8c4fa9bda15075ff505eac1c","0309b8a675bcfd5ea6ba5d457c0398779ecbf153","10aa702c73fa20598d3579c23e0db96bea4b9a7b","44dcf34c1d43f932d4b4894c0db5d9a534b091ad","a53af889c5e8ed859939bb2bfdfda06460703e5b","f3911e8d0eecb0b1cfc86be763ac5543d552b79c","4d796ffd671a43a244b3fcd1246f306662d8a790"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"An assessment of the Swedish grid and square-mesh codend in the English (Farn Deeps) Nephrops fishery","doi":"10.1016/j.fishres.2006.08.004","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fishres.2006.08.004","venue":""}

Data interpretation and their quantitative use in human and ecological risk assessments can be enhanced with mechanistic computational models to help define mechanisms of action and improve understanding of intracellular concentration-response behavior.\n\n\nOBJECTIVES\nThe goal of this study was to develop a mechanistic computational model of the metabolic network of adrenal steroidogenesis to estimate the synthesis and secretion of adrenal steroids in human H295R cells and their biochemical response to steroidogenesis-disrupting EAC.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe developed a deterministic model that describes the biosynthetic pathways for the conversion of cholesterol to adrenal steroids and the kinetics for enzyme inhibition by metryrapone (MET), a model EAC. Using a nonlinear parameter estimation method, the model was fitted to the measurements from an in vitro steroidogenesis assay using H295R cells.\n\n\nRESULTS\nModel-predicted steroid concentrations in cells and culture medium corresponded well to the time-course measurements from control and MET-exposed cells. A sensitivity analysis indicated the parameter uncertainties and identified transport and metabolic processes that most influenced the concentrations of primary adrenal steroids, aldosterone and cortisol.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nOur study demonstrates the feasibility of using a computational model of steroidogenesis to estimate steroid concentrations in vitro. This capability could be useful to help define mechanisms of action for poorly characterized chemicals and mixtures in support of predictive hazard and risk assessments with EACs.","inCitations":["e520a2157c41210c513fd7e40b34f81c26a9a131","652a1bb1ecf8a1900c5f942762bf82ad76025410","e6b333d2cf39c042be1e9d089c4c4b33d46d790e","8d6a26191682fde55bf9e51a3d9afb6a2c9e5a1c","18f1ad3a1c18d290df0676138239ec5866e23475","8a23833f8d5d76b3048d7690fd6533b12fbab657","a3599e208717bc0e480a03c9ae736b3fc7c849ad","aa0c6532e8f3d3496f60b38498bf5c9a437eb2b2","91a8b3135e0ae03f9f5e573c4ee6b4615885a048","bbf938f2baf955ea880c1d26450517bf9d61ead2","cc3a8b3f41b163246e4fdb916cad91f8cd23a93f","1b7bf109fcd6e920a0b0531f9bf71bef516193ad"],"pdfUrls":["https://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/wp-content/uploads/118/2/ehp.0901107.s001.pdf","http://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/pmc/84/df/ehp-118-265.PMC2831928.pdf","https://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/wp-content/uploads/118/2/ehp.0901107.pdf","ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/pmc/84/df/Environ_Health_Perspect_2010_Feb_16_118(2)_265-272.tar.gz"],"title":"Computational Model of Steroidogenesis in Human H295R Cells to Predict Biochemical Response to Endocrine-Active Chemicals: Model Development for Metyrapone","doi":"10.1289/ehp.0901107","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1289/ehp.0901107","venue":"Environmental health perspectives"}

In this regard, the photoionization cross sections of isolated He are compared with other theoretical and experimental results. Our results are in good agreement with the previous results.

The high computation throughput and memory bandwidth of graphics processing units (GPUs) make GPUs a natural choice for accelerating convolution operations. However, maximally exploiting the available memory bandwidth of GPUs for convolution is a challenging task. This paper introduces a general model to address the mismatch between the memory bank width of GPUs and computation data width of threads. Based on this model, we develop two convolution kernels, one for the general case and the other for a special case with one input channel. By carefully optimizing memory access patterns and computation patterns, we design a communication-optimized kernel for the special case and a communication-reduced kernel for the general case. Experimental data based on implementations on Kepler GPUs show that our kernels achieve 5.16× and 35.5% average performance improvement over the latest cuDNN library, for the special case and the general case, respectively.","inCitations":["33313e06736e8235d54620350098ff267fbec850","c465e9e60f499cc55f888f48e55ab3a6bf6e6dd4"],"pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3061639.3062297","http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.10591","https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.10591v1.pdf"],"title":"Optimizing memory efficiency for convolution kernels on kepler GPUs","doi":"10.1145/3061639.3062297","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1145/3061639.3062297","venue":"2017 54th ACM/EDAC/IEEE Design Automation Conference (DAC)"}

It is important to recycle the rare metals from wastes because they are technically and economically difficult to be dug and be purified, and they exist in only a few regions in the world. In this study, ModE protein derived from Escherichia coli, which is a molybdate-dependent transcriptional regulator with the ability to bind molybdate as a form of soluble molybdenum, was displayed on the yeast cell surface by α-agglutinin-based cell surface display system for the adsorption and recovery of molybdate. Displayed ModE, confirmed by immunofluorescence labeling, caught molybdate more preferably at pH 3.0 than at basic pH. Yeast cells displaying C-terminal domain of ModE, which lacks N-terminal DNA binding domain, more effectively adsorbed molybdate than those displaying full-length ModE, suggesting that the deletion of the domain unrelated to metal binding enhanced the binding ability. Our results indicated that the adsorption system on cell surface of yeast cells displaying ModE is effective not only for adsorption of molybdate as a rare metal bioadsorbent but also for the easy recovery of molybdate located on the cell surface.","inCitations":["816310b9f4ed0b08e66220acf15de8a5011ccd5b","364637a701e26714ae9d45bba637010816928873","a474be9e52d9eb3d215df02730cf37d6d15f14ec","c6b3b5e162398f8ed0abaeeae4316b55e8e11861","014b48d4b155417be68e573a098997427794a082","aa19084bfeafa943be4ce6f012d5b80e2707c56f","8237cdcda6867d098dcfdf21d96121b170e31ffd","d1c2bdbebe5ed28757b007a9089fe9ddf20128d3","e8cdd67e7c86c14321254521761af4cd6112bde0","43d0b6640dc35c9f1f3849da42efe2d972a90ba4","b14b2f020d89e76b77c6d993a4bdbe05da608114","7afed38e89d21d6419bc1e6bf53d715efa51bcb7","4d092f26c7f8b48df3119be1daa0353337cb6f29","acd1806d0b67d58663817bb6a14d5e245dce76f4","eb6fc70117dbaed97b57a80eeac544a7477224e1","9acb1d19dcecf645fb26fd722ec0ee0062c71061","3e3b6faf3934c5d5888a9946337f39a4e720b9dd","9ab7e52322d6dd3dac9adbd480445b85824cb42c","29bf76126cd9b6fa531216750b9608c0affbf0bb","4b55b9c8c206a7e5b8f6de973bfc77bdbf27cf7c","797d83d6fe7fc10d28aad5d2dfe2dad868d11f91","44713430b3f1b9f02e36a548a80c3751349e358e","aa9aa2fdf3f9f29453c916b8daa9855077577b57","b053f4f7f5d06779e8b3be6ec09e28eb073e6942","d62a74f933a6eb211f9bdf305724195eb5ecf4ca","8f3a5418200d39d5cf0d8911887eaba0c94aadbe","7238d5bd9faabd28cfcbdece971640295c55e9ff","e942fac1cb5b9811837ef669d6f91c37e728238a","80d5f167ab891057cf3e95e1e30db42b9f46cbc3"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Molecular design of yeast cell surface for adsorption and recovery of molybdenum, one of rare metals","doi":"10.1007/s00253-009-2304-1","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00253-009-2304-1","venue":"Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology"}

We examined the prognostic utility of these 3 instruments in a cohort of prospectively studied critically ill emergency department (ED) patients. Methods: We performed a secondary analysis of 190 patients enrolled in a randomized controlled trial from January 2002 to October 2003. Inclusion criteria were age older than 18 years, no history of trauma, arterial hypotension (systolic blood pressure Results: Ninety-one (47%) of 190 patients were admitted to the ICU and analyzed in this study. The mean age was 56±16 years, 42% were female patients, the mean initial systolic blood pressure was 84±13 mm Hg, and the average length of stay in the ED was 4.2±2.0 hours. The inhospital mortality rate was 21%. The average SAPS II score was 40±14 points, the average LODS score was 5±3 points, and the average MPM II (using MPM 0 ) score was −1.058±1.242.

However, civil society campaigners want states to use their sovereign authority to protect individuals and communities against human abuses committed by private corporate actors and to provide access to legal remedies for those who believe that their rights have been abused. The problem has been that powerful economic interests have thus far prevented many states from enacting and enforcing laws which protect their own citizens against corporate human rights abuses. In the contemporary era of economic globalization, most politicians believe that they cannot afford to alienate powerful multinational corporations for fear that they will take their investment dollars, and the jobs they produce, elsewhere. This nexus between corporate interests and state interests has prevailed thus far in keeping the human rights responsibilities of businesses mainly in the realm of ethics rather than law. The anti-slavery campaigners of an earlier era would not have been satisfied to simply exhort slave owners to be kinder to their slaves and contemporary human rights campaigners are no different in demanding there be legal accountability for actions by private economic actors that violate human rights. It is not “anti-business” to demand that governments fulfill their responsibility to protect their citizens against abuses committed against them by private economic actors—it is pro-human rights.","inCitations":["90a57519b11519f20688d70fe10fd90f2453fa04","30e25baa6bd4599be7a0ac9385d35d8c87cc6243"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Human Trafficking: A Global Perspective (review)","doi":"10.1353/hrq.2011.0031","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1353/hrq.2011.0031","venue":""}

In this contribution, the effect of the structure of methylbenzenes (MBs) in the pore of HSAPO-34 catalyst on the MTO activity and selectivity is investigated by first-principle calculations and kinetic simulations. We demonstrate that MBs with five or six methyl groups are not more active than those with fewer methyl groups. Propene is intrinsically more favorable than ethene when the reaction is not diffusion limited based on the side-chain hydrocarbon pool mechanism. Our theoretical results are consistent with some experimental observations and can be rationalized based on the shape selectivity of key reaction intermediates and transition states in the pore of catalyst.","inCitations":["c3181e5d576da5aa1ba38dbecef8503d850ad1e2","f6c0b0b97fe3c4c386366ed0eab5d637b494cea2"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Catalytic activity and selectivity of methylbenzenes in HSAPO-34 catalyst for the methanol-to-olefins conversion from first principles","doi":"10.1016/j.jcat.2010.02.025","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcat.2010.02.025","venue":""}

All the patients provided their written informed consent, and the study was approved by the institutional review board. Intraprocedural impedances were measured for the study subjects, and the tumors were classified into three types according to the characteristics of their impedance curves: increasing, flat, or decreasing. The tumors were further sorted into seven subtypes (A-G) depending on the curvature of the impedance curve's increase or decrease. Relative popping rates were determined for the three types and seven subtypes. A chi-square test was performed to estimate statistical significance.\n\n\nRESULTS\nA total of 148 nodules treated by RFA were analyzed. The study samples included 132 nodules of hepatocellular carcinoma, 14 nodules of metastatic liver cancer, and two nodules of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. The numbers of nodules with each impedance curve type were as follows: 37 increasing-type nodules, 43 flat-type nodules, and 68 decreasing-type nodules. Popping occurrence rates were 24.3%, 46.5% and 64.7%, respectively. Flat-type nodules exhibited a significantly higher rate of popping compared to increasing-type nodules (P = 0.039). Decreasing-type nodules exhibited a significantly higher rate of popping compared to increasing-type nodules (P < 0.0001). Notably, nodules that showed a sharp decrease in impedance in the latter ablation period (subtype E) exhibited a significantly higher rate of popping compared to other subtypes.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nIntraprocedural impedance monitoring can be a useful tool to predict the occurrence of popping during liver tumor RFA performed with internally cooled electrodes.","inCitations":["4151c11de75b16d7f1c2ce92d4f92547775a9b6c","fc49836cd93a0cb4b79823dee9e6a7ccc903df3a","ea5c29a5a91f15e29206b1c4531ef10bd4c05396","50fb2b21b398605208af3392302ec73ec0ddea76","d5f6461b2976b8004aef46e29a47e1b06048616f","8948332b09e17dd56c91365e456a681681e04790","eb00ad47d80b156788747ce75f04aa8a2e7b8fda","1d242a69b8bd31794c668bd8f031c90a7aa65e9e"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Effectiveness of impedance monitoring during radiofrequency ablation for predicting popping.","doi":"10.3748/wjg.v18.i41.5870","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.3748/wjg.v18.i41.5870","venue":"World journal of gastroenterology"}

The results indicate the following: (i) The forest soil serves as the source of atmospheric N2O at the three measurement sites, while the fluxes of CH4 are all negative, and soil is the sink of atmospheric CH4. The comparative relations of N2O emissions between the three sites are expressed as primeval Abies fabri forest < clear-cut areas < succession Abies fabri forest, and those of CH4 consumption fluxes are primeval Abies fabri forest < succession Abies fabri forest < clear-cut areas, (ii) Significant seasonal variations of N2O emission at various sites were observed, and two emission peaks of N2O occurr during summer (July—August) and spring (February—March), whereas N2O emission is relatively low in winter and spring (mid March—April). Seasonal variations of CH4 consumption at each measurement site fluctuate drastically with unclear regularities. Generally, CH4 consumption fluxes of succession Abies fabri forest and clear-cut areas are higher from mid May to late July but lower in the rest of sampling time, while the CH4 flux keeps a relatively high value even up to September in primeval Abies fabri forest. In contrast to primeval Abies fabri forest, the CH4 absorbabilities of succession Abies fabri forest and clear-cut areas of mid-aged Abies fabri forest are weaker. Particularly, the absorbability of the clear-cut areas is even weaker as compared with the other two sites, for the deforestation reduces the soil absorbability of atmospheric CH4. (iii) Evident diurnal variation regularity exists in the N2O emissions of primeval Abies fabri forest, and there is a statistic positive correlation between the fluxes of N2O and air temperature (R=0.95, n=11, α· 0.01), and also the soil temperature of 5-cm layer (R=0.81, n=11, α> 0.01), whereas the CH4 diurnal variation regularities are unclear and have no significant correlation with the soil temperature of 5-cm layer and air temperature.","inCitations":["08fabe5fad16477aa7b48742d4a3a46d286298bd","257ba234860d1bb65f165331f84c79726c6a2960","d80414857f99a01aea54582e7da1e18a03707340","449f26faf30acad88da7acec1f5fd516c1f20a5d","bbf0d0ab0fa40c7ac2d73881a27cbfe9bff9d891","ab7ac6c2b19f86a78507930ac7212ac48b4a8f6e","5e4b94cf8d9e5e7dc7190b10315626c09cb7a70f","8a4050d94b06792adef961a56dea989c076b88f7"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Experimental study on N2O and CH4 fluxes from the dark coniferous forest zone soil of the Gongga Mountain, China","doi":"10.1360/03yd9026","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1360/03yd9026","venue":""}

It has been determined that besides translating through the single-stranded region, the ribosome can also translate through the duplex region of mRNA by unwinding the duplex. To understand the mechanism of ribosome translation through the duplex, several models have been proposed to study the dynamics of mRNA unwinding. Here, we present a comprehensive review of these models and also discuss other possible models. We evaluate each model and discuss the consistency and/or inconsistency between the theoretical results that are obtained based on each model and the available experimental data, thus determining which model is the most reasonable one to describe the mRNA unwinding mechanism and dynamics of the ribosome.

Direct overtone pumping of the N–H stretching levels 5νNH and 6νNH prepares molecules in selected states (v,J,K) near 15 100 and 17 700 cm−1 of vibrational energy; spin‐forbidden NH(X 3 Σ−) dissociation fragments are detected by laser‐induced fluorescence. Photodissociation spectra of beam‐cooled HN3 display mixing of individual rotational levels of the nνNH vibrations with several background states, with derived coupling matrix elements in the range 0.01–0.1 cm−1. Vibrational predissociation lifetimes of mixed components of 5νNH are state specific, with variations of a factor of 2 for only 0.1 cm−1 energy differences. Average lifetimes for low J, K are 210 ns for 5νNH and 0.95 ns for 6νNH. The ratio of decay rates for the two overtone levels, k(6νNH)/k(5νNH)=220, is much greater than predicted by statistical theory, which gives a ratio of 4.","inCitations":["3a0a2b36024972a7ea90134f89471b34f1dfc898"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Dissociation lifetimes and level mixing in overtone‐excited HN3(X̃ 1A’)","doi":"10.1063/1.456230","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1063/1.456230","venue":""}

One patient showed, apart from drastically increased Hb A(2) values of 17.0%, inconspicuous hematological values. He had an Anti-Lepore mutation with three copies of the δ gene, thus explaining the high Hb A(2) level. Two other patients had Hb A(2) levels in the lower borderline range and increased Hb F levels. Molecular analysis showed the Senegalese δ(0)β(+)-thal deletion. One of them presented with an additional mild β-thal mutation leading to β-thal intermedia. These cases illustrate that different gene rearrangements with the same breakpoints in the δ gene can lead to different levels of Hb A(2) depending on the remaining number of δ genes.","inCitations":["f0b7b7b17b911f6f28fdb05c3bb55c804224a3ed","bdc46e407a2d9f828ca2765f56fa36376bbe4191","e6f4c90d242a58c914a8957f62880140b7426940","9c47faecb6aad73f151411b649ac79f3e882e59a"],"pdfUrls":["https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/inserm-00685753/document","https://www.hal.inserm.fr/inserm-00685753/document","http://www.hal.inserm.fr/inserm-00685753/document","http://www.hal.inserm.fr/inserm-00685753/file/110727_Saller_et_al_.pdf"],"title":"Comparison of two known chromosomal rearrangements in the δβ-globin complex with identical DNA breakpoints but causing different Hb A(2) levels.","doi":"10.3109/03630269.2011.644651","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.3109/03630269.2011.644651","venue":"Hemoglobin"}

Sporadic cases of toxic hepatic and renal injury from snake gallbladder have been reported. The toxic effects are dose related and there is a high mortality rate after delayed renal failure. We present a 35 year-old man who was a hepatitis B surface antigen carrier who developed acute hepatic failure after ingestion of snake gallbladder capsules for 6 weeks. The serologic study for hepatitis C antibody, hepatitis B e antigen and hepatitis B virus-deoxyribonucleic acid (HBV-DNA) were negative. Progressively elevated liver enzymes were noted during lamivudine treatment, so blood purification therapy was done to remove possible toxins. The patient recovered after hemoperfusion preceding a series of plasma exchanges. We feel that blood purification can remove toxins and block disease progression to renal failure. In summary, we suggest that blood purification procedures should be done as soon as possible for snake gallbladder-related fulminant hepatitis due to its high mortality rate.","inCitations":["847f0a1675069ab87bb079e757ee714ef41b9d75","7c64482d741aadaaec27117929a684fe77b81129","334787367519ba2e06982afd208cfe0acb9e5148"],"pdfUrls":["http://memo.cgu.edu.tw/cgmj/3102/310212.pdf"],"title":"Successful hemoperfusion and plasma exchange in acute hepatic failure due to snake bile intoxication.","doi":"","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"Chang Gung medical journal"}

Thus, human breast carcinomas contained (2) RNA possessing sequence homology to that of mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV). This type of RNA was unique to the malignant adenoand medullary-carcinomas, being undetectable in normal breast tissue and in such benign pathologies as fibrocystic disease and fibroadenoma. In keeping with the known unrelatedness of the murine leukemogenic and mammary tumor viruses, we found that breast Cancer RNA did not hybridize to DNA complementary to the RNA of Rauscher leukemia virus (RLV). Finaly, and more compelling, was the demonstration that human leukemic cells (3) and human lymphomas (4), including Burkitt's disease (5), contain RNA showing homology to that of Rauscher leukemia virus and not to that of mouse mammary tumor virus.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://www.science-connections.com/books/moderntrends/trends1/004%20-%20Oncogenic%20Viruses%20in%20Leukemia/164%20-%20RNA%20Tumor%20Viruses%20and%20Human%20Lymphomas.pdf"],"title":"RNA tumor viruses and human lymphomas.","doi":"","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"Hamatologie und Bluttransfusion"}

GCG has five principles whinch consist of Transparency, Accountability, Reponsibility, Independent and Fairness. At the management organization of zakat, implementation of these principles are very important, because if an organization does GCG system well, it can give satisfaction and conviction not only to the the zakat payers (muzzaki) but also zakat receiver (mustahiq) that zakat which they are paid have been used and benefited properly. This aim of the study to evaluate how far the application of GCG principles to organizations of management zakat in Yogyakarta . \nThe object of this study are management of Badan Amil Zakat (BAZ) and Lembaga Amil Zakat (LAZ) in Yogyakarta. The Interviewers were are management of BAZNAS Provinsi Yogyakarta, BAZNAS Kota Yogyakarta , BAZNAS Kabupaten Bantul, LAZIS Masijd Syuhada, LAZIS DPU-DT, LAZIS Dompet Dhuafa, LAZIS Muhammadiyah and Rumah Zakat. \nThe results of this research show that, the entire Organization Management of Zakat in Yogyakarta have been applying five principles of Good Corporate Governace (GCG), But there are some OPZ that still not optimal yet in the implementation of the GCG principles. Therefore Organization Management of Zakat that have not been optimal in the management of the organization, they can see and improve their performance with other organzation which has applied the principles of good corporate governance well.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"ANALISIS IMPLEMENTASI GOOD CORPORATE GOVERNANCE PADA ORGANISASI PENGELOLA ZAKAT DI YOGYAKARTA (Studi Kasus Pada BAZ dan LAZ di Yogyakarta)","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}
