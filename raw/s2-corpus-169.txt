For more than twenty years Dylan has been a spokesman for the young--a representative of a generation and a way of life. While Dylan's originality is his strength, his art has roots in Amercan folk, country and pop music. In this exciting new book, Wilfrid Mellers, author of the acclaimed study of the Beatles, Twilight of the Gods, examines Dylan's musical heritage, from the British folk ballads that influenced his lyrics to the American folk-singers who influence his music. Mellers looks at how Dylan's vocal and instrumental style was affected by such greats as the Carter family, Hank Williams, Jimmie Rodgers, Elvis Presley and Woody Guthrie. He goes on to consider what Dylan did with this musical legacy, and how he made these musical forms his own. Mellers offers illuminating commentary on virtually every song recorded by Dylan, and shows why his individual contribution has spoken so powerfully to millions of people.","inCitations":["b2d47bc9fbf411d522c159bef7594ad337bed517","3c3f32e10457fb55d4a346e9d512492f30668273","8a367661aaaf8a0b647aa02dd0bac2eb01808f23","298563f984ad5e3c2ca848ab4935f346a208a3b1","91a1b30d5997d6d75e35bd0bd891781c2ddfa10d","0e03a287326320c74402604ca4cfcf7bbe37d622"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.willamette.edu/~rloftus/ChangingTimes/BobPDFs/MellPROTEST.pdf"],"title":"A Darker Shade of Pale: A Backdrop to Bob Dylan","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

The management variables of co-digestion were the mixed ratios of municipal sewage sludge and food waste hydraulic retention times (HRTs). During the operation of thermophilic co-digestion, the reactor pH ranged from 7.0 to 7.5 and the reactor alkalinity remained above 3,200 to 4,000 mg/L as CaCO3. The volatile fatty acids concentration increased as the HRT shortened from 20 days to 10 days and the mixture ratio increased to 1:4, but did not reach toxic levels for co-digestion of sewage sludge and food wastes. Methane productivity increased gradually as the organic loading rate increased. Maximum methane productivity reached 1.03v/v-d at an HRT of 10 days and at the mixture ratio of 1:4. The TVS removal efficiency decreased from 70.6% to 58.3% as the HRT shortened from 20 days to 10 days. TVS removal efficiency ranged from 57.0% to 77% during the entire operation. It is likely that thermophilic co-digestion of sewage sludge and food wastes is a very effective method both to environmentally treat food waste and to economically produce gas for energy.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"음식물쓰레기의 하수슬러지를 이용한 고온통합 소화","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Five artists have made new work for this exhibition, using objects from his collection. We can never know what drew Peter Madsen to collect and keep these things but each artist has found new ways to value them. York Art Gallery is currently undergoing an £8 million redevelopment. This ambitious project was made possible by the bequest of £2 million by Peter Emil Madsen and his sister Karen Madsen, both from York. Their gift also included Peter’s diverse collection of paintings, books, prints, small sculptures and ethnographic objects. York Art Gallery has been allowed to sell any pieces not taken into the City’s art collections. \n \nOf course, the historical importance and artistic quality of some works meant they had to be kept. Other works were sold at auction, happily passing into the care of other collectors whilst adding to the monetary value of the gift. \n \nI produced 40 new paintings for the exhibition 'Finding the Value' at York St Mary's. I have used a selection of the figurative paintings from the Madsen siblings collection, to create new ReconFigure paintings. I responded to the diversity of the collection, by using examples of different styles and types of the figurative paintings to paint over with my triangular/crystalline paintwork. By displaying the paintings on mass I foresee my marks creating a consistency to the original paintings; as a way of bringing the diversity together, whilst also celebrating it.

In software domains, goal recognition can be used to enhance automatic help systems and enable software agents to assist people with their current tasks. \nTraditionally, research in plan and goal recognition has investigated examples containing less than one hundred plans and goals. We present three novel methods, based on work in machine learning and planning, for scaling up goal recognition to handle on the order of 100,000 candidate goals. First, we show how to automatically construct the plan library from domain primitives, a task previously performed by hand by a human expert. Second, we present compact representations and efficient algorithms for goal recognition. Third, we describe an unsupervised learning algorithm that allows a goal recognizer to adapt to an individual's idiosyncratic behaviors given a sample of that person's recent behavior. \nWe identify a class of goals for which the goal recognition algorithm requires space and time that is logarithmic in the number of goals. We report on experiments that show our prototype implementation to be fast and show that adaptation can improve goal recognition, in terms of accuracy and coverage, by a factor of two to three over unadapted recognition.","inCitations":["c56ba23a851f1b2170c980f950f6fbd80e2ef267","82b21f6fa32c735f273104ead50f49142920049c","800b53592a62718ae30026858215755b558baab5","9ca0d20aaec0035b96747fbfd81d0ef071b054d0","8929b97979f45e499fd549236847943cf6090a6b","1770ba64847aa676722e187ca11a8ed9e38a8b4c","9de662773ff506248f5d9f3d992e85aea4a0284f","c17d456e38b76ad8352828b30a0ec4247988c04f","e42ec74367c0a3c1ec35e7ec25e6a964e1c6251c","e84b1a296e4ed2f207dbf4c94b66a677887e501e","c4fa5916678778a63a5875bd4548e91c216e5f89","569e6785e87231b71c74842bdf9c64f378f56c6d","d618c7e4001a3fb65bf90b5acd2f7b5d5167187c","4b50d30d05f8ec6c37076271d0ab78bc6996d688","c2e21bf21366294ee459287d6a0c91fbd5f0db9c","98f12304d30fb8f4e26c41ef4851f024c127e4d5","f156ebca2e95cb3a3c7427fa6eff9c4b0955e882","fc5f03ba51ab7a545d0e36ee3c910b064599bfd1","c6f8aa66f0648190c24caeaed34b9c2701dc1c1f","39f999f9b90ca9c58726357cc2f0092ff8ac3a32","1ee1a079cefdceed96f0a0908465c554838a5093","306d3282b1186cc0c7815bb6c8849240c115d126","988c299822cdfab3c84283141f57169e74510d82"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.merl.com/people/lesh/papers/thesis.ps.Z"],"title":"Scalable and adaptive goal recognition","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Aiming at this goal, he attempted to justify sex, art, and individualism to Christians and to describe each in its transformed state. Because of the vagueness of his initial formulation, however, study and discussion failed to lead to the precise new dogma he sought. Consequently, he shifted to a reliance on the apocalyptic process itself; a miracle would have to supplement man’s own efforts.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"The Apocalyptic Resolution of Christianity and Paganism","doi":"10.1007/978-94-011-9036-7_6","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-94-011-9036-7_6","venue":""}

However, there have been no reports on DNA methylation of the pubertal genome.MethodsWe investigated DNA methylation in the female rat hypothalamus at prepuberty and puberty using reduced representation bisulfite sequencing technology. The identified genes and signaling pathways exhibiting changes to DNA methylation in pubertal rats were determined by Gene Ontogeny and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analysis.ResultsThe distribution of the three types of methylated C bases in promoter and CpG island (CGI) regions in the hypothalamus was as follows: 87.79% CG, 3.05% CHG, 9.16% CHH for promoters, and 88.35% CG, 3.21% CHG, 88.35% CHH for CGI in prepubertal rats; and 90.78% CG, 2.13% CHG, 7.09% CHH for promoters, and 88.59% CG, 88.59% CHG, 8.35% CHH for CGI in pubertal animals. CG showed the highest percentage of methylation, and was the highest methylation state in CGI. Compared to prepubertal hyoyhalamus samples, we identified ten genes with altered methylation in promoter regions in the pubertal hypothalamus samples, and 43 genes with altered methylation in the CGI. Changes in DNA methylation were found in gonadotropin-releasing hormone signaling pathways, and the oocyte meiosis pathway.ConclusionOur results demonstrate changes in DNA methylation occur in female rats from prepuberty to puberty suggestng DNA methylation may play a crucial role in the regulation of puberty onset. This study provides essential information for future studies on the role of epigenetics in the regulation of puberty.","inCitations":["ce64aae3fe84f3a53682ab70420f24512c7b7d0c","b68e2715a843a90d5b243abc60dc489e6da5b0fd"],"pdfUrls":["https://rbej.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s12958-017-0301-2?site=rbej.biomedcentral.com"],"title":"Identification of differential genomic DNA Methylation in the hypothalamus of pubertal rat using reduced representation Bisulfite sequencing","doi":"10.1186/s12958-017-0301-2","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12958-017-0301-2","venue":"Reproductive Biology and Endocrinology"}

Circumstantial evidence was provided that the major contribution to the signal seen in these samples was from membrane phospholipids, and that sucrose in the dry pollen grains reduced T(m) of those phospholipids. In the current study, we clarify why a major constituent of the pollen grains, neutral lipids contained in discrete lipid droplets, does not contribute significantly to the signal. Further, we have isolated membranes from the pollen and show that T(m) in the isolated membranes rises from -6 degrees C in the hydrated membranes to 58 degrees C when the membranes are dried without the addition of sucrose. However, when the isolated membranes are dried in the presence of increasing amounts of sucrose, T(m) fell steadily, reaching a minimal value of 31 degrees C, a figure in good agreement with that seen in the intact pollen grains.

This property is clinically relevant for the improvement of T cell-based antitumor therapies. Diacylglycerol kinase α and ζ (DGKα/ζ) metabolize the diacylglycerol generated following antigen recognition by T lymphocytes. Enhanced expression of these two lipid kinases in tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells promotes a hyporesponsive state that contributes to tumor immune escape. Inhibition of these two enzymes might thus be of interest for potentiating conventional antigen-directed tumor elimination. In this study, we sought to characterize the contribution of DGKα and ζ to antigen-independent cytotoxic functions of CD8+ T cells. Analysis of DGKζ-deficient mice showed an increase in bystander memory-like CD8+ T cell populations not observed in DGKα-deficient mice. We demonstrate that DGKζ limits cytokine responses in an antigen-independent manner. Cytokine-specific expansion of DGKζ-deficient CD8+ T cells promoted enhanced differentiation of innate-like cytotoxic cells in vitro, and correlated with the more potent in vivo anti-tumor responses of DGKζ-deficient mice engrafted with the murine A20 lymphoma. Our studies reveal a isoform-specific function for DGKζ downstream of IL-2/IL-15-mediated expansion of innate-like cytotoxic T cells, Pharmacological manipulation of DGKζ activity is of therapeutic interest for cytokine-directed anti-tumor treatments.","inCitations":["d771e081dbc6bde4f05ec49091cc5605b39e83b5"],"pdfUrls":["https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/pmc/oa_pdf/58/f5/main.PMC5440620.pdf"],"title":"Diacylglycerol Kinase ζ Limits Cytokine-dependent Expansion of CD8+ T Cells with Broad Antitumor Capacity","doi":"10.1016/j.ebiom.2017.04.024","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ebiom.2017.04.024","venue":"EBioMedicine"}

The bone optimizes its mass and geometry in order to improve its strength. The optimization process is called bone remodeling. This phenomenon can be deteriorated by metabolic diseases like osteoporosis. This disease weakens the bone structure and causes bone fractures. Among those fractures, femoral neck fractures (hip articulation) are the most recurrent and involve the replacement of the entire hip articulation by a mechanic articulation (Total Hip Arthroplasty). In this paper, finite element models were developed to evaluate, firstly, the stress distribution within osteoporotic human femur bone tissue and secondly, the influence of the perturbation of the stress distribution by Total Hip Arthroplasty on its first stability. The geometry of the femur and the prosthesis was obtained by helicoid scanner acquisition. The bone was considered as two separate types of tissue: cortical bone and cancellous bone. The cortical bone was separated from the trabecular bone by apparent density threshold. In the case of osteoporotic femur the results obtained from the simulations suggest that the mechanism of load transmission is pertubated by the bone remodelling. The degradation of trabecular architecture causes high stresses in the antero-inferior zone of the cortical bone. For the femur with hip prosthesis, the results showed that the implant has significant effects on the stress distribution within bone tissue. High stresses, due to the implant, weak the bone tissue in the lateral zone of the proximal dyaphisis and in the medial zone of the distal part at the end of the stem.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/52461001.pdf","https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00364925/PDF/EJCM_Numerical_simulation_of_an_osteoporotic_femur.pdf"],"title":"Numerical modeling of an osteoporotic femur: comparison before and after total hip prosthesis implantation","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

The distillation of knowledge from this huge amount of unstructured information can be a key factor for marketers who want to create an identity for their product or brand in the minds of their customers. These online social data, however, remain hardly accessible to computers, as they are specifically meant for human consumption. Existing approaches to opinion mining, in fact, are still far from being able to infer the cognitive and affective information associated with natural language as they mainly rely on knowledge bases that are too limited to efficiently process text at concept-level. In this context, standard clustering techniques have been previously employed on an affective common-sense knowledge base in attempt to discover how different natural language concepts are semantically and affectively related to each other and, hence, to accordingly mine on-line opinions. In this work, a novel cognitive model based on the combined use of multi-dimensional scaling and artificial neural networks is exploited for better modelling the way multi-word expressions are organised in a brain-like universe of natural language concepts. The integration of a biologically inspired paradigm with standard principal component analysis helps to better grasp the non-linearities of the resulting vector space and, hence, improve the affective common-sense reasoning capabilities of the system.","inCitations":["58f7accbe36aadd0ef83fd2746c879079eb816bc","c4b2457f492c63c4b2190fbe1426b1b1e42194f3","4081bce79cd21640d55b9153571a73a205acd4a1","b903fc93adb55bb2ae1e3967404c7d1c50d95ca7","7d3628318bbb5c10411af56f3bd9ff76e8f517fd","fc9b02a1c48f7f0578cc45cdd8a00ae91854aba4","f11ae64bb759f55b38bd1189ec7827f84e17b090","dd1c354aecf5b23a3bf73ddd15e80a5269f95c94","94d3b977f1fc144f3d8ee497bea578667c9e9cad","4ffecbc51a4cb100fafb746bd6e4aeba08ac57f4","4439cd37f5a7de6cf7bcb85a51a802713f9c935b","70c621519bc02d7d2aaa79ca2320fe1af38b6f87","bbdcbb3c360c0980f8a2bbd3e5aa7e3dbecf58a3","93d134aa99c918a291df65a9ddd43362c0b1360d","04cc009565e96ac3797b66f04cf3530a73340235","836570938fb3ee94507e80eddfdf1dbef9909216","7fcb6f89de9f11444e7770e8d990dbd7fab2c963","39e657de7f953be6b22392f6776414ef18cb6b87","c1e009ac17ef7a3f243b82f177d2c9729e3694c5","0091eaf7d14672a99f152014f3b82f2484b2dd55","9c5d679f905ffb38f20124d55326937bad4d8584","008a553c27ab700cf1ee9c75af55f651dddd4ebe","93d2724966b0f75b878b5a9d91046dc97ba43969","c96303b6f18d001fd545b34d05e25dafe6f4e7c8","6b623f26482805a3fa6da933323f05f2fd70f458","52c6c37ec8015ba6723b909d9c8e984829c7e336","d1c0f81b7e058cd0e328711f1bc1b7f10836e6ef","a01e5a78d89804ccd0221a5fb814d785ac81802f","21db633c660e1dae528c85d7254e3b195c827d24","ae909072daba8cc71591ca2fbbd2774cf6553f45","15b9c8cab4a86f910244becadd98face047bf464","0ae072c271c875f527abff67fafc7ca3ac0883af","7f61b80678e2028d29849c7651819de7ecd96047","c8a32b0810a58540ef0b10ef8a7e7afbfebd1cea","c1e70e1fdacdf6134216ab93745bd9015998ab78","2fbe54128aa9504898e00b0740a07d9ffd1b97bc","f115de56acf960831cc6f17fbd72c878196fc744","929b28bfc0b99f5b654917a759a083785437043b","c3a9a6d8f6a94afc17ec43c76e1c4d29dc774f5a"],"pdfUrls":["http://sentic.net/biologically-inspired-opinion-mining.pdf"],"title":"Application of multi-dimensional scaling and artificial neural networks for biologically inspired opinion mining","doi":"10.1016/j.bica.2013.02.003","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bica.2013.02.003","venue":"BICA 2013"}

These recommendations will be based on surveys sent to PRINTO members and systematic literature reviews. Surveys on current local standard of care and best practice will be send to PRINTO members in EU member states. The success of this project largely largely depends on information provided by individual centers from our existing PRINTO and PReS networks.

This results in an estimator that is highly efficient statistically as well as computationally.

However, sodium MRI’s role in the evaluation of IVD degeneration has yet to be quantitatively evaluated in an in vivo setting. In this study, we circumvented sodium MRI’s low SNR by conducting the experiment at a 7 T MRI scanner, and correlated the IVD [Na] value with degenerative grades of the IVDs. In addition, magnetization transfer (MT) MRI has been shown to be correlated with IVD collagen density[2]. Therefore, the IVD NP [Na] values calculated using sodium MRI in this study were also compared to magnetization transfer ratio (MTR) and T1ρ values, which were acquired separately on a 1.5 T MRI scanner. MTR, T1ρ and [Na] together may reveal a more detailed picture of the not yet completely understood mechanism of IVD degeneration. Materials and Methods: Three human volunteers (mean age = 42) were recruited for this study. After consent was obtained, the subjects were instructed to lay supine on a Siemens 7 T clinical MRI scanner (Erlangen, Germany). A custom-engineered single-loop surface RF coil (diameter = 22 cm) tuned to 78.6 MHz was inserted underneath the subject’s lumbar region. Sodium signal acquisition was carried out using a gradient echo (GRE) pulse sequence with the following sequence parameters: TR/TE = 320/8.77 ms, FOV = 400 x 400 mm, matrix = 128 x 64, slice thickness = 5 mm, number of slices = 32, NEX = 8, pulse duration = 2 ms, BW = 50 Hz/Pixel. The acquisition time was 24 minutes and 35 seconds. A single observer chose a 4 mm circular ROI in the center of each IVD NP. For each IVD, the NP [Na] value was computed by referencing it to the signal of the cerebro-spinal fluid of 150 mM [Na]. The subjects then underwent self-coregistered MT and T1ρ MRI on a Siemens 1.5 T MRI scanner. MT MRI was carried out using a custom MT-prepared turbo spin echo (TSE) pulse sequence with the following parameters: TE/TR = 7.5/2000 ms, FOV = 25 x 25 cm, matrix size = 256 x 256, slice thickness = 5 mm, BW = 296 Hz/Pixel, echo train length = 15, averaging = 3. The off-resonance saturation pulse was applied at 6.4 kHz down field of the free water proton resonance frequency, at a B1 amplitude of 200 Hz. The off-resonance saturation pulse was applied in a pulsed fashion, with a duration of 300 ms for a TR of 2000 ms. A sagittal MTR map was acquired in 3 minutes and 44 seconds. T1ρ MRI was carried out using a custom spin-lock prepared TSE pulse sequence. The FOV and resolution parameters were identical to those of the MT TSE sequence. The imaging parameters were as follows: TE/TR = 13/3000 ms, slice thickness = 5 mm, turbo factor = 7, averaging = 2. T1ρ-weighted MR images at five spin-locking times (TSL = 10, 20, 40, 60 ms) were collected, at a spin-lock amplitude of 400 Hz, for a total imaging time of 14 minutes and 56 seconds. A single observer then chose a 4mm ROI in the center of each IVD NP and obtained the MTR and T1ρ relaxation time constant value. At last, the Pfirrmann grade for each IVD was assessed using T2-weighted MR images and the grading scheme described by Pfirrmann et al[3]. Two-tailed bivariate correlation analysis of the IVD NP MTR, [Na], T1ρ and Pfirrmann grade was performed using SPSS Statistics 18 software (SPSS, Chicago, USA). Pearson correlation coefficients were computed to elucidate linear relationships between Pfirrmann grade and IVD NP MTR, [Na] and T1ρ values.

The material subroutine UMAT is intended to substantially improve the shear behaviour of the standard concrete options of ABAQUS. At first the important shear theories are reviewed in detail and their advantages and drawbacks are summarised. The modified compression field theory (MCFT) is identified as a suitable shear theory worth being coded for its application in FE analysis. A comprehensive check on the MCFT confirms its suitability in a slightly modified form for the investigation of a variety of cracked structural RC elements. This check is conducted on a section analysis level by means of a developed program called LAYER which is coded according to the MCFT. The main part of the work is the implementation and testing of the material subroutine UMAT which is added to the source code of ABAQUS via an interface provided by the commercial FE program. Finally, the UMAT is utilised for examining the ductility of RC walls. It is concluded that shear deflections can influence the displacement and curvature ductility of squat structures in a substantial way, even though a flexural type of failure might prevail.","inCitations":["83a299de828490f80b6462b394e8cbec88edb38c"],"pdfUrls":["http://etheses.whiterose.ac.uk/3534/1/389791.pdf"],"title":"Investigations on shear including the development of a material model for the FE analysis of cracked RC structures.","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

The mean nuclear area of Leydig cells from other groups of rats treated with estradiol 17-beta (1 microgram/rat per day), testosterone (60 micrograms/rat per day) or combinations of testosterone and estradiol or GnRH antagonist and testosterone in the same regime and for the same period remained unaltered. On the other hand, cells appeared normal when testosterone was supplemented (60 micrograms/rat/day) in rats treated with GnRH antagonist. The mean nuclear area of the Leydig cells recovered significantly (p less than 0.001), but was not completely restored.","inCitations":["2c5e3c3f75e4996550dd92e1eb8d3edd0a778dc6","b82ab268bfa14d04e920defbfff9a2852772a718"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"GnRH antagonist treatment affects nuclear size and membrane associated indentations in rat Leydig cells.","doi":"10.3109/01485019108987648","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.3109/01485019108987648","venue":"Archives of andrology"}

Experimentally, Scp is obtained by measuring the dose rate ratio in water phantom, and Sc the water Kerma rate ratio in air. There is no method that allows direct measurement of Sp. Monte Carlo (MC) method has been used to simulate Scp and Sc in literatures, similar to experimental setup, but no MC direct simulation of Sp available yet to the best of our knowledge. We propose in this report a method of performing direct MC simulation of Sp. Starting from the definition, we derived that Sp of a clinical photon beam can be approximated by the ratio of the dose rates contributed from the primary beam for a given field size to the reference field size. Since only the primary beam is used, any Linac head scattering should be excluded from the simulation, which can be realized by using the incident electron as a scoring parameter for MU. We performed MC simulations for Scp, Sc and Sp. Scp matches well with golden beam data. Sp obtained by the proposed method agrees well with what is obtained using themore » traditional method, Sp=Scp/Sc. Since the smaller the field size, the more the primary beam dominates, our Sp simulation method is accurate for small field. By analyzing the calculated data, we found that this method can be used with no problem for large fields. The difference it introduced is clinically insignificant.« less","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Poster — Thur Eve — 47: Monte Carlo Simulation of Scp, Sc and Sp","doi":"10.1118/1.4894907","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1118/1.4894907","venue":""}

The manuscript was written at the end of the 18th century in a rather peculiar orthography and belongs to a group of manuscripts which were evidently written by a single person, the painter Josef Ceregetti (1722–1779). The language used in these manuscripts is the literary Czech of that time, with some influence from spoken language. By comparison of the French text of Galland and two contemporary German translations with the Czech text I show that the author seems to have been working with the German translation from the year 1730. The Czech translation was probably intended for a local circle of intellectuals, mainly clerics, and never reached a broader public.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Die älteste tschechische Übersetzung von Märchen aus Tausendundeine Nacht","doi":"10.1515/slaw-2018-0017","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1515/slaw-2018-0017","venue":""}

The target construct consisted of two directly oriented lox sites flanking a bar gene located between a gfpcoding region and an upstream CaMV 35S promoter. The Cre-mediated excision of intervening sequence placed the gfp coding region under the transcriptional control of the CaMV 35S promoter. GFP activity was observed in PVX-Cre systemically infected leaves, regenerants from PVX-Cre infected explants and T 1 progeny of these regenerants. PVX-Cre was removed efficiently from the regenerants by adding the nucleoside analogue ribavirin to the culture medium. Molecular data proved a correlation between gfp expression and precise site-specific excision of the bargene in all examined transgenic lines. The frequency of recombination expressed as a percentage of regenerated plants exhibiting marker gene excision varied from 48% to 82%. These results demonstrate that a plant virus vector can be used efficiently to express cre recombinase in vivo providing an alternative method for the production of transgenic plants without marker genes.","inCitations":["9963267d729819855c52482f52e59245be32fd14","36d39c524d5514bd0b3b62aa1d1b48d5bb83744d","bca200e12b598a6e0273949701bd5a09b560fc29","d8f27958ac118ebf00fe359d710c4ee3d4735e78","022ea5a635703af512f0725eb8b75dd5a7d232a1","45577d544a3cbe9930a9425feaf4ceb8a416bafc","9143f2abc6084be58366c957a4c32df5e6adfa2a","f6bf257c7ca7232927726998e9614f4442410727","4775125f7c01797f339b96ab90142243eae5aa9d","6347fd3684ceabca5e6b3a432b1182c613126ed3","b6415d37bb6a36d4c46d2d802ce85fd88a0f59f1","f21e6df4b42d371e18ecfb142d5dd711e3cfd8c7","2dd5b245a764836dbf30eafa288db1722cd7489f","1ac9255e561ac282e3efdf7016587c2e233c4470","1537bf1ebb75335645337c64ff1f852f888932bb","5bb9cfb3b28ca6b74bf89de66b1015ea78fc35e1","a1858fac73115a10cc941f993ff47e5ddd1af71d","2f55ce8d919c7cd9b9e78b74492063649c4b552e","f039c4b10c9224ed6e534458cdb6d7c32231f245","0e6a91389e1649249f046f1b4068db79853f0244","9ffca444e461de828e99e24bd9256288cf4de26d","91de8aa296dae51eb38e6f75065f470b7ad5e400","3952e0fa28272f1083d88f9c341f2086d41af964","1806d89c8ca85571a98ce12c096b2cebe004ff8b","4049d58841e5619f62baf4dc9c90ba6ccd78d58e","f379812587bc5040e03a8e9ef04ef2ef39f77a11","4707f1bde6c93904ce5481e8d38e86a3fc2cd36e","eb22c59e6376171c39e2bfd16e67bc31e722d58d","ec9887730347bd12b8a6cd1e1c35a8aca0e72d91","a908592eba2111750d32b9ef3e634a4cc18e8441","19b9d8aa17450b3d578652ba0d91fe70a9f25fb3","edbe1fa6d1ff084eee445af66b5b74e5ca2e7db9","fa63945eca8bd9bba33203205b06b0374c233643"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"PVX-Cre-mediated marker gene elimination from transgenic plants","doi":"10.1007/s11103-004-0237-8","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11103-004-0237-8","venue":"Plant Molecular Biology"}

For all compounds the conductivity as a function of ω and T can be scaled onto single curves. Using an extension of the anomalous diffusion model the specific details of these curves for the CB composites are shown to be characteristic of the underlying fractal structure. The main features of the scaled dependence of σ(ω, T) of the randomly packed cluster compounds are well described by effective medium theories, except at low frequencies where percolation effects become important. Similar features are seen in polythiophene derivatives at doping levels above the percolation threshold.","inCitations":["e671c855938dbdf41ff19086528be9fca9c6982c","aa4af8c45db8f9ff7986b7babfabe04f6e897b30"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Frequency and Temperature Scaling in the Conductivity and Its Structural Consequences","doi":"10.1002/(SICI)1521-3951(199801)205:1<103::AID-PSSB103>3.0.CO;2-R","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1002/%28SICI%291521-3951%28199801%29205%3A1%3C103%3A%3AAID-PSSB103%3E3.0.CO%3B2-R","venue":""}

The metric ‘bits per joule’, which captures the effect of energy overhead in spectrum sensing, is adopted to evaluate energy-efficiency capacity. We first formulize the tradeoff between energy-efficiency capacity and spectrum sensing as an optimization problem with mixture constraint of sensing time and detection threshold. Under some certain condition on the domain of detection threshold, i.e. in which we can't improve energy-efficiency capacity through increasing the detection probability, the original optimization problem can be reduced to a new unconstrained one, which only relates to sensing time. Then the existence and uniqueness of optimal sensing time to achieve maximum energy-efficiency capacity are discussed and a low-complexity algorithm is proposed to obtain the optimal solution. Finally, numerical simulation is performed to verify the theoretical analysis results. The simulation results indicate that hybrid spectrum sharing is remarkably beneficial to energy-efficient transmission in cognitive radio networks (CRN). And the proposed algorithm can quickly converge to the optimal solution.","inCitations":["376cdcba85f7414f8d84a5bfad5451066f4b61d6"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Optimal energy-efficiency capacity and sensing tradeoff for hybrid spectrum sharing in CRN","doi":"10.1016/S1005-8885(11)60238-0","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/S1005-8885%2811%2960238-0","venue":""}

Thus a god presented with arrows, being no more than Apolle, whose shafts of life pursue the rolling earth, may by a far tribe, to whose eyes a statue might come, be taken for a god of the chase, or a god of war, the symbolic arrows becoming actual in the new interpretation of them. It is my spontaneous intention to use this attitude of primitive ingenuousness with a purely literary art, and to make the god Janus bear, for my personal purpose, a meaning to be drawn, no ways out of his divineness but rather out of the effigies thereof. The god Janus faces two ways and this, which the ancients no doubt meant should be the image and presentation of the severing and scission that war is, I shall recompose to a meaning personal to my purpose. I shall use that fanciful meaning in this work and take the two faces of the god to be a symbol of that impartiality with which I hope, before the Gods, to approach the subject of these essays. It will be claimed that no two things so much differ as the divine meaning of the God and the literary intention I read in his figuring; but that is no matter, for if that thing I claim to have, and in the name of which I image the god thus, is a reality in these pages, justification shall be ample to all of the slight damage done to the antique purity of the fable, and to the human logic of the divine nature. I intend to examine the present war with entirely neutral eyes, looking on the events and the workings that are showed on this visible plane with a heart foregiven to no side, a mind sold to no compassion nor to no admiration, single and simple in that pursuit of truth in which alone, in these evil Christian and humanitarian ages, there can be salvation for that inner discipline which was the pride of the classics and the heritage of the ancient world. In throwing open, therefore, the doors of my Temple of Janus, I do but declare war upon prejudice and passion, setting upon the two horizons of the hour to the double vision of the impartial god.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"It is a common occurrence in the life of religions...","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Rounding out this result, we show that the masses of flat and open universes are (unsurprisingly) divergent. We also present closed-form solutions for the trajectory of the boundary of a finite spherical patch of homogeneous pressureless dust for each class of curvature, exploring the dynamics of the boundary in detail. In all cases, the FRW patch emerges from a white hole. In the closed case, the patch expands to a maximum radius before contracting and entering a black hole, while flat and open FRW patches expand without bound. We compare our results to the classical expectations of Newtonian cosmology, showing that for small radii the Newtonian energy gives the leading correction to the rest mass energy.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.02249v1.pdf","https://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1801.02249"],"title":"Mass of a Patch of an FRW Universe","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Studies were graded using a 5-level quality assessment tool. Data were extracted using a standardized form.\n\n\nDATA SYNTHESIS\nA total of 21 studies met inclusion criteria: 2 randomized trials, 2 prospective observational, 12 retrospective cohort, 2 before and after, and 3 descriptive studies. Studies present data on more than 22,000 children cared for in OUs, most at large academic centers. This systematic review provides a descriptive overview of the structure and function of pediatric OUs in the United States. Despite seemingly straightforward outcomes for OU care, significant heterogeneity in the reporting of length of stay, admission rates, return visit rates, and costs precluded our ability to conduct meta-analyses. We propose standard outcome measures and future directions for pediatric OU research.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nFuture research using consistent outcome measures will be critical to determining whether OUs can improve the quality and cost of providing care to children requiring observation-length stays.","inCitations":["c06b23fec77e3627e741a6af825973041f49bd72","bc5634fae68540a766ed8535e7ce6ef0d85304f9","f1d06d8f815a15d8110c5349f648dd788025556d","6438e534e81c1aeb45f23eecea2e09c1155baa55","d7414a8e83230f294790404bc1218cd173900c6e","1517c438cf6e85f04310924c21b02f582c51e140","a0fffc66c258ac56fb8df0a6b9bb1d86fd460656","6bae84f65187e3d9c41d467956d0a372dc81f772","d23cc6586ba01fa17d0c0a420fd843a53f707702","4d90ce081e79b327341aae9c8a6011acf08578ef","6f263a722444edb75025da745f0638b0e77dd75c","a20057357c97c37f03f5e38b2d9fe038fcae4d49","82a2d56b4d0632e1065dda214dd6ac8e46b69d2e","d3595b3f024ea17d6c55c83b290e26504b3b3224","8f0a35fc906c2afe71dee3b5b1791ac2f64aedb5","39cab2718d94187a4f18fd88b0731ae806903380","73bfbcbaaccf5f961bb67ede7da4b89c7ada7b67","3e1c44d5fb1877c1fc2d7a3556e3ae3929b58ff9","2154704e169eff776fa295dfea991e3c545ab6b3","46081f6e92e6fec17768e6efecc25f9cc4f114a4","f1cf8287b85e40fc907a5edd3d38213ea0b1f5f7"],"pdfUrls":["https://mdedge-files-live.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/files/s3fs-public/pdfs/journals/592_ftp.pdf","https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/handle/2027.42/69173/592_ftp.pdf?sequence=1"],"title":"Pediatric observation units in the United States: a systematic review.","doi":"10.1002/jhm.592","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1002/jhm.592","venue":"Journal of hospital medicine"}

The opinions, findings, and conclusions or recommendations expressed in this publication are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the views of the Department of Justice. This study is the first to provide empirical information about the processing of habeas petitions filed in U.S District Courts by state prisoners under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (\"AEDPA\"), information that will be useful to courts and policymakers in assessing habeas law. The project is a collaborative effort of Vanderbilt University Law School and the National Center for State Courts, with funding from the National Institute of Justice and assistance from an expert Advisory Committee. Data were collected from 2384 non-capital cases randomly selected from all non-capital habeas cases filed by state prisoners in federal district court during 2003 and 2004, and 368 capital cases started in 2000, 2001, and 2002 in the 13 districts with the highest volume of capital filings (TX-S; TX-E; TX-N; TX-W; PA-E; OH-N; OH-S; CA-C; AZ; NV; AL-N; FL-M; and OK-W). These account for over 60% of the capital habeas filings nationwide. The study:  Reports extensive descriptive information about the time elapsing from state sentence to federal filing, claims raised, the application of defenses and limitations, processing time, merits review, and outcome;  Compares processing of cases pre- and post-AEDPA, and compares the processing of capital cases to the processing of non-capital cases; and  Uses regression analysis to examine features associated with processing time for both capital and non-capital cases, features associated with the filing period for capital cases, and features associated with the likelihood of relief in capital cases. Representative findings include:  Capital cases were filed an average of 7.4 years following state judgment.  Non-capital cases averaged 6.3 years before filing, longer than the average 5 years before AEDPA.  Of capital cases, 4% were dismissed as time-barred under AEDPA's statute of limitations, compared to 22% of non-capital cases.  Non-capital cases have averaged 11.5 months in federal court, capital cases have averaged 3.1 years so far (1 in 4 capital cases was still pending in late November 2006).  Of 1986 non-capital cases completed other than by transfer to another district, only 7 received relief. Courts granted the writ in 33 of the 267 completed capital cases.  The location of the case had a significant relationship to both processing time and likelihood of relief, after controlling for case-level factors. Policy recommendations are not within the scope of the project.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Habeas Litigation in the U.S. District Courts","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

At the 2002 World Summit on Sustainable Development, the GEO (Group on Earth Observation) was proposed and established by the G8 (Group of Eight) leading industrialized countries. The GEO is constructing a Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS) on the basis of a 10-Year Implementation Plan for the period of 2005 to 2015. The Plan defines a vision statement for GEOSS, its purpose, scope, expected benefits, and the nine “Societal Benefit Areas” of disasters, health, energy, climate, water, weather, ecosystems, agriculture, and biodiversity. JAXA’s earth observation satellite program is expected to develop GEOSS, particularly the areas of climate, water, and disaster.

Nessa perspectiva, esse trabalho busca investigar e responder a seguinte pergunta de pesquisa: Como o controle emocional dos secretarios pode interferir nas relacoes com suas equipes de trabalho com vistas a favorecer as metas resultados organizacionais? E o objetivo geral e: analisar se o controle emocional requerido aos secretarios, no exercicio de suas funcoes, e condicao relevante para o sucesso das relacoes com suas equipes de trabalho com foco nas metas da organizacao. Os objetivos especificos sao: descrever as atribuicoes e atitudes profissionais requeridas aos secretarios; verificar a partir de estudo de caso, como o profissional de secretariado percebe a existencia de conflitos no ambiente laboral e analisar se o uso da inteligencia emocional esta relacionado a satisfacao laboral. O interesse sobre essa tematica surgiu a partir do olhar da pesquisadora acerca dos problemas enfrentados por profissionais que atuam em cargo de assessoria direta a gestores. O ambiente organizacional e altamente competitivo e cursos de graduacao, especialmente o de Secretariado Executivo, apesar de oferecer a disciplina Dinâmica de Grupo ainda ha lacuna a ser preenchida de forma que desperte a atencao dos graduandos para a atividade final que irao executar, tornando-os conscientes da grande relevância do uso da inteligencia emocional e da resiliencia como fatores determinantes para o seu desenvolvimento pessoal e profissional. Por conseguinte, o referencial teorico adotado versa sobre secretariado, comportamento organizacional, gestao de conflitos, inteligencia emocional e resiliencia. Em relacao aos procedimentos metodologicos, esse estudo se caracteriza como descritivo, de abordagem qualitativa com aplicacao do metodo estudo de caso unico, tendo como populacao amostra uma estudante de Secretariado Executivo que assessora gestores em uma escola de idiomas da rede privada na cidade de Aracaju, Sergipe.
