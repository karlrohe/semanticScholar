Essential for a navigation system is the ability to recognize the location of a car accurately. Without that ability, it would be useless to provide detailed road map information, road and traffic information (traffic jams, closed-road, traffic accidents, etc.), and parking space availability -- in development under a Japanese project of 'Road/Automobile Communication System'. The methods to find car's location can be classified into two groups : dead-reckoning and radio navigation. The dead-reckoning system calculates car's location according to its direction and distance travelled. This method is advantageous in that there is no areal limitation for its operation. But it cannot be free from errors which increase as the car accumulates the distance, making it necessary to set the initial position. On the other hand, the radio navigation system pinpoints the location of a car in terms of absolute position through radio waaves and has an advantage of always locating a car within the system's accuracy range. But this system requires a vast network of radio transmitters to be eggective, and it can only operate in the areas covered by the system network. Dead-reckoning is basis for car locating but will serve no purpose without some provision for automatic correction of its errors. Radio navigation is expected to give accurate location, although it would have difficulty in providing accurate location continuously. It seems by combining these two methods that a system capable of accurate and continuous car location will become a reality. This paper describes the signpost navigation, map-matching, and satellite navigation as methods for correcting the accumulated errors of dead-reckoning, and methods to obtain accurate and continuous car location by combining those methods and dead-reckoning. Also discussed are the merits/demerits and feasibility of each method.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Recognition of Vehicle's Location for Navigation.

We show that the spectral measure (Plancherel measure) of any symmetric “switch–walk–switch” random walk on $${\\mathfrak{H}\\wr\\mathfrak{G}}$$ coincides with the expected spectral measure (integrated density of states) of the random walk with absorbing boundary on the cluster of the group identity for Bernoulli site percolation on X with parameter $${\\mathsf{p} = 1/|\\mathfrak{H}|}$$ . The return probabilities of the lamplighter random walk coincide with the expected (annealed) return probabilities on the percolation cluster. In particular, if the clusters of percolation with parameter $${\\mathsf{p}}$$ are almost surely finite then the spectrum of the lamplighter group is pure point. This generalizes results of Grigorchuk and Żuk, resp. Dicks and Schick regarding the case when $${\\mathfrak{G}}$$ is infinite cyclic. Analogous results relate bond percolation with another lamplighter random walk. In general, the integrated density of states of site (or bond) percolation with arbitrary parameter $${\\mathsf{p}}$$ is always related with the Plancherel measure of a convolution operator by a signed measure on $${\\mathfrak{H}\\wr\\mathfrak{G}}$$ , where $${\\mathfrak{H}=\\mathbb{Z}}$$ or another suitable group.","inCitations":["b53614235c77da448cc8b49214d41ff9554b74d7","4a9ebdc94f876f91976a61aede35253480d7dc9f","6089b4474ed94a06aba42974fade7009bc77ee4e","ea3c6589d8a365eb4c262549ae164f7b6d6df22b","89d8e049e8ef79f673f4888c7d29e518610ab5be","98e0e78234f085177918255357a470fe7a58731c","ba2e99f60c0ded521cc940e9b5cb034fd7f4cdfb","16765c77da7158af817992ac7ab7371810a3c60f","7ca7d670da3ff7a7fd8678dcbe7a310446e6aae4","9ed6fae4eba81e0a03f9d2ef65f45fa9b1943967","0d8aa8666b470605b995c79785ff2023ee35a0f8","394f19b159614ee9b8ebc3f2f7c9638d535b24fa","f54fa8a724fd5919e7081125531382850a481523","640634988496cba36c8724b840ff4a40ff4bea1b"],"pdfUrls":["https://arxiv.org/pdf/0712.3135v2.pdf","http://www.math.tugraz.at/fosp/pdfs/tugraz_main_0039.pdf","https://www.math.tugraz.at/fosp/pdfs/tugraz_0039.pdf","https://www.math.tugraz.at/fosp/pdfs/tugraz_main_0097.pdf","https://www.math.tugraz.at/fosp/pdfs/tugraz_main_0039.pdf","http://arxiv.org/pdf/0712.3135.pdf","http://www.math.tugraz.at/fosp/pdfs/tugraz_main_0097.pdf","http://www.math.tugraz.at/fosp/pdfs/tugraz_0039.pdf","https://page-one.springer.com/pdf/preview/10.1007/s00208-008-0222-7","http://www.math.tugraz.at/fosp/pdfs/tugraz_0097.pdf","https://www.math.tugraz.at/fosp/pdfs/tugraz_0097.pdf"],"title":"On the spectrum of lamplighter groups and percolation clusters","doi":"10.1007/s00208-008-0222-7","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00208-008-0222-7","venue":""}

Kurodane-kinugasa by acetone precipitation, affinity chromatography on a palmitoylated gauze column and isoelectric focusing. The purified enzyme showed a single protein band by polyacrylamide gel disc electrophoresis. The enzyme had an isoelectric point of 4.4 and a molecular weight of about 90,000. It had pH optima of 5.5 and 6.5, and Km values of 0.24 and 0.53 mm for monogalactosyldiacylglycerol and phosphatidylcholine, respectively. The pH dependences were changed by Triton X–100. No separation of these two hydrolyzing activities were achieved, and the ratio of the specific activity of galactolipase to that of phospholipase (about 3/1) remained constant throughout the purification procedures. Both the activities changed in parallel with each other by the addition of reagents and by heat treatment.

The results indicated that the modified coating showed higher mechanical properties, impermeability and bonding properties when the amounts of polyurethane and silica sol were 10% and 4%, respectively. The room temperature strength, temperature resistance and acid resistance of the modified coating were 25.1%, 34.1% and 32.4% higher than those of unmodified coatings, respectively. Moreover, the flexibility of the coating was significantly improved. The compression–bend ratio of the modified coating was 7% higher than that of the unmodified coating. The impermeability of the modified coating was 53% higher than that of the unmodified coating. The bond strengths of the modified coatings with a concrete and an acid-resistant ceramic tile were 3.08 MPa and 5.84 MPa, respectively, which were higher than the standard value of 1.2 MPa. SEM analysis showed that the morphological structure of the coating was changed. The results showed that a dense micro-structure with an interpenetrating network was formed. EDS analysis showed that the sulfur atom was absent in the modified coating after acid storage. The MIP test showed that the porosity of the modified sample decreased and the pore distribution was improved. TGA analysis showed that the modified coating could meet the requirement of temperature resistance at 250 °C.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"A study on the properties and working mechanism of a waterborne polyurethane-modified silicate-based coating","doi":"10.1039/c9ra04441h","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1039/c9ra04441h","venue":""}

Employing AtT-20 mouse pituitary tumour cells, we report here the effects of rat ANF(1-28) and sodium nitroprusside (SNP), both of which augment cellular levels of cGMP through activating particulate and soluble guanylyl cyclases respectively, on the expression of POMC mRNA abundance. Furthermore, the cellular contents and secretion of (beta endorphin-like immunoreactivity) beta EP-LI from these cultures were also examined. Whereas the abundance of POMC mRNA was found to be markedly suppressed following 4h of incubation with rANP(1-28) (0.01 to 1 microM), SNP (0.1 to 10 microM) and dibutyryl-cGMP (1 to 100 microM) in a dose related manner, only a modest reduction in the release and cell contents of beta EP-LI was found in some of these cultures. It is also of interest to note that in all the cases examined, the inhibitory effect was associated with a significant suppression of cAMP levels in the cultures. Taken together, our present findings suggest that ANF may play a more important role in suppressing the production than the release of POMC related peptides from AtT-20 cells. Thus, it raises the possibility that hypothalamic ANF may likewise modulate the function of the pituitary-adrenal axis through exerting a greater effect on inhibiting the production than the secretion of pituitary ACTH.","inCitations":["c3deb1a3303d0308895e5c44176839039b900757","eaa6bb776048511fd726a362c2f4b33431b84d1f","9ebe22152a97870444c951ec465db5058a2f282a"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"ANF(1-28) is a potent suppressor of pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) mRNA but a weak inhibitor of beta EP-LI release from AtT-20 cells.","doi":"10.1677/joe.0.143R001","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1677/joe.0.143R001","venue":"The Journal of endocrinology"}

Gestational trophoblastic neoplasia encompasses a spectrum of benign and malignant lesions. The relative prevalence of benign versus malignant cases varies geographically. Most GTNs are benign and located in the uterus; benign and malignant GTNs do also arise outside the uterine body. Tubal hydatid moles (HMs) and primary choriocarcinomas are rare. Over a 3-year period, 119 cases of biopsy-diagnosed GTNs were prospectively collected: 70.6% were benign and 29.4% were malignant. Two HMs, or 2.4% of all HMs, were located in the tubes; 2 choriocarcinomas, or 6.5% of all malignant GTNs, originated in the tubes. Tubal GTNs accounted for 0.5% of 857 tubal ectopic pregnancies. There was no significant difference in the mean age of benign and malignant GTNs (P = 0.61). Four (11.4%) of the 35 malignant GTNs were HIV infected.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Clinicopathologic features of gestational trophoblastic neoplasia in the Limpopo Province, South Africa.","doi":"10.1097/IGC.0b013e318284d29c","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1097/IGC.0b013e318284d29c","venue":""}

The general fitting algorithm operates on a coarse-to-fine basis. It selects on each refinement level in a first step a reduced number of wavelets which are appropriate to represent the features of the data set. In a second step, the fitting surface is constructed as the linear combination of the wavelets which minimizes the distance to the data in a least squares sense. This is followed by a thresholding procedure on the wavelet coefficients to discard those which are too small to contribute much to the surface representation.\n\nIn this paper, we firstly generalize this strategy to a classically regularized least squares functional by adding a Sobolev norm, taking advantage of the capability of wavelets to characterize Sobolev spaces of even fractional order. After recalling the usual cross-validation technique to determine the involved smoothing parameters, some examples of fitting severely irregularly distributed data, synthetically produced and of geophysical origin, are presented. In order to reduce computational costs, we then introduce a multilevel generalized cross-validation technique which goes beyond the Sobolev formulation and exploits the hierarchical setting based on wavelets. We illustrate the performance of the new strategy on some geophysical data.\n","inCitations":["5b7c050621af9b440efd99f67c191cc88ccae68e","5befbe0e7e28633600374a8f6e01a54ebe3b5585","8d6db399237a4e0c8ff9c3abfe9b775f9cb13cbf","371a0756544d6589cdfeb918d127032b432f5a06","168a2738db3d9dce3f6c3c64491a18f2a445609c","1d6ef1f1fc56f9e702407cfd3afe6de87ef29cf0","c6d7c32896c9b7295aca06d07780f475b4a103dc","85c4ceddef4d1525f92ee3439fe5756829aed9f6","1f3e032d9b4c9195634eeca580eb2816478a1a48"],"pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1007/s11075-004-3622-0","http://www.iam.uni-bonn.de/~kunoth/papers/Castano_Kunoth_final.pdf","http://www.researchgate.net/profile/Angela_Kunoth/publication/226196952_Multilevel_regularization_of_wavelet_based_fitting_of_scattered_data__some_experiments/links/09e4150f914a3e00cc000000.pdf"],"title":"Multilevel regularization of wavelet based fitting of scattered data – some experiments","doi":"10.1007/s11075-004-3622-0","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11075-004-3622-0","venue":"Numerical Algorithms"}

Due to gender bias approach women find it difficult to gain access to valuable resources such as land, credit and agricultural inputs, technologies, extension training and services that would enhance their production capacity. Equal access to and control of women over productive resources increase their participation in decision and policy making, reduce their work load and enhance their opportunities for paid employment and income. The present study was undertaken to find out the access to and control of gender over agriculture activities and resource. The study was conducted in district Sri Ganganagar, Rajasthan. The sample consisted of 150 households (including one male and one female respondent from each household). Personal interview, observation and focus group discussion were used for data collection. The findings indicated that men had more access and control than women over the resources like agriculture land, farm assets, inputs such as improved seeds, fertilizers and insecticides, retention of produce for commercial purpose, management of labour, management of cash and procuring and repaying loan.","inCitations":["948c2de64e4f3d2ad1b4dd28793b03797c0508ce"],"pdfUrls":["http://rseeudaipur.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/51.pdf"],"title":"Access and Control of Gender over Agricultural Resources in Sri Ganganagar District","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

International BP guidelines consistently recommend that BP is measured in both arms at initial assessment, and that accurate measurement of BP is important in both diagnosis and management. An interarm difference has been implicated in delay in the diagnosis of hypertension and is associated with a higher prevalence of poor control in hypertension. 1 Patients with systolic or diastolic interarm differences are encountered in cohorts with hypertension, diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, or peripheral arterial disease. Findings are largely derived from white European populations, but differences are also reported in African and Far-Eastern cohorts. A reduced ankle-brachial index is a proven predictor of increased all-cause mortality, and fatal or nonfatal cardiovascular events. 2 A systolic interarm difference is also associated with peripheral arterial disease, cerebrovascular disease, and increased cardiovascular and all-cause mortality. 3 The data","inCitations":["b9d714003541261cec4e8a9dd410b0fe9e17e7f6","eb13c7f57117f55bf13b6d6ee260129e8d330d69","eb6b0b638a92e0273736f4aeb24b0855e603d496"],"pdfUrls":["http://hypertensionaha.smart01.highwire.org/content/hypertensionaha/61/6/1146.full.pdf?download=true","http://hyper.ahajournals.org/content/hypertensionaha/61/6/1146.full.pdf?download=true"],"title":"Four-limb blood pressure measurement: a research tool looking for clinical use.","doi":"10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.113.01098","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.113.01098","venue":"Hypertension"}

Although most studies have produced consistent results in terms of types of ion channel and pathways of calcium signalling implicated in the mechanical activity of airways, there are differences according to (i) the site along the bronchial tree (trachea vs. bronchi); (ii) the proliferating status of the cells (freshly isolated vs. cultured) and (iii) the species (human vs. animals). With regard to the electrophysiological properties of airway smooth muscle, the contribution to [Ca2+]i rise of Ca2+ influx through L-type voltage-dependent calcium channels depends on the balance between depolarization related to non-specific cation channel and/or chloride channel activation and hyperpolarization related to activation of a variety of potassium channels. Most of the above-mentioned channels appear to be controlled, directly or indirectly, by agonists in human bronchial smooth muscle. With regard to calcium signalling, the pattern of agonist-induced [Ca2+]i responses, the so-called [Ca2+]i oscillations, has been observed recently in freshly isolated airway smooth muscle cells. The role and the calcium sources involved in these oscillations in human bronchial smooth muscle are currently being investigated.","inCitations":["1de9326e8fb0909109d6e604bc71c71a0065238c","504ae121674123cb0cdd074367304822e9c5fab8","aefa7ed7c31039adb6926f292bbcec4aa0610e61"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"[Electrophysiology and calcium signalling in human bronchial smooth muscle].","doi":"","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"Therapie"}

Kako se tiopurini moraju unutarstanicno promijeniti da bi imali terapijski ucinak, proucavaju se enzimi ukljuceni u njihov metabolizam. Jedan od tih enzima je tiopurinmetiltransferaza (TPMT).

C'est-a-dire, le fait d'associer la couleur pour decrire un personnage ou une situation specifique dans le roman rend plus riche sa position sociale, politique, culturelle et ideologique. En plus, cela permet de rentrer plus facilement dans le sujet du roman. Par exemple, l'utilisation de la couleur ne restera pas dans sa signification primitive, mais montre aussi un aspect politique a travers l'histoire francaise \"bouleversante\" avec l'ambition de Julien Sorel le personnage principal dans Le Rouge et le Noir. Balzac utilise aussi bien positivement l'image de la couleur pour decrire ses personnages feminins. Il nous semble que son utilisation de l'image de la couleur part du regard traditionnel sur la femme qui divise les femmes en deux groupes : ange/diable, Marie/Madeleine, mere/femme fatale, etc. Mais influence par l'observation objective sur la realite feroce des femmes parmi la bourgeoisie fracaise et par la vision du monde utopique pour la construction d'une nouvelle societe, base sur la religion du milieu du 19e siecle, Balzac finit par changer de son premier point de vue concernant le destin des personnaghnes feminins. Mais ce qui nous interesse le plus, c'est la comprehension post-moderne de Balzac sur la nature feminine. Il est sans doute exagere si on relie directement cette contradiction ou disparite - qui ne seront pas sans rapport avec le realisme de Balzac - et la vision post-moderne qui cherche la deconstruction du Phallogocentrisme. Mais il est difficile de nier que, dans les personnages feminins de Balzac, on peut souvent trouver des principes de la vie completement differents des ceux masculins, proprietaires du monde moderne, et que cela est base sur la maternite et le pouvoir de l'amour - caracteristiques feminines dans les principes du mouvement feministe post-moderne. Pour conclure, on pourrait aussi imaginer a travers la vie de ces femmes le triste destin prevu pour les etres, nes dans la structure du dualisme mais qui surmontent cette difficulte, c'est-a-dire les marginaux, vivant avec les principes de la vie post-moderne dans le milieu du monde moderne.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Balzac의 색채 이미지와 페미니즘","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Not only can c-di-GMP bind to nucleic acids and directly control gene expression, but it also binds to a diverse array of proteins of specialized functions and orchestrates their activity. Since its development in the early 1990s, the synthetic peptide array technique has become a powerful tool for high-throughput approaches and was successfully applied to investigate the binding specificity of protein-ligand interactions. In this study, we used peptide arrays to uncover the c-di-GMP binding site of a Pseudomonas aeruginosa protein (PA3740) that was isolated in a chemical proteomics approach. PA3740 was shown to bind c-di-GMP with a high affinity, and peptide arrays uncovered LKKALKKQTNLR to be a putative c-di-GMP binding motif. Most interestingly, different from the previously identified c-di-GMP binding motif of the PilZ domain (RXXXR) or the I site of diguanylate cyclases (RXXD), two leucine residues and a glutamine residue and not the charged amino acids provided the key residues of the binding sequence. Those three amino acids are highly conserved across PA3740 homologs, and their singular exchange to alanine reduced c-di-GMP binding within the full-length protein.\n\n\nIMPORTANCE\nIn many bacterial pathogens the universal bacterial second messenger c-di-GMP governs the switch from the planktonic, motile mode of growth to the sessile, biofilm mode of growth. Bacteria adapt their intracellular c-di-GMP levels to a variety of environmental challenges. Several classes of c-di-GMP binding proteins have been structurally characterized, and diverse c-di-GMP binding domains have been identified. Nevertheless, for several c-di-GMP receptors, the binding motif remains to be determined. Here we show that the use of a synthetic peptide array allowed the identification of a c-di-GMP binding motif of a putative c-di-GMP receptor protein in the opportunistic pathogen P. aeruginosa. The application of synthetic peptide arrays will facilitate the search for additional c-di-GMP receptor proteins and aid in the characterization of c-di-GMP binding motifs.","inCitations":["fa0d401e5ebbf037430b95fc480fd497983bd38e","41c9719a8da2514e7d3df1998a71e93c2a3663de","cad95adb826946661f0055356bc57d2d03325820","99021691a6628e16effdfef6f90a05c3d00768a7","20a15960e4b030bd9711fae2fd561a349b5c91bf"],"pdfUrls":["http://hzi.openrepository.com/hzi/bitstream/10033/583988/1/D%C3%BCvel%20et%20al.pdf"],"title":"Application of Synthetic Peptide Arrays To Uncover Cyclic Di-GMP Binding Motifs.","doi":"10.1128/JB.00377-15","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1128/JB.00377-15","venue":"Journal of bacteriology"}

Recent work with marmosets demonstrated that this species shares several similarities of social behavior and language development with humans, despite their relatively wide evolutionary distance. Marmosets exhibit prosocial behaviors, pair-bond with mates and engage in cooperative raising of young1,4. Cooperative breeding is a particularly rare trait among primates, making humans and marmosets potentially well suited for comparative studies of social behavior. Additionally, marmoset infants rely on parental interaction to develop vocalizations, which is uncommon to most primates but a shared feature of human language development4. The brain structure of marmosets is also similar to that of other primates, including humans4. Taking into consideration recent developments in genetics and miniaturized brainrecording tools, marmosets are poised to become an extremely valuable model for understanding the neural basis of social cognition and language development. Although novel technologies, such as brain recording techniques and transgenics, can also be applied to other nonhuman primates, it remains a challenge to create behavioral paradigms with rich social structures that mimic those that accompany human development. Marmosets, therefore, will increasingly be relied upon to help bridge this gap in the ability of scientists to study the development and neural mechanisms underlying complex social behaviors, which might lead to a better understanding of neuropsychiatric disorders involving social development. Overall, these small monkeys are ready to make a big impact on social neuroscience and the myriad of complex mental disorders that affect humans.","inCitations":["ccf261e512cea1e6b1f290b2fb067bb650f3e1f1"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Exploring social cognition with marmosets","doi":"10.1038/laban.1049","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1038/laban.1049","venue":"Lab Animal"}

El estudio de estos pequenos productores primarios se justifica no solo porque el fitoplancton es un componente mas de estas comunidades y forma parte de la dieta de muchos de los invertebrados bentonicos que la integran, sino que ademas su estudio es de gran utilidad, ya que constituye un excelente bioindicador pues responden rapidamente a los cambios que ocurren en las masas de agua por procesos naturales o antropicos. Es por tal motivo que en el 2011 se considero necesaria la inclusion del estudio del fitoplancton dentro del proyecto “Biodiversidad de los arrecifes del PNALR”, con la intencion de realizar la caracterizacion de estas comunidades considerandose las variables: densidad (cel/l), riqueza, composicion taxonomica, y porcentaje del nanofitoplancton y microfitoplancton. Los resultados indican que independientemente de las variaciones espaciales en la densidad fitoplanctonica, los valores registrados reflejan la condicion oligotrofica de sus aguas, no excediendo las 65.000 cel/l. La comunidad estuvo constituida basicamente por el nanofitoplancton (>60% de la abundancia total) en todas las localidades. El fitoplancton fue relativamente abundante hacia el norte del Archipielago, en las localidades cercanas a Gran Roque, con una densidad promedio de 57.048 cel/l. Alli las densidades fueron mas del doble que las del Sur. Ademas de estimarse mas fitoplancton en el norte, tambien se observo una mayor cantidad de organismos grandes, tal como diatomeas y cianobacterias filamentosas, lo cual probablemente sea el resultado de aguas mas enriquecidas.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Descripción Preliminar Del Fitoplancton En Seis Arrecifes Coralinos Del Parque Nacional Archipiélago De Los Roques","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

This study aimed to assess how physicians in Asia manage suspected antiviral resistance.MethodsRandomly selected CHB-treating physicians in Mainland China, South Korea, Taiwan, and Thailand underwent a face-to-face interview. A standardized questionnaire was used to assess how physicians identify, monitor, and manage suspected resistance and its associated medical costs.ResultsWe interviewed 575 physicians from January to May 2008. Most physicians preferred a “prevention-of-antiviral resistance” strategy over a “rescue-once-resistance-develops” strategy. Physicians had encountered lamivudine resistance most frequently (96–100% of respondents), followed by the resistance to adefovir (18–58%) and entecavir (3–7%). While physicians in South Korea and Taiwan have access to resistance testing, physicians in Mainland China and Thailand have limited access to resistance testing but rely on HBV DNA and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) tests to identify resistance. Once resistance is suspected, 60% of the physicians in Mainland China, South Korea, and Thailand monitored these patients quarterly and the remaining 40% opted for monthly follow-up. In comparison, 70% of the Taiwanese physicians monitored these patients monthly. The average total direct medical costs, excluding antiviral costs, to manage a patient during the first year after suspected resistance is identified ranged from USD $319 to USD $709.ConclusionsLimited access to HBV resistance tests causes physicians in Asia to manage suspected resistance by various HBV DNA assays and ALT tests. This raises concerns that resistance may not be detected early enough to be rescued efficiently.","inCitations":["7a32fed4442366076336e8dbb79f9bb30c46b80c","784afba6bca56eff86aa3cc64d9232f31c86ad7c","ac89ff035803014ae99e0ab65c8cafb9cf053b58","df0895a6e3d12ce40447891701cfbda7ad1ec5ae","98a19a80fa43e6d7bc1251dac9c4e4dd7b815aad","efc27b3ec671c20e6a3be69941967dc877cd8803","5c60aa3460242282b1dc8ce23ce41264aaab8d18","4e7b91a3e2e95b7cca7df74534f6c1e92ec88ea6"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Patterns of managing chronic hepatitis B treatment-related drug resistance: a survey of physicians in Mainland China, South Korea, Taiwan, and Thailand","doi":"10.1007/s12072-009-9139-9","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s12072-009-9139-9","venue":"Hepatology international"}

Furthermore, it was possible to identify early modifications of the artery due to the atherosclerosis progression that cannot be detected with specific staining or conventional histological methods. These modifications are shown to be related to abnormal Fe and Zn depositions in the surroundings of the elastic laminae.

Early season tests utilized adult bluegrass billbugs while later studies involved wildrye billbugs. Types of feeding injury were determined and preferred feeding locati ons on host plants were identified for each billbug species. Greenhouse and field studies compared different species of grasses, individual plants within a species, and plants from different locations, for billbug susceptibility. The effect of grass plant age and stem size were also tested using bluegrass billbugs. Using analysis of variance and multiple comparison tests, significant differences in amounts of feeding injury were determined among entries. Wildrye plants from different geographic locations showed large differences in susceptibility to wildrye billbug feeding when compared in a greenhouse study.

In mammals they play a central role in regulating gene expression during differentiation and proliferation. Mutations in SWI/SNF subunits are among the most frequent gene alterations in cancer. The INI1/hSNF5/SMARCB1 subunit is mutated in both malignant rhabdoid tumor, a highly aggressive childhood cancer, and schwannomatosis, a tumor-predisposing syndrome characterized by mostly benign tumors of the CNS. Here, we show that mutations in INI1 that cause schwannomatosis target a hitherto unidentified N-terminal winged helix DNA binding domain that is also present in the BAF45a/PHF10 subunit of the SWI/SNF complex. The domain is structurally related to the SKI/SNO/DAC domain, which is found in a number of metazoan chromatin-associated proteins.","inCitations":["908d99271628e5f85fcf6c7de2909395093a725d","0774160909b1015b09669bfdb2b9a4018d078d22","64c84a6a314d130c87142ef30fbe63689e8bb6e1","57611cf174325a8873ad0a42dfeae10ecb258807","2a8181a61df60a86e2981c1d5acd8a2794f71e11","112828456ba9e99e1da2407cf2d3ed362f57e147","9c519bcebdf5b161a0c055758e3b88e84da1ad86","32decd9acc25a23cbe9613f518fb03c431809a64","b8f4fd5f84cebdea4266fd374e4e53b59e0b54aa","2e56b526bc5d5610cf3545432aed24929f3fcdae"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"The SWI/SNF Subunit INI1 Contains an N-Terminal Winged Helix DNA Binding Domain that Is a Target for Mutations in Schwannomatosis","doi":"10.1016/j.str.2015.04.021","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.str.2015.04.021","venue":"Structure"}

He concluded that the association of dementia and carotid occlusion in these cases may be entirely fortuitous, and care must be exercised in drawing conclusions. It is to be recalled that in several instances occlusion or severe stenosis was found without any sign of mental deterioration. Only further regular examination of the carotid system in cases with and without dementia will allow a final judgement in this matter. Hurwitz et al. (1959) has also reported the same type of cases but he considered the impai • red mentation as a prodromal symptom of internal carotid artery occlusion.

New requirements are being added to the necessity of maintaining or re-establishing the building stock's usage value. They are linked to the determination to reduce energy consumption, pollutant emissions, work site wastes, to improve the Indoor Environment Quality (IEQ) and all the modern conveniences inside buildings. Two European projects, EPIQR (réf. nr.: JOR3-CT96-0044) and TOBUS (réf. nr.: JOR3-CT98-Û235), developed in the IIIrd and IVth framework programs put the foundations of a new generation of refurbishment decision aid tools. A structured diagnosis scheme covering the state of deterioration of the building elements, energy performance, indoor environment quality, functional obsolescence offer a new concept which helps architects and engineers to approach the building refurbishment with a global view of the whole process, to take informed decisions, to construct coherent refurbishment scenarii and calculate a reasonable investment budget in the very first stage of the refurbishment project. EPIQR project addresses residential buildings and it has been finished in 1998, TOBUS addresses office buildings and it is still in course. The support of these methods is a multimedia computer program. Several modules help the users to treat the data collected during a diagnosis survey, to set up refurbishment scenarii and calculate their cost or energy performance, and finally to visualise the results in a comprehensive way and to prepare quality reports.

T h e majori ty are situated between the gallbladder and duodenum. T h e colon is the next most common site and the stomach is least frequently involved. Usually they arise f rom the fundus of the gallbladder and are single. They may occur spontaneously or may be a complication of a surgical procedure. Usually they are complications of chronic cholelithiasis. Exact figures as to incidence are difficult to ascertain, but it has been reported that they occur in 0.22 to 0.4% of autopsies performed chiefly on persons more than 50 years of age. T h e highest incidence is in the sixth decade of life. Symptoms accompanying the onset of an internal biliary fistula include loss of weight, chills, fever, diarrhea and bleeding. T h e diarrhea may be caused by unoxidized bile salts in the feces. Wakefield and associates s reviewed the records of 176 patients with gastroenteric fistulas occurring at the Mayo Clinic, of whom 33 had involVement of the colon and most of whom, as one might expect, had symptoms of chronic cholecystitis with little evidence of cholangitis. This type of fistula should be suspected in any patien,t with long-standing symptoms of biliary tract disease accompanied by repeated bouts of biliary colic, especially if there is lessening or disappearance of preexisting jaundice.

The study was conducted over a period of two years from January 2013 to December 2014. Total 44 patient samples were included in this study (22 were P. falciparum and 22 were P. vivax). 68.18% of P. falciparum blood samples showed resistance to chloroquine. Resistance was also detected for amodiaquine (18.18%) and sulfadoxine / pyrimethamine (15%). No resistance was detected for artemisinin, mefloquine and quinine. P. vivax showed 27.73% resistance to chloroquine and 13.64% resistance to primaquine. No resistance was found for other antimalarial drugs. Chloroquine resistance has developed because of indiscrimate use of this drug. Proper diagnosis of malaria and drug sensitivity testing should be done routinely to prevent emergence of resistance to antimalarial drugs.
