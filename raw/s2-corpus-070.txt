Soccer shoes face multiple game-related demands. There is primarily the need for comfort, traction and stability according to a survey that was carried out by the Biomechanics Laboratory of the University of Essen. Lees also wants soccer shoes to protect the foot against injuries (Lees, 1996: In Science and Soccer, edited by T. Reilly, pp. 137–150. London: E & FN Spon). The goal of this study was to identify correlations between (i) stability perception in the field and (ii) biomechanical parameters of a laboratory experiment. Suitable field test situations to perceive soccer-specific stability, and a reasonable biomechanical test design for detecting stability-related shoe features, should be identified. The findings should lead to a systematic approach combining perceptual and biomechanical testing in order to increase stability in soccer shoes. Seven high-quality firm ground soccer shoes were included in the study. Three of them showed elliptic outsole designs, whereas the other four showed non-elliptic outsole designs (Adidas Predator Accelerator (A), Adidas Copa Mundial (B), Nike Air Zoom Rio (C), Nike Tiempo Premier non-elliptic (D), Nike Tiempo Premier elliptic (E), Nike Mercurial (F), Nike Match Mercurial (G)). In the field test, 20 participants rated the stability of each soccer shoe on a seven-point perception scale. Testing was done in four different soccer-specific situations: (1) slalom parcours, (2) sudden movement parcours, (3) power kick and (4) game-like situation. Ratings were required for two kinds of stability: (a) stability of foot-to-shoe interaction and (b) stability of shoe-to-ground interaction. These ratings resulted in a total stability ranking of the soccer shoes. Furthermore, the ratings were evaluated with respect to solely foot-to-shoe stability and solely shoe-to-ground stability. The biomechanical test took place on artificial turf in a laboratory environment. The 20 participants were asked to perform a cutting movement, provoking a rapid change in direction as fast as possible. The following biomechanical parameters were collected: ground reaction forces by two Kistler force plates 9281 (size: 406120 cm); supination and supination velocity by an electrogoniometer (Milani et al., 1995: Journal of Applied Biomechanics, 11, 177–187); peak pressures and pressure rates of certain foot-to-shoe contact areas by 8 single piezoelectric pressure transducers (Halm PD-16) (Hennig and Milani, 1994: Medizinisch Orthopädische Technik, 114, 22–25). The pressure transducers were attached plantar to the heel, lateral midfoot and metatarsal heads I, III and V; lateral to the rear and forefoot; medial to the forefoot. The field test revealed stability differences among the soccer shoes. The participants were able to differentiate between (a) foot-to-shoe stability and (b) shoe-to-ground stability. The test situations showed different discriminatory potential. The most discriminatory results were obtained by the power kick situation, and the sudden movement parcours. All soccer shoes showed at least good stability properties. The total stability ranking is as follows: best – G, F, E, D, A, B, C – worst. Stability ratings solely referring to foot-to-shoe interaction show a different ranking: best – G, F, E, B, D, A, C, – worst. Stability ratings solely referring to shoe-to-ground interaction show the following ranking: best – G, F, A, D, B, E, C – worst, placing all four non-elliptic outsole constructions higher than all three elliptic outsole constructions. The biomechanical test revealed positive correlations between peak pressures at the lateral (r=0.91, P50.01) and medial forefoot (r=0.65, N.S.) with respect to stability perception in the field. Similarly, peak pressure rates showed positive correlations (lateral forefoot, r=0.80, P50.05; medial forefoot, r=0.67, N.S.). Furthermore, positive correlations between stability perception in the field and maximum supination (r=0.71, N.S.), supination velocity (r=0.81, P50.05) and the ratio of shear force/vertical ground reaction force (r=0.72, N.S.) were found. Field tests that call for standardized and isolated movements (1) and (2) are well suited for recognizing stability properties. In more complex situations, the perceptual ability of individuals may be diminished by too many impressions and motor task demands. Non-elliptic cleat outsole constructions show better stability properties regarding shoe-toground interaction. Longer cleats at the heel seem to add stability. A tight forefoot upper is a crucial factor for stability perception in soccer. Higher medial and lateral forefoot peak pressures and pressure rates are evoked during the cutting. Higher maximum supination excursion, supination velocity and ratio of shear force/vertical force indicate a more dynamic movement in shoes that are felt to be more stable.

Vocational certificates are signals which inform the employer about applicants’ occupational skills. In this national framework, applicants who hold foreign certificates obviously face some serious problems: First, for German employers, foreign certificates will generally provide less information on an applicant’s skills and capabilities. Secondly, employers may use a candidate’s country of origin as an index of individual productivity. Based on a factorial survey, we compare the chances of skilled applicants from different countries of origin (Bulgaria, England, France, Portugal, and Turkey) to be invited to an interview for the position of an office management assistant. The results show, as expected, that applicants with German qualifications have a bonus, but that foreign vocational certificates are commonly accepted by German employers; however, they are less highly rated than German degrees. In addition, our results indicate discrimination against non-Western foreign applicants.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://www.lehrplaene.org/index.php/zfs/article/viewFile/3263/2784"],"title":"Can Take Some of It with You !

Mandibular condylar cartilage contained aggrecan; it also had more type I collagen and a thicker hypertrophic cell layer than the other two types of cartilage; these three characteristics are similar to those of the secondary cartilage of rodents. MEPE immunoreactivity was first evident in the cartilage matrix of all types of cartilage in the human fetuses and in Meckel's cartilage of mice and rats. MEPE immunoreactivity was enhanced in the deep layer of the hypertrophic cell layer and in the cartilaginous core of the bone trabeculae in the primary spongiosa. These results indicated that MEPE is a component of cartilage matrix and may be involved in cartilage mineralization. DMP-1 immunoreactivity first became evident in human bone lacunae walls and canaliculi; this pattern of expression was comparable to the pattern seen in rodents. In addition, chondroid bone was evident in the mandibular (glenoid) fossa of the temporal bone, and it had aggrecan, collagen types I and X, MEPE, and DMP-1 immunoreactivity; these findings indicated that chondroid bone in this region has phenotypic expression indicative of both hypertrophic chondrocytes and osteocytes.","inCitations":["cd48708bff12b6a2633d545a9bc1b331b3aeb5a0","64191b9ec26bee33914126ace9fd3d5fc8ba1f83","6d6259466b216bd0a294f5a25342ce77d48ce510","d4d09dec3c44eda8202b5d6f2b9346bcbf089028","2eb5d36dc60ea228dafe746bdad6f21bda31a9b6","b03bcd0fe21d846435d427b829d242a37337f624","8e5ae98913ba62a4c25222aa6b460390c15e3b5e","da96874d96330a0778bf1c413d4eaad069c9c0e2","dbd73615416f603cf545f35c39a2331c6b80d563","7fd27c5f2c9a440ddca2f8eda2422a2bbed1e823","bcc1cbbd366ec4c3b391a4773a828cb1e421263a","71af3c81a90dd2854b83f14f8a08f6f68137c152","0e73590dc37e918771b7d846bc47b167efeb8304","a7977c3489a08720ff5cb7771d17d1fd8ea5c1a1","efc12832d2df6957ceeac3c5c2a7becb41e0791f","fd5bd6217cdcee1a578b745ff9478afcc2d0a1a6","160512093f19f97d74efd9c137a4596204972b9e","53c7f3de24120826df6468a6e9ea9b5059e13330"],"pdfUrls":["https://www.ejh.it/index.php/ejh/article/download/ejh.2013.e39/2252","https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/pmc/oa_pdf/33/39/ejh-2013-4-e39.PMC3896041.pdf"],"title":"An Immunohistochemical Study of Matrix Proteins in the Craniofacial Cartilage in Midterm Human Fetuses","doi":"10.4081/ejh.2013.e39","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.4081/ejh.2013.e39","venue":"European journal of histochemistry : EJH"}

To better understand these communication pathways and therefore better design and develop therapies and diagnostics for cancers, experimental methods of probing cellular communication at a single to multi-cell level are needed. Here, we manipulate gold-coated liposomes encapsulating signaling molecules using an optical trap to initate cell signling cascades. The high polarizability of the liposome’s unique gold shell allows stable optical trapping for subcellular manipulation in the presence of cells. Specifically, we encapsulated the cell signaling molecule inositol trisphosphate (IP3), a ubiquitous intracellular secondary messenger involved in GPCR and Akt signaling cascades, within 100 nm gold-coated liposomes and used an optical trapping laser to deliver liposomes into the cytosol of a single cell to initiate localized cell signaling. Upon optical injection of liposomal IP3 into a single ovarian carcinoma cell, we observed localized activation as reported by changes in Indo-1 fluorescence intensity. With established gap junctions between the injected cell and neighboring cells, we monitored propagation of this signaling to and through nearby cells. Subsequently, we investigated the ability to modulate cell signaling by, for example, varying the number of IP3-containing gold-coated liposomes injected into a single cell. By combining optical trapping with gold-coated liposomes encapsulating signaling molecules, we present a unique in vitro tool for studying cell signaling within the tumor microenvironment.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://briefs.techconnect.org/wp-content/volumes/Nanotech2013v3/pdf/1366.pdf"],"title":"Gold-coated liposomes encapsulating signaling molecules for initiating cellular communication","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

The well-known transition to Bose–Einstein condensation in the latter then corresponds to the emergence of “super-hubs” in the network model. Motivated by the preservation of the scale-free property, thermodynamic stability and self-duality, we generalize the original extensive mapping of the BB fitness model by using the nonextensive Kaniadakis κ-distribution. Through numerical simulation and mean-field calculations we show that deviations from extensivity do not compromise qualitative features of the phase transition. Analysis of the critical temperature yields a monotonically decreasing dependence on the nonextensive parameter κ.","inCitations":["94ba0a7e137d5b811f441f04848acd7f0cd73b66","0044f50b7b6ad35eda8b39e915df127e84edec75","ec44bb31dbe9242f505db2674de028e57dc2634a"],"pdfUrls":["https://arxiv.org/pdf/1404.3276v1.pdf"],"title":"A κ-deformed model of growing complex networks with fitness","doi":"10.1016/j.physa.2014.04.009","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.physa.2014.04.009","venue":""}

Research with issues of corporate criminal liability in case Number: 1066 K / PID.SUS / 2017 for mining activities outside the mining business permit area, the following conclusions are obtained:Whereas although a person (the company management) does not commit a criminal act himself and does not have an error in the ordinary sense, it can be accountable. Managers do, managers and corporations are criminally responsible for the actions that occur, namely the felling of trees in production forests for mining even though they are outside the permitted location.Mining outside the permitted area, which means the destruction of the forest and the environment has been damaged, therefore the perpetrators should be charged simultaneously so that criminal sanctions will be more severe and deterrent. In connection with the perpetrators of the crime as the main director, the sanctions imposed not only on the management but also on the corporation as additional crimes other than the main crime.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Pertanggungjawaban Pidana Korporasi Dalam Perkara Nomor: 1066 K/pid.sus/2017 Atas Tindakan Menambang Di Luar Wilayah Izin Usaha Pertambangan","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Membuka peluang partisipasi masyarakat dalam menentukan perencanaan pembangunan yang akan dilaksanakan oleh pemerintah daerah masing-masing. Penggunaan bottom-up pada sistem perencanaan pembangunan ditandai dengan diadakan musrenbang yang dimulai dari musrenbang desa/kelurahan, kecamatan hingga tingkat SKPD dan nasional. Musrenbang desa sendiri merupakan kegiatan tahunan yang diadakan oleh pemerintah desa berdasar pada Undang-Undang No. 25 Tahun 2004 tentang Sistem Perencanaan Pembangunan Nasional. Musrenbang desa diawali dengan diadakannya musdus atau musyawarah dusun. Partisipasi masyarakat dalam musrenbang merupakan suatu hal yang penting bagi musyawarah untuk menghasilkan usulan-usulan pembangunan dari berbagai kalangan masyarakat. Metode yang digunakan dalam penelitian ini adalah metode penelitian kualitatif dengan pendekatan deskriptif. Fokus penelitian adalah 1. Partisipasi masyarakat dalam musrenbang desa yang meliputi bentuk partisipasi masyarakat dan tipologi partisipasi masyarakat dalam musrenbang desa, 2. Faktor pendukung dan faktor penghambat partisipasi masyarakat dalam musrenbang desa. Lokasi penelitian adalah Desa Lumbangsari Kecamatan Bululawang Kabupaten Malang, sedangkan situs penelitian adalah Kantor Desa Lumbangsari Kecamatan Bululawang Kabupaten Malang. Partisipasi masyarakat di Desa Lumbangsari dilihat dari ketiga tahapan musrenbang yaitu pra-musrenbang desa, pelaksanaan musrenbang desa dan pasca musrenbang desa. serta partisipasi masyarakat pada tiga tahap tersebut dikaji berdasar pada derajat partisipasi masyarakat dan dikerucutkan lagi pada anak tangga pada derajat partisipasi tersebut. Partisipasi masyarakat pada tahap pra musrenbang dan pelaksanaan musrenbang terletak pada derajat tanda partisipasi sedangkan dalam tahap pasca partisipasi terletak pada derajat non partisipasi.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Analisis Musyawarah Perencanaan Pembangunan Desa (Musrenbang Desa) Dengan Pendekatan Partisipasi Masyarakat (Studi Di Desa Lumbangsari Kecamatan Bululawang Kabupaten Malang)","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Moreover, by a mathematical analysis the equilibria of the model have been determined, and by automated checking a number of expected properties of the model have been confirmed.","inCitations":["fc62f59175c92903010e5d0bb2d89547b5adb3f0","55b9a818461936b0e35ab1edc5ed69f47b635249","900957b9dfab6a1c8f0f3aaf44e1413a1609f8e8","4d4b9cd80b87ca6907ca9631ed9809bbe77aa537","00fc8164213944979135d7e7780fe98ca35b1da0","e226a1fefc857204a68af4a317f5bd877ee2215a","55ce47005470d6533abf80f3d2d67ce3f6f1d393","ade2c0295d5f3d2314399256ea0a66be07e334ba","f24b04f70a40d27d200b9f910829d547c9bfc4d8","a219480cbe9fc59196fe9490fa9995de020d3a94","2ef4b6d075924f91b408ceb99e095a580e66a7e9","8a64314c905a3aaf2d159f1be9bc157414b26fbc","78386adfe4808f59e25f0b417e9f6335b8059dbd","36268b2815e623ca84d0c6e2af49ff4575257a74","41c6c6284b5ae2d408b9fd9a60d9a0ff95ed9c7a","e9b3d4a8b9d8b5e887883990c49d4209532d479c","6bf49a04a6cbd277a957a2581b21b3c27a84d59c","c258d4e7c53afafd106ee2834a9d3d92254cccc1","c506b38f75b704b0484ffeebc151058e9bd8c01b","9ea740525212be8946bbf29234c8f8aad0837e5f","636641c0a2a2e7aeec890ae9aad02fea499e2635","a6afc46bf8f1699e3a2e9efe9fd973e1aedd4db4","f3e4241cf62e6101fa3e5dd770c4e60738554939","8cb681bc9ebd856e2c3785d6c6be8754074af44a","37eff62b77548632edc4056a8c5c81614cf49bcb"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.few.vu.nl/~tbosse/papers/IAT08-WP2.pdf","http://wwwis.win.tue.nl/bnaic2009/papers/junk/bnaic2009_submission_15.pdf","http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/WIIAT.2008.266","http://www.few.vu.nl/~wai/Papers/IAT08funcstate.pdf","http://www.researchgate.net/profile/Fiemke_Griffioen-Both2/publication/232654349_An_Agent_Model_for_a_Human/links/54be18250cf218d4a16a4cb5.pdf","http://wwwis.win.tue.nl/bnaic2009/papers/bnaic2009_paper_15.pdf","http://www.cs.vu.nl/~wai/Papers/IAT08funcstate.pdf","http://wwwis.win.tue.nl/~bnaic/2009/papers/bnaic2009_paper_15.pdf"],"title":"An Agent Model for a Human's Functional State and Performance","doi":"10.1109/WIIAT.2008.266","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WIIAT.2008.266","venue":"2008 IEEE/WIC/ACM International Conference on Web Intelligence and Intelligent Agent Technology"}

A dose-related increase in kinetochore-positive micronuclei was obtained when cytochalasin B was given subsequent to colchicine treatment. No induction of micronuclei was observed in combined treatments of the two substances. These results indicate that the detection of kinetochores in micronucleated cytokinesis-blocked human fibroblasts can be effectively applied to the identification of environmental agents with aneuploidy-inducing potential.

Design: Interviews. Latent qualitative content analysis. Setting: Nine nursing homes in Sweden. Subjects: 14 physicians and 11 nurses working at nursing homes. Main outcome measures: Participants' views on advance care planning (ACP) at nursing homes. Results: The analysis of the interviews resulted in four manifest categories: Exploration of preferences and views, e.g. exploring patient wishes regarding end-of-life issues and restrictions in care at an early stage, and sensitivity to patient's readiness to discuss end-of-life issues; Integration of preferences and views, e.g. integration of patient's preferences and staff's and family member's views; Decision & documentation of the ACP, e.g. clear documentation in patient's medical records that are up-to-date and available for staff caring for the patient, and Implementation & re-evaluation of the ACP, e.g. nurse following up after ACP-appointment to confirm the content of the documented ACP. The latent theme, Establishing beneficence - defending oneself against tacit accusations of maleficence, emerged as a deeper meaning of all the four (manifest) parts of the ACP-process Conclusion: This study stresses the importance of involving patients, family members, and the team in the work with advance care planning in nursing homes. In addition, clear medical record documentation and proficiency in end-of-life communication related to advance care planning for physicians as well as nurses may also be factors that significantly shape advance care planning in a nursing home context. Key Points Advance care planning can help patients to receive care in line with their preferences and can positively impact quality of end-of-life care. Our results describe a process consisting of four manifest categories and one latent theme constituting the process of advance care planning, that may be considered in education in advance care planning. The significance of nurses and physicians perceiving beneficence as well as fear of accusations of maleficence are important factors to contemplate. The study has implications for healthcare staff caring for patients near the end of their lives, in particular patients in nursing homes.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://liu.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1332853/FULLTEXT01.pdf"],"title":"‘We have no crystal ball’ - advance care planning at nursing homes from the perspective of nurses and physicians","doi":"10.1080/02813432.2019.1608068","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1080/02813432.2019.1608068","venue":"Scandinavian journal of primary health care"}

In pursuit of these goals, some jurisdictions have begun using structured means of assessing relative risk. This article briefly describes modern risk assessment instruments, the reasons why they might be preferred over traditional means of assessing risk, and three principles—the fit, validity and fairness principles—that should govern their use. It then contends that, when limited by these or similar principles, criminal justice dispositions can justifiably be based on assessments of risk, despite concerns about their reliability, consistency and legitimacy. Inaccuracy and disparity is as prevalent in desert-based sentencing as it is in risk-based sentencing. More importantly, desert-based sentencing is not as consistent with, and risk-based sentencing is not as inimical to, autonomy and dignity values as is commonly thought. The overall goal of these arguments is to defend modern risk-based sentencing against abolitionist proposals that could do more harm than good, both to offenders and to a punishment system that, at least in the United States, is obscenely harsh.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"A Defense of Modern Risk-Based Sentencing","doi":"10.2139/ssrn.3242257","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3242257","venue":""}

According to previous studies by the same authors, IMP-1-producing strains are usually isolated from urine samples. Therefore, in this study, a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was applied for direct screening of the IMP-1 metallo-beta-lactamase gene in urine samples.\n\n\nMETHOD\nUrine samples were collected from 273 inpatients to whom various broad-spectrum beta-lactams, including carbapenems, had been administered in 57 hospitals in 1997. DNA templates for PCR analyses were prepared directly from 19 urine samples from which Serratia marcescens strains demonstrating high-level resistance (minimal inhibitory concentration > 128 microg/mL) to both ceftazidime and cefoperazone-sulbactam were later isolated.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe IMP-1 metallo-beta-lactamase gene (blaIMP)-specific 578 bp fragments were able to be amplified successfully in eight of the 19 samples. In the seven strains isolated from the eight samples, the presence of blaIMP was also detected by a DNA hybridization analysis. The lower limit of the PCR method was determined as 1 x 10(2) CFU of blaIMP-bearing bacterial cells per 1 mL of urine sample. No false positive result was found.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe PCR-aided direct screening of blaIMP is applicable to early recognition of IMP-1-producing bacteria in urine samples. This method would help to prevent nosocomial and interhospital transmission of this kind of hazardous bacteria, as well as the advancement of rigorous infection control.","inCitations":["32d8a7d0d01550737a0651df16cc46cd33786ec7","f1b1edbcc23281dd7bbcd710ae39a447ee3b24a0","8154aba54b18d0f91b046d40a4087c8719cdcdca"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Direct screening of the IMP-1 metallo-beta-lactamase gene (blaIMP) from urine samples by polymerase chain reaction.","doi":"10.1046/j.1442-2042.2001.00262.x","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1442-2042.2001.00262.x","venue":"International journal of urology : official journal of the Japanese Urological Association"}

In this study we investigated by immunohistochemistry and Western blotting whether calcium and the phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate, well characterized differentiation signals, induce p21WAF1 in cultured normal human keratinocytes and whether induction of p21WAF1 in this system depends on protein kinase C activation or functional p53. Phorbol ester induced p21WAF1 expression, which was maximal at 4 to 8 h with reduction back to baseline by 24 to 48 h. In contrast, increasing the extracellular Ca2+ concentration from 70 micromol/L to 1.5 mmol/L resulted in upregulation of p21WAF1 expression with a slower time course, with peak induction at 18 to 24 h. No parallel increase in p53 expression was observed in normal human keratinocytes. Up-regulation of p21WAF1 was also observed in response to phorbol ester in HaCaT cells, which carry homozygous and inactivating mutations for p53. Induction of p21WAF1 by phorbol ester and Ca2+ was inhibited by the specific protein kinase C inhibitor Ro 31-8220. The results demonstrate a differential time course of p21WAF1 protein up-regulation in response to phorbol ester and Ca2+, signals that result in keratinocyte differentiation, and suggest that induction of p21WAF1 in differentiating human keratinocytes occurs through protein kinase C-dependent and p53-independent mechanisms.","inCitations":["071d01cab18227a556be3ac190f380c39067e771","33546b5ea704c9d1c6e60fc172b20cafd975fb77","d2fe27b9ee7a39dc8595586009076f7aec6eb6c0","b4338809fbe8fd0acf3a9fe8814cc0a8a333ea13","6553051e34670d383637ca348c7a1df5501627d5","636eb5c2d40bfda9991af1fb42043d0197b93c2f","42443dac52d4f072531754156affd02a29d9caf6","52ff028c43529c9941eb2105e6f182da2e21a92c","1e3aeb4807252579f4868b94fdf800225e995ac6","86d15669e9019e1d01e7bdb7fb5c8cde3ee98fec","67867d97991e96a5a9ed5fb3547f45df87548b50","3041c80ab0b9a2c1926bc7596c4418f0c7e58e54","9d3ed782352b6a888b556777afad7b64d37da9e5","571afe8fb962f0e87319d4bc418134bab4b672e9","02eebdceed31f5e8e623e7cf56df553841a66f19","4b80f8d897919ad678420e514e4c8ea03c12981f","a6347af7729a0e1ac95a5f5d8eb7e18d04c37de6","0df728ea2c39361c39d2075e5c64aa45e2e90906","6535ce1d159b651327e1fbfa5f16149dc8f4f3ab","61be273e942bda3df1392c4ad312d73b811afb83","e71677de25e6cf4ad47057b38e2493789a211ff3","7d1be7e4b4d36e5ee25caf0790ce84046ad5d5ad","fa5069ee5eff881692a40c3a57a9e8b3b914127a","20339f9e5397ea8a79b0d00c229fc6500309cb64","9693d869198832762bb94522105eb18ebb206aae","a215df48a621d80ace01e417edb499e0f32156e5","2da2715d7d2c934c190e23393aeeca09557fb018","4c9f70916942ac43e938a84729613a9af6f301d5","ea76cbee73134c5586350f4f4710989cec97927f","0c7ba47f19141bde1ee35234c426bfd756a2b408","45ef1d074f84b3b05112db4e8ac6fd3fe2d20fb4"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Up-regulation of p21WAF1 by phorbol ester and calcium in human keratinocytes through a protein kinase C-dependent pathway.","doi":"10.1016/S0002-9440(10)65543-5","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/S0002-9440%2810%2965543-5","venue":"The American journal of pathology"}

Essentially an artificial intelligence based approach for the networking environment, the method is adaptive to the changes in the manufacturing environment and can take into account such information as loading factor, unexpected breakdowns, and new job arrivals. The major features of the method are a distributed task assignment mechanism executed through the communication network for intercell scheduling and a knowledge based system for cell level scheduling. A main advantage of such a method is that the scheduling on both levels can be dynamically executed in real time.","inCitations":["9778a22a87798ab6bbfdc4e78b7846a1e92d233a","621341e57f650138312f3b5ce4bbd4505d2b47cb","1c8fa114a5bc6cd4e750a1cd8ce7cb20b4c074f9","5bf02e1f7c64d77f1aac622808509c9b104986bd","b379f2ec17597d88f680cd4cf8078ea0c0ba17e2","c62e9c3fed98662c0c1923064e77fe455f970f97","686c22c0525ed229c5a5e5c4013cd2295d4a55ac","e794a7fa20c8b646fa82f3da69dcae7ddcda9edf","4ef50b49d6baec3bfecb48f222f4334a58226f2f","19c4b36e4e3b66b0a46565605edefcf97e545f74","0de9301bff625867ff2ddb226ad70764b99c0b29","541f926cdb0a279dab79efeda1db471ecdd6f3ef","d609864662c40713a4b2df091a2bbf7b2b31c20f","ad5cb519c720aec1244f6561b7d97b9ef3883b58","25d745f82d92db4c43c6bdbb337273c0ccd53d45","010e27fab095ae553fc34dbf9bcb1a14e2c4a3d8","3e6e87f49217d2a449043b006ed9c9eedc14af59","38a743f812073b22aca5c5adff8a4e81f66e77f8","5c93199b12a565959c747b0fe6d6697d004b18b8","40f945d75a7641ebc94ea50efaeb781905fb80ad","180daac72e09b887f6917443e44f30fcb1d77c91","32e642ae38378a11a5d1251f67086c986719e191","f4d67e06180365725c92ec3680535d38de7bce8a","0a628e4a816e0bd6def307eb92386c0c003d90e8","a2b3aa1b9a932afb76f4cc63302e3e5befd82b24","12e93597ce3ecdc787fbaaa58b332b61303184ce","bf4b80658da1812e126fdb79086d9ac264aa2366","fd3321fd19fcfbdf8fb8a0b40cd4e213f0bfd441","da0b4784d1e067610851f58fc53b3efb4a31fcc7","119b0bd959a9f6e031526a84b39fa82262377ff1","596b7f8c10b1a058bba14e1050b4e01497b92337","0a245b37c9e131e765742cea1efbeb4e5318afa5","63613aa82d8a9fde28b76c877699f85773d00a45","d4ab490b459ab0cde25cf1d5be1d603922e856a2","527ee2966a430c6fb8b2c183f225d9d2bf40d3b5","138f747bba03926ff6917e0767ac26e7c440032a","627099beb182e7d9a6dbf8da9c55170b102e7d1c","7bd09985bdc70e23665dbcd22612a5cc9aca94dc","4511dd9ed599e53f4109e89922fe6fbb15fad282","adfdb44745afc9a80a975c45dd31711748a113b5","06ab9d306c485507155accf166f33c226854bd75","6f50dd8394443ce452e2beba1ca4baf2800edd31","ae219af7712f56e40cccd36deed359889ef7da4d","23b80b307ba09945b88d6517f27bea669aaf8a1d","5c7f345f304906e99a211c7f47b1d27eff696f02"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Dynamic scheduling in cellular manufacturing systems: A framework for networked decision making","doi":"10.1016/0278-6125(88)90016-7","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/0278-6125%2888%2990016-7","venue":""}

better substitute for incorporating a large number of cores on a single system-on-chip (SoC). The dependency on multi-core systems to accomplish the high-performance constraints of composite embedded applications is on the rise. This leads to the realization of efficient mapping approaches for such complex applications. The significance of efficient application mapping approaches has increased ever since the embedded applications have become more complex and performance-oriented. This paper presents the detailed comparative analysis and categorization of application mapping approaches with current trends in NoC design implementation. These approaches target to improve the performance of the whole system by optimizing communication cost, energy, power consumption, and latency. Apart from the categorization of the discussed approaches, comparison of communication cost, power, energy, and latency of the NoC system carried out on real applications like VOPD and MPEG4. Moreover, the best technique identified in each category based on the evaluation of performance results.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2982675"],"title":"Performance Evaluation of Application Mapping Approaches for Network-on-Chip Designs","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2982675","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2982675","venue":"IEEE Access"}

The aim of this study was to present our experience in the application of tissue expanders in the limbs, and to compare the complications of this procedure in limb and non-limb sites.\n\n\nMATERIAL AND METHODS\nThis retrospective study included 16 expanders in 14 patients. Indications for tissue expansion were post burn scarring and contractures, post mastectomy reconstruction and before excision of giant nevus. The expanders were placed in the following sites: scalp, breast, abdomen, leg and arm.\n\n\nRESULTS\nDespite the fact that there were complications in 3 out of the 16 expanders used, failure occurred in 1 expander, which was removed. The remaining complications were managed either by immediate delivery whenever expansion approached full size or by salvage of the expander by exteriorizing the buried part in cases of infection.","inCitations":["a547403df3309ef54df2a45a3bd6cc563774b275"],"pdfUrls":["http://manu.edu.mk/prilozi/7bd.pdf"],"title":"Tissue expansion in limbs vs other body regions.","doi":"","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"Prilozi"}

The research was conducted through case studies of five Chinese families, questionnaire responses from 150 Chinese and British-Chinese pupils and 200 British-European pupils and interviews with 65 Chinese and British-Chinese pupils and 35 British-European pupils. A companion enquiry provided some additional comparative data from Hong Kong. The overwhelming conclusion from this research is the extent to which British-Chinese pupils remain conditioned by traditional Chinese behavioural rules even though they were largely born and educated in England. The two fundamental rules of 'respect for superiors' and 'loyalty and filial piety' provide a framework within which they create expectations and attitudes with regard to their education. The questionnaire enquired into the learning preferences of pupil...","inCitations":["b17914c1c565d5de0d4b3b402566ab63354c6cc2","df0bc68b56ac0839fa31b6992eb953b76cd8a3bd","297355e456ec55bdb54a7f4c7d52c53f4d2a7c63","659d2c70fc764003d25260c825f9eb74a74c2a56","44856fa894d6fa1802e7b91a503147cf95a6eba9","a8c9b9f7f03c78a9eaf1fef09134bda5698d0cb5","6cab8673bc0efae24258015e0f0aa3b21f048065","af156814f72ce88b588ab0f25d628c60e21ffca8","7be64632ddcb583209f48e7235bcba4f09f86f62","3240548136ce96244a122609f66178f1e1538d7c","37c97d11f238c1e218c2dbe7d98a941504171098","995f3cce735d52c2af97fecf3b22c04b0acb4772","c942a48a6d1d5905ae47149ff9bbe1bffd4f95ce","42d0ab3fde2cbaf2795777a33aa262c5f296454e","1960a81a066c1e9f290d128a440aa7107173b8dd","5dd7fad1ed0dfa04f88585d31cde2fed488ccb16","4011cb47db7c67f1944fcdc525c869984ca7fdf4","3d348f830b9a6f15ee865c0862a7e1d52ab45b68","bd2a4b26defe8542cd9e416e654942b1a4c968da","301f09787862d29cd5addb8472876b2c6b3bab39","892a24a3f55a7ec6ac9a13958f06dfb0b82d193f","43f7ee3c2da1593a8e1ddf5e5fea54630fbe1cb6","fcaa1e32e07854ec1187c081047197b154ebecdb","9f8407d13a8e68316781b6c05cd8b7cd1c7414c2","15f8338e11aaf144deb69492cd184fb0361b955a","31bf29383fa46a6b7b3baf3add57f89bd889d801","6ebcccbfb3e3229e9e6a7cef9ade5d1ec4059157","37b3b93bef31bf0c06b40342d8adb58b298759bd","ac0417b25915ae70aa1ecced12c4b1d076d5aec4","853979d1f3a516c3b00c1289f1725743e7286fc1","088e2564de9b25101b7cf7a97347fa6b00b46756","4157771fae59dd99ece580d5ade51a3aae036d82","cd021b5dd76b62576551397783ac9218864cf00f"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.esri.mmu.ac.uk/respapers/papers-pdf/Paper%20-%20Chinese%20pupils%20&%20learning%20prefs.pdf"],"title":"Chinese Pupils and Their Learning Preferences","doi":"10.1080/13613320120096661","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1080/13613320120096661","venue":""}

Based on previous studies, which have found anda association between peritoneal fluid colour and the kind of treatment required, our hypothesis was that the peritoneal fluid haemoglobin concentration would be higher in horses requiring surgical intervention than in horses amenable to medical treatment. Seventy-four horses admitted to a teaching hospital were included. Thirty-five horses were classified as requiring surgery and 39 medical treatment. Logistic regression revealed a significant (P < 0.0001) association between the haemoglobin concentration measured with the spectrophotometer and the need for surgical treatment. Odds ratio for an increase in haemoglobin concentration of 0.01 mmol/l was 6.4, which means that the odds for 'need for surgical treatment' increased when peritoneal fluid haemoglobin concentration increased. When used as a diagnostic test with a threshold of 0.01 mmol/l haemoglobin for selecting surgical vs. medical treatment, sensitivity was 80% and specificity 82%, whereas simple visual assessment had a sensitivity of only 51% and a specificity of 95%.","inCitations":["b43c8ee0cb20d34ec44d96a5d33bc87cbbad35c5","05128d2e2497139f7f546b4d6e609420c1b45c94","38ae1fe67479e2e3abc277fc3050db4a7d6f6db9","d8815e15095a32f2a956ef5d97ffd59bb9d9ca28"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Spectrophotometric assessment of peritoneal fluid haemoglobin in colic horses: an aid to selecting medical vs. surgical treatment.","doi":"10.2746/042516402776117728","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.2746/042516402776117728","venue":"Equine veterinary journal"}

Because deficient screening remains the most significant risk factor for cervical cancer, it is essential to understand the differences between routine and nonroutine screeners.\n\n\nDESIGN\nA convergent-parallel mixed methods design.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA convenience sample of 21- to 65-year-old lesbian and bisexual women and transgender men were recruited in the USA from August-December 2014. Quantitative data were collected via a 48-item Internet questionnaire (N = 226), and qualitative data were collected through in-depth telephone interviews (N = 20) and open-ended questions on the Internet questionnaire.\n\n\nRESULTS\nSeventy-three per cent of the sample was routine cervical screeners. The results showed that a constellation of factors influence the use of cervical cancer screening among lesbian, bisexual and queer women. Some of those factors overlap with the general female population, whereas others are specific to the lesbian, bisexual or queer identity. Routine screeners reported feeling more welcome in the health care setting, while nonroutine screeners reported more discrimination related to their sexual orientation and gender expression. Routine screeners were also more likely to 'out' to their provider. The quantitative and qualitative factors were also compared and contrasted.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nMany of the factors identified in this study to influence cervical cancer screening relate to the health care environment and to interactions between the patient and provider.\n\n\nRELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE\nNurses should be involved with creating welcoming environments for lesbian, bisexual and queer women and their partners. Moreover, nurses play a large role in patient education and should promote self-care behaviours among lesbian women and transgender men.","inCitations":["90ec5b1d0df3220e22ca8bb718ead91eb0c5c7bd","eae39ef6dc01b4af9a750d1f50e84fd998606b68","87c9ed832d075f1914018f8994ba332fa0f7c6f9","5e8bf36da3133f7c2ce58188d776bf3692602389","3fd6551db709618f8e6a0ac93bd9936f1db82428","0e36ae720e90b07b71c6fde4edb6d488d9baba67","dd5943ab0050ab3f83b544f372233c10352449c2","d7c42cf825d06eac2584a8d9b489451516ec3682","33cbccc3c07668a41861faf75f07fae02309559e","76324a0b0c99909cfa91b7ed6bad02e529850936","724f34e86fc02813e8386251401e022dbac1f649","9fb73cb673b44f9ec20be2b4c5678da13330a294"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Quantitative and mixed analyses to identify factors that affect cervical cancer screening uptake among lesbian and bisexual women and transgender men.","doi":"10.1111/jocn.13414","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1111/jocn.13414","venue":"Journal of clinical nursing"}

Spectroscopic techniques provide a method for rapid and non-destructive data collection and a variety of chemometric approaches have been deployed for their interrogation. In this present study, class-modelling techniques (SIMCA, UNEQ and POTFUN) have been deployed after data compression by principal component analysis for the development of class-models for a set of olive oils and honeys. The number of principal components, the confidence level and spectral pre-treatments (1st and 2nd derivative, standard normal variate) were varied, and a strategy for variable selection was tried. Models were evaluated on a separate validation sample set. The outcomes are reported and criteria for selection of the most appropriate models for any given application are discussed.","inCitations":["e73510fd049adbfaca0cb6da012f3070465cebb6","92943916b832a08c66c956960cea63e6071742a0","9b6092246425f494a159011f07e659e396bbc6aa","45bb055695bd242e03c97de7213d8ecb0f19039d","362fbbad16b10c5d893ed3b45c8113922a8bed95","5bfee12dafb125a1de1390417871c8f51576881b","e522214a7e7cd4f2bc62560727ea91889a9fce34","e6fa68b5179a8b4b1a7536ec6e72af63f62ddd44","5f5b72f15ee06458ff04c2828e7773d2183833cb","ac0b64ec9d25e8ecd90946162e777f56bc98fa88","26edf15fa11d7de00f82697825f916e946c70e56","f7a2d5ee709837d3fedd8cd54cde12109e6d63e0","4c7160c9c148c208561d414b02753dc1a7632b65","c19e541816844ec113731a185d07dd83227d797e","22ca6c1b485719fbff461e659a37dd4f15829fbd","19b25cdb8feb023a51b478756a26c528225e2cff","8346c9fe524e8ef97d082b190cbecffaabd19f83","18b14c65b98cb1432f6171d63fe09c69373aa336","b65a0d2690f74eb98ebb79c44529539e0a4ed3dc","2c0de102c5ae67ee9a2b13f099ac55bcb2ea2dc0"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Application of class-modelling techniques to near infrared data for food authentication purposes","doi":"10.1016/j.foodchem.2010.10.047","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2010.10.047","venue":""}

Therapy with oral OC was always combined with clean intermittent catheterization (CIC).\n\n\nRESULTS\nOral OC treatment caused an increase in bladder capacity from 141 +/- 96 to 197 +/- 99 mL (+ 40%; P < 0.01), a decrease in detrusor pressure at maximal capacity from 45 +/- 32 to 28 +/- 23 cm H2O (-38%; P < 0.01), and an increase in detrusor compliance from 6.5 +/- 5.6 to 16.8 +/- 13.7 mL/cm H2O (+ 158%; P < 0.01). Improvement in urodynamic measures and continence were correlated. After a follow-up of at least 2 years, effective protection of renal function was achieved in 38 of the 41 children (93%) with conservative therapy alone. Adverse effects resulted in discontinuation of oral OC treatment in only 2 cases.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nTreatment with oral OC and CIC is effective and safe in children with MMC and detrusor hyperreflexia and should be initiated early when indicated by urodynamic findings.","inCitations":["e799413c7a4cacbd6a77d0a6a1959b10e3c19ba4","2b7c70193091ee6b106ede6d3a55189ff0bfbabc","42d27552b22bbfd4bc56427fb079d721842517e3","953348751bd35ec9f0b92a9214be31ab3e6dd373","4c2fbe7bedf1bf0e97375e84f91ed4d7e646eefd","37ac58640932b930a4012cdcfa80138eb4d636ee","f0bd65e606888939f00119e572716e8bc4897bf5","c2b7ef7cbb5a5d1551e344583219feb06f6779fe","8f87366486d409ee701020222ed05991bf5bbe2d","d39191c30b6a0bc751a8905b931a87a4b35e9142","e27876333c143c8f0dac1ac35247bd616b6e603d","ee4d54cf6ee1cbf09efff7199b09dc479665657c","dcbe06ffe1a41e8a1dd793a2fe6c1e67b679cb4e","89b3673143b269a6b82104dbb275419245b182ed","84ce4cbdad00508024942d64675401b90cdb95d1","5c92668affcb0625d8f3c1c3333f0ee980e72ca7","d7d922132fc8f8e4afe1bf4ab5a9d6ae0be25dfa","3ffd7a0f2aac816434077546e4016085c639025d"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Urodynamic effects of oral oxybutynin chloride in children with myelomeningocele and detrusor hyperreflexia.","doi":"10.1016/S0090-4295(97)00489-5","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/S0090-4295%2897%2900489-5","venue":"Urology"}

Classic solutions involve monitoring, reputation maintenance and costly incentives, but there are important collective actions based on simple and cheap cues only, for example unplanned protests and revolts, as well as cooperation in other species. This can be explained by an Ising model with the assumption that individuals in uncertain situations tend to conform to the local majority in their network. Among initial defectors, noise such as rumors or opponents' provocations causes some of them to cooperate accidentally. At a critical level of noise, these cooperators trigger a cascade of cooperation. We find an analytic relationship between the phase transition and the asymmetry of the Ising model, which in turn reflects the asymmetry of cooperation and defection. This study thereby shows that in principle, the dilemma of cooperation can be solved by nothing more than a portion of random noise.","inCitations":["650ddbdd62befea1bbddf884e4b4eaa626335bc0"],"pdfUrls":["http://arxiv-export-lb.library.cornell.edu/pdf/1812.05367","https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.05367v10.pdf"],"title":"Spontaneous cooperation for public goods","doi":"10.1080/0022250X.2020.1756285","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1080/0022250X.2020.1756285","venue":""}

Crystal violet staining assay showed that SA clearly reduced the biomass of the biofilm at its sub-MICs. Light microscopic images and scanning electron microscope (SEM) observations suggested that SA inhibited the biofilm adhesion on glass slides and induced apparent collapse of biofilm architecture. In addition, XTT reduction assay and confocal laser scanning microscopic images illustrated that the metabolic activity and the viability of the SA-treated biofilm cells significantly decreased. Cell mobility of the SA-treated S. aureus was also inhibited. These observations suggested that SA inhibited the initial biofilm formation by interfering the metabolic activity, the cell viability, and the cell mobility of S. aureus. However, SA failed to disrupt the one-day-old mature biofilm of S. aureus even at the concentrations higher than MIC, suggesting that SA disturbed the early steps in the biofilm formation of S. aureus. qRT-PCR analyses showed that SA down-regulated the transcription of sarA, while up-regulated the transcription of agrA, which resulted in the prevention of biofilm formation. So, SA could be a potential antibiofilm agent to inhibit biofilm formation of S. aureus.","inCitations":["c405e4f1bb474a70857f5ef53d010dad93ea5c22","34d685a5a29fee2525f08a4cad1155a2912f40a8","e4cd6b0350c8fc9fe2898cc6fb63aaa3399aa5d3"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Antibiofilm activity of shikimic acid against Staphylococcus aureus","doi":"10.1016/j.foodcont.2018.08.020","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.foodcont.2018.08.020","venue":""}

For market exchange to be possible, purchasers and suppliers of goods must be able to assess the quality of a product in relation to other products. Only by recognizing qualities and perceiving quality differences can purchasers make non-random choices, and price differences between goods be justified. \"Quality\" is not a natural given, but the outcome of a social process in which products become seen as possessing certain traits, and occupying a specific position in relation to other products in the product space. While we normally take the quality of goods for granted, quality at a closer look is the outcome of a highly complex process of construction involving producers, consumers, and market intermediaries engaged in judgment, evaluation, categorization, and measurement. The authors in this volume investigate the processes through which the quality of goods is established. They also investigate how product qualities are contested and how they change over time. The empirical cases discussed cover a broad range of markets in which quality is especially difficult to assess. The cases include: halal food, funeral markets, wine, labor, school choice, financial products, antiques, and counterfeit goods. The book contributes to the sociology of markets. At the same time it connects to the larger issue of the constitution of social order through cognitive processes of classification.","inCitations":["fb472ac10b05602ae202b44ad6a149b9d72c6dba"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Realizing dreams, proving thrift: how product demonstrations qualify financial objects and subjects","doi":"10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199677573.003.0002","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1093/acprof%3Aoso%2F9780199677573.003.0002","venue":""}

Understanding the genetics of Kentucky bluegrass is useful in developing improved cultivars and hybrids. However, studying the genetics of Kentucky bluegrass can often be difficult because of the high variation in ploidy level that results from its facultative apomictic reproductive nature. Flow cytometry provides an easy and accurate method for assessing this variation by quantifying DNA content. The purpose of our study was to determine the level of variation in ploidy in Kentucky bluegrass by analyzing its DNA content using flow cytometry. In addition, DNA content was compared with genetic similarity derived from DNA marker data, and was also correlated with chromosome number. Twenty-two cultivars of Kentucky bluegrass were selected for the study by considering the range of variability in morphological traits and genetic distance derived from DNA marker data. We found that the DNA content of Kentucky bluegrass genotypes from the 22 cultivars ranged from 5.39 to 17.69 pg of DNA/2C and that a majority of the genotypes had a DNA content value in the range of 7 to 13 pg. A significant correlation between DNA content and chromosome number was detected. Euploid chromosome numbers (x = 7) with a range from the pentaploid (2n = 5x = 35) to the quindecaploid (2n = 15x = 105) were found along with aneuploid numbers. The results of this research could aid both breeders and researchers in studying the genetics of the species and in improving Kentucky bluegrass cultivars via intra- and interspecific hybridizations.","inCitations":["cd265f5d64331b9d0cf269d5d6b3ab4a42683ec3","020cfe205dd74c622f0d4d4b5839f09c8c65af77","61055aeace1f52335465ee5397f3d90ed82037ec","dfea9db31803b54d06319dd38e000d920d07b951","20f4f47a7431a3f6bd32db501d393b5b7be26ff2","9697e0b481d1eafd872318708e219de2f2b1b418","4a1e47194a3312f0f4d6d61a7b993c4df3da17ec","1a5f23531bdb017dd37c39fa6d3b53fbe677e8a2","5606377c646c98bc083490217b77081a4bbf5383","f41edfb4df0a3371a44381f73aeb59661d64c943","56396a19f43525881732d395619fc2c0a8acf10d","788a0aeb399ef5edf945cd735e593319e18afa24","41092f49d82d9215e88db769646d8894b20dfaba","334b8f1f1760321420f82ad83e579f176f04be56","dca1e4d21ae9a20e7342fa5167bb3e35a58c148c","5ed02b97162e96c3b36e090fca83902789f9686b","aa48600477f1c39470270ff88176f428de2a3eb7","40fbf83d61a3fb3f219ad5502ccd2072ae3b8b12","ae883dfa6aa617bb0e6a0d1966394dc49da36f12","bddea89635480b123d2cb91c2d905ae0eececf26","ba30473c09ef8f0f5970e5541e8c6e95978d1f04"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Determination of the Level of Variation in Polyploidy among Kentucky Bluegrass Cultivars by Means of Flow Cytometry","doi":"10.2135/cropsci2004.2168","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.2135/cropsci2004.2168","venue":""}

It seems as if it will be the one which will include the most new members and is likely to considerably alter the Union as we know it today. The Commission opinions and the rhythm of the enlargement negotiations point to an enlargement which could include as many as ten out of the thirteen official candidates, leaving out Turkey and, most likely, Romania and Bulgaria. Such an enlargement will modify the international environment of the Union. Economic integration, legal harmonisation and political convergence amongst the new member states are likely to extend the area of stability and prosperity that the EU has consolidated. At the same time, the external border of the Union will move eastwards, bringing in new neighbours and new concerns. This will considerably affect the foreign policy of the European Union since it will fundamentally alter the geopolitical context of the wider Europe (Hill 2000). Enlargement is arguably one of the key strategies of European Foreign Policy (EFP). It is the one which has had, and will have, the largest impact in the European regional context. Moreover, it is unlikely that it will decline in importance after the next wave of accessions: some of the candidates will remain outside as prospective members, and additional European countries, particularly in the Western Balkans, see membership as a mid to long-term goal. The international capabilities and interests of the EC/EU have evolved and changed over the years. This has been the result of three main processes.
