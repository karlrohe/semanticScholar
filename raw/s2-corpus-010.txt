Large -grain polycrystalline specimens tested in fourpoint loading always showed some plastic deformation (0.078 to 0.798%) before fracture, but the plastic flow was sharpiy reduced from that of single crystals. An etch was developed revealing dislocations on all crystallographic faces of LiF. Details of plastic deformation in polycrystalline material were investigated. Deformation was inhomogeneous among the grains of an aggregate because of differences in orientation with respect to the applied stress, also within individual grains because of interactions between adjoining grains. Grain boundaries were barriers to slip, but stresses resulting from slip in one grain were transmitted to neighboring grains and often caused local deformation near the boundary. Because of local stresses, local slip systems operated although the resolved shear stresses on them from the applied load were below the critical yield stress. In one case, slip occurred on an (010) plane. Three-grain junctions were areas of high residual stress. Fractures originated at boundaries at or near 3-grain junctions, not as a result of inherent boundary weakness but rather because of high stresses developed at the boundary.more » A quantitative expression for fracture originating in a slip band was applied to one type of fracture.

It is very similar to the apo structures determined previously from two different monoclinic crystal forms. An objective reassessment of available apo and nucleotide-bound C3bot1 structures indicates that, contrary to a previous report, the protein possesses a rigid core formed largely of beta-strands and that the general flexure that accompanies NAD binding is concentrated in two peripheral lobes. Tetragonal crystals disintegrate in the presence of NAD, most likely because of disruption of essential crystal contacts.","inCitations":["1386e6bb239c33e9bf2121997284862a88fb9b9c","ba650ea474e45dbe0e988d54eea97f59fdc8242f","b147ab87614faa866274ea548ea063b68e198ffa","a37886ea9aa0d4b1753b510264f28eda6cd785ec","97930b57435ae7516840632c4c7d7ccb604c841f","ec3dc6761fbc3ae8f483008c6be19fd7950ea7b2","2b934145f02586d0969b7d5ab9ca5a1bfd945fc5"],"pdfUrls":["http://journals.iucr.org/d/issues/2004/08/00/hv5014/hv5014.pdf"],"title":"C3 exoenzyme from Clostridium botulinum: structure of a tetragonal crystal form and a reassessment of NAD-induced flexure.","doi":"10.1107/S0907444904011680","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1107/S0907444904011680","venue":"Acta crystallographica.

The ammonia gas exhibited multiple histological abnormalities in liver which include necrosis and darkening of nuclei (apoptotic cells). The histopathological necrosis and degenerative changes in the liver tissue were accompanied by the alteration in the level of blood enzymatic parameters. The activity of marker enzymes of liver function (SGOT and SGPT) was estimated in the blood serum collected from control and exposed rats. A significant elevation in the activity of these enzymes was recorded in serum of treated rats which indicates their involvement in developing necrotic lesions in the liver. The SGOT activity was noted to be relatively higher in comparison to SGPT.

Universities around the world are simultaneously increasing entrepreneurial training across a broad array of majors. However, the entrepreneurial training is not heavily connected to industry needs. This paper focuses on how industry and universities can cooperate to prepare students for corporate entrepreneurial thinking. The research is based on extensive literature, reports, and in-depth interviews with 28 people from various parts of the RTP (Research Triangle Park), including companies, government agencies, and numerous programs at multiple universities. The major finding from this study is that the strength of entrepreneurial education in the regional innovation system reinforces the companies’ open innovation capacity and their performance. To be successful at launching campus-wide entrepreneurship education to increase understanding of corporate entrepreneurship, Corporate Entrepreneurship Education (CEE) must include (1) entrepreneurial leadership; (2) faculty champions; (3) student-focused policies; (4) engagement with the community; and (5) a decentralized, autonomous structure of entrepreneurship programs.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://res.mdpi.com/d_attachment/JOItmC/JOItmC-05-00062/article_deploy/JOItmC-05-00062.pdf"],"title":"Creating a Corporate Entrepreneurial Ecosystem: The Case of Entrepreneurship Education in the RTP, USA","doi":"10.3390/joitmc5030062","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.3390/joitmc5030062","venue":""}

It is open for us as a society to decide.\"1\"In the law, there has always been a difference, and a big difference, between 'employees' and 'independent contractors.'\"2I. IntroductionWhere legal rights and protections are concerned, the difference between employees and independent contractors in American labor and employment law is monumental. Employees are protected by numerous statutes, from state workers' compensation laws to the Fair Labor Standards Act; independent contractors are not.3 Unfortunately, as a matter of classification, the difference can be elusive. In fact, \"[t]here are innumerable situations . . . where it is difficult to say whether a particular individual is an employee or an independent contractor.\"4 Truckers, construction workers, package deliverers, taxi drivers, freelance artists, engineers, and many other types of workers may exhibit some characteristics associated with employee status, but in other ways resemble independent contractors.5 In such borderline cases, the courts have generally failed to articulate convincingly just what the distinction should be.6 Thus the perennial question of how the law should classify workers \"in the borderland between what is clearly an employer-employee relationship and what is clearly one of independent entrepreneurial dealing\"7 stubbornly remains unsettled despite decades of debate in the courts, legislatures, and journals. …","inCitations":["bb51c7ffbe9894075da94ff0b81c684405a81696"],"pdfUrls":["http://law2.wlu.edu/deptimages/Law%20Review/68-1Jost.pdf","https://scholarlycommons.law.wlu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1487&context=wlulr"],"title":"Independent Contractors, Employees, andEntrepreneurialism Under the NationalLabor Relations Act: A Worker-by-Worker Approach","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Most of the milk, the alveolar milk, is stored in alveoli and small milk ducts and is fixed by capillary forces. Removal of the alveolar fraction requires active expulsion of milk into the cisternal cavities by the milk ejection reflex. Tactile teat stimulation causes release of oxytocin (OT) from the posterior pituitary into circulation. Myoepithelial cells, surrounding the alveoli, contract in response to elevated OT concentrations and the alveolar milk is shifted through the milk duct system into the cistern to be removed by the milking machine. The delay in milk ejection after the start of teat stimulation changes during the course of lactation and depends of the interval from previous milking. Milk ejection is not completed with the occurrence of alveolar milk in the cistern during early milking. The process of shifting milk continues until the end of milk removal, and continuously elevated concentrations of OT throughout the entire milking are essential to maintain milk ejection until the udder is emptied. In cows with very high milk flow rates during early milking, milk ejection may be a limiting factor for milk flow towards the end of milking.","inCitations":["7b9ede34d2c26f0e618882906505c74533c57204","5cd4cceda62fdfc66c399f1f22327a7b1c7513ab","ffccd841e5d60fda9a8e538846eeac20e5d33938","72ce0f71a36d2e52efe726ba5839400ad856d3d0","d9e2f6648a6de62aa1eea8ccaac5276163f88ee9","aa29815a3fa024eda21d0061d39061e0f27442b1","2ee40806c80736a78dc47436d0b8b8d47b835fc1","4e8234e27f8f324c37726370b978181cd84cdda3","b31dc652d6441d57d185213e98f6fc626cd3e70d","e97764fbd6fc4d73be1531fc82dc45fbc0304b0f","dd1b2a4f3ae115b5aed33382b487dd82f0bc3248","b396bbb82dca10f60b504214bc6e3f994b9b0ce5","9a742f511d5c016acd4324e0e2b959ae9a5017e3","151a9aa7cd45962e63482b868d157bec5cd3f676","3c3d5b25c6caaba913e8a97ccef947c3a792e699","95fb9fb9c6781afba80c05c946b11efb86a91112","35fa557eb231e642084df45933611cecdc71f2a0","9a802c6440d2f4961daec243072e23a5d650b69e","8277fe9453e12d5a7598322bf9b42547fdeb3e6f","44dd5a7be7e129934eb37c371f9caadd2150aa30","e26f646432625ef483eaf2cc7e3df716a7d66ae5","0129844ef3a3725263988f925f5a0ec6981c3886","7cb3427929e3469abf1657d2190224d74167701c","cfe4fa31fc6258a391c2673a332859afd7560838","d349d8221c752d6932fdf8fc4148f14b94b4723f","563cf76520eee70e38f575fbff563dd47e12ee11","cdc27c510c49f590551bea00dc2c141c743987be","3a458f4fec7862280fb715b9713dbe504ed073f9","4812a9ac56db68a26ba3210c0c5437bbf8aea394","f148352d03cf85b854a1078ecd855e7542c6458e","89ae0681adf20051a6979f6c3d8022d7c4239c9a","aa5a71c479ef14f0b0f7bd7f8388a724312e00e2"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Milk ejection during machine milking in dairy cows","doi":"10.1016/S0301-6226(01)00204-4","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/S0301-6226%2801%2900204-4","venue":""}

In recent years, due to the rapid development of general-purpose GPU computing, fast parallel computing ability and high bandwidth memory access of GPU, using GPU to accelerate string matching algorithm has attracted more and more attention. On the basis of the previous work, the improved AC pattern matching algorithm which is proposed in this paper, further eliminates the storage requirement of the output table, converts the look-up operations in texture memory to numerical comparison operations. Compared to the previous algorithm which doesn't adopt this improvement,the speed is accelerated by over 80%. Moreover, several variables are introduced to enhance effective data matching rate and optimize thread block size. Compared to an efficient algorithm-PFAC, which uses a special matching mode, the optimized algorithm is more than 9% faster.","inCitations":["a315e7eef114b2043fcb7e6a942163e67efde2b7"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Improved AC pattern matching algorithm based on GPU","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

The 1990s saw an explosion in the emergence of NICs with representatives of these churches engaged in local missions or cross-national missions in many African nations. This chapter differentiates NICs from the African Independent Churches (AICs). It considers how the socio-economic history of post-colonial independent Africa weaved a nexus that defines the movement’s foundations, as well as states the basic observable characteristics. The chapter presents a critique of NICs and examines their contribution to missiology as it has now come to be constructed in the global south. NICs variously interpreted the relationship between spiritual and material poverty, offering interventions that reflected their preferred theologies. While recognizing the socio-political context of postcolonial Africa from which NICs emerged, the chapter posits that NICs still need a deepened theological reflection.

The objective of this study is to examine the expression of the five SSTR subtypes and DR2 in lung carcinoids (LCs). Methods: We conducted a retrospective study of 119 LCs from 106 patients [typical carcinoids (TCs): n = 100, and atypical carcinoids (ACs): n = 19]. The expression of all five SSTR subtypes and DR2 was evaluated immunohistochemically and correlated to clinicopathological data. In a subgroup of cases, receptor expression was further analyzed using semiquantitative RT-PCR. Results: SSTR2A was the SSTR subtype most frequently expressed immunohistochemically (72%), followed by SSTR1 (63%), SSTR5 (40%), and SSTR3 (20%), whereas SSTR4 was negative. DR2 was expressed in 74% and co-expressed with SSTR1 in 56%, with SSTR2A in 59%, with SSTR3 in 19%, and with SSTR5 in 37% of the tumors. Receptor expression was not related to the histological subtype, tumor aggressiveness (disease extent/grading) or functionality; however, DR2 was expressed more frequently in ACs than TCs (95 vs. 70%, p = 0.017). In a subset of patients, RT-PCR findings highly suggested that the expression of SSTR2A, SSTR3, DR2, and to a lesser extent that of SSTR1 and SSTR5 is the outcome of increased gene transcription. Conclusions: The high and variable immunohistochemical expression of the majority of SSTRs along with their co-expression with DR2 in LCs provides a rationale for their possible treatment with agents that target these receptors.","inCitations":["0524413aef8fce2aec7b2dfea7854210439d2557","6a194ce716fd07b633fe62eadf1921aa9f8e310a","8fe52619d77303cb29b768c97bf0cbc36713fa11","72bc92904d853fb222f2427c1020f77785650a08","abf31720433140842a5473eda0dd1c614b96c366","63e474265c054fca589ecf8a909d94da95ab3fb5","04754e6feb0a612b9cc863297abb63b96024da36","8d5fd2172f0041552707e36faff1068c3f40614f","e0bb09e04f61d9c7031218869b5c639c894695a6","7a2176778a1ec7f6decd00b8849951d283c5f7d3","a78954885b1b4924e85bf1ac75e7fb105de78476","c06f3d58899670e569d5443b5d22ba8c3e226ce4","95a92418e5f94bbc058a30a8083668db286afefd","e08cfd6f7a58a05dfcdad2fb22df60ec77fbf1f4","59ead45261ceb446e1edd6e6498047a5fa5db29d","43584237ee9b9d7d2f8215aa3fef2d815595b4be","178e3f8fb302fa8e792f6a878ea7e61d70a1fc6d"],"pdfUrls":["https://www.karger.com/Article/Pdf/381061"],"title":"Expression of Somatostatin Receptors 1-5 and Dopamine Receptor 2 in Lung Carcinoids: Implications for a Therapeutic Role","doi":"10.1159/000381061","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1159/000381061","venue":"Neuroendocrinology"}

The increase in total conductivity with increasing temperature below the low-temperature, order–disorder transition indicates a semiconductor-type behaviour with an activation energy of 0.42 eV. When OPP is increased to air pressure at a fixed temperature, the total conductivity increases with an apparent slope (∂log σ/∂log pO2) of 1/10 to 1/22. The maximum oxygen ion conductivity, as extracted from the oxygen permeation measurements, is around 0.01 S cm−1 under the nitrogen condition, which strongly supports the potential for cathode application. The chemical diffusion coefficient ( D ˜ ) and surface exchange coefficient (κ) are also calculated from the d.c. conductivity relaxation measurement and the values are best fitted by the following two equations: D ˜ ( c m 2 s − 1 ) = 1.88 × 10 − 2 exp − 0.77 eV k T , κ ( cm s − 1 ) = 1.37 × 10 0 exp − 0.86 eV k T","inCitations":["cd2608132c9e2654663d918b02c69aa9fcbe3612","5ce6a0e966dc094633e26d5ed9f6bdf5d4399e97"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Chemical diffusivity and ionic conductivity of GdBaCo2O5+δ","doi":"10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.08.074","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.08.074","venue":""}

We examined the role of endoplasmic reticulum stress in mediating the increased saline-intake and hypertensive effects in response to deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA)-salt. Intracerebroventricular delivery of the endoplasmic reticulum stress-reducing chemical chaperone tauroursodeoxycholic acid did not affect the magnitude of hypertension, but markedly decreased saline-intake in response to DOCA-salt. Increased saline-intake returned after tauroursodeoxycholic acid was terminated. Decreased saline-intake was also observed after intracerebroventricular infusion of 4-phenylbutyrate, another chemical chaperone. Immunoreactivity to CCAAT homologous binding protein, a marker of irremediable endoplasmic reticulum stress, was increased in the subfornical organ and supraoptic nucleus of DOCA-salt mice, but the signal was absent in control and CCAAT homologous binding protein-deficient mice. Electron microscopy revealed abnormalities in endoplasmic reticulum structure (decrease in membrane length, swollen membranes, and decreased ribosome numbers) in the subfornical organ consistent with endoplasmic reticulum stress. Subfornical organ-targeted adenoviral delivery of GRP78, a resident endoplasmic reticulum chaperone, decreased DOCA-salt-induced saline-intake. The increase in saline-intake in response to DOCA-salt was blunted in CCAAT homologous binding protein-deficient mice, but these mice exhibited a normal hypertensive response. We conclude that (1) brain endoplasmic reticulum stress mediates the saline-intake, but not blood pressure response to DOCA-salt, (2) DOCA-salt causes endoplasmic reticulum stress in the subfornical organ, which when attenuated by GRP78 blunts saline-intake, and (3) CCAAT homologous binding protein may play a functional role in DOCA-salt-induced saline-intake. The results suggest a mechanistic distinction between the importance of endoplasmic reticulum stress in mediating effects of DOCA-salt on saline-intake and blood pressure.","inCitations":["3987f81593cc550af3b57a827a7bb9fa9360b6a6","1aba73b0a270fedfb77f196bcd7399df52fb1a7d","2a591a4934b5afa178ba8417eb398474563f07db","d15a0441133f6169487e81f316e0184ebc60010c","65ff090a0f9f0ee561b1dbbd868594124f0db04f","bdebda0d778d4b05a98abfc34d99438252eaa64d","3dbb1b287a25a8588c9c5679f6a345fa70bbba9d","4712aa92ffd4a9e9377a4bb0db719d9a96a91b18","e66c4e1af156a6f046180096b8e46794c2d3b4ff"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.vet.cornell.edu/Labs/Davisson/Publications/docs/FusakazuJBrainEndoplasmic2015.pdf"],"title":"Brain endoplasmic reticulum stress mechanistically distinguishes the saline-intake and hypertensive response to deoxycorticosterone acetate-salt.","doi":"10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.115.05377","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.115.05377","venue":"Hypertension"}

A simple extraction procedure was developed which effectively isolated both acid and alkaline proteases from cod viscera with recovery yields of 52% and 30%, respectively. Further purification and characterization revealed that the crude acid proteases consisted of three types of gastric enzymes designated as acid proteases A, B, and C. Acid protease B was classified as fish pepsin II. Acid proteases A and C possessed properties similar to chymosin and gastricsin, respectively. The partially purified alkaline proteases possessed properties of trypsin-like enzymes and acted on N-benzoyl-L-tyrosine ethyl ester (BTEE), a synthetic substrate for chymotrypsin. -- Utilization of the crude isolated proteases was tested in milk-clotting for cheese making, as well as preparation of protein hydrolysates from under-utilized fish species. Cod pepsin was capable of clotting milk efficiently at low temperatures, which shows its potential use in cold renneting of milk. Capelin protein hydrolysate with a recovery yield of 55.8% was obtained when crude cod gastric proteases were used over a 4 h hydrolysis period at ambient temperatures.","inCitations":["382ef9db15dbb653eb46359bbba494266e4322a8","5c5d666bae5c0fc894a04df2820a1a77b5b831fa","cae2699bd2051f73429e1253cf5b895b76a9877f","10ad7b3b4c762c932a41e3b16d8828af15cd585a"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Recovery of digestive enzymes from Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) and their utilization in food processing","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Sun exposure is a well-known risk factor related to this disease and much is understood regarding the etiology and epidemiology of cutaneous melanomas. In contrast, primary mucosal melanomas represent an extremely rare malignancy and do not have the same risk factors or behavior patterns. They occur in areas that have no sun exposure and solid predisposing risk factors have not been identified, making this disease very difficult to diagnose or screen for. It is usually diagnosed at a later stage and carries a poor prognosis. Identifying the differences between a primary lesion and a metastatic melanoma is often challenging, because of the lack of definitive criteria, both pathologically and clinically. The rich vascular and lymphatic network surrounding these lesions may be responsible for their aggressive behavior and poor prognosis. In addition, the obscure locations where mucosal melanomas occur are an obvious reason why these lesions often go unnoticed until symptoms develop. Recent literature has raised significant questions regarding recommended treatment strategies. Earlier reports advocated radical surgery as the mainstay of therapy; however, local recurrence and survival were unchanged whether radical surgery or local excision was performed, and the most recent data are favoring the conservative approach when appropriate. Unfortunately, a multitude of adjuvant therapies have been tried without any success. Adjuvant radiotherapy plays a role when combined with surgery, particularly in the head and neck region and female genitalia, but this is reserved for nodal and locoregionally advanced disease and has had no effect when used as a prophylactic method. It is difficult to make significant advances in treatment strategies because of the rarity of the disease. As an example, one in 75 persons born in the year 2000 will develop cutaneous melanoma in his lifetime, compared with four cases per ten million people diagnosed with mucosal melanoma per year in the United States. Possible new therapies based on new biologic and immunologic findings may have future promise on being able to impact this disease. Until then, this aggressive tumor continues to have a poor prognosis, and surgical resection continues to be the mainstay of primary therapy.","inCitations":["e100a887f8d26e1a86dfb967ce79ae7648b4b84a","cfd3fe4c69ae39d4c739a15247f7c10d2495f6ec","1412edf6da32eff12e64a63cbd2c22030913ab4f","f5672f91cf2f19ed1c208b6a42fcc072c962cd9f","fe016474a9c2fdceb024ac77f11682620c2a9d9b","abe70955e2b874779f441d22d24395b5eb6676da","429336dcfab93dba1e499693487ca85c692dee08","bbac89c73998e842663b64b7714b7f246f7f108c","cc0d8cc47957cb23d4f95ed6783a5d473e2bece6","1c22a627c993faf917730d8504d85d750663e046","6eed193300dbc4a4f092135d5b18a40e9738a711","5745cf35863127dade83598a851e1226cbbebdb4","91d140b80d353710509c98712ad401a995221cea","2ad032ed731f2d6bf6e598ac9ff772a83176c6b4","eeacf3b965af757c1a942ac3d258940b73517386","53e100d368dfe3b1864f667b9e356cc4021a6cfc","7040d8d078d7152d1a93dd19a126987dc3bf255d","b7b21030e77b68b63eb91c3456def8a3a61e3e60","76d98fb8732b67de3d9d32788f8a57cd1e56dfef","5a71bf5d0dc0fdcc94354fbe12e88a940fab6c6c","606bce0b459ac70eabec62c2fed8fc738ffb0293","a8761a5929a76844a73e75cd189d62b635fed494","27b55848e38619f1ef8f19fa310f52d42490bcdc","813471be07f04f3386030ff2062e0ece986179db","9fef349e7262e181ba491d6e41235d839e7a12f8","4bf5e91108d4b633f3e4a5be45ee6e27030f9864","a8090018c3fb7a7163fe8f88fa078932a49fe7e9","932aa04cb77fb8a91ec117a292a062e4dc41a6ed","b9c39ee673e4d9e07d3de9f137f408cd33755fd8","f08cef147373747c76e7cf1f78e6dd3380499891","3a6279fea7ed30c436e1e0c21ad383cd67889e81","b443be4dc76374cc16a4b2bd0ee72186cb94a04b","9db1515078607417a8f90d380037b1a98d3436ae","275a5f6692cb7d2eb6a4c13c9ea7098746f5ed19","2d81498ea526378ee742cba4ee4a3a546dc51e0e","a808d260e608f7f6b769029770d13a53413c249f","1b66bafbe25886234dc7e4f97e3c618431c75839","a406bce4de86c1d49654ade7cbe104ccc491d1d5","8a0344cf49bc9d26c67449525d8108f6c59bca55","f285aa6f79617b0b7c48f223dd88c6d754f0784a","0083b4dfcaa95b6858e7febed1123eb110bfc50b","93ec460dc30fe65c88ac16430c1b3200b28e033b","c0922fd39b960556ba830d296aec226dfdf1b537","436a8a980990cdcf9877eaa976151aa8cddee373","e97c0ad0ad3efe473c62c74db10cd89d6afbffb1","aaea1b4891b0767c63ba0ff277449519da732cef"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Mucosal melanomas.","doi":"10.1016/s0039-6109(02)00100-7","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/s0039-6109%2802%2900100-7","venue":"The Surgical clinics of North America"}

However, the aperture illuminations with maximum \\eta (nearly 100 per cent) are different from the uniform, constant phase illumination which is optimum in the far-field case. The optimum near-field illuminations not only have the phase variation associated with elliptic rather than parabolic reflectors but they also have some amplitude variations. Some simple illuminations which can be realized practically by lenses and dishes are shown to be sufficiently close to the optimum cases for most practical purposes. A formula for the power density in the near field of a transmitting aperture is also derived and it is shown how to maximize the power flow through any given area of space by design of the transmitting aperture illumination.","inCitations":["5dd521e5067b4b1bf2f51684e89533fc19bbd833","ab3a24f3306004da32a5ea99d69b79644159d74e","6071904e6d78420b81b1a93de7ea66dea069962e","43e52938d8536935912819411beb9b60fb8ed271","2e5ec39e78fabd9600d1ef59a3ece19ca149cc9e","a1566051a84183444082b0434af633e415cc0f49","8f5aca8663c5578f53cd02c27b639bb518f5a4b4","ab812195d9a64206a59d193dda41e69d426972f7","02d1086d52cce228262ebc4c6d116182379d068b","25214e97909bd2da80d1b912b37092429fb68636","ae6732cf37c022aa804c01031c5e9ee555126bb2"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Near-field gain of aperture antennas","doi":"10.1109/TAP.1960.1144905","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.1960.1144905","venue":""}

Using the L-CARE in clinical teaching involves: (1) addressing the learners' feelings regarding their environment as well as patient care and study issues, which provides a good learning climate facilitating educational diagnosis and management of issues that could impair learning; (2) establishing a learning contract (expectations); (3) sharing resources and strategies (ideas) that should be effective without wasting time or energy; (4) self-assessment and constructive feedback (impact). These steps are grounded in self-directed learning theory to improve motivation and ensure that learners concentrate on their own needs to promote learning efficiency.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe L-CARE model integrates educational diagnosis principles, self-directed learning theory, and efficient teaching strategies to improve efficiency of clinical teaching.","inCitations":["785a1e8b3f82df5f5c2905fa14047b74a1f6c31a","e9d0702e87d8f6647f8b96a7dd061d72ce0ea257","5a0c6c6c48aa3e0161ec05653e28b6f25690c24d"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Integrating teaching into the busy resident schedule: a learner-centered approach to raise efficiency (L-CARE) in clinical teaching.","doi":"10.3109/01421590902842409","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.3109/01421590902842409","venue":"Medical teacher"}

Overexpression of SR-BI attenuated experimental atherosclerosis in murine models, concomitant with a reduction in plasma HDL-cholesterol levels. Probucol is known to be a potent hypolipidemic drug to regress xanthoma formation and carotid atherosclerosis in conjunction with a marked reduction in HDL-cholesterol levels. However, the mechanism by which probucol affects atherosclerosis is not completely understood, and the effect of probucol on the expression of SR-BI was controversial. The aim of this study was to know the effect of probucol on HDL metabolism and SR-BI expression in the liver.\n\n\nMETHODS\nSixteen rabbits fed with high cholesterol diet for 8 weeks were randomly divided into two groups: (1) high cholesterol group (n = 8): maintained high cholesterol diet for 6 weeks; (2) probucol group (n = 8): the same cholesterol diet plus 1% probucol for 6 weeks. Control group (n = 8) was fed with normal diet for 14 weeks. The classical in situ two steps perfusion of the liver with collagenase IV was used to isolate the parenchymal hepatocytes. The selective uptake of HDL by hepatocytes was performed using the double radiolabelled HDL. Immunohistochemistry and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were used to evaluate SR-BI expression in the liver.\n\n\nRESULTS\nCompared with control group, rabbits fed with high cholesterol diet showed higher levels of serum total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and HDL-C, all of which were significantly reduced by probucol treatment. The selective uptake of HDL CEs in probucol group (249.68 +/- 60.13 ng/mg cell protein) was about two folds higher as compared with the control group (122.47 +/- 54.06 ng/mg cell protein, P < 0.01) and high cholesterol group (104.92 +/- 47.91 ng/mg cell protein, P < 0.01), but it could not be reproduced in vitro. The expression of SR-BI were significantly decreased in the high cholesterol group (0.48 +/- 0.06) as compared with control group (0.65 +/- 0.06, P < 0.01). Probucol increased SR-BI expression (0.68 +/- 0.06, P < 0.01) as compared with high cholesterol group. The expression of SR-BI was positively associated with the selective CEs uptake (r = 0.47, P = 0.032).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nProbucol up-regulates SR-BI expression and enhance the uptake of HDL CEs by hepatocytes, which may help us to understand the anti-atherogenic properties and the HDL-C-lowering effect of probucol.","inCitations":["169cbd65db8cc6c4ebf29e2d7009d5ea99a115dc","dae9d8ad7188a671b7732dba07f5961e3dd3cda9","da8381870eae8af5ccd94eaf9e0091f9cb4376b3","822f07d325fab6db7e50163f7d80ebc597f3596a","15181b6c0ced3b41be777f8acdbd74b942e888f6","10a358384e353fb1b240c757a1c2018b3bc75f0b","8bd2d2a944b162f2579fdabb8269a11671936bb4"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Effect of probucol on HDL metabolism and class B type I scavenger receptor (SR-BI) expression in the liver of hypercholesterolemic rabbits.","doi":"10.1016/j.ijcard.2005.12.026","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijcard.2005.12.026","venue":"International journal of cardiology"}

Questionnaires were administered to 200 FSWs aged 18–26 years in Lima, Peru, to gather risk behaviours, and cervical swab samples were collected for Pap smears and HPV DNA testing as part of a longitudinal study. Participants reported a median of 120 clients in the past month, and 99.2% reported using condoms with clients. The prevalence of any HPV in cervical samples was 66.8%; 34 (17.1%) participants had prevalent HPV 16 or 18, and 92 (46.2%) had one or more oncogenic types. Fifteen women had abnormal Pap smears, 13 of which were HPV DNA positive. Fewer years since first sex was associated with oncogenic HPV prevalence in a model adjusted for previous sexually transmitted infection (STI) status and condom use with partners (prevalence ratio = 0.77, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.60–0.97). Our data confirm the high rates of HPV transmission among FSWs in Peru, highlighting the need for early and effective strategies to prevent cervical cancer.","inCitations":["2e83eff09c0cd309a83c5a84ea9526a76b311bb0","b76c97605f7513ed2d82aab595cde96c45923c84","97395ae85d45419a4bfacca9be4ae2e8a58bcc74","b443739fe72964f297e9248e5d925c837f721c4d","9b4af8d5ba798c5133300b1ea51a6812682f3856","2bd3c2778e30aaa14dcb69564c93d67411117516","2cc20f02012fc3b41b10d99cd95f0b95687c57c8","e7882973079d471e490c88b53dea05be18390b58","b4f297ed442868757341030f080e31a8080f0342","c581f52c8d5708cf6e0e39cc044687c855226912"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Human papillomavirus prevalence, cervical abnormalities and risk factors among female sex workers in Lima, Peru","doi":"10.1258/ijsa.2011.011193","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1258/ijsa.2011.011193","venue":"International journal of STD & AIDS"}

When building a mathematical model of the shell, three-dimensional equations of the theory of elasticity are applied. Displacements are represented in the form of polynomials along the coordinate normal to the middle surface two degrees higher relative to the classical theory of the Kirchhoff-Love type. As a result of minimization of the refined value of the Lagrange energy functional, a system of differential equilibrium equations in displacements and natural boundary conditions are obtained. The task of reducing two-dimensional equations to ordinary differential equations is carried out by decomposing the components of displacements and external loads into trigonometric series in the circumferential coordinate. Displacements are represented in form of polynomials along the coordinate normal to the middle surface by two degrees higher relative to the classical theory of the Kirchhoff-Love type. Resulting from minimization of the refined value of the Lagrange energy functional, a system of differential equilibrium equations in displacements and natural boundary conditions are received. The task of reducing two-dimensional equations to ordinary differential equations is carried out by decomposing the components of the displacements and the external loads into trigonometric series as per the circumferential coordinate. \nThe formulated boundary problem is solved by the methods of finite differences and matrix sweep. As a result, displacements are obtained in the grid nodes, for approximation of which splines are used. The shell deformations are found using geometric relationship; tangential stresses are received from the correlations of Hooke's law. One of the features of this paper lies in the fact that the transverse stresses are determined by the direct integration of the equilibrium equations of the three-dimensional theory of elasticity. \nAn example of the calculation of a hemispherical shell rigidly restrained along the lower base contour is brought. The shell is exposed to the wind load. Comparison of the results received by the refined theory with the data of the classical theory has shown that in the zone of distortion of the stressed state, the normal tangential stresses are substantially revised and the transverse normal stresses, which are neglected in the classical theory, are of the same magnitude with the maximum values of the main bending stress. \nConsidered is the influence of the relative thickness on the stress state of the shell. It was discovered that the shell thickness significantly increases the error of the classical theory, while determining the stresses and assessing the strength of the elements of the aircraft structures.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Напряженно-деформированное Состояние Сферической Оболочки Под Действием Произвольной Нагрузки На Основе Неклассической Теории","doi":"10.32326/1814-9146-2019-81-3-359-368","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.32326/1814-9146-2019-81-3-359-368","venue":""}

Although there have been examples of very creative use of electronic government in the public sector, there have also been numerous spectacular failures. This paper highlights a number of problematic issues surrounding its use. These include the fact that government's two central aims, namely high quality customer service and value‐for‐money, could potentially be in conflict; and the lack of evidence to support the claim that the use of technology in service delivery results in less bureaucracy and increased quality. Clearly these tensions and issues need to be much more fully explored so that a “government for people” can be created. The paper concludes by posing the question: Can e‐government produce truly innovative, responsive public services, or merely exacerbate electronically, existing shortcomings?","inCitations":["cd0b4dda85418fab714b1a778487ea5a75c64cc6","cae590ecc9f8bb11a9069bba1ac9d27b5c03808a","331105950354c0d1f16d50243c882199e2b5913d","5654bf8f86ba7f9b1d8ded015c91f151c26f5f33","142fe9e8b62fa223b4760d75b922ebbee1c7dedf","c6dc0f2503a68d2b7bcef479cca73de62dce84b4","9bbaaea0fff9b85ac517381c8f451f6ba92b93a2","7c5370bc94e1801e556c7b08eea4006020f8dd01","955422cc742f0f9f479eaa4fa824a718309dcd67","b1c2bac5277cf35bb11cd8d3dc4b912e21135446","3a9d932377e0c451134df0100ccfc6d765111f3a","5c918a638bd509e565d4622deb2fbe9ced2003d3","cf7807ceb1edec451cf074c89e7b017d231be100","4cf94b0939cad9375b423341bdb2e44fd9a7f659","a68f253f47263a930092f4a2b937dbd843191d18","60bf522501c9a57d0a8bc19dafd4888a18b8478e","cc6c0a5dfec9a58eaa2cd1384029ccbf7e0bf6f9","82e7ebea78dc273afbaaaede91a6669de61b7d57","4644d5dade84e08073b02bc8c079c50b2342b442","3bdb098b3efc7725c95d5a0b1f8f836c435d2432","43782e190c731fae256e04fcb8b544c9b005964e","d69b31ec9802aca54ced3ad0afb8418f421f1302","aabfe383f070744f6f3e60ab56a07293599657f9","5c0ea6aa49f5f593d1378ae74c127beafd1b3252","7d127fb7d43eee57cf3e599b488a34de67174ee2","f391051a2aa19abd2071c9fa6c817d52e55dc486","b300cb46c2cac56ed76265d009100ea7ea2259c0","303ee143dd0912a9e84656700ebd3c647a350c98","2eed99b698ba012198448ff3d41469d8f58e53f3","a0bc590cd1eab5b900657a62d0c88c281a13bf53","889da1ed42ca2fa682f8b825ef394725344f5ef2","5d0b464cfa2376746df593d9411db52375430933","e2defcc29c04daa9a94e4a80ea47e700f7b3c15e","0514d2ff12c5038c7a7cf645b8bafe2c5d8535b0","1bdfbf7464ff2ff43855edf7e12823608ffbf865","ccb87e30d53678f512b78dc0c4e8d8dc990c4bc8","4382060c59e39bdfab743780354b44ef7652da5a","1adaef9abcd954dd29bff7f9ec4c0500b90aa59f","e31a95367cb0c0167053e740cb47b381360839ad","14d3128857e601db10a263a7a5e82f369ff0d99d","d41cc7da63884422a0a0fcb33bbccdaeb42793ac","26b784b77bab778724a406f400c2209fa748649a","a175e9c355d2b0c6e2c379f803faa49cec51b583","a615c94604d8ba2984fc491d532bf8cc5666c527","bd32f22b9ffe3fd35b110719d6dd10f0e7271a5c","b584c82bbc1baebd435a36ac1aa25001930344fa","852c950f6c9d9c9f30c2d138d89661fe3b98a4aa","a9dc37dd9cc71c2d53f7307e1c4f10cc17a92506","d059a9a996dcfe5fd656a146d0b3365b9a6503a0","7a0ee359943855c6e4d0ea1cf8284429d5f18ce1","f74e4b6da9a6291d85cc1c8c72111e9008a681b7","1629955f65af5d51d1492d9dbb160ed277c74780","75600950d44a73df131dafb1f2e492e2e78312e8","d423b771c047ec11ec0baf4cedbacf79fd393dd2","0ca966adda4286441239515bf30f3e065720ce4e","0b8d58a7dabfb81b55f1ecd2f2e15f13bbe173c6","a0929bcf8136572cf6d963010f7560e60e180906","4f123a575cc24afd0d4e0f6d87fbade1da9b33b0","b0dd4350b00f1521433e33f4e24608126f84bd84","34b64bffdfa8d71fcb7e44d66de0cdc454e13400","0744a48fae29d41df704e3c37c81f987685e1ca4","52b2380ffe1c2280452e5ebc7d575065ddb2203c","de586b458f18c1ad733dddf6b899f19617008fb6","087473db27f917e3c32493836c577c37025b304f","b042d4523004b40a0c71bae797a0fb50bc93285b","b650d86fddab72fe666ae77d3b9d001f72a11391","8ae300b0ccf4acfe5fa7984ee72217af71ec01f6","92f137c2cef69ff2283ab50beb1370a3fc0240f4","b6ac450f7d57659922ba52cefc967cc2c117903f","1a8004d7c473010d418cc867711acd90fa0f2bc6","b4d0e18d994d60020113884aca33c01b63c70640","20239e4433dcfa3f291b0825b96638410f1a32b0","74a89cc970be96a73c69fa1cabdfb533f0f6a220","fa85658a9b0470e66ec1728e620b86c6d0b6ff36","1c54010b7981e3738abc7d14c0cfdb5d19e91bed","c1c151cfb3fda24611f40b4291028beede75fef6","b434d8199212c53bc219b597a46765a74154b900","dd08fb230a08507212afe4684999caa1994e6eed","b9f41eff2fb5ec146df29cc2150e85767cbf73a4","6c7e1fbb0f2c99f71f8101ea1b94cc8889c995aa","bc9cc4306b636922c6af17d24ecd863d6a7e377c","5b05a6a1a34266be4b35068fac4cd15a1e466323","f4b2bd00bcb435197b773ac2b046cf9cf8128ea9","2b9908e6c9491610680567238b0824e5d96ab873","2b9919fe6d9fc66764d409b6d5a716823da4eb27","3f3881341bc1bfea8306887925aaed23922e4469","3c721b8d408de045e0640500ec264c26afd7fa04","38403f66f0608cd8be9ea347e68b4b2e0f40acdb","9af3317d872d0881c01595ade74296b896a52910","c04f9ae448399f4093b14119f6cf3af126f22eeb","1368f5814822bf2a57a1bdb7620bfc727688bdd3","e07d3b1859bb3b418e9c69d78be1e4d0c94c63f9","7339c77785090285694399cf25b9f2f4f42679a2","767f7ef7dde8f07b9d1a78d5a54f8eb7dac3d4dc","7dbcd48677f96876dfe0c7542265543a6019866b","bbd596507172f0d8a19662747c38871c8ddf206c","784be6ebc038b83b79f6f7220819a4427b71a264","884ccf138acb291457996496ae7c51d6c1af4a08","7c324add0d7c18188f4fe554df339757c4b53acc","61184edc6e2e14aef5faab7b41bbf7de7b9c9ec3","6cdef1ad5278b54fbdda951e559b04df012b965a","3565a48bd454a90d05aa56a57dddbfb64bfc71bd","7ad27b5780771317f346ea69088a24744fb15b63","6e40a4c376e8db65dad0857073da866a58696e84","0711711f88f5fe957f29633eb2758173edb2fd8b","b5bc6f570a543868ee1f60760822b31d67e63237"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"e-Government: The realities of using IT to transform the public sector","doi":"10.1108/09604520310506504","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1108/09604520310506504","venue":""}
