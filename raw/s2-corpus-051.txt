These blooms are often accompanied by extreme extensive negative impacts to fisheries, coastal resources, public health and local economies. However, limited studies have reported HAB events in Red Sea coastal waters. This article reviews potentially harmful microalgae in the Red Sea, based on available published information during the last 3 decades. Five harmful algal blooms were recorded in the Red Sea; of which 3 blooms are formed by dinoflagellates (Noctiluca scintillans, Pyrodinuium bahamense, Protoperidinium quinquecorne), one by raphidophytes (Heterosigma akashiwo) and one by cyanobacteria (Trichodesmium erythraeum). Additionally, mangrove swamps in the Red Sea were occupied by cyanobacterial mats, which contain microcystin and saxitoxin-producing species. The existing data in this review could be a catalyst for the establishment of monitoring and management program for HABs and their toxins in Red Sea coastal waters. This review also identifies current research gaps and suggests future research directions.","inCitations":["8fe1e433e983bab229e6bb373ba9301553b8ee0c","7e1f0f532183381f66c870cb004de598a13fd1d0"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Potentially harmful microalgae and algal blooms in the Red Sea: Current knowledge and research needs.","doi":"10.1016/j.marenvres.2018.06.019","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.marenvres.2018.06.019","venue":"Marine environmental research"}

In the earthworm, Lumbricus terrestris, a brain factor influences 'the salt and osmotic concentration of the blood and coelomic fluid. Removal of the brain results in the increase of water influx with a decrease in the salt and osmotic concentrations of the body fluids. The decreases in salt and osmotic concentrations can be prevented by the implantation of the brain or the injection of brain homogenates.\n\nIn the freshwater crayfish, Procambarus clarkii , a factor, presumably secreted in the brain and released in the eyestalk, seems to maintain the normal permeability of the body surfaces to water. Eyestalk removal, which eliminates the release site, results in the increased influx of water with a decrease in the salt concentration of the blood. A brain factor also seems to be involved in maintaining the sodium and osmotic concentrations of the blood.\n\nIn the semi-terrestrial grapsid crab, Metopograpsus messor , the thoracic ganglion, under the control of an eyestalk element, secretes a factor involved in increasing the permeability of the body surfaces to water. The removal of the eyestalks, the implantation of the thoracic ganglion, or the injection of extracts of thoracic ganglia, results in changes in the osmotic concentration of the blood tending toward that of the medium. In all three species studied, the neuroendocrine factors seem to be involved primarily in the regulation of the permeability of the body surfaces to water.","inCitations":["3cef0e559a4f783c86eecc935dd010eb9af11780","3875c21ed4b3b92a106d971abe0f7a741b7a754c","fb93a919124782ab402f1144a89fc65e22efd445","8f2171aeb1fa4b382dba6e60d40be7967cc38715","fcdcede49815cf8bb1c02cbbd8ad87158b2fd1ec","1d22bfc089ae28050fb9a6b5bff0e53485380f24","d105e4d421cd875366033e5279046aa218fc7c82","dc7f0aaab11e0605d7310aa51ff06303f47cdcf4","57aa7868eed87bbd65088858b823d8cced6bf339","7c3faf713c7c4467745378a3a91b7d9f9e76bc59","764c4031d862b779ea23ea5f4d5c2a069a4bd684","de92225ff3a3de3170ecda72a9ff08a5b3d0f25b"],"pdfUrls":["https://oup.silverchair-cdn.com/oup/backfile/Content_public/Journal/az/6/2/10.1093/icb/6.2.213/2/6-2-213.pdf?Expires=1492981852&Key-Pair-Id=APKAIUCZBIA4LVPAVW3Q&Signature=OB8xlquF-kQi9V0cgfBqWa6guNcUiHPDqd09cBKKQ1AF-X-YptXzZA3wZn120yzSKUA2IpLzmfpplYHumFEKRS6vYMn0lkdggBq8TdN42QF8VlBDouY-MbQxQSMHTlSRXYsAxg1tcRRw-0QDxaLOGStsUl9jJd2vtO4qJXiazhcE3jZw5ILvNVdRhg0Y13sCypj8MgpXr~lm3f1-VSWVKFHG2baawXIVD5bLJ3uGBG17Fzn57j5BfsJxNgvBRmfTC5238sWYffsi5J3gYv8TLCDrkxfNwmPdQ7FmDNdX49QA8h~q9UnExiNAfG4ab1kG9F479cPw5lIhqrDvVYJ~Pg__"],"title":"Neurosecretion and salt and water balance in the Annelida and Crustacea.","doi":"10.1093/icb/6.2.213","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1093/icb%2F6.2.213","venue":"American zoologist"}

The plate supplies a uniform horizontal heat flux to a fluid, the bulk of which has a stable stratification, characterized by a non-uniform vertical temperature gradient. This gradient is assumed to have a typical length scale of variation, denoted Z 0 , while Ψ 0 is the order of magnitude of the related heat flux that crosses the medium vertically. We derive an analytic solution to the Boussinesq equations that extends the classical solution of Prandtl to the case of nonlinearly stratified media. This novel solution is asymptotically valid in the regime Ra s » 1, where Ra s denotes the Rayleigh number of nonlinear stratification, based on Z 0 , Ψ 0 , and the physical properties of the medium. We then apply the new theory to the natural convection affecting the vapour phase in a liquefied pure gas tank (e.g. the cryogenic storage of hydrogen). It is assumed that the cylindrical storage tank is subject to a constant uniform heat flux on its lateral and top walls. We are interested in the vapour motion above a residual layer of liquid in equilibrium with the vapour. High-precision axisymmetric numerical computations show that the flow remains steady for a large range of parameters, and that a bulk stratification characterized by a quadratic temperature profile is undoubtedly present. The application of the theory permits a comparison of the numerical and analytic results, showing that the theory satisfactorily predicts the primary dynamical and thermal properties of the storage tank.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Natural convection along a heated vertical plate immersed in a nonlinearly stratified medium: application to liquefied gas storage","doi":"10.1017/S0022112007007458","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1017/S0022112007007458","venue":""}

Cuprous oxide was used as the precursor for copper, HCl and HBr as halide sources, and the matrix sol was synthesized from 3-glycidoxypropyl(trimethoxy)silane (GPTS) and tetraethoxysilane (TEOS). The films were characterized using ultraviolet–visible (UV-VIS) spectroscopy, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) and X-ray diffraction analysis. Thin films (thickness 0.7–1.0 mm) containing cubic CuClxBr12x (x ~ 1–0) nanoparticles were obtained. For the samples having no bromide, the absorption spectrum showed a sharp absorption edge at 371 nm. Addition of HBr shifted the peak towards a higher wavelength, giving a peak that is characteristic of CuClxBr12x; the addition of 1.85 6 10 22 mole of HBr leads to the complete substitution of chloride by bromide ions. The same observations were also made using X-ray diffraction.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://publikationen.sulb.uni-saarland.de/bitstream/20.500.11880/24762/1/sm200207.pdf"],"title":"Semiconducting CuClxBr12x (x ~ 0–1) nanocrystals in thin films: synthesis and characterization","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Very limited research has assessed the efficacy of evidence-based interventions for MDD in college students. Mindfulness-Based Therapy (MBT) and Behavioral Activation (BA) are two interventions with significant potential to meet demands of college counseling clinics and effectively treat college students with MDD. This study utilized a randomized controlled research design (n = 50) to examine the efficacy of four-sessions of abbreviated MBT and BA relative to a wait-list control condition with depressed college students. Intent-to-treat data analyses on depression outcome measures suggested both treatments were superior to the control group. There were significant pre-post treatment improvements across measures of depression, rumination, stress, and mindfulness, gains largely maintained at 1-month follow-up. Neither active treatment effectively reduced somatic anxiety. Both treatments generally had moderate-strong effect sizes relative to the control group, and based on depression response and remission criteria, 56-79% of patients exhibited clinically significant improvement. Based on reliable change indices, 75-85% experienced clinically significant reductions in depression.

Even though the basic principles of UWB have been studied for decades, there is still a great demand for research, especially in the field of precise local positioning. Techniques have to be further developed to cope with for example varying line of sight (LOS)/non line of sight (NLOS) or severe multipath conditions. In this paper we give an experimental measurement and modeling of ultra wideband radio propagation in underground mines for indoor geolocation.

Evidence indicates that cerebellar shrinkage causes impairment in simple forms of EBCC, whereas changes in forebrain structures result in impairment in more complex tasks. In this study, the ability of abstinent alcoholics and matched control participants to acquire learned responses during delay discrimination and discrimination reversal was examined and related to severity of drinking history and neuropsychological performance. During discrimination learning, one tone (CS+) predicted the occurrence of an airpuff (unconditioned stimulus), and another tone (CS-) served as a neutral stimulus; then the significance of the tones was reversed. Alcoholics who learned the initial discrimination were impaired in acquiring the new CS+ after the tones reversed; this is a function that has previously been linked to forebrain structures. It is suggested that a factor important to alcoholic addiction may be the presence of alcoholic-related associative responses that interfere with the ability to learn new more adaptive associations.","inCitations":["3db6c55b619c23177169b02368f5de7c5709874a","64bd09908cdbd6a13a079126127f3aa156fb5f26","9b013f48c51994a1df86e490e86513393d0739af","ed149a9ec8e5f1016aa3dd8ebecb0efb9aa3cf4d","733578844d52afb3d12a19634c9b0cd3f6d1b41a","8e914c5980a7a89d4554ff7fd0eb5d4e80227c39","f5136b199d205d1a7b6db2244d53a53a85996c24","d04ff26c2ebffce42246ae0a98b312a1eb2050b5","7ebae726abeb53efa23b7384da32481c5d8e2750","c055cadbbb1885d7b4d5a40b65bbd69b7a69afd6","0a23e4768df36dba784c1ef0ed16a63c62a102be","da5b88134a318c9b02d1f481a90e60ca7cbf9401","e61d26fdc8fc20e46e15bab8d56523466a97378c","dfec80f20e1748080426dc826c5377462e6c0805","6bf2c98c52ad34b0e4ef4b3eb4d2daf13efb4a62","9bdb2a58f3185e65d1942fc2d4ae0e4de8b3f9f5","d61c4babd21a56dce8bfee5001a2eb26993b8bd5","648e2d319992bb06dc2c8bda4c610332824ae4a7","2abdbb1f676810ed10e98470e3894ef987c609cc","c9aa6ea5cce29c6f18ac4a1193d88116154aed09","c439d87348099d36abb8321510b3a6d3243f5795","065f5b1e9a27bc39cd89f3bb0d88973b11173d61","96c0f590909958c76076217d40ae05708f194f97","ff117afa7f0bb0e873164fc36db6fe51a3c291e8","33665a65592b4979da58a79ab2005986b16dd6a9","ce3f772ea701095c43c6f65e75336e9fbab3b16f","9e5c56f0be4beafb0070ccc0f6e7ecb064ccf918","41b2adcbf35022c6d2ae2acef300685aeac3671f","edfb1e79fe58088a4738a283ada27553db54879b","4fa432e641f55f0063c6a3b61c36556ba8db1cef"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Delay discrimination and reversal eyeblink classical conditioning in abstinent chronic alcoholics.","doi":"10.1037/0894-4105.22.2.196","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1037/0894-4105.22.2.196","venue":"Neuropsychology"}

The B2-B19 martensitic transformation temperatures of the as-spun ribbon were 100 K higher than those of the bulk-material with the same chemical composition. The martensitic transformation temperatures of the as-spun ribbon were decreased with increasing the temperature of the heat-treatment made after the melt-spinning. As-spun ribbon and the heat-treated ribbons exhibited shape recovery by heating and/or pseudoelasticity. The martensitic transformation temperatures determined from the temperature dependence of the 0.2% flow stress of the pseudoelastic deformation were in good agreement with those of B2-B19 martensitic transformation determined by DSC. It was confirmed that the observed shape recovery and pseudoelasticity are shape memory effect and superelasticity, respectively, due to the B2-B19 martensitic transformation.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Ti-Ni-Pt急冷凝固リボン材のマルテンサイト変態挙動と形状記憶特性","doi":"10.2320/jinstmet.69.628","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.2320/jinstmet.69.628","venue":""}

Chronic pain patients often suffer from a variety of comorbidities, such as depression and anxiety and they are therefore often simultaneously treated with more than one drug. The probability of drug interactions increases with every additional drug.\n\n\nMATERIAL AND METHODS\nA systematic internet and literature search up to February 2015 was carried out. Systematic lists were included. In addition, the drug prescription information sheets were used and an internet search via Pubmed and google.com was carried out for drugs alone and in combination in order to find substance-specific interactions.\n\n\nRESULTS\nA differentiation is made between pharmaceutical, pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic drug interactions. Pharmaceutical interactions are caused by chemical, physical or physicochemical incompatibility of drugs or adjuvants used. These can even occur outside the body and during concomitant administration via the same route. A pharmacodynamic interaction in pain management is for example the additive sedative effect of opioids and benzodiazepines when taken together. Pharmacokinetic interactions occur during the absorption, distribution, metabolism and in the elimination phases.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nMany drug interactions can be avoided by careful and continuous evaluation of pharmacotherapy and if necessary its adaptation; however, a sound knowledge of the underlying pharmacological mechanisms and the properties of currently used analgesics is necessary.","inCitations":["8094d0e734c622ac597823ebd580856615100bed"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"[Drug interactions in pain therapy].","doi":"10.1007/s00482-015-0017-1","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00482-015-0017-1","venue":"Schmerz"}

Various neutralizing agents against Stxs are under investigation for management of EHEC infection. In this study, we immunized chickens with formalin-inactivated Stx-1 or Stx-2, and obtained immunoglobulin Y (IgY) from the egg yolk. Anti-Stx-1 IgY and anti-Stx-2 IgY recognized the corresponding Stx A subunit and polymeric but not monomeric B subunit. Anti-Stx-1 IgY and anti-Stx-2 IgY suppressed the cytotoxicity of Stx-1 and Stx-2 to HeLa 229 cells, without cross-suppressive activity. The suppressive activity of these IgY was abrogated by pre-incubation with the corresponding recombinant B subunit, which suggests that the antibodies directed to the polymeric B subunits were predominantly involved in the suppression. In vivo, the intraperitoneal or intravenous administration of these IgY rescued mice from death caused by intraperitoneal injection of the corresponding toxin at a lethal dose. Moreover, oral administration of anti-Stx-2 IgY reduced the mortality of mice infected intestinally with EHEC O157:H7. Our results therefore suggest that anti-Stx IgY antibodies may be considered as preventive agents for Stx-mediated diseases in EHEC infection.","inCitations":["2c6717980cda5df03b52f71c53227b76fc128d63","38a97325eada787c77cc85c4e8c8c53e6dfd372d","465033d43804c22207fe92b382e01996ce25a3ce","5c2b41beb685dd7587f327cd79dc3af7a1c73e35","8739c5f3634a5b7509245bed448ba12d3fe016a8","19922f5933c7b3d95c76804413151e5e2ff7e905","d3f8e4e3b48141bf4d1561460332f12ffe3c23ec","8ebc29f7e02877eb6a27fcfe7ac84c35cbbfe393","dc8e7ebaeb836ee574c490405370c01c614cee51","52e75ac53438288782457d4bff9124040332348e","d1f45e3a613c12d4eb43e6b205edb834b2a344ff"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.igy-research.com/English/Specific%20Egg%20Yolk%20Immunoglobulin%20as%20a%20New%20Preventive%20Approach%20for%20Shiga-Toxin-Mediated%20Diseases.pdf"],"title":"Specific Egg Yolk Immunoglobulin as a New Preventive Approach for Shiga-Toxin-Mediated Diseases","doi":"10.1371/journal.pone.0026526","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0026526","venue":"PloS one"}

It appears at a moment inwhich Israelis not only must confront their Arab neighbors, but must deal with one another as Jews possessing radically different views on the present and future of the Jewish tradition. With this seventh volume of the series, the Israeli Sociological Society has turned its attention to religion, an area that for many years has been of high importance, but low profile in Israeli affairs and in the wider Middle Eastern context. Chapters and contributors include: \"Jewish Civilization: Approaches to Problems of Israeli Society\" by Shmuel N. Eisenstadt; \"Life Tradition and Book Tradition in the Development of Ultraorthodox Judaism\" by Menachem Friedman; \"Religious Kibbutzim: Judaism and Modernization\" by Aryei Fishman; \"The Religion of Elderly Oriental Jewish Women\" by Susan Sered; and \"Hanukkah and the Myth of the Maccabees in Ideology and in Society\" by Eliezer Don-Yehiya. The increasing presence of religious activism in contemporary Israel, side by side with subtle changes in the religion of Israeli Sephardim, makes the topic of religion essential for an understanding of Israel--and much of the Middle East generally. Israeli Judaism is a significant work, and will be of interest to theologians, philosophers, sociologists, anthropologists, and political theorists.","inCitations":["b825bdb17c7e203d49bac332636ddc36acc2c8d4","d46a26de05f4efffb57bbe683b412cde7d567081","e35084f10582783b132fd2fb358d6dd042ac7571","d327edd3d74c21ed45fa077d0295c34148a00008"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Israeli Judaism : the sociology of religion in Israel","doi":"10.4324/9781351293921","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.4324/9781351293921","venue":""}

In contrast, red cell lysis by PM was not promoted by AB5 x 3G8 although AB5 was active. However, this lysis, being inhibited by monomeric IgG, was presumably mediated via Fc gamma RI. AB5 x 3G8 also failed to promote the binding and phagocytosis of both papainized and native red cells by PM although 99% of red cells and over 90% of peritoneal cells bound the bispecific antibody.

The results of that study showed a significant improvement in batch culture performance and a reduction in acetate excretion without any significant effect on the growth rate in complex medium. The current study investigates the effect of supplementing the culture medium with the glucose analog alpha-MG on the metabolic fluxes of Escherichia coli under anaerobic chemostat conditions at two different dilution rates. Anaerobic chemostat studies utilizing complex media supplemented with glucose or glucose and alpha-MG at dilution rates of 0.1 and 0.4 h(-1), were performed, and the metabolic fluxes were analyzed. It was found that the addition of the glucose analog alpha-MG has an effect on the specific production rate of various extracellular metabolites. This effect is slightly greater at the higher dilution rate of 0.4 h(-1). However, the glucose analog does not cause any major shift in the central metabolic patterns.

The assay was constructed by self-assembly of the respective hairpin probes (labeled with the electrochemical probes Methylene Blue and ferrocene) on the surface of a gold electrode. After hybridization between target DNA and hairpin probes (HPs) has occurred, the primers hybridize with the open-chain HPs and initiate extension reactions in the presence of polymerase and deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates. This results in the release of the redox labels from the electrode surface and the target dissociating from the HPs. The released target will bind to other HPs to activate new cycles, which results in enhanced suppression of current, measured best at −0.27 V and +0.36 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) for parallel detection of E. coli DNA and S. typh. DNA, respectively. The method presented here based on target recycling amplification and its integration into multiplexed electrochemical detection of pathogens was successfully applied to quantitative determination of E. coli O157:H7 and S. typh. in synthetic samples. In our perception, the strategy presented here represents a rapid and universal platform for sensitive and multiplexed quantitation of pathogens and related molecular diagnostic targets of relevance in food safety control.","inCitations":["eb0eb3d41467a77f582cb7f8cf91a3dc987a0b99","1475ac1c57b287704097e7cbf4381388b597e879","191bd29abffff877e9bb77e425837fc013cf579f","70130b2fcb9b953f76ad2cadf133b7ad41181f86"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Simultaneous voltammetric determination of E. coli and S. typhimurium based on target recycling amplification using self-assembled hairpin probes on a gold electrode","doi":"10.1007/s00604-016-2017-y","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00604-016-2017-y","venue":"Microchimica Acta"}

The Village Fund Program as well as the village facilitator is a government policy step in the Village Community Development and Empowerment Program (P3MD) which is guided by the Number Law. 6 of 2014 concerning Villages. The purpose of the Village Fund assistance program is to increase capacity, effectiveness, accountability of village governance and village development, increase village community awareness and participation in participatory development, improve synergy between rural development programs, and increase village assets in an emancipatory manner. The achievement of the mentoring objectives is carried out through the stages of planning, implementation, supervision of the village development process and empowerment of village communities. The implementation of assistance is carried out in stages with the involvement of several parties, both village officials and village communities in the process of implementing development. One of the objectives is to increase community participation and concern in development activities and to invite the public to take part in the process. \nMeanwhile, the purpose of this study was to determine the effectiveness of the mentoring program in managing village funds for the 2016-2018 fiscal year in the Village of Junrejo, District. Junrejo, Batu City. In this study the researcher used a qualitative descriptive research method that sought to describe and interpret the role of village facilitators in managing village funds in the Village of Junrejo, District. Junrejo, Kota. Stone. Data collection techniques in this study include observation, interviews, and documentation. While data analysis techniques include data collection, data reduction, data presentation, and conclusion drawing. \nThe role of village facilitators in Junrejo Village has been carried out in accordance with the operational standards of village escort procedures in managing village funds. This role was marked by cooperation between village facilitators, village officials and village communities who took part in participating in the development process. This is in accordance with the mandate of the Village Law which is currently implemented which places more emphasis on participatory development by involving the community in the development process. The role of village facilitators in the planning process is in the form of a Village Medium Term Development Plan (RPJMDes). Meanwhile, in the implementation phase the companion role is in overseeing the work program that has been prepared and encouraging the village government to carry out the principles of accountability and transparency in the use of village funds, as well as synchronizing the planning and implementation of development contained in the RPJMDes. Then, in the supervision phase, the companion's role is in the form of reporting on the use of the budget that has been implemented for village development. However, in the ongoing assistance process there are still many obstacles experienced by the facilitators. These constraints include poor hearing from village facilitators by village officials or village communities, and lack of village escort personnel. This resulted in a lack of maximum implementation of village fund management assistance programs in Junrejo Village, Batu City.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Efektifitas Program Pendampingan Dalam Pengelolaan Dana Desa Tahun Anggaran 2016-2018.

We recorded P. zorro from Hanthana (80.6141° E, 7.2497° N; 700 m a.s.l.) and measured six common call characters of 92 calls from four males. We identified four call types based on wave form structure and spectrogram. Type 1 calls were the most frequently emitted call type (93% of 518 calls recorded) having the average call duration 5.1±1.2 mili-seconds. Vocalising frequency of the species ranged between 3,100 Hz and 3,600 Hz. During our field excursions in 2014-2017, we heard similar vocalisation in two sites well away from its known range, Katugasthota (80.6199° E, 7.3302° N; 470 m a.s.l) and Ovilikanda (80.5926° E, 7.4538° E; 470 m a.s.l). We confirm the identity as P. zorro using the morphological characters. Again, on 18th September, 2014 we sighted the species during an excursion to Kukulamalpotha (80.7819° E, 7.5527° N; 460 m a.s.l) in Knuckles reserve. Since the site was very far from the known range of P. zorro, we obtained toe tips from two individuals and confirm their identity genetically by having 0% uncorrected pairwise genetic distance for 16S gene fragment (~510 bp). With three new found locations their Extent of Occurrence and Area of Occupancy has been increased by 14 times (from 20 km2 to 291 km2) and by 2 times (from 16 km2 to 28 km2) respectively. New found populations considerably expanded the species-range and the knowledge of their vocalisation can further use to explore new populations. This study confirms that P. zorro is not restricted as previously thought.

In a recent work [Phys. Rev. A 80, 043802 (2009)], we formulated a general framework for treating preparation of Gaussian quantum states of macroscopic oscillators through linear position measurements. To outline a complete procedure for testing macroscopic quantum mechanics, here we consider a subsequent verification stage which probes the prepared macroscopic quantum state and verifies the quantum dynamics. By adopting an optimal time-dependent homodyne detection in which the phase of the local oscillator varies in time, the conditional quantum state can be characterized below the Heisenberg limit, thereby achieving a quantum tomography. In the limiting case of no readout loss, such a scheme evades measurement-induced back action, which is identical to the variational-type measurement scheme invented by Vyatchanin et al. [JETP 77, 218 (1993)] but in the context for detecting gravitational waves. To motivate macroscopic quantum mechanics experiments with future gravitational-wave detectors, we mostly focus on the parameter regime where the characteristic measurement frequency is much higher than the oscillator frequency and the classical noises are Markovian, which captures the main feature of a broadband gravitational-wave detector. In addition, we discuss verifications of Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen-type entanglement between macroscopic test masses in future gravitational-wave detectors, which enables us to test one particular version of gravity decoherence conjectured by Diosi [Phys. Lett. A120, 377 (1987)] and Penrose [Gen. Rel.

Ten endocrine disrupting compounds: 4-nonylphenol, 2,4-dichlorophenol, estrone, 17β-estradiol, bisphenol A, 4-tert-octylphenol, triclosan, atrazine, imidazole and 1,2,4-triazole were investigated in four rivers and wastewater treatment plants in this study. Rivers were sampled at upstream, midstream and downstream reaches, while the influent and effluent samples of wastewater were collected from treatment plants near the receiving rivers. Sample waters were freeze-dried followed by extraction of the organic content and purification by solid-phase extraction. Concentrations of the compounds in the samples were determined with ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The instrument was operated in the positive electrospray ionization (ESI) mode. The results showed that these compounds are present in the samples with nonylphenol > dichlorophenol > bisphenol A > triclosan > octylphenol > imidazole > atrazine > triazole > estrone > estradiol. Nonylphenol has its highest concentration of 6.72 μg/L in King Williams Town wastewater influent and 2.55 μg/L in midstream Bloukrans River. Dichlorophenol has its highest concentration in Alice wastewater influent with 2.20 μg/L, while it was 0.737 μg/L in midstream Bloukrans River. Uitenhage wastewater effluent has bisphenol A concentration of 1.684 μg/L while it was 0.477 μg/L in the downstream samples of the Bloukrans River. Generally, the upstream samples of the rivers had lesser concentrations of the compounds. The wastewater treatment plants were not able to achieve total removal of the compounds in the wastewater while runoffs and wastes dump from the cities contributed to the concentrations of the compounds in the rivers.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Occurrence of selected endocrine disrupting compounds in the eastern cape province of South Africa","doi":"10.1007/s11356-020-08082-y","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11356-020-08082-y","venue":"Environmental Science and Pollution Research"}
