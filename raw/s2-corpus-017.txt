The organizational justice covers everything on versatile concept from system of payment to treatment of your boss. Researchers of organizational behaviour recognized four types of organizational justice that is procedural, distributive, interactional and informational justice. Procedural justice perceptions considered to be one of the most crucial variables of organizational justice perceptions. The effect of different level of organizational justice on organizational citizenship behaviour is a widespread researched topic and explains the importance of organizational justice in an organization. The purpose of this quantitative study is to investigate the impact of employee trust on the relationship between organizational justice and organizational citizenship behaviour in the perspective of call centre industry in Pakistan. The sample size covered 160 employees of different call centres of Islamabad. A total of 38 questions were asked based on a 5 point Likert scale responses. For accurate data processing, SPSS Statistics software package is used for statistical analysis. Regression is used to test the hypothesis. The results show that there is a positive relationship between Organizational Justice and OCB (Accepted), there is a positive relationship between Procedural Justice and OCB (Rejected), there is a positive relationship between Distributional Justice and OCB (Accepted), there is a positive relationship between Interactional Justice and OCB (Accepted) and employee trust does not mediate the associations between Organizational Justice and OCB, which is a positive effects on OCB.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Organization Justice and Organization Citizenship Behaviour: Employee Trust Acting as Mediator","doi":"10.30537/sijmb.v3i2.100","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.30537/sijmb.v3i2.100","venue":""}

Alopecia areata (AA) is infrequently reported in HIV-infected patients. Certain underlying conditions have been associated with AA, including a decreased CD4:CD8 ratio related to the progression of HIV infection, some opportunistic infections, and syphilis. Several antiretroviral drugs, such as zidovudine, indinavir, indinavir/ritonavir, lopinavir/ritonavir, and atazanavir/ritonavir have been implicated in the development of AA. At present, the occurrence of AA has not been associated with abacavir use. We cannot exclude that the use of abacavir and the development of AA could be coincidental.

Kawungaten Kab. Cilacap sangat berpotensi dimanfaatkan sebagai usaha pembuatan gula kelapa. quot;Penderes quot; adalah sebutan bagi orang yang bekerja membuat gula, dan quot;andel quot;, adalah sebutan untuk pengumpul yang membeli gula dari penderes. Menarik apabila melihat perjanjian yang dilakukan oleh keduanya, karena penderes yang akan menjual gula terlebih dahulu meminta pinjaman uang ke andel. Pinjaman tersebut bukan sebagai modal, akan tetapi untuk kebutuhan konsumtif, dan oleh andel pinjaman tersebut dijadikan pengikat bahwa penderes adalah pelanggannya, sehingga penderes tidak diperbolehkan menjual gulanya kepada andel lain sebelum pinjaman dilunasi, selain itu dituntut pula untuk rutin menjual gulanya kepada andel yang memberikan pinjaman, dengan demikian dapat dikatakan bahwa pinjaman yang diberikan andel adalah pinjaman bersyarat. Setelah melakukan observasi di lapangan, ternyata banyak di antara kedua pihak melakukan wansprestasi yang disebabkan banyak hal. Berdasarkan pelaksanaan dan proses perjanjian inilah, penelitian ini dilakukan. Adapun yang menjadi fokus penelitian adalah tentang akad pinjaman bersyarat, penyebab wansprestasi, dan pandangan maqAƒÂ¢A…A¸id asy-syarAƒÂ®A¢â‚¬â„¢ah tentang pinjaman bersyarat tersebut. Dengan teknik purposive sampling peneliti berusaha mengungkap masalah yang terjadi dengan memilih sample berdasarkan pertimbangan yang bisa mewakili populasi, selanjutnya menggunakan sudut pandang maqAƒÂ¢A…A¸id asy-syarAƒÂ®A¢â‚¬â„¢ah untuk menemukan ladasan filosofis terhadap pemberian pinjaman yang dilakukan di daerah penelitian. \nAdapun hasil yang diperoleh adalah: 1. Akad yang dilakukan adalah dengan cara lisan. Pinjaman tersebut lebih bersifat tolong-menolong, karena kedudukan andel selain sebagai pembeli juga sebagai kreditor yang siap membantu kapanpun penderes membutuhkan pinjaman. Kedua pihak telah menyetujui aturan yang ada dalam perjanjian, maka pemberian pinjaman dapat dibenarkan dalam hukum Islam. Adapun perbedaan harga yang diberikan andel kepada pelanggan yang memiliki pinjaman dengan yang tidak memiliki pinjaman, tujuannya adalah untuk membagi keuntungan dengan andel kecil, dengan alasan tidak mau merebut pelanggan, karena apabila perbedaan itu tidak dilakukan, maka dapat merugikan andel kecil. Padahal merebut transaksi yang telah disepakati dalam suatu perjanjian adalah perbuatan yang dilarang, maka perbedaan harga tersebut dapat dibenarkan hukum Islam. 2. Wansprestasi yang dilakukan tidak ada satupun yang dibenarkan dalam Islam. 3. Makna dari memberi pinjaman adalah menolong orang lain yang sangat membutuhkan, dan artinya telah menolong kehidupan seseorang, baik menyelamatkan agama, jiwa, keturunan, harta dan akal. Peranan maqAƒÂ¢A…A¸id asysyarAƒÂ®A¢â‚¬â„¢ah adalah ketika andel dan penderes saling memenuhi perjanjian, dan tidak melakukan wansprestasi agar keduanya sama-sama diuntungkan dan kesejahteraan dapat terwujud, tetapi akan sebaliknya apabila adanya wansprestasi, karena dapat mengancam semua kebutuhan dAŒÂ£aruri, artinya akan terancam pula agama, jiwa, keturunan, harta dan akal.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Pinjaman Bersyarat Dalam Tinjauan Hukum Islam (studi Di Dusun Tegalsari Desa Kawunganten Lor Kec.

This study introduces a new mixed distribution model for the parent distribution of mean wind speed in order to provide a better modeling of distribution for strong wind speed region.

For example, treatment of cultured chondrocytes with recombinant insulinlike growth factor–I (IGF-I) increases matrix production and enhances chondrocyte proliferation and survival. While normally, the ability of cartilage tissues to heal is limited, we have previously shown that combining IGF-I with chondrocyte transplants in experimentallyinduced full-thickness cartilage defects results in morphological and biochemical improvement in the repair tissue. However, IGF-I residence time in defects is transient and better repair may follow extended IGF-I persistence in the lesion. Gene therapy offers the prospect of extending the time IGF-I is released at the site of cartilage injury. Previously we have also shown that articular tissues can be successfully transduced in vitro using an adenoviral construct with the genetic sequence for IGF-I (AdIGF-I). Preliminary short-term in vivo analyses suggest that transplanted AdIGF-I modified chondrocytes improve healing of articular cartilage defects. The purpose of this study was to investigate the molecular, biochemical and biomechanical effects of AdIGF-I genetically modified chondrocytes on the repair and surrounding tissue compared to defects implanted with naïve chondrocytes.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://www.ors.org/Transactions/51/1345.pdf"],"title":"Molecular, Biochemical and Biomechanical Analysis of Articular Cartilage Repairedwith Genetically Modified Chondrocytes Expressing Insulin-like Growth Factor-i","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Small fibre neuropathy and ganglionopathy are said to be the commonest types of neuropathy in pSS 1 . Small fibre neuropathy is under-recognised since physical examination is often normal and nerve conduction studies show no abnormalities. The increased use of skin biopsy has improved our diagnostic sensitivity. Objectives To estimate the frequency of small fibre neuropathy and ganglionopathy in pSS patients with neuropathic symptoms using skin biopsy, and to describe the clinical characteristics of these patients. Methods We identified 25 patients with pSS who were investigated for symptoms of small fibre neuropathy and/or ganglionopathy between January 2010 and December 2015. Patients were assessed by neurological examination, nerve conduction studies, skin biopsy and imaging where appropriate. Results 13/25 patients had conclusive evidence of small fibre neuropathy (n=12) or ganglionopathy (n=1) on skin biopsy. A further 2/25 patients had borderline skin biopsies suggestive of small fibre neuropathy. 12/13 patients with clear evidence of small fibre neuropathy/ganglionopathy were female. Median age at time of neuropathy diagnosis was 60 years (range 42 – 84, interquartile range 56 – 63). 2 presented initially to a neurologist, and the remainder to a rheumatologist. At least one autoantibody was detected in 11/13. Autoantibody frequencies were ANA 62%, RF 31%, anti-Ro 46%, and anti-La 23%. 7/13 patients met the American-European Consensus Group (AECG) criteria for the diagnosis of definite pSS. 4 of the 6 who did not meet the AECG criteria had a positive ANA or RF. Of these four, 2 had a salivary gland ultrasound (US) characteristic of pSS, and 1 was anti-Ro antibody positive. Both patients with borderline skin biopsies had anti-Ro antibodies and one also had antibodies to La. Median time from diagnosis of pSS to diagnosis of small fibre neuropathy or ganglionopathy was 16 months. In a quarter of patients, the diagnosis of neuropathy was made within 6 months of the diagnosis of pSS. Nerve conduction studies (NCS) did not show a neuropathy in 8/13. In the remaining 5 patients, NCS showed sensory axonal neuropathy in 4 patients, one of whom had diabetes mellitus, and ganglionopathy in 1. In the 2 patients with borderline skin biopsies, NCS suggested a mild sensory axonal neuropathy in one and a mild sensorimotor abnormality in the other. Conclusions Small fibre neuropathy is an under-recognised complication of pSS in clinical practice. In over half of our pSS patients who presented with neuropathic symptoms, a diagnosis of small fibre neuropathy or ganglionopathy was confirmed. Rheumatologists should consider the possibility of small fibre neuropathy in pSS, and not be falsely reassured by normal clinical examination or nerve conduction studies. 2 patients presented initially to a neurologist. Neurologists should consider Sjogren9s syndrome in patients presenting with small fibre neuropathy. References Birnbaum J.

The biosynthesis of rubber is dependent on isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP) precursors derived from the mevalonate (MVA) pathway. The cDNA sequences of seven MVA pathway genes from latex of T. brevicorniculatum were isolated, including three cDNA sequences encoding for 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductases (TbHMGR1-3). Expression analyses indicate an important role of TbHMGR1 as well as for the HMG-CoA synthase (TbHMGS), the diphosphomevalonate decarboxylase and the mevalonate kinase in the provision of precursors for rubber biosynthesis. The amino acid sequences of the TbHMGRs show the typical motifs described for plant HMGRs such as two transmembrane domains and a catalytic domain containing two HMG-CoA and two NADP(H) binding sites. The functionality of the HMGRs was demonstrated by complementation assay using an IPP auxotroph mutant of Escherichia coli. Furthermore, the transient expression of the catalytic domains of TbHMGR1 and TbHMGR2 in Nicotiana benthamiana resulted in a strong accumulation of sterol precursors, one of the major groups of pathway end-products.","inCitations":["424e2e736b68968ac0ba5a54960d23e003b5683a","cbe28d296d21e0ccfa311ccbaf68ec96e5db3e68","ac6d4f14268b2623ad9d564da5290fcb5b39fafd","889c617d14feb8578bd53f9dc649e002e4cb7856","0d01a5f622cfc419c10b602e8476e678fc122367","b1d3dff9a59c386facc29be832eb18cae78f9239","a2644dc506a92d1b99b839be1aea33b0f1f30365","9129f5b7d902d8cf22b8a27dffe77ef16020bfe8","3f991e64fa89b210272d333e111b5ed7b6b1f298","504acb08b8da0009a71326cc77765e3121c390cd","3347572b9a14753d1a76b5318e1e6a347332ce63","70ab13278283eadf5667a243d6640903f9b519ab","b284e47d53541b7fa228e53c638844c06074d85e","9c8b83283bacdea8d5279b21163a06a320c7c532","81e3f6d60d09aeddb9053e94caab562b23b0f9e9","72019c7be40f2472df284fe2b9c2374203001dec","c69a3c1ca24fc20ef9433a304b3c969ece7f21fc"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Molecular cloning of mevalonate pathway genes from Taraxacum brevicorniculatum and functional characterisation of the key enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase","doi":"10.1007/s11033-011-1221-4","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11033-011-1221-4","venue":"Molecular Biology Reports"}

Interval routing is a popular way of building such compact tables. It was already known that any network can support an interval routing function with only one interval per output port as soon as one allows intervals to be “cyclic” [13]. However, it might be interesting for practical reasons to allow only the use of “linear” intervals (see [2]). This notion is particularly useful to derive results on networks built by cartesian products (as hypercubes and torus) [4]. In this paper, we characterize the networks that admit a linear interval routing function with at most one interval per output port. We also characterize the networks that admit a strict linear interval routing function with at most one interval per output port. -","inCitations":["d3c6e422dc1394e3e6855623d3175a654c62c87d","bd589095c4b2590f5e18beaf4fd27bb79f83d896","b0a8b0515cbe1a72adb57e3987055bec3340fb18","d95975e0e9ccc8acf86bdbfae9cb17a1ced4abc9","8d22f5677e36f58ae7a4f26209dbd42475932616","ce448d26ed1ee53b2b456c6c246404f116e15804","274e9aaedb78f9f3ed54eca0d4032fd73b97ab27","f476091f950a0837a108cf7395b6ee0b75f26aea","28d21e39233a9da79857a29ee2dc0dd23c3819b7","7652df903d303d58e09550f1576c6a4d5779012a","5d81afd4a9550a417017a6a5d26c629228c98b4b","12064eb66f553ddf19711bc29ea8a62945b39a0b","31eff8c7bfe5087cba7a1b96ca63c5452881734b","07f7ef3d0e3b243f05617ce5e5b933e4ae85e75a","c1002b0d60014b0ab7d923f9157ffccf053ec334","758dff9637dfc3f2224a6c3001282d4c18c33829","45320accb5c19c4be05de4d5356283123dd76367","3eadbd41fcd3997ce377ac5cd92c528f5a40a72b","cad5f829e1411e3148158bfa29ff642786de0d6b","71826fc72086c0556d554bc4cbd4c1c8695c1e70"],"pdfUrls":["http://dept-info.labri.fr/~gavoille/article/FG94c","https://doi.org/10.1145/197917.198095","http://dept-info.labri.fr/~gavoille/article/FG94c/","http://www.researchgate.net/profile/Cyril_Gavoille/publication/221343729_A_Characterization_of_Networks_Supporting_Linear_Interval_Routing/links/53d256170cf2a7fbb2e99585.pdf","http://dept-info.labri.u-bordeaux.fr/~gavoille/article/FG94c.ps.gz"],"title":"A characterization of networks supporting linear interval routing","doi":"10.1145/197917.198095","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1145/197917.198095","venue":"PODC '94"}

As a demonstration, polylactide (PLA) was end-capped with lithium carboxylate ionic groups (hPLA13kLi) and evaluated. Thin films of the hPLA13kLi and PLA homopolymer were prepared with and without surface texturing. Murine osteoblast progenitor cells from collagen 1α1 transgenic reporter mice were used to assess cell attachment, proliferation, differentiation, and mineralization. Measurement of green fluorescent protein expressed by these cells and xylenol orange staining for mineral allowed quantitative analysis. The hPLA13kLi was biologically active, increasing initial cell attachment and enhancing differentiation, while reducing proliferation and strongly suppressing mineralization, relative to PLA. These effects of bound lithium ions (Li(+) ) had not been previously reported, and were generally consistent with the literature on soluble additions of lithium. The surface texturing generated here did not influence cell behavior. These results demonstrate that end-capping could be a useful approach in scaffold design, where a wide range of biologically active groups could be employed, while likely retaining the desirable characteristics associated with the unaltered homopolymer backbone.","inCitations":["1ea805f618238007236eae99cd0f9d30ad7a913d"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Lithium-end-capped polylactide thin films influence osteoblast progenitor cell differentiation and mineralization.","doi":"10.1002/jbm.a.35190","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1002/jbm.a.35190","venue":"Journal of biomedical materials research.

We studied the rebound of these LDL-subfractions after LDL apheresis in seven patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) regularly treated by apheresis (58 +/- 9 years, LDL-cholesterol = 342 +/- 87 mg/dl(-1), triglycerides = 109 +/- 39 mg/dl(-1)) and high-dose statins. Apolipoprotein B (apoB) concentrations were measured in LDL subfractions immediately after and on days 1, 2, 3, 5, and 7 after apheresis. Compartmental models were developed to test three hypotheses: 1) that dense LDLs are derived from the delipidation of buoyant and intermediate LDLs (model A); 2) that dense LDLs are generated directly from LDL-precursors (model B); or 3) that a model combining both pathways (model C) is necessary to describe the metabolism of dense LDLs. In all models, it was assumed that apoB production and fractional catabolic rate (FCR) did not change with apheresis. Apheresis decreased buoyant, intermediate, and dense LDL-apoB by 60 +/- 12%, 67 +/- 5%, and 69 +/- 11%, respectively. Models B and C, but not model A, described the rebound data. The model with the greatest biological plausibility (model C) was used to estimate metabolic parameters. FCR was 1.05 +/- 0.86 d(-1), 0.48 +/- 0.11 d(-1), and 0.69 +/- 0.24 d(-1) for buoyant, intermediate, and dense LDLs, respectively. Dense LDL production was 17.3 +/- 0.2 mg/kg(-1)/d(-1), 58% of which was derived directly from LDL precursors (VLDL, IDL, or direct secretion), while 42% was derived from buoyant and intermediate LDLs. Thus, our data indicate that in statin-treated patients with heterozygous FH dense LDLs originate from two sources. Whether this is also valid in other metabolic situations (with predominant small, dense LDLs) remains to be determined.","inCitations":["68ed951590d7718fadbd655b19cda35c0aef7751","be1270f508cc33d7a9f1ef5f6564ca1db37d02a3","b4da8c72b1be1abe14f46a18971e26d86c29b908","d23763dd6418ff7618f2208cad17a8d2c2e4ea72","7daea7968d7741489b236b934fe28011c1a79e18","c6969d07db98d216584e896244744e5eaa9f270c","4a454e5d396a741e6f19f1e9084e86a5c463fb9c","877ed6582c95853a402d8dd9a34235854a1c83f3","485440347f2ff3b59e9359db3de0b71c245cf5ea","33453afbb9eb88b1a26c07b89608655aaab2533f","7ea072301e0fac6ededc47da5871ae1af5ac22b4","08b63e26036fdbd60ab2095330e120ca39e8e317"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"In vivo metabolism of LDL subfractions in patients with heterozygous FH on statin therapy: rebound analysis of LDL subfractions after LDL apheresis.","doi":"10.1194/jlr.M300523-JLR200","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1194/jlr.M300523-JLR200","venue":"Journal of lipid research"}

Because a variety of factors impede the renewables’ progress on the market, an effective assistance policy must be applied in many fields. These normally include research, development, demonstration, financial market incentives, information, consulting, education and advanced training, and international cooperation. For an effective assistance policy, the legal and institutional framework conditions are of great relevance. They are often given less attention when they do not include financial assistance by the state. This paper would like to give a contribution to the discussion on such options without financial assistance by the state. Legal and institutional factors can seriously hinder the use of renewable energies. On the other hand, they can also be used to promote such energy sources. Five examples from Germany are presented to illustrate concrete possibilities for policy action within the legal and institutional frameworks which may be of interest for other countries: (1) introduction of an Electricity Feed Law (in future Renewable-Energies-Law), (2) amendment of the Energy Industry Act and of anti-trust statutes, (3) amendment of the Federal Building Code, (4) changes in the schedule of fees for architects and engineers, (5) establishment of local and regional energy agencies and a federal center for energy-related information. The contents of these very different measures and their specific impacts will be outlined. Where the nature of the measures does not allow an exact quantitative analysis of the impacts at the moment, they are described in general terms.","inCitations":["a32853b1c311ca7ffc7d6165f4bb07be717960c5","e9afded805742980a616dde97513b6c06e6f0a93","81abbdff30098f3ff2a41af1cae6d48bd186f19e","c2455ee9a0b8a78df5f1037d558f0434fe269a02","800875a36fc853b5bb4d6c1711b5ba17a73ca71a","95a9a8425ac944f3b013055533657c0d459eeab0","4f370451b4c33c961d438656e62f76fa0aea8377","3de15e90246171a725eed97332d95e46a3b9390b","ec427a6e7981d655e8f8345076557b5839fb4267","05d39ea0dd6b46893652a1d7115be504be64cdbf"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Regulatory and institutional measures by the state to enhance the deployment of renewable energies:: German experiences","doi":"10.1016/S0038-092X(00)00060-8","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/S0038-092X%2800%2900060-8","venue":""}

En Sima Engana (Sierra de las Nieves, SE de la Peninsula Iberica) se ha llevado a cabo el analisis de la secuencia estratigrafica de un conjunto alternante de sedimentos detriticos y espeleotemas conservados en su interior. La datacion de las diferentes familias de espeleotemas mediante series de Uranio ( 230 Th/ 234 U), una capa de carbon a techo de la secuencia mediante δ 14 C junto con la caracterizacion de los sedimentos detriticos a partir de la difraccion de Rayos X y estudios granulometricos, ha permitido identificar la ciclicidad paleoclimatica en los ultimos 465.000 anos. Las diferentes fases sedimentarias responden a la alternancia de pulsos mas o menos energeticos de las aguas endokarsticas. La deposicion de fracciones detriticas esta ligada a flujos energeticos que transportaban sedimentos fundamentalmente aloctonos. El desarrollo de espeleotemas se asocia a momentos de baja energia con pulsos de agua laminar que generaron coladas y, goteos, que dieron lugar a estalagmitas. El analisis de los resultados pone de manifiesto que las diferentes etapas con las que se relacionan los sedimentos tractivos y los espeleotemas, tuvieron lugar en un periodo de tiempo que abarca desde 464.019 ± 16.668 anos BP, estadio isotopico 13 (Pleistoceno Medio) hasta 525 ± 15 anos BP, estadio isotopico 1 (Holoceno), todas edades calibradas.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Deducciones paleoclimáticas a partir del estudio de una secuencia sedimentaria alternante de espeleotemas y sedimentos detríticos en Sima Engañá, Sierra de las Nieves (Málaga)","doi":"10.17735/cyg.v32i1-2.56659","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.17735/cyg.v32i1-2.56659","venue":""}

Measurement of the spectrum of scattered laser light permits simultaneous determination of the velocities of all particles in the laser beam, with the relative intensity from each particle proportional to its light scattering cross-section. Simple experimental modifications allow the tracking of the oscillations of the streaming velocities. Rhythmic wall contractions can be monitored simultaneously with the flow velocities. Interpretation of the Doppler spectra shows that a small fraction of the particles in the flowing protoplasm are moving with velocities two to four times greater than the characteristic velocities reported by optical microscopy. Transverse velocities in the tubes are nearly as great as the longitudinal velocities. The shape of the Doppler spectrum at the maximum of the oscillation cycle is consistent with a spatial velocity profile which is sharper than parabolic, presumably because of a viscosity gradient from the center to the walls of the plasmodial tubes. The shape of the Doppler spectrum of depolarized scattered light is of approximately the same form. The response of the plasmodium to increased temperature is an increase in the frequency of the velocity oscillations with little change in the magnitude of the velocities. The response of the plasmodium to very high intensities of laser light is to gel at the point of incidence.","inCitations":["f3a63ab5865ee4384facd3a116c655dc24b2ae0e","48b972cc4396d704e1a7506c8a26f98810a43ab7","25b9c3ba252d10da436a36deee5affc2d6c7bcc7"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"A study of protoplasmic streaming inPhysarum by laser Doppler spectroscopy","doi":"10.1007/BF01291926","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/BF01291926","venue":"Protoplasma"}

Experiments were performed at frog neuromuscular junctions using electrophysiological recording techniques. Increases in asynchronous ACh release, reflected as the frequency of occurrence of miniature end-plate potentials (MEPP(f)), were evoked by high potassium depolarization in either Ca(2+) or Sr(2+) solutions. Increases in MEPP(f) mediated by Ca(2+) were of very low probability and well-described by a Poisson distribution whilst similar MEPP(f) increases mediated by Sr(2+) were best described as a simple binomial distribution. From the binomial distribution in Sr(2+) solutions, values for the average probability of release (p) and the number of releasable ACh quanta (n) may be determined (whereby mean MEPP(f) = np). In Sr(2+) solutions, values of p were independent of both bin width and of the value of n, suggesting that both n and p were stationary. Calculations of p using the simple binomial distribution in Sr(2+) solutions gave theoretical values for the third moment of the mean which were indistinguishable from the experimental distribution. These results, in conjunction with Monte Carlo simulations of the data, suggest that spatial and temporal variance do not measurably affect the analysis. Synchronous ACh release evoked by nerve impulses (end-plate potentials, EPPs) follow a simple binomial distribution in both Ca(2+) and Sr(2+) solutions. Similar mean levels of synchronous ACh release (m, where m = np) were produced by lower values of p and higher values of n in Ca(2+) as compared to Sr(2+). The statistical analyses suggest the presence of two different Ca(2+)-dependent steps in the final stages of neurotransmitter release. The results are discussed in accordance with (i) statistical models for quantal neurotransmitter release, (ii) the role of Sr(2+) as a partial agonist for evoked ACh release, and (iii) the specific loci that may represent the sites of Ca(2+) and Sr(2+) sensitivity.","inCitations":["1b8a39b153beec9f0f4b51c554985be45a3d8795","731e440ad306fc2e2a687cabed1d0b89d30799c0","8ada89f1bb9383a66d162941598713114c0e6199","4f28dc55076f9989a17c412f0e8dcce1c7a4e448","a54398d6389ec170c0ee056ea42e4cb87a1817ce","4d0b905ecf7b9a3b60fe9ca909711bbcfbdfba36","1ec8f9824ca9a43c2724b496f53cfebe0bce6057"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Evidence for two distinct processes in the final stages of neurotransmitter release as detected by binomial analysis in calcium and strontium solutions.","doi":"10.1113/jphysiol.2001.013129","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1113/jphysiol.2001.013129","venue":"The Journal of physiology"}

Wushanicaritin, a natural polyphenol from Epimedium species, has shown many biological activities. However, the transporters responsible for excretion of wushanicaritin glucuronides still remain undefined. Herein, chemical inhibitors (Ko143, MK571, dipyridamole and leukotriene C4) and single stable knocked-down efflux transporters (BCRP, MRP1, MRP3 and MRP4) were used to determine the contributions of efflux transporters to glucuronide efflux and cellular glucuronidation in UGT1A1-overexpressing HeLa cells (HeLa1A1). Knock-down of transporters was performed by stable transfection of short hairpin RNA (shRNA) using lentiviral vectors. The HeLa1A1 cell lysate catalyzed wushanicaritin glucuronidation, generating wushanicaritin-3-O-glucuronide and wushanicaritin-7-O-glucuronide. Ko143 (a dual inhibitor of BCRP, 5-20 μM) caused a marked decrease in excretion rate (maximal 53.4%) and increase of intracellular glucuronides (maximal 86.0%), while MK-571 (an inhibitor of MRPs, 5-20 μM) resulted in a significant reduction in excretion rate (maximal 64.6%) and rise of intracellular glucuronides (maximal 98.0%). By contrast, dipyridamole and leukotriene C4 showed no inhibitory effects on glucuronide excretion. Furthermore, shRNA-mediated silencing of a target transporter led to a marked reduction in the excretion rate of wushanicaritin glucuronides (maximal 33.8% for BCRP; 25.9% for MRP1; 26.7% for MRP3; 39.3% for MRP4). Transporter silencing also led to substantial decreases in efflux clearance (maximal 61.5% for BCRP; 48.7% for MRP1; 35.1% for MRP3; 63.1% for MRP4). In conclusion, chemical inhibition and gene silencing results suggested that BCRP, MRP1, MRP3 and MRP4 were significant contributors to excretion of wushanicaritin glucuronides.","inCitations":["24b252050d0e1d6d948a58d8e7f5b681c0831e9a","83a7911758a02a1086e00f48d9b12daf1d4f24b9","8bdf0a00bebcb4e5c9147e5f9b63a72974da3b47","7214582763ba5364f433addbc0a8ded250f5c449"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Chemical inhibition and stable knock-down of efflux transporters leads to reduced glucuronidation of wushanicaritin in UGT1A1-overexpressing HeLa cells: the role of breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) and multidrug resistance-associated proteins (MRPs) in the excretion of glucuronides.","doi":"10.1039/c7fo01298e","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1039/c7fo01298e","venue":"Food & function"}

When major power system disturbances occur, protection and control actions are required to stop power system instability and restore the system to a normal state by minimizing the impact of the disturbance. Therefore, effective intelligent techniques are required to model and identify such a complex system. In this paper, a FuNN identifier (FuNNI) of a turbogenerator model is proposed. Computer simulations are carried out to investigate the modelling after deriving the mathematical model of the turbogenerator equipped with a conventional turbine governor and automatic voltage regulator (AVR). Inverse identification scheme is adopted using a multi-input multi-output (MIMO) fuzzy neural network. Empirical results show that the proposed FuNNI is capable of successfully identifying a highly nonlinear turbogenerator system and robust even when the configurations of the plant change due to faults in the power system.","inCitations":["3b98890b7209a868e093b3da92dbeb150966a6ff","b3dd3f7e8b29a8d97d2bc9bf31b439e909f08827","5c99188c50735862735f67f2dc2106a4a2cc4ea1"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.surrey.ac.uk/computing/files/pdf/papers/Yaochu_Jin/Albukhanajer-IJCNN-PID3150971.pdf","http://www.surrey.ac.uk/cs/files/pdf/papers/Yaochu_Jin/Albukhanajer-IJCNN-PID3150971.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2014.6889607"],"title":"Effective identification of a turbogenerator in a SMIB power system using Fuzzy Neural Networks","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2014.6889607","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2014.6889607","venue":"2014 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)"}

Two chapters from a 1911 textbook on cystoscopy have been reprinted that describe catheter and instrument care and preprocedure requirements for cystoscopy performed in the hospital, office, or home. Sterilization methods and instruments for cystoscopy have improved in the century since this book was written but the rationale for the procedure and concepts guiding the instrumentation have some similarity with the practices performed nearly 100 years ago. Some comments also provide a bit of comic relief. One example, \"this undoubtedly shortens the life of the catheter, but it lengthens the life of the patient\" appears in the discussion about catheter cleaning after use in a pus case.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Practical cystoscopy: care of the instruments and preparation for a cystoscopic examination.","doi":"","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"Urologic nursing"}

According to a recent proposal, dorsal parietal cortex (DPC) allocates top-down attention to memory retrieval, whereas ventral parietal cortex (VPC) mediates the bottom-up attentional capture by retrieved contents, i.e., the Attention-to-Memory (AtoM) hypothesis. Here, for the first time, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and lesion techniques were combined in a single study to test the role of parietal cortex in episodic retrieval. Participants studied word pairs and then detected studied (target) words among new words. In some conditions, a studied word cued the upcoming target word, facilitating recognition performance. In line with the AtoM hypothesis, left DPC was engaged when participants searched for/anticipated memory targets upon presentation of relevant memory cues and predicted the ensuing behavioral advantage. In contrast, left VPC predicted efficacy and speed of target detection on noncued trials and was largest for memory targets that were invalidly cued. Consistent with fMRI evidence, patients with lesions in DPC did not benefit from memory cueing, whereas patients with lesions in VPC had problems recognizing unexpected memory targets. These results support the AtoM hypothesis that DPC and VPC mediate top-down and bottom-up attention to memory retrieval, respectively.","inCitations":["57ce4ca34851c923fa1e387dcf74c4b94f5c4f1f","a4a3cdcadbd0fbfdcac0be88407b040425774abe","67a56efb49b1d6b54fd00e3690a42aa042a0669b","1df7ec6fc2deaae9e6159c0026ae40ac46e20b58","5a2a5b4cd0e9ee1055c4f3b9f9f6b1e711a3734f","b9962a6c7b3b1c1c9e9740812743f81d72faf86d","b672da24f57e71e4714d985d6ff3b17dff72b5ea","71d49959acbf02a3f10fa7c55b24bbc3b3c99e22","27c34b54931800f44158a9e23f0b049aefca2367","df8267d5b19519c811976c0888e25b1ba6cdfd57","63c21cd15bda95d4b3c87e8ce530c22368ae5567","22bc5132a9b6409a4370eb7597e1ce03176d4614","31c8930ef7a0bd0f421801e5638eb35ce8af930c","1fc76bf3aa092aa2fb5dd8143144d85545ee27fa","7572a6d0c776c9cb5188ef1fe25680cbd3c0004c","207c1072f6c23b9ffcd04a3a49f8706ab1339cfe","48ec5184645bfeae1ec59a199fdab517d84e91cd","2e3b722700321b3a6e4d44c5dffcbf30b596297f","e0f378050fcd29ec56f63fd8728dbf25138c5e9a","6e77d52bdb17cd444a34cbf9af1a004c6b074d80","b02b9e055d6794c258fb4acbe6827ad8e490706a","cae80d66bcf821603c761fe4cad150ab29be6156","465d588591544ae1a9e495f7ba83cd484cce913d","a76f1e7dca2d0b2b064d2f09608061894cbb51cf","19d764ee326da50f44a198b1cc3ab914b78f455d","77e51eeedbb8623ec65723a62642217baa9b223c","7295059d4d0caa1a700c4db2a6f3100487167807","d336cb053d996181b4617d32a36626dffbfc761b","ee46a9c9c2b959ed22f6fe5a10fabc5dff7c484c","8a06c6e9e6664ab16e89be18025041758d2d44c6","2d2245b5ea86873b8564503fe302ee26521fa3cd","6a95fa972be71b4ea50a2e717ee4c75a84c266f8","f1e79ffd262a71c947ffe65118538e9b7c73cc38","5e4a7e4afa86e968b82fee335f5fc3aa04715ce3","8cb83fac9d344a8341d0e2c9715adec41a13da54","7495ce1091421bedf14051cd863570891ad9e8a2","000e6afc0984b70ea05dae4b6809d25cbc0b5519","3bdd39a899fb3a4ddd993dfb5500bf00cce6556c","cfc6d14c7996fd4401d447069523a1fc167e7792","80e4d2fb73e8728278ef37a53f26f65232c264d5","0a7ffac94efe2ca3bc9ada1d35afc1e425a24861","576894657e5264a68b16601ba47c890e244e3fb7","f44d23e694ac64f4435711fc67af79eda3def756","1eec535b4b16c02d3ed13e144c36c15bb28d4d53","c967a3742565bae89f8180fc281d6f38af169d4d","2bb8637ab335f46b5666f4fc74ef934e654b0b39","a504448880ae7b49372916901449527c1abcedfc","baea4b09748188cdda47bf4d7a6701e3d882e1c1","862f640a9cb5e38ffa46d4a45914d62c9182b13c","448d4b4c68400ab893e3a6fdce9f98646dd5b496","4247e31df683baf03deae42652c98ef19cb0004e","3f6862177aca0b6a157f51b9406b12b3638af75e","32a5216fe1ad5dd9608a389a4fbf0e30b728011e","e030274bd51f4d745406db2d9df30b8c5896d16b","53bfb7fe4e43e9a78aadb3577642320dcec4eb9a","88f9d4ed04a1535cc18ce9320ce144c8667d7c4e","46a9bf927c1e792eb596c2eddeba468d3b294039","2e743e1eabbc47841fb28ef08350d2f32a936a6e","6040dddd3784c1207ea2473e558b126ef347dd0f","440da32e40eb9966a8ddf2c3f2b0b40b69826bfb","e4d9390f036b494daf012caf332f351a74683e80","2df0c02aec4309f8e9232471e993bd20da943d66","4510a6ebacb61d1f23ac3f2344dee85d721f5056","ab2486d9a93dc593ca649adf2f4a79706c402f33","dcfb81b2f3de0971ea938506e571cf65331baaf8","61454bce3b87bb1e62cfe0e3128a3e4a2ab7e5a5","c803ca453455846ce44d2879d2bcc8601ade792d","f5df6e1162261c6c2ff661043601b1e8f6460aa9","6600e5d417325800a5f7fd1577caf96d54bd18e0","a4f11cf61a2becac2fb7d25ced086e2e2ca0713b","c3975aefae4c316e25562286afed523317d3f3b4","38201391711ea8d4e594086d52a1230b6813e9a5","2c34adfda14b9c3d8ad72efab2dab72df44b8171","c89acc900102279bd89f30953468630435597cbf","f558990d986a6a1d2e8c8bd43e02c98911018d86","7ec87a8b7f09429516e7b89969041878b5e63705","f1c15bafda9a74a856a961e9d4c75f3726b9059a","bfde0f9190d5b0a5d4302d5d267cbb2ef7566c5f"],"pdfUrls":["http://psych.utoronto.ca/Neuropsychologylab/PDF/Top-down%20and%20bottom-up%20attention%20to%20mem_b.pdf","http://memorylab.stanford.edu/journalclubs/pdfs/CIA_JN10.pdf","http://web.stanford.edu/group/memorylab/journalclubs/pdfs/CIA_JN10.pdf"],"title":"Top-down and bottom-up attention to memory are dissociated in posterior parietal cortex: neuroimagingand and neuropsychological evidence.","doi":"10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1209-09.2010","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1209-09.2010","venue":"The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience"}

In this sense harmfulness poses a reflective and methodological challenge that compels bioethics to question even about processes and concepts that underlie its daily deeds. Considering that environmental and food harmfulness have their own reflexive and practical history -unrelated to bioethics-, with the participation of actors from diverse spheres it is necessary to make reference to experiences accumulated upon the latest years. As it is stated in the text, there is a necessity of questioning about its discourse and the results derived from it. These experiences constitute the unavoidable ground to keep on thinking over harmfulness from the bioethics standpoint. Since this history also reports obstacles and difficulties with already proposed regulations and value judgements, bioethics when tested against harmfulness is also being tested against an important part of itself.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"From one harmfulness to the other: bioethics faces the challenge of cultivating its pluralism","doi":"10.4067/S1726-569X2001000200012","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.4067/S1726-569X2001000200012","venue":""}

Nanoparticle deposition can affect nucleate boiling heat transfer coefficient via alteration of surface thermal conductivity, roughness, capillary wicking, wettability, and nucleation site density. It can also affect heat transfer by changing bubble departure diameter, bubble departure frequency, and the evaporation of the micro and macrolayer beneath the growing bubbles. In this study, flow boiling was investigated using degassed, deionized water, and 0.001 vol% aluminum oxide nanofluids in a single rectangular brass microchannel for one inlet fluid temperature of 63°C, one flow rate of Re = 100, and two heat fluxes of 130 kW/m2 and 300 kW/m2. High speed images were taken periodically for water and after durations of 25, 75, and 125 minutes of nanofluid flow boiling. The change in regime timing revealed the effect of nanoparticle suspension and nanoparticle deposition on the Onset of Nucelate Boiling (ONB) and the Onset of Bubble Elongation (OBE). Single phase flows at the channel outlet were recorded and compared for different durations of nanofluid flow boiling. The addition of nanoparticles was found to stabilize bubble nucleation and growth and increase heat transfer in the thin film regions of the evaporating menisci.© 2013 ASME","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Flow Boiling Dynamics of Water and Nanofluids in a Single Microchannel at Different Heat Fluxes","doi":"10.1115/HT2013-17492","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1115/HT2013-17492","venue":""}

However, not much is known about how to effectively design interactive cognitive aids in crisis care situations using modern, mobile technologies. \nOur goal is to understand how tablet based cognitive aids can be designed to help crisis care anesthesiologists manage the limited resource of their attention. In collaboration with Dr. Larry Chu and Dr. Kyle Harrison in the AIM lab at Stanford’s School of Medicine we have begun to study the use of cognitive aids in heart failure during anesthesia. After understanding the problems in this smaller domain we will generalize to other crisis scenarios. The AIM lab has found that increased use of the paper Cognitive Aids they currently use have been correlated to reduced errors in simulated crisis care scenarios. We hypothesize that adding a display visible to the whole team and embedding cognitive aids within patient vital displays have the potential benefits of assisting teams in managing individual attention, improving team-based communication, and helping teams maintain a shared mental model of the crisis. We will study how the two aspects of the design of interactive cognitive aids affect their usability and effectiveness by varying the size of the cognitive aid displays, their layout within the physical space, and the kind of information they display. Our first prototype will explore how changing the size of the cognitive aid from personal to large monitor changes how the team sees the cognitive aid. We hypothesize that this will reduce errors by helping the team maintain a shared mental model of the important steps in the crisis. Our second prototype will explore how moving the cognitive aid from a separate cart to being embedded within the patient’s vitals display changes the social and attentional aspects of the cognitive aid. We hypothesize this will increase the overall usage of our cognitive aid and that will correlate with reduced errors. \nMethods \nWe will evaluate two prototypes that build upon the commercially available iPad-based “StanMed” application. Using this application as a prototype, we qualitatively explored the important pieces of a crisis situation and elicited concrete design ideas from doctors. Both of these prototypes will follow this method: Participants are instructed in the use of our cognitive aid prior to a simulation scenario. The researchers watch the scenario from behind a 1-way mirror and video record the training session. We code video of the simulations for interaction errors and make note of of “critical incidents” where tablet-based cognitive aids provide a new opportunity to help doctors, or disrupt work practices. At the end of the scenario we do a post-hoc interview with the participants to gather feedback on the cognitive aid.

The dynamics of a neural field is described by an integrodifferential equation whose integral term characterizes synaptic interactions between neurons in different spatial locations of the network. Translationally symmetric neural fields support a continuum of stationary bump solutions, which may be centered at any spatial location. Random fluctuations are introduced by modeling the system as a spatially extended Langevin equation whose noise term we take to be multiplicative or additive. For nonzero noise, these bumps are shown to wander about the domain in a purely diffusive way. We can approximate the effective diffusion coefficient using a small noise expansion. Upon breaking the (continuous) translation symmetry of the system using a spatially heterogeneous inputs or synapses, bumps in the stochastic neural field can become temporarily pinned to a finite number of locations in the network. In the case of spatially heterogeneous synaptic weights, as the modulation frequency of this heterogeneity increases, the effective diffusion of bumps in the network approaches that of the network with spatially homogeneous weights.","inCitations":["3a77069a7967eb70cff4b21501572ad6b821d858","25491ba941a589181dae0cf331a40fe736109266","19b850965d1f6cdbdf6e101f13e722c34a4785be","6b7c49a002c2739eba49f0e87308b24b633e5011","bd3027c244b1c41e98c20a9117d86ecb0e2eb091","b4f8b217dcd6324e032982807a5c1e4bafbf889f","2cf3a659af5f58a7a5e98d54627d35eab7a60adb","fcfc4337669027cb7c808ff7a5b8764bccd35f92","e89e4668f83442ecd815d4d9de1f7d648be3c250","81335a9657efb7fd9fe73d5529c8e0c6f02c43f7","dc0400118081332cae70cfd4a758752314db217c","03644a77703abc23a9f3e8916ef9e5747e65641f","03259de0b465adae4e50271405d1911c5662f109","c5f8962574d3c846b24dba7943a9fcb53eb76aa2","9f04e4ad2bb570539b4854570629f623600f48a3","862580f432d5102640d84be00b77a3a5ceb29b4c","6224b64730b3ad3466d152a68543b566b302e93f","8a62b7432dbf48b18d3213076be2122e76c2cc3c","cca4b2fe3a119031ccbd41f98a7bef03ab5223ec","8b6260074fb29339fb2ed7a6c2d9769c169590a3","6e712ae39cbbab94ced39c378d663fb2714052e7","94c3466caf57c7d9f7d9d6144615beef564dd808","51f2730dde038caa3c8478c3304538becceef289","539e77a2291c8fb9419b0a3837808b04de71190e","ce0f4f9aa4bdbedf17912837446b71d457d2ce04","007cc46caa24c5ebd9b91d43beab041dbc707cf2","ff41a3a8dca5da66ce8273aa33391b8f89a6ebb8","88786f33914ca5ed5fb89e3fe2b2f45cb1ccdcb5","b5ca9b70f15b4a6c01cf2646fdef9493d9ed871c","bd57f1bcba89cf5e317f966f06e0dcdcae67b56c","2a37c6ac6612d5b42375e36ab626bc1ff36ac8a6","26f856ff36c95c78f06cc35098e13fc5f51377bd","39f89ea420c7cafb85d13e77651e473ba60307e3","cebdca401edbbe94b49c460041c5f159da35c6f8","afe81182d67c31e809b6394a9708bd7fbc5c826b","2ac3f3fe95b0dcefd26beed780e05225c513cfb9","1a06045fa935ad6ec9eceba29ff18abe262d8779","5d026227c49dbda6cd8d7be4d811579dba7ba8b8","aa770ae81bbdf9e9b4a54cc31a2f16dc141d92e1","795586ef71f4d5b0a917d425e5b7eb284a0aa5c5"],"pdfUrls":["https://www.math.uh.edu/~zpkilpat/research/wander12.pdf","http://www.math.uh.edu/~zpkilpat/research/kilpatrick_siads13.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1137/120877106","https://arxiv.org/pdf/1205.3072v1.pdf","http://www.math.uh.edu/~zpkilpat/research/wander12.pdf","https://www.math.uh.edu/~zpkilpat/research/kilpatrick_siads13.pdf","http://www.math.pitt.edu/~zpkilpat/research/wander12.pdf"],"title":"Wandering Bumps in Stochastic Neural Fields","doi":"10.1137/120877106","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1137/120877106","venue":"SIAM J.

We investigated the signaling cascade and function of these enzymes in cisplatin-induced apoptosis. Treatment of Jurkat T-cells with cisplatin induced cell death with DNA fragmentation and activation of caspase and JNK. Bcl-2 overexpression suppressed activation of both enzymes, whereas p35 and CrmA inhibited only the DEVDase (caspase-3-like) activity, indicating that the activation of these enzymes may be differentially regulated. Cisplatin induced apoptosis with the cytochrome c release and caspase-3 activation in both wild-type and caspase-8-deficient JB-6 cells, while the Fas antibody induced these apoptotic events only in wild-type cells. This indicates that caspase-8 activation is required for Fas-mediated apoptosis, but not cisplatin-induced cell death. On the other hand, cisplatin induced the JNK activation in both the wild-type and JB-6 cells, and the caspase-3 inhibitor Z-DEVD-fmk did not inhibit this activation. The JNK overexpression resulted in a higher JNK activity, AP-1 DNA binding activity, and metallothionein expression than the empty vector-transfected cells following cisplatin treatment. It also partially protected the cells from cisplatin-induced apoptosis by decreasing DEVDase activity. These data suggest that the cisplatin-induced apoptotic signal is initiated by the caspase-8-independent cytochrome c release, and the JNK activation protects cells from cisplatin-induced apoptosis via the metallothionein expression.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Signaling and function of caspase and c-Jun N-terminal kinase in cisplatin-induced apoptosis","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Very few quantitative papers exist. This motivated us to conduct a study that quantifies the actual effects of a potential decisiveness of IFRS for the national tax base -- without further questioning the usefulness of an IFRS relevance. Our paper extends existing research substantially. The research question of our paper deals with the measurement through simulation of differences in the discounted tax burden in various scenarios. Our sample comprises original data from 61 Austrian companies. The median of the difference between book values of IFRS single accounts and tax accounts for specific balance sheet items is determined. We then apply the result to the items of a typical corporate account derived from an Austrian database. As a result, depending on the term of items, we can calculate the discounted tax effects for different scenarios. It must be underlined that such highly confidential and detailed tax data is usually not available to researchers. The main preliminary finding of our empirical survey is that only in a few cases we find essential differences between IFRS and tax accounts. Our evidence suggests that no dramatic change in the tax base is to be expected. Our study provides not only new empirical evidence but also a basis for further research on a possible common consolidated corporate tax base from an academic perspective.","inCitations":["73cf631829f0ad8d75bbdf86f792f74781fda6e2","1dbe59333738c57e1bba22424c8e101cde45b0db","c866e94e6e1839056798fb93aa8b8eb69017fd8b","5c3cb6c07d18c64b44dfb3d92ef91a0fa733ffea","9cbcea6b76d7344b1643f0a6e0d9ac6e89c3076c","f61302622a15e7950236dc8a5556685f57eb4190","991fb95ac376a57b66496db694d42bd2b64ad35a","a969d8a8335cad34a9571a2166ef87ab109a3876","5f9562965dda8300dfacb68f201e94749cb9cb5f","a69703d83d0c41246d26e9f1d8fa6b8569940ce1","979c5cb90b6f58578069a3d2d7f30a21243c4325","78e4b0ab587b7017ba4dd1ea0fb61738e7407169","8556387864ccda3fb9afa294ef04a6108f6d1942","ec448197f0fd275c226883c41525fb7a35b8e2f3","f949d70ce609a9c0f25bbe4986f788adc0d5637f","5ac42fc2fb4bdd6022c36f3eba23b68996492271","40b278fd8a21b692a62d7f73e0ae174c9255bb35","4df5229f0211fbcc6524fadbfd44041e34aa47ea","524c8563701557212d05cb072d79305d3b66420a","3cfeebea570fbe325507f652d4b742c36bb7d3ab","3727915208f1aa7b19181ded13805d81c35e9ea4","9f1a2d85fb4836d13ab4359bb0fe7d66407804a4","50bf867d896b9511a20ce281444bf3f6436e54c6","154c45e20f8f9a75d375381cccd1415b87ab2e96","06bd700850c923b370c1746e1fc7d49288354b39","ebcc6e9acaa2a815ec75d6c1f4b83af914e0a0f3","96f7342a44dedc5138ba5c06d024cdacf15becb7","99f95bdcdbf2fbd4c27f95a339738c3308681156","21e4b4b0844e0f303b63bc29d30c1a5aee8d6756","95f5785b3fc52e0c25e70b857c93837ab27d2268"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"What if IFRS were a Tax Base?

The chemical and phase transformations have been investigated by ultraviolet–visible spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, high-angle annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscopy, and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. The results bring to the fore the presence of both silver nanoparticles in face-centered cubic and hexagonal crystalline phases during the photochromic transitions and a large amount of oxidized silver nanoparticles after visible light exposure, along with nucleation of some TiO2 crystals despite the very low intensity used.","inCitations":["3fee3c6dd02497e1988cb780e0539ebbce976c61","c472c40d23d97e4654dca3dd66ba256ec289b0b4","719887d15dd83c31cd1215a38615c0d092273da6","a2e980513ed2536768915eb3b6f5c2ee81846009","93f895d03e40830ea1cb776e4abb68fb86ab7b57"],"pdfUrls":["https://perso.univ-st-etienne.fr/destoucn/Publications/Crespo-Monteiro%202014%20J%20Phys%20Chem%20C.pdf"],"title":"Changes in the Chemical and Structural Properties of Nanocomposite Ag:TiO2 Films during Photochromic Transitions","doi":"10.1021/jp505702g","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1021/jp505702g","venue":""}

We retrospectively reviewed the clinical course, delay between diagnosis and first clinical manifestation, biological profiles, treatment and complications.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAll patients had vitreous inflammation; retinitis was seen upon examination in 82% of the cases. Nevertheless, for six patients (27% of the cases), failure to recognize the diagnosis led to delay (mean, 5.5 days) between the first ophthalmological examination and antiviral therapy. Nineteen patients underwent laboratory evaluation, and virological diagnosis was made in 16 of them: varicella zoster virus was found in 11 cases, herpes simplex type 1 in three cases, and herpes simplex type 2 and cytomegalovirus in one case each. Nine patients were treated with a combination of aciclovir and foscarnet and 13 with aciclovir alone. Among the 16 patients who received aciclovir, one did not respond to therapy after 2 days and was cured only after foscarnet was added. Recurrence occurred at the end of treatment in only one patient. Retinal detachment complicated the course for 11 patients and was always associated with proliferative vitreoretinopathy. Among those, seven of the ten patients who accepted surgery were successfully treated. Eleven out of 22 patients had a final visual acuity up to 20/200 and two up to 20/40.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nIn our series, acyclovir alone was sufficient to cure the majority of cases. Even with antiviral therapy, the prognosis of acute retinal necrosis remains poor. Retinal detachment is the main complication.","inCitations":["f02f39e2a47c41b81e47fcc453013cc940371d91","c3b01cea64d3a1941e2da978361b0e7c1471b603","69136243ea818d09695080fbd6ff9c4034794427"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"[Acute retinal necrosis: clinical presentation, treatment, and prognosis in a series of 22 patients].","doi":"","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"Journal francais d'ophtalmologie"}
