Training sessions were held 4 times a week for 5 weeks. The cr fitness improved significantly and skinfold thickness decreased following the aerobic, the pulse workout (interval training), and the anaerobic training compared to the control group. Skinfold thickness, plasma insulin, and triglyceride concentrations were significantly intercorrelated before and after training. The exercise programs had no significant effect on plasma cholesterol, triglycerides, phospholipids, glucose tolerance, or insulin levels. Change in adipose mass was thus dissociated from change in plasma insulin and triglyceride concentrations. It was concluded that in young men plasma triglycerides, the lipid component mostly readily reduced by exercise, were too low to be reduced further by a physical training program.","inCitations":["999477c5a3482cf06d8c9feedd8db01de28bc4eb","13cb09d09798446971391bb5590df90f269e7a3f","b60e25ac7075d655c77dae20b19d5d0ee80509c2"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Exercise effects on fitness, lipids, glucose tolerance and insulin levels in young adults.","doi":"","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"Archives of physical medicine and rehabilitation"}

Traditional perceptual learning protocols rely almost exclusively on long periods of uninterrupted fixation. Taking a first step towards understanding perceptual learning in natural vision, we had observers report the orientation of a briefly flashed stimulus (clockwise or counterclockwise from a reference orientation) presented strictly during saccade preparation at a location offset from the saccade target. For each observer, the saccade direction, stimulus location, and orientation remained the same throughout training. Subsequently, we assessed performance during fixation in three transfer sessions, either at the trained or at an untrained location, and either using an untrained (Experiment 1) or the trained (Experiment 2) stimulus orientation. We modeled the evolution of contrast thresholds (i.e., the stimulus contrast necessary to discriminate its orientation correctly 75% of the time) as an exponential learning curve, and quantified departures from this curve in transfer sessions using two new, complementary measures of transfer costs (i.e., performance decrements after the transition into the Transfer phase). We observed robust perceptual learning and associated transfer costs for untrained locations and orientations. We also assessed if spatial transfer costs were reduced for the remapped location of the pre‐saccadic stimulus—the location the stimulus would have had (but never had) after the saccade. Although the pattern of results at that location differed somewhat from that at the control location, we found no clear evidence for perceptual learning at remapped locations. Using novel, model‐based ways to assess learning and transfer costs, our results show that location and feature specificity, hallmarks of perceptual learning, subsist if the target stimulus is presented strictly during saccade preparation throughout training.","inCitations":["e4343f50a6112ab44e7de196de620dd376c2cb25","74b8506eff75015be437c0a4ba491780bf146f27","d35280127b3982be6122ecf427ed0ffe952e0b10","7acf4d19ca644c23f44ed37bc4cf23029ea52227","e1a252acdf63f61006c17fef2097b7d831a2786d"],"pdfUrls":["https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042698917302493","http://psych.nyu.edu/carrascolab/publications/RolfsMSmithCarrasco2018.pdf","http://psych.nyu.edu/carrascolab/publications/RolfsMurraySmithCarrasco_2018_VisRes.pdf","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042698917302493?dgcid=api_sd_search-api-endpoint","http://psych.nyu.edu/carrascolab/publications/RolfsMurraySmithCarrasco.pdf"],"title":"Perceptual learning while preparing saccades","doi":"10.1016/j.visres.2017.11.009","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.visres.2017.11.009","venue":"Vision Research"}

Taken alone, each leaves an incomplete picture and they are often at odds with one another. Any holistic understanding of reality must address both. Sociologist Arlie Russell Hochschild has sought to reconcile fact and feeling in her book, Strangers in Their Own Land: Anger and Mourning on the American Right. A self-defined liberal from Berkeley, California, Hochschild spent five years from 2011-2016 regularly traveling to Louisiana to conduct research and break out of her left-leaning bubble. Seeking out members of the newly formed Tea Party movement, Hochschild sought to gain a deeper understanding of those on the polar-opposite end of the political spectrum from herself. Her aims were twofold: scale the “empathy wall” and unravel “The Great Paradox.” Hochschild defines an empathy wall as, “ . . . an obstacle to deep understanding of another person . . . ”.1 This barrier compels us instead to “ . . . feel indifferent or even hostile to those who hold different beliefs or whose childhood is rooted in different circumstances.” These walls are not a new phenomenon and, as Hochschild notes, have appeared throughout periods of conflict in American history. Some resolutions have involved violence, like in the Civil War, while others, such as the civil rights movement, were resolved only when the American democracy demonstrated its ability to, “hash things out.” The Great Paradox is the mystery lying between fact and feeling.

However, despite the popularity of mHealth interventions, there is little documentation on how to use these data to monitor and improve programming or to evaluate impact.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nThis study aimed to better understand how users of the Mobile for Reproductive Health (m4RH) mHealth intervention engaged with the program in Tanzania from September 2013 to August 2016.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe conducted secondary data analysis of longitudinal data captured by system logs of participant interactions with the m4RH program from 127 districts in Tanzania from September 2013 to August 2016. Data cleaning and analysis was conducted using Stata 13. The data were examined for completeness and \"correctness.\" No missing data was imputed; respondents with missing or incorrect values were dropped from the analyses.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe total population for analysis included 3,673,702 queries among 409,768 unique visitors. New users represented roughly 11.15% (409,768/3,673,702) of all queries. Among all system queries for new users, 46.10% (188,904/409,768) users accessed the m4RH main menu. Among these users, 89.58% (169,218/188,904) accessed specific m4RH content on family planning, contraceptive methods, adolescent-specific and youth-specific information, and clinic locations after first accessing the m4RH main menu. The majority of these users (216,422/409,768, 52.82%) requested information on contraceptive methods; fewer users (23,236/409,768, 5.67%) requested information on clinic location. The conversion rate was highest during the first and second years of the program when nearly all users (11,246/11,470, 98.05%, and 33,551/34,830, 96.33%, respectively) who accessed m4RH continued on to query more specific content from the system. The rate of users that accessed m4RH and became active users declined slightly from 98.05% (11,246/11,470) in 2013 to 87.54% (56,696/64,765) in 2016. Overall, slightly more than one-third of all new users accessing m4RH sent queries at least once per month for 2 or more months, and 67.86% (278,088/409,768) of new and returning users requested information multiple times per month. Promotional periods were present for 15 of 36 months during the study period.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe analysis of the rich data captured provides a useful framework with which to measure the degree and nature of user engagement utilizing routine system-generated data. It also contributes to knowledge of how users engage with text messaging (short message service)-based health promotion interventions and demonstrates how data generated on user interactions could inform improvements to the design and delivery of a service, thereby enhancing its effectiveness.","inCitations":["979b6005c47e43176005a1bd1bd2e4c63747a2be"],"pdfUrls":["https://asset.jmir.pub/assets/79925c6d14eb9c67820a8bf5096ef083.pdf"],"title":"Insights From a Text Messaging–Based Sexual and Reproductive Health Information Program in Tanzania (m4RH): Retrospective Analysis","doi":"10.2196/10190","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.2196/10190","venue":"JMIR mHealth and uHealth"}

Quinol peroxidase is essential for the secretion of leukotoxin (LtxA), which destroys leukocytes and erythrocytes in humans and is one of the major virulence factors of Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, which is associated with localized aggressive periodontitis. In the present study, we aimed to find a highly potent QPO inhibitor to attenuate the virulence of A. actinomycetemcomitans.\n\n\nMATERIAL AND METHODS\nFor screening of QPO inhibitors, QPO activity was measured kinetically by SpectraMax Plus with 96-well UV plates. Three hundred compounds in the Kitasato Institute for Life Sciences Chemical Library were screened. Secretion of LtxA in the culture supernatant was examined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Cytotoxicity against human promyelocytic leukemia cell line (HL-60) cells from the culture supernatant was measured by Trypan Blue exclusion test.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe present study characterized ascofuranone as a highly potent inhibitor of QPO (K(i) = 9.557 +/- 0.865 nm). Ascofuranone inhibited secretion of LtxA by A. actinomycetemcomitans in a dose-dependent manner, making A. actinomycetemcomitans less pathogenic to HL-60 cells.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nQuinol peroxidase inhibitors are promising candidates as alternative drugs for the treatment and prevention of the onset of localized aggressive periodontitis. Using ascofuranone as a seed compound, further study of QPO inhibitors could provide novel chemotherapeutic strategies for controlling localized aggressive periodontitis.","inCitations":["f8669b31ce76fafaf751fa9c96fc3ea7a0a5427d","5fd2f5122566ba51905cd124dd4eef00922ea917"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"A quinol peroxidase inhibitor prevents secretion of a leukotoxin from Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans.","doi":"10.1111/j.1600-0765.2009.01211.x","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0765.2009.01211.x","venue":"Journal of periodontal research"}

The temperature coefficient of the pyranometer with respect to the electromotive force should be made equal to the temperature coefficient of the resistance of the circuit. A resistor with a semilinear temperature characteristic and a negative temperature coefficient can be constructed by connecting a N.T.C. (Negative Temperature Coefficient) resistor in parallel with a resistor of constant resistance. A complete calculation is carried out for a case where the pyranometer is a Moll-Gorczynski solarimeter and the instrument indicating the current is a potentiometer. It turns out that the temperature influence on the radiation measurement can be almost eliminated.ZusammenfassungEs wird gezeigt, daß der Strom eines Pyranometers durch Einbau eines Resistors von geeigneter Charakteristik in Serie mit dem Pyranometer temperaturunabhängig gemacht werden kann.

Because of the isolation and lack of preventive and timely health care, victim survivors of human trafficking require more elaborate, time consuming, and prolonged services. The delivery of such services is further challenged given that many have traveled long distances, are in a foreign country, speak little or no English, and have been captives under abusive control. 54 Additionally, victim survivors experience the compounded stress related to acculturation, adjusting or having to learn a new language, exposure to 49.

Infants are disproportionately represented. This study examines the clinical reasons infants attend UK Accident and Emergency departments.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA retrospective review of 6,667 infants aged less than one year attending Accident and Emergency at two district general hospitals in London from 1(st) April 2009 to 30(th) March 2010. All infants had been assigned to a diagnostic category by the medical coding department according to National Health Service (NHS) data guidelines, based on the clinical diagnoses stated in the medical records. The Accident and Emergency case notes of a random subsample of 10% of infants in each of the top five recorded diagnostic categories (n = 535) were reviewed in detail and audited against the standard national NHS data set.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe top 5 clinical diagnoses were 'infectious diseases', 'gastrointestinal', 'respiratory', 'unclassifiable' and 'no abnormality detected' (NAD). A third of infants were originally given a diagnosis of unclassifiable (21.5%) or NAD (11.5%). After detailed case-note review, we were able to reduce this to 9.7% (95% confidence interval (CI): 9.0, 10.4) and 8.8% (95% CI: 8.1, 9.5), respectively.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThis study demonstrates the importance of providing a clear clinical diagnosis and coding system for Accident and Emergency attendances and understanding that system fully. This would allow for better informed health service evaluation, planning and research as each of these relies on the interpretation of routine health-care data. Furthermore, the relatively high proportion (10%) of infants attending with no discernible underlying medical abnormality suggests the health needs of a significant proportion of infants attending Accident and Emergency departments may be better addressed by alternative service provision and/or improved education and support to parents.","inCitations":["d42e71aa13c53b284302d8e54b49c3ac906fd46b","eae7df10121059bd8a7cb73a9a99a81ba540579a","ce268c295b35df5ee1dec541ac9e738b103c2738","ba51b0852796d73b01f6d8b6131463a57a049800"],"pdfUrls":["http://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/1469501/1/Perspectives%20in%20Public%20Health-2014-Heys-93-100.pdf","https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/pmc/oa_pdf/08/f5/10.1177-1757913913514964.PMC4107802.pdf","https://www.safetylit.org/citations/ild_request_form.php?article_id=citjournalarticle_425450_13","http://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/pmc/08/f5/10.1177-1757913913514964.PMC4107802.pdf"],"title":"What do we really know about infants who attend Accident and Emergency departments?","doi":"10.1177/1757913913514964","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1177/1757913913514964","venue":"Perspectives in public health"}

By N a n c y L, Kea t i ng , M a r y B e t h L a n d r u m , J o h n Z, A y a n i a n , E r i c P. Wir ier , and Edward Guadagnoli (pp 4532-4539) purpose: Prior studies have documented variation in breast cancer treatment and care that does not follow guideline recommendations, particularly for elderly women. We assessed whether consultation with a medical oncologist before surgery was associated with use of definitive surgery, axillary node dissection, and type of surgery. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of a population-based sample of 9,630 women aged -> 66 years diagnosed with breast cancer during 1995 to 1996. We measured the adjusted proportion visiting a medical oncologist before surgery, identified factors associated with such visits, and assessed the association between visits with a medical oncologist and use of definitive surgery (mastectomy or breast-conserving surgery with radiation v breast-conserving surgery without radiation); axillary dissection; and breast-conserving surgery versus mastectomy among women undergoing definitive surgery. Results: Nineteen percent of women visited a medical oncologist before surgery; these women were younger, more often had larger or more poorly differentiated cancers, had more comorbid illnesses, and were treated more often at a teaching hospital (all P < .05). Women who saw a medical oncologist before surgery were more likely than others to undergo definitive surgery (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 1.28; 95% CI, 1.05 to 1.56) and axillary dissection (adjusted OR, 1.44; 95% CI, 1.19 to 1.73), but less likely to undergo breast-conserving surgery among women undergoing definitive surgery (OR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.75 to 0.95). Conclusion: Elderly women who consulted with a medical oncologist before surgery were more likely to receive guideline-recommended care. Additional research is needed allow a better understanding of the quality and content of discussions that elderly women have with various providers about breast-conserving surgery and mastectomy.

Ring, A. Webb, S. Ashley, W.H. Allure, S. Ebbs, G. Gul, N.P. Sacks, G. Walsh, and I.E. Smith (pp 4540-4545) Purpose: This retrospective analysis aimed to identify whether breast cancer patients receiving radiotherapy alone following a complete clinical remission (cCR) to neoadjuvant chemotherapy had a worse outcome than those treated with surgery. Patients and Methods: One hundred thirty-six patients who had achieved a cCR to neoadjuvant chemotherapy for early breast cancer were identified from a prospectively maintained database of 453 patients. Of these, 67 patients had undergone surgery as their primary locoregional therapy, and 69 patients had radiotherapy alone. Outcome was assessed in relation to local recurrence-free survival, disease-free survival, and overall survival. Results: Median follow-up was 63 months in the surgery group and 87 months in the no surgery group. Prognostic characteristics were well balanced between the two groups. For surgery and no surgery, respectively, there were no significant differences in disease-free survival or overall survival (5-year, 74% v 76%; 10-year, 60% v 70%, P = .9) between the two groups. There was a nonsignificant trend toward increased locoregional-only recurrence for the no surgery group (21% v 10% at 5 years; P = .09), but no long-term failures of local control. Patients in the no surgery group who also achieved an ultrasound complete remission had a 5-year local recurrence rate of only 8%. Conclusion: In patients achieving a cCR to neoadjuvant chemotherapy, radiotherapy alone achieve survival rates as good as with surgery, but with higher local recurrence rates. Ultrasound may identify a low recurrence rate subgroup for assessing no surgery in a prospective trial. J Clin Oncol 21:4145-4150. 9 2003 by American Society of Clinical Oncology. An Attenuated Adenovirus, ONYX-015, As Mouthwash Therapy for Premalignant Oral Dysplasia... By Charles M. Rudin, Ezra E.W. Cohen, Vassiliki A. Papadimitrakopoulou, Sol Silverman Jr, Wendy Recant, Adel K. EI-Naggar, Kirsten Stenson, Scott M. Lippman, Waun Ki/tong, and Everett E. Vokes (pp 4546-4552) Purpose: Dysplastic lesions of the oral epithelium are known precursors of oral cancer. A significant proportion of oral dysplastic lesions have functional defects in p53 response pathways. The ONYX-015 adenovirus is selectively cytotoxic to cells carrying defects in p53-dependent signaling pathways. The current study sought to establish the feasibility and activity of ONYX-015 administered topically as a mouthwash to patients with clinically apparent and histologically dysplastic lesions of the oral mucosa. Patients and Methods: A total of 22 patients (19 assessable patients) were enrolled onto the study. ONYX-015 was administered on three different schedules to consecutive cohorts. Biopsies of the involved mucosa were performed to evaluate histologic response and changes in expression of putative markers of malignant potential, including p53, cyclin DI, and Ki-67. Serology was performed to measure antiadenoviral titers. Results: Histologic resolution of dysplasia was seen in seven (37%) of 19 patients, and the grade of dysplasia improved in one additional patient. The majority of responses were transient. No toxicity greater than grade 2 (febrile episode in one patient) was observed. Only one of seven patients demonstrated an increase in circulating antiadenoviral antibody titer while on therapy. Although responding and resistant lesions had similar mean p53 staining at baseline, histologic response correlated with a decrease in p53 positivity over time. Significant changes in cyclin D1 or Ki-67 were not observed. Viral replication was confirmed in two of three lesions examined. Conclusion: This novel approach to cancer prevention is tolerable, feasible, and has demonstrable activity. J Clin Oncol 21:4546-4552. 9 2003 by American Society of Clinical Oncology. Interaction of Splenectomy and Perioperative Blood Transfusions on Prognosis of Patients With Proximal Gastric and Gastroesophageal Junction Cancer... By Jiirgen Weitz, Michael D'Angelica, Mithat Gonen, David Klimstra, Daniel G. Coit, Murray F. Brennan, and Martin S. Karpeh (pp 4597-4603) Purpose: To assess the interaction of splenectomy and perioperative allogeneic blood transfusions on the prognosis of patients undergoing a potentially curative resection of proximal gastric and gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) cancer, because reports from the transplantation literature demonstrated that the immunosuppressive effects of transfusions are dependent on the presence of an intact spleen. Patients and Methods: Between July 1, 1985, and July 30, 2001, 240 patients underwent complete resection (R0) of a proximal gastric or GEJ cancer (Siewert type II or III). Clinical and pathologic factors were collected in a prospective database. The survival data were modeled using the method of Kaplan and Meier and analyzed by the log-rank test and Cox regression. Results: The median follow-up of the patients was 25 months (40 months for survivors). The median relapse-free survival was 30 months, and the median disease-specific survival was 45 months. Univariate analysis suggested an interaction of splenectomy and perioperative transfusion in their effect on relapse-free survival. Patients who received a perioperative transfusion but did not undergo splenectomy demonstrated the worst prognosis on multivariate analysis independent of other prognostic factors. In patients who underwent splenectomy, perioperative transfusion had no effect on relapse-free survival on multivariate analysis. Conclusion: Our study suggests an interaction of blood transfusion and splenectomy in their effect on survival paralleling the findings in the transplantation literature. The adverse effect of allogeneic blood transfusion on prognosis in patients with gastric cancer seems to be associated with the presence of an intact spleen and is abrogated by its absence.

Surgery Plus Chemotherapy Compared With Surgery Alone for Localized Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Thoracic Esophagus: A Japan Clinical Oncology Group Study--JCOG9204.. . By Nobutoshi Ando, Toshifumi Iizuka, Hiroko Ide, Kaoru Ishida, Masayuki Shinoda, Tadashi Nishimaki, Wataru Takiyama, Hiroshi Watanabe, Kaichi Isono, Norio Aoyama, Hiroyasu Makuuchi, Otsuo Tanaka, Hideaki Yamana, Shunji Ikeuchi, Toshiyuki Kabuto, Kagami Nagai, Yutaka Shimada, Yoshihide Kinjo, and Haruhiko Fukuda (pp 4592-4596) Purpose: We performed a multicenter randomized controlled trial to determine whether postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy improves outcome in patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma undergoing radical surgery. Patients and Methods: Patients undergoing transthoracic esophagectomy with lymphadenectomy between July 1992 and January 1997 at 17 institutions were randomly assigned to receive surgery alone or surgery plus chemotherapy including two courses of cisplatin (80 mg/m 2 of body-surface area X 1 day) and fluorouracil (800 mg/m 2 X 5 days) within 2 months after surgery. Adaptive stratification factors were institution and lymph node status (pN0 versus pN1). The primary end point was disease-free survival. Results: Of the 242 patients, 122 were assigned to surgery alone, and 120 to surgery plus chemotherapy. In the surgery plus chemotherapy group, 91 patients (75%) received both full courses of chemotherapy; grade 3 or 4 hematologic or nonhematologie toxicities were limited.

The OR to have a serum level of monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP-1) lower than the 50th percentile of the distribution in statin-treated subjects compared to the statin untreated subjects is 0.669 (95% CI 0.193; 2.327), the OR for interleukin-8 (IL-8) = 0.818 (95% CI 0.236; 2.835), the OR for γ-interferon inducible protein-10 (IP-10) = 1.361 (95% CI 0.358; 5.175), and for interleukin-18 (IL-18) = 0.545 (95% CI 0.155; 1.914).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn relatively healthy, elderly subjects selected from a randomized general population sample, we did not observe differences in the serum levels of the selected set of proinflammatory chemokines in statin treated and untreated subjects with similar LDL-C level, suggesting that cholesterol reduction per se could be a main determinant of statin anti-inflammatory effects.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://www.advances.umed.wroc.pl/pdf/2014/23/5/723.pdf"],"title":"Serum Proinflammatory Chemokines in Healthy Elderly Taking or not Taking Simvastatin - Data from the Brisighella Heart Study.","doi":"10.17219/acem/37230","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.17219/acem%2F37230","venue":"Advances in clinical and experimental medicine : official organ Wroclaw Medical University"}

This involved 21 general practitioners (GPs) selected from a total of 102 in the District. Information was collected on mental health disorders detected by GPs among the attenders, the resultant volume of care provided by the GPs, the referrals made to secondary care and other agencies, and the types of care identified by the practitioners as appropriate for a patient but which are currently not accessible or available. We found that 45.9 per cent of all patients (17,319/37,733) registered with the 21 GPs were seen in three months. There was an overrepresentation of White and Black Caribbean patients and an under-representation of Bangladeshi, Chinese, Black African and Black Other patients in the study population. Mental health disorders were detected in 13.3 per cent (2304) of all attenders. The commonest problems were depression (17.7 per cent), acute stress reaction (15.5 per cent), anxiety (15.1 per cent), drug abuse (7.2 per cent), schizophrenia (5.8 per cent) and alcohol abuse (5.3 per cent). It was found that 37.3 per cent (860) of all attenders received medication, 66.5 per cent (1532) were counselled by the GPs and only 4.4 per cent (102) were referred to a psychiatrist; 16.3 per cent (375) of those with mental health disorders were identified by the GPs as having a service need which the District's psychiatric service could not meet.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","inCitations":["e163ec8d7fa12e2d00d4999ae22c5714eadeb1b7","47aa47c1381642455b2f9952807d902ab4bcb55a","dc03cf2e7b7c8cfc05f8c29ad5a920c675836894"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"The collection of general practice data for psychiatric service contracts.","doi":"10.1093/oxfordjournals.pubmed.a042940","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1093/oxfordjournals.pubmed.a042940","venue":"Journal of public health medicine"}

We propose adaptive write and read schemes for highly efficient STT-MRAM and MeRAM programming and sensing that optimally selects write and read pulses to overcome process and temperature variation. With adaptive write, the write latency of STT-MRAM and MeRAM cache are reduced by up to 17% and 59% respectively, and application run time is improved by up to 41%. With adaptive read, the sensing margin is dramatically improved by 1.4X while maintaining read disturbance correctable by error-correcting-code (ECC) correction. To further mitigate read disturbance impact on memory system, additional adaptive read scheme can dynamically lower read voltage according to the proposed monitor result. It can extend memory service time by haft to one year, and reduce read disturbance induced memory failure by 59% to 84%. To better support these schemes, we also propose, design, and evaluate low-cost MTJ-based variation monitor, which precisely senses process and temperature variation. The monitor is over 10X faster, 5X more energy-efficient, and 20X smaller compared with conventional thermal monitors of similar accuracy.","inCitations":["2cb723325bd5b37e3e6fa818c7064dd380d3f45e","16b07e7f6f33b24268c49f929cbc8b9db78837d5"],"pdfUrls":["http://nanowkvm.ee.ucla.edu/wp-content/papercite-data/pdf/j59.pdf"],"title":"Adaptive MRAM Write and Read with MTJ Variation Monitor","doi":"10.1109/TETC.2018.2866289","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TETC.2018.2866289","venue":""}

Thereafter gross industrial output decentralized. Specific industries, however, displayed different spatial patterns. Steel, for example, has become more concentrated, whereas chemical fertilizers and cement showed remarkably dispersed patterns. The patterns reflect a dual structure of industrial production comprised of large, modern, efficient plants and small, less efficient plants producing for local consumption.","inCitations":["3b22aac1dec314b2e64dcf5c02c5912b03f95376","4dd90be898ea36717a6073663956dfaa150143b7","0e1b3604b051b4b0dc37dce917eefae3dbd514be","276e10f9ca9572fe638fe81e5de3925ce916c808","68ec2e5e4a4a8d9d91eedbb7ccbf7dd9ec4ee7d4"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Regional Shifts in China's Industrial Output","doi":"10.1111/j.0033-0124.1988.00019.x","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.0033-0124.1988.00019.x","venue":""}

Thus, the highest share of the solar radiation to the surface of the PVs is essential. This paper presents a new control strategy to maximize the output energy of dual axis sun tracking. In this procedure, the optimal trajectory of the tracking system is determined based on a bounded optimization problem. The optimal tilt and azimuth angles of PV are calculated using swarm based optimization algorithms and an objective function that is suggested based on time dependent solar radiation prediction. This prediction uses the length of a sunbeam’s path through the atmosphere. The proposed approach is simulated by MATLAB software using Bee optimization algorithm and the results are compared with the Differential Evolution (DE), Genetic Algorithm (GA) and fixed panel results. The results show that the proposed method increases the electrical energy production within photovoltaic systems.","inCitations":["8af655bde4b7260e6ebff08e43b5afbb1300cb34"],"pdfUrls":["http://hrcak.srce.hr/file/249882"],"title":"Application of Swarm Based Optimization Algorithms to Maximize Output Energy of Photovoltaic Panels","doi":"10.17559/tv-20140714130812","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.17559/tv-20140714130812","venue":""}

In ice chromatography with salt-doped ice as the stationary phase, both solid and liquid phase can contribute to solute retention in different fashions; that is, the solid ice surface acts as an adsorbent, while a solute can be partitioned into the liquid phase. Thus, both adsorption and partition mechanisms can be utilized for ice chromatographic separation. An important feature in this approach is that the liquid phase volume can be varied by changing the temperature and the concentration of a salt incorporated into the ice stationary phase. Thus, we can control the relative contribution from the partition mechanism in the entire retention because the liquid phase volume can be estimated from the freezing depression curve. Separation selectivity can thereby be modified. The applicability of this concept has been confirmed for the solutes of different adsorption and partition abilities. The predicted retention based on thermodynamics basically agrees well with the corresponding experimental retention. However, one important inconsistency has been found. The calculation predicts a step-like discontinuity of the solute retention at t(eu) because the phase diagram suggests that the liquid phase abruptly appears at t(eu) when the temperature increases. In contrast, the corresponding experimental plots are continuous over the wider range including the subeutectic temperatures. This discrepancy is explained by the existence of the liquid phase below t(eu). A difference between predicted and measured retention factors allows the estimation of the volume of the subeutectic liquid phase.","inCitations":["7dbf025d08882f5a4f55922fa117bd2b4bc5a30a","3db87df675c102bfa08a556dd6812d957710834a","299135b22f13a6ddc6248240fb8812b647abf6ae"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Control of ice chromatographic retention mechanism by changing temperature and dopant concentration.","doi":"10.1021/ac202378m","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1021/ac202378m","venue":"Analytical chemistry"}

In the first region, the convection dominates, and in the second region the local acceleration dominates. Along the surface dividing these two regions, there is a sudden change in the phase of longitudinal force spectrum relative to the phase spectrums of the longitudinal local acceleration, longitudinal convection acceleration and number density. It is shown that this sudden change in the phase implies that the correlated part of longitudinal force spectrum is zero along the above surface. The computed averaged magnitude force spectrum along this surface is locally minimum — but nonzero — because it contains an uncorrelated part that cannot be removed by averaging. Thus, along the above surface the convection and local acceleration densities balance each other, and the particle dynamics is similar to that of a free particle subjected to an uncorrelated ‘random’ force.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Convection and local acceleration dominated regimes in Lennard–Jones liquids","doi":"10.1016/S0375-9601(99)00905-6","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/S0375-9601%2899%2900905-6","venue":""}

(2014). Healthy eating behaviour on children and the role of family modelling. J. Hum. Sport Exerc., 9(Proc1), pp.S300-S310. Most people’s food and eating decisions are embedded in family food and eating subsystems and/or intimately connected to significant others. Our study aimed to evaluate the food behaviour in children aged 11, 13 and 15 years old in relation to the family models. Our study was conducted in order to evaluate the eating behaviour on children in relation to the family modelling. This study included children aged 11, 13 and 15 years old from Tirana (capital of Albania), of 5, 7, respectively 9 grade, both from the urban and rural environment. A total of 240 students were included in the study, as follows: 120 students from rural areas (40 students 11 years old, 40 students 13 years old, 40 students 15 years old), and from urban areas the same number. The data collection was done using an anonymous tool based on the questionnaire used for the HBSC (Health Behaviour in School-aged Children). As we know, it is very important to eat together as a family because healthy eating habits are formed by dining at home together. It is good that at least breakfast and dinner should be reserved to the whole family. A quite important percentage of students do not take breakfast in the family ever and this percentage increases by age. The study showed a prevalence of subjects from urban areas and a slight domination of girls. Most of the children have daily dinners with parents, even the proportion decreases by increasing age. More extended research is needed to confirm the situation at national level and to understand its causes. These should be followed by specific interventions aiming to raise awareness of the parents about their major role in influencing the children and in creating the basic premises for a healthy lifestyle in their adult life.

The level of handover standardisation may vary across departments and hospitals, and handover may be affected by the context in which it occurs. If during handover communication doctors do not transfer information pertinent to a patient's care delivery, it may lead to unintended negative consequences.An explanatory, mixed-methods study, using the principles of critical realism was conducted to investigate whether or not similar barriers to effective shift handover communication between doctors identified in hospitals around the world are identified by doctors working in hospitals in the Czech Republic and to develop hypotheses regarding how various individual performance-, work environment- and system-related factors may collectively contribute to ineffective shift handover communication between doctors. In accordance with the principles of critical realism the study included theory-testing phases: (i) a critical review of literature; (ii) a cross-sectional questionnaire survey; and (iii) semi-structured interviews with doctors.The results of the study show that doctors working in hospitals in the Czech Republic identify similar barriers to effective shift handover communication between doctors identified in hospitals around the world. However, handover between the Czech Republic doctors has its own specific characteristics. The inadequacies of the social, systemic and environmental features that make up different contexts in which handover is conducted collectively contribute to ineffective shift handover communication. For example, a systemic feature (e.g. the absence of training), may lead to specific doctors' beliefs (e.g. handover is meaningless), which in turn trigger certainbehaviours (e.g. doctors go home without communicating either verbally or in writing the work carried out during the previous shift), that tend towards a particular kind of outcome (e.g. the absence of handover). Consequently, the division of barriers to handover into one-dimensional categories such as 'the individual performance', 'the system' or 'the social environment', has emerged as superficial as it does not adequately reflect the reality of the context and process of handover communication. Any interventions and programmes, which aim to enhance communication between doctors at shift handover, may need therefore to address the multidimensional nature of handover communication.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://shura.shu.ac.uk/20750/1/10702849.pdf"],"title":"Barriers to effective communication between doctors at shift handover","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

These cells possess the ability to adapt to a multitude of abruptly changing and complex environments. Furthermore, different populations of resident tissue macrophages each show their own defining gene signatures. The enhancer repertoire of these cells underlies both the cellular identity of a given subset of resident macrophage population and their ability to dynamically alter, in an efficient manner, their gene expression programs in response to internal and external signals. Notably, transcription is pervasive at active enhancers and enhancer RNAs, or eRNAs, are tightly correlated to regulated transcription of protein-coding genes. Furthermore, selection and establishment of enhancers is a dynamic and plastic process in which activation of intracellular signaling pathways by factors present in a macrophage's environment play a determining role. Here, we review recent studies providing insights into the distinct mechanisms that contribute to the selection and function of enhancers in macrophages and the relevance of studying these mechanisms to gain a better understanding of complex human diseases.","inCitations":["1792453506d65e60288b77c373ecfee9a5d65a6e","367c225a7747a3fd6e1ad4ceea9f7f60b9d0fca4","f9235e2351d279a480a3e509e54a936512779f97","63283e1e9c6a5db79066cb2e65f67669fde98146","2adac99ad303ff01aa9be26580e8390a43ffd032","768283b02773297bf5dd238919bd59b20e12e1ca","8ea380c053c03f3421025fc46332cc09155dd803","cc93b2c91ad68ba388f4867192407da6656bfd6f","2b9add646ee41dd67f9d7110fa9cb9bffa118b7a","9aa1d228f6e447a391b8d111d01d07e575940375","9778197c8b8a4a1c297edb180b63f4a29f612895","1881905e2fb2e4f6636e912b9ae3489a4fae7bb8","569dfc39dac4ca8bd00dd08bf6a67cd1030e3349"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Mechanisms Underlying the Selection and Function of Macrophage-Specific Enhancers.","doi":"10.1101/sqb.2015.80.027367","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1101/sqb.2015.80.027367","venue":"Cold Spring Harbor symposia on quantitative biology"}

Sevoflurane was administered to all patients after intubation.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThe neuromuscular block was monitored with acceleromyography using train-of-four (TOF) stimuli. Patients received additional doses of rocuronium to maintain a deep block during surgery. If profound neuromuscular block (TOF, 0) persisted at the end of the surgery, 3mg/kg sugammadex was administered.\n\n\nMEASUREMENTS\nThe demographic data, surgeries, and anesthetic agents were recorded. The time from sugammadex administration to recovery of neuromuscular function (TOF ratio, >0.9) and complications during and after extubation were also recorded.\n\n\nMAIN RESULTS\nTwenty-six infants who had a deep neuromuscular block (TOF, 0) at the end of surgery received 3 mg/kg sugammadex. The mean recovery time of the T4/T1 ratio of 0.9 was 112 seconds.

Previous laws were established to protect property owners. Environmental regulations were designed to prevent the erosion of unique ecosystems in the USA. The legal ability to use such power has allowed the DHS secretary to effectively strip economically poor and politically powerless citizens of their personal property and to force wildlife refuges to surrender their holdings in order to build the fence. Design/methodology/approach - The author explains what this all means in terms of political power using primarily the work of Herbert Marcuse on power and repression and Michel Foucault and his concepts of heterotopias, and emplacement. Findings - The idea is to provide the means and build upon Marcuse's and Foucault's works to better understand and build public administration theory. Originality/value - The value of this work is constituted in an exploration of a largely neglected border region and the impact upon people subjugated and oppressed by the State and its overall implications for governance and humanity.","inCitations":["38503d6f5bca1dd2ce9571d5fb99a8d6e1c3a3bd"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Colonization in South Texas: fences, heterotopias and emplacements","doi":"10.1108/03068291211264122","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1108/03068291211264122","venue":""}

In moving cells, dynamic and coordinate disassembly and reassembly of stress fibers and focal adhesions are observed, but the precise mechanisms in the regulation of these processes are poorly understood. We previously showed that 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) first induced disassembly of stress fibers and focal adhesions followed by their reassembly in MDCK cells. The reassembled stress fibers showed radial-like morphology that was apparently different from the original. We analyzed here the mechanisms of these TPA-induced processes. Rho inactivation and activation were necessary for the TPA-induced disassembly and reassembly, respectively, of stress fibers and focal adhesions. Both inactivation and activation of the Rac subfamily of the Rho family (Rac) inhibited the TPA-induced reassembly of stress fibers and focal adhesions but not their TPA-induced disassembly. Moreover, microinjection or transient expression of Rab GDI, a regulator of all the Rab small G protein family members, inhibited the TPA-induced reassembly of stress fibers and focal adhesions but not their TPA-induced disassembly, indicating that, furthermore, activation of some Rab family members is necessary for their TPA-induced reassembly. Of the Rab family members, at least Rab5 activation was necessary for the TPA-induced reassembly of stress fibers and focal adhesions. The TPA-induced, small G protein-mediated reorganization of stress fibers and focal adhesions was closely related to the TPA-induced cell motility. These results indicate that the Rho and Rab family members coordinately regulate the TPA-induced reorganization of stress fibers and focal adhesions that may cause cell motility.","inCitations":["e0e369fe9a5c16f4d0e22487a39b0d3ee697c394","af10604e2689e213fbfc18e5ff8033db106715fc","01c6a71e15bded2c37c053d14f1cdaecefd6f602","be6b346d6f48ab18d02f20eda27740de8fa10218","001a8f12cefc0afe05a2599491603ce89185b51c","3c6869f8e70daa0132a0bd4f812440e5c914a04f","5b49bf91725bca6c2ddea04f8b1e0c04adfae4d7","52389620ce1c3f0c370f4373ce263571a6b48018","ab008b014af9a346fc15670d23c9f6a194013a78","176ec52cde05173b2c2040b1dc6d1ffeb7471d58","79c168c96d850a8e6a1e52f0767ff75401d1f137","bfa1a7e6e72fcd8b16c8a5b4256c099b4d35776e","951f66d7f118b0fd0b7c344343e9a019272736e0","923e47df857cd46d5e651d6508399b70ac500ab2","07d76f0b5ac2cdbb5236b76fc7bfe89bbdf7656d","b8ff8e2cd1ab1425f7028abb3598e580c7a1c42f","6d4945d4446908dff93157b2a970730e2450f9b7"],"pdfUrls":["https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC25527/pdf/mk002561.pdf","http://www.molbiolcell.org/content/9/9/2561.full.pdf","https://ir.library.osaka-u.ac.jp/repo/ouka/all/3341/14787_%E8%A6%81%E6%97%A8.pdf"],"title":"Rho and Rab small G proteins coordinately reorganize stress fibers and focal adhesions in MDCK cells.","doi":"10.1091/mbc.9.9.2561","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1091/mbc.9.9.2561","venue":"Molecular biology of the cell"}

Some of these economies are based on natural resources and mainly oil and gas that are major sources of economic rents. The attained results from all the sample of Arab countries, show how knowledge variables are negatively related to the rents from natural resources. Natural resources appear thus as a curse to the expansion of knowledge economy in the overall set of countries. But, when taken country by country as in the literature, natural resources as blessing are shown over some economies. Transformation of curse to a sustainable blessings is the promising economic and social direction of change that could increase further inclusive growth in the Arab economies.","inCitations":["353d91e64b9d5049da12bc54ab681cd2a6fb9a3d","d564123fe4d21d47a107c3d52c45a8840950bf6d","0029f3b76fc9c284d2eabba97b9e49dd081a2a59"],"pdfUrls":["https://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/58598/1/MPRA_paper_58598.pdf"],"title":"Testing of Natural Resources as Blessing or Curse to the Knowledge Economy in Arab Countries","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Cultured rat hepatocytes were incubated in anoxic 47 Krebs-Ringer-HEPES buffer (KRH) at pH 6.2 for 4 h and then reoxygenated at pH 7.4 to 48 simulate ischemia/reperfusion. Some cells were loaded with the Ca chelators, 49 BAPTA/AM and Quin 2/AM, either by a cold loading protocol for intramitochondrial 50 loading or by warm incubation for cytosolic loading. Cell death was assessed by 51 propidium iodide fluorometry and immunoblotting. Mitochondrial Ca, inner membrane 52 permeability, membrane potential and ROS formation were monitored with Rhod-2, 53 calcein, tetramethylrhodamine methylester and dihydrodichlorofluorescein, respectively. 54 Necrotic cell death increased after reoxygenation. Necrosis was blocked by 1 μM 55 cyclosporin A, an MPT inhibitor, and by reoxygenation at pH 6.2. Confocal imaging of 56 Rhod-2, calcein and dichlorofluorescein revealed that an increase of mitochondrial Ca 57 and ROS preceded onset of the MPT after reoxygenation. Intramitochondrial Ca 58 chelation, but not cytosolic Ca chelation, prevented ROS formation and subsequent 59 necrotic and apoptotic cell death. Reoxygenation with the antioxidants, desferal or 60 diphenylphenylenediamine, also suppressed MPT-mediated cell death.

The variations correlate with changes in the depositional environments of ancient Lake Uinta. Four individual, but gradational, environments of deposition are recognized in the Parachute Creek Member: (1) deltaic lacustrine; (2) carbonate flat; (3) proximal open lacustrine; and (4) distal open lacustrine. Rocks from these depositional facies range from sandstone and algal limestone in the first two marginal-lacustrine environments to oil shale, tuff, and saline-mineral beds in the latter two open-lacustrine environments. Detrital quartz, K-feldspar, and Na-plagioclase are most abundant in channel-form sandstone beds in the deltaic-lacustrine facies. In the open-lacustrine facies where oil shale is dominant, these silicates are still abundant but are authigenic or diagenetic in origin. Analcime is found in fine-grained rocks in all environments but is least abundant in oil shale of the distal open-lacustrine environment where saline minerals such as nahcolite and halite are present. Calcite, dolomite, and ankerite show the most complex facies distribution. Calcite is apparently most abundant in the finegrained calcareous rocks intercalated with sandstone and algal limestone in the marginal-lacustrine facies, and it is least abundant in the distal oil shale. Dolomite is abundant throughout the Parachute Creek Member but is most abundant in the distal oil shale. Ankerite is also most abundant in the distal oil shale but is rare in marginal-lacustrine rocks. The overall zonation of the carbonate suggests that the more chemically complex types are found in the more basinward environments. Thus, the pattern for the carbonate distribution is a reflection of local biogeochemical and geochemical conditions and not the result of transportation of carbonate phases from a fringing mud-flat (playa fringe) environment.","inCitations":["57f2971d09556b5ee1840db79ed0a54cee7405f5","cb581c1586915335f26460bc80a045f337479695","480e95a9ca55349f9d67cbf4ee0b97c70fca53c3","6f3189dc2f6ade6eb7edb811d772cbbc1fe70f76","c2a5c99e8e283b0925f3c35b271bec075b8be111","8534b326ec6b6082c70c99ef16ff361d5289a60d","1d8d4824ea55b53ec511aaf8ec4840ce76d6dcb3","de16e0d54403f30bddf833b4de26bead6bcfeeba","beca3805a7bed5bdb5f5b06bf302b605cb27a109","f1448b6015e6f2d91686d5e1f9a34a3523a8e9ed","3fa1911369b66c863898cbe1abfe9dd65b2b4fa0","f4496e92e81aa3c1d1f4cba5ae756c428e0e91d6","89795b07b298519bf9040440bd5fd5256ace3eec","087eb5aab3eeaa88cb04d19e1a5edbb897e16c63","21566ef3667eb34918545b26e7b4be24190fd9c5","f865fe255a53ff78118861acab4370023d5d0994"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Comparative mineralogy of nearshore and offshore lacustrine lithofacies, Parachute Creek Member of the Green River Formation, Piceance Creek Basin, Colorado, and eastern Uinta Basin, Utah","doi":"10.1130/0016-7606(1978)89<1441:CMONAO>2.0.CO;2","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1130/0016-7606%281978%2989%3C1441%3ACMONAO%3E2.0.CO%3B2","venue":""}

This approach makes assumptions about the baseline level of emotionality in animals without actual objective measurements. It also ignores that genetic factors and experimental manipulations can reduce or prolong fear and anxiety from novelty, hence affecting the acquisition of a memory task. In the present study, C57, CD-1 and Balb/c mice were introduced to a working memory task in a radial-arm maze without habituation. Fear-induced anxiety from exposure to the novelty in this maze is demonstrated by a very low number of arm entries. Animals have to climb onto a bridge in order to reach an arm of the maze. In the first session block, Bab/c mice made very few arm entries and made more arm repeats than CD-1 and C57 mice, and CD-1 made few arm entries and made more arm repeats than C57/BL6J mice. In the second session block, all three strains of mice did make 8 arm entries. Balb/c mice seem to perform better than C57 and CD-1 mice as shown by a low number of arm repeats in the second session block, a high number of correct choices before first errors in the third session block, and low number of errors and sessions to criterion. In the present case, a high baseline level of emotionality did not prevent Balb/c mice to perform better than C57 and CD-1 mice.","inCitations":["0b748270884a04d6bc3ae1fc36ff85f709e26edd","b0d6515aba947dc40d10f5be15dd45386a9f605d","dbfcc74bbc284233e2e602e166e82c5db299e1cf","de53c161f651447bdc48023a719c9bb3a5981567","84bc0507ed3a07f551dd6c576494e8c762767c55","ed5c2600d335de7c3f57d18ab898a4031230b57f","87effec69b3cbba8400fe4c362a479e6384a145c"],"pdfUrls":["https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166432811003457","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166432811003457?dgcid=api_sd_search-api-endpoint"],"title":"Omission of the habituation procedure in the acquisition of a working memory task – evidence from Balb/c, C57/BL6J, and CD-1 mice","doi":"10.1016/j.bbr.2011.04.035","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbr.2011.04.035","venue":"Behavioural Brain Research"}

METHODS: study of cases involving four male subjects with surgically repaired post-foramen cleft. Acoustic analysis concerning sustained emission of vowel [a] was accomplished in modal register and vocal fry, through the programs Multi Dimensional Voice Program (glottic source analysis) and Real-Time Spectrogram (spectrographic analysis), both by Kay Elemetrics Corp. RESULTS: through the vocal fry spectrography analysis we perceived: decrease of definition, intensity and definition band spectrography in some formants, decrease of intensity as for the entire spectrum, and a slight decrease of noise in high frequencies; damping effect showed slight increase. Through the glottic source analysis in vocal fry, we perceived: fundamental frequency in the modal speech register zone and it was higher when compared to the emission for comparison in the modal register; large increase in the measures that show variation of frequency and amplitude; most of the jitter and shimmer measures were significantly increased; increased measures of noise, voice break, unvoiced segment and vocal tremor; and soft phonation index (SPI) significantly decreased. CONCLUSIONS: the findings evidence the high instability and the emission noise in fry register, as well as its weak intensity and diminished transglottic air flow.","inCitations":["b2a1c20177319bcd6f469c3356261c9bc4d0d00e","3d091224d11be7c9455b8fd8bb9d9320af33d8fd","637094741aab3ad224c02a4fb1a9edb5e89a629a","54d11d927e0820885908490e455cf22eed0b438b"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Características vocais acústicas do som basal em homens com fissura pós-forame reparada","doi":"10.1590/S1516-18462010005000002","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1590/S1516-18462010005000002","venue":""}

Then according to the parameters, we apply the FrFT to compress the raw data on azimuth direction, or repositioning and focusing the moving target in the original SAR image. The proposed approaches take the full advantage of the excellent antinoise ability of the FrFT and ideal clutter cancellation of DPCA technique, and an exact SAR-GMTI image can be acquired in a clutter-rich and low SNR environment.

During oncogenesis, FASN plays a role in growth and survival rather than acting within the energy storage pathways. Here, the function of FASN during early embryonic development was studied using its specific inhibitor, C75. We found that the presence of the inhibitor reduced blastocyst hatching. FASN inhibition decreased Cpt1 expression, leading to a reduction in mitochondria numbers and ATP content. This inhibition of FASN resulted in the down-regulation of the AKT pathway, thereby triggering apoptosis through the activation of the p53 pathway. Activation of the apoptotic pathway also leads to increased accumulation of reactive oxygen species and autophagy. In addition, the FASN inhibitor impaired cell proliferation, a parameter of blastocyst quality for outgrowth. The level of OCT4, an important factor in embryonic development, decreased after treatment with the FASN inhibitor. These results show that FASN exerts an effect on early embryonic development by regulating both fatty acid oxidation and the AKT pathway in pigs.","inCitations":["d34e37e22be6de229dbd474f54cbb029a3ff0d2d","8f915ab14f504abc6311cf928d3100578e9ae7cc","c608770a46d47775f251a3e2806fcccc1d56f0ba","906deccd0539eb3082ddcb2ff245dea90a9031f6"],"pdfUrls":["https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0170624&type=printable"],"title":"Inhibition of Fatty Acid Synthase Reduces Blastocyst Hatching through Regulation of the AKT Pathway in Pigs","doi":"10.1371/journal.pone.0170624","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0170624","venue":"PloS one"}

Isso ocorre devido a diversidade geografica e climatica, principalmente nas regioes acima de 900 metros de altitude, que se caracterizam como locais com condicoes microclimaticas favoraveis para setor vinifero, favorecendo o ciclo fenologico e diferenciando a qualidade da uva. Este trabalho tem por objetivo caracterizar os vinhos Merlot e Cabernet Sauvignon obtidos em diferentes safras no municipio de Campo Belo do Sul-SC, durante o ciclo fenologico 2016\\2017 e 2017\\2018. Foram realizadas as seguintes analises nos vinhos: teor de polifenois totais, atividade antioxidante, antocianinas monomericas totais, cor e resveratrol. Os dados obtidos foram submetidos a analise de variância e comparacao de medias pelo teste de Tukey (p≤0,05). Os vinhos em estudo apresentaram os parâmetros enologicos classicos adequados conforme a Legislacao Brasileira. Os vinhos Cabernet Sauvignon apresentaram caracteristicas quimicas diferenciadas de acordo com a safra, destacando os vinhos da safra 2017, onde foi observado baixo teor de antocianinas quando comparado com a variedade Merlot da mesma safra. Os vinhos Merlot da safra 2017 apresentaram menor teor de polifenois totais e antocianinas, sendo assim apresentou uma maior polimerizacao destes compostos, o que provavelmente contribuiu para menor intensidade e medicao de cor vermelha dos vinhos. Os vinhos Cabernet Sauvignon da safra 2018 apresentaram maiores concentracoes de polifenois totais e de Antocianinas, assim diferindo significativamente (p<0,05) da variedade Merlot desta safra. Atividade antioxidante de vinhos Cabernet Sauvignon e Merlot variou nas diferentes safras. O resveratrol apresentou dados significativos nos vinhos Merlot e Cabernet Sauvignon das safras 2017 e 2018. Este trabalho observou a influencia dos compostos fenolicos, capacidade antioxidante, medida de cor em diferentes safras presente nos vinhos cultivados e produzidos no estado de Santa Catarina.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Caracterização dos vinhos Merlot e Cabernet sauvignon produzidos no Planalto Serrano de Santa Catarina","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

A data warehouse is a system that extracts, cleans and delivers source data into dimensional data store and then supports and implements querying and analysis for the purpose of decision making. From a data warehouse, data flows to various departments for their customized decision support systems. These individual departmental components are called data marts. A data mart is a set of dimensional tables supporting a business process. Data marts contain all atomic detail needed to support drilling down to the lowest level. Every company or organization in the world has a website. Beneath each web site are web logs that record every object either posted to or served from the web server. Web logs are important because they reveal the user traffic on the web site. The activity of parsing web logs and storing the results in a data mart to analyze customer activity is known as click stream data warehousing. The web mart - database schema is designed to make the underlying data structure more comprehensible to users and to simplify the query process. The recommended approach for data warehouse data modeling is to follow a Dimensional Modeling approach - Star Schema. We explore the design and analysis of web mart and its relevance today at minute level.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"A Study on Design and Analysis of Web Mart Mining and Its Relevance Today","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Predicted PEFR which depends on age & height of patient is calculated by referring to Wright's scale. In 1st & 2nd trimester the lung functions are relatively normal, while in 3rd trimester the pulmonary function gets compromised with decrease in PEFR, PEFR is not affected by parity and in all modes of delivery it is significantly low, more after caesarean section ( post operative pain might be responsible) and by the end of one month after delivery, the lung functions return back to normal.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"A study on Variations of pulmonary function tests in different stages of pregnancy","doi":"10.21276/apjhs.2016.3.3.7","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.21276/apjhs.2016.3.3.7","venue":""}
