This research investigated the effectiveness of online eBooks on eight grade 1 students’ reading motivation. Eight students were given ten 25-minute sessions with the software programs over 15 weeks. Qualitative data were collected from students, teachers, and parents through questionnaires, interviews, observations and field notes. The results suggest the promise of online reading software programs in supporting early readers with reading, motivation, and/or behavioural difficulties. \n \nLa motivation des lecteurs debutants et les textes qu’ils choisissent de lire ont un impact sur leur succes en litteratie et sur leur volonte de prendre part a des activites de lecture au cours des annees du primaire.

Cell fusion experiments have suggested that the extinction of MHC class II expression in plasma cells is due to a dominant repression, but the underlying mechanisms are not understood. CIITA was recently identified as an MHC class II transactivator that is essential for MHC class II expression in B lymphocytes. We show here that inactivation of MHC class II genes in plasmocytes is associated with silencing of the CIITA gene. Moreover, experimentally induced expression of CIITA in plasmocytes leads to reexpression of MHC class II molecules to the same level as that observed on B lymphocytes. We therefore conclude that the loss of MHC class II expression observed upon terminal differentiation of B lymphocytes into plasmocytes results from silencing of the transactivator gene CIITA.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Developmental Ex~nction of Major Histocompatibility Complex Class II Gene Expression in Plasmocytes Is Mediated by Silencing of the Transactivator Gene CHTA","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

The objective of this study was to examine the association between dietary GI, GL, and CVD risk factors among Tehranian adults, the participants of the Tehran Lipid and Glucose Study.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThis population- based cross-sectional study was conducted on 2457 subjects (46% men and 54% women), aged 19 to 84 years. Dietary GI and GL were measured using a validated 168- item semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire. Anthropometrics, blood pressure, fasting blood glucose, and lipid profiles were measured.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe mean intakes of GI and GL were 68.3 and 244.8, respectively. Rice (26.6%) and bread (19.0%) were the major contributors to dietary GI and GL, respectively. Higher dietary GI and GL were associated with high intakes of carbohydrate, fiber, refined grain, fruits, simple sugar, snack, and desserts. After adjustment for lifestyle and dietary variables, a higher dietary GI was positively associated with triglycerides and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol concentrations among obese subjects. Dietary GL was positively associated with fasting and 2-h blood glucose among nonobese subjects, after adjustment for confounders.  \n\n\nCONCLUSION\nDietary GI and GL were associated with a few CVD risk factors, and body mass index levels may modulate these associations.","inCitations":["9da58a17ffa0a2bd71c1b585aed203c9db4ed816","3f379470bbd41c022ae7299865bb4b4b8f8bb3ce","df68cc5abbf79cf4d2cc36946bea49807db0b01f","c5f4a65951a7a9dca9be19c11ef20ec5cdb41872","d2c7f928b038e63d7efd640f401b973220942a18","13e7b1d9fb9c50c6d4da37abb472e0f3d2c59b2f","755f072e41a6d14998763af0f9c01cee9f7bd9d3","eb4200a424d69ad65bf160a3f4c3ca766827ca68","cc576380609b65f9d3afc5a506d06aefbb77b292","0aa4728e8e3196acb123a7016b55e715fbcc24ac","fc491e15071aa56aecf839f48791c5229af63896","78477819e4f6a06482e614cc5e5fcfdc7b9ca311","0bb8a1aa21031b96ed701d1c20691b5a3dc945c4","c316a218b0d964559d97bfcc23333ce23165c3e4","e80f2ca1fc8636e39c7409f299c4275c559404e8"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.aimjournal.ir/pdffiles/39_july013_008.pdf","http://www.aimjournal.ir/pdffiles/39_july2013_008.pdf"],"title":"Dietary glycemic index, glycemic load, and cardiovascular disease risk factors: Tehran Lipid and Glucose Study.","doi":"","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"Archives of Iranian medicine"}

During a mean follow-up of 19 +/- 11 months, accessory pathway conduction resumed in 21 (10%) of 217 patients following an initially successful ablation and in 6 (86%) of 7 patients with late block of accessory pathway conduction (P < 0.01). After initially successful ablations, the recurrence rates of accessory pathway conduction at 1, 3, and 6 months were 5.9%, 7.4%, and 11.3%, respectively. A late electrophysiologic study at 6 months uncovered recurrence in only 1 of 124 asymptomatic patients, but failed to detect the late recurrence in 2 patients in whom the accessory pathway conduction resumed after more than 6 months. Multivariate analysis revealed that independent predictors for recurrence of accessory pathway conduction were concealed accessory pathway, presence of transient effect of radiofrequency pulse, and more than 5 pulses required for initial cure. Accessory pathway location, length of the tip electrode of the ablation catheter, and repeat radiofrequency pulses (\"safety pulses\") after effective pulses did not predict resumption of accessory pathway conduction.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAfter initially successful ablation, the recurrence rates of accessory pathway conduction at 1, 3, and 6 months were 5.9%, 7.4%, and 11.3%, respectively. Late electrophysiologic testing had little prognostic value in asymptomatic patients following successful ablation. Application of \"safety pulses\" did not prevent recurrence. Late block of accessory pathway conduction did not predict long-term efficacy.","inCitations":["1a7a28da823d28527709f781dbe94684b27a8b38","266b5968501723c6d3a4267b06795cc8225c974a","39e7f959660693be2e6d4d22198e237bf3a9f30d","1127d2f63845a8f6a0d5ee0915cc1d61220364cb","f654d50a3044393bb0ea86ba60cf68cf9af711aa","4b19bc020fdd07952e6a0b3aaeba241875d45623","c980e40876af2fde0c99c0fcbec01bcb589efe99","bd1225d531fbbb277f710b69b766ad1d04c353aa","1b9eca4d48f9c54ec9672e3c654e59d7ce1676ba","2dc828ad63a1264f15a08ab64242e839eae8fce5","0c703e8237b4561bcf63d6d85a0c4f1f6c70dbbf"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Recurrence and late block of accessory pathway conduction following radiofrequency catheter ablation.","doi":"10.1111/j.1540-8167.1994.tb01188.x","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1540-8167.1994.tb01188.x","venue":"Journal of cardiovascular electrophysiology"}

While the burden of CKD is reasonably well defined in developed countries, increasing evidence indicates that the CKD burden may be even greater in developing countries. Diabetes, hypertension, and obesity are major contributors to the global burden of the disease and are important traditional CKD risk factors; however, nontraditional CKD risk factors such as nephrotoxin exposure, kidney stones, fetal and maternal factors, infections, environmental factors, and acute kidney injury are also increasingly being recognized as major threats to global kidney health. A broad approach to CKD prevention begins with the identification of CKD risk factors in the population, followed by the development of appropriate mitigation strategies. Effective prevention policies rely on an accurate understanding of the incidence and prevalence of CKD in a given setting, as well as the distribution and burden of risk factors. Populations or individuals at CKD risk must be screened and treated early to prevent the onset of and delay the progression of the kidney disease. Systematically collected data should be analyzed at country, province, and district levels to identify regional disparities and CKD hotspots and develop targeted prevention strategies. Race-ethnicity, genetics, sex, socioeconomic status, and geography are likely modifiers of CKD risk. A comprehensive, informed approach to prevention that takes into account all of these factors is therefore required to successfully tackle the global CKD epidemic.","inCitations":["a789d554531b7a07c1d21b2f81373f9186ea7f7d","abd9dc9a9f7974d3b7ec4a70faf1b0750afe708b","93339dd56eb5ad702461b064871894f9032fbdf9","e43d54ce05383f0981870e68788771bbad86a045","14348062f31e331baebe1a9ae5b108e82e17a96f","0f7c8cc506f58d44ad975774322e849ba0f2eb6f","7e5aeacd34645548374244c3104722439f2ff7b1","20bafec6a84265de6e4968c97fd950f35bf38f79","f734807a0090cf6cf4205d273349cf52d5778bab","e3f04a9bf4e2c6da2543b14271e5a5dad4eadf88","2295c95ced5f61e8ffdec9287dcdc101709bf6c8","ac97d35541761562e5432ff0b2c244c178b21d82","cc88af1fb55335a313a0e19afbb030610e74643f","0b3882d08987fb4c2eadfae06bd08095c63e6586","e2dea16b5699a00bf430661c4ee2ca2c5753228d","f5f213af6ca669a033d8430f08a9aaffa1878c47","b347be2db88f4ac0940d1437c43cbc78c6f30e6d","7ca28d2592683933d22ee2452bca2cb86d85de2e","993fedc000c508b2456d7ec7fc3c82e578f39918","8bba45869074a141f3d66d43ec1caa3ff2588169","106e492df1d5a5183623914d104dcfdbf5c75367","f6c1b84b7abe1bc7843cfcf648bb400fb04d6c09","5ce1f7de29fbd997fb92cbf9a507041674066ac1","572d7be38dc1a35a8201e58d24513d0981f5b693","9cea32a4fd4f0f4f0fc22e30558c73abbc84060d","ef83b672c4880ba8620ad2d1e9c2cc3bf95e672f","d55ffd18cfb2ef4619fcbefe226be8d858677e47","0fad1fec67a27fbb408e8bbd5b1a251df0df46bd","d55dd1770a1f6c3e4a630cc6b88ed282f4451292","0beb7505874523d5f933f30add129dedd5883a72","0336d5405a1454d849ca7040721044942495a5f6","577699e8140472a6abf2109bf0213623ef71c185","1758e777716b6461c1c5dc9f491771a69108724f","008664d1a3408bf6ff448971eef8be41e31d6107","54f2aca25986590dcd0bd6874a393a831d5d0359","50753b5f573855175bf4cc1818e5473e0cdc9051","46986d4988aff75e134b4f46ce6a1820ec6d2c58","710d96e02a6eb89851e784ede8b1a53d277ff8be","f51850a2c229dd87a6d20b9ff48be65df1a00d67","a9c28a808f1cf25181d1b740919cc2845bad3181","61f941155ce80d0480d1844f425e02e5e2a6b8b3","6c43f756d775f6684d264fb4b07b8aa29d489283"],"pdfUrls":["https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/10037599/1/Wheeler_Chronic%20Kidney%20Disease%20Final%202312017.pdf"],"title":"Reducing major risk factors for chronic kidney disease.","doi":"10.1016/j.kisu.2017.07.003","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.kisu.2017.07.003","venue":"Kidney international supplements"}

We introduce a process methodology support this. The goal here is to develop a consistent knowledge model across enterprises that are more precise and reliable.

We coarse grain neuronal networks into populations of neurons and calculate the population average firing rate and output cross-correlation in response to time varying correlated input. We derive coupling equations for the populations based on first and second order statistics of the network connectivity. This coupling scheme is based on the hypothesis that second order statistics of the network connectivity are sufficient to determine second order statistics of neuronal activity. We implement a kinetic theory representation of a simple feed-forward network and demonstrate that the kinetic theory model captures key aspects of the emergence and propagation of correlations in the network, as long as the correlations do not become too strong. By analyzing the correlated activity of feed-forward networks with a variety of connectivity patterns, we provide evidence supporting our hypothesis of the sufficiency of second order connectivity statistics.","inCitations":["1287d023e382c93e18d7bea95a04f1eaf36c2d4a","7f6ab6ada0c2e481485161f2a2e341f74254851b","1a11db2e195a33c1c7b64ee8fadb3226f755a8c0","45ccbb380056870ab358d7f1e762c61da7dd686c","c06f35c7299c76f3be2f3395b5883241c797692d","f11b030958ae966a60160bedf2495f5896c270ff","ac2bf8437badec9c0802ccc2b75ef06de03a8ddd","0a3578eb9e8e1d9b37710580115f642afb54d151","63c6db3d8629e3a817ebce473b16757d1fabc1ea"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.math.umn.edu/~nykamp/pubs/kinetic.pdf","http://www-users.math.umn.edu/~nykamp/pubs/kinetic.pdf","https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q51864347"],"title":"A kinetic theory approach to capturing interneuronal correlation: the feed-forward case","doi":"10.1007/s10827-008-0116-4","sources":["Medline","DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10827-008-0116-4","venue":"Journal of Computational Neuroscience"}

Since data on this axis in diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) are inconsistent and limited, we comprehensively studied the CXCR4-CXCL12-axis in our DLBCL cohort as well as the effects of CXCR4 antagonists on lymphoma cell lines in vitro. In DLBCL, we observed a 140-fold higher CXCR4 expression compared to non-neoplastic controls, which was associated with poor clinical outcome. In corresponding bone marrow biopsies, we observed a correlation of CXCL12 expression and lymphoma infiltration rate as well as a reduction of CXCR4 expression in remission of bone marrow involvement after treatment. Additionally, we investigated the effects of three CXCR4 antagonists in vitro. Therefore, we used AMD3100 (Plerixafor), AMD070 (Mavorixafor), and WKI, the niacin derivative of AMD070, which we synthesized. WK1 demonstrated stronger pro-apoptotic effects than AMD070 in vitro and induced expression of pro-apoptotic genes of the BCL2-family in CXCR4-positive lymphoma cell lines. Finally, WK1 treatment resulted in the reduced expression of JNK-, ERK1/2- and NF-κB/BCR-target genes. These data indicate that the CXCR4-CXCL12-axis impacts the pathogenesis of DLBCL and represents a potential therapeutic target in aggressive lymphomas.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://res.mdpi.com/d_attachment/ijms/ijms-20-04740/article_deploy/ijms-20-04740-v2.pdf"],"title":"The CXCR4–CXCL12-Axis Is of Prognostic Relevance in DLBCL and Its Antagonists Exert Pro-Apoptotic Effects In Vitro","doi":"10.3390/ijms20194740","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms20194740","venue":"International journal of molecular sciences"}

Results: N-Glycosylated contactin is targeted in inflammatory neuropathy. Conclusion: Autoantibodies reveal specific N-glycans that are implicated in adhesive interaction between contactin and neurofascin-155. Significance: Autoantibodies against N-glycosylated contactin may be pathogenic via functional blocking. Cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) play a crucial role in the formation of the nodes of Ranvier and in the rapid propagation of the nerve impulses along myelinated axons. These CAMs are the targets of autoimmunity in inflammatory neuropathies. We recently showed that a subgroup of patients with aggressive chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP) shows autoantibodies to contactin (1). The complex of contactin·Caspr·neurofascin-155 (NF155) enables the formation of paranodal junctions, suggesting that antibody attack against paranodes may participate in the severity of CIDP. In the present study, we mapped the molecular determinants of contactin targeted by the autoantibodies. In three patients, immunoreactivity was directed against the Ig domains of contactin and was dependent on N-glycans. The serum of one patient was selectively directed against contactin bearing mannose-rich N-glycans. Strikingly, the oligomannose type sugars of contactin are required for association with its glial partner NF155 (2). To investigate precisely the role of contactin N-glycans, we have mutated each of the nine consensus N-glycosylation sites independently. We found that the mutation of three sites (N467Q/N473Q/N494Q) in Ig domain 5 of contactin prevented soluble NF155-Fc binding. In contrast, these mutations did not abolish cis-association with Caspr. Next, we showed that the cluster of N-glycosylation sites (Asn-467, Asn-473, and Asn-494) was required for immunoreactivity in one patient. Using cell aggregation assays, we showed that the IgGs from the four CIDP patients prevented adhesive interaction between contactin·Caspr and NF155. Importantly, we showed that the anti-contactin autoantibodies induced alteration of paranodal junctions in myelinated neuronal culture. These results strongly suggest that antibodies to CAMs may be pathogenic and induce demyelination via functional blocking activity.","inCitations":["bdefc4bbd7f7ba1f3f75cfd8201182092db1915d","e0336fe5517a9e5c86b4a6a71390e084a57bd923","d941d815c74a72b74ae8864e0df3dc99e1bbbea1","975750daffddc7e899946840aa78798cd204ad3d","2583ee9d0198bd077519960d3e4abdc20e6fb69c","fb9b32528b49b49c67eed9c98c669f57ba13f219","abafe6f125978969a121ddaee5e573e6373e37b3","aa7cc5b6d9a15d25d8ee12480e4f7b8627e57020","a62081d6067e566a2349fb8ea0e178cc45e833d7","fa0cf3fd3c56f5235321dc3dfce8dfc705936e6f","a959c342bb15ff3b2435f07b00ba691fa9fd7113","74744c847e70865c588c6a6575286cb0dfd679d6","12e165eb6a12a4bffffc6782839f29c2cd43093b","124a286f87aef443d287d09fb5e2a8bfd7349c66","57029af2025427d9b876d3480fd5ac1c54262a8a","7be15cc5d979c5a1d197bdfa4380478c1f877ea1","87d91b2ffa73e1d6b293165a38ac7a7462b1cf3e","d88b120211702c59d7986a13fe79036bd1c266a8","2c73873bef1ad92739e9dbd3fd950bf426e8d0cd","66d5e504b52535acbec87de60fd33f69e43fe623","dafb0c1c8b12c3ade1200abc1bafa4610bcdc917","e4c9d24246932804af760b07eff056966ac0ab18","c675e0e2de3366b015a50f6ebd3ec53a10ae78e2","38ab540b38342558b28ac0408c7cf40ba1170718","ad0ee16b99bff65a30b8cfdb984c5639070af52f","b58b71c81ae42d8cde38b9122739597ceb203014","141551531f7f0b8471b6c5150b6e0dfa6e1866c7","939dfe9045916c68a53a5b4a51de8275c3456dd7","9756ec723a28b14b9097fdc5f4ad0b9888dd6f40","07c7774708bd2de8a735eaf53041ce99c3e9d34c","03e9a97e0cf4ac04abed93cf215b306d783a6759","30238bd9d4426eee1f0b66514aecad0b63e73bd2","fb9e22888b4d3d15fa636564e13b7f09a31f88e0","7bd58a6acf0452a4accc35162c468ca4c8022d43","03dcd4495663babef49c08d04c6a591752870382","d28ec68209fdf822dd46ee35dbcc30a63c6f27c8","4d49d8b973ab36e44fe1fb668b8789fadbe3780d","765d195a9c0e140883d622c4f676c5d1139bd92f","4f929fad1cc978829300fa6c86b6eb69577bee55"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Specific Contactin N-Glycans Are Implicated in Neurofascin Binding and Autoimmune Targeting in Peripheral Neuropathies*","doi":"10.1074/jbc.M113.528489","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M113.528489","venue":"The Journal of Biological Chemistry"}

The experiences and coping strategies used were viewed from the gender perspective. Two in-depth interviews scheduled to coincide with the disease trajectory of acute lymphocytic leukemia were conducted with 9 fathers, and data were analyzed using the matrix system described by Miles and Huberman. Four categories were identified, including fathers' initial reactions to the child's confirmed diagnosis, the decision to disclose the child's diagnosis to others, social support of the fathers, and their effective coping mechanisms. Previous research has shown that men are expected to be emotionally strong to support their spouse. Findings from this study indicate that Hong Kong Chinese fathers need emotional support especially at the onset of the child's diagnosis. Implications for healthcare professionals include the need for ongoing psychosocial support and education over the course of the child's illness. Thus, assessment of the different coping strategies used by the fathers plays a vital role in providing quality care to these fathers. Limitations of the study and recommendations for future research are also included.","inCitations":["98b567e1770af2c834c699fa2dc3a9a2d089674e","abd1e1c287ba4ba9f8a928767a176928fbe34901","f9b5004dc99a5defec7809296d33322d84fd3625","d75e0fde02589d869aa5ee0fb6a7eb8076b640e7","832e0137e1b67a59c636bb6e1a22619f849f2a31","09c218de2724d7862ba1a8c353f6c76e8e184c0d","07da78b51a2f73ff705a8b2859ab91c0ae72223e","d70d09fa034e35bbee3e93bde0a1146d0d76c1fa","422a591ad11df5b34fefce41266a9eaaf6e086f2","9447b0599053cf264c616976151b1eea6dd8a133"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Coping with a child with acute lymphocytic leukemia: the experiences of Chinese fathers in Hong Kong.","doi":"10.1097/01.NCC.0000339260.98818.9c","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1097/01.NCC.0000339260.98818.9c","venue":"Cancer nursing"}

Medical files of a total of 120 patients who received percutaneous intradiscal therapy were retrospectively analyzed. All patients were divided into three groups: group L: diode laser (n = 40), group R: radiofrequency (RF) (n = 40), and group P: pulsed radiofrequency (PRF) (n = 40). The visual analogue scale (VAS) and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) scores were calculated at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months for all patients. One-year follow-up results were as follows: group L: pre-treatment (PreT) VAS 5.6 ± −1, ODI 37.6 ± −4.7, post-treatment 12th month (PT12) VAS 2.8 ± −1.4, ODI 14.1 ± −7.1; group P: PreT VAS 6.0 ± 1, ODI 37.5 ± 5.9, PT12 VAS 3.1 ± 1.3, ODI 20.3 ± 17.0; and group R: PreT VAS 5.6 ± 1.0, ODI 37.9 ± 4.7, PT12 VAS 3.3 ± 1.4, ODI 27.2 ± 14.1. In each of the three groups, there was a statistically significant reduction in the VAS and ODI scores at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months, compared to the baseline values (p < 0.05). The highest reduction in the VAS and ODI scores was observed in group L, whereas the lowest reduction was in group R. We consider that in groups with patient selection criteria at our study; diode laser, RF, and PRF, which are administered using the percutaneous intradiscal route for CLBP patients diagnosed with LDH, may be used as an alternative treatment option.","inCitations":["b348f63b9133dcb1f3b7ccaa89a749d3d3202ae7","654c6e11ccfe21dc223a8589e59c4a21b854f4ca"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"One-year follow-up results of intradiscal diode laser, radiofrequency, and pulsed radiofrequency therapies: a retrospective study","doi":"10.1007/s10103-016-2095-4","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10103-016-2095-4","venue":"Lasers in Medical Science"}

Human breast milk decreases disease-causing bacteria by supplying nutrients and antimicrobial factors such as lysozyme. Goat milk with and without human lysozyme (HLZ) may improve the repair of intestinal barrier function damage induced by EAEC. This work investigates the effect of the milks on intestinal barrier function repair, bacterial adherence in Caco-2 and HEp-2 cells, intestinal cell proliferation, migration, viability and apoptosis in IEC-6 cells in the absence or presence of EAEC.MethodsRat intestinal epithelial cells (IEC-6, ATCC, Rockville, MD) were used for proliferation, migration and viability assays and human colon adenocarcinoma (Caco-2, ATCC, Rockville, MD) and human larynx carcinoma (HEp-2, ATCC, Rockville, MD) cells were used for bacterial adhesion assays. Goats expressing HLZ in their milk were generated and express HLZ in milk at concentration of 270 μg/ml . Cells were incubated with pasteurized milk from either transgenic goats expressing HLZ or non-transgenic control goats in the presence and absence of EAEC strain 042 (O44:H18).ResultsCellular proliferation was significantly greater in the presence of both HLZ transgenic and control goat milk compared to cells with no milk. Cellular migration was significantly decreased in the presence of EAEC alone but was restored in the presence of milk. Milk from HLZ transgenic goats had significantly more migration compared to control milk. Both milks significantly reduced EAEC adhesion to Caco-2 cells and transgenic milk resulted in less colonization than control milk using a HEp-2 assay. Both milks had significantly increased cellular viability as well as less apoptosis in both the absence and presence of EAEC.ConclusionsThese data demonstrated that goat milk is able to repair intestinal barrier function damage induced by EAEC and that goat milk with a higher concentration of lysozyme offers additional protection.","inCitations":["c6193a415e1bbeaa73e6ecf4e60b6c69142844d2","e2673a206b9763a0e991d35f86a910a667e875eb","8c9a4df5abd86a4cf310139ddfe6347ddb5f6cc7","3dcef46d2d3afba66ebc95ce5c2582b897ab58dd","3991ba4bc917adc1d9b2320212b96f5c612f690f","2299f3ed6486a48c328835a67bf2406604576c10","9f35f2b57b9325ce419cc7cacab049df7efe7bcd"],"pdfUrls":["https://static-content.springer.com/openpeerreview/art:10.1186%2F1471-230X-12-106/12876_2012_748_AuthorComment_V2.pdf","http://download-redirector.springer.com/redirect?contentType=pdf&ddsId=art:10.1186/1471-230X-12-106&originUrl=http://bmcgastroenterol.biomedcentral.com/article/10.1186/1471-230X-12-106","http://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/pmc/1b/75/1471-230X-12-106.PMC3439704.pdf","https://cloudfront.escholarship.org/dist/prd/content/qt1xz7f91g/qt1xz7f91g.pdf?t=mh1u3f"],"title":"Goat milk with and without increased concentrations of lysozyme improves repair of intestinal cell damage induced by enteroaggregative Escherichia coli","doi":"10.1186/1471-230X-12-106","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-230X-12-106","venue":"BMC Gastroenterology"}

There were 183 eyes from 93 patients. Sufficient data for analysis were available on 112 eyes from 57 patients. Data from these patients were compared to those of patients reported upon in 1991.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe average number of laser burns applied to the 112 eyes was 2163. Eyes with zone 1 disease had an average of 3077 spots and those with zone 2 disease had an average of 2072 spots. Greater than three months follow-up was available on 42 eyes from 21 patients. Of those eyes, 90% had complete regression of ROP. In an initial report of laser treatment for ROP by several of the same authors in 1991, the average number of laser burns applied for treatment of ROP was 816. There was a 265% increase in the average number of laser applications from the early study to the present.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe data indicate that there has been a trend towards more confluent laser treatment to the avascular zone in ROP.","inCitations":["f9f7838fc8896ccce1a7de51b6abb721d27f1023","697d8efcde23fa3203d5eae32308b1006bb3e107","6e250968dcffb88600b988a5e866b1c750a0300a","db0f4957698d31650000cacf857ca302d725eb20","d3780a52849f3bef35b1829e0c254dcfc7b131c9","eb8b74661bbf64d04a1b9823bdb9f45068d5ce5e","69c0d0bf8f08a37b1b2102fb1cc9acf25a63baaf","5b26d26e43c0d09cd07d6d87bb4a49491442ee6e","6a0f272055596a8a2f19aa177174e7eade9239bf"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Laser treatment for retinopathy of prematurity: evolution in treatment technique over 15 years.","doi":"10.1097/01.iae.0000244293.94251.20","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1097/01.iae.0000244293.94251.20","venue":"Retina"}

The bending length of the samples bleached using nonsilicate stabilizers is smaller compared to that for the samples bleached by using sodium silicate, indicating a softer handle.

These tools typically borrow much of their implementation from optimizing compilers. However, since these tools are expected to analyze programs in their entirety, rather than functions in isolation, the time and space performance of the dataflow analyses are of major concern. We present techniques that reduce the time and space required to perform dataflow analysis of large programs. We have used these techniques to implement an efficient program slicing tool for C programs and have computed slices of programs with more than 100,000 lines of code.","inCitations":["d5eef90edbb248277b0da8987e6bfe3a2c01227f","5c3fa801bf9978a9f1bde1ce29e37d48523ee9d8","6b0250a4ba18535d53b5a4ce7d01cb22330cb83c","a053cb8f6681e0989c489b9b0e1788e0ade97931","689587cc5ddc50d2e6835f41d121c2e09817688c","f14baec2157a8ab769488d7131ab7e55bcc7f37f","c1baa5b01d7450bfc1ceb4487ffca29d4c298f5b","bf1e2393c6f5b41d287f861ccfaa9253eaee7f76","14ba6aae84e2d6b665d48f4b6d265979e9fa03b3","efaeba2af6ce652fed0835b6ac5156dde7dd67e8","e823ef620a52fb0b83079dd4ec7a6892a908052e","5317e9f51724ac6e296ec2176712244faaac9a7f","9a0e2776b415f1462f7c5a12f6ac005b8ba61bac","4c450247e8961dc194359a3f0f733934437d5f14","ed89c9779f9311dbca12b11dbf7366c63b359e7f","65b0cc11068a0a3d4d55629df596a21e1fcff403","b8e4d7ec6737804649763009d6c34aa607ba219a","cf49b3293ab9187686529af1a77a482b55d98eb0","ac6a281e0dd8a1aa8154159dd4ca847657d68f9f","159a88928e228768b638f4bbff801aa6dad76c72","d80b47352c173ad506d2f1f161a614d955655cfd","534f7d5d3bd026db683636d031b8b3c504477b6a","7c415da262c1296977ad0b94d9d3e1305a3a2922","0f7c4b717563e28e5a29eae605f0ae19439c5dad","1828cd6e2715ab33957041d7b85c7a72f5d1f3a8","4d9c08ff55a66c33ff85937266ee434b2c475a17","51211c46f6587f74ef805c4d8e5b908e2ccfa0a0","2fd811463714bb80c66e436a7ebf62c42401fdfd","3ad1ad840efdedee7026fa9bb7272d526bcaa599","4a0f90ee77af8727970cae0a52af5c2fb9be2668","d75300d610102c618bca4889cdf01e4f93517159","3a2111972ea5049a21d439506c547b93b6dfcef0","72a623f9c8bd46cf0896def8dc96c22df70eea16","a3e0dfbacc5cbed961890e036d534645cffee928","4a2dd50b5b24a4cb8f4349870a0076b358bcdf72","143fdb75aedcb51752a456130b0e6f7e4b66b7c4","7f5857593297845dacca45c7c054563a1d29156f","86275023a27ad8ec23d956328a0ea8d6b98e2d35","9796e79e868d996fe0636ad5ea30040729995b7f"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.cse.scu.edu/~atkinson/papers/icsm-01.pdf","http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/ICSM.2001.972711","http://www.cse.scu.edu/~atkinson/papers/icsm-01.ps"],"title":"Implementation techniques for efficient data-flow analysis of large programs","doi":"10.1109/ICSM.2001.972711","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSM.2001.972711","venue":"Proceedings IEEE International Conference on Software Maintenance.

Herein, we report a new catalyst where Cu nanoparticles are embedded in the carbon support with abundant defect sites, achieving a high selectivity for ethanol in the CO2 hydrogenation. The experiments coupled with the theoretical studies show a clear map where carbon defects serve as anchor sites that can stabilize interfacial copper species, and interfacial Cu sites with low coordination numbers can adsorb two C1 species and later convert them to a C2 species via a hydrogenation-induced coupling reaction. Further adjacent Cu atoms of interfacial Cu sites can facilitate OH reduction reactions via the Cu-Cu bridge adsorption to assist the formation of ethanol. Especially, those specific active sites easily disappear in the reducing conditions and during the reaction, the major product can transform from ethanol to methanol.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Selectivity switch in transformation of CO2 from ethanol to methanol on Cu embedded in the defect carbon","doi":"10.1007/s11426-019-9730-5","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11426-019-9730-5","venue":"Science China Chemistry"}

This paper evaluates technological learning among firms in the cable and wire manufacturing subsector in Nigeria, using a case firm. We developed a model of the relationship between the innovative activities of the firm – as evidence of its capability – and its knowledge acquisition methodology. These are discussed within the context of the firm's stock of human capital. We found low technological innovation capability and high capability for organisational and marketing innovation. Preparedness for technological learning is relatively poor with a staff training intensity of 5% and an innovation intensity of 0.0075%. We therefore propose stronger interconnectedness between the National Innovation System and the creation of industry-specific structures that could enhance learning.","inCitations":["e69e08a6c3ec802a5f0552883febc00090ce8e38","750c0db7f333f44f0edcd86491c8c8cb5cf9819f","7c7293a27d4df4fd10cd4972fbaed4f4350f6e00","38a83af2b50a1e57a94e5fad72524705cb13a867","1120c51cccb1c6dadd58139e6563688952676e43","c31cfd4a1439ad66137e4c2475b0bee5248ede51","02b5a742ad30397d01e561be5618347aa7d4a5fb","ce08394fdc875dbc4efbf6e5eee74a9a4ee5d1f8","9c2180db566cbe888a1913fb8ff266db34d65f97","6f88d1bac498b929cf495fe98d3afe45f45aed4e","bbd1a4e19ede034257cf22119035465abab94a49"],"pdfUrls":["https://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/25339/1/Learning_to_innovate_Manuscript.pdf"],"title":"Learning to Innovate in Nigeria?s Cable and Wire Manufacturing Sub-sector: inferences from a firm-","doi":"10.1504/IJLIC.2010.029534","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1504/IJLIC.2010.029534","venue":""}

They include the fact that the control regime began with concerns over opium-smoking in the ‘orient’, a concentration of drug crops in the Global South, the energies of colonialism (which have been intimately tied up with ‘drug wars’), broader geo-political imperatives and the focus of policy metrics on drug crops.• The market for synthetic drugs has grown exponentially in recent years, becoming the second-most illicit drugs consumed after cannabis. In 2014, the UN estimated that there were 35.7 million users of amphetamine type stimulants (including prescription stimulants), and 19.4 million users of ecstasy. These synthetic drugs outstripped the estimated totals of opioids and cocaine combined.• Alongside this consumption is that of New Psychoactive Substances that fall outside the control regime and its schedules, which the regime is now attempting to integrate into national and international controls.• While there was some awareness of the advent of new synthetic drugs in the aftermath of the Second World War and since the 1960s, it is only over recent years, and especially in the wake of the 2016 UNGASS in New York, that a truly serious understanding of the challenges posed by proliferating synthetic drugs has begun to emerge from the international drug control regime.• This is timely since, considering its policy history and contemporary dynamics, it is now time to reframe the narrative surrounding the way the international community deals with synthetic drugs.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://www.drugsandalcohol.ie/27909/1/Global_Drug_Synthetics_FINAL.pdf"],"title":"Dealing with synthetics: time to reframe the narrative.","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

This assumption leads to overestimates of the arc pressures and accelerations by approximately a factor of 2 for typical rail‐gun geometries. In this paper, we develop a simple method for modifying the momentum equation to account for the effect of finite‐height rails on the performance of the rail gun and the properties of the arc. The modification is based on an integration of the Lorentz force across the arc cross section at each axial location in the arc. Application of this technique suggests that, for typical rail‐gun geometries and moderately long arcs, the momentum equation appropriate for infinite‐height rails can be retained provided that the magnetic pressure term in the equation is scaled by a factor which depends on the effective inductance of the gun. The analysis also indicates that the magnetic pr...","inCitations":["0f72549b47dc472a81f8bb4bcd3dce5dae75c2d6","248c80de7cf4c3fd547e88f83265f569025a9d94","4b87fe277fd1db110312eab3605eff0d77cd5e92","576ad20b90d862f207cb7769af8fc309a508ddd6"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Momentum equation for arc-driven rail guns","doi":"10.1063/1.333880","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1063/1.333880","venue":""}

Exposed rats were serially killed and dissected so that the movement of the radiolabel could be traced over 7 days. Hydrolysis products cleared rapidly after noninhalation administration (t 1/2 less than 24 hr). The deposition of inhaled difluoro was mainly in the maxillo- and ethmoturbinates, and clearance was mainly by mucociliary clearance and swallowing. Constants were calculated for relating doses of difluoro to various respiratory tract tissues as a function of total deposited vapor. These constants indicate that the maxilloturbinates in the anterior of the nose receive more than four times the dose of difluoro than do the ethmoturbinates, whereas the trachea and lung receive much lower doses than do the nasal tissues. The derived constants may be applicable for calculating doses to respiratory tract tissues for other inhaled vapors that do not saturate the mucus (e.g., irreversibly react with water).","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Deposition and clearance of a water-reactive vapor, methylphosphonic difluoride (difluoro), inhaled by rats.","doi":"10.1016/0041-008X(85)90120-6","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/0041-008X%2885%2990120-6","venue":"Toxicology and applied pharmacology"}

The African continent plays a growing role in the carbon (C) cycle. However, Africa is one of the weakest links in our understanding of the global carbon cycle particularly when considering the soil compartment. Most of the soil organic carbon (SOC) estimates concern the global size of the soil C reservoir without indication on its distribution, or if given, limited to the contribution of a large ecosystems or region. The aim of the study is i) to assess the original soil C stocks (SOC) of Africa for the different countries and Ecoregions, and ii) to compare SOC estimates from different soil properties databases and digital maps. Four recent global digital soil maps and five soil properties databases were used to estimate the SOC for different soil layers in Africa. Those databases hold between 1799 and 4043 soil profiles which are considered to represent the soil units showed on a 0.5 by 0.5 degree soil maps of Africa. SOC of Africa ranged 133 420–184 116 Tg for 0–100 cm soil layer. The most recent databases estimated 166 397 Tg C which corresponded to 9% of the global SOC stock and 68% of the terrestrial C pool of Africa. Average SOC ranges 0.4–8.2 kg m−2 at national scale and 1.53–6.61 kg m−2 for ecoregions. Using different soil database or spatial data leads to up to 30% of difference. These quantities indicate a great potential to develop sink activities through soil C sequestration activities.","inCitations":["293c7ee66b7b76edc28c3b3d74a70adfa38a8342","1d7b6c082e9687cc7f7fdef3bfdc6e94059c98a0","8da51010647f61cfa06328bfce48b08964c8461f","2d7c51d805def70e4224cc8bdfb45611d7a4f469","36ed1595f55e9e5e052256ffccb219613b8e2f43","17e027fe521c55eb87a27cbb083bf0a19381edd1","f352f864fef06acc29663439c33470beebe86aa1","7d4400bc546b233f624a8e4c416a55c6060e6254","0f917392fa0e5833ddf30afad167190987228498","208c88ebcf59a62db372beeebdfe537a80e1f194","bf017ceee66d88a80faf6b1186eac284d7c16db7","6f0e5c0ac5f2e576c540d0e16c225786d978b8cf","f45cd596f5ca7f4b857ae4297e4969e05c3ad979","122f979209b516be50344b82053cd5d7d8ccfbb2","2314e26827e8f0722170ca178b5c359659281944","d2f492e59b3f51f3bbebc4bfc174b6c074c59fec","2a1ef75e41c40e1cd9e37d7790c37d75454e89c1","4212c6a9c66af4512b7f7d9ce67395998308c51d","b3db7c95738605d24b4ce3d00909fb472d3d87a5","88014c33326fc1dd97279f4baa2c8338dd3b85bf","9fdfd2263cea90af754657e6592a0cd55c49c7f2","a394d5afd9d737d366e10775397c91478a4c5d7e","27581ce0096085f849c2edb6e164f9bb84e97d4b","b5090e4cc7a6e1c011f3c484f15b4734a19df547","e66357740faa8bc6457a5b70291d22553ab84979","3dda35bde90339881b520860314d8429032fd10e","7a095dbe44e46646787556de12deedee8fe2eb47","c585830fdd9b2b6c4488f26564dbc41a25621c80","f9daf1910c0a8999d6724e59c5cee2c50129336b","c5ff6d0acb66bfbf3ed852e3a5bb953d68658e8c","f9a6a710534fceb4482cb60d06182034dd1bfcee","35593dfeeed4210ef2a22112b827b368ede2b945","5d86e812df9c760afd61426726538b591e74b926","43ade0795fa889976f77b42bc3873ff6dde8cbc4","a508d8b631bc3e46be7975dc98862f2364c3de26","07540b8d38b2add9c231b6bb955e3f51fa1ca4ce","9eab49c714e29918bbaccd68104396153e56395a","1e3d01d40853cdb3527fa574fa8a845a9b0c48e2","ba3db11ebd51b539ecd96bf8b37d0f7bb54ca831","7cffff96196646eb36f6a2416e26a4e842e9d8fa","b087f2653ae5a7dce957d17eee83ebe2abc25e55"],"pdfUrls":["https://www.biogeosciences-discuss.net/6/797/2009/bgd-6-797-2009.pdf","http://www2.agroparistech.fr/geeft/Downloads/Pub/Henry_et_al_2009_BGD_6_SOC_stocks_Africa.pdf","http://www.biogeosciences-discuss.net/6/797/2009/bgd-6-797-2009.pdf"],"title":"Soil carbon stocks in ecoregions of Africa","doi":"10.5194/bgd-6-797-2009","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.5194/bgd-6-797-2009","venue":""}

The most common but yet critical occupational hazard is respiratory hazard. Hazardous contaminants in the air, if not properly filtered, can cause lung diseases and if absorbed into the bloodstream can result in damage to other organs in the body. The effects are always long-term and incurable. The key to an occupational health protection program can be summarised into 4 steps: (1) identification of the hazards, (2) understanding of the effects of the hazard on workers, (3) selection of the proper personal protective equipments, and (4) training of the workers in the proper use and care of the respirators. This paper is intended to focus and elaborate specifically on a respiratory protection program and how to manage it in compliance with regulatory requirements.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Health: Respiratory Protection in The","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

The SWNTs are found to attach to the electrodes along the direction of the ac external electric field. The SWNTs predominately bridge the shortest gap between the two electrodes and the spatial distribution of the tubes becomes wider for a long manipulation time (say, greater than 300 s). The observed phenomenon is analyzed in terms of the dielectrophoresis-induced torque and force on the SWNTs. Our simulation shows that the time for rotating SWNTs to the direction of the electric field is much smaller than that for translating SWNTs. We also found that metallic SWNTs are forced along the gradient direction of spacial distribution of the electric field strength while semiconducting SWNTs are forced in the opposite direction.","inCitations":["a0a30b838c436888b39575b53fef79e2dfa7c93b","d75655ab096010dce775005473001afae9ea9a71","bc4c9fc3631d5c24c3cd0f4e7c139bff59ae9a54","af257cc10270f3c58880d4b44ba862b6f7475529","d5677cd4c0b445925287e9b36c6caec79c49510c","d8bb2b9b4667752e28ca14d0967d3d8f25fac6a4","4d8cc2e49ca762b04aea10781c0a7ab3b6602bb9","dea0dc455fa4fc5f314e3c4f9d2f490980df3569","5abc58a0ee79456a63a9bda94d8917620d889caa","0b8401b93d0c38953528d2a78eec3bc29f9f3cb8","e890cd9b91eed8645be996d1103f13d2da79dec0","94cd539b904ec9745da50eca8c31d1e439c22eae","97bca712d9da2d9f4498f0b14a07e7a503a43f6c","9ed73f038b7e10a06e8b6ec45940604127710e09","3c946857b399d32dc4ffe6ba08de5ec30889eae7","6127bd966c821504a22ce09563a73e092ee3e980","f7484996fa52e9ca6415ecde662c5c1a32d62226","96064fca128b9021db0803e684ba85c6a555fc64","55657b741367bc65dc5ea7af8ebae29ea8a9844c","12bbbb10e721dbb78866fd9f8cf301877c88a2f5","9d5cf6c86901e79f3f1a4503e61da260c58d8df6","93305b354d187cac6a8ff6ff3f5d58e97b94780f","4976eed0dd53fc3ad1b6b26ddcf29deb17d01dad","cdc35f888adf502ccb4f48c6d08528e453787e18","2a63ed9933edea8fbcdf296fabd2912c80a56add","139bca48a822ed0d5c8dc83720f3f874e5fd58d4","adc887d1a831cea62da09fd26e98d4959b86251e","06d073c45a38d4ee4d22b19ba90d67e7fef8875a","0da4350f2168120526047bc81e900f5568e788ac","75cd5987af1dba6301669391b41a6a9c8b2d8743","f5dd27baa738ecac6df3e21d338ac8f8a18d2125","aea8676671dc4cfc67417fc0d4544abda85925a0","80cf7283a121088bc9507669fe3519bd405b6ac5","f51942062b995308ded4ddecb34cb428ab303b4e","473f154a24c6c77930ce6d2287ac28fec1b7794a"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Manipulation of carbon nanotubes using AC dielectrophoresis","doi":"10.1063/1.1901825","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1063/1.1901825","venue":""}

However, due to the complexity of the skeletal muscle (consisting of muscle fiber, fascia, blood vessel and nerves), the origin of cells has not been identified. OBJECTIVE: To observe the potential for chondrogenic differentiation of fascia‐derived cells (FDCs) in order to clarify the chondrogenic ability of the cells derived from the skeletal muscle. METHODS: The fascia was isolated from the rat gluteus maximus, and was then cultured in chondrogenic medium containing bone morphogenic protein 4 and transforming growth factor &bgr;3. Samples were harvested on day 14. The chondrogenic differentiation of FDCs was identified by alcian blue, hematoxylin‐eosin and safranin O stainings. Cell markers were investigated by immunostaining using the antibodies for desmin, CD34, vimentin, vWF and a‐SMA. Immunostaining was used to assay the chondrogenic potential of FDCs cultured with L6 rat myoblasts at varying ratios (1:0, 4:1; 1:1, 1:4 and 0:1). RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: FDCs harvested from the skeletal muscle displayed chondrogenic differentiation and formed cartilaginous tissue when cultured for 14 days in chondrogenic medium after alcian blue and safranin O stainings. Cells isolated from the fascia were negative for desmin, CD34, vWF and a‐SMA, but over 90% of the cells were positive for vimentin. Mixed FDC and L6 myoblast pellets showed chondrogenic potential decreased with the increasing ratio of L6 myoblasts. From the analysis of cell surface marker of FDCs in the skeletal muscle, immunostaining, and the comparison with L6 rat myoblasts, it shows that FDCs are the seed cells with chondrogenic potential in the skeletal muscle.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Chondrogenic progenitor cells isolated from the fascia of skeletal muscle","doi":"10.3969/j.issn.2095-4344.0198","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.3969/j.issn.2095-4344.0198","venue":""}

Data for comorbidities, BMI, excess weight loss (EWL), and body composition were obtained before and during 60 months after surgery.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe risk allele was found in 65 (47%) of the 141 women. Pre-surgical body weight and BMI were higher in carriers of the rs17782313 polymorphism (CC + CT group) than in non-carriers (TT group) (p = 0.039 and 0.047, respectively). The number of women who acquired surgical success (EWL > 50%), was lower in CC + CT group compared to TT group (p = 0.015). The minimum BMI seen during the 60 months of follow-up was higher in CC + CT group compared to TT group (p = 0.028). The number of women who presented BMI < 30 kg/m2 (no longer classified as obesity) after 24 months of surgery was inferior in CC + CT group (6 out 35 patients - 17%) than in TT group (19 out 49 patients - 37%, p = 0.043).

In this research, design and construction of a calculator as a medium of learning has been done. The calculator is completed by many algorithm such as the quadratic formula, Cardano, Viete's, Bairstow, revise Baristow, Muller, and combination algorithms. The alculator was designed by UML approach and implemented on Java Swing GUI. The test results using black box method showed that 100%  of functional calculator can work well. Based on the average calculation error, cubic polynomial is solved properly by using Cardano algorithm which the average error is 1.43568059121049E-13% .

Gender minority individuals (N = 120) completed an online survey containing psychosocial and mental health outcome measures. The experiences of participants who resided in states with and without nondiscrimination laws were compared in regard to perceived community stigma. Hierarchical and logistic regression were used to test the hypothesized relationships between community stigma and lifetime discrimination and victimization; current depression, anxiety, and substance use; and lifetime suicide attempts. Approximately 60% of participants reported residing in a state without nondiscrimination laws (n = 74). These participants reported higher levels of perceived community stigma, and stigma was positively associated with reports of lifetime discrimination and victimization. The observed relationship between stigma and current anxiety symptoms was marginally significant. Logistic regression results indicate that stigma was positively related to the odds of reporting a lifetime suicide attempt. Analyses suggest that statewide nondiscrimination laws are associated with lower rates of perceived stigma at the community level, which, in turn, is associated with lower rates of discrimination, victimization, anxiety, and risk for attempted suicide.","inCitations":["cc4dabb26f827a6289ae776a96cc234dc6456160","104fa7423563a02be783ba421b914663238a522a","ee951178498c8ad4f1050f745188337620098588","5b052f6ab10539ca0c1e27ca8e258475bf96a2d5","6688b169144ed4f5b32f0ed2bcf0ca3085f2a045","d6b619893e95b1d744e93bf0354b46621a85d839","fcc353f7c85a5f95d9c07adb841008e1a61725dc"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Effects of state nondiscrimination laws on transgender and gender-nonconforming individuals' perceived community stigma and mental health","doi":"10.1080/19359705.2016.1207582","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1080/19359705.2016.1207582","venue":""}

Horses were monitored via pain scores and received butorphanol for analgesia. After 18 hours, ischemic-injured and control mucosa were placed in Ussing chambers for measurement of transepithelial resistance and permeability to lipopolysaccharide. Histomorphometry was used to determine denuded villus surface area. Western blots for cyclooxygenase (COX)-1 and COX-2 were performed. Plasma thromboxane B(2) and prostaglandin E(2) metabolite (PGEM) concentrations were determined.\n\n\nRESULTS\nPain scores did not significantly increase after surgery in horses receiving flunixin meglumine or firocoxib. Transepithelial resistance of ischemic-injured jejunum from horses treated with flunixin meglumine was significantly lower than in saline- or firocoxib-treated horses. Lipopolysaccharide permeability across ischemic-injured mucosa was significantly increased in horses treated with flunixin meglumine. Treatment did not affect epithelial restitution. Cyclooxygenase-1 was constitutively expressed and COX-2 was upregulated after 2 hours of ischemia. Thromboxane B(2) concentration decreased with flunixin meglumine treatment but increased with firocoxib or saline treatment. Flunixin meglumine and firocoxib prevented an increase in PGEM concentration after surgery.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE\nFlunixin meglumine retarded mucosal recovery in ischemic-injured jejunum, whereas firocoxib did not. Flunixin meglumine and firocoxib were effective visceral analgesics. Firocoxib may be advantageous in horses recovering from ischemic intestinal injury.","inCitations":["36b66410ada5eff2aefe93e6a0af03bd37271e6a","4edb6be276caa93c43707f50c50f0e795af717e8","ce02b7c7c6aba9a905fda73ca0024e3f07f80415","095d1766b648448ad1b4fdad2d37eb669b0f4dd1","8543834173d08939f25224e004392e1e87cb9183","7df38c8203a5fd312fcffc77edfdbac73ac01f6a"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Effect of firocoxib or flunixin meglumine on recovery of ischemic-injured equine jejunum.","doi":"10.2460/ajvr.70.8.992","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.2460/ajvr.70.8.992","venue":"American journal of veterinary research"}

A numerical calculation gives us the order of magnitude of the relative contribution of each effect.

Toutefois d’autres effets moins importants liés à la variation de l’indice de réfraction interviennent et sont en général négligés sans aucune évaluation. Nous analysons ici ces phénomènes et évaluons leur influence respective dans le cas d’un verre d’indice n = 1,55 et en lui assignant comme coefficients photoélastiques la moyenne de ceux du quartz [7] (P 11 =0,12, P12 = 0,25). Ceci semble suffisant pour obtenir l’ordre de grandeur des diverses contributions. Le choix d’un faisceau lumineux uniforme est justifié par le fait qu’il donne pour les faisceaux diffractés les mêmes amplitudes qu’un faisceau gaussien [3]. Dans un article précédent [6] résumé ici nous avions déjà étudié la modulation d’amplitude de l’onde réfléchie due à la variation du coefficient de réflexion de la surface (lre correction).

An exhibiting example is first shown, which indicates that earthquake motion at the ground surface evaluated by the analysis considering the ground from a seismic bedrock to a ground surface simultaneously (continuous analysis) is different from the one by the analysis in which the ground is separated at the engineering seismic base layer and analyzed separately (separate analysis). The reason is investigated by several approaches. Investigation based on eigen value problem indicates that the first predominant period in the continuous analysis cannot be found in the separate analysis, and predominant period at higher order does not match in the upper and lower ground in the separate analysis. The earthquake response analysis indicates that reflected wave at the engineering seismic base layer is not zero, which indicates that conventional engineering seismic base layer...","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://extras.springer.com/2007/978-1-4020-5893-6/paperpdf/1381_yos.pdf"],"title":"Engineering Seismic Base Layer for Defining Design Earthquake Motion","doi":"10.1063/1.2963855","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1063/1.2963855","venue":""}

All studies included are categorized as within groups (repeated measures) experimental designs. Current research suggested that DNR and additional programs may improve comfort in noise but not intelligibility, and directional microphone technology may improve signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) but only in certain situations. While this research was suggestive, the clinical implications are that these strategies should be implemented with caution and concern for each individual patient.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Critical Review: Are amplification features such as digital noise reduction, directional microphone technology, or additional programs beneficial in noisy situations for school-aged children with mild to severe hearing loss?","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}
