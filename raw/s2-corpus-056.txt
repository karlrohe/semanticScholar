Sedu and Penor soils were \norganic soil representing vegetable growing soil while Segamat, Retang and Persit were \nmineral soils representing the plantation soil. The order of organic matter content of the \nsoils samples were: Penor > Sedu > Segamat > Retang and Persit while the order of the \nacidity of the soils samples were Penor > Sedu > Segamat > Retang > Persit. The \nadsorption ofmetsulfuron methyl to the soil samples were found to best fit the Freundlich \nadsorption isothenn with distribution coefficients (Kd) ranging from 0.45 to 46.23. A \nsignificant positive correlation between organic matter content and adsorption was \nobserved, while a significant negative correlation was seen between soil pH and \nadsorption. The extent ofdesorption ofrnetsulfuron methyl was also observed to decrease \nwith increasing organic matter content. Influence of temperature on adsorption revealed \nthat variation in temperature exhibited only a mild effect on adsorption while the \nmoisture content of soil decreased the adsorption of metsuIfuron methyl to the soil. The \npresence ofNPK decreased the adsorption ofthe chemical in Sega.mat, Retang and Persit \nsoils. However NPK does not seems to affect adsorption in organic matter rich Penor and \nSedu soils. The biodegradation study revealed a significantly faster rate of degradation of \nthe herbicide in non-sterile soil compared to autoclaved soil, indicating the role of \nmicroorganisms in the breakdown process. The half-life in the soil series investigated \nvaried from 4..03 days to 16.79 days. Biodegradation was noted to be slowest in Persit \nseries soil and most rapid in Penor and Sedu series. Half-life in the soil increased from \n4.03 days to 16.79 days when the biomass decreased from 172.1 to 13.2 mgCI00g-1 \n. A \nhighly significant pasitive correlation was observed between degradation rate and soil \nbiomass while a highly negative correlation was observed with soil pH. The rate of \ndegradation of metsulfuron methyl was also observed to increase with temperature. The \nhalf- life of metsulfuron methyl decreased from 11 .94 days to 6.29 days as the \ntemperature increased from 25 to 35°C. The degradation ofthe chemical was also noted \nto be more mpid at higher soil moisture contents. At 75% field capacity, the half-life was \n4.15 days while at 25% field moisture capacity the half-life was 12.21 days. Simulated \nrainfall following the application ofmetsulfuron methyl at a field application rate of 75 g \nper hectare in Segamat series of 2.77 % organic matter and pH 4.2 resulted in the \nleaching of the herbicide up to 15 cm of the soil column. Much of the applied herbicide \nwas detected at 10 to 15 cm depth of the column and complete leaching of the chemical \nthrough the soil column was not observed under the conditions ofthe study.. The mobility \nof metsulfuron methyl significantly decreased with increasing amount of organic matter \nand has a significant negative correlation with soil Kd value. In Pers;t and Retang soil, \nwith lower organic matter content metsulfuron methyl seems to have moved downward to \n20 -25 em and been detected in the leachate. However, in the PenOT soil (organic matter, \n33.8 % and Kd value, 38.18), metsulfuron methyl moved only to the depth up to 5 \ncentimeters. It was also evident that mobility is much higher in Per.s·;t and Retang soils \nwith higher pH values. The lower mobility in Penor soil is due to the lower soil pH. The \nresults of the present study shows that a stronger adsorption of chemical at lower pH \nvalues resulted in lower mobility of the chemical In a related study on the influence of \nduration, amount and frequency, it was observed that mobility ofmetsulfuron methyl was \nsomewhat greater with increased amount of rainfall, duration and frequency. It was \nsuggested that metsulfuron methyl could be characterized as relatively mobile compound, \nparticularly when exposed to higher amount, duration and frequency of rainfall as in \ntropical areas. This herbicide could move downward and contaminate groundwater. \nMobility studies on initial water content of soil reveals that dry soil appear to show less \ndownward movement while leaching studies using an intact core column demonstrated \nthat the extent of metsulfuron methyl mobility was less in intact core column. The \nrelevant constants derived from laboratory data were combined with weather records of \nrainfall, daily maximum and minimum temperatures for the appropriate period of study in \nthe computer simulation program called PERSIST.EXE. The results from the simulation \nand laboratory observation of metsulfuron methyl in all the five soil samples seems to \nindicate that the agreement between simulated and observed soil residues varied \naccording to the soil type. These results shows that the model simulated soil persistence \nofmetsulfuron methyl in Penor and Sedu soil quite accumtely while in Segamat, Retang \nand Per,y;t soil, there was a tendency to underestimate the rates of 10ss.It was evident that \nthe relative mobility is strongly attributed to the better fit of the model with organic \nmatter rich soil compared to mineral soils such as Segamat, Retang and Persit. \nVARLEACH seems to have predicted the depth of metsulfuron methyl movement \n(penetration) accumtely in all the soil samples however, the model did not predict the \nconcentration ofthe herbicide in the soil profile correctly for Segamat, Retang and Pers;t \nsoil The prediction ofmetsulfuron methyl concentration in the soil profile was accurate \nonly in Penor soil. It was evident that the model has closely predicted the movement and \nprofile concentration in Penor soil where metsulfuron methyl was least mobile. The \nsimulated results also indicates that metsulfuron methyl is more mobile in Retang and \nPersil soil compared to Segamat soil as demonstrated by the laboratory observation. The \nmodel overestimated ~he amount ofthe herbicide in the top layer of Segamat, Retang and \nPersil soils. The large discrepancies between the observed and predicted is attributed to \nthe difference between the soil condition in the laboratory and the field","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Adsorption-desorption moblity and biodegradation of metsulfuron methyl in selected Malaysian agricultural soil / Saraswathy Sinnakkannu","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Previous studies have suggested the mediating role of mindfulness in the association between child behavior problems and parental stress.\n\n\nAIMS\nThe present study examined whether this mediating role is a result of parents' self-report bias. It also explored whether mindfulness has a moderating role instead when child behavior problems are reported by teachers.\n\n\nMETHODS\nIn a questionnaire survey, 271 Chinese parents of children with ID in 6 Hong Kong special schools reported their levels of stress and mindfulness, as well as their children's behavior problems. The latter was also reported by teachers.\n\n\nRESULTS\nWhen child behavior problems were reported by parents, parental mindfulness was a mediator between child behavior problems and parental stress. In contrast, when child behavior problems were reported by teachers, parental mindfulness was a moderator between child behavior problems and parental stress.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe mediation role of mindfulness maybe an artifact of measurement. The findings provide an encouraging message that parenting a child with ID and behavior problems does not necessarily mean more stress among all parents. Parents with a high level of mindfulness may experience less stress than those with a low level of mindfulness.\n\n\nWHAT THIS PAPER ADDS\nParents of children with intellectual disability (ID) tend to report high psychological stress. Previous self-report studies have identified mindfulness as a mediator in the association between child behavior problems and parental stress. The present study differs from previous studies by including third-party's reports. It has contributed to the existing body of knowledge in two respects. First, it examined whether the mediation effect resulted from parent self-report bias. Second, it tested an alternative hypothesis of the moderation effect by using teachers' reports to measure child behavior problems. The results showed that when child behavior problems were measured by parents' reports, parental mindfulness was a mediator between child behavior problems and parental stress. The more the parents reported that their children had behavior problems, the less they reported being mindful, which in turn the more stressful they were. However, when child behavior problems were measured by teachers' reports, parental mindfulness was a moderator instead, moderating the association between child behavior problems and parental stress. The association was ameliorated when parents reported high levels of mindfulness. These findings reveal another possible role of mindfulness and shed light on the support for parents of children with ID.","inCitations":["5d00b5babb3ab4af7634987f1842bdab7102b119"],"pdfUrls":["http://isiarticles.com/bundles/Article/pre/pdf/119780.pdf"],"title":"Mediator or moderator?

Peptide B1R agonists bearing optimized pharmacological features (high potency, selectivity and stability toward proteolysis) hold promise as valuable therapeutic agents in the treatment of these diseases. In the present study, we used solid-phase methodology to synthesize a series of novel peptide analogues based on the sequence of Sar[dPhe(8)]desArg(9)-bradykinin, a relatively stable peptide agonist with moderate affinity for the human B1R. We evaluated the pharmacological properties of these peptides using (1) in vitro competitive binding experiments on recombinant human B1R and B2R (for index of selectivity determination) in transiently transfected human embryonic kidney 293 cells (HEK-293T cells), (2) ex vivo vasomotor assays on isolated human umbilical veins expressing endogenous human B1R, and (3) in vivo blood pressure tests using anesthetized lipopolysaccharide-immunostimulated rabbits. Key chemical modifications at the N-terminus, the positions 3 and 5 on Sar[dPhe(8)]desArg(9)-bradykinin led to potent analogues. For example, peptides 18 (SarLys[Hyp(3),Cha(5), dPhe(8)]desArg(9)-bradykinin) and 20 (SarLys[Hyp(3),Igl(5), dPhe(8)]desArg(9)-bradykinin) outperformed the parental molecule in terms of affinity, functional potency and duration of action in vitro and in vivo.

Herein, we have investigated through a multiplex assay whether proteins of energy metabolism could provide biomarkers of IMs.MethodsA cohort of thirty-two muscle biopsies and forty plasma samples comprising polymyositis (PM), dermatomyositis (DM) and sporadic inclusion body myositis (sIBM) and control donors was interrogated with monoclonal antibodies against proteins of energy metabolism using reverse phase protein microarrays (RPPA).ResultsWhen compared to controls the expression of the proteins is not significantly affected in the muscle of PM patients. However, the expression of β-actin is significantly increased in DM and sIBM in consistence with muscle and fiber regeneration. Concurrently, the expression of some proteins involved in glucose metabolism displayed a significant reduction in muscle of sIBM suggesting a repression of glycolytic metabolism in these patients. In contrasts to these findings, the expression of the glycolytic pyruvate kinase isoform M2 (PKM2) and of the mitochondrial ATPase Inhibitor Factor 1 (IF1) and Hsp60 were significantly augmented in DM when compared to other IMs in accordance with a metabolic shift prone to cancer development. PKM2 alone or in combination with other biomarkers allowed the discrimination of control and IMs with very high (>95%) sensitivity and specificity. Unfortunately, plasma levels of PKM2 were not significantly altered in DM patients to recommend its use as a non-invasive biomarker of the disease.ConclusionsExpression of proteins of energy metabolism in muscle enabled discrimination of patients with IMs. RPPA identified the glycolysis promoting PKM2 and IF1 proteins as specific biomarkers of dermatomyositis, providing a biochemical link of this IM with oncogenesis.","inCitations":["03e9528c4d4387aad2a60ace653d7db9c26d21ab","79ab7a63d9078cd32a224166ed90f0782faf76ce","53926518a1e7f62e23699decf28f6a0c06ed94bd"],"pdfUrls":["http://diposit.ub.edu/dspace/bitstream/2445/109650/1/668779.pdf","https://translational-medicine.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s12967-017-1136-5?site=translational-medicine.biomedcentral.com"],"title":"Pyruvate kinase M2 and the mitochondrial ATPase Inhibitory Factor 1 provide novel biomarkers of dermatomyositis: a metabolic link to oncogenesis","doi":"10.1186/s12967-017-1136-5","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12967-017-1136-5","venue":"Journal of Translational Medicine"}

Liver tissue specimens were obtained every 2~3 days after partial hepatectomy and were investigated by HE staining and immunohistochemical staining for Brdu,OV6, cytokeratin-19, albumin, AFP, connexin-43 and C-kit. Oval cells were enriched by magnetic activated cell sorting(MACS) using C-kit antibody. RT-PCR was performed on sorted cells for the albumin,AFP and CK19 messenger RNA expression. Results: Obvious oval cell proliferation was seen in the liver in 10 mg/kg,15 mg/kg,20 mg/kg groups and oval cell Brdu incorporation test is positive. Oval cells expressed the specific marker OV6, hepatic cell marker albumin, biliary cell marker CK19 ,fetal liver cell marker AFP and connexin-43 as well as hematopoietic stem cell receptor C-kit. More than 90% sorted oval cells were OV6 positive and all expressed the albumin, AFP and CK19 gene. Conclusions: Rat model for hepatic oval cell proliferation can be established with 2-AAF/partial hepatectomy at dosage of 10~20 mg/kg body weight. And such oval cells were hepatic stem/progenitor cells which expressed OV6/CK19/albumin/AFP/connexin43/C-kit.

The corresponding Fano factor thus increases as sqrt[V].

These biotinylated proteins are subsequently purified and identified via mass spectrometry. Compared to other conventional methods typically used to screen strong PPIs, BioID allows for the detection of weak and transient interactions within a relevant biological setting over a defined period of time.

For a long time now the issue from a development policy point of view has no longer been around how to increase the quantity of investment inflows. The quality of FDI and the contribution they make to environment-friendly and inclusive growth processes is just as important. This is accompanied by a desire on the part of many developing countries to more strongly regulate their investment inflows in order to increase their positive effects on development. This shift in focus is not just a consequence of the disillusionment that many developing countries have experienced given the minor economic benefits stemming from the liberalization of their investment regimes in the 1980s and 1990s. It is also a result of the economic success of emerging countries which frequently do not implement these recommendations for liberalization one-on-one. Furthermore, the coherence of investment agreements also has to play a greater role in light of new systemic risks such as global finance and climate risks and increased interlinking between different areas of policy. Against this backdrop, the role and substance of international investment agreements (IIA) have been subject to intense discussion in recent times. IIAs were traditionally negotiated as tools to protect from western companies’ FDI in politically unstable developing countries. This one-sided focus for IIAs is no longer appropriate today: the global investment regime is in a period of change which calls the traditional North-South logic behind IIAs into question. It is no longer just North American, European and Japanese companies that invest abroad but also their Chinese, Brazilian and Indian competitors. The need for better consideration of public and private interests in IIAs is also growing in industrialized countries as a result of the increase in reciprocal investment flows. Against this background the European Union (EU) has implemented a far-reaching institutional reform of its Common Commercial Policy as a result of the Lisbon Treaty: negotiating European IIAs now falls under the overall competency of the EU and no longer just the Member States. This merging of trade and investment policy making at EU level provides new starting points for future IIAs to be drafted in a more development-friendly manner. Development policy actors should pay greater attention to this policy area in order to increase the potential for FDI to promote sustainable development processes. The formal options for pressing for greater coherence between investment and development policy have increased as a result of Lisbon. In order to use this room to manoeuvre more effectively developing countries need additional support to increase their negotiating capacities.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://edoc.vifapol.de/opus/volltexte/2013/4577/pdf/BP_12.2012.pdf"],"title":"What Opportunities Do the New EU International Investment Agreements Offer for Developing Countries","doi":"10.2139/ssrn.2182551","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.2182551","venue":""}

Such approaches frequently limit the parameters of these notions. The goal of this article is to reveal unique features of the culture and complex system of its interaction with the system of being. This article covers the ontologic status of culture, correlation of the material, ideal, and social in its universe. System, structural and functional methods, as well as the developing modeling method, exemplified by the philosophic concept of M. S. Kagan, is applied to study this issue more thoroughly. In addition, some provisions of his theory, as well as the modeling methods, can be further developed and complemented, while certain assumptions can be reconsidered allowing to make additional adjustments to the formation of objective knowledge about culture. This article analyzes the structural components of the ontologic system, including the being of the objective and individualized ideality, which was not specified by M.S. Kagan. It showed that this structural subdivision of the being produces ideas, ideals, and goals of a person and the society, being the main source of culture origins and development, the characteristic of its above-biological status in the universe, and the source of intelligent and value-oriented development. This article also reveals the culture as a complex system characterized by diversity of existence and the structure of being. However, culture is not only a part of the system of being; it also determines its diversity through the unique specifics of its forms and functional processes.

In this work, a facile approach is developed for scaling the production of SHBOI porous materials by the deposition of SHBIO PDMS-co-PMHS coating onto porous materials via a facile surface coating method without the use of nanoparticles and fluorinated compounds. Meanwhile, the PDMS-co-PMHS coating is constructed by hydrosilylation reaction between vinyl bonds of vinyl-terminated-poly(dimethylsiloxane) (VPDMS) and silicon-hydrogen bond of trimethylsilyl-terminated-poly-(dimethylsiloxane)-co-polymethylhydrosiloxane (TPDMS-co-PMHS), and simultaneously attached on various porous substrates including sponge (SP), fiber paper (FP), glass fiber (GF) membrane, etc. As a result, PDMS-co-PMHS coating provides SHBOI and excellent oil/water separation characteristics to the porous substrates. According to the results, PDMS-co-PMHS@SP possesses SHBOI characteristics, high oil-adsorption capacity (up to 143 times its original weight) and excellent recyclability. PDMS-co-PMHS@FP can efficiently separate a series of immiscible oil/water mixtures in a single-step based on its high oil or organic solvents fluxes (about 2000–3000 L.m−2.h−1) and SHBOI characteristics. In addition, PDMS-co-PMHS@GF membrane exhibits great water rejection (∼99.90%) for separating water-in-oil emulsions under gravity-driven condition. Thus, a new strategy employing PDMS-co-PMHS as a coating material to modify porous substrates has great potential for developing a scalable method of fabricating SHBOI porous materials for oil/water separation.","inCitations":["14796894b6391a189990bdc6e4f06fb072947781","76524b239e1465f60dd3f396b1d678c6284ec8c8"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Facile and scalable fabrication of superhydrophobic and superoleophilic PDMS-co-PMHS coating on porous substrates for highly effective oil/water separation","doi":"10.1016/j.cej.2018.10.097","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2018.10.097","venue":""}

Here, we sought to investigate the efficacy and safety of oral vinorelbine and cisplatin plus concomitant chemo-radiotherapy in treating stage III NSCLC patients. Methods: A prospective, open-label, single-arm clinical trial was performed during January 2010 to September 2016. Patients were treated with two cycles of chemotherapy with intravenous cisplatin 60 mg/m on day 1 and oral vinorelbine 50 mg/m on days 1, 8 and day 15, and radiotherapy was administrated concurrently since the day 1 when chemotherapy started. A total dose of 66 Gy radiotherapy was delivered in daily fractions of 2 Gy for 6.5–7 consecutive weeks. Tumor response will be assessed after completing 2 cycle of concomitant treatment, and patients were referred to surgery or consolidation therapy based on the assessment. Results: Fifty-eight patients were enrolled and analyzed, 31 of the 56 patients had stage IIIA and the other 27 had stage IIIB NSCLC. Thirtysix patients had partial response (PR)to the therapy and the overall response rate was 62.1%. The median progression free survival (PFS) was 6.73 months and median overall survival (OS) was 24.83 months. Seventeen patients received surgery after induction concurrent chemoradiation therapy (CCRT), and the median PFS was 25.67 months for patients received surgery. For safety, no adverse effects related mortality was recorded in this trial, and 20 patients ever experienced grade 3&4 neutropenia, and only one patient had febrile neutropenia. Forty-eight patients finally had complete treatment course of this trial, and the complete rate was 82.6%. Conclusion: Concurrent chemoradiotherapy with the regimen of weekly oral vinorelbine plus triweekly cisplatin was an effective treatment for stage III NSCLC patients. Most patients in this study tolerated the treatment well and had complete treatment courses. The safety profile was also acceptable for patients.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Oral Vinorelbine and Cisplatin plus Concomitant Chemo‐radiotherapy as Induction Therapy in Stage Iii Non‐small Cell Lung Carcinoma: Results of a Multi‐center Phase Ii Tial","doi":"10.1111/resp.13420_574","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1111/resp.13420_574","venue":""}

Extensions of these methods lead to statistical estimation algorithms which are not only fast, scalable, and useful on real data sets, but are also provably correct. Following this line of research, we make two contributions. First, we propose a set of spectral algorithms for text analysis and natural language processing. In particular, we propose fast and scalable spectral algorithms for learning word embeddings -low dimensional real vectors (called Eigenwords) that capture the “meaning” of words from their context. Second, we show how similar spectral methods can be applied to analyzing brain images. State-of-the-art approaches to learning word embeddings are slow to train or lack theoretical grounding; We propose three spectral algorithms that overcome these limitations. All three algorithms harness the multi-view nature of text data i.e. the left and right context of each word, and share three characteristics: 1). They are fast to train and are scalable. 2). They have strong theoretical properties. 3). They can induce context-specific embeddings i.e. different embedding for “river bank” or “Bank of America”. \\end{enumerate} They also have lower sample complexity and hence higher statistical power for rare words. We provide theory which establishes relationships between these algorithms and optimality criteria for the estimates they provide. We also perform thorough qualitative and quantitative evaluation of Eigenwords and demonstrate their superior performance over state-of-the-art approaches. Next, we turn to the task of using spectral learning methods for brain imaging data. This dissertation is available at ScholarlyCommons: http://repository.upenn.edu/edissertations/1257 Methods like Sparse Principal Component Analysis (SPCA), Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) and Independent Component Analysis (ICA) have been used to obtain state-of-the-art accuracies in a variety of problems in machine learning. However, their usage in brain imaging, though increasing, is limited by the fact that they are used as out-of-the-box techniques and are seldom tailored to the domain specific constraints and knowledge pertaining to medical imaging, which leads to difficulties in interpretation of results. In order to address the above shortcomings, we propose Eigenanatomy (EANAT), a general framework for sparse matrix factorization. Its goal is to statistically learn the boundaries of and connections between brain regions by weighing both the data and prior neuroanatomical knowledge. Although EANAT incorporates some neuroanatomical prior knowledge in the form of connectedness and smoothness constraints, it can still be difficult for clinicians to interpret the results in specific domains where network-specific hypotheses exist. We thus extend EANAT and present a novel framework for priorconstrained sparse decomposition of matrices derived from brain imaging data, called Prior Based Eigenanatomy (p-Eigen). We formulate our solution in terms of a prior-constrained l1 penalized (sparse) principal component analysis. Experimental evaluation confirms that p-Eigen extracts biologically-relevant, patient-specific functional parcels and that it significantly aids classification of Mild Cognitive Impairment when compared to state-of-the-art competing approaches.

If the extra particle is the Higgs boson, this hypothesis might also explain — statistical fluctuations aside — why the CMS search for W H resonances in the semi-leptonic channel finds some excess while in the fully hadronic one it does not have a significant deviation.","inCitations":["a5e08780a02ba86faa1442379f0175fb60734426","51ad8ffe382b4a39bb0854160f6aaad62ed73d85","5a9d904cf5e561b67dcb26acd09991eb9c855e8a","2ce6f6949c94219aeda7472ba998e34284c87cf0","14d6e61920e3118bb044458a28b9d5db192076ba","6211d351d6dcde7b609bb7641652e18d4f54548e","d0f34621c783189e4b0e3a10009294c9a3114270","9fe5397752a44c6f40d047ea9d4465590ea0dbd0","a5171494665d60cdffa3ef1bd6b883d471a50127"],"pdfUrls":["https://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.06739v3.pdf"],"title":"Triboson interpretations of the ATLAS diboson excess","doi":"10.1007/JHEP10(2015)099","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/JHEP10%282015%29099","venue":""}

BMBF 2000a); er ist jedoch keineswegs konfliktfrei, da Sozialisation nicht nur mit der Ubernahme gesellschaftlicher Wertvorstellungen, sondern auch mit Spannungen zwischen den Lebensvorstellungen und Handlungsinteressen der Generationen zu tun hat. Im industriegesellschaftlichen Modell bedeutet Jugend eine Phase der Sozialisation, die auf den Lebenslauf durch den Erwerb von Kompetenzen fur Arbeit, Beruf und burgerschaftliche Beteiligung vorbereitet. Diese Kompetenzen sind zusammen mit Wertorientierungen Bausteine fur die psychosoziale Identitat und den gesellschaftlichen Status der Person. Die Vorbereitung auf die Arbeitswelt hat aber auch mit den Bildungschancen, der Lage auf dem Arbeitsmarkt, den Entwicklungstendenzen von Wirtschaft und Technik und nicht zuletzt mit dem Bevolkerungswachstum zu tun. Die gesellschaftliche Modernisierung seit den 1960er Jahren, die als Individualisierungsschub (Beck 1986) mit abnehmender Verbindlichkeit konventioneller Alters- und Geschlechternormen und zunehmenden Risiken auf dem Arbeitsmarkt einhergeht, hat die „Lebensphase Jugend“ (Hurrelmann 1997) zu einer ausgedehnten, in sich widerspruchlichen Ubergangsperiode im Lebenslauf gemacht.","inCitations":["9d24060dd6d532bd6d7fe425f6e820baec82e73a"],"pdfUrls":["https://dbk.gesis.org/dbksearch/download.asp?db=E&id=43145"],"title":"Jugend, Ausbildung und Beruf","doi":"10.1007/978-3-322-85154-3_26","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-322-85154-3_26","venue":""}

The mass reoccurred 3 additional times in the same location despite surgical removal and cryogenic therapy. On the fourth surgical resection, strontium-90 radiotherapy was applied to the site immediately after the surgical procedure.

Nevadans with disabilities were significantly more likely to engage in some preventative services (pneumonia and flu vaccination) and less likely to engage in other preventative services (pap in the past three years and dental cleaning in the past year). This may be the result of some preventative services being easily administered to patients whether they have disabilities or not (immunizations) while other preventative services are more difficult to administer to those with disabilities.

Pantoprazole must be absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract and because it is unstable under acidic conditions, enteric delivery systems are required. The purpose of this study was to prepare Pantoprazole loaded microbeads by ionotropic gelation technique using sodium alginate and natural Mucoadhesive substance from the fruit of Dillenia indica followed by a coating with Eudragit L100-55. The microspheres have been characterized in terms of their morphology, particle size, encapsulation efficiency, swelling ratio, mucoadhesivity and ability of stabilizing Pantoprazole in acidic media.

Numerical simulations show that the developing filamentation results in the shock formation accompanied by ion deceleration and efficient electron heating. Similar heating efficiency was found in periodic numerical simulations which indicates similar mechanisms for both systems. Yet, the mechanism of the electron energization has not been identified so far. Here a new simple model of electron acceleration in filamentary relativistic shocks is presented. We suggest that the large-scale inductive electric field, generated in the course of the filamentary instability, is responsible for ion deceleration and electron energization within the filaments. Acceleration of electrons along the filaments is due to the electric field alignment with the filaments, while isotropization is due to the magnetic scattering, broadband nature of the instability and continuous growth of the dominant scale of the magnetic field. This electron heating is a nonstationary effect and occurs as long as the filaments keep growing.","inCitations":["29e81565d11e4c2927a8309e9920aeb67d48cffc","f30775aeb2df05e8b9a94ab41474f6f44b7ea70c","006fb02da14f7aa19a34af068eba2ca990885385","cf274557e9779cc5b5764fae7f43b1f241ae0df2"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Electron heating by filamentary instability","doi":"10.1209/0295-5075/97/35002","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1209/0295-5075%2F97%2F35002","venue":""}

It is proved that all involved signals are ensured bounded, and the size of tracking error can be reduced as small as desired even for relatively frequent packet dropout.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Adaptive Control of Nonlinear Networked Systems With Quantized Inputs and Packet Dropouts","doi":"10.23919/ChiCC.2019.8865955","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.23919/ChiCC.2019.8865955","venue":"2019 Chinese Control Conference (CCC)"}

It is still not known what leads to the relapse or the emergence of metastasis in individual patients. To contribute to answer this question, we investigated the evolutionary patterns in squamous cell carcinoma of the lung (SCC) in 10 patients with multiple matched tumors (primary vs recurrence/metastasis). Methods: To identify the genomic profile, frozen tissues from SCC patients were subjected to multiparameter ploidy profiling (MPP). Tumor populations were sorted based on ploidy (DNA-content using DAPI) and p40 was used to control for diploid tumor populations. Subsequent genomic profiling by array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) and targeted massive parallel sequencing (Ion Torrent Comprehensive Cancer Panel with an all-exon coverage of 409 cancer genes) was applied. Results: The usage of MPP enabled the determination of the clonal composition of the SCC and define genomic characteristics. Due to flow sorting the tumor populations were effectively isolated and existence of distinct clonal populations was indicated. Aneuploid and diploid tumors were successfully revealed using the additional marker p40. Therefore, the absence of non-malignant cells increased the precision in the genomic analyses Conclusion: The study uncovered the composition of human SCC in the sense of different clonal populations, which harbor private genomic aberrations and mutations confirmed by aCGH and NGS. Even if our data is still preliminary we provide evidence that applying MPP increases the precision of aCGH and sequencing analysis. Genomic analyses of sorted pure tumor population allows to reconstruct the clonal evolution and facilitates the understanding of tumor heterogeneity and their evolutionary pattern, which could have potentially an impact on therapeutic response or metastasis development.

Webster","ids":["104364087"]}],"journalName":"","paperAbstract":"The problems Malaria in Thailand-emergence of drug resistance Although the prevalence of malaria in Thailand today is greatly Reduced ·compared to 30 years ago the threat from malaria remains persistent and serious. In 1947 the mortality rate for malaria was 297.1 deaths per 100,000 population making mal aria the leading cause of death in Thailand. By 1980 the malaria death rate had dropped to 8.1 per 100,000. Still there were 395,442 cases of malaria detected in 1980 and 473,210 in 1981 (1). It is not, however, in the number of current cases or deaths due to Malaria that the present threat from malaria is defined. Rather the Malaria threat comes with the persistent emergence of drug resistance in Thailand and most other malarious regions of the world. Resistance to the antimalarial drug chloroquine by p. Falciparum was first reported in Thailand by Harinasuta and colleagues in 1962 (2). By 1967 it was apparent that chloroquine resistance was a widespread and serious problem in Thailand (3, 4). During the period 1965-1971 clinical trials were begun in Thailand on various alternative therapies (both single and combination drug treatment regimens) to deal with the problem of chloroquine resistance (4, 5). These s~udies produced basically 3 alternative treatments: quinine, quinine combined with tetracycline, and pyrimethamines  ulfonamide combinations. The combination of pyrimethamine with sulfadoxine (fansidar) was initially shown to be particularly effective against chloroquine resistant p. Falciparum (6). However, it was apparent by 1975 that the long-use prospect for pyrimethamine-sulfadoxine was doubtful and over the ensuing 5 year period the cure rate fell from 80% in 1976 to 10% in 1980 (7). Other studies in thailand have confirmed the loss in effectiveness of pyrimethamine - sulfadoxine for resistant p. Falciparum Malaria (8, 9, 10, 35). As of 1982 there remained but one conventional antimalarial Drug for the treatment of multi-drug resistant  p. Falciparum  malaria in Thailand-quinine or a quinine-tetracycline combination. The use of Quinine in combination with tetracycline speaks to the heart of the issue Of drug-resistance since quinine itself has been decreasing in effectiveness. Studies at the Bangkok hospital for tropical diseases have shown a progressive decrease in the cure rate for quinine : 94% (1963 - 1979), 86% (1979 - 1980) and 80% (1981) (7). In a recent study pinichpongse and colleagues (1982) (35) observed an overall cure rate of 90% for a 7-day course of quinine in patients from five geographically separate areas of Thailand. Thus, what was once an impressive arsenal of antimalarial drugs for use against p. Falciparum malaria has now been reduced to one perhaps faltering survivor, quinine, bolstered somewhat by its combination with tetracycline. As for prophylaxis against p. Falciparum there are no remaining conventional drugs of choice that can be prescribed with confidence. Only the advent of the new antimalarial drug mefloquine makes matters seem less than disastrous. Even the prospects with mefloquine, as we shall discuss, are not without serious concern. It should be noted that the situation with p. Vivax malaria is comparatively good. Chloroquine in combination with primaquine is effective for prophylaxis and treatment of p. Vivax malaria in thailand (7).","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Antimalarial Drug Resistance: Problems and Prospects","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Between 2000 and 2004 the network was extended to incorporate a newly designed bioindicator network of tobacco plants (Nicotiana tabacum Bel W3). The objective was to set-up an integrated monitoring system to obtain estimates of ground-level O3 concentrations over the whole study area (3513 km2) in order to fill data gaps and cover reporting requirements. The existing conventional monitors were purposefully located mainly in urban areas. A total of 45 biomonitoring sites were selected using a systematic design to cover the target area. Two to five additional biomonitoring sites were co-located with conventional O3 analysers for calibration purposes, and five more sites for independent validation of modelled O3 concentrations. Visible Leaf Injury Index (LII) on the tobacco plants was significantly correlated (P: 0.018/0.0014) with a series of O3 exposure variables (mean of weekly 1-hour maxima, M1; mean of 7-hour means, M7; 24-hour mean, M24; and weekly AOT40). LII was found to be a significant predictor of weekly means of the O3 exposure variables with a standard error of estimates between 13.6 and 24.3 microg m(-3) (absolute values). LII was mapped with an ad-hoc spatial model over the study area at a 22 km grid resolution, and mapped values were used to predict O3 concentrations by means of a first order linear model. Results showed that high estimates of O3 (up to 188 microg m(-3) as mean of weekly maxima, M1) occurred more frequently in hilly and mountainous areas, with a spatial pattern changing on an annual basis. Predicted O3 concentrations were not significantly different from the measured concentrations (P: 0.34), although marked differences were observed for individual sites and years. The study provided evidence that integration of monitoring networks using different methods can be a viable option to obtain estimates of O3 concentrations over large areas.","inCitations":["7724745ed0edd9c4f22bd75ef7a57e8a8bfa10e9","b6b6f157c4a62b9c0cdd5dc723f93fdb8cd9bb00","4a90eeab01b1d3c9a23b6ce8e9ac3dd179f2ca7c"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Integrating monitoring networks to obtain estimates of ground-level ozone concentrations --a proof of concept in Tuscany (central Italy).","doi":"10.1016/j.scitotenv.2008.02.019","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2008.02.019","venue":"The Science of the total environment"}

The developed system can be used for simultaneous determination of three basic parameters important for evaluating the deterioration of high-voltage insulation materials, i.e., conductivity, dielectric constant, and charge accumulation. Charge accumulation, which is detrimental to high-voltage dc electrical apparatuses, such as power devices, transformers, and power cables, can be evaluated using this system. With this system, the charges accumulated are measured by integrating the current through a capacitor inserted between the highvoltage power source and the high-voltage apparatus to be tested. The obtained information is transmitted to the unit placed at ground potential. The evaluation is carried out by comparing the amount of initial charges in the insulating material with that of charges accumulated at a certain time after application of a high voltage. When the ratio of the charges accumulated at time (t) to that of the initial charge is 1, it is assumed that there was no charge accumulation; thus, no deterioration of the insulating material is assumed. However, when the ratio is greater than 1, the insulating material is considered to have deteriorated. Using the evaluation system, we developed, we examined the deterioration of insulating materials used in coaxial cables by exposure to 1) γ-rays and 2) high-temperature conditions. From these two experiments using the developed system, the deterioration of insulating materials was found to have advanced substantially when the charge accumulation ratio exceeded approximately over 2.0.","inCitations":["428ff8637ab5b0640c5118238424d38813fe4997","491700c38d661859333e23bdd1fc78d4303bbe35","d3b7392015b940dae18b75646c3b00d77a082596","70f66897983151eaee7f9e463e29783c5c0550ff","c28d41e05a118732d9664fa779ef5ecb553fb575","ec9184023ef1be69150678276b93a4a585196997","7e5723ff895e070d31afa8c0928e9d2f2fb2ae79","d8fd7da64600dc0eab8ef7d69bee1a1d284f2746"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"New diagnostic method of electrical insulation properties based on current integration","doi":"10.1109/TDEI.2017.006355","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TDEI.2017.006355","venue":"IEEE Transactions on Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation"}

The sensor is fabricated from bulk lead zirconate titanate (PZT) using a customized process. Micro electro-discharge machining is used to form a steel tool that is subsequently used for batch-mode ultrasonic machining of bulk PZT ceramic. The resulting sensor is 50 µ m thick and 200 µ m in diameter. Devices were tested in materials that mimic the texture of human tissue in the training of physicians, and were separately tested with porcine fat and muscle tissue. The magnitude and frequency of a resonant peak shows tissue-specific characteristics as the needle is inserted into tissue. For example, in the porcine tissue sample, the magnitude and peak frequency respectively change from ≈2118 Ω and ≈163 MHz to ≈562 Ω and ≈150 MHz as the needle moves from fat to muscle tissue.","inCitations":["257aa3361cec09ac43cdb24535ed871f0aff4310","4f40be7838043ce01d4e3b113912561c151c928e","cc0298caa6adcbc57166a42bb00e8d38cd08bc2d"],"pdfUrls":["http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~yogesh/pdfs/conferencepapers/MEMS06_Biopsy%20Needle.pdf"],"title":"A Bulk PZT Microsensor for In-Situ Tissue Contrast Detection During Fine Needle Aspiration Biopsy of Thyroid Nodules","doi":"10.1109/MEMSYS.2006.1627724","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MEMSYS.2006.1627724","venue":"19th IEEE International Conference on Micro Electro Mechanical Systems"}

These automorphisms can be used as gluing conditions in the study of boundary conditions for tensor product theories. We present an ansatz for such permutation boundary states and check that it satisfies the cluster condition and Cardy’s constraints. For a particularly simple case, we also investigate associativity of the boundary OPE, and find an intriguing connection with the bulk OPE. In the second part of the paper, the constructions are slightly extended for application to Gepner models. We give permutation branes for the quintic, together with some formulae for their intersections. In memory of Sonia Stanciu 1. Introductory remarks Thanks to the pioneering work by Cardy [1,2] and to further, more recent developments (see e.g. [3-8]), we have a reasonably complete understanding of a certain class of boundary conditions for rational conformal field theories. This class is distinguished by an especially simple relation between the form of the bulk partition function and the gluing automorphism Ω that connects leftand right-moving symmetry generators W (z) = Ω W (z̄) for z = z̄ : If the rational bulk theory comes with a charge-conjugate modular invariant partition function Z(q, q̄) = ∑ i∈I χi(q) χi+(q) ∗ , it is the standard gluing condition Ω = id that leads to a simple picture of boundary conditions, basically because all Ishibashi states that can be formed for standard gluing conditions are actually present in the bulk theory. The same is true for general Ω as long as, in the bulk partition function Z(q, q̄), each sector i is paired with ω(i) instead of the charge-conjugate sector i, where ω(i) labels the representation of the symmetry algebra W induced in the sector i by the action of Ω. The boundary states associated with this class of boundary conditions are often referred to as “Cardy boundary states”. Non-standard gluing conditions (for bulk theories whose partition function is not of the appropriate ω-type) are of crucial importance in string theory, starting with Dirichlet boundary conditions for free bosons. The non-trivial automorphisms Ω available for the gluing conditions of a rational CFT of course depend on the symmetry algebra W of the model. But there is a simple and natural construction that yields, from a given rational model, new ones on which universal automorphism groups act – namely taking tensor products of the original “component theory”. While this operation alone does not produce very exciting effects in the domain of bulk theories, the structure of associated boundary CFTs is much richer: The set of all boundary conditions for an N -fold tensor product, even those that preserve the full symmetry, is not simply obtained by forming tensor products of boundary conditions for the component theory, but includes boundary conditions associated with gluing automorphisms from the permutation group SN . In this paper, we present general formulae for such “permutation boundary states”, first focusing on situations where the original RCFT has a charge-conjugate (or, if all sectors are self-conjugate, a diagonal) partition function. The permutation boundary states are still “rational” in the sense that the boundary CFT is covariant under the full symmetry algebra W , but we will see that the excitation (or open string) spectra of permutation branes in general look rather different from those of tensor products of Cardy states. Our work generalises studies of permutation branes in G × G WZW models [9]. On the other hand, our boundary states are special cases of the “conformal walls” that appeared in [10]: while a general conformal wall is nothing but a symmetry-breaking conformal boundary condition for a tensor product model (not necessarily with identical factors), our permutation branes can be viewed as walls with perfect transmission (or reflection) of energy between (or within) the identical component theories.","inCitations":["efeae982193073340defa50e805b0bf85fff66c5","23d58307ea469e215404b8ea0e8207eb9b4d6fe4"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.esi.ac.at/preprints/esi1193.ps","http://arxiv.org/pdf/hep-th/0208119v1.pdf"],"title":"Permutation Branes","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

each other in research on occupational stress. Qualitative methods include eliciting from workers unconstrained descriptions of work experiences, careful first-hand observations of the workplace, and participant-observers describing “from the inside” a particular work experience. The chapter shows how qualitative research plays a role in (a) stimulating theory development, (b) generating hypotheses, (c) identifying heretofore researcher-neglected job stressors and coping responses, (d) explaining difficult-to-interpret quantitative findings, and (e) providing rich descriptions of stressful transactions. Extensive examples from research on job stress in teachers are used. The limitations of qualitative research, particularly in the area of verification, are also described.","inCitations":["1238d940600edf77a33805a38073260f018372f9","b9c0e1a91e33d75bca1151eaae4e213980b89efd","8338734065175116ce9574e389e0b91192a99166","32fb69f0ce6ff0dfb6856a922055ea8fcbf5a9e4","d513668a67e7e7ab160586d27b9199dc6b8e0591","bd6964b322bffd165a9d4572aa42387b4a9cd3be","c819ea631cae90c07dccbf107213db1be619f476","0c53afe41209e1b242441745f20157c6c72ff75e","f08f24f8d0c31a38e67d3ae999bf14e80558a1e4","10a386fe8fb26cdfb23d9c1f80e0f8f40d498451","479a2425fffc01b4f5eb8c5a1d1d0d7cf9ebde08","1d93ed83f1490de2e0f03f20091b72d3e12193ad","f863e9f9151939172f8fb7cdcddcab5e0fe1322e","e05af65683d6a94c724f9ec62d34a3e4271d18d3","d7ceed053a73209ab01c3a34969844f76e205f7f","5b088ddbce735a444c3ffdc351b6750c15f150c8","351a0c347e47cb03de23a61124355a6a225f00a6","ab49c672528e05d3650036f44ce707e6975ef35e","c82342c55092a663891423a864b6df1291a29835","7b6a608982faaa08d4755fff1f7978e960a24fa0","ed709b7874414b2e6bd2d1c681917b0ad11f7ddd","d1ec6ecb5f37df77caceefd654d5d7a25c45f264"],"pdfUrls":["https://www.ccny.cuny.edu/sites/default/files/Schonfeld-and-Farrell-2010-Qualitative-methods.pdf"],"title":"Qualitative Methods Can Enrich Quantitative Research on Occupational Stress: An Example from One Occupational Group.","doi":"10.1108/S1479-3555(2010)0000008007","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1108/S1479-3555%282010%290000008007","venue":""}
