In part one, we use a model of migration probabilities to identify socioeconomic factors that explain the observed interregional migration flows. In part two, we use an adjustment process for our regional population system to calculate equilibrium population distributions. The estimated migration probabilities of part one are essential for this calculation, thus linking equilibria with the socioeconomic factors previously identified. Disequilibrium, defined as the difference between observed and equilibrium population distributions, is then used to infer relative growth and decline tendencies in the system. We examine and justify our results in the larger context of contemporary Canadian history.","inCitations":["4b29b7d46994528e91374dcad131a8f0a0816590","c5281e93370c90330ce480a1cf63338d98905c1c"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"An Analysis of Migration Streams for the Canadian Regional System, 1952–1983 1.

It also provides an overview of a historical development of spatial data infrastructures in Russia and in the world. Based on an analysis of a historical landscape within the challenging area, authors have identified the following system components of SDIs: users and professionals, data, technologies, standards, regulatory frameworks, and institutional procedures. There is a proposed platform solution architecture to build SDI, summarized in a form of a structure-component scheme. It rests upon the hypothesis that in order to optimize spatial data storage and application-related processes, the project-oriented SDI needs to include loosely bound and closely bound subsystems for spatial data storage (cloud or local storages), analysis and synthesis modules, as well as modules for visualization and distribution of spatial data (as geoportal systems).","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Разработка Проектно-ориентированной Инфраструктуры Пространственных Данных С Применением Облачных Технологий","doi":"10.21778/2413-9599-2019-29-3-79-90","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.21778/2413-9599-2019-29-3-79-90","venue":""}

Most importantly, we also set out to (3) investigate whether measures are equivalent, that is, whether a comparison of means and relationships across cultural groups is possible with the employed scales. Data were collected in six countries (N = 1099). We obtained only metric invariance for the self-esteem and honor scales, allowing for comparisons of relationships across samples, but not scale means. Partly confirming theoretical ideas on the importance of internal and external components of self-esteem, we found that only external rather than both external and internal self-esteem was relatively more important for overall self-esteem in ‘honor cultures’, in a ‘dignity’ culture internal self-esteem was relatively more important than external self-esteem. Contrary to expectations, in a ‘face’ culture internal self-esteem was relatively more important than external self-esteem. We were not able to conceptually replicate earlier reported relationships between components of self-esteem and the concern for honor, as we observed no cultural differences in the relationship between self-esteem and honor. We point towards the need for future studies to consider invariance testing in the field of honor to appropriately understand differences and similarities between samples.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Replication Data for: Assessing the importance of internal and external self-esteem and their relationship to honor concerns in six countries.","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

However, each of the dielectric material has its own advantages and limitations therefore it is important to select the best possible candidate. For this purpose, Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) as a Multiple Attribute Decision Making (MADM) technique is used. Based on the ranking derived from TOPSIS, it is found that La2O3 is the most suitable material, followed by Y2O3 for being used as a gate dielectric in Ge‐based CMOS devices.

cause enterocolitis, while Yersinia pestis is responsible for pneumonic, bubonic, and septicaemic plague. All three share an infection strategy that relies on a virulence factor arsenal to enable them to enter, adhere to, and colonise the host while evading host defences to avoid untimely clearance. Their arsenal includes a number of adhesins that allow the invading pathogens to establish a foothold in the host and to adhere to specific tissues later during infection. When the host innate immune system has been activated, all three pathogens produce a structure analogous to a hypodermic needle. In conjunction with the translocon, which forms a pore in the host membrane, the channel that is formed enables the transfer of six 'effector' proteins into the host cell cytoplasm. These proteins mimic host cell proteins but are more efficient than their native counterparts at modifying the host cell cytoskeleton, triggering the host cell suicide response. Such a sophisticated arsenal ensures that yersiniae maintain the upper hand despite the best efforts of the host to counteract the infecting pathogen.","inCitations":["bdc32e1c1c47ceb8d61119b2adc58845de88b6f0","220d8b66283a02a0ae0f6108fbc174a0d8645a5d","5c08bdb156b42d5d6a33e9fdb6af2995d7989796","85c57f3fa87d8225110b49102b645ee7a32e8ca6","78e4fa0d1cf08ba0871a0d7b8f2c5c35181e4fa1","228384474818a9e847848aff97a2a8e8b40ecf1c","afb9f931276232ba9890fc23da90738c4ea6e239","89be12f6d73c854ab42f57e149b981157d5395da","8c4d00db2f4d661add74649b5f5b0fd50cc02e22","1c4718f4ed218bfc873f05ad2ccda415043d6b9b","2c3421908ef17d59626e8e5037d78e3e4baa056a","d819e67f4c778f1b9399ba7b383d8624bc641efe","c286d46ca67c73ad6cb5d1fc778c8ba51713016a","9734162ff89f9e48443f5700f32977121031f805","c53a1bcc1c5e2a242f91ce678797f46db13464c5","2cb1a471e9f1ba5fe1623c8143f8847c0b12dbe6","5f33f497f28bbc026bb07285fc7aa6101e7b8ac4","e5802f18cb6d987afc384f46a2edf0e2cf75185f","34340d710fbf8f0c938097b375365e0ae736936e","ba83e8cbc217bf0e82981577a859cfbdc256c9a6"],"pdfUrls":["https://f1000researchdata.s3.amazonaws.com/manuscripts/9116/67aa8431-12c2-45b8-92f7-84a531beb68b_8466_-_steve_atkinson.pdf?doi=10.12688/f1000research.8466.1","https://f1000researchdata.s3.amazonaws.com/manuscripts/9116/e71b5685-ad44-4311-90c1-0874da1369ce_8466_-_steve_atkinson.pdf?doi=10.12688/f1000research.8466.1&numberOfBrowsableCollections=17&numberOfBrowsableGateways=22&numberOfBrowsableInstitutionalCollections=4","https://f1000researchdata.s3.amazonaws.com/manuscripts/9116/4b705f6e-6459-4d0c-ba2c-939e2073837d_8466_-_steve_atkinson.pdf?doi=10.12688/f1000research.8466.1&numberOfBrowsableCollections=14&numberOfBrowsableGateways=22","https://f1000researchdata.s3.amazonaws.com/manuscripts/9116/77d26784-b27e-42f8-8706-d9c7bc26dea3_8466_-_steve_atkinson.pdf?doi=10.12688/f1000research.8466.1&numberOfBrowsableCollections=17&numberOfBrowsableGateways=23"],"title":"Yersinia virulence factors - a sophisticated arsenal for combating host defences","doi":"10.12688/f1000research.8466.1","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.12688/f1000research.8466.1","venue":"F1000Research"}

As part of this effort, NASA established the Principal Center for Regulatory Risk Analysis and Communication (RRAC PC) as a resource for detecting, analyzing, and communicating environmental regulatory risks to the NASA stakeholder community. The RRAC PC focuses on detecting emerging environmental regulations and other operational change drivers that may pose risks to NASA programs and facilities, and effectively communicating the potential risks. For example, regulatory change may restrict how and where certain activities or operations may be conducted. Regulatory change can also directly affect the ability to use certain materials by mandating a production phase-out or restricting usage applications of certain materials. Regulatory change can result in significant adverse impacts to NASA programs and facilities due to NASA's stringent performance requirements for materials and components related to human-rated space vehicles. Even if a regulation does not directly affect NASA operations, U.S. and international regulations can pose program risks indirectly through requirements levied on manufacturers and vendors of components and materials. For example, manufacturers can change their formulations to comply with new regulatory requirements. Such changes can require time-consuming and costly requalification certification for use in human spaceflight programs. The RRAC PC has implemented a system for proactively managing regulatory change to minimize potential adverse impacts to NASA programs and facilities. This presentation highlights the process utilized by the RRACPC to communicate regulatory change and the associated potential risks within NASA, as well as the process for communicating and cooperating with other government agencies and industry partners, both domestic and international, to ensure mission success.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Mission Risk Reduction Regulatory Change Management","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

This study aimed to identify the intrinsic molecular mechanisms underlying drug resistance in BM-DTCs. We used in vivo selection of the human HNSCC cell line HEp3, which mimics non-proliferative BM-DTCs in mice, to establish BM-DTC-derived (BM-HEp3) and lung metastases-derived (Lu-HEp3) sublines. Both sublines had higher migration activity and shortened survival in a murine xenograft model compared with parental (P-HEp3) cells. Slow-cycling BM-HEp3 cells had intrinsically enhanced cisplatin resistance compared with Lu-HEp3 cells, which also manifested this resistance but proliferated rapidly. The drug resistance and slow-cycling state of BM-HEp3 cells depended on enhanced positive feedback of the signaling axis of stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1)-C-X-C chemokine receptor-4 (CXCR4) via their overexpression. Interestingly, BM-DTCs highly expressed transforming growth factor-beta 2 (TGF-β2) to maintain SDF-1-CXCR4 overexpression. Inhibition of SDF-1-CXCR4 signaling by down-regulating TGF-β2 fully reversed the drug resistance of BM-HEp3 cells via reactivation of cell proliferation. These data suggest that the intrinsic TGF-β2-triggered SDF-1-CXCR4 signaling axis is crucial for drug resistance dependent on a slow-cycling state in BM-DTCs.","inCitations":["fd68eaa1739d9c8e6f8d626e7aaa2db2fba4e1aa","731563b815abb174d0ccfd85cdc18cfe9d78a93d","7dd9854439b39862902f2e4928e227beca9bd59d","e65f490c4e8357919f69db08a0ccb69abbd186a5","49c713a5d61a4849f482bcca2fc6cdb311671ec3","0969cfb6f17e07e9215b1f530a56fa9a2acacf4a","6d847eab5ac519d5cc68f142b41c5d1c0e22e287","4570bdc59a8457816b21f3ee1e81419dd79227de","fc81f0e0742b012e00da194c0a9f99e92803d270","6d5538bc64abdad64955f1e741e5ab722d7f5784","2b38bab2f670ba15e78ab1b35e06f7c36cdf7ab1","43b6b27b406329b079070a6403d7aa7a1072adc0","c31e141b05169335eebf973dec61354da5ff8a35","05c2b13145cac660bb8334ae958ee9e22088b7dc"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget/index.php?journal=oncotarget&op=download&page=article&path%5B%5D=2826&path%5B%5D=5376"],"title":"Intrinsic TGF-β2-triggered SDF-1-CXCR4 signaling axis is crucial for drug resistance and a slow-cycling state in bone marrow-disseminated tumor cells","doi":"10.18632/oncotarget.2826","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.18632/oncotarget.2826","venue":"Oncotarget"}

Under the single price contract, we show that whether a firm reveals its private information depends on the quality (variance) and the correlation of the two firms' information and the other firm's information revelation behavior. For the case that one firm (the retailer or the supplier) has complete information on the demand, the equilibrium is that the firm with complete information conceals its information and another reveals its information. Finally, we show that revenue sharing contract is coordinative, which ensures that both firms share their information completely and the retailer chooses the sale quantity which maximizes the total profit of the supply chain. This study shows that the members in a supply chain must sign coordinative contract in order to ensure that they share their information.","inCitations":["26cd9c1215850a8f7c9a5f034d72bce6d803a5d3","f7f3f44d9a82d59de255d45ec4b4a0ddf35da4ae","d322617d47529495ab7bd64870a3415866c07007","dde9784697a1eaae55c2d7255882cf735adba261","8dbcb25e6e097619e8a2cee25e91f9f325ebf46e","ddc436759b0dcccc62ee090eb84dce389dc756a7","e7014026bbd8680ee0c3b3819b26980cc052fcac","1426a92216e5f19f406c83a534f2b5734fa4e043","829a3d801f4cd80f23cefd16c3c535e21fdb1024","35892ca6403f0982c81e1c7afd4c0cd7169d761c","3e3f20dc502e8c38f2652d1e0f0753bd27018681","d3834891c2d597938384b30f19ad42cb033e1fd5","fa27304f24196e4cf152b26806655fe14ad10317","608b615f4be9537be247af741d2baa13a4b600d9","9b41e36e31371dce35816d4470adde6aac402393","d11c043321b100e0d2590aba8456635ad15640bc","58ab8b95389e8eeb597bf4f05235a652999b3d66","aa6790f567fd9f3a4f7730100096662788aa93c3","da2afd35388ce8aa45e509d2facf9beb912cec13","b926755f5ff8db9a0e6fcf4409f905cd5030668f","19de7b3d69fd444541a61fbecfcdb39213865b30","82e666a9f58c24f3b930e8090c92aa38ac960958","a981bb9d7e27c34c0961c5dbbb01c0362979eca7","f85e30850d94a8d07d7cd1d02bcf50dbb4d98e3e","0eb3f008bb5d0b5a2f7f5d29faaa58b8275143e4","4980f83793391f53c57db77d0852a08608cef7f4","6846004623a19a36995d4b099eea94ea811b9820","76c57043e5a837680af7af7d5a3354a32b865169","e8d0f3a8ff7c9a452efdee9f355caf651540d7cb","1b6ff25782b32fc1932944e51cf70c486ebcdfbc","d82ba905aeb0c4c08133d0d3178e9302737b916b","3316cfd74ab203376a21f3f887fe6682e6c58544","61f975fb559a54868f9eef6631fa50f8f738dcb6","60b30c4727f56d1d32a6658521699301243acd22"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Coordination of information sharing in a supply chain","doi":"10.1016/j.ijpe.2013.01.005","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpe.2013.01.005","venue":""}

This study uses eye-tracking to explore the Elaboration Likelihood Model (ELM) in online shopping. The results show that the peripheral cue did not have moderating effect on purchase intention, but had moderating effect on eye movement. Regarding purchase intention, the high elaboration had higher purchase intention than the low elaboration with a positive peripheral cue, but there was no difference in purchase intention between the high and low elaboration with a negative peripheral cue. Regarding eye movement, with a positive peripheral cue, the high elaboration group was observed to have longer fixation duration than the low elaboration group in two areas of interest (AOIs); however, with a negative peripheral cue, the low elaboration group had longer fixation on the whole page and two AOIs. In addition, the relationship between purchase intention and eye movement of the AOIs is more significant in the high elaboration group when given a negative peripheral cue and in the low elaboration group when given a positive peripheral cue. This study not only examines the postulates of the ELM, but also contributes to a better understanding of the cognitive processes of the ELM. These findings have practical implications for e-sellers to identify characteristics of consumers' elaboration in eye movement and designing customization and persuasive context for different elaboration groups in e-commerce.","inCitations":["806edb742a2d269d9a38c405f1c024196189dbe7","ede376b9f04adaa58fc51ef343aee5005a6aa4d8","99530211951febdfd12094be9d7d1c58c33c03cf","c584941e24460dfbfec4fe455d86eea052187386","c1a4030747c932bf2a0611ded39e934838626976","4749220ef2fe0d3ebaecd59fb30e71554c431335","47291b19bd1c17483b00166c1249be6d025deec6","27f7f638250ab505d294aba9ce6712f5d3c8f883","d542691c85164e8779b311d2f92cee661991e82b","e13d887c9522b410b4eaaf57c09418579b6477c6"],"pdfUrls":["https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q56865790"],"title":"An eye-tracking study of the Elaboration Likelihood Model in online shopping","doi":"10.1016/j.elerap.2014.11.007","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.elerap.2014.11.007","venue":"Electron.

The losses of weight (expressed as grams, grams/Kg, % of the initial weight, and grams/day) and some biochemical parameters (moisture and NaCl contents and a w values) were determined during the 102 days of manufacture of two batches of lacOn, one manufactured only using salt and other using salt and some common additives. In each batch, samples of fresh piece (before salting), after salting, after 7 and 14 days of post-salting, and after 7,14, 28, 56 and 84 days of drying-ripening were taken. Dry-cured lacOn manufactured without additives undergo during the manufacture process an average total loss of weight of 35.96% of the initial weight, whereas the total losses were 34.85% of the initial weight in the batch made with additives. The most intense daily losses were observed during the salting stage (61.36 + 10.33 g/day in the batch made without additives and 56.81 + 7.59 g/day in the batch made with additives), followed by those observed during the first 7 days of the drying-ripening stage (22.68 + 3.09 g/day in the batch made without additives and 23.75 + 3.66 g/day in the batch made with additives). The use of additives do not significantly influenced the weight losses during the manufacture process. The moisture content progressively dropped during the manufacture, reaching at the end of the drying-ripening stage values of 31.09% and 30.31% in the surface of the pieces of the batches made without and with additives, respectively; the final moisture values reached in the interior of the pieces were 44.21% and 46.88% in the batches made without and with additives, respectively. The water activity values dropped during the manufacture process from initial values of 0.999 and 0.995 to final values of 0.934 and 0.912 in the batches made without and with additives, respectively. NaCl contents rapidly and intensely increased in the surface of the pieces during the salting stage; during the post-salting stage their contents dropped in the surface and increased in the interior of the pieces. In the drying-ripening period, the NaCl contents slightly decreased in the surface of the pieces during the first 14 days, remaining then constant until the end of the manufacture process; in the interior of the pieces, the NaCl contents remained constant during the drying-ripening stage. The final NaCl content, both in the surface and in the interior of the pieces of the two batches (made without and with additives) was around 11-12% of total solids. No significant differences in the values of the biochemical parameters studied were observed between the two batches.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Estudio de las mermas en peso, y de los parámetros bioquímicos de estabilidad, durante la elaboración del lacón crudo-curado con y sin aditivos","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

The MR signal detected by the scanner comprises a number of damped sinusoids in the time domain. Each chemical substance contributes at least one sinusoid, at a specific frequency. Often, metabolite quantification is severely hampered by interference with strong MR signals of water and other substances (for example fat) resident in the human body. The damping function of the interfering sinusoids is nonexponential, which aggravates the situation. This chapter investigates subtraction of interfering sinusoids by means of SVD-based state space modeling. Among other things, modeling of all details of the signal is attempted (zero-error-modeling) in the chapter. It also provides rank criteria for three alternative Hankel data matrices guaranteeing zero-error-modeling and discusses measures to be proposed and tested on simulated signals in order to meet the criteria. The chapter concludes with the observation that, although zero-error-modeling can indeed be achieved, it turns out that such modeling does not guarantee exact separation of the unwanted sinusoids from the wanted sinusoids.","inCitations":["69ca9ce0f649a63845b659d842d522aa9005d44d"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"SVD-Based modelling of medical NMR signals","doi":"10.1016/B978-044482107-2/50050-9","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-044482107-2%2F50050-9","venue":""}

SNX27 bears a PX (Phox homology) domain that regulates its endosomal localization, a unique PDZ (PSD-95, Dlg1, ZO-1) domain and an atypical FERM (4.1, ezrin, radixin, moesin) domain, which bind short peptide sequence motifs in the cargo protein cytoplasmic domains. SNX27 recycles PDZ-interacting receptors at the neuronal synapse, and its low expression is associated with impaired synaptic function and neurological diseases. T lymphocyte antigen recognition leads to the formation of a highly organized structure termed immune synapse (IS), by analogy with the nervous synapse. SNX27-positive endosomes polarize to the IS, but the role of SNX27 during T cell activation remains unknown. \nIn this study we investigated SNX27 dynamics and functions during IS formation. We characterized a previously unidentified FERM domain lipid-binding site that enhances SNX27 endosomal localization, and showed that a fraction of SNX27 accumulates at the IS in a PDZ ligand-dependent manner. We used proteomics to identify the SNX27 interactome in IS-forming T cells; a comparative interactome analysis of SNX27 WT and a mutant deficient for PDZ ligand recognition identified various cargoes linked to signaling and cytoskeletal regulation. We demonstrated that SNX27 controls the signaling and trafficking of some of these cargoes including the lipid kinase diacylglycerol kinase ζ (DGKζ) and the epithelial cell-cell junction protein zona occludens-2 (ZO-2). Proteomic analyses also detected the retromer and the actin nucleator WASH complex, and we confirmed that SNX27 acts as a WASH adaptor for PDZ cargoes in T cells. Analysis of Snx27−/− mice supported our studies in human T cell lines, underscoring a putative role for SNX27 in sustaining the function of the metabolic regulator mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) in activated T cells. This study broadens our knowledge of the SNX27 function in integrating sorting events with endosomal lipid signaling in T lymphocytes, and suggests conservation in the pathways that delimit polarized structures in nervous and epithelial systems during IS formation. \nFor their migration and invasion, cancer cells also need to form highly organized structures. Cells assemble invadopodia to coordinate the signaling and trafficking that promote increased secretion and matrix degradation. The SNX27 partner WASH, assisted by the exocyst complex, controls integrin and metalloproteinase recycling at invadopodia. The role of SNX27 in invasive cell polarized recycling has nonetheless not been explored. We showed SNX27 localization to invadopodia in a cancer cell line, and addressed the effects of its downmodulation on invasive migration. We identified the phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate-synthesizing enzyme phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinase γ (PIP5K γ), a known modulator of exocyst function, as a SNX27 partner. Our results support a SNX27 function as an endosomal hub that assists lipid modulation in the recycling compartment, and suggest that the frequent amplification of SNX27 in human cancers promotes oncogenic traits in tumor cells.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Role of SNX27 in protein transport and lipid signaling in cell models of polarized trafficking","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

In this study, we evaluated the pathophysiological implication of visfatin/PBEF in the molecular patterns of RA synovial tissue, focusing on RA synovial fibroblasts (RASFs), key players in RA synovium. Expression of visfatin/PBEF in synovial fluid and tissue of RA patients was detected by immunoassays and immunohistochemistry. RASFs were stimulated with different concentrations of visfatin/PBEF over varying time intervals, and changes in gene expression were evaluated at the RNA and protein levels using Affymetrix array, real-time PCR, and immunoassays. The signaling pathways involved were identified. The influence of visfatin/PBEF on fibroblast motility and migration was analyzed. In RA synovium, visfatin/PBEF was predominantly expressed in the lining layer, lymphoid aggregates, and interstitial vessels. In RASFs, visfatin/PBEF induced high amounts of chemokines such as IL-8 and MCP-1, proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, and matrix metalloproteinases such as MMP-3. Phosphorylation of p38 MAPK was observed after visfatin/PBEF stimulation, and inhibition of p38 MAPK showed strong reduction of visfatin-induced effects. Directed as well as general fibroblast motility was increased by visfatin/PBEF-induced factors. The results of this study indicate that visfatin/PBEF is involved in synovial fibroblast activation by triggering fibroblast motility and promoting cytokine synthesis at central sites in RA synovium.","inCitations":["b9536ec0d74674d48f5149ede0e3abec846e6016","d3b248045b40b5c17887f1e959937fe81294457e","93e1f2924a8eee0d9135d3877cd47917b020b9f5","163bd8ce7b7bd0bb751c3cac64749797695039c7","49335cdb6fe149f4ecd1ec81a795532000076f5b","59d8271286a6662d976d50167f6fa0887c469000","816a847d1eee427816ad80be7b1196b333801551","00853cccd7c2d6094ecb9e74a6cb3d3485875aec","d36271a6141b90ca66332305e610b5d10f5709c9","bf796cf78f6a9692aee509649558662092f0f393","7672bc6ad2273c11749524caf02153991fad38cd","1a694bc1e8cb2df5c945d575bc5f337b6e554fe8","5a2f81ed64ec6300659ba6723967f2e88371dd1e","27994fceab4c1c9b7023f2b2117dc5b6b0a28432","f60ef51e765b70d735eaf10627b6bdaffb8611d3","79343996e20928761d7263b9751066ca9add189b","e04fa21279117e2bbc5f6c4781554c712b25fee4","8a7bdb8b47004ec82ef7b3a608f2f3b19197a30d","983622a18442b5b4d4bacc56b3d1ff44af8dc935","2c4cdf9951044c068babc0967057c694f2859c47","6188ff4f860d473904fe34c38c0c28789010d09d","bc487898434aa2bf107bc49e406f8da43f01c267","868bc18002df804ad079812e3049ef688b9850d5","0d5c7c50373f2f4021da5ae4277b412c20568527","2c3843552c2f6e1e555bfc41398e1e055b141412","69e3257bdd33602f30d941180e75423f1922fb6e","445223113f7fa5176a7aad504bde0c9ba657a449"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Visfatin/pre-B-cell colony-enhancing factor (PBEF), a proinflammatory and cell motility-changing factor in rheumatoid arthritis.","doi":"10.1074/jbc.M111.312884","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M111.312884","venue":"The Journal of biological chemistry"}

The regulations were related to aflatoxins (B(1), B(2), G(1) and G(2)), aflatoxin M(1), trichothecenes (deoxynivalenol, diacetoxyscirpenol, T-2 toxin and HT-2 toxin), fumonisins (B(1), B(2), and B(3)), agaric acid, ergot alkaloids, ochratoxin A, patulin, phomopsins, sterigmatocystin, and zearalenone. In Europe, and in particular in the EU, regulatory and scientific interest in mycotoxins has undergone a development in the last decade from autonomous national activity towards more EU-driven activity with a structural and network character. Harmonized EU limits now exist for 40 mycotoxin-food combinations. It is expected this number will grow in 2007 to approximately 50. The direct or indirect influence of European organizations and programs on the EU mycotoxin regulatory developments is significant. They include the European Food Safety Authority, the Scientific Cooperation on Questions relating to Food, the Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed, the creation of an EU Community Reference Laboratory for Mycotoxins and a mandate of the EC to the European Standardization Committee in methods for analysis for mycotoxins in food. Large pan-European research and networking projects as \"BioCop\" and \"MoniQA\" are also important.","inCitations":["9eb81d6e60d77eb95c52632309758b8d8ec1a5fb","196fa81c6db6d14fd0d332544fc23629848f4ead","1f9968a99382f81b168cd50d7af65a8ab54b6ba6","b0a05d35b878eb23dc54f4a1c9e8e934e5251e11","e4e63f401f257604b1543fb095c91b519437f117","bda1e0b587ed60a9b9450b7b3ffb283b4f7ce78c","5c671b429a33855b4674830e9fb0bbeefa89eae0","ecdf0dd77630ecfa403d323c4b13c4b9e76c5990","f320f038565a844976945694020fa7e4131fcfb9","ae9a632b2a363a19b03ecdb9a82813971344dc7b","ce2d6a0a7f5ca56a0e95dce84eeeaa0316b8ab11","0c63b1c1fdcc0e2fe171c52fac41e4601641976a","0d2cd3fa3aa30155dd7b1383d6b3e96197d5d633","90ca8f6f4c7df6e7159b34bb0f133fa2b8350bf7","faceeada80171bb0ded11bc34cbebf5adbac5b9b","19992d1e2fb0bb7b8a2b5c08a010cf850d9f9b1b","603fc1d101fc75782c18c5255b741b709c600c49","1055c7385198bed7295961c7a3a052e698284122","3e29d69e1729135320e0eeb26683bd99a44dd581","8fd9315f214650c9c786091fa60c4d2b6496444e","04569836f00715418f85fed028c9ca7443292c9d","fb0ff9b905203fc0344f408c23d75b99e6efa79a","231309d1152848155f497554eeeb22061fa13c80","ec5cb5c9add26f20b41462b13b6bd013e54d981c","d50b0068837aee3c5f1b6ca9828f7dc717ba90ab","f16d7168360653df55618231acf70c09ec6e0228","40f44e8367d9b4e2f8ec83572d884b9e88938a2f","6148e65fda6204c727309aefff7312d1367bc745","a2ce7c2ea55842a9dbff561082708c43a8be5a96","b180eac4690f665a691248992114def05f8e092e","94a1264f6a5d70561eb18f95b3040ea57a92b5da","9dd686a8122750b7dd1abae308de5267ce99289f","6445a6359cc4d87c3b528dfdc82e66cbe3ebd40d","f6072748a2f1c709419a4ddd40c82192a850ca85","c3bc74074d8c99130127f28b8cce6ea7d12e9990","12006ae6a9d20ea9f121fc9075d5be9a78def1fc","ae7258fb830b63d6aac85c62996ec723b6bc97d8","b8107c927e5720b2cf61982be58d7b3bb56ff9a4","2cbdf27de1d89da130feaf841cb4fca5a7028394","3a61f583469440689136fdad887c1c6f7866161a","76e5714fcf0a9562e152812d23d21a318a9f80cf","d456f4ecf4f84da86ce9ce55554ad724f94ceee0","a4e3efeaac77c89ca71a6896c5d5f58bd084b2bb","a1e1e764ff75d748037414b5835df491e57d6ca5","ca2d8ad87c86e3dfbbdc33757d21a0552553476e","43c46a76d4ba3aa9e51b21649d3a8ea00e6b52e5","a2ea1d1ed806bce20d2f050b6e7fb4f2cebdf660","2232363ba880683f187a897359aa252db02720ec","587a694405c8f869273ec233ada82bf2f9509ef2","b01a4e3bfa7d3c7981299d6ecd910eeb9c4e701e","8268d8589fbb3d5ba56c0229031ab16b03a4ae5c","d03d08f1f53e514fbba058d11d8049299ba7a01c","3365905c6c0e9a0b7025050d7aee67ee59150e15","7e37eb68bee14e16e7cf8d944977cf4beffc37c7","eda0af2a549a20d134b3a9ba32f3044db97ae017","a4ec32c56160bbf5dfc7edd4c448098dd6504b61","345c82b766298b8f573045a253d6c76524dafaa3","c10f6742c17692796596ba7b193d7af89a98a746","b372f3a69caf66105ee42cead11a3ce00ca6763e","086a17e9c19568db7f35a2b15324845882604a55","b76bd4e3018291d5caea10f6e6b167268ddd2166","5f2044e266cf0bd16e87aac0795cac9e111f9eb0","379fb1fc08e7f939c285f30122aefea5a73c4f6c","b1e28adbece9c8a7b88a624814416c927f9d2d3b","d5e56283e68637d51eaec145a06aa77ee03b050a","907b3d8246d2d2a19c26b8216d3be35447561eb3","1e488b6fd0121ca8725c68274ba1f2a7a0d12855","bf9402c00dd94a8fee6d40dbde8a0a3f7de7c2e4","62c8c147122f0149a1d9b2e2ffc3be51e515bf59","de313878afe3748f541eb364d953d0c4239d78fe","bee4bca1c37d6cec76964469b2443a8fb24c9467","a3402fc5c79b00d1c95d0c03eb3105ff1cf1a127","93b2b0c493603dee5ea86a27e5e4b06c3ec30b92","396bb07cba73155ae5fdb4482b0ae1584c5b5831","dd0c5f36c12593ce3d48dacda062d8fa2587c7f5","285a98b1ad5e203247287a48a6398d27dc6e460f","a76ce8c96512f4564f537a6a9a432137f2effc2c","b4ca8e81fb186d7fdb55c796316d18e4cf5d71b3","762f087ffbc023f00bf12767144c31d9cb18665d","bd3b4bdeb6b72a39b711d9fb8cd8e09a53610e91","e0390dc05c0234a880a23d44bfdbc50888196a48","1453fcf94256b8b17194417f61abfa1d492e1991","afe186d377b97bef01121c2cbf75ab814ecc5803","0b09bce7d876ee75e99a4364dd46638eb37a283d","0771f818b76c615bdd906cfbff92648373ea0846","9d5d8ac9f8694164347c4001240650436684db74","4969a1b60152f560c090b11b6816fbd66474193e","1a874253b7f9228e7d6b66ccb4b5341adab0b27f","8845e45b38e54ef997168fb313831f5ce842af6c","921a3e44a4f5e96ced9bf87979a9932de4987174","7c5c231782de41c2eb7c52a06908e377ecfaf124","d248d59de0cbedabea5bd01d34a5fd58ed092abe","dd01c480c524f6ecceffc70eed275e3eb7243709","dc221d9338e6d3a3865847e769ef1ea09eb9022d","c6b6fb0708d7612950875e515ed4308e5406c226","d16a6d556733312a01d4e11c26a46951badab155","592ff95b6e20fa8e58e74af2e6d60d9fe8553ec4","3a911493d23c61efdf22c12058a572bf9acc68e1","28f22ee35798ff9c265c8193d0b5d1cb84d1f095","34d681b3060e4dce7718689a6563164e6adc8993","daf453d72fe0ff3a828605846d912551dc6d7d8a","eaee4315d86a59b272054a2904a41ffbacf49189","61bf0471503b04cb306f88a28933f1ff7ee1c7e5","fb071a05cf6f00fddba134b13cf29fcb321a3af0","bf829f402f59148ee9dce55f5db822899dd75a6e","c00910d905c608d50d0e53c9906e8c6f157f4bf5","d612f9e4af6da8df2782b0eac377d28ef66970b6","e6fbcdb43232a1cbca300367c8e67e8aaf72376c","fa255b02ccebb093a33defc7a19fc631c2750d63","60ad8b4e36b588a190c98817a842217f6852672e","daa75fc8cea87dfc70edb59465dd9bfb5c584873","d3eaea644ac05a4d646a35570d07b457fc2001cb","433b2cc904cf479766213e1b64ffa72e8e7d3052","0851e2d6740a53878af25a9f59c5d85fa14a16ea","0b8d70ff9464d937e758cf896d9862a41577230f","a0f4e4f37106f927f27e9cd53d0

Frequency is a key issue for the stable operation of AMG with a large penetration of intermittent renewable energy resources, such as the wind turbines (WT), photovoltaic generators (PV), etc. The fast development of demand response technology provides a new opportunity for the frequency control of AMG. In this paper, a novel decentralized demand-side control (DDC) strategy for family-friendly controllable refrigerators considering customer comfort levels is proposed to regulate the frequency of AMG in coordination with energy storage system (ESS). The refrigerators under DDC respond to the local frequency signals and dynamically adjust their operation cycles. Meanwhile, a customer participation degree which is proportional to the frequency deviation is introduced to evaluate the customer comforts when participate in the frequency regulation. Finally, a benchmark low voltage AMG is established as the test system to verify the effectiveness of the DDC strategy. Simulation results show that the DDC strategy not only can improve the frequency control effect of AMG effectively, but also can reduce the capacity of ESS to a certain extent.","inCitations":["72af1eaaefa15506399c05c98b307cd55e1c28d4","352052c21567d2c6ebd0b8f1d45d012de3b05d87","2f0fd54952795de388653f6a2843f23d0bc1dbf8","dbd3c7a1a6d3725f2cc0b7b133f8676e55e8734c"],"pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1109/ISGT.2013.6497856"],"title":"Dynamic frequency control of autonomous microgrid based on family-friendly controllable loads","doi":"10.1109/ISGT.2013.6497856","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISGT.2013.6497856","venue":"2013 IEEE PES Innovative Smart Grid Technologies Conference (ISGT)"}

Due to a combination of financial, regulatory and operational challenges, however, it is becoming increasingly difficult for publicly owned and operated water utilities to provide affordable and safe water along with efficient service delivery. Since the 1980's, new actors have entered the U.S. water utility scene in the form of large international firms that specialize in water utility management, offering the opportunity to increase efficiency, expedite long-delayed maintenance, minimize rate increases and provide needed capital for system expansion. Private management of water and wastewater systems, however, can have unintended and negative consequences on localities, including: The loss of employment and pensions for the municipal utility work force; Higher water rates because private firms charge full cost, must pay taxes and earn a profit; Surrender of local control over ratemaking and other financial issues to state public utility commissions; Loss of municipal control of daily operations and the setting of service standards, as well as loss of control over planning for long-term growth and economic development. The intent of this thesis is to evaluate the effects of adopting long-term operations and management contracts for water and wastewater services in three U.S. cities. The central assertion of this thesis is that such contracts between municipal governments and private water and wastewater providers are financially risky endeavors that invite labor disputes, generate municipal budget conflicts, threaten water quality and undercut the reliability of customer service. Evidence from the three cities examined also suggests that the risks (i.e., increases in the number of violations of water quality standards, decreases in actual preventative maintenance and lower-than expected financial savings) outweigh the presumed returns offered by long-term contracts with provide providers (namely financial savings, improvements in customer service, and improvements in water quality). Finally, this study also examines the concept of competitiveness in water utility management and explores opportunities for public utilities to identify and implement operational improvements without actually privatizing any aspects of network operations and maintenance.

This method is adopted to realize the twin goals of maintaining diversity in the population and sustaining the convergence capacity of the IA. In this method, the mutation rate (pm) is adaptively varied depending on the fitness values of the solutions. Solutions of high fitness are protected, while solutions with sub-average fitness are totally disrupted. A solution to the problem of deciding the optimal value of pm is obtained. Experiments are carried out to compare the proposed approach to traditional one on a set of optimization problems. These are namely: 1) an exponential multi-variable function; 2) a rapidly varying multimodal function and 3) design of a second order 2-D narrow band recursive LPF. Simulation results show that the proposed method efficiently improves IA’s performance and prevents it from getting stuck at a local optimum.","inCitations":["55512798cfd94dc3e686cebd816e318fb3dbaf26","b5c04acc13cca67cd7d0d21c8c8d7339aa502bde","458fb3960e1354b4c34de5c8aeb63f9f34887637","25d16fe01048986bdaace511e773b11f25c1d78a","d9567f7121822a2ab164b352658b91b436cbd631","883276227f8dbdb8ce0466efb4c280e4ab548382","d73404c897b4d8288b6c54dd9269100e88afb1f0"],"pdfUrls":["http://file.scirp.org/pdf/JSIP20120100011_62794676.pdf"],"title":"A New Method for Fastening the Convergence of Immune Algorithms Using an Adaptive Mutation Approach","doi":"10.4236/jsip.2012.31011","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.4236/jsip.2012.31011","venue":""}

Perception and Gender Construction in Early Erotic Cinema Canonical theory such as the theory of male/female gaze or Lacanian picture theory should be reviewed in connection with early cinema, especially erotic cinema, in order to check their formation. Therefore Barbara Jenner analyzes an early erotic film made in Austria for an exclusively male public: “Baden verboten” (1906/07; “No bathing”). She argues that a construction of the gaze in the first instance, which allows for an identification between camera and viewer, following a realist tradition in painting. When the plot changes from a voyeuristic looking-at to seduction, the viewer is invited to relate to the inner-diegetic beholder, a change that already points the attentive observer to different modes of constructing the gaze.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Paradoxien der Schaulust.

In temperate environments the coast may be outlined by the difference between the high coherence of the land and the absence of coherence in the sea/ocean. However, it is found that in coastal regions scene decorrelation from a variety of sources often dominate the image, making it difficult or impossible to distinguish the shoreline. In an arctic climate where scene decorrelation is reduced and the sea is frozen, the shoreline is often clearly outlined by a thin region of low coherence separating the land from frozen ice that is subjected to continuous tidal shear forces. Lakes are similarly outlined by a reduction in the coherence.","inCitations":["31633ddaa6943ac5be7c7b8b956c77e85bafabcf","c743880005f2bd42b60eb29a9977f5ed13a43ae4"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Shoreline Mapping Using Interferometric SAR","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

CD4+ T cell counts is still used for ART response monitoring, instead\nof HIV-RNA viral load due to financial limitation. The aim of this study was to\nidentify the predictors of immunologic response following ART within 12\nmonths.\nA retrospective cohort study was carried out among HIV patients who\nstarted ART during 2008-2012 in Dr. Sardjito referral hospital at Yogyakarta,\nIndonesia. CD4+ T cell counts for each patient was observed within 12 months\nafter starting ART. Immunologic success was defined by increasing CD4+ T cell\ncounts â�¥ 200 cells/mm3 during 12 months after starting ART in this study.\nKaplan- Meier and Cox Proportional Hazard analyses were performed to predict\nfactors associated with time to achieve CD4+ T cell count â�¥ 200 cells/I¼l within 12\nmonths.\nA total of 222 patients were included with median age of 32 years (IQR\n28-40). Median CD4+ count at the time of ART initiation were 41 cells/mm3\n(IQR 13-105). Eighty patients (36%) achieved a CD4+ T cell count â�¥ 200 cells/I¼l\nafter 12 months of ART. The median time could not be estimated due to the low\nevent of CD4+ count â�¥ 200 cells/mm3 within 12 months, however, 25% reached\nthis outcome by 9 months. In multivariate analyses, CD4+ T cell count at baseline\nwas the only significant independent predictor of CD4+ T cell count increase (HR:\n2.78, 95% CI 1.55-4.98, p< 0.001).\nHigher CD4+ T count at start of ART was more likely to achieve CD4+ T\ncell counts â�¥ 200 cells/I¼l in the first year. More than fifty percent of patients had\nvery low CD4+ count at baseline. Therefore, it is indispensable to develop\nstrategies that increase HIV early testing, diagnosis and treatment to improve\nART success.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Faktor-faktor Yang Mempengaruhi Kenaikan Jumlah Sel T Cd4+ Pada Pasien Terinfeksi Hiv Yang Menjalani Terapi Antiretroviral","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

SRT blocks serotonin reuptake and increases serotonin stimulation of somatodendritic serotonin 1A receptor (5-HT1AR) and terminal autoreceptors in the brain. In the present study, the genotoxic potential of SRT was evaluated using cytokinesis-block micronucleus (CBMN) cytome assay in peripheral blood lymphocytes of healthy human subjects. DNA cleavage-protective effects of SRT were analyzed on plasmid pBR322. In addition, biochemical parameters of total oxidant status (TOS) and total antioxidant status (TAS) in blood plasma were measured to quantitate oxidative stress. Human peripheral blood lymphocytes were exposed to four different concentrations (1.25, 2.5, 3.75 and 5 µg/mL) of SRT for 24- or 48-h treatment periods. In this study, SRT was not found to induce MN formation either in 24- or 48-h treatment periods. In contrast, SRT concentration-dependently decreased the percentage of MN and MNBN (r=−0.979, p<0.01; r=−0.930, p<0.05, respectively) when it was present for the last 48 hr (48-h treatment) of the culture period. SRT neither demonstrated a cleavage activity on plasmid DNA nor conferred DNA protection against H2O2. The application of various concentrations of SRT significantly increased the TOS and oxidative stress index (OSI) in human peripheral blood lymphocytes for both the 24- and 48-h treatment periods. Morover, the increase in TOS was potent as the positive control MMC at both treatment times. However, SRT did not alter the TAS levels in either 24- or 48-h treatment periods when compared to control. In addition, exposing cells to SRT caused significant decreases in the nuclear division index at 1.25, 2.50 and 3.75 µg/mL in the 24-h and at the highest concentration (5 µg/mL) in the 48-h treatment periods. Our results suggest that SRT may have cytotoxic effect via oxidative stress on cultured human peripheral blood lymphocytes.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"In vitro cytogenotoxic evaluation of sertraline","doi":"10.2478/intox-2018-0015","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.2478/intox-2018-0015","venue":"Interdisciplinary toxicology"}

The advantages of the proposed structure are: (a) VLSI implementation of two types of filters — low-pass (LP) and band-pass (BP) - on the same chip; (b) different possibilities of tuning of center frequency, −3dB bandwidth, and quality factor; (c) a higher dynamic range operation. All these are due to a new type of transconductor cell based on “multi-sinh” doublets. The higher operation range is proved by large signal analysis.

This study \nreports on the mobility of environmentally significant elements (AI, As, Ba, Co, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb,Zn) in \nactual acid sulfate soils during reflooding. Variations in element concentrations with soil depth were assessed by sampling acrual, reflooded actual and potential acid sulfate soils (AASS, RAASS and PASS, respectively). Samples were geochemically characterised by XRF methods. Laboratory experiments were conducted to establish mobility of elements during PASS oxidation. The isocon technique used mathematical methods to ascertain element losses arid gains during mass transfer processes. Laboratory experiments identified AI, Ba, Ti and Zr as relatively immobile during PASS oxidation. Using Al and Ti as the most suitable immobile element pair, isocon analysis confirmed Ba and Zr immobility in both ASS profiles. In stark contrast, Mn, Co, N i and Zn were lost in significant quantities from the upper parts of the AASS and RAASS profiles, reflecting their pronounced mobility during PASS oxidation. Arsenic, Cu and \nPb were enriched in upper parts of both profiles, likely due to limited mobility and subsequent fixation of these elements in topsoils during AASS formation. Iron displayed marked enrichment in the upper part of the AASS profile, but 110 enrichment was observed in the RAASS profile, suggesting a complex pattern of Fe enrichment during AASS formation and remobilization during reflooding. The results demonstrate that individual elements are largely immobile (AI, Ba, Ti, Zr) or mobile (Co, Cu, Mn, Ni, Pb, Zn) during PASS oxidation and that tidal exchange is associated with limited remobilisation of Fe from AASS. Thus, the applied remediation technique at East Trinity inhibits the release of environmentally significant elements; yet the process partly mobilises Fe in AASS by reductive dissolution of ferric oxides upon tidal flooding.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Mobility of environmentally significant elements in actual acid sulfate soils, East Trinity, Cairns","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}
