En cada caso se realizaron una autopsia completa y estudios histopatologicos, toxicologicos y, ocasionalmente, microbiologicos, y se recogio informacion sobre antecedentes patologicos. Resultados Hubo 107 casos de MS en personas de 1 a 35 anos, siendo la tasa de mortalidad de 2,4/100.000/ano. El riesgo de MS en varones triplico al de mujeres. Las tasas fueron mas altas en jovenes que en ninos. Solo un pequeno porcentaje de las muertes naturales son subitas (4,5%). El 43% de las MS fueron cardiacas, predominando la enfermedad ateromatosa coronaria a partir de los 30 anos, y las enfermedades del miocardio y las anomalias del sistema de conduccion en los jovenes de 15 a 29 anos. El 39% fueron extracardiacas, sobresaliendo las enfermedades infecciosas en ninos, y la epilepsia y el asma en jovenes de 15 a 29 anos. Otro proceso patologico importante fue la hemorragia intracraneal. Un 18% de los casos fueron MS inexplicadas, siendo el porcentaje mas alto entre los ninos. Las causas de muerte difirieron significativamente con relacion al sexo y la edad. Conclusiones La MS es muy infrecuente en ninos y jovenes y responde a una gran variedad de causas. Este estudio pone de manifiesto la importancia de la realizacion de autopsias forenses completas con el fin de estimular estudios epidemiologicos y preventivos de la MS.","inCitations":["532a67a3826f034e3e62bfe27a36d4496ab89a1b","7a5f66bf8d960766c227415e2e8e2fcb4e477aff","1f34fd2663c08fcaf57dc6b8031b37664b3f2611","823f43b5295f3cded46bc9ca0f45f7d85d2a7ae3","5095e18593167bc0e2a9ee711b3037854b2bf49b","07df7312651ceb5a6f870e35138f54828e8c5940","b0dc4631f10c20f0340c447f9bf091549c586104","be806bfc9381d818bd7c1b1ad9ce7e2df181bd37","9b9b63ad54acb275cbc79ebe22ff58f32a529bd1","dd7a6301f1d243cfee8be45b2be315cbd3ea8407","de758c7a4ab76babbb3cf3c73f328529322a73df","e73db1671be5a62e6790997c4b25ae9c341a68c3"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Incidencia y causas de muerte súbita en menores de 36 años","doi":"10.1016/S0025-7753(01)71800-3","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/S0025-7753%2801%2971800-3","venue":""}

PHYSIOGRAPHIC CHARACTERIZATION OF HYDROGRAPHIC BASIN STREAM MARRECAS, DRACENA/SP ABSTRACT The physiographic characteristics of hydrographic basin, relates to the analysis of the physical characteristics present in the area, elaborating an interaction between these elements, leading to the knowledge of the possible evolutions of these environments, as well as prevent possible degradation. Therefore, from the moment it is known these interactions become possible to suggest appropriate forms of use and occupation of land, reducing the impacts on the environment. The objective of this research is to realize a physiographic analysis of Hydrographic Basin of Stream Marrecas, localized in the municipality of Dracena/SP, through your physical characteristics, as geology, soils, slope, hypsometry, topographical profiles and use and occupancy of the land, seeking thus, an integrated analysis of all the physical aspect of the basin. For the operationalization of researchwere utilized some programs such: Global Mapper 13, ArcGIS 10 and Spring, 5.0.6, for completion of mapping and topographic profiles. The results obtained showed that this area is relatively flat, but its geology and soils are susceptible to erosion, which added to increased cultivation of sugarcane and degradation who already occurs in the area (pollution due to the treatment lagoons), makes this basin vulnerable to the actions, whether they be natural or anthropogenic form. It was concluded that the analysis of the environmental factors is necessary, because it allows a knowledge of its genesis, physical constitution, stage of evolution and land cover, and these variables need to be integrated, obtaining an accurate portrayal of the behavior of each front unit their occupation, minimizing impacts that may come be caused.

Under conditions in which intact PC12 cells were incubated with BoNTA for 20 h at 37 degrees C, a neurotoxin concentration of approximately 0.12 +/- 0.03 microM was required to inhibit 50% of the calcium-dependent noradrenaline release. (b) PC12 cells, differentiated in the presence of nerve growth factor for 14 days, showed a similar dose-dependent inhibition of noradrenaline release by BoNTA with unchanged sensitivity. No specific saturable binding of 125I-labelled BoNTA was observed to either differentiated or undifferentiated PC12 cells, suggesting a lack of high-affinity acceptors on the cell surface for the neurotoxin. It is proposed that BoNTA enters PC12 cells either by non-specific binding to the cell membrane or via a low-concentration low-affinity acceptor molecule. (c) A study of the long-term effects of BoNTA on noradrenaline release from PC12 cells showed that the neurotoxin remains active within the growing cells for several days. Noradrenaline release from PC12 cells exposed to BoNTA (0.3 microM) for 24 h was reduced to less than 20% of control values over a subsequent 4-day period. After 8 days, release levels were significantly lower (60-65%) than control values, despite a more than 10-fold increase in the cell mass. (d) Investigation of the subcellular distribution of BoNTA after incubation with PC12 cells for 96 h revealed the bulk of the toxin (94-98%) to be associated with the cell membrane fraction. Of this, 50-80% of the BoNTA was associated with the nuclear and cell debris fraction and 11-25% was recovered in the large-granule-vesicle fraction; the specific binding of the neurotoxin to these membrane fractions was found to be similar. (e) Examination of the form of the cell-associated BoNTA after incubation for 96 h with PC12 cells revealed no evidence of any significant degradation of either neurotoxin subunit. This suggests that the neurotoxin adopts a relatively stable form within the cell. On SDS/PAGE under non-reducing conditions, no trace of protein bands corresponding to either of the BoNTA subunits were observed, suggesting that little or none of the neurotoxin subunits exists in a monomeric form within the cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","inCitations":["6a7763fce47d4863b537a44b6cfb7d43124d057c","5b89fabea32573b50dda93ce1b0ab0f4b860c6d1","552032f06dbf8c90d2970f811d6a9d65643c1ca5","ec3f088adcbc10e637bb0ebf6e2fb9bd67b0a92f","1b6c9b05fd03833df62e844ff1d2fff444fc0374","9b74c55e58804aa1461d4b260b66f0d62f0326e2","882dc1d6a81e8feb722d2657e0ae4dd9fafe9f24","3db246321b9f9ce6aa4629992a1aec804f7928b7","2d7bd3d67a24bde4f3aa7c375b2ff8e36262c538","024eb9aa536991e20cee55e969ce5e40254dff13","229e621e87f9b7ee55412fcfa934235df1eef1bd","8f2853088fa00175dbc88b635bc804796b12c8ad","773276aa43cd188e1621d66c72e42f410d09bfad","3f4e1d35b92b7558f8ddc5ff69b7df33748dad15","d0c51fb2fd5675952669fbc82780c55e7367d225"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Inhibition of calcium-dependent release of noradrenaline from PC12 cells by botulinum type-A neurotoxin.

Comparison between this structure and the activated-open and resting-closed structures of the voltage-gated Kv1.2 potassium channel suggests that the voltage-sensor domains (VSDs) of the reported structure are not fully activated. Using the aforementioned structures of Kv1.2 as templates, molecular dynamics simulations are used to identify analogous functional conformations of NavAb. Specifically, starting from the NavAb crystal structure, conformations of the membrane-bound channel are sampled along likely pathways for activation of the VSD and opening of the pore domain. Gating charge computations suggest that a structural rearrangement comparable to that occurring between activated-open and resting-closed states is required to explain experimental values of the gating charge, thereby confirming that the reported VSD structure is likely an intermediate along the channel activation pathway. Our observation that the X-ray structure exhibits a low pore domain-opening propensity further supports this notion. The present molecular dynamics study also identifies conformations of NavAb that are seemingly related to the resting-closed and activated-open states. Our findings are consistent with recent structural and functional studies of the orthologous channels NavRh, NaChBac, and NavMs and offer possible structures for the functionally relevant conformations of NavAb.","inCitations":["2304809bfe827b1319376afc7c6b0608e7d0a3e9","51eff0b240eb793f95aadb31c9e18454b53ebf24","d6b6acb767a700eb1f48299eba71f4ab04a8944e","c55bdd8593c67882f60795a8bce3a1edfefe0c6b","a30964cba9b185184052455090871db47470b21f","9e59e22665feb098ed87af29d3ff20c334fff434","76f51529cf201267b40e2776ce3b394633432157","96c88d2114c9cf702137ead0fc98cd5e5504bf61","cc11fa5617ab0f723208193bf9a0eca339e6796f","631a93e4cf4bd385ed95f428b356d82daebe8d4e","e1b33b2abddec12d057a8561bdc0c0fe5c16b921","c2f4057898305dc14fe5305c6c891f84fd88c365","82a4b0ea6a780593d10eaa8c86239edc7f923843","e75480a0d0a076f0ae0bcbf9c0a159926f93a680","beed975a973b2fd4c47499e23c20d514262d005f","f159d81bd65e76802fee21acea4d255e4e5e012d","eb7f4c209af862322c611acf37818daf3bce3495","3f117309a723b84513eae7de1e6d4f4bc47519a6","7df7cc949f794f56b60a123d557d9e249f1971d4","977c682ea942acbdbbdf93dfec35405ddbb133a8","a6007516431b9165fbfcf5c9f3e82fe9041a8b74","819179f587f942d0fe497c4fb4d3da955f30b2ac","1ae495cd7be5ac628ffcd43604045d35830b6db7","dfe6c3741fd459e075ff12452c80ba92b4b6f920","2ead17c0b132a1d2189f48824b7d14f8cb22c3c2","2f9780dd0e5ab0ad174b641e0de26726cc7ea6c6","9255c6ca768c6ec51c1147587ee70552faca8883","982776e2c3e616de65b9f4fe6232808d04ecafe2","a4976cc9d1be2414e7e94aec54b645711c9f662f","3d2aa876f2a2c5a455588f311abd313934920a0c"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Exploring conformational states of the bacterial voltage-gated sodium channel NavAb via molecular dynamics simulations.","doi":"10.1073/pnas.1218087109","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1218087109","venue":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America"}

But, its antiproliferative mechanisms are still unknown. Here we studied the antiproliferative activity of curcumin in human liver cancer HepG2 cells. In order to analyze the cytotoxic activity and anticancer mechanisms of curcumin, we carried out cytotoxicity tests using 3-[4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl]-2,5 diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. The HepG2 cell cycle distribution and the expression of tubulin were detected by flow cytometry. Alterations in morphological and cytoskeletal properties of HepG2 cells were investigated using atomic force microscopy (AFM). Simultaneously, the effects of curcumin on the growth and proliferation of HepG2 cells were also assayed by MTT method. Cells were incubated with different doses of curcumin (0-80 μmol/l) for 24 h, the cell viability decreased from 91.10 ± 3.2% to 10.84 ± 4.0%, and the 50% inhibiting concentration (IC50 ) was 23.15 ± 0.37 μmol/l. Moreover, flow cytometry quantitatively detected that curcumin treatment resulted in a dose-dependent accumulation of HepG2 cells in G2/M phase with concomitant losses from G0/G1 phase, so curcumin caused cell-cycle arrest at G2/M phase. Furthermore, we discovered that curcumin was able to upregulate the expression of tubulin in HepG2 cells. In addition, AFM analysis including cell-membrane structure and cytoskeleton networks is helpful to explain the relationship between the changes of cells and external pharmacologic stimulation.","inCitations":["c0d87c66da2fda8684d979b5f704cfc0c46c27f4","0e466bac124f0d4fb51ba581513baab026af9264","bc588018ff68495664b5a3a01a3066fd75cbad30","453054d10467093fd510fa27e84a7a253d8c1945","4e74978067ea030893cdf976c8f5c8be1c6ed984","9b5a35616640a46dd93b15f834312cb07467e5d4","835def4afb59dfbd96e4f32062d5ab59970b3b56"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Curcumin disturbed cell-cycle distribution of HepG2 cells via cytoskeletal arrangement.","doi":"10.1002/sca.21058","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1002/sca.21058","venue":"Scanning"}

Soils were collected from three spatially-separate replicate plots at study sites distributed at heights of 1233, 1060, and 825 m a.s.l. along an elevation gradient on the southern slopes of Laotuding Mountain, Northeast China. Soils were incubated at temperatures between 4 and 40 °C at 6 °C intervals for 7 days in our laboratory. Decomposition rates of SOM responded positively to temperature, and, at the same temperature, were highest in the soil from 1233 m a.s.l. than in the soils from the other elevations. SOM decomposition rates were positively correlated with the maximum activity (Vmax) of βG and the contents of total and particulate organic C, but were negatively correlated with the soil silt and clay contents. The Vmax and the Michaelis constant (Km) of the two hydrolases were positively correlated and were also correlated with increases in temperature, suggesting that the Km values could offset increases in Vmax with increases in temperature. These correlations also highlight the enzymatic tradeoff between the maximum catalytic rate and the substrate binding affinity for the two hydrolases. The catalytic efficiencies of the two hydrolases were highest at 1060 m a.s.l., followed by 1233 m a.s.l., and were lowest at 825 m a.s.l. The catalytic efficiencies were positively correlated with the soil water contents and macroaggregate contents (>250 μm), but negatively with the soil C/N ratios. The temperature sensitivities (Q10) of the SOM decomposition rates were similar at the different elevations (P > 0.05), but generally increased as the temperature increased (P   0.05). Our results suggest that, in spite of the negative effects of increased temperatures on enzyme substrate affinity, increases in hydrolytic activity will lead to accelerated SOM decomposition in temperate forests.","inCitations":["87d49e9462977226fd7c66a84c47bc21043e536d","d48e79e346d9ba0d6f6f6f6b9b71a079b6745168","8677e08b74642d1942376e81bdfb2e6cefcec04e","93c9740f4206c9bbfdc9e8ed4d729bb4faedca20","b22cfe69c619807bdea6c97c2532e6bfba02cbf0","10267e9753d97bf4926e5dc2218e14d9323a75d3","8609df321afa28bfa4688f4078b26cdeff2c2e97","f9d9662e1d714bd5f79b21eecc9c323a46118897"],"pdfUrls":["http://wwwuser.gwdg.de/~kuzyakov/EJSB_2017_Li_Hydrolase-Kinetics-Temperature-SOM-Decomposition.pdf"],"title":"Hydrolase kinetics to detect temperature-related changes in the rates of soil organic matter decomposition","doi":"10.1016/j.ejsobi.2016.10.004","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejsobi.2016.10.004","venue":""}

The reconstruction explains 31% of the variation in the observed precipitation from 1933 to 2009. Some extremely dry signals in the historical documents are captured precisely in this new reconstruction. Wet periods occurred during the periods of 1811–1828, 1843–1880, 1893–1915, 1929–1934, and 1983–2002, while the periods 1766–1810, 1829–1842, 1881–1892, 1916–1928, and 1935–1982 were relatively dry. Power spectral and wavelet analyses demonstrated the existence of significant 32-, 17-, and 2.6–7.4-year cycles of variability. An assessment of spatial correlation analysis and the significant correlation coefficients between the reconstructed precipitation series and three precipitation reconstructions indicate that our reconstruction might contain multiple large-scale climatic signals in the low-frequency domain. A wetting trend in the eastern Central Asia since the 1970s decades was also captured by this reconstruction.","inCitations":["c2c191929119768994323fc67a6bf877a21e4846","4bd4448639deb78fa9a99e22e77c2bbe74c7f881","5ca53ba1ae4a7f159f5e418281d2321c2f4e1919","ae9df720e2577b86f5072014d83e60339dec341e","4931e501b47ee6115b573d4008737f50fd942d05","e0ed08ad8d5d56cc68011437bc37427147ab7295","2afebce3b51ebaa2475f98488c8f4c164222b845","eaa5291ff6b217424ae8ce02a3284882cb958f98","1320c12580fc99708d96f887fc155b6f5eef1a0c"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Reconstructed precipitation on a centennial timescale from tree rings in the western Tien Shan Mountains, Central Asia","doi":"10.1016/j.quaint.2014.10.054","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.quaint.2014.10.054","venue":""}

It is synthesized as two separate isoforms; cytosolic (PEPCK-C, gene code; PCK1) and mitochondrial (PEPCK-M, gene code; PCK2). Previous studies of gluconeogenesis in endotoxemia have focused solely on PCK1. We investigated the relative roles of the two isoforms in hepatic and renal gluconeogenesis in a rat model of endotoxic shock, and in cultured hepatocytes.\n\n\nMAIN METHODS\nRats were administered lipopolysaccharide (6 mg/kg; LPS) for 6 h. Cultured cells were incubated with lactate (5 mM) with or without tumor necrosis factor alpha (1 - 10 ng/ml). Rat liver and kidney samples as well as cultured cells were subjected to subcellular fractionation to produce mitochondrial and cytosolic fractions for PEPCK activity assay. PCK1 and PCK2 mRNA levels were measured using quantitative RT-PCR.\n\n\nKEY FINDINGS\nIn rat endotoxemia, hepatic PCK2 mRNA and PEPCK-M enzyme activity decreased by 53% and 38%, compared to sham controls. Hepatic PCK1 mRNA levels increased by 44%, but PEPCK-C enzyme activity remained unchanged. The changes in hepatic PEPCK-M coincided with a marked hypoglycemia and hyperlactatemia as well as elevated plasma interleukin 1 beta (IL1beta). Incubation of cultured hepatocytes with TNF-alpha inhibited lactate-induced increases in glucose production, PCK2 mRNA levels and PEPCK-M enzyme activity but had no effect on PCK1 mRNA levels or PEPCK-C activity.\n\n\nSIGNIFICANCE\nThese results indicate that decreases in hepatic PEPCK-M play a key role in the manifestation of hyperlactatemia and hypoglycemia in endotoxemia.","inCitations":["defd723fcbcc58a7b685f4e4bf581628bd9ac49d","6f904d3b0c67c6be58687d1a15bd7c6eea714b5a","c1cb4644bf1ab69215d3ab2f6b5469ab320ac86c","9cc0f21357eb5fa89897b5198db2308c209bfbb6","ca5b7fcde00fdefba8d2df3ac64daa0a3bbc4ecd","b7afbcf1f4b3422d5a00c25567d07d638a1a9714","6249b50177004b2f2facb069975fa73a48b0c2ae","c45d5015967adb6bcda616f8ddb061fc24085ece","41c3c832ff3f8567221838e156741a43bd780ed2","6fc8d88f7e3012ac313b7d5928c43fc80afef065","06ac94d55c40c390afd1211c755e492c556f275b","309d0faf67a408a860b87834ca2df8e33e16226d","c4719d8ff4ecb86ad02479a1c302a08a27d08598","3ad2ce9a72baefa1f2ae80c5ef56972e166aebcc","4899ef1e5f3ae41690ce45182796545415b4761b","231562d26482efaf23e4bcedf88077081f9e79e0","877a6a3b0aedc8548c3f62e070e650b2706bdb49","d6b558bb88e4cfbc97bf6ea0b309853e0f761e6f","0be200a60525cd6687fd4e93b00f20ac26dfc28b","c07fed7d9c58dedc780bcb51c2fbe5c5876d05d0"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Endotoxin induced hyperlactatemia and hypoglycemia is linked to decreased mitochondrial phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase.","doi":"10.1016/j.lfs.2009.02.024","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.lfs.2009.02.024","venue":"Life sciences"}

The biodiesel for the project was produced and characterized by West Virginia State University (WVSU). This project had two main aspects: 1) demonstrate a catalyst formulation on monolith for biodiesel fuel reforming; and 2) establish SOFC stack test stand capabilities. Both aspects have been completed successfully. For the first aspect, in–house patented catalyst specifications were developed, fabricated and tested. Parametric reforming studies of biofuels provided data on fuel composition, catalyst degradation, syngas composition, and operating parameters required for successful reforming and integration with the SOFC test stand. For the second aspect, a stack test fixture (STF) for standardized testing, developed by Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) for the Solid Energy Conversion Alliance (SECA) Program, was engineered and constructed at NETL. To facilitate the demonstration of the STF, NETL employed H.C. Starck Ceramics GmbH & Co. (Germany) anode supported solid oxide cells. In addition, anode supported cells, SS441 end plates, and cell frames were transferred from PNNL to NETL. The stack assembly and conditioning procedures, including stack welding and sealing, contact paste application, binder burn-out, seal-setting, hot standby, and other stack assembly and conditioning methods were transferred to NETL. In the future, fuel cell stacks provided by SECA or other developers could be tested at the STF to validate SOFC performance on various fuels. The STF operated on hydrogen for over 1000 hrs before switching over to reformed biodiesel for 100 hrs of operation. Combining these first two aspects led to demonstrating the biodiesel syngas in the STF. A reformer was built and used to convert 0.5 ml/min of biodiesel into mostly hydrogen and carbon monoxide (syngas.) The syngas was fed to the STF and fuel cell stack. The results presented in this experimental report document one of the first times a SOFC has been operated on syngas from reformed biodiesel.Copyright © 2010 by ASME","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Operation of a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell on Biodiesel With a Partial Oxidation Reformer","doi":"10.1115/FuelCell2010-33326","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1115/FuelCell2010-33326","venue":""}

Previous work has clearly indicated a role for DC subsets in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Therefore, utilizing these cells as therapeutic agents could be beneficial in the treatment of RA. However, it remains unclear which DC should be used for tolerance-inducing immunotherapy: myeloid, plasmacytoid, or both? This review summarizes the data obtained thus far concerning the functional characterization of several DC subsets in human RA and accordingly explores their potential use for immunotherapy.","inCitations":["ebf4e9d3fb66f5bac60df974b215c72979e25cf8","a78f3fa6d66f872edf2db4bb0b14edf0ea91c44b","108976c522481020558309c535742ed1b70f3adb","bed4f90eb4ccfa8bf103d04f40d1ed36446cf381","b4f89918cac1ad5f53b21fc0336b5ae4e75d3627","0b8da4b6f2d262421d25f3416f36454448e63bf1","876fa985b7d2e82829364b5e77980efb95272e53","8a001691f6c4696fd0241b2219fdb12d4252e115","7ce391e123cd2072faa24305c77ff9933fd1e1df","2b85842dd4d7810ff7169624cd49e7b7e6eaff61","8dfc69ffa2a526067a22ccdc96b70aa7fb3af4cc","66d0dc5d3ef50c848bbbce9079fa8251a1fbd837","3de57381290c9ea4ca3421d0d2a66da6df0b3966","2ef0faeef0edec770c5130571402e225debce72c","b0837f24022e6d2983ac8e087aa1ed7fd3f297a6","2d7e7d54ebc429a20f47d2a0c27f82f56d277003","5ee1e209bb9aba25f6abd2839c492a9f588a752c","1050ba73bb218f581bb448234f6acb745535e172","8a85bf8b63c079c9f07ee3c066e99f7b8327e844","571356fb0821f43ed3ceb0b45bf122a34eed3b25","676908a8964fed3114af916650f90572e9ac4561","dda8fdc0bffb022b031beb5cb4e5a69d12c78952","f9d4784ac1557a7dcd62465bfcbe8d860768e2b6","429c9ed2537a7d4bd81bf9bcf2ad4c3bc0b88eb5","bf701c130b3eda23ab17e436c5f6ce60c218dbf0","b801048fc5eb49bd3716ee517779d8afc9d983d8","d0f7503f7304ffa83f85d7ce88b571e1465548f5","99c7b6b3b87dd3540bb71ebb3902775eb5b2d109","1e32cc7497db83ae78f5b23aef7f987c4ba9186f"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Dendritic cells in rheumatoid arthritis: Which subset should be used as a tool to induce tolerance?","doi":"10.1016/j.humimm.2009.02.006","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.humimm.2009.02.006","venue":"Human immunology"}

Recent data indicate that developmental and tumor angiogenesis can be induced by cellular oncogenes, leading to the enhanced activity of molecules stimulating angiogenesis. However, activated oncogenes might also facilitate angiogenesis by down-regulating endogenous inhibitors of angiogenesis. We report here that enhanced expression of the N-myc oncogene in human neuroblastoma cells down-regulates an inhibitor of endothelial cell proliferation, identified by amino acid sequencing as being identical with activin A, a developmentally regulated protein. Down-regulation appears to involve interaction of the N-Myc protein with the activin A promoter. In addition, activin A inhibits both endothelial cell proliferation in vitro and angiogenesis in vivo, and it induces hemorrhage in vivo. We suggest that the N-myc-induced down-regulation of activin A could contribute to developmental and tumor angiogenesis.","inCitations":["af88cec0ed302d3119bc6ff4f5f7b16cd2c5d026","434eb48cfa6e631c9b04b793ca2e827a2d29dc97","5593985b9a4af076f09b484873056cf8a51dad7d","80935a312aa10c1b0301fc25d4550e1c95cf7118","de32e915f5a1877503cebc3219602e5b9b3cc66d","8df1642582aee6e1c02c505f50916e342f30121e","306121ec57a03d498d6e1a2d9fecb47a6e67f6cf","1d139a16fa6c602ececac6392dd070a431efe488","1229a1a96f626c94cd6b5a7d8ff2d59da1f25a55","95ced0740187fbdd074bfb1ccc6e7efadb990ad7","409e6fe3b2e704c242f0fb1f867926a6246acca8","3187af7321075af62ce2cdc1ffb9755c9412a119","e6e345011ce730c790380fdf53bb3caa0f031b76","4a392f3d037fa8fea9ba57a51e167452797f0c37","2f2eb6b399da09fec1dfbc9b4de5ce80f81836bf","9dc914cf70e7000e5db159c04361dd7ee81d1210","1f839112638e40215a48873c9042a4c491e93e55","7c70cd35413f0bd1cee1d29e739a7e60c7c9a215","6b6c1ec38872db7b33f88f8ff4581d5f6c373b89","dcc0545d28993524e55b511fb9923b60fb801110","3f0702df95641b1799106aaaf920055a68da05e4","87e5b17f4cb488fa7d194c4b4096ac1d5e2fec80","fdebc321ac558a87cf73bdc4432b63379aa14648","9f3c3a9b8ab13e620508392525f09d3468be37a2","01917a8f11be83e96877da97ccd99467187ce1c1","2610508a407e38db50c58d833b38dcba2438579b","49a4ad723181c6735790aa72423d8314e348ec87","0ca809f8ad4a10be0e674efa5edee2e15067fcd4","734367918eb8fbf08af73d44ddfe05135b94b986","3e185bc545d94741012523499f48d9635b55741d","e072c2389446052306e92f641dd94e93d5fcda80","3733fce9d334fbe11b5145ba823cbe9a7a79be0f","bcd2b820a5de9ccaae81cf301e88ac9721f33b21","36a1130128e2a7536f11c0929c5e5abcdde8fe89","7db58721cdb07587c1d47594eff4878436da15d3","0f10b1372e29885e16e21aff7cd069c38facf833","ba9543f5acc85a76c73b86d7cf5b324f03b6b8fe","aa7c821e411ef4f3dd9a5600d24d4975381a01c2","c333b35700ef1c64802cb4842c59772915e8e69e","5407fa6f999ede58458954b7df6843a10892ff7f","1b397fc44f9fefd991d9ae28960f231f954db477","1795c5a0764d4b7fa0212dd5249442ddd88249a4","d5cdc28d3294620d1d4f37b8e9f4fd10279169d3","ea34406aa1032a8c6283ecdfeba5f8f62c9423d2","12349f233953ae91ae424a7f9fc3b52f768e650c"],"pdfUrls":["http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/60/16/4596.full.pdf","http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/canres/60/16/4596.full.pdf"],"title":"The N-myc oncogene in human neuroblastoma cells: down-regulation of an angiogenesis inhibitor identified as activin A.","doi":"","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"Cancer research"}

At present, MVAC (methotrexate, vinblastine, adriamycin, cisplatin) is the gold standard for bladder cancer chemotherapy. There have consequently been many attempts at MVAC dose-intensification as well as many studies of the feasibility of neoadjuvant chemotherapy using MVAC. Unfortunately, the majority of results from these studies have been negative or contradictory. However, a recent large-scale randomised, controlled study yielded more promising results. Evidence has recently emerged which indicates that a useful chemotherapeutic strategy could possibly be devised by adjusting the dose and timing of MVAC. Increasing effort is also being put into the development of new gold standards for bladder cancer chemotherapy based on the use of newly developed antitumour drugs, and a number of candidates have emerged. It is hoped that the future we will see successful establishment of a number of useful regimens as a result of Phase III clinical studies using MVAC as their control regimen. For example, both gemcitabine and the taxanes, in combination with other drugs, are strong candidates for this purpose. The ultimate therapeutic strategy for bladder cancer will be a therapeutic approach which permits conservation of the bladder even when the malignancy is invasive and steady progress is already being made toward this goal, in limited cases, by means of multidisciplinary treatment.","inCitations":["3d690eb123e008baeb701c39198654668ca2e6fe"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Developing therapies for advanced bladder cancer.","doi":"10.1517/13543784.11.1.109","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1517/13543784.11.1.109","venue":"Expert opinion on investigational drugs"}

Most patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) present with advanced disease. Median survival is approximately 8-10 months for patients who receive standard platinum-based doublet therapy. In 2006 the FDA approved the anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) antibody bevacizumab for patients with advanced, non-squamous, NSCLC based on the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group E4599 trial. This trial demonstrated a 2-month improvement in overall survival when bevacizumab was added to carboplatin/paclitaxel. European investigators presented further data supporting improvement in progression-free survival with the use of bevacizumab and a cisplatin doublet in the Avastin in Lung Cancer (AVAiL) trial. Bevacizumab at doses of 7.5 mg/kg and 15 mg/kg are both effective and safe for patients with advanced NSCLC. Fatal hemorrhage has been reported for patients receiving the antiangiogenesis antibody. According to a retrospective study, the only significant clinical and radiographic variable associated with increased risk of pulmonary hemorrhage is the presence of cavitation. Common side effects include hypertension, proteinuria and minor mucosal bleeding. Bevacizumab monotherapy given every 21 days can be safely continued for patients without evidence of progression and for whom side effects of therapy are acceptable. Many questions remain, such as the role of the anti-VEGF antibody in early-stage disease, the safety of bevacizumab in patients with squamous histology NSCLC, and the benefit of combination therapy in elderly patients.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Optimizing the dose and schedule of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor antibodies in non-small-cell lung cancer.","doi":"10.3816/CLC.2008.s.008","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.3816/CLC.2008.s.008","venue":"Clinical lung cancer"}

The system has been designed for crystallization condition screening, visual crystal inspection, initial X-ray screening and data collection in a high-throughput fashion. X-ray diffraction data acquisition can be performed directly on-the-chip at room temperature using an in situ approach. The capabilities of the chip eliminate the necessity for manual crystal handling and cryoprotection of crystal samples, while allowing data collection from multiple crystals in the same drop. This technology would be especially beneficial for projects with large volumes of data, such as protein-complex studies and fragment-based screening. The platform employs hydrophilic and hydrophobic concentric ring surfaces on a miniature plate transparent to visible light and X-rays to create a well defined and stable microbatch crystallization environment. The results of crystallization and data-collection experiments demonstrate that high-quality well diffracting crystals can be grown and high-resolution diffraction data sets can be collected using this technology. Furthermore, the quality of a single-wavelength anomalous dispersion data set collected with the X-CHIP at room temperature was sufficient to generate interpretable electron-density maps. This technology is highly resource-efficient owing to the use of nanolitre-scale drop volumes.

There are three methods of voice production in the singing practice and the development of vocal music: original voice, falsetto, and the combination of the first two. The third method can easily produce more beautiful voice than both pure original voice and single falsetto. The natural and smooth combination of original voice with falsetto and its flexible use depend upon the fact that the alto can reach his perfect voice state, which is of great historical and scientific value.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"On the Use of Combining Original Voice with Falsetto in Alto Teaching","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Styrene-based block and random copolymers bearing benzyl chloride or benzyl trimethyl quaternary ammonium chloride groups were synthesized by reversible addition–fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization. The crosslinked AEMs were prepared from styrene-based block copolymers with alkene pendant groups through crosslinking metathesis via Grubbs 2nd generation catalyst. The covalent crosslinking afforded robust mechanical properties in dry materials and low water uptake and small dimensional change for the hydrated membranes, even at high ion exchange capacity (IEC). The crosslinked membranes showed good conductivity when in contact with liquid water, but had lower conductivity than samples of uncrosslinked AEMs under relative humidity hydration conditions. The morphologies of crosslinked AEMs as investigated by SAXS showed correlation with their conductivity values.","inCitations":["a0ad368bb04f4b9a20824d1df94d8432a054c92a","8552d511c830dd3b70308be0e20b8f4c0a85159d","dcb9f8d66a15652d00ce897875a867168efa8652","81aef9454505264012e4ea29f8c8e582840291fe","0b39aa55cd7923e00dd4074fbe82120324da5696"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Low-temperature crosslinking of anion exchange membranes","doi":"10.1039/C3PY01490H","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1039/C3PY01490H","venue":""}

The inhibition was dose-dependent and was coupled to an inhibition of the cyclic GMP production activated by L-arginine. Results also show that calmodulin appears to be involved in this process because its presence in the incubation medium was able to prevent the effect of melatonin on both NOS activity and cyclic GMP production. Moreover, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis studies suggest that melatonin can interact with calmodulin modifying the binding of the peptide to the synthetic NOS peptide encompassing the calmodulin-binding domain of constitutive NOS from rat cerebellum, the natural mechanism by which calmodulin activates cerebellar NOS.","inCitations":["5fdf4920ae04734a3fd3200c173f8c2b3e73a3c2","40e3941b509a05d25b48f6e191ad2ce29ec50557","404aebbcdbf799a810720f9ff82cccaec25126d7","1a4c2a555dea5243d21781397367ea012bf7e934","286ab406949b52b5e76f492cb5c549a4251e32b8","7be2779c2897d9d783d67a16e209e3dfd267acf1","eb87c33e7dadf15aa314c2c7aa861aa73d473ab0","17491c7bacac9e24432b1d0c6c71bb5b127e2c50","82c1f9ce4478863c4ec46c7cb67ca55f9da5d296","1f0503da22754105832903fec691e902a2824c29","007717686a89673a491b35f1abcf0db578164063","3f4f61be9c39b45d6d0106671b75ed90fd70ad00","95807f42676c36203f446c2033fb0d408609237f","5bdcdfcf36d8d00e20c73028f2b9b827afd5b4e8","08343d78b2d432a430f5e6fc6d4bfb028b80965b","880d32110c937af7fea13ec70b00ed6a3faf2fbf","51e2b782bf1dd62b52b3f8113cc53583616e8242","675943378f5ca6d34a54008d834925138201a4eb","b3ecb1418dadbc085efe81f527fd8e115e5e30c1","64e1495ae62e46ddcdf3753e9725e7f20b57246a","2281a3243a487e9db878a840372815c32ad91aa4","90c1ce91257fa3dcd46d0cff53f4f1087850e57d","3368bce3d896fef8f7a158d7bc6570fe8497bbd3","8d857f97843570fabd14ca0ecc84005994d8baf6","740fb2771cae47582b805862345bcee92a6a75d4","5a19f57f45d64c6d70e0363a9f43a8bc019780f6","cc2d51d403fa0253c84912591b4c74bbe9268f10","609fff9adeb21f7e999f94a61bd0a28d592e73ba","69810383b9362ddd19a0fc568ce32cf7c495f97b","7c6c5df733a164fb16257accd7b361eaff547a9a","e05935fe178f1d826f18f9bcec370cb4e3d6c9c2","f982644a8451f3901dd3996ef225bccb911be84b","0c9e460da36e72b6b074002a9285681424810c05","4c74dccd820db60873a39a26a6606e0eb1ac7089","c719039458e78d8cd30013051ae9cca4e485672c","ae316fc98a75d6f035fdc1d410d8641d34ebc63d","5e61f0757b8244fed584025d8285ec0b50aed82f","1c5f35ddaffba9481b9b1c4e455d4dd611d732ef","07fa17d9f0ca1a7810a75997adcd0b9b678cfeac","df03080033a6d6458c5771909d86cb01cf90ba74","e7bf9f93b33c29563c4e16b47f6a5bfc0c674aad","f0843ca0a9ef05ea7d7b693becaaba8a581ff6cf","ae4257827b5eeacbf39b808a5f53be1b99044dee","b869cc5b827025738bfca14675edc94b4655a3e6","90e5671925cf4460145ea97affb6bb0275b80d1f","63cae308a1010d4a37d465df2d18bc7ed9a9a625","d7de77d18315a71fcd07d91884c72220feafec4c","ec451d7e3562210661f0d1dcf4b5752ee6c132b7","f94ae985906ca48390f4c265f3c7c1b9ea1e7cd8","0485cf44936f7349593503210a9df02fb97adcf3","79607937b344e3fb2f6b8419b89479d46624d428","b56e2973bc65327365d1a7f743f34d914b5448ca","500a8de10ec498a1a523da97955b34118e2edcd7","9ca0064ef3b145c13adb6d06c993600800cb6494","b7dfc7c88ca61df7d63c5eb4018f7fb3bb520af9","6b445bd9a0f00fe513984b0ac063a8c39c02c41d","0e46318e6e7b1993b36377bea2c86e9cc3cb6405","0d0aaa4a4eb92da51f001f88aeea1754ef93636a","36e89c405af1938923b5781a2748a9bca5c1a764","3b5c5e64106322cabb7512ec1c8c4808365e8c9f","073bd41564e60c78caa6d317ee23d14b838309b3","5782d3e0bd38f743bd28d878a9bed0d6152d565b","08aa67ea013e7cddd5d546a75dd483d58523be6e","13f2cd899712558f91d197567c1ee87a2653dd80","8c8d43670e4bfa165f32ed913bfc031caa1f2e13","d761157f2a375b17952f272fa85ed7a01a8ef86d","b7bc3363546fc53d01ed5df179745d187d78aa10","156cd2a71f2ce52ba08f7ce1007ec05505deeff4","cefeea7768ae577476be0fce576da3d5bfa03abc","12d8924bd4a7bc5a652e5aa29eeb31f1c869ba84","bfeb339951b3252e75497aa11440e8f5b6170eb2","c88751bdf1a710c68258d28ab22ea0d5909a4aff","482a7f2cdda7637353b870aa1677b1838f95033a","02159005a57bb30520630f116bca7d1f52c45c52","16cd4a1108b8d6f12f3ca077c3bcbccd0b4393ec","c39692bfb83871affacc0b776b88848c84abdd13","2dc277824c3951be6db421d62c98e319057ed98c","af4700ae85725e1373a33084c7f3aa1bc6849b98","5e8e397b197b48ae67b80fdbadf5d738d30952b5","65b11deb8103c6b59b3f79b1782631e6065a35cd","31e4e3675037620a8f8162d7f678e1134611b00c","08829e2667df4c1b853a8733fffcefac45752066","ba64c6ff7da39ac8250232790406419d1bb51e2c","738855761176c61d327f29147537832c83a1102a","46a4e2fb973f029525f476b50f56ee95f3b03a09","1423c706bc3042820aa5c7f81a163847c4e9a445","6706510c07447aa9acfe73f138c458e8ec2c7119","c2b487f7fc5b5d38ca470c96ac629c05049a7b0c","9b40e76bf7fa74ff10109a8542b9e1a86e6b402c","ead5638cd89192f8bde7a83d36f5a9dccc96f760","cf9e355206e5e97d30f6df54b752f57e9f0c5808","a04cfa26276cddb6cff234878b68b5a0cb07c828","ef513514e68ad2cf77387132edff45e4430da693","b070e9111ea88db656e4e0256e99d81e97a1a748","df32aff494652368a0746ef40ae30bd51e51246a","6fa05070475955e178d09f954091f9785f575916","a391061b6bf6dab72691bfeb548fe89f1842d190","eaaf01a50e0b1ed0a9dc9ca6de77a68c940afe2f","1f1b799b7b97b148cf338471108d25c26742bc40","9835ca9acbf72cfdba0bc81c978e79a2bbf5389c","651abbf6d3ba9a0a39a2ebb1b95b0bdcd474a6bd","b58ac3a3c0e71cd41092f34f67d3d22e513d5bbc","e86ce0bac43ed630c4843a305888c1356b8e481f","f4c237095113e3684606a2428f21fc9389bdbb46","3611ce6ac5348983dbe4eeb5bba29b8b0f735d33","f448f87a15908fd05c048fafce55acbf831986f9","95fdcbec2516bbf4afc29d331d1cac063a961d19","a5b94bd15c235e506cea683cbd623974faa8f81d","169157511269bac49f7bcf63507aeb0413b282ee","8238854a8a3f7f5144e69866554840de5d45a236","d0f880eeebe4e877258defa17ca617b4f01764fb"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Inhibition

In an effort to provide tunable rolling resistance and tunable damping rubbers, smart fluids are introduced to composites to fabricate smart composites. The subsequent composites will possess unique mechanical properties in response to an externally applied voltage. This paper discusses the measurement of rolling resistance of poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) using a wooden pendulum roller, crafted in our lab. All fibers can be submerged in the electro rheological fluids (ERF) and become impregnated with barium titanyl oxalate with urea coated particles. Under the influence of electric field strength, the properties such as damping coefficient, rolling force and viscoelastic properties are altered.

Pendidikan perlu diterapkan secara dini yaitu pendidikan yang dilakukan dari keluarga. Orang tua mempunyai tanggung jawab penuh atas anak-anaknya. Peran orang tua tidak hanya menyediakan materi dan saat-saat belajar tetapi juga pengawasan waktu belajar dan juga membimbing anak-anaknya untuk mengatasi kesulitan belajar.Orang tua berperan besar dalam mendidik, memberikan bimbingan, dan menyediakan sarana belajar serta memberi teladan pada anak sesuai dengan nilai moral yang berlaku atau tingkah laku yang perlu dihindari. Tujuan Penelitian ini ialah (1) mendeskripsikan peran orang tua sebagai penyedia fasilitas, (2) mendeskripsikan peran orang tua sebagai pendidik, (3) mendeskripsikan peran orang tua sebagai pembimbing menyelesaikan masalah, (4) mendeskripsikan peran orang tua sebagai teladan yang baik. Penelitian ini menggunakan penelitian kuantitatif deskriptif. Metode pengumpulan data menggunakan angket dengan responden yang berjumlah 36 orang dari populasi seluruh orang tua anak didik di Pos PAUD Beringin Polowijen Kota Malang. Kesimpulan penelitian ini adalah (1) Peran orang tua sebagai penyedia fasilitas memiliki persentase 82% dengan klasifikasi sangat baik,(2) Peran orang tua sebagai pendidik memiliki persentase 89% dengan klasifikasi sangat baik, (3) Peran orang tua sebagai pembimbing memiliki persentase 88% dengan klasifikasi sangat baik (4) Peran orang tua sebagai teladan yang baik memiliki persentase 86% dengan klasifikasi sangat baik. Maka dapat disimpulkan bahwa peran orang tua dalam mendampingi anak belajar pada lembaga Pos PAUD Beringin dikategorikan “Sangat Baik”. Saran penelitian ini ialah bagi orang tua dirumah dapat menyediakan ruangan khusus belajar anak untuk kenyamanan belajar anak dirumah, orang tua juga harus memberikan perannya sebagai pendidik dalam mengajak anak bermain sambil belajar hal ini bertujuan untuk menghindari kebosanan bagi anak saat belajar, selanjutnya sebagai pembimbing menyelesaikan masalah orang tua perlu meningkatkan lagi dalam hal menanyakan kesulitan belajar bagi anak agar orang tua dapat mengetahui kesulitan belajar yang anak alami dan memberikan solusi bagi anak, dan yang terakhir orang tua harus memberikan teladan yang baik lebih meningkatkan dalam membantu anak untuk menceritakan kembali suatu bacaan hal ini bertujuan agar anak dapat lebih memahami arti dari suatu bacaan yang anak baca dan lihat. Bagi Pendidik Pos PAUD Beringin Selalu meningkatkan kerjasama dengan orang tua, dan selalu menjalin komunikasi dengan orang tua tentang kegiatan pembelajaran anak disekolah dan untuk peneliti lain hendaknya para peneliti lain dapat melanjutkan penelitian yang sejenis pada berbagai aspek lain dengan latar yang berbeda, yang nantinya dapat bermanfaat untuk diteliti.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Peran Orang Tua dalam Mendampingi Aktivitas Belajar anak di Rumah pada Lembaga Pos PAUD Beringin Polowijen Kota Malang","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Cells of strain P-1 km-3(T) were Gram-stain-negative, aerobic, catalase- and oxidase-positive, dimorphic rods with a single polar prostheca or flagellum. The strain hydrolysed gelatin and grew at 6-40 °C (optimum, 30 °C) and with 0.5-12% (w/v) NaCl (optimum, 2%). Phylogenetic analysis of the 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed that strain P-1 km-3(T) belonged to the family Hyphomonadaceae in the class Alphaproteobacteria and represented a separate lineage, located between the genera Oceanicaulis and Woodsholea. Sequence similarities of strain P-1 km-3(T) with type strains of species of the genera Oceanicaulis and Woodsholea were 93.2-93.9%. The predominant cellular fatty acids in strain P-1 km-3(T) were C18:1ω7c, C18:0, 11-methyl C18:1ω7c, C17:0 and C19:0 cyclo ω8c. The major respiratory quinone of strain P-1 km-3(T) was Q-10. The polar lipids of strain P-1 km-3(T) comprised glucuronopyranosyldiglyceride (GUDG), monoglycosyldiglyceride (MGDG), sulfo-quinovosyl diacylglycerol (SQDG), phosphatidylglycerol (PG), an unidentified phospholipid (PL) and an unidentified lipid (L). The genomic DNA G+C content of strain P-1 km-3(T) was 66.0 mol%. On the basis of the polyphasic data presented in this study, strain P-1 km-3(T) is proposed to represent a novel species in a new genus, Marinicauda pacifica gen. nov., sp. nov., within the family Hyphomonadaceae. The type strain of the type species is P-1 km-3(T) (=KACC 16526(T)=CGMCC 1.11031(T)).","inCitations":["4946e23b5c0f291236b3efd92a39925770d735ac","af4b91165c93885403ec7983bc060a74543a5fe9","fcc2d3e8c19e60c38838ea8b49de1865c34a52e5","5514ce3c0f878d48474d1e49a951e746f0f1bd3c","ccc2244ea0dc403f3d35b4100c285edc3c956859","d972a2fa1f22dc6a8074c6f0fdce46ec41856aba"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.microbiologyresearch.org/docserver/fulltext/ijsem/63/6/2248_ijs046656.pdf?accname=guest&checksum=1905D1A9184615E7681D774D4E7415E9&expires=1544905815&id=id"],"title":"Marinicauda pacifica gen. nov., sp. nov., a prosthecate alphaproteobacterium of the family Hyphomonadaceae isolated from deep seawater.","doi":"10.1099/ijs.0.046656-0","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1099/ijs.0.046656-0","venue":"International journal of systematic and evolutionary microbiology"}

The evaluation has been done using field data monitored at one of the metropolitan cities, Chennai (Madras), India. Various statistical parameters that indicate the model's accuracy in prediction have been calculated. The relative accuracies of the models are compared. Such an analysis will be of use to regulatory agencies in selection of an appropriate model with confidence. As per the analysis conducted in this study, the model GM proved to be the best among the four followed in order by CALINE3, ISCST2, and PAL2. The prediction by all four models was comparable when the wind-road angle was perpendicular with wind speed being 2–5 m/s and the atmospheric stability condition being neutral. The prediction was the most accurate for the case of ground level receptor-perpendicular wind direction combination.

To assess the role of the p16INK4A and p15NK4B genes in tumorigenesis of the pituitary gland, 31 sporadic pituitary adenomas and 2 pituitary adenomas in familial acrogigantism were examined for loss of heterozygosity on 9p21-22 and screened for mutations in the p161NK4A and p15INK4B genes. To identify pituitary adenomas which had lost 9p21-22, pituitary adenomas were genotyped with markers flanking the p16INK4A and p15INK4B loci. The frequency of mutations in coding regions of the p16INK4A and the p15INK4B genes in pituitary adenomas was determined with polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformation polymorphism analysis and sequencing of variants. Of the 33 pituitary adenomas, two revealed loss of 9p21-22 sequences, but none of them had tumor-specific mutations. We conclude that mutations of the p16INK4A and p15INK4B genes are not required for tumorigenesis of the pituitary gland.","inCitations":["b98b757d2ef4da3921b6063534307431792953cf","a5ed347e9dda73c02fb1eac4152a17ff13693d49","88271d063bb352e3f63e3b7d28163ec28f41fe60","003db45e649d9e15d9f6983230b2452a02a93844","767b47c4757d6b05d2669fe06edeb7f4cf371c01","ca0b63da4f045a641e93731318edd311568cbcb0","2297fc4ecd9e03ed9c63702e8c8cd874e03b5fd5","e969c5578b4c3a0c38b18b4287bbdeb5fac1e84d"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Infrequent mutations of p16INK4A and p15INK4B genes in human pituitary adenomas.","doi":"10.1530/eje.0.1360074","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1530/eje.0.1360074","venue":"European journal of endocrinology"}

It is assumed that the signal will be transmitted through the band-limited communication channel. However, until now the question of the impact of the frequency on the efficiency of the further digital processing remains open.The article studies the influence of the sample frequency on the efficiency of the digital signal processing applying the method of simulation. The research was performed on the example of formation of the quadrature component of the analytical signal by means of Hilbert and Hilbert-Huang transforms.

Gas-liquid chromatography was employed to detect the amines. The ion-pair partition column employed selectively separated the amines prior to detection by gas chromatography. The chromatograms indicated symmetric peaks with little or no tailing typical of the secondary and primary amine metabolites. Recovery studies from urine demonstrated that at the parts-per-million level, complete recovery of chlorpheniramine and its metabolites was achieved after certain precautions against loss were taken. On the basis of these studies, an analytical procedure to separate chlorpheniramine and its metabolites from urine was developed. Recoveries of chlorpheniramine and its dealkylated metabolites were quantitative. The method offers the advantage of complete isolation of all components from one another and suggests the possibility of using ion-pair partition columns as a method to quantitatively separate other nitrogen-containing compounds from one another.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Separation and determination of chlorpheniramine and its dealkylated metabolites from urine.","doi":"10.1002/jps.2600571212","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1002/jps.2600571212","venue":"Journal of pharmaceutical sciences"}

At that time tissues produced were freeze-dried bone allografts which were sterilized by ethylene oxide. In 1984, the freeze-dried tissue allograft project received an award from the National Research Council of Thailand. The Bangkok Biomaterial Center was officially inaugurated on December 6, 1984 under the Royal Patronage of H.R.H. Princess Galyanivadhana and is located inside the Siriraj Hospital. The Center is involved in the procurement, processing, storage and development of bone and tissue allografts. A variety of allografts including bone, cartilage, fascia lata, dura mater, cornea and also cardiovascular tissues have been procured and processed. Preservation and long-term storage are accomplished by freeze drying and deep freezing. Grafts prepared by the Center are supplied free of charge at the request of surgeons in hospitals throughout Thailand and in neighboring countries. The Center acts as the National Tissue and Allograft Bank of Thailand. From December 1984 to February 2000, the Center has processed a total of 20 524 allografts: 16 981 freeze-dried bones, 705 deep-frozen bones, 1838 freeze-dried amnion, 559 freeze-dried dura mater, 342 freeze-dried fascia lata, 46 costal cartilage, 18 corneas, 2 skin, 5 trachea, 22 fresh tendon and 6 bone substitutes. The allografts processed were used in 2049 patients by 223 surgeons in 53 hospitals in Thailand and 4 cases in neighboring countries. There have been 413 cadaveric donors, 619 living donors, 16 brain dead donors and 270 graveyard donors. There have been complications in 126 patients (6.14%) due to various clinical conditions. There have been production and application of 4 hydroxyapatite occular implant by the Center. The Center is in the process of establishing a full-fledged Research, Clinical and Cell Culture Laboratory.","inCitations":["45d270a388a4e078d0f4811e256b4cd027aa47b1","82ce87361d9f7848f69b762f34a1e121a250ace9","1a6b5d655ff1d12f363788f8521573b36926a475","1f4e389b22be3e3fb012ecebc028f04d12d40e14","e20ac43c20afe1245d5fcb2f9c7791f53723b85e","2f6faebcc6fe6219a83bad47bf037ea4326de424","dda81cea6aa2ab7c54ea594194074dc45c67240e","bca15a8612b1b380415b8b6e56629555baa8fbd7"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Bangkok Biomaterial Center: 15 Years Experience in Tissue Banking","doi":"10.1023/A:1026542730541","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1023/A%3A1026542730541","venue":"Cell and Tissue Banking"}
