It distributed left-wing political books aimed at the political education of the mass public. It attempted to mobilize British opinion against Hitler and agitated for a Popular Front and a collective security alliance. The Left Book Club was founded and directed by the publisher Victor Gollancz, who remained the most important influence on the club throughout its history. The Left Book Club was a highly successful publishing enterprise, and it developed into the leading left-wing political movement of the 1930s in Britain. It attracted wide-ranging support, from Communists to left-wing Labourites and many Liberals. Its selections document the outlook of most of the British Left of the 1930s and indicate the range of its interests. The author outlines the history of the club.

To account for such a complexity, the photoreactivity of four aromatic polymers is detailed. The mechanisms of photochemical evolution were probed using various techniques such as FTIR and UV spectroscopies, chemical derivatization reactions, physical treatments of irradiated films and mass spectrometric analysis of the low molecular weight fragments. A dual photochemistry, largely dependent upon the spectral distribution of the excitation light source, is well evidenced with bisphenol-A polycarbonate (PC). Excitation of PC at short wavelengths involves two consecutive photo-Fries rearrangements of the aromatic carbonate units; on irradiation at long wavelengths, photoproducts are shown to result from the photo-induced oxidation on the side chain and from the phenyl rings oxidation. The photo-oxidation of poly(butylene terephthalate) (PBT) largely involves pure photolytic pathways; on the opposite, the dominant photo-oxidative pathway of phenoxy resins (PR) is attributed to the high oxidizability of methylene groups in α-position to the oxygen atom of the ether groups. It is shown at last that the photo-oxidation of poly(2,6-dimethyl-1,4-phenylene oxide) (PPO) largely involves the oxidation of phenyl rings.","inCitations":["c23a9ba68e0491a914754c5597e1ab601bb55d45","076663b49db27e5c5987264c3c01178ec6493ed3","2c523152909daffb2b6bb21e8d4a0721a0f5e085","c9f6b9932c9743c81a0be7ba349dd9f32425234c","89682cfa2ba3033c837ed4d079ab9615c29f9fde","d738cbd3bf5443e62c4dff9bcf4a33afec34a208","b669eba342b6fe30fbf00e7e938e64d1241a352c","25243a40ec469c2eaf65d39f95cf1aa7f993102e","daed6822d69854d3fba72a6856edd0f1bc8ea81d","05d3738a0a71df41c74e2583e931a43c60408f86","b964464ad086ec547b2f2da76cd7790e70854453","cdd4b9634bd35dd07cbfef7c0b431fc70a075054","4d163b9e0c83348f0621882eef1f14640288f4ec"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Photo‐oxidation of aromatic polymers","doi":"10.1002/(SICI)1522-9505(19981201)261-262:1<173::AID-APMC173>3.0.CO;2-O","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1002/%28SICI%291522-9505%2819981201%29261-262%3A1%3C173%3A%3AAID-APMC173%3E3.0.CO%3B2-O","venue":""}

Under the circumstances, it is hardly surprising that the concept of universality is making a remarkable comeback in aesthetic and political theory. The meaning of the world, however, seems more contested than ever. Some denounce it as the ideological guise of particular interests, others as the conceptual equivalent of totalitarianism. But a growing number maintain that universality is an indispensable notion for any genuinely critical aesthetics and politics. Confronting Universalites consists of 12 contributors that examine how contemporary works of art in different media and genres influence, shape, or confront the political realm in both theory and practice by way of the universal. The topics of the essays include depictions of German unification, identity politics of aesthetic taste, contemporary uses of van Gogh, globalized photography, the infamous Danish cartoons, iconic architecture, cinematic representations of migration, the speeches of Nicolas Sarkozy and the interventions of contemporary art in the war in Afghanistan. From various theoretical points of departure, they all demonstrate the importance of the universal in the description of political aesthetic practice in a globalising world.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"The ideology of Universalism : Or, One Good Reason to Celebrate Lenin","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

The tumor uptake and phototherapeutic abilities of these isomers were compared with the pyropheophorbide analogue 1 (lead compound). These compounds were then converted into the corresponding 124I-labeled PET imaging agents with specific activity >1 Ci/micromol. Among the positional isomers 4 and 5, purpurinimide 5 showed enhanced imaging and therapeutic potential. However, the lead compound 1 derived from pyropheophorbide-a exhibited the best PET imaging and PDT efficacy. For investigating the overall lipophilicity of the molecule, the 3-O-hexyl ether group present at position-3 of purpurinimide 5 was replaced with a methyl ether substituent, and the resulting product 10 showed improved tumor uptake, but due to its significantly higher uptake in the liver, spleen, and other organs, a poor tumor contrast in whole-body tumor imaging was observed.","inCitations":["61055e444c1dda3ebbe8da463d927f25c5c6decd","1b8bcc3e8813020b04105864bf73aa1bf15d1e08","a43ef427279b39cd8bf5fec887ed166d76adc99c","3f499546bde8f0409e57bab81fc9b83d07febd16","70bfc543132ce49db3f8b58c4c8c8f391f007f07","5d735fd4b1b36533bdea8a38386e9dea3c8a450c","a38343340c875fd443dd9b516e624ebd92813d5c","e49e530094371d7d357739edbb626cd328b16554","9c0949ef094aa7fbe4da06bcf164f0fe36c78ad5","fdcf6dd016a83cf60f5f0eff1531b3e6aa04a11b","946d5975ba8a0766c2468065d14c920dc76c1425","65d1ec1c352208038514e3b366f5e1e4708dcfdc","d331e5d8801c0950b80939d5d27df46c151393f7","ac2dbdc014046c453847a00afa0f69445eeb8e19"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.acsu.buffalo.edu/~rutaoyao/2009_Suresh_Bioconjugate.pdf"],"title":"Compared to purpurinimides, the pyropheophorbide containing an iodobenzyl group showed enhanced PDT efficacy and tumor imaging (124I-PET) ability.","doi":"10.1021/bc8003638","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1021/bc8003638","venue":"Bioconjugate chemistry"}

Our understanding of these novel molecules is still limited, however. The aim of this study was to isolate and characterize pregnancy-associated miRNAs in maternal plasma.\n\n\nMETHODS\nBy microarray-based screening of 723 human miRNAs, we selected miRNAs that exhibited signal intensities >100 times higher in placental tissues than in the corresponding whole blood samples. Subsequent quantitative real-time reverse-transcription PCR revealed miRNAs produced predominantly in the placenta that showed significantly decreased concentrations in maternal plasma after delivery. These miRNAs were identified as pregnancy-associated miRNAs.\n\n\nRESULTS\nWe selected 82 miRNAs produced predominantly in the placenta and identified 24 as pregnancy-associated miRNAs. The genes encoding these miRNAs included 16 that are clustered on 19q13.42 and 5 clustered on 14q32. As the pregnancy progressed into the third trimester, the plasma concentrations of cell-free chromosome 19-derived miRNAs (has-miR-515-3p, has-miR-517a, has-miR-517c, has-miR-518b, and has-miR-526b) increased significantly (P = 0.0284, 0.0069, 0.0125, 0.0284, and 0.0093, respectively, Wilcoxon signed rank test), whereas that of cell-free has-miR-323-3p on chromosome 14q32.31 showed no change (P = 0.2026).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn addition to the known pregnancy-associated miRNAs, we identified new pregnancy-associated miRNAs with our microarray-based approach. Most of the genes encoding these miRNAs were clustered on 19q13.42 or 14q32, which are critical regions for placental and embryonic development. These new pregnancy-associated miRNAs may be useful molecular markers for monitoring pregnancy-associated diseases.","inCitations":["8e773f373dc1112a23976d88a8a83e68b607aa2a","9614078fea019d290a4173775ac84595df54eddc","c0633d64c214ce586e035e21f89d6b3f1103a554","56adb3ba000d7c3603d8840d725848752613a98e","2fbb2f7283e1931d4a46ca608b56a9322b45738e","57e86cd513abe549f3b29bc0b0ce23f686082db1","643eef243f3283061c064c2bbcc9874d1dd0239b","7973f30658cb1752ee65af1619425b99c68629b9","a1810a776dd83412a9bcb3f699d933636191712b","3aecb4dd558bf514dd9e6143b198c92c80ea3f19","6319f4cccdf042326607a8870c493913c9164130","dfa5043094e5f730188f5f2d37f6abef92b4b8fc","546544ff45e0a2c96f8fe6dc0b6e82333b51969a","d4ecacdfcf8e30f3ad0ebc3efd858f90292ec2d6","c795e2553f1f5a8fdfb343d2fbb25ce539054e72","70df750b078636975373d08b40789f9003a5b4d7","050e0713fddf98f791d5ce298bcf65a15c507414","d56ffb0d7155295db2769b0e833f861648fb77c0","3ab98b39f1f9f7cb4f6d5deffaa97c6896a0e73c","374c70657d5053d2763008d572e4d581b7702ee6","5441384838b81b04e642312cf7ccde1ca67ab620","06041270dbe06fe779db002fa4a7443b4b43a90c","9e379d6f218b08a2f1bcf0a8791ab43d40b3bf9a","afab380639ce261d89b9045dd0d3690acf3d93d8","2abe66c6842b8120f0244b0c43ede7ea1e8e7ad2","8dc70e20803285ca1de18ab27dc7efc77800aad4","cc2472ce1715c6d0266837d1b7a56acdc684817d","cda9ee75043497ad26805f62c5e63e6e271f233a","37fe2193be453294a744231eb506c0ba21a32746","b536d75fab7855c20369f3555bac89f71affca8d","4a466f42d46587e145e40f1c8daff8b61b835c04","1535a821289b9cfaf97ac59c61256d3c334a26b0","48de80ecb3f5416bfc339411a734435003629302","620020822758fdb5e70c48995ccab24d75d9d8b1","04ce392d27db1f014945aecf131d42642b40d344","7e1cf6ce4ac24395df4bc945a4b181ee86c4da6c","9b9a21267a7f32dc0071da795d73185ff9b8edee","f34bd9bcb7e5fe3508349437db2a405e5574403d","34d6781ea63c5a258be3bd7b3c81172488a344d9","e666c07240d872cb1cf13a2d50ed45026ccbdeb7","d037e0974857723e3e41ccbfd47c8298b534f080","83798e6fa06a8e891bc7b3cd8426f453a08e19a1","6225a0f12f19ff2ca28c0bd40fe6e9b42d06e58c","f7e2e2bffb4e8f45b7837a21b3b1df7a7ffc0e7d","c54d4b0d885a9c729fa78c99abfe1a94e0245f3a","228a5c7b43230773a78c4e288fd667df2fd1a980","08c79b7f875ce5ebfc7c26d6f9614c6e1909f176","4aae4654e52afc064eeb68689502776071409639","58398048be0d6a6b5f1a82fc961614417756ac74","953437345e1a5b24bc0323c39bd1397183ade2c2","a2a87aa791b0258fbe4b6122512087fbcdbbf802","ee405d986dd26900f990884df7e8c59f0dd828af","e3acae7379997d94d44df41c1687d7a65f36e8c0","c4ce1f7cd10279045a7651134e6d34a34de2dd0f","0789a1153b850c787090e67d49e0cac73e4bddcd","92bfd3f468d797fabe3279c0a3caed82f326fa17","748aed327a77686200fe060d5bf58ff3a3c2a3d6","ac87f86dbc7db75d6c9af4ce156763a3e8b657e2","cbad250c208481b052a220248153e91f263e91a6","941374045eb9c009cd14b159d93c7486a214c3f1","0cec415b56c1418ffa726e1ada956f21e7984b68","63b241e60ae9a41c97918cac445c5a5ac789c4d7","a8d319d298ed849f16108c1584f1111179d0c4cf","89103064351ce896196c5912efff0e0c267cbdb8","329bc304adc1c234dedf77abcdf1a490cccb1a63","83939ff6226abc295c85a408a28ffaad69039d43","f311b6b2efe3a4cf43a072c8d80de47d6f48ac56","b627e59857537f2dbe609dc1492705a51c77e850","c954baa6eeb1f712aae2fc2a3a8ca31c1f77d6aa","f49f1b78060892de66a1c3de874688730f34aeb6","c316455992d7ce1f23ac1ff60ebb2f48d35a614e","77c0171b1d70d4aeb22cf16c00997216debdc9a1","dc4bc41629b01198da4b6a1c5a545cf18e9533a7","123a8b1a3722521dd66b1761ada59bfabd26cafb","f3027c773f04c71cd148dcb513a67c562808d048","68054287ea6f820e4124e0468bd799e71f732f27","397f2d71bfb608c018d2ef210febdf3bdc4b5566","0c1cec7e9f5a339cb28aacf5dad7f13d5ae056a8","9d1a305457acbad5c4b2e0b3ce789a2671e69096","4b26350d1ae61699ac6e425d09d23bb85d29ccf3","3c77d6765ee685d768b07f711f4be5ece94b4407","fa8930c65633e12a5638e98420b373426d78bf7e","2787cba66c7a16786aa4732bd4ae722981fdb890","5e3a1a2665bbe6a8309f14e24b5a82a69de3185b","65c2cc63ba9379ccc73b6bc6ed8614d140e2ee16","a4c4318d682aace815f32660caa0c0c24d81c443","7a4dcdd0aeb08f833892d607c1d77162271b08ec","2f611a6b6fa018cad2fd35180bf0d89e3b7df0a4","248f3e4e7e653ac8fa755ae731899578585e78c6","7805ebbdcfa2e984a41f2e931f8bddf025e83d19","739f602245e5e6e0e76547590f356be4acc574ca","7a21773b9ed33864b4735ec8a09cfdc538bb2c14","26bf98101f9a3702f3aea6a2fe9f16889485c138","73ef0fe8431918cd3a729166c29b949245966831","55e89bc3b20fa19e72081b37e2afbb5f37dd2017","ee845c124581fc3453076aa557f57b86005cd8ab","72d4f9954d56f37a01216afc0a1e9ee825c92edc","3bc23d7abac569e943103836d62362ede1dd6fc9","7e159d39719c3955141f0feaea046dbd7a78fc04","225ed9a7a217a28ecfa148f20bc48b4a3c5c4bca","5c86b145c68875d66054963d1fab4d25340013f5"],"pdfUrls":["http://clinchem.aaccjnls.org/content/clinchem/early/2010/08/20/clinchem.2010.147660.full.pdf","http://clinchem.aaccjnls.org/content/clinchem/56/11/1767.full.pdf"],"title":"Identification of pregnancy-associated microRNAs in maternal plasma.","doi":"10.1373/clinchem.2010.147660","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1373/clinchem.2010.147660","venue":"Clinical chemistry"}

The values of the critical force required to detach particles from the interface are in agreement with the maximum values of the wetting force keeping a particles at the interface. In the case of particle clusters, a rearrangement of the cluster configuration from a raft to a more compact structure is observed when the body force is increased. Clusters detach from the liquid/liquid interface at smaller acceleration values than single particles. The critical accelerations required to detach particle clusters are consistent with models assuming that the wetting force acts at the circumference of a spherical or hemispherical densely packed particle cluster. These models predict that the critical acceleration for particle clusters scales as n(-2/3), where n is the number of particles in a cluster.","inCitations":["741d3211d5c6c49146db21173c318ec403feca7f","f43809490dffd43ea410673591f2c86e447156e5"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Detachment of particles and particle clusters from liquid/liquid interfaces.","doi":"10.1016/j.jcis.2015.06.050","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2015.06.050","venue":"Journal of colloid and interface science"}

We explored the efficacy and safety of the steroidal aromatase inactivator exemestane as first-line hormonal therapy in MBC in postmenopausal women.\n\n\nPATIENTS AND METHODS\nPatients with measurable disease were eligible if they had received no prior hormone therapy for metastatic disease and had hormone receptor positive disease or hormone receptor unknown disease with a long disease-free interval from adjuvant therapy. They were randomized to tamoxifen 20 mg/day or exemestane 25 mg/day in this open-label study.\n\n\nRESULTS\nBlinded independently reviewed response rates for exemestane and tamoxifen were 41% and 17%, respectively. Fifty-seven per cent of exemestane- and 42% of tamoxifen-treated patients experienced clinical benefit, defined as complete or partial response, or disease stabilization lasting at least 6 months. There was a low incidence of severe flushing, sweating, nausea and edema in women who received exemestane. One exemestane-treated patient had a pulmonary embolism with grade 4 dyspnea.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nExemestane is well tolerated and active in the first-line treatment of hormone-responsive MBC. An ongoing EORTC phase III trial is comparing the efficacy, measuring time-to-disease progression, of exemestane and tamoxifen.","inCitations":["707141353f47837ae2862a515a58d0bbbf5dd193","b97b434561a79b1196879d3612325933f993f866","9324cd7af588e952f1dc15811b2aece95e693786","5a09217a7b7e1a9129466613976f99b10143631c","463468f76cca16ba372230180e04e0127229fe9f","ad646350e5b8c79b56c0032491e42cca10a27c3b","38f5af2a76ac5d1777afe502c2e40ccc9e724da9","c231001ec47c8feb47ec4a0b5ef11fc6015cf55c","43173c1ce0e81f074fd6d2479d608721e059ff7f","45590c5b92c66efe3024470c35bc7f056b6d2526","754d5995a1ffa10b62d4cfe3cf5674f88d4c1592","35062bb98de71f762b9d7601231f87e567a65eb1","a2928b75eb9f3b61827f9e1004ca9a8645f656f2","b8e2d341ea5a764e36a3505dd13746a76640ab5e","4551944206cf280be00c6f3d90599e5dbccbf216","f886916e2c54ef843ac8995a0ceb0ba951843568","e595e75d330576ec9aa3253cd6f3805249517a00","75765f92b2814a85eaf7297f69cf2efe65a76147","d82ef9edd7a100363036422fb6b48991c3b157fd","5c9e9572ee14849173a2a2fc94b25c2bfab2f475","af5c4ed4842d82fe294bda212e0af2780700d56d","f7c8098609a89085d38b4d3957965e4b4252cf49","80783f4e0e35fe26794f35b5cc4f9ccc90f410f0","2f4651aae9281645a3271e6b7a7b82fe2933451e","7e4dedbc93fc56ba3adc85407b3152b06bbc0969","ac0539447dbcad721f1d0d167dcb2410b8965b3a","96e9fd741d6fe07f7114b9cc5312321d1870de72","862a43f9515784f6c0d20643c83825440036ffbf","58b8afb4bf3c8c8b8a5df8569f3a7b7b3678cfdb","225e90c6fa56995a34532d3ee8d65b8120a69c0f","8805559e58543d646a9c9137b4d914a62fef4496","a2fc300b4da73cd8ff559ac614f26bbb206cd41c","c963b4e7ab2a6dc5dc4c4ecb2cfa3c00a8406c57","dcdaf52555d7be2e498953e0c967ba6a41224ae8","877d0fc8e0d069787b95f848c81aafc18d830930","0b31d625b81ecde1d06d5c0085751f3abf2ea996","49efcf41f9489b23b247012eb13d24e3cfe5e2e9","2607eeec6debae2c2662d69318dca448051412da","8ee7eb7c6942b6949aa95dc4c4a42a05acd7a316","056196337fae7448e66df90aea7588b67c8aa129","96eb95358cc96a7903cd753453328fbdcff41259","a1eb38e9ce815052ade921112ab8d7a035f6dd94","9d38d10a0c8617e28f906abf18585553ff393e1c","88674946503ee635db0307104ab9dfd1b21e9bda","767de210082c12e43cb0c3bf2ab71fffea39fdb5","8bc098e1240d35a0c939042352a149aeda68d059","296db53484253d83a6edee7ba6a7ee6f32a1152e","b32f502200b9ac2ae744f22054b6d0544a183423","ca0d91a953e7d02402892c78d10b8f53fb711c99","c2106f79e45087093dfb102ddc45bd8edc54323b","fc13312ee7f092fa3158d80a81734384b8af4608","8853320ac1da1724c42e18dc590cf7847b6be357","ac71df314109bb377a6253903ef1c6781574df14","2ff24f6b0b63cf0552a3b72f69f8edbffc87f9f1","0eba40fcb4b3c3b26e7fed7d21d9145f9dcc4e17","cc751f9967da4b596dea3d4aeab70e601263d671","08376c9472c0fa54bb40b7855b9f9ccb01ce386e","bb6fad7cba7d4f5f209d6ab908fa78fbeafc1236","20be0130145fa30f26f51c8b0d5904db4dc6dc6a","5876c4d7b20324df32f4bdb824a7f9fe83ba307f","36eb4e1d697e140468faa0bbf4f4ed36d278ff17","28a9ae2eebf75da9c7c9c1d80ab712b92c72e4a6","0e0a588fe00c5cc8b37c6e5f5ed75390aa83d612","8fe62289e1ebdf0d778982e61430694b19345ee7","1bb0e6ed2f5cbfa072898a0ba1d061e5f9315701","70fbb0fdc0f99f319c93ea8bf6883b2cccde3aae","10fd619a0b1f9b26b1e77a942ac5f1512ef40486","a16ad99aaa9585cc2ee245f15e854dbfc2b64bc3","06f70638eef4d33d0c00c184b73695ad0766959a","0030b44dcf5bf888f499fd43afc1d873dd279edc","debdbd44f838bdcd89c64dff77bbe64202b4b3b4","15c4a189cb239fd48b4b75400b67be9603b19f48","eb5a52937a3dff1381fff71f88ec83d89efd7014","bd1f585a2bc2ff3edc09699e7905f644b69349f7","1f8d1626fb1311dccef2ca2f3b02495174bf091e","6770eddd97c0f31f88517fba704ce0e7b2e3bf26","401577995b7adfd67240ba1f5f104a4bb8f7c6ee","1dbd347d6600988d096736d8c4e19227e71536c8","eee03725523ab8b97458c0d80160892ead69ef9d","d2a63c13648f92406c0ad238170d1c267d7efb0a","61a717a6e4125924c4c35b4465541c64855c301a","467eae22db19e85ca015601841098d86b73c8982","1052ff103e6c7fb6a11b1de3ef09f90e7e4c6564","214e9935523c213781d9d4d7eeaa5c60f120aebe","3653192988288c696d620b64f15614f81f779584","b5e0e7ec2a300b693abc93cca2fcb86ec7be71d3","e7ed7122b2602d8ef738ae6f28439f1c23f2f885","031abd7d17e2a673ae8880e650f9c7d59ac8b8de","759c1be29865896b87dbef15cd64f8979897c2fa","031b252bba6223d687dbe5f3022de4b28e509d5a","d89182d782b8d166d5e81a652206dcf1225a99a4","35d0804cd996cfcded33333647df143fb5167759","fae6efe1664ef210ecdb05872b68d89e73ed1937","f78063dc8e46202e653bc4c207a629a6f79609c2","28b5df1a55116972a1457f2f5628b23dce7995de","ed5b9177e124907e2266623a264a3ca4c9a7c301","7b69383a0911317c0d99734b46ced29ddc6940e5","2e35885618ea3da2fa704c52783130ca7726cd25","6e3b8fbfe1ab2507d5d4a9e122c647522d89d97d"],"pdfUrls":["https://oup.silverchair-cdn.com/oup/backfile/Content_public/Journal/annonc/14/9/10.1093/annonc/mdg362/2/mdg362.pdf?Expires=1491439463&Key-Pair-Id=APKAIUCZBIA4LVPAVW3Q&Signature=biQVOSxxoHMnsDSuPk0xO-3UQYXe0xkE45E1YQ6d5dwTXsxQTv4mNsOuDiG1mS5qlrY46mxjZtE6G9dx30feUSMo7BOARrlrhDPrbA3DYNsTPhaYGyDSX0lAKUtofD8sU91SgE01QnFleWHTFqJk5lcT39bqFHsoOrOzUsjk16UtOh-yHQY6f9zLHmjzXs8fVIMlBFYpLSP4F9LwyGkGEK2haGco9zv8~4YR4g3NpE3JQ-icpu3XVDObUsOVQT6TerTp-bDoe~cRT~o0j3toebKgnCIqlF5LDh7b8nbInO8En~j2GhLTVaQOTElwlIUljBCKhFWbTXQV8IRHyJ9XIQ__","https://watermark.silverchair.com/mdg362.pdf?token=AQECAHi208BE49Ooan9kkhW_Ercy7Dm3ZL_9Cf3qfKAc485ysgAAAagwggGkBgkqhkiG9w0BBwagggGVMIIBkQIBADCCAYoGCSqGSIb3DQEHATAeBglghkgBZQMEAS4w

We have conducted phase I/II clinical trials vaccinating breast cancer patients with nelipepimut-S and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) in the adjuvant setting to prevent disease recurrence. All patients have completed 60 months follow-up, and here, we report the final analyses.\n\n\nPATIENTS AND METHODS\nThe studies were conducted as dose escalation/schedule optimization trials enrolling node-positive and high-risk node-negative patients with tumors expressing any degree of HER2 (immunohistochemistry 1-3+). HLA-A2/3+ patients were vaccinated; others were followed prospectively as controls. Local and systemic toxicity was monitored. Clinical recurrences were documented, and disease-free survival (DFS) was analyzed by Kaplan-Meier curves; groups were compared using log-rank tests.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOf 195 enrolled patients, 187 were assessable: 108 (57.8%) in the vaccinated group (VG) and 79 (42.2%) in the control group (CG). The groups were well matched for clinicopathologic characteristics. Toxicities were minimal. Five-year DFS was 89.7% in the VG versus 80.2% in the CG (P = 0.08). Due to trial design, 65% of patients received less than the optimal vaccine dose. Five-year DFS was 94.6% in optimally dosed patients (P = 0.05 versus the CG) and 87.1% in suboptimally dosed patients. A voluntary booster program was initiated, and among the 21 patients that were optimally boosted, there was only one recurrence (DFS = 95.2%).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe E75 vaccine is safe and appears to have clinical efficacy. A phase III trial evaluating the optimal dose and including booster inoculations has been initiated.\n\n\nCLINICAL TRIALS\nNCT00841399, NCT00584789.","inCitations":["c27c01574bd87130705d40474e4ba7e1bed5e85b","a357959fbf13981af08468e522b29a2892b10caa","a2ec2d10d5ce9488d87da686befbb4f338035bd3","4a401d6f88b67de954e2252811eb0dab58db8dd7","0c84955701f2485bc42fdd2843e6ac3177e26272","1c6c1cb4db345179bd42e314b25024269df9b929","826fd9a77af9446ca242b6db4c659d1ff23f8d48","762bcccebf472ab7e71523d2bb24e7ada09e56ce","cfd781ffbfe888d2e40175b7d37ad6c5dfb9e4bb","896204b65ee1100cad161a0773194d690725d432","0a1c7b23cfe63c3d90ab74a6d3ed95710ab9eb6d","40db458a0f131be986b3d8f718dc012bad29b319","b3d6fdc71e438e9f4d4a28626a38626672923eb6","9777f645656f28651cacbdcc420eb9a5dccdec64","58d176f8e1544df269208f4989d23190385d5ba8","63d19d5429dfc6a26c5eace819547991406c8d4d","9e5514360c8e800518a62597a160b241a85fed98","d0eef1f95b61b307a7f08f5cc42be5dd08039c85","89b85a5ab6e73612d926b0280027e091d043997d","8eb090dcc64983cbe9b8f8d7ae6f570489e5206f","124092a7b3b6d228cbe78657cdbe52122834da0d","3e08b99f66d3eb660cff26ef854866fc30171e3e","7820f9575a6779cc9e1d763292f5783baa6173bb","c52ded565cc41cf5583ee414c8b167165e4a8ef6","a2a2a3a52c93348da348c20db81337bf28023815","237e8dad8794c4bc3a9e29409ff7fc02d369d2eb","0d41f87b9fa35b721c0a010aa24fd303c03f0a75","fe0596b171f37c0a0d1df8531646769619e5ba68","e31bf5310a0948fee4aa645a0f9a0d4f9a837252","16d2111991f448dcc2fadc9948997b9ab31ec4f2","39f742d227f7578d74fd83b0dddfd7eec0011ae3","9ce5bab5b3b807af3d0fab38f066608dea88a5a2","7651f1f0a9e10bd47b36b3cf9d3571c61ac1376f","913954fb02c261d861404ac8e38583d70f170707","dc705f0b22c9e6b668a0dc415c77b09a39047203","1ba4fd5a0d7eba833a3e4b7f03f5ac4eac7a4c32","62289128454be9e9162a4fd3ee3e4fc81b7fd96d","8404241aedecd6a9bf234fce702e68b94f9a5576","6e4c1849b368f9b2be0d5ae669ea5be3d7e2c31d","1c0b3a9e5d84a62b08d566b88cc8f42598ac84b5","1bf6ca89caa2fb6c5be5cc96abd02021d4806153","0361f74103a89bb7fc72a6e562848963dc1d08eb","3b4a045e7ae83f4fa7545abc5259e817988481e0","c5a93a4e0ce03aade99fe78517fc23e9b58c3438","7b9eda088e039f67dc8e142fe34c14c953bb195b","09674b6e1a42a2dbe48127658844c7b6f2288e63","5f31afda04f90dc856a0587ef107bc246b89543f","d2a160aed919f1d128a64b7647fa53ca77e11a54","0f97d44f2b60edf3bc9c08fa15927a706d46a294","7a47ca4b419053e3940ab3d779700b7f7e30a1de","dcca5ae1ae2c5163cbc60ab783a1438e76dfae8b","e58ac9f52404b23cce8d22a84afc8a66d2426665","f88e6147d92b54ceeecffa265d00225f65909147","80681bbcb5e1b96acf2a5f5551a74cc63f52385b","1933343a6238334b4f739a6b6ad719f301352ea2","297cfac9589163b6d79ccdaedcc2b482636e28df","ec863f52fd3226ae55a99d1f60eea42aa1ae7f8c","ff89fa7b3f2623f0debeb47e799035f5eb5790fb","de3e1b8cc20333aeab7a3dd37cb1b816cfe314bb","fe6772fe275f505b6b7f30bd214c6ce508aedf5d","c952172b95d9854b482bdef3fd6f2d16f444c187","f507f9c7829231e1b54902aa6f2e737e1c9efac2","b03e564fdcc2dd25932fe6f0e904a0f254a3eb45","e25e43235f0c908065346d7d57f7784c5a7dca9d","5f39bf6bc3640efae8ed7080f4131dcc47727d92","c418231a2c4505fdb6ab20d6c457737304249998","24ece569a46eafb129eb6f0ed4e0bfcaeb7d2eeb","4c6292a52afa9eaac3cfae1bd5e5297340a03e2c","d471225419ef3cc5a71a5cb9bae549df5a48187f","6575d2d46afc9124f3136a45c0b81f30f06be218","86202123c7750692828dc0ee52c199778bdee28c","72f35d1379ed9225a99947f9472875000de5c0b4","0edcfdffa727d998ec262273e4a92ddd1c17e89f"],"pdfUrls":["https://oup.silverchair-cdn.com/oup/backfile/Content_public/Journal/annonc/25/9/10.1093_annonc_mdu211/2/mdu211.pdf?Expires=1492057767&Key-Pair-Id=APKAIUCZBIA4LVPAVW3Q&Signature=K-MxtsOxkabRxUqR2fjCspLUDCu9IsLSlKzs4G1iZw1oh98yWly-6wQoZ2EI2FlWDADK6k~jvGbNbj8n49-dk~CT2z7RsRRGZM65nxyF8F9pPGtHQ8L6HDgB3znxNSNOk7cg-wqZpapyRzpalbBFBvmWuFAIHm4iK7bkb0bOto4hyQ8HFmU2avow2cdOK~YjooEpCmbVjjQxs5ei~DLATK-NUR2waVdg4e8GGvjcYA34q4OAnCbUtubiq0zRHlws5~PpF3LouM2ZwmFhxQPiRKDSWlM6iGPiaimyHnyyBS~TVc26tFlZUX8G2JE1ZxCT6PP32K-5x2hA0HtZk9Ucew__","https://watermark.silverchair.com/mdu211.pdf?token=AQECAHi208BE49Ooan9kkhW_Ercy7Dm3ZL_9Cf3qfKAc485ysgAAAacwggGjBgkqhkiG9w0BBwagggGUMIIBkAIBADCCAYkGCSqGSIb3DQEHATAeBglghkgBZQMEAS4wEQQMju0HIUuNiNoYVP4DAgEQgIIBWrs03BaSrbYskA8rDNn6z0oYsWkUckmokJCQLuFi7nXPdyDsB8emii6sFZIawVQ7Xmm9qQjm__oVlUOxjXz0PWcvjWXX3eO4TDeDMqXof58HCmS61cTlx5qu1jWyJvBQygQ32qrfK0Iv6fbFuA1aUOrmnw6q1jqgj9xEfBSjYf6aowgyqdGa8TuV_BIiVvvvryfrJsbUnncGnDCwwWASrzi-nwNzOvwi4PD3PNwzeyAjMa5Mca_wuJTK7rn2Rot2hpFLk23h40D_OB3K9ztxEtqIr4HJVz_0JNCbIkfSBEe5y8_3cEX2Tc19_-J-xAOhO-u5sfpymg79YPe6hFS0xm_g3Zh-EzG1rEWFqoB-VRZHUb_U2xZ7vVaKwYbzzkr6kJ3M9MIl1EoRMTfDUX_C1TKz22Dti7K1beNv144A7yiY9aqB-vnHQ5DktnEtwi-wflKBJX05OKqZviU"],"title":"Final report of the phase I/II clinical trial of the E75 (nelipepimut-S) vaccine with booster inoculations to prevent disease recurrence in high-risk breast cancer patients.","doi":"10.1093/annonc/mdu211","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1093/annonc%2Fmdu211","venue":"Annals of oncology : official journal of the European Society for Medical Oncology"}

Maximum-likelihood approaches based on allele frequencies and linkage-disequilibrium have been extensively used to infer admixture processes from dense genome-wide datasets mostly in human populations. Nevertheless, complex admixture histories, beyond one or two pulses of admixture, remain methodologically challenging to reconstruct, especially when large datasets are unavailable. We develop an Approximate Bayesian Computations (ABC) framework to reconstruct complex admixture histories from independent genetic markers. We built the software package MetHis to simulate independent SNPs in a two-way admixed population for scenarios with multiple admixture pulses, or monotonically decreasing or increasing admixture at each generation; drawing model-parameter values from prior distributions set by the user. For each simulated dataset, we calculate 24 summary statistics describing genetic diversity and moments of individual admixture fraction. We coupled MetHis with existing ABC algorithms and investigate the admixture history of an African American and a Barbadian population. Results show that Random-Forest ABC scenario-choice, followed by Neural-Network ABC posterior parameter estimation, can distinguish most complex admixture scenarios and provide accurate model-parameter estimations. For both admixed populations, we find that monotonically decreasing contributions over time, from the European and African sources, explain the observed data more accurately than multiple admixture pulses. Furthermore, we find contrasted trajectories of introgression decay from the European and African sources between the two admixed populations. This approach will allow for reconstructing detailed admixture histories in numerous populations and species, particularly when maximum-likelihood methods are intractable.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Complex genetic admixture histories reconstructed with Approximate Bayesian Computations","doi":"10.1101/761452","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1101/761452","venue":""}

Because intracellular AMP/ATP is elevated in contracting cardiac myocytes, we investigated whether activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMP kinase) is involved in contraction-inducible FAT/CD36 translocation. The cell-permeable adenosine analog 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-beta-D-ribofuranoside (AICAR) and the mitochondrial inhibitor oligomycin, similar to 4-Hz electrostimulation, evoked a more than threefold activation of cardiomyocytic AMP kinase. Both AICAR and oligomycin stimulated FA uptake into noncontracting myocytes by 1.4- and 2.0-fold, respectively, but were ineffective in 4 Hz-contracting myocytes. These findings indicate that both agents stimulate FA uptake by a similar mechanism as electrostimulation, involving activation of AMP kinase, as evidenced from phosphorylation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase. Furthermore, the stimulating effects of both AICAR and oligomycin were antagonized by blocking FAT/CD36 with sulfo-N-succinimidylpalmitate, but not by inhibiting phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase with wortmannin, indicating the involvement of FAT/CD36, but excluding a role for insulin signaling. Subcellular fractionation showed that oligomycin was able to mobilize intracellularly stored FAT/CD36 to the sarcolemma. We conclude that AMP kinase regulates cardiac FA use through mobilization of FAT/CD36 from a contraction-inducible intracellular storage

Response competition implies that brain areas associated with correct and incorrect responses (e.g., left and right motor cortices) should be simultaneously activated in conflict conditions. However, there is at present little direct evidence of this phenomenon, in part because of the paucity of brain imaging techniques that can independently monitor the time course of activation of adjacent brain areas, such as the motor areas. In the present study, we show that the event-related optical signal (EROS) can provide these types of data. The results confirm the prediction that conflict trials elicit simultaneous activation of both motor cortices, whereas nonconflict trials elicit brain activity only in the contralateral motor cortex. These data support a parallel view of the human information processing system.","inCitations":["875737d0861e95d8208a7bba00ca3b5907fa1228","832739e8dc4702ccab2c66fe329bfd80ba16a305","579d0ed46ed372a64f16ed8752902a99264a2a8e","c6bebd7cc68f598251d5ed58217cde2670e2cb91","f4647c7ea59a52b37d92fd772631713938a37c80","1b538fa50ced026d8168d85574460ffe23691d70","b7d9f6a1de6b9b705019d1bf695b8a81378b4cc4","3e6f91ff2356f83871888b6310cbae3647772d3c","61a7a6c00dc7f285045650455f7dad90797a1810","3065c5f7cc5d82ca7aee880d292d20f522f95a4b","aa1d9f06c6852b71347a791e9a86a5789ace623b","b8cca69de58257e8ab970da03d055758fcc2fc39","39f3e490f66a81ed2c5f1ae90b19447da93fb0ef","e72aeb826f23875c3c687d503b66c22a56b7a648","3d2ce2437d9d152910d866c567508a816b780310","bf597d86798c1b9bd4dc70aae7f80fee071e34c3","cec9eb0f19714c61616af80fc19c114c03092aed","92b8e425a57a3c6fb697ebd8e55effe553cc965d","0ad0f8f5e79951188595fb7b30372a789eef0462","089da4c63a707c95156bc4810193785c36794ea8","652706208ff6c50afdb6c3983fffd3641d0900ce","8c3c565aff5de36e54ab97dbd12a4a853a131e48","211d36264fa924b22f51025d4acb0285c5234efb","e5f0e11b394946a3ceffaaba0b76584ebfcb04be","2a6a629d514342bfa465eb7c654e246c7d99843a","a9f76a90ea68855043f2a0451b1995bd45fc83ad","e3a69d38fc342beb794248bd52b39fbe9c0a376a","fa19f0b9cdca2e962c9b6989ce1cb319b99642e4","12410296b074145d2805fd81c65303291d9b75d2","53687e2a7cc34514eef466ee75d23738baa47449","cd0162af642db118059fcc74748fb4b1ade1d76c","e33eb46c788b314ac0db0c44e5881997c80cd882","f1f1a599e37334550649dba96a36b245434b1a4d","d74bc360096ed0f2b65d64b14046bc51bbd58115","63048c2c7f623d39a01f6a6ec2d6e91757f6e10c","88261c80b8f2a60334b8a2c849e1ae410d86153d","b605e71e858d53c0439f3ec06a756b9f106462ee","0f448b0c54a4130f7f6277af19352160a43005e3","a75721d4471e758d60e614662416a6c9ecaf5631","d4a33a6d3bb9510b4462aa7844e8518771680cd1","376e59f182612422bf642a6dc6ffdd0529ef9a67","65bd0f3ea102692ae82300402a89b448003d24a1","87a2b50812db4168d98728b602c9835a1ed753b2","60cc6e15738bf65f4080cfd197a05d925291576f","162c2019406839949095c4489fde7f3ec8e4b2a9","ddb3cc93d2005d1a7e1431056aa440c4d893fb2b","a28770dc5d3b1e0b348e6d250dcb5060e0a6fac5","dad2e886d467757d6f2c96cd5c4176b706b314f0","7699d166344d27b1bfa8103819c4c4ddfd168f7e","0232ab06203c828adbf4826798581061a9d18106","aeda5080cc2b6679618859b9db293dd80d13c480","258ca62076f511fdf80806e20d95069cb1eb08e4","c2688b53b892d5ea894e60dea91d779c949c990d","65ea8e0d4a9cfee011dc4a816d3a7a66937e5825","be56b6648ef51dc20ca1b98eaaf856c76dee41cd","9e794b809fb3e0839594a7803acdb4f05b2d3819","c3699ef3443b216dc02cffc7bc351991ae0df1d6"],"pdfUrls":["http://web.missouri.edu/~gearyd/DeSotoJCN.pdf","http://faculty.missouri.edu/~gearyd/DeSotoJCN.pdf"],"title":"When in Doubt, Do it Both Ways: Brain Evidence of the Simultaneous Activation of Conflicting Motor Responses in a Spatial Stroop Task","doi":"10.1162/08989290152001934","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1162/08989290152001934","venue":"Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience"}

Without being self-important or pretentious, Wilding's voice in these stories is always a voice to attend to: an ironic, witty, highly educated, and in its indirect way, passionate persona that has believed in literature as a life of principle, has seen many of the bases of that belief eroded by abstruse theory, trendy antirealism; and sinecure-seeking cynicism, and yet still in the face of everything is able to make the affirming act through the creation of fiction. It is a worthy career, still, thankfully, in progress, still, one hopes, with many more stories to come. Nine of the 20 stories deal directly with the writing game, with the anxieties, ambitions, foibles, triumphs, and defeats of the literary life lived in a city, in Sydney. The stories about Graham (Wilding) and Joe (a well-known contemporary of Wilding's) are a constant delight. In \"Joe's Absence,\" one of the earliest stories, Graham pays a visit to Joe's place outside the city, in the bush. Just driving there makes Graham think he should move out of the city himself, \"away from drinking too much and writing too little.\" The whole story is fueled by writer's envy, a debilitating condition known to most writers at one time or another, if not on a daily basis. Joe is writing stories like crazy, and Graham hopes to hear that they're rewrites, but they aren't: they're fresh, new material. Another thing about Joe is that he's from a bush town, and Graham is an expatriate, from England. To Graham, the outback evokes the \"terror that made you cluster in the cities, clinging like ants on a dead lizard's sore, sucking sustenance from the skin's small crack.\" The story turns on Joe's absence. When Graham arrives at the house by the bay, Joe's girl Margot is there, but Joe isn't. Graham hangs around, Margot suggests they do a \"Lady Chatterly,\" but instead they \"rape\" Joe's stories by reading them: Graham evaluatively, trying to decipher if Joe has made any advances through his bush exile; Margot by possessing Joe, who loves only literature, in a way that she is unable to in the flesh. The texture, humor, and rightness of this story about literature are characteristic of Wilding's artful explorations of the literary life in work after work. No one in English is writing better fiction about the process of writing than is Wilding. Two of the stories are set in America, and several others dilate upon America's cultural imperialism. \"For Trees,\" a very short piece, is worth special mention. It recounts a visiting writer's stay at a small college in Oregon. The theme is political rather than literary. The writer spends some time at a professor's house where a giant tree is about to be felled to clear the way for adding on to the house. …","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Somewhere New: New & Selected Stories","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

After digitization of regions of interest in a cineframe, several processing steps were carried out to obtain a one-dimensional corrected and averaged density profile along the central axis of each strut leg. To characterize the degree of possible separation, two quantitative measures were introduced: the normalized pit depth (NPD) and the depth-sigma ratio (DSR). The group of 43 patient studies was divided into a learning set (25 patients) and a test set (18 patients).\n\n\nRESULTS\nAll phantom valves with an SLS were detected (sensitivity, 100%) at a specificity of 100%. The threshold values for the NPD and the DSR to decide whether a fracture was present or not were 3.6 and 2.5, respectively. On the basis of the visual interpretations of the 25 patient studies (learning set) by an expert panel, it was concluded that none of the patients had an SLS. To achieve a 100% specificity by quantitative analysis, the threshold values for the NPD and the DSR were set at 5.8 and 2.5, respectively, for the patient data. Based on these threshold values, the analysis of patient data from the test set resulted in one false-negative detection and three false-positive detections.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAn analytic software package for the detection of an SLS was developed. Phantom data showed excellent sensitivity (100%) and specificity (100%).

The data were fitted to a simple Randles type cell by replacing the Warburg impedance with a mass transfer resistance in parallel with a constant phase element. The film charge transfer resistance decreased dramatically at the onset of nickel oxidation, from more than 10 6 Ω for the unoxidized films, to a minimum of about 60 Ω in a film oxidized to Ni 2.5+ , before increasing slightly for more extensively oxidized films. For the partially oxidized films, the Nyquist plots consisted of depressed semicircles at high frequency, followed by larger capacitive loops at lower frequency where the impedance was dominated by mass transport. Effective diffusion coefficients estimated from the low frequency impedance varied between 1 and 5×10 −9 cm 2 s −1 , in agreement with previous reports for proton diffusion in nickel hydroxide films. The resistive component of the mass transport impedance decreased with increase in the nickel oxidation state. The addition of [Mo(CN) 8 ] 4− caused an increase of 140 mV in the dc potential required to affect the changes in the NiAlCl film impedance spectra associated with oxidation of the nickel sites. The impedance of a redox inactive ZnAlCl film was unaffected by the use of dc conditioning potentials.","inCitations":["f0a59d1473804090c1d9a7e289ffd35d334ddcc9","af137b7557fa6189e35e3d678dd5b974414c96ae","5991cc34df33c14f79b9540385080de656521444","3e2f87030628ce42afbbb7ba1271aef0f28de8f4"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy of electrodes modified with thin films of NiAlCl layered double hydroxides","doi":"10.1016/S0022-0728(02)00834-3","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/S0022-0728%2802%2900834-3","venue":""}

In this paper, we analyze the performance of a Compressive Sensing (CS) method which simultaneously yields the PU transmitter locations and transmit powers for any channel in a Cognitive Radio Network (CRN). Additionally, we propose a novel approach of selectively eliminating Secondary User (SU) power observations from the set of SU receiving terminals such that pairs of the remaining SUs are separated by a minimum geographic distance. The modified algorithm demonstrates substantial performance improvements compared to random deployment of receiving terminals. Simulations were run for both the cases of uniform and Gaussian distributions for the SU random locations. The simulation results indicate that the new approach significantly reduced the number of received power measurements from SU terminals required to achieve a particular level of performance.","inCitations":["453a255ced2d7245c55956510b0b829516741d08","5d508eceb90c88f54069bef62636e4f380577d7d"],"pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-24540-9_37"],"title":"Localization of Primary Users by Exploiting Distance Separation Between Secondary Users","doi":"10.1007/978-3-319-24540-9_37","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-24540-9_37","venue":"CrownCom"}

The relationship between these two different camps has, on occasions, been antagonistic, but we argue that they are not mutually exclusive. Indeed, through empirical analysis of two different case studies of sustainability innovation, we show that analyses that adopt only one of these theoretical lenses risk blindness to critical innovation dynamics. In particular, we identify various points of intersection between regimes and practices that can serve to prevent (or potentially facilitate) sustainability transitions. We conclude by suggesting some possible directions for further research that place these crossovers and intersections at the centre of analyses.

The influence of annealing temperature (from room temperature (RT) to 1000 °C) on the structural, morphological, electrical, and electrochemical properties of rGO paper was evaluated. Upon increasing the annealing temperature, shifting of the dominant (002) X-ray diffraction (XRD) peak to a higher degree, volume expansion, and red-shifting of the G band in Raman spectra were observed. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images showed a reduction in the interlayer distance in rGO sheets from 0.369 to 0.349 nm as the annealing temperature increased from RT to 1000 °C; these results were congruent with the XRD results. According to X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), the presence of hydroxyl, carboxyl, and other oxygen-containing groups decreased in samples annealed at higher temperatures. The attached functional groups, the electrical conductivity, and the supercapacitance of rGO papers were found to be mutually interrelated and could be tuned by varying the annealing temperature. The rGO paper annealed at 200 °C in a 1 M H2SO4 electrolyte at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1 exhibited a maximum specific capacitance of 198 F g−1.","inCitations":["66f9cffe2c61e0dcfbc2b1b2c9a78166d486ae7e","8099434dd190af9a7e9ff6c6f4ef45ab328fc865","3fb414084a0bb2cde69ef777642294928baf526e"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.rsc.org/suppdata/ta/c4/c4ta00209a/c4ta00209a.pdf"],"title":"Post-heating effects on the physical and electrochemical capacitive properties of reduced graphene oxide paper","doi":"10.1039/C4TA00209A","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1039/C4TA00209A","venue":""}

Challenges to the second law are traced to statistical heterogeneity that falls outside assumptions of homogeneity and indistinguishability made by Boltzmann, Gibbs, Tolman and Von Neumann in their H-Theorems. Epicatalysis operates outside these assumptions. Hence, H-Theorems do not apply to it and the second law is bypassed, not broken. There is no contradiction with correctly understood established physics. Other phenomena also based on heterogeneous statistics include non-maxwellian adsorption, the field-induced thermoelectric effect and the reciprocal Hall effect. Elementary particles have well known distributions such as Fermi-Dirac and Bose Einstein, but composite particles such as those involved in chemical reactions, have complex intractable statistics not necessarily maxwellian and best determined by quantum modeling methods. A step by step solution for finding the quantum thermodynamic properties of a quantum composite gas, that avoids the computational requirement of modeling a large number of composite particles includes 1) quantum molecular modeling of a few particles, 2) determining their available microstates, 3) producing their partition function, 4) generating their statistics, and 5) producing the epicatalytic parameter for the generalized law of mass action.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://file.scirp.org/pdf/OJPC_2018111914360206.pdf"],"title":"Quantum Statistics in Physical Chemistry, the Law of Mass Action and Epicatalysis","doi":"10.4236/ojpc.2018.84006","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.4236/ojpc.2018.84006","venue":""}

This is surprising given the centrality of information exchange in the care process and for purposes of management, accountability, research and for financial transactions. Health care provision is characterised by complexity and uncertainty. In most circumstances patients lack the ability to make an accurate diagnosis or to decide on an appropriate course of action on the basis of their symptoms. Instead patients usually seek diagnostic information from a health professional, to whom they also delegate decisions about how to organise and coordinate their care requirements. The successful outcome of such interaction depends (at least partially) on how information is shared between the patient and their delegated representative, and between different health professionals as they assume responsibility for parts of the care process. Any failure in communication between any of these parties may result in poor decisions being made which may impact adversely on the eventual outcome of the course of treatment. There is an obvious role for IT systems in recording pertinent data about the patient and in facilitating data exchange among those involved in the care process, subject to necessary ethical safeguards. Accurate information is also essential for the management, monitoring and regulation of the health system as a whole. Smith and Häkkinen characterise information as enabling three important functions in the health system (Smith and Häkkinen, 2006). First, information is essential to accountability, allowing politicians to monitor the performance of the health system and citizens to assess stewardship. Second, information facilitates research into general patterns of system and organisational performance, so that sound evidence can be obtained about best practice. Third, information enables management to undertake comparative analysis of organisations and individuals, and thereby assess the effectiveness and efficiency of how they are fulfilling their functions. Adding to this list, information also supports reimbursement and billing arrangements between payers and providers. Clearly IT systems have the potential to support all four functions. Given the centrality and diverse uses of information, IT systems that ensure timely Does Information Technology improve the productivity of the health care system?

Ethyl acetate-soluble purple pigments were obtained from the methanol soluble components. Purple pigments 1 and 2 were purified from the ethyl acetate-soluble pigments by Sephadex LH-20 column chromatography and preparative reversed-phase HPLC. NMR and mass spectra suggested that pigment 1 was a condensation product of cyanidin and (+)-catechin, in which 5-hydroxy and C-4 positions of the cyanidin moiety were substituted by the addition of 5-hydroxy and C-6 positions of the (+)-catechin moiety, respectively. Pigment 2 was an isomer of pigment 1. It is suggested that pigments 1 and 2 contribute to the purplish-red colour of foods prepared using adzuki bean.","inCitations":["a566a7a090cadb448671fa6b77bb17e20585caca","42f6563c92832cec6ef180b93f295fa88c044420","f302e0e0679b519179812c8b7ec53f23f12b5b0c","09a2f659dfcc949b0b89fae3cbd0d1a9732186ad","f7a9056e78c422058dd91cabb713d4e5bfb90bad","0086ef5060118923bc720d5dbb0f9ead4b00eb96","0c03956eaf09ecce6d41e9f6b62a74289af9d90d","272ac2f5686525644e59ce51c3553c133c545f32","7dfb6d41acc5f004db9068e925484217ef3e780c","3198280d1401595703430ba60701774f4618f7fb","4f758ce7035031c746d24821c57c4bfaca3f2f8f","05b232486926ab712529fd14ed968d275ca54902","51791d1cd8bc58b8717de34018608730f8482b00"],"pdfUrls":["http://ssu.ac.ir/cms/fileadmin/user_upload/Mtahghighat/tfood/asil-article/Food_Chemistry2-2013/Isolation_and_characterization_of_a_cyanidin-catechin_pigment_from.pdf"],"title":"Isolation and characterization of a cyanidin-catechin pigment from adzuki bean (Vigna angularis).","doi":"10.1016/j.foodchem.2013.02.113","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2013.02.113","venue":"Food chemistry"}

Expert judgement is proposed as an efficient alternative or preliminary research design for risk factor identification associated with unintentional injury. This proposition was tested in a multi-factorial balanced experimental design using specialist judges (N=18), lifeguards and surfers, to assess the risk contribution to drowning for swimming ability, surf bathing experience, and wave height. All factors provided unique contributions to drowning risk (p<.001). An interaction (p=.02) indicated that occasional surf bathers face a proportionally increased risk of drowning at increased wave heights relative to experienced surf bathers. Although findings were limited by strict criteria, and no gold standard comparison data were available, the study provides new evidence on causal risk factors for a drowning scenario. Countermeasures based on these factors are proposed. Further application of the method may assist in developing new interventions to reduce unintentional injury.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"A configural model of expert judgement as a preliminary epidemiological study of injury problems: An application to drowning","doi":"10.1101/517300","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1101/517300","venue":""}

Thus the ability of neonates, and especially premature ones, to produce arginine may be compromised. To determine the utilization of citrulline in vivo, we measured renal expression of ASS1 and ASL and conducted citrulline compartmental and non-compartmental kinetics using [15N] citrulline in pigs of five different ages (from 10 d preterm to 5 weeks of age). The tracer was given in substrate amounts to also test the ability of neonatal pigs to utilize exogenous citrulline. Preterm and term pigs at birth had lower ASS1 and ASL expression than older animals, which was reflected in the longer half-life of citrulline in the neonatal groups. The production and utilization of citrulline by 1 week old pigs was greater than in pigs of other ages, including 5 week old animals. Plasma citrulline concentration was not able to capture these differences in citrulline production and utilization. In conclusion, the developmental changes in renal ASS1 and ASL gene expression are reflected in the ability of the pigs to utilize citrulline. However, it seems that there is an excess capacity to utilize citrulline at all ages, including during prematurity, since the bolus dose of tracer did not result in an increase in endogenous citrulline. Our results support the idea that citrulline supplementation in neonatal, including premature, pigs is a viable option to increase arginine availability.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Developmental changes in the utilization of citrulline by neonatal pigs.","doi":"10.1152/ajprenal.00469.2019","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1152/ajprenal.00469.2019","venue":"American journal of physiology.

Seramai 130 orang ibu bapa di FELDA Bukit Damar telah menjawab soalan soal selidik yang diedarkan. Apabila maklumat dan data diperolehi ia akan dianalisa menggunakan perisian Statistical Package For Social Science (SPSS) versi 11.0 untuk mencari kekerapan, peratusan dan min. Data dipamerkan dalam bentuk binaan jadual, graf dan carta pai yang bersesuaiam. Hasil keputusan kajian mendapati bahawa ibu bapa di FELDA Bukit Damar amat menitikberatkan aspek pendidikan solat anak-anak. Teknik pengajaran yang digunakan juga memberi kesan yang baik kepada anak-anak dalam mengawal tingkah laku mereka. Ibu bapa seharusnya memberikan perhatian yang lebih kepada anak-anak dalam aspek pendidikan agama. Ini kerana pendidikan yang disampaikan oleh mereka sebagai orang yang paling rapatdengan anak-anak menjadikan anak-anak lebih yakin untuk melakukan solat. Solat sangat penting dalam kehidupan kerana ia dapat menjadi benteng dalam diri dan menjadikan diri lebih berperibadi mulia. Di samping itu, ibu bapa seharusnya memberikan hukuman kepada anak-anak yang lalai melakukan solat. Namun demikian keputusan analisis menunjukkan bahawa ibu bapa lebih suka memberikan nasihat kepada anak-anak sebelum bertindak dengan lebih tegas. Dalam kajian juga, dikemukakan beberapa cadangan kepada ibu bapa dan pihak tertentu untuk diambil perhatian.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Peranan Ibu Bapa Dalam Pendidikan Solat Anak-anak : Satu Kajian Di Felda Bukit Damar, Lanchang, Pahang","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

We give a formal semantics for BRN in terms of transition systems which formalizes the evolution rules given by Rene Thomas. Then we show how to use this model to find interesting properties of a BRN like the set of stable states, cycles etc using tools for analyzing transition systems.","inCitations":["f353a9e13000d44bb23c3749e7c97a15dda69d69","5ee0b1bf844c03ecaff7d232b1e9fab447ecf951","af02d9d19634ae41bf2eee2d73cb1d90c0059d9a","68d0627c28297f9a60885b5eba805dfa02f53107","2004ee14a4361bab9c1fd3272c2e42d7ed4b76e1","86dbbd619af71511393f393d7921f55bfe212559","f504ca59645b74210d60d7a211f372be1921d26c","6582cae2b16ba76d33b0245f84778947d54d9f67","9de8062eb1d9dd03f7e317ae101c4396bb82070f","44c9ebfd3e27f40d34667cb0a832221d11c4a625","fd637c68a6fa0d9ccbf3f35078234cff0f56d7f1","16deffd90fc0fdc4f89848c9f393d5a014fbceee","76890225bc37e5f29d9b02ba8b19f9bb83af1183","e72ef12636c57c4896abccfff046b27cdb8acba2","be0405e8efdddf7367587b5cf74d1e441f12c4ef","d4627a36179e3092adcb192ae3435af650fd05b5","d9f3e3550e3a7f41a8fc61aec701d760f764ed0b","5c000d922a089de89836f1dbed94d6d9973830cc","f10b6947e4a37abf50bb2f7678a92160a5e53da6","21c9be4f3e4eac94c0556456d46bc8b1fa474c65","a608cbcb52ce0b2d6d9b2f22721965142150a4c7","034ba58d0fb523f57c35740b098fe7a2347e1c09","44db30d0e72bd3b0b4b73cfddd90af75f3c289ab","f81a0ed56e40bbb1f1a0f1fe6c8a0fe1d68401e7","990defb47e88fff7cd24620335845020424e6a71","b961217cb25202d76cf0e5b17c1dcf75382e0eab","57a51b2f84d562ede5e3b40991b5523384d6c53b","1c1ae0214bde8f85cc14caae610fba1d016fa388","d4d4e3f9f4209f0a656b234451e4b107d0e70cb3","766477ec8683c2200775b1c0737e59e4fa879408","a279f51ad507a343e7b1f71e7f32566da6b0eecb","aa63996e44736e5dc444993bf8185b22f1db6e63","898b94ece70475823d817709dda67e9adf1c3aad","8795be381ccf45e37d0d9071f9374708a71ffb03","007a534fe377683849d9d886ec743184ea1cfb62","88818c96e47d153588b290665ca463caf861258e","1a8cd334166697745bcebec19097c03480469dfe","80a8cb76bebd88093c9bd16ae23fc11d647182e1","13930b11089ccda0dfef4f3e6d740f1180b28331","7d6e6756d2e7f2877386dd02869b88f7564d4815"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.irccyn.ec-nantes.fr/hebergement/Publications/2003/1800.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.entcs.2004.01.038","http://pagesperso.ls2n.fr/~roux-o/fichiers/conf/bccdmrr-bioconcur-2003.pdf","http://www.i3s.unice.fr/~comet/publications/ConfIntl-actes/workshopBioConcur2003-2.pdf","http://www.irccyn.fr/franck/bib/ps-pdf-files/bioconcur-entcs-07.pdf"],"title":"Semantics of Biological Regulatory Networks","doi":"10.1016/j.entcs.2004.01.038","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.entcs.2004.01.038","venue":"Electron.
