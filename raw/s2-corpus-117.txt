However, the reports about the safety of TAVI for patients with dextrocardia situs inversus are few. An 84-year-old man with dextrocardia situs inversus underwent a TAVI for severe aortic stenosis (AS) with an aortic valve area of 0.5 cm2, and a mean pressure gradient of 46 mmHg. Preoperative computed tomography (CT) revealed an inverted (rightward) orientation of the ventricle apex as well as the great vessels. The TAVI was performed through a transfemoral approach under general anesthesia. A left and right reversed fluoroscopic image was used for the TAVI. Finally, a 26-mm CoreValve Evolut R (Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN, USA) was successfully deployed at the aortic annulus under angiographic guidance. Post-procedural transthoracic echocardiography demonstrated a well-functioning CoreValve Evolut R with a mean pressure gradient of 8 mmHg. No complications occurred during the procedure or peri-procedural period. The patient's symptoms subsequently improved from New York Heart Association class III to class I. In conclusion, a TAVI procedure was safely performed in a patient with dextrocardia situs inversus through a transfemoral approach by evaluating the anatomical details with preoperative CT. <Learning objective: Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has evolved into a standard therapy for aged patients with severe aortic valve stenosis who are not candidates for surgery. On the other hand, dextrocardia situs inversus is associated with a number of additional cardiac and vascular malformations. In this case, we report on a case in which a TAVI procedure was safely performed in a patient with dextrocardia situs inversus through a transfemoral approach.>.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Transcatheter aortic valve implantation for severe aortic stenosis in dextrocardia with situs inversus using a self-expanding aortic valve.","doi":"10.1016/j.jccase.2018.02.004","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jccase.2018.02.004","venue":"Journal of cardiology cases"}

This change in the nature of Soviet foreign tourism was particularly explicit in the ways the Soviet authorities organized and framed travel to peripheries such as the Latvian Soviet Socialist Republic for the sake of earning profit for the Soviet state. As tourism to Latvia increased and drew a larger and more diverse tourist population, the ethnic uniqueness of Latvians and their culture took precedence over demonstrations of the general superiority of Communist society. These arguments are substantiated with archival materials from the Riga branch of Inturist (the Central Administration of Foreign Tourism under the USSR Council of Ministers) stored in Latvia's Central State Archives in Riga.","inCitations":["d72feec7cd13749c6a9dab73918344c460483c11"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Soviet Inturist and Foreign Travel to the Latvian SSR in the Post-Stalin Era: A Case of Ethnic Tourism","doi":"10.1162/jcws_a_00816","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1162/jcws_a_00816","venue":"Journal of Cold War Studies"}

For these purposes, IO accounts have to adhere to a uniform nomenclature of products and economic activities in accordance with international standards. After 2004, there was a break in the annual construction of Russian IO accounts. This break was due to the transition of national statistics to the OKVED (All-Russian Classifier of Activities) and the OKPD (All-Russian Classifier of Products by Activity) classifications that are harmonized with the CPA and NACE rev. 1. Construction of benchmark IO accounts based on the new classifications for 2011 will be completed at the end of 2015. We have the opportunity to reconstruct a time series of comparable IO accounts based on the new classifications as a result of the development of national accounts, improvements in information, accumulation of methodological developments and experience in formulating expert assessments of IO Accounts. Work on the reconstruction of the time series of IO accounts has been underway at the National Research University Higher School of Economics (NRU HSE) since 2010. The starting point selected for this analysis and the last year for which there is required information for this procedure is 2003. Our methodology is based on the international System of National Accounting (SNA) including IO accounts, as well as mathematical modeling of inter-industry research. As part of the work for 2010-2013, we developed a methodology to transform the IO accounts for 2003 from the Soviet classifications into the new classifications. We also construct the use table of domestic goods and services at basic prices, the use table of imports at basic prices, the table of transport margins, the table of trade margins, and the table of net taxes on products. In addition, we calculate the use table at purchasers' prices on the NACE rev.1/OKPD basis as the sum of all listed tables. When constructing these IO accounts, we identified a lack of numerical values for the correspondence tables and a lack of agreement between the national account totals and the column and row totals of the transformed IO accounts for 2003. An iterative method of reconstructing the IO accounts from Soviet classifications to the OKVED and OKPD classifications has been developed and applied. To date, we have developed an algorithm for constructing time series of IO accounts based on the new classifications for 2004 and subsequent years based on the transformed IO accounts for 2003. A time series of IO accounts (consisting of the tables listed above) at current prices, as well as a use table of goods and services at basic prices and previous years’ prices, has been developed. This research provides the basis for the refinement of the methodology for constructing IO accounts, and the retrospective restatement of these time series to allow more detailed nomenclature of economic activities and types of goods and services after the official publication of the benchmark IO accounts for 2011. 1 Higher School of Economics (Moscow, Russia). “Development Centre” Institute.

Specifically, this work proposes and devises a simple self-healing Ethernet PON architecture that supports a truly shared LAN capability among end users. The main characteristic of the proposed architecture is that it supports a fully distributed control plane among the optical network units (ONUs) for ONU-to-ONU communication. The control plane supports fully distributed fault detection and recovery mechanisms as well as a decentralized dynamic bandwidth allocation scheme in which the optical line terminator is excluded from both the bandwidth arbitration and fault detection and recovery processes. The proposed decentralized automatic protection switching technique is capable of protecting against both node (ONU) and fiber failures (distribution and trunk) through active participation of ONUs. This scheme enables the recovery of all network traffic including upstream, downstream, and LAN data. In addition, the proposed protection technique can protect against any combination of concurrent double failures including trunk and distribution fiber breaks and node failures.","inCitations":["e60fefe9660d1ad6e7b4823abc6d9a2e1bd7d1d5"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Survivable broadband local access PON architecture: a new direction for supporting simple and efficient resilience capabilities","doi":"10.1364/JON.7.000645","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1364/JON.7.000645","venue":""}

Animal model of RA is used to evaluate the inflammatory condition and for diagnosing the disease. Although various imaging modalities like x-rays, CT and MRI are available in evaluation and diagnosing the disease, those modalities are expensive and have radiation effects. Thermal imaging plays a vital role in evaluation and monitoring the inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis Thermal imaging is a non invasive method for detecting the pathogenesis of the disease compared to other diagnostic methods. The objectives of this study were: i) to measure the changes in skin temperature of induced RA limbs when comparing to normal; ii) to find out the efficacy of an automated segmentation of induced RA limbs using the following image processing techniques: a) Robert edge detector; b) Canny edge detector; and c) Adaptive thresholding technique. 0.2ml of mixture of freunds complete adjuvant (FCA) mixed with a phosphate buffer saline at 1∶1 was injected at right side both hind- and fore- limbs of the Wistar rats (n=10), whereas normal saline was injected at left side both hind- and fore- limbs of the rats. After having induced RA in the limbs of the rats (after 30 days), thermal image of each rat was obtained under standard conditions. The measured mean temperature (°C) was found to be higher by 1.8% and 2.0% respectively at RA hind and fore limbs respectively than in the corresponding normal limbs. Adaptive thresholding method was found to be the best of method studied in segmenting the induced RA limb of the rat.","inCitations":["113d0eb76757aa0a26c7d66e17534e76fd833070","04d1753653982ed5d5e56ec1e4d767e92092447e","17db6ae0f38113b359c2a1c9bf400417114f7a84","b64b1120255d8a88d0f1d2d73fb84d89223c05a7","0e81673ad4faebf79a7f17584fa61cb6e6808009"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Evaluation of rheumatoid arthritis in small animal model using Thermal imaging","doi":"10.1109/ICSCCN.2011.6024658","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSCCN.2011.6024658","venue":"2011 International Conference on Signal Processing, Communication, Computing and Networking Technologies"}

A reliable range of heat flux for the calculation of thermal conductivity is determined by the comparative study of NEMD simulations with different heat fluxes. The remarkable dependence of thermal conductivity on the length of nanostructures is observed. It is also found that the thermal conductivity is less sensitive to the cross-section area perpendicular to the heat flux than to the length of Si nanostructures. Based on the relationship between the thermal conductivity and the nanostructure length, the thermal conductivity and the phonon mean-free path of the infinite bulk Si system are extrapolated.","inCitations":["d46f9cd6ad0f7028d7f1438e6ca48ddcab302a8f","ab181416a8747f443b6c58f42e078d567c484746","8112a573cc0915a4c950992a52da1446acb8d7d2","9a14b2dee207059e85fee6ebfee2680d6a75b3ff","c998968f235bec3d8d57a53c2dcfe2cbc08a5036"],"pdfUrls":["https://briefs.techconnect.org/wp-content/volumes/Nanotech2007v1/pdf/550.pdf"],"title":"Nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulation for size effects on thermal conductivity of Si nanostructures","doi":"10.1080/08927020701730419","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1080/08927020701730419","venue":""}

Durante a producao dos simbolos foi utilizada uma impressora 3D, do tipo Prusa por fusao de ABS. Os simbolos produzidos geraram a representacao de um mapa de orientacao ao visitante. Eles foram desenvolvidos com a participacao de um graduando de 24 anos, totalmente cego desde os 15 anos. Quatro entrevistas permitiram avaliar a eﬁcacia dos simbolos e apos cada entrevista os resultados eram analisados, discutidos e implementados numa nova versao. Finalmente foi construido um mapa tatil de localizacao do primeiro pavimento do predio principal da UFRRJ. A eﬁciencia do mapa foi testada pela medida do tempo de execucao de cinco tarefas propostas ao avaliador do mapa. As experiencias estabeleceram aspectos importantes em relacao a producao de simbolos tateis. Foi observado que o simbolo associado ao braille tem grande potencial, mas a construcao apresentada ainda nao obteve resultados aceitaveis por nao resistir ao manuseio. A solucao parcial foi a associacao de tecnicas artesanais no acabamento do simbolo tatil. Outra conclusao foi a necessidade de treinamento do usuario para a compreensao de simbolos que venham a fazer a associacao pictorica de signiﬁcado. O avaliador levou cerca de 16 minutos para executar 5 tarefas pre-estabelecidas. O layout do mapa e a legenda precisam de maiores estudos pois revelam paradigmas originados da necessidade ergonomica do leitor e dos requisitos da escrita braille.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Produção De Símbolos Táteis Construídos Com Impressora 3d Para Mapas De Orientação Ao Visitante","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

If a conservation perspective were taught in secondary schools, students who are not interested in biology could be influenced to pursue careers or live lifestyles that would reduce the negative impact of humans on the world. We use what we call the ecology-disrupted approach to transform the topics of conservation biology research into environmental-issue and ecology topics, the major themes of secondary school courses in environmental science. In this model, students learn about the importance and complexity of normal ecological processes by studying what goes wrong when people disrupt them (environmental issues). Many studies published in Conservation Biology are related in some way to the ecological principles being taught in secondary schools. Describing research in conservation biology in the language of ecology curricula in secondary schools can help bring these science stories to the classroom and give them a context in which they can be understood by students. Without this context in the curriculum, a science story can devolve into just another environmental issue that has no immediate effect on the daily lives of students. Nevertheless, if the research is placed in the context of larger ecological processes that are being taught, students can gain a better understanding of ecology and a better understanding of their effect on the world.","inCitations":["87e80e4e748249b29bb27f0fef621a2be175b270","3af94b55010df8166924eec6b9ed8648eb0164ad","6a23f807bfaf03a80a6ca732f4ffef6f3b44196e","02eb2e55d97175ff3b1a19be8a22c6455de49f6c","4a339cbdbe315fcd2d2b1a70b38d5ff15773cd84","ac84670aa889e18aaa3943e94139b44d1001d754","9263257ec48775aa391e352630609ad9c3730083","33f50f1e2034444f2ef22c39da57dc8a9d0a20ca","cf3c4f68b9e2fc82f68a59cdeca8dfb297138903","de63b16f3f3d46232b3601cbaad729e2a259e7d0","074ce7f6117cf039a6c6f8a8edbcffebde0e2a44"],"pdfUrls":["http://research.amnh.org/users/desalle/pdf/Wyner.2010.ConservBiol.pdf","http://desalle.amnh.org/pdf/Wyner.2010.ConservBiol.pdf"],"title":"Taking the conservation biology perspective to secondary school classrooms.","doi":"10.1111/j.1523-1739.2010.01478.x","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1523-1739.2010.01478.x","venue":"Conservation biology : the journal of the Society for Conservation Biology"}

At an average fiber laser power of 3.6 W, the SRO generates 1.9-micros-long pulses with a repetition rate of 25 kHz and an average power of 560 mW at 3360 nm. The SRO was tuned from 1518 to 1634 nm (signal) and from 3145 to 3689 nm (idler) via the crystal temperature and poling period.

In addition to traffic volume, there is a comprehensive set of parameters that also cause a time dependency of speeds on autobahns. Speed-flow relationships play a key role in the determination of the type of highway for a given design flow and a given desired traffic flow quality. The question, however, is whether the speed-flow relationships from the guidelines are reliable over longer periods and to what extent the shortterm speed variations are larger than the flow dependencies. Therefore, the objective of this research project was to determine typical fluctuations of average speeds on autobahns that are not the result of different volumes. Moreover, the consequences of differing speed-flow relationships on the maximum flow (i.e., capacity) should be pointed out. Studies of influences on the speed-flow relationships for German autobahns are presented.

We have previously demonstrated that most PDAC patients have circulating antibodies against the glycolytic enzyme alpha-enolase (ENO1), which correlates with a better response to therapy and survival. ENO1 is a metabolic enzyme, also expressed on the cell surface where it acts as a plasminogen receptor. ENO1 play a crucial role in cell invasion and metastasis by promoting plasminogen activation into plasmin, a serine-protease involved in extracellular matrix degradation. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of ENO1 in PDAC cell invasion. We observed that ENO1 was expressed on the cell surface of most PDAC cell lines. Mouse anti-human ENO1 monoclonal antibodies inhibited plasminogen-dependent invasion of human PDAC cells, and their metastatic spreading in immunosuppressed mice was inhibited. Notably, a single administration of Adeno-Associated Virus (AAV)-expressing cDNA coding for 72/1 anti-ENO1 mAb reduced the number of lung metastases in immunosuppressed mice injected with PDAC cells. Overall, these data indicate that ENO1 is involved in PDAC cell invasion, and that administration of an anti-ENO1 mAb can be exploited as a novel therapeutic option to increase the survival of metastatic PDAC patients.","inCitations":["d9bf9b69f54a1e705cfb61b8a62215742a43422f","85ade9bfeb551213ccfbb4fa40005d78c7435875","c206f559d98edd010986d66b9ddd11f4dd01a0d5","ffbb16de9b19f0e601a31abe085e41995cb5d176","45d322639f72924183a2178f1e60f92d45a15eba","740b2fcf4499307d08b6c2717d0f987f140012b6","3738d80858f28fec0fee98e6120a0ad874d4fc31","a1a576c3580a3ca50066029727ce0e4a75045fda","2bf984ff2c65cb4f7012e80bc06ef4a47f775c32","a127465df1c6ab94f2d0fe3695268c019c2f773e","bdf7f968c0fb05271d1c647d8923189393dd28ff","0bfc0d8edae88d1ebea841263b9d546fc30fd912","979cb9fcede7d903006bc8bb4a018d2a1e9f7605","054888362f76c62a2b88114c0a6239b688ed0e64","c14deb70c09c41b7e73300eff64dbe2eec89ac8c","2d001179df93d62ea2fa082e4acae0e59d61c1af","f9262034013f0bcb2231e2e4d6b736dfcac596d6","d564e83ceea76194eccc5e935b65b0c1685d15a4","f6f3a65959a320ce974e259cde683fd9342bfa2d","09de12cbce6000ac361776f2f00596cbddb8cfdd","30320c403eb513ad74e2cbe25a58dd636322665f","336c45a049562aaaccd73278c7d99cdd1de2aaa6","bacdf367e3c5217a5343839c370d082a81b44139","519256fa647bfed0269cd93782d84e56a7ba925c","cacfcdf491f4d7796b086a7cad0db61010a5205f","cad212673fec34cf4d14554d4ed933bfa564d893","45121f4e3c9f1cfbd1a1fb63bc31d054b45d9cdd","35610312757f41453115abbfe8085aa89e49760e","1902527bf775cfa227c63cdf0eec643a2de8e5b1","736e964cf34326fe083c85755b09d3c5820d4a5d","d52cf70c7cc8241519040b289fc526c2cb720225","77126a2536a4b80cd5ed86e6352b474e4311c29c","bc6d1086e7c46cbd0f0ab5aec375285bf07f20f8","3355108869849d92022b5c3cbf16cc46774f6d2b"],"pdfUrls":["https://iris.unito.it/retrieve/handle/2318/1529048/66053/Oncotarget2015.pdf","http://www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget/index.php?journal=oncotarget&op=download&page=article&path%5B%5D=3572&path%5B%5D=7227","https://arpi.unipi.it/retrieve/handle/11568/764485/251743/Migliorini_764485.pdf"],"title":"Targeting of surface alpha-enolase inhibits the invasiveness of pancreatic cancer cells","doi":"10.18632/oncotarget.3572","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.18632/oncotarget.3572","venue":"Oncotarget"}

Povos isolados geografica e culturalmente, por meio de acoes coletivas, instalaram e mantiveram um modelo comunitario de vivencia, no qual a maioria das normas era estabelecida a partir das liderancas constituidas. Os nucleos foram projetados para acolher todas as formas associativas da comunidade (Igreja, clubes, escola, cemiterio e areas de lazer). Em meio a selva, onde a sobrevivencia somente foi possivel mediante a criacao de um laco social horizontal, as 100 familias, as quais, em media, compunham uma comunidade, construiram escola, sedes sociais, estradas, hospitais e estabeleceram um conjunto de normas que atravessou todo o tecido social. No universo pioneiro, algumas caracteristicas serviam de andaime e alicerce, ideais se cruzavam no espaco da familia, na escola e na vida social. Regras sociais e costumes foram paulatinamente incorporados a partir de mecanismos de coercao social. Sem parâmetros exogenos, as instâncias da familia, escola, comunidade e religiao transmitiram os valores e os ideais da cultura. A comunidade, por intermedio de sua coesao, controle e coercao, foi determinante na imposicao de valores e de um conjunto de normas que disciplinava a vivencia coletiva e, por conseguinte, inibia a violencia. A presenca do Estado e a entrada mais agressiva do capitalismo destituiu o modelo de autocontrole comunitario na segunda metade do seculo XX. E, nesse turbilhao, as praticas economicas, sociais, religiosas e educacionais ganham nova subjetivacao. O objetivo deste artigo foi apresentar as caracteristicas do modelo tradicional de comunidade e do autocontrole da violencia a partir do mecanismo de coesao social. A escritura apresenta dois blocos teoricos: o primeiro, de cunho historico, apresenta uma retrospectiva acerca da criacao do Estado e sua relacao coercitiva sobre a populacao, e o segundo enfatiza o poder comunitario e o autocontrole da populacao sobre os membros que a constituem.

They are used for pretraining, finetuning, and rescoring in downstream applications, and as is as a test-bed and benchmark for progress in natural language understanding. One fundamental question regards the way we should generate text from a language model. It is well known that different decoding strategies can have dramatic impact on the quality of the generated text and using the most likely sequence under the model distribution, e.g., via beam search, generally leads to degenerate and repetitive outputs. \nWhile generation strategies such as top-k and nucleus sampling lead to more natural and less repetitive generations, the true cost of avoiding the highest scoring solution is hard to quantify. In this paper, we argue that verifiability, i.e., the consistency of the generated text with factual knowledge, is a suitable metric for measuring this cost. We use an automatic fact-checking system to calculate new metrics as a function of the number of supported claims per sentence and find that sampling-based generation strategies, such as top-k, indeed lead to less verifiable text. This finding holds across various dimensions, such as model size, training data size and parameters of the generation strategy. Based on this finding, we introduce a simple and effective generation strategy for producing non-repetitive and more verifiable (in comparison to other methods) text.","inCitations":["c44120f765fc43994c5cfb4e12e4f62999efeae6","9b539d413393047b28bb7be9b195f142aaf7a80e","911c2963e557fffa837aed4bf594cf9c117d8aee"],"pdfUrls":["https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.03587v1.pdf","http://arxiv.org/abs/1911.03587"],"title":"How Decoding Strategies Affect the Verifiability of Generated Text","doi":"","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"ArXiv"}

The results reveal that tuyeres, slags and refractory tools can be associated with an iron ore smelting process to extract the metal by slagging the unwanted by-products. Moreover, temperature and duration of the smelting process have been estimated through mineralogical studies and by a comparative analysis between the micro-chemical and structural features of thermally treated refractory materials and tuyeres. The results disclose the high level of technological competence of the ancient metallurgists able to carry out complex high-temperature processes to extract iron from ores by separating the metal from unwanted siliceous species.","inCitations":["4f9fb49f0744436a9dc2389e20a13cb39c5bff90"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Archaeo-metallurgical studies of tuyeres and smelting slags found at Tharros (north-western Sardinia, Italy)","doi":"10.1007/s00339-013-7720-5","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00339-013-7720-5","venue":""}

Shelf-life were observed at room temperature 0f 25oC -30oC and refrigerator at 10o C – 15oC condition .in a couple of months, from July 11. 2011 to July 12, 2012 , found no contamination nor spoilage. Acceptability of the dried pickled seaweed products were done, through unstructured method: attributes. Results in the unstructured attributes noted that the descriptive attributes on degree of drying and Treatment , showed no significant differences at .05 and .01 level of significant in terms of color, sweetness, sourness, saltiness, spicy flavor, seaweed flavor, hardness, roughness, gumminess, tooth packing, and moist absorption. However, Treatment in terms of saltiness, and gumminess showed a significant difference and tooth packing showed highly significant at 0.05 and 0.01 level of significance. While the degree of drying and treatment, results in acceptability attributes in terms of color, overall appearance, sweetness, sourness, spicy flavor, seaweed flavor, overall flavor overall texture also showed no significant difference at .05 and .01 level of significant, except saltiness, it showed a significant difference in degree of drying and Treatment, and overall appearance is highly significant at 0.05 and 0.01 level of significance. The return of investment noted that T2-Light has the highest ROI of 56.41%-52.25%, followed by T1-Hot & Spicy with 50.72% - 44.91%, and T3-Honey has11.22% 6.56.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Acceptability of Dried Pickled Seaweed","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

In 1986, the EU passed a Directive specifying a minimum size for cages, but public opinion-again particularly in the North-continued to require more. A market sector emerged that would pay more for noncage eggs. Denmark, Sweden, and Switzerland passed more stringent legislation than the rest of Europe. A 1999 Directive with details based on advice from the EU's Scientific Veterinary Committee will phase out conventional laying cages but allow enriched cages. Implementation depends on various factors, including negotiations in the World Trade Organization. In the next 10 years, however, major changes to the housing of most laying hens in Europe almost certainly will occur. Similar changes in other countries will follow. As in Europe, change probably will be piecemeal, affected both by public pressure and by all sectors of society: producers, retailers, consumers, legislators, and the media.","inCitations":["cd3764402c4eafacfc6fb80383cf88db5dad4a0c","18e3dd558b99cc1b7e1bb4e64bcebfa156c50db0","afdf673565d2c4f69259a47e6d7dc98161992433","fc7cacb771311a8fa911ec437b95bcf712bd0de5","33a3964a9252817e08688b70de28460b24006a50","a04c7039e7fda58cf7008bb7cbda9d5a8e075bb1","e1a952d0f35a3780f6217f52b60236a3d41ecc3e","883d48f23c24cf1cc2f2171b9d20dd46d5c7e319","2ec919fdbcfb0366e780a57e1de1692eeef7bf7b","478ccf1040664698fce47339143dc5a7d73f0c5b","6c35293b7ce56a931d97f58c45f571dd8c004ee5","edec680eed036d974754638366e472a8fa691406","ac646f26bb60bfdcfe927439e0398781a7591704","a73a36c51751d80053b5b6a807f948e2a27d8c13","cae0e9838d63fb456ffbc9b2ca36f1de393dde42","1f6ad5e5c7de91813c2ffaf1c1fc79dbbf68d4c9","4dfc3553d7dea0e886e867514de6d1d91379015f","1ebcfcdb2aa05d93f0b8e6c7728f8698c79e153c","dca615555e91355a37c3c6970e3b628957aacf57","79b5ad31479f95492908e17ae656d2d3b86f4724","f2fe785a4dc2eb25bbff2129f952ae4108599eb1","4ff991a9142daa27a1eedf7ae2959d4ad85d3092","c071f5913f98923e203a58a35aa0c59b9d92692d","a91607da3f020d3d79a177b816b46b8f6c2f2670","e488c681bb346942fd06e1f3dcb64cd8666423b6","0df10683fd5ad1eff1790a87b8bb3b0f4ce98b1a","231767e6a1c0e95434a86f2d977ca2074ff704f6","9592ead094d74ab7a5069e4291df9a434703b84a","c82cbe8078382d7606dd51b40d6893a925ab907b","6e84417112c037205575eba51622d2ebb79c63e4","023daf3c8a71498e26790d1c5d6ed71e6febbdfd","dc4fc38b24848dbe1848b43500534c5151baafa2","21636a897dd36fc3bad90883e5bbe6e81cee425b","f08d1f257b44d699ecef1e222483577fff57f77b","dc9170076b8dbca512339ee101a4b24af5a9e8af","bd20ce2fabcf3cc656449c1908dc87b7579ebdd5","88aba138087d8c6aed3642b5ba1fcf8b4111477d","d9d1a69f082bb8f715f198fc3481d5efa13aa988","58dc6dc84a9378c5ee34352189f2d7a0b70bc580","17ce00e05bdda1941cf91f095784e988b47e2884","b7aee3f91f907f7749123c319af2e5feda0d2340"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.animalsandsociety.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/103-121-The-European-Union-Ban-on-Conventional-Cages-for-Laying-Hens-History-and-Prospects.pdf"],"title":"The European Union Ban on Conventional Cages for Laying Hens: History and Prospects","doi":"10.1207/S15327604JAWS0602_03","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1207/S15327604JAWS0602_03","venue":"Journal of applied animal welfare science : JAAWS"}

The mitotic index (number of mitoses per 1000 gland cells) was evaluated in the colonic mucosa of 14 healthy subjects, 11 patients with cholelithiasis, before and 6 months after surgery, and 10 patients who had undergone cholecystectomy 2 or more years previously. The mitotic index of cholecystectomized patients was significantly higher than controls. It rose significantly within 6 months of cholecystectomy. The mitotic index of patients with cholelithiasis before surgery was similar to controls. These data suggest that cholecystectomy is followed by an enhancement in the proliferative activity of the colonic mucosa, which could play a cancer-promoting role.","inCitations":["237c8977bcaf0e32b26d296f0d101d88c2e4d4fe","404a8b67e4838ca6354ecd23b6c3f588d0516ad5","40257ecd8c275a81f3c1c8fef6beb59a51f26d4b","6273f814f55185d4126e84fbe1d94fcd06e8cfaa","fccad74c9839371c94e23353847b105142fd66e0"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Increase of the mitotic index of colonic mucosa after cholecystectomy.","doi":"","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"Cancer"}

One common approach is to isolate and analyze tumor cells in the peripheral blood. Widespread clinical implementation of this approach has been hindered by the current choice of targeting epithelial markers known to be highly variable in primary tumor sites. Here, we review current antigen-based tumor cell isolation strategies and offer biological context for commonly studied cancer surface markers. Expression levels of the most common markers are quantitated for three breast cancer and two non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) lineage models. These levels are contrasted with that present on healthy peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) for comparison to expected background levels in a fluid biopsy setting. A key feature of this work is establishing a metric of markers per square micrometer. This describes an average marker density on the cell membrane surface, which is a critical metric for emerging isolation strategies. These results serve to extend expression of key tumor markers in a sensitive and dynamic manner beyond traditional positive/negative immunohistochemical staining to guide future fluid biopsy targeting strategies.","inCitations":["253bb03632ce8c396e4231e0421d296a6ff897a6","85e72ca5947234c837d97b8eb25b11d024e5dfa3","de062800fac5706e2a3b111211aa993b31fd9818","23afabaa9bcbe6cd3904d1261e8240c31958e6f1","3bbbe713cd72b1041315ac0552273802eb871f0b","adc7d6ce2c127e200be1a0d38cb5fdc7dea1fa84","8153a5e30c9b80d0bd8e23115356646ceb745fe6"],"pdfUrls":["https://uknowledge.uky.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1012&context=cme_facpub","http://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/pmc/a3/04/bcbcr-suppl.1-2015-001.PMC4517843.pdf","https://uknowledge.uky.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1012&context=cme_facpub&httpsredir=1&referer=","http://insights.sagepub.com/redirect_file.php?fileId=6652&fileType=pdf&filename=4968-BCBCR-A-Quantitative-Perspective-on-Surface-Marker-Selection-for-the-Isolati.pdf"],"title":"A Quantitative Perspective on Surface Marker Selection for the Isolation of Functional Tumor Cells","doi":"10.4137/BCBCR.S25461","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.4137/BCBCR.S25461","venue":"Breast cancer : basic and clinical research"}

T2 biomarkers in the form of fraction exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO), peripheral blood eosinophils (PBE), and serum periostin are easier to measure and probable surrogate markers for induced sputum eosinophilia (ISE). The relationships between PBE, FeNO and periostin particularly in refractory asthma have been conflicting. A composite score of T2 biomarkers has also been postulated to predict exacerbations and may be more sensitive. 1 Aim To explore the relationship between the T2 biomarkers individually, and in the form of composite score to asthma exacerbations and control. Methods Unselected consecutive patients with confirmed diagnosis of refractory asthma (ATS) attending a tertiary severe asthma centre were recruited following an informed consent. Participants were evaluated for the followings: demographics, exacerbations requiring corticosteroids in the preceding 12 months, asthma control questionnaire (Juniper ACQ7), lung function, FeNO, PBE, and periostin measurement. The composite T2 score of all the 3 biomarkers was calculated as previously reported (reference). Statistical analyses were conducted using MedCalc software. Results One-hundred and fifteen patients were recruited with mean age 45 yrs, 88 (69.8%) females, mean inhaled corticosteroids (BDP equivalent) = 1,647 µg/day, on maintenance OCS = 63 (55%), mean FEV1 = 2.0 L (SD1.8–2.1), FEV1% pred = 68%, and mean FEV1/FVC ratio = 71% (SD = 68–74). A significant positive correlation between FeNO and PBE was observed (r = 0.39, p = 0.004), but not with periostin. Only FeNO significantly correlated to exacerbations (r = 0.42, p = 0.0008) and only periostin correlated significantly to ACQ7 score (r = 0.33, p = 0.0053). In addition, the biomarkers composite score significantly correlated with exacerbations (r = 0.4, p = 0.0031) (Figure 1), but not ACQ7. Conclusion In real life settings, FeNO correlated with historical exacerbations and the T2 composite score displayed a dose response correlation with exacerbations frequency. Periostin correlated with ACQ7 but not exacerbations. Further research is required to confirm these findings. Reference 1 Heaney LG, et al .

Also building envelope has the most important role in conditioning inside and affecting from the outside environment, as it is called other skin for human. considering the built environment a system which imposed itself to natural environment systems, the building envelope may have systematic environmental function which can adjust, control, supply ,connect, exchange, interact between inside and outside and act as mediator. So it would be a subsystem of the buildings which can have an intrinsic goal of providing human comfort and architectural needs while supporting an extrinsic goal of participating in natural environment stability and coordination with natural context. They can be the mediator of connecting two systems. So they would be the entrance and exit of one system to another which can exchange matter, energy and information with the environment and work as open systems. To integrate better the natural and built environment the envelopes must have some properties that can be categorize as multi-functional, interacting, conditioning, supplying and supporting. Also there can be specialized parts in its structure and function to help achieving its defined goals.","inCitations":["9b93a321c1f9ea6654dedea26b669eeb489aa24a","746ac9ee5de7db716bc33ae1b6db8a22aa4e90cf"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Building Envelope As an Environmental Apparatus: Integrating Architectural and Natural Systems","doi":"10.1061/9780784412688.032","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1061/9780784412688.032","venue":""}

The effect of these variants on the cellular immune response was studied in individuals vaccinated against HBV. Class-II restricted T-cell responses of 30 vaccinees were analyzed after stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) with 4 synthetic peptides representing the 4 T-cell epitopes of HBsAg known as of yet. The 2 epitopes P1 (aa 16-33) and P4 (aa 213-226) could be identified as the dominant ones in our vaccinees by proliferation assays and enzyme-linked immunospot assays. Responses to these epitopes were compared with responses to their naturally occurring variants found in HBV isolates of chronic virus carriers. Three of 11 variants of epitope P4 led to a complete loss of T-cell reactivity in 4 of 10 donors, all of whom reacted well to the corresponding wild-type sequence. The remaining 6 donors recognized these variants as well as the vaccine epitope. Similarly, 3 P1-variants of the 12 found induced only a significantly reduced reactivity in 4 of 10 donors, whereas they led to a normal response in the other 6 individuals. Stimulation of T cells also induced the secretion of antibody to HBsAg (anti-HBs) by specific B cells; however, those peptides that failed to activate T cells were also unable to cause any significant anti-HBs production. In conclusion, our results suggest an immune escape of certain mutant strains of HBV in vaccinated individuals could exist at the T-cell level.","inCitations":["45a4d5c7cf8da5f57dd11b8040b0549790db2fb1","f385353bb029b475e7b91371a586ce98d295c58a","99435c1b66667df9929c0a6bd90a5e7874d206f3","02ac064f6c68176c3fcfdc58e452658ebf50bd01","763bd7267946f6c372982ced02f97a8e2d197e31","265573a7719e1a65c00ae17bc52196db762d00d3","7ab814d154453f83bd4b796d44f3bf49acfa4c84","76e9417af38207685ab4a99376cd8790a7942ee5","8189d1e3e8bd03f5b8a0d2a1a0dfe979d1b79020","b112475fb1960818da1281889e4ac77711abecb4","a5003ab5589036448542299590dd1a6679042d5c","9011d31a4c8b944d52337f0ab22af3826d4aa6aa","ec8a989eab9d736c541ae8f1108d406c5ae9b615","246cf736fb7a7ecf91747bd2987ce9fcde2aed13","cab1b2c82cb9e6c820c1a6395d1428a54de4e29a","243bce94548d086b1f962604373d0ae283e573da","a4bf3891bc26cbbe27121d05d2a175fb2be53a8a","121e9ff877abde206bc06b3ed6c9bc72ab75d957","b243f9ee9e12ec8a779a9ce85fa4fd94d42128bb","e7f6f85bde492468f9746e618a3d75a3a6a90efe","e3681ceb79e63a51c53e483dd2396993b9f9031a","8292f80ebc2959b2609d351a35c95d87cd4ecdbc"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Variants of two major T cell epitopes within the hepatitis B surface antigen are not recognized by specific T helper cells of vaccinated individuals.","doi":"10.1053/jhep.2002.30903","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1053/jhep.2002.30903","venue":"Hepatology"}

However, count-location models are also useful, particularly to capture the biological requirement of at least one chiasma per chromosome. The Sturt model and truncated Poisson model are both count-location models with this feature. We show that the truncated Poisson model can also be expressed as a stationary renewal model, while the Sturt model cannot. More generally, we show that there is only one family of count-location models for the chiasma process that can also be expressed as stationary renewal models. The models in this family can exhibit either positive or negative interference.","inCitations":["45ea6248f26223986777dce26d9ecfc487c5e87b","99ba6b2d3abc0388606f8ba50abb5845cf460afc","cbb49599eb0b7daf493b679a8b3f27f81adb5243","17d5a1193d9ba4bcdf9832e44d3e417b7594785c"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.genetics.org/content/genetics/155/4/1955.full.pdf"],"title":"The relationship between count-location and stationary renewal models for the chiasma process.","doi":"","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"Genetics"}

Difference between the parts of the globe that have been vicariously labelled “West” and “East” has been pointed out in many disciplines, however, this thesis explores the common ground that can be found between Chinese theory and affect studies (which has traditionally been inscribed inside the Euro-American film canon). This thesis will provide a new approach to the cognition and perception of a film. It will chart the perception processes that are undergone during a film experience without a linguistic interpretive or evaluative way. This thesis lies at the intersection of four disciplines including film studies, Chinese aesthetic studies, affect studies, and western philosophy. Using the representation of tea as a case study, this thesis argues that the idea of yijing is not only used to contribute national film theory but extensively promotes a new angle to consider the film in a philosophical perspective. Rather than negating any established approaches or apply a single approach in film cognitivism, this project combines ideas that are informed by both affect and cognitivist film studies inside the logic of Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari’s philosophical idea of schizoanalysis.

Four types of porous SF/HA composites (SF/HA-1, SF/HA-2, SF/HA-3, SF/HA-4) with different material ratios, pore sizes, porosity and additives were implanted subcutaneously into Sprague-Dawley rats to observe biodegradation. SF/HA-3, which had characteristics more suitable for a bone substitute based on strength and resorption was selected as a scaffold and co-cultured with rabbit bone-marrow stromal cells (BMSCs). A segmental bone defect was created in the rabbit radius. The animals were randomised into group 1 (SF/HA-3 combined with BMSCs implanted into the bone defect), group 2 (SF/HA implanted alone) and group 3 (nothing implanted). They were killed at four, eight and 12 weeks for visual, radiological and histological study. The bone defects had complete union for group 1 and partial union in group 2, 12 weeks after operation. There was no formation of new bone in group 3. We conclude that SF/HA-3 combined with BMSCs supports bone healing and offers potential as a bone-graft substitute.","inCitations":["19460e51c7509fdd051de85376ba6d884081fc03","e0a2bb66e4fd46c7f125677ee43f2bc88046a167","52388954b87c0088410bdf9831b095158e27bad3","d8e5f04beefdc32b9871a153aa61c5b5a38d61fe","5713b8ac517d95a95a4156fa4eefa4fdd5d734dc","227fc9ecc6c31e9df043541985c823eca3816410","be00bb3e50c11c923d9d8838f65202bafd6eceb8","5b32589568f77921bcc687545f21285daecd325a","7a520db8a0a374fe26ce7b53cd42fc5e80d87f5f","d63ddc875efb6e337dcef5d221e98a887e545a4d","3db8fed430cadc358ef198fe84709c8638d7ffe7","3e9a67b0a89089ec26975666ef9aa8bd7942c984","3857f6f6cbdb3ef6074e7942392dcdaee15ddb49","720e2b09282e01d7e61f544000e2d439b8a40a4e","ed8472136745fe76d2df47ba6b44419b482be3e2","812eea4d3d8433ba7c4a3228da1a506cfec61da8","8d54499b3ddc8191300440a337abd8da78fa60e3","c973e263a14b618db0fa8b2689cd5c7bccfa19b1","64fcd3e801cf546d26ba7e135218c669a83f7527","2f2f19810df33f789dc55123a9baeb22fb9f4d5a","27ec7efd9aa89559e574ed2215e41e6c9d8538bb"],"pdfUrls":["http://bjj.boneandjoint.org.uk/content/jbjsbr/92-B/2/320.full.pdf"],"title":"The use of silk fibroin/hydroxyapatite composite co-cultured with rabbit bone-marrow stromal cells in the healing of a segmental bone defect.","doi":"10.1302/0301-620X.92B2.22602","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1302/0301-620X.92B2.22602","venue":"The Journal of bone and joint surgery.

The effects of reaction temperature, catalyst, ratios of NCO/OH, co-polyether composition, and chain extender were investigated. Drug loading was studied by using thiamazole (hydrophilic drug), diclofenac sodium (slightly hydrophilic drug), and ibuprofen (lipophilic drug) as model drugs. In vitro drug-release kinetics obtained with Franz diffusion cell and dialysis membrane.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe results showed that when reaction temperature at 80 degrees C, weight percentage of stannous octoate as catalyst at 0.05%, ratio of NCO/OH at 2.0-2.2, ratio of PEG/polypropylene glycol (PPG)/polytetramethylene ether glycol (PTMG) at 30/25-30/50-55, and weight percentage of glycol as chain extender at 4.5%, PEGPU-PSAs synthesized performed well on adhesive properties. Actually, PEG on the main chain of the PU could improve the hydrophilicity of PSAs, whereas PPG and PTMG could offer proper adhesive properties. Skin compatibility test on volunteers indicated that PEG-PU-PSAs would not cause any skin irritations. All the model drugs had excellent stabilizations in PEG-PU-PSAs. In vitro drug-release kinetics demonstrated that the drug release depended on drug-loading level and solubility of the drug.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThese experimental results indicated that PEG-PU-PSAs have good potential for applications in TDDS.","inCitations":["b1f7ae6eb8e2e28ecb3ef6b97a2eaba655785671","f29aeb71bec746fb559f74def822f21d0732e597","3909016c8b72754593eb0bc00d7b7d97ccd1fa9c","0c7f400f4ce00c9756a2d934021ad16f218b6bfb","65799e78f1bb0fdef21194182fe0acf9d6d0fd99","34df8ff67916091d8bc8a25870478402912be3e9"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Preparation and characterization of PEG-modified polyurethane pressure-sensitive adhesives for transdermal drug delivery.","doi":"10.1080/03639040802512235","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1080/03639040802512235","venue":"Drug development and industrial pharmacy"}

Two different methods were used to inhibit selectively this incorporation process: (i) sensitivity to sulfhydryl reagents and (ii) heat inactivation. Of the sulfhydryl reagents tested, 2.2 mM iodoacetamide inhibited the synthesis of wall peptidoglycan 50%, whereas greater than 100 mM was required to inhibit the synthesis of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-soluble peptidoglycan. Heat treatment at 37 degrees C (t 1/2 = 5.7 min) inhibited wall peptidoglycan synthesis without affecting SDS-soluble peptidoglycan synthesis. Inhibition of LD-carboxypeptidase by iodoacetamide and heat gave 50% inhibition and t 1/2 values similar to those observed for the incorporation process.

To better understand the neuroplasticity of sympathetic neurons during early postnatal ontogenesis, this study was set up to immunocytochemically investigate the development of the catecholaminergic, cholinergic, and peptidergic phenotypes in the stellate ganglion of mice and rats. The present study was performed on Wistar rats and Swiss mice of different ages (newborn, 10-day-old, 20-day-old, 30-day-old, and 60-day-old). To this end, double labeling for tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), vasoactive intestinal (poly)peptide (VIP), neuropeptide Y (NPY), galanin (GAL), and somatostatin (SOM) was applied. The results obtained indicate that the majority of the neurons in the stellate ganglion of both species were TH-positive from birth onward and that a large part of these neurons also contained NPY. The percentage of neurons containing TH and NPY invariably increased with age up to 60 days postnatally. A smaller portion of the stellate ganglion neurons contained other types of neuropeptides and showed a distinct chronological pattern. The proportion of VIP- and ChAT-positive neurons was maximal in 10-day-old animals and then decreased up to 60 days of age, whereas the number of SOM-positive cells in rats significantly decreased from birth onward. In newborn rats, VIP-, ChAT- and SOM-positive neurons were largely TH-positive, while their proportions decreased in 10-day-old and older rats. Accordingly, the largest part of VIP-positive neurons also expressed SOM immunoreactivity at birth, after which the number of neurons containing both peptides diminished. The VIP- and SOM-positive cells did not contain NPY in any of the age groups studied. In rats up to 10 days of life, GAL-immunoreactive (-IR) neurons were scarce, after which their number increased to reach a maximal value in 30-day-old animals and then declined again. The SOM-reactive cells had the smallest size in all rats, while the largest neurons were those containing ChAT. In the mouse stellate ganglion, VIP- and ChAT-IR neurons were larger in comparison to NPY- and TH-IR cells. Our study further revealed some species differences: compared to mice the proportion of neurons containing TH and NPY was higher in rats at all ages under study. Furthermore, no GAL-immunostained neurons were found in mice and the number of SOM-positive cells in mice was limited compared to that observed in rats. In conclusion, the development of neurotransmitter composition is complete in rats and mice by their second month of life. At this age, the percentages of immunopositive cells have become similar to those reported in adult animals.","inCitations":["a774a7c466382abdbdd73c77c0945b925811053d","27b3b06412abf64460cd175c6b3fd849f38422e6","5a7aa7de594e7b057486cbf0cce7f284158185f3","d7da00c2e9db951cc4e3dc2905ac27b1befa6a04","6e441f32a1fec0c8fc585c1dbb394ac3dca3b355","31179ef81f8270b31521219c62c269ea19aa1982","710aca74ce7028ae696445c93816bc2d9e47dd12","a6effb3dbbcfc2a6a1698ffc7965b043bf5187df","496b1e7e357c664bf6e176d248833cf720ed0997","f583a366d6342d0606379f33f820a1e85a6462f2","7aadee6755b77126f3464318ae60584df02e023b","c28fae009ee6572e85aa5701434d64f8d02bf938","db79c592bddd0c1cb23b90cba4140387bdd5b6b3","5eb5d8ae2e62691e9988ee1b5614ea45a5804087","ca758df34742f7488e0c98de787a45ab73180022","58a6644f42a998bc2973081496fe32203db97ab4","b6bab41a9a536207f13c87b60b312f73f81682b4","4315cf9f3d7a7b0eb8e85a722c4ce20e332e50ad","3991331d3dcf0e4ec3543661d28650011f447e4d","b99aa692e3c38437fdf82c3deb5f1663287f8c0d","c9909549a696bf8b9ebf6e7f76d4e33cf7098b15","aa6a59c7e738c36f960dda2dbdf5d499f78596f4"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Immunocytochemical properties of stellate ganglion neurons during early postnatal development","doi":"10.1007/s00418-004-0692-y","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00418-004-0692-y","venue":"Histochemistry and Cell Biology"}

The central aim of this project is to illustrate cultural exchange in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries through the example of architectural decoration. In this ambit, three Cloisters have been considered until now; the cloister of Monreale (Sicily), the cloister of Sant’Orso in Aosta and the cloister of Cefalu (Sicily). For the most important capitals of these cloisters several high resolution digital images and highly detailed coloured 3D models have been produced. This big amount of data has been integrated in a web application where, textual descriptions, high resolution images and 3D models can be accessed from the same page for each capital. Moreover, a simple mechanism permits to compare images and models of capitals of any cloister: the user can select them during the exploration, and then a simple tool (called LightTable) can download and visualize them on the computer. In this way, it is possible to compare the selected elements, so that further similarities between them can be found and easily investigated. In conclusion, the CENOBIUM website is a successful integration example of different types of data, in the context of an environment which is devoted not only to the wide public, but also to the community of experts and scholars of the Romanesque art.","inCitations":["e41ffd8239ac948c2d11102cd052c39e3685a8d9","5c8c72099566b21de86cd99fd231599d12bd4650","83b23d9c80bb2b156e7216251ef30785a57a9ff5","723d8d0be02082ae907cd2bae1176c56249fefaa","c2fc8fd75b9d3fc59949328f7760830e8d5275ff","c8da720bbf4082024cbee1f787bce258a43195d0","3bfc414504076ed0b9029627fede42bd08049385","e5041d08c4741f4ba1091e2c6026a32062d6e5de","06f8d2f8df7231801c10c7aeecdf264f978522cf"],"pdfUrls":["http://cenobium.isti.cnr.it/pubs/2010%20Corsini%20et%20al_Cenobium%20-%20Putting%20together.pdf","http://www.ifla.org/files/assets/art-libraries/CENOBIUM_IFLA_NEU_20091125.pdf","http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/Publications/2010/CDDPCKMSSW10/cenobium_preprint.pdf","http://www.ifla.org/files/art-libraries/CENOBIUM_IFLA_NEU_20091125_0.pdf","http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/Publications/2009/CDDPCKMSSW09/cenobium_preprint.pdf"],"title":"CENOBIUM : putting together the Romanesque cloister capitals of the Mediterranean region","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

This article introduces an index to assess NGO regulation regarding barriers to entry, NGOs’ political capacity, and economic activity. Our cross-section analysis of 28 OECD countries offers preliminary evidence of systematic differences in NGO regulation between corporatist and pluralist systems. We suggest corporatist systems have more restrictive regulations because NGOs risk upsetting the political order and managed social consensus. In pluralist countries, NGOs face fewer restrictions because governments view them as substitutes for formal communication channels. We present two cases, Japan (corporatist) and the United States (pluralist), to illustrate this argument. In sum, macroinstitutional arrangements of political representation have a crucial bearing on national styles of NGO regulation. Future uses of this index include examining the effects of national context on international NGOs (INGOs), explaining variations in organizational structures and strategies among NGOs, and tracking variations in NGO–state relations over time.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://faculty.washington.edu/aseem/nvsq.pdf"],"title":"Political Opportunity Structures and National NGO Regulations","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

However, in most existing approaches, the extracted shared features are prone to be contaminated by task-specific features or the noise brought by other tasks. In this paper, we propose an adversarial multi-task learning framework, alleviating the shared and private latent feature spaces from interfering with each other. We conduct extensive experiments on 16 different text classification tasks, which demonstrates the benefits of our approach. Besides, we show that the shared knowledge learned by our proposed model can be regarded as off-the-shelf knowledge and easily transferred to new tasks.
