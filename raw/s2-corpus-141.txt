The percent of correct responses to go stimuli was high and similar in both groups; the percent of false alarm errors to no-go was significantly higher in children. Effective inhibition of responses to no-go stimuli was elucidated by a negative component of ERPs, the frontal-central N2, with peak latency 230-430 ms after stimulus onset. In adults, N2 was larger to no-go than to go stimuli, regardless of stimulus frequency. This effect was more prominent in tasks with high (25% no-gos and 75% gos), than with low (75% no-gos and 25% gos) inhibitory demand. In children, the parietal N2 was generally larger to rare than to frequent stimuli, and it was more specifically related to inhibition. The analysis of the relationship of no-go N2 to the inhibitory content of stimuli, probability of stimuli, and the contextual task difficulty suggests that child/adult differences in behavioral responses and ERPs may be related to both the immaturity of the fronto-parietal cortical-cortical network and to different task strategies.","inCitations":["0e87b257906f70b2984807be67bd0a23ebc6c858","0c2fe07840b58c8ec380729a6f2eca969f327dac","ab8b2a8079b5f15fae4efcf1df2b33a7802192ea","f8ca8d4d8e608180874091a6ca2ea74e4ff2a427","1f4af151cc721c861947e1c5f75462348d3b8c20","adb8af07ee999e0422843006a59c62a316d6e7aa","a15ffb177039929824cc61c0b0ed791f54c346be","1a78e8349fb90b3675a95f97ea582d9b00813172","83081e8f5ca42430221fb6f56119588b5a954503","2b85b3e1a5a5b3d288a83e7559ae7c7fdd33cb37","d3643cd74d9af65714592349aaad62df75fc1e0c","714fb198d1c66b93c311e48268126049dca27576","a0546554f075dd912a8e78df3c109ec4eb647243","8a17ca55b31807da4b360e6ac75b62f1ad6cd054","34fe2b5ef485f99a53deca62e9e2fe5fcea2e460","28321fdd56821c73cb5fe9423ba042b138003f7a","6de180aacd6b0a63d8090ca1b7d71158c41c1e87","abdace6e45078a8c96da037c79c7cdccd8e915ee","47c5978f9394098eb8de8764f8c9720b94c03fc4","9bba28ee6b2f479d398e86df5b9a682f30377215","b6a01988fa0a43dc0201bf81c98343108af687a0","74719ef17b9ebbae103c28f2e6ff9aaf6f34083f","13cebd30c6e9ee76aebe252085296cd62f4f0905","d942c5742fb495d51cd2a5f79f59dca02ec4d9e8","072b2d6d2fc1c4b30735cfc47f7e894ee489fc1f","38f685fd907da71fc6321d45cb37612feb4a9195","dbc2bd22011177a96e2c245a6476cb79bdb51687","5bcedf2f4b5b05e79605695e2dc365313fc07f97","718d19863f34a7c1963faa69a25d6cccee2f4222","f53a081f008f92c4740e1ca3ff773b24acbc5220"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Posterior brain ERP patterns related to the go/no-go task in children.","doi":"10.1111/j.1469-8986.2004.00250.x","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-8986.2004.00250.x","venue":"Psychophysiology"}

However, only a small subset of EMs contribute to the physiological state of a given cell.ResultsIn this paper, a method is proposed that identifies the subset of EMs that best explain the physiological state captured in reaction flux data, referred to as principal EMs (PEMs), given a pre-specified universe of EM candidates. The method avoids the evaluation of all possible combinations of EMs by using a branch and bound approach which is computationally very efficient. The performance of the method is assessed using simulated and experimental data of Pichia pastoris and experimental fluxome data of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The proposed method is benchmarked against principal component analysis (PCA), commonly used to study the structure of metabolic flux data sets.ConclusionsThe overall results show that the proposed method is computationally very effective in identifying the subset of PEMs within a large set of EM candidates (cases with ~100 and ~1000 EMs were studied). In contrast to the principal components in PCA, the identified PEMs have a biological meaning enabling identification of the key active pathways in a cell as well as the conditions under which the pathways are activated. This method clearly outperforms PCA in the interpretability of flux data providing additional insights into the underlying regulatory mechanisms.","inCitations":["cbe913b435b9978aec2dc4a5a955d0fb0ef4e8cd","0a57df881f7fe3fc0c6f467da93df899f7e9d391","27dd0c22dea609159fcc888585c260bb1c57cc6c","a75406df1d8cff544b8aa790044bf94f23b594e1","ff1fc75623a8d761a1360f40eddb87a52f39bc91","4f85266d51ea58b7ed2afafcfa7f93c817cc5d97"],"pdfUrls":["https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s12859-016-1063-0?site=bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com","https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q31090599","http://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/pmc/82/32/12859_2016_Article_1063.PMC4855838.pdf","http://eprint.ncl.ac.uk/file_store/production/224353/C4659D19-E798-40DF-ADB4-AEC36BF56B97.pdf"],"title":"A principal components method constrained by elementary flux modes: analysis of flux data sets","doi":"10.1186/s12859-016-1063-0","sources":["Medline","DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12859-016-1063-0","venue":"BMC Bioinformatics"}

The onset temperature of cocatalyst decomposition must be measured under reaction conditions. In polar solvent, when the more active imidate form of the (thio)urea is favored, most cocatalyst systems become thermally stable up to 110 °C, exhibiting linear Eyring behavior, including some that were unstable in toluene. The very progress of an ROP is shown to influence the nature of the catalysts as the solution polarity changes from highly polar (at 0% conversion) to less polar at full conversion.

In-process control of welding distortion is more desirable than postwelding rectification from the point of manufacturing efficiency. This can be achieved by suitably designing and also implementing one or more of the distortion control measures as is suitable for a particular manufacturing situation. In this study, an investigation on buckling phenomenon in fabrication of stiffened panels was carried out. Analytical formulae were used to calculate the weld-induced compressive stresses. Critical buckling stresses considering appropriate buckling coefficient for typical stiffened panels as used in shipbuilding practice were calculated. The predictions from these analytical tools were compared with experimental observations. The experimental results compared fairly well with those of the calculated ones. In the present study the panel design aspect as well as thermomechanical tensioning scheme were studied with regard to buckling mitigation. It was observed that when choosing suitable stiffener spacing in conjunction with plate thickness, buckling distortion can be significantly reduced. Distortion mitigation through thermomechanical tensioning was also found to an effective yet simple-to-implement method of buckling distortion control. However, further investigation is necessary toward fully establishing the method of thermomechanical tensioning. Once this method is established, this pretensioning technique can be applied as an active in-process control method to avoid buckling distortion in stiffened panels.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Buckling of Stiffened Panels and Its Mitigation","doi":"10.5957/JSPD.30.4.130058","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.5957/JSPD.30.4.130058","venue":""}

It rapidly oxidized intracellular glutathione within 10 sec, with the formation of oxidized glutathione. The cytotoxicity of 3,5-dimethyl-NAPQI could be prevented over a 3.5-hr period with the carboxylesterase inhibitor bis(p-nitrophenyl) phosphate, indicating that cytotoxicity involved N-deacetylation. The N-deacetylated product could be trapped with glutathione as 3-(glutathion-S-yl)-4-amino-2,6-dimethylphenol in 3,5-dimethyl-NAPQI-treated hepatocytes but not in hepatocytes pretreated with bis(p-nitrophenyl) phosphate, indicating that N-deacetylation activity had been inhibited. 3,5-Dimethyl-NAPQI was readily N-deacetylated by rat liver microsomes, in contrast to 3,5-dimethylacetaminophen. The latter was also not cytotoxic to hepatocytes at up to 2 mM. The N-deacetylated product 4-amino-2,6-dimethylphenol rapidly underwent autoxidation to form 2,6-dimethylbenzoquinone imine and was highly cytotoxic to hepatocytes at 200-300 microM. The latter reacted with glutathione to give the above conjugate and no glutathione oxidation occurred. Dithioerythritol (2 mM) added at 10, 20, and 30 min after 3,5-dimethyl-NAPQI delayed but did not prevent cytotoxicity. Dithioerythritol also resulted in the partial restoration of GSH, presumably as a result of reduction of protein mixed disulphides. The mechanism of cytotoxicity of 3,5-dimethyl-NAPQI therefore appears to be a result of a combination of oxidative stress and deacetylation resulting in arylation.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"The metabolism of N-acetyl-3,5-dimethyl-p-benzoquinone imine in isolated hepatocytes involves N-deacetylation.","doi":"","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"Molecular pharmacology"}

Modification to components with little regard to dependencies may increase have an adverse impact on the quality of the latter, i.e., increase their risk to fail. We conduct an empirical study to understand the relationship between the quality of components and the characteristics of their dependencies such as their frequency of change, their complexity, number of past failures and like. Our study has been conducted on two large software systems: Microsoft VISTA and ECLIPSE. Our results show that components that have outgoing dependencies to components with higher objectoriented complexity tend to have fewer field failures for VISTA, but the opposite relation holds for ECLIPSE. Likewise, other notable observations have been made through our study that (a) confirm that certain characteristics of components increase the risk of their dependencies to fail and (b) some of the characteristics are projectspecific while some were also found to be common. We expect that such results can leveraged to provide new directions for research in defect prediction, test prioritization and related research fields that utilize code dependencies in their empirical analysis. Additionally, these results provide insights to engineers on the potential reliability impacts of new component dependencies based upon the characteristics of the component.","inCitations":["8d4ba14a3b600b1c44b0ee156c845c7c3dec6121","e0221d6f9d1a97d004f41e0914b0e243a50f0416"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"An Empirical Study of the Factors Relating Field Failures and Dependencies","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

This prompted hospitals to adopt quality improvement (QI) interventions that increase use of evidence-based practices (EBPs) for HAPU prevention. Objective:To evaluate the longitudinal impact of CMS policy and QI adoption on HAPU rates. Materials and Methods:We characterized longitudinal adoption of 25 QI interventions that support EBPs through hospital leadership, staff, information technology, and performance and improvement. Quarterly counts of HAPU incidence and inpatient characteristics were collected from 55 University HealthSystem Consortium hospitals between 2007 and 2012. Mixed-effects regression models tested the longitudinal association of CMS policy, HAPU coding, and QI on HAPU rates. The models assumed level-2 random intercepts and random effects for CMS policy and EBP implementation to account for between-hospital variability in HAPU incidence. Results:Controlling for all 25 QI interventions, specific updates to EBPs for HAPU prevention had a significant, though modest reduction on HAPU rates (−1.86 cases/quarter; P=0.002) and the effect of CMS nonpayment policy on HAPU prevention was much greater (−11.32 cases/quarter; P<0.001). Conclusions:HAPU rates were significantly lower after changes in CMS reimbursement. Reductions are associated with hospital-wide implementation of EBPs for HAPU prevention. Given that administrative data were used, it remains unknown whether these improvements were due to changes in coding or improved quality of care.","inCitations":["c5aab83259e708e9497fa33924bcd60866aa1418","86085f8dea96c5a9de71cafdd830ed5caff7313d","bded0ec04bb994a3878fba6ffc59c06750239f09","b856f292a23bcf55dcf0a6f6518ef2221ebdf260","4db434f899e6e4821793a1a59d94a2ceef5e6df4","2978c8c35e0cb9f9e0c4f3ed6cd273f0688c648e","3002e98366b4b4e302e2df54a8de6010ee082499","83691db1dbee4e745f7ce7961e585bea22335a0e","950baf51bca92f70dc0cda06ac45660162c613d5","2b251761fc5bbf0b959d95b2eb5edd34ff73de43"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Are Evidence-based Practices Associated With Effective Prevention of Hospital-acquired Pressure Ulcers in US Academic Medical Centers?","doi":"10.1097/MLR.0000000000000516","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1097/MLR.0000000000000516","venue":"Medical care"}

PDK1 is also an important regulator of T cell development, mediating pre-TCR induced proliferation signals. However, the role of PDK1 in B cell antigen receptor (BCR) signaling and B cell development remains largely unknown. In this study we provide genetic evidence supporting the role of PDK1 in B cell survival. We found PDK1 is required for BCR mediated survival in resting B cells, likely through regulation of Foxo activation. PDK1-dependent signaling to NF-κB is not crucial to resting B cell viability. However, PDK1 is necessary for triggering NF-κB during B cell activation and is required for activated B cell survival. Together these studies demonstrate that PDK1 is essential for BCR-induced signal transduction to Foxo and NF-κB and is indispensable for both resting and activated B cell survival.","inCitations":["e67ef487299fc966384c0e520a253af1aea7c1a4","f67c5dd2eb1b3c29afb3a480757da5af73aced22","50f4f6767a18b37087ea444c4e3c8fb597fc159b","2fb1bb86351d912acc52c9a891b93643556ee2dd","dff945a1051daf14277c869fe7166983ee934ea4","a871c6a25a680ac81c8d00c705c823e5be0a261f","42decc788dbbfbf989beadcf703c3184bd71775e","8cb7f9344974066efdd6774b21b379e05efddc6b","86287f7399ad56b8de7d3e554f8cdbf509eddb88","dbb846b79adc7cfff12884b48465dddf31646a23"],"pdfUrls":["http://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/pmc/80/c4/pone.0055378.PMC3564844.pdf","https://academiccommons.columbia.edu/download/fedora_content/download/ac:1jwstqjq2t/content/journal.pone.0055378.PDF"],"title":"The Kinase PDK1 Is Essential for B-Cell Receptor Mediated Survival Signaling","doi":"10.1371/journal.pone.0055378","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0055378","venue":"PloS one"}

We evaluated the frequency of genital HSV shedding in HIV-seropositive and HIV-seronegative men and women in Uganda.\n\n\nMETHODS\nNinety-three HSV-2-seropositive Ugandan adults collected anogenital swab specimens for HSV DNA quantification by polymerase chain reaction 3 times daily for 6 weeks.\n\n\nRESULTS\nHSV-2 was detected from 2484 of 11 283 swab specimens collected (22%), with a median quantity of 4.3 log10 HSV copies/mL (range, 2.2-8.9 log10 HSV copies/mL). Genital lesions were reported on 749 of 3875 days (19%), and subclinical HSV shedding was detected from 1480 of 9113 swab specimens (16%) collected on days without lesions. Men had higher rates of total HSV shedding (relative risk [RR], 2.0 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 1.3-2.9]; P < .001); subclinical shedding (RR, 1.7 [95% CI, 1.1-2.7]; P = .01), and genital lesions (RR, 2.1 [95% CI, 1.2-3.4]; P = .005), compared with women. No differences in shedding rates or lesion frequency were observed based on HIV serostatus.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nHSV-2 shedding frequency and quantity are high among HSV-2-seropositive adults in sub-Saharan Africa, including persons with and those without HIV infection. Shedding rates were particularly high among men, which may contribute to the high prevalence of HSV-2 and early acquisition among African women.","inCitations":["870c22bca9cc22727bd54c88cd2be64184614e57","1bfa71ee41ba83f44fb1367655c1ca2c0bc356fb","6ba609c5af14ef03871da7be00a5befaf96d4bd6","721cf732f70322c96e5a8587c4662ca467e83b74","9ae654b2c1affa67c72cd50f9bd8d372b4fcc09d","21a689ea460cae4410ce212f6ba719a2bf9097dc"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Genital Herpes Simplex Virus Type 2 Shedding Among Adults With and Without HIV Infection in Uganda.","doi":"10.1093/infdis/jiv451","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1093/infdis%2Fjiv451","venue":"The Journal of infectious diseases"}

The mitogenic effects of IGF-I, IGF-II, and insulin were compared. IGF-I was found to be 3-fold more potent than IGF-II and 30-fold more potent than insulin, suggesting that the effects of these growth factors are mediated by the IGF-I receptor. Ishikawa endometrial cancer cells secrete IGF-II, but not IGF-I, and insulin (1 microM) stimulates IGF-II release. The LH-RH antagonist [Ac-D-Nal(2)1, D-Phe(4Cl)2, D-Pal(3)3, D-Cit6, D-Ala10]-GnRH (SB-75, CETRORELIX) inhibited basal and IGF-induced growth. Moreover, this antagonist almost completely inhibited IGF-II release from Ishikawa cells, while having no significant effect on the number or affinity of IGF-I binding sites. Inhibition of IGF-II release occurred at a lower SB-75 concentration than that needed for a reduction in cell number. The ED50 of SB-75 for IGF-II release was 0.3 microM as compared to 1.5 microns concentration which is required for reduction in cell number, suggesting that inhibition of growth factor release precedes cell growth inhibition. We conclude that the LH-RH antagonist SB-75 can inhibit the growth of endometrial cancer cells by interfering with the autocrine action of IGF-II and also by directly inhibiting the growth-stimulatory effects of IGFs, probably through effects on a post-receptor mechanism.","inCitations":["cbb57b47b1131993b1e938b4d05fa25d885e65d1","888ebd8fcd6667a711dafafbb974b5da9d62f1a3","8fda494dfccc502dc94dbb63cdb12cf187c15dde","2ef2008ea9c8031e522c4f512d95b3f1b11d952d","b5faaef7ace58ebc48ea1360b55a52ea9adbfb1e","62ea3412b39029d9554bb9f2ca67bd16951607f6","02cf2e144ad305bd4ab9670811fceb5dccd808a0","6016ae9787aabf181cdcdb048bc5464e9d9262ac","f27576dd8055386e5c518b115f6523810d702404","786dfbbaaa955f094bcabf85286c685b988ec54b","fb461044153045be44a91afca4b4b9562c3afcb9","597c0a57638bbaaa4b7f4d97e64d1ae1bfdf3519"],"pdfUrls":["https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/0167011593903389","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0167011593903389?dgcid=api_sd_search-api-endpoint"],"title":"Regulation of endometrial cancer cell growth by insulin-like growth factors and the luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone antagonist SB-75","doi":"10.1016/0167-0115(93)90338-9","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/0167-0115%2893%2990338-9","venue":"Regulatory Peptides"}

When the proximal part of the afferent vein was identified on a fluoroscopy, non-contrast CBCT images were obtained. In patients with incomplete embolization of GV, an additional injection of gelatin sponges was performed. Follow-up data from contrast-enhanced CT and upper intestinal endoscopy, as well as clinical and laboratory data were collected.\n\n\nResults\nPlug-assisted retrograde transvenous obliteration procedures were technically successful in all 17 patients. Complete embolization of GV was detected on CBCT images in 15 patients; whereas, incomplete embolization was detected in two. Complete embolization of GV was then achieved after an additional injection of gelatin sponges in these two patients as demonstrated on the 2nd CBCT image. The mean follow-up period after PARTO was 193 days (range, 73-383 days). A follow-up CT obtained 2-4 months after PARTO demonstrated marked shrinkage or complete obliteration of GV and portosystemic shunts in all 17 patients. There were no cases of variceal bleeding during the follow-up.\n\n\nConclusion\nPlug-assisted retrograde transvenous obliteration is technically and clinically effective for the treatment of GV. In addition, intra-procedural CBCT can be an adjunct tool to fluoroscopy, because it can provide an immediate and accurate evaluation of the technical success of PARTO.","inCitations":["f2cf203f656660fd577ce9edafd6ccf0d68cbd6c"],"pdfUrls":["https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/pmc/oa_pdf/96/fb/kjr-19-223.PMC5840050.pdf"],"title":"Plug-Assisted Retrograde Transvenous Obliteration for the Treatment of Gastric Varices: The Role of Intra-Procedural Cone-Beam Computed Tomography","doi":"10.3348/kjr.2018.19.2.223","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.3348/kjr.2018.19.2.223","venue":"Korean journal of radiology"}

The results suggested that the addition of the laminate skins and foaming by the core-back (or mold opening) technique can greatly reduce weight of material needed to have the same bending stiffness and maximum bending force.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://leaders.4spe.org/spe/conferences/ANTEC2017/papers/371.pdf"],"title":"Injection Molding of Glass Fiber Reinforced Polypropylene Composite Foams with Laminate Skins","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

All specimens come from glauconitic sandstone of Cenomanian age. Dames (1874) identified his Lingula sp. as L. krausei which differs in shell outline from Lingula truncata. This species, dedicated to A. Krause, together with L. subovalis, is considered characteristic of the Cenomanian. Several new species and genera have recently been described or redescribed and compared to our specimens, here identified as Lingularia similis. By priority (ICZN, 1999), the type species L. similis is currently synonymized with Lingula krausei. A new genus Eolingularia, within the Family Lingulidae, is here described, with Lingularia siberica Biernat et Emig, 1993, as type species. This new genus ranges from the Carboniferous to the Triassic in Russia, China, and Spain.

Surfaces selected for evaluation were wood laminate, glass and computer monitor screens, metal file cabinets, plastic arena seats, nylon seat cushions, finished concrete flooring, and vinyl tile flooring. Laboratory and test chamber studies were performed to evaluate two sampling methods, a sponge and a macrofoam swab, for detection of E. herbicola on surface materials. In laboratory trials, seven materials were inoculated with a known concentration of E. herbicola cells and samples were collected from the surfaces of the materials to determine sampling efficiencies. Culture analysis was ineffective for assessing E. herbicola collection efficiency because very few culturable cells were obtained from surface samples. QPCR demonstrated that E. herbicola DNA was present in high concentrations on all of the surface samples, and sampling efficiencies ranged from 0.7 to 52.2%, depending on the sampling method and the surface material. The swab was generally more efficient than the sponge for collection of E. herbicola from surfaces. Test chamber trials were also performed in which E. herbicola was aerosolized into the chamber and allowed to settle onto test materials. Surface sampling results supported those obtained in laboratory trials. The results of this study demonstrate the capabilities of QPCR to enhance the detection and enumeration of biocontaminants on surface materials and provide information on the comparability of sampling methods.","inCitations":["aca52af3ffe5dd470d3e876202a15e48c14a6dbc","96c65883543f01924c6a1e2cbe68edb61e2f97be","c101350b491a722784adb23e724afe50541eacd3","e2442835214f54127308a888a9281d5696907cc6","983ccf432a5b2c1d3928b8177959bebd7dce6fe9","5aae241fce0aebbaac6b2877fb9fc5858b453857","b806fc3bab6a365b57e5755bac6875805ebdd201","c0c9db1f41c6884c5ddb3965ec1d98ec0820cfa6","145458903a2098874ccbfb212b018d3b139f24db","4b986f5028411adcf013f3a40977389badc0212e","ab6dd8e3b8f5a69b624820dd87cac27116ec81b8","71db193a33ca523a9308f3519b3f892db75a18c3","6d012fe15cfa6d29891650fd6ea086aac52b1d78","f02e8f6f6692ca2940c9c86d6151b9a3b59bde24","e07178827713aa1ab3c33856bd4f50e1f571d930","bfca987191f0e8a0ad2d0ba76249922beac416f3","3cdf5f340308e406285e10fa70e3fddfd127edc3","5cdbe67b4794b7878fc011da1cf3e1b4664a5bfa","68b5a4517f8638c76fdb1c980e7856a081ade2d5","7054e69d81fac4bd6b7fde408f0016e756f4f529","2e966f09695b6161e6a39069502142516c83b04e","9cb111a4e267e6cc056837e390f1e85bdc7100c8","26872e4ab47ebfee558e0460ff861d21d1580030"],"pdfUrls":["https://digitalscholarship.unlv.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1130&context=env_occ_health_fac_articles&httpsredir=1&referer=","http://digitalscholarship.unlv.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1130&context=env_occ_health_fac_articles","http://aem.asm.org/content/73/11/3505.full.pdf"],"title":"Evaluation of two surface sampling methods for detection of Erwinia herbicola on a variety of materials by culture and quantitative PCR.","doi":"10.1128/AEM.01825-06","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1128/AEM.01825-06","venue":"Applied and environmental microbiology"}

Recent research has utilized intensity as a primary means to define training methods for improving aerobic capacity (VO2 max). Alternative ways of classifying training techniques must be examined to elucidate optimal practices for aerobic capacity enhancement. PURPOSE: To investigate the potential impact of various aerobic training methods on V02, body composition and anaerobic power. METHODS: Thirtyfour healthy male & female subjects (18-30yrs) participated in an equated volume supervised running workout for six weeks utilizing two alternate training methods. Group one (N = 17, 21 ± 3 yr) participated in Interval Training Distance (ITD) and group two (N = 17, 21 ± 3 yr) participated in Long Slow Distance (LSD). All subjects participated in a familiarity session (FAM), a Pre-Test (T1) and a Post-Test (T2) . Each testing session consisted of a V02 Max, a 30 second Wingate and body composition assessment. Data were analyzed by a two-way ANOVA with repeated measures. Significance was set at p < 0.05 and adopted throughout. RESULTS: The ITD and LSD groups experienced significant increases (p < 0 .001) in VO2 max, with 9.05% (4.19 ± 4.15 ml/kg/min) and 3.18% (1.39 ± 3.67 ml/kg/min) increases respectively. A significant interaction (p < 0.05) in VO2 max occurred between groups, as the ITD group displayed a 302% greater increase when compared to the LSD group. Body fat percentage significantly decreased (p < 0.01) in the ITD (1.08 ± 1.90%) and LSD (1.55 ± 3.21%) groups, while a significant reduction (p < 0.05) in total body weight was also observed. CONCLUSION: The findings of this study suggest that the ITD training method has a greater impact on aerobic capacity than LSD training method. However, both ITD and LSD training methods had a significant impact on aerobic capacity, body weight, and body composition.

Regardless of the ramp metering algorithm employed, the metering signals may be operated in various ways based on the ramp metering policy adopted. Ramp metering policies include traffic signal cycle, 2- or n-cars per green, and discrete release rates. In the latter policy, a number of discrete release rates are prespecified, each implemented with a specific cycle and green phase. This approach allows for short green phases (small platoon releases) whenever possible but also for high ramp flows when necessary. We address the problem of determining the lowest required number of release rates that will not affect ramp metering operation compared with the theoretical case of any (even decimal) release rate. Results from investigations using the ALINEA (Asservissement Lineaire d'Entree Autoroutiere) ramp metering algorithm and the METANET (Modele d'Ecoulement du Trafic Autoroutier: NETwork) macroscopic traffic simulator are reported and discussed in detail. Finally, recommendations are provided concerning the lowest required number of release rates and the discretisation scheme to be used.

Therefore, standardization of that payment must take account of other factors that determine the distribution of profit.

The investigation of DNA radiosensitivity in vitro is complicated by the heterogneous population of male germ cells (MGC) present in isolated single-cell suspensions. In the present investigation, the neutral elution technique was used to assess γ-irradiation-induced DNA double-strand damage (DSD) in spermatogonia and preleptotene spermatocytes (SG/PL), pachytene spermatocytes and spermatid spermatocytes, as well as in MGC. In addition, the capability of these cell types to repair DNA double-strand damage was investigated. \n \nBased on the well established timing of the rat spermatogenic cycle, the DNA of specific cell populations was labeled using tritiated thymidine. DNA from labeled cells was determined isotopically, whereas total DNA was quantitated using a fluorometric metod. DSD was induced in a dose-dependent manner in the heterogeneous population as well as in the labeled cell populations. SG/PL were more sensitive to γ-irradiation-induced DSD than either the heterogeneous MGC population, pachytene or spermatid spermatocytes. Each cell type exhibited a similar capability to repair DSD following exposure to 3000 rad; repair was rapdi (maximal within 45 min) and incomplete (< 40%). Only pachytene spermatocytes exhibited significant repair following exposure to 6000 rad. Since a difference in sensitivity to radiation-induced DSD was demonstrated, the capability of each cell type to repair a similar initial frequency of strand damage was investigated. SG/PL, pachytene and spermatid spermatocytes differed in their capability to repair similar levels of strand damage. However, the difference in dose required to achieve equal damage may have contributed to other cellular effects, thus altering repair. \n \nIn summary, a model is described that permits the evaluation of genotoxic responses in specific populations of spermatogenic cells within a heterogeneous cell suspension. The ability of specific cell types to repair γ-irradiation-induced DNA double-strand damage is demonstrated.","inCitations":["1bdf7b72d08b7747d489559d2ae22c9ef93909cd","1f355fe08c21efa0a11944076af84d14738b0eba","e4658f554c38556a7146d86384f66d8211644171","fcb218a93212481cc8c11963600f2afb62936574","f150fde2f23f5af696d4de9b4a511fa70dd0897e"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"DNA double-strand damage and repair following γ-irradiation in isolated spermatogenic cells","doi":"10.1016/0167-8817(88)90020-X","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/0167-8817%2888%2990020-X","venue":""}

However, with growing interest in n-type wafers, which feature p+ emitters, and the inability of SiNx to provide effective field-effect passivation for p-type materials, other passivation materials are being actively investigated by the photovoltaics (PV) R&D community. Aluminum oxide (AlOx) is one of such materials due to its ability to provide both low interface defect densities and sufficient negative fixed charge. Although AlOx is transparent and stable, the refractive index isn't ideally matched for a Si/air or Si/encapsulant interface. To circumvent the poor index matching, it has been shown that a multi-layer passivation/ARC stack is possible, allowing for both good passivation and ideal refractive index and sparking a renewed interest in TiO2. The high quality passivation is obtained by using a thin passivation layer (<; 20 nm) like AlOx, followed by a low cost optical material such as TiO2 with a proper refractive index for an ARC. This paper addresses the optical and microstructural properties of TiO2 films deposited at various temperatures using an in-line atmospheric chemical vapor deposition system (APCVD). The TiO2 films are investigated by spectroscopic ellipsometry, reflectance spectroscopy and cross-sectional TEM. Additionally, experimental results for the ARC performance of multi-layer ARC structures featuring AlOx/TiO2 are presented.","inCitations":["52b39f0be51115816f30d0b5d7f5deb3e772ad25"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Optical and microstructural properties of TiO2 anti-reflection coatings deposited via in-line APCVD","doi":"10.1109/PVSC.2013.6744361","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PVSC.2013.6744361","venue":"2013 IEEE 39th Photovoltaic Specialists Conference (PVSC)"}

This shift in thinking is also evident in India in recognition of the manifold contributions being made by the Indian diaspora to the home country. This paper examines the historical and socio-economic characteristics of one important Indian diaspora community, the Punjabis in the UK and discusses the latter’s contributions to India and to its home state of Punjab. The evidence reveals that the NRI Punjabi diaspora in the UK is quite old, dating back to the colonial period. It is a heterogeneous community, divided by castes and sub-castes which influence the institutions through which its subgroups engage with the homeland. The secondary and primary evidence collected for this study indicate a wide variety of contributions - economic, social, philanthropic, cultural and political. Some of the main sectors of contribution are health, education and rural infrastructure. However, the evidence also reveals that there is much greater potential for diaspora engagement and that large scale investments by the diaspora are deterred by corruption, an inefficient bureaucracy, lack of streamlined procedures and lack of supportive diaspora policies at the state and central levels. The study thus concludes that greater thrust is needed, especially at the state level to facilitate the Punjabi diaspora’s engagement with India and with its home regions and state.","inCitations":["122f20e4c90c5f177d578f3f2ca923b96c8dc3f5","aee068bad812b0a9f9673ecbbfa073cc1a11f1a2","dbdb6552eb0ff3c8a6e4f4d77ce4ed657959c6c9","364b63de487ee987f6a73da65913ce354b75efec","efc7d2353e22723a3765b3fcf09c3d6344806501"],"pdfUrls":["http://indiandiasporaclub.com/file/2014/11/punjabi-diaspora.pdf","http://cadmus.eui.eu/bitstream/handle/1814/29470/CARIM-India-2013%20-%2008.pdf;jsessionid=B5B42E6B5F3DCA248CD0EE65B1899A3E?sequence=1"],"title":"The Punjabi Diaspora in the UK: An Overview of Characteristics and Contributions to India","doi":"10.2139/ssrn.2179734","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.2179734","venue":""}

The city of Bari in south-east Italy, and its hinterland, boasts a number of examples of this motif. This article explores how pseudo-Arabic was employed in Bari and how the circulation of luxury objects in the medieval Mediterranean contributed to the dissemination of the motif. Bari’s most prominent church, the Basilica of San Nicola, contains a particularly inventive example of pseudo-Arabic in its apse mosaic, which can be dated to the decades following the First Crusade. This article explores the idea that booty from the crusade may have provided the inspiration for the pseudo-Arabic pavement.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://hcommons.org/deposits/objects/hc:19810/datastreams/CONTENT/content"],"title":"Pseudo-Arabic and the Material Culture of the First Crusade in Norman Italy: The Sanctuary Mosaic at San Nicola in Bari","doi":"10.16995/olh.252","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.16995/olh.252","venue":""}

In this study, we attempted to understand such audience effects within the framework of the heuristic model of persuasion. Subjects listened to an audiotaped persuasive message that conveyed arguments of either high or low quality and that was responded to by either an enthusiastic or an unenthusiastic overheard audience. In addition, subject involvement (high vs. low) was varied. Consistent with predictions, the audience response cue influenced postmessage opinions only under low involvement; under high involvement, only argument quality affected persuasion. Analyses that took into account subjects' need for cognition supported the additional hypothesis that individuals lower in need for cognition would be more responsive to the audience manipulation under low involvement. Thought-listing data and regression analyses provided further support for the heuristic model.","inCitations":["47d4962e63cb50b6874ae441c63bb02be52fa4e9","6c5e9fcd930c941ed5c8f889fac0279a3ad5e038","f3af0daa85d64bbc8caaa5c68ccf3f038c4984bf","d31d4131d5f4f41fa39ef721daa6fbc16e1ef7d3","236735a20121b7d4841528e7acae0ed397b6bc8e","ea5c6b399ec49d1209ec0c2d20471fd4caa963de","a2592eccfe43b2617df6444c6717d066c21176cc","5f188cebfc6fadf012ef60450ffea88ab3ff94e0","a40d28ebac2c9115f6a70569e486387fa5803440","d50f1c1df01f3cbe705579e19e85443a55bb8320","84a3b116caf772aeec6f7c6b38ddb7b11593e4db","b15c6a42d0ac99ec6fcefcdcaecb6c3bf18fb158","8cd29dc3ae1ea2f8a1f84182b1d0354375d82035","ea749d2dcc41b741acb52ac7356f0273bdb25b43","dd578ab67d7b9a02cfb62919cc719e6b1ace0700","53342fa22ad6b862322ac6d8d100ab180228ac82","6caccd2cc50a712390fb95940f0ac13ce1852e34","886b495c9498a26adfd7b1038fbf823ec7ba0922","fed89d279004bafdb9cb4b815583bb468b86c1be","89d2c6bb0ed1db1f0582c636c1caf7c05d85cca6","8b1445c24de66cb95ac8844dd51fece3401fb91e","8f3df2d95663570b2e7c497525a242dcaee4ad41","f1175810c56ddf6cf798cec9cf2c2935c9549fa9","eb04347e61e6e993caab05a4987702f2fa468356","3ed5ca2a717363e28d55716b3e6f37e57035cab2","235babd005602b3df01d5243acddfe410eb1a474","1eb90e2947c278d943272cf6c58fdd0222b0f238","03cdfdc4ed67d2c15025387b91f8faeea0758786","d13228e21efe9e9e7dac888d5b41e0d705f924df","58f76623eff567ecc087edda35df5297a6ba0dd6","86077e4291c6b31fb7c90410abb183ed79620143","d8964a7cbb51e0f0b01ce1b0dc0b39857648b78a","7021b55988f6693a672179d97f1d891ed81e6f3d","73121ed2f7deef3c37cb55ccff9e6b751cd47fd4","1050b0ba72ae47e54e2cc09b2c1db5b88f8a0c8c","f351a556eeb311070074e20c14dc693237e585f0","909076fcdb945de125f017c99a2f2e34388fbea3","6676b865825e41b4c413592b404999be14349977","ed5cbfe187c7e5d0f8269cc7574ea1da7a727142","5af33aa00b66a0a259ef24408cd44af0eed08b2e","26f65bd55ee4d25ea4d9dabbe1779c81f4d240d2","866b95fca55addc1b0aa61a0f5c9ad6811933658","50653630d04c1c6630478bbeac0c83b6c3b58bec","1d5fae33fe98d3ebfd4ae2052931182e9e9402ed","4d87e35cb3abf0732ac5011db693b9da67a42c5d","ae85b778f8a572f4769c7205d97c1fe0b479dada","7fb4f6500ebffeaf3cb27b87c789d15a49d933ad","9c48d1f491828a98f5e1a75147cdbdd81f00b929","1db4796b83b3dfcc8a377d732f4ecae5cc2c7b4b","374f1a5e1e34f4dfb73d15320bae04b0490c90c3","37fe01a247a5716f25737decf63bdffedb745a44","34931bd93a78c306864e1359c555d27cce01fa56","f8322e076cf0e7da9d7b048eb577da1c7a424ada","cd49afeb027bd7fc583bb3dd1fd7ca65ff0780df","26d1d4fdaec8dfa3fb1bd348819110ae3235957c","8238c97c1470a2dbac522ff12dcc54b1c49ada09","4bdb1ae670d8a18a5bf31b85451d71cb0bd27eca","7a7ecc7cbe842bf8bd087a04f4d9fa5e086d62e8","ad7974510c3fcaeeb2bac8def280992f24bcbee5","851954244883515f13e01e432a2c7d6a6eb012ec","73dcbfd3f22692ef8796e4821098086d155f1a90","337d351cb78fd01ff475a9f763d77434218f1fd9","91c2cd8ed8ef9a719b09830ac187a1ab8f03f369","5301f35b22904efc3e5276794975302b23470320","c39e54a20ef13cf619598595dd2934df4d060b20","b01be77ae33081c89652b9a9bdf2e8c3f79dcff6","12785ff7e1605bc1c1903ab097b95c8d1dc0fd9f","3f155e36785877b23ebc16737f01a13092e705a2","faccc5b7fd9cfcdab28041deac55b5fd2ebc5510","dfd55e38f563c3391e18effda38d64c51230e0d6","f97cb1a793f4e7746c54373ee46fde76b75e7a13","410eabdf0505235b91a2e91159aff22cfd20fc33","f36def4b41bbd04c4073686f8d9ad0a13b697791","a73ce722fca3470d88ae33056f6ff84be73f2b6a","da36f11212e7ef4e9b94aae7c39728b2ee49e847","bbfbed9faaea35a4a437cbd32d0e6e4da6b811e3","f95f5946709d2b9e25b7f92f42ac869e4b1df465","4c4d40d356b420e33228e234b06ffb08d8f5b248","abf24f69fb82d0176f6c2bbb39b33911abad0e8e","1258284670d85d67ca03388d7d6ada96f06abd28","2fad42a72977f9f90fce9de4de9c0e05a772fc92","01dc88942ff64d055870bb31c81c6e35e69b1b15","bb864d593ccb10d1133ce636b3284af1aac2bcd5","77c16ab7c7e42eb6c93aa01f5ede6bc43c3d4c34","bfacbd04048b41d6e6adaec99aa6e646b6d98ac5","beaa00472e9f4b121b98509453f088f43650efbc","9df65d430bac000169b3dff7b1e2b1e587f4f6ea","339bc2193c0a4bc415a46d6d61c3536c6bf5d1a3","214d0950afac3bcf4cf58ea641879c221b6e1762","f1a5cca351c38301a9bf3ed2e0ddccf091479162","cdd7ce0d896072706e9a8a6ef1e04bb53fcedb4e","84ba20785b7304b6eb80740e98819beb0502043c","05319a085f46f54c2bb671a178c230a6d027bfee","aafbc6832dbf2190a423037c262a6b69e7bc7356","c01ebc4ec5b2ad8baea9e6807f195c2c138a6c22","92504149ee0fcf54e900601770813bd8a2ba77e6","b7657256163bf2a0e8eab4e5a6c1f1b59897e652","a2f8c8ad00d9da2e9b75654f3788593610744a23","5408d857c7ed7e15a28c7211d826b30d358b8562","1bd25ff92c7d0e516724697264acbeecf64e1ea9","0d90278d50bccddb732001bd1feae27efb2997b8","35cda119bd5d0478fb8e0dcfa67898ef43b49000","d5af84ea4935298d4016daf7d009b23e027fc0ee","c0665429bd7321a1ae22fd628c864d934f6eb3e5","4339d4cd5da4ddeacaa0c4768897a3d325e6629f","e6da02b9b396e3508666050b040597fed6f6d4ec","9bb0333304e8a44e436c11a61c8c9ce21bebd753","7ee759d9863017e9c2567dd3fbc59daf490cb794","f9b3c53356a587ac7b063e1a30a6c1c9c7045ed8","2f4de246b937d4e813191302ea2e108344fee508","ad54db5e34568fbae4102f2dba478985ec366539","31a812826de4a3b4b752b83da59c4bf1eaf0c495","23cc9e7f78ff73872f15f749c2c3722040a3b039","e6f66961251bc86e3b2b857ea70677b9e4ae3c8d","73319a6010ff43f4322b3b91eeb5d092c987c571","83f2a0f89cc913692bfe8af60368e70

This study noted a resourcefu11ness of cellulose contained in sludge, produced the adsorbents by the mixture and the burning of cellulose recovered from sludge and thermosetting resin, and evaluated the abilities of deodorization as an adsorbent. The weights of samples were drastically reduced during the temperatures from 300 to 600°C because of the characteristics of cellulose and phenol resin. The sample burned at 400°C in nitrogen atmosphere was the highest methylene blue and iodine adsorption capacities, and these values were more than the recommendation values of Japan Water Works Association. Moreover the deodorization test suggested that the sample burned at 400°C in nitmgen atmosphere was the highest to adsorb hydrogen sulfide. These results showed that the production of new adsorbent was able to be produced by cellulose recovered from primary sludge and phenol resin and suggested to utilize as a recovery resource.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Production of New Adsorbent by Cellulose Recovered from Primary Sludge","doi":"10.2521/jswtb.39.67","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.2521/jswtb.39.67","venue":""}

The most common approach for wavelet packet-based texture classification is to decompose texture images with wavelet packet transform and to extract energy values for all subbands as features for the subsequent classification. Due to the overcomplete representation provided by the wavelet packet transform, it is suitable to select a set of subbands for sparse representation of the texture for classification. For better classification results, it is desired that the energy features corresponding to the selected subbands are as independent from each other as possible. However, most of the current subband selection methods do not take the dependence between energy values from different subbands into account. In this paper, we investigate the dependence between energy values from different subbands, which may be from the same wavelet basis, or from different wavelet bases. Based on the theoretical analysis and simulation, we propose an information-theoretic measure, mutual information, for selecting subbands for sparse representation of textures for classification. Experimental results show that the proposed method yields a sparse representation of the textures and achieves lower classification error rates than the conventional methods, simultaneously.","inCitations":["7124274a3c79a90a85e2f3b182797278c1d8db6f","9a3063950bf69578af519b7682dfa17fa4340f9c","89d1bcd34dfb066de1b838a8fd0c4afbc06c18da","855a81cbedb6236668b824b0ee5882ab497ff2af","d0105e941475da178acaa1a990aeeef0ee6628fe","6514f187a39c17d63bbafa04ca7d6fa86614db24","3231e706eb99808b52630087ddaa077bfab0b5ad","a7626d3233e7f3aff87a0a31a2ba8c980834faea","bd1358c82b6679d382027e4d13f18b8414a72b2c","d9bfff7957dc16cb6c92f20c806b3192d071f9e6","4e15615bf8256d0703a3a26155fb25525adc4675","a9895a436c81906a117c844c1abe1cbc34c07d21","f07c7cb28656cfab19afaf5708326a2981a640ff","2a79f9277226c11b286679bb1fe68a1eedd98856","19dcc02e406669291fbc9406fb862d5732e71a90","74b113476035ac4cbf5466430f51495248e7e8ec","3d49778eee56f3c81d0fcfbb72f5de58bea43315","0219af37bd7902472bf8a434046cb4c33eeb31f0","6f4aa561ef7ffff1daf9a1ba38dc455dd583be64","57aa2a0cfc5bd23cba535e89240f1cc784224cf7","a095058a80da4fb6ccb2db8e92ecb36f20d863ce","f671d9e09ed965ca4c60453abd2645db36fc5f2f","c7e074a80a8838417888188ffd7d118494b5c652","ef65727b37ecbe1a903917b7e2e7d0b533c3ad1c","923a07ff850299f9aa4698174d6d7cea8f64204e","e2293401d1cfe4d02ceedbc5c47d9904f6728325","fab922fa43506382340f1770e8b79dd576788f4d","0dc735653c3d5c14cb408156ae0390479bd782a7"],"pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sigpro.2005.07.032"],"title":"Information-theoretic wavelet packet subband selection for texture classification","doi":"10.1016/j.sigpro.2005.07.032","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sigpro.2005.07.032","venue":"Signal Process."}

These assumptions may be inadequate in practice, and non-uniformity due to electrolysis should not be ignored. To overcome these limitations, ion transport is considered in a dilute solution. To describe the ion concentration and electric field change close to the specimen surface, a model is used that employs the Nernst–Planck equation and the electro-neutral condition. A finite difference method is used to solve the resulting time-dependent axisymmetric problem. The computational results show good agreement with the experimental data obtained by SVET. It is also found that the electric potential gradient reduces to one-tenth of the initial value and of the result predicted by the conventional model with uniform conductivity.","inCitations":["af586613f601f903e6d8c11e99cf2aad2f14531d","338ded8ceb84c9ac87d70f530b663bdcc3d5aab9","1fcbf74bd762c3dd21199102a93d297ca997d4b8"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Electric field analysis in a dilute solution for the vibrating electrode technique","doi":"10.1016/S0022-0728(02)01268-8","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/S0022-0728%2802%2901268-8","venue":""}

After correction for the change in liquid junction potential, the fall was 9.2 mmol/l for Na+ and 7.3 mmol/l for K+. On the basis of these findings we conclude that sodium bicarbonate and potassium bicarbonate are not fully dissociated in solution, and that NaHCO3(0) and KHCO3(0) do exist as chemical components with association constants of 0.72 and 0.55, respectively. Using these association constants, normal plasma will contain 1.2 mmol/l NaHCO3(0) and 0.03 mmol/l KHCO3(0). Thus NaHCO3(0) accounts for virtually the same amount of CO2 as the physically dissolved fraction. A review of all the currently known CO2 species in plasma suggests that there may be a residue of about 2 mmol/l of unknown CO2 species in normal plasma.","inCitations":["b48e62a3c2ee3e8b2ac1a8a206b053dfe590c631","0a65f2e41c546df814297ce1fc85709c1d3d5925","588c74cfe0fce6afb7bf0ac57ba6988b2d7d9017","c81ecd1738d4c6b6beac205fb18ad1c593d0e33c","678841818f739e90fb4ea273afc43a906e54932e","d74f0d99cb75d8b86b9aa8451a0c01e8ce5f1bc1","e836e5f0f0192786e33dbb85bc36838da5afa7fe"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Are sodium bicarbonate and potassium bicarbonate fully dissociated under physiological conditions?","doi":"10.1080/00365518509160965","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1080/00365518509160965","venue":"Scandinavian journal of clinical and laboratory investigation"}

Thirty patients with a suspected LPD were studied. By standard histologic, cytologic, immunologic (surface immunoglobulin and monoclonal antibody markers), and clinical criteria, the following diagnoses (independent of MR data) were made: chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) (n = 12), CLL in transformation (n = 2), well-differentiated lymphocytic lymphoma (WDLL) (n = 5), intermediate-differentiated lymphoma (IDL) (n = 2), hairy cell leukemia (HCL) (n = 3), prolymphocytic leukemic (PLL) (n = 1), poorly differentiated lymphocytic lymphoma (PDL) (n = 1), and no disease or reactive lymphocytosis (n = 4). There were 11 B-CLL cases and one T-CLL case. The percent of MR in all cases of B-CLL ranged from 26 to 76% (m = 62%); 10/11 cases had greater than or equal to 50% MR. The case with 26% MR was atypical in that it occurred in a 26-year-old patient. The percent of MR ranged from 0 to 42% (m = 16%) in the cases of well to intermediate differentiated lymphomas. Similar to previous reports intermediate proportions of MR were seen in HCL (12-41%); and low values were seen in PDL (4%) and PLL (4%). In summary, the MR assay may be a useful tool for differentiating CLL from other well to intermediate differentiated LPD involving the peripheral blood. Also, since the MR receptor is normally found only on functionally immature cells, this differential mouse rosetting capability suggests that CLL arises from a less mature cell than WDLL or IDL.","inCitations":["81e7eac8ee2f6fc6190700df2d94ac47790d1c68"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Differentiation of chronic lymphocytic leukemia from other \"well to intermediate differentiated\" lymphoproliferative disorders by the mouse rosette assay.","doi":"","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"Diagnostic immunology"}

The proportion of deaths attributed to predation and malnutrition or anthropogenic causes did not differ among the 5 populations. Predation was the leading cause of mortality; mountain lions were responsible for approximately 90% of the deer killed by predators. No difference existed among these populations in the proportion of telemetered deer that were killed by mountain lions, but propor- tionally more females than males were killed by these large felids. Predation by mountain lions is the primary source of mortality and a widespread phenomenon among the populations of mule deer we investigated.","inCitations":["be3e22cd20d89f0d4a8d88b3855a55ca7d163fb9","18123035e8949550b694f4bbd0429894587713c3","4a906c65c5c05cd632de87f8e6273ccd2879ed01","05dfcd444d2309cb8cf6b526f24c12f892edf954","49cdc82895cd1dc43d63e3238abee468f74158bd","446a4782bf1329af447a09773bbbd14d17fe28b2","23e5f54e3d53a9bb101fb517c0122307ce898655","2a3e516dfd457d7bd4d702643943b78858de9df9","34e6d4de3aa626b7375351d0b7607b4fff6778b3","109d7533574aeb96ed9ba31996a60b021d5d5426","3032b194729cb5cacf63dce0f0e2e4296612796d","a0c7bfb92de20ebb132d3c64168c3b53302180cc","9da5b67167e8b39dd9a61f890d8cac944cf837ba","a80ddb04603bfaeeaa2558ff2791774bf520c16f","9007c120f8d22c0bed5f5329534fa2650258ff4e","e4201e0db6f511f4985de0a187884dd459a705e7","accd77783c275bfcfdf8a34856fd1025115ab279","6cb12a973e1fb09ec74ccb9dd1bf2d6a43948be1","1163097fb7e2543a5ccb77068844d14c103d076e","05736d96517c9c3d28ffbd5af6c3536f3541dc5d","6f89a39d9bd22a2aefbc26615d8624552e46923b"],"pdfUrls":["https://scholarsarchive.byu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3157&context=gbn","https://scholarsarchive.byu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3157&context=gbn&httpsredir=1&referer="],"title":"Survivorship and Cause-specific Mortality in Five Populations of Mule Deer","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

To provide diverse services, the telco network operator must evolve the traditional voice service centric network into a generic service centric network. An appropriate, but incomplete, architecture for this purpose is the Service Delivery Platform (SDP). The SDP represents an IT-based system that simplifies access to telco capabilities using services. SDP services offer technology independent interfaces to external entities. The SDP has vendor-specific interpretations that mix standards-based and proprietary interfaces to satisfy specific requirements. In addition, SDP architectural representations are technology-specific. To be widely adopted the SDP must provide standardised interfaces. This work contributes toward SDP standardisation by defining a technology independent and extendable architecture, called the SDP Framework. To define the framework we first describe telecom-IT convergence and a strategy to manage infrastructure integration. Second, we provide background on the SDP and its current limitations. Third, we treat the SDP as a complex system and determine a viewpoint methodology to define its framework. Fourth, we apply viewpoints by extracting concepts and abstractions from various standard-based telecom and IT technologies: the Intelligent Network (IN), Telecommunication Information Networking Architecture (TINA), Parlay, enhanced Telecommunications Operations Map (eTOM), Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) and Internet Protocol Multimedia Subsystem (IMS). Fifth, by extending the concepts and abstractions we define the SDP framework. The framework is based on a generic business model and reference model. The business model shows relationships between SDP, telco and external entities using business relationships points. The reference model extends the business model by formalising relationships as reference points. Reference points expand into interfaces exposed by services. Applications orchestrate service functions via their interfaces. Service and application distribution is abstracted by middleware that operates across business model domains. Services, interfaces, applications and middleware are managed in Generic Service Oriented Architectures (GSOA). Multiple layered GSOAs structure the SDP framework. Last, we implement the SDP framework using standard-based technologies with open service interfaces.

The MG concept or renewable energy technologies integrated with energy storage systems (ESS) have gained increasing interest and popularity because it can store energy at off-peak hours and supply energy at peak hours. However, existing ESS technology faces challenges in storing energy due to various issues, such as charging/discharging, safety, reliability, size, cost, life cycle, and overall management. Thus, an advanced ESS is required with regard to capacity, protection, control interface, energy management, and characteristics to enhance the performance of ESS in MG applications. This paper comprehensively reviews the types of ESS technologies, ESS structures along with their configurations, classifications, features, energy conversion, and evaluation process. Moreover, details on the advantages and disadvantages of ESS in MG applications have been analyzed based on the process of energy formations, material selection, power transfer mechanism, capacity, efficiency, and cycle period. Existing reviews critically demonstrate the current technologies for ESS in MG applications. However, the optimum management of ESSs for efficient MG operation remains a challenge in modern power system networks. This review also highlights the key factors, issues, and challenges with possible recommendations for the further development of ESS in future MG applications. All the highlighted insights of this review significantly contribute to the increasing effort toward the development of a cost-effective and efficient ESS model with a prolonged life cycle for sustainable MG implementation.","inCitations":["0d469cb1dfbb676e05a93da291d22b708f03afe4","b146ecc3d981764ca38e47ca3d51625cabc06e58","5434e6e6e60865fdc0d2cb85230c8a9e19e583ca","1f54a9fab52f08abadd11e563e8f9e8bf0ad6946","82a9bc37c9d93f2369f94ed40a96f52f9de17dff","b46489775f3238a8f435a599c0a630f12dd20675","a5a0a9fe43a8893895d739faebc305b3acaabb3f","4c2ae15d63fe6340aae0d8e7ca49214cabc5325c","e1fc4cc70e0064df82b78e0970485c7bc6596d8f","58f980470fb6da3e6006d5e16677599567d31a08","5d4d49523cce7d69f2b218b11db62c5b98ff4a2b","ef395e1ab64fd8c430f6f3a33f14384cbdf62f0f","db70c23d9d4311e0cb534f67feb1eb9c00659533","6900b350ed69f7094fdbbe35df1e7245b9e99ec0","f2b8da2b1adb3e016aa004d411a7eac6ae722310","e8a4364fb2c30d7f47659d8e32885d1bc1a4bc55","92add0d86df0089db84663aafc2a2351350a77ef","9e71adad9012c3eab89f5ca48f265ac26fc179d8","343ce92fe219c66a4f8b7878a775a97cba3248b2","f2a8cda6e983fffcac5b0bf2bd453fb764229933","e3c46da05f66b63b65550d1dfd4b529b72e4c1e0","88ed22f9b0880eb2c58178a3962b62d828bd977a","30757e71b782e690e645080900993f9a379a9dd5","c867959fceede2afc350e81b72a2fb76e561868f","c88d0f6d93c03437d4ad677e00643011a090f961","2b80dfe035adb7938e6b9754573d187f636d0c27","c354abe752859a403c1e3894ad57a9aa5c245f18","0a9e0e4ca66ffa86047225bee8ea3bc8f10ae26d","97162357ed07058ef95f6700ce2a03fc796fbab4","8608b48af9676fd46a805d9b074048eac7a2cf80","6c802a3374c66a67be2a315cfa31e9ca64d60190","10435b9e7ea05895c84e7b4bb87ddbd0c2da2849","add99a03167bb1852d2a222c7969b0efb3ddfc5b","44765c63cefab74dcc937598533a44d66e51675f","daebbde04a26f3bb01c20347d7b2cbb55198e12d","fac08d4ddba0a98f12f2d450df0bbe82fd5bfc49","ed5e2b5e9d2003619b8e8d1c7cc192f80df3652a","0e394e12d69c039af16a0e8e96498f0f20e59a7a","b363218d2539689ae8e2d93b64fc4babe323ac46","63e4c746716717447ba2b110460e6d123227c9d1","771d9e08aa045e37349a90e5fc83939a617ae030","f92e4a5a204576c81f31e791c4ffcec5615f4ff0","e6af75fa0f23f7e383ff0d2688f8a90ba1b8a89d"],"pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2841407"],"title":"Review of Energy Storage System Technologies in Microgrid Applications: Issues and Challenges","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2841407","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2841407","venue":"IEEE Access"}

A strategic vision for assessment activities into the future was built during the NCA3 process, including recommendations on how to establish a sustained assessment process that would integrate evolving scientific understanding into decision making to manage the risks of climate change over time. This vision includes a collaborative assessment process that involves partnerships across a diverse and widely distributed set of non-governmental and governmental entities. The new approach to assessments would produce timely, scientifically sound climate information products and processes, rather than focusing on the production of single quadrennial synthesis reports. If properly implemented, a sustained assessment would be more efficient and cost-effective, avoiding the painful and time-consuming process of beginning the assessment process anew every 4 years. This ongoing assessment would also encourage scientific and social innovations and explore new insights and opportunities, building the capacity to advance the development and delivery of climate information to meet societal requirements and benefit from scientific opportunities.","inCitations":["981906f023a44b629e85fa9550a1265d1f1ccce9","9d388efadef350e3dff3111f784170c14705e8ad","4ec0777c6004d5124709934999fa3a4984560905","c483f2d7606cefff816011032ca7acd6c458c5c0","1608697e6880a3e20e8b00499a067b6be59f9d5b","7121e3403e75031d466da4a66ff64afe22d27fc2","6c35cfddc50ffa3362d6dba3a0fac83c752a0777"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Building a sustained climate assessment process","doi":"10.1007/s10584-015-1501-4","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10584-015-1501-4","venue":"Climatic Change"}

Investigation process consists of the experimental and numerical parts. In the experimental one, forward microextrusion of annealed material using the toolkit author’s copyright project were performed. The tests were conducted to compare deformation of the material extruded in containers with different roughness. As a results, obtained images of deformed material structures are presented and compared. Numerical part relates to simulations of analogous microextrusion processes conducted using DEFORM software. Tool roughness were modeled in the form of rigid triangular waves, whose geometric parameters are based on the roughness profiles obtained for the experimental tools. Depth and length of the triangular elements were determined using the motives method.  Distribution fields of the effective stress, strain and the flow velocities are presented and compared. Based on obtained data, concept of determining of the parameter which can help to define the appearance of structural size effect resulting from the influence of container roughness is also presented.
