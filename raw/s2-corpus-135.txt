For each of them, we discuss the sources of their power and influence and examine how ideas about development and aid have shaped the rise of these new players, identifying throughout promising and important areas for future research. In the final section, we consider peer-to-peer development aid and other innovative attempts to solve pervasive accountability problems in development aid.

Unfortunately, most published studies have been insufficiently detailed to estimate gas contents in lignite, subbituminous coal and high-volatile B bituminous coal. In addition, we note that the theoretical coalbed methane generation curves of Juntgen and Karweil and other commonly quoted papers overestimate methane yield because they do not consider hydrogen loss from coal in the form of water. In order to place better constraints on the economic potential of methane in low-rank coals, anhydrous, sealed-tube pyrolysis experiments were carried out on a Paleocene lignite from North Dakota. Experiments were conducted at heating rates of 10 °C/h and 10 °C/day between temperatures of 100 and 454 °C.

An analysis is given in which a functional intensity dependence of the extrinsic emission on a rate of simultaneous radiative and non-radiative electronic transitions in radiative centres is considered. Linear and superlinear 0.99, 1.03, 1.2, and 1.3 eV extrinsic emission is observed at low temperatures depending on the strength of non-radiative electronic transitions in radiative centres studied. The main features of non-linear extrinsic emission (superlinear emission increase with excitation intensity, a shift of emission quenching curves to lower temperatures as excitation intensity is increased, a change from the superlinear to a linear excitation dependence of emission intensity as temperature is raised) are satisfactorily explained by a model which includes strong non-linear, in intensity, dependence, radiationless transitions in radiative centres. The model discussed takes into account a decrease in the rate of non-radiative electronic transitions in radiative centres as the exciting light considerably changes the electron occupancy of defects associated with the centres studied; as a result the internal quantum efficiency and emission decay time for the luminescence bands are increased as excitation intensity is raised. \n \n \n \n[Russian text Ignored]","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Study of non‐linear extrinsic luminescence in GaAs.

The origin of those 1% of total thymocytes which leave the thymus and seed the peripheral lymphoid organs is obscure. Recent thymic emigrants are functionally and phenotypically mature12–14, and the purported greater maturity of medullary relative to cortical thymocytes is often cited as evidence for the medullary origin of thymic emigrants15, a suggestion not without its critics16,17. To approach this question, we have now isolated a subpopulation of thymocytes expressing high levels of a receptor that mediates the homing of blood-borne lymphocytes into peripheral lymph nodes. Surprisingly, this population of cells (1–3% of total thymocytes) is both cortical and immunocompetent, containing approximately half of all thymic cytolytic T-lymphocyte precursors. The combination of homing receptor expression and immunocompetence makes this cortical population ideally suited for emigration to peripheral lymphoid organs.","inCitations":["2206f4b922320be363845a9764b73991d06ba390","6555b34769ba7f2c643f358fa391f7c221b13af3","c57ead606d8cbf676477b1d456a68b7dff2b791e","c4dd92ada621ed9f292770eb4c33159a09eece17","6ff50453e4bbaa0557ed519d09199912504877d7","f5a51d8b01cfc5bdb84035dc7d87705386115423","6a787fd8c7a84e610f454e79363a7c4258fcdcd1","dd5934fe95a32ccb154ce09550833d57392a0ec4","31b4ac80280c24a38c945cf2deede333f6f91f67","4e34765fbdfb280ab2c42d79e401406dfe5ef6ca","30dcfb64008ab47e1d8e9925ee08cdba0fb5e158"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Homing receptor-bearing thymocytes, an immunocompetent cortical subpopulation","doi":"10.1038/313233a0","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1038/313233a0","venue":"Nature"}

This influx necessitated the introduction of academic literacy interventions which are aimed at supporting these students in meeting the academic literacy requirements of university education. As a result, the tertiary sector has seen a growing number of AL interventions, each catering for a different context. However, the available literature reports very little substantial evidence on the impact/effectiveness of such interventions regarding the purpose for which they have been designed. The Vaal Triangle Campus (VTC) of the North-West University has also found that the majority of first year students who register at this Campus in order to attain a tertiary qualification, show inadequate levels of academic literacy in English. However, the academic literacy intervention that is currently used at this campus has never been formally assessed for its effectiveness in improving students’ academic literacy levels. The purpose of the current study was therefore to investigate the impact of the academic literacy intervention on students’ academic literacy levels. This intervention, which consists of two complementary semester modules, is offered over a one-year period to new first year students. As a first step, a comprehensive literature survey was conducted on important changes that took place in the tertiary education sector after 1994. The reason for this enquiry is based on the fact that many of these changes, such as the ‘massification’ of tertiary education, had farreaching consequences for the tertiary sector in terms of more underprepared students who gained access to university education. Furthermore, available literature on the types of academic literacy interventions in South Africa, as well as specific sources on the reported impact of such interventions, were critiqued. The empirical part of the study made use of both a qualitative and quantitative research paradigm in order to investigate the impact of the AL intervention at the VTC. A highly reliable academic literacy test (the TALL – Test of Academic Literacy Levels) was used to determine whether students showed any significant improvement in their levels of academic literacy as a result of the intervention. This study reports positive findings in this regard.

The Au-NNCs with a bumpy surface generated up to ~3-, ~23-, and ~130-fold higher SERS signals with 514, 633, and 785 nm excitation laser wavelengths, respectively, compared to the Au-NNSs.","inCitations":["f4d25fc4d777c808787ad8188d45fabf663d60b2","c54c0c652fd00e141413ee22d42a290961f8659a","b7e192b9af0d71c88e71c1cd99128dc10a0d964e","b3ab6914bc4df9a5ec991ab9e90fd5f831113507"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Au Nanocucumbers with Interior Nanogap for Multiple Laser Wavelength‐Compatible Surface‐Enhanced Raman Scattering#","doi":"10.1002/bkcs.10164","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1002/bkcs.10164","venue":""}

The proposed NADRC can actively estimate and compensate the plant internal dynamics and external disturbances in real time. Therefore, it improves the tracking performance of the rotor current without any overshoot and steady-state error, and enhances the fault ride-through capability of DFIG-based wind turbine. Compared with the proportional PI control, the proposed NADRC during grid fault can significantly suppress the peak values of stator and rotor currents and DC-link voltage, and decrease the oscillation time of electromagnetic torque. Moreover, the proposed NADRC has a characteristic of one-parameter tuning by using the parameterization technique of controller, and parameter tuning of NADRC is only determined by the rise time of the system step response. A series of simulations for various cases on a 1.5-MW DFIG-based wind turbine are implemented, and the results validate the stability of the proposed NADRC and the strong robustness against the plant internal dynamics and external disturbances.","inCitations":["ba53eef459fb9074688d20530d6eff585df81513","236fcfe16655fb1ec4ca00de1897ba677e2a8aab","993c788c1385e0f0318e4cfde2352f40e1b3b847"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Dynamic performance improvement of DFIG-based WT using NADRC current regulators","doi":"10.1016/j.ijepes.2016.03.026","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijepes.2016.03.026","venue":""}

Cara mengekspresikan mereka berbeda dari satu ke yang lain dan hal itu disebabkan oleh beberapa faktor, seperti pendidikan, usia, sosial dan latar belakang situasional. Faktor-faktor ini sangat mempengaruhi dalam penggunaan bahasa Jawa. Meskipun umumnya bahasa Jawa memiliki bentuk yang kosakata sama, di daerah tertentu digunakan berbeda. Penelitian ini bertujuan untuk mengetahui jenis-jenis gaya bahasa yang digunakan oleh karakter dalam Garising Pepesthen di Panjebar Semangat Majalah dan gaya bahasa yang dominan digunakan dalam Garising Pepesthen di Panjebar Majalah Panjebar Semangat. \nPenulis menggunakan penelitian deskriptif kualitatif. Dalam pengumpulan data, penulis mengambil data dari Panjebar Semangat Majalah dari Juni sampai September 2012. Setelah menganalisis data, dalam analisis penulis temukan adalah empat gaya bahasa yang intim untuk mempertimbangkan peserta lain sebagai teman. Jadi, kadang-kadang pembicara menggunakan kosakata khusus untuk menangani atau menelepon teman-temannya dan menggunakan persuasi. Ini terjadi ketika mereka berbicara dengan anggota keluarga dengan status yang lebih tinggi dalam keluarga seperti orang tua, atau ketika mereka berbicara seseorang yang mereka kenal dengan baik yang lebih tua dari mereka. Dalam gaya kasual para peserta menggunakan situasi informal dan mereka ingin membuat suasana informal dan juga karena mereka berbicara dengan orang lain berdiri sama. Hal ini umumnya digunakan untuk mengatasi situasi informal dan pertemuan santai.

Over the past 5 years, 10 patients with bihemispheric seizure foci have had seizure surgeries on both hemispheres and have had postoperative follow-up for a minimum of 6 months. Preoperative investigations included magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, positron emission tomography (PET) scanning, and video-EEG monitoring with surface and subdural electrodes. Multiple subpial cortical transection (MST) was the primary procedure in all 10 patients. Following MST, 8 patients had minimal cortical resection (topectomy) in areas that continued to show epileptiform discharges in prolonged trains on intraoperative corticography. In addition, stereotactic amygdalohippocampotomy was performed on 2 patients. The longest follow-up is 62 months, with a median of 16 months. Five patients are free of seizures; 3 have rare seizures; 1 has >90% reduction in seizure frequency; and 1 has complete cessation of myoclonic seizures with >50% reduction in frequency of complex partial seizures. There were no complications from any of the procedures. The results indicate that seizures originating from both hemispheres can be effectively and safely controlled by a combination of surgical procedures.","inCitations":["e7f223d429470702cc777a05bdd0ac75c87914be"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Surgical management of independent bihemispheric seizure foci","doi":"10.1016/S0896-6974(97)84200-4","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/S0896-6974%2897%2984200-4","venue":""}

However, large-scale 2D semiconductor films synthesized so far are typically polycrystalline with defective grain boundaries that could degrade their performance. Here, for the first time, wafer-size growth of a single-crystal Bi2O2Se film, which is a novel air-stable 2D semiconductor with high mobility, was achieved on insulating perovskite oxide substrates [SrTiO3, LaAlO3, (La, Sr)(Al, Ta)O3]. The layered Bi2O2Se epilayer exhibits perfect lattice matching and strong interaction with perovskite oxide substrates, which enable unidirectional alignment and seamless mergence of multiple seeds into single-crystal continuous films free of detrimental grain boundaries. The single-crystal Bi2O2Se thin films show excellent spatial homogeneity over the entire wafer and allow for the batch fabrication of high-performance field-effect devices with high mobilities of ∼150 cm2 V-1 s-1 at room temperature, excellent switching behavior with large on/off ratio of >105, and high drive current of ∼45 μA μm-1 at a channel length of ∼5 μm. Our work makes a step toward the practical applications of high-mobility semiconducting 2D layered materials and provides an alternative platform of oxide heterostructure to investigate novel physical phenomena.","inCitations":["9940498f3216b1d26638b87de6c2b16c93978970"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Wafer-Scale Growth of Single-Crystal 2D Semiconductor on Perovskite Oxides for High-Performance Transistors.","doi":"10.1021/acs.nanolett.9b00381","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.nanolett.9b00381","venue":"Nano letters"}

In certain circumstances, the President may be better positioned than either the courts or Congress to be politically sensitive to state policy initiatives and to create the flexibilities in federal law necessary to accommodate them. A powerful example of this dynamic is presented by the problem of state marijuana legalization. A sharp policy conflict has arisen between the federal Controlled Substances Act, which purports to impose a zero-tolerance regime on marijuana distribution and use, and state laws permitting distribution and use of marijuana for medical and, more recently, recreational purposes. While the courts and Congress have played virtually no role in permitting such state policy experiments to go forward, the Obama administration's low key approach toward enforcing the CSA's marijuana ban in marijuana legalization states has created space for state level policy experiments. The article argues that the Obama administration's position reflects political sensitivity to the policy preferences of a small number of marijuana legalization states that play an outsized role in presidential \"electoral math.\" The marijuana legalization example provides strong evidence that presidential politics can be a significant political safeguard of federalism where a grouping of \"swing states\" has a salient policy preference that is inconsistent with a well-supported national policy alternative in an era of close presidential elections.","inCitations":["d5d1c778d00d0c81371279a044af9cee27f8bef7"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.buffalolawreview.org/past_issues/62_3/SCHWARTZ.pdf","https://digitalcommons.law.buffalo.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4454&context=buffalolawreview"],"title":"Presidential Politics as a Safeguard of Federalism: The Case of Marijuana Legalization","doi":"10.2139/ssrn.2326688","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.2326688","venue":""}

However, the packaging of the star formation is varied. Sometimes stars form in clusters reminiscent of the predecessors of globular clusters, and other times they form primarily in a tidal clump that is the size and mass of a dwarf galaxy. I report on a few recent projects that I have done with collaborators. We have been trying to identify the factors that determine whether star clusters or tidal dwarfs form in the debris of interacting pair. We have also undertaken a multiwavelength program to study Hickson compact groups. We suggest that Hickson compact groups can be on one of two evolutionary sequences depending on whether gas is converted within the galaxies or outside of the galaxies.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Star Formation in Tidal Debris","doi":"10.1063/1.2973574","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1063/1.2973574","venue":""}

The efficiency of the process depends on the thickness of the steel. The thinner the material, the more efficient the process becomes. As a consequence, quenching is equally efficient on a wire as on a somewhat thinner, but wider steel strip. Such high-tensile strip exists commercially and is available from different mills. The range of thicknesses and widths varies with the supplier, but 0.04 in. by 10 in. wide strip (0.1 x 25 cm.) is very common, sold in more than 1500-ft. (450 m.) coils. Ultimate stress is above 200,000 psi (14,000 kg./sq.cm.) and ultimate elongation is more than 2.5 percent. Elastic limit is higher than 160,000 psi (11,300 kg./sq.cm.). The advantage of a steel strip post-tensioning system lies in simplified construction due to simple anchoring devices and in easy tensioning techniques. The system promises to offer advantages especially for the construction of pressure vessels where prestressing forces are very large.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Prestressing with High-tensile Steel Strips","doi":"10.15554/pcij.01011971.48.60","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.15554/pcij.01011971.48.60","venue":""}

Three immunodominant antigens of Streptococcus equisimilis (Lancefield group C) with approximate mol. wts of 46,66 and 105 kDa were recognised by human serum IgG and IgA immunoblotting.

Antigens with similar migration rates were demonstrated in s. pyogenes, large colony human biotype group G streptococci, and streptococci of groups C and G from the “ S. anginosus-milleri group ”. Polyclonal antibody which was eluted from immunoblot substrates that contained the S. equisimilis 66-kDa antigen reacted with the 60-kDa antigen of S. pyogenes. Both polyclonal and monoclonal anti-vimentin antibodies identified the 46-kDa and 66-kDa antigens of S. equisimilis. The homology of these antigens among P-haemolytic streptococci has the potential to complicate both a strategy for the utilisation of immunoblotting for diagnostic purposes and the understanding of how such antigens may be involved in the pathogenesis of post-infectious sequelae.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"I mm u nod om i na n t a n t igens of Streptococcus equisimilis shared by other p- haemolytic streptococci","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

The equatorial Rossby wave will be modified and a kind of slower thermal wave has been revealed under the influences of inhomogeneities of large-scale sea temperature field. An interesting result is that the propagating direction of the thermal wave is opposite to that of the classical Rossby wave. The result also shows that the thermal wave becomes dominant when the meridional gradient of sea temperature in the mixed layer exceeds a critical value. As a first approximation, it seems that both waves obtained by this study may be used to explain the observational facts that the SST anomalies can usually propagate in both directions, that is, eastward and westward, during the El Nino events.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"On the influences of large-scale inhomogeneity of sea temperature upon the oceanic waves in the tropical regions — Part I: Linear theoretical analysis","doi":"10.1007/BF02677245","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/BF02677245","venue":""}

However, the upregulation of CYCE2 in NSCLC cells suggested that it has a key role in tumorigenicity. In addition, the RAS family proteins as oncoproteins were activated in many major tumor types and its suitability as the therapeutic target in NSCLC was proposed. Considering the crucial role of microRNAs, it was hypothesized that altered expression of hsa-miR-30d-5p and hsa-let-7b might provide a reliable diagnostic tumor marker for diagnosis of NSCLC.\n\n\nMethod\nReal-time RT-PCR approach could evaluate the expression alteration of hsa-miR-30d-5p and hsa-let-7b and it was related to the surgically resected tissue of 24 lung cancer patients and 10 non-cancerous patients. The miRNAs expression was associated with clinicopathological features of the patients.\n\n\nResults\nHsa-miR-30d showed a significant downregulation (p=0.0382) in resected tissue of NSCLC patients compared with control group. Its expression level could differentiate different stages of malignancies from each other. The ROC curve analysis gave it an AUC=0.73 (p=0.037) which was a good score as a reliable biomarker. In contrast, hsa-let-7b was significantly overexpressed in tumor samples (p=0.03). Interestingly, our findings revealed a significant association of hsa-let-7b in adenocarcinoma tumors, compared to Squamous Cell Carcinomas (SCC) (p<0.05). Also, analysis of ROC curve of hsa-let-7b (AUC=0.74, p-value=0.042) suggests that it could be as a suitable biomarker for NSCLC.\n\n\nConclusion\nTogether, these results suggest a possible tumor suppressor role for hsa-miR-30d in lung tumor progression and initiation. Moreover, upregulation of hsa-let-7b was associated with the tumor type.","inCitations":["9ddb976c78822a610491ce76215a1f13ffcd26a8","72f26181d3b442d27717e1ec96310220695ba731","36d151b1cd9f4a0543889a32c6c7d99eb74d465c","68ac0419baa9b7ab43a8addbb1e5a50cf75beba8","d5848a35068b885492e659812ba8a8bab57f9c92"],"pdfUrls":["http://ajmb.org/PDF/En/FullText/311.pdf","http://www.ajmb.org/pdf/en/fulltext/311.pdf","http://ajmb.org/PDF/en/FullText/311.pdf"],"title":"Clinically Significant Dysregulation of hsa-miR-30d-5p and hsa-let-7b Expression in Patients with Surgically Resected Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer","doi":"","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"Avicenna journal of medical biotechnology"}

The processes responsible for the non-tidal component may also modulate the tidal signal, altering its strength and frequency structure. Because of their manner of generation and propagation, internal tides are inherently irregular. The non-stationary character of these and other tidal processes provides an integral and useful property of tidal records, because it provides an opportunity to obtain insights into tidal dynamics and the interaction of tidal and non-tidal processes. It is, moreover, productive to use multiple approaches in analyzing coastal and estuarine tidal processes so that both the time-varying and average frequency content are determined. Only by confronting the causes of non-stationary behaviour in this way can some of the remaining challenges in tidal analysis and prediction be overcome, e.g. shelf and estuarine currents, river tides, internal tides, tide-surge interactions and tidally influenced ecological processes. Several examples illustrate the utility of non-stationary tidal analysis methods.","inCitations":["b590a6895bd7aa9b6864f7d19728b1c951686130","0329bac403e2060ae61a610c5eff3fa4958dfab0","c7e9979463907d3a62c532017791d9077617a0c0","d913227d70e765cadb8d5424a4fa74046fdcff58","a39a6946db967bd5abbd8d6f63360242d3089cef","433ff373a6ad26576e6a566cb0735a9bc208f046","e989838eb3c58f8f917b7aca69130c7f39900941","d75d9abe486b7835690c9abe9db2b9be755798a5","d9e0b68c62cbe3f5a85c9a9d23e3b2184626e88c","439f25fb1731b645c5aa6d23e932add0d0a80c14","d70e08541501085c7ec7512a2616dd3f8a669137","6047537a240a95fd412b486217f699d8e59a6135","296f14f7c58e8bdf60096f0d6f2ac30ace052dbe","2b709581743392aeee0b76fee55ff7fe2fc2a069","a4d940db3591bc9667be21046f775ab914c7b185","9569369769321cb8274d3e7462df96a34159f247","1df6badf2d401f6a31df0a7449145efa281f0953","7bd21f66f3dc664c0ee94be19559cd3493cab616","3714f617cafad314ec725ecb3808064bd948aaf1","8a9ece640af54b0fa2e15fe46828746d90dd8d8b","f4258fee052d84229321e4d66d6ef8e08fc20bcb","20395606c525d9b188abcd511c947c4dadd40039","b3bb6c2f54ffdeeb1c3d18f31792540c0b610bee","4f63481334856d1038d4ca918cc13ebd00d1c9f5","2ee1d76b3d8fb57288007453781096e1041a740c","8c936672a3b72a13cdf9730b9473e891e3f09f90"],"pdfUrls":["https://page-one.springer.com/pdf/preview/10.1007/s10236-003-0042-y"],"title":"Revising the paradigm of tidal analysis – the uses of non-stationary data","doi":"10.1007/s10236-003-0042-y","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10236-003-0042-y","venue":""}

Anthropometric data of height, weight, BMI and thickness of the subcutaneous fat layer are compared from two cross-sectional samples of German children and adolescents aged 6 to 18 years. The first sample was measured around 1989 and the second 10 years later around 1999. Both samples contain children and adolescents from the urban as well as from the rural population. The secular changes reported here are based on the comparison of medians of height, weight, BMI and subcutaneous fat layer thickness calculated for yearly age categories. Subsequently, medians of the 10% border categories are compared. These border categories contain the 10% smallest, lightest, slimmest or leanest subjects and the 10% tallest, heaviest, most corpulent or most obese subjects respectively of a yearly age category. The young generation shifted between 1989 and 1999 to a taller stature in the small as well as in the tall category. The secular pattern of measurements, which mark corpulence, is sex-specific and differs from that of length measurements. In general the light or lean subjects changed only little, however, there are clear age- and sex-specific changes in the upper border categories. Weight and BMI increased markedly in the upper border categories in young preadolescent children, but did not change much in adolescent boys of these category aged 15 and 16 and decreased in adolescent girls. Also the subcutaneous fat layer increased in the upper border category in preadolescent children, but decreased in adolescent boys and girls.","inCitations":["b831125c1b869eda349e89688fd909d85d558e63","b1b5103d4f260ba108a9ca4c22a58fa0408921d9"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Secular changes are different in distinct subgroups of the growing population.","doi":"10.1127/anthranz/63/2005/45","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1127/anthranz%2F63%2F2005%2F45","venue":"Anthropologischer Anzeiger; Bericht uber die biologisch-anthropologische Literatur"}

In the process of diffusion of human security norms in East Asia, several features have emerged. First, East Asians have accepted a comprehensive definition of human security regarding the perception of threats. Second, East Asians tend to think that human security and state security are complementary. Third, the constituent elements of the human security norms such as freedom from fear and from want, freedom to live in dignity, protection, and empowerment are already accepted by East Asian nations. We need an extra effort to elevate human security to a full-fledged norm in the region.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Human Security in East Asia: Assembling a Puzzle","doi":"10.1007/978-3-319-97247-3_1","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-97247-3_1","venue":"Human Security Norms in East Asia"}

Penelitian yang bertujuan untuk mempelajari keragaman genetik dan hubungan antara komponen hasil dan hasil wijen pada generasi F1 dan F2 persilangan Sbr 2, Sbr 3, dan Dt 36 telah dilaksanakan dari bulan November 2012 sampai dengan Februari 2013 di Padangan, Sitimulyo, Piyungan, Bantul, Yogyakarta. Penelitian menggunakan rancangan acak lengkap (RAL) dengan tiga ulangan. Bahan tanam yang digunakan adalah benih tetua, F1, dan F2 hasil persilangan antara Sbr 3 x Sbr 2, Sbr 3 x Dt 36, Sbr 2 x Dt 36, dan resiproknya. Benih bulk hasil persilangan ditanam secara rapat dalam baris pada petak-petak yang berukuran 4 x 1 m. Pengamatan dilakukan pada parameter tinggi tanaman, jumlah cabang, jumlah polong, berat polong, berat biji, jumlah ruas, panjang ruas, umur berbunga, umur panen, dan berat 1.000 biji. Hasil penelitian menunjukkan bahwa komponen hasil yang memiliki keragaman genetik besar adalah berat biji per tanaman (68,437%), berat polong (40,532%), jumlah cabang (33,251%), jumlah polong (30,269%), dan tinggi tanaman (21,256%). Nilai heritabilitas yang tinggi terdapat pada tinggi tanaman (65,52%) dan umur panen (55%). Komponen hasil yang memiliki korelasi nyata terhadap hasil adalah jumlah cabang, jumlah polong, berat polong, dan umur berbunga, sedangkan yang berpengaruh langsung terhadap hasil wijen adalah jumlah cabang dan berat polong. In sesame breeding program, information about genetic variations and relationships ammongs characters is very important to determine the success of line selection. Studies about correlation between yield and yield components of F1 and F2 from crosses of Sbr 2, Sbr 3, and Dt 36 was conducted on November 2012 to February 2013 in Padangan, Sitimulyo, Piyungan, Bantul, Yogyakarta. The treatments were arranged in complete random design (CRD) with three replications. Planting materials used were the seed of parents, F1, and F2 from crossing between Sbr 3 x Sbr 2, Sbr 3 x Dt 36, Sbr 2 x Dt 36, and their reciprocals. Bulk breeding seeds planted in rows in high density to reach maximum populations as the genetic resource in the plots according to its genotypes. The observation was made on plant height, number of branches, number of pods, weight of pods, number of nodes, nodes length, day of flowering, plant maturing age, and 1,000 seed weight. The results showed that, components which showed high genetic variation were weight of seeds per plant (68.437%), weight of pods (40.532%), the number of branches (33.251%), number of pods (30.269%), and plant height (21.256%). High heritability values was shown in parameters of plant height (65.52%) and plant maturing age (55%). Yield components which have significant correlation with the yield were number of branches, number of pods, pod weight, and days to flowering, while those have a direct effect on the yield of sesame are the number of branches and pods weight.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Hubungan Antara Hasil Dan Komponen Hasil Wijen (Sesamum Indicum L.)

This paper analyses the zones of safe working (in terms of the only in-train forces) by considering the variation of transported mass and length of the train. By increasing these latter quantities, it is worthwhile to optimize the load distribution along the train in order to safely increase the efficiency of railway transportation; furthermore, the optimal position of the slave locomotive around 2/3 of total train length guarantees a considerable reduction of compressive in-train forces and a balance with the tension in-train forces. Finally, the paper shows that the variability of technical parameters, characterizing the actual behaviour of the train, significantly contributes to the value of in-train forces arising during a braking.","inCitations":["50bf9aca4b722910db3e1a6cb58910e6ac86e2e0"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Analisi E Ricerca Di Zone Operative per Treni Merci a Trazione Distribuita","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Two patients had generalized neurofibromatosis with specific vascular lesions of the renal arteries, while 3 older patients showed clinical and morphologic signs of repeated renal cholesterol embolization. Experience with these 5 patients shows that angiography should chiefly be used in young patients with suspected secondary hypertension. Older patients with common vascular sclerosis should undergo angiography only where the indication is urgent, in view of the risk of renal cholesterol embolization. In 3 of 5 patients a lasting improvement in hypertension was achieved by antihypertensive drug therapy. Two older patients with cholesterol embolization died from complications such as uremia and therapy-resistant hypertension.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"[Rare forms of hypertension (neurofibromatosis and cholesterol embolization].","doi":"","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"Schweizerische medizinische Wochenschrift"}

In the model of tumor-bearing mice, the systemic administration of recombinant IL-6 was found to mediate the antitumor effect on the immunogenic murine tumors via the in vivo induction of murine CTLs but not on the poorly immunogenic murine tumors in our previous study. However, an in vivo experimental model capable of analyzing the anti-human tumor effect via the in vivo induction of human CTLs has not yet been established. Therefore, in the present study, severe combined immunodeficient mice were given human peripheral blood lymphocytes (SCID-PBL/hu), and thereafter human tumor cells were administered i.p. into these SCID-PBL/hu mice as a model of human patients with cancer. When these SCID-PBL/hu mice bearing allogeneic human CESS B blastoid tumor cells were treated in vivo with recombinant adenovirus vector expressing IL-6 cDNA, both the induction of CD8+ human CTLs against CESS cells in the spleen cells and peritoneal exudate cells and a prolongation in the survival of these mice were observed. Furthermore, SCID-PBL/hu mice were given peripheral blood lymphocytes from patients with cancer (gastric or rectal cancers) and autologous human tumor cells. The in vivo administration of recombinant adenovirus vector expressing IL-6 cDNA induced CD8+ human CTLs specific for autologous human tumor cells from human precursor T cells. The in vivo injection of the IL-6 gene also inhibited growth and metastasis in autologous human cancers. Based on the above findings, the experimental model using SCID-PBL/hu mice and the IL-6 gene delivered in vivo by an adenovirus vector might therefore provide a new strategy capable of analyzing an anti-human tumor effect and the in vivo induction of human CTLs by cytokine gene therapy without using the human body.","inCitations":["b9edd05416cab00fa2c3e7c35f8fa60abda2280b","ae86e3a8734016df3ded7754f18d824160148ed3","12b4052a9af1229176e74d32603d7a0201777eeb","70c0bdd89457e532371b4b25554c929fd10bb447","da1556eade85a44e390538ced98be3ddd9f9a88b","c207f9d34f4c32368e9b461e680abb88ff558e6b","184754cb69ba7ee92a16efb9a8b77b742196165b","ca0d976529cc6fad92be4b4a07749616ff8a1ca7","69962809a32fc743d8d9acfd7f7428781573cff1","f37768ac7db22addae93ad45f1c82ab2dbe030b4","86ae5f7a782fc3a60ef377e5b54e3806cf2b6111","fe46a1d5ee3c419c0f1829c5e58f45920e23bb04","2cdb23343224d63f53370d121c595f200b6b811a","fe8c2e27a509feb1c0c4fa969830a718cddbed97","3cab32e06b715c675a8692997636b16186d48a1e","d06625213623a38fbc493c0106f69b8f564c4f97","a5846efb81175e11ce57237b60b4bce0e7587970","e2d5a58a843c4a150ba1bfe000f3694d09b27d91","afb6dca297f32c73fa75f04a9d94b10c4182403f","40204eb9941682a1c7a066a9c9bf0adff64879cb","eb25ca46c7e411e952c63ded8455c9df1006bbd4"],"pdfUrls":["http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/canres/57/7/1335.full.pdf"],"title":"The anti-human tumor effect and generation of human cytotoxic T cells in SCID mice given human peripheral blood lymphocytes by the in vivo transfer of the Interleukin-6 gene using adenovirus vector.","doi":"","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"Cancer research"}

Here, we address a CNT oscillator encapsulated in a graphene-nanoribbon (GNR) trench as a novel design, and investigate its properties via classical molecular dynamics simulations. Because the energy barrier was very low while the CNT was encapsulated in the GNR trench, the CNT absorbed on the GNR surface could easily be encapsulated in the GNR trench. MD simulations showed that the CNT oscillator encapsulated in a GNR trench was compatible with simple CNT oscillators, so we anticipate that the CNT in the GNR trench could work as an oscillator. Thus, we can anticipate that the CNT encapsulated in a GNR trench can be applied to ultra-sensitive nanoelectromechanical oscillators and that this system has the possibility to be applied to relay-switching devices and to shuttle memories.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://arxiv.org/pdf/1605.03254v1.pdf"],"title":"Molecular dynamics simulation study of a carbon-nanotube oscillator in a graphene-nanoribbon trench","doi":"10.3938/jkps.69.426","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.3938/jkps.69.426","venue":""}
