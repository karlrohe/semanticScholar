Measurement of their levels by qPCR is directly influenced by the stability of normalization gene(s), which can be affected by the experimental conditions. The developing lung is a changing tissue and one normalization gene showing stability on one developmental day may be modulated over time. Moreover, some developmental events are affected by sex, which also has to be considered. In this study, we compared stability of five putative control genes in the lung between sexes from the pseudoglandular to the alveolar stages and in adult lungs. Expression of sno135, sno142, sno202, sno234, and sno251 was studied by qPCR in male and female lung samples collected at seven time points from GD 15.5 to PN 30. Cq values of sno251 showed the highest variation across the different developmental stages, while sno234 was the most stable gene. Gene expression stability was studied by geNorm, NormFinder and BestKeeper. Our data showed that ranking of genes based on expression stability changed according to developmental time and sex. sno135/sno234 and sno142/sno234 were proposed as best combinations of normalization genes when both sexes and all the studied developmental stages are considered. Normalization of let7-a RNA levels with different pairs of control genes proposed by geNorm and NormFinder gave similar data, while the use of less stable genes introduced a statistically significant difference on PN 0. In conclusion, variations in stability of normalization gene expression are observed over time and according to sex during lung development. Best pairs of normalization genes are presented for specific developmental stages, and for the period extending from the pseudoglandular to the alveolar stages. The use of normalization genes selected for their expression stability is essential in lung development studies.","inCitations":["56b8af8bec8f0ce5d4ba1de0c63fc4c3bca57be2","5cbe24bb51d05d621c847026892f707cb96150ee","34b2b9baa038c5e35edbf3e1b8a2a72c2202dc3a","0b629ab8f88d789aec39266849ed3fa1959e6d8a","63b47fed80d5b303b9794d26fa2ed1462fed0f79","999b0f0bcc88523adaefc7eef061b87a2161069c"],"pdfUrls":["http://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/pmc/87/31/pone.0111855.PMC4219792.pdf"],"title":"Identification of Most Stable Endogenous Control Genes for MicroRNA Quantification in the Developing Mouse Lung","doi":"10.1371/journal.pone.0111855","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0111855","venue":"PloS one"}

It was this thought that puzzled Thom Wiens in Wiebe's first novel Peace Shall Destroy Many, as he glimpsed the possibility that Mennonite knowledge of the Prairie and their First Nations neighbours was a denial of alterity, but he had great difficulty in finding ways to respond to this discovery ethically. An even more serious \"doubt about [his] ability to know,\"3 however, entered Thom's narrative when his faith in Deacon Block's mono logic insistence on knowing the only way to be a Mennonite began to crumble, and Thom found that he had himself become incommensurable against the tradition that had defined him.That doubt has since motivated Wiebe's 'Mennonite', 'First Nations', and 'other' writing alike. When Frieda Friesen narrates more than seventy years of her life, she implies that while her husband and Prairie space at one point appeared unknowable to her, she learned to know them. However, as I noted in Chapter 2, when she narrates her life and this knowledge from Paraguay in her elderly years, she admits that she no longer knows all her past selves.4 The seifs knowledge is not permanent, and it may be equally shaped by experience, memory of experience - which may become incommensurable with the 'original' experience - alongside the presence of the other in the seifs experience and her memory.While Frieda - as a farmer and a Mennonite - changed the Prairie through her work, as well as by amalgamating perceptions of space and Mennonite religious discourse, The Temptations of Big Bear proposes that Big Bear changed the Prairie considerably less in order to know it. Importantly, while the novel articulates Big Bear's belief in a transcendental being which created his world - the Prairie - that world cannot simply be summarized as the mystical concept of 'nature', something which transcends the impact of human presence, and which the First Nations know and the colonizer and settler cannot enter. Instead, Big Bear's Prairie is primarily a construct defined by presence and movement - both his own and that of the mus-toos-wuk (the buffalo) - and the novel shows that the Prairie cannot be known by way of the \"great black steel lines\"5 of colonization.As the numerous works by Wiebe discussed here demonstrate varying success in their attempts to engage with the other, they illuminate the impact that claims to presence and to knowledge have on both the self and the other. The collapse of the seifs knowledge in \"Where Is the Voice Coming From?\" creates a space in the narrative for the silenced other, and the Christian rhetoric of First and Vital Candle silences the other, but both narratives nevertheless shed light on the same ethical problem. Representing alterity without immediately decoding it into mere remnants of itself requires the self to interrogate its own position in the narrative. The other's presence imposes a responsibility on the self: the self is required to speak in response to the presence of alterity, but it is also required to speak in recognition of its own reconstitution.When Levinas discusses the seifs responsibility, he proposes that the self is obliged to speak in recognition of the other even before it appears to the self6 This would seem to place an excessive, even unethical responsibility on the self, but Levinas also makes a pertinent point concerning power in the relationship between the self and the other. It would be unethical to require the self to anticipate an infinite number of expressions of alterity before any of them appears: if the self spoke in recognition of one such point of alterity, it could pre-empt the emergence of another, or be silenced itself by the totality of the unknowable other. However, if the seifs responsibility is understood as an obligation to speak before the temptation to know the other arises, such a totality may not yet have emerged, and the self may speak before the temptation to domesticate the other's alterity becomes the privileged discourse. …","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Conclusion: Space and the Limits of the Self's Knowledge","doi":"10.1163/9789401209793_008","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1163/9789401209793_008","venue":""}

By analyzing how much our current understanding of anthropophagy owes to the discourse of travel writing and the simultaneous interaction between concept and medium, a better understanding of its implications in philosophical, political and scientific discourse can be perceived. It also elaborates on how we built self-identification through the uses of fears and cultural stereotypes. A quick glance at the structure of travel writing helps conceptualize how the encounter with Native Americans by Christopher Columbus transformed the Western perceptions of cannibalism and determined relations with other peoples in the following centuries, from Polynesians to Africans.

The Glasgow Ultrasound Enthesitis Scoring System (GUESS) was used to score the presence of enthesophytes, erosions, retrocalcaneal bursitis, and tendon thickening. Power Doppler ultrasound signal (PDUS) was used to detect active disease. Peripheral joint arthritis, acute-phase reactants, global health, disability, and foot impairments were recorded. A core set of biomechanical variables that influence the insertion of the AT and indirect estimates of tendon loading were compared between PsA patients and control subjects with and without enthesitis.\n\n\nRESULTS\nForty-two PsA patients with a mean disease duration of 10.6 (SD 9.4) years and 29 control subjects were studied. Seventeen (40%) PsA patients had clinically detectable AT entheseal pain. Twenty-eight (67%) PsA patients and nine (31%) control subjects had one or more GUESS enthesitis features, predominantly enthesophytes. PsA patients with enthesitis walked significantly more slowly than control subjects (p = 0.019) and generated lower peak ankle joint moments (p = 0.006), power (p = 0.001), and AT force (p = 0.003). Ankle-subtalar joint complex motion was comparable and no between-group differences were found for peak dorsiflexion (p = 0.59), eversion (p = 0.05), and internal rotation (p = 0.19).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn this group of PsA patients, the AT insertional angle was not influenced by ankle-subtalar joint motion in those with and without enthesitis. Moreover, the PsA patients with enthesitis had significantly lower AT loading.","inCitations":["e5a69bbb65f6e91ce2dc2725016be24a94765f69","5d1c0e2b5e6d3b746030054a412099363c1c8277","143416cd1b2d566e216652a5fedaef284eec9915","89113acca9f8e345a2009c2ec3964829e9778165","ad491db320cd162851658036cb535b082325a204","6cc1d394ab1543018a37da0f2852dc069410ac8a","02fee0cdef7f4d528bce639f8a2191e9946edfdd","720b89f44a263602d876353504e82760f1fcfc88","41642cc2ff37c4d873e641330df0d2d0271aaf7a"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Achilles tendon biomechanics in psoriatic arthritis patients with ultrasound proven enthesitis.","doi":"10.3109/03009742.2012.747626","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.3109/03009742.2012.747626","venue":"Scandinavian journal of rheumatology"}

Fine media stormwater filtration systems have the potential to mitigate these effects, through flow attenuation and pollutant removal. This work provides an overall assessment of the hydraulic and pollutant removal behavior of sand- and soil-based stormwater filters at the laboratory scale. The influence of time, cumulative inflow sediment, cumulative water volume, wetting and drying, and compaction on hydraulic capacity was investigated. The results suggested that the primary cause of hydraulic failure was formation of a clogging layer at the filter surface. Loads of sediment and heavy metals were effectively retained; however,the soil-based filters leached nitrogen and phosphorus for the duration of the experimental period. Media pollutant profiles revealed significant accumulation of all pollutants in the top 20% of the filter profile, suggesting that elevated discharges of nutrients was due to leaching of native material, rather than failure to remove incoming pollutants. It is recommended that the top 2-5 cm of the filter surface be scraped off every two years to prevent hydraulic failure; this will also avoid excessive accumulation of heavy metals, which may otherwise have been of concern.","inCitations":["e46ceb72fd8f49cedc40949c0d60b639527a2c56","f5a3661a362751ab427ab6fa392593b721339c27","32d57aa5560a23a6d98f9d8b84fe7b665a187f5e","35b9364a7c749370f940e6f6346eebae591b43d4","af321790cff075a9dfabf3721bfa0a1317521641","0c8b23138667cf343dc45bfc9086715ee0d2ef5a","6548909ade5a3e8aa71ef36cb01a6bfd01cd5d0d","7da9a34e8d22cd0feb351a70157c85922b91b10b","907351f83c051e72cdf8cc51fed65303521d8f9f","f8228d6326cc1a314be6e18827d31d03c92de660","0d36df09aef0ce280f4f77b186838bfc3074257b","eaaed94383924388eee8378692b4dab98252e1b1","fedc694a31a5c649578bed4ecd3ae1dfb81c22e3","10693c1feaebc98f5720f48040207ac9df3ea1c9","3b9a1aa15fbad419904921bf7e2c393340784807","d80fc7747b345862d8538fe1e2832ef53d63f154","78a01b0dabbe4ea74dd4b524eed2ee788a9453f9","65a76fae3f990c3fa68a5faec2ed9643dd53e42d","be1f9d2f38f5f9b4f4c84ac70a602eadaa21ef87","4c67249daa83ed6da087c443a0b09b5a58fe36e7","c1c5dd3d584bf9ef8b2ede8c060e4caa863690f9","4998d5c0a573f8a0ead34add1ea26901c59f1b78","e4579d719e23003ce7dd25343a231a73e9aa8800","33059b354c56fbc271bd999de1597392e916a0ba","9819d1421983b7e7c3aa6fb775bbb2b8669e559c","89ee59cab49cf157145d61d9ac845324e59bbc2d","397afdb2c6c2ce267df0fffe1d444d20c5a014de","f38f0113bdb409f8291816aede356685ca54ac4a","a9d3b5995216327b72918847ed33312ec84c394f","d854dd187eb1529f912c2edca8f39e1fa5f6b79d","c4322c38ef3bf62140e217d7ce596231d2807312","4b40a2462fbea4b4c57c7654265e417c27a39c38","2a50f57e5889fcd74d32ed2b4882cd8787868804","a685924abe2b662c1971df6a667ff46d8b09cf28","16eb28179f4a08a2608cbb8b55f95ec0e5c5d49c","e1308d151f2faf0d9c95d1666a0962cb316a4b01","8ba49de9ab8e6cd50db55e3f14abaff4161b1836","17496fad2a650d1a3dabc6de2169fdd2068def08","6718cef3dbb3f8d195b1140b60edabb7cbeffefe","db1f4d0a6755e30f961e56c5858528c7246ef03f","7ae9bf2fcc68ecfe591396e8988fdfce4c7941c6","77064c3baaa0231dd9646c8f89f58d7ce9f3573c","8e4809e6e8e92a8b19b02b2e1be1f3f852e37e10","de0a631fd402054e2d1e18f89937021bdf52ab4d","cd4971d6f3b014f4bc2fad530ada7e32121fdd9a","ce624ad2f7312c8e417db8ab5c7efaa7c6cd1fef","37ff6848039c92963177e4e22230a2c61ed1d0f3","29d2b8c5edc476b71d02760c3be86aa6e1938e7e","db182d2b62a736746c8bce56bf8227d998596d25","62531c739bc8c6d081d0ea4e39e5e4fc313b419a","a3a62dc08cb87e0d527c6f5fd382b8e349f71cf5","e8fbcdb18b87424b49500f827663b91a53ccbae1","45397876f7cdc4ff90574e9037be40242534df98","60f59c7e90d42e8ba3e3813d85bd8b15c55650f5","74e0e219660f99c2bb2b979f69c021e15f346e16","50c27bbf524ec156800273ace3a4b5af7bf27e17","99776d9fc8a360bee3157449eb9f193b254fa56e","a6ba7f295cd4e9d4900da9281544ac960d5998d0","35306d08475c9f96cb0f14cfd3b77c5adda55939","6e10c3035d72545d0004a103ce2822980081624e","e5cf97f32979e89e2ff592edaafd35478324130d","50678905949b28d08ef74cd9a8bf076bb77bb16b","26446e796d5ba17bb5a40e7b445482580327a24a","69b387c556078dc1636efb6239ddce100171b7eb","9f85ad54a00b17f8d07922716d4564311f44bdd2","df038ab65bd7d7c5d053bcb7915dbad54dc42d1c","4c4cd8eb23a933ed73c578bf6932cb9aa5e96bfd","249d53a7f101ba84cb9aed729fa2a8113bb8e27e","a5ebe180e145181d2e30101cba375fc004a84f11","7a2c1ae1487fd43220a16df164d3e31af831f1f4","1d3d5e76b9cc710a1aa55efcb802baad9bcf6f45","0499d8fbf53b40f32d997113efee895d0636fea9","28758e8e170c04069141b79780554a36c9590742","a8a3c18bfc4de740ba405894bfcf046048ce5404","2d8c5c384b94fe2469f5c92119c0aaaf9cc21c31","6def86d5054a2116b57a65ab4ae92bae16afde75","df14c25d4632cedde22489c6b1cd61a9d5ffdc77","9f0c85460c43e62bb0ac7b2c424976d5de0f02c0","8b2a6e868968c82d251471fbf7a0ff26c367a967","c568b6639a4b5330ba6a75ed0f5984380135d4e3","87845579b32c7fa8ffa8a1f4184b347377df85c2","8250f4950cfa4dba74b7c019594d231d2bfbb265","b28f73587d3a3cc73a712a423cbdbe527e1742d5","97176851cd0732bbec4e55eba1280bf7d467da7e","1d36d47fe09982ec341c8b43e7ebc06981feb30a","e7dcb3cf669d1a47d38bd21dfefe76e553238511","897a0637d0d4eb3dd9e781caa0b6d158b61e8152","5c2ef01c9270ebb87b014db4deaed17a3ed3efb7","880ba11a5176e6ab0297d8548834e810af865f97","49c63a718df19221563b67edb5627fab4f2c27ea","0ca415540816a15a96dbe7c71b02e14f26da2b0b","ff99336f44bccc2ffd8895f4a0b039ae20e06a25","fca10f8c432bb37918c6fb3fddaa0b7859954838","cbe5effc9ef8e8745b8433c4de6aaca091186d4c","ce0762a21fcf65ab3bb10ff3b2b99fad155d0e92","ea629612c723087fe4e91821899c4073147dafae","218909e74d7b0094108a6f386e53d80a702a4d5e","d240e5836ba8a44d079c84c639bb9a3755b6610d","cdd3b6e73e8f79b841f5aaa3deadfc96c6b53eaa","32b7ab676701528e97cee80f9eb4f8df59eb0572","e64755a1b847859ea434a0c94cf51733b7e66dfb","42a7ad3edfa4cf9eaeba2a83eae796c56792d1d4"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Hydraulic and pollutant removal performance of fine media stormwater filtration systems.","doi":"10.1021/es071264p","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1021/es071264p","venue":"Environmental science & technology"}

The arrays acted as a two-dimensional diffraction lattice which behaved as a light scattering medium for the light propagated in waveguiding modes within the device. Strongly scattered light emission through the front surface of the devices was observed. An increase in the device coupling-out factor for electroluminescent efficiency by using the scattering structure is demonstrated.","inCitations":["0e497b9351d3047328c60ae56e0a2fc18c62d49a","17bcab3e66e199ff621a2b2419923c889d7329b1","5f77572e7173dc8766423ec44b95d3f918b16ba9","da1fe4832d8e1f9f29d1e9d7b7603a9e15ca21ac","796580557e7f1d42d72f15ddea1e37db7d2e01a9","4667031f18f76d66b7d6921d5a6a3eb62a1c9e5a","0615258e848d652af36a5d3dab38169fee1ef534","5b9eee7b532c1f03bd2eea75e5f544ac4d52de8b","f3abe1aa87ecdaf0cc42a5d18d9ac57af1e1763c","78e3271337b2555aed34fb84e6b113306a72a0f3","28b4e47a4a45fd178d3ab379d13fd19a8529cae1","40adf3a0b092ad2b4ce08b717440f4deabd0d26d","686ebc241fa5ad61909dd20b51f4d3ce90f1a78e","238ffceecd5dcf8392e08677d2bf38b8b26fbbcc","38df12d511c150275da56bbbdcac74ba8f42fb78","4fd63ba6071779dfef71a2dd7ff76de1ef180f13","acf68fb7db42e96f573aa8e53ef60639cfb83ae8","73599939ac6081a332f986a049e01b40153690d9","c99880a8ccd4b196eb2ba619a6ec51edb24cebac","c29c520e6c228937a9bc46a09fb1c5564223399d","56c4ca49a2aa2159a902eda96ac99cf0ba707434","f02322cb8b7b88d13bb5bf6c2cda278eafb55b6e","d4458bc01d24ff55f63262b382c5edd2ec4d1af5","f7e8d3d3d0c744f886384a33cfe40e1d10e5d6b9","3514c5c8099f6908f793191e84fcbd3f78008917","71014c67538a477e8776f33a263e90fa0638e083","b0905a469dea3a69e1823356a4d726d3462df92c","3eb68bd0b47d34a9910d1c71c5c5f45a4ebe7d0a","511b7f40eb029fda47fbcde8e7b445a5e8b82a90","c341e5236128bcd4d8bbe07c25467be280d17a27","ab5ab3226dd35ed8050af0888d73d5d2e8b5ffa3","12490ca253388136cc61c455d8d722bf2f7c1867","db5c6c0975051e943a68ffb8b74f00096e13d822","e43645fdc59b0476be4c3a7a046c7e10bacef97f","4693caa4f4d6d908a9acdf7ba976fa5d187aa2e8","4cfd4556476820785d57248c3bede0a6a4aa12ab","7ed997aada56d4a34cfab9528ba95b45427328af","ddf24363fedc8edb340c07a9830afd8aa06c65b1","4302b2092b60ba6cc5ba803bd9a1757c5d210b6b","3c2a1d73c373e652ea11ea0c9002dfafc2815679","738470745a6397008f916485ab1a18abc9562f16","d776ed98f4ed3128c05366d4e383784276be13da","0f59d90119486881d84b2b1b29c9c2dffcbb11d5","55ec75ac6f2b8c38cfa5ecd33053a31c6bca56dd","433ab6b69cad256a628607442a6e0697bb9883d4","b4ed140bb2b9f8eb42da84d283c0ee0f03273cc0","ba61bd6955b93079dc2ec4e91cca00009d019870","abebd21782b007e462ddc8bc7bf6bd8c74ae5563","c4281749271c97771eae3d0e0238e18fb21778d2","696e43c50f02219040e27e564193aa62c956eec6","a55ba2c0aa920be2d2b7b92a0cdd37130a60f67c","103fa0de42a32ba4c558066cf1ec8ce019d4d24d","eed5565274724e62fae712b6e5d106269462592f","b5657abfffcc6c00c987fc8c2ee578756adcc884","277e066dfeb044594d1fae4f4253009a25e5cf8c","95604dbbc9f6d9196962e56fa977136822841b59","467843648e15c8489846776b049ce847ebcc3230","aeddbb3f245fd6d9f6d16ce91e978a73c015ca18","e62a3081d99aecb238f258a8ef1625590baff846","68502f8ac1890aa6e274125eb7f939cf75c45732","422c5acdcd850253c1f4ed0d95afbbc2b75bbe90"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Organic light-emitting device with an ordered monolayer of silica microspheres as a scattering medium","doi":"10.1063/1.125997","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1063/1.125997","venue":""}

This paper explores one example in the United States' effort to build an “Information Super Highway”; which may determine the way its citizens create and communicate knowledge in the next century. This NII will provide widespread access to private and public networks capable of transmitting data, voice, text, images and video. It will consist of user information appliances, local area networks, access networks, and regional and national networks with speeds of hundreds of gigabits per second. In the course of its development the U.S. Information Super Highway's scope has been broadened to include high-speed connections to public schools, corporations, and eventually homes. The building of national information infrastructure, raises important issues of ownership, management, operation, use, and economics. A diffusion model of NII is presented to address these implementation issues.","inCitations":["a1b10d82b93971f434e9f283b95fbd48df269d05","07015f5fc5a705717b332f2e97f94024417170f7","40960ea4094769757f7f6941bde78d0cb40aa992","600386e9ac4d5b720a94a28bb23545490fc8fc32","63f3201923810bb246f04c7637586c19ff3a94e6","b6bfa4302bccc4219dace70fcdbc11a7a13ebac4","8c0a79318767a0f073733fe15ed8dc34ac569e32","e1054d98dddfb63054ab0475014fb44d10b46246","babd8ee33b0caa4b229ec54a3f2d63a030076c22","b1ce067eadfdaba979180faa546fd86b74625efa","0ed0e245f5a279ac187d7ea6d3c9bd6f038cb2fa","3fb5d9cd2d9925fee3e6017f20c07f2ee0b9aef9","bf447382b4e0696fbf0d4e5da5831730abe80954","a0af2678ce1b97e89671007617ca3c15d4559843","b6b2717c6ecae471bcb2a13afbf8631f29acb473","465adab64cbc58497f1e23bcc0395f70614b6412","cca43fb90ab89ab498f9fcdee533dac36e9d7a7b","7fd43b1ed0d84dc30271fd56032a41bb27f3f7f5","4198f312f1b1df2464a4471e0fd006cfe0ec6bf5"],"pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1016/0378-7206(94)90016-7"],"title":"National infrastructure diffusion and the U.S. information super highway","doi":"10.1016/0378-7206(94)90016-7","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/0378-7206%2894%2990016-7","venue":"Inf.

For example, users are awarded ”virtual goods” like badges and points when they contribute to the community in the network by voluntarily sharing ideas and other information. In this paper, we aim to examine the effectiveness of a social gamification mechanism, named user scores, designed in Foursquare which is one of most popular location-based social networks. A user’s score in Foursquare is an aggregate measure based on recent check-in activities of the user, which reflects a snapshot summary of the user’s temporal and spatial behaviors. Whenever a user checks in to a venue, a list of scores of the user’s friends are visible to the user via a ”leaderboard” which ranks these users’ scores in a descending order. Given a pair of friends who participate in a score competition in such a gimification mechanism, we identify if one user’s scores have significant influence on the other user’s scores by utilizing the Granger Causality Test. To understand what types of users and what types of friends tend to participate in the score competition (i.e., their check-ins are more likely driven by such a gamification mechanism), we extract users’ features (e.g. user’s degree) as well as the features of pairs of friends (e.g., number of common friends, score similarity and ranking difference) to examine whether these features have correlations with those pairs of users who are identified as being involved in the score game. The identified influence on user scores has the important implication on applications including friend and venue recommendations in location-based social networks.","inCitations":["72724600cb2237e2d42d2a12f0a2a6301d8ef6c3","0b01eff6dfbec92d8923a32e765856b338405f46","4802ff4dc77a3df8c5839c92671b3f6e5bdc45b2"],"pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1007/s11042-014-2317-3"],"title":"Towards understanding the gamification upon users’ scores in a location-based social network","doi":"10.1007/s11042-014-2317-3","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11042-014-2317-3","venue":"Multimedia Tools and Applications"}

Aside from their role as potent anti-hypertensive drugs with few adverse effects, ACE inhibitors have numerous other effects that have only been partially explained.Antihypertensive therapy is the most effective treatment in patients with diabetic nephropathy, postponing the development of end-stage renal failure. Although this effect can apparently be obtained with all antihypertensives (except nifedipine), recent meta-analyses have indicated that the beneficial effects of ACE inhibitors on proteinuria and preserved renal function are greater than with other drugs.In nondiabetic patients, treatment with ACE inhibitors may delay or prevent the development of congestive heart failure following acute myocardial infarction. Whether this also occurs in diabetic patients is still unknown, but subgroup analysis of existing studies and controlled clinical trials in this area should be encouraged.\n In conclusion, ACE inhibitors are the only drugs that have been proven, in controlled clinical trials, to be effective in preventing progression from microalbuminuria to overt nephropathy. Furthermore, they are more effective in diminishing albuminuria at low levels of blood pressure reduction compared with other antihypertensives. In comparison with β-blockers, ACE inhibitors have the advantage that they do not mask the subjective symptoms of hypoglycaemia, nor do they affect the serum lipid profile.","inCitations":["4d14d3599dd981367136f51399d24f3e9f841525","78a7152f03bb334e3cbbba1272c1ac57038ae9c2"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"ACE Inhibitors in Patients with Diabetes Mellitus","doi":"10.2165/00019053-199609050-00003","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.2165/00019053-199609050-00003","venue":"PharmacoEconomics"}

Toward this end, a diblock copolymer composed of poly(ethylene oxide) and poly(((4-vinylphenyl)ethene-1,1,2-triyl)tribenzene) (PTPEE) blocks was introduced into epoxy thermosets. Before curing reaction, the mixtures of epoxy precursors with the diblock copolymer only emitted feeble FL under ultra-visible (UV) irradiation. However, photoluminescence was significantly enhanced after the curing reaction was carried out. It was found that the novel FL enhancement phenomenon resulted from the aggregation-induced emission behavior of PTPEE blocks, which was triggered by curing reaction. In the nanostructured thermosets, the fluorophore blocks (viz. PTPEE) of this diblock copolymer were segregated into aggregates, that is, a reaction-induced microphase separation occurred. Owing to the generation of PTPEE microdomains, the epoxy nanocomposites significantly displayed the enhanced dielectric constants due to the promoted contribution from electron polarizations via π-π conjugation in the materials.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Fluorescence Enhancement Induced by Curing Reaction in Nanostructured Epoxy Thermosets Containing a Diblock Copolymer.","doi":"10.1021/acs.jpcb.9b00925","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.9b00925","venue":"The journal of physical chemistry.

The present work describes the identification and efficiency of a consortium, isolated from Algerian industrial wastewater, to remove three anionic surfactants (i.e., sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate (SDBS), sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and sodium lauryl ether sulfate (SLES)). The genetic analysis of 16S rRNA indicated that these strains are Alcaligenes faecalis, Enterobacter cloacae and Serratia marcescens. Under aerobic conditions, pH 7.0 and optimum temperature of 30 °C, the mixed consortium allowed to degrade 85.1% of initial SDBS amount after 144 h of incubation with half-life of 20.8 h. While E. cloacae and S. marcescens pure strains eliminated 46% and 41% less SDBS respectively. Evenly, SDS was degraded at only 23.71% by A. faecalis strain. However, the degradation capacity of SDS by the consortium was very high (94.2%) with a half-life of 9.8 h. The SLES anionic surfactant showed a lower biodegradation by the consortium (47.53%) due to the presence of ether oxide units in the chemical structure of SLES which induced toxicity to the medium. The investigation of the biodegradation of this type of organic pollutants by microorganisms has recently become a key issue for the environmental protection area.","inCitations":["f60e23420306bbcb2928579ac71b9f6f1718c556","178fd6939a1816e7c69082537210215c4b612383"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Biodegradation of anionic surfactants by Alcaligenes faecalis, Enterobacter cloacae and Serratia marcescens strains isolated from industrial wastewater.","doi":"10.1016/j.ecoenv.2018.07.123","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoenv.2018.07.123","venue":"Ecotoxicology and environmental safety"}

The frequent changes of network topology, the path length between source and destination nodes also varies for changing of time. The path length happens to be a very important parameters for QOS routing. Predicting the path length from a source to a destination in ad hoc networks may help in several network functioning. The path length between a source destination pair depends on the mobility patterns as well as routing algorithms. In this article, We have considered the path length from a source node to destination node as a random variable and tried to predict them using the concepts of Moving average model of order q i.e. MA(q) of time series analysis. We also calculated the average path length and the performance of each mobility models with the routing algorithms.","inCitations":["a5c4145aeaeddf5c63b9c509b1e8d0a54cc38508","201feae749af3f47566611a2a717e766b34ff30c","463237cc1416db866a9e229dcdd83adb59e23632"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"The Path Length Prediction of MANET using Moving Average model","doi":"10.1016/j.protcy.2013.12.434","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.protcy.2013.12.434","venue":""}

A finite number of resonances results because of thermal motion. In plane geometry they all lie above the plasma frequency ωp. When the temperature tends to zero they tend to the well known resonance at ωp. It is shown that in the presence of binary collisions the amplitude decreases very rapidly with increasing frequency due to Landau damping. However this phenomenon requires binary collisions and does not exist in a strictly collision-free plasma.","inCitations":["26e80f8babc30cb5455cc925f7d5b2a67dcce196"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Longitudinal plasma oscillations","doi":"10.1088/0368-3281/4/5/304","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1088/0368-3281%2F4%2F5%2F304","venue":""}

Insurance companies are basically human intensive, and human resources act as an undoubted differentiator. Quality manpower and its retention would act as a litmus test. Turnover of sales force has been high because of low entry and exit barriers. The paper addresses issues of recruitment, retention and turnover of sales force in insurance companies. An attempt is made to integrate them to Maslow’s Need Hierarchy. A survey was conducted among 350 employees who worked in or had left insurance companies to analyze factors that influenced their decisions and job satisfaction. The data were treated with factor analysis. Factors such as Safety & Security, Social & Esteem and Personal Work Style emerged as the influencers to join insurance companies. Primary Needs and Social & Self Esteem Needs were the factors associated with job satisfaction; Stress, Career Advancement and Work Environment emerged as factors for leaving the companies.","inCitations":["c8bc3cfd489f8f0c521cb342954960d07c742209","053a5f2709b72d20a9016c08f3c74cc5c2cbdea3","b885d2447cdcdc0b6194e513e675e478fbf411b8","b4b7389705696c197737ca1fd7543eb696774836","f435ad98269e6c2228df7f157d73b35576d36813","f96f3ca5193928bebb8f6657cb286a5ab644bcec","bb62a376966aad518c87e29302c71b69828cce47","6aadb3d5827f718dd6692b691384c16006074a5f","6613ebfcc4518afc401f2eb5ab8a23297bdde55b"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.fm-kp.si/zalozba/ISSN/1854-4231/5_003-019.pdf"],"title":"Sales Force Turnover: An Exploratory Study of the Indian Insurance Sector","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

The purpose of this paper is to examine whether gender affects the total compensation of today’s CEOs, and whether it moderates ten factors influencing their total compensation.,Taking the 54 female CEOs cited in the US 2014 Fortune’s 1000 report, a matched sample of male CEOs was selected, matched according to the crosstab of age by education and by the sizes of the companies directed by these female CEOs.,Using four years’ worth of Fortune reports, between 2013 and 2016, this matched sample indicates that female CEOs are not discriminated against in terms of total compensation. However, eight factors do show a significant effect on total compensation. Using moderation analysis, the present study reveals how gender interacts with company size, sector, membership of outside boards and nature of previous experience.,This paper addresses an important and under-researched gap, with contradictory findings in the existing literature, by compiling and testing the characteristics of male and female CEOs which are not cited in Fortune 1000 reports.,Arguably, this is therefore one of the first papers to study gender differences in total compensation among Fortune 1000 CEOs using a matched sample technique, based on a larger number of female CEOs and a larger number of years than any previous research.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Is there still a gender effect on CEO compensation","doi":"10.1108/JMD-09-2018-0277","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1108/JMD-09-2018-0277","venue":""}

Typical signet-ring cells and gray-blue material were observed in parabasal and intermediate stratum. The large cytoplasmic vacuoles of signet-ring cell were negative for periodic-acid Schiff (PAS), Alcian blue (AB), mucicarmin, AE1/AE3, EMA, MUC2, MUC5ac, HMB45, p16INK4a and CEA. EMA and AE1/AE3 immunopositivity draw the outline of signet-ring cells. The gray-blue material and septum of small vacuoles also expressed AE1/AE3, indicating that they might contain intermediate filaments. The blocking staining pattern of p16INK4a encouraged the diagnosis of high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion which carries a significant risk of invasive cancer development if not treated. HPV type 6 and 16 infections were confirmed by Hybrid Capture HPV test. Due to the similarities in molecular profiles it is conceived that signet-ring cell in HPV-related squamous cell lesion may represent a rare variant of koilocyte.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://www.ijcep.com/files/ijcep0014464.pdf"],"title":"Signet-ring cell in papilloma virus type 6 and 16-related non-neoplastic squamous cell lesion","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Where there are no contraindications to their use, tocolytics can improve neonatal survival rates by approximately 3% per day between 23 and 27 weeks gestation with a concomitant reduction in morbidity. The ultimate aim of tocolytic therapy is to prolong pregnancy until growth and maturation is complete, but even short-term delay may enable the administration of antepartum glucocorticoids to reduce hyaline membrane disease or to arrange transfer to a center with neonatal intensive care facilities. Both of these have been shown to reduce neonatal mortality and morbidity. Until recently, none of the currently used tocolytics, whether licensed or unlicensed, were developed specifically for the inhibition of preterm labor and consequently, they exhibit various potentially serious side-effects. As a result of the recent licensing of the oxytocin antagonist, atosiban, developed for the treatment of preterm labor and due to its high utero-specificity, obstetricians have experienced an advance in their options for the management of spontaneous preterm labor.","inCitations":["1b42a2258a59fc58d25a293ed4e6e80bbcd70882","9c58137cc20ceb63629bb3fef86742285121f267","8009cc97b4eb19641a027424eca4f23ba16f23b1","8276b5d44aa42142c8f9e121f86801899ddcaa19","cf3c263a793ce42bb0e71f2a318575dac38691d8","6089c216831ef6c5e23bccf5a14fb88ccec1518d","e039519b2705c71218fd5f612d4a61f1adfe2c99","e82f938be58c876f2e81fde69ddb9cf12c3baf53"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"An update on the controversies of tocolytic therapy for the prevention of preterm birth.","doi":"10.1034/j.1600-0412.2003.820101.x","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1034/j.1600-0412.2003.820101.x","venue":"Acta obstetricia et gynecologica Scandinavica"}

Myocardial calcification was first detected by 2-dimensional echocardiography performed 3 months after starting dialysis. The patient was not suitable for renal transplantation because of his cardiac dysfunction and died of cardiac and respiratory failure at the age of 6 years.

Our research, which focuses in women’s positioning in higher education, indicates that such transformations occur in particular through everyday spatial practices, inter alia through what we refer to as local tactics of mobility by women seeking higher education.

The key step of the phototransformation of provitamin D into previtamin D from which the vitamin D3 is formed by thermal conversion. According to studies run at the latitudes of Hungary the UV-B radiation in winter time is not satisfactory to ensure the need of the vitamin D, which can result in vitamin D 3 deficiency and increases risk of osteoporosis.\n\n\nAIMS\nThe aim of this study was to verify whether in the Hungarian population the UV radiation from the Sun ensures the daily synthesis of 1000 IU vitamin D3, or Vitamin D deficiency could occur in the winter and spring months which are less favourable in terms of UV exposure.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThe data of UV-B radiation reaching the Earth's surface were used for the evaluation. These data based on regular measurements in Budapest. According to the average of UV-B radiation of each months the \"best case scenario\" of vitamin D3 production was estimated by using the most optimal conditions of vitamin D synthesis.\n\n\nRESULTS\nIt was calculated, that the effective UV irradiance reaching the Earth's surface at noon in Budapest is the highest in July, while the lowest is in December. The difference between these two months is more than 35-fold for July. In the period between November and March more than 200 minutes have to be spent outdoor to ensure the production of satisfactory amount of vitamin D in skin. On one hand, it is irrealistically long time because it exceeds the duration of maximum irradiation around noon which was the basis of our calculation. On the other hand, if only the face and hands are uncovered then the required radiant exposure exceeds the 1 minimal erythemal dose, i.e. the skin would be burnt.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nBased on our calculations it was found, that in Budapest more than 95% of yearly effective UV-B radiation is measurable in the period between March and October. Therefore it can be assumed that the UV-B radiation would not be sufficient in the period between November and February, even if its efficacy would not be limited by clothing and less time spent outdoor which are anyway characteristic and necessary in that part of the year.","inCitations":["14db747fd3ef0244cda76fff9e313e651fd71ecf","96ae6a8c60559888e03f6713d308560df9f71a82","1ca8167c9de8413d672d4b0f52382792aa256366","bcda6e4d760e9d29e0e96257529fd17fe7da7bf2"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"[Vitamin D forming effectiveness of ultraviolet radiation from sunlight in different months in Budapest, Hungary].","doi":"10.1556/OH.2007.27840","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1556/OH.2007.27840","venue":"Orvosi hetilap"}

The rats were divided into sham and OVX groups. The OVX rats were then subdivided into five groups treated with water, nylestriol (1 mg/kg body weight, weekly, orally) or icariin (ICA) (5, 25, and 125 mg/kg body weight, daily, orally) for 12 weeks. In OVX rats, the increases of body weight, serum BGP and ALP were significantly decreased by ICA treatment. In OVX rats, atrophy of uterus and descent of BMD were suppressed by treatment with ICA. In addition, ICA (125 mg/kg body weight) completely corrected the decreased serum concentration of Calcium, Phosphorus, and E(2) observed in OVX rats. ICA (125 mg/kg body weight) increased biomechanical strength significantly in comparison to the sham group. Histological results also showed its protective action through promotion of bone formation. The findings, assessed on the basis of biochemical, bone mineral density, biomechanical, and histopathological parameters, showed that ICA has a definite antiosteoporotic effect, similar to estrogen, especially effective for prevention bone fracture induced by estrogen deficiency.","inCitations":["38cdeed157b7a71d5bf247ec914a89a2024d31b5","ec7196d65fe0863ad175162e02cd01230b5abbdf","f4732b14da6d91966742ac6506224f777037d385","8dd49b3be00a3c337a2510a048ba54949cb1bffb","7074b7073dc6a1bf1172dc0645e72135d5099604","366c13628e8bcbccecdec358a12b729349565ce1","035d80854733255af6176030510e398907a600c1","bf708f9dc9c6ff4749795c57a74a44c82f7fdc2b","7ab2bb3255a95e361eb8826f484b494f800da89c","3ac73882503f77aa770c139ef1e617bcf7a5ba7c","43eac56bb23ef01c6ca104763193742e73c10495","3cc2cc16ad49311b5fc1b120373cc1c99fd0284a","1116a73f28856106d5d4a310ab951309bc7a29d0","ced65d79803001f74ba7aade129864d3a3de51c2","abf9602a35509342af037a7d09ac807d1df7a78b","219d04ffb72cc9a2a6cab4453d54d2764b329344","79b03914e542689b306808bba100556ec8fb654c","3744067257ac13fff3949fa0ccd045e6f54c6cab","192fb67872af2ebed67fcdadc14539b2e00dec9b","4ec0f06e795c4e703a1e3eca23fa82c314c2461d","f184159bd2eea830dfa0cc62148761df4b145775","b32f44673155d15a461db0ecc3ab03746457ad25","96f247dffc8ea4ba663729c737466e7be8f692ad","46501abe9898ec586f1374f4e1deb3a49f1c2fa1","93c27d48a9a9f85313cfa9ce9fed6f2e5e321096","595453d98274a4d8d5413fb5fbb35aa90d307f32","f73f52a7b50664019f42244a614e5be6ce854215","51ad4458ed8b4481585adf9bbf5e7c47751a7dfe","2f6e7ad519c51321f5977a232268daa9f085d2bd","57d9c067371830a91a7aebda9623178e6b50fb2c","7d45ee0b563401ce931034cb55364c98cbff2a1c","efee13885411f4315995f4d65ed569307399312a","8446b4883930340196a37dfceac701519a1968e2","31c73957faf1f9d67fa5c05877861a406d5da120","14dfa9e50db5ff70ec99857e4dd67b5fed7c5436","c3eb3bb3a211669c262729675d89884bb13253f3","33893ac2aa485d13afec34b0bb82a048ef4120d5","7c32abc9d3173e98b7432220db26c441e87a9204","51a0b29335d914c4ee4ebeacaf645f22702021bd","d72b3d194e665720272a26532d46f868ed0e66a4","efe33d24882eaf329b5c77b18e6a7c58740c0b50","4a2b7321351d881db7a55d0c98484ace176b48d0","799c2923b44df0fed946c2d2d8c7775719962d69","5fd16652f0847e2273addc28af2e1f1a61fc284d","710bf4b5e1593265fa48e0b1545ea686cf589ed3","c6ee5d2f104a91958570d9f495ed8125a2ac8b2d","02c0a7aac6cf8dac7980e0ee39654da4c4e34740","c399ade33ee70f754ba053f410b128efbcdae85c","b5c9028e402d021a0f2acbfb9131a2210bc7bc57","50daf73e4189e7862215a2b6b46ffc8099a7f8ad","cd569736849b221a913476b9e3d0ddac1abcc3b2","fcf699385302b57668bc89b1a947fd4a63292d59","55e2667679f6eb1b587edea8b8cdfa8846ce6bd2","cf901ca1a7af92ef146d6bce33175b2f095c2487","9354f4ccbda756b219fecd1402b68b51fb21b504","ea63fe58e13d6053c2428acceb03093cd5c5ebe7","c9838ed6fddf33ad136cab824ca990a3904d09f2","591fe087d7cd97d4dcb90ba1d594392948f07485","040271c7bf53c0bd2228166aa2a15dbcc81a3092","383213ad92af879c43b3fd389b24d4465d6142d6","dc25da07caa1d711606d1e215fbcac65c75b346a","65190d429dfd4a7e7500eb180b9834ef6af012f1","a00838a7ee686c84b17fef2aac5025e44cd8ba73","04686ee01eec56a0875418f849e8f1af7f22d305","b0e4989067df6d3bfc604fb674cb3efb4d869f54","b4001241cedac763c6d1e1c1782bd7bb2a48a2a5","e9086ccfd23eec5462af492107a96f79ec7771be","4f0f2948da75f1c65697402b5a5cd233cfe7c334","473e30b1ecef17967e0ad25e6c0eb792e589a74c","bdb6178aa5a353f021cfdd3ccfa713a2350a88b2","cf3c983dbc40db0523badadb5490d29f14b73e33","d72d3815b3e8c8d6e1a692003b04261ba1a1c1d7","c454c6a58ca1ef437fb712f48136ec7d2bd6bee8","76c98c0ff6702ac473fccabe54e38e1784a9df36","bc305de53d080b802d57db94cb50c04cf2130fdf","10d44ec73a3d826b5fe3ac96f3601c12392942b9","d1ba85211e333ff1faabf956ff516a43d743dfc3","95db480cec3fd95d68e2a222b7a9b282aca07215","25758b8d2398ccc318379449a8f1f86c853527ee","8ca98173edf4bdaf09fb87a4fc9ff75e7e520f3e","615ad4e32192b2a867de21d5667bfa97b891b5ce","704b990525f4bd3b44c447effecf4a9a24199b63","8d9f1de452186550627785fd9ba7900e6f8f7761","60e50c39238c866808d9c51a2c18367f31bf9ea8","60c3c92d9e779c72f265cdfb766558463d787d16","a01f9fc3359a519ed114c3f226995279c913c747","e853192a614f26ef58a2b925c4a19a1765a87712","cbb264247c51dd43531ea376bd4d664b3d858837","1d7813d987cb47acd471fe279ebfb3be00b506b5","25b8f84b516ef2521e468580dc0fc0f802f200bb","fcaf4330d4c6069e63f1c3663e5bc1739b42c53f","c1d46b825d15a16426e611c82b0fb8fad409445a","4f4446f7bcba4e0412fc7b617068642bf599feec","f9e1fae2d0854b872583deb90e52f0f8a7d00b2f","92a369b6296e2b083201cd6875e7752764bc1ec7","35ec83df4f8fb56c9118eedbb8264b7da8722610"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Antiosteoporotic activity of icariin in ovariectomized rats.","doi":"10.1016/j.phymed.2008.12.006","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.phymed.2008.12.006","venue":"Phytomedicine : international journal of phytotherapy and phytopharmacology"}

This study investigated the histopathology, staging, risk factors, and outcomes of cutaneous melanoma in this young subset of female patients. The authors extrapolated 2 important, emerging conclusions from their work. First, pregnant women had a higher incidence of melanoma mortality, recurrence, and metastasis compared with nonpregnant control subjects. Second, women presenting at 40 to 49 years of age showed higher rates of melanoma-related death and positive sentinel nodes. In the discussion, the authors explained these interesting findings with several hypotheses, such as a possible delay in diagnosis during pregnancy, adverse effects of high serum estrogen levels, and physiological pregnancyrelated immunosuppression. However, we would like to make some comments regarding another possible biological mechanism to explain worse melanoma prognosis and mortality in pregnant patients and in the older age group. From the literature, we know that estrogen signaling depends principally on the balance between estrogen receptor (ER) and ER expression. Particularly, a loss of antiproliferative ER protein negatively affects neoplasm prognosis in estrogen target tissues. Our group has demonstrated that there is reduced expression of ER in melanoma tissue compared with perilesional healthy skin. Thus, an increased ER /ER ratio could be the cause of the progression or dormancy of melanoma; ER supports the proliferation of melanocytic cells, whereas ER has an inhibitory and regulatory effect on the invasive capacity of melanoma. Furthermore, the loss of the ER protein in melanoma is directly proportional to Breslow thickness, its most important prognostic factor. Interestingly, the amount of ERs in the skin declines with age in women, whereas the positive feedback from estradiol decreases with decreasing plasma estradiol levels in the perimenopausal period. In particular, ER expression diminishes more rapidly than ER expression in the perimenopausal period, thus increasing the ER /ER ratio in the skin. Even during pregnancy, some authors have highlighted a loss of the ER protein.

Yet, there is increasingly robust evidence that pastoralism is a viable and sustainable livelihood and that pastoralists play a role in attaining the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). In this issue of the Scientific and Technical Review of the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE), the authors take a broad view of pastoralism and pastoral livestock production from a number of different perspectives, taking into account societal and ecological viewpoints as well as issues of animal and human health. Thematic reviews are complemented by regional perspectives from Central Asia, China, Europe, East, Central and West Africa, and Latin America. The broader issues of pastoral livestock production and its potential for improving and sustaining animal health are of great interest to the OIE. Summarising the diverse contributions, it appears that pastoral socialecological systems are hotspots of cultural and biological diversity. They are multifunctional in that they generate diversified sources of income and contribute to sustained natural resource management. Pastoral populations require favourable institutional and legal frameworks, so governance structures must be improved and reformed through effective participation and the empowerment of pastoralists. To sustain functional pastoral production systems, the key ingredients are decentralised governance of natural resources, better locally adapted social services, and high flexibility for maintaining mobility. Young people should be actively encouraged to engage in pastoral livelihoods, which should be supported by improved legal systems for land use by all interested parties. There is still untapped potential to optimise extensive livestock production through adapted genetic improvement and better transformation, stocking and marketing of animal-source food. Modern concepts of disease surveillance and response, combining human and animal health as 'One Health', are particularly suited to pastoral systems. The OIE's interest in pastoralism is highly justified given its economic and environmental importance and its significance for livelihoods. Sustainable improvements require understanding and discussion of diverse social and ecological interactions, and it is to this discussion which the authors and editors of this issue of the Review have endeavoured to contribute.","inCitations":["d65c469ca63765785fdfeeec116d38136857d83a","3e149d4c50a7b3726d1930a1a2155641e96af227","612cdd2dc1a3d7f568c7777c9f48469a69cf516d","daf34d9bbbe87a1b1e3677f979bb5ec7d66b600c","5df108aebe204b20b9d316f2f48a6dfb52e8984b","a18aafd17d5b73ab1ded1e7e73bf1458726cc692"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"A vision for the future of pastoralism.","doi":"10.20506/rst.35.2.2550","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.20506/rst.35.2.2550","venue":"Revue scientifique et technique"}

But the eruption of the uncanny depends on more than simply formal considerations. Although certain kinds of narrative transgression will produce it, the effect is linked both psychologically and politically to wider issues. Male and female interactions involving power and sexual desire are determinants; so also may be the historical and political experiences of class, race, or age, and certain specific features of culture, such as imperialism and the fear of what is brought back from colonial adventures. My argument is that unresolved contradictions, unadmitted fears and desires, and incompatible assertions of the culture produce these areas of slippage, these discontinuities of meaning, these phantoms, and this generation of powerful affect by the literary text, giving the reader a sense of the uncanny.

Stomach contents suggest that prey size generally increases for bat body size, but within these species there is considerable overlap. R. naso, S. leptura, and P. kappleri each appear to be specialized for foraging in a particular habitat type; B. plicata and S. bilineata are more opportunistic and feed over a variety of habitats during the year. While the other species feed in the proximity of surfaces, B. plicata is further separated from the other species by wing specializations favoring high altitude flight.2.Foraging dispersion is more closely related to body size than it is to social structure at the roost: small bats group-forage while larger bats feed in solitary beats. In all of the species, food is spatially and temporally variable, and the location of foraging sites changes seasonally in accordance with these locally varying patterns of aerial insect abundance. In the case of S. bilineata, the locations of foraging sites were positively correlated with levels of phenological activity in the underlying plant communities.3.Colony sizes ranged from small groups of 2–10 bats (S. leptura, P. kappleri), to intermediate colonies of 5–50 bats (R. naso, S. bilineata), to very large colonies with hundreds of bats (B. plicata).4.R. naso, S. leptura, and S. bilineata colonies have colony-specific annual foraging ranges which are actively defended against conspecifics from other colonies. In most cases, all members of a given colony of one of these species will be found foraging in a common site at any time. In R. naso and S. bilineata, currently used foraging sites are partitioned socially. In the former species, adult breeding females occupy a central area and groupforage while younger non-breeding females and males occupy peripheral foraging areas in the colony territory. In S. bilineata, the colony foraging site is partitioned into individual harem territories defended by harem males and containing the individual beats of all current harem females. For this latter species, details of roost site subdivision are mapped directly onto foraging dispersions. In general, there is a close correlation between dayroost group membership and location of nocturnal foraging sites in all of the study species.","inCitations":["9d2ad19ab6b6fdbecfe3e950edba8a5e94be1694","7a7da3322a24356efe9e4790755b002c4af32ae9","f0fe2107e87e6c41d536ae52b03bb5bdb3b74564","6973706eaa4888c0c4d53431f98c4e3d98ff6b0b","448a61fb4fa98c289715850fbf7e81dcfef7bf17","90b944a5fe3f62f58ad72d42a4ba64d5534cac90","4b786bb2495bb4e07285a05e4e6e96f1c4d5a540","1d1f46e6c5fde95bc82e44c51c076167db0fa75d","efa3f137d13ecc44c527ceff8b2e01817e208fb2","9ab4348bd08dceb940f3bbc051f81a6dd95e57ad","f9f33a932bdbdc1c078871e3bbe0d1e33160c270"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Social organization and foraging in emballonurid bats","doi":"10.1007/BF00299399","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/BF00299399","venue":"Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology"}

This increase in the power handling capability is largely due to the improvement in breakdown voltage of these devices, which has been achieved by several important technological break-throughs in the processing of these devices. This paper reviews these developments for the case of junction gate field controlled devices. These devices can be classified into the majority carrier devices such as the power junction gate field effect transistor (which has also been called the static induction transistor and the gridistor) or the bipolar devices such as the field controlled thyristor (which has also been termed the static induction thyristor and the bipolar gridistor). In all these devices, the forward blocking capability is achieved by means of a gate region which is designed to pinch-off current flow between the other terminals. Consequently, the design and fabrication of the gate region plays a dominant role in achieving a high power handling capability in these devices. This paper describes the basic device operation of both the unipolar and the bipolar devices. It also discusses the technology for the fabrication of both surface and buried grid devices.

While identifying thermodynamically and technically feasible options for retrofit-based energy savings is an important necessary step, it is not a sufficient one for achieving real savings. A further necessary step is the selection of a set of economically feasible and attractive ways of implementing the identified retrofit options. This paper provides an analysis of the investment planning concepts as applied to the retrofit of Heat Exchanger Networks (HENs) and identifies the key issues for retrofit implementation and planning. The paper concludes with the formulation of further research goals, aimed at the establishment of an integrated method for optimal planning of retrofit investments in energy systems.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://www.aidic.it/cet/18/70/130.pdf"],"title":"Asset management for energy system retrofit","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Several high-quality lending operations have been important components of this support. In stabilizing and rebuilding a post-war economy, Bank experience in El Salvador indicates that the scope and complexity of economic structural reforms should match the government's capacity and commitment. The Bank should pursue appropriate conditionality as an expected element through its leadership in aid coordiantion, in its direct policy dialogue, and through its portfolio. The Bank should be prepared to take some risk in supporting innovative pilot activities, such as EDUCO, that have the potential to reform deficiencies in pre-conflict policies and institutions. Micro-insecurity and an inefficient system of justice are two of El Salvador's most serious socio-economic problems. The Bank can stress the need to strengthen the justice and law enforcement systems in its dialogue with the government, and encourage other donors to add their voices to persuade government to move on both issues.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"La reconstruccion en los paises en etapa de posguerra : Uganda resumen de estudios de casos","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

For such applications, the simulated images should be as realistic as possible so that conclusions can be extrapolated to clinical PET images. In this work, we describe a method for introducing realistic modeling of radiotracer heterogeneity into Monte Carlo simulations of patient PET scans. The modeling of the complex physiological activity distribution in healthy regions is directly based on real patient PET/CT images, and realistic tumor shapes can be included into these regions. This method represents a competitive alternative to the use of complex anthropomorphic phantoms such as the XCAT, that require a fixed activity per structure. The method is extended to the simulation of serial PET scans with tumor changes, as acquired in the context of therapy monitoring, and this extension is validated using a patient study. Using the proposed method, very realistic patient PET images can be produced for evaluation purposes.In addition, a strategy to efficiently simulate many sets of pathological cases, based on a unique background physiological activity distribution, is described and carefully assessed using a numerical phantom. The background activity is simulated only once, while tumors are simulated separately. The data are then recombined in a specific way so that the final image has the same properties as images produced by simulating pathological and tumor activities at the same time.","inCitations":["be91a852a4d03527f4da917e0eb5899376d834af","f9e3a2d77066c193a10f64b981a4b8c89dcb119d","3f96ddd3e9dcb27c6c2f8d048d4591b6f76940d9","f7d2d8a4fb4580b802c31b09bf25fc819f5e613a","50a440cc66770ccef27f25c3ab756ef8b53d38e5","9872c8e258f49e13f004024c62668907b0b4c669","3091c5643c16cc0078e8d696d5afe0871cd199f3","b649a536f799faac7066b3bbbb321c6a4c044907","1907143086ecf3e529e0c2befba8760fc53c2d57"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.guillemet.org/irene/article/Stute2012.pdf"],"title":"Realistic and Efficient Modeling of Radiotracer Heterogeneity in Monte Carlo Simulations of PET Images With Tumors","doi":"10.1109/TNS.2011.2177277","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNS.2011.2177277","venue":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science"}

Hydrol. 244(2001) 9] to study erosion processes inherent to a mechanistic soil erosion model (the Rose model) that were not addressed in earlier studies. Specifically, we investigated the impacts of ponding water depth and soil detachability on erosion. The Rose model describes the interplay among the processes of soil detachment, transport, deposition, and redetachment, which are involved in rain-induced soil erosion and sediment transport. The simple experiment that was used to improve our understanding of how water-ponding and soil detachability affect soil erosion utilized a small, horizontal, uniform, soil surface exposed to uniform, simulated rainfall. Rainfall rates were systematically changed between 6 and 48 mm h 21 . Soil detachability was associated with a clay soil prepared at two different water contents. The Rose model was applied to the experimental conditions and the predicted erosion behavior was compared to experimental measurements. Observed data compared very well with the model results. The experimentally observed relationship between ponding water depth and soil detachability agreed well with previously proposed theories; soil detachability was constant for ponding depths below a critical depth and dramatically decreased above the critical depth. Also, these experiments corroborated that the soil detachability as represented in the Rose model is independent of rain intensity. These results provide support to the validity of the Rose model with respect to the roles of surface water-ponding and its relationship to soil detachability. These mechanisms can be incorporated into models of more complicated and realistic systems in which these individual processes may be difficult to explicitly identify. q 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

This syrphid species is closely associated with ramson (Allium ursinum L.), as the larvae mine the plant's leaves. Adult abundance was determined using emergence traps (1981–1986); egg and larval abundance was determined by examining ramson leaves: puparia were extracted from soil samples (1984 and 1986). Cheilosia fasciata is a univoltine species; the imagines emerge in late April/early May. Larval development took five (1986) to six (1984) weeks. In late June/early July the larvae enter the soil for pupariation. A linear relationship was found between the area of the mines and larval biomass (dry wt.). It was concluded that one larva had to mine 51.90 cm2 of leaf area in order to gain the mean maximum dry weight (11.15 mg). Furthermore, it was shown that ovipositing females, laying just one egg per leaf, tended to select large leaves providing this minimum amount of food. It is hypothesized that females probably follow straight-lined routes on their oviposition flights, rather than ovipositing on leaves chosen at random. By applying such a strategy, females can almost completely avoid competition for food among their own offspring. Furthermore, competition among the progeny of the whole population is also reduced, particularly in years when adult abundance is very low. The significance of certain factors influencing the population dynamics of Cheilosia fasciata was evaluated by applying a rank correlation analysis. It was shown that high precipitation rates in April reduced the time available for mating and oviposition resulting in low emergence abundance in the next spring. Larval survivorship was enhanced by high precipitation rates in May and June, indicating that drought may be unfavourable to larvae and reduce food availability. Predation by a parasitoid Phygadeuon ursini Horstmann, 1986 (Hymenoptera, Ichneumonidae), appears to be just an ‘imperfect’ (Milne 1984) density-dependent control mechanism; in fact, it was shown that food limitation is the only significant mechanism of density-dependent population control.","inCitations":["2acae811562061d4781899476c2a7fbbd7cff29d","c9d32acf711114153d8fb208dcaa1d67fce1be66","c04c29a837ddcbcdfc05942c9ed7203dbe41ce35","8ba5966f4520feb43335d54393166efcab219bc0","6d1d115f746b7120ddf69e4c48107647099c13a3","485ee3374bd8df6daeea70dab7e7eb1ceff6881d"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"The population dynamics of Cheilosia fasciata (Diptera, Syrphidae): significance of environmental factors and behavioural adaptations in a phytophagous insect","doi":"10.1007/BF00379413","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/BF00379413","venue":"Oecologia"}

However, a high intensity of teacher talk and the hesitation of instructional language choice become two common problems are usually faced. Therefore, it seems important to present a variety of literature reviews to be considered by teachers which may be used as the reference to solve the problem. This study presented the concept of teacher talk at classroom interaction, monolingual and bilingual approach in EFL classroom and some previous research findings “the rationales for supporting bilingual approach” which were gained from some articles. This study suggests that teachers have to control the quantity and quality of their talk to gain an effective teaching and learning process in the EFL classroom. It is more advantageous to reduce Teacher Talk Time and increase Student Talk Time based on the students’ need because too much teacher talk will have an impact on decreased student learning motivation. When teaching EFL students, it will be helpful for overcoming cognitive difficulties if teachers insert mother tongue for the certain condition such as to translate difficult words from reading the text and to explain grammar. However, the teachers have to keep a principled and judicious use of mother tongue because a very high proportion of it also limits the students’ achievement.
