The emblematic status of those events has also created an emblematic narrative, under whose terms the Stonewall moment dispelled darkness, secrecy and silence and inspired liberation, visibility, public, political engagement. The emblematic narrative also equates language before Stonewall with secret codes, private messages, and in-group argot. This book argues that secrecy and concealment were a small part of the connections linking language and sexuality before Stonewall. And this book uses a Queer Historical Linguistics (QHL) rather than the assumptions of the emblematic narrative to examine what language and sexuality before Stonewall entailed. This chapter introduces the method and theory associated with QHL and demonstrates QHL’s usefulness for studies of language before Stonewall. QHL builds on the idea that queerness is a “mesh of possibilities” (Sedgwick in Tendencies, Duke University Press, Durham, 1993) and a messy formation (Manalansan in Radical History Review 120:94–106, 2014), and refers to practices and subject positions located “on the edges of logics of labor and production …” (Halberstam 2010). QHL depends on an assemblage of data (an archive) gathered through a scavenger methodology (Halberstam in Female Masculinity, Duke University Press, Durham, 1998), and analyzed through the work of close reading (Freeman in Time Binds: Queer Temporalities, Queer Histories, Duke University Press, Durham, 2010; Levine in Forms: Whole, Rhythm, Hierarchy, Network, Princeton University Press, Princeton, 2015), and through the framework of homohistory (Menon in Unhistorical Shakespeare: Queer Theory in Shakespearean Literature and Film, Palgrave, London, 2008). Unlike in historical studies where “meaning succeeds as replacing itself-as itself- through time” (Edelman in No Future: Queer Theory and the Death Drive, Duke University Press, Durham, 2004), QHL refuses to “…take the object of queering for granted” (Goldberg and Menon in PMLA 120(5):1608–1617, 2005). Several examples conclude the chapter to illustrate what QHL-oriented inquiry entails.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Studying a Not-so-Secret “Secret Code”","doi":"10.1007/978-3-030-33516-8_1","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-33516-8_1","venue":""}

New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2006. Pp. x, 310. $69.95. The volume is a socioeconomic and political analysis of the \"African crisis.\" It is also an attempt to define a new moral compass about how individuals relate to each other at all levels of society. The author, a professor of religious studies at Rice University, critically examines literature on various aspects of the crisis and on what he calls \"inter-subjective\" relations. He has a thorough command of the material, grounding his general points with telling day to day observations from numerous African countries as well as from Cameroon, where he was born and worked for many years. The study is divided into two distinct parts: The first half discusses power, the state, violence, the colonial legacy, and various attempts at reform. It insightfully reviews the literature on these topics while offering a relentless critique of how Africa's leaders have governed. The second half analyzes political power from a religious, theological, and humanistic perspective, calling on Africans to rebuild their \"inter-subjective bonds\" (p. 4) to overcome this situation. The author himself refers to his own writings as a \"discourse\" on the \"dialectics of agony\" (p. 6). While not ignoring its historical dimensions, Bongmba argues that Africa's current crisis is mainly the responsibility of its leaders. Using the state as their vehicle of accumulation, they have promoted their own well being at the expense of their citizens. Bongmba's focus is on the privatization of power, the \"prodigalization\" of the state, and the proliferation of violence in postindependent Africa. With vivid examples from all over the continent, and some from his own life, the author demonstrates how African leaders have developed ideologies to suit their own ends, have centralized power, eliminated competition, controlled the press, appealed to the occult, established cults of personality, and used other means effectively to dismantle formal legal institutions in their way. The result, he argues, has led ineluctably to gross mismanagement, looting, and ultimately to economic and political collapse. Bongmba also discusses the indignities and systemic undercurrent of violence that many Africans experience \"on a regular basis\" that is not always reported by the media (p. 29). He is refreshingly honest, highlighting how leaders themselves have spawned violence, inflamed ethnicities, and systematically killed their own citizens both for personal and political gain. In analyzing the many attempts at reform in Africa, Bongmba is not sanguine. Whether speaking critically about structural adjustment, privatization, or the promotion of civil society through NGOs, the author's basic point is that the \"political and managerial processes\" that characterize the African state have \"not [been] liberalized\" (p. …","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"The Dialectics of Transformation in Africa","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

The study area chosen is Saf-Saf river basin and real data were collected from 30 municipalities for reference year 2010. The results indicate that the feed-forward multilayer perceptron models with back-propagation are useful tools to define and prioritize the most effective variable on water resources mobilization and use. The model evaluation shows that the correlation coefficients are more than 94 % for training, verification, and testing data.

The effectiveness of eccentric exercise could offer new opportunities for better tailoring rehabilitation programme to patients' limitations. The goal of the study is to contrast the impact of a mixed eccentric and concentric cycling training programme, to that of conventional concentric cycling rehabilitation in patients with chronic heart failure (peak oxygen consumption (VO2Peak) < 15 mL⋅kg- 1⋅min- 1, ejection fraction <40%).\n\n\nMETHODS AND ANALYSIS\nIt is a prospective, open, controlled and randomised study (2×25 subjects) carried out in a single centre. Subjects will perform five exercise sessions per week per the randomisation outcome, with the intervention group performing eccentric in three of the five weekly sessions while the control group will perform the five sessions of concentric exercise. Cycling intensity will be the same in both groups and fixed to the power associated with the first ventilatory threshold. Self-management education programme, callisthenics sessions and muscle strength trainings will also be carried out as for any heart failure patient normally included in the rehabilitation programme. The primary outcome will be the change in distance covered during the 6 min walk test. Secondary outcomes will include other physical mobility parameters, functional exercise capacities, quality of life and body composition as well as skeletal muscle properties including mitochondrial function parameters.\n\n\nETHICS AND DISSEMINATION\nThe study has been approved by the institutional ethics review board (17.079) and the French regulatory authority for research (2017-A00969-44). Adverse events that could occur during the protocol will be reported to the principal investigator. The results will be published in an international peer-reviewed journal.\n\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER\nNCT03716778.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Effectiveness of combined eccentric and concentric exercise over traditional cardiac exercise rehabilitation programme in patients with chronic heart failure: protocol for a randomised controlled study","doi":"10.1136/bmjopen-2018-028749","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2018-028749","venue":"BMJ open"}

Optical properties of Indium Antimonide (InSb) have been investigated by means of the Kramers and Kronig method in photon energy range 1.0 – 6.01eV. The properties investigated includes: refractive index which has a maximum value of 4.91 at photon energy 1.82eV; the extinction coefficient which has a maximum value of 3.72 at photon energy 4.05eV; the dielectric constant, the real part of the complex dielectric constant, which has a maximum value of 22.3 at photon energy 1.77eV; the imaginary part of the complex dielectric constant having a maximum value of 21.3 at photon energy 3.85eV; the transmittance which has a maximum value of 0.20 at photon energy 3.61eV; the absorption coefficient which has a maximum value of 1.53 x 10 m at photon energy 4.09eV; the reflectance which has a maximum value of 0.64 at 4.17eV; the reflection coefficient which has a maximum value of 0.80 at photon energy 4.17eV; the real part of optical conductivity which has a maximum value of 9.99 x 10 at 3.89eV; and the imaginary part of the optical conductivity has a maximum value of 4.49 x 10 at 4.13eV. The values obtained for optical properties of InSb are essentially important for emerging InSb applications such as fabrication of antenna-coupled infrared detectors, photo-electric, magnet-electric conversion devices and optoelectronic devices.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"OPTICAL PROPERTIES OF INDIUM ANTIMONIDE InSb","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Limited scleroderma associated with PBC was diagnosed in the first case, a forty-seven-year-old woman. Diffuse scleroderma associated with PBC was diagnosed in the second case, a fifty-five-year-old woman. Both anti-centromere antibody and anti-mitochondrial antibody were detected in these patients. PBC may be one of the important complications in patients with SSc from the viewpoint of the prognosis even when diffuse scleroderma is diagnosed. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate anticentromere antibody and anti-mitochondrial antibody and to examine the clinical symptoms of portal hypertension when hepatic involvement is suspected in patients with SSc.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://square.umin.ac.jp/jsmbm/dvd/pdf/A069_125.pdf"],"title":"Two Cases of Sys冗mic Sclerosis with Hepatocellular Failure Due to Primary Biliary Cirrhosis","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

The carbon spheres were uniform and possessed a hierarchically micro-mesoporous structure. Mesopores were generated upon decomposition of F127 and micropores were formed upon KOH activation. The diameter of the carbon spheres was in the range of 10–25 μm, and the vermicular pore size of the carbon spheres had a range of 2.0–5.0 nm (mesopores) and 1.5–2.0 nm (micropores).

The first approach is iterative least-squares optimization, which involves the construction of the adjoint operator. The second approach is asymptotic inversion, where an approximate inverse operator is constructed in the high-frequency asymptotics. Adjoint and asymptotic inverse operators share the same kinematic properties, but their amplitudes (weighting functions) are defined differently. This paper describes a theory for reconciling the two approaches. I introduce a pair of asymptotic pseudounitary operators, which possess both the property of being adjoint and the property of being asymptotically inverse. The weighting function of the asymptotic pseudounitary stacking operators is shown to be completely defined by the derivatives of the operator kinematics. I exemplify the general theory by considering several particular examples of stacking operators. Simple numerical experiments demonstrate a noticeable gain in efficiency when the asymptotic pseudounitary operators are applied for preconditioning iterative least-squares optimization.","inCitations":["d9ea3d2fa1b07e97cfe76048b2849e34329a2e43"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.reproducibility.org/RSF/book/sep/stack/paper.pdf","http://www.beg.utexas.edu/staffinfo/fomel-pdf/stack.pdf"],"title":"Asymptotic pseudounitary stacking operators","doi":"10.1190/1.1581074","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1190/1.1581074","venue":""}

In the current paper, fixed and variable speed wind turbines and the application of energy storage system (ESS) to smoothen the wind farm output power are studied. A detailed analysis of the influence of equipping the fixed speed induction generators (FSIG) with an energy storage system on the power system's transient stability is presented. Further, a comparison is made between the wind farm with variable speed induction generators (DFIG) and wind farm with ESS-equipped FSIG to suggest the better choice of generator for the wind farm from power system transient stability point of view. The simulations are performed using PSCAD software, with a 9 bus system. It is suggested that ESS-equipped FSIG wind turbine has a better transient performance than DFIG wind turbine and would be the better choice in wind farms.","inCitations":["39d5bec3a359494ad7285bbc1cd47d2a556b802e","9cda383ee5b9ccdb7997b4604fd4922060ffde6f","0713e1752325018654802251f7232a307a91f1f0","cc98bd485cddc00d6ca7818a5315f0093e243235"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"A study on power system's transient stability in determination of the appropriate generator type for wind turbines: Comparison between fixed-speed induction generator equipped with energy storage system and doubly-fed induction generator","doi":"10.1109/EEEIC.2011.5874806","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EEEIC.2011.5874806","venue":"2011 10th International Conference on Environment and Electrical Engineering"}

We report here that coculture with the cloned stromal cell lines PA6 and ST2 can support differentiation of LyD9 cells predominantly into granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF)- and granulocyte (G)-CSF-responsive cells, respectively. However, these stromal cell lines were unable to support lymphopoiesis of LyD9 cells. The GM-CSF-dependent line, L-GM, which was derived from LyD9 cells cocultured with PA6 stromal cells, could differentiate into macrophages and granulocytes in the presence of GM-CSF. The L-GM line can further differentiate predominantly into neutrophils by coculture with ST2 stromal cells. The G-CSF-dependent line, L-G, which was derived from LyD9 cells cocultured with ST2 stromal cells, differentiated into neutrophils in response to G-CSF. Although the stromal cell-supported differentiation of LyD9 cells required the direct contact between LyD9 and stromal cells, a small fraction of LyD9 cells that were pretreated with 5-azacytidine could differentiate into neutrophils and macrophages without direct contact with stromal cells. These results indicate that different stromal cell lines support lineage-selective differentiation of the LyD9 stem cell and that 5-azacytidine treatment can bypass the requirement of direct contact with stromal cells, albeit with a lower frequency.","inCitations":["6f0ae95fab7afd556100f75dec0d49351db79027","f967ec7ecc1159a5926a7381064aec14725bd9e8","bf3b9c968f0c1dfb11476dc044309b4d28222c05","3fe0116b1be0da4410d771f41fab588f30de6c1a","93c6bfb0673f4b820f483d46535f8187cb964404","5138b6ec5ca0822f91eb951c3f413a073f1aaed1","cd06b873d3c615a3e90183d713697719f8387984","1de51a4a52dffd98a8b954706648e06663fee1cd","2f85ee6d5e50bc8929994970f3fb5af992d1de18","18d90ab4ec0f84347adcf8fe6ca29b0528c7d1c4","3069f16d669b7d04d851c35d291edc5feea2c1c5","40f3108738547a159c4a5f3d91988f773a0fc05b","3f3674f9d9f30201ea9bb24dbcef962764e49dc7"],"pdfUrls":["http://jem.rupress.org/content/jem/173/5/1257.full.pdf","http://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/pmc/ef/f8/je17351257.PMC2118856.pdf","https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/pmc/oa_pdf/ef/f8/je17351257.PMC2118856.pdf","ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/pmc/ef/f8/J_Exp_Med_1991_May_1_173(5)_1257-1266.tar.gz"],"title":"Different stromal cell lines support lineage-selective differentiation of the multipotential bone marrow stem cell clone LyD9","doi":"10.1084/jem.173.5.1257","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1084/jem.173.5.1257","venue":"The Journal of experimental medicine"}

One major challenge is obtaining the internal flow and stress field through experimentation given the lack of precise measurement techniques. Hence, this work employs DEM (discrete element method) simulations to study the internal flow patterns and behaviour of different scale batch, horizontal high shear mixers. The simulations provide a deeper understanding of the interaction of scale, impeller speed and fill level on the flow field, and show that the particle velocity is correlated with the relative swept volume in these mixers. It shows that the relative particle velocity is correlated, independent of scale, to the relative swept volume per rotation and highlights its values as a parameter for understanding and comparing mixer behaviour. The work also demonstrates the importance of the particle size chosen for the simulation as well as the tool-wall gap in the mixer, and highlights its importance as we interpret DEM results.","inCitations":["892be46a14d3ca816a3bbd3c60fb4e59a0df4aba","c2da71a7395cf38e2b1524efc906ebe959090365","f128a93d36a4e62037717d6f615cd2025802a3c0","83b7b0a31a4b8b1c4dbe332bb84bb8fad82977c8"],"pdfUrls":["http://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/94399/1/POWTEC-S-13-02226.pdf"],"title":"Dem investigation of horizontal high shear mixer flow behaviour and implications for scale-up","doi":"10.1016/j.powtec.2014.09.017","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.powtec.2014.09.017","venue":""}

A retrospective cohort study was designed in which the presence of a previous periapical lesion was determined radiographically. The quality of the root filling was evaluated in terms of homogeneity, taper, and apical extension. The response variable was dichotomized to success and failure. Bivariate analyzes and a mixed generalized linear model interpreted the association between the explanatory variables and the outcome of the initial non-surgical endodontic procedures. A total of 349 roots were evaluated, and a failure rate of 13.18% was established. Poor filling quality was determined in 8.3% of the roots. As a main result, the presence of a preoperative periapical lesion did not determine a significant risk to the failure of the initial treatment. Unlike, a poor quality of the obturation determined association with an unfavorable outcome like this: (1) homogeneity (OR 2.32; p = 0.0181); (2) taper (OR 5.8; p = 0.0); and, (3) extension (OR 3.41; p = 0.0). Therefore, a significant association between inadequate quality of the root filling and failure of the primary non-surgical endodontic procedures was found. Short length of filling was highly associated with failure. The presence of previous periapical lesion was not found to be a significant predictor for treatment outcomes.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Predicting the outcome of initial non-surgical endodontic procedures by periapical status and quality of root canal filling: a cohort study","doi":"10.1007/s10266-020-00494-z","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10266-020-00494-z","venue":"Odontology"}

S. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 25848-25855). This paper presents information on the mechanism of the enzyme from absorbance and fluorescence stopped-flow studies. The reduction of the substrate-free flavoprotein by NADH was slow and was not altered by the presence of the coupling protein. In contrast, the coupling protein has a dramatic effect in the oxidative half-reaction. The flavoprotein when present alone, both in the absence and presence of the aromatic substrate, reacts in a second-order fashion with oxygen to form oxidized flavoprotein, with no indication of flavin-oxygen intermediates. However, an intermediate identified as the C4a-flavin hydroperoxide is stabilized when the flavoprotein-coupling protein complex reacts with oxygen in the absence of the aromatic substrate, p-hydroxyphenylacetate, and at least three flavin-oxygen intermediates, attributed to the anionic (I) and protonated (I*) forms of the flavin hydroperoxide and the hydroxyflavin (III), are formed in the oxidative half-reaction in the presence of the aromatic substrate. A reaction mechanism for the two-protein complex is proposed in which the aromatic substrate has little effect on the rate of reduction of the enzyme flavin but has strict control in the oxidative half-reaction. In this phase the flavin hydroperoxide is remarkably stable in the absence of the substrate but disappears rapidly upon encountering the aromatic substrate.","inCitations":["17ab6cdf4e97b65cfa413e98ead571f21210bedc","d02117a4335f655b0146d9aed13e5e440c330897","3ddef0bef680fcb0aeda0534bcb04e4f5d2f50fa","eef48df35bd7ce1fa97773d6238ed8b1f8a60df4","a1dd570a70ea20a689c32d0f8eb6af8dc3c7eeb6","4a08b92c96baec4712708766d0e27a6df8de2383","bab04ddbb03c3980aac642ec03e373051551f95f","8909f94374edd99b0bd091da084dc189423430ff","954b16a5c27bb6cdb24ba5a03d5b2c0c375dd991","951bb3cc66e2b5e370f1888fcb4941133be3ac5f","d3d9c97e6bf7a61ba086397f41711cf55a40b79e","29d66b582fbf5aa60c1e852cab26dffc9a263297","40f0b9d959539a1cd690d9040bfd3a9901de4248","a9389ad8018b9218b41d8383a01eb4cf91cce68b","ba1b52cbf2de629e6a9c70f5063d412ffa025344","d38afeadfdd30597c1a46f0a6a30a0b4dad76f18","dc55fa02f7eaffe6ef3a41ca208010a058bbd48d"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Mechanism of p-hydroxyphenylacetate-3-hydroxylase.

A three-interval, two-alternative forced-choice procedure was used. Frequency resolution was measured with an abbreviated psychoacoustical tuning curve. Frequency discrimination was measured for (1) a fixed-frequency standard and target, (2) a fixed-frequency standard and a frequency-transition target, and (3) frequency-transition standard and a frequency-transition target. The 50-ms frequency transitions had the same final frequency as the standards, but the initial frequency was lowered to obtain about 79% discrimination performance. There was a strong relationship between poor frequency resolution and elevated pure-tone thresholds, but only a very weak relationship between poor frequency discrimination and elevated pure-tone thresholds. Several hearing-impaired listeners had normal discrimination performance together with pure-tone thresholds of 80-90 dB HL. A slight correlation was found between word recognition and frequency discrimination, but a detailed comparison of the phonetic errors and either the frequency-discrimination or frequency-resolution tasks failed to suggest any consistent interdependencies. These results are consistent with previous work that has suggested that frequency resolution and frequency discrimination are independent processes.","inCitations":["531b81dbf89aeac6d91cf884058c82f5e150b965","df0a6b263ddc76524bcde23a36d531c02dee7f12","e109ad41a594ea6e67188e35bd533e34a5d69813","91bc161e16779c1360113a4512e5caa1ea0d40bd","f9d699f14011dd164861944f46068eb485a0f3c2","139247e8d9bf1d709f079a787df34f93c9eca076","2866a597f847153866dfb51ebfa7a6b165ca16fe","90212a8ce4209b2fc97b93043c137ea71454a225","529af960b86342e3109420ff8c0f84bb273920ff","766d021f15fbaebe3ebf2b2779b0d1d5f648f638","f97f607e7321ff7c3c2a4ed2128342b6417ed32b","d75e006f97c6cb1d6069c7797da19d503ad706f0","d6ab969924b3f3f6d5eddf4dd500a9172e6f60da","065960382009a9fb85eb6bbf1238cd6add63aa0e","22df3eeefcb744582f3b077323cd10d8e823c687","556df09693d229c2e818689e6854a325b7537664","ba19266ce3eb864ca9ae0b339d1e40421d492bea","8a269ea243653caff5e5139dbbda997e66c154d0","06fe7015375b252bec7c37d1ee704fabf669f87d","51d84d99688c28bfae2aa700461a07645540d065","b4b8fb703c34a9b7adb4840da58c0a4f41203a72","33a87fb8af411cf59c340b84eca758c9971f587d","6a08b172ddebe5791bcca3002e451a90dcee8682","f16eb7e3ca7cc5d0882b95f7448553f2f4f6839f","af5196fe7ad286b4b1a264c7715c1fdfea12fad2","8cf427ed7db2d18b7fee4f809a459ff3eae65753","6d3ebc870ae14e34f58aa64af6343c36a39cd927","110aa2eb5df4aa54d24976fd16d8aca0e301364c","f9e929d3db76796a956c702d539731f1e3e8152c","4aacd3805d40e874f0df3f7ba0991de380cc5563","909abcf52cd9e5689b87df0e9d0b7d0572a848fe","622b6f99c839e68a272c0b0f160b5910d9185281","039d38fe50f6ac80dc58eda510256319ea9cb81c","60cf65b345564189d4c75f42c29baab4f68b62fe","d605765177d23f70d7c7b8052bddd2f99a08e141","46aa2aebd9823a7de60b7660016954b003f381e4","0f77857e3f5ec19b84dd46c755f142eec8362921","00e1eac2fc7a624e2da22c40b970646d62a2e3af","dd3db66e8bf317621f2423aac6bdd81bbbb493c2","eed669f3fba82be8862bf8c17535175ea7118437","cef991364dc36a6484fd61f9eeeb4cf597578e03","586fddd6708f36263e1d31b19415afa32e8f25aa","b5c05cfe26b791d1427e333fe7131c133db035fc","2432c1d1690d854d2cee14b5084e97c151d55511","2f8fdf513b9bfa5d58e0087d3365be00ebf2e55b","d83b8b1519cae53aac680459c4c1944a78f1bcc5","1607cc8e62c98d0c0b5eaf463628ab848c855e47","19b14f332aa59bb6f20464857a6a5be0e065d66f","2495697cb4fc66024d826862cf8b5cec96426b7f","a47a38886f823530dc03c37c9fe68fb565564ccd","72be2ac5f92efca320390b14048635a148c8bbda","3e45c0e694a5225a6389fc3498927a9f1d53cc0d"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Frequency resolution and discrimination of constant and dynamic tones in normal and hearing-impaired listeners.","doi":"10.1121/1.390043","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1121/1.390043","venue":"The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America"}

The incorporation of 14C from [14C]dimethylnitrosamine into chromatin was significantly higher in the P1 than the S1 fraction. The purine bases of the P1 DNA showed a lower methylation than those of the S1 DNA. In contrast, radioactivity of the proteins was higher in the P1 than the S1 fraction.

Desde el punto de vista practico puede ser considerado como un haz estrecho de luz monocromatica y coherente que puede encontrarse en el rango visible, infrarrojo o ultravioleta del espectro de las radiaciones electromagneticas. Motivados por la incorporacion de los equipos laser de produccion nacional en las salas de rehabilitacion de los policlinicos universitarios de la atencion primaria y otros centros de salud del pais, nos dimos a la tarea de realizar este trabajo, cuyo objetivo fundamental es presentar las distintas aplicaciones del laser de baja potencia en la medicina, y los equipos laser cubanos disponibles en la red nacional de salud publica. Ademas se muestran los efectos terapeuticos de la radiacion laser y los mecanismos internos para lograrlos, y se detallan ampliamente las contraindicaciones de la terapia. Este tipo de tratamiento ofrece muchas posibilidades de ayuda terapeutica y permite ser utilizado con exito en patologias de diversas especialidades. La terapia laser constituye un tratamiento de primera linea para muchas de las afecciones con que acuden los pacientes a consulta medica. The appearance and development of laser was possible thanks to the advances previously attained in other scientific disciplines in the last century. From the practical point of view, it may be considered as a narrow monochromatic and coherent beam of light that may be found in the visible infrared or ultraviolet range of the spectrum of electromagnetic radiations. Motivated by the introduction of the laser equipment of national production into the rehabilitation wards of the teaching polyclinics and other health centres of the country, we made this paper aimed at presenting the different applications of low potency laser in the medical sphere, as well as the Cuban laser equipment which are available in the national public health network. The therapeutic effects of laser radiation and the internal mechanisms to attain them are shown and the contraindications of this therapy are exposed in detail. This treatment offers many possibilities of therapeutical help and allows its successful use in pathologies of diverse specialties.

Those are widely assumed to reflect changes in body composition, with enlargement of digestive and excretory organs resulting in elevated winter BMR and larger body muscles driving the increase in Msum. Using free-living black-capped chickadees (Poecile atricapillus) as our model species, we investigated seasonal changes in body composition and tested for relationships between mass variations of body organs and variability of both BMR and Msum. Our results confirmed the expected winter increase in mass of body muscles and cardiopulmonary organs (heart + lungs) and showed that 64% of the observed Msum variations throughout the year were explained by changes in these organs. In contrast, we found little support for an effect of the digestive organs (gizzard + intestines) on BMR seasonal changes. Instead, this variable was mainly influenced by variations in mass of body muscles and excretory organs (liver + kidney), explaining up to 35% of its variability.","inCitations":["786330b18ed75bd4d5cca68d5a317ae285c46a9e","55a0672a5b3be46d60fd118684400e53e1742716","17788dc4f2707599d598df09ba6d5057e241e698","321eecbeeb031f00caf6f0ee62b2be8d00bf4189","f66c071a8c12acd624e9705bc8fc3b789f217ac9","276f11b8bce8f16fe743fe66c02d9699a8aae249","93efa4a53ba44e321d4edc928f6febfb784a37b6","2f43d34a7febe6d4659f4ff87af2da47ac9a69cf","5fee02e29d6bb98bd2a8b04134d87549d202270b","6356d8fb72eeea1d73029e1ab323cb69e9b20fa4","c0b1a7864b23afc9df82a969d7f9c8886ea54570","0b9f35cd2c53f55a3daf790f9e4ec17507e3c7cb","a3cd6fab089d075e32895b3308b59834ba0c9256","abca20b9f3e2019affa87eb0f6c9aa3f25242ce3","38ea4937ece25e96cd8ee80e54134aa27bfcbcc5","9737b3d9660ed6bcab03398f09390922ff4eb2bf","36bbf6cab0f0104f8279fd5e5da29f30a23c4e0f","08c7565dd1b0b1b918ef272ea44698d3dfa82cff","9769313f013d31c5f1fe642961bb51fac3e1b059","f3632a089801ccd8f29e0fc4fbe04daade9513e6","5a5f08c900984d721f70f589299f16b6ae1b4927","6110db39d2d8b58bce7ec3273a2e3059e14c2f77","36d540a368850174eac9dc6bf41c769de008ea56"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"How does flexibility in body composition relate to seasonal changes in metabolic performance in a small passerine wintering at northern latitude?","doi":"10.1086/676669","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1086/676669","venue":"Physiological and biochemical zoology : PBZ"}

However, enjoying the advantages of this technology, which improves society’s socio-economical safety (public safety in a broad sense), raises some privacy concerns. This article analyses European Union and national legal regulations regarding the use of unmanned aerial vehicles as well as legal tools for defence of the right to privacy or prevention from its breaches in the Republic of Lithuania. Unmanned aerial vehicles have become popular only recently; thus, legislation regarding their use has not yet become a common topic among lawyers. Furthermore, case law of the Republic of Lithuania is silent about it. Thus, the authors model a situation of breach of privacy using an unmanned aerial vehicle and analyse possible defence mechanisms.","inCitations":["c4cc9745394abec5e255979992e68b10dda72a6f"],"pdfUrls":["https://content.sciendo.com/downloadpdf/journals/bjlp/10/2/article-p107.pdf"],"title":"Regulation of Unmanned Aerial Systems and Related Privacy Issues in Lithuania","doi":"10.1515/bjlp-2017-0014","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1515/bjlp-2017-0014","venue":""}

The patients underwent swept-source optical coherence tomography (OCT) for visualization of DSM and MBMDs defined as Bruch´s membrane defects located at a distance of maximal 1500 μm from the foveola.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOut of 1983 highly myopic eyes (1057 patients), 166 eyes (8.4%; 95% confidence interval (CI):7.2%,9.6%)) showed a DSM and 534 eyes showed a MBMD. In multivariate binary regression analysis, higher prevalence of DSM was associated with a higher prevalence of a MBMD (P<0.001; OR: 1.96; 95%CI: 1.40, 2.75) after adjusting for longer axial length (P<0.001; odds ratio (OR): 1.27; 95%CI: 1.16, 1.38). In eyes with a DSM partially surrounded by a MBMD, the retina, retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and choroid appeared relatively unchanged in the central region with Bruch´s membrane (BM) preserved. In the ring-like BM-free region surrounding the central prominent island of the DSM, the RPE, the outer and middle retinal layers, the choriocapillaris and the middle-sized choroidal vessel layer were absent. In association with a DSM, three MBMD types were differentiated: MBMDs in patchy chorioretinal atrophy, MBMDs in choroidal neovascularization-related macular atrophy, and MBMDs as temporally extending large parapapillary gamma zone.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nPresence of a DSM was significantly associated with the presence of MBMDs. The morphology of the DSM in association with MBMDs may be associated with a focal relaxation of the posterior sclera, no longer pushed outward by an expanding BM but allowed to partially bulge inward, leading to the formation of a DSM.","inCitations":["0f90d637d6dd3f564b414afab0c27e5cd907e295","b5774dabe50879f9261daf8186c0bc21688b3761","f22873e03e24dce38358ee04afeb4aa00e47ef11","d902bd0c8720581006965dfa4a13330adf049400","9ee9e352641583aa90a50a0652e35a81aedd06c0","7b546f20d8bb675078ff0f78bc3a8b0fea2525bb","c4d4402d3a4be92a2791ef482e1b0f107b06c9b7","d82d8c5e72df9daee5ea811430852ec41bdcd05a"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Macular Bruch’s membrane defect and dome-shaped macula in high myopia","doi":"10.1371/journal.pone.0178998","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0178998","venue":"PloS one"}

The energy conversion processes theoretically remain unaltered as long as the fuel and oxidant feed the device. A single cell consists of two electrodes (anode and cathode), and an electrolyte, which can be a solid oxide that transports ions, thus becoming a SOFC (solid oxide fuel cell). To achieve the oxide-ion conductivity necessary to ensure high enough power density, these fuel cells require high and/or intermediate temperatures (over 500 °C).The fuel conversion efficiency of conventional SOFCs is usually about 50%. Thus, much of the chemical energy converts into waste heat energy, whereas thermoelectric materials can generate electricity from the waste heat. Some studies have been published in which the cathode of the fuel cell has been replaced by a thermoelectric material, and different simulation studies have been performed in which the waste heat is harnessed by thermoelectrics in a heat exchanger. The aim of this work is to provide an overview of thermoelectric materials that could help to select the best one to harness the heat evolved by a SOFC device to increase its efficiency. Data has been collected for different thermoelectric materials, including their thermoelectric performance, operation temperature range, and cost. To choose a thermoelectric material, it is necessary to define a performance parameter that allows us to classify all the different materials by means of their performance. Among the best, operating temperature and cost will turn into constraints that must be met to find the best material that suits the characteristics of a SOFC operation environment, and that really can be used in combination with the fuel cell.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Selection of Thermoelectric Materials to Improve the Efficiency of SOFC Devices Through Cogeneration","doi":"10.1016/j.matpr.2015.05.111","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.matpr.2015.05.111","venue":""}

The SGL-depleted Sarcocystis extract (SGTF) contained the so-called Sarcotoxin, inducing only a slight increase in MNC proliferation. Furthermore, preincubation of MNC with SGTF for 60 min suppressed the mitogenic capacity of SGL by 60%-90%. The results presented indicate that SGTF interacts with human MNC differently than SGL, particularly by interfering with the mitogenic lectin. These findings suggest that SGL and SGTF may be involved in different immunomechanisms induced by the parasite.","inCitations":["2f4a651f7b52ff03a655080a4b1e21c1df74c2de","ef17a9395506b23d766065207dc5265b68f286ec"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Interactions between Sarcocystis gigantea lectin and toxin-containing fractions in human lymphocyte cultures.","doi":"","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"Parasitology research"}
