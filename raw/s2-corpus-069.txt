In this study, we explore this question by synthesizing and testing an analogue (DS-27) that binds to D2 receptors with higher affinity than haloperidol, but cannot form quaternary metabolites. This study suggests that D2 affinity may be the primary underlying mechanism for acute catalepsy induction by haloperidol.","inCitations":["54c40fda85e7a3abdd4284a2d95aa48a53558fd5","012b38385f10936be3079b0ca8e4c62675912a19"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"The acute EPS of haloperidol may be unrelated to its metabolic transformation to BCPP+.","doi":"10.1016/j.bmcl.2003.07.015","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bmcl.2003.07.015","venue":"Bioorganic & medicinal chemistry letters"}

The invasive pest Tuta absoluta (Meyrick 1917), after taking just a decade (2008–2017) to invade the entire Africa continent, is now continuing its expansion in Asia. From its first detection in Turkey (2009), the pest has extended its range of invasion at a very high speed of progression to the southeast part of Asia. This study adopted the cellular automata modelling method used to successfully predict the spatiotemporal invasion of T. absoluta in Africa to find out if the invasive pest is propagating with a similar pattern of spread in Asia. Using land cover vegetation, temperature, relative humidity and the natural flight ability of Tuta absoluta, we simulated the spread pattern considering Turkey as the initial point in Asia. The model revealed that it would take about 20 years for the pest to reach the southeast part of Asia, unlike real life where it took just about 10 years (2009–2018). This can be explained by international crop trade, especially in tomatoes, and movement of people, suggesting that recommendations and advice from the previous invasion in Europe and Africa were not implemented or not seriously taken into account. Moreover, some countries like Taiwan and the Philippines with suitable environmental condition for the establishment of T. absoluta are not at risk of natural invasion by flight, but quarantine measure must be put in place to avoid invasion by crop transportation or people movement. The results can assist policy makers to better understand the different mechanisms of invasion of T. absoluta in Asia, and therefore adjust or adapt control measures that fit well with the dynamic of the invasive pest observed.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tind-customer-wvc/ba781a94-2af6-4a33-8ef8-7f94e254596f?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=AKIAIYBMA2Z5A5KICN6A/20200506/eu-west-1/s3/aws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20200506T041644Z&X-Amz-Expires=86400&X-Amz-Signature=76f0df9318fb663ccf95162779e0c4314ccf7988d8d99b2cf400887ed2b6fca0&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&response-content-disposition=attachment%3B+filename*%3DUTF-8''e14578.pdf&response-content-type=application/pdf"],"title":"Exploring the Mechanisms of the Spatiotemporal Invasion of Tuta absoluta in Asia","doi":"10.3390/agriculture10040124","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.3390/agriculture10040124","venue":""}

However, epiphora (excessive tear secretion) may occur after the successful transfer of whole submandibular gland because tear secretion level is closely related to the size of the transferred gland. The aim of this study was to investigate the microanatomy of SMG to explore the possibility of partial SMG transfer to prevent postoperative epiphora.\n\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nSixty intact and histologically normal human SMGs from patients with benign tumor of the mandible who underwent vascularized mandibular reconstruction and removal of the SMG for anastomosis of the blood vessels were included in the study. SMGs were perfused with methacrylate to form resin casts of blood vessels and ducts. The length and diameter of the blood vessels and ducts in the casts were measured using a sliding caliper. The numbers of lobules, distribution of arteries, veins, and ducts, as well as the relationship among them, were analyzed.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe resin cast of the gland showed a treelike structure, with the vessels gradually dividing into multiple branches. The arteries, veins, and ducts run in parallel and were roughly divided into 3 levels: from the stem extending into the main branches (level I), into the narrower secondary branches (level II), and then the secondary branches subsequently divided into terminal branches (level III). The structures of the blood vessels and ducts were similar at each level in the lobules. In the vein casts, communicating vessels were found between the anterior facial vein and the concomitant vein of the facial artery.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe characteristic treelike structure of the SMG vascular and ductal system may provide useful information for partial gland transfers.","inCitations":["e13c475517a7f83b5ff4d00450c41f561507af58","f9fee974c53620f038efb203ad5a7e5f0856b8aa","a56907d340b7aa4f5a9cfa99c089b61127b4aaf4"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Microanatomic study of the vascular and duct system of the submandibular gland.","doi":"10.1016/j.joms.2010.03.006","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.joms.2010.03.006","venue":"Journal of oral and maxillofacial surgery : official journal of the American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons"}

Although evidence for its usefulness has been demonstrated in experimental study designs, data supporting OSATS application in the operating room are limited. This study evaluates the validity and reliability of the OSATS instrument to assess the operative skills of surgery residents in the operating theater.\n\n\nMETHODS\nTwenty-four residents were recruited from seven hospitals within a general surgical training region and classified equally into three groups according to postgraduate training year (PGY). Each resident had to perform five different types of operations. Surgical performance was measured using a modified OSATS consisting of three scales: Global Rating Scale, Overall Performance Scale, and Alphabetic Summary Scale. Validity and reliability metrics included construct validity (Kruskal-Wallis test) and internal consistency reliability (Cronbach's α coefficient). Spearman's correlation coefficients were calculated to determine correlations between the different scales.\n\n\nRESULTS\nEighteen residents (PGY 1-2 [n = 7]; PGY 3-4 [n = 8]; PGY 5-6 [n = 3]) performed 249 operations. Comparisons of the performance scores revealed that evidence for construct validity depended on the difficulty level of the selected procedures. For individual operations, internal consistency reliability of the Global Rating Scale ranged from 0.93 to 0.95. Scores on the different scales correlated strongly (r = 0.62-0.76, P < .001).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nAssessment of operative skills in the operating theater using this modified OSATS instrument has the potential to establish learning curves, allowing adequate monitoring of residents' progress in achieving operative competence. The Alphabetic Summary Scale seems to be of additional value. Use of the Overall Performance Scale should be reconsidered.","inCitations":["3d90f3699fdd8658cbce3a201c845d7de8fd7473","5c15b5e008bd1e0bd2dd966fa5418883a3834941","a82b23d741f44098fa20f0ba034d616537050a88","1ddddff8fa7b81030b86ca65f9a9a9d2e25fa981","d197012cc13914bc7832dccec12e222aa3876f58","383c4f8e60bd390ab639eec833637b5d1ad8006c","c7a9b1daf24d3566bd5b07e043a27aad864f7b11","53a7bda48142c558e0a5f46e103f45086d0ef655","a87466f95100b01947126ca99851cd3d34b365da","4d4a2a2780fdc2883e32ce02d3c9f9bc3db2433a","305ff792d51409df45e6f3b9aa5255f98fbe84d5","ed6967775d4240f49076341b35e572b84a0334b4","c4aeab5149928c8df13490e50a1f0444d53406b3","f2ecd780732b954be9dc150d0ffc03bff3d49903","b19829ba7a3e6113378aab9d2ca4492bf4c3ce19","bea8970b7680ee0157db873dc9c526e88c22fd03","b5b9d38b937278d9b2fa393a2cc02e041e04973d","6f06459311f43088e3466dcda3b92c587c87f274","9bca20c6e7fe281c1ec3f0b46c7928ac9412d270","f0d1884ecc335a32e3af955f63e75b8ca171c99b","8334e1ea06df6b7183bc057c1693860eaf64c70f","7849771f3547021a32aadee456af0f66f278c746","0e8ba781dd8696c3d0850091bae035e00be6b6ce","12936e7987be311edb7047602a7b7c5407efc05d","0e83c890e8eaa081de01f67a77ff385dfedef6ff","bb5c1257f14ad85394173830ced0e4664dba10cc","ec20307a01c5ce0f3230b403ce01af04b8895215","11a900cea25bbbe6fa367f157f1749cb341a401f","9ac5064276a8dc0c3fa881097df12ed61bb9b60b","072e177a7d63db1d2428c2272fe77f6da0a45901"],"pdfUrls":["https://case.edu/medicine/uhsurgery/media/school-of-medicine/uh-surgery/documents/pdfs/journal-club-articles/2014/november/Updated_November_2014(4).pdf"],"title":"Assessment of surgery residents' operative skills in the operating theater using a modified Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skills (OSATS): a prospective multicenter study.","doi":"10.1016/j.surg.2014.04.052","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.surg.2014.04.052","venue":"Surgery"}

A primary goal of VSO/ALP is to enhance security, governance, and development, and link local villages to the Government of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan (GIRoA) via the districts and provinces. The ALP program was designed to provide protection and stability in villages/areas where the Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF) were insufficiently strong to prevent armed insurgent infiltration and activities. The ALP initiative is considered by the Coalition as a cornerstone of a successful COIN strategy. The MoI had approved 99 districts for ALP units as of April 2012. Of these, 59 districts had completed the required MoI validation process, which includes approval by both village elders/shura and Coalition partners, for a force of 12,900 ALP. The Coalition Forces Special Operations Component Command-Afghanistan (CFSOCC-A), International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) Joint Command (IJC), and NATO Training Mission-Afghanistan/Combined Security Transition Command-Afghanistan (NTM-A/CSTC-A), in coordination with the Ministry of Interior (MoI) and Afghan National Police (ANP), have committed to the development of an ALP force. This entails significant shared responsibilities and capabilities on the part of the Coalition forces. CFSOCC-A is the Executive Agent responsible for planning and execution of the ALP program. IJC is responsible for coordination with CFSOCC-A and general support of the program and the ALP units operating in IJC battle space. NTM-A/CSTC-A has the responsibility for managing the use of U.S.C. Title 10 fiscal resources for equipping the ALP, and for building the capacity of the MoI in support of the ANP and ALP. ISAF has the overarching responsibility to plan, direct, and integrate the contributions of these three commands in support of ALP development.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Assessment of U.S. Government and Coalition Efforts to Develop the Afghan Local Police","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Cependant, les populations de Dipteres necrophages (mouches) susceptibles de coloniser un corps varient au fil des saisons. A ces variations saisonnieres se superposent des variations a court terme, principalement liees au climat et au rythme nycthemeral. Afin de quantifier ces differentes variations, nous avons suivi par piegeage durant plusieurs mois l’evolution des populations de Dipteres necrophages du nord de la France. Nos resultats indiquent que les populations de Dipteres necrophages sont suffisantes pour coloniser un corps meme durant les periodes froides, bien que leur nombre diminue considerablement. Conformement a la litterature, les mouches bleues (Calliphora spp.) etaient les plus actives en hiver, a l’inverse des mouches vertes (Lucilia spp.), dominantes durant l’ete. Outre les effets saisonniers (variations sur une periode de plusieurs mois), la temperature ambiante mais surtout l’insolation ont confirme leur role determinant sur l’activite ponctuelle des insectes. Ces conclusions sont particulierement importantes dans le cadre de l’entomologie medico-legale, et confirment l’importance de l’analyse detaillee de l’entomofaune necrophage et des conditions climatiques a court et long terme lors de la datation du deces.","inCitations":["244379d69ac1d0c9f188a27645de6bbaeb16fd98","52921b54d07e711b0b85b8e01b47ffa56cb40cea","ac99c177dc5929ca4656c63d3373aaa82f50d9b5","fc8a351cbd3ad8da610669676dbddfb6cecf5656"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Que font les mouches en hiver ?

This process involved the participation of multiple local investigators, in conjunction with collaborations at the regional (Latin American) and international levels. The discoveries have been integrated with parallel investigations from other research groups worldwide and, have provided a body of knowledge to unravel how the free radical nitric oxide (•NO) can shift its signal transduction action towards oxidative processes via its interactions with superoxide radical (O2•-) to yield peroxynitrite, a strong biological oxidant. The oxidative biochemistry of peroxynitrite involves both direct reactions and the formation of secondary oxidizing species (i.e. hydroxyl radicals (•OH), carbonate radicals (CO3•-) and nitrogen dioxide (•NO2)) that cause oxidative modifications of biomolecules, including thiol oxidation and tyrosine nitration. Due to the intrinsic instability of peroxynitrite in biological systems, its half-life and fate are largely dictated by its reaction kinetics with biotargets. The direct actions of •NO and peroxynitrite in the modulation of intracellular redox processes are disparate, with peroxynitrite typically causing permanent modifications of cellular components and resulting in severe alterations of cell and mitochondrial homeostasis. Herein, I highlight the evolution and progression of •NO and peroxynitrite research in Uruguay during over 25 years of work, emphasizing hypothesis- and mechanistic-oriented biochemical studies and their translation to medically-relevant conditions.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"The origins of nitric oxide and peroxynitrite research in Uruguay: 25 years of contributions to the biochemical and biomedical sciences.","doi":"10.1016/j.niox.2019.03.003","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.niox.2019.03.003","venue":"Nitric oxide : biology and chemistry"}

It highlights the distortions generated by the creation of traditional special savings and tax circuits and public mortgage market programs. Empirical evidence on mortgage subsidy reform in nine countries is provided which have reformed their systems in the context of fiscal, financial sector and housing sector reform. The paper concludes that mortgage subsidy reform must be long-term and closely integrated with general financial sector, housing sector and fiscal reform to have success. With regard to the extent of mortgage market subsidies seen in emerging markets, reform programs should prioritize subsidy reduction before restructuring the subsidy portfolio. This argument is based on two insights: an optimal sequencing of mortgage market reforms requires the development of a financial and technological benchmark which is hampered by the presence of subsidies, and mortgage market subsidies are generally inappropriate instruments to attack the fundamental distribution inequalities exerted by lack of access to formal homeownership. Under these conditions, is there a rationale for introducing subsidies for threshold mortgagors in developing countries? The paper argues that if appropriately targeted, linked to household savings downpayment, and sunsetted, subsidies can promote mortgage market efficiency and stability and facilitate housing finance reform. However, basic housing subsidies coupled with appropriate urban land and infrastructure policies should be a priority in markets with very unequal income distributions or high formal-informal housing market barriers.","inCitations":["21dfc930f79692f628669619fd9e677fdec6c7ef","cc2419d2d84ce4925a8399e6cc671a43acc6c894","b43b7f00da6c8506064dbd8c494a0326c36ba5be","571ef8806c847150f30e4c798b04893f546fdf4c"],"pdfUrls":["http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/683901468781195586/pdf/261750urbanbackground14.pdf"],"title":"Separating homeownership subsidies from finance : traditional mortgage market policies, recent reform experiences and lessons for subsidy reform","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Perseverations are defined as \"situation (s) where elements from previous tasks or behaviors disrupt or fuse with ongoing activity, or when a behavior or operation cannot be terminated\" (Barr et al 1989). During problem-solving tasks, patients with schizophrenia are observed to perform similarly to patients with frontal lobe pathology, producing a high number of perseverative responses; however, traditional methods of assessing perseverations, such as the method used when scoring the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST), are limited to quantifying perseverative responses without considering qualitative features of performance. This study qualitatively examines verbal perseverations that occur in the context of problem-solving. Eighty-six patients diagnosed with schizophrenia were administered the Rorschach test, and their responses were recorded verbatim. In addition to scoring their protocols for thought disturbance, a modification of Barr et al' s (1989) classification of perseverations was recorded. Significant relationships between perseverations and demographic, symptom, and cognitive measures will be examined. Finally, the qualitative analysis of perseverative responses combined with other neuropsychological and clinical data will be used to identify differences among schizophrenia patients.","inCitations":["f162ec964a7ef6571c8ba4a95127c1a4f243745a"],"pdfUrls":["https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/000632239594561A","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/000632239594561A?dgcid=api_sd_search-api-endpoint"],"title":"A qualitative assessment of perseverative responses of schizophrenia patients","doi":"10.1016/0006-3223(95)94561-A","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/0006-3223%2895%2994561-A","venue":"Biological Psychiatry"}

This can cause a stenosis or complete occlusion. Thromboembolic events are thought to be the cause of infarction in the majority of cases of stroke, rather than haemodynamic insufficiency, in patients with carotid dissection. Although traditionally thought to be most commonly caused by head or neck trauma, spontaneous carotid dissection is now an increasingly recognised cause of stroke in young patients.

Steady-state kinetic parameters provide evidence that this enzyme follows a ping-pong mechanism. Proton inventory was consistent with a single-proton transfer, and pH studies suggested the participation of at least one residue with a pKa value of 6.4-6.6, possibly a His or Asp/Glu in catalysis. Protein sequence alignments indicate that this enzyme belongs to the alpha/beta-hydrolase fold superfamily of enzymes, indicating the involvement of an active-site nucleophile and possibly a canonical catalytic triad. We constructed site-specific mutants and identified Ser163, Asp403, and His432 as the likely active-site residues of a catalytic triad based on steady-state kinetics and genetic complementation of a yeast null mutant. Moreover, unlike the wild-type enzyme, inactive site mutants were not capable of producing an acetyl-enzyme intermediate. Homoserine transacetylase therefore catalyzes the acetylation of L-homoserine via a covalent acyl-enzyme intermediate through an active-site Ser. These results form the basis of future exploitation of this enzyme as an antimicrobial target.","inCitations":["b7322f92b39df13fd466d97deb4997f6b1716f7b","a6db472612a54a108dc04bd96837d064ca7752d6","d70f76d58be5d7e7cd91dadbb0e99d61e342863e","aab26337b221d9ef638832950a8872324efcfdb7","23d95e298ababa5a6b4cac454e41727209cd09fb","68442140f41d6ea56a2435aafd78672e4cddcfe9","488e9084fe45118343ed5510fb934d5534add1c2","19b4701e83fc3a89cbfcdb02ec3dc7fd118fd4a7","bbdb4fd74b8e68bd47bce107393d411879d7d8e9","3cfeb042a97ad1114094783d955b7b9aaca0f42a","3aa8802dcd91b1192dc2dbfdc6932431714bda6f"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Catalytic mechanism of fungal homoserine transacetylase.","doi":"10.1021/bi0514764","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1021/bi0514764","venue":"Biochemistry"}

Extinction occurred during double simultaneous stimulation within the same visual hemi-field (VHF). This finding suggests that interhemispheric rivalry is not a critical factor. During double simultaneous stimulation within the same VHF as well as with stimuli in different VHFs, the severity of extinction was determined by both the retinotopic and the hemi-spatial position of the extinguished stimulus. The location of the other stimulus, however, did not seem relevant. It is proposed that damage to a corticolimbic-reticular system reduces attentional capacity and that extinction during double simultaneous stimulation in the visual modality reflects an inability to distribute the limited attentional resources equally to two different locations. The severity of extinction is a measure of an unequal distribution of attention along a gradient within visual space.","inCitations":["fd7e89a18da05ab30161678b4fdde0a46670e73c","66c957cbc9929b2c701a1accc113dc13a24a5b9c","7b10aa73ef35dbffd292788780ea41ce3962b8e8","0b8d850bc9b880c063a47447d217a77746708e67","31716091addd656f517d7ca0e0a00236cb6bdad6","52441a6bfecfc5e7f42356f8c9007267bb3765f3","8059b386719c65b6f38e1c600de9785723fd6cb0","1f10b816a815bf797bb59d01e5cadfd5986365a9","a27dc8b074db1dc795c78f0350615c19140f0310","3f372d431baac1ef769372271a808b13fd12a41a","540efbd320025153dd5977157ba581cf0d3af9a2","128683988e1332415fdf0472e498bc6059d5db9c","4cc26791250355f39b214ef67d3bc9b73406d0a2","e6da24483d61fad2d7e759cf2173f84d01c0f6d1","92cd48be0a288bcccc536f2d68f8f645c535e3b4","c982eada7d659dd4660480271972e4f865f5f528","2b0323b28dd96f0b068ade8079168ca3b210fa78","78e9a58fdf66f8e21b4ec666d87f944974ca93b6","d6c4429e5ced44a3cad9ba8e409944198b4a34d4","a814a25227da4bbbf7038e564d99b6e0a1277cec","93d4668310e8c217192515c07e8179ef0c7f6b5a","9c27236acd931d62af689bddb7801b5869710fc6","062c70ba01fb6346d8dec78a9522ef3adc509d1f","4c80b0e2fc332cda898f28791d58a3dcac1ccd20"],"pdfUrls":["http://jnnp.bmj.com/content/jnnp/50/9/1117.full.pdf"],"title":"Hemispace-visual field interactions in visual extinction.","doi":"10.1136/jnnp.50.9.1117","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1136/jnnp.50.9.1117","venue":"Journal of neurology, neurosurgery, and psychiatry"}

The particle surface is formed by a protein helix (22 %), in case of LDL apoprotein B-100 (MW 500 kD) which is recognized by specific receptors located on the surface of liver cells and other tissue cells whereas vascular cells contain only very few LDL receptors. This leads to receptor binding of LDL followed by cellular uptake and lysosomal degradation of about 2/3 of LDL particles thereby maintaining cholesterol homeostasis1. Reduced numbers or reduced activity of LDL receptors cause elevated plasma cholesterol levels that are associated with progression of atherosclerosis. Localized endothelial damage promotes increased uptake (not yet proven to be LDL-receptor-mediated) and degradation of LDL by vascular smooth-muscle cells and macrophage foam cells of the intima. These are the earliest detectable events that can develop into an atherosclerotic plaque2, 3. Thus high interest is evident in radiolabeled LDL as tracer and receptor ligand to study these processes.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Lipoprotein Labeling and Analysis Techniques","doi":"10.1007/978-1-4615-2462-5_32","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4615-2462-5_32","venue":""}

Because this parasite presents high genetic variability, a nomenclature has been adopted to classify the parasite into six discrete typing units (DTUs): TcI, TcII, TcIII, TcIV, TcV, and TcVI, which present different eco-epidemiological, clinical, and geographic associations. Currently, the available genotyping methods present a series of drawbacks that implies the need for developing new methods for characterizing T. cruzi DTU’s. The aim of this work was to genotype reference populations from T. cruzi by means of a High-Resolution Melting (HRM) genotyping assay.To genotype the DTUs of 38 strains and 14 reference clones of T. cruzi from diverse sources, real-time PCR (qPCR) was coupled to high-resolution melting (HRM) based on the amplification of two molecular markers—the divergent domain of the 24 sα rRNA gene and the intergenic region of the mini-exon gene.FindingsAmplification of the mini-exon gene allowed the genotyping of three distinct groups: TcI, TcII- TcIV- TcV, and TcIII-TcVI, while amplification of the 24sα gene generated non-overlapping melting temperature ranges for each DTU that were used to identify the groups in the six existing DTUs of Trypanosoma cruzi.ConclusionsThe proposed genotyping assay allowed discrimination of the six genetic groups by obtaining specific melting curves for each DTU. The application of this technique is proposed because of its specificity, sensitivity, high performance, and low cost compared with other previously described characterization methods.","inCitations":["5bb08224d15277714c8b5bf7686815846b8be18a","b58f5f3fed821bd1e3e55611ebac48f1fd4a56e5","e3f7d1910c08ef9110e96bb3dd30755c1a193579","3d591cd60c98b148408720967c2a5d5707300a36","82a5c86fe385eb2fd07a2d15d0a628f2eb1e5718","c10e82b36b79c6387e59328ea35b4ed13924781f","d68d1bfba2590d8d7635596bfb6db95a3924153f","ead85fe2b9421bd9cbabdffc185fa7d9a6d680a1","506dd05212a91f3ac709714f5ee666d1b9e05be2","1442ee9cb7377e41081cc9d19928f637d052fcc5","91687fbda48442ce3e78f01496ce6894441d8eb8","233fd35cfd0620f4fe0003772e0d9aa3d4de943c","d4414fdfcdcb2afa54d04ffbe423bb3322fc6f14","79d14b4c8daf3813a004e81abc79b0a420d158fe","45ea871829b8fff6aac1fc3c5380c9afb663cc70","671faa05575f5ad4bd2961052becd6a24b02961f","f514e61ff65e98133bfe283ea4d0034a4ff12b6b","3d4200199c1fb95409d3e4b23f4fafccc5f4dcd1","07abe956661096fd8403f44ca6f213baeaf64574"],"pdfUrls":["http://download-redirector.springer.com/redirect?contentType=pdf&ddsId=art:10.1186/1756-3305-6-112&originUrl=http://parasitesandvectors.biomedcentral.com/article/10.1186/1756-3305-6-112"],"title":"Identification of Trypanosoma cruzi Discrete Typing Units (DTUs) through the implementation of a High-Resolution Melting (HRM) genotyping assay","doi":"10.1186/1756-3305-6-112","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1756-3305-6-112","venue":"Parasites & Vectors"}

In this paper, a kind of smart poly (vinyl alcohol) (PVA) hydrogel is obtained using 4, 4′-azodibenzoic acid as cross-link agent. The hydrogels have the ability of swelling and shrinking reversibly under irradiation by ultraviolet or visible light because azobenzene groups show trans–cis isomerization under suitable light wavenumber. Under UV irradiation, azobenzene takes the cis structure which leads to volume decreases; macroscopically, shrinking can be observed. Under visible light irradiation, the volume recovers, and swelling can be observed macroscopically. Hydrogels have excellent swelling/shrinking recovery properties even after 12 cycles. The procedure achieves loop control of the transformation from light energy to mechanical energy.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Light-induced water swelling/shrinking recovery of hydrogels based on chemically cross-linked poly (vinyl alcohol)","doi":"10.1007/s00396-014-3173-4","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00396-014-3173-4","venue":"Colloid and Polymer Science"}

Children particularly newborns, surfer from the variety of disease conditions than do adults and may require different medicines. Antibiotics play a key role in treating infectious diseases which are the major cause of morbidity and mortality in the developing world. In trying to address accessibility of Essential Medicines, the WHO releases Essential Medicine List for children, after every two years and each country is required to adopt such a new list. In Tanzania, a separate list of essential medicines for children has not yet adopted. Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI) is used as the integrated approach strategy to improve child health. The main objective of this study was to assess the availability, price and affordability of paediatric essential antibiotics in Mbeya Region. This was a cross-sectional survey in accordance with WHO/HAI methodology to assess the availability, affordability and price of essential antibiotics for children in Mbeya Region. Data were collected from 1 Medical store Department (Mbeya zonal office), 8 public hospitals, 30 Private Pharmacies and 30 Accredited Drug Dispensing Outlets. Median price of these medicines was compared with Management Science for Health reference prices, expressed as median price ratios. Average stock out days per year was assessed using a designed form. The salary of the lowest–paid unskilled government worker and National Poverty Line income were used to assess affordability of paediatric essential antibiotics. The median availability of the lowest-price generics for paediatrics essential antibiotics at the Pharmacies, ADDO‟s and Public Hospitals was found to be 59.09%, 62.5%, and 45.5% antibiotics respectively. At the Zonal Medical stores department, only 13 out of the 22 antibiotics were in stock at the time of survey. The survey found that the median stock out days was 124 days per year. The median of Median Price Ratios of retail patient‟s prices for 20 generics antibiotics were 1.774 for 30 pharmacies. Also the median MPRs of 8 generic antibiotics were 2.0097 for 30 ADDO‟s. National Health Insurance Funds patient prices were 177.74% higher than public hospitals procurement price. Essential medicine such as Amoxicillin-Clavulanic acid syrup was absent in most of public hospitals and also not affordable at the pharmacies for unskilled government workers in Mbeya. The survey reveals poor availability of paediatric essential antibiotics in the public sector. The stock-out days of the medicines is still high in Mbeya Region. In most of private medicine outlets some of medicines prices were at higher prices and may not be affordable for majority of the population. Therefore the availability, price and affordability of antibiotics for paediatrics should be improved in order to ensure equity in access for basic treatment option of infections in children. Through adopting health financing approach at the public hospitals, consideration of other alternative strategies for control measures of medicines prices and drug subsidation for basic essential antibiotics in the private sectors will make these commodities readily available and affordable by the majority of the people.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Evaluation of Availability and Cost of Essential Antibiotics for Paediatrics in Mbeya, Tanzania","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Cognitive Radio (CR) is considered a viable means to vastly improve the efficiency of spectrum since it allows unlicensed users access to licenced spectrum as long as the quality of service is not downgraded. \n \nThis research investigates the major problems associated with designing CRs. An in-depth analysis shows that the two major problems that hinders the successful design of CR systems are that of spectrum sensing (How the device detects the Primary User (PU)) and Power Control (which focuses on the level of transmit power of CR devices so as not to induce interference to PUs). \n \nTo solve the problem of power control in this research, we consider a single cell scenario where N CR terminals are operating in a network with a Cognitive base station (CBS) together with one PU along with its Primary Base station (PBS). In the scenario, CR devices will generally seek to improve quality of service by increasing it’s transmit power. This increase introduces interference to the PU. To mitigate this, the CR devices are modelled as players of a non-cooperative game where offending devices are penalised till a Nash equilibrium level is achieved. At this point, the players can no longer influence the state of the game no matter the strategy they chose to play. The work is extended to cover CR internet of things devices by exploiting the adequate path loss exponent for the operational environment. The power control algorithm is compared with two other known power control algorithms and it outperforms them in average power, average SNR and rate of convergence. \n \nSpectrum sensing in CRs has been shown in literature to improve when done cooperatively rather than individually. To this end, this research focuses on cooperative sensing which allows the radios to make decision on their channel state based on the combine results of individual radios. The channel is modelled as a frame- by frame structure of equal length using the slotted aloha access contention technique. Each frame has a fixed length and is made up of sensing, prediction and transmission periods. It is seen observed that longer sensing periods results in better sensing results but considerable lower throughput. The scenario researched involves a CR network with K CRs and M sub-channels. It is assumed that the conditions of all sub-channels are equal, and each CR randomly chooses any one to sense and the throughput is measured. The interference caused to the PU are measured by collisions in the system. This are of two types: (1) Collisions with PUs due to missed detections and (2) collisions with other CRs due to access contention. Whenever there is a collision, the packet is withheld by the system and transmission is stopped. The throughput is a measure of successful packet transmissions. The derived algorithm improved the throughput by detecting the optimal sensing period. Using the K-of-M fusion decision rule, the sensing algorithm guarantees that optimal throughput can be achieved when 50% of the cognitive radio correctly detects the state of the spectrum. \n \nCognitive radio throughput will be of very grave importance.

These have reduced accuracy in coastal zone (within ~50 km from land) and do not provide wet path delay over land. The addition of high frequency channels to Jason-class radiometer will improve retrievals in coastal regions and enable retrievals over land. High-frequency window channels, 90, 130 and 166 GHz are optimum for improving performance in coastal region and channels on 183 GHz water vapor line are ideal for over-land retrievals. We have developed MMIC LNAs that had more than 50% lower noise temperature (NT=300K) than previous state-of-art. The MMIC LNAs enabled us to develop internally calibrated direct detect radiometer testbeds at the required observation frequencies. Our current 166 GHz radiometer testbed system has a noise temperature of 455 K, bandwidth of 10% and operates with 60 mW of DC power.

Although there is no Federal social insurance program to protect against this risk, the majority of workers are nevertheless protected through State programs, industry programs, or private sector programs. Five States (California, Hawaii, New Jersey, New York, and Rhode Island), Puerto Rico, and the railroad industry have Temporary Disability Insurance (TDI) laws requiring employers to cover their workers under a plan that pays a benefit replacing about half the worker’s wage. Many other workers are able to obtain protection through plans offered by their employers. Employers offer their employees sick-leave plans or sickness insurance as a fringe benefit or as part of a labor-management collective bargaining agreement. In 1979, about 56 million American workers were covered under TDI or voluntary plans that provided cash benefits to replace earnings when they were sick. Workers so covered comprised more than three-fifths of all workers. They received a total of $13.4 billion in benefits. Total estimated earnings loss in 1979 from sickness was $36.0 billion. Total sickness benefits paid as a percent of income loss in 1979 was 37 percent. This rate represented a slight rise over the 36 percent reported for 1978. The income loss estimate encompasses short-term disability of the institutionalized population and their first 6 months of long-term disability. In this note, the definition of income lost due to nonwork-connected disability is limited to losses in the selfemployment and wage and salary earnings during the first 6 months of disability. To help estimate income lost through sickness, the Social Security Administration has developed a sickness index which is compiled each year. The index is applied to the annual average number of work-loss days used in estimating the value of income loss.

It is an essential part of abdominal aesthetics, making umbilicoplasty critical for the success of abdominoplasty. The position and natural contour are the two important factors that are most relevant in evaluating the aesthetic result of the umbilical scar. Classifications and standards are important tools to improve the diagnosis and refine the treatment of abdomen aesthetic disorders. Furthermore, it has facilitated appropriate reproduction of the procedure and served as a basis for comparative studies. Objectives: This study presents the authors experience with procedure standardization for repositioning and re-implantation of the umbilical scar in abdominoplasty group IV cases. The study demonstrates the navel vertical relocation technique, along with details of the new position, and assesses the quality of results obtained and the degree of patient satisfaction. Case studies and methods: Twenty female patients underwent the procedure between May 2010 and May 2012. The minimum follow-up period was thirty days and the maximum follow-up period was two years. Results: Most results were considered excellent, with a high level of patient satisfaction and no major complications. There was no need for re-intervention. The technique was shown to be safe, simple and easy to perform. Conclusion: The marking and surgical planning, with a proposed maximum end limit for repositioning of the umbilical scar, can be valuable both in aiding the most complex diagnoses of aesthetic abdomen defect types and evaluating the technical aspects of abdominoplasty that are most appropriate for treatment. Introducao: O umbigo e a unica cicatriz natural visivel do corpo. E parte essencial da estetica abdominal, fato que torna a umbilicoplastia fundamental no sucesso da abdominoplastia. A posicao e a naturalidade de contorno sao os dois fatores mais relevantes na avaliacao do resultado estetico da cicatriz umbilical. Classificacoes e padronizacoes tem sido ferramentas importantes para aprimoramento do diagnostico e refinamentos no tratamento dos disturbios esteticos do abdome. Alem disso, tem facilitado a reprodutibilidade dos procedimentos e servido de base para estudos comparativos. Objetivos: Apresentar a experiencia do autor com uma padronizacao tatica para o reposicionamento e reimplante da cicatriz umbilical em casos de abdominoplastias do grupo IV. Demonstrar a tatica de realocacao vertical do umbigo com detalhamento da nova posicao, avaliar a qualidade do resultado obtido e o grau de satisfacao das pacientes. Metodos: Vinte pacientes, todas do sexo feminino, foram submetidas ao procedimento entre maio de 2010 e maio de 2012. O periodo minimo de acompanhamento foi de trinta dias e o maximo, de dois anos. Resultados: A maioria dos resultados foi considerada excelente, atingindo alto nivel de satisfacao das pacientes, sem apresentar grandes complicacoes. Nao foram necessarias reintervencoes. A tecnica mostrou-se segura, simples e de facil execucao. Conclusao: A marcacao e o planejamento cirurgico, com a proposta de um limite caudal maximo para o reposicionamento da cicatriz umbilical, podem ser de grande valia tanto no auxilio aos diagnosticos mais complexos dos tipos de defeitos esteticos do abdome quanto nas indicacoes das tecnicas de abdominoplastias mais adequadas ao tratamento.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Realocação vertical da cicatriz umbilical em abdominoplastias do grupo IV de bozola e psillakis - padronização tática","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

This experimental model appears to be suitable for the testing of predictions based on results of kinetic studies with each isolated enzyme. In the simplest case, e.g. in a purely random system, the sum of kinetic parameters will decide the distribution of the common substrate in various metabolic directions as determined by the nature of the enzymes present. It may be anticipated, however, that in enzyme systems present in biological material, besides primary kinetic and thermodynamic determinants characteristic for each particular enzymatic step, there are more complex regulatory mechanisms that may result in an obligatory coupling or sequence of individual enzyme reactions. Discovery of specific regulatory mechanisms that modify single enzymatic reactions into physiological processes is difficult, owing to the complexity of such systems. Qualitative and quantitative analyses of enzyme contents of animal tissues are only a first approximation of the metabolic potential of each tissue. There is no a p+-iori reason to believe that all enzymes extractable from all types of cells are fully active at all times when present in their physiological environment, i.e. in the intact cell. The influence of restrictive, i.e. rate-limiting, forces, particularly through reversals of energy-conserving reactions (e.g. oxidative phosphorylations) is not immediately obvious from kinetics and equilibria of individual enzymatic reactions and must be studied in complex systems where these mechanisms operate. Conventional experimental procedures, such as balance studies (i.e. analyses of steady state concentrations of substrates and products), may often not distinguish between alternate enzymatic pathways and ordered sequences, since identical distribution of reactants may occur by either mechanism, as shown in this paper. We have adopted a systematic experimental approach that should distinguish between these possibilities. By developing specific inhibitors (l-8), we can selectively influence individual enzymes in multienzymatic systems. Application of these inhibitors should enable us to solve problems of multienzyme systems in a unique fashion.

It has been showed that the methanol extract had widest range of inhibitory activity as compared to the ethanol and aqueous extracts. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) as well as minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) of the extracts were determined for the various tested bacterial strains which ranged between 12.5 to 100 mg/ml.

Drawing on the capability approach as conceptual framework, I apply the Alkire-Foster method using German panel data. I suggest new operationalizations for two dimensions: social participation and practical reason, the latter drawing on recent findings in experimental economics. The results are consistent with earlier findings, but also reveal several new insights. Specifically, numerous decompositions of the poverty index prove helpful in better tracking and understanding developments. Moreover, I find poor individuals to be adversely affected by general trends in deprivation indicators. Comparing multidimensional and income-based methods, I find only a modest overlap of people considered as poor by both approaches. Moreover, I address the role of income as a dimension in multidimensional poverty indices.","inCitations":["138a1bc3d405fc6fbc2f70c0962f042493601c75"],"pdfUrls":["https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/113086/1/VfS_2015_pid_652.pdf","http://www.ophi.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/OPHIWP098.pdf","http://www.rwi-essen.de/media/content/pages/publikationen/ruhr-economic-papers/rep_15_541.pdf","https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/106992/1/817469257.pdf","http://repec.rwi-essen.de/files/REP_15_541.pdf"],"title":"Towards a Multidimensional Poverty Index for Germany","doi":"10.2139/ssrn.2583764","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.2583764","venue":""}

Consistently, the risk of osteoporotic HF increased 1.38-fold per increment in the plasma/bone marrow S1P ratio in a multivariate adjustment model. However, the odds ratios for prevalent HF according to the increment in the plasma and bone marrow S1P level were not statistically significant.ConclusionOur current results using simultaneously collected blood and bone marrow samples suggest that the detrimental effects of S1P on bone metabolism in humans may depend on the S1P gradient between the peripheral blood and bone marrow cavity.","inCitations":["e011d1d095e67b07cb2aea8268c5d63ed054fed3","b336f470f8c5e829d5640ff43e382dee6a97cc5b","bd2176221a188b7640030e1fb7a470ee82014fa9","e83d5ba38480749ba21aea7bd05709c96037e5cd","656d6a76079d35c42510904eb22f23b74027a6eb","76c02654ccd58066f31e2a2d3852a1a38e048052","bd17aa46fc05ae559335c1cfbb62e59c1223f1ff","6a678ea7d66605804257cc687fa074cf01edabb1","ca9c1a1339d56bd50c1852aa5ecf7bb0b993e0bf","261abadb20bc3d13a7af1ae949c05cdd6f7218e4"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"The effect of sphingosine-1-phosphate on bone metabolism in humans depends on its plasma/bone marrow gradient","doi":"10.1007/s40618-015-0364-x","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s40618-015-0364-x","venue":"Journal of Endocrinological Investigation"}

To fulfill this objective, the connections among four elements in the production of knowledge about contemporary social movements are examined: the relation between the subject studied and the subject that produces knowledge; the relation between life experience, representation and recognition; the human rights in the perspective of subaltern subjects; and discourse formations derived from the historicity and emancipatory desire of these subjects. Key words: social movements, post-colonialism, production of knowledge, human rights, network actions.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Movimentos sociais e pós-colonialismo na América Latina","doi":"10.4013/167","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.4013/167","venue":""}
