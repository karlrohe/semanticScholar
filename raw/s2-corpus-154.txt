As a result, both exist as attractive options for patients presenting with ST-segment elevation AMI. However, each therapy possesses limitations. Fibrinolytic therapy achieves complete reperfusion in only 50% of patients with as many as 6% of those suffering early reocclusion after successful reperfusion [1,3]. While success rates with primary angioplasty may be higher [4], this modality requires an experienced clinician and is not available in a timely fashion in many areas. For these reasons, an approach of initial ®brinolysis followed by immediate transfer to a tertiary care center for rescue angioplasty in case of ®brinolytic failure has become common practice in areas where access to a cardiac catheterization lab is limited. One well established factor in the failure of effective coronary reperfusion during either approach is platelet aggregation [5]. Accordingly, in the ReoPro and Primary PTCA Organization and Randomized Trial (RAPPORT), glycoprotein (GP) IIb=IIIa inhibition during primary angioplasty was associated with a 48% reduction in the 30-day combined endpoint of death, nonfatal reinfarction or ischemic driven target vessel revascularization [6]. However, for centers approaching reperfusion through ®brinolysis followed by rescue angioplasty in case of reperfusion failure, concerns have arisen regarding the safety of administering these bene®cial but potent GP IIb=IIIa inhibitors shortly after fulldose ®brinolysis. Currently, there are no direct studies examining the risks of adjunctive GP IIb=IIIa inhibition speci®cally during rescue angioplasty. Nonetheless, potential bene®ts and bleeding risk can be inferred from several indirect studies.

One of the imaging methods used in nuclear medicine is hybrid SPECT/CT scintigraphy. Objectives: The aim of this study was to evaluate the utility of SPECT/CT(Q) scintigraphy in the diagnosis of PE and to compare SPECT/CT(Q) with planar(Q) and SPECT(Q) methods. Methods: The study group consisted of 109 consecutive patients suspected of having PE referred for performing lung scintigraphy. The inclusion criteria were: performance of perfusion planar, SPECT and SPECT/CT scans; availability of clinical data covering a 6-month follow-up period, and D-dimer level testing. The number of eligible patients was 84. PE was reported in patients with at least 1 segmental or 2 subsegmental perfusion defects without parenchymal abnormalities on CT scans. PE was excluded when there was a normal perfusion pattern or perfusion defects were caused by lung parenchymal abnormalities or were not arranged in accordance with the pulmonary vasculature. Results: Twenty-six patients (31%) had a final diagnosis of PE. The sensitivity and specificity values of each method were as follows: planar(Q) 73 and 43%, SPECT(Q) 88 and 47% and SPECT/CT(Q) 100 and 83%. SPECT/CT(Q) yielded a significantly higher diagnostic accuracy than planar(Q) (p < 0.001) and SPECT(Q) (p < 0.001) scans. Conclusions: We conclude that hybrid SPECT/CT(Q) imaging has a high diagnostic efficacy in the diagnosis of PE. Lung perfusion scintigraphy performed with a hybrid SPECT/CT device has a significantly higher sensitivity and specificity than scanning performed with the planar or SPECT technique.","inCitations":["cb9cb27e47975d7a678ac4bdaadab84fa2dfa103","a5cbd97dec1481608f549b081f0bb55e2d1dae17","8c50c9157a4de41e2df5a90fe2875b7f556fbf26","e9813910bb7a1a00dbbf8119bec090a30c4fa097","78d193b9fb1ed63f0e06a3ee654ed2b00aa8c403","2a93031e36a8a2d424d700aca3337b345fdc70fc"],"pdfUrls":["https://www.karger.com/Article/Pdf/439543"],"title":"The Utility of Hybrid SPECT/CT Lung Perfusion Scintigraphy in Pulmonary Embolism Diagnosis","doi":"10.1159/000439543","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1159/000439543","venue":"Respiration"}

However, few studies have reported on the bonding performance of the bars in concrete when exposed to high temperatures. This paper investigates the effects of seven variable parameters, namely, temperature, bonded length, diameter and type of FRP bars, concrete strength, concrete cover thickness and a fireproof coating material on the concrete surface, on the bond stress-slip curves, failure modes, and bond strength of the BFRP bars. Glass fibre reinforced polymer (GFRP) bars were used for comparison. BFRP bar pullout specimens exhibited similar bond stress-slip curves at both room and high temperatures, but the peak bond stress and the slope decreased when the temperature increased. The bond strength declined gradually with the increase of the temperature, and the effect of temperature on the bond strength of the GFRP bar pullout specimens was more severe than that of the BFRP bar pullout specimens. At temperatures from 70 °C to 220 °C, the bond strength decreased by 2.45–14.24%. At 270 °C, the bond strength declined by approximately 32%. At 350 °C, the residual bond strength was 12.20–23.14% of their original values.","inCitations":["97aaf476878bbab16f362da39325df07a3f0bcbd","fd89d4e2046823a76b2295aa97eb38e8424b14f8","ac48f9336b88844b22ce903241ae9610078d5656","254e033db5d6dab0f5ecda115e3f8f296637619b"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Effect of high temperature on the bond performance between basalt fibre reinforced polymer (BFRP) bars and concrete","doi":"10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2017.02.125","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2017.02.125","venue":""}

This is not the case for ultrasound equipment when used to assess the rate of growth of the fetal skull in utero. This paper describes various sources of error which can affect the measurement of the fetal biparietal diameter; it also describes a method by which an operator might assess his own degree of competence. We conclude that these sources of error have been insufficiently appreciated in the past and while it is possible to determine the growth rate of the fetal skull the time interval necessary to measure this with a clinically realistic degree of confidence is not less than three weeks. If ultrasound methods of measurement are to find a place in clinical practice the techniques need to be more stringently appraised.","inCitations":["086fe2d2cc098a88bf9e27be05d92a6578ef4233","7fc9f8843d4864cd14b1a97fcbe1f796d3adc680","de82fcc429ca598cdff715432981c1f7066b4c9d","acde678451f9cd3886a2960e225d7da5beb3f210"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"The limitations of ultrasonic fetal cephalometry.","doi":"10.1111/j.1471-0528.1973.tb11217.x","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1471-0528.1973.tb11217.x","venue":"The Journal of obstetrics and gynaecology of the British Commonwealth"}

Performa kapal, baik dari segi hambatan maupun gerakannya, sangat bergantung pada kondisi kedalaman tersebut, sehingga diperlukan studi untuk memverifikasi keadaan ini. Penelitian ini fokus pada analisa hambatan dan seakeeping kapal bertipe barge dengan sarat terbatas. Disimulasikan pada beberapa kondisi kedalaman air yang berbeda. Variasi kedalaman dibagi menjadi 3 meliputi perairan dangkal (shallow water) dengan perbandingan kedalamanair dan sarat kapal, h/d = 1.2, perairan sedang (medium shallow water) h/d = 2 dan perairan dalam (deep water) dengan h/d = 20. Evaluasi hambatan dan seakeeping model dilakukan dengan mengkombinasikan metode numerik melalui CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamic) dengan eksperimen di laboratorium. Kondisi batas dari kedua metode dibuat sama sehingga hasilnya dapat bandingkan. Setelah hasil diperoleh, dilakukan desain baru terhadap lambung kapal barge dengan memvariasikan sudut rise of floor 5o dan 8o, kemudian disimulasikan pada kondisi shallow water untuk mengetahui pengaruhnya dalam rangka menemukan desain lambung yang optimum. Hasilnya menunjukkan bahwa rise of floor dengan sudut yang tidak terlalu besar dapat mengurangi hambatan di shallow water dan memperbaiki kemampuan seakeepng.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Studi Komparatif Performa Hidrodinamik Kapal Bertipe Shallow Draft Barge Pada Kondisi Perairan Dangkal, Sedang Dan Dalam","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

The level of accumulated LT tolerance depends on the cold acclimation rate and factors controlling timing of floral transition at the shoot apical meristem. In this study, genomic loci controlling the floral transition time were mapped in a winter wheat (T. aestivum L.) doubled haploid (DH) mapping population segregating for LT tolerance and rate of phenological development. The final leaf number (FLN), days to FLN, and days to anthesis were determined for 142 DH lines grown with and without vernalization in controlled environments. Analysis of trait data by composite interval mapping (CIM) identified 11 genomic regions that carried quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for the developmental traits studied. CIM analysis showed that the time for floral transition in both vernalized and non-vernalized plants was controlled by common QTL regions on chromosomes 1B, 2A, 2B, 6A and 7A. A QTL identified on chromosome 4A influenced floral transition time only in vernalized plants. Alleles of the LT-tolerant parent, Norstar, delayed floral transition at all QTLs except at the 2A locus.

While existing predictors can still be accessed in a single clock cycle, recent studies show that slower wires and faster clock rates will require multi-cycle access times to large on-chip structures, such as branch prediction tables. Thus, future branch predictors must consider not only area and accuracy, but also delay. The paper explores these tradeoffs in designing branch predictors and shows that increased accuracy alone cannot overcome the penalties in delay that arise with larger predictor structures. We evaluate three schemes for accommodating delay: a caching approach, an overriding approach, and a cascading lookahead approach. While we use a common branch predictor, gshare, as the prediction component, these schemes can be constructed using most types of predictors.","inCitations":["f3de6ed60ba6b45fd05794c3ecbf774b10212bfa","395ef78e0ac22456642c131ed3ed5991a65217d9","cc47047e13ef2b43586b70498074e1f1288b2505","33ab7f593a5d3c7060742df52f6dc79f2fdbe476","012173a628901c0a8eb93255cd980c2fefd107f3","35e23c5dc15765fbb7fbc0741b2cfef6da76ed8a","d45125db9020a80531a15df68146d0da5d51cd67","564efeae50e6c168d7fa60ed87e24c315c49ccf8","052be418082965a43974e0cd0b88690760b0249b","8a2cb621a116a1eab7e4cb559c50d613c42344bb","0c76b7526dfaf283e8d0c8d55baaa033d341defb","aa8b18cadffcdcf5bb962ff186fad316a730afc5","c85a9b143bb9fa34bf4a9fc3f336ca61f647f311","e383237c8faa0354b624f4a006ccb7cd4976d180","7a171abacced296e2364738812ccf0fe120f2062","03c8024aa1f1d83a974967e143700a846f1c9238","2e15c090fdee7d9a892d4239fe983ca9d7facd64","4aa35c9d2240cfe22187617dd2c63e9a5c90958d","00e839ff7cf0abd26803a826c8a4a6d6c90c5c85","381074884dd34a116bc351a57430d50bba043a38","dee96d185f2e5e5df96bd31eeadc579a23ca77d3","70f24b8ed5f8afa4bd2a913356f641916c29099f","7731e14abb150467f0e8af519843e172e78efcda","00236b398fdf32cdec00b10fa6e6cb43ab1b3785","92f2d64ce71f92eb2125be0d7bb1b7a1ab7d75b2","62ae4296700d2365640249716e0ad096bb5204d3","647e9b004153410e6f48c26f6fc7959610da0db2","7e4c92bd4ba6536f722de2e51e2f33b8d76df78d","7f5b69c43b53ec1cb1d9f3368eac337f4cea0953","9a9f1f1bbf7c87fdd0902fe1cd498aa85644f30d","be770b561effc412f3dbe1915374bccaa5eb8fce","fadb6208abaca71e19bfa08af75086d292bf39a4","7f5c46a67c1dcd4f88e25c4e575d7fad3ebb1d03","180d561a64dea4d739ead23e3a41ab7ac86ebadb","0e5e189c79055e7402b55f56158cbeac2c48cf70","7a2abaf8bd8db039eca297e6cb4e8bb49c985671","20e1db7d483fc357679453c133623db3cb7fa75e","f2bc967f9d176bf816075109516962a69d887c98","54b00a9d020239cc1236285c3224247703fb219a","bca4eca289b7711c296b8209d1679954b3236707","16f61f9e05ad2fb0d54175b4fa480eb41a850214"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~lin/papers/micro00.pdf","http://www.cs.utah.edu/~rajeev/cs7810/papers/jimenez00.pdf","http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~skeckler/pubs/micro00.pdf","http://taco.cs.utsa.edu/pdfs/micro33_dist.pdf","http://www.cs.utah.edu/classes/cs7960-004-rajeev/papers/jimenez00.pdf","http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/skeckler/pubs/micro00.pdf","http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/djimenez/micro33_dist.ps.gz","http://cava.cs.utsa.edu/pdfs/micro33_dist.pdf","http://www.cs.utsa.edu/~dj/micro33_dist.ps.gz","https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~lin/papers/micro00.pdf","http://faculty.cse.tamu.edu/djimenez/ut/micro33_dist.pdf","http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=360128.360137","http://cava.cs.utsa.edu/camino/micro33_dist.pdf","http://www.cs.rutgers.edu/~djimenez/pdfs/micro33_dist.pdf","http://taco.cse.tamu.edu/utsa-www/ut/micro33_dist.pdf","http://cava.cs.utsa.edu/psgz/micro33_dist.ps.gz","http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/lin/papers/micro00.pdf","http://www.cs.utah.edu/classes/cs7810-rajeev/papers/jimenez00.pdf","http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/lin/micro33.pdf","http://faculty.cse.tamu.edu/djimenez/pdfs/micro33_dist.pdf","http://www.cs.utsa.edu/~dj/ut/micro33_dist.pdf","http://camino.rutgers.edu/micro33_dist.pdf","http://taco.cse.tamu.edu/pdfs/micro33_dist.pdf"],"title":"The impact of delay on the design of branch predictors","doi":"10.1145/360128.360137","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1145/360128.360137","venue":"MICRO 33"}

Two dynamic hedging strategies are used as benchmarks; the delta hedging and delta-gamma hedging strategy, respectively. To increase realism to the system only discrete rebalancing of the replicating portfolios are possible. In addition, transaction costs are assumed and included. The analysis is limited to the down-and-out and up-and-out call European options. Hedging of European put barrier options could easily be constructed from the put-call-parity and European in-barrier options from the fact that a European option is equal to the sum of the in- and out-barrier option with the same barrier. The static hedge outperforms the two dynamic hedging strategies in particular when transaction costs are included. The static hedge is more successful in reducing the risk and delivers a higher average return.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://lup.lub.lu.se/luur/download?fileOId=1646450&func=downloadFile&recordOId=1334866"],"title":"Dynamic and Static Hedging of Barrier options","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Cross-sectional and longitudinal data for 66 participants were tested for relationships between IS, emotional dysfunction and insight at baseline and three months. IS and insight at baseline were compared between those with psychological and other causal models of psychosis. High levels of IS were associated with depression and social anxiety at baseline. Internalised stereotypes contributed to the variance in depression over time. Participants who reported a psychological causal model for their psychotic experiences had significantly lower levels of stigma. Findings support a stigma model of emotional dysfunction in people with psychosis replicating previous findings in an antipsychotic free group. Research is required to demonstrate effective interventions for IS in those with psychosis.","inCitations":["d6b2ebdde2318d4a6a85a30ddef1a8cb901f182e"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Associations between internalised stereotypes of psychosis and emotional dysfunction in people with psychosis not taking antipsychotic medication","doi":"10.1080/17522439.2014.980307","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1080/17522439.2014.980307","venue":""}

Later, the infection spreads to epithelia expressing nectin-4, an adherens junction protein expressed preferentially in the trachea, but how it gets there is not understood. To characterize the mechanisms of spread, we infected groups of 5 or 6 cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) with either a wild-type MV or its \"N4-blind\" derivative, which is unable to enter nectin-4-expressing cells because of the targeted mutation of two hemagglutinin residues. As expected, both viruses caused similar levels of immunosuppression, as monitored by reductions in white blood cell counts and lymphocyte proliferation activity. However, monkeys infected with the N4-blind MV cleared infection more rapidly. Wild-type virus-infected monkeys secreted virus, while marginal virus titers were detected in tracheal lavage fluid cells of N4-blind MV-infected hosts. Analyses of tracheal rings obtained at necropsy (day 12) documented widespread infection of individual cells or small cell clusters in the subepithelial lamina propria of monkeys infected with either virus. However, only wild-type MV spread to the epithelium, forming numerous infectious centers comprised of many contiguous columnar cells. Infected CD11c(+) myeloid (macrophage or dendritic) cells were frequently observed in the lamina propria below epithelial infectious centers. Thus, MV may use myeloid cells as vehicles not only immediately after contagion but also to infect epithelia of tissues expressing nectin-4, including the trachea.","inCitations":["502ab48df8b1780103bb7e668e1bd0301c0c876d","2a210cd64d06652ddf3f313ef20eec3391d93235","35ea60fa6ab5dde01a6a97fd5f5ef163184ce5c1","1f110f6cede3891f88e1f7699d486d8a532a8f7c","1a392e00bbbb6fa74ee8ccec0c620a77f2a3f389","ba755a14629ac9fccb139b26e32297acd234caf3","261e3c0d0644d9b6f3727831da4709ddb852fc6d","d735315a23f62bfa8d59ff4bd8f7836ea94ebea6","497b4b3748ef2d08148187c58cda8e580ac4ce8b","6d7f8819ca44c136ff42b8d46ef080f1cecc289e","58115d9c772b61c3f4b338fa4a4259d2e6cd2b31","77adf67f67a693e9d1a5abbba6b9c3addc0be7ae","8b887935aaa41e1640d69ad10faba2fe13946113","38e2d8c8a2a0a5c77983427ab31c60d18465b1b4","b8b13fd5a49e6193135315c97de14fb7b9936286","0a74b6e864e4294d7e9e94c7803bbaae4b0e0323","ee9b810fa5f2fd72c2d984099e2c787a86a9f09e","5b49d776da5697132b4db866cd5081b88f033dc1","5a8868009c199183d98ac6d2920e7c0f58094bef","815337066450295142658b4e5b4ab77d15b48c16","0eb9dc60e1e22996120267dc4269d847f7e8db0e","0f3f718a04038caeef01127fb9d29a1e1c09ea52","52de20c162fd02d31a8ca09fdad8303569374f0e","30183f2d1c660cbe88b4b890bcc6ec691114e81b"],"pdfUrls":["http://jvi.asm.org/content/87/5/2526.full.pdf","http://espace.inrs.ca/2896/1/zjv2526.pdf"],"title":"Nectin-4-dependent measles virus spread to the cynomolgus monkey tracheal epithelium: role of infected immune cells infiltrating the lamina propria.","doi":"10.1128/JVI.03037-12","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1128/JVI.03037-12","venue":"Journal of virology"}

In the denitrification chamber (anoxic) in 1 cm3 of sewage there were on average 30.35 · 106 CFU of mesophilic bacteria, 72.88 · 106 CFU of psychrophilic bacteria, and 37.3 · 105 CFU of microscopic fungi. In the nitrification chamber, where the oxygen concentration ranged from 0.37 to 2.32 mg O2·dm−3 of wastewater, the number of microorganisms was lower. In 1 cm3 of wastewater there were on average 20.2 · 106 CFU of mesophilic bacteria, 51.76 · 106 CFU of psychrophilic bacteria, and 15.22 · 105 CFU of microscopic fungi. In sewage bioaerosols above these chambers, higher numbers of psychrophilic bacteria than mesophilic ones and microscopic fungi were reported. At the same time differences in the number of microorganisms at different heights above the surface of wastewater could be observed in bioaerosol, as well as between the chambers of the bioreactor. It was found that most frequently the amount of microorganisms decreased with height. The percentage emission ratio (ER) of microorganisms in bioaerosols coming from wastewater accounted for only a fraction of a percent and ranged from 1.13 · 10−8 % (microscopic fungi over the denitrification chamber) to 24.53 · 10−9 % (psychrophilic bacteria over the denitrification chamber). It was found that the process of mixing, aeration of wastewater, have an effect on the emission of microorganisms.","inCitations":["bb2583012b6cb8c005882ca4634371225d51c5ac"],"pdfUrls":["https://content.sciendo.com/downloadpdf/journals/eces/25/2/article-p267.pdf"],"title":"The Variability of the Concentration of Bioaerosols Above the Chambers of Biological Wastewater Treatment","doi":"10.1515/eces-2018-0018","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1515/eces-2018-0018","venue":""}

The model explicitly incorporates the decentralized interaction of heterogeneous agents across different sectors and regions. The modeling of individual behavior is based on heuristics with empirical microfoundations. Although Eurace@Unibi has been applied successfully to different policy domains, the complexity of the structure of the model, which is similar to other agent-based macroeconomic models, makes it hard to communicate to readers the exact working of the model and enable them to check the robustness of obtained results. This paper addresses these challenges by describing the details of all decision rules, interaction protocols and balance sheet structures used in the model. Furthermore, we discuss the use of a virtual appliance as a tool allowing third parties to reproduce the simulation results and to replicate the model. The paper illustrates the potential use of the virtual appliance by providing some sensitivity analyses of the simulation output carried out using this tool.","inCitations":["7de6235f23f09ec092bb2050dfa9151a4ed39755","fdce9ce57ce097cdb4efc2dc3b378b520bf10a81","6da7780d8a7fdac6b6f1347aa48d03eb35a4dd71","a1a45b7bb3612efe9796fcf969ccbf27fadaceb5","ce624c9d7b19ae1166cdcc8016a3ff8848cda050","3bcb33a1a70e15c2730939b14a590b8a6f20da51"],"pdfUrls":["https://www.vwl3.wi.tu-darmstadt.de/media/vwl3/downloads_1/aktuelles/neugart/laufende_arbeiten/eurace_unibi_jeec_rev_2017.pdf"],"title":"Macroeconomics with heterogeneous agent models: fostering transparency, reproducibility and replication","doi":"10.1007/s00191-018-0594-0","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00191-018-0594-0","venue":""}

Advances in functional neuroimaging and increased availability have meant that updated guidelines from the National Institute of Ageing and Alzheimer’s Association (NIAA/AA) and the revised Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 5th Edition (DSM-5) include the use of such modalities as supportive measures in atypical cases. We sought to compare the concordance of findings on fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) with neuropsychological assessment in a convenience sampling of patients attending the Geriatric Medicine outpatient service of a large teaching hospital. Methods: We identified 11 patients with FDG-PET imaging that had also undergone neuropsychological assessment from a retrospective analysis of attendees to our outpatient clinics. Detailed interpretive reports were available for all FDG-PET studies. Neuropsychological assessments were reviewed and deficits identified, with scores greater than two standard deviations below the mean (both when compared with normative data from age-matched peers and with the patient’s own estimated pre-morbid IQ) considered abnormal. Results: On neuropsychological assessment, 8 out of 11 had abnormalities detected in at least one cognitive domain. Of these, 7 out of 8 had abnormalities on functional imaging. Of those with normal neuropsychological assessments, 2 out of 3 had abnormalities on imaging, giving an overall concordance rate of 73%. Conclusion: Concordance between abnormalities identified on FDG-PET imaging and neuropsychological assessment was high but not absolute, as evidenced by patients with normal neuropsychological findings and abnormal imaging and vice versa. Current functional imaging techniques, while useful, remain only one part of a multifaceted approach to the evaluation of suspected cognitive impairment.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"066Concordance of FDG-PET Imaging with Neuropsychological Assessment in Patients Presenting with Cognitive Impairment with Atypical Features","doi":"10.1093/ageing/afx144.93","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1093/ageing%2Fafx144.93","venue":""}

Marriot dan Jl. Kuningan Jakarta merupakan bagian dari aksi terorisme yang melanda dunia. Peristiwa ini meskipun tidak terkait langsung dengan kegiatan perekonomian namun berdampak luas bagi kehidupan masyarakat melihat besarnya jumlah korban yang ditimbulkan. Bagian masyarakat yang ikut cemas dan khawatir melihat perkembangan yang terjadi adalah para investor. Investasi besar terlanjur banyak ditanamkan ke dalam banyak proyek, mendorong mereka untuk senantiasa mengikuti perkembangan yang terjadi. Para investor memastikan investasi yang ditanamkan terjamin keselamatannya. Aman tidaknya investasi bisa dilihat dari kestabilan keamanan suatu negara, karena jika kondisi keamanan suatu negara relatif stabil maka akan mendorong perekonomian negara tersebut, yang berarti menciptakan iklim yang kondusif bagi investor. Oleh karena itu investor memerlukan informasi yang jelas, pasti dan tepat waktu. Salah satu tempat utama para investor untuk melakukan transaksi perdagangan dalam upaya menanamkan investasinya adalah pasar modal. Sehingga setiap kejadian yang mempengaruhi pasar modal akan berpengaruh pula pada para investor. Peristiwa peledakan bom di J.W. Marriot pada tanggal 5 Agustus 2003 dan di Jl. Kuningan pada tanggal 9 September 2004 adalah peristiwa yang diduga berpengaruh terhadap indeks harga saham di Indonesia. Penelitian ini bertujuan untuk mengetahui dampak peristiwa peledakan bom di hotel J.W. Marriot dan Jl. Kuningan terhadap Return Market dan Trading Volume Activity (TVA) di Bursa Efek Jakarta (BEJ). Sumber data yang digunakan dalam penelitian ini adalah data sekunder, yakni informasi saham pada tanggal 22 Juli sampai 20 Agustus 2003 untuk kasus di J.W. Marriot dan informasi saham pada tanggal 26 Agustus sampai 27 September 2004 yang dimuat dalam Indonesian Capital Market Directory yang diperoleh dari pojok BEJ Universitas Muhammadiyah Malang. Metode yang digunakan dalam penelitian ini adalah event study, yakni suatu pengamatan mengenai pergerakan harga saham di pasar modal untuk mengetahui besarnya abnormal return yang diperoleh pemegang saham akibat dari suatu perisitiwa tertentu. Periode yang digunakan dalam penelitian ini adalah 21 hari bursa, yakni yakni terdiri dari 10 hari (t-10 hingga t1) sebelum peristiwa (pre-event), satu hari (t0) pada saat peristiwa (event day) dan 10 hari (t+1 hingga t+10) setelah peristiwa (post event). Kemudian untuk membuktikan signifikansi perbedaan data sebelum peristiwa(pre-event) dengan setelah peristiwa (post-event) dilakukan dengan menggunakan t-test: Paired Two Sample for Means. Setelah dilakukan analisa data dengan menggunakan t-test: Paired TwoSample for Means diperoleh hasil sebagai berikut: 1.Tidak terdapat perbedaan yang signifikan Return Market di BEJ sebelum dengan sesudah terjadinya peledakan bom di hotel JW. Marriot. 2.Tidak terdapat perbedaan yang signifikan Return Market di BEJ sebelum dengan sesudah terjadinya peledakan bom di hotel Jl. Kuningan Jakarta. 3.Tidak terdapat perbedaan yang signifikan Trading Volume Activity di BEJ sebelum dengan sesudah terjadinya peledakan bom di hotel JW. Marriot. 4.Tidak terdapat perbedaan yang signifikan Trading Volume Activity di BEJ sebelum dengan sesudah terjadinya peledakan bom di hotel Jl. Kuningan Jakarta. Dari keseluruhan hasil penelitian dapat disimpulkan bahwa peristiwa peledakan bom di hotel J.W. Marriot dan Jl. Kuningan Jakarta tidak berdampak signifikan terhadap Return Market dan Trading Volume Activity di Bursa Efek Jakarta. Oleh karena itu, meskipun pasar modal tidak dapat dilepaskan dari berbagai lingkungan non-ekonomi seperti politik, isu terorisme, lingkungan hidup dan hak asasi manusia, akan tetapi tidak semua faktor tersebut berdampak signifikan terhadap return dan aktivitas perdagangan di bursa saham sehingga diharapkan para pelaku pasar bisa selektif dalam mengambil keputusan.

The results showed that the Generation Y employees expected more from their employers regarding career development, work-life balance, and social atmosphere. At the same time, the older generation perceived stronger employer obligations related to organizational policy, and stronger employee obligations related to in-role performance. We also tested the moderating effect of age on the relationship between PCB and job attitudes (job satisfaction, organizational commitment, and turnover intention). The moderating effect was observed only for the relationship between PCB and turnover intention: the younger employees reacted to PCB with a stronger turnover intention than the older employees.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Generational Differences in Psychological Contract Content and Reactions to Psychological Contract Breach in the Transition Context: a Study of Croatian Employees","doi":"10.19090/pp.2016.4.395-412","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.19090/pp.2016.4.395-412","venue":""}

The pressing height-regulating device comprises a guide sleeve, a supporting base, a rotary shaft, a spring and a key, wherein the guide sleeve is vertically arranged, the supporting base is fixedly connected with the port of the guide sleeve, the rotary shaft is arranged inside the guide sleeve, the spring is arranged between the second end of the rotary shaft and the supporting base, the key is arranged between the first end of the rotary shaft and the top end of the guide sleeve and used for pushing the rotary shaft to vertically move, the other end of the key stretches into the outside of the guide sleeve, and the outer side wall of the key is provided with a guide key matched with a limiting groove. When the pressing height-regulating device is used, the key is pressed continuously, the key moves to the highest position from the lowest position in a step-by-step mode and then moves to the lowest position from the highest position when pressed again, and the height of the key can be circularly regulated. The problems that an existing height regulating device can not achieve step-by-step regulation when regulation is conducted from the lowest position to the highest position, and after the largest height is achieved, the height needs to be reduced to the smallest height, then the height is regulated, and circular regulation of height changes can not be achieved are solved.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Pressing height-regulating device","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Samples were collected by active sampling onto preconditioned stainless steel standard adsorbent tubes packed with Tenax TA adsorbent using a portable constant low flow volume sampler. Sampling flow rate ranged 20-25 ml min -1 and sampling duration 1.30-2.30 h. Samples were analysed by thermal desorption followed by gas chromatography coupled with automated thermal desorber. The desorption system was provided with a cryogenic trap filled with Tenax TA adsorbent. External calibration was performed using five concentration levels of standards solutions in carbon disulfide (CS 2 ). Linear fit in all cases were found good with R 2 > 0.99. Benzene'concentration ranged 33.69-174.62 μg m -3 whereas toluene ranged 45.18-228.83μg m -3 in the vicinity of petrol pump along with heavy traffic roadside at Preet Vihar location. Average benzene and toluene concentration of ambient air at ITO (near a busy traffic intersection) ranged 13.03-33.06 μg m -3 and 19.71-57.64 μg m -3 respectively. While at East Arjun Nagar (a residential cum institutional area), levels were 17.69 μg m -3 and 22.81 tag m -3 for benzene and toluene, respectively. Present study indicated that the concentration of benzene at all the sites was higher than the limit values prescribed in the UK (16 μg m -3 , running annual average) and European Commission (5 tag m -3 , annual average). Average toluene and benzene ratio ranged between 1.29 μg m -3 in residential cum institutional area to 1.74 μg m -3 at busy traffic intersection.","inCitations":["78a1e067f9411f109128ebf047f15c9193214f38","f33db5135bacfd0b1368080c756bacf0974084d1","68fc7d2243b875d90cd672c4b1a0abb416728020","c83c3cb36c32913cfd67c538b49e408427c91416","9ea9f131defe1939cf7419d35726745285900875","6bd69b187444c8738dc5f8ee0c706d3499b30f6f","0cda2df8d6b39a0bb5475dd163dfc02189a520c6","080f86a076575b75ae17eff2bea24953d2eee377","32022a8ce949201a3084e77931621f13cee1b992","d3405c1ecb269eff1ebc401a6ca2d023d2b98230","d8f7a9db111881612d6510a00ade94d187b4d1bf","78b90eb9f16e93085615c44151f4d22849d92733","be08d7b0cfa4f33a923cc916189b7a2c1e46b7d6","7a9ca36acac8c6c5199041431a2d8e1b4cb7a06a","240d9e3f05040c09db872b2ba8bf873cf0b569b1","08a3393e55a6bbe746bf9e8ec87f03ef9deb2d96","b6e31a400b5beb4ffa06fa1886cc1953ff560657","1a3e4831981f95915e9115dd1072549f9d6e08db"],"pdfUrls":["http://nopr.niscair.res.in/bitstream/123456789/4822/1/JSIR%2065(3)%20252-257.pdf"],"title":"Benzene and toluene profiles in ambient air of Delhi as determined by active sampling and GC analysis","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Such functions have interpolation and reproducing properties as the linear splines in Euclidean spaces. They also have H\\\"older regularity. This is used to build an orthonormal basis of H\\\"older-continuous wavelets with exponential decay in any space of homogeneous type. As in the classical theory, wavelet bases provide a universal Calder\\'on reproducing formula to study and develop function space theory and singular integrals. We discuss the examples of $L^p$ spaces, BMO and apply this to a proof of the T(1) theorem. As no extra condition {(like 'reverse doubling', 'small boundary' of balls, etc.)} on the space of homogeneous type is required, our results extend a long line of works on the subject.","inCitations":["e9f9a99cdffa5a6acdf0e39cb09e54124c8cca9b","fdaa2144284fbbc9ae7b4e8d4b6ee9765aa7952c","694b00c0ffb9174953832de536a4bc2f7e8acc7b","fbc067ec38c64b237f607af209bdbbca07f8707a","dbe683b27a325e527de5f1440c563ac94baaf0fc","d110aca9656278af5d432363e13ad843ae2710f8","c31f43ec6aaf5d2a7f51774dfabe286007386773","da2949343d36a1159269bcaf412cb0e5caa5ede0","cafc475b2773b2d49167578cf1f1d56ab4a71e88","8e1135a974d3978217726aabeb8615faf73085c6","54219217ad51e84d0c7497fab5cb996cde406591","b4941d8deb6edf321dbb54e6e7f8b5887bc46f58","b2d00e1c08efad8b05fa65d06814e65448d5b383","d4565103e2aed177fd92c06eabd442ea17d961e2","77e05662ca3a6a1f7aa919efa803c707aab2ff8f","226fa2dc05bd55a21fd491ea89c9d2f52b9000f6","6d89c4d2b4b3b7bff23f9f14d8b52a28902dcde0","d6c4491f3972d0e040fa4fdbbbba58f6c68b1f52","2286b840f030e1945813656ad7b7986fee4eace9","f6fb36dd0e07832766942c2954cf806413293c56","3f41ee8e2ad958f4e34315590d0a7e3804a215ff","50df6c2626f65b809fbb0196aff7664ebf39bf4e"],"pdfUrls":["https://arxiv.org/pdf/1110.5766v3.pdf"],"title":"Orthonormal bases of regular wavelets in spaces of homogeneous type","doi":"10.1016/j.acha.2012.05.002","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.acha.2012.05.002","venue":""}

The world is facing an acute shortage of fuel sources. Some break-through has been achieved in the form of solar energy, hydrogen fuel cells, biofuels etc. The use of these alternatives decreases the dependency on the present fossil fuels and also reduces the pollution to a great extent. In this paper, the author's idea on chemical and biological processes to produce alternate fuels has been discussed. Moreover this fuel source can also be used to generate electricity to run household appliances.The other way of producing hydrogen is the use of Green Algae.The other alternate fuel source is biofuels. This is produced by the processing of any plant part of biofuel plant sources. The concept is to identify and isolate the gene responsible for the synthesis of triglycerides (hydrocarbons) in these plants, and transform it into commonly found plants, which have a short growth period and which could withstand the effects of the gene. The prime criterion, as a whole, is the quest for the most optimum renewable source to keep the world moving on its wheels, not only for now, but also for the future generations.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Power generation ’ sustainable or not?","doi":"10.1109/ISEE.2008.4562857","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISEE.2008.4562857","venue":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Electronics and the Environment"}

The approach utilizes radial waveguide approximations for fields within the corrugations, which are point matched to approximated scattered fields outside of the corrugation to solve for the expansion coefficients. The point matching is done with TMz and TEz modes simultaneously, allowing for hybrid modes to exist. The methodology and analysis applied in this paper provide a solution for computational electromagnetics, RF communications, radar systems and the like, for the design, development, and analysis of such systems. The modeling techniques offered provide a full description and prediction of the scattered field of a periodic corrugated cylinder. The model is configured to validate the results by comparing them to alternate methods for the same geometry.","inCitations":["97e578adb53f356c5efd548b77a3125cce248085"],"pdfUrls":["http://purl.flvc.org/fau/fd/FA00004819"],"title":"Plane-wave scattering of a periodic corrugated cylinder","doi":"10.1109/mwsym.2017.8058598","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/mwsym.2017.8058598","venue":"2017 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium (IMS)"}

During LUAD progression, the emergence of alternate cell lineage traits in primary tumors correlates with poor outcome. The underlying mechanisms and biological consequences of these phenomena are poorly understood.\n\nUsing an integrated approach, we examined the molecular relationship between cell differentiation states, lung cancer subtypes, and clinical outcome, to discover a role for lineage-restricted genes in the pathogenesis of LUAD (1). Specifically, we identified two airway selective lineage transcription factors, GATA6 and HOPX, as inhibitors of metastatic progression. Down-regulation of their expression in a subset of human tumors correlates with aberrant tumor differentiation and relapses. GATA6 and HOPX cooperatively restrict the metastatic potential of LUAD cells, by modulating converging transcriptional programs of airway epithelial differentiation and malignant invasion.\n\nOur findings demonstrate that perturbation of intrinsic cell lineage pathways is a determinant of metastasis in specific lung cancers. The implications of these findings for the origin(s) and treatment of LUAD metastasis will be discussed.\n\n(1) Cancer Cell, 23 (6): 725-738. 2013.\n\nCitation Format: Don X. Nguyen.

Especially, enlarged motion distances of UHDTV lead to additional difficulties in the implementation of motion estimation, which is originally the most critical bottleneck of an encoder. This paper presents a motion estimation processor design for H.264/AVC. A test chip is implemented in 40 nm CMOS. With algorithm and architecture co-optimization, the processor delivers a maximum throughput of 1.59 Gpixel/s for 7680 × 4320 48 fps video, at least 7.5 times faster than previous designs. The corresponding core power dissipation is 622 mW at 210 MHz, with energy efficiency improved by at least 23%. The chip's DRAM bandwidth requirement is also 68% lower than previous chips. With a maximum search range of ±211 (horizontal) by ±106 (vertical) around a predictive search center, the proposed motion estimation processor well accommodates the high motion of UHDTV.","inCitations":["0a5c3516c54d6d92a77d1957cd0f99603e3b2f4e","f6297ba549441f6eaa721bcb47a7f613cfe11c0e","d3959a3c93f6452761fcfcbc72f9a10e7f4d23cf","e1416d4aeb0f60251f198cf6430431c42b9320de","b260fda7b8a12faab71464054c396946fb79a120","54d37271716ae142359427ce82d4142701866a6f","138413233c6a4c8768fa24700be982077af8910f","6dd1077b4db66e9d76e1ec232163bfff8257fb21","b30f70d8b00f150bbda8a299612c4639d3903f44","e2db0c8aefa04f744443dbbb6b230f2ddfb5c07b","5f2320a020c710d38a79fde3818e5473607751c2","97875c0f46b2fdddec3eac29b1a6364f4e1a8723","c7d858bcd82d232c229de079c295513aa3d5942b","44b0413e5c5ee286a212ecacd8a181569dc9cf4a","7b2018b2b6d8815103b11a9e0f06566f23e06275","fcd39930115795ea2d8ae41744c0cd36eff3f9ef","901901a4e1b5bcb8db3e91be88234ead73804627","9c86499c534151d07f31f5a1ca36955c2efaf1ae","98b0684c25280a7cfb6d12ee7deb7434463288ce","28f30475ba5290724df4fda46176c32ab0af47eb","12d2b8da3ce6864eccdc1aed073da6d482971926","49aa0749b460f561e5ea0959c888bc59355f96bc","3abb2e3b0863fac214c8af9381b8fbfc35a0307b","6b0ddf589784aa7a6cfb1a92cd9f53e94a26196e","f936c863f7fa6fe25694efb780b58fddb8c6a27f","3046f706d1784b7c96aac4530123208b23e2ea97","3fc6cd7408a505327143c189755608644aebe492","1cd15773d29fcfe08e8cc20bef004af2f6180994","b6836bc413de26bed61334f54a38ca82570c4cd5","bf173f248de62c5c314dbf41881a0a8c8812b92e","7275a001bc7fae5bda5b6a664f4b75860ddfee05","91fd64fa4dcd5f50af490363472fcd0fea807a8d"],"pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1109/JSSC.2013.2293136","http://www.aoni.waseda.jp/zhou/pdf/ieee-accepted/14-jssc.pdf"],"title":"A 1.59 Gpixel/s Motion Estimation Processor With  $-$211 to +211 Search Range for UHDTV Video Encoder","doi":"10.1109/JSSC.2013.2293136","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSSC.2013.2293136","venue":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits"}

Tourist attraction in the last ten years there has been a very significant increase, even almost eleven times the increase. This certainly threatens marine sustainability and ecological quality will be maintained when there is a significant increase in the intensity of tourism activities. Moreover, at the previous time there were many records of violations of the law related to zoning system violations committed by both local people and outsiders of Karimunjawa island. one of the zones violated is the core zone. The core zone is the center of all marine ecosystems in Karimunjawa, if the core zone is damaged, then other marine ecosystems will also be damaged, therefore there is a need to design conservation and supervision of core zones to maintain their sustainability in the face of threats of increased tourism activities. \nThe aims of the research are : (1) Analyze the level of ecological quality of the core zones of Karimunjawa National Park, (2) Develop hypothetical market designs for conservation and safeguarding and control of the core zones of Karimunjawa National Park, (3) Analyze willingness to pay (willingness to pay ) the community in the framework of conservation and supervision as well as securing the core zones in Karimunjawa National Park, (4) Determining the best scenario and solution model in action and monitoring violations of zoning rules of the core zones of Karimunjawa National Park. . \nThis research uses the mixed method by combining qualitative analysis and quantitative analysis. Quantitative analysis to determine the amount of willingness to pay the community and stakeholders in rupiah using the Contingent Valuation Method method, while qualitative analysis to determine the best solution for the enforcement and supervision of the core zones of Karimunjawa National Park \nThe results of this study are based on literature review analysis, the ecological conditions of the core zone seen from hard coral cover are still fairly good, but for the category of hard coral recruitment the conditions are low. While for the community willingness to pay analysis and related stakeholders are willing to pay contributions for the conservation and safeguarding the core zone of Karimunjawa National Park for an average of Rp. 27,000.00 per year and have a total value of WTP for the population of Rp. 253,233,000 in one year. \nThen the results of qualitative analysis using ATLAS 7.0 can be concluded that there are two main enforcement and supervision strategies, namely the Collaborative Role between the community and the Karimunjawa National Park Hall, the second is a more explicit action from the Karimunjawa National Park Office to the rules violators so as to provide deterrent effect and reduce the level of violation of the core zone.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Valuasi Ekonomi Tindakan Konservasi Serta Pengamanan Dan Pengawasan Marine Protected Area Taman Nasional Karimunjawa","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Some messages are even hostile (e.g. fatal error in pass zero) and leave the novice sadder and certainly no wiser. The quality of error messages is usually the loser when the compiler writer attempts to balance conflicting design constraints such as size, speed, quality of target code and utility of use by competent programmers. We believe that novices’ programs should be passed through a series of checkers which are designed to trap and comment on the particular kinds of errors made by them. Such systems may have to make several passes through the program, even to provide an apposite comment on a syntactic error. For logic checking such systems will need access to a description (in some form) of what the novice's program is supposed to do. Only when a novice's program passes through all the checkers successfully should it be submitted to the standard compiler.

The primary hypothesis was that the SMART regimen would reduce the risk of beta-agonist overuse. Secondary aims were to investigate whether patients treated with the SMART regimen were less likely to seek medical review in the setting of beta-agonist overuse and to determine whether any reduction in severe asthma exacerbations would be at a cost of a higher systemic corticosteroid burden. \n\nThis 24-week, open-label, parallel-group, multicentre randomised controlled trial randomised 303 asthma patients with a recent exacerbation to combination 200/6µg budesonide/formoterol metered dose inhaler (MDI) according to the SMART regimen (two actuations twice daily as maintenance with one extra actuation as-needed for relief of symptoms) or a fixed-dose regimen (two actuations twice daily as maintenance) with one to two actuations of 100µg salbutamol MDI as-needed for relief of symptoms (the ‘Standard’ regimen), with electronic monitoring to measure actual medication use. The use of electronic monitoring allowed beta-agonist overuse to be applied as a marker of the risk of life-threatening asthma. The primary outcome was the proportion of participants with at least one high beta-agonist use episode (more than eight actuations per day of budesonide/formoterol in addition to the four maintenance doses in the SMART group or more than 16 actuations per day of salbutamol in the Standard group). \n\nThere was no significant difference between groups in the proportion of participants with at least one high use episode: SMART 84/151 (55.6%) versus Standard 68/152 (44.7%), relative risk (95% CI) 1.24 (0.99 to 1.56), p=0.058. There were fewer days of high use in the SMART group [mean (SD) 5.1 days (14.3) versus 8.9 days (20.9), relative rate (95% CI) 0.58 (0.39 to 0.88), p=0.01]. Of the participants who had at least one high use episode, those in the SMART group had fewer days of high use without medical review [mean (SD) 8.5 days (17.8) versus 18.3 days (24.8), relative rate (95% CI) 0.49 (0.31 to 0.75), p=0.001]. The SMART regimen resulted in higher inhaled corticosteroid exposure [mean (SD) 943.5µg budesonide per day (1502.5) versus 684.3µg budesonide per day (390.5), ratio of means (95% CI) 1.22 (1.06 to 1.41), p=0.006], but reduced oral corticosteroid exposure [mean (SD) 77.5mg prednisone (240.5) versus 126.6mg prednisone (382.1), p=0.011], with no significant difference in composite systemic corticosteroid exposure [mean (SD) 793.7mg prednisone equivalent per year (893.1) versus 772.1mg prednisone equivalent per year (1062.7), ratio of means (95% CI) 1.03 (0.86 to 1.22), p=0.76]. Participants in the SMART group had fewer severe asthma exacerbations [35 (weighted mean rate per year 0.53) versus 66 (0.97), relative rate (95% CI) 0.54 (0.36 to 0.82), p=0.004]. \n\nThe SMART regimen has a favourable risk/benefit profile in patients at risk of severe asthma exacerbations. \n\n\nFunding\n\nThis study was funded by the Health Research Council of New Zealand, a government funding organisation.","inCitations":["5a4569ba745b096b04d04787eb449df908169e47"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Efficacy and safety of maintenance and reliever combination budesonide/formoterol therapy in asthma patients at risk of severe exacerbations : a randomised controlled trial","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}
