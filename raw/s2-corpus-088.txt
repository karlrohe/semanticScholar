As the causes of hypernatremia in major burn patients are still not clear, hemodialysis is the method of choice for the treatment. While hemodialysis is effective for the control of hypernatremia, it can cause bleeding complications that may be fatal for burn patients with extensive wounds and potential gastro-intestinal mucosal damage.\n\n\nCLINICAL DATA\nIn the present study heparin-free hemodialysis in which the heparin is firmly absorbed to the haemofiltration membrane, hemophan, dispensed with systemic use of heparin. In two extensively burned patients with burn area of 100% TBSA and 98% TBSA respectively and hypernatremia with serum sodium concentration as high as 169 and 158 mmol/l respectively, heparin-free hemodialysis was performed five times and three times each.\n\n\nRESULTS\nHypernatremia was satisfactorily corrected with no interference to the coagulation system in the two patients as indicated by clinical observation and biochemical analysis. The patient with burn area of 98% TBSA survived and the patient with burn area of 100% TBSA died of wound coverage failure 6 weeks after injury because of non-availability of autograft.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nHeparin-free hemodialysis is an effective and safe method in the treatment of hypernatremia in extensively burned patients.","inCitations":["683c2e3df7c21b15233b2779f829d83fc1fbe90a","c1a6ee056be7193986056333a2d63feb554b3715","3c5c94c48215769858c2637efbaf4ac6a91f751e","096fead7e19743ea5badbc18464c3621a13a055f","12d179d6e511e6719741845daa21bcaed4f51a90","ab8c082accb26a5c9b00906ef852e64e1063fbb9","fd525612afb392ec433bac6091caaf72050192de"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Heparin-free hemodialysis in the treatment of hypernatremia in severely burned patients.","doi":"10.1016/S0305-4179(00)00005-X","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/S0305-4179%2800%2900005-X","venue":"Burns : journal of the International Society for Burn Injuries"}

A fact that is well established by expert evaluators is that adaptive systems cannot be evaluated as if they were non-adaptive. Several researchers acknowledge that evaluation o f such systems is a difficult, demanding endeavour due to the complex nature o f such systems. One m ajor problem is the understanding o f the adaptation mechanism o f the system, what is improved by the adaptation, and what might have been the situation if a different kind o f adaptation had occurred. Furthermore, when the evaluation o f an adaptive system indicates a problem, such as user dissatisfaction and non-use o f adaptive features, it is impossible to pinpoint the source o f these problems, whether wrong user model, problems with the adaptation theory, wrong adaptation strategy, inappropriate method or evaluation techniques (methods, metrics, and criteria). It is important that evaluators o f these systems use correct evaluation techniques. This thesis investigates evaluations o f adaptive E-Leam ing systems developed from 2()()() to date and addresses the fact that it is difficult to identify the evaluation objective, the evaluation approach, and the range o f evaluation choices. This evidence-based study examines what people have evaluated in adaptive systems and what evaluation techniques they used, and then maps those techniques to different evaluation approaches and techniques. Based on the results o f these investigations, there is clear evidence that many design choices are being made during evaluations o f adaptive E-Leam ing systems. For an expert evaluator this is tricky; for a novice evaluator it is much more difficult. Researchers need more advice on their evaluation options in order to attain their goal. They need support in their decision-making. To support these evaluators, the candidate has specified, designed and developed a web-based evaluation framework for supporting evaluators o f adaptive systems (EFEx). In addition the candidate has designed and implemented a focused crawling system for evaluation studies o f adaptive E-Leam ing systems. The major contribution o f this thesis is a novel hybrid (case-based and knowledge-based) recommendation service built on an evaluation educational dataset. A recommendation technology is used to enhance the appropriateness o f suggestions for evaluation techniques for adaptive systems. A hybrid (casestudy and user-centred) evaluation approach was taken to evaluate and validate the thesis. In addition a detailed analysis o f the different aspects o f the research is presented, outlining and addressing the identified challenges encountered by evaluators o f adaptive systems.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://www.tara.tcd.ie/bitstream/handle/2262/79582/Mulwa%20TCD%20THESIS%2010626%20An%20investigation.pdf?isAllowed=y&sequence=1"],"title":"An investigation of and a hybrid recommender system for evaluating adaptive E-Learning systems","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

In the process of operation friction clutches take significant loads. The friction surfaces of clutches are subject to the effect of thermal overloading and intensive wear. To reduce the thermal and dynamic loading of the friction clutch, friction materials with enhanced thermal conductivity and thermal capacity are recommended to be used in friction pairs. It is also recommended to increase the total area (for all friction pairs) of the friction contact with the fixed value of the moment of friction; to intensify the heat exchange of friction pairs with the environment by improving the system of oil cooling of rubbing solids and making the structure of the friction material ensure liquid or marginal conditions of friction of friction-interacting solids, the difference between the coefficients of static and dynamic friction being the least, regardless of the lubricant viscosity.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Повышение Долговечности Многодискового Фрикциона Гидромеханической Передачи Мобильной Машины","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Although the contributions of T helper 17 (Th17) cells (a subtype of CD4(+) T lymphocytes) to autoimmunity and allergy response are well known, their roles in cancer remain ambiguous. Despite adoptive transfer studies indicating that mouse Th17 cells support anticancer immunity, the Th17 cells that naturally infiltrate experimental tumors appear to have a tumor-promoting effect. These contradictory properties can be related to the high degree of plasticity inherent in Th17 cells and their capacity to differentiate into tumoricidal Th1-like cells. Mouse Th17 cells induced by transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) express CD39 and CD73 ectonucleotidases on their surfaces, which leads to adenosine release and suppression of T cell immunity. Here, we discuss how TGF-β acts as a molecular switch controlling the immunoregulatory properties of Th17 cells.","inCitations":["1aab1792f424d2d5f54bc3edfa62c09263315265","9483c8b882ca8c0a01f31629755035921351fc0b","77df699aff22409ac9e3332b6983fbae23d39690","a44e4b10bf66981bbaf60b4ba5a4f59c04993413","6d2d8be1add3ebe5d145aa5410fbf084cdf59445","27adf5b0761511e15032c32e9dd62ce997f15475","0e77ad40f70c80d71c26820f761b2283c6b120e1","c820fa887150a8624f3ea7fe937f8ee8a24b4b70","2a025a3d345a0add00986d97c4a0e979cda234ac","91e375e6b859bc033fbd56f0a23dcf18fd3be555","c7509615eb5943e3fd7743c2b113fb4a288f81f1","dad0b9735c08a5c819f34e2f0a0d9bc823074c5d","61aeb8a32a601d5b499c0add8d3a8d7c73288652","290af0c6d4d63840097f0a2b6cfaf6a35ce55a90","a3eb7be5bef3f49331b7fc12bd225896224e8a71","80a9534fb09f703f2a66f35688a81f3ebc86aaa8","7fb3cf44dd393dd5e0419f956e93cf748bf6fc5a","c35e659121ad407c4bafc82b1937465bcdfa7e45","1859a1892eaacafaba3f8b9b300a22a6c6a93883","f19d87cc578d0957b4b4f6006c44d1702de8fa5f","664ca348a2c4f2bc62ad7f544748a325e9d7d875","074098eb6a3a9612f6d7a93be1ebf0299c95bea0","c39abe27929d09bb1f7c525a66ff6b8d3251e9e2","f7b47c826e1d3b3fe14c0352d5f6b12fb1adfca8","2dff0d7c166387e6abdf8af20072657199574db5","a960df2707c38580a810ee4fbe6b6002e8cf8ad8","73fdd744ef5490029a81805054ddd4868d5f2fe3","df0456a7a02eadcb3ca6fa99a7e26d0a057a4018","606b30d71006d97ce9e932f45a98f5d467407a5e","a5dfca83111c51df453de5bf12fe790daf384fdd","c6934325869ea418bc6734aed79424c68dd3e245","defa729e9b56f3cd264cd4ee9006f13e56207134","222f8d25eb8a6d9cd2115647e2e8daa974737c02","d57002da819268b3cb11f34fa619e038dd168bb4","f5f524845e7692ecfee2b9649d829b858af2a81d","5753da157baaf3ed5ae3472252507a006bdebca4","3daba9f23e88b8cfd3261d99a4bdca225153584a","a259cd83e233d448d467c91ac6f877f289fc6b0b","a1cf9e7d9e3415099732cf7266c86c33200ffe4b","ea387a10446774933fa524a4c3a4d4cd3e8886c0","9b60132be4c4e7217a2ba1e7382101f7d93de742","7210c09f56c3be9f5cb2025e70de9ef48b0e0eb4"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Controversies on the role of Th17 in cancer: a TGF-β-dependent immunosuppressive activity?","doi":"10.1016/j.molmed.2012.09.007","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molmed.2012.09.007","venue":"Trends in molecular medicine"}

These covariance matrix estimators are typically associated with different computer algorithms. For example, with the Newton–Raphson algorithm the inverse of the negative of the Hessian matrix from the log-likelihood function is used; with the method of scoring the inverse of the information matrix is used; and with a procedure proposed by Berndt, Hall, Hall, and Hausman (1974), the inverse of the outer product of the first derivatives of the log-likelihood function is used. Although these three estimators are asymptotically equivalent, their performance can vary in finite samples. The main objective of this article is to use a Monte Carlo experiment to investigate the finite sample properties of the three covariance matrix estimators, in the context of maximum likelihood estimation of the pr...","inCitations":["23d0519aa824295ac3798965c7cf715d4c8d98b3","5b3b9fe128e6849d59a26d7ceda57baad2524815","1250f42cd8ac08e877f9049bd485f7072f798d7e","0da42aeed623b4b3b2a7d6bcc30eb2b972971d32","8a69b60749f7d516bb8c28342107aca7051ca4f3","9a51653278a1a67d07178445cdbfaeaa844148b3","537fea53f7cbb8ad6e5e347316f0ec2c2e6ad7f8","05aa1459ff7e3b5e795f08c139e46690201e1325","cc6f84837a831b68ff91e1e28a7ead3a428520e1","b653cf5e9fabd1140346d7f79b35c6677f29116d","82988886a24c6124810718063299bdafe09ef10f","b0c8d90de815b2791a3a13c8afb6eb576bb2cca0","8d44dc500fc6eec7665a22dadfbd7aebb2b83179","b8037dde8bba6b2b6d7493438c0ec7c35db13c1f","be913c61b2c4e976d35641d4826d40011de90856","c8226d45e274f796501cf9f6af458ac632f98d93","c254a98bd2a587a11e1c1b6c28e015eaea25deb1","137bbfd36b598eaabc35fc2556f2311096a31e6a","cc787792be84c1129556ec7acfa5decfb5b7d022","384b6f8761c1d056ccb37b90fea41158fae2a724","75e66b41cdfa46cc519a353b20636ccbbf0a8575","448f97988b58022da3bf0a2cfd2b7efc299e350c","b0dd29d64ef6701b1529978aae8cac6c2a0d821d","91ae4c294fcab7e849497bd8780dd460429ae896","9b45d29215d3db59bc3e45e0b874e7a5dd7e9a71","9d359b4e3d97d7bdf007b6af208a0436d02953f6","b8c4e70f663b05ecd81a7fe85616395b0b87971f","3c5702afdbd39d4ed01a77c096366f23b8e2f16a","719e1ac7dd62a62ac2b019ad30792f4d8042fe16","0cc368c9fa945bcc21f2611bfdde12082e3f31f1","fe5d91d1033ff00c9cf5a869dbd3bf462c47d92d"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Small Sample Properties of Probit Model Estimators","doi":"10.1080/01621459.1987.10478519","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1080/01621459.1987.10478519","venue":""}

With this knowledge, the cores and the accelerators in the CHP can use on-chip scratchpad memory (SPM) and buffers to directly manage the data replacement in order to save off-chip memory bandwidth. We propose efficient schemes to hybrid the SPM and primary caches, and to also hybrid buffers and the shared last-level cache (LLC). In the hybrid primary cache, due to its low associativity, the problem of balancing the cache set utilization when the SPM is allocated in the cache is critical. We propose an adaptive hybrid cache (AH-Cache) to dynamically remap SPM blocks from high-demand cache sets to low-demand cache sets. In the hybrid LLC (typically designed as a nonuniform cache architecture, NUCA), the problem of resource contention and fragmentation becomes crucial. We propose a buffer-in-NUCA (BiN) scheme to assign shared buffer spaces to accelerators that can best utilize the additional buffer space, and use flexible paged buffer allocation to limit the impact of buffer fragmentation.In domain-specific computing, the communication pattern can be also obtained through offline analysis. With this knowledge, the topology and routing scheme in the CHP communication subsystem can be customized to dynamically adapt to the known communication pattern. For the topology customization, we propose application-specific shortcuts and multicast realized by radio frequency interconnects (RF-I) overlaid network-on-chip (NoC). At runtime, we can flexibly allocate RF-I bandwidth to adapt the NoC topology to the known communication requirement of an application. For the routing customization, we propose an power-efficient application-specific cycle elimination and splitting (ACES) routing scheme to avoid restricting the critical routes of an application while achieving deadlock-free for irregular NoCs.To further demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of these techniques, we develop a FPGA prototype of the proposed CHP with shared accelerators and buffers. The buffer sharing is achieved through a cost-efficient partial-crossbar to reduce the sharing overhead on timing and area.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://www.base-search.net/Record/52fb492246ba6966545ff809629bdbf460915910311bebafa3c16c6d684fb142"],"title":"Architecture Support for Customizable Domain-Specific Computing","doi":"","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

The average weight per bird at the start of the experiment was 500grams above. Antibiotics, coccidiostat and vaccinations were administered periodically as required. The experiment lasted for 0 6 weeks. Data obtained were subjected to Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) and significant means were separated using Duncan's Multiple Range Test at 5% level of significance. The experiment lasted for 6 weeks. The results indicated that weight gain, final body weight gain, feed consumption and feed to gain ratios were not significantly affected by dietary treatment. The metabolisable energy (ME) intake was significantly affected by dietary treatments. Protein intake was not significantly affected by dietary treatment. It increased with increases in PKC level of diet. There was no mortality during this period.

The citrus flatid planthopper (CFP; Metcalfa pruinosa (Say, 1830)) is an invasive species in many countries. Predicting potential occurrence areas of the species related to environmental conditions is important for effective forest ecosystem management. In this study, we evaluated the occurrence patterns of the CFP and predicted its potential occurrence areas in South Korea using a random forest model for a hazard rating of forests considering meteorological and landscape variables. We obtained the occurrence data of the CFP in South Korea from literature and government documents and extracted seven environmental variables (altitude, slope, distance to road (geographical), annual mean temperature, minimum temperature in January, maximum temperature in July, and annual precipitation (meteorological)) and the proportion of land cover types across seven categories (urban, agriculture, forest, grassland, wetland, barren, and water) at each occurrence site from digital maps using a Geographic Information System. The CFP occurrence areas were mostly located at low altitudes, near roads and urbanized areas. Our prediction model also supported these results. The CFP has a high potential to be distributed over the whole of South Korea, excluding high mountainous areas. Finally, factors related to human activities, such as roads and urbanization, strongly influence the occurrence and dispersal of the CFP. Therefore, we propose that these factors should be considered carefully in monitoring and surveillance programs for the CFP and other invasive species.","inCitations":["99476416216a720b1eb535f2d46e01216d5e2170","20a07618a9369b16a14d0c35c4348e39827c8471","d8641d02174213c8de4d8d4e268f8cb2f22227ce"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Occurrence Prediction of the Citrus Flatid Planthopper (Metcalfa pruinosa (Say, 1830)) in South Korea Using a Random Forest Model","doi":"10.3390/f10070583","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.3390/f10070583","venue":""}

Sixteen patients with descending thoracic aortic dissection, intimal disruption close to the subclavian artery, and extension of the dissection into the aortic arch or the ascending aorta are described here: Eleven patients underwent surgical repair including 9 emergency (82%) and 2 elective (18%) procedures. Retrograde aortic dissection included the aortic arch in 11 of 11 patients (100%) and the ascending aorta in 7 of 11 (63%). Pericardial effusion was present in 1 of 11 patients (9%) and mild aortic regurgitation was found in 1 of 11 (9%). Repair of the ascending aorta and arch with transaortic closure of the entrance tear in the descending thoracic aorta was performed in 4 of 11 patients (36%) via a median sternotomy. In 6 of 11 patients (55%) a lateral thoracotomy was used for repair of the descending thoracic aorta and closure of the entrance tear. Hospital mortality occurred in 1 of 11 patients (9%) and there was 1 late death. Paraplegia occurred in 1 of 11 patients (9%). Five patients with descending thoracic aortic dissection, intimal disruption close to the subclavian artery, and extension into the ascending aorta but without ascending aortic aneurysm (diameter 4.2 +/- 0.2 cm), pericardial effusion, or aortic incompetence were treated medically without early mortality. These results are compared with those achieved in 120 patients operated on during the same period for type A (89/120) and type B (31/120) aortic dissections. Considering the technical difficulties of simultaneous repair of dissections of the ascending and the descending thoracic aorta, we recommend that descending thoracic aortic dissection extending into the arch or the ascending aorta be managed in accordance with the site of the predominant lesion. Replacement of the arch with a varying portion of ascending aorta via a median sternotomy is recommended in patients with enlarged aortic diameter, pericardial effusion, and/or aortic insufficiency. Predominantly distal dissections with dilated descending thoracic aorta and/or distal complications are best approached via a lateral thoracotomy.","inCitations":["523f236a3b2ddcc72591fd88c25d2f7f602b9de2","9a5075d07595bf08d2256a72c4c3234415bff3f3","c032276b2b7d2db4647b68fc73bba8449b4045b3","e88b76bd5d94ff898de108f24e36d1fc05089fa9","7f9359fceb365588f79546f44433f6bb2573ac85","ad2e11817051d057e74241b68f969fbb524a1b83","e4c698756791653d547966f3a8705df3f3444317","904c049b584b366ca35960a9f697f3977c39bf90","6f4e948f63b5ce7c487534cb375fa73c766aba4e","5bece18b4f25d1de0d3506d2b4d6e028a4e9ad42","d22557f99faf824157064578c0504e067dae7ee9","7dbcf9a9e8759c83f70082dcf607d96cb3262833","af10cf0ddb2c417993daaf79979a508163ebc6c0","b865afd4dcf6426e06f4a2d5687aedd3ff7d43fb","76f6e565aa9500a12b1fc740b3c7faae535ca37c","c215235992fac712b4c70633afd686ce29e0cf32","cc78eb8041afbd77284a4b3da23e0fc33e7fdfe4","e165fd2ff15e7e260ee630d1aeaabb8a66399242","dcb7e75f46ca4f1b6b8f76cd3d63cf1f28014cd0","9fb4ac9dd9d268380951292511e1ff324a8dfff1","8b9e05c692c21588001e89d498041f284d3871b8"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Dissection of the descending thoracic aorta extending into the ascending aorta.

The technique provides a foundation for optimizing algorithms that detect ground movers in SAR imagery. The video SAR mode provides a persistent view of a scene centered at the Motion Compensation Point (MCP). The radar platform follows a circular flight path. Detecting a stationary shadow in a SAR image is important because the shadow indicates a detection of an object with a height component near the shadow. Similarly, the detection of a shadow that moves from frame to frame indicates the detection of a ground mover at the location of the moving shadow. An approach analyzes the impact of windowing in calculating the brightness of a pixel in a stationary, finite-sized shadow region. An extension of the approach describes the pixel brightness for a moving shadow as a function of its velocity. The pixel brightness provides an upper bound on the Probability of Detection (PD) and a lower bound on the Probability of False Alarm (PFA) for a finite-sized, stationary or moving shadow in the presence of homogeneous, ideal clutter. Synthetic data provides shadow characteristics for a radar scenario that lend themselves for detecting a ground mover.

Researchers have found that for platinum metal supported on ceria and doped ceria in the automobile exhaust catalyst, atomic Pt-Ox-Ce species are the active WGS reaction sites. More recently, preparations of gold at the nanoscale have shown that this relatively \"new material\" is an active and often more selective catalyst than platinum for a variety of reactions, including the WGS reaction. The activity of gold is typically attributed to a size effect, while the interface of gold with the support has also been reported as important for oxidation reactions, but exactly how this comes about has not been probed satisfactorily. Typical supported metal catalysts prepared by traditional techniques have a heterogeneous population of particles, nanoclusters, subnanometer species, and isolated atoms/ions on the support surfaces, making the identification of the active sites difficult. Both we and other researchers have clearly shown that gold nanoparticles are spectator species in the WGS reaction. Evidence has now amassed that the gold active site for the WGS reaction is atomic, that is, Au-Ox species catalyze the reaction, similar to Pt-Ox. In this Account, we review the relevant literature to conclude that the intrinsic activity of the Au-Ox(OH)-S site, where S is a support, is the same for any S. The support effect is indirect, through its carrying (or binding) capacity for the active sites. Destabilization of the gold under reducing conditions through the formation of clusters and nanoparticles is accompanied by a measurable activity loss. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate the destabilizing effect of different reaction gas mixtures on the gold atom sites and to consider regeneration methods that effectively redisperse the gold clusters into atoms. For gold catalysts, we can remove weakly bound clusters and nanoparticles from certain supports by leaching techniques. Because of this, we can prepare a uniform dispersion of gold atoms/ions strongly bound to the support surface by this two-step (loading followed by leaching) approach. Presently, one-step preparation methods to maximize the number of the single atom sites on various supports need to be developed, specific to the type of the selected support. Often, it will be beneficial to alter the surface properties of the support to enhance metal ion anchoring, for example, by shape and size control of the support or by the use of light-assisted deposition and anchoring of the metal on photoresponsive supports. Because of their importance for practical catalyst development, synthesis methods are discussed at some length in this Account.","inCitations":["dd59f9b0624fc84dd6a87d481c2e2a37b7db79e6","192c01e17d85a3dc57bdd85a20720fb7a17165d6","1de2fd4a1a0065241cfbe3980c9f022ba2e822c7","d890178927a11c3fae14371e47980110462d7982","79e074e42fcf60b62e71d9f9158991cadbe310a7","a15802ad5a929b6a2ae6a9ee939dd7dec9906022","8d3452ea47df5eea01e9b5c3a8e8f2cdf6bf532c","ca89b0a35bc11027e43fdc53b91f99cb629f08a1","11aeaf229359fdb655155f495a706440d178e488","a030b7491d9504909239e367d136da186a45f820","f5ac5b19fc5e5c99426cb35b0ed15227d618b027","be90b98d3bb8c7ebebfcd9f642e6426f724ea674","7214dbdf3946bdb63446b678107ff41ab1b3e325","4b5489850fa8239e10075b97f2778abfe30a7586","7b141644fda1666988f7ea1ef327847bc9a0361a","f6d1d9ab7a2d1a0d6907d745ecdc25c21bd5a62a","e2e376833b5aff1abdf1ec2065620702cd60f633","4b18c04cc4a5462fb1da7cdf792edf9e4d65152f","cedc71d33767c3130f50563faf44e935b125866c","6171c9edb8d6481f1514f4360b5afeac1bdd1dd5","5521abaef1e0be40d0ba9a01e7806ab37c0de75c","5ca4862b25ecc82d998cad7bf3b53522ec436173","9a346547b24d572ae1ae35ae5b895649d41a6206","fe91af08bea33c47493141a7e65a01f3d634ebd9","9f15322fcd0b06eeb60dabd34af9ee89e21e3d71","7ef4a37c4f5933ddcd8aff5c33bb0018150c35ae","7a961d0401d63c80e249e106b34fe3a09d207e92","1b994e9303582b5911e7efbe26432beba7bed011","9dc57c3418d94d206a0bbd7acfb6c2ccbb416cbb","7cb20594efad2ff4acf4150c9a92c73640556a8b","f69a4fda7c4e6494a5fb5d0fe6ed6d137dab0253","bb737b93b50e2c3491f2217d1945ecc63adb2aa1","6f07e1d6592ff68f45a2b2aca5a589525b715dad","545de4e4d24bc0a119e522eb3a84a07e318aa664","886844e322638e19a8ec4c15f7766f86173e8166","b887f01cce2e997753b3bcf74dd19baf6d38c3b3","040d856d40eb623f7879d7b7a55cdeb74e9cca6b","3cccfb52495cba1ca3b5f97e94aa8ee72d65185d"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Gold atoms stabilized on various supports catalyze the water-gas shift reaction.","doi":"10.1021/ar4001845","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1021/ar4001845","venue":"Accounts of chemical research"}

However, current data suggest increased daily consumption of fructose which may lead to an increased incidence of diseases such as obesity, diabetes and co-morbidities associated with excess weight. Thus, the objective of the present study was to assess the effect of the ingestion of different fructose sources on weight gain, glycemia and serum triglyceride levels in rats.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThe study was conducted on male Wistar rats divided into 5 groups according to the source and concentration of fructuse (ingested AD LIBITUM in liquid form).\n\n\nRESULTS\nDrink intake was increased and chow consumption was reduced in all groups compared to control ( P<0.05). The animals of the groups receiving 10 and 20% fructose solutions showed increased triglyceride levels and the 20% group also showed weight gain. The exaggerate consumption of fructose promotes a reduced consumption of chow, an increase in serum triglyceride levels, and weight gain in some animals.","inCitations":["e97cf824c3dee1b48c4852dad417d591c5d65885","821d422bef15bb54e8688cded289cd5681b443fb","7e9a41c761b5de5840508f91e2a27135c8d3986e","fcc642c2e579efa07a81a57e7e3629796e4b7dec","8e9ec9accb7536772838d77d4e15ef025fea77bd","845144950f5a6d9f4c629f1ca0c05dc169914c81","105d71ab8a5b048eee523312685d8fce77b659d6","7348d03604a9cde8201f3881fc35d43c3a70cb93","3d62eb2862e6842e105df6079609da6e5f333c35","1d803345a96df0e35691c4365c3a1ebc70ea5a90","0ee76b18635c9d5834684fd683eb43dcf9078dbf","209b3f6d910a63b1e306c38e00989efeb97fffe7"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Metabolic effects of the ingestion of different fructose sources in rats.","doi":"10.1055/s-0031-1275276","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0031-1275276","venue":"Experimental and clinical endocrinology & diabetes : official journal, German Society of Endocrinology [and] German Diabetes Association"}

Our field surveys were carried out during the 11-month's period from April 2001 to February 2002 and the correlations between nitrogen concentrations and catchment characteristics were studied. The results showed that the vegetation cover was strongly correlated to total nitrogen (TN) and nitrate + nitrite − nitrogen (NOx-N) concentrations. That is, the TN and NOx-N concentrations had positive correlations with mean normalized difference vegetation cover index (NDVI) of each sub-area during dormant seasons (mean NDVI soil > topography > land use, and the best models can account for 55–64% of the variance of TN and NOx-N concentrations.

Production of CXCL8 was exquisitely sensitive to inhibition by co-treatment with the beta(2) agonist sabutamol (IC(50)=1.1 nM). The inhibitory effect of salbutamol was beta receptor-mediated since the effect was prevented by the beta antagonist sotalol. Salbutamol also elevated intracellular levels of cAMP (EC(50)=82 nM) but the relationship to the inhibition of CXCL8 secretion was not clear-cut since much higher concentrations of salbutamol were required to elevate total cellular cAMP than inhibit CXCL8 production. However, the effect of salbutamol is likely to be mediated by elevation of cAMP since forskolin, an adenylyl cyclase activator, mimicked the effects of salbutamol while the adenylyl cyclase inhibitor 2',5'-dideoxyadenosine inhibited the effects of salbutamol. Potentiation of cAMP production by co-treatment with the phosphodiesterase type 4 inhibitor rolipram only marginally enhanced the inhibitory effect of salbutamol on CXCL8 production. Taken together, these data suggest that elevation of cAMP production is required for the inhibitory effect of salbutamol on CXCL8 production by keratinocytes and that low threshold levels of cAMP are sufficient to mediate this effect.","inCitations":["0872075900edf3c8486bb69c0f2aefe8c37bc08c","78aaf5cabc606e21d09909553944822c0b242b43"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Salbutamol inhibits trypsin-mediated production of CXCL8 by keratinocytes.","doi":"10.1016/j.cyto.2006.10.008","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cyto.2006.10.008","venue":"Cytokine"}

Comput.","paperAbstract":"In this paper we introduce a technique for developing efficient iterated local search procedures and we apply it to solve very large instances of the Euclidean Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). This technique, which we call perturbation, uses global information on TSP instances to speed-up the computation and to improve the quality of the tours found by heuristic methods. The main idea is to escape from local optima by introducing perturbations in the problem instance rather than in the solution. The performance of our algorithms has been tested and compared with known methods. To this end, we have executed a number of experiments both on available benchmarks, for which the optimal tour length is known, and on randomly generated instances, for which the comparison is done with the Held-Karp lower bound. The experimental results, performed on up to 100,000 cities, show that our algorithms outperform the known methods for iterating local search for very large instances.","inCitations":["4f1ab451ebca1c3f0f2723d0bdc89f44d0609858","96f50d4fdec8aaec1d3486223fcd3e5e3d0098d2","9e120b32e290576d60add15868e9d7b132bb30ef","729b0718bde7af748cdbbc29b3b9973e18ba6c7c","6fc0f8d17371f4e41da6b04cb0b3430f9d7d754b","2a7932f3d3ed04bb95efc4c00c4d5cff21425a16","13e1e2b4aeee604afa13ce45d0bec0c5894a8727","993dba2e9acec454f3293fc68a14af16dd269d2f","5c13ea30c4d7d9b1d474e7312a959bf631de155c","a5132765048cdcb7dfc28ece6a41fa844bf2572e","fdc3337295699608e7102dbbcfc0c14f5e7fa36f","289ceae2c454e77c4affdce6f1fcbe47f8e44f8d","fa3ca6097d302ff48cf91664d11e0df3514e9d0c","c7caeb614cba94577949ce96d695621f1a3c03e0","bf5f219b979803db8073ed72a3b455039392c21e","3f87b5833546ddac7fadaa53f140abe4e84ba9df","1e57023f8bcd8cf362e6323b0afcb42c8831580e","6dfed3d1a1e9993ba1feadd0b0591012dc58acf1","88d8b6be3960bfe22578f3df0e148d69692a2bde","82acd8963188d514cb27d4d51abddb0064a01ea8","05889841a76a77a7ff628e5a0d8fecd990c2ed29","db08cc7af6177be7c08554ad83853c8fb23ca58f","f1b6f4fcf35b2009a7464e0af1bf209b614c6cac","49540cbea4400164a566e1705a5e314d22e2f90c","b71f7f58a798788e57ae48d2dcb1ff81d3d65151","352f58e7a277232af83c44df55923fc36c8b4b71","626b5785f451ab1b64988254afafd7637194dc99","1615d5d32c2e89d7d979739e1f847f090d07b945","692f7420c38e45121eee949d271337ca0f370668","ff55976d625c5ae6234c5c767a87402a06eb3a43","cc03cf5ed6149965ae33b1da2b3dfc3eedb5bb0f","4e92275892d758ac2fc987c698d323817692504c","06c4ed3585b264bae13c872ea03e8d8f0f33c74b","d4e1b8cb325ac92931fa3b7aa2bca61a1dbf0811","218680f8dc5304676efefc65d5dc732014c46654","7b49556f62561a1450564d336c6c0ba612046c7d","42fdc7aa664736e3fcf8b5aa31fbb60f02f92702","31aea33833d568f4d63dd46a775aac05307cfd8e","b4ecf844780a634f62fffd21449310ab558258c9","939d7cb3c770df9cc9be770f31e4bf90d6ef30e8","2210d4c2694894da361baf9175ac358970b58033","13bb1a80a497bd6faeb183d283f2e921698993ce","4a3b1f1904670dfe0224c9c92ca931ca7671ac2b","c8b477bed9e7a18567703d3edf417d2416a0459e","8ea72a55da91fbea5ccfdd19481aebc32b6dea68","4b3001a50d0acce7c5c656a30ef4111f18a8c3f0"],"pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1287/ijoc.8.2.125","ftp://ftp.icsi.berkeley.edu/pub/techreports/1993/tr-93-035.ps.gz"],"title":"Perturbation: An Efficient Technique for the Solution of Very Large Instances of the Euclidean TSP","doi":"10.1287/ijoc.8.2.125","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1287/ijoc.8.2.125","venue":"INFORMS J.

Based on assumptions from steam and scald injury, a sophisticated device equipped with a hot air jet was used [2], which is considered as modified version of the first one [3]. Surprisingly, by using the new machine the authors stated that 2 other animals (2/40) suffered an ear perforation due to an overly deep burn (117 2.1 8C for 1 s) on day 1. However, with the old moderate technique (56 8C for 100 s), none of the animals (0/9) was excluded from the study [3]. Although many advantages of the new machine (time saving, easily controlled, high temperature) are available, the adverse effect (overly deep burn) cannot be neglected. Even worse, due to inherent differences in experimenters, some animals (relatively deep burn) that should have been excluded, were included in the study. Here, we think that diminishing high temperature and extending the burn period may be a stable way for monitoring the physiological indices. Secondly, we want to share our advice about venular blood flow. The authors did not prove possible significant differences in the study groups (Fig. 5) [1]. The accuracy of measurement in velocities above 0.7 mm/s may not be acceptable, and may be the reason for the changes seen [2]. Here, we recommend the Laser Doppler flowmetry for microcirculation monitoring. Firstly, this is an easy-to-use noninvasive real-time measurement method of local tissue blood. For another, data shows that doppler variance imaging is capable of differentiating the normal and the aggregated blood components, indicating the precision and sensitivity [4]. However, no matter which method was applied, I suggest, for reliable blood physiological data the hair on ears of a nude mouse should be gently removed [5], which was ignored in the articles [1–3].","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Concerns about stability and accuracy of a burn model.","doi":"10.1016/j.burns.2011.06.011","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.burns.2011.06.011","venue":"Burns : journal of the International Society for Burn Injuries"}

The three groups were recruited from an aging and dementia research center and were composed of well-characterized physically healthy volunteers, with similar ages and gender distributions. The outcome measures included 16 motor/psychomotor tests categorized a priori into gross, fine, and complex, as well as eight cognitive tests of memory and language. Relative to the NL group, MI individuals performed poorly on cognitive, fine, and complex motor measures but not on gross motor tests; AD patients performed worse on cognitive and all motor domains. Differences in complex motor function persisted after adjustment for performance on cognitive and on less complex motor tests. Classification analyses showed similar accuracies in discriminating NL from MI and NL from AD cases for both complex motor (79% and 92% accuracy, respectively) and cognitive tests (80% and 93% accuracy, respectively). Less complex motor tests produced poorer accuracies. Among nondemented subjects, education correlated with several cognitive scores but no motor scores. These results indicate that motor impairment is an important aspect of cognitive decline in older adults. Motor/psychomotor assessments were found to be comparably sensitive to traditional tests of cognitive function in identifying persons affected by the earliest stages of AD pathology and may improve identification of at-risk nondemented elderly, especially among diversely educated individuals.","inCitations":["9e5d95510480627cf2195101f51bc7609b27c2fb","e3c9647c522cc801a856e9d946d1467bba2f2c46","17224e3c5446e387f9583566fec5359ae4ea3017","c7c9dff31cbb1401f2df69830df4c23de5fdb315","79c0bb614935be835598998dcefc707d49d033aa","197e0128073ce2d95d0cd655d4e6ed993c13ea5a","cd911db0c03e5b5fca07f7788d083b6b3597d378","d7049cccfae59a6a03f856c1d7a4a23ad9f17fa6","7bfc6f19696eb2c1ea0400c6b89f7fbcb68fcf57","fe989684b50b4e1191be4f1dbc47cafdd31317b5","d0df2c5b0f0d906724d9a9628a6dc9313983afb2","1eaac2f59a2bc70b87a47a15927f73fd3e1a8454","47afad4a2ff163ae68ae9be64d0c561748ed2680","339639db0da0430b3492c5c76e053c3bbce2644c","28dbd4d8ce2fabd196d50e3ada461437a382b3d8","bd3ec50959b211f5d38088ae64cc054bb1c61e88","7931cb1eeb737ef782780593d3af946cd5920bfa","ea1801cc54e300b4b2a124867ceb0a03bfdf5fec","67dba08a23bf859203618c756392447958b7fd96","30ed64591252bd08da2d269ff02c3a5a6d4faeda","1c6e2b3ae596cddfb40feb2ffb80aa7fb81665b3","fa082b702647282b1ba7c2265a2aac42c4a2cad5","c42dc75ddbbcb2b8c702befb19027763c6b1fae6","154bd1e1138d119995d6aeff0f76ee6ba3256f9c","793f797cfc8545b43f90e3704aaf71ead0f71f6d","c0de50e71de78c043264fb7dcbb92608480c9438","b2173a98df417b0641c4d0b0ba395393b08e1fad","2da0fb3eb96e166ddf183fe7d7fb85fd1c78e170","83b5bc970a68ad761a4bbb7bbaf2472fa3ad8214","b1f57b8eed64e6ff260f3870686f86e24b19c059","40e4f43ad37cf91f00712cb10e3fba99a023ef09","086387cd5bd473e4a2a327118951e746a74a0b1c","4e8e42ff7246fdb78b4ea0666330716e25dd35c5","3876d41b06252bef116e9510a40c3adc69e60595","45ff2561f54e25b205b8a4db8e67d86640be2094","54726a12d6afaa916bbf7ba4976f98a48aead394","98791be0db18f2bbefd0f5c423aaad600f11556f","61402983c48ced6961570adc6d3890fcf2d9536e","0f7bce91b78049ea539f9b276d12843d9ab59364","0dbcf03cf75a5f3d01c3ce2bf36400569a298c76","cf58f557091537f417202862e933e142e5fd4215","2c0e086b5a0e743174c9cff2cb90c441d17dbdcf","f3807498988bc64a2ac2515c190928c33b5c3d88"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Motor/psychomotor dysfunction in normal aging, mild cognitive decline, and early Alzheimer's disease: diagnostic and differential diagnostic features.","doi":"10.1017/S1041610297005048","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1017/S1041610297005048","venue":"International psychogeriatrics"}

We propose a new log-based recovery approach, which can tolerate multiple node failures. The recovery approach employs an independent checkpointing technique and a new logging scheme. The independent checkpointing technique periodically interrupts the execution of a node to save the node’s state. The new logging scheme takes advantage of the DSM’s unique properties to reduce the logging overhead. Based on the proposed recovery approach, the pre-failure state of a faulty node can be deterministically created without involving any fault-free node. In addition, some consistency information may be lost after a node becomes faulty. To reconstruct the lost consistency information, we also present an efficient consistency reconstruction method in this paper. Finally, extensive trace-driven simulations are performed to show the effectiveness of the new logging scheme.","inCitations":["9fd06bc4ca016e2d0b6e1e8e0f4317b9434846af"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.iis.sinica.edu.tw/page/jise/2000/200003_06.pdf","http://www.iis.sinica.edu.tw/JISE/2000/200003_06.pdf","http://www.iis.sinica.edu.tw/page/jise/2000/200003_06.html"],"title":"A New Log-Based Approach to Independent Recovery in Distributed Shraed Memory Systems","doi":"","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"J.

Unlike other known missile guidance laws being used today, the new t-∆v guidance law optimally trades an interceptor’s onboard fuel capacity against time-to-go before impact. In particular, this guidance law allows a missile designer to program the interceptor to maximally impact a boosting missile before burnout or burn termination and thus negating its ability to achieve the maximum kinetic velocity. For an intercontinental range ballistic missile (ICBM), it can be shown that for every second of earlier intercept prior to burnout, the ICBM ground range is reduced by ∼350 km. Therefore, intercepting a mere 15 seconds earlier would result in a miss of 5,250 km from the intended target or approximately a distance across the continental United States. This paper also shows how the t-∆v guidance law can incorporate uncertainties in target burnout time, predicted intercept point (PIP) error, time-to-go error, and other track estimation errors. We believe that the t-∆v guidance law is a step toward the development of a new and smart missile guidance law that would enhance the probability of achieving a boost phase intercept","inCitations":["e402eadd7be6648c7c2735afa7465120281fdb9e","48337508df0b9c36079f787cd42d690e7ef23ddf"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a408931.pdf"],"title":"An Optimal t-∆ v Guidance Law for Intercepting a Boosting Target","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Applications are increasing despite the fact that many parameters influencing the simulation results are not yet thoroughly understood, even in the “simple” case of incompressible turbulent flow. When further physical processes are studied, like pollutant dispersion or wind driven rain or snow, the situation is even worse. Nevertheless a lot can be learned from the published simulation results, concerning best practice in the area of wind engineering. This paper summarizes the results from published simulations and tries to distil recommendations for the use of CFD in wind engineering tasks, focussing on the statistically steady simulation of

We argue that some of the inconsistencies arise because bids for public environmental goods in contingent valuation surveys are often (at least partly) motivated by moral considerations and ethical beliefs. We analyse the expected results of CV surveys given the existence of such ethical motivations, including the valuation of actions as well as states. It is found that we cannot expect bids made on this basis to reveal preferences which obey the rules commonly assumed in the theory of consumer choice. The two standard reactions to these anomalies have been to attack the validity of the method, or to urge greater rigour in survey design and application. By contrast, we conclude that the usefulness of the method for evaluating options concerning environmental public goods depends critically on the problem definition. The method should be used for the direct evaluation of realistic policy packages, rather than to try to extract abstract values for invaluable goods. The conclusion accords with current trends, including the move towards the use of deliberative methodologies.","inCitations":["ef478d230b55e31988dddf7e0c860c137e5d295c","31973f25019d973024bb3f73afff71d1fd30fd15","17d846b574a07cac3a7a5dd513714dbb9f655dc7"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.environmentandsociety.org/sites/default/files/key_docs/ev_10no.2_hart_rob__uwe_latacz-lohmann.pdf","http://www.environmentandsociety.org/printpdf/5828"],"title":"The Indifference Curve, Motivation, and Morality in Contingent Valuation","doi":"10.3197/096327101129340813","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.3197/096327101129340813","venue":""}

In WBAN, ECC overhead can be comparable to transmit power because of the extremely short transmission distance. Therefore, as the most power-hungry component, ECC decoder should be carefully designed. In this letter, we first present an exploration for energy efficient ECC decoder in various practical scenarios of WBAN. A framework is proposed for the exploration based on an energy efficiency model of WBAN, in which all significant parameters within the design space are considered. Taking advantage of the model, we evaluate the energy efficiency of WBAN nodes when type-II Chase soft-decision decoder or hard-decision decoder is utilized. The exploration determines energy-efficient decoder for each scenario and shows that energy-efficient decoder can achieve as much as 80% higher energy efficiency than the alternative.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1109/ASICON.2015.7517208"],"title":"Exploration for energy-efficient ECC decoder of WBAN","doi":"10.1109/ASICON.2015.7517208","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASICON.2015.7517208","venue":"2015 IEEE 11th International Conference on ASIC (ASICON)"}

The validity of the combined model in actual prediction is tested by Lorenz chaotic time series. Simulation experiments show that the combined prediction model is significantly better than these two single-item prediction models in terms of prediction accuracy, which verifies that the proposed combination model has good prediction performance.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://pdf.hanspub.org/HJDM20200100000_57813351.pdf"],"title":"Combined Prediction Based on Chaotic Linear Regression and Elman Neural Network","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Diseno: consta de 2 fases: revision panoramica (Scoping Review) y estudio observacional de corte. Fuentes de datos: Academic Search Premier, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Psyclist, PubMed, Cochrane Library, Epistemonikos, Lilacs, ENFISPO, BVS, Academic Emergency Medicine, The Journal of Emergency Medicine, IME. Metodos de la revision: se utilizaron diversas palabras clave para seleccionar estudios descriptivos observacionales sobre la deteccion del MTI. La cobertura temporal fue desde 2007 a 2013, en idioma ingles y espanol. Metodos del estudio: se analizaron las historias clinicas correspondientes al periodo 2008-2011 cuya codificacion diagnostica estuviera relacionada con un posible caso de MTI. Resultados: se encontraron 503 articulos de los cuales se han seleccionado 77 articulos de texto completo del ano 2007 en adelante y 22 referencias a articulos en la Biblioteca Virtual de la Salud (BVS). La formacion del personal y el uso de cuestionarios de deteccion han demostrado utilidad en el aumento de hallazgos de nuevos casos. En el estudio realizado tambien se detecto una prevalencia de MTI similar a la del resto de estudios. El tipo de MTI predominantemente encontrado en los servicios de urgencias hospitalarios es el maltrato fisico y el abuso sexual; el que mas se produce pero menos se detecta es la negligencia y en nuestro estudio el mas detectado fue el maltrato emocional. El lugar donde mas se produce sigue siendo el domicilio y el agresor, un familiar. Conclusiones: la deteccion del MTI es coincidente con la de todos los paises y estudios analizados, aunque continua siendo insuficiente. Se recomienda mejorar la formacion de los profesionales y disenar un cuestionario de deteccion apropiado para el SUMMA 112.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://eprints.ucm.es/33315/1/T36424.pdf"],"title":"Epidemiología del maltrato infantil detectado en un servicio de urgencias extrahospitalario (SUMMA 112) de la Comunidad de Madrid","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

At neutral pH, haptoglobin prevents the formation of β2m amyloid fibrils but not that of α-synuclein. Under conditions of local acidosis, pH 5.5-6.5, it prevents β2m fibril formation with relatively decreased efficiency. We have investigated the structural and stability aspects of haptoglobin as a function of pH. Between pH 5.5-8.0, it exists in a continuum of conformational states with subtle perturbation in tertiary structure, moderately exposed hydrophobic surfaces and distinct latent heat of unfolding.

(J Acoust Soc Am 112: 621-33, 2002) found\nthat a pulse train with alternating inter-pulse intervals\nbetween 4 and 6 ms (“4-6 stimulus”) is perceived as\nhaving a periodicity of 5.7ms. Using a model that relies on\nneuronal first order intervals (FOIs) for pitch perception,\nthey showed that the recovery of the auditory nerve from\nadaptation is not sufficient to explain this effect and\nsuggested that a weighting function that favours longer\nFOI intervals was needed to account for the perceived\npitch. Here we investigate whether there are neurons, or\npopulations of neurons, at the next stage of processing,\nthe cochlear nucleus (CN), that give greater representation\nto longer intervals. We measured the responses of single\nneurons in the ventral CN of anesthetised guinea pigs to\nisochronous and anisochronous pulse trains. Pulse trains\nwere band-pass filtered between 3900 Hz and 5300 Hz.\nIsochronous pulse trains had interpulse intervals of 3, 4, 5,\n6 and 7 ms. Anisochronous pulse trains had alternating\ninterpulse intervals between 4 and 6 ms. The results are\nbased on the responses of 58 units, classified by the\nshape of their post stimulus time histograms as Primary\nwith notch (PN, 9), transient chopper (CT, 22), sustained\nchopper (CS, 10) and onsets (ON, 17). PN and CT units\nshowed a recovery behaviour that is quantitatively similar\nto the auditory nerve. ON and CS units showed a faster\nrecovery between 4 and 6 ms, but not enough to account\nfor the size of the psychophysical effect. The average of\nFOI distributions for single units generally has too many\nlong intervals to account for the observed pitch of the 4-6\nstimulus. When sequentially interleaving the spikes from\nall units the average FOI distribution contains more shorter\nintervals, but, by interleaving spikes from just 2 to 4 units the average FOI becomes small enough to explain the observed pitch of the 4-6 stimulus. The location of units that may participate in such an analysis remains obscure.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Challenges to inter-spike interval models of pitch: the responses of cochlear nucleus neurons to band-pass filtered pulse trains","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

In vitro propagation would be helpful to decrease it‘s propagation problem. However, like many other woody plants, because of tissue phenol emersion and media browning, a huge number of explants die at the first stages of micropropagation process. This study proposed to investigate effect of cultivar, culture medium, explanting time, explants type and method of browning control on browning severity of tissue and media. Shoot tip and lateral buds as explants excised during spring and summer and culture in solid MS and WPM after sterilization. Based on the results, browning was higher in Sebri. It was also found that browning intensity reached to it maximum in summer explants and mortality rates of explants exceed 95%. Browning infection in MS medium was more than WPM. Explants type had a significant effect on browning in which terminal bud had more phenol emersion and browning in comparison to second and third nodes. Finally, for remedial measures to control browning, collection of other nodes or lateral bud rather than shoot tip as explants in early spring and storage of explants in a cold (4 oC) place for 10-12 hours and 100 mg l-1 of ascorbic acid before sterilization for 15 min will be helpful in these Pear cultivars. Using PVP up to 100 mg L-1 in the culture medium was not adequate browning control in explants.","inCitations":["434404ce8c725c14237be80d35ba20f5ba2844bc","82b729110d7189d75a75039454df6f44f9972d4a","80855c05f366ea9c32c799cc6bc8588cafd06ff4"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Reducing browning problem in micropropagation of three pear cultivars; Sebri, Shekari and Natanz","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

To enable this, they deploy complex workflows of analytic data flows that access multiple storage repositories and execution engines and that span the enterprise and even outside the enterprise. We call these multi-engine flows hybrid flows. Designing and optimizing hybrid flows is a challenging task. Managing a workload of hybrid flows is even more challenging since their execution engines are likely under different administrative domains and there is no single point of control. To address these needs, we present a Hybrid Flow Management System (HFMS). It is an independent software layer over a number of independent execution engines and storage repositories. It simplifies the design of analytic data flows and includes optimization and executor modules to produce optimized executable flows that can run across multiple execution engines. HFMS dispatches flows for execution and monitors their progress. To meet service level objectives for a workload, it may dynamically change a flow's execution plan to avoid processing bottlenecks in the computing infrastructure. We present the architecture of HFMS and describe its components. To demonstrate its potential benefit, we describe performance results for running sample batch workloads with and without HFMS. The ability to monitor multiple execution engines and to dynamically adjust plans enables HFMS to provide better service guarantees and better system utilization.","inCitations":["a1bbbfb2f7b7e534929fe25b50f2c11694e4d912","b5e3fff27cfd0b5af86897c0d350bc2a3ea00ba8","2ce93b8045d2f3665eaa35965790cdcd8b0610db","f15b9bc231e7c25dad9cd71f7f6fac63eabd44e1","a51ab01435dae6179245b25c59e5006cf27ac8d7","6d5e762469808cd8e236deaf75d8596aac3a3f1b","08f9cf140a8d3f7564b5665685053b3c08e9ebbc","0c213ffcf7ee6445cb5889b132281b65536515d3","488e3c0b5935c0f82b3044962f0d32fba3eb4a8c","1b70dd8a892503ac5b6eb777aaecf8c9a2330b8f","c3e16f7f9f25a86e90303c120d0c41876e907944","3d4ca5c40490dc52e4ec5cf9fbf3561ef579f9f5","6749357de9f63d6d1df2adaf716bd1729f73649c","94a2a9eb4e335a2b4f45702c9edb0d019a246510","fc779ec43b39cf9cf13f161b1d50a4890319c973","0e0f2261a60ad18c721d5e26d001952440f073d6","a7ec03e3094905665c5a6440c414a28280ed3ddb","db8806ba9d7e277c63b0e4eed89e09616ec17643","2d52b19904c9fea4bc55af8403b9a428fc30224f","58ab851c75e6be7097db097f91a32b889856d805","414958e9f94c2cda985f58b2e8de5b0587cfae77"],"pdfUrls":["http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/ICDE.2013.6544907"],"title":"HFMS: Managing the lifecycle and complexity of hybrid analytic data flows","doi":"10.1109/ICDE.2013.6544907","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDE.2013.6544907","venue":"2013 IEEE 29th International Conference on Data Engineering (ICDE)"}

The aim was to compare cognitive function in HD patients with no history of stroke or dementia and well-matched controls. Studies are required to determine the impact of HD and chronic kidney disease-specific risks on CI. Methods: 76 outpatients (50 receiving outpatient HD and 26 with normal kidney function matched for age and comorbidity) underwent a cross-sectional observational study. HD patients were well dialyzed and had optimal hemoglobin levels. A battery of eight neuropsychological tests was used. Outcomes included assessment scores of neurocognitive testing and prevalence and subtype of CI. Results: Compared to controls, HD subjects had significantly lower composite scores for each tested cognitive domain. In each domain except memory, the percentage of subjects with impairment was significantly higher in HD subjects than controls. Differences between the groups were independent of vascular and dementia risk factors. 82% of HD subjects met criteria for CI versus 50% of controls. Non-amnestic subtype of CI was more prevalent in both groups. Conclusion: Well-dialyzed HD patients with optimized hemoglobin levels and with no history of stroke or dementia performed significantly worse on multiple measures of cognition compared to controls. A higher prevalence of non-memory impairment may suggest an underlying vascular versus neurodegenerative mechanism. HD and chronic kidney disease-specific risk factors may contribute to early CI not readily detected by routine screening methods.","inCitations":["74efdedb5c3a01addaf87b95eac339a924d22ef1","1a5a6ed99f38a511d64bce01aad4a35bf0c39789","0f673995b8ade1df3f2a0abfb39ce3ac9aef97bf","98c92e4920f61c069b0c67d9e7d07accfb93def1","1a187656c6f7d88c7e75537eb4cc25be124f6482","5ffb6f904ef50379c1004d5e74beee9a6cedafb3","8b2f5421fd4c7a785b8504b71177cca6cb8fbbb0","d02f22ec87510af08aeea06b47ff1e5d705558e5","fe8376b3f72ffc68057531b651fdd5a822506003","52d79b33a368d174b46ada3acbf2326ecb83ae68","0d307a3db3e823cfde4279aa6976cbd08643b215","b6d05f1c6cebbe591a12641f080c28932a4feaa6","c43656eba8a2eb3a00f2956478f68fc3776532e2","d19e983ce024db50c7bff5e3e6567d3e2af895c8","e6fdef1778eb01c5176c7170278a1621d114f9dc","cf51211e315544402efe0402f3a74860e7027480","6b302f7163df6d66e11eb80ae5c1dca37390a58b","67eb78fd95fa62d1631b3fa75b5032f571908166","ab905b4370a6b601d03c43d1a7c3ae2cb7d9b0f1","a57199f58cf2a95cf30de5201fb9bb8b6322369b","40e72dcaf3cd1b8eec29d6a053e3e1774497ae94","ab038de2a147d7b8a7da3a7475f321f481a4ed61","ba6ae251fe6b37347a410fbb86a500c76334a60f","10e3ce83cf7a7cb1805de11e2f96eb7a2933880f","ea005a336e4a43ef9474a796f4eccbaaaa897c8d"],"pdfUrls":["https://www.karger.com/Article/Pdf/334871"],"title":"Increased Presence of Cognitive Impairment in Hemodialysis Patients in the Absence of Neurological Events","doi":"10.1159/000334871","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1159/000334871","venue":"American Journal of Nephrology"}

Gleichzeitig steigt die Zahl der Berichte uber medizinische Komplikationen – auch mit Todesfolge. Inzwischen mehren sich Hinweise darauf, das der dauerhafte Konsum groserer Mengen von Ecstasy neurotoxische Auswirkungen haben konnte, deren langfristige Folgen nicht absehbar sind. \nWelche Faktoren tragen zur Entwicklung eines Risikokonsums beziehungsweise einer Abhangigkeit bei? Bei Alkohol- und Drogenabhangigen konnte gezeigt werden, das Personlichkeitsstorungen, allen voran die antisoziale und Borderline Personlichkeitsstorung, einen starken Einflus auf die Entstehung, Aufrechterhaltung und den Verlauf der Erkrankung haben. Zum Missbrauch von Ecstasy ist die Datenlage diesbezuglich noch unzureichend. \n \nDies ist die erste Studie, die der Frage nach der Pravalenz und Auspragung von Personlichkeitsstorungen an einer groseren Stichprobe von Ecstasykonsumenten nachgegangen ist. Dazu wurden unter Verwendung zweier Selbstratinginstrumente (Personality Disorder Questionaire, PDQ-R und Inventar Klinischer Personlichkeitsakzentuierungen, IKP) 57 Ecstasykonsumenten (31 mannlich, 26 weiblich, Durchschnittsalter 23 Jahre) mit 30 Konsumenten anderer illegaler Drogen (19 mannlich, 11 weiblich, Durchschnittsalter 22 Jahre) sowie 7 Abstinenten (3 mannlich, 4 weiblich, Durchschnittsalter 22 Jahre) verglichen. Im nachsten Schritt wurden die Ecstasykonsumenten nach dem Schweregrad des Konsums drei Gruppen zugeteilt, die ebenfalls miteinander verglichen wurden. \nNach den Ergebnissen der vorliegenden Studie haben Ecstasykonsumenten und insbesondere –abhangige im Vergleich zu ecstasy- sowie drogenabstinenten Kontrollen mit identischem subkulturellem Hintergrund, aber auch gegenuber der Allgemeinbevolkerung und gleichaltrigen Studenten eine erhohte Pravalenz und Auspragung von Personlichkeitsstorungen. Die Zahlen liegen etwa auf dem Niveau von Patienten eines stationaren Drogenentwohnungsprogramms. Weiterhin zeigen sich teilweise signifikante Zusammenhange zwischen der Auspragung einzelner Personlichkeitsstorungen und dem Schweregrad des Konsums von Ecstasy und anderen Drogen. \nEcstasykonsumenten fallen durch teilweise signifikant erhohte Werte insbesondere fur Personlichkeitsstorungen aus dem Cluster B auf, was konsistent ist mit anderen Studien, die bei Ecstasykonsumenten eine Pragnanz von Personlichkeitszugen gefunden haben, die den Cluster B Personlichkeitsstorungen zugrunde liegen. Diejenigen Ecstasykonsumenten, deren Gebrauchsmuster die ICD-10 Abhangigkeitskriterien erfullen, unterscheiden sich von den Kontrollen daruber hinaus durch eine starkere Belastung bei den Cluster C Personlichkeitsstorungen, was als Hinweis auf Probleme aus dem angstlich-dysphorischen Bereich gewertet wird. Dieses Ergebnis deckt sich mit Ergebnissen anderer Studien, die auf eine erhohte depressive Belastung von Ecstasykonsumenten hindeuten. \n \nDie Frage, inwieweit diese Ergebnisse durch vorbestehende Personlichkeitseigenschaften, mogliche neurotoxische Folgen des Ecstasykonsums, den Konsum anderer Drogen sowie durch methodische Schwierigkeiten insbesondere bei der Diagnostik von Personlichkeitsstorungen beeinflust worden sind, wird ausfuhrlich diskutiert. \n \nAls weiteres wichtiges Ergebnis dieser Studie ist die niedrige Pravalenz der antisozialen Personlichkeitsstorung zu nennen, die mit 9% in der Gesamtgruppe der Ecstasykonsumenten und 14% bei den Ecstasyabhangigen unter der Zahl liegt, die bei Alkohol-, Opiat- und Kokainabhangigen gefunden werden. Dieses Ergebnis ist wahrscheinlich auf verschiedene Faktoren wie eine grostenteils bessere soziale Integration von Ecstasykonsumenten, substanzspezifische Unterschiede sowie die mangelnde Validitat der antisozialen Personlichkeitsstorung zuruckzufuhren. \n \nZusammengefast weist diese Studie auf die wichtige Rolle von Personlichkeitsstorungen bei der Entwicklung von Misbrauch- und Abhangigkeitsmustern von Ecstasy hin. Fur die Zukunft ware es wunschenswert, diejenigen Konsumenten, bei denen Hinweise auf das Vorhandensein einer Personlichkeitsstorung vorliegen beispielsweise unter Verwendung semistrukturierter Interviews genauer zu betrachten. Daruber hinaus weist diese Studie auf die Unterschiede zu Abhangigen herkommlicher Drogen und die daraus folgende Notwendigkeit fur speziell auf Ecstasykonsumenten zugeschnittene Hilfsangebote hin.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://ediss.sub.uni-hamburg.de/volltexte/2005/2491/pdf/PDF_Gesamt_06_2005.pdf"],"title":"Die Prävalenz und Ausprägung von Persönlichkeitsstörungen bei Ecstasykonsumenten","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}
