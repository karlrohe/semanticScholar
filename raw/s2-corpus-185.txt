Pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) methods have assumed an important role in improving the efficiency of this process across the pharmaceutical industry and in other areas of anti-infective therapy. Information gained using PK-PD methods from the earliest in vitro assessments right up to the end of Phase II development can underpin proof-of-concept and ensure that agents are fully pharmacologically optimized. Despite our limited understanding of the biology of bacillary elimination in vivo, such an approach has already provided key insights into these mechanisms and helped to identify the role of different drugs in therapy and assess their potential for progression to pivotal trials. While isoniazid appears historically to have been effectively exploited, human studies suggest that it does not play a key role in the sterilizing phase of treatment. Re-evaluation of the PK-PD of rifamycins by contrast suggests that there may be considerable scope for improving their activity by intensifying current dosing strategies. Various PK-PD analyses of the fluoroquinolone series demonstrate remarkable agreement concerning the ranking of their sterilizing activity, results which appear to be confirmed in recent human phase II studies. The pharmacological characteristics of completely new classes of drugs now entering clinical development suggest that experience with existing drugs, particularly EBA studies, should not prejudice evaluation of their pharmacodynamic activity which may differ qualitatively from that of many current agents. In conclusion, PK-PD analysis has a vital role to play in the rational development of new anti-tuberculosis drugs and combination regimens.","inCitations":["f0d0a201e27b72607ea2abbeb57e10c9ca25454e","7c394ff3566d2b32a244f712e8afd1afb6f732a1","5668246502ac912b5e5c17aa75954c11f2bec300","0d99648cdea6948aab6bebf7838c01ac44955e5c","9513cd51507e9089d2b5d00529b63b426c6e97fa","1dde0cffa037234c2f8958f47574637d93930438","7bde05624296eb8f8c546c080b37642f762ad6b2","589dfeffa2d09d9e85cb72e1de472307098767b9","deaf2e38a4a4424e57bcf8faf2cb04684fa2753c","36b7e11ce78d23057fb3ed2dc812631e00f2110a","28e32fa1a85326b0887088a7356c924bb2f92506","38c74c4d072504646ef56ee036de9928c7ae8d09","ceebb1ae1b83fba138c9e4ff650b80fc6f64285e","e7a925000eed51becfdf8724ccd95531c33616a2","01f63a0ba5a5530048caac2d03e992d869a64486","003393bf2ef5c3684c98dfacbcf8d456f1d29099","03375aee1a8b9bddb0d5ac5d11c093dabde8f2bf","f947c39bc8b32082940f55b418f687fe43a334c2","291a6d9271f05133558c1aa5369d62ce7a1d8dde","7ac15e5feb722d6270f56f93bdd007ba8102d4c5","543a5d7cbf279b4dcb70fc38b29684e5a4c52dca","8656b912cca4be3e3604c389b903515ab5e8dcb2","54e3478ff60343c099317a97b2f317b451c9b279","ae70c9dad5b190df9b7a670f5df913929ad5b3eb","48209db5f9baa9843f0a654b7d3f2f4b38fb0374","707b5e29c32b9466f4fa76cf624d2a4bbafff194","28973c998b7fa685d8a6c8f71e90a0af1a76cbc3","d1b5c238b8d4f0948af7b58eb928e2a2277593b3","428523f1890608aac5c2108104010859796dc973"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in the development of anti-tuberculosis drugs.","doi":"10.1016/S1472-9792(08)70037-4","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/S1472-9792%2808%2970037-4","venue":"Tuberculosis"}

In this paper, I explore the possibilities for such a dialogue by first discussing the rejection of substantialism shared by Kierkegaard and Buddhists. Next, although many Buddhists accept a reductionist account of the kind found in the Abhidharma tradition, Madhyamaka thinkers such as Nāgārjuna and Candrakīrti are well-known for offering an account of the self, based on the notion of emptiness (śūnyatā), which resembles in some ways the account of the self that is proposed by Kierkegaard’s pseudonym Anti-Climacus in The Sickness Unto Death. Third, I discuss Jonardon Ganeri’s performativist theory of the self and his suggestion that this view, originally developed by Candrakīrti, informs the view of the self which is developed by Kierkegaard’s pseudonym Johannes Climacus in the Concluding Unscientific Postscript. I conclude by exploring how Ganeri’s perfomativist theory of the self can illuminate recent attempts by both Buddhist and Kierkegaard scholars to articulate their accounts of the self by an appeal to narrative.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://scholarworks.sjsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1226&context=comparativephilosophy"],"title":"The Self: Kierkegaard and Buddhism in Dialogue","doi":"10.31979/2151-6014(2017).080209","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.31979/2151-6014%282017%29.080209","venue":""}

Both buildings have the facade made of glass. In the first building, radiant panels are suspended under the ceiling in order to create comfortable conditions, natural gas boilers are the installed in order to generate heat and chillers are used to generate cool. The second building has heat pumps installed to provide the building with heat/cool and capillary pipes are embedded in the plaster on the ceiling surface to emit the heat/cool into the occupied space. The energy performance was calculated in accordance with the set of CEN standards for energy certification and is presented in the form of energy certificates. Thermal comfort and indoor air quality were experimentally studied by long-term and short-term measurements and through questionnaires filled in by the occupants themselves. The study has shown that the low temperature heating/high temperature cooling system has the potential to create a comfortable indoor environment at low energy consumption, but the ability of the heating/cooling systems to do so is closely related to the appropriate control of the systems.","inCitations":["176340291f8e39237e08d412ba74780afd7f984b","9544766dc3bb9ce7bef9942822e71f23bd71ef03"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Indoor Environment and Energy Performance of Office Buildings Equipped with a Low Temperature Heating / High Temperature Cooling System","doi":"10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMR.899.36","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.4028/www.scientific.net%2FAMR.899.36","venue":""}

BoP entrepreneurs operate in a severely resource-constrained environment, ‘making do’ with the resources at hand in a process called bricolage. This is essentially a learning process, acquiring and transforming knowledge to come up with new, improved solutions to improve both the entrepreneur’s and the community’s situation. We studied how learning processes develop over time and how a third party can stimulate entrepreneurial learning. We gathered data during two years of monitoring, group interviews and individual interviews with entrepreneurs, their families and people from their networks. Our findings suggest that both formal training and learning from conducting experiments are effective, mutually reinforcing mechanisms. Initially entrepreneurs mainly experience single loop learning in training settings. The first double loop learning event occurred after they saw the positive results of their own successful experiments newly acquired knowledge and occurred in the affective dimension, when they realize they can be entrepreneurs. Social entrepreneurial development could well be combined with institutionalising joint learning processes in a larger entrepreneurial network, gradually leading to joint learning sessions and the co-exploitation of entrepreneurial opportunities.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://research.vu.nl/ws/portalfiles/portal/42124584/chapter+5.+Creating+social+entrepreneurship+in+Bangladesh:+perspectives+on+knowledge+and+learning+pr.pdf"],"title":"Creating social entrepreneurship in Bangladesh : perspectives on knowledge and learning processes","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Then, time-delay compensation is realized and both frequency-domain and time-domain simulation of the controller performance are conducted. According to the simulation results, the sprung-mass acceleration of the suspension controlled by an adaptive controller with time-delay compensation is superior to that without time-delay compensation. Both the period to settle down and the peak of vibration acceleration are smaller. This means the proposed controller is capable of dealing with problems including variable time delay, nonlinear vibration and predictive control.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://www.jvejournals.com/article/20077/pdf"],"title":"Adaptive control of a nonlinear suspension with time-delay compensation","doi":"10.21595/jve.2019.20077","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.21595/jve.2019.20077","venue":""}

As recombinant proteins are increasingly utilized as biotherapeutics, improved methodologies ensuring the characterization of post-translational modifications (PTMs) are needed. Typically, proteins prepared for PTM analysis are proteolytically digested and analyzed by mass spectrometry. To ensure full coverage of the PTMs on a given protein, one must obtain complete sequence coverage of the protein, which is often quite challenging. The objective of the research described here is to design a protocol that maximizes protein sequence coverage and enables detection of post-translational modifications, specifically N-linked glycosylation. To achieve this objective, a highly efficient proteolytic digest protocol using trypsin was designed by comparing the relative merits of denaturing agents (urea and Rapigest SF), reducing agents [dithiothreitol (DTT) and tris(2-carboxyethyl)phophine (TCEP)], and various concentrations of alkylating agent [iodoacetamide (IAM)]. After analysis of human apo-transferrin using various protease digestion protocols, ideal conditions were determined to contain 6 M urea for denaturation, 5 mM TCEP for reduction, 10 mM IAM for alkylation, and 10 mM DTT, to quench excess IAM before the addition of trypsin. This method was successfully applied to a novel recombinant protein, human lysyl oxidase-like 2. Furthermore, the glycosylation PTMs were readily detected at two glycosylation sites in the protein. These digestion conditions were specifically designed for PTM analysis of recombinant proteins and biotherapeutics, and the work described herein fills an unmet need in the growing field of biopharmaceutical analysis.","inCitations":["c96d1e804dce3d88ca8293a21f13ac617ce82004","9f9b809b5104c3eae6e875f8a723f91a1ffe8d37","b6eee8224bb66bd22eca223a4854f2322369b099","f3164672c3e7123f82d741dc7020111d59b94233","23386e89109fb4d6999205985ff46faca48b4c3d","b80ca7089c553ac93f233b14bbafabdb05365d06","d53bd439d7302050300185fad849bab74cdf545b","66b512dc7cbaa2319a698399c96e02278fc52fb4","df393b8ad571fe790fa9edf8b2afc65455d0674b","61952de00eb840c70279839f3386f37430402d1c","a29dabd61a0dca8f0e56128740e5058d43b2f25b","111d05b073b727574077f6bea5ee350a340a5d5b","73f4e13ca391d520a40040acabe8ca59f723b0e0","1cae3a36e1b493505e01a0134bfcc365d6d425da","1c9d99e243f9a776b30647c2a50876bd07bfd77c","110940033f08f4d9a0b15798576e9e9b34763426","e50d2364f2ea87dd2166dcf98bb618da670ba52a"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"A general protease digestion procedure for optimal protein sequence coverage and post-translational modifications analysis of recombinant glycoproteins: application to the characterization of human lysyl oxidase-like 2 glycosylation.","doi":"10.1021/ac2017037","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1021/ac2017037","venue":"Analytical chemistry"}

Unfortunately, in most traffic systems cyclists are exposed to high levels of road risks (OECD/International Transport Forum, 2013). In 2014, more than 2000 cyclist deaths were recorded in the EU alone. Many more were seriously injured, but their actual numbers or reliable estimates of it are not available (ETSC, 2016). Today, even in a cycling friendly country like the Netherlands − frequently serving as a model for cycle promotion elsewhere − about a third of all road fatalities and more than half of all serious road injuries are cyclists (Schepers et al., 2017). Whereas in the last decades huge safety gains have been achieved for car occupants, up to now protection of cyclists has been far less successful. Yet, policies to protect cyclists are scarce (ETSC, 2016). Research fundamental for the development of such policies is still in its infancy and hampered by many limitations, such as incomplete data on bicycle crashes, lack of funding and focus, as well as shortcomings in methods suitable for research on bicycle safety. From 30.302 papers on traffic safety indexed in Science Direct for the years 2012–2016, only 7.8% dealt with the safety of cycling. On a more positive note, the growing numbers of participants in the International Conference on Cycling safety (ICSC) indicates that the tables are about to turn. In its fourth edition in 2015 in Hannover, the ICSC welcomed 114 participants from 24 countries and about 50 papers were presented. \n \nBased on a selection of these papers, this special issue ‘Improving cyclist safety through scientific research’ provides a platform for recent developments in cycling research.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Editorial for special issue - 'Improving cyclist safety through scientific research'.","doi":"10.1016/j.aap.2017.05.021","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aap.2017.05.021","venue":"Accident; analysis and prevention"}

We conducted a long-term follow-up survey in a cohort of people with convulsive epilepsy in rural areas of China. In this longitudinal prospective study we investigated the causes of death and premature mortality risk among people with epilepsy.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe attempted to trace all 2,455 people who had previously participated in a pragmatic assessment of epilepsy management at the primary health level. Putative causes of death were recorded for those who died, according to the International Classification of Diseases. We estimated proportional mortality ratios (PMRs) for each cause, and standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) for each age-group and cause. Survival analysis was used to detect risk factors associated with increased mortality.\n\n\nKEY FINDINGS\nDuring 6.1 years of follow-up there were 206 reported deaths among the 1,986 people with epilepsy who were located. The highest PMRs were for cerebrovascular disease (15%), drowning (14%), self-inflicted injury (13%), and status epilepticus (6%), with probable sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) in 1%. The risk of premature death was 2.9 times greater in people with epilepsy than in the general population. A much higher risk (SMRs 28-37) was found in young people. Duration of epilepsy and living in a waterside area were independent predictors for drowning.\n\n\nSIGNIFICANCE\nDrowning and status epilepticus were important, possibly preventable, causes of death. Predictors of increasing mortality suggest interventions with efficient treatment and education to prevent premature mortality among people with epilepsy in resource-poor settings.","inCitations":["4baa669832ed3b24ed6f22b6e82afe1feeed223e","5667b2548d523874b623b86de0b5e7d99cc7cc40","25cabdcedccd8c067bd2dce11a94f63ef373a837","8ce488c24eac9729098a1c50a8507b1a25a37dbe","123565cdb5b5ab5783386c008f6b31770f6b7182","464608b94e2893c1c1ec0c70bf0d3b3ee320ec4c","29c880e06975d2bee1cfde097e2475428191fcc6","bcc9d9037f8e76d30d98669b2f6ab223fca2e08f","7be1d4a373c2cf5f4156194a9f20b7ad02f78b45","355d46cb003020e4e6f41588a0dccb11b2c783e2","71da83b6ba448d8d838b58831cea7d3284b35c4a","0400fab5a896e02ea2e623946dd354f5056c8c28","ae3297de912d5252fb0dcbab296878461e6a9f93","f20617d527b7e8eb77a05f9be31e64365e6b6d91","28abafad0c46e201ecf125eb5740871c16e3bf30","90dcb15924bacc04a9cddbe67f414703c30fc4af","5c35b3f7a217d09703186ca046f4e8ef728803f8","77a3003c8c35f0473e81fffebfd05de814b60a2d","a6e1fa88ca2163624bb33c51ec9d4075fbb03eb4","d3b5ea8823a7558ef9053291375781b26086cb7c","786c81cbe17d67798ec1b4f4f24994058fadc425","37f163be39c2f1df1e07b2062eeaec706dd95e51","fe6469c8ddd3430db4dbacc08bd1d106e61b64ab","017eb2248326d5acdd67942436d072f926a7a6ea","04cbcaf5180e67895a99f3b9ae5f75f78de159d3","d01ccc02abfaf5e1e495b685fc102a684e25d74a","8edd10901943fb75f7223df3ca05a31dd197afed","8f434b515061acbd34452d552e0adbafdf824878","97ef99eee0bb7aaee7f302e0e536d792a2206f47","1d5ab9690d87632bf79f0f1cf29aa00642f27902","933b92c568ce24120c225cc16bb187a0d07051c5","5b0b8f3413be3faf82fa7f2ba5dab0cfabbc03fc","3a85a2b9d4b98fab64c2415f6075f979e12b781a"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Premature mortality risk in people with convulsive epilepsy: long follow-up of a cohort in rural China.","doi":"10.1111/epi.12048","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1111/epi.12048","venue":"Epilepsia"}

It was observed that NaxWO3 can sustain strong localised surface plasmon resonances (LSPR) with an energy that can be tuned by changing the Na content.

It leads to common phase error and inter-carrier interference in massive MIMO-OFDM uplink. To solve the issue, a novel phase noise cancellation scheme based on polarization modulation is proposed. We first introduce the polarization modulation (PM) exploited in massive MIMO-OFDM uplink. Then, by exploiting zero-forcing detection, we analyze ICI and the distribution of the transformed noise. Furthermore, we demonstrate that phase noise can be asymptotically cancelled and only the transformed additive white Gaussian noise exists as the number of antennas at the base station is very lager. Moreover, we derive the instantaneous signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) on each subcarrier and analyze the ergodic capacity. The simulation results show that the proposed scheme can effectively mitigate phase noise and achieve a higher ergodic capacity.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2018.8580988"],"title":"Polarization Modulation based Phase Noise Cancellation for Massive MIMO-OFDM Systems","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2018.8580988","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2018.8580988","venue":"2018 IEEE 29th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)"}

Kapitel 3 befasst sich mit der Entwicklung der Methodik zur Bemessung und Ueberpruefung von Kunstbauten ueber die Zeit beziehungsweise ueber die entsprechenden Normengenerationen. Grundlage sind die verschiedenen Grenzzustaende (Kapitel 3.1). In Kapitel 3.2 werden die Unterschiede zwischen neuen und bestehenden Tragwerken beziehungsweise zwischen Bemessung und Ueberpruefung herausgearbeitet. In Kapitel 3.3 werden chronologisch die Nachweiskonzepte frueherer Normengenerationen beschrieben, ausgehend von den zulaessigen Spannungen bis zu den Teilsicherheitsfaktoren und deren Differenzierung. Kapitel 3.4 ist dem Nachweiskonzept der aktuell gueltigen Tragwerksnormen gewidmet. In Kapitel 3.5 sind die Grundlagen des probabilistischen Nachweiskonzepts skizziert. Fuer bestimmte Anwendungen eignet sich auch das semi-probabilistische Nachweisformat (Kapitel 3.6). In Kapitel 3.7 und 3.8 werden schliesslich wichtige Grundlagen aus dem vorausgehenden Projekt AGB 2002/020 \"Beurteilung der Risiken und Kriterien zur Festlegung akzeptierter Risiken in Folge aussergewoehnlicher Einwirkungen bei Kunstbauten\" und dem parallel ablaufenden Teilprojekt 102 \"Methodik zur vergleichenden Risikobeurteilung\" dargestellt. In Kapitel 4 werden diejenigen Gefaehrdungsfelder behandelt, die bezueglich der Tragsicherheit von Kunstbauten erste Prioritaet aufweisen. Bei den Lasteinwirkungen (Kapitel 4.1) wird fuer jede wesentliche Einwirkung aufgezeigt, wann sie wie Eingang ins Normenwerk fand, was im vornormativen Bereich geschieht und welche Entwicklungen in Zukunft zu erwarten sind. Der groesste Informationsbedarf besteht bei den staendigen Lasten, da deren Aktualisierung im Rahmen von Ueberpruefungen allenfalls Reserven aufzeigt und bei den Verkehrslasten, da diese zwar staendig zunehmen jedoch nicht so flaechendeckend und rasch, wie man es anhand der Normen fuer Neubauten vermuten koennte. In Kapitel 5 werden die uebrigen Gefaehrdungsfelder mit zweiter Prioritaet gestreift. Kapitel 5.1 \"Klima\" dient als Gefaess fuer die Behandlung der Temperatureinwirkungen und der Chloridexposition. Die Naturgefahren (Kapitel 5.2) werden gegliedert und deren Normierungsstand wird beschrieben. Bei Stoerfaellen (Kapitel 5.3) sind vor allem Brand und Sabotage relevant. Das Verkehrsgeschehen (Kapitel 5.4) hat direkt keinen Einfluss auf die Tragsicherheit der Kunstbauten. Als menschliche Faktoren (Kapitel 5.5) werden neben dem Nichteinhalten von Verkehrsregeln das mutwillige Fallenlassen von Gegenstaenden und Brueckensuizide erwaehnt. Fahrzeuge (Kapitel 5.6) beeinflussen die zu beruecksichtigenden Einwirkungen durch ihr Gewicht, die Daempfungseigenschaften ihrer Federung und ihr Verhalten bei Anprall. Die Beschaffenheit der Infrastruktur (Kapitel 5.7) aeussert sich als Unebenheit des Belags, die Beschaffenheit der Leiteinrichtungen und indirekt durch Unfall verursachende Umstaende. Kapitel 6 ist verschiedenen Aspekten der Beurteilung der Tragsicherheit gewidmet. Kapitel 7 schliesslich stellt die Folgerungen und Empfehlungen in verschiedenen Formen dar, einerseits gegliedert nach der Risikomatrix der Voruntersuchung, andererseits gegliedert nach Adressaten. Durch die Bewertung der Kriterien Risiko, Quantitaet und Informationsdefizit fuer jedes Gefaehrdungsfeld koennen diese priorisiert werden.

The sphingosine phosphate receptor 1 (S1P1) agonist FTY-720 (Gilenya) arrests immune trafficking and prevents multiple sclerosis (MS) relapses. However, alternative mechanisms of S1P-S1P1 signaling have been reported. Phosphoproteomic analysis of MS brain lesions revealed S1P1 phosphorylation on S351, a residue crucial for receptor internalization. Mutant mice harboring an S1pr1 gene encoding phosphorylation-deficient receptors (S1P1(S5A)) developed severe experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) due to autoimmunity mediated by interleukin 17 (IL-17)–producing helper T cells (TH17 cells) in the peripheral immune and nervous system. S1P1 directly activated the Jak-STAT3 signal-transduction pathway via IL-6. Impaired S1P1 phosphorylation enhances TH17 polarization and exacerbates autoimmune neuroinflammation. These mechanisms may be pathogenic in MS.","inCitations":["8048f2cecccccb023950947d664644d9105020f6","ce054b86994d604c306ccb096932e8928b9b913b","94cfd2d845fbd9bd56ac254cfa9eba9c98206d9f","c237644041fd6d82c539ba5b5526a3578ddbaaca","663f29b9f0c60810540ccb4b74239ee603c076da","afa104c3a35e1798ed69927eec42ee0e72e08e0b","114e47be0ffa69db2aa44389464bc546fef7dda3","ec5a0a6900d9b6e8836bcbacf9710580da04ef39","255267361cc64d93637cb0dd684f55f3b0105c67","5b2a60565bed25b5a0fb3d11b058917a002870c3","8ef157340ec5fe38c389ac215de50a79fda78682","44fee8750495d66b7bb96812a943be6c0b7c78d9","5e990c6a4e6f69e7e131b81f4b4371ecb06775d2","d1213bcaa025409684c9c533d22c0d8bab8c1eb5","425e13218b54b9c5b1578b8e7fcade3d8d89be62","0fcfa308366dc0e444ce631073d5122e8825e318","9d700488baaf3fc9412ed822de5117f63b79af4c","6053ef931e5fe9a0b0c36886866998e5e50106b7","598a7f137b8d156bc9bcfa0815b63273bd105b0e","f425d3a88b5e573d3621dfc3debe250bec9b8286","79664c03b85e1f8e8be97a230d2d49f32d0f7603","0a8c4c92a32a92ccc0eb26119700b4a893a6bd25","e6e6f57bc0552fa92429eb0ead80fd99f819d1b0","f0c0e91e39e799ea8274c192250ca0ac475ca2f9","c9a0e9430529441f50845e06e911c2accc15e3f1","878eb6a5b7d7bcc38779de64917895210528c218","9a6e83178113c268ca04a3d178d5cf3495982450","fcdcab5812507317ac274aed4c9392a5a2ce3b18","2e8251bc112cc9a5de58ff2fc612895a834ce669","bc1edbe288d047cb78604ac3891b23382fda2a00","cea8b356a0d02a796402ae2077fcc5eb18db1c69","f201532603da8b19238f0e9b3fa9b666395891d8","cf769229b10ed8c0286f40bf9e3b334f8ef84e0d","f90bb14b518d5186c1f17aa438a1b75f7aff8c72","ff70ef1925afaf0e2d4a7fd7bf72befc739e3f1e","a081efebf3cc35d6831786fdb3fcb91add3ddcb1","33a5c4e9f309e0ba672b8a6fb0151c1549642643","85dc1472099ace19443f132668448c6c7bff5ff9","26f777f960e590418f32f92be3b9264bc0153e9e","87948466c364a50807e09309797547206fe7be6f","2bc19e174a3ac5a9a7a2711d477068288f6a116f","5ac328952885d7ecfe2679cea23b691137392bd6","9d868b1649d79d78583248eb6d6b84a8977a6c6f","0146cc22d472a3abec9624b05c1b9481b8b839c8","6de0427c576e678049823e4ccf1bee10fdfcabba","dd4b9243814d62ee37c0ecd2c54c88b7e7a7b279","59d35c941b50f6a74b85344bddfed03ee068fb0a","12ea2740f3a2747fa6fc9fd2b819ffd06bce9e32","66682fad342320e64266f0b56e2fd37cd4a81cfc","57081f133ab907cc86e898c6853b5fdcd06673f8","9248cab3815768ea602463bcd4f6b6e4f751166d","ff9c15b7b57436229efdc5bdd6a88ebcaf9cabd2","be1fd47c27ce065c1c992466b832d8039b847897","e6c44088d87a2092ff077a19b1f9cb2f44f2e24f","17fc0f186bb0db191aa83c84ac8f02cc5fdb3d35","614d555bf1d10640ee7d5340c6d7a013edb1f86f","8acbcd3c7f5956b8cf350d7b7b4cc443b59fb604","7262241bcafbd0b5c68f1dfbdf8989b0a3aa8d24","7e451f7b753be058136a7ae0a5180253f2e59094","66d6bcbd2f2caf84ee923fbbb65151efa7c03d7c","eb928ae47c8f3be1f9cbfcd66e88136427bf4f35","1a40df88950f1107ab52c855295fc52a49caf837","a0ea4f359cef056206ce6bbca57feb577e70d76b"],"pdfUrls":["https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/12406821/4014310.pdf?isAllowed=y&sequence=1","https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/12406821/4014310.pdf?sequence=1","http://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/pmc/8e/aa/nihms521577.PMC4014310.pdf"],"title":"Defective sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1 (S1P1) phosphorylation exacerbates TH17-mediated autoimmune neuroinflammation","doi":"10.1038/ni.2730","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1038/ni.2730","venue":"Nature Immunology"}

Following comprehensive concentration-response analyses of the single agents, the pharmacologically well-founded models of concentration addition and independent action were used to predict entire concentration-response relationships for mixtures of the agents with a variety of fixed mixture ratios, assuming additivity. For molar mixture ratios proportional to the levels normally found in human tissues (i.e., below 1:5000, E2:BPA or o,p'-DDT), these predictions suggest that the effects of individual xenoestrogens are too weak to create an impact on the actions of steroidal hormones. However, at mixture ratios more in favor of the xenoestrogens, a significant contribution to the overall mixture effect was predicted. The predictions were tested experimentally. The observed combined effects of mixtures of E2 with either BPA or o,p'-DDT did not deviate from the additivity expectation. On combining E2 with either BPA or o,p'-DDT at approximately equieffective concentrations corresponding to molar mixture ratios between 1:20,000 and 1:100,000 (E2:BPA or o,p'-DDT), substantial modulations of the effects of E2 became discernible. The assumption that weak xenoestrogens are generally unable to create an impact upon the already strong effects of endogenous steroidal estrogens is not supported by our observations. Our studies indicate that the potential health implication of additive combination effects between xenoestrogens and steroidal estrogens deserve serious consideration.","inCitations":["48ec84ce970ca9ec764d379584fa959c295125f1","5e1604e077b0109e6a44377c8ee82c98883d3c03","82097000ff77803036720d82b62f6c30d26d5faf","acf9debff5026a01b59b01087450a74a33280b30","e0fde4ea341855d803c12d4dfddaa590c1c6a5ae","4fe4c4891f2e9cb0546396339cfac7d02c11661f","0ade0534e46ae8329cc6eff3e6d4c0248dc0bf7a","60a2b2ad0ed8d3ad89904402bbb5231d3af71c2d","2f73ab21012a2a791682caa128e8bdf9d52d49ed","2b65bd7caf030d9e76bf94ea760879c58f242867","c99c535faea58f77a53bd63fb07784c108487155","68d4b4d22a7a3d4565df0c9015a1bd78c77353d1","8cc518040be781b8f07bbd150168b25313246371","84a91b49b4eeee857ef8e285aa33d1ee1be3ec9c","d2ca7f0864863d110406feac4b61b0d899b8cbeb","91b1b0f6bea1f8f9caf44c7f5e44c42f61cd0835","f801c51d7919d69937dee006318d6972f480adde","3fe2eab6dab8ab43bcd55fb63719a2f12874536f","98a32777a5021af5633eae61915e7b46c3c0fdde","3e5dd8bac30a771309025c474ad17aae7bed6d3f","86b7babbd054bc0acde6f8a11eb77a51afd17553","5ee30622f6b56c254af38849dfba04c820daae32","de51a4469fb93e397a721bb465f714ab091fa449","a64907cabb092ff6cda25e3fbdbfc3b03396cc9f","085ea7b6b2b471ae181cc2d6102bdfd48eacc662","edd162c306d2fe428e8586b4abfdb71875d2bb41","c82782140b064dc0fd3f01079699ae5a7abf61da","e644f6a18c2d24e814075fa264503377e8f18fd7","a30ecc504da1da0b00fe9fa33f3509fd6d2bc69e","37c329e322f3ee40e4a474e7f2e3ce38d4d8751e","eefdb55799237499447eb509b7397c393c2990ff","3a83e4de15062c3054a5f49703e37a7e6a702ec5","7116e35e930dab2ce524c39e7e2588ca1da1ca3e","32f8513c4710ef380d3dc5e2b3841412c4813677","743c6ec618101e723f3d88c15a8fbdb210fa312d","96409cfa282afe9998945578372b3c329e3fd0a5","9b7bb03d96e6d24c8383a6b39ce92f8a4822c616","999349f51717fb11eadc47d1e083fc0061391e11","07c49b1e686b5236fe976b32626acda2e03eeb6e","531ef60e09cf1423bd3c21784d56acc12cd6fb9a","d140bb0c40192e60057eb37ff843f4c918fb77b5","c0570cfd4d831a12c3ce70cdd8ca98f896b787af","6196c14321116600fc2afd80c7f7f66ae6ef5e7f","c17f32fc4de4bf0c62a51f066bdb76f06f2eb568","e8db463b93ac7514effa5dbf262c020abc70d75f","a312f1dc73873b2fbe2faf18bd8ad725e9d973e4","85640a6b60b0b255bd701f0bd53656f498446e2a","9e08eddcbf63c30251d3ddc122bb66c47e3cbf8d","59d3930dacc4e01d624828329168c2d665d503c8","c7d9acdb78b13e9b2a1e16b82a733f7418373ea2","f35604b9aec0c67ae9efb287e23de95388ea68bf","938e026cb8b7548bc425dead4ed442dfeb79d16b","d0bc228507dd7af70b55fc4f3f5772f954f6cd65"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.rachel.org/files/document/Defining_the_Impact_of_Weakly_Estrogenic_Chemi.pdf"],"title":"Defining the impact of weakly estrogenic chemicals on the action of steroidal estrogens.","doi":"10.1093/toxsci/60.2.296","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1093/toxsci%2F60.2.296","venue":"Toxicological sciences : an official journal of the Society of Toxicology"}

Rubber tapping involves repetitive and high paced work, static muscle loading, non-neutral body postures, forceful physical exertion, and all potential risk factor for development of WRMP. In this study, a cross sectional study was carried out 1) to determine the prevalence of WRMP among rubber tapper, 2) to determine the psychosocial factors that can contribute to WRMP, 3) to assess postural problem, 4) to identify whether there is a mismatched between rubber tapper tools and rubber tapper hand and 5) to identify the relationship between psychosocial factors and physical factors among rubber tapper. Data collection was done using four instruments, namely Nordic Musculoskeletal Questionnaire (NMQ), Job Content Questionnaire (JCQ), Rapid Upper Limb Assessment Tools (RULA) and Anthropometry Measurement. Questionnaire were administered to (n=70) rubber tappers to measure WRMP and psychosocial factors using NMQ and JCQ. Ergonomic risk exposure levels were measured for the tappers using RULA. Mismatch between rubber tappers hand and tools were measure using anthropometry measurement. Based on the results obtained, 64.3% of the rubber tappers suffer from lower back pain. The study also found that MSCs and psychosocial factors are significant. In conclusions, WRMP among rubber tappers are well known and can be prevented or controlled by the education programs, training and administrative short working time. Tools used by rubber tappers also can be improved.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"WRMP and associated risk factor among rubber tapper a community based study at Kg Pong, Pengkalan Hulu, Perak","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

We examined whether obesity had an influence on the recurrences of HER-2 positive patients, as related to adjuvant trastuzumab treatment, retrospectively. Materials and methods: Among HER-2 positive 170 patients, 129 had accessible data, and with 114, recorded weight / height measurements were statistically analyzed. Results: Of these, the body mass index (BMI) was <30 kg/m2 in 68 (60%), and ≥30 kg/m2 in 46 (40%). Recurrence-free survival (RFS) was 8.8 ± 6.5 and 78.09 ± 12.43 months in the groups with low and high BMI, respectively (p=0.32). Recurrences were found in 7 of 95 (7.4%) receiving Trastuzumab and 13 of 34 patients (38.2%) not receiving. The difference was significant (p<0.001). We detected that 53 patients have a carcinoma insitu on the pathological report (32 patients were BMI<30 kg/ m2 group and 21 patients were BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2 group). Cox regression analysis showed that only presence of carcinoma in situ was significant for PFS, in the population of the study, HR 0.44 (95% CI 1.05-34.28, p=0.044). There was a significant relationship favoring trastuzumab treatment between size of tumor (p=0.04) and hormone receptor positivity with RFS (p =0.002). Moreover, in the hormone receptor negative group, the risk of recurrence was 7.6 folds in the absence of trastuzumab treatment. Median follow-up was 24 months (range 3-257) and recurrence was found in 20 patients (15.5 %). Five patients died during follow-up. Presence of carcinoma-in-situ and use of Trastuzumab had influenced RFS in the population of the study. Rate of hormone receptor negativity was higher and RFS was longer in obese patients than non-obese patients; however, the difference was not significant (p =0.659).

Abortion information was verified with hospital and health worker records. 228 women were interviewed and discussions with 6 women who had at least two abortions were recorded. Demographic records indicated that in village 1 which had sanctions for exceeding the two-child norm the abortion rate in 1991 was 110 abortions per 100 live births. Village 2 had a loose policy and lenient sanctions if any were applied at all and the abortion rate was 54 per 100. Findings indicate that 52% of women were in their 30s. 23% had a secondary or higher education. 87% were farmers. 8% were employed in nonagricultural work. 10% were Catholic and the rest were nonreligious or Buddhist. 10% reported food insufficiency for about 2 months/year. Women in the sample had 928 pregnancies or an average of 2.4 live births and 1.5 abortions. 64% of the women had a first abortion in 1991 and 25% had a second abortion in 1991. 11% were on their third abortion. 79% of women at the time of the abortion had two or more children. 20% had one child and 1% were childless. About 80% of abortions were performed before the 8th week of pregnancy. 44% of women were practicing some form of family planning at the time of pregnancy. 11% were using the IUD 2% used condoms and 31% used a traditional method. Women reported a number of reasons for the abortion including financial birth spacing and health reasons. Financial reasons included the desire to spend money on a new house and the desire to avoid a fine for too many children. About 90% of women made the decision jointly with their husbands. Parents also contributed to decision making and differing views were expressed between generations. Findings suggest a high abortion rate due to inadequate contraceptive services the desire for smaller families and population policy.","inCitations":["fa8639fb1acd00a83223e64f3932523a5235841a","c26d9df03c275729d3c1ce278b94c29878e6fafd","aa3e9a9c370e144dc8c072006f09f86ebc5ca4b9","015c92cd56c76e31a893d42f8bd3dad967bbb6d9","a2d4b04b69166d8f47bfb222e6db0851340a7dcf","410cc574f2fad7cc4c0da3d0b67a1219c1292f01","55a4dea7f263755fe52144c99c100c9c8f32399d","9228e695d642ab82db2eee6093e6b53fe03da2f5","d86f6e993bff7d1aa9f26850857ab6154623bd54","ae5f84cc864cd8e49d52aedc6b7b02e85ec97aa9","309eba67dbb9a3a2ec9085814bdfef230ec716c6","c9b66740759f250e58c4051a7e9a924cb0e34415","e96e7e9a8a04befa6b89b5be92ca23c91cf045f2","ef83c56a95b9dfe96560042e3241a9509bcba00b","f2277d8ab3bb8944c8906b9e64fe7cae96534aec","427a6273fd1f32bcf992bf2dfbd109bc40803dc4"],"pdfUrls":["https://www.guttmacher.org/sites/default/files/pdfs/pubs/journals/2210396.pdf"],"title":"Abortion in Context: Women's Experience In Two Villages in Thai Binh Province, Vietnam","doi":"10.2307/2950750","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.2307/2950750","venue":""}

It describes briefly the challenge of modelling combined economic, ecological and financial systems and sets out a series of objectives for modelling the socio-economic transition towards sustainability. It highlights modelling needs in relation to full employment, financial stability, and social equity under conditions of constrained resource consumption and ecological limits. The paper also provides a broad overview of the literatures relevant to the task in hand. It then describes two separate modelling approaches, developed by two different teams within WWWforEurope. One of these approaches, led by WIFO, uses a Dynamic New Keynesian (DYNK) model to explore the implications of different long-run equilibrium paths for energy consumption. The other approach, led by Surrey in collaboration with York University, is motivated primarily by the desire to integrate a comprehensive model of the financial economy into a model of a (resource and emission-constrained) real economy. This paper sets out the overarching structure of each of these approaches. It discusses the similarities and differences between the two approaches and makes some proposals for the management of subsequent milestones in relation to WP 205. 1 Corresponding author Milestone 38 – Final version 31st July 2014","inCitations":["36801abe7f5dc69cf463a4e9d2316d46067f2ffd","6d9d0c9170cc581522b2ca1ab56c7e14d79588c6","1fd9da766b45bc1cac78531ed9d681be52ba3cd2","4f86c6dfff76e6e43a2052b9d9181d7657d1040b","2741029f9aecca01648382523c7f8e94ac1fc3f7","ad2c4d51153e3123b47a496972f1bfe92331f4a9","5dadb64bbf19dea8a7f7fab0af71d837914e27cd","9624bdbd8d631f8ce3ec9f9b371420c63454592f","5dffd54c84d8e9e2242d6e2fb993a1234634af8e","8f7997f52788a57150752b479eb913dc4b5b88dd","9d6e93563f7f1db2f96f57be6168cd0ef0144f57","63b634e149f9ac407ed2ccce81ec42d5f2be8e8b","2272565d0ffb5e1eb2c8702d65872f99fd5df04a","c5fd62d2f94421ca83776df5184d1c9a1e32c876","305f4be376ea0290711fc50dfc007a19d642c6d6","5158dd7ac1afc62b88bdf31ca6a6eaaa32258ee1","ebc1d08cf18c9efcdb77032de533a12e7cb06751"],"pdfUrls":["https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/125724/1/WWWforEurope_WPS_no065_MS38.pdf","http://www.foreurope.eu/fileadmin/documents/pdf/Workingpapers/WWWforEurope_WPS_no065_MS38.pdf","https://www.wifo.ac.at/jart/prj3/wifo/resources/person_dokument/person_dokument.jart?mime_type=application/pdf&publikationsid=47497"],"title":"Foundations for an Ecological Macroeconomics: literature review and model development.","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

This paper is to investigate voltage standards for DC home microgrids. First, a DC home microgrid configuration is proposed. All home loads are divided into five groups for separate connection to a common DC bus. An alternative path is designed to supply the high-power load groups through the public AC grid with less power conversion stages, when local sources are deficient. Second, voltage levels and wire cross-sections for different load groups are discussed, according to line thermal limits, power losses, and voltage drops. The results show that, if 120 volts is chosen for the DC bus, higher voltage standard over 120 volts could not bring loss savings for load groups. It can also be concluded that, 24 V DC could be a standard only for extra-low power appliances in a small house or single room, because of big losses; instead, 48 V DC may be better suitable for lighting and low-power appliances, especially when most of them could be working on 48 V DC in future.","inCitations":["f3ba489b550cac3b5e30cd0597f8cf894ec4d899","57a2b45f019d36f90266f27c929ecdf87292dd78","59fd98af185e42b11298b7425e13f55f8485ed49","64d8517f761f81fc29a19598b6d2b9ce044da273","757c77b13bcba802be19e2a8630a1a4d779519ee","cd9817b4beff69c07e83d317ff183661c6160817","5b59a60d8d3fe3f7cc6fdb77d13cc00fc094e2cf","6bfb2533b66bc41e6650eca4c75c250bc15eb992","307ab5b76f940111c1df08d54d1f8b19ff2ccc23","ecea8a6dcedd4e9ae7b3890312aec2d2d260a498","6b87968e8ad47232f6ad54f6a52c4fe79bc2a2e5","e4de3d6a4051a824027a75b219de822d321bbb22","17b7aee726d2d05804fd533c83271eea7beba8be","be555724c5ddcd379f6d96d8843a12a970432a37","f92c155b32813678c95906fa38126dda22d40743","22b28aa21c298f77f666d8b5567683e70718ecb6","5027173a225b7057863155816af708ce056ea727","c4187e5408a11775fa5e823f621b0f6a27fe6fd8","92fc5baf6bc1694795d95b5a98ddc1e1a9e82d0f","5977e8869cb536087cb5a4693bc95c2fdbc923ee","0c5d354edb7a9f961f6e3e7fe6e037fbcbb953f0","dddffe967547f248119a6d297c0a2f2520ffdd88","063d2d9939ce0e8a6a577cff2189a153120a9995","28553448d80481df71b37af91effaf7d6e16e1fe","359e49ceb7bc57f948d5124c6fc1f13636fe9192","09e6a83de1aeadca752fd2325443d5a403d9e1e4","4a97439c8b6cccc7591eaa756cd03de29c7f50b4","2472cf8d0f57037ecab778590f36add756c06a23","ca7299e92831bb6b736b24987c83aa52725eba13","5f87c6cfe96dadc93d186176a19793280ba628b8","2a3a2419e64cfd7cdd232bca6cb87c453a3abcb2","a517191c2a990098b2d90058dfc5a07e11c54905","2fb8e10128fb20b8f3aba5adb47a129c78a83867","724ae1dff31e3fbe83fff430b3093fcbd4ced4dd","86deff5d0788402963f57d387e7e50298d960f4e","801dd4d80785a262f348ed115a7930666784eef4","dfa637e03414b15cf0d123fead025c9b8b599272","3245e6d6b1ed87ac65259dc53b149c667f8b3cec","e250cfb45e568fa98a791d926b895141c83b7424","975f7ec3b231d76363c52544ace4d3bccf2a4cd0"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"On voltage standards for DC home microgrids energized by distributed sources","doi":"10.1109/IPEMC.2012.6259203","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IPEMC.2012.6259203","venue":"Proceedings of The 7th International Power Electronics and Motion Control Conference"}

The framework allows to study the impact of different technology options at design level and use effective design Power, Performance and Area (PPA) to decide on right technology option. Design implementation flow is IR-drop aware, allowing integration of optimized Power Delivery Network (PDN) for different device/cell options. Using N5-like technology node assumptions (contacted poly and metallization pitch of 42 and 32nm), we generate digital PDKs for different device (finFET, 2 & 3 nanowires) and standard cell options (3, 2 or 1 fins & 7.5 or 6-Tracks cell height). Different PDKs have been used to implement and characterize a wire dominated circuit. Our study shows that the design PDN/IR-drop awareness is fundamental to complete DTCO approach for sub-10nm nodes. Using our dedicated design methodology we reach the IR-drop target of 2.5% VDD (on the lowest metal layers), while minimizing the area degradation induced by the PDN. Further, we demonstrate that such optimized PDN is mandatory to enable the 20% area gain when moving from 7.5 to 6-Tracks cell height. Finally, we show that the impact of different device options is in range of 15% Power, 2X Performance and 20% Area, further validating the need of a fully integrated DTCO.","inCitations":["0236889a8082863adce4a6a0e92f43227febf2ec","2bdc1bba1cd90faae803621923afc3f647380050","a11e8c8c89a6c2803fb1af69cbfcfc03b971771f","8dabc69fd1a1be07a2e5af2ff57917e6a0d30f0d","8b0006f28d17b05220d6f23ce56b3faa6361f68f","977c0440fa95603e9dea9e0ab84970bd64421413"],"pdfUrls":["http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3199712"],"title":"IR-drop aware Design & technology co-optimization for N5 node with different device and cell height options","doi":"10.1109/ICCAD.2017.8203764","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCAD.2017.8203764","venue":"2017 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD)"}

Such tools could greatly benefit resistance breeding, but their adoption is hampered by i) a lack of specificity to disease-related effects and ii) insufficient robustness to variation in reflectance caused by genotypic diversity and varying environmental conditions, which are fundamental elements of resistance breeding. We hypothesized that relying exclusively on temporal changes in canopy reflectance during pathogenesis may allow to specifically detect and quantify crop diseases while minimizing the confounding effects of genotype and environment. To test this hypothesis, we collected time-resolved canopy hyperspectral reflectance data for 18 diverse genotypes on infected and disease-free plots and engineered spectral-temporal features representing this hypothesis. Our results confirm the lack of specificity and robustness of disease assessments based on reflectance spectra at individual time points. We show that changes in spectral reflectance over time are indicative of the presence and severity of Septoria tritici blotch (STB) infections. Furthermore, the proposed time-integrated approach facilitated the delineation of disease from physiological senescence, which is pivotal for efficient selection of STB-resistant material under field conditions. A validation of models based on spectral-temporal features on a diverse panel of 330 wheat genotypes offered evidence for the robustness of the proposed method. This study demonstrates the potential of time-resolved canopy reflectance measurements for robust assessments of foliar diseases in the context of resistance breeding.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"In-Field Detection and Quantification of Septoria Tritici Blotch in Diverse Wheat Germplasm Using Spectral–Temporal Features","doi":"10.3389/fpls.2019.01355","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2019.01355","venue":"Front.

Electropermeabilized neoplastic rat liver epithelial (261B) cells were used to study Ca2+ sequestration, a process that reverses the elevated [Ca2+]i to resting levels and replenishes intracellular Ca2+ pools. Although I (1,4,5)P3-mobilized Ca2+ is readily sequestered into storage pools by the action of Ca2+-adenosine triphosphatases, Ca2+ mobilized by addition of the nonmetabolized inositol trisphosphate isomer I(2,4,5)P3 is not sequestered, suggesting that metabolism is necessary to eliminate the stimulus for Ca2+ release. Several inositol phosphate compounds were examined for their ability to lower the buffer [Ca2+] to determine if a specific I(1,4,5)P3 metabolite might be involved in stimulating Ca2+ sequestration; of these, I(1,3,4,5)P4 alone was found to induce Ca2+ sequestration, demonstrating a physiological role for this inositol trisphosphate metabolite.","inCitations":["c82e2d2b2ba053ec4e00163c0b57e492a88c23d0","d0bd5d88c32ed93d8f0dd40ecdd90c061d50b81b","9aad502acc5b65992fa73f0b867d93fd7db7b58c","a6a386b8ef9e4466031bc3ae5ed340264e5b7b2e","47f1a935597575fee0262db2b59364ffbe49946c","25de7a8b5cb2f324fa02fd8708426f5928b42a71","4e332f2d39e8249a3d37e5292d1ed8d6f13b9c1a","e9514c4d79debab413e8f3018395d0f79b10f4c0","fd6fee6f9e222c6e78518b2b69c6d7b9e78ce863","48d01a9cc414454ecd6208137f60cc58eb592565","f156722a86f97c5fea92b8bf06c735399c2b4c20","bfa275814f5ef64f024ae1605bb83fdfb11e828f","549af8fbbf8101d02c18cff09510dadc8e75ae47","913200af6e4d75972150c8b20fefe735e5b36713","4a0ce7ba2a254e21ef2b8667ab598095542d3e1d","7fb182234812872ba9ffaa661c2ace3aae6a8395","f86954d1d8804cb817fbd07614a0f0b957660eb9"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate induces Ca2+ sequestration in rat liver cells.","doi":"10.1126/science.2847317","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1126/science.2847317","venue":"Science"}

We placed 26 electrodes on the scalp overlying the sensorimotor area and recorded cortical potentials related to abduction of the index finger. The amplitudes and latencies of the potentials were normal in all patients except two, in whom the negative slope (NS') was absent. All patients had an abnormal topographic pattern of potentials compared with normal subjects. The initial slope of motor potential (isMP), which was focal and contralateral in the normal subjects, was diffuse and bilateral in the patients. The topography of the frontal peak of motor potential (fpMP) was more posterior in the patients than in normal subjects. The patterns found in this preliminary study indicate a derangement of sensorimotor cortex activity in voluntary movement as a consequence of cerebellar dysfunction.","inCitations":["233ce59d2fb845ca527993b1d7a34b3b8f78ae6a","32120ccb33c6e23a02eaf6de0fdc042a42cc3310","4cc874a4e2c96e0e5c05698d624210a14fd573c4","8500f1ab494d0ea44683f41a6ba60837f553baf9","dcc475badb0f560f68c8ec3924e7cd90f7e41aab","2374373a7a21d93aa41676439b7f27509f1240a3","31bcc06c5419c73e69cabfd8760a3648715d6b4d","f8c7f20396d529deb1d799353403ef2b1b6cd026","a68ee8664ee18c373a3622ae91d417720d307721","21c63afa8126098951b4d63a1b040deccbdfdb7b","18b330114d48783cdd2eec45ab4df6bcf3942dd3","a02fbbb6d7389206ce13ca289679b236374d98f6","8ccbfd0ca76dd77acc8627baf0f5c98f678d08d7"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Movement-related cortical potentials in patients with cerebellar degeneration.","doi":"10.1111/j.1600-0404.1993.tb04204.x","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0404.1993.tb04204.x","venue":"Acta neurologica Scandinavica"}

The evaluation plan provided here describes a detailed set of computer simulations to evaluate the ability of unitary HVAC equipment to address humidity control issues in generic commercial building types. The plan describes five different commercial buildings, including physical and thermal building characteristics, schedules for loads and operations, and requirements for ventilation. Eight locations have been selected to represent the range of climatic conditions and HVAC markets in which dehumidification is important. The cooling and dehumidification requirements for each of these buildings, in each location, are to be evaluated with each of seventeen HVAC equipment options. The complete set involves 1360 annual simulations. The results of these simulations will be used to identify the performance of the various humidity control options in different applications and will provide guidance to design engineers and building operators.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"EVALUATION PLAN Evaluating the Ability of Unitary Equipment to Maintain Adequate Space Humidity Levels: Phase 1","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

The identity and requirements of host receptors of Etx remain a matter of controversy. In the present study, we analysed the binding of proEtx or Etx to liposomes containing distearoylphosphatidylcholine (DSPC), cholesterol and sulfatide, or alternatively to detergent-solubilized lipids, using surface plasmon resonance (SPR). We also tested the influence of calcium on Etx or proEtx binding. Our findings show that the presence of sulfatide in liposomes increases both Etx and proEtx binding, and Etx binding is enhanced by calcium. These results were corroborated when SPR was conducted with immobilized toxin, since detergent-solubilized sulfatide increases its binding to Etx in the presence of calcium, but not to proEtx. Moreover, binding affinity is also affected, since the treatment of liposomes with sulfatase causes the dissociation rate constants (KD) in both proEtx and Etx to increase, especially in the case of proEtx in the presence of calcium. In addition, protein-lipid overlay assays corroborated the calcium-induced enhancement of Etx binding to sulfatide, and to lipids extracted from sulfatide-enriched rat brain lipid rafts. In conclusion, the present work highlights the role of sulfatide as an important element in the pathophysiology of Etx and reveals the influence of calcium in the interaction of Etx, but not of proEtx, with the target membrane.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Calcium enhances binding of Clostridium perfringens epsilon toxin to sulfatide.","doi":"10.1016/j.bbamem.2018.08.003","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbamem.2018.08.003","venue":"Biochimica et biophysica acta.

Dessa omfattar halsa och produktion, att framja positiva kanslotillstand och minimera negativa, samt om mojligheten att utfora naturliga beteenden. \n \nEnligt KRAVs betesregel ska mjolkkor under betesperioden ga pa bete minst 12,5 timmar per dygn samt ata minst sex kilo torrsubstans foder pa betet. Regeln upplevs dock svar att kontrollera och efterleva enligt revisorer och lantbrukare. Darfor har KRAV tagit fram ett arbetsmaterial med parametrar som ska framja betesgangen hos djur. Examensarbetet ingar i detta. \n \nBete och ekologisk produktion har flera valfardsfordelar for mjolkkor. Bete ger storre mojlighet till naturliga beteenden sasom att beta, minskar aggressiva interaktioner mellan djuren samt ar en mjukare yta att ligga ner pa samt sta pa. Flera studier har visat att bete minskar forekomsten av halta och att bete och ekologisk produktion minskar forekomsten av juverinflammation. Flertalet studier har ocksa visat att mjolkkor foredrar att vara pa bete mot att vara i stall om de far valja, sarskilt pa natten och for att ligga ner. \n \nDock kan vissa problem oka pa bete eller inom ekologisk produktion. Parasiter ar vanligare eftersom mjolkkorna vistas ute samt att man inom ekologisk produktion inte behandlar forebyggande eller rutinmassigt med lakemedel eller kemiska bekampningsmedel. Men det finns andra satt att losa detta pa, bland annat fungerar betesrotation, dar djuren far byta till ett nytt bete en gang under sommaren for att minska parasitmangden. Mjolkkor ar sarskilt kansliga for varmestress, pa grund av deras hoga mjolkproduktion. Detta kan bli ett problem pa bete under sommaren. Att ge djuren skugga eller att de kan ga in i stallet mitt pa dagen ar satt att losa detta pa. \n \nDe parametrar KRAV tagit fram som forslag har undersokts i studien. Deras mal ar att framja betesgangen och det anses att de gor det. Bland annat foreslas att mjolkkorna ska kunna ha mojlighet att ga ut en stor del av dagen, att de ska fa begransad mangd grovfoder inomhus och att vagen ut till betet ska vara separat fran vagen in till stallet. Forutom dessa anses det att skugga bor laggas till som parameter, eftersom det har flera fordelar for mjolkkor. \n \nUtover detta undersoktes kontrollrapporter utforda av Lansstyrelsen Vastra Gotaland under aren 2010-2011, som riktade beteskontroller. Det undersoktes hur vanligt det var med brister gallande beteslagstiftnigen och det sags att av 89 arenden hade 25 brister. Det var ovanligare med brister om man var ansluten till KRAV, men da materialet var litet ar det svart att dra slutsatser. \n \nSlutsatserna som dragits i arbetet ar att bete har flera djurvalfardsfordelar och med en bra skotsel av betet fungerar det val och gynnar de ekologiska mjolkkorna att ga pa bete. Betet ar extra viktigt for mjolkkor nattetid och KRAVs parametrar anses vara ett bra satt att framja betesdriften.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://stud.epsilon.slu.se/8425/1/Vahaniitty_J_150825.pdf"],"title":"Hur påverkas djurvälfärden av bete för mjölkkor inom ekologisk produktion och hur kan betesregeln utformas","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

The microstructure analysis revealed that tempering process resulted in the carbide precipitation and coarsening of martensite structures. The nanohardness of each phase (martensite and ferrite) decreased with increasing the tempering temperature. The ultimate tensile strength had a linear relationship with nanohardness ratio of martensite and ferrite. On the other hand, the uniform elongation firstly did not change by tempering at the temperature below 400 °C, but then decreased by tempering at the temperature above 400 °C with decreasing the nanohardness ratio. It was concluded that the nanohardness ratio can be a good parameter for controlling the mechanical properties of dual phase steels.","inCitations":["3569bc3e65805f572b54b466df9aa008e8cfea51","9a8d63969e660bd851a81182d5bc3443f6d9a3c8","186cc55b27d37a6dabb5945b6d92c4622e57c8ef","03a65cbcea13d90dddc4005b1526d1c5dbf3ee6b","7a80e17eae8ac4923ba484cc0b832b498b6aa641","f024b21c69e029122e278d85910c528fce8dc240"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Influence of Tempering on Mechanical Properties of Ferrite and Martensite Dual Phase Steel","doi":"10.1016/j.matpr.2015.07.372","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.matpr.2015.07.372","venue":""}

The liquid phase from metallic liquid to sulfide melt to oxide melt is described by a single model developed within the framework of the quasichemical formalism. The model reflects the existence of strong short-range ordering in oxide, sulfide and oxysulfide liquid. Two ranges of maximum short-range ordering in the Fe-O system at approximately FeO and Fe2O3 compositions are taken into account. Parameters of thermodynamic models have been optimized to reproduce all available thermodynamic and phase equilibrium data. The thermodynamic modeling of the Fe-O-S system performed in the present study is of particular importance for the description of the solubility of oxygen in matte.","inCitations":["862214402057a6a67b86e04a0c259913981bff0b","131e86fbbcd00c6677d1ecb74662c2dc7dc00396"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Critical assessment and thermodynamic modeling of the Cu–Fe–O system","doi":"10.1016/j.calphad.2013.04.001","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.calphad.2013.04.001","venue":""}

VINC is also known as NEAT1 or Men epsilon RNA. It is localized in the nuclear paraspeckles of several murine as well as human cell lines and is essential for paraspeckle formation. We demonstrate that VINC interacts with the paraspeckle protein, P54nrb through three different protein interaction regions (PIRs) one of which (PIR-1) is localized near the 5' end while the other two (PIR-2, PIR-3) are localized near the 3' region of VINC. Our studies suggest that VINC may interact with P54nrb through a novel mechanism which is different from that reported for protein coding RNAs.","inCitations":["849dc416bda366a8b5ed42e32d3cc86bc3bdd1c1","df53d4986b05fb053fc70bff0a3e44d6789e15c9","51dc842c899a32e3274bfb78b422532218b1baeb","900892604a8ca8786098d3a2b9dee4b77c782824","cc70301455f82f43a9db6db1970810ddff7881fd","a606bb82bd0f1dfc1469cd602d925fc47a6d409b","a220f789a0cd391d6f07260de6ee49b6aab37c0c","56f42fce679b89c2d4a33cfd45ff3f5b55589e1e","6fa1268ceeffd70ef0ac9995e450986ca3cf0659","f4bc6519e15659e7d7d318b13115ad02b890bd21","37487b3733099cc07d8a1fce8c4378f59cf73c60","0645d46b232c44637b5b20822ac1c8e3fbd7b5ed","45a3312b46209fec0a87f77d62efec7f313349a9","816eb81751a06e2bbbcfcd693981f14474593366","9470812029c82f7e58e9281a5aed18910cc4052e","38521fac1df3c978e5d0d29d0d7e93675c3e80ca","061c30ccdebb714259522c392542e45e93059d3e","fa189bb2a1c6c0f613774032db8d672406e2b0d0","1a23036e3c762d7effc3e32a3f9f212ed56e7c0d","e638dd55101a92b8080c82827a1c3e975f744490","3e36f3574019b63b1c72397a6bc45ff09a8bfd6a","e78ec888fadc727ea3d27e2444b49eb16d282fe1","90a67177c51570471165bb96d3553b4af39a6d16","b09f963b15beec896daccf1cd286f65575a73574"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Identification of protein interaction regions of VINC/NEAT1/Men epsilon RNA.","doi":"10.1016/j.febslet.2010.03.003","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.febslet.2010.03.003","venue":"FEBS letters"}

This study aimed to examine whether the presence of the fern stratum acts as a biotic environmental filter on the woody species seedling bank in a semi-deciduous forest remnant (Atlantic biome), Southern Brazil. Two experiments were developed in areas with ferns (F) and ferns-free (NF): a) richness and abundance of woody seedling bank were determined in 10 plots (25 m) in each area; b) seedlings abundance of Actinostemon concolor (Spreng.) Müll. Arg., Aspidosperma polyneuron Müll. Arg., Euterpe edulis Mart., Guarea kunthiana A. Juss. and Inga marginata Kunth were monitored for a year in three areas F, NF and an area with ferns whose fronds were cut (CF). In this experiment, it was used five plots (4 m) in each area. The abundance of seedlings (considering all species) was higher in F areas and ferns positively and negatively affected the abundance of A. polyneuron and G. kunthiana, respectively. It is possible to conclude that ferns worked as a selective environmental filter for some woody species.","inCitations":["03a7cd73b3721ec143e62b8f52d721dc5b2b079d"],"pdfUrls":["http://periodicos.uem.br/ojs/index.php/ActaSciBiolSci/article/download/31135/pdf"],"title":"Ferns influence on the woody species seedling bank in semi-deciduous forest , Southern Brazil","doi":"10.4025/actascibiolsci.v38i3.31135","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.4025/actascibiolsci.v38i3.31135","venue":""}
