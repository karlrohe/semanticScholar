Specifically, researchers have not explored the relation between affiliative, aggressive and/or self-defeating spontaneous conversational humor and positive and negative friendship quality in middle childhood. Scholars theorize that affiliative spontaneous conversational humor contributes to positive friendship quality while aggressive and self-defeating spontaneous conversational humor contribute to negative friendship quality (Klein & Kuiper, 2006). Moreover, friends' social behaviors are often interdependent and \" work together \" to influence each child's perception of friendship (Bukowski, Motzoi, & Meyer, 2009); therefore, it is also expected that dyadic spontaneous conversational humor is associated with friendship quality in middle childhood and that dyad-level variables (i.e., behavioral similarity of dyad, duration of friendship) are related to the dyadic nature of children's spontaneous conversational humor production. Participants were 250 fifth graders (125 dyads; M age = 10.33 years, SD = .54) from the Washington DC metropolitan area. Affiliative, aggressive, and self-defeating spontaneous conversational humor data were coded from videotaped discussion between mutually nominated, same-sex best friends. Positive and negative friendship quality data were collected via survey report. An Actor Partner Interdependence Model (APIM) was used to explore relations between actor and partner spontaneous conversational humor and actor-rated friendship quality in middle childhood (Kenny, Kashy, & Cook, 2006). Finally, multiple regression analyses were used to test the direct effects of dyad-level variables on dyadic spontaneous conversational humor. APIM analyses revealed significant positive relations between actor affiliative spontaneous conversational humor and actor-rated absence of conflict and betrayal; actor self-defeating spontaneous conversational humor and both actor-rated intimate disclosure and total positive friendship quality; and partner self-defeating spontaneous conversational humor and actor-rated companionship. Actor affiliative and actor aggressive spontaneous conversational humor production were negatively and positively associated with actor-rated negative interactions, respectively. Five dyadic actor-partner interactions were significantly related to positive and negative friendship quality. Multiple regression analyses indicated that friendship duration was negatively associated with dyadic aggressive spontaneous conversational humor, meaning that the longer best friends reported knowing each other, the less they used interrelated aggressive spontaneous conversational humor.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://drum.lib.umd.edu/bitstream/handle/1903/16163/Wimsatt_umd_0117E_15696.pdf?isAllowed=y&sequence=1","http://drum.lib.umd.edu/bitstream/handle/1903/16163/Wimsatt_umd_0117E_15696.pdf?isAllowed=y&sequence=1"],"title":"Title of Document: HUMOR AND FRIENDSHIP QUALITY IN MIDDLE CHILDHOOD","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Here we report the first familial (three siblings) case of total anomalous pulmonary venous return associated with 15q11.2 deletion. Array comparative genomic hybridization identified a ~395 kb deletion at 15q11.2 in patient 1. This deletion was confirmed by fluorescence in situ hybridization in patients 1 and 3 and their asymptomatic father. No deleterious mutation was identified by proband-only exome sequencing of patient 1. One healthy sibling and their mother did not carry the deletion. This deletion is often inherited from asymptomatic parents with an estimated low penetrance of 10.4%. Conversely, we observed high penetrance of this deletion, but secondary copy-number variants or pathogenic variants were not detected in this family.","inCitations":["01fb877ddced019ef51c6a2ad6139b18d31ff861","e6cfbf85f4f3651b0b789a6b70a55137a25ecc5b"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Familial total anomalous pulmonary venous return with 15q11.2 (BP1-BP2) microdeletion","doi":"10.1038/s10038-018-0499-7","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1038/s10038-018-0499-7","venue":"Journal of Human Genetics"}

Washburn's equation is generalized to explain the relative effects of the interfacial viscosities, interfacial tension, and wetting during displacement through such a pore. The limits on the creeping motions between Haines jumps are approximately identified with the limits of static stability. The predictions of a prior qualitative theory for the relative effects of the interfacial viscosities and of interfacial tension during tertiary oil recovery are fully supported. Further, the interfacial dilatational viscosity is indicated to be relatively more important than the interfacial shear viscosity. 41 references, 10 figures.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Interfacial effects upon displacement in sinusoidal capillaries","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

We explore an alternative model for such cases emphasizing the slack in the issue agenda available to parties with which to construct viable identities or niches they can employ to mobilize cognitively-limited voters.

The main idea of this post-tabular Statistical Disclosure Control (SDC) technique is to perturb table cells with random noise which is defined via some noise distribution in a consistent and reproducable way. Thus it is ensured that any given table cell to which the same units contribute is always perturbed identically. The package makes use of the ptable package which allows to define probabilities of the random noise in form of ptables. Such ptables define probabilities of transitioning from a start value (which are often the orginal cell counts) to a target values and can be used as input for R package cellKey and also τ-argus (Hundepool et al. 2004). The package was developed within the framework of the Eurostat-funded project “Open Source tools for perturbative confidentiality methods”. This project involves the practical implementation of the cellkey method into SDC tools. To simplify testing and development, separate packages are provided that implement the method (cellKey) and the generation of the required perturbation tables (ptable) in R. As suggested in (Leaver and Marley 2011) and illustrated in Giessing (2016), the (ptable) package implements a maximum entropy approach to compute the transition probabilities taking into account certain thresholds of the desired noise distribution. cellKey makes use of these perturbation tables and allows to compute perturbed (weighted) frequency and magnitude tables. It allows for an easy way to specify complex hierarchies using the sdcHierarchies and proves to be quite fast cellKey consistent perturbation of statistical tables Bernhard Meindl (bernhard.meindl@statistik.gv.at) Tobias Enderle (Tobias.Enderle@destatis.de) September 2019","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://statswiki.unece.org/download/attachments/225935487/SDC2019_S7_Austria%20and%20Germany_cellKey_Meindl_AD.pdf?api=v2&modificationDate=1569312640033&version=1"],"title":"cellKey-consistent perturbation of statistical tables","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Similarly, they spawned a vigorous railroad supply industry in Chicago, including the Pullman Palace Car Company. To deal with the enormous transportation bottleneck that Chicago became with the arrival of so many lines, city and business leaders were compelled to deal with safety and rail crossing issues that resulted in, among other things, elevated lines. Finally, as the industry contracted in the late twentieth century, it played a major formative role in the redevelopment of its own and related properties, triggering alternative uses, including bicycle paths, nature trails, shopping malls, and office complexes such as the Illinois Center, and parks in Chicago and its suburbs. David Young connects a wide variety of subjects in this informative treatment of a pivotal aspect of Chicago’s development. His research, based upon secondary sources, is extensive. The book is well written, although at times it borders upon being encyclopedic. Nonetheless, Young has given us an important, quite readable, and well-documented contribution that those interested in Chicago, urban history in general, or transportation history, will find very useful.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Death Rode the Rails: American Railroad Accidents and Safety, 1828-1965 (review)","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

A number of flaviviruses are neurotropic, causing severe encephalitis and even death. Type I interferons (IFNs) are the first line of defense of the innate immune system against flavivirus infection. IFNs elicit the concerted action of numerous interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) to restrict both virus infection and replication. Viperin (virus-inhibitory protein, endoplasmic reticulum-associated, IFN-inducible) is an ISG with broad-spectrum antiviral activity against multiple flaviviruses in vitro. Its activity in vivo restricts neurotropic infections to specific regions of the central nervous system (CNS). However, the cell types in which viperin activity is required are unknown. Here we have examined both the regional and cell-type specificity of viperin in the defense against infection by several model neurotropic flaviviruses.MethodsViral burden and IFN induction were analyzed in vivo in wild-type and viperin−/− mice infected with Langat virus (LGTV). The effects of IFN pretreatment were tested in vitro in primary neural cultures from different brain regions in response to infection with tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV), West Nile virus (WNV), and Zika virus (ZIKV).ResultsViperin activity restricted nonlethal LGTV infection in the spleen and the olfactory bulb following infection via a peripheral route. Viperin activity was also necessary to restrict LGTV replication in the olfactory bulb and the cerebrum following CNS infection, but not in the cerebellum. In vitro, viperin could restrict TBEV replication in primary cortical neurons, but not in the cerebellar granule cell neurons. Interferon-induced viperin was also very important in primary cortical neurons to control TBEV, WNV, and ZIKV.ConclusionsOur findings show that viperin restricts replication of neurotropic flaviviruses in the CNS in a region- and cell-type-specific manner.

Although melamine affects the rise in intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i), reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and proapoptotic pathway activation, the mechanism of upstream Ca2+ signaling is unknown. Because melamine has some structural similarities with l-amino acids, which endogenously activate Ca2+-sensing receptors (CSR), we examined the effect of melamine on CSR-induced Ca2+ signaling and apoptotic cell death. We show here that melamine activates CSR, causing a sustained Ca2+ entry in the renal epithelial cell line, LLC-PK1. Moreover, such CSR stimulation resulted in a rise in [Ca2+]i, leading to enhanced ROS production. Furthermore, melamine-induced elevated [Ca2+]i and ROS production caused a dose-dependent increase in apoptotic (by DAPI staining, DNA laddering, and annexin V assay) and necrotic (propidium iodide staining) cell death. Upon examining the downstream mechanism, we found that transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1), which increases extracellular matrix genes and proapoptotic signaling, was also upregulated at lower doses of melamine, which could be due to an early event inducing apoptosis. Additionally, cells exposed to melamine displayed a rise in pERK activation and lactate dehydrogenase release resulting in cytotoxicity. These results offer a novel insight into the molecular mechanisms by which melamine exerts its effect on CSR, causing a sustained elevation of [Ca2+]i, leading to ROS generation, fibronectin production, proapoptotic pathway activation, and renal cell damage. Together, these results thus suggest that melamine-induced apoptosis and/or necrosis may subsequently result in acute kidney injury and promote kidney stone formation.","inCitations":["74581626f50eb4d78f34ea9c8eae608fe889ee08","6c2fe312c30e61dcfff93d03cdf63ae273945c31"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Melamine induces Ca2+-sensing receptor activation and elicits apoptosis in proximal tubular cells.","doi":"10.1152/ajpcell.00225.2016","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1152/ajpcell.00225.2016","venue":"American journal of physiology.

A total of 270 veterans were referred to a cognitive disorders clinic at a VA medical center and completed neuropsychological, affective, and cognitive screening measures. Caregivers completed the DSRS. Principal components analysis identified a 2-factor solution. After controlling for age and education, memory and language were related to the Cognitive factor, whereas attention, processing speed, visuospatial processing, and executive functioning were related to both Cognitive and Self-Care factors. Neither factors correlated with depression. The total DSRS score was able to differentiate patients by the Mini-Mental State Examination scores and diagnoses of mild cognitive impairment and dementia (mixed vascular Alzheimer, vascular dementia, and Alzheimer disease). A cut-score >15 was optimal for detecting dementia in a mixed clinical sample (sensitivity=0.41, specificity=0.79), with a posttest probability of 74%. This study suggests that the DSRS improves detection of dementia and requires minimal effort to implement.","inCitations":["92427cd63d624322250bd6a9aab178ab05ddc468"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Validation and diagnostic utility of the dementia rating scale in a mixed dementia population.","doi":"10.1097/WAD.0000000000000014","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1097/WAD.0000000000000014","venue":"Alzheimer disease and associated disorders"}

Nausea, vomiting, need for rescue, sedation, extrapyramidal effects, QTc intervals, and time to postanesthesia care unit discharge were evaluated with a third-party blind design.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThere was no intergroup difference in any measure of efficacy or toxicity. Haloperidol and ondansetron subjects (78.2% and 76.8%) had complete response. Postoperatively, prolonged QTc occurred in 28.9% and 22.1% (N.S.).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn a mixed surgical population, the efficacy and toxicity of postoperative nausea and vomiting prophylaxis with haloperidol 1 mg was not significantly different from ondansetron 4 mg.","inCitations":["e557a2fcc141c1923ef04b03b48c31276c0d5beb","744f4c70dd158ada44d15c1617eca12199c795e0","6a4443000b6a32e458961a9d0c9a73618b7f2880","eec6c32fed4d5fe96b5e5d12d64227b2a1a88ee0","275298673ddf0a123b8d3b5ac798425c1fabf927","3818b748287bc6202d2de80ae0e91e85113fce42","6d7b6c01def2a81856a55f53531a1541b6aedd9e","3517092d4423c7990aa41d31acf258c667cc7c8a","bb418226c1a541180cd80dceeb002871521eae0d","e8ada8fab5b1ac15579da473ce8aeeb15308e3fe","f9cdce994c2ebcaab5a72cda65f9976e02c5a4c7","d01ec9d8c14f3c1ae7750fd3b38aa3be24e9244c","726e70ab6213f6390c51a65812795b1b90d91162","392f9cb59452a7a5c600f902f5f28ca6b14cbc55","a9c92d937203e10b139840a6f7050c86452e166e","ad60ce08380289ae34b24164a23fa2a9c47de80f","4d30c6cdf2658a7812d985c0ca1c205755f1816e","22bf8951eb12955b217a6eaa4e9a17c8247f590f","803bd47e99f6aee70e4a635783f20630f0833526","3cc134a6b7cc5241d15d8214cb93a76e28945706","c5d8ace037f29db5bf1092b550bfe0bf0b22dd46","40611f7a3e8bb4134e2fe9949061e0e52bea022d","5bc762533ae992fdf8ee6547d91d32386b486267","fb197521165ccba346de290d2ba48ec9cf262b8c","e74ba7f1a91b4bdb2a417c7c49c388f2b194bee2","70ed44603b0307598eca0cbaa047caeee09ce77a"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Haloperidol versus ondansetron for prophylaxis of postoperative nausea and vomiting.","doi":"10.1213/ane.0b013e3181609022","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1213/ane.0b013e3181609022","venue":"Anesthesia and analgesia"}

Une forêt primaire à Gilbertiodendron dewevrei et trois habitats d'origine anthropique (forêt secondaire, jachère et zone de contact jachère/forêt secondaire (lisière)) ont été investigués de mai 2009 à avril 2010. 1275 spécimens répartis entre 24 espèces et 5 familles inventoriées ont permis de quantifier des différences de composition et d'abondances entre un habitat non perturbé et des milieux anthropisés, ainsi qu'entre une lisière et des habitats adjacents. Nos résultats montrent une distribution non uniforme des Rongeurs dans les quatre milieux. La richesse et la diversité sont élevées en lisière et faibles en forêt primaire. Chaque milieu héberge une densité relative différente. Les plus fortes densités sont observées en forêt secondaire et jachère; la plus faible est observée en forêt primaire. Les abondances diffèrent significativement entre les habitats, à l'exception de la paire forêt secondaire - jachère. Les paramètres dans la lisière diffèrent de ceux des habitats adjacents, traduisant l'existence d'un effet de lisière. Les équitabilités faibles obtenues dans tous les habitats traduisent l'instabilité relative de cet écosystème forestier. Le test de χ2 atteste l'existence de l'effet « saison » sur les abondances des Rongeurs. De même, ce test confirme l'existence de l'effet « activités anthropiques » sur les abondances dans les milieux anthropisés, mais pas en forêt primaire.","inCitations":["61c0f7691eda653dfced7f1f1a3c22a328eefd5a","eef77172b81f922c2a10caa1021cb3f28fe3223c","7525395dc87c1147f20f32abeca37714a91bfd74","ccae33017115b44c4fa586e0dd2db89935c9758a"],"pdfUrls":["https://orbi.uliege.be/bitstream/2268/119245/1/2012.iyongo.tcs.pdf"],"title":"Anthropisation et effets de lisière : Impacts sur la diversité des rongeurs dans la Réserve Forestière de Masako (Kisangani, R.D.

A method is proposed which enables one to take effectively into account the actually nonadditive character of the lateral forces within the framework of the quasichemical approximation (QCA) and requires a slight modification only of some conventional formulas for the thermodynamic functions. It is shown that the inclusion of nonadditivity in the lateral interactions between the atoms of a lattice gas system strongly influences the predictions of the theory with regards to the critical parameters of the system, although the qualitative behavior of the thermodynamic functions with the variation of temperature ...","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"The quasichemical approximation for a lattice gas model with nonadditive lateral interactions","doi":"10.1063/1.444945","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1063/1.444945","venue":""}

Workers’ issues are considered to be a source of key inventory data to assess social impacts, and are crucial in moving towards social sustainability. There is a need to develop a social inventory database for evaluating social impacts of products and services. This study aimed at the development of a social intensity dataset using an input–output analysis framework. The 2005 Asian International input–output table is used in this work. Six social issues are considered: total employment, paid workers, vulnerable employment, wages, fatal, and non-fatal occupational injuries. To verify the acceptability of this study, an estimation of total social footprint deduced from final consumption rates was carried out. The social intensities associated with 10 countries and 76 economic sectors were constructed. The results show that the social intensities from cradle to gate the agricultural sector has the highest in terms of total employment and vulnerable employment. Meanwhile, the mining sector in China has a higher non-fatal and fatal occupational injuries than the agriculture sector, secondary sector, and tertiary sector. The public administration sector and the education and research sector had a higher wages intensity than any other sectors due to these sectors being labor intensive and having higher wages. The social intensity in terms of total employment, paid workers, vulnerable employment, non-fatal injuries, and fatal accident cases in the developing countries was higher than the developed countries whereas wages intensity in developing countries was lower than that of developed countries. The social footprints resulting from the final consumption of each country show that the social footprints had transferred from the developing countries to the developed countries. Exports from China to the USA, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore have a significant social impact in these countries.","inCitations":["961f84a02637d4b64deeebbfc020df7f715165cf"],"pdfUrls":["https://res.mdpi.com/sustainability/sustainability-08-01135/article_deploy/sustainability-08-01135.pdf?attachment=1&filename=","http://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/8/11/1135/pdf"],"title":"Development of Social Intensity Database Using Asian International Input–Output Table for Social Life Cycle Assessment","doi":"10.3390/su8111135","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.3390/su8111135","venue":""}

The 5 D 1 lifetime at 45 K is 7 μs when excited through the 5 D 2 manifold of Eu 3+ but is equal to the 5 D 4 (Tb 3+ ) lifetime when excited through that manifold. These results together with the temperature dependence of the Tb 3+ →Eu 3+ transfer rate are interpreted as direct evidence for a nonradiative transfer from the 5 D 4 (Tb 3+ ) manifold to the 5 D 1 (Eu 3+ ) manifold. The transfer rate at high temperatures supports the conjecture that the cross relaxation transfer at these temperatures is mainly via the 7 F 1 (Eu 3+ ) manifold.","inCitations":["1057d28203e6e64414b2c10018ea09ea9ee45232"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Direct evidence for excitation transfer from the 5D4 manifold of Tb3+ to the 5D1 manifold of Eu3+ in Tb0.66Eu0.33P5O14","doi":"10.1016/0022-2313(86)90072-4","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/0022-2313%2886%2990072-4","venue":""}

Study design This is a review of 12 cases of isolated fetal ascites managed at the fetal medicine unit at the Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle. The work-up for ascites included detailed ultrasound examination, checking maternal blood group and testing for the presence of antibodies, as well as maternal infection screening and fetal karyotyping. Results Ten out of the 12 pregnancies had a viable fetal outcome, with two babies (20%) requiring further bowel surgery. Ascites resolved spontaneously in three pregnancies (30%) antenatally and in two babies (20%) few weeks after delivery. Conclusion Isolated fetal ascites with normal karyotype and negative infection screen carries a good prognosis, with spontaneous resolution in most of the cases. However the parents should be counselled as regards the possibility of need for surgery or the presence of underlying syndromes.","inCitations":["4a80334dbf13101eec7bcb2007af033cbd495b8f","145551ff585b323dfb0882ce4043ec72e3314f9b","47ebe3ab175972495cf067424f7bb3fb6c40a1e9","a77ec2e9e08ff9d8da5063e24412f92e6ebb1464","d3cce03f66f40f9e0148e17fb661af76c4a102a0","d8619df8f8f9ff8a3326fe7d576c0509286e311c"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"The outcome of isolated fetal ascites","doi":"10.1016/j.ejogrb.2007.05.007","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejogrb.2007.05.007","venue":""}

In this paper I use a New Keynesian model with a financial accelerator to study the behaviour of interest and prices under both a \"technology boom-bust\" driven by changes in expectation about TFP, and a \"credit boom-bust\" driven by changes in expectations about the efficiency of the financial sector. While the two scenarios are similar in that they both lead to a run-up and then sharp drop-off in new capital and debt, I show that the behaviour of interest and prices depends critically on the nature of the new-shock driving the overaccumulation. In particular, the boom-phase of the TFP boom-bust is characterized by below-trend inflation or deflation, whereas that of the credit boom-bust is characterized by above-trend but low inflation. In contrast, inflation falls below-trend in the bust phases of both. I show that consistent with results elsewhere in the literature, stricter inflation-targeting fails to pull the economy toward the efficient equilibrium during the boom phase of the TFP boom-bust. In contrast, stricter inflation targeting pushes the economy closer to the flexible-price response during the boom-phase of the credit boom-bust. In both cases however, conditional on realization of overaccumulation, in inflation-targeting pulls the economy towards the flexible price equilibrium.","inCitations":["786ac0627b4e53386e27624d8c1c4a804508369f","4a8e0f2fa4941d4243c83f86effbfd3e4443bdbc"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Overaccumulation, Interest, and Prices","doi":"10.1111/jmcb.12468","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1111/jmcb.12468","venue":""}

Bone maturity evaluation is very important in orthodontic treatment, because there are many individual variations in growth and development such as time, duration and velocity of the growth. Nutritional status during pregnancy and infant period will influence the growth and the development of bone. Protein diet is an important factor, which will determine the optimal calcification during bone growth and development stages. Bone calcification, in orthodontics, can be used to estimate the bone maturity for diagnosis and treatment planning. The purpose of this study was to recognize ones ability to surpass calcium and phosphor deficiency because of pre and postnatal protein deficiency. There were three groups of samples of Rattus norvegicus rats. The first group was the control group with standard diet, the second was the infant group with pre and postnatal protein deficiency, and the third group was young rat at weaning age with pre and postnatal protein deficiency supplemented with enough protein in the diet. Bone calcification stage was analyzed: 1) Histologically by measuring epiphyseal width on right femur; 2) by measuring calcium and phosphor concentration on left femur with Spectrophotometry Atomic Absorption and spectroscopy ultra light visible. The data were analyzed by one way ANOVA continued by t test. The result showed that: 1) there was significant (p 0.05); 2) there was significant calcium and phosphor concentration on bone between group I, II and III (p < 0.01). It was concluded that bone calcification damage because of pre and post natal protein deficiency was an irreversible process. Protein supplement after bone calcification could not restore the condition.","inCitations":["b38f7833f2b1da0eb5ffbb8a4493b27ee9693575","dae553e48ce093eea061ff589884899471dac75e","cef7c662477cdc4245ff80cef1c6d3457fb2e90c"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Reversibilitas kalsifikasi tulang akibat kekurangan protein pre dan post natal (Reversibility of bone calcification on pre and post natal protein deficiency)","doi":"10.20473/j.djmkg.v38.i3.p115-119","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.20473/j.djmkg.v38.i3.p115-119","venue":""}

The deliberations of a working party convened by the committee to evaluate recently expressed concerns that the changes in the NHS threaten research, especially clinical trials to evaluate new treatments, are reported. A survey of contributors to trials coordinated by the committee showed that half are now experiencing difficulties in continuing to participate in clinical trials. The two major problems identified were lack of time and of staff, especially for NHS staff in non-teaching hospitals. Recent changes in junior doctors' hours and proposed reductions in the length of time for training will exacerbate this. It is possible to identify the direct and indirect excess costs of conducting research in the NHS, but currently the mechanism does not exist to designate funds specifically for this purpose.

Specifically, the study determines the impact of reforms on banking sector performance and also assesses the nexus between capital adequacy and banking sector performance. Time series data for the period 1993 to 2014 was used. As an analytical tool, the study uses unit root test to determine the stationary state of the variables. We also employed the Johansson co-integration and error correction model (ECM) statistical techniques to establish both short-run and long-run dynamic relationships between the endogenous and exogenous variables. The empirical findings indicate that financial regulation significantly impacts the banking sector performance while financial regulation has both short-run and long-run dynamic relationships with the banking sector performance in Nigeria. It was found that the four-period lag of capital adequacy negatively affects banking sector performance and is not statistically significant. The paper suggests that the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) should continually make public the impacts that the various financial regulations and reforms have on the performance of Nigerian banks. Majority of the policies on financial regulation by the apex bank (CBN) need to be long-run which can enable confidence of stakeholders, shareholders and the general public in the Nigerian banking industry when critically evaluated.","inCitations":["e44e29d7f9f8f54194de295bc71f397f4a4bf8e4","7a24598a525b69428b81ae126eeefa5b90ace280","de89a93e04c3b174f6662ad6a536ca8ac70d4189","37e94238631c839c3a3e84472b54092fea77047b","a882cdf994829ddbefee072ac5765eabd29173b5","9b545a88a4aa1bff880fb8d47f28a2d6f58c12a9","1162b27a7c4020e781fa3d6f051fc9414016b67e"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Empirical Assessment on Financial Regulations and Banking Sector Performance","doi":"10.1515/jcbtp-2017-0024","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1515/jcbtp-2017-0024","venue":""}

These advances in basic science are reflected in medicine in the form of improved diagnostic methods and better therapeutic tools. Perhaps the greatest benefit is the improved ability to identify at an early stage patients who are at high risk for atherosclerosis, providing clinicians the opportunity to proceed swiftly with intensive lipid-lowering therapy for the prevention of cardiovascular complications. Recent clinical trials have shown that such an approach is not only cost-effective but saves lives while improving the quality of life. They also emphasize the important role physicians can have in prevention. More than half of patients with premature CAD have a familial form of dyslipoproteinemia. This review of the genetics of atherogenic lipoprotein disorders underscores the importance of identifying major genetic defects. It also stresses the need to take into account multifactorial etiologies and clustering of risk factors, as well as gene-gene and gene-environment interactions in assessing the atherogenic potential of a lipid transport disorder. Table 2 summarizes the key points in the diagnosis, clinical implications, and treatment of the major inherited atherogenic dyslipidemias.","inCitations":["ee5f3741be5fca703c4e1a8c3f3a22446c145e95","9aa2327d993ebc9f1169547b31c61bd1ed7c826d","b6db8429630a33bd0c1b8bdbeb50c40f1270a47c","619b2c64cec50533f1c2fb4b84fadf40dcdcff75","fad861b0318c63b9e0c93e49a0190140bfe25dcf","dea604ceb608613a87613476f0fac6a5b2c6099d","85dfd95da7d5053353e042c1b4778667c0cc4e24","ee9e6b9e6888c9e3fdc418aec474166c3080c2ee","55663bd9e8b36eab31894ac0d7e09c528dc01582","0ead3ffd3ba3b6f12b6c355859ec4ff97d65b693","37e877999a8851579a90593f74675a9f0daec701","9428c2c833ca971d2ec29aca56fa2543c9a4019a","a992da08f29767833c2b98d61920b2245c14ed1b","e2bb14781afee96bb8d89c66c1547a5a8e0249fa","fb2740eade818c847dac3b5cef2990ea3f454b83","da10fcef8504af3e9e9847a6c8b394a647f827da","0c8399c61fae1329d3c7608d4dc6e8f2d6dd2525","dcbb138286c1a1e9a49e332a9ed578d0720fc3ee","72ca06aa9d350fd728dd4f009fcd954c1dd74f99","acc65c51818d9e3fc851d0ad10232a71ef3f19d4","6e5e0205022c6e752d8f17f038e8bb8307d456f4","ac18099f9953d49439cc298d54dec9c182eea869"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Genetics of lipoprotein disorders.","doi":"10.1016/S0889-8529(05)70024-4","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/S0889-8529%2805%2970024-4","venue":"Endocrinology and metabolism clinics of North America"}

Study end points were between-group differences in change from baseline of log10-transformed HIV-1 RNA and in rates of viral load decline measured by the slope of HIV-1 RNA over time. At baseline, mean HIV-1 RNA was similar in the once/day and twice/day groups (4.33 and 4.40 log10 copies/ml, respectively). At day 14, a trend toward lower mean reduction in HIV-1 RNA from baseline was observed in the once/day group (-0.585, 95% confidence interval [CI] -0.728 to -0.442 log10 copies/ml) compared with the twice/day group (-0.849, 95% CI -1.067 to -0.630 log10 copies/ml, p=0.056). Viral load reduction also tended to be slower in the once/day group, as indicated by the smaller slope of viral load decline in the once/day group than in the twice/day group during days 1-14 (-0.045 vs -0.065 logic copies/ml/day, p=0.065).

Driving cycles are required for the estimation of fuel consumption and exhaust emissions from vehicles for emission testing and certification, with many cities having unique cycles for different types of vehicles and roads. However, no driving cycle has been developed for passenger cars and motorcycles in Chennai, India. Thus, the aim of the present study was to develop representative driving cycles for passenger cars and motorcycles which reflect the real-world driving conditions in Chennai, India. On-board diagnostic (OBD) reader and Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers were used to collect second-by-second vehicle speed from a representative set of vehicles for developing the driving cycles. Eleven assessment measures were used in the construction of the driving cycles from the micro-trips. The developed cycles for motorcycles and passenger cars were of 1448 and 1065 s (peak-hour), which were further compared with existing driving cycles. Significant differences were observed between the cycles, thus highlighting the need for city-specific cycles.","inCitations":["ab5bad281c80dc7090c4bf06846bff50edbe4cae","760c34211c44414493bb8df7851fe8a20d681c3d","879008e3bc026390b18b25fa6d3e75e79bbe3e90","6fbd40a35b7eb48c113985a0bc7296ac7224e675","95866cdae006dd1166a618930d800739f7489a33","bf54e2993b0d3f4367fed8c09686a6851c18f78b","3c508f89c6f4a91a9f51498a182f40bb68eb7a67","d26bdcdc91776a3f157d30bb419b22433c6a44f8","71cc1672961d364f4973dd4c08888f2108cc955e","27c882021186d26db577754695a0a0b9d2aa9b84","f1472bcad495f4d961c5362541e9ed805e61c972","44e6bbcc9347d5b93e66e04de81300573c9f6fa6"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Development of driving cycles for passenger cars and motorcycles in Chennai, India","doi":"10.1016/j.scs.2017.05.001","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scs.2017.05.001","venue":""}

Epidemiological studies have demonstrated that statins (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors) are likely to reduce the risk for developing these formidable disorders. The favorable outcomes in statin users may be attributable to not only cholesterol-dependent actions, but also various cholesterol-independent actions called \"pleiotropic effects.\" Several clinical trials have suggested that statins decrease the incidence of stroke, especially ischemic stroke. Statins improve endothelial function, inhibit platelet activation, reduce blood coagulability, and suppress inflammatory reactions, all of which may contribute to the beneficial effects of the therapy. Statins also reduce the risk of vasospasm caused by subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). In addition, statins might inhibit the development and progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD), the dominant type of dementia in most industrialized countries, upstream of the amyloid cascade. In vitro studies have shown that statins modulate the metabolism of the beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP) and reduce the extracellular level of its proteolytic product, amyloid-beta (Abeta). The aggregated Abeta is cytotoxic, leading to formation of neurofibrillary tangles and neuronal loss in the brain. Inflammatory processes are active in AD and may contribute significantly to AD pathology. We review the experimental background regarding the pleiotropic effects of statins and summarize clinical trials that examined the preventative effects of statin therapy on stroke and dementia. We include current trials in which statin therapy is initiated within 24 hr of onset of acute ischemic stroke.","inCitations":["d0ae76855f94cb857b11718724a885c987d0e182","dac883d908b32ebe7ec59fd5967af128419d7011","d04eb21271ee15f00923b7cf1c634ad517af3596","8ec28db3cd5f236da23d0e0051716469fe2cea11","282b97522b188d45bd13467d891d9e88e85b55fb","31ee449e4a95df1aab8018ed1b0e62ee056a01bd","097ad845783bf04397b1a354ef68c43172486e54","f5f6cb44dbed10cb161a7a8acc4784ae4e521a6c","50ce59af602ea175ca6e18fbf356e335b7221703","a635b7b1ddbde8b501d3c82c04a6f3e333d974bf","45d1448fd9050cde4a18ec3b8dc79e3af77959ad","580cae8d4822965c304bae3eff77ed1a95fce742","65c55b08d07434a1e5b778f495f1924ed08c2f17","458955bf5dd745c45a59cbe2b79662b20a4426f1","f999a787607c5afda65ef508e55dd5406f13ae89","6b5a66f29499a2a1cebe2a97032dca35a045e36a","dab88e7cc91e60812e81c595507c913f3ae01c71","5b74539c2be67ff73276f3579b7c81a5099a28f7","f7b4b77968a98424d93151689b05f56e8fb472d0","3a374254cb5bc518e795da01cf517cc86ed527bb","9acf21f29870bd42c0176e7f7980c39025a6eb3e","49d105b63917070f121f3ac9036138803a0bf847","0dfa285c8cb497a068d428596f88e8c07b075d4a","2e2461c49da2e71a8acee625d409f1de230f7e0d","dd013d974b1796241d06fa96969712ed1f9dce75","9b6bf5961e25e5e4158d5a25c5adbbc5ab2229b0","e1c4a796f840fe59d25f1e6b07f874c7101e927d","bde31d845153555438c20fb88d7e6de786c254c8","2ce496bffe27bc3c5717d76c789d853cb90b4ef5","4ab332db0fe4eb1b32dfccff62939903615dc657","a87aec664bec8ce85fee21945025a9a99b73778e","e12e048fccb2a76d8295c0ae3ab9e3ce6b8f1071","223a350ee281e37e8b63de3c5f84c2e002c9811a","2ef576530d90b4b80567e1af1e318a60b58c3d45","aafa020b11594cf8f3b757453104f2fad9eb08e5","35df06552b741b0376463e416c838b8e70f5029f","bce7c30aceabe1ee0aa4bb6859314450d600ea3e","874648a787ac5db64252dde0a7c818445fdc04fe","efe4816d24d4efb0d7d67859c96fb946c5f6ed85"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Prevention of stroke and dementia by statin therapy: experimental and clinical evidence of their pleiotropic effects.","doi":"10.1016/j.pharmthera.2006.09.003","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pharmthera.2006.09.003","venue":"Pharmacology & therapeutics"}

A narrower definition, which focuses on the notion of a ‘primary carer’ who ‘provides the most [ongoing] informal assistance, in terms of help or supervision, to a person with one or more disabilities’ (ABS, 2004, p. 77), still generates a count of approximately 474,600 carers, about one in every five carers (ABS, 2004, p. 50). The majority of these primary carers live with the main recipient of their care. Such local carers are rightfully given close attention in today’s policymaking. However, they are not the only ones involved in caregiving. There are other, translocal and transnational carers, who either provide help and support from a distance within the same country, or give care across national borders. These translocal and transnational carers have remained largely invisible in policymaking.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Implications for Policy","doi":"10.1057/9780230626263_7","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1057/9780230626263_7","venue":""}

The degree of this decrease is proportional to the severity of LVI and upset of the pulmonary circulation. The more persistent and considerable effect correcting decreased capacity and extensibility of the peripheral veins and enhancing the perfusion of tissues with isolated LVI is exerted by furosemide, nitroglycerine is somewhat less effective.

Probing depth (PD), gingival recession (GR), and attachment loss (AL) were recorded to obtain the periodontal status of each tooth, using a Michigan probe \"0\" with Williams marking. Glycemic control was evaluated by glycated Hb value. Using ANOVA and independent sample t-test, mean probing depth and attachment loss in each tooth type (incisors, canines, premolars and molars) were compared.\n\n\nRESULTS\nMean age of diabetic subjects was 58.86 ± 6.21 years and that of control group was 56.92 ± 6.91 years; 60% were females. Probing depth was greater in patients with poorly controlled diabetes compared to well controlled diabetic patients and non-diabetic controls (4.21 mm vs. 3.72 mm and 2.93 mm respectively, p < 0.001). Attachment loss also increased in poorly controlled diabetes (p < 0.001) compared to the control group and well controlled diabetes, however, the difference was not statistically significant when comparing well controlled to the control group (p > 0.05). Number of sites and mean percentage of sites with attachment loss of ³ 4 and ³ 6 mm was also significantly higher in poorly controlled diabetes compared to the control group (p < 0.05 and p < 0.001 respectively).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nPeriodontal status as estimated by probing depth and degree of attachment loss deteriorates significantly with poor glycemic control in diabetes.","inCitations":["b5e7afacdb5071d2f9eeafe5c5ad8842fa6c2c32","f5b747638ac7302d07e6ec50f7bc065ab56365d8","8420c77ce7b0d4fa966650824249acebb15743f5","08fd6f6ee402e20cc4f5ac674ad068b13ccb0ce7","82a5cabaf00d09497aa516f55a3be63b3469a096","c8b11c0873ec7070cb660521b0d9a037030c8473","4b04742bd8ba5a2805773a0852339708b37b0750","73f71f8ad6fda2e73e6d8e0a7d4cfefdc35e5752","713d441e8119079049b2a6b53614bff86f2d3718","406c2d6f714f322bc6ea92f7fb49eb50b4b9b965","82d3f51cadf38fc70dbe14b038e965ca9369f4f7","48e81f35bb54887684e0fae75c2987b7756aa7cd","97b9afb50aaa632095f256181c92a91b2f2bd6f6"],"pdfUrls":["https://www.jcpsp.pk/archive/2012/Aug2012/09.pdf"],"title":"Periodontal disease in type 2 diabetes mellitus.","doi":"","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"Journal of the College of Physicians and Surgeons--Pakistan : JCPSP"}

We aim to determine a possible correlation between AGT A-20C (rs5050) gene polymorphism and gastro-duodenal ulcer in patients taking low-dose aspirin, adjusted for clinical and histological characteristics. Results. We enrolled 211 patients stratified according to AGT A-20C genotype: 122 AA, 83 AC and 6 CC patients. There were no significant differences regarding demographical and clinical parameters, except for the frequency of ulcers (4%, 8.4% respective 50%, p=0.03), endoscopic bleeding signs (12.3%, 14.5% respective 50%, p=0.0001) and the frequency of gastritis in biopsy (63.9%, 54.2% respective 16.7%, p=0.03) in genotype groups. When we compared ulcer and non-ulcer group, variant homozygous CC genotype carried an increased risk for ulcer (OR:9.66, 95% CI: 1.46-63.7, p=0.04) than AA group, as well as variant C allele compared with normal A allele (OR: 2.12, 95% CI: 1.07-4.63, p=0.04). On multivariate analysis, variant homozygous CC genotype AGT A-20C showed an OR: 12.32 (95% CI:1.40 -108.13, p=0.02) for ulcer, while H. pylori infection (OR:2.40, 95% CI:1.18 -6.54, p=0.04) and concurrent use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (OR:1.31, 95% CI:1.07 2.27, p=0.05) remained predictors for ulcer in aspirin consumers. Conclusions. Variant C allele and variant homozygous CC genotype AGT A-20C, infection with H. pylori and NSAIDs co-treatment are risk factors for gastro-duodenal ulcer in low-dose aspirin consumers. The variant homozygous CC genotype AGT A-20C patients treated with LDA are more prone to have reactive gastropathy and bleeding ulcers in a population with a high prevalence of H. pylori infection.","inCitations":["89bc94f5b0927445a3fbc8b3d98ff58a3e9998dd"],"pdfUrls":["https://content.sciendo.com/downloadpdf/journals/rrlm/23/2/article-p179.pdf"],"title":"AGT A-20 C ( rs 5050 ) gene polymorphism and ulcer occurrence in patients treated with low-dose aspirin : a case-control study","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Based on a comparison of the results of dilatometric measurements of the irradiated samples and the samples in the initial state, the energies of vacancy migration in the steels are calculated. It is found that the energy of vacancy migration is 1.08 ± 0.02 eV in the ChS68 steel and 0.98 ± 0.02 eV in the EK164 steel. Using these values, the steady-state vacancy concentrations during irradiation of these steels in the BN-600 reactor are calculated. It is shown that the steady-state vacancy concentration in the EK164 fuel cladding portions irradiated in the lower half of the core is significantly lower than that in the ChS68 cladding. This is a cause of the higher resistance of the former steel to radiation-induced swelling as compared to that of the ChS68 steel upon irradiation in fast neutron breeders.","inCitations":["1a799bd832bf64bcb1296cba309c88464be5b347","3d44fe9a2194bd17664692305b6dc547ed531c8e","5b99e830dd909ba536fe638b19743ed0e55adc27","7ede610be09aefb7554073a1e4ce2dc041b6381b","5bb8a71fed1326a6f5bdc57874e2af039dde9906"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Energy of vacancy migration in 0.06C-16Cr-15Ni-2Mo-2Mn-Ti-Si-V-B and 0.07C-16Cr-19Ni-2Mo-2Mn-Ti-Si-V-P-B cladding steels","doi":"10.1134/S003602951405005X","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1134/S003602951405005X","venue":"Russian Metallurgy (Metally)"}

This book demonstrates how developers working with small- to mid-sized companies can take advantage of Amazon Web Services (AWS) such as the Simple Storage Service (S3), Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), Simple Queue Service (SQS), Flexible Payments Service (FPS), and SimpleDB to build web-scale business applications. With AWS, Amazon offers a new paradigm for IT infrastructure: use what you need, as you need it, and pay as you go. \"Programming Web Services\" explains how you can access Amazon's open APIs to store and run applications, rather than spend precious time and resources building your own.With this book, you'll learn all the technical details you need to: store and retrieve any amount of data using application servers, unlimited data storage, and bandwidth with the Amazon S3 service; buy computing time using Amazon EC2's interface to requisition machines, load them with an application environment, manage access permissions, and run your image using as many or few systems as needed; use Amazon's web-scale messaging infrastructure to store messages as they travel between computers with Amazon SQS; leverage the Amazon FPS service to structure payment instructions and allow the movement of money between any two entities, humans or computers; and, create and store multiple data sets, query your data easily, and return the results using Amazon SimpleDB. Scale up or down at a moment's notice, using these services to employ as much time and space as you need.
