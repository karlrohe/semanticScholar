Drug-lipid bilayer interactions include processes such as drug adsorption, distribution and accumulation in cell membranes and inside cells, and thus are important for their therapeutic or toxic effects [2]. The partition coefficients (Kp) between PC unilamellar vesicles of size 100 nm and a buffer (pH = 7.4) for newly-synthesized phenothiazines were determined using the second derivatives of ultraviolet absorption spectra. The absorption spectra of all the investigated phenothiazine derivatives in the presence of PC vesicles showed a bathochromic shift, induced by an increase in the concentration in the vesicles. The relatively high background signal appearing in these spectra, derived from light scattering caused by liposome suspension was entirely eliminated in the second derivative absorption spectra [3]. After the elimination procedure, all the second derivative of phenothiazine spectra clearly showed two isosbestic points, indicating that these compounds exist in two distinct states free and bound to the lipid vesicles [4]. The derivative intensity change (∆D) of each compound was measured at λmax for each absorption spectrum, and the Kp values were calculated from the relationship between ∆D and the PC concentration. The Kp values for all the phenothiazine derivatives are around of 10 and increased about 1.7-fold when the alkyl phenothiazine chain was lengthened by one CH2 group. Substituting CF3 for H at position 2 of the phenothiazine ring results in an about 3.5-fold increase in the Kp values.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://www.cmbl.org.pl/pdf/Vol6_p421-422.pdf"],"title":"Second Derivative Spectrophotometric Determination of the Partition Coefficients of Newly-synthesized Phenothiazines between the Phosphatidylcholine Phase and Water","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

The gist of AdaBoost is based on the assumption that even though a weak learner cannot do good for all classifications, each of them is good at some subsets of the given data with certain bias, so that by assembling many weak learner together, the overall accuracy is expected to be higher. Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a popular machine learning technique for solving classification and regression problems. In this project, LIBSVM tools of SVMs was used to solve classification problems. The AdaBoost.M1 algorithm utilized SVMs as component learners and the new algorithm was proved to boost the accuracy of unbalanced datasets sharply. In the best case, AdaBoost.M1 with SVM algorithm achieved accuracy improvement of 10%. However, AdaBoost was not always useful for performance boosting. In the worst case of the vowel dataset, the performance of AdaBoost.M1 with SVM was slightly worse than the grid search method. By exploring various aspects of AdaBoost.M1 with SVM algorithm, I found that the gamma update settings had an important impact on the accuracy. It effected the number of component learners as well as the generalization of each learner. Ideally, proper number of weak learners would fit in unbalanced training data very well.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~czhang24/projects/cs528_Project4_Zhang.pdf"],"title":"AdaBoost and Support Vector Machines for Unbalanced Data Sets","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

This retrospective study describes the use of Thymoglobulin (Imtix, SangStat, Lyon, France) in pediatric cardiac transplantation over a 13-year period in a single center that adjusted the dose of Thymoglobulin according to platelet count monitoring and examines the short-term hematological effects as well as longer-term outcomes.\n\n\nMETHODS\nData for all children who received a heart transplant at the Hôpital Cardiologique at Lyon from 1984 to 2001 and who were given Thymoglobulin as part of their immunosuppressive protocol were extracted. The dose of Thymoglobulin given depended on baseline platelet count and was 2, 1.5, or 1 mg/kg per day over 5 days for the following platelet count groups: greater than 150,000/mm (normal group), 100 to 150,000/mm (mild thrombocytopenia group), and 50 to 100,000/mm (moderate thrombocytopenia group).\n\n\nRESULTS\nThirty children of median age 14.2 years were given a median cumulative dose of Thymoglobulin of 8 mg/kg per patient; the moderate thrombocytopenia subgroup was given significantly less (6.4 mg/kg) ( P=0.032). Immediate tolerability of Thymoglobulin was good, with no cases of first-dose syndrome, anaphylaxis, or serum sickness. The platelet count decreased at the start of therapy, but recovered after discontinuation, and did not give rise to clinical concern. Patients were followed up for a median of 6.3 years (7 days-15.5 years); actuarial survival was 90%, 86%, and 74.5%, respectively, at 1, 5, and 10 years. In the first year, 50% of patients suffered an episode of rejection. The overall incidence of infection in the month following transplantation was 40%. One lymphoma occurred at 5 months.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe use of Thymoglobulin in pediatric heart-transplant patients as part of an immunosuppressive protocol, with dose adjustment according to platelet levels, has been shown to be effective in terms of rejection rate and patient survival and safe in terms of the incidence of infections and malignancy.","inCitations":["679a41fd320695c14503359a20112cb9e6717ca3","c305229c5b1c471768358668f820d70d5b9014ba","6804c1140fbd91fad28aa7cb705e2478eccd63ba","8c204b9f0e61ee3f6d903c631f778e7f78f504b4","7eff2d3d5b83d93aaf5e5c14e9d4a2f4e8b5f3eb","67d56da05ea36005775c44ed2dea70aba0029934","326a7376f025d2ee2f67dd9c9d46a7984509bf3f","a6da34dd56cad11bcb9907a899dd53fdd64ef259","667b8e4f43b50ed6701dc5610a266109c8797f29","96425b10ef14713cf857501138db70090214cae1","7a6ced0bd3da8cf90f28957bcd162d19edddbf3b","b52f5882ac911a5de8d6441d6ccf6357dc57741e","13a58bee0e3015b1212d3a4f6a27167d2750d63f","1ce3b31ff86eb212706a3ba6309ba2a042c65ebc","4deb3f277e3233fba4783ad13013f8e4fee8ca5e","24eebe4473863c156d53b2cbf9d01d5fe1bf8331","80ceca9491bd5791231a0a4fec7205b1825fae6f","e761e802b852096f0cd4d0b025e6797ddafcaf13","ff023c34148983e131cdb9fd5e0a41098d07d6b5","ef75214f0461ce2f5af75af148f428893706b3aa"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Rabbit antithymocyte globulin as induction immunotherapy in pediatric heart transplantation.","doi":"10.1097/01.TP.0000045223.66828.FA","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1097/01.TP.0000045223.66828.FA","venue":"Transplantation"}

Prosedur pengadaan jasa konsultan pada proyek milik pemerintah mengacu pada Keputusan Presiden Nomor 80 Tahun 2003. Agar penerapannya lebih operasional, maka digunakan Peraturan Menteri Pekerjaan Umum Nomor 43 Tahun 2007 tentang standar dan pedoman jasa konsultansi pada proyek konstruksi. Akan tetapi, proses pemilihan konsultan konstruksi masih menemui banyak kendala dalam penerapannya. Hal ini umumnya dikarenakan cara evaluasi yang kurang lengkap sehingga menyebabkan subyektifitas panitia pengadaan dalam memberikan penilaian terhadap dokumen penawaran konsultan yang terdiri dari dokumen administrasi, teknis dan biaya. Penelitian ini bertujuan untuk mengevaluasi dan mengembangkan metode pemilihan konsultan pengawas proyek konstruksi milik pemerintah pada tahap evaluasi dokumen penawaran. Penilaian mengacu pada pedoman eksisting dari Kementrian Pekerjaan Umum. Evaluasi dilakukan untuk mendapatkan kriteria penilaian yang tepat, bobot teknis serta cara penilaian dokumen penawaran. Kriteria penilaian diperoleh melalui survey deskriptif, bobot teknis diperoleh melalui metode perbandingan berpasangan, sedangkan cara penilaian diperoleh melalui expert judgement. Dari hasil evaluasi tersebut dikembangkan suatu model pemilihan. Hasil penelitian menunjukkan proses penilaian masing-masing dokumen. Dokumen administrasi dievaluasi berdasarkan kelengkapan kriteria administrasinya. Dokumen teknis dinilai dengan memberikan angka terhadap 3 (tiga) kriteria teknis. Tiap kriteria memiliki subkriteria penilaian dengan bobot masing-masing sebagai berikut : pertama, kriteria pengalaman perusahaan (12%) meliputi pengalaman proyek sejenis (51%), reputasi (26%), kapasitas (23%). Kedua, kriteria pendekatan dan metodologi (38%) meliputi pemahaman Kerangka Acuan Kerja (44%), kualitas metodologi (29%), rencana kerja (17%) dan presentasi proposal (10%). Ketiga, kriteria kualifikasi tenaga ahli (50%) meliputi tingkat pendidikan (9%), spesialisasi (44%), pengalaman kerja profesional (15%), seminar (6%), pemahaman ilmu konstruksi (16%) dan penguasaan aspek legal dan administrasi proyek (10%). Dokumen biaya dinilai berdasarkan total penawaran biaya. Berdasarkan hasil implementasi, ternyata peringkat konsultan dalam penentuan pemenang seleksi yang diperoleh berdasarkan pengembangan model ini sama dengan hasil penilaian panitia dengan acuan pedoman eksisting. Adapun penilaian tersebut menghasilkan peringkat konsultan pemenang yang dimulai dari nilai tertinggi adalah konsultan JS, GS dan AA.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Pengembangan Model Pemilihan Konsultan Pada Proyek Konstruksi Milik Pemerintah","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Traditional environmental multimedia models (EMMs) are usually based on one-dimensional and first-order assumptions, which may cause numerical errors in the simulation results. In this study, a new user-friendly fuzzy-set enhanced environmental multimedia modeling system (FEEMMS) is developed, and includes four key modules: an air dispersion module, a polluting source module, an unsaturated zone module, and a groundwater module. Many improvements over previous EMMs have been achieved through dynamically quantifying the intermedia mass flux; incorporating fuzzy-set approach into environmental multimedia modeling system (EMMS); and designing a user-friendly graphic user interface (GUI). The developed FEEMMS can be a useful tool in estimating the time-varying and spatial-varying chemical concentrations in air, soil, and groundwater; characterizing the potential risk to human health presented by contaminants released from a contaminated site; and quantifying the uncertainties associated with modeling systems and subsequently providing robustness and flexibility for the remediation-related decision making.","inCitations":["0a30c5dbde282233bc109bdb0631de6f9227f8bb"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"An enhanced environmental multimedia modeling system based on fuzzy-set approach: I. theoretical framework and model development","doi":"10.1007/s11783-013-0609-x","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11783-013-0609-x","venue":"Frontiers of Environmental Science & Engineering"}

In particular, single event upsets (SEUs) and soft errors produced by single energetic particles may have a significant impact on the error rate of digital ICs. Additionally, some of the mechanisms responsible for long-term degradation of ICs under normal operating conditions are related to degradation mechanisms produced by ionizing radiation. This paper reviews issues related to prediction of error rates in ICs and discusses the roles of hydrogen in bias-temperature instability and total-ionizingdose radiation sensitivity.","inCitations":["22b76d0f89bf0c34cc79ffb0911587855612987d","0ed38e538236b4598549237bb2d697edcb64dc33","7548ee769384e1ab639c607eec4b1d144bc301e5","c5dd26132333c388cac3940578df2d1994bc2ca7","d3466e8e161c2074027f8a6633960d7445bc3897","f0c5280be563768c49aff98c1dda016251adae22","9dc1eb04d84187651558a5f545ca4837768426af","db8ef3ba5317108a40d50b07a67758443d3e3007","57ecb838ba926fd7890bddf27a44aeb0d0d6b279","8c958abecc1fc6ce3d02efe0087686001872d5f1","0c1912578555aab7d78f5e14bde0d220311df3c5","0103d55353f2552841d27fb09a54fcef22c6b8a8","ac468d5cc6ccf26045f4a4f25ba354fcc6eae9c9","2df69bbd91875daa2a6559f48599686fb920b0ef","ea84780ce17255fd1017856b994a4536c3a6e543","e8c41dbd8ee8e1db64c61275db09d678464273a1","e071a1e7fe1f8fba49bb7702e940facaa816ce24","5fc548476bb0782693ad17183d9a4a68451a2b8c","472232129a61e1ec98d0806ae377cf78195dc97c","fdf4792a3424fc8f7138f904cedf3e6a9e8529a3","a119fd69e3e6c67170379a3d21d351ba59996d8a","9c09e7c859bd8b31ec21f2da0c8aa198353d40e9","f7a691e20f75b81d926586f9d1315ae8da0682ac","3fca7deb46f09e5aaa1ccbc2e1bd3081598907be"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Reliability and radiation effects in IC technologies","doi":"10.1109/RELPHY.2008.4558869","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RELPHY.2008.4558869","venue":"2008 IEEE International Reliability Physics Symposium"}

Thus, the LDso of the preparations tested were increased by 80 to 100 per cent when optimal amounts of the earth alkali ions were added. Beside this reduction of the systemic toxicity of metrizoate sodium (Isopaque Na) by ionized calcium and magnesium, a reduction in selective toxicity could also be demonstrated. Thus, as described in the preceding paper, the cerebral toxicity of metrizoate sodium (Isopaque Na) was considerably reduced by the addition of calcium and magnesium ions in the blood-brain barrier test of BROMAN & OLSSON (1956), as modified by STEINWALL (1958). Apart from this effect on the brain we have also been interested in investigating the actions of these media on the cardiovascular system, which, among other things, involve determinations of the action on the heart.

The oral administration of secretory antibodies, especially surface immunoglobulin (SIg)A, which is perfectly adapted to the mucosal environment, would therefore, be preferable. The aim of the present study was to obtain a SIgA preparation from pooled human colostrum and milk, which should maintain the essential properties of the antibodies suitable for clinical oral administration. IgA preparations were obtained from colostrum and milk pools by salt precipitation. The final products were evaluated in terms of yield and purity, as well as antibody activity to bacterial antigens and toxins and inhibitory activity of bacterial adhesion to epithelial cells. The best yield and purity were achieved when the colostrum pool was used as a source of IgA; the final product showed very few bands of protein contamination. The IgA preparations preserved the antibody reactivity against various microbial antigens, well comparable with the reactivity exhibited by the original milk and colostrum pools. SIgA preparations were able to inhibit greatly the adhesion of enteropathogenic Escherichia coli to Hep-2 cells and the invasion of enteroinvasive E. coli. These promising results show the feasibility of obtaining SIgA suitable for oral use, which may in future be administered to immunodeficient patients with gastrointestinal manifestations, from human colostrum and milk.","inCitations":["d5e89f22b8878eafbad0560990638b4f9988e878","cf2cd384552835aab518939e507e9ff31e506062","0eb8cc6f72b81ae4607e49c0210f3fad0fb9df3f","5f162d20d906f236fcf91f8383095eb5b0b54090","17c487e10a475aa86109d993a5a01c1a151f61e0","eef530f9e6b97783f367c6024ac7862ddca3afbc"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Secretory immunoglobulin A obtained from pooled human colostrum and milk for oral passive immunization.","doi":"10.1111/j.1399-3038.2005.00332.x","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1399-3038.2005.00332.x","venue":"Pediatric allergy and immunology : official publication of the European Society of Pediatric Allergy and Immunology"}

The rates of water absorption of both hybrids in the presence of 0.25% SO 2 aqueous solution were evaluated in terms of the diffusion coefficient. Drying temperature affected negatively the rate of absorption of both hybrids. A laboratory wet-milling procedure was developed to evaluate starch recovery of corn samples. For flint corn starch recovery drop from 96.5% (undried) to 82% (dried at 110 °C); for dent corn the drop was from 97.5% to 90%. The starch isolated from air-dried corn contained greater amounts of protein than starch originated from undried corn.

An experimental optical TDMA interconnect is reported that uses a 100-MHz repetition rate, mode-locked laser with external modulators to generate the base-band data, and operates at a multiplexed data rate of 5 Gbits/s accommodating up to 50 channels. System measurements reveal bit error rates of less than 10 -9 , low channel crosstalk, and subnanosecond multiaccess capability.

However, our research indicates that there is no direct causality between refugee youth unemployment and extremism, and that unemployment is just one of many factors that can lead to extremism.1 Opportunities for meaningful employment for young refugees are certainly limited. In Lebanon, for example, only about half of Syrian refugees are economically active, and only one third have access to employment, which is overwhelmingly in informal and low-skilled positions.2 However, the mobility and employment challenges faced by refugee youth mirror the challenges faced by the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) population in general, and MENA youth in particular. In Lebanon, for example, unemployment has increased to approximately 20%, while youth unemployment is estimated at 34%, with similar numbers in Jordan.3 And in both countries female unemployment is estimated to be at least double men’s unemployment. In situations of overall unemployment, groups with less leverage and less social capital (such as refugee youth) tend to be affected to an even greater degree. In our focus groups, however, participants felt that refugee youth were most susceptible when a number of factors – including but not limited to unemployment – interacted, giving rise to a sense of isolation or exclusion, such as that resulting from relative deprivation, social marginalisation or political exclusion. According to our participants, the element of political exclusion in particular tends to be overlooked by both states and international organisations in efforts to prevent extremism. Again, political exclusion is not limited to refugees but includes MENA youth and even citizens more broadly, though refugees felt greater political marginalisation. Elements of political exclusion most cited by participants included: state corruption; youth programmes that solely privilege the urban and wealthy; policing policies that treat most youth and/or refugees as threats; and lack of space for political dissent. These policies contribute to overall disillusionment with state institutions and can push youth to explore other paths of inclusion or validation.","inCitations":["1476dd7515a7bd15b81e2000b886daeedc9d5dab","a915c17a6c020b21183723ef17721c2c31c97f56"],"pdfUrls":["https://pure.qub.ac.uk/portal/files/152215882/syria2018.pdf","https://www.fmreview.org/sites/fmr/files/FMRdownloads/en/syria2018/mikhael-norman.pdf"],"title":"Refugee youth, unemployment and extremism: countering the myth","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Networks","paperAbstract":"Abstract Forgetting in the recall-based elicitation of personal and social networks poses a potentially significant problem for the collection of complete network data and unbiased measurement of network characteristics and properties. A comprehensive review of the literature shows that forgetting is a pervasive, non-trivial phenomenon in the recall-based elicitation of personal and social networks pertaining to a broad variety of social relations. There appear to be no good predictors of individuals' proportional level of forgetting, although the number of persons an individual recalls is moderately positively correlated with the number of persons he or she forgets. People seem to be more likely to forget weak ties than strong ties, but the evidence is mixed on this point. In any event, people still forget a significant proportion of their close contacts. Non-specific prompting for additional relevant persons, multiple elicitation questions, and re-interviewing enhance recall slightly to moderately and are the only methods currently available to counteract forgetting, albeit only

Furthermore, it is the most regulated sector in Peru, so it faces, more than ever, pressure from regulators as well as stakeholders. Given this situation, several mining related companies decided to comply with the ISO 14001 standard. In this study one presents findings from ISO 14001 environmental audits performed to 11 mining related companies (4 mining companies and 7 mining subcontractors dedicated to blasting, exploration and extraction). One finds several deviations related to operational controls that lead to negative environmental impacts. Unfortunately, the most common response to these deviations was the adoption of end-of-pipe technologies instead of cleaner production techniques. Hence, one also suggests some cleaner production techniques that could be adopted in order to cope with these deviations.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://repositorio.up.edu.pe/bitstream/handle/11354/317/DD0707.pdf?isAllowed=y&sequence=1"],"title":"DOCUMENTO DE DISCUSIÓN DD / 07 / 07 Cleaner Production Techniques in the Peruvian Mining Sector Based on ISO 14001 Audits","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Then, the obtained SMIPs were characterized by several techniques including Fourier transmission infrared spectrometry (FT-IR), scanning electron microscope (SEM), transmission electron microscope (TEM), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and elemental analysis. The results demonstrated that the obtained elliptical-shaped molecular imprinting polymer was coated with thickness imprinting layer. Then, SMIPs were used as sorbents to selective removal of 2,4-dichlorophenol (2,4-DCP) from aqueous solutions. Batch mode of binding experiments was carried out to determine the equilibrium isotherm, kinetics, regeneration and selectivity recognition of SMIPs. The results indicated that the selective adsorption behaviors of SMIPs were well described by the Langmuir isotherm model and the pseudo-second-order kinetics model. The SMIPs exhibited outstanding specific recognition capacity for 2,4-DCP (29.25 mg g −1 at 298 K). SMIPs also possessed excellent selective recognition for 2,4-DCP in the presence of other competitive compounds (such as 2,4,6-TCP, 3-CP and 2,6-DCP). Finally, the SMIPs were successfully adopted to the selective adsorption of 2,4-DCP from the environmental samples.","inCitations":["3ba56c18c19d44b46c7d194bbfc0cd6dea0d70c5","f80ef413911aa73c58ed72335d98499be04c6e72"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Selective removal of 2,4-dichlorophenol in aqueous solutions by nanoparticles modified yeast using miniemulsion imprinting polymerization","doi":"10.1016/j.jece.2015.03.029","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jece.2015.03.029","venue":""}

A field experiment using five application rates and a control was conducted in winter wheat plots. The aim was to determine application rates that allowed for determination of negative as well as positive effects of physical factors on arthropod toxicity using pitfall traps. Several physical variables were measured in the crop canopy and deltamethrin deposition was determined at ground level. The use of Before-After-Control-Impact design (BACI) time series analysis for characterization of instantaneous pesticide effects and velocity of recovery, relative to the application rate sprayed was evaluated.An initial reduction in spider catches ranging from 58% to 85% percent for sprayed concentrations of 0.25 to 4 g active ingredient per hectare (ai ha−1) was observed, followed by exponential recovery with a half-life time of 2.8 days for all treatments. The effects observed in this study were relatively mild compared to other field-experiments. It was concluded that an application rate near 0.25 g ai ha−1 deltamethrin (i.e., one twentieth of the recommended rate) would be sufficient to study the relationship between physical factors and the effects of deltamethrin. BACI time series analysis was shown to be a useful technique for characterizing short-term pesticide effects.","inCitations":["cb508e516dda6de078a568b4249d0e7f7bbdbdf6","911f88cfe605f9637e66df1d72b5dcb6013496e2","d143696d97658aaf92cf5984db77f5b0e8b745b5","fbac8a56427141f4ff40ac58cb00f037ea157624"],"pdfUrls":["https://page-one.springer.com/pdf/preview/10.1007/BF00213309"],"title":"A dose-effect relationship for the effect of deltamethrin on a linyphiid spider population in winter wheat","doi":"10.1007/BF00213309","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/BF00213309","venue":"Archives of environmental contamination and toxicology"}

Antioxidant and polyphenol contents of these cereals and malts were investigated. Secondary, technological parameters of prepared malts were evaluated and compared with malt from barley Laudis 550 used as reference material. Malting of selected cereals had an impact on antioxidant and polyphenol content and allowed a better extraction of these compounds from cereal matrix, except of barley malt, whose antioxidant and total polyphenol content remained comparable. For other cereal malts, antioxidant contents were 2.0, 1.8, 2.6, 2.9 and 3.2-fold higher and total polyphenol content were 1.8, 1.9, 1.9, 3.1 and 3.4-fold higher than in wheat (PS Sunanka, Zaira, PS 57/11, Vanda) and oat (Dunajec), respectively.

Not only have Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) economies, such as the US and the UK, tried to bring manufacturing back to their home countries but non-OECD economies, such as China and India, have also increased their shares of domestic products at both intermediate and final goods. In this paper, we employ the annual global multi-regional input–output tables compiled by the Asian Development Bank to explore the linkage of the recent slowdown in globalization and global CO2 emissions for the period 2012–2016. Our results suggest that there are indeed some clues indicating a slowdown of globalization in several leading OECD and non-OECD economies. However, the changes of consumption in non-OECD economies are much larger than are those in OECD economies. At the aggregate level, the effects of globalization on emissions have been dominated by non-OECD economies (in particular China and India), showing a negative linkage.

Faktor-faktor yang mempengaruhinya antara lain adalah kondisi geologis, curah hujan dan penggunaan lahan. Di wilayah ini banyak ditemui lapisan tanah residu yang cukup tebal akibat dari proses pelapukan batuan dasar yang sangat intensif yang pada umumnya tersebar pada satuan morfologi pegunungan. Pada musim penghujan kekuatan (strength) lapisan tanah residu ini berkurang sehingga akan mengurangi kekuatan gesernya. Akibatnya lereng-lereng yang ditempati oleh lapisan tanah residu ini menjadi rentan untuk bergerak kebawah atau longsor. Banyaknya rekahan atau kekar-kekar yang terdapat di badan lereng akan menambah kritis lereng tersebut untuk bergerak. Gerakan tanah yang terjadi di P. Jawa khususnya di Kabupaten Kebumen telah banyak menyebabkan banyak jatuhnya korban serta kerugian-kerugian. Gerakan tanah yang akan terjadi pada suatu lereng dapat diprediksi sebelumnya dengan mempelajari karakteristik lingkungan dan fisik lereng tersebut serta faktor-faktor yang mempengaruhinya. Sehingga dapat disusun suatu strategi mitigasi yang dapat meminimalkan jatuhnya korban. Studi yang dilakukan ini berlokasi di Dusunn Sambeng, Desa Seling, Kabupaten Kebumen, bertujuan untuk mempelajari sifat-sifat gerakan tanah rayapan yang terjadi di lokasi ini. Dalam studi ini telah dilakukan beberapa kegiatan yaitu studi-studi yang mempelajari faktor-faktor yang mempengaruhi gerakan tanah rayapan, studi-studi yang mempelajari mekanisme dan proses gerakan tanah tersebut dan kemudian dilanjutkan dengan studi yang mempelajari metode mitigasi yang sesuai. Hasil dari studi memperlihatkan jenis gerakan tanah rayapan di Desa Seling ini terjadi pada lapisan tanah residu dengan bidang gelincir batulempung karbonatan, yang dipicu oleh curah hujan yang tinggi sehingga menaikkan tegangan air pori pada bidang gelincir. Gerakan tanah ini berupa rayapan tanah (creeping) yang terjadi pada lereng yang relatif landai. Ditinjau dari prosesnya gerakan tanah ini dapat dikatagorikan sebagai long term stability. Longsoran yang terjadi bersifat translasi dengan kedalaman bidang longsoran 1: 9 m. Untuk mengatasinya antara lain lereng sebaiknya ditanami tanaman yang memperkuat lereng seperti tanaman yang berakar tunggang.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Aspek Lingkungan Kebumian Dalam Penyusunan Tataruang Daerah Jawa Bagian Selatan; Karakterisasi Bencana Gerakan Tanah Rayapan Di Dusun Sambeng, Desa Seling, Kec.

Cell preparations from 5 benign breast lesions, 5 potentially weakly malignant and 4 potentially highly malignant invasive ductal breast carcinomas were examined by 2-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) gels. Qualitative and quantitative differences were recorded by computerized analysis. Analysis of samples from different areas of the same tumor showed a high degree of similarity in the pattern of polypeptide expression. Analysis of 2 tumors and their metastases revealed similar 2-DE profiles. In contrast, variations between different lesions with comparable histological characteristics were considerable. Greater differences in polypeptide expression were observed between potentially highly malignant carcinomas compared with comparisons of less malignant lesions. Our results show that malignant human breast carcinomas may be highly heterogeneous in their patterns of gene expression.","inCitations":["a99d1aee888688ddb466f01b60f44d359bf1db0b","fdbd47c26f09956ffb6dae3fa021855c911b21da","827e3464ef1c7e28604812b98ab85bfa61ec0e3d","6c8893966f3779200a923fc7e4d249813c0bf491","e276a8d6accd28c7df7268f87b70e8b8b3deebf6","da29d76390f1ec1d9fa50d221eb931db5f936a28","aae35e0897020e18e09019d4fb2e65efe762df42","2c31cbdb7f10229e7a352dad9195ac6468cfad8b","ce64203c05ffb08ce491d9196910b82b55a2ca8a","b02270a39b12309ebd071f57e65a55a51dab1317"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Assessment of homogeneity in polypeptide expression in breast carcinomas shows widely variable expression in highly malignant tumors.","doi":"10.1002/(SICI)1097-0215(19961021)69:5<408::AID-IJC10>3.0.CO;2-Z","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1002/%28SICI%291097-0215%2819961021%2969%3A5%3C408%3A%3AAID-IJC10%3E3.0.CO%3B2-Z","venue":"International journal of cancer"}

In the northern Baltic Sea, the non-indigenous Gammarus tigrinus is a recent invader of littoral ecosystems and now occupies comparable ecological niches as the indigenous G. zaddachi. In laboratory experiments on specimens collected between June and August 2009 around Tvärminne in southern Finland (59°50′N/23°15′E), the tolerances towards heat stress and hypoxia were determined for the two species using lethal time, LT50, as response variable. The brood size of the two species was also studied and some observations were made on maturation of juveniles. Gammarus tigrinus was more resistant to hypoxia and survived at higher temperatures than G. zaddachi. Brood size was also greater in G. tigrinus than in G. zaddachi and G. tigrinus matured at a smaller size and earlier than G. zaddachi. Hence, there are clear competitive advantages for the non-indigenous G. tigrinus compared to the indigenous G. zaddachi, and these may be further strengthened through ongoing environmental changes related to increased eutrophication and a warming climate in the Baltic Sea region.","inCitations":["9e0eaf1a2db0ef28dff8f7c8d4f42c52d6561926","5e501cf2a7fd3e2671b4057e478ac27e88ab7332","d4cf89d319ac37d9521d0c39d57f230f46626644","8bc12e0a60215dc2b0dfdf2cec5431ed549113c5","522587755f82591eb85f0ed8aeed298463291b71","76e0df222507c9b96a9f6b13e71185b749084ce0","cff3d4f435b1d679b233744781c414388d4b2841","8cca77c0a570880643596940a5f2d8a63e84da78","e4fc28fd188de6fc3493fcc33358357f51bf64b3","1d54a9872992a88e9402d0684a580d28def9ae57","46d0a14e4e55dd43bc7c92fc1965283b96fe7a92"],"pdfUrls":["https://www.novia.fi/assets/Aronia/Aktuellt-2011/Sareyka-et-al.-2011-MABI.pdf","http://oceanrep.geomar.de/11875/1/Sareyka_et_al._2011_MABI.pdf","https://www.novia.fi/assets/Aronia/Publikationer/20-Sareyka-et-al.-2011-Marine-Biology.pdf"],"title":"Differences in stress tolerance and brood size between a non-indigenous and an indigenous gammarid in the northern Baltic Sea","doi":"10.1007/s00227-011-1708-5","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00227-011-1708-5","venue":""}

Therefore, these renewable fuels can be used predominantly in compression ignition (CI) engines for transportation purposes and power generation applications. Today, the use of biomass-derived producer gas is more relevant for addressing rural power generation and is also a promising technique for controlling both NOx and soot emission levels. Although a producer gas–biodiesel-operated dual-fuel diesel engine exhibits lower performance, they are independent from the use of fossil fuels. The lower performance of the engine could be due to the slow-burning and lower calorific value of producer gas. For this purpose, exhaustive experiments on the use of Honge oil methyl ester (HOME)–producer gas in a dual-fuel CI engine were carried out for the improvement of its fuel efficiency. This paper presents the effect of the compression ratio (CR) on the performance, combustion and exhaust emission characteristics of a single-cylinder, four-stroke, direct injection stationary diesel engine operated using HOME and producer gas in a dual-fuel mode. The results indicated that the HOME–producer gas combination exhibited lower brake thermal efficiency (BTE) with comparable emission levels with the diesel–producer gas combination at different CRs. Comparative measures of BTE, peak pressure, pressure–crank angle variation, heat release rate, smoke opacity, and hydrocarbon (HC), carbon monoxide (CO) and nitric oxide (NOx) emission levels are presented and analysed.","inCitations":["9e40015bccb6486babd68bee3e7e987b10793d52","0d5ed0b594a054c3e39762b5bafb278269d4b6d8","33946864a52b03c0f430aad33812bab93378d75a","98e4fcba9817d1cd9e4f700583fec2772fb01db8"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Honge oil methyl ester and producer gas-fuelled dual-fuel engine operated with varying compression ratios","doi":"10.1080/19397038.2013.837108","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1080/19397038.2013.837108","venue":""}

Mean particle size of dry matter varied considerably among broiler litter sources. Differences among litter sources in particle sizes at which larger and smaller size fractions each contained 50% of crude protein and neutral detergent fiber did not coincide well with mean particle size of dry matter. Only in dry matter retained on sieves with smallest apertures (i.e. less than 0.15 mm) did concentrations of chemical constituents differ considerably from concentrations in unsieved litter. However, only minimal dry matter was retained on sieves with the smallest apertures, suggesting little potential to enhance feeding value of broiler litter for ruminants by a simple separation into one small and one large fraction if constituting a similar proportion of total dry matter.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Chemical constituents in different particle size fractions of deep-stacked broiler litter","doi":"10.1016/0960-8524(96)00055-7","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/0960-8524%2896%2900055-7","venue":""}
