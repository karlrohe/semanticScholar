Inhibition of stimulated prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) formation with indomethacin results in a significant improvement of clinical symptoms and is therefore standard therapy. Using the COX-2 selective inhibitor rofecoxib, we investigated the role of COX-2 in the pathophysiology of HPS/aBS.\n\n\nMETHODS\nSix clinically well-characterized patients with HPS/aBS (3 girls) were enrolled into the study. Four patients had mutations in the renal potassium channel ROMK, one patient in the furosemide-sensitive cotransporter NKCC2, whereas in one patient no molecular abnormality could be detected. Median age was 15.8 years (range: 9.1 to 19.0 years). Patients were evaluated on indomethacin treatment, 3 days after indomethacin withdrawal, and after 4 days of treatment with rofecoxib. Therapeutic drug monitoring was performed.\n\n\nRESULTS\nCOX-2-selectivity of rofecoxib was confirmed in vivo and ex vivo. Both indomethacin and rofecoxib ameliorated clinical symptoms, the typical laboratory findings, and significantly suppressed PGE2 and PGE-M excretion to normal values while it was elevated under withdrawal conditions. Rofecoxib suppressed hyperreninemia to a similar extent as indomethacin.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nIn patients with HPS/aBS, excessive PGE2 synthesis and hyperreninemia is dependent on COX-2 activity. This observation proves the stimulatory role of COX-2 on renin-secretion in salt-depletion in humans. Clinical long-term efficacy and potential side effects of rofecoxib need to be evaluated in a larger cohort of HPS/aBS-patients.","inCitations":["8ac3c8c0b01b61e02f8757c990fa95493a5c51c2","e3d308461d9fb339accfef1fef8732132359f584","c3e0167cf984ab10b5fb9961324c1ace606a7e3b","8b9ff80f3abfa07f772d82cebbdbb65088981639","6b307aa3a30992ec4b87c04e145fbec39ade8d76","a0e4e3ca7eb739144cc34855c96c5eb43630e961","ec859a493c4705c653bf8b4bdc4c7d6440f25f69","afc020f334c233b7281d9533a3108639bf7d9bcf","a023aef9b699acdad0e21cef399eef12dd41ceac","73cdb9266bab3b9c973a4dfe240f4a4975386d65","572d04d1bedcbeb0de9b98b51690285e5f9e51c9","0fa315fe56a61934fc62a4154111770ab2e7d574","337ba8d5ff3d5fdb80e1ebe050ccbadb3d88bc00","4716ba89f809534021105245a58a0ee4c6cfd6db","0d02a2bc3de3c2c93b1ff64e29fd01109c4da59d","4240c2e2e17fa406bc0004f0f66c706e1139d640","c8be2494535254cd30a28eb08a0ee39bdfdfeeeb","7f467279cd8d5f8c090a924c2a3067f982dcac53","2edada5262382594a03a93841f3f218089441216","ce27e63c1bcdd11d26efa7a82c3af7c868c4cb50","f0d6ebc80f1b486b8dd50b69111c9880efb77b59","3f0672b5e71f268da433a927164031a0436dc9cb","a1fcdbbf65331cf7ffaedaad3772dfb1de3d8337","f0ebcfb6fb2a2cbbe021127e4a6cfd847b8892d9","8e5537007a1597174938dd18fd3707cb907e22e8","3ccfcbedf2a0acfc06cc1a05e0a249600e77fede","dd7e40beff7948d825ead5e9eac1750792a913cf","08662c496c42ba02a4de5e6163ee115ee8430ec7","7923ba83bc0790a8e63325debd8b17d859ac8e14","0a887687926c9a0bbb8fa85d6d389716aa8b2b69","fff0c40e37e1a751cbdbb21e139ba16ee96a7bc1","dec20f5bd5545ea8f81a3f8b4de8c63f3bb47c52","0f72947306e8ad4d1e5391d64b712ec200034366","4ad271368c11feaa7e05a6ab8bf32984c7c6cd00","0fe209191281ec63a9c1fcf613bae68c449d66ea","919da87782e54177406cb723dc16320198cee59f","9b2cacb2780ddcc8b2d596e0879905d39e6096c5","795a2fd9bf9588dc9b8f5026e81199b8583de708","50b6210fb5893da3a03b9ea5f0bf8c1cd519cde8","d3a814707f92e28a14649151e02ea6d71e482c8b","a21afc3164875668d987b5985734d04649659595","d11775f12495270e5ce49b5231fa8c8bc682e9f7","2efce598b6263e4da15529d54e772ddef06a90fd","85345c3fde08d12d13abc11e117c3cec16a18bfa","f9a203ca6a302dc7007b101bab8606010dfd69c3","68ca49d1c40889513dc59f9571a12bc072097128","295ec2961b16a5d00867d7330e852d4b3fbccabb","22cadb2dd2f14020f549bfd8a9c44160a3353284"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Role of cyclooxygenase-2 in hyperprostaglandin E syndrome/antenatal Bartter syndrome.","doi":"10.1046/j.1523-1755.2002.00435.x","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1523-1755.2002.00435.x","venue":"Kidney international"}

The local anesthetic lidocaine has been shown to be protective against myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury, although its mechanism of action remains unresolved. We hypothesized that administration of exogenous adenosine during reperfusion would limit the size of the infarct that results from a period of ischemia and reperfusion only when the animals are treated with lidocaine. Male, mongrel dogs (13.0-20.0 kg) were anesthetized (30 mg/kg i.v. sodium pentobarbital), and a left thoracotomy was performed. The left circumflex coronary artery (LCx) was isolated and instrumented with an electromagnetic flow probe, a 25-gauge nonobstructing intracoronary catheter, and a critical stenosis. The dogs were allocated randomly to one of four groups: 1) control, n = 13, (saline), 2) adenosine, n = 13, (0.15 mg/kg/ml/min i.c. for the first hour of reperfusion), 3) lidocaine, n = 9, (2.0 mg/kg i.v. given immediately before coronary artery occlusion and just before reperfusion), or 4) adenosine plus lidocaine, n = 11. The LCx was occluded for 90 minutes and reperfused for 6 hours. Regional myocardial blood flow (RMBF) was determined (n = 6 per group) at 80 minutes of occlusion and at 45 minutes of reperfusion with radiolabeled microspheres. RMBF determinations revealed an increase in blood flow to the inner two thirds of the myocardium at 45 minutes of reperfusion only in the presence of the combined treatment. Adenosine treatment alone or lidocaine treatment alone did not affect RMBF. Quantification of infarct size (triphenyltetrazolium method) expressed as a percent of the area at risk revealed a significant limitation of infarct size only in the group treated with both adenosine and lidocaine: control, 47.8 +/- 6.6%; adenosine, 45.0 +/- 3.2%; lidocaine, 46.9 +/- 6.0%; and adenosine and lidocaine, 20.8 +/- 5.6%. Statistical analyses were performed with two-way analysis of variance to account for the two individual drug treatments. The findings show that intracoronary administration of exogenous adenosine, at the dose used, is only effective at limiting myocardial infarct size when administered to lidocaine-treated animals.","inCitations":["c79f1464b3002ec62e99ea60655127780701974e","d7026908d4a692b874efa73c58883bb9f8d6a5fd","2405996c25a0d1d1501ff7c73389439f4472e70e","fbf8c12c0f0608f5d43f335c64485e31c4dd7367","0008e56218276c0b2094369ff07527f33fe1c633","23515fc9376c200ed4715ec7b877ebff4e1fe905","73bb6989ec6e192fa2933aa35472d79a94e0e0ed","8bcc85cfbfa47daa75fe8e03d2468f86a5ac5e62","00fe0483b63eb61c6073a32b6dfad060a733ff99","6f0b4079790a3281e00330a96b523abd7a39c070","98db70c791c5d67dbd1c93be09235d6a56e1bc65","2314291cfceecb2a8fe11ab6978fe7562992a8de","9ecd14a9d0281227c60964ca141cc106f04a09eb","2a553f1ed2ba989e26f40741568689a2473cfb41","7b3424278b1a48d013db97362778064b18e94b74","70fb1de18d2c57d7622dd2e1af0c53e6cdedf987","20f75b3aaf7139f9f9f317368621c727d19f0d12","98dc054b0ac62cf204b94de7203c60bb5f016c24"],"pdfUrls":["http://circ.ahajournals.org/content/circulationaha/82/2/595.full.pdf"],"title":"Combined adenosine and lidocaine administration limits myocardial reperfusion injury.","doi":"10.1161/01.CIR.82.2.595","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1161/01.CIR.82.2.595","venue":"Circulation"}

Beta and p120 are homologous subfamilies based on sequence and structural comparisons, and are members of the armadillo repeat protein superfamily. Alpha does not appear to be homologous to either beta or p120 based on the lack of sequence and structural similarity, and the alpha subfamily belongs to the vinculin superfamily. Catenins link the transmembrane protein cadherin to the cytoskeleton and thus function in cell-cell adhesion. To date, only the beta subfamily has been evolutionarily analyzed and experimentally studied for its functions in signaling pathways, development and human diseases such as cancer. We present a detailed evolutionary study of the whole catenin family to provide a better understanding of how this family has evolved in metazoans, and by extension, the evolution of cell-cell adhesion.ResultsAll three catenin subfamilies have been detected in metazoans used in the present study by searching public databases and applying species-specific BLAST searches. Two monophyletic clades are formed between beta and p120 subfamilies using Bayesian phylogenetic inference. Phylogenetic analyses also reveal an array of duplication events throughout metazoan history. Furthermore, numerous annotation issues for the catenin family have been detected by our computational analyses.ConclusionsDelta2/ARVCF catenin in the p120 subfamily, beta catenin in the beta subfamily, and alpha2 catenin in the alpha subfamily are present in all metazoans analyzed. This implies that the last common ancestor of metazoans had these three catenin subfamilies. However, not all members within each subfamily were detected in all metazoan species. Each subfamily has undergone duplications at different levels (species-specific, subphylum-specific or phylum-specific) and to different extents (in the case of the number of homologs). Extensive annotation problems have been resolved in each of the three catenin subfamilies. This resolution provides a more coherent description of catenin evolution.","inCitations":["8f5fa1d46e0946660966f21261b6126a84ac2028","c0d0de72af81b14169252d2e886aa1a10376d2ec","8c7c6286892408d108b82c4ed5f4796a6961700e","d55ef17cd3601c3441f0f54785b04961538cb436","d99176e43cad2349449504dc89c545cdfd595051","5282b9b83de17ee331782040193709b8e8b4a862","0ec1422439926b5fa3947324664780e08557b348","8714a4fff9bc81884cae7ba8fdba9e8d89b50985","4eb51f7833ca2ce0607ad243440e073a7fdea0e6","57ac5ffaf90a934545537f805277a8766837a6a9","d1b4277f10cb22006a9b111855e641ab336cef24","887a251331315fb41f8314a92d32afaf1a4db3b2","2f23ff01e26ab44d2a8278091ece10a1a4295d53","361a3a082bcb7119b64148861e02e1fda41de9a7","baa37955929354ab7af1ff6d26469cfb4e58707f","e4539debe67fdeee0f395b3ac15ef85dd119d7ac","22d2944116ead33aae4ecf0bab45ceae70d2e92b","f6322c201ba9356aa09af7931778ff49d5e55261","ff5647b097696cbafafcc07400604e9db625e0da","3892e27d809d1dadfc4be227758f290d14dabd48","cf1ab992381da00d418eccb745c630db2e728dcf","5558a1d2f760776b87a30a35cab9eb4d11318a46","77fadd0e3499d7989b736fd6e09ae586daeb60eb","4117dc59334d8ba9a6b004c009ebbba638884727","7879388d59b4c2934b5dac59f3c95205e0ee2195","b49a7db8144cc5181e21e4870c0c3d0bc702eff9","6a79b04ffcb31707145d3ff4ae292d515cf3405c","d4a7bb67517fd23c108809669800f6df42915be6","e115d0566aafbf6836fabd1514b88075eef718b8","a8157141d1a7a2957086096c7929a96851cd20de","9ea5192018524f76868364c3e7a6ca69aaed27cd","04d88745f9dd3bc9113391d8ad122cf3e84236f8"],"pdfUrls":["ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/pmc/40/ba/BMC_Evol_Biol_2011_Jul_8_11_198.tar.gz","http://www.gauchergroup.biology.gatech.edu/papers/Zhao_The%20evolutionary%20history%20of%20the%20catenin%20gene%20family%20during%20metazoan%20evolution%20(BMC%20Evol%20Biol%202011).pdf"],"title":"The evolutionary history of the catenin gene family during metazoan evolution","doi":"10.1186/1471-2148-11-198","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2148-11-198","venue":"BMC Evolutionary Biology"}

As CsA does not readily cross the blood-brain barrier, the variability may be due to differences in bioavailability of CsA to the ischemic brain. We have, therefore, quantitated CsA levels in blood and brain following intra-carotid injection in rats undergoing permanent right middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion using a three-vessel model of focal cerebral ischemia. After 30 min of three-vessel occlusion, CsA (10 mg/kg) was injected into the left external carotid artery followed by reversal of the left common carotid artery occlusion. At various times post-injection, blood samples were collected from the vena cava and samples of ischemic or sham-operated cortex were obtained for CsA quantitation by tandem mass spectrometry. Pharmacokinetic parameters were determined using non-linear mixed-effects modeling. CsA areas under the curve between normal and stroke-induced rats were not significantly different in blood (18355 vs. 19405 ng x h/ml, NS) or in brain tissue (15664 vs. 14931 ng x h/g, NS). These results demonstrate that intra-carotid injection of CsA results in high levels in brain (brain-blood ratio from 0.5 to 1). No significant differences in blood and brain exposure were observed between normal and stroke-induced rats. Therefore, reduced cerebral blood flow in the ischemic territory did not limit CsA availability to the cortex. In addition, CsA intra-carotid administration was neuroprotective following 24 h recovery as there was a significant decrease in the infarct area of the affected hemisphere compared to saline injected rats as estimated by TTC staining of viable tissue.","inCitations":["6906773ca918a5eb0752e92895d772bc38aa00bd","29bf6b653e282bd8fbabac322154820f87d7f89e","84cb8b89288dc80781396788099aaafdf96f63a3","bdfad260707981577a721cf202f7b792cb928b45","07545c5eb18a25c734a0da03356a649bd2ae1b6a","8b84b3e5418f93dcfd8443c9d17431c0f5267d61","5a67229abe06267e36f93e58742cd4a6042e553e","dc28b3de50848034c521a5378db5e7b51950500d","2c214deecea1efa849c4208e2bdb640ffa68f3e4","a805c2f6e689bb6bd46c06113dd05f30c07f0b26"],"pdfUrls":["https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0006899302024137","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006899302024137?dgcid=api_sd_search-api-endpoint"],"title":"Cyclosporin A in blood and brain tissue following intra-carotid injections in normal and stroke-induced rats","doi":"10.1016/S0006-8993(02)02413-7","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/S0006-8993%2802%2902413-7","venue":"Brain Research"}

In order to preserve the nature of the successful computational techniques currently applied to light molecules in so far as possible, particularly to allow for the treatment of correlation effects in an efficient CI procedure on an equal footing with relativistic effects, emphasis is placed on the development of a two-component formalism for this purpose. A first attempt in this direction consists of formulating a spin-free quantum mechanical operator that reflects relativistic kinematics. The mass-velocity term in the Breit-Pauli Hamiltonian is not appropriate for a variational treatment, however, since it drastically alters the spectrum and gives results that are not bounded from below. To avoid this problem the relativistic free particle energy has been used directly for the representation of the kinetic energy, and in addition the Darwin term has been included as a correction to the potential energy. This approach can be justified with reference to the Foldy–Wouthuysen reduction of the Dirac equation, but the class of basis functions used in a variational procedure with this Hamiltonian must be restricted to avoid the formation of a node in the wavefunction at the nucleus; the same problem is circumvented in the Cowan–Griffin method by imposing Dirac boundary conditions on the wavefunction. With this method, accurate spin-orbit splittings have been computed for Br, I, Xe+, CBr, and XeF, but the resulting total energies are found to be overly sensitive to the representation of the inner shells of these systems. Improved results for both valence and inner shells are then shown to follow from the use of the no-pair equation, which provides a variationally tractable two-component method employing a momentum dependent potential that gives a realistic description of relativistic effects for atoms and molecules over a suitably large range of Z.","inCitations":["753089e7a4ebdfa5cf58b7c6d99f9df517390d45"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Toward the variational treatment of spin-orbit and other relativistic effects for heavy atoms and molecules","doi":"10.1002/qua.560290414","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1002/qua.560290414","venue":""}

It is therefore essential to find effective strategies to slow or prevent the progression of insulin resistance. Many intervention studies have shown that early intervention to improve insulin resistance successfully prevents progression to type 2 diabetes (T2D) (Crandall et al., Nat Clin Pract Endocrinol Metab 4:382–393, 2008). The composition of the diet is undoubtedly very important. While our understanding of the effects of fat and carbohydrates on glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity has greatly increased over the past decades, the role of proteins and the mechanisms behind their effects are less well characterized. However, studies aiming to demystify their potential effects have shown promising results.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Beneficial Impact of Cod Protein, l -Arginine, and Other Amino Acids on Insulin Sensitivity","doi":"10.1007/978-3-319-26009-9_34","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-26009-9_34","venue":""}

Woody knots of varying sizes were prevalent throughout the root crown of the tree up to the bud-union, and were strikingly similar to those caused by Sphaeropsis knot on Rough lemon. At the Botany Department of the University of the West Indies, isolation experiments yielded cultures of the fungus Sphaeropsis tumefaciens Hedges from knots cut off the Rough lemon rootstock. Subsequent inoculation experiments (with isolates obtained from woody knots) re sulted in knot formation on most of the inocu lated branches of Rough lemon, West Indies lime, and Ortanique (a natural cross of tanBLAZQUEZ AND HUNT: SPHAEROPSIS KNOT 47 gerine x orange). The disease was observed in a few dying trees of a small Valencia grove in Hose Hall, Linstead, in St. Catherine, and in in Lennox Estates, in Portland, where it was estimated to have killed 40% of the four-yearold Valencia trees. Control of the disease was obtained by burning all diseased trees. Introduction During a survey of citrus diseases in Jamaica (1) a rootstock disease was observed in two different areas, at Lennox Estates in Portland, and at Rose Hall, Linstead, in St. Catherine. At Rose Hall, the disease was discovered on four-year-old Valencia trees budded on Rough lemon rootstock. Abundant knot formation was observed on some trees at the base of the rootstock, while in others it was well distributed throughout the entire surface of the Rough lemon stock. No knots were observed above the bud union and none were found on the top of the Valencia scion (Figures 1, 2). Trees that had a few knots at the base of the rootstock had been maintained two years normally and had produced a fair crop. Preliminary observa tions of these trees indicated that the stock was dying, so in an attempt to save the Valencia scion, Rough lemon seedlings were brought by the grower and planted close to the Rough lemon rootstock for inarching. Small knots were ob served on some of the seedlings, and within nine months a few of the seedlings began to die. These results influenced the grower to abandon inarching and to merely maintain the diseased trees until they were no longer profitable. These trees had been purchased from two nurseries of the Ministry of Agriculture and Lands (MAL), one at Caenwood, Portland, and the other at Lyssons in St. Thomas. Other Valencia trees purchased from another MAL nursery at","inCitations":["4aeaa2369a98e27a815ccd0bc0c097d4e67fc1d5"],"pdfUrls":["http://journals.fcla.edu/fshs/article/download/100254/96222"],"title":"Sphaeropsis Knot, a Disease of Rough Lemon Rootstock","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

The aim of this study was to test the psychometric properties of the original Adolescent Health Concern Inventory (AHCI) for use with an Iranian population.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThis was a methodological study in which 50 adolescents with age range of 14-18 years were selected using convenience sampling. The translation and cultural adaptation process of The AHCI followed recognized and established guidelines. The face and content validity was established by analyzing feedback solicited from teenagers and professionals with expertise in health, sociology and psychology. Reliability was examined using test-retest and Cronbach's alpha for internal consistency reliability. Kappa and McNemar tests were used to examine test-retest reliability for each item.\n\n\nRESULTS\nMinor cultural differences were identified and resolved during the translation process and determining the validity of the checklist. Results from Kappa and McNemar tests indicate a high degree of test-retest reliability. Internal consistency reliability as measured by Cronbach's alpha for the subscales were between 0.68 and 0.87 with total instrument reliability of 0.96 indicating considerable overall reliability.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe Persian version of the AHCI appears valid and reliable. Hence, it can be used for filling a gap in identifying the adolescents' health concerns in the research and community settings and school health education programs in Iran to design appropriate interventions.","inCitations":["0542e8b67262fd0ad68aef75ef1e36b5235d6570","eedf5e5f4476effb501cb9487a6ca862a227ca88","38a822617b6bc4789180a4ed15a5a8920c631e9e","4f20f993aa3cf35538c89479172e02059bd231b8","2e2820007ebf8b95db1798f33178c93d0507c5a8","fb4646700924786844ded09048d2a0aab969fd5e","36f8e91f6bdd6f7e73605e4a78a7abd5f5901c82","e7d39fa4076ab48b320eaaaf5f9f90761e084951","58bfc1e7ff3f4b036abab221028aa27403f70dd9","4af02b6032ed633608660ba0c9a4a186179ade9f","13ad176ea49f98edd7c66ac65b977917e3cf6131","9f3b1334e9a8c24570feba996bf4065281a9c040"],"pdfUrls":["http://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/pmc/63/a5/IJPS-8-28.PMC3655227.pdf","https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/pmc/oa_pdf/63/a5/IJPS-8-28.PMC3655227.pdf"],"title":"Psychometric Properties of the Adolescent Health Concern Inventory: The Persian Version","doi":"","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"Iranian journal of psychiatry"}

Treatment failure may be due to an unrecognized ingested foreign body that migrated from the gastrointestinal tract. There has recently been a marked increase in the number of reported cases of this condition, but initial misdiagnosis as cryptogenic liver abscess still occurs in the majority of cases. We conducted the current study to characterize this entity and provide a diagnostic strategy applicable worldwide. To this end, data were collected from our case and from a systematic review that identified 59 well-described cases. Another systematic review identified series of cryptogenic-and Asian Klebsiella-liver abscess; these data were pooled and compared with the data from the cases of migrated foreign body liver abscess. The review points out the low diagnostic accuracy of history taking, modern imaging, and even surgical exploration. A fistula found through imaging procedures or endoscopy warrants surgical exploration. Findings suggestive of foreign body migration are symptoms of gastrointestinal perforation, computed tomography demonstration of a thickened gastrointestinal wall in continuity with the abscess, and adhesions seen during surgery. Treatment failure, left lobe location, unique location (that is, only 1 abscess location within the liver), and absence of underlying conditions also point to the diagnosis, as shown by comparison with the cryptogenic liver abscess series. This study demonstrates that migrated foreign body liver abscess is a specific entity, increasingly reported. It usually is not cured when unrecognized, and diagnosis is mainly delayed. This study provides what we consider the best available evidence for timely diagnosis with worldwide applicability. Increased awareness is required to treat this underestimated condition effectively, and further studies are needed.

In this study, we investigated the risk factors associated with local recurrence of HCC after single-session RFA with a single electrode insertion. From April 2003 to December 2007, we treated 138 HCC lesions by single-session RFA with a single electrode insertion using the Cool-tip RFA, RTC 2000 and RTC 3000 Systems. Risk factors for the local recurrence of these lesions and complications after RFA were analyzed. The mean size of the 138 lesions was 16.9±5.4 mm in diameter (range 7-33 mm). Local recurrence rates were 6.6 and 22.0% at 1 and 2 years, respectively, during the mean follow-up period of 16.4 months. Univariate analysis showed that tumor diameter (≥20 mm), tumor location, pre-treatment AFP-L3 fraction level and ablation pattern were significant variables. Multivariate analysis of these four variables identified only the tumor diameter as an independent risk factor for local recurrence. Complications occurred in 2.2% of the lesions (3/138). Single-session RFA is an effective treatment for HCC in that it reduces serious complications. This study demonstrated that a tumor size ≥20 mm influenced the local recurrence of single-session RFA with a single electrode insertion.","inCitations":["2604f2dcc3cec93045e11a4a4fd5a5c6843a696e","1c8af4fa07607eb0fe2fe3ed186b2d6110483fb3","74e718d55211f1df371bb61946e120edde6d2d7c","e24e793a98352c9712cc37c1094b7da491b4d330","bebbd9e651294a88634aac809e80fb0e8a43b1f5","9bd3883d91a16a956ddd5c2443e20aa742f4b100","0fc53b0444f6e3174f1e6474d940abc6a10142bc","25e8ad462b4b89277145e61f80cf93382158b5f1"],"pdfUrls":["https://www.spandidos-publications.com/mmr/2/1/89/download"],"title":"Risk factors for the local recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma after single-session percutaneous radiofrequency ablation with a single electrode insertion.","doi":"10.3892/mmr_00000067","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.3892/mmr_00000067","venue":"Molecular medicine reports"}

Although much progress has been made in this area, it remains unclear how PEG coating would affect the selective binding of DNA aptamers and thus influence the overall targeting efficiency. To answer this question, we herein report a systematic investigation of the interactions between PEG and DNA aptamers on the surface of liposomes by using a series of nanoscale liposomal doxorubicin formulations with different DNA aptamer and PEG modifications. We investigated how the spatial size and composition of the spacer molecules affected the targeting ability of the liposome delivery system. We showed that a spacer of appropriate length was critical to overcome the shielding from surrounding PEG molecules in order to achieve the best targeting effect, regardless of the spacer composition. Our findings provide important guidelines for the design of aptamer-based targeted drug delivery systems.","inCitations":["cb341ac4f052d17e4097ec050b20c8afcb1d6039","f7d07e5bd3e0277e1b1330166e21b08969d2fedf","a72553d3c0333886525876be217dab7669a8ca84","c642eeee7affb53b437251d741823656a3df2396","7ff2513561e90c36754fa1be3c91743af9c69d4b","377cb6cf20fe1a00658f315efd61357e6d80e0ad"],"pdfUrls":["http://cheng.matse.illinois.edu/files/2018/09/cbic201600092-sup-0001-misc_information.pdf","http://cheng.matse.illinois.edu/files/2017/01/2016-Xing-Hang-ChemBioChem.pdf"],"title":"The Effects of Spacer Length and Composition on Aptamer-Mediated Cell-Specific Targeting with Nanoscale PEGylated Liposomal Doxorubicin.","doi":"10.1002/cbic.201600092","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1002/cbic.201600092","venue":"Chembiochem : a European journal of chemical biology"}

The novelty of the concept is twofold. A new architecture of light-duty, full-electrical vehicle is proposed. A great effort is devoted to energy management: new power train layout integrated in the chassis; new battery and energy management system; regenerative braking… But if attention is given to energy management for one vehicle, the Furbot concept consists in having a fleet of several vehicles offering a new sustainable and very adaptable (evolvable) urban freight transport system. In this article, we focus on the intelligent on-board unit. It has mainly two functions. First, it offers assistance to the driver: emergency braking, obstacle avoidance, parking assistance, itinerary assistance or adaptive speed control. Second, it proposes automation abilities for the loading/unloading of the payload. Regarding the multi-sensorial perception system, an intelligent human-machine interface is also conceived in order to let the driver choose between the driving modes (fully manual, assisted, automated loading), in order to provide him general information (map, mission, fleet state...) and warn him about safety issues, power caution and vehicle diagnosis.","inCitations":["de4c8b752232d779f9c16262d5d5e48ddbd87fdf"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"On-board intelligence for the Furbot: a new concept for urban freight transport","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Our aim is to understand the influence of the reaction field, i.e., the effect of the dipole on its bath, which is usually neglected in the current treatments. We have faced the problem of the role of this reaction field with the help of computer simulation. We found that the trajectories of the dipole x component exhibit behaviors suggesting that, in some range of the parameters of the system, the model should have a bistable character. Moreover, the average equilibrium value of the dipole along the z axis shows a significant deviation from the ``weak-coupling predictions'' of either classical or quantum statistical mechanics. We have explained all these properties via a renormalization procedure which, in the strong-coupling regime, makes the Hamiltonian of interest very different from the bare Hamiltonian. Among other things, this renormalized Hamiltonian leads to a bimodal distribution for the energy, in excellent agreement with the numerical simulations.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Statistical mechanics of a nonlinear relaxation process: Equilibrium properties.","doi":"10.1103/PhysRevA.43.2624","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevA.43.2624","venue":"Physical review.

Our first main cross-sectional study was carried out in 1980, comprising 3,596 boys and girls aged 3, 6, 9, 12, 15 and 18 years from various parts of Finland. Outstanding features were high serum total and LDL-cholesterol concentrations, and a diet rich in saturated fats (J Viikari, HK Åkerblom, M Uhari, eds. Atherosclerosis precursors in children. Acta Paediatr Scand 1985: Suppl.318:in press). A restudy of the same subjects was done in 1983. 2,891 children and adolescents, aged 6-21 years participated (80.4 %). Anthropometric variables, blood pressure, serum lipids and insulin, dietary, socioeconomic and psychological variables and physical activity were studied as in 1980. Correlations between the individual values (1980 vs. 1983) were rather high for serum total cholesterol (r=0.69), calculated LDL-cholesterol (r=0.73), HDL-cholesterol (r=0.66) and the HDL/total cholesterol ratio (r=0.75), but weaker for serum triglycerides (r=0.47) and insulin (r=0.43). The results serve as a background for the analysis of determinants and mechanisms leading to a rise of the risk factors of CHD to adult levels, and for the planning of primary prevention later on.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Risk Factors of Coronary Heart Disease (chd) in Finnish Children and Adolescents: the First Follow-up Study","doi":"10.1203/00006450-198510000-00081","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1203/00006450-198510000-00081","venue":"Pediatric Research"}

Twenty participants underwent two thermal exposures in an environmental chamber: normothermic (NT) condition (25°C, 1h) and hyperthermic (HT) condition (50°C, 1h). After thermal exposure, they performed a twenty-minute psychomotor vigilance test (PVT) in the scanner. Behavioral analysis revealed progressively increasing subjective fatigue ratings and reaction time as PVT progressed. Moreover, heat stress caused worse performance. Perfusion imaging analyses showed significant resting-state cerebral blood flow (CBF) alterations after heat exposure. Specifically, increased CBF mainly gathered in thalamic-brainstem area while decreased CBF predominantly located in fronto-parietal areas, anterior cingulate cortex, posterior cingulate cortex, and medial frontal cortex. More importantly, diverse CBF distributions and trend of changes between both conditions were observed as the fatigue level progressed during subsequent PVT task. Specifically, higher CBF and enhanced rising trend were presented in superior parietal lobe, precuneus, posterior cingulate cortex and anterior cingulate cortex, while lower CBF or inhibited rising trend was found in dorsolateral frontal cortex, medial frontal cortex, inferior parietal lobe and thalamic-brainstem areas. Furthermore, the decrease of post-heat resting-state CBF in fronto-parietal cortex was correlated with subsequent slower reaction time, suggesting prior disturbed resting-state CBF might be indicator of performance potential and fatigue level in following task. These findings may provide proof for such a view: heat stress has a potential fatigue-enhancing effect when individual is performing highly cognition-demanding attention task.","inCitations":["7b3c742030e927b1312df021363eadccd882c8a4","c92b46a5f89ef893389947ba53b80db5b42f3cbb","a6c2120fedd157b7f5695c43ce72787c6ff1ebca","1db5fc9c46e935d372dea4457b026eca51bee665","77e5dac4c335f05e5d22c0f71856db836ec4261d","670216bcf6d2b19c7cc765447e318be9c4eab940","065af480fc38ab3005d0502a6b36087f0d6def91","670de5919a5ea2f0577db565007299daa5322958","84cff4c78f51faad7fe4ff6fe8ab6a03028839a8","c40ce362111216bec7fbc6f808c7d9c8207c132c","ce5df1aa399972f80f519bd0760a55693d53137c","a6afad8ef9cddaef3e21ae23e4f0c738556b5201","5b7955d0ebdcf582858d4518fd8b15a06021918a","9b24ff80c2176efdc4c1e7b8a0c2713284ded2c6","e7b03b1707ebb8d8028a68c328ad1cc3130ad933","3419ec564950d2dd6433de5b5a34d512d5eb8470","b7c87c7fcc6485ef6972cd87983544a527b4a39e","e659020a29d643eda506e27d7f0ef44b797753e1","ae4809d78634a698df3a8c26c21f398e4a3a786c","7b7b0b02765e41b8c0fbc1971b3ffd64a4a5c325"],"pdfUrls":["https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166432814007724","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166432814007724?dgcid=api_sd_search-api-endpoint"],"title":"Environmental heat stress enhances mental fatigue during sustained attention task performing: Evidence from an ASL perfusion study","doi":"10.1016/j.bbr.2014.11.036","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbr.2014.11.036","venue":"Behavioural Brain Research"}

Auch 2007 verlief erfreulich. Hierbei muss berucksichtigt werden, dass das Wachstum ganz erheblich vom Wirtschaftsbau getragen wurde. Im Wohnungsbau schwachte sich die Baunachfrage 2007 bereits wieder etwas ab. Impulse kamen dagegen weiterhin von anhaltend umfangreichen Bestandsmasnahmen. In der mittel- und langfristigen Sicht werden die hohen Wachstumsraten der letzten beiden Jahre bei Weitem nicht erreicht werden. Dennoch wird die zukunftige Entwicklung einen - wenngleich moderaten - Aufwartstrend aufweisen. Zu diesem Ergebnis kommt das ifo Institut in seiner aktuellen Ausgabe der Bauvorausschatzung Deutschland. Wahrend die Langfristprognosen fur die nachsten zehn Jahre separat fur West- und Ostdeutschland dargestellt werden, erfolgen die Schatzungen fur die mittelfristigen Prognosen auf der Basis von sechs Grosregionen (Bundeslandern). Nach den Berechnungen des ifo Instituts wird die Baunachfrage im Verlauf der nachsten zehn Jahre um durchschnittlich 0,7% p.a. zulegen. Dabei wird der Wohnungsbau, vor allem aufgrund weiterhin hoher Modernisierungsmasnahmen sogar kraftiger steigen als die beiden anderen Bausparten.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Bestandsmaßnahmen prägen die mittel- und langfristige Baunachfrage in Deutschland","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

This often leads to overparametrization after learning and induces redundancy in the information flow paths within the network. This robustness and reliability is at the increased cost of redundant computations. Several methods have been proposed which leverage metrics that quantify the redundancy in each layer. However, layer-wise evaluation in these methods disregards the long-range redundancy which exists across depth on account of the distributed nature of the features learned by the model. In this paper, we propose (i) a mechanism to empirically demonstrate the robustness in performance of a CNN on account of redundancy across its depth, (ii) a method to identify the systemic redundancy in response of a CNN across depth using the understanding of unit impulse response, we subsequently demonstrate use of these methods to interpret redundancy in few networks as example. These techniques provide better insights into the internal dynamics of a CNN","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPRW_2019/html/Explainable_AI/Sathish_Unit_Impulse_Response_as_an_Explainer_of_Redundancy_in_a_CVPRW_2019_paper.html","http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.03986","http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPRW_2019/papers/Explainable%20AI/Sathish_Unit_Impulse_Response_as_an_Explainer_of_Redundancy_in_a_CVPRW_2019_paper.pdf","https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.03986v1.pdf"],"title":"Unit Impulse Response as an Explainer of Redundancy in a Deep Convolutional Neural Network","doi":"","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"CVPR Workshops"}

Thanks to image-based rendering techniques, light field contents can be rendered in real time on common 2D screens, allowing virtual navigation through the captured scenes in an interactive fashion. However, this richer representation of the scene poses the problem of reliable quality assessments for light field contents. In particular, while subjective methodologies that enable interaction have already been proposed, no work has been done on assessing how users interact with light field contents. In this paper, we propose a new framework to subjectively assess the quality of light field contents in an interactive manner and simultaneously track users behaviour. The framework is successfully used to perform subjective assessment of two coding solutions. Moreover, statistical analysis performed on the results shows interesting correlation between subjective scores and average interaction time.","inCitations":["72a8d91b56e696888d00c6c1286d2c75aceb473f","0845528e21cb7609e9dcdc7190c60eff2243c1a6","402e4b2dbe869eea1c9fb367dc70ccc7cebaac00","f3c10b2a260e204ea4b1dcb4d145e9b4ff930d27","a4497e88f7746486faf5ea10373a790fecfde1fe","851acb396aef21580e1411ba588a191cdb4b069b"],"pdfUrls":["https://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/230109/files/main.pdf?version=1"],"title":"A new framework for interactive quality assessment with application to light field coding","doi":"10.1117/12.2275136","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1117/12.2275136","venue":"Optical Engineering + Applications"}

As the leading hospital discharge diagnosis in the United States in patients over the age of 65, it is also associated with substantial economic costs. While the acute symptoms of volume overload frequently precipitate inpatient admission, it is the symptoms of chronic heart failure, including fatigue, exercise intolerance and exertional dyspnea, that impact quality of life. Over the last two decades, research into the enzymatic, histologic and neurohumoral alterations seen with heart failure have revealed that hemodynamic derangements do not necessarily correlate with symptoms. This \"hemodynamic paradox\" is explained by alterations in the skeletal musculature that occur in response to hemodynamic derangements. Importantly, gender specific effects appear to modify both disease pathophysiology and response to therapy. The following review will discuss our current understanding of the systemic effects of heart failure before examining how exercise training and cardiac resynchronization therapy may impact disease course.","inCitations":["b69d3ebe3752c380aaf1f41b43206c889c72db3d","f5d853c42d17cb92d4b8f411f00d19741204f657","49b4fe8991ee4de2f3de865c35270e4fead9b47b","6cfcf5f10d017ac480fc5276f0a477361c8953ba","394f43a3a3344f672ce63050eeead7b071c57381","1f504a90176b054dccaa441e445ade20fa2b0f66","1ef7ac0da4de7346bdbc8a6b9c38ce336fec9b40","17939a6bc0d8fac3d5d25ad97cbb16f07420dd60","f2a97c993bcd7aab2668184f22df655332ae390b","1d14dfa5e018b1631eeee724e08fc53cf3cfb643","2e3b33bd88c0302a9de60dff4f4078e8939b2dcd","1f87aa851de7dedc949b98c77d0a5d6bdd4a3d0e","0d837e9eae430ee7849c5f8ef7bf28220bf9039d","6bc7084ad51f7d8f5c195eddb8e8e19cff0cc604","996a0caa6269638ec2e981f9e802682be2b38513","1df8b4653f6f5240e86c9e56a1875d4130fdfc6a","850bc23c0cb6aa5fe9bc6f1a809326c6246db000","d4fc2d0c2cc7990384c39cdf5a2a1d27a763408d"],"pdfUrls":["ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/pmc/f7/ef/Curr_Cardiol_Rev_2008_May_4(2)_92-100.tar.gz"],"title":"Chronic Heart Failure and Exercise Intolerance: The Hemodynamic Paradox","doi":"10.2174/157340308784245757","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.2174/157340308784245757","venue":"Current cardiology reviews"}

The two predominant isomers of CLA are cis-9,trans-11 CLA (c9t11) and trans-10,cis-12 CLA (t10c12). The present study was performed to study the effect of the individual CLA isomers on DU145 cell growth. The cells were incubated in serum-free medium with different concentrations of the fatty acids. Treatment of cells with t10c12 (at 2.5-10 micromol/L) resulted in a dose-dependent reduction in the numbers of viable cells, whereas c9t11 CLA at a concentration of 5 micromol/L slightly increased viable cell numbers at 3 days (P < .05). DNA flow cytometric analysis revealed that the treatment of DU145 cells with t10c12 for 24 hours induced a small but significant increase in the number of cells in the G1 phase, accompanied by a complementary decrease in cells in the S phase. c9t, however, had no effect on cell cycle progression. To determine the molecular mechanisms underlying t10c12-induced G1 arrest, the levels of cell cycle regulatory proteins were estimated by western blot analyses. t10c12 induced a marked increase in p21(CIP1/WAF1) protein levels in a dose-dependent manner. p27(KIP1) was not affected by t10c12. t10c12 moderately decreased cyclin A and cyclin D1 protein levels (P > .05). However, t10c12 did not affect the expression of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 2, CDK4, or cyclin E. t10c12 increased p21(CIP1/WAF1) bound to CDK2 and attenuated CDK2 activity. These results indicate that t10c12-induced p21(CIP1/WAF1) binds to CDK, and inhibits the activity of this enzyme, which results in the observed decrease in the G1-S progression in DU145 cells.","inCitations":["18c358dc493a857ce75c381a91b30d2ffb35ed75","e10ce42c48a9329ec322fa37783b588841d168c3","96e1c2534c068ba950fad95f239751cb6c543315","241d3a75770f607688e896975068111bfcd0c4ef","f9d8150d220c2b369e47f3a3bebfd21c1cc27f07","0e16817ad9989bdaa405a975bdefa8fa875d6b50","f80c1c82bf34cd3178431d234db74e0b7bd85333","097f93ab6c64cff76cf7fc3180d288a115dba36f","31d5a0575c0bccb3ed14e96abb96165365f19210","0278f43a6ff9c2fdb6d4ff8132dcb968a91e0e45","d1c9fa2d1e333d50a61861321d6f42884df12840","bf8420edbb031092a3782956f35e6394c0854e42","be1acd58b711460ffce54334681b70f9a41bf5e3","415483f1d12239c5dabd4beed1ffabbd5b23b611"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"trans-10,cis-12 conjugated linoleic acid inhibits the G1-S cell cycle progression in DU145 human prostate carcinoma cells.","doi":"10.1089/jmf.2006.9.293","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1089/jmf.2006.9.293","venue":"Journal of medicinal food"}

Adult degenerative scoliosis is a specific type of adult scoliosis that refers to a structural curve that develops after skeletal maturity in a previously normal spine. The pathogenesis of adult degenerative scoliosis has at its foundation the same starting point of degenerative spine disease namely age related desiccation of the intervertebral disc. The crucial pathophysiological concept to appreciate in adult degenerative scoliosis is the asymmetry of disc and facet joint degeneration which leads to progressive coronal imbalance on axial loading. Further abnormalities in the pathophysiology of adult degenerative scoliosis include hypertrophy of the ligamentum flavum, laxity of the interspinous ligament and eventual spinal instability. The clinical course of patients with adult degenerative scoliosis is usually a progressively increasing deformity with worsening axial backache over many years. Superimposed leg pain and eventually gradual leg weakness occurs in the advanced stages of the disease. Conservative measures commonly employed by primary care physicians include out-patient medication, lumbo-sacral and thoraco-lumbo-sacral braces, and physical therapy. Degenerative scoliosis is a however best regarded a surgical disease and the conservative measures should be regarded as palliative in non-surgical candidates secondary to significant medical co-morbidities. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of adult degenerative scoliosis considering the clinical, pathophysiological, and surgical management of this increasingly prevalent problem. The problem is best managed by Neurosurgeons and Orthopedic surgeons in a multi-disciplinary team familiar with the complexity of this disease in a patient specific manner.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Adult degenerative scoliosis – A literature review","doi":"10.1016/j.inat.2019.100661","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.inat.2019.100661","venue":""}

Of the subjects responsible for the infection, four were healthy HBV carriers, three suffered from chronic hepatitis B, and one from acute and one from fulminant hepatitis B. The nucleotide sequences of HBV from both the patients and the implicated sources of infection exhibited perfect identity of the precore region and perfect or high identity of the core region. The completely or nearly identical strain of virus seemed to proliferate successively in the patients following the transmission from the infecting individuals regardless of sequence variations and infectious status. In two cases a peculiar pattern of infection and disease was found: In one married couple the husband, during the incubation period of acute hepatitis B, infected his wife, who developed fulminant hepatitis. In another married couple, both partners ultimately developed fulminant hepatitis (the wife being the source of the infection).","inCitations":["a7bc394a9206666bdfe8bf419e2b71036768ebcb","507926984b411cda1fdb3a9b3c47f29e31664859","94e83b9a688732d41503f9411d990381d4e89cb8","37ef1b2e9eefa7e61800a87b431883aa665cd50c","75c97403d40a554e9e8c9554ad5f23d960bff519"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Completely or nearly identical hepatitis B virus strains replicate between patients with acute or fulminant hepatitis B and their respective infectious sources.","doi":"10.1002/jmv.1890420112","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1002/jmv.1890420112","venue":"Journal of medical virology"}

In this study, the optical light-induced anisotropy of amorphous poly(alkyl methacrylates) doped with an azo compound was measured at different temperatures and at two irradiation wavelengths. To describe a decrease in the efficiency of anisotropy formation with temperature, a model of molecule reorientation is suggested which includes the probability of molecule reorientation per one isomerization as a basic parameter. The probability of molecule reorientation was found to depend on irradiation wavelength. Comparing the anisotropy time profiles at different irradiation wavelengths, we concluded that, upon each photon absorption, the molecule most likely makes an attempt to reorient even without isomerization, i.e., the reorientation occurs by a mechanism predicted by Persico and co-workers in their theoretical works. Also, we infer that the reorientation is facilitated by the photon energy absorbed by a molecule.","inCitations":["75439dbed3f15203883da402798a5ba414b366d8"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Wavelength Dependence of the Reorientation Efficiency of Azo Dyes in Polymer Matrixes.","doi":"10.1021/acs.jpcb.7b03171","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.7b03171","venue":"The journal of physical chemistry.
