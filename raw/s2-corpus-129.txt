The effects of NaOH concentration on the fermentations performance were evaluated. The black liquor after pretreatment was used as substrate for microbial lipid fermentation, while the enzymatic hydrolysates of the bagasse were used for ABE fermentation. The results demonstrated that under the optimized condition, the cellulose and hemicellulose in raw material could be effectively utilized. Approximate 87.7% of the polysaccharides were converted into valuable biobased products (∼175.7g/kg of ABE along with ∼36.6g/kg of lipid). At the same time, almost half of the initial COD (∼48.9%) in the black liquor could be degraded. The environmentally friendly biorefinery process showed promising in maximizing the utilization of biomass for future biofuels production.","inCitations":["d3b5fc6be9c8e0997ca31cb844003618377c3355","cf0742b9ef7e8df107f43d17f10d3ce140cedc48","918cdc6fe36237065f15bd822dad7f4c9cad1db7","1c345c6bdf37350ef41b8fae0803d27644e04665"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Co-generation of microbial lipid and bio-butanol from corn cob bagasse in an environmentally friendly biorefinery process.","doi":"10.1016/j.biortech.2016.05.073","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2016.05.073","venue":"Bioresource technology"}

We analyzed the different activity level of surface electromyography signal, and finally got various fatigue states of muscles in different exercises. Thirty subjects completed exercises of 6 core stability trainings, which were prone bridge, supine bridge, unilateral bridge (divided into two trainings, i.e. the left and right sides alternatively) and bird-dog (divided into two trainings, i.e. the left and right sides alternatively), respectively. Each exercise was held on for 1 minute and 2 minutes were given to relax between two exercises in this test. We measured both left and right sides of the body's muscles, which included erector spina, external oblique, rectus abdominis, rectus femoris, biceps femoris, anterior tibial and gastrocnemius muscles. We adopted the frequency domain characteristic value of the surface electromyography signal, i.e. median frequency slope to analyze the muscle fatigue in this study. In the present paper, the results exhibit different fatigue degrees of the above muscles during the time when they did the core stability rehabilitation exercises. It could be concluded that supine bridge and unilateral bridge can cause more fatigue on erector spina muscle, prone bridge caused Gastrocnemius muscle much fatigue and there were statistical significant differences ( P<0.05) between prone bridge and other five rehabilitation exercises in the degree of rectus abdominis muscle fatigue. There were no statistical significant differences ( P>0.05) between all the left and right sides of the same-named muscles in the median frequency slope during all the exercises of the six core stability trainings, i.e. the degree which the various kinds of rehabilitation exercises effected the left and right side of the same-named muscle had no statistical significant difference ( P>0.05).

The method entails the repeated calculation of two opposing fields—an external potential field U, conjugate to the density field ρ, and an energetic interaction field E. The external field is calculated by numerical inversion of the density functionals and the energetic interaction field is calculated directly by integration over the density field. When the two fields are balanced U=E, we recover the self‐consistent field solutions; when the two fields are off balance, the spatial gradient of E–U is the thermodynamic force which drives the collective diffusion. We introduce a simple local coupling approximation for the Onsager kinetic coefficients of short freely jointed chains in weakly ordered systems.

A new approach to the theory of thermoelectric cooling (Peltier effect) is presented. The Seebeck effect is a fact underlying the conversion of heat energy into electrical power, which pursues same theory. Its physical significances appear by considering the effect of imposing a steady temperature gradient along a finite conductor. Initially the conductor possesses a uniform distribution of charge carriers, but in the presence of a temperature gradient, the free carriers at the hot end will have a greater kinetic energy and tend to diffuse to the cold end. The buildup charge results in a back emf, which opposes a further flow of charge. However, current flow has to be considered for metal- metal, metal-n-type semiconductor, metal-p type semiconductor, p-n junctions. Both degenerate and nondegenerate electron and hole gases are investigated. Then, the role of recombination in the cooling effect should take into the account.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Physics of thermoelectric cooling system, a theory","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

The elements of the modern technology platform Smart Grid are given. An assessment of the peculiarities of the formation of an intelligent platform for the management of energy systems and electric networks for individual energy companies is given. Features of construction of the Distributed Energy Management System (DEMS) are considered in detail. Features of DEMS are analyzed on the example of DEMS by Siemens. The planning and management functions of DEMS are considered. It is shown that DEMS controls provide control and monitoring of the power of all power generators, storage equipment, and flexible demand, as well as the ability to control to maintain a consistent electricity exchange profile. The basic functions of the Distribution Management System (DMS) are presented. The control systems developed by Oracle, ETAP and Schneider Electric have been analyzed as components of the customer-oriented power distribution management platform.

Pneumorrhachis can resolve by itself with conservative management. Case Presentation: A 45-year-old woman suffered from chest pain and shortness of breath after fell at the hotel swimming pool. Further examination revealed rhonchi on left lung auscultation and asymmetry respiratory pattern. Computed tomography of the chest proved the presence of multiple rib fractures 4-9 left side, hemopneumothorax, subcutaneous emphysema. Accidentally, the CT showed intra spinal gas representing pneumorrhachis extending from C6-T3. No neurologic deficit was found. She was treated conservative by supplemental oxygen only, no further neurological deterioration was detected. Follow up examination was uneventful and the symptoms resolved completely. Conclusion: Pneumorrhachis was mostly found accidentally with variety of underlying disease, especially in the case traumatic pneumothorax and fracture of skull base.

At 3 months, the statin group displayed higher HRV SDNN RR): 27.2 +/- 4.9 ms versus 24.4 +/- 2.8 ms in controls, P = .003; rMSSD RR: 24.7 +/- 4.2 ms versus 21.3 +/- 5.6 ms, P = .004, lower QTV SDNN (QT): 5.1 +/- 1.9 ms versus 6.5 +/- 2.1, P = .004; rMSSD (QT): 6.6 +/- 2.8 ms versus 8.8 +/- 3.1 ms, P = .002, and shorter QTc interval 437 +/- 29 ms versus 450 +/- 25 ms, P = .03 than the control group.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAtorvastatin increases HRV, decreases QTV, and shortens QTc interval, and may thereby reduce the risk of arrhythmias in patients with advanced heart failure.","inCitations":["c051ada0e4c0374d39479e6c6a119733ab1d004b","c125cda322015bb15db6790e20850c150394a66b","0a1c5867d8933e4fdfcf37c2be006d5a227aa676","a04acd8609324d1d7a7537e741ee64ab907e393a","f4b24b2225bcb91dae90ed53e4109e9eaf991f46","432e3fe3ee868b04fadceaf7b7f88f59675d271b","269fe1939080104da72a23001eac8cae52f5bfcd","011ab1cbe0555fe7d2aace06947c801692204f69","e2635263045a7f462a2a3a5d03af5fb6160e905c","87a93bbae3771f7447ab89385393119471db43c5","01b8e083e51f72b420b2ee5f5fb2868beab93876","771e5ed9edc9b688b1fe4d6e1935f50fe27dac0f","ca253719bfbd7bd3d4994208cc7e7e527a4c1d25","fe07a3005f279d1df7e9b929cd20712b7469eb90","be792922961ff6569730a4e8d116e5423a494eda","506acd4359e0a3c1df0cebd2010f3b935f1bdbcf","d375c847bab2e5b7bd201a2a2da133605ca70eaf","4b42e773bfb39669b2e2ef0b33e8acad8f70f646","90dff13a0f06f6398e7d4bfd5bb6de431153a59a","213cc12b2e725050d8f47e8ce954558038351643","f5015e90a8951cf0207b2288810858737a94b08e","8e726b55da93e0f14ae2f5d751f0d23104cf14be","59b3aec2b21ccf34a85add97452f8758050833b8","3d4be655be022fbeda549bc1c065a7ff6c35699b","2eeceb14b7729ccc3cdd1dbad47ae1b51779dcc6","fde1b05d0e28f5132bae760a6f6d30cdd2b774d7","b0df0570e3d45fdf5e4660d579a09003be66ff6d","34773fa71b2897b81c4f5fa905ca87cd5c88af3d","1b8bc1dd59aeb63cf515b852f7f7370d2c719341","9dfaadd387c0245b335451edcdbc5f0a3afed189","adfae42855515f63dd7fb870c23cbc64bf93d93a","9d02190ca2c30bd8f17b48c4116ef9a33c2f14d8","e04b1728824985c44e9ea517930cf29b97db75a4","e41e2763dde6c3cfdf27fd5d0ce85d46c214cecf","62de6e6303b6b0d3cfd98d8e68d805d4f3f280e0","c3113ee8751f9060e6f3940eda19d1e53142ff21","add794d73150c08a12dcb4f2e848ffd2a885bd08","5e80aa98d70d61abffe8bcbcb364b3763688acc0","f1035d00b8776781af1966cad67c52063be1040a","e0370c2cbc196ffe9c59622b66dbf83064bd28aa","64f6b299a56e0998dfd8d74054ea7bd1b4e82e07","2f9ebe4b90e7674234d895b9974c6a095e45b312","10eac3b509fcbc3e42f5d12f4ccb4ccdd9c778b1","88ffe015c443f072c0aa0824560dda7eda511723","26f0c1066328921054a3ccdc36cf5001b0f8a04f","20d6252846e8bb1b217acb8fa0ef4f3d5bb4c54a","aa64e418bcf0a41469f32be516bc68a6ed95ad99","d0dd7a158a04b70fe5e418aab7d7cdc9afdae10a","5da4ae58ea038e379bbafbf85e172961c9cfa6fd","5f2874db61016ceb762e8c8b00ab6500d7594422","45aeac7db6c68ec996d597cf1aae8771bb5e0bd2"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Atorvastatin therapy increases heart rate variability, decreases QT variability, and shortens QTc interval duration in patients with advanced chronic heart failure.","doi":"10.1016/j.cardfail.2005.06.439","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cardfail.2005.06.439","venue":"Journal of cardiac failure"}

We show that these results hold in the case where buyer bargaining power is equal across buyers, but not in the case where bargaining power is asymmetric. We demonstrate it is possible when there are asymmetries in bargaining power that larger buyers, including pivotal buyers, can extract greater gains from trade than smaller buyers. We show that this result holds even if the supplier’s value function is convex. These results imply that horizontal merger might be used as a strategy to enhance bargaining position.","inCitations":["54056709100e027b438ea8aa5c24baafcdcd6192"],"pdfUrls":["https://transition.fcc.gov/ownership/materials/already-released/assymetric090002.pdf","http://transition.fcc.gov/ownership/materials/already-released/assymetric090002.pdf"],"title":"Asymmetric Bargaining Power and Pivotal Buyers","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

The ability of this inhibitor to prevent the fibrinolysis that occurs after a thrombogenic stimulus was investigated in a rabbit model. Normal and endotoxin-treated male New Zealand rabbits were infused with ancrod, an enzyme that causes noncrosslinked fibrin formation in vivo. Ancrod stimulated t-PA activity by 90% in normal rabbits and caused hypofibrinogenemia but did not increase PAI levels or induce fibrin deposition in target organs. Rabbits injected with endotoxin (10 micrograms/kg) showed an increase in PAI from less than 1 to 32 U/mL 4 hours later. When ancrod was infused at this time, 90% of the rabbits developed renal fibrin thrombi. Fibrin deposition was recorded in 40% of the rabbits that received a lower dose of endotoxin (1.0 microgram/kg) and had a PAI level of 14 U/ml at the time of ancrod infusion 4 hours later. Fibrin deposition did not occur in the endotoxin-treated rabbits that received normal saline. These data suggest that high levels of PAI inhibit fibrinolysis in vivo, thereby promoting fibrin clot deposition following a thrombogenic stimulus.","inCitations":["7a4e0a946811706cead04b3f32de63449b94337c","43b137c8ffdd6b9e720121790b0117f406f2a492","4edb6be276caa93c43707f50c50f0e795af717e8","d6003ba2e937e8afdb0703149567530ea0aa5f6e","e83af3a0fb5f43baa37c63e975415efe0880b1e0","cb6a2b0ee0c4c15bc63b560021a46471edf72575","515db4bf3e7bea3b54cf085dbbbf897c737cdff7","6a9869f8961f62eb6e99c9642c19afad8d550f0f","01fc6505288b0e0df1f38dfea88337fc0765ea17","9a3ccc2fc52e41d34048b6bb7ba274e6424af37e"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.bloodjournal.org/content/bloodjournal/69/3/798.full.pdf?sso-checked=true"],"title":"Plasminogen activator inhibitor: a regulator of ancrod-induced fibrin deposition in rabbits.","doi":"10.1182/blood.v69.3.798.798","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1182/blood.v69.3.798.798","venue":"Blood"}

Furthermore, the Mexican American is someone who knows the world of everyday life in common with others, and with others takes it for granted, and who uses background expectancies (i.e. common knowledge of everyday scenes) as a scheme of interpretation to manage his everyday affairs. The Mexican American, then, like any other member of society, not only engages in what Garfinkel calls \"judgmental work,\" but in doing so constantly relies upon the background knowledge of commonplace settings which he presumes he shares with others.2 That is, the Mexican American in managing his everyday affairs presumably does not comply with preestablished and legitimate alternative courses of action as spelled out by the dominant culture's normative abstract explanations of human behavior as described in most sociological theory. Rather, he tends to rely upon commonsense understandings of social structures about which we have little knowledge, and not upon the idealized norms that have been attributed to his culture or social status in the larger society by social scientists. True, the idealized norms of the social order form part of his background knowledge, but they do not fully explain how he goes about interpreting the norms to make sense of the many situations the Mexican American finds himself in and which may not have anything to do with his cultural heritage. In normative type explanations the primary focus tends to be on the Mexican American as he exists as a separate entity.3 That is to say, he is presented as if he lives in a vacuum, as if he is not part of a larger social system, and as if the linkages he has with the larger society do not make a difference in how he organizes and manages his affairs.

Many reference DNA sample repositories or \" DNA banks \" are now in existence to enable identification of forensic evidence or human remains as well as support epidemiological and genetic research and diagnosis. No DNA bank can satisfy its intended goals unless the desired genetic information latent in the original sample can be accessed analytically. NIST has studied the stability and accessibility of DNA in bloodstains and in extracts for over 20 years. The materials, methods, and technologies used by the forensic human identity and clinical communities have changed radically during this period. Initial studies focused on availability of DNA from dried bloodstains on the then-usual 903 cotton filter paper matrix stored at liquid nitrogen,-80 °C,-20 °C, and ambient temperatures. These studies were expanded to include the then newly-developed FTA coated paper matrix and storage at + 37 °C. Studies on the stability of DNA extracts stored in buffered aqueous solutions (TE buffer) supported the development of a series of Standard Reference Materials® produced for the forensic DNA community as well as the evaluation of new materials designed to assist in the storage of extracted DNA at ambient temperature. Likewise, the effects of shipping on DNA samples of various forms packaged in several ways have been studied; most recently an investigation of the effects of exposure to ionizing irradiation as used in package screening. DNA stability has been assessed using the highly multiplexed Short Tandem Repeat (STR) DNA typing technologies used by the human forensic identity community. The current stability metric is obtaining a complete \" STR profile \" using the several 16-plex commercial typing kits now available. Full STR profiles have been obtained for DNA from dried bloodstains stored at ambient temperature for 11 years on both 903 and FTA paper matrices and for stains stored on the FTA matrix at +37 °C for 11 years. Samples stored on the 903 matrix at +37 °C for 11 years were appreciably degraded but only one STR locus could not be typed using a commercial kit; however, full profiles for these samples were obtained using the newer \" miniSTR \" kits developed from other work performed at NIST. DNA extracted into TE buffer is a convenient and safe way of delivering reference materials to the forensic community using commercial shipping. To be useful, however, the …","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://www.nist.gov/sites/default/files/documents/oles/Forensics-NIST-2012-Abstracts-FINAL.pdf","http://www.nist.gov/oles/upload/Forensics-NIST-2012-Abstracts-FINAL.pdf"],"title":"Rapid High Sensitivity DNA Extraction Using Direct Rapid Analysis Generating Extracted Nucleotides ( DRAGEN )","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

This paper examines two curricular responses to the violence in the language of this group of fourteen-year-olds in relationship to the cultivation of civility. Civility is often defined as good manners or polite behavior. This is a shallow definition in comparison to how French philosopher, Balibar, develops a conception of civility closely related to the word’s Latin root of civilitas or citizenship. For Balibar (2016, 2001), civility is a set of concrete practices and conditions that make collective participation in democracy possible. These conditions rely on the recognition of human rights, or at minimum, the right to have rights, and on an understanding of shared fate.

Thirty-six percent of patients with SPB developed multiple myeloma (MM) in an average of 39 months, and 23% of patients with EMP developed MM in an average of 23 months. No significant differences in survival, incidence of MM, or interval to the development of MM were found between the two groups. The 11 cases of EMP with evaluable tissue for immunohistochemical study were either monotypic kappa or lambda, as were 9 of 10 SPB. Presence of monoclonality did not predict the development of MM. The histologic parameters of nuclear immaturity and presence of prominent nucleoli seem to be the best indicators of which patients will develop MM. Solitary plasmacytoma of bone and EMP appear to be more closely related than has been previously recognized.","inCitations":["f9d9c88a7209b216bf25077870f4afb9097865a8","3e6df28693c705e25cdb1bc2f6bfbd19a4378e94","3580b5fcf5c802b8beeffb4ea5e1813f205cdf3f","f9c41e36894cbfe5bde0e400d3910c1cd41ad18e","d040374c5568bebec7c1fdd590ff65275096d5f8","12e6e084e0cb2c85020e855633dd77d341796901","b72a3ef3c5411ae5bef5fb44bd3629fb7721b93d","5558bdc6d63f7b33bfaed5230d67d6b730a45957","37385966e4909b75657a9a7b6caa78203e4e53f0","90d9e4ab7af56c7a759ceb5f6e165df89395e8df","6cb7436a825881e9f762f1ebeaaf6e72abb93904","fad5aa11a886da44ce8d9588d633567dc11d7f57","d7c1f598a1aed72bb4a887d6c5ac2fb5e754d9bf","3af940b537f55585e6b1a25f613c93607a700d2f","f040b3ae1e39c953147c96dc6d9713ad76ebae9f","0502d034e7fff7d14e7101e59cfcd21e9b84779e","6e0c1b36b9ccdd221729587dd3d01f719923e7c9","9394989f0afca5007ce88a0f1cfdb8e81ce1ca08","2451ab6e7440c06b3a6b200ea2725501d603cdad","37a3068d3e44786c67edaba1f63258ff741ec214","70dc489609aac535b7898975d99f90bf7393bf62","1938532787c5c96ac065c7d8706e065233706fc6","0f145ff0c2e328dd2fe69b151735642ab708b048","d7f8f70dad418958c2e3ead51910faca0ffcc789","636c5ab84d3ae816808c8d8a6b123d1ffdfb25f1"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Solitary plasmacytomas of bone and extramedullary plasmacytomas.

The latter 3 organizations are resources for professional regulatory board members; as such, they do not represent a particular healthcare professional group. The CAC is a resource for the public members of regulatory boards and other governing bodies who serve as representatives of the public interest. The CAC advocates for change in the measurement of healthcare professionals’ competence, and, in 2004, published a road map of actions to achieve continuing competence assurance. The road map will be discussed later. The work of The Pew Health Professions Commission Taskforce on Health Care Workforce Regulation prompted the current debate about healthcare professionals’ regulation and continuing competence. Regarding all healthcare professions, the 1998 report identified major concerns about consumer protection, quality of care, and the competence of professionals to provide quality care. The taskforce observed that it is possible for a practitioner’s competence to diminish years after initial licensure, and, further, that continuing education hours, the most common requirement for continuing competence, do not guarantee competence. The report recommended that state boards should set not only competence standards for entry into practice but also require healthcare practitioners to demonstrate competence throughout their careers. Writing about the issue of continued competence, Lyon and Boland reported that nursing associations agreed with the basic premise that continued competence of healthcare practitioners is critical to a quality healthcare system but urged that documentation of competency be deferred to professional associations. Lyon and Boland defined the domains of competence as knowledge competence, technical competence, cultural competence, and communication competence.

At pH 7.5 fibrinogen has 3 binding sites of high affinity and several binding sites of low affinity. In the presence of MgCl2 (10(-2)M) the sites of low affinity are eliminated, suggesting that they are not specific and due to weak interactions. Study of the effect of the pH have demonstrated that the 3 sites of high affinity are not identical. At pH values below 7.5 one site is eliminated. This could be due either to an abnormal protonation or to a conformational change. No cooperativity between the sites was found. Partial identification of the binding site by means of direct titration of the calcium induced proton release have shown that the calcium is tightly bound through a chelate system. From the apparent dissociation constant obtained a possible involvement of histidine residues in this chelate system is suggested.","inCitations":["6cade51b143cc714674eba7381a343fde13c588f","5dfdb4dcf0fabb54608bb525c013ea275c9d001b","6b9e9a6f79444c896978a0fcf61dc1077a1e54d8","623c3e08ec5789596175b0249700e75fd9fbcb1a","b49aed83524f1b7b262899ce18236d354f23f0ab","859dfce3f7cb26d3b3f6029bd4604e1539f35ec9","9254638f595939a9de2c8ddc403287be1bb10362","f8b18b30f124ae8d979d0c2933a1b80109d70659"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"The binding of calcium to bovine fibrinogen.","doi":"10.1016/0005-2795(77)90109-X","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/0005-2795%2877%2990109-X","venue":"Biochimica et biophysica acta"}

Here, we used multisite field potential and extracellular recordings to validate the patterns of cortical SW/PSW seizures in chronically implanted, behaving cats. To investigate the cellular patterns and excitability during spontaneously occurring and electrically elicited cortical seizures, we used single and dual intracellular recordings from regular-spiking (RS) and fast-rhythmic-bursting (FRB) cortical neurons, in conjunction with field potential recordings from neocortex and related thalamic nuclei, in cats maintained under ketamine-xylazine anesthesia. 1) Invariably, the spontaneous or electrically induced seizures were initiated within the cortex of both behaving and anesthetized animals. Spontaneously occurring, compound seizures consisting of SW/PSW complexes at 2-4 Hz and fast runs at 10-15 Hz, developed without discontinuity from the slow (mainly 0.5-0.9 Hz), sleeplike, cortically generated oscillation. 2) During SW/PSW complexes, RS neurons discharged spike trains during the depth-negative component of the cortical \"spike\" component of field potentials and were hyperpolarized during the depth-positive field wave. The FRB neurons fired many more action potentials than RS cells during SW/PSW complexes. Averaged activities triggered by the spiky field potentials or by the steepest slope of depolarization in cortical neurons demonstrated similar relations between intracellular activities and field potentials during sleep and seizure epochs, the latter-being an exaggeration of the depolarizing and hyperpolarizing components of the slow sleep oscillation. 3) During the fast runs, RS cells were tonically depolarized and discharged single action potentials or spike doublets (usually with pronounced spike inactivation), whereas FRB cells discharged rhythmic spike bursts, time locked with the depth-negative field potentials. 4) Neuronal excitability, tested by depolarizing current pulses applied throughout the seizures and compared with pre- and postseizure epochs, showed a decreased number of evoked action potentials during both seizure components (SW/PSW complexes and fast runs), eventually leading to null responses during the postictal depression. 5) Data suggest that interconnected FRB neurons may play an important role in the initiation of cortical seizures. We discuss the similarities between the electrographic patterns described in this study and those found in different forms of clinical seizures.","inCitations":["e97e1d20675b5e499a08fd077dacbb8d0ebacca6","aeee5c13fa677e9865baa626d0e50e24bacbe0a5","826cb8c102964d65feeae4d5d7cb2585e667a829","3269330cb4428ebc4d09c1e0590b25c5517956ab","790bff4dbb5a0070bd6a341bed8c4a8bc4c01a05","7db769606645573ba755137d9730bc659b4d4d75","062b429c6412403c9dbf59a6d8cdd6d0dc676fd8","63ecd5e901ad67bbae7230105ed8b4bcfe40fbb0","3f93ea9a76855124e9ef6d049e91b28ea40e0b13","846ca01cc58ea187b782e35ccdc40b12724fac48","770b830a0d0f5e0fc77c43a4564325577de4b79f","2b4c66855e566f1541b8a1f53f4a458813d3aa6e","0eb42319af34989c814d5841125d388020518fbf","e5b4ea72b696fc095b8cae195cfafe4b2a73c8b7","cc30d1b2b68a7b4cb5cd637c7ac2fecf70c3f5c0","192d082747087c0edc5a8e5a92b94bc2771216c3","e0c8cf750fb24c862c816ae5f2fc3e074413d711","90ffa5a9039c1acf5c3a99c54328e95995a3d957","2c9f246288eb3f2698a8db8b06cd64c83148bbff","bde9b850b017b9db5aeff3864277e42c2c0ad026","97e02be5c53f9fdf325b7c3503a81dba11ab39c1","00b0dad60e6d9a89e55732ba8569bac7bafcbecf","d9c7ee3e24a1f8f5ec77f79740aab6087139dbcc","be6582dec63caba61b54ac5c573776b64d6c0c95","6302a5f046c313b1cf0e49aea023d33a864c053f","fcf73c09f1eb57b74f01fc6e0f33953a63b2dd85","f4c6abb7e855eafcce52015340226db1c5b17a41","ecfa754ecae3ce0a66c21cd2e76619e4add9f706","6be507f9bc366bf0b3a85f41f58af391f8781f9f","919c09b5810806d5422a143cc840a71a0caff8b9","371e91ef74c5f9d6a63d9015ef489436cd08b4d9","708eb765d9646fce305fc2f5f5182c60dcb8c121","66e4cdbbb77ffdfffb6389c8d35c7da5d1c6d6f0","06457263152d49d93fc46ee7532b59f6b086152a","125afb3ddb34884fb0ee8125523d43bcfd2bfe4e","26fc36b3b42fe34dbf164da481d53fab5a9625da","fc7a7123a65d6cf3aef40e8de9fe7cf8e7e5996e","ffad0fa71d05d6923b5f68271bd5b26e7a46f9a1","40f0ba8b7a9c71a8060223af9dc86908b5896157","de97194577e2871d6dc9cb1a2cfd197ab2c3d200","40fb101aef990e2e672288a0d0d7f6df444299a4","f9ccd7fdd7f34e5178737b90a373eff7d0878a7d","57de2f4db2b07b5af87b08dc980f73e03ced1e90","2af5abb6bfcd177297c0a6b42565b3dda3c06dc4","7c9f085eff42ecf47ac913dcba73bd1f86546005","965554fb69cec720fafb8d2c151f1b1da14b054d","3134544fbf05cd35360c20fdac78d39366a35496","4b2b544312561460b3e90fe5482ce2e055d19ac5","f8faf54dcc4268c81001a0c138b702322509e76a","c860f0a67d69103eeec66da166651429c36d0fb6","889a42f9b625770f06fd448caf8acb0ca30981af","9b549b8ab84bd025068446ead217c1d078dcf44c","b796491e49bd47b02fd48fb3468ced19b0d69282","330a089946d9a94610c4dd13646b459df842ba59","dcfe27640739a2831584073dd615bd28a03c98c6","fd53339c0777867df015723bd555f75c17f400dd","86d928303d80207ffbf2649daad817b059732ce1","3f0ac6cc9e565043c98e92a8b7a2091a64a4faea","cc47ba12f142ec6f3ebc0148a30145433f18e0e7","aab9ae5b3aa8a560998ca0af29134b263a473d75","47e2e253bfb667049144a5d72abde0febf4c11a6","79319abb7fa481ea75babfd7183e9ec6949cacb5","33c628e3b80bc0a9f0f0878fd85f1a60aa65b8d6","56f7c320ad362804a9663f2737b2bbb604f507f0","27eb1eb3628f081bad6d846ff0d328d1d1d45c25","7f1b19bae836590a91403c7b15d22f290e63a2a0","a9745db38660a68ff46e4b560e36ad82e00d41b1","e06156506732b76b6a7c637fabfacbdddd0861e6","359f45003376a8e88c0c1b8865404971916d1d80","0f55ca629399f414f5c09f26e8cf9027ea90540e","d279c294fd5d67386545284a0bb7cc7f3ba7a772","bf61c2b916a87292fa64a2179a18c1ca580071c5","110705063864259723dcc8ae95d78ab61de7a21f","2fb74400edbdd52f81f457a3b0ace691d8f36bdc","4a5814ca5e1e9d7cf33e5aaa8c8521036de1d4e6","af8b1d19e79c4328412df4b55937259e428440d2","569632b69e26839df4465d529a93d32ef908a384","16890f34e86c64cf3c9d911b7274132fc24fb188","1d0576b9a7a84a1e227678a9826d9415067faaa1","7fbc9a36f26fee2ea2b00c19c7382972208f6540","7f737b169e7ae4b762a84b80104d15a6d6536a58","9c20def619528585d44679501fe2c11618bb6ccd","161d68e8a45a19655957608d75f2039c989868a5","d5f38129be4c3e5287ff6a8eaa96e46e784b75f5","b1f41e62763825cd2840875030ab028fda473dbc","6ad81e37e008f824d5d0170a8513b739c70513bd","062e7105359debc638d6c6569256f5be969c38b0","1c4515fea0ed78cf31863d6547915a3f962b2434","b1c8edaac5669fc6497a4bb947c8c9ea99ada6ac","8809181c735d00d123221c35b6300c027b27596e","3af384d2232d4f160e8746a51c13b357c2f2a17c","fe9c26fedcab0746113ef8a4391a080b5be95dc4","4fd0f3635803b91731da5ac00f463892ae275f87","9f5507b7e1c926da530f9815df16444e8b56912a","8a1c1a70e7d227d0fad92182b650c0fdef762c7f","3a5b2e3a467248a90bc7380279bbdfb961c49519","890dd7195561bdb87bce372f8cfd5b584fbd3d45"],"pdfUrls":["https://cervo.ulaval.ca/pages_perso_chercheurs/timofeev_i/pdf/1998/1998Seizures2.pdf","http://w3.fmed.ulaval.ca/dev/timofeevgroup/fileadmin/documents/documents/1998/1998seizures2.pdf","http://jn.physiology.org/content/jn/80/3/1456.full.pdf"],"title":"Spike-wave complexes and fast components of cortically generated seizures.

Ultrahigh-field MR system (beyond 3T) has great potential to produce newly improved imaging capabilities for both clinical diagnosis and basic science research. The primary purpose of venography was the description of cerebral veins, but it has also been applied successfully in imaging of stroke, multiple sclerosis, tumors or hemorrhagic lesions. By now susceptibility weighted imaging (SWI) has played part of the clinical diagnosis at 1.5T and 3.0T MR scanning [1,2]. Recently, studies have reported the potential of venography study at 7T MRI [3]. The aim of this study was to optimize and to evaluate ultra high resolution 3D venography for the visualization of micro-cerebral veins at 7 T MRI.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://cds.ismrm.org/protected/09MProceedings/files/00954.pdf"],"title":"Ultra high resolution venography using T 2 * weighted imaging at 7 T MRI","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Nella maggior parte dei casi tali lesioni sono localizzate in sede intraparenchimale a livello degli emisferi cerebrali, dei gangli della base e del tronco encefalico e presentano delle caratteristiche neuroradiologiche “tipiche”. Molto più rari e poco conosciuti sono gli angiomi cavernosi extraparenchimali, che si sviluppano nella maggior parte dei casi a livello del seno cavernoso e si estendono secondariamente ad occupare la fossa cranica media. Queste lesioni, pur presentando le stesse caratteristiche istologiche degli angiomi cavernosi intraparenchimali, se ne differenziano notevolmente per gli aspetti neuroradiologici. Lo scopo di questo lavoro è, attraverso la descrizione di un caso ed una revisione della letteratura, fornire una descrizione degli aspetti semeiologici tipici di queste lesioni per consentire una corretta diagnosi differenziale rispetto alle lesioni più frequenti in tale sede, in particolare i meningiomi e i neurinomi.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Angioma cavernoso del seno cavernoso","doi":"10.1177/19714009030160S1126","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1177/19714009030160S1126","venue":""}

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the inter- and intra-observer reliability of these three radiological angles on the basis of lateral X-rays in lumbar spine fractures with spinal kyphosis.Patients and methodsA consecutive series of 88 patients with traumatic lumbar spine fractures with kyphotic deformities were included in the study. All patients were younger that 50 years of age and had an adequate trauma leading to the fracture. Three independent observers with different levels of clinical training measured the vertebral, segmental and local kyphosis of these patients on the basis of lateral X-rays. The readings were repeated 4 weeks later to assess intra-observer reliability.ResultsThe most common injury mechanism was a fall from a height of more than 3 m. The first lumbar vertebra was the most commonly affected. Mean inter- and intra-observer reliabilities were good for the vertebral (mean ICC: 0.6607; mean ICC: 0.6979) and local (mean ICC: 0.7778; mean ICC: 0.7642) kyphosis and excellent (mean ICC: 0.8129; mean ICC: 0.8103) for the segmental kyphosis.ConclusionIn this study, the segmental-, vertebral-, and local kyphosis angle according to Cobb showed sufficient inter- and intra-observer reliability for the use in daily practice and scientific studies.","inCitations":["2f92a838e61526bb2a4899fe80827acb1333e67c","8122c919177627c97718ec260652c7903249543c","de26ca5415d47053c8f01fb3514e3a6dca9e6c85","30701741cd0c29a3294a1e3e80a96f0d1773a7e7","0e17adf401c19debd25254ff8f53084a872310bb","b03c02b7fcee15d1d1975ee94b47da9f739ba4fd","76c0944a92c54679cbdebc9eb36b800d8062246f"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Inter- and intra-observer reliability of the Cobb angle in the measurement of vertebral, local and segmental kyphosis of traumatic lumbar spine fractures in the lateral X-ray","doi":"10.1007/s00402-010-1104-5","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00402-010-1104-5","venue":"Archives of Orthopaedic and Trauma Surgery"}

The apparatus is called a ‘signaphone’, and is already installed in about forty buildings in Paris. When used as a fire alarm, the device is operated either by thermostats fixed near the ceiling, or by push buttons so that a watchman has only to press the nearest button. The thermostats are operated by hot air rising to the ceiling when fire breaks out. This breaks a closed electric circuit, and an electrical relay at once starts a clockwork motor. The motor drives a small dialling drum, the small metal discs on which correspond to the letters and figures of the telephone number of the nearest fire station. The station is thus called up and a gramophone record then comes into action giving, in a verbal message, the location of the fire and all essential details. This message is repeated continuously for 31 minutes. If necessary, also, it can be made to ring up a second number for example, that of the owner of the building and repeat its message. When used as a burglar alarm, the signaphone is connected with an electric circuit in the building. In this case, a burglar who opens a door or window, takes down a picture or tries to open a safe or desk, without knowing it thereby summons the police, who learn from the the gramophone message what is happening. Anyone who desires to have both a fire and burglar alarm must have two signaphones installed. The Post Office has given permission for these devices to be attached to telephones on automatic exchanges. It has also met with the approval of the Metropolitan Police, to whom it has been demonstrated.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Automatic Fire and Burglar Alarms","doi":"10.1038/136946d0","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1038/136946d0","venue":"Nature"}

Subsequently, we investigate the policy question of whether immigration has helped reduced unemployment rate disparities across Spanish regions by attracting immigrant flows to regions offering better employment opportunities. Our results indicate that immigrants choose to reside in regions with larger employment rates and where their probability of finding a job is higher. In particular, and despite some differences depending on their origin, immigrants appear generally more responsive than their native counterparts to a higher likelihood of informal, self, or indefinite employment. More importantly, insofar the vast majority of immigrants locate in regions characterized by higher employment rates, immigration contributes to greasing the wheels of the Spanish labor market by narrowing regional unemployment rate disparities.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Immigrants' Responsiveness to Labor Market Conditions and Their Impact on Regional Disparities: Evidence from Spain","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

We construct contention-free wavelength planes (lambda-planes) by assigning dedicated wavelengths to each ingress node. Bursts are transmitted to their egress nodes on lambda-planes, along routes forming a spanning tree. As a result, contention at intermediate core nodes is completely eliminated, and contention at ingress nodes is resolved by means of electric buffer. This paper develops a spanning tree construction algorithm, aiming at balancing input loads among output ports at each ingress node. Further a wavelength assignment algorithm is proposed, which is based on the amount of traffic lost at ingress nodes. We show that the proposed scheme can decrease the burst loss probability drastically, even if traffic intensities at ingress nodes are different.","inCitations":["d229a7602a5095e1f70a1f9220c870db8d175f9e"],"pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.2006.414"],"title":"OPNp1-3: Contention-Free l-Planes in Optically Burst-Switched WDM Networks","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.2006.414","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.2006.414","venue":"IEEE Globecom 2006"}

These advances have moved the field from the multi-km interferometer of a gravitational wave observatory, to the optical table top, and now all the way down to a silicon microchip [4]. In this talk I will describe these advances, and discuss our own work to realize radiation pressure within nanoscale structures in the form of coupled photonic and phononic crystals (dubbed optomechanical crystals; see Figure 1 below) [5]. Applications of these new nano-opto-mechanical systems include: all-optically tunable photonics, optically powered RF and microwave oscillators, and precision force/acceleration and mass sensing. Additionally there is the potential for these systems to be used in hybrid quantum networks, enabling storage or transfer of quantum information between disparate quantum systems. I will introduce several conceptual ideas regarding phonon-photon translation [6] and slow light effects [7] which may be used in such quantum settings, and discuss recent experiments to realize them in practice [8].","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Optomechanical crystals and their quantum optical applications","doi":"10.1109/CLEOE.2011.5943656","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CLEOE.2011.5943656","venue":"IEEE Photonics Conference 2012"}

At the University of California San Diego Medical Center, the director of the patient education department and I gathered fiscal and creative resources to develop a new approach to solving the problem. We designed the Discharge Planning Education Package, including a handbook containing everything you need to know about coordinating a patient's discharge and follow-up care, plus posters, tear-off pads, and two videotapes. The tapes, \"The Surprise Discharge\" and \"Discharge in the AM,\" offer a humorous look at discharge-planning gone awry. In inservice sessions, the laughter generated by the tapes creates a receptiveness to using the entire discharge planning package. The package has been well received at UCSD and at several other healthcare institutions in other parts of the country. Since we've been using the Discharge Planning Education Package at UCSD, we find that nurses have become more involved in coordinating patients' discharges. Attendance at weekly dischargeplanning meetings is at an all-time high. Physicians and other members of the team have begun planning alternate care arrangements long before discharge. Nurses are documenting realistic discharge criteria on admission. And our quality-assurance scores for discharge-planning activities are higher than ever.

It plays important roles in systemic vascular functions, but there is little information on CD38 in pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells (PASMCs). Earlier studies suggested a redox-sensing role of CD38 in hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction. This study sought to characterize its roles in angiotensin II (Ang II)-induced Ca(2+) release (AICR) in PASMCs. Examination of CD38 expression in various rat arteries found high levels of CD38 mRNA and protein in pulmonary arteries. The Ang II-elicited Ca(2+) response consisted of extracellular Ca(2+) influx and intracellular Ca(2+) release in PASMCs. AICR activated in the absence of extracellular Ca(2+) was reduced by pharmacological or siRNA inhibition of CD38, by the cADPR antagonist 8-bromo-cADPR or ryanodine, and by the NAADP antagonist Ned-19 or disruption of endolysosomal Ca(2+) stores with the vacuolar H(+)-ATPase inhibitor bafilomycin A1. Suppression of AICR by the inhibitions of cADPR- and NAADP-dependent pathways were nonadditive, indicating interdependence of RyR- and NAADP-gated Ca(2+) release. Furthermore, AICR was inhibited by the protein kinase C inhibitor staurosporine, the nonspecific NADPH oxidase (NOX) inhibitors apocynin and diphenyleneiodonium, the NOX2-specific inhibitor gp91ds-tat, and the scavenger of reactive oxygen species (ROS) tempol. These results provide the first evidence that Ang II activates CD38-dependent Ca(2+) release via the NOX2-ROS pathway in PASMCs.","inCitations":["116add34e8a06a23c4eb3a11b42024770b3fe0ed","d65697127434722d4fb6871d31477ed1889acf9e","0edb9219dbd4426641e01ac5a75d264b25da077a","1376ee51e1dfe75df9001b9007324a8ba115dfcc","34cd5c4d4b5959086a63cfd43a7c0a09a710db4b","bfc33eab7e2ef58308b916b1c716c7827200dcb7","504eb87bfed51cee91f11cf1721fdc58c17ef292","e9c5c65638e38311fb7f12a6fecc4a45d1314f7d"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"CD38 mediates angiotensin II-induced intracellular Ca(2+) release in rat pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells.","doi":"10.1165/rcmb.2014-0141OC","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1165/rcmb.2014-0141OC","venue":"American journal of respiratory cell and molecular biology"}

ART1 is predominantly expressed in skeletal and cardiac muscle. It ADP-ribosylates α7-integrin which together with β1-integrin forms a dimer and binds to laminin, a protein of the extracellular matrix involved in cell adhesion. This posttranslational modification leads to an increased laminin binding affinity.ResultsUsing C2C12 and C3H-10T 1/2 cells as models of myogenesis, we found that ART1 expression was restricted to myotube formation. We identified a fragment spanning the gene 1.3 kb upstream of the transcriptional start site as the functional promoter of the ART1 gene. This region contains an E box and an A/T-rich element, two conserved binding sites for transcription factors found in the promoters of most skeletal muscle specific genes. Mutating the DNA consensus sequence of either the E box or the A/T-rich element resulted in a nearly complete loss of ART1 promoter inducibility, indicating a cooperative role of the transcription factors binding to those sites. Gel mobility shift analyses carried out with nuclear extracts from C2C12 and C3H-10T 1/2 cells revealed binding of myogenin to the E box and MEF-2 to the A/T-rich element, the binding being restricted to C2C12 and C3H-10T 1/2 myotubes.ConclusionHere we describe the molecular mechanism underlying the regulation of the ART1 gene expression in skeletal muscle cells. The differentiation-dependent upregulation of ART1 mRNA is induced by the binding of myogenin to an E box and of MEF-2 to an A/T-rich element in the proximal promoter region of the ART1 gene. Thus the transcriptional regulation involves molecular mechanisms similar to those used to activate muscle-specific genes.","inCitations":["0c18d05d14cbdd113d5cd7f000704b7616e4b56b","3da6e5b4796fd4ff8655953ac512d2a57ca47834","7a8329ae767bf085c5360eef094a0614f9ca75b3","d6310d89299edb8e91f9e8dd1392abf5e7c13536","8ecb6df59317252b184498a6729510713dbaf793","d2c797554a9856f8d8ea91a2600f6fe35ca25e43","5a3847cfb5895d8ff7a5f9ba88e24f354ec8c200","ee99ae1c6d77a1bb97ed9fafc6ae7c85506c384e"],"pdfUrls":["ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/pmc/08/fa/BMC_Mol_Biol_2008_Oct_21_9_91.tar.gz","https://static-content.springer.com/esm/art:10.1186%2F1471-2199-9-91/MediaObjects/12867_2008_348_MOESM1_ESM.pdf"],"title":"Identification of two regulatory binding sites which confer myotube specific expression of the mono-ADP-ribosyltransferase ART1 gene","doi":"10.1186/1471-2199-9-91","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2199-9-91","venue":"BMC Molecular Biology"}

Corrosion of their metallic reflective layer is considered a major problem in facilities which are located near industrial sites, where reduced sulphur gases may be present. Accelerated ageing tests were performed to study the influence of H2S on the corrosion of two types of silvered glass reflectors and one aluminium reflector. Different degradation patterns were found for silvered glass reflectors, whereas aluminium reflectors did not corrode in the presence of the sulphurous gas. Therefore, industrial pollution caused by this type of gas may decrease the solar collectors’ performance.","inCitations":["1b03afdf0519069f63b072bbca034dccf058d78c","7b32624ebb1bf65ea6ebc4dd841b300e3e13f4c5","01b8a369a4fbda249e8a25185ab0470b9504aca0","c6220a0d0d8ec2ee4bacea2fba532986749f5ac8"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Effects of reduced sulphur atmospheres on reflector materials for concentrating solar thermal applications","doi":"10.1016/j.corsci.2018.01.021","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.corsci.2018.01.021","venue":""}

Furthermore, every CGF system is different, with different user interfaces requiring significant learning time for operators to be effective. Users must conform to the idiosyncrasies of each CGF rather than the system conforming to user. We present an intelligent user interface (IUI) that raises the level of interaction to one of supervisory control, allowing a user to issue commands in more natural terms, and getting feedback from the CGFs in natural terms. We present some formative results that show the potential for significantly reducing the workload of CGF operators.","inCitations":["7c17bb3e5e8032152552799e080fc273aadee002","0d02b1616caa4a8dbd8b7665f6455df46c7d7955"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a569261.pdf"],"title":"Formative Evaluation of an IUI for Supervisory Control of CGFs","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}
