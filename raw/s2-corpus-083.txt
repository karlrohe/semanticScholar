A 67-year-old woman with rheumatoid arthritis of the left knee had a LCS prosthesis implanted without cement, using a rotating patellar component. Seven years later, a fracture of the lateral tibial plateau occurred owing to an osteolytic defect with no traumatic accident. The rotating patellar bearing over-rotated and locked; consequently, wear occurred between the patellar metal tray and the femoral component. Immunohistochemistry revealed CD68-positive macrophages in the osteolytic region and phagocytosis of metal particles. The osteolytic region was filled with autogenous bone, and all components were exchanged and cemented. The patient's condition became satisfactory with relief of pain.","inCitations":["5d119041e85a4019365a529e5527d9aa99527279","fcde08807690173d453ca04acd085f693fc480ef","16761213870786ba3c5ff27d48230de0a4b7bb94","3fc3aadb0cc9331905088e66d79e57f417486bc4"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Periprosthetic fracture of the tibia associated with osteolysis caused by failure of rotating patella in low-contact-stress total knee arthroplasty.","doi":"10.1054/arth.2002.35792","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1054/arth.2002.35792","venue":"The Journal of arthroplasty"}

To attain a higher quality level of service than the competitor in the market, Design for Six Sigma (DFSS) has been developed as a breakthrough strategy for service process design and/or redesign, which is fundamental to the delivery of service quality to the customer. Meanwhile, a faster time-to-market capability of service can be obtained through utilising the speed advantage of Lean. Therefore, it is the motivation of this paper for researching that DFSS when combined with Lean can be synergistic in the upfront design phases of the service development process. In addition, a methodology that integrates the individual benefits of DFSS and Lean was developed, and a case study of software development process was conducted to examine the effectiveness of the methodology.","inCitations":["059b35ad31e6e133c82e8d4772a2a3419e982326","611d10ffff4bf04273f3d4da616d7fc01e48cff5","0a71bdb164bbe44e1c1d2b67239c0a522c369abd","f3ea7d512817c5e26ee57355e2ec93ced67bf3a4"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Service process design and/or redesign by fusing the powers of Design for Six Sigma and Lean","doi":"10.1504/IJSSCA.2007.015015","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1504/IJSSCA.2007.015015","venue":""}

Under artificial manipulation, they can mate and produce fertile offspring. As serious agricultural insect pests, cotton bollworms are euryphagous insects, but oriental tobacco budworms are oligophagous insects. To identify the differentially expressed genes that affect host recognition and host adaptation between the two species, we constructed digital gene expression tag profiles for four developmental stages of the two species. High-throughput sequencing results indicated that we have got more than 23 million 17nt clean tags from both species, respectively. The number of unique clean tags was nearly same in both species (approximately 357,000).ResultsAccording to the gene annotation results, we identified 83 and 68 olfaction related transcripts from H. armigera and H. assulta, respectively. At the same time, 1137 and 1138 transcripts of digestion enzymes were identified from the two species. Among the olfaction related transcripts, more odorant binding protein and G protein-coupled receptor were identified in H. armigera than in H. assulta. Among the digestion enzymes, there are more detoxification enzyme, e.g. P450, carboxypeptidase and ATPase in H. assulta than in H. armigera. These differences partially explain that because of the narrow host plant range of H. assulta, more detoxification enzymes would help them increase the food detoxification and utilization efficiency.ConclusionsThis study supplied some differentially expressed genes affecting host selection and adaptation between the two sibling species. These genes will be useful information for studying on the evolution of host plant selection. It also provides some important target genes for insect species-specific control by RNAi technology.","inCitations":["1f7ebd971dd97030aea0f382842f29caa646c24b","71cb38c7f9b38792ab4b90f03fa08d9a6570b273","b702a9d5e0b76744aff4c3a41ba945c9d30c052d","d0621d84de59a0d51fb5b38bdca17dcff68e2805","acccd642ded07ebf74693686327171139d7a259e","161595bc346662953ab1341eebb7d8f5319186a8","378db8fbdcaeae8203c6e84d2aad9873e7a47526","774b55c4a9f2bacea6bb786fd5b8994854d27af7","ec6d1c20e3511b041e16cbff4da2fdf44ace9e6f","a3e179b61889d175c7adbc0b0f5332e8676f48f5","f0a883361d253889a1c84f8d23790c14b3f49c91","3fd89bfffab5cbba5671acc4774b7417ebca0c46"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Identification of differential expression genes associated with host selection and adaptation between two sibling insect species by transcriptional profile analysis","doi":"10.1186/1471-2164-14-582","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2164-14-582","venue":"BMC Genomics"}

Also, higher DCLK1 expression is reported in esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) compared to Barrett esophagus and normal tissue. However, studies on the effect of DCLK1 in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), which accounts for about 90% of diagnosed EC in Asia areas, were not yet reported. Methods CRISPR/Cas9 genome-editing technique was used to knockout DCLK1 in ESCC cells (Kyse450, Kyse70). Subsequently, the proliferative and invasive potential of these cells was evaluated using Real-Time Cell Analyzer for proliferation, wound healing assay for migration, and transwell assay for invasion. Epithelial-mesenchymal transformation (EMT) associated transcriptional factors and MEK/ERK pathway were tested by western blot. In addition, the correlation heatmap between DCLK1 expression and EMT associated transcriptional factors, and MEK/ERK pathway was analyzed in R among 95 ESCC patients from The Cancer Genome Atla (TCGA) database. Results CRISPR/Cas9 technology efficiently disrupted the DCLK1 gene and abrogated its expression in ESCC cell lines. DCLK1 deficiency significantly inhibited proliferation, migration and invasion of ESCC cells. DCLK1 deletion resulted in notable molecular changes including downregulation of mesenchymal markers such as Vimentin, ZEB1, Slug and Snail, and up-regulation of epithelial marker E-cadherin. Additionally, the phosphorylation of MEK/ERK pathway was inhibited in DCLK1-KO ESCC cells. Accordingly,evidence from TCGA ESCA demonstrated that human ESCCs expressing high levels of DCLK1 correlate with activated MEK/ERK pathway signaling suggesting greater EMT transition activity. Conclusions CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout of DCLK1 results in a dramatic suppression of ESCC aggressiveness via inhibiting EMT and MEK/ERK pathway. Importantly, this study demonstrates DCLK1's functional significance in ESCC for the first time and provides a theoretical basis for the development of DCLK1-based biomarkers and targeted therapies.

Drip tubing was buried at a depth of eight inches along the midline of each planting bed. Irrigation was applied daily as needed to maintain the predetermined target soil water tension levels and Nfertilizer (urea ammonium nitrate solution) was applied in 4 or 5 split applications. Broccoli spears and cauliflower curds were harvested weighed and graded according to prevailing commercial practices. The optimum marketable yield of broccoli of 4.6 tons /acre was achieved with a total application of 18.9 inches of water and 267 lbs. N /acre. The optimum marketable yield of cauliflower of 9.5 tons /acre was achieved with a total application of 18.5 inches of water and 178 lbs. N /acre. For both crops a nitrogen deficiency had a greater negative impact on marketable yieldthan either deficient or excessive water application. Optimum marketable yields, earliness and head quality for both crops were achieved when the average soil water tension level for the entire season was maintained at about 10 cbars (or 13 cbars uncorrected gauge reading).","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Water and Nitrogen Interactions in Subsurface Drip Irrigated Broccoli and Cauliflower Production","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Experiment 1 demonstrated that a unilateral parasagittal knife cut in the MH combined with a contralateral coronal knife cut in either the ventrolateral pons (vP) or ventrolateral medulla (vM) significantly increased food intake and body weight in adult female rats. Overeating and overweight were also produced by a unilateral MH knife cut combined with a contralateral oblique cut under the nucleus of the solitary tract and dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus complex (NST/DX). In contrast, an MH cut x dorsolateral medullary cut combination did not increase food intake or body weight compared to a MH cut alone or sham surgery. Experiment 2 demonstrated that the hyperphagia/obesity effect of MH x vP knife cuts was comparable to that obtained with bilateral PVN lesions, but less than that produced by bilateral MH knife cuts. Bilateral vP cuts also increased body weight but the effect was less than that obtained with the other experimental treatments. Feeding the rats a high-fat diet rather than chow potentiated the hyperphagia and obesity syndromes produced by the various lesion conditions. Taken together, these findings suggest that the medial hypothalamic hyperphagia and obesity syndrome is due, in part, to damage to PVN projections to the caudal brainstem, the NST/DX complex in particular. The functional significance of this PVN-hindbrain \"feeding\" pathway and the identity of extra-PVN components of the hyperphagia-obesity syndrome remain to be established.","inCitations":["358963ccb19e3f2d0fa53cc40ac58ce13252ef0b","9f2a9584fe0d34f97dbf5ad9a1b3e0759a63bb89","ac31616947816d7cbd74bd0adba064f03e2d03ca","e1194d599a00183e1ddf37c1f398e82b34473a93","d7f07299c6901dadf1d74d4c0b1e10377a934981","d56a184601b844601a958bcc9ad79f5a24b5a05d","a4fd73ab2d88da1ee0c58c9f11dcf2477ab6e01e","b82627aac53eebfbb1ea65b5a88ffc58060096a8","e3150f4cc9932a8e8ae8c70e30bdc66b6a2d6c2a","598e4c3f960a061632ec6a394d388a63e8c7231e","b758784ac3bd8fbc0da8f962200c23764bb8586e","44bedab6e1bcaa2f204e94a5874363ab626059fa","0b68be25705eeddd7aa7c39706d6fa4f51f0d311","517fd831a3e15744cb3199805954aa9ecf088c3e","03ba127922de0a4a893d092f12f72dfc4e811b40","bdb9921f571d791ad07a4131b17303285a65a734","c691cc6a19329858f8e7bdaf5bb64d5fbb68f852","aa521eb62dbb4fe17c8deb2ea1fc97b3235e4dce","be1944d9ad76a823913fea33997caf57d43b6348","8ab75055685b7b9d664a4d60765a9b10b80929ab","a882a0b0266682206fddc25025a2d1a70cec60f9","7cf7276c8ac043d9025b99c1ff6e5113e94260c2","68b7e5884cfe68169a82dd53dddcb025becc45cd","a5aba145c32dbdf9391b4783ed1e7d87649b4697","7de370e7be98a524ae31b50435a496db2f2a509a","0d76eb05bb8b8dfcb77da34aadd94af321f357ac","4abf4a8b9bc7df568213db41e91e385dba0cdc8e"],"pdfUrls":["https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/0031938488901539","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0031938488901539?dgcid=api_sd_search-api-endpoint"],"title":"PVN-hindbrain pathway involved in the hypothalamic hyperphagia-obesity syndrome","doi":"10.1016/0031-9384(88)90153-9","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/0031-9384%2888%2990153-9","venue":"Physiology & Behavior"}

The glia are one of the main effectors of neuronal repair in the nervous system, but the dynamic interactions between peripheral neurons and Schwann cells during injury and regeneration remain incompletely characterized. Here, we combine laser microsurgery, genetic analysis, high-resolution intravital imaging and lattice light-sheet microscopy to study the interaction between Schwann cells and sensory neurons in a zebrafish model of neurotrauma. We found that chronic denervation by neuronal ablation leads to Schwann-cell death, whereas acute denervation by axonal severing does not affect the overall complexity and architecture of the glia. Neuronal-circuit regeneration begins when Schwann cells extend bridging processes to close the injury gap. Regenerating axons grow faster and directionally after the physiological clearing of distal debris by the Schwann cells. This might facilitate circuit repair by ensuring that axons are guided through unoccupied spaces within bands of Büngner towards their original peripheral target. Accordingly, in the absence of Schwann cells, regenerating axons are misrouted, impairing the re-innervation of sensory organs. Our results indicate that regenerating axons use haptotaxis as a directional cue during the reconstitution of a neural circuit. These findings have implications for therapies aimed at neurorepair, which will benefit from preserving the architecture of the peripheral glia during periods of denervation.","inCitations":["7b708f37400ce9577e90a58e20361d80ee0bbb08","e1664199662033043a6f6c50b60ca63a89942a26","f3ef7cea802dc6cf2f68c7889cba7ffd099e7844","9431ac62fe49d564b6737412d16a2296a7eed773","3b0b76962873509673795af9991d3e9cab9cb701","8acb614f01ad24bf3454d9b8e59c318f487cf436","7dff1b7ea8e6d6b1a19cf2a566c574e44af7525a","575c762d1602aae5a5862d8aef1f516904570b70","e26c1f472bd2c3fc58d1fc834db23787f4d00e3e","8eadeff6304377bb382db314f036ed50b45f3ed1","ba4816961d50e974459ffa7cf082d2633ac8312b","2d3565b3432795ab2a0ca3f7726b6314624c4774","8b6313fc6c2931726183264893ae4aad79fe7fc7","81a3a970da64ab1d4de02e04f150581ea18af858","c55a35c762d9ad52f2f248403a50ef656d7ee09d","0bd8fd657111bc3db0faa26b5d59596cbe4d5920","e1d0ea74e13b2db70c97503c9d8ad63112c1e05e"],"pdfUrls":["http://dmm.biologists.org/content/dmm/8/6/553.full.pdf","http://dmm.biologists.org/content/dmm/8/6/553.full.pdf?with-ds=yes"],"title":"High-resolution live imaging reveals axon-glia interactions during peripheral nerve injury and repair in zebrafish","doi":"10.1242/dmm.018184","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1242/dmm.018184","venue":"Disease models & mechanisms"}

Setting The questionnaires were distributed from university pharmacies in 12 large cities across Finland. Method The data were collected with two questionnaire surveys among women who used hormonal contraceptives in 2001 and 2007. In the 2001 survey the response rate was 53% (n = 264) and in the 2007 survey 55% (n = 436). Results The number of respondents who considered professional information sources the most important information sources was markedly bigger in 2007 than in 2001 (P = 0.005). The most common source of information concerning the benefits of hormonal contraceptives was a physician (2001: 43%, 2007: 53%). The most common source of information concerning the risks of hormonal contraceptives was friends and relatives (43%) in 2001 and physician in 2007 (35%). Only a few percent of the respondents considered a pharmacy the most important information source both the 2001 and 2007 surveys. Conclusion The importance of health care professionals as sources of information concerning hormonal contraceptives has increased. However, role of pharmacists as information source was surprisingly small. Women who use hormonal contraceptives need more information from professional sources to alleviate possible fears associated with use.","inCitations":["9ccd6f230c08f73eaee5a7e1931a872afa1f778b","330c7d52e2b2cf39956a6536f12605fe20722755","933817ac15c7393398660d142e4bd1da1e4fda9c","2a636bb2ab33fc9080acd4bb49430ae10905553b","d3b86d1c349000c643735aa667a0c07ca3f72185"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Information sources used by women in Finland who use hormonal contraceptives","doi":"10.1007/s11096-009-9344-6","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11096-009-9344-6","venue":"Pharmacy World & Science"}

We also prove the converse in case the function is continuous. In particular, we show that if Levinson’s inequality holds under Mercer’s assumptions, then the function is 3-convex.","inCitations":["d0db029190d259a7893887f6f0a66f3971c1fbbe","3f073e379c5fde655ac3e1edb729f091b6d2db5a","f3bb748b9f3c32444c19737b5a4de98bb9ba820c","b66d94b13d4f59c1f098e7ad5a86a0e273582b6e","2836f7069f327cc1d46efc15caf3ce0d8aeef306","6d7590e32ed96150f4279a91992edad587998f2d","5ead089d4e231c6d4d1b046d3a9a07c20ee4c9a9","b5c14385cc9c434e8e18faf948ebdc65955206b9","3e451357275f59efc4959bd50797dff8d3a8eba9","15bd33fcb1370d77f11c201ad1149ffb65bfad4d","6159898ac1d784cdec5e2f1fe71a03f5f45b5325","93ef50c7aa4d67fd2a5cd22d10ff1e1e41ca6c17"],"pdfUrls":["http://files.ele-math.com/articles/jmi-09-49.pdf","http://files.ele-math.com/abstracts/jmi-09-49-abs.pdf"],"title":"Generalization of Levinson's inequality","doi":"10.7153/jmi-09-49","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.7153/jmi-09-49","venue":""}

The first distinct features are extracted in a pair of stereo images using a feature extractor. Then a newly developed window-based feature point detector is used to detect feature points from the extracted feature in both images. Feature points are connected with two points to form a straight line in both images. A match function representing the requirements of the epipola and disparity constraints in both images is proposed for straight line matching. Important information can be obtained from the parameter values attached to each line, such as distance and orientation. Information contained in the match function is used to determine straight-line correspondence. The method described here takes a unique approach to match straight lines. After that straight-line correspondence is established using the match function values in the left image and corresponding ones in the right image. Triplets of matched points are used to construct a model polygon in the left image. Then the entire right image is searched by an exhaustive search method to find a matching polygon. The computational complexity of the proposed method is proportional to the number of detected feature points in the image pair. Experimental results indicate that the method performs well for a variety of stereo images, and it is suitable for many applications.","inCitations":["3063c0167466c3141589cc381bb051bbf262f81f","fca9776adb81de60c896907b86550a17847b5e6e"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Stereo correspondence using geometric relational matching","doi":"10.1117/12.334708","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1117/12.334708","venue":"Electronic Imaging"}

Much of the discussion of behaviourally informed approaches has focused on ‘nudges’; that is, non-fiscal and non-regulatory interventions that steer (nudge) people in a specific direction while preserving choice. Less attention has been paid to boosts, an alternative evidence-based class of non-fiscal and non-regulatory intervention. The goal of boosts is to make it easier for people to exercise their own agency in making choices. For instance, when people are at risk of making poor health, medical or financial choices, the policy-maker – rather than steering behaviour through nudging – can take action to foster or boost individuals’ own decision-making competences. Boosts range from interventions that require little time and cognitive effort on the individual's part to ones that require substantial amounts of training, effort and motivation. This article outlines six rules that policy-makers can apply in order to determine under which conditions boosts, relative to nudges, are the preferable form of non-fiscal and non-regulatory intervention. The objective is not to argue that boosts are better than nudges or vice versa, but to begin to spell out the two approaches’ respective conditions for success.","inCitations":["1592f2423579257ec8126e5963804402b76061b3","8f879e9a6ffdd6ef1f89c489cb00743a9781a1e5","451210ef4eda0a32a5e43b1b9bed030b8c2feb02","bd51e059adb23900e266d1cb3ec56904d16973be","13c7b3a9f63e548c131338422437a9e5f3c7eb3a","313c8053adbcc984bffb4624b794894fdb624db0","b12e5ba06f21a52e3016e02e1a982968362eca82","6d5c22e0fcf4a71a60ef2292aa1393510c210115","dc572716f35c249a97778be6c5aec624d085d99f","3d71fefda2144c2e090b70a99b944308c9a9a926","4b50ba57a77585ff87a0a88c36b09d194b295b8e","c011ea9b35b2109cfd21e1f06ce1d7f426600858","c35ad10e80acbd8f8f935691e0ec3263392273e2","2c128b798f23a37e8d6f484dc3fd821031d8dda8","d56ec0395479e86dd76757cd89986d21dce1a4ef"],"pdfUrls":["https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/047550D639F89EEB137FE61BA7C09DEF/S2398063X16000142a.pdf/when_to_consider_boosting_some_rules_for_policymakers.pdf","https://pure.mpg.de/rest/items/item_2492539_2/component/file_2495784/content"],"title":"When to consider boosting: some rules for policy-makers","doi":"10.1017/bpp.2016.14","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1017/bpp.2016.14","venue":""}

Extrapolations to zero ionic strength were used to determine the thermodynamic pK(a) values. Using this method the thermodynamic pK(a) values of 15 benzimidazoles were determined and found to range from 4.48 to 7.38. Results from the CE measurements were compared with spectrophotometric measurements which were evaluated at wavelengths where the highest absorbance difference for varying pH was recorded.

In order to explain the experiment it is, then, argued based on the work of Kondo and Yamaji that the density correlation of Br - atoms has large 4 k F -component, which leads to the commensurability pinning of the CDW through higher harmonics. This argument qualitatively explains the experimental data of the phonon gap and the pinning frequency at low temperatures.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Effects of Long-Range Coulomb Interaction and Br- Distribution on the Charge Density Wave and the Structural Change of KCP (K2Pt(CN)4Br0.3·3H2O)","doi":"10.1143/JPSJ.45.1266","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1143/JPSJ.45.1266","venue":""}

We have constructed a state-of- the-art time-resolved magneto-optic Kerr effect (TR-MOKE) apparatus for the observation of ultrafast demagnetization and precessional dynamics in ferromagnetic materials. Our system can operate well below the current ranges used by most researchers (typically in the region of 40 fs). Using current ultrafast optical methods of pulse compression, designed to obtain unprecedented temporal resolution, we have developed a dual-colour pump-probe technique: This enables us to attain an ultimate resolution in the 12 fs range, the spectral range being split between pump and probe beams. We have demonstrated that the system has the capacity for ultrafast demagnetization measurements using a GdFeCo thin film. Future developments will employ the full spectral range in both pump and probe branches to reach an expected temporal resolution in the vicinity of 6 fs, corresponding to few-cycle pulses.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Dynamic demagnetization in magnetic thin films using a new pump-probe system in the 6 femtosecond range","doi":"10.1117/12.2026215","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1117/12.2026215","venue":"Iberoamerican Meeting of Optics and the Latin American Meeting of Optics, Lasers and Their Applications"}

Several studies have demonstrated that the use of occlusal adjustment might prevent the development of TMD and the exacerbation of its symptoms. Since the aetiology of TMD is multiple, the prosthodontic treatment cannot always be sufficient, but tends to be effective in some cases. The present article describes a case of a complex prosthetic rehabilitation of a patient with TMD that originates from her previous prosthesis, resulting in reduced vertical dimension. Treatment included the registration of vertical and horizontal dimensions of occlusion by gothic arch (arrow-point) tracing. Degrees of the mandibular movement were recorded by digital axiograph (ARCUSdigma-KaVo) and transferred to a semi-adjustable articulator (KaVo Protar 5B). Appropriate vertical and horizontal occlusal dimensions and individual mandibular movements were then transferred to the final prosthesis.","inCitations":["31a1541f8c9908f2abcc6d0d1afca1907acf3f34","e8594a8cbe38eb8fe7bac749939528f2b42a62de"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"[Complex prosthetic rehabilitation of a patient with temporomandibular dysfunction.

We propose a model which can be used for such an analysis. Our framework for message passing is in many ways similar to the framework for transactional database systems. The abstract message passing system is defined in our framework independently of hardware, operating system and means of communication. The interface between the application and the message passing system consists of four basic abstract message passing operations. The application can be written in any programming language, provided that the application’s communication primitives can be translated into semantically equivalent sequences of the basic message passing operations. We prove that a restricted version of our model is as powerful as the unbounded asynchronous channel model. We also prove that MPI, the Message Passing Interface, is in some sense weaker than our restricted model and therefore also than the unbounded asynchronous channel model.","inCitations":["8fb08d1d3cf430ba2a7820a2ce0b01eb02dde112"],"pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1007/11611257_43","http://www.dcs.fmph.uniba.sk/~plachetk/PUBLICATIONS/sofsem2006.pdf"],"title":"Unifying Framework for Message Passing","doi":"10.1007/11611257_43","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/11611257_43","venue":"SOFSEM"}

However, in realistic situations the interacting objects are often embedded in an environmental medium. Such a solvent influences the induced dipole interaction. With the framework of macroscopic quantum electrodynamics, these interactions are mediated via an exchange of virtual photons. Via this method the impact of a homogeneous solvent medium can be expressed as local-field corrections leading to excess polarisabilities which have previously been derived for hard boundary conditions. In order to develop a more realistic description, we investigate on a one-dimensional analog system illustrating the influence of a continuous dielectric profile.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://arxiv-export-lb.library.cornell.edu/pdf/1906.01488","https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.01488v1.pdf"],"title":"Dispersion forces in inhomogeneous planarly layered media: A one-dimensional model for effective polarisabilities","doi":"10.1103/PhysRevA.99.062512","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevA.99.062512","venue":""}

Using Swedish data, this study shows that the first part of the hypothesis, that origin-country average rates of self-employment can be used to approximate individual experience, is false; but the second part, the connection between self-employment before and after migration, is true if the measurement is done on the individual level. Migrants who have been self-employed before migration accumulate entrepreneurial human capital, making future self-employment a more desirable labor market alternative vis-a-vis wage employment. But because of migrant selection, this association cannot be captured by aggregate measures, and this is the reason why the home-country self-employment hypothesis, although intuitive, has underperformed in previous empirical tests.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://www.sociologicalscience.com/download/vol-6/november/SocSci_v6_609to634.pdf"],"title":"Linking Self-Employment Before and After Migration: Migrant Selection and Human Capital","doi":"10.15195/v6.a23","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.15195/v6.a23","venue":""}

This study was aimed to examine the HRQoL of ethnic Chinese women with PCOS who received metformin treatment.MethodsThis prospective study was conducted at a medical center in Taiwan. Study participants aged 18–45 years were diagnosed as having PCOS according to the Rotterdam criteria, and all received metformin treatment. Their HRQoL was assessed using generic (WHOQOL-Bref) and PCOS-specific (Chi-PCOSQ) instruments. Mixed effect models were used to examine the effects of metformin on repeatedly measured HRQoL. Additional analyses using stratified patients characteristics (overweight vs. normal; hyperandrogenism vs. non-hyperandrogenism) were done.ResultsWe recruited 109 participants (56 % were overweight, 80 % had hyperandrogenism). Among the domain scores of WHOQOL-Bref, the psychological domain score was the lowest one (12.64 ± 2.2, range 4–20). Weight (3.25 ± 1.59, range 1–7) and infertility (3.38 ± 1.93, range 1–7) domain scores were relatively low among the domain scores of Chi-PCOSQ. Overweight and hyperandrogenic patients had significantly lower HRQoL as compared with those of normal weight and non-hyperandrogenic patients, respectively. Metformin significantly improved the physical domain of WHOQOL-Bref (p = 0.01), and the infertility (p = 0.043) and acne and hair loss aspects (p = 0.008) of PCOS-specific HRQoL. In the subgroup analysis, significantly improved HRQoL following metformin treatment appeared for only overweight and hyperandrogenism subgroups.ConclusionsMetformin might improve health-related quality of life of polycystic ovary syndrome women by ameliorating psychological disturbances due to acne, hair loss and infertility problems, especially for overweight and hyperandrogenic patients.","inCitations":["ccf0b5531c335cab4e9c2c823d13002eaf91fe2e","2463ff1faf1a16f46c0e7d39135b00cbc0c99a4d","9d3414f958ead73a7bedcca4be9e795cd5164d30","d44348c65d835e6c8ae22ddf825ece2f134c67fb","4c974ae90f55a5fb916356e8799446cd8bcc931b","237ec95f2a63076c5fb50cb3fc21073dd435fdda","f035e272d345e7cfd9d5c6e1ff36339a65297a79","742f8fc2474845ec1ee6ecb5c50f4e23aa13a381","0e4d99a2b7627f42e8b03f431c8210f34521f389","8d0ad8863c2dc8b93bc311cdff7aec0a519bf08d","2c1047aead6776f4ffc235c7b554b57c0076eeb0","cd9d65d32ea4e017c9563ae7614ba71a950a2ac9","15dbdef12b3895afa5621e8a82ad69fc7193270d","ff1b9ceaadd00348937bbfcc4d28ee308c35800e"],"pdfUrls":["https://hqlo.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s12955-016-0520-9","http://ir.lib.ncku.edu.tw/bitstream/987654321/177069/1/7014401000-000007.pdf"],"title":"Metformin improved health-related quality of life in ethnic Chinese women with polycystic ovary syndrome","doi":"10.1186/s12955-016-0520-9","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12955-016-0520-9","venue":"Health and Quality of Life Outcomes"}

The thermal conductive properties of graphene paper and its modified analogues were measured with a laser flash method. The thermal diffusivities of Mg-modified GP and Ca-modified GP are 1003.4 mm2/s and 2232.2 mm2/s, respectively, which is significantly improved compared with unmodified graphene paper (694.9 mm2/s). The corresponding thermal conductivities are 100.4 W/mK (GP), 147.7 W/mK (Mg-GP) and 331.8 W/mK (Ca-GP), respectively, from which a substantial enhancement in thermal conductivity of M-modified GP is also observed. It is found that the ion chelating between carboxyl groups of graphene oxide and alkaline earth metal ions will bridge the small graphene oxide sheets, and it will decrease the thermal resistance of the boundary and increase the contact surface of graphene sheets. The reduction of M-modified graphene oxide can partly recover the structure of graphene, thus can further improve the heat transfer property of graphene paper.","inCitations":["3a043e714e46a254f32234b5f7085bb708a1e7cf","c281e5c90051ba51253177cf011a59677fa8dbe7"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Modified graphene papers with alkaline earth metal ions endowed with high heat transfer properties","doi":"10.1016/j.tsf.2015.11.031","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tsf.2015.11.031","venue":""}

Trials have shown a plasma homocysteine raising effect of coffee. We determined the effect of a daily intake of 600 ml coffee and a supplementation of 200 microg folic acid or placebo on plasma homocysteine (tHcy) with respect to the MTHFR C677T and A1298C polymorphisms. One hundred and twenty healthy, non-smoking men (22%) and women (78%) aged 29-65 years, took part in a controlled, randomized, blinded study with two intervention periods: i) a coffee-free period of three weeks, ii) 600 ml coffee/day and a supplement of 200 microg folic acid/d or placebo for four weeks. The results showed that tHcy at baseline was significantly higher for the 677TT genotype group compared to the 677CC genotype group (p=0.0045) and that this group responded with significantly larger increase in tHcy upon coffee exposure than the 677CC and 677CT genotype groups (p=0.0045 and p=0.0041, respectively). Supplementation with 200 microg folic acid compared to placebo reduced the tHcy increasing effect of coffee in the 677TT genotype group. The A1298C polymorphism did not affect tHcy concentration significantly at any stage in the study. In conclusion, the homocysteine increasing effect of coffee is particularly seen in individuals with the homozygous 677TT genotype. Supplementation with 200 microg folic acid/d decreases this tHcy increment.","inCitations":["e0031cecb9d467ac993928b2a595ba836dad314c","bd1ff2f083f923be5c65f90b939b2a487a829fa0","d7553e4abe0b76fab860acc9962ce1f634b107f7","8ed981f6c37f01d2967d6ff1936b9a6ba808f4a6","2c17f60c121567cfb7b1f7da2d54980bf8e77026","696428630cc3e50b05b08f69643d0845542bf418","4b70ea9c3643d41a060664c5c44d37d74ca87fd4","b0ed794635024ef690c0ab7c87222943c395c0a2","35344b6920fd9d682c150c8bcfe3986f99ffff82","0fdf7f1c31a24ec7af8a3a35076a077e64a7fa99","044b1ec993723e0f7859c270d33fb888451b27f2","794526a12a21528e564cbb0a06fe5389f5d6a636","7faa2b105e39203f3aa8634066f15eacdc7dc4a6","b7212901009c431ca1ee84ceb1bbff8446e3d043","e9e8268413b602e8aaa3cfe6ab063d815b350792"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"The methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase C677T polymorphism is a major determinant of coffee-induced increase of plasma homocysteine: a randomized placebo controlled study.","doi":"10.3892/ijmm.13.6.811","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.3892/ijmm.13.6.811","venue":"International journal of molecular medicine"}

Differential Scanning Calorimetry measurements (DSC) were performed to determine glass transition temperatures (Tg) of specimens in a moisture content range of 2–25%. All materials are glassy at room temperature according to their Tg values regardless of their moisture content. Most specimens exhibit fragile behavior according to tensile tests, except for neat CS and CS-WPC-3%, with 25% moisture content, which display a fragile-ductile transition in the glassy state. Only small differences are observed among materials with different WPC contents, in terms of glass transition temperatures and mechanical properties. Nevertheless, our results indicate that WPC acts as a plasticizer for neat CS in terms of both, glass transition temperatures and mechanical behavior. Such plasticization effect is probably caused by Maillard reactions. Water, on the other hand, causes an anti-plasticization effect at low moisture contents, as revealed by increases in stress at break up to a maximum value. At higher moisture contents, water induces a plasticization effect and the stress at break decreases. Since no significant changes in strain at break are observed with moisture content, toughness values behave in a similar way to the stress at break exhibiting a maximum value at intermediate moisture contents.","inCitations":["cc31d0a470221cde1c794c6a8814428df7ebb46b"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Thermal and tensile properties of corn semolina-protein blends in the glassy state","doi":"10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2015.05.022","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2015.05.022","venue":""}

Background Ischemic strokes in the corpus callosum are rare. There is scant information in the literature about stroke mechanisms and functional outcomes in patients with acute ischemic strokes in the corpus callosum. Design/Methods: Retrospective chart review. The study was approved by our Institutional Review Board. Results: We identified 6 patients (1%) with acute ischemic strokes in the corpus callosum amongst consecutive strokes admitted to our stroke center between October 2010 and September 2011. Of them, 5 patients were female and 5 patients were African American. Mean age was 65 years (range 50 to 92 years). Hypertension was the most common stroke risk factor. On admission mean NIHSS score was 3 (range 1 to 6). Four patients had infarcts in the splenium, two in the genu, and one in the body of the corpus callosum confirmed with brain MRI. We found that all patients had large-artery atherosclerotic strokes using the TOAST classification after complete stroke work up including MR angiogram, echocardiogram and non-invasive cardiac monitoring during hospital stay. Mean modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score was 1 (range 0 to 2) at hospital discharge. Conclusions: Our study suggests that patients with ischemic strokes in the corpus callosum have favorable functional outcomes (mRS scores ≤ 2) in spite of the fact that all patients had large-artery atherosclerotic strokes.

Respondents were asked to identify the probability necessary for \"suspicion of child abuse\" to constitute reasonable suspicion. Data were analyzed for internal consistency, evidence of a group standard, and associations with professional and educational demographics. There was a 90.4% response rate (1,233/1,364). On both ordinal probability and estimated probability scales, respondents demonstrated wide variability in the thresholds they identified for what constitutes reasonable suspicion. Comparing individual responses for the two scales, 83% were inconsistent. Responses on the estimated probability scale were correlated with frequency of reporting child abuse, professional background, and prior education on child abuse. Lack of consensus in how community professionals interpret reasonable suspicion raises the question of whether more specific training is needed for this threshold to be understood, interpreted, and applied in a consistent manner.","inCitations":["5b06fd2d4251b082b3de73cf0c9f63eb665ccd41","be7d5e35c7d764aec1a8f414e2167d6dc3694ae1","022e45dab1e66c4acd9112a170e0bd51155a0699","bc9b4d66ead0e9ee9f7a080f7f8364f33d98d1eb","18acdf030a6472c6550e724346f07ae99684b13e","a7f7d1d747d57c7ed64e38b49322d20ba7be0a45","f5fa60b425bea765376cbc8b4a0030c5c754211d","4f80b6beadc8a15f13f0d26d8ff9bedf5af4c039","cd72d3714f5ec1784ebead2431b623c01c2a52ce"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Mandated reporting thresholds for community professionals.","doi":"","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"Child welfare"}

There has been extensive research addressing network effects such as the presence of multiple airports, sectors, and connectivity requirements in ATFM, but it has not explicitly incorporated the equitable distribution of delays, as well as work on the equitable distribution of delays in a single-airport setting, such as ration-by-schedule RBS as introduced under the collaborative decision-making paradigm. In this paper, we develop a two stage approach for network ATFM that incorporates fairness and airline collaboration. In Stage 1, we propose a discrete optimization model that attempts to incorporate an equitable distribution of delays among airlines by introducing a notion of fairness in network ATFM models-controlling the number of reversals and total amount of overtaking, which is a natural generalization of RBS. For two flights f and f', a reversal occurs when flight f' arrives before f, when f was scheduled to arrive before f'. In the event a reversal occurs, the number of time periods between the arrival times constitutes overtaking. In Stage 2, we allow for airline collaboration by proposing a network model for slot reallocation. We provide extensive empirical results of the proposed optimization models on national-scale, real-world data sets spanning six days that show interesting trade-offs between fairness and efficiency. We report computational times of less than 30 minutes for up to 25 airports and provide theoretical evidence that illuminates the strength of our approach.","inCitations":["d9309b602b469a1dca45d77d5cee461781a457f1","bb2ad97c218a49737559a575a9b80608c80877d7","d7e0ae0f4ea4d7cc3265d877f4cfd6f880615411","26613f7a2a13cc5430d2ab0fa83ee343e6c0beb3","c629da26bf1aa36536ebffcf2b3fda3743e447b9","65c9b58319d1fb4af54dca1cb144949db89b237d","64a02ca78d42c680d8e9bf87d8ef7b2c10d49344","2cb4391f810c128d2a459850c83a6a99de4a5fa2","99eb4d10df7c3acd023f03047d3b84f0217f8f9d","e8f408fcf45b8ea5151dd98a451ee1a01e109536","1edd6b4072d58bca87d40e32b3c2b521187cd629","d2c421b89699a92221cfc13e51786302c5189f1c","f078ab0b66104fdaad663d9d3c8b5ede0f20736e","9dab677134c953adb5635549c6d86ae05d369799","8b1a97f9f8c13f1654acf76df3f1500ec3c14098","df92cf7e65ff53b01e65606936b380227a00bbe6","16b5b6eef75229b4ce95e1ddaa2c0855071a5a1d","dc2258ebdccc226c6aaf5b9f9edd3aa073e9b818","a480d82131f241ec62ac4a941d2351a1a1580343","1ee1e2c3d593926069186899929c055805469251","5db1541355d0fdcec5876a9ee3d764c01898bf6f","1e231e4740b0a9c6d603820f047a0162ab7f4bde"],"pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1287/trsc.2014.0567"],"title":"Fairness and Collaboration in Network Air Traffic Flow Management: An Optimization Approach","doi":"10.1287/trsc.2014.0567","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1287/trsc.2014.0567","venue":"Transportation Science"}

There is a general agreement that innovation is a very important part of the puzzle in achieving long-term sustainability. Thus, a critical question to be answered is what factors actually differentiate, and appear to contribute to, sustainable innovations (SI) at the firm level. This paper addresses the question by examining empirical evidence from the IBEX 35 companies, from the years 2010–2015. Our results obtained from multivariate regression model indicate that the intensity of a firm’s SI activity is strongly and statistically significantly associated with the sector in which a given firm operates, with a rising level of environmental footprint acting as a stimulant for innovation. Additionally, firms characterized by higher net profit margins and returns on equity were also much more likely to introduce SIs. The findings also suggest that factors like size and age of a given company, as well as level of competition in a sector in which it operates are not significant predictors for the implementation of sustainable innovations. Overall, this study contributes to our understanding of the main characteristics of companies active in the area of SI.","inCitations":["75f03741be874e450677f957afc8653979f41a44","4215d4b65a658fdfcdc2dd27191a7e37040244b3","d404557bbbfac3df4de1eadc98d7cc7975aaf88d","ff7b2373c8a96f4e84e3bb422486e9ca76d60eab"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Sustainable innovations in the corporate sector – The empirical evidence from IBEX 35 firms","doi":"10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.05.087","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.05.087","venue":""}

Without treatment patients die within a median of 4–6 weeks due to progressive neurological deficit. Intraventricular chemotherapy with involved field RT is the standard treatment, but there is no clear evidence that such treatment improves outcome. Significant neurological complications occur in at least one third of the intensively treated patients. Because of disruption of the blood-brain barrier in LM, systemic therapy can also be effective. In non-controlled studies and in a randomised trial in patients with LM from breast cancer it was demonstrated that addition of intraventricular chemotherapy to systemic treatment and involved field radiotherapy did not improve outcome, but on the other hand adversely affected quality of life by its neurotoxicity. So, the value of intraventricular chemotherapy as the standard treatment of leptomeningeal metastases in patients with solid tumours still needs to be demonstrated.","inCitations":["ce862e92949b0581d20e14703f9e8981c9fe2bc9","d47c36f5a3c622b90fab865c076114ea9aefeee0"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Leptomeningeal metastasis in solid tumours: Is there a role for intrathecal therapy?","doi":"10.1016/S1359-6349(07)70022-8","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/S1359-6349%2807%2970022-8","venue":""}

A total of nine beam specimens with dimensions of 330mm x 180mm x 1500mm were made and tested under monotonic loading until failure loads with three variations of stirrup, where each variation was made of three beam specimens and four concrete cylinders. The concrete was a ready mix concrete with an average compressive strength of 22,875 kN at 28 days. Beams were tested on simply supported with two concentrated loads at a distance of 500 mm from each support. The loads was applied incrementally and the middle span deflections were recorded for each increase in loads. The test results show that the stirrups of WWF M4 grid on beam specimens can increase the shear capacity, stiffness and control the occurrence of the first inclined crack. When compared to conventional stirrups (BJTP ∅ 6mm), beams with WWF M4 stirrups show better behavior.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Perilaku Runtuh Balok Beton Bertulang dengan Sengkang Welded Wire Fabric (WWF)","doi":"10.14710/mkts.v25i1.20394","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.14710/mkts.v25i1.20394","venue":""}

This activity represents one of the least prevalent but also most feared online risks for youth. Due to the low number of youth experiencing upsetting meetings and the dominance of quantitative research designs in the area, the current state of knowledge does not provide a clear view of what happens at meetings that youths find upsetting. The aim of the present study is to enrich knowledge in this area by exploring such upsetting experiences in more depth by using qualitative methodology. Based on 14 interviews with Czech girls aged 15 to 18, who reported upsetting meetings with online strangers, the study identifies the discrepancy between expectations and reality as the core reason for these negative feelings. There were several reasons for this discrepancy: different developmental phases, related different experiences with romantic relationships, and exaggeration of impressions formed online.","inCitations":["008dca292fb34bbffddfb8e04439fa1838dee998","736994d15ba64075cd8db746d32905cfb143f3b4","b4b5d207e723077e228f6eecfa3dd038ecf52eba"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Meeting online strangers offline: The nature of upsetting experiences of adolescent girls","doi":"10.1515/commun-2014-0115","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1515/commun-2014-0115","venue":""}

Originally identified mostly in hematologic malignancies (e.g. BCR-ABL1 in CML), over the last years fusion genes have been shown to occur in practically all types of cancers examined. Some of the best known examples of these are ETS-family gene fusions (e.g. TMPRSS2-ERG) in prostate cancer and EML4-ALK fusions in non-small cell lung cancer. Although the prevalence of a specific gene fusion in a single cancer is often low, the example of treating e.g. EML4-ALK fusion positive NSCLC cancers with ALK inhibitors, such as crizotinib and ceritinib, has shown gene fusions to have significant value as targets of drug development. In this study, we describe a comprehensive survey of gene fusions in 7428 cancer samples from 27 different cancer types, using paired-end RNA-seq data created by the TCGA project. At least one fusion gene was identified in 3801/7428 samples, with over 9000 genes taking part in a total of ∼11000 fusion gene events. The number of gene fusions per tumor is highly variable, with the largest number of fusions typically identified in tumors with high level amplifications. This suggests many of the fusion genes identified here may arise as byproducts of amplicon formation, making them likely passenger events. Several potentially targetable genes take part in gene fusions across different cancer types. For instance, we identified a total of 12 gene fusions involving ALK in 5 different cancer types. Strikingly, only 5 of these involve EML4 as 59 partner gene. NTRK fusions were identified in 24 samples from 9 cancer types, FGFR fusions in 39 samples from 14 cancer types and MAST family kinase fusions in 14 samples from 7 cancer types. In summary, our analysis of fusion gene occurrence across a wide variety of cancer types identifies several interesting and potentially targetable gene fusions. Furthermore, it illustrates that many of these are found across several different cancer types, as well as involve a large number of different fusion partner genes, suggesting this may need to be taken into account in diagnostics of fusion genes as well as selection of patients for clinical trials.
