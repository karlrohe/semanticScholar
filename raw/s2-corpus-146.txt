A close correlation was found between various direct extraction methods all using phosphate, though the turbidimetric method of analysis appeared to overestimate soil S values. Extractions following short term incubation with cysteine correlated significantly with direct extraction methods indicating that the soil sulphate pool is directly related to the soil's ability to mineralize readily available organic S. In contrast, incubation with elemental S gave no correlation. A respirometric method following amendment with cellulose gave only a poor correlation with two other methods. A Neubauer plant bioassay was most closely correlated to Ca (H2PO4)2‐extractable S, CaCl2‐extractable S and to extractable S following incubation with cysteine. The value of the various methods for routine use is discussed.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Comparison of methods to evaluate the sulphur status of soils","doi":"10.1080/00103628909368186","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1080/00103628909368186","venue":""}

This paper studies the impact of H<sub>Fin</sub> and W<sub>Fin</sub> variations on various performance matrices including static as well as dynamic figures of merit (FOMs). With the help of aspect ratio (W<sub>Fin</sub>/H<sub>Fin</sub>), the device is branched into three parts, i.e., FinFET, Trigate, and Planar MOSFET. This unique report is a presentation of a detailed analysis about the impact of fin height (H<sub>Fin</sub>) and width (W<sub>Fin</sub>) on various performances including the dc as well as ac FOMs. The static or low-frequency performances like threshold voltage (V<sub>th</sub>), on current (I<sub>on</sub>), off current (I<sub>off</sub> ), power dissipation, transconductance (g<sub>m</sub>), output conductance (g<sub>d</sub>), transconductance generation factor (TGF = g<sub>m</sub> /I<sub>D</sub>), early voltage (V<sub>EA</sub>), gain (A<sub>V</sub>), and dynamic or high-frequency performances as gate capacitance (C<sub>gg</sub>), cutoff frequency (f<sub>T</sub>), output resistance (R<sub>0</sub>), intrinsic delay are systematically presented with the variation of device geometry parameters. The results presented in this paper can be of great help to device engineers in designing 3-D devices as per their requirement.","inCitations":["3acde901fa988fb9578aacecc6ae010ecca51c55","9218548db01827cf056aa01b6f8d19825e0a9178","05787636081f5b364a78f111482d19273131e8d2","fdefd6c77933574575eac2a446021b5ac6375c7c","714282e4c3b1d291d4af7ac64661064b55fb6871","ce7e9a83d7f1fc9cc2f8206318f5dc43c116dc35","4633026eeeba7340ebe7090eb7e1db316e772096","9ab1e93b2cec7637733fcbbce095392db422672e","94ba4e853dd8b6c3b35d4bcb49a1573a7496a8ed","b4064a4d3cee19ed5a3a1fa065311f6f724f0392","747016aa9031464756880d17c7c95d5e8f116e13","420ada082faec39d571a14890bfb50f225f56627","203ed89d26dd123fb79b292c9b8f878b9665b63e","08110765ea8c606af2dddd877ee0ebf27b5a0a5b","dcea37be8b9d9a04b02355a0dcd93d0b52a50e5c","d0bbf221bbb11bfdb9a50703d69bcdf552a6f194","3355139f8b0a351bd6425067dbf45d3d17fe8ed6","7ba183cafa4bf1e4800ece56af5d3dcd441bedf9","fc2a685ed07b7246bcf3991f84256873a08d69d6","72fca06a3b509fee27f0c842cb104223272453b3","da45e36ab041e51843de06c1ae2887c5ad2bc067","4aed8175750e49a8c4f1525e61dc8409603383f4","c749603944fd73619539186871729b50afeabaeb","ecf8a0cad6619433d622eccb5d783f1626614d33","20abb59228b773bf3c730a4472d4b582b7fe129f"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"The Role of Geometry Parameters and Fin Aspect Ratio of Sub-20nm SOI-FinFET: An Analysis Towards Analog and RF Circuit Design","doi":"10.1109/TNANO.2015.2415555","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNANO.2015.2415555","venue":"IEEE Transactions on Nanotechnology"}

Despite the new law and other measures of increased surveillance, the sexual crimes against women continue and have increased. This paper is based on a larger study carried out in Delhi, among the school and college students and also slum locality to understand their perceptions and experiences of safe and unsafe spaces in the city. There are differential experiences of the respondents depending on the geographical location, and the class they belong to. For majority sexual violence in some form is very common in their everyday life experience and for some definitely in memory. Patriarchal norms and misogynist culture makes a woman risk violence every day from harassment of eve-teasing to extreme forms of violence, like acid throwing and rape.

In this paper, we are going to discuss the phenomenon of Dystopia in Modern Literature based on the critical heritage of modern social theory and philosophy (Frankfurt School, Walter Benjamin, Giorgio Agamben). Where does appear the differences between Utopia and Dystopia? Are the fictional Worlds of More, Campanella and Bacon entirely different than the dark illustrations by Orwell, Bradbury, Zamiatin and Huxley? Is there something common inside the imaginary “mechanisms” of utopian and dystopian fictions?

To prepare a contig pool, approximately 9300 cosmid clones randomly selected from the library were fingerprinted and automatically assembled into 467 overlapping sets by the fluorescence-tagged restriction fragment method. The average size of the overlapping sets was 9.5 cosmids with minimal tiling paths consisting of 5.4 cosmids with a 10-kb extension each. However, as many as 10% of overlaps within members were estimated to be false. For regional localization, we hybridized gridded arrays of cosmids with inter-Alu-PCR probes obtained from YAC clones and somatic cell hybrids and assigned 592 cosmids to 26 subregions of 21q. Of these, 371 clones were incorporated into 139 contigs, anchoring the total 1864 cosmids to the subregion. The remaining 221 clones were mapped as orphans. To correlate the cytogenetic, YAC, and cosmid maps on 21q, the translocation breakpoints of the chromosomes contained in the somatic cell hybrids were mapped with respect to the STS content of the YACs. From the gene cluster regions, 176 ribosomal and 25 alphoid clones were isolated by hybridization. Together, these sets of anchored contigs and cosmids will provide a valuable resource for construction of a high-resolution map and for isolation of genes of interest from chromosome 21.","inCitations":["2ee793f016a8eec6d5b4d36d0aff6f7a5c6785a3","6ba4832c7c3bdfeed4baae4a99dd288f99ee1585","a8d89f38448617a2c7a5774d6caa4f3a00df87a3","52e084a869dd337c2a8981b8df7de196a8042160","92d02b6f0a2e7e74238d4309ae27fd6f9a107dbb","b7f2111802358d7165cdf922d61491973cfb1817","a7ea360dfef4742bb4c2fd5a78850e05bc92c617","8f6e069f0034aaa82e6936f071d37f7663d031c4","7630a95a4b70a76fdb4df0dffe2b17a8abcfe8c4","b25b81bedc11c32d009586e2e1acdfa94131e9ae","776eeaacb32000a5745789bdf8b4761bfe307746","2171e45bf83c093713bfbce6fe176d1c5587f635","eacf58467b4484a3e330671e4adf0bb324544251","227b75c9af6a53e103dbaab69ee1de808a5796dd","968352eb747940187be9a2279f68cff215bd2e0f","29ca92b8c9e82199cc2b331786ddbff902fda8c9","736d5c0a3bf11649abaf2438b5a0e5ca5e7f232c","1bb7125cc08f7cf91072eb6ee39fddc1b8b43f67"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Cosmid assembly and anchoring to human chromosome 21.","doi":"10.1016/0888-7543(95)80111-X","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/0888-7543%2895%2980111-X","venue":"Genomics"}

Colostrum gradually changes to mature milk over the next several days. The role of colostrum in fighting infections and promoting growth and development of the newborn is widely acknowledged. This role is mediated by differences across cultures in the acceptability of colostrum and the prevalence of colostrum feeding. This study examined the prevalence of colostrum feeding and time to initiation of breast-feeding in 143 rural Bangladeshi women in Matlab thana. Structured interviews were collected during a 9-month prospective study conducted in 1993. Women were usually interviewed within 4 days of giving birth and were asked about whether or not they fed their child colostrum and the number of hours until they began breast-feeding the baby. Ninety per cent of the mothers reported feeding their newborn colostrum. A logistic regression found no effect on the prevalence of colostrum feeding from the following covariates: mother's age, parity, history of pregnancy loss, child's sex, mother's self-report of delivery complications, and the time from birth to interview. Fifty-nine per cent of mothers initiated breast-feeding within 4 h, and 88% within 12 h of parturition. Survival analysis was used to estimate the effects of covariates on the time from delivery to initial breast-feeding. Time to initial breast-feeding was delayed slightly, but significantly, for older mothers, for male infants, and by mothers who did not report delivery complications. The percentage of mothers who fed their child colostrum was higher, and times to initial breast-feeding were shorter, than almost all previous reports from South Asia. These findings might be explained, in part, by methodological differences among studies, but it is suggested that recent changes towards earlier initiation of breast-feeding have taken place in rural Bangladesh.","inCitations":["5bd0e976bc44ecb1244d4ef539aac9540b6641af","6b07274a09a5269e6be9d8ee1011884f26e524ef","b3e5c2f3e98dd409e86bd20fdc2b4b6335bf1862","ff22af093bf41394bb148d2406ae39e58d376216","3f995c53a1b4fc40d8c71e501601a27a08433db3","0183e859660b0b2d1d87d1cca8765d31db1936e8","2c936876c097d262dc6d9148117d98b20b77baa2","8b099bd583e97039be3a01af21e5e4532ede5c41","7ab2065a81f0c153358b00b4057238ab2b6656f8","2d32bc3e96dbcd4de17d5dae3cc48466d970933c","794ee940aded74f7e259e44e396e6a411009a58b","ea8d556fae0ca97bbf5c849fbce31ec86044a409","d92cc746b02f16727ba3ac562ae0bbcf1dd32d10","9658d9505024891f7b41961b280110e41f87de3b","b52ee6d6c12586afa07aadb61b384053debf469f","3906f6c5e46663b6d169c6e159c91bbacf82bc21","036809451cafe6b647977e353098c2c3ca03ed28","1aed93a6ce42d5c4db429849a48a7ace97f2a24e","7327f8a370801653bf1a65b154a99611af36242d"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Colostrum feeding behaviour and initiation of breast-feeding in rural Bangladesh.","doi":"10.1017/S0021932001001390","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1017/S0021932001001390","venue":"Journal of biosocial science"}

He saw that the two cultures shared a solar theology expressed via similar iconographical schemes, such as the heraldic arrangement of lions on either side of a column and the astral associations of the goddess known to the Egyptians as Taweret and transmuted by the Minoans into leonine “genii.” Evans’ solar theory was not systematically developed and has scarcely been considered since. Yet it is worth reviving in view of recent finds, especially the excavations of Manfred Bietak at Tell el Dab’a, which prove that contact between the royal courts of Egypt and Crete was close indeed.

This study investigates how differences in the use of online health information and social media affect the use of online health services. We attempt to predict the extent to which the use of social media and online health information prompt individuals to use online health services. We draw upon a combination of sociology and communication studies and integrate relational maintenance assumptions regarding the quality of online social relationships to promote the importance of health empowerment factors-socio-demographic characteristics, internet attitudes and health status models to predict the likelihood of using online health services. The study's sample consists of 1406 individuals using the Internet, including 633 individuals using the Internet and social media to look for health information. The study's results provide evidence that (a) online health information empowers most of the examined individuals to use online health services; (b) among all social media only those that offer consulting have a significant effect on the likelihood of using online health services. The implications of these findings support that a conceptual integration of CMC and social media use theories along with health empowerment assumptions, is a promising theoretical framework to test the effectiveness of social media use in prompting use of online health services. The practical applications for health management are highlighted as well. Finding practical and affordable ways to support the use of social media and encourage access to online health information and use of online health services could improve health literacy and self-management of health at the individual level and increase the efficiency in the provision of health services at the institutional level.","inCitations":["2836d8236b7d1c292b191eb70e2949f851644b56","7d396d353b99aa6bd34a5ba9b62944ffca400c49","dda8e8050b265ade4dae25b97cc483ac5061e699","788160b2847e3a2a4df54d5d21bb4c348e6e599a","bee9726771ec293963a6e9becb879716ef2beee2","2c58b6315d8b17d3a7319654c73cb22ad57d31f5","06767a5d1075f21630384b1b51c342b165ebf60a","575a0edeb85b5a0d553d2d856bc6a1427856454e","6e049b3bc15f00dd9eddf3e864663bdec7f67051","e628c6e1fb7a669e207401ade56d9f5e261372a8","dfe6e3be2d555edd5e374f2beb061ed0908edce1","9faa84608a89df242d5e93ef06b04ab5c0c1412d","628202073061c90714d006640b558ffe4a810255","5a964460d05681c9488974ef56ec9004ecd73529","f80eb1b9f7a0c7dbdd8f5314bc922bc3725e8b9c","57ecd37687ddc07f12f881aa2f243ac7494263e9","cbd46f9a41b18a7a6e2895bb8c34a1f4d43b1886","222724c44345a86eacb2b4165388ed7a66e71b38","5ad2070a34fae47476509f13d37adb40a3258e6d","0c5719e53b763f3a06c48bbe6a94cc9602546741","9e62c44ff3a2b5e21822b8bcebea1d2e25967886","b5c06207d8330050a3a8843721bca94037b622ff","30a93a870339555d95ed32a74ced9f0bde6f2097","e2f32f6537ad76b7fa0319c70621e9802cdd0a3c","358b45abcd86f43c16a2b0fe4c7e5f89b058dbc5","c50f6bcb0285727ebb22a261e2221d1cb8646064","448c43a0f79fce17d99229b483734087e03542ec","5ab08718d1e6733e963f4b31d0e9328bb5050986"],"pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chb.2014.07.032"],"title":"Social media and online health services: A health empowerment perspective to online health information","doi":"10.1016/j.chb.2014.07.032","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chb.2014.07.032","venue":"Comput.

A user-friendly, interactive, multispectral image-processing capability is, therefore, required to accommodate the needs of the practicing cytologist. This paper describes a system design for a high-speed, microscopic, multispectral image analysis that provides a natural user-friendly environment for the cytologist. The speed limitations of conventional image processors are overcome by employing multiple processors in a high-speed, highly parallel-pipelined architecture. Preliminary results obtained using a prototype system for interactive ploidy determination will be presented. Software now under development will address a broad range of quantitative cytology problems utilizing the system's capability to measure a wide variety of cytomorphic properties in apparent real time.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"High performance pathology workstation using an automated multispectral microscope.","doi":"10.1364/AO.26.003294","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1364/AO.26.003294","venue":"Applied optics"}

CLAW-FREE VERTEX DELETION (CFVD) consists of determining the minimum number of vertices to be removed from a graph such that the resulting graph is claw-free. Although CFVD is NP-complete in general and recognizing claw-free graphs is still a challenge, where the current best algorithm for a graph $G$ has the same running time of the best algorithm for matrix multiplication, we present linear-time algorithms for CFVD on weighted block graphs and weighted graphs with bounded treewidth. Furthermore, we show that this problem can be solved in linear time by a simpler algorithm on forests, and we determine the exact values for full $k$-ary trees. On the other hand, we show that CLAW-FREE VERTEX DELETION is NP-complete even when the input graph is a split graph. We also show that the problem is hard to approximate within any constant factor better than $2$, assuming the Unique Games Conjecture.","inCitations":["9f5dae3088e2513b3924f489a642804eb83de36f"],"pdfUrls":["https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.05672v1.pdf","https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.05672"],"title":"Linear-time Algorithms for Eliminating Claws in Graphs","doi":"","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"ArXiv"}

African Americans are disproportionately underrepresented in HIV clinical trials.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA 49-item survey was administered to 145 patients at an urban HIV clinic to explore race and HIV clinical trial participation.\n\n\nRESULTS\nStudy participants were 56% Caucasian, 19% other, 16% African American, and 13% Hispanic. Fewer African Americans had been asked to participate in a trial compared to other groups (8% vs. 24%) (p < .05). African Americans were less likely to volunteer for a trial compared to Hispanics and Caucasians, but African Americans did not differ significantly in their willingness participate in clinical trials vs. other racial groups. In a regression model age, past trial participation, monetary gain, and comfort with the clinical setting predicted willingness to participate in a trial across racial groups (p < .05).\n\n\nDISCUSSION\nThere is a strong need to identify strategies to increase African American enrollment in trials. Such strategies need to begin with trial recruiters actively seeking out African Americans for clinical trial enrollment.","inCitations":["da381dac9ceb587e485e87cd656ab66772d70b69","d6177542790d21efcd1ac47860262aedea0c15b7","072b6bbfce5936e2b8d06c09c3efa16e3a6df800","4ebf62fcc2a4ee86f0cc65b62af39a62c56dca16","1fffddf6bc593e36ca1ac0b0b37924fe839cbeb1","10abf83afd9a83558a74a0aed569601e6f7fa21a","1e3782338c3bccbcd7d0f4cc66dbad5909253d71","b2495b45c1ffc825f56aad233870d7ccf5e30aeb","488c0fe96b3ccb559433df74bb13bafa94d68a13","18067eca0ba896be9eb9a2781e87f8163add2733","c4958db569590d65e27aeef23be25946afe65c16","5c18df7f7d2f7a0aecbd0db9c1507d369c99778e"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Race and HIV clinical trial participation.","doi":"10.1016/S0027-9684(15)30558-7","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/S0027-9684%2815%2930558-7","venue":"Journal of the National Medical Association"}

Dynamic re-configurability is thereby introduced into the optical MFH topology, while maintaining back-compatibility with legacy fiber deployments. 10 Gb/s peak rates with <7 μs back-to-back transmission latency and 29.6 dB total power budget are experimentally demonstrated, confirming the attractiveness of the new approach for optical MFH of future 5G mobile systems.","inCitations":["64c5ccaba48251e9804a3573e10542c86fec7a0b","8b9644c72c191e0152d29c1bac5ac720d8597a56","5ff446086eb0bbe6bcc22fbd070c7b0d5f3882ed","922c9c29e0cc701a58f89c04b3763219a97306ca","81d4849caeae04a829c8a3f9089297a1161c560c","01240189620e544b92162d7dd00e9a64a2ecf1b9","1052aa946f300b5dd896ce9e703c87f800410bf8","9257f67e59a67241b00a2ea7090f114090d69fc8","4e7957468f869f7d063bdf78bd10264a307e767b","b4d99ee6424a6e9b1c00361b47b538771ff6a1d7","704a76b1d8fcd870076ef363dede8b4965fc5540","6a3aed2838baa032f8420b0546d0c65ee3453559","b5733c033230abb21a78c249b731a5fe2c570380","7efb7ac00838892c5e6c8f7b5500410516490966","4fc5374cbb49a47e342f20cbb03817497738788c","94dbba48bf585ffbe0fdc3973518664348fc3b5e","2ea64fa9b4f0816043d8f8da7bbe985134928d68","f4f63e09a8e70a78cea8237183a405c6061c18e1","77bfff47fc293932452f0758254d108e9ceb9bee","4bf7a789a0e4c432e97131bc2e98a4052f5c5455","c5b9bce9d79ff43e66ac620bb68b7a6020b6330d","65766af5c39fa3af8843824678d1f1e05a1304c6","3dda552a775c80dcbfe930abaf528ef930e7d486","6677ab407168f3e4e1c6bf07731bd7971e00c2d4","7733ab3feb9e58c15c238a13d7a8451a405a3cda","a15da048d5f33cd8a267605752847b285b7f91e6","154f2eda3dc959bd54febfd9f581a3276282e452","52466b5699e3c8ab9756ae9e52f150080ef250aa","445c4e97bf398353225b792e1835d0d371da8ff2","25e53c9bc347792eb2882fc8ecd6a40c38a23f84","179fc8d32f5f5736ae4ce19b0c2b11618b0c621e","c6ca29f13aa992c3e31e8c54b5f03b78ca5617ac"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"SDN-controlled topology-reconfigurable optical mobile fronthaul architecture for bidirectional CoMP and low latency inter-cell D2D in the 5G mobile era.","doi":"10.1364/OE.22.020809","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1364/OE.22.020809","venue":"Optics express"}

It argues that nutrition and health are important factors in determining educational outcomes and, as such, should figure prominently in efforts to improve the quality of education and the teachability of children. Educational planners have perhaps too often tended to neglect nutrition/health as a crucial aspect in schooling and the learning process. Four nutrition conditions, hunger, intestinal helminth infections, schistosomiasis and lead intoxication are reviewed. These nutrition and health problems are affecting school-age children throughout the world.

The ionic conditions for stability of the enzyme during prolonged centrifugation were determined as well as those for the recovery of a tRNA-enzyme complex. A stable complex of transformylase and Met-tRNA fMet with an S 20,W value of 5.5 s was identified. Formyl-Met-tRNA fMet could substitute for Met-tRNA fMet but neither non-acylated tRNA fMet nor the aminoacyl forms of a series of other tRNA's formed a stable complex with the transformylase. Approximately 1 molecule of Met-tRNA fMet or fMet-tRNA fMet was bound to 1 molecule of transformylase. The effects of variation in temperature, pH, divalent ion concentration and ionic strength were studied on complex formation. In the pH range of 5.0 to 6.0, there was an apparent increased efficiency of binding of the enzyme to fMet-tRNA fMet which was due to aggregation of enzyme to enzyme-tRNA complexes. A similar effect was observed at low ionic strengths. The stable complex formation of transformylase and the acyl-tRNA fMet species affords a means of studying the recognition portion of the over-all transformylase reaction.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Formymethionyl transfer ribonucleic acid transformylase: the specific interaction of the enzyme with its transfer ribonucleic acid substrate.","doi":"10.1016/0022-2836(71)90308-1","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/0022-2836%2871%2990308-1","venue":"Journal of molecular biology"}

They are potent contact allergens and known to cause respiratory hypersensitivity and asthma. Here we study ethyl 2-cyanoacrylate (ECA), methyl methacrylate (MMA) and 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA). There are only limited possibilities to measure the exposure to acrylates, especially for biological monitoring. The aim of the present study was to investigate the chemical structures of adducts formed after reaction of hemoglobin (Hb) with ECA, MMA, and HEMA. This information may be used to identify adducted Hb peptides for biological monitoring of exposure to acrylates. Hb-conjugates with ECA, MMA, and HEMA were synthesized in vitro. The conjugates were digested by trypsin and pronase E. Adducted peptides were characterized and analyzed by liquid chromatography and nano electro spray/hybrid quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MS) as well as tandem quadrupole MS. The search for the adducted peptides was facilitated by visualizing the MS data by different computer programs. The results showed that ECA binds covalently to cysteines at the 104 position in the α and the position 112 in the β-chains in Hb. MMA and HEMA bound to all the cysteines in both chains, Cys(104) in the α-chain and Cys(93) and 112 in the β-chain. The full-length spectra of in un-digested Hb confirmed this binding pattern. There was no reaction with N-acetyl-L-lysine at physiological pH. The adducted peptides were possible to measure using LC/MS/MS in selected reaction monitoring mode. These peptides may be used for biological monitoring of exposure to ECA, MMA and HEMA.","inCitations":["9ef65e24fe36da919925966f4f6add0fc6fcd41d"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Identification of covalent binding sites of ethyl 2-cyanoacrylate, methyl methacrylate and 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate in human hemoglobin using LC/MS/MS techniques.","doi":"10.1016/j.jchromb.2010.04.026","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jchromb.2010.04.026","venue":"Journal of chromatography.

It is well known that children in the better developed countries are growing more rapidly and there is some evidence from Scandinavia that the final heights may be increasing (Cuthbertson, 1958). The adolescent spurt, as determined by the onset of the menarche in girls and the growth spurt in both sexes, is occurring earlier. Part of it is undoubtedly due to better nutrition-gone are bow and knock knees. Regardless of the doubtful desirability of greater height for all per se, it is a factspeaking statistically of populations-that a suboptimal diet cannot be improved without a corresponding increase in the rate of growth and maturation. Conversely, poorer nutrition will be reflected in a slowing of these characteristics. So long as the mothers’ milk supply is adequate in these poorer communities the children grow as rapidly as those of well-nourished communities. It is after weaning that growth and maturation are markedly slowed down in the former. In our discussions we should probably eliminate such ill-defined terms as ‘optimal requirements’ but describe those requirements which suffice to cover all the current needs of healthy children and enable them to meet both the common and the rare stresses of daily life and fulfil their genetic potential in these respects, as physiological requirements. The protein intake of a breast-fed infant is 2-0--2.5 g/kg daily, but mixtures based on cow’s milk commonly provide 3-4 g/kg and there is much controversy as to which level is more satisfactory; and if we consider the mineral intake there is roughly the same degree of difference. This difference is bound up with the widely different growth rates of the calf and the human baby. Holt (1959) has suggested that the only way to find out the better system for the human infant would be to compare the different regimes with the ability to withstand the challenges to which the child is subject, both in infancy and later life, which has never been done.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/S0029665163000306"],"title":"Nutritional problems in infancy and childhood 123","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

There were no significant differences in any of the Doppler recordings relative to baseline values after plain bupivacaine, but after bupivacaine with adrenaline there were significantly increased blood flow velocity indices for the maternal uterine and placental arcuate arteries and significantly decreased indices in the fetal renal and middle cerebral arteries. Neonatal outcome as evaluated by Apgar scores and acid-base values in the umbilical cord were similar in the two groups. The results suggest that adrenaline added to the solution of bupivacaine increased vascular resistance in the uteroplacental circulation, indicating impaired blood flow.","inCitations":["c402cffa7d61380425ac44f065af80bbe0ac55c5","8cf2cbd6b0a9dbee543ca8658a97808744b6ba76","c6dd3edc1922051701cd5d403368558727e793a2","b5ffa4d5d6784ae4394349fc95ca4d7dbf4267c3","74ad10d6d6e0b6e70c4e43e7d9bac14bdb137d57","6abee523d4338d175c34f2bcca0c64f19216104d","706d8f82018005639fade95a808f561ce38b9129"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Uteroplacental and fetal circulation during extradural bupivacaine-adrenaline and bupivacaine for caesarean section in hypertensive pregnancies with chronic fetal asphyxia.","doi":"10.1093/bja/71.3.348","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1093/bja%2F71.3.348","venue":"British journal of anaesthesia"}

The timely and accurate estimation of impacts and damages is essential to better understand disaster conditions and to support emergency response operations. Geo-information drawn from various sources at multi spatial-temporal scales can be used for disaster assessments through a synthesis of hazard, exposure, and post disaster information based on pertinent approaches. Along with the increased availability of open sourced data and cooperation initiatives, more global scale geo-information, including global land cover datasets, has been produced and can be integrated with other information for disaster dynamic damage assessment (e.g., impact estimation immediately after a disaster occurs, physical damage assessment during the emergency response stage, and comprehensive assessment following an emergency response). Residential areas and arable lands affected by the flood disaster occurring from July to August 2015 in Myanmar were assessed based on satellite images, GlobeLand30 data, and other global open sourced information as a study case. The results show that integrating global open geo-information could serve as a practical and efficient means of assessing damage resulting from major disasters worldwide, especially at the early emergency response stage.","inCitations":["f9476146346ed8bc15af852fbab297200739a323","2700acf7084bca5cfc0273c3244f05fe73f7f2f7","60f42c19d23c0e6f9dee66da399b22b9154f21fe","90685cbd6decc6d7888131625be580e9c4fa743d","6b9f26445f5620746689b91ab451f997b391724c"],"pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.3390/ijgi6070201","https://res.mdpi.com/ijgi/ijgi-06-00201/article_deploy/ijgi-06-00201.pdf?attachment=1&filename="],"title":"Integrating Global Open Geo-Information for Major Disaster Assessment: A Case Study of the Myanmar Flood","doi":"10.3390/ijgi6070201","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.3390/ijgi6070201","venue":"ISPRS Int.

These same risk factors are targeted by many universal substance misuse prevention programs. This study examined whether a multicomponent universal substance misuse intervention for middle schoolers reduced the associations between depressive symptoms, these risk factors, and substance misuse.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThe study used data from a place-randomized trial of the Promoting School-Community-University Partnerships to Enhance Resilience model for delivery of evidence-based substance misuse programs for middle schoolers. Three-level within-person regression models were applied to four waves of survey, and social network data from 636 adolescents followed from sixth through ninth grades.\n\n\nRESULTS\nWhen adolescents in control school districts had more symptoms of depression, they believed more strongly that substance use had social benefits, perceived higher levels of substance misuse among their peers and friends, and had more friends who misused substances, although they were not more likely to use substances themselves. Many of the positive associations of depressive symptoms with peer-related risk factors were significantly weaker or not present among adolescents in intervention school districts.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe Promoting School-Community-University Partnerships to Enhance Resilience interventions reduced the positive associations of adolescent symptoms of depression with peer-related risk factors for substance misuse.","inCitations":["280c5bc32055d7459ed515b078adf04ab2893754","7301c9ea264d8a9ba3aa565b84a05fc7a9aa921f"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Risk Factors for Substance Misuse and Adolescents' Symptoms of Depression.","doi":"10.1016/j.jadohealth.2016.08.010","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jadohealth.2016.08.010","venue":"The Journal of adolescent health : official publication of the Society for Adolescent Medicine"}

In the presence of target cocaine and detected aptamer probe, two fragments folded with cocaine and formed a sandwich complex on the electrode surface. Based on the difference binding ability of (Ru(NH3)6) 3 + to ss-DNA and sandwich complex, a simple and highly sensitive electrochemical method was developed for the determination of cocaine by detecting the charge of (Ru(NH3)6) 3+ adsorbed on the elec- trode surface by chronocoulometry. Under the optimized conditions, the charge response was linear with the concentration of cocaine from 1 µmol/L to 50 µmol/L. The detection limit was 0.1 µmol/L. The developed method allows the detection of cocaine in a serum sample with recovery in 96.4%~104%. This design strategy is easy to generalize for any aptamer without prior knowledge of its secondary or tertiary structure, and would be used as a simple, sensitive and general tool for biomolecule detection.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Label-free and Sandwich Aptamer-based Electrochemical Biosensor for the Determination of Cocaine","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Here, we demonstrate tapered nanowaveguides structured directly onto the diamond substrate hosting shallow-implanted nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers. By optimization based on simulations and precise experimental control of the geometry of these pillar-shaped nanowaveguides, we achieve a net photon flux up to ∼ 1.7 × 10(6) s(-1). This presents the brightest monolithic bulk diamond structure based on single NV centers so far. We observe no impact on excited state lifetime and electronic spin dephasing time (T2) due to the nanofabrication process. Possessing such high brightness with low background in addition to preserved spin quality, this geometry can improve the current nanomagnetometry sensitivity ∼ 5 times. In addition, it facilitates a wide range of diamond defects-based magnetometry applications. As a demonstration, we measure the temperature dependency of T1 relaxation time of a single shallow NV center electronic spin. We observe the two-phonon Raman process to be negligible in comparison to the dominant two-phonon Orbach process.","inCitations":["c0f6a82f24add9db7a56e03950eb66dc0c81f9d2","3c14e3f7c3554b711647f4d684b3429231d98e4e","0a79caca8289c143b0688876015188ee4a824da3","9bd025ac5ef2beae7233b6e90f5bf73c2f0a0cad","4f8fcf7c6f91a781a34032790151d6ceb394474a","45bfb1500ad28a06e25454578a2ee447acf94a25","b96f1d1b53566fe4688e1abb2fd86748f80b4841","adfea06485661dcaa3ea54fc6d7d37e34911966d","ab02ef7e80f0985e10f2c73354b889cb44a7eb4f","d8044676f4ebae32c755f78cd3a338c5a81bdf0d","51baf02f1a82750c9f0b5b2090feb1deab22a449","3622df18180559d9abfe9377e9e7be734eadc31e","45e2874fe9ad4311517443eb7c1f4f93a710096e","230ebef17d76c1455074a53548f4a12f2711e451","0a4d23e08f5515716908a595fedfc503056e3225","a18edd6f81c0bac3cc364890cc6b064659fcf881","0fe0f2747de40d8bfe754d333c7883247428603c","f82d584e4db60696d05808b8a5c34e9a86755c21","0f0a6911237d8ce1dc6261824b5b035b245b6101","fdf8b2ba29834d467ba6b9ff2db91e02f9ec3a55","440bf8897bba0582bb8e61e3da553798b9b390a0","da3d380ffc36c6ba6d18d074712542069ffbfdb7","9a7e4176f2db3ee795a8c93622647ba9284b9097","66fc4192193c3d6a756e298510398dda4db0bf77","b63977c16c17e5dad818e9a2a7df73f23d6c495a","eab81ef41cb78c9096fe77741bc7e4e4e0dfa644","d8aae60ae6872d0ca12e52c5eecdc013507f254b","9205ebdb02551baf95ff9a1bb205092dad9813c6","a7250d882e921f7a524891252b50515d57b7bb50","959a15f0dbb31305ea1d6f7d3d1d9a432bead205","087b1f82311ea85f28a159c139ebfdcaf800d2ce","a9ce06e9a8dc1120cf0e1dff461a22cb0eebd0cb","f99922a1a2c2ef4b355536fa50e2a049cac36696","02ae3ec60376435b586aec7681ed1abf15cec8db","df786114624a29c55d74c2f13f0bbee55ed8cf23","c0f94d497df25e8e3e31566c9482ba7e0e250fab"],"pdfUrls":["https://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.0027v2.pdf","https://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.0027.pdf"],"title":"Nanoengineered diamond waveguide as a robust bright platform for nanomagnetometry using shallow nitrogen vacancy centers.","doi":"10.1021/nl503326t","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1021/nl503326t","venue":"Nano letters"}

Cytogenetic examinations revealed clonal abnormalities in 39 cases with a predominance of simple numerical chromosome changes, i.e., trisomies of chromosomes 7, 8, and 18. One hundred forty-six tumors did not show clonal abnormalities, but single-cell aberrations other than monosomies occurred in 79 of these tumors. Compared to cells of epithelial hyperplasia of the breast, amniotic fluid cells, and cells from pleomorphic adenomas cultivated using the same medium, the frequency of single-cell trisomies was significantly higher. Trisomy 8 was not only found as a clonal aberration in 10 cases but was also the most frequent non-clonal aberration. Trisomy 7 and 18 were also frequent clonal as well as non-clonal cytogenetic deviations.","inCitations":["7785be8138d1c78fb303cc230bb0d8cb62b6aacf","fb2e5e3dd45d6798c067dfa6b4651b0ad3518614","3abd09c22e625b4ca4e1c281543e03a14e0e9e98","cb144b50d3170be3b02a68a437d906a9a32b7aec","6242ae861c89730b519f3c2d4a30b9e4ed21a15c","c2836704f9242ba23e02e9fbf2e3d7a4b8ba329a","a393386ea913411c282b4f86668e8d4b0286f117","a18644b85fc38676afe83d623ab94024ed94f591","28cbd72dc717fc13eb73714103f81b1982bb7242","379c5edde886f49088786d188b48a44b93273e1f"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Trisomy 8 and 18 as frequent clonal and single-cell aberrations in 185 primary breast carcinomas.","doi":"10.1016/0165-4608(94)00164-7","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/0165-4608%2894%2900164-7","venue":"Cancer genetics and cytogenetics"}

The children were clinically evaluated (DMFT index, bleeding on probing and DAI index) and asked to complete the questionnaire about family environment, self-perception of health status, oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL) and school (questions in Child Perceptions Questionnaire - CPQ11-14). A questionnaire about socioeconomic status and perceptions about their children's health was sent to the parents. School performance was measured.\n\n\nRESULTS\nIn a multivariate logistic model, the following variables remained statistically significant when associated with adolescents' poor school performance in the final model: number of people living in household, household overcrowding, parental perceptions about their children's oral health, presence of carious lesions and a question from CPQ11-14 about difficulty in paying attention in class because of their teeth, lips, jaws or mouth.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe results of this study showed that socioenvironmental factors, subjective perceptions and oral health status of children - particularly carious lesions, have an important impact on school performance, demonstrating the need for planning public health dentistry based on intersectoral public policies.","inCitations":["c235472f134098a658373ca2e0c80ccb56162bdc","67a71f632cd0bca11fe0c07cadb48a2f3d62eeb5","46f8c214efad8ab1039d1ef7d7b5d065bbda4f03","541c4a6262072fcfd874693aae5bb43805c8b8a0","461341a9a1ab76dce708871e497ccf74ec3ecbcb","f0464b5583ff76094889d68dc0a82c8a1fff753a","59c6312cdff73044c9b8a9a490c5ca0b5990ed2d","4d9896cc706aae6b09280077ef7bf3fa5c2fa116","395fed6bb8a0cd0ce53015b2921b6c9edcf41182","c0523fa122b022207982906fafe040e6a35141ac","057064dfd0efd2ebe55f5803ec2b1c0c4d1162a7"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Oral Disorders, Socioenvironmental Factors and Subjective Perception Impact on Children's School Performance.","doi":"10.3290/j.ohpd.a32672","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.3290/j.ohpd.a32672","venue":"Oral health & preventive dentistry"}

A phase I trial was conducted in which a uniform quantity of antibody labeled with escalating doses of iodine 131 (131I) was administered to patients with advanced gastrointestinal (GI) malignancies to evaluate tolerance and pharmacokinetics.\n\n\nPATIENTS AND METHODS\nEighteen patients with advanced, assessable GI malignancies (16 colon, one pancreas, and one gastric) previously treated with conventional chemotherapy (but no pelvic radiation) received 20 mg of COL-1 labeled with 131I, with doses from 10 mCi/m2 to 75 mCi/m2. In this cohort, the baseline serum CEA level ranged from 6 to 2,739 ng/mL (mean +/- SD, 500 +/- 639).\n\n\nRESULTS\nNuclear imaging detected at least one tumor site in all 18 patients; 82% of all tumor involved organs were positive and 58% of all lesions > or = 1.0 cm were detected. Immune complexes were detected in 89% of patients 5 minutes after completion of infusion, and levels correlated with CEA levels (r = .71). Elevated CEA (> 500 ng/mL) and tumor bulk (total tumor area > 150 cm2) correlated directly with clearance of serum radioactivity and inversely with serum half-life and cumulative serum radioactivity parameters. Nonhematologic toxicity was mild and non-dose-limiting. Hematologic toxicity, particularly thrombocytopenia, was both dose-related and dose-limiting. The maximal-tolerated dose is 65 mCi/m2. The correlation between dose (millicuries per square meter) and thrombocytopenia was made stronger, by accounting for either variation in pharmacokinetics, or variation in serum CEA and tumor bulk.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\n131I-COL-1 is well tolerated, except for hematologic toxicity. These data suggest that patients with highly elevated circulating CEA levels and/or increased tumor bulk may clear 131I-labeled COL-1 more rapidly from the circulation and experience less myelosuppression.","inCitations":["d1bbd9d2bfa5423bc2fc033892890905079785dc","71b60a785c44f17265687dd18b1f49247155eefb","7b8ea9cb5eb4f81db9423834417288163828a785","93d2eac301911ca0a278a9219851e20843fb9a0e","90296ce224e75c3dde069577773af08760ad9787","19bbb2669988797791ac8c4582e26c6031f1542a","a4da6983aea771b204af94798e78109ffa7023e7","aa4e884a2ae57c5e8223441a447e32fd8d25d779","ee475844d9be11b05c3302c83966aa76d5557659","610ff726c7afb5636769307aee05dc1c1fa83e39","23ede243cfdb85dab8a7998f11eeb2bcf12f8714","c09601eb6b78ecd30ce73cc1c07e37aa64261cb3","c4f65b997d9d57157186de8f4fb0fad84d4f0dda","07d6b848a585718eab9132932832bde499a96e56"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Phase I trial of iodine 131-labeled COL-1 in patients with gastrointestinal malignancies: influence of serum carcinoembryonic antigen and tumor bulk on pharmacokinetics.","doi":"10.1200/JCO.1996.14.6.1798","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1200/JCO.1996.14.6.1798","venue":"Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology"}

The directional freezing approach endows the graphene aerogel with a high compressive strength in the axial direction and good compressibility in both axial and radial directions. The anisotropic graphene aerogel also exhibits ultralow density, excellent flexibility in liquids, satisfactory fire-resistance, and strain-sensitive electrical conductivity. After absorbing organic liquids, the aerogel can be well recycled by burning, distilling, or squeezing, which makes it promising for oil absorption with a good recyclability.","inCitations":["6d90fa703e46b334e4045cb6c0a9ee134cb0ce0b","712518ecc77aed59ff4c711fdd748a7e4c379f29","3a685d5a8639e789b2c23323a4bd36c5d1c1a6fe","ea3f375a6a461b70e9758757ac03d5f15ac7cf75","294fb24f3c178a6d37477a238aa143a198f8c2b6","855aaa7515700fb25553f420ab6fb75b6cd40f61","5d0a2887886f350ed1a3b00e7e13f46b24309b1d","6270a631e8c76ed4d65ee1a9c4f3f146a0731698","a3e7a6670eacfd33151bd1eed506de7e167a1cb7","ce2e61f8573d1393527bcb52a7ce7128da765a40","fa0c80a780509da77232838e687cb4b072e2bd3b","a4fdc6644fa128f2b1f4c9005fedb83b92ec97ad","f0bc600dca382bb407422f2ebb5ae02ba54c2495","f4308d1b2b1213893223e0e1dabd6ed3a31ba35f","9212f3e647e4b727bfca3e55dfd42c3ee77ffa90","3fdd66996ab0bb29956fc55001cc8f081f6fc19e","064544450dff88a3a7c3c9c71f2b26613e85e349","f4ba21caf58eaed487e1c1090a3cc9b11bf4d305","788414bdf140032ce005647b9e0a35f2fc8ca789","d14343e2d2ea84edbe3d0a4f21ac17ff24f107d1","eeb3abe729e1b4c8fb67016a6a1cb8465b304297","46d5ebcd3ce20ebfbd7f32dea450449382d436a2","f630de3e011be055ebf61496d8f2286ed5446f03"],"pdfUrls":["https://pdf-s2.xuebalib.com/8mr8IQUCFGO.pdf"],"title":"Highly compressible anisotropic graphene aerogels fabricated by directional freezing for efficient absorption of organic liquids","doi":"10.1016/j.carbon.2016.01.038","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2016.01.038","venue":""}
