The study aimed to elucidate to what extent cardiovascular risk factors exist in university students in Somaliland. In a cross-sectional survey, self-administered questionnaires were used to elucidate existence of cardiovascular risk factors in 173 university students (117 male, 56 female) in Hargeisa, Somaliland. Information elucidated included socio-economic and demographic data in addition to questions on coffee intake, on physical activity behavior, type of sport/activity and intensity and duration. Height and weight were taken, as was blood pressure (BP). Median age was 23 years in male and 20 years in female students. Mean BMI was 19.7 in male and 21.8 in female students. The prevalence rates of elevated BP and overweight (BMI ≥ 25) in female and male students were, 0 versus 9 and 14 versus 7 %, respectively. Coffee consumption was reported by 39 % of students. None of the female students reported smoking cigarettes, while 5.1 % of the male students did. Physical inactivity was reported by 52 % of the female students and 27 % of the male students (p = 0.01). Overall, male students reported a higher degree and intensity of physical activity. The prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors is low in female and male university students in Somaliland. However, the results demonstrate a high degree of physical inactivity and overweight might become a problem in the future. This issue should be addressed by increasing the motivation and opportunities for physical activity in students.","inCitations":["758fc249a0dc1a299161f81c0dd1f3bd2270abd1","e9e168755b5f81d013be980be66cb311451a2bc3","c8ca77260ab7d882e9265e13f7574f0b16322a41","03da07d2b2f602fa4471645ef0d91069235ffed6","612178689de0877401cafb16aa585243e4baf3ef","53b4ede9efbecbbe9ea9f19efd68811077272098","93022deef533922a512fdb5bc2922d36e11e1deb","7d0d2f848689ea440acc0a6402bd09b83b39245c","2014f731d073bfa90ad9b3e2f7a0a463e0f2035a"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Cardiovascular Risk Factors and Physical Activity Among University Students in Somaliland","doi":"10.1007/s10900-014-9938-3","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10900-014-9938-3","venue":"Journal of Community Health"}

More recently a role for these proteins and their inhibitors has been appreciated in several diverse renal and non-renal cell processes, including proliferation, development, differentiation, hypertrophy and apoptosis. The glomerulus represents a unique micro-environment in which to study the cellular outcome following injury, as each of the three resident cell types undergoes a specific and distinct response to a given stimulus. The mesangial cell is capable of marked proliferation, often accompanied by the deposition of extracellular matrix. In contrast, the podocyte has previously been considered a relatively inert cell, and the reparative proliferation of glomerular endothelial cells following injury has recently been described. There is currently increasing awareness of the need to prevent, control and ameliorate the progression of renal diseases. Knowledge of the cell cycle and an understanding of how this may be beneficially manipulated may be crucial to improving the outlook for patients with both diabetic and non-diabetic glomerular disease.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Cell cycle control in glomerular disease.","doi":"","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"Springer seminars in immunopathology"}

During the 10-year period the number of admissions per year had risen from 1884 in 1978 (death per admission=3.6%) to 3467 in 1987 (death per admission rate=1.7%). At the monthly audit meeting an attempt was made to classify each death as ‘avoidable’ or ‘unavoidable’. During this 10-year period it was considered that there were 89 ‘avoidable’ deaths.

composition. La dispersion impacte ces deux dernieres reponses puisqu'elle permet de coloniser de nouveaux habitats et influence la composition des populations au travers du flux de genes. En fonction de son adaptativite, la dispersion peut promouvoir ou reduire l'adaptation locale et modifier l'importance relative de la plasticite phenotypique et de l'adaptation genetique dans le changement de composition phenotypique des populations. Cependant, la fragmentation du paysage entrave la dispersion, affectant les deux reponses des populations au rechauffement et modifiant l'influence relative des differents processus impliques dans ces reponses. Le but de cette these etait de comprendre comment les reponses des populations au changement climatique pouvaient etre affectees par la fragmentation du paysage et la dispersion. En suivant des populations de lezards distribuees dans un systeme experimental permettant de manipuler simultanement les conditions climatiques et la connectivite entre habitats, nous avons demontre que la connectivite reduisait les effets du rechauffement sur la dynamique et la composition des populations. Nous avons observe que les decisions de dispersion etaient influencees par des facteurs intrinseques et extrinseques permettant de reduire l'influence d'un climat plus chaud sur la dynamique des populations, mais en reduisant egalement la densite des populations en climat plus froid. Etonnamment, nous avons aussi trouve que la dispersion pouvait modifier la force et la direction des pressions de selections agissant sur les phenotypes. Les actions conjointes de la dispersion et de la selection contrebalancaient ainsi la reponse plastique des individus. En les integrant dans un modele, des decisions de dispersion adaptative similaires avaient une forte influence sur la persistance predite des especes face au rechauffement. En effet, nous avons demontre que la dispersion adaptative favorisait le changement d'aire de repartition des populations et reduisait leur risque d'extinction, en comparaison a un modele avec dispersion aleatoire (independante de facteurs intrinseques et extrinseques). Plutot que de considerer la dispersion comme un processus neutre, nos resultats soulignent l'importance de la considerer comme un mecanisme complexe, faconne par de multiples facteurs et capable de determiner les reponses des especes au changement climatique. Nos resultats suggerent que la fragmentation pourrait fortement augmenter l'influence du changement climatique sur les populations et precipiter leur extinction. Nous appelons donc a une meilleure integration de la dispersion et de la structure du paysage dans les etudes sur les reponses des populations au changement climatique.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://thesesups.ups-tlse.fr/4395/1/2019TOU30085.pdf"],"title":"Species responses to climate change and landscape fragmentation: the central role of dispersal","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Each fraction was characterized by ESR, GC-MS and NMB, and studied their thermal reactivities. In the case of the fractiors whieh readily formed adducts with picric acid, the study by ESR showed that these fractions had more unpaired electrors than the others, and the study by GC-MS showed that the fractiors consisted of large amounts of heterocycles, containing nitrogen atoms, and high molecules. In addition' these fractions reacted tapidly when heat-treated. Azacompounds, such as acridine, can serve as catalysts for polymerization of pitch beeause of their hydrogen acceptability. Introduction softening point (SP) of 91.6oC Qitch A) insoluble free coal-tar soft pitch with a (pitch B) were used. The degree of polymerization is one of the key properties of binder or impregnant pitch. It ¡s very important to know what kinds of compounds in pitch react readily during polymerization. As pitch coruists of a variety of compounds, it is very diffieult to study all of these compounds simultaneously. Though pitch is divided into sevenal lractions using solvents, these fnactions have similar propeities. Gemmenke et al., proposed fractionation of pitch aceording to chemical reqqtivity' sueh qs an ebility to form change-transfer adducts.r, They reported that, in the case of 1-resin (benzene soluble) of pitch, the compounds which readily form picrate with picric acid can be readüy polymerized. However, they did not specify the compounds which can form picrate. This paper reports a study undertaken to determine what kinds of compounds in Y -resin readily form picrate. Pitch is fractionated into B-reein (benzene insoluble but quinoline soluble) and c-resin (quinoline insoluble) in addition to -resin. -resin is a valuable fraction of pitch for the electrode industry, because it has a high coking value and a high joining abüity with a filler. It isr however' difficult to determine the properties of B-resin because of its poor solubüity in solvents other than quinoline. Unfortunately, quinoline is not a suitable solvent for studies in which picric acid is used. Aecordinglyt trichlorobenzene (TCB) was chosen as a solvent forg -resin, because TCB is inert to picric acid, though it dissolves only half of B-resin. The TCB soluble fraction of B-resin was also investigated using picric acid. Based on the results of these studies, acridine and phenazine were added to improve the reactivity of pitch. b<perimental seetion Commercially evailable eoal-tar hard pitch with a and quinoline SP of 36.2oC B resin was separated from the pitch A using benzene and quinoline. This B-resin was dried in vacuo and dissolved in TCB. The TCB soluble fraction of B-resin was filtered and used as a TCB solution. The picric acid dissolved in TCB was added to the TCB solution, and the mixture was stirred at 80oC for 1.5 hours. The resultant precipitate was separated from the solution by filtration. An ammonium hydrate solution was added to the precipitate and filtrate to wash off picric aeid as ammonium picnate, and pitch wa¡r recovered in the form ofB-pic and B-n-pic from the precipitate and filtrate, repectively. The recovered pitches were dried in vacuo. y-resin was separated from the pitch A using ber¡zene. The.¡-resin dissolved in be¡rzene was added with the picric acid dissolved in benzene, and the mixture was stirred at 60oC for 2 hours. The resultant precipitate and filtrate were washed with an ammonium hydrate solution, and pitch was recovered in the form of y-pic and y-n-pic from the precipitate and filtrate, respectively. The recovered pitches were dried in vacuo. The separated pitches were o<amined by ESR (JEOL JES-FE3X), GC-MS (JEOL DX-300), and NMR (JEOL FX90Q and Varian XL-200). They were also heated at 430oC for 1.5 hours in an autoclave, and their TI (toluene insoluble fraction) and Qt (quinoline insoluble fraction) were measured before and after heat treatment. Three different kinds of pitch B were prepared by adding 10% acridine, phenazine and anthracene, respectively. These pitches and the pitch B whieh did r¡ot contain such additives were heated in a nitrogen atmosphere, and their TI, QI andrrdftix d carbon) were measured.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://www.ems.psu.edu/~radovic/1985/papers/1985_326.PDF"],"title":"Characterization of Charge-Transfer Adducts of Coal-Tar Pitches","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Microsomal preparations from lungs and liver and S9 fractions from alimentary tract mucosa were tested for their capacity to activate NPY to a mutagen by the Ames Salmonella assay. Chronic ethanol exposure resulted in an increased capacity to activate NPY by microsomes derived from liver, lungs, and esophagus but not from stomach. The three tissues in which enhanced activation of NPY was observed in the present study also have been noted in epidemiological studies to be target sites of alcohol abuse-associated increased cancer risk. The results presented here suggest that dietary ethanol's effect on carcinogen metabolism may be responsible, at least in part, for the increased cancer risk observed in chronic alcohol abusers.","inCitations":["2c81b0b8dd19c249111c98ad82393c4b33d66af6","547b64e8d3d426e94b59a971d32b7a354391c49b","06f915c940fcc5c2315c2208dec70ce8239b41d5","b166b9cac6f550262929ba72fdd1326c9d2d6d4d","180134373c8546e0f85a1eb7f6b5eb91a8a9fb16","0127fe25e4955fe18916af5e4d1ac51a6a4cb63f","b2645e5dc2f1dc6057ca0029e056231fd0bbbb02","386180a32de41782f70c00ff50f8f165159b2111","7ed73b9d1a7e72c64748a3d5cf9e39cfcb98ef48","fba27d7dd4a8d735b2fa09a7eab1d6dc73ecfed3","00fb8fbf2d4ebea1fc0a638b8b36e2db98063dc7","e8819be5ff45c161a7af2ac508e4e481736f09ce","93848376927e25da6aeddee47c606f43c3a26adc"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Effect of chronic ethanol consumption on activation of nitrosopyrrolidine to a mutagen by rat upper alimentary tract, lung, and hepatic tissue.","doi":"","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"Drug metabolism and disposition: the biological fate of chemicals"}

When mandated these extra duties are called compulsory citizenship behaviors.\n\n\nMETHOD\nThis descriptive study included 569 nurses who work in three hospitals. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistical analyses, linearity test, Pearson's correlation analysis, simple linear regression analysis, parametric and nonparametric tests.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThere was a significant, strong and positive relationship between the nurses' job stress and compulsory citizenship behaviors. Statistically significant differences were found between the nurses' job stress scores according to the institution and unit they worked in and their professional experience duration.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThis study found that nurses display compulsory citizenship behaviors, experience job stress at a high level. A significant relationship was found between these two variables.\n\n\nIMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING MANAGEMENT\nSpecial training programs should be held for informing managers and nurses about the negative outcomes of compulsory citizenship behaviors and positive outcomes of organizational citizenship behaviors.

This essay critically examines the ways in which science diplomacy at the multilateral level was mobilized to produce UNESCO's vision for a ‘culture of peace’. Underlying UNESCO's vision was the diplomacy of scientific humanism, best articulated in the words and person of its first Director‐General Julian Huxley, himself a scientist. The scientific method was the axiom that would bring diverse communities together. After examining the humanism of science diplomacy, this essay outlines two major effects of UNESCO's science diplomacy: science diplomacy networks and programs. The S of UNESCO contributed to global beliefs in multilateral diplomacy as a way of resolving conflicts, especially in further propagating the use of scientific evidence in multilateral negotiations. The essay also outlines the limits of these science networks, institutions, and scientific evidence in multilateral diplomacy although science may well be the unsung ‘hero’ of an otherwise highly politicized UNESCO.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"UNESCO: Scientific Humanism and its Impact on Multilateral Diplomacy","doi":"10.1111/1758-5899.12624","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1111/1758-5899.12624","venue":""}

Traumatic life events may underlie the development of ED as many studies document [1] . In the present study, we examined the effectiveness of EMDR therapy that was originally used to treat Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) [2] , on restrictive eating symptoms associated with trauma. Cases B.O. (18) and B.S. (20) came to the clinic consecutively for resembling complaints about the sense of food sticking in their throat, breathing difficulties, raised heart beatings, unease to swallow, and choking fear. The patients revealed past traumatic events about being out of breath while swallowing their bites. Then, they have started to restrict their food intake and the types of food consumed, which led to emaciation with health problems, interrupted daily routines, and social isolation; meeting the diagnosis of avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID) in DSM-5. Due to traumatic experiences, EMDR therapy was applied. Discussion After five EMDR therapy sessions, patients turned back to healthy eating habits, normal BMI, and effective daily life. As expected, EMDR therapy made significant improvements in the treatment of ARFID. Conclusion EMDR can be useful to treat ED with traumatic background.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"EMDR therapy on trauma-based restrictive eating cases","doi":"10.1016/j.eurpsy.2017.01.811","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eurpsy.2017.01.811","venue":""}

Diode pumping of solid-state lasers is performed either by end or side-pumping geometries. As well known, end or longitudinal pumping of Nd:YAG lasers is the method for obtaining higher conversion efficiencies of pump-to-TEM00-laser outputs compared to side-pumped techniques /1/. As reported, in the more efficient end-pumped scheme for generating diffraction-limited output power, the pump light and the TEM00 laser mode spatially overlap. However, end-pumped systems yielded lower output powers, while side-pumping seems easier scalable towards higher powers due to the larger lateral dimensions of the present diode laser arrays, and the simpler pump-light focusing optics. Optical conversion efficiencies of pump-to-Nd:YAG-laser output powers were reported to be approximately 30% when end-pumped, and 10% for side-pumped geometries /2/. It depends on what the diode-pumped laser system is finally used for, whether a high multimode output power or a fairly Gaussian mode profile is needed for a specific application. Therefore, considerable efforts are being made to improve both pumping schemes by using sophisticated imaging optics for focusing the pump light into the laser material. For example, a high power Nd:YAG laser achieved 1.9 W of TEM00 mode output at 1.064 µm wavelength when end-pumped with a 10 W laser diode array /3/. Various geometries were studied using quasi longitudinal pumping techniques /4/. The authors have scaled the angular multiplex pump geometry to focus the power of eight 15 W laser arrays into the rod ends obtaining an optical-to-optical efficiency of 26%. The expected thermal distortion and stress-induced birefringence at these high pump power levels could be minimized.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Diode-Array Side-Pumped Multiwatt Nd:YAG Laser","doi":"10.1007/978-3-662-08251-5_5","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-662-08251-5_5","venue":""}

The most attractive advantage of the proposed algorithm is that it is computationally simpler than concurrent CMA and soft decision-directed (SDD) scheme (CMA+SDD), and modified CMA (MCMA), while the approximation of steady-state MSE of the proposed algorithm is same with CMA+SDD, and lower than MCMA.

Previous studies have identified a 15 bp sequence, the Cbs (for chromosome breakage sequence), that is necessary and sufficient to specify these sites. In this study we determined the effects of mutations in the Cbs on its ability to specify the chromosome breakage site and promote new telomere formation in conjugating cells. Twenty-one constructs with single nucleotide substitutions covering all 15 positions of the Cbs were made and tested. Fourteen of them (covering 11 positions) abolished breakage entirely, six (covering six positions, including the remaining four) caused partial loss of breakage function and one showed no detectable effect. This result indicates that the Cbs has an exceptionally long and stringent sequence requirement. It offers no evidence that the Cbs contains a separate domain for promoting new telomere formation. In addition, we found that a partially functional Cbs retained in the macronucleus does not induce chromosome breakage during vegetative growth and that excess copies of this germline-specific sequence in the somatic nucleus have little deleterious effect on cell growth.","inCitations":["27ed3ce2d92845673a34f67c5e5301eabde7b85d","7ff1ea08b651e155be49cd6107bc0dec7d997780","f4953b7cfdba1207eac7579e6eec37334562a3b2","f332d3c00b091fa0d208fd71120e10dabbbec1ae","487e559b49729000ab20354ed58f8c7259fcc0e4","94669f94249a1b5de3d5e05770011689cc1a0eac","e67b45e6d999b500191da0567af29fb34197e208","83b651d2b3834f73e0660795ff0d473b95fb8bfe","caf3e19e4baa47e4192f544e486821db6f0cc9e8","98ba073b9b2010801b78c3cf61e73661164884d1","6406692098f0eefa5655de811a746b176cc2174e","d0df2ff03ee850edaefe1e4d5158b0baa45fcef2","1cbeabdb713ac6e7656fe11fa274e7d71f0dd457","e9d012bfc035f7cf1b37bc09be77d9fe03ad5908","f4c3c92166d170ea5dc34a9fdcf1453d61ff2f5f","af0dfa22fa9b58b24088b7fbcfbf33abbb098e77","79ca2932ff731d2c122355bf5bc4733e79005d83","b9d96c9a919ffce6ffbcdafc24fa984b0b8f6e7a","fbecc647d5e4cfc7f417d1d7b0bc9dab4c26cfe6","8987aff8c2966e2d0e68ae2a89d1afd94109727b"],"pdfUrls":["https://oup.silverchair-cdn.com/oup/backfile/Content_public/Journal/nar/28/4/10.1093_nar_28.4.895/1/280895.pdf?Expires=1492125478&Key-Pair-Id=APKAIUCZBIA4LVPAVW3Q&Signature=CbDNdACNebwHYkSlNh4BXRWfJMs6hQ0xsehLV2zpumjphvmlB4D3mjwmy9xciJLWSwU0RoKShkqjNjHlgFs2C0dvbEY01j7ccgus5~pwOWuQ9lki29rI2GGOKh6b3UEgzpuIE4wO4RTs2q1dEKjNcO9RCkI8doCKDMFZQ~TLgqYfsyfl3SnCmzk4x4vfpUexZXNFS64E8KBX4G5yG8IHWpZg6cea7FA3okMncIjKdg5kB9sJLzYDMCV6ofo0wng4-kZnAO8ZnhG-zzbKxHA2PgKSw~V56oWrsvFrDf6-Lmbpl9caVLX20D15gYBXPh1A2BhRsm~zunCBV9GD94z9Sw__"],"title":"A long stringent sequence signal for programmed chromosome breakage in Tetrahymena thermophila.","doi":"10.1093/nar/28.4.895","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1093/nar%2F28.4.895","venue":"Nucleic acids research"}

The structure of the proposed sensor uses a 2x2 array of multimode interference (MMI) coupler based on micro graphene waveguide for high sensitivity. The beam propagation method (BPM) are used to efficiently design the sensor structure. The structure is consist of an array of two by two elements of sensors. Each element has three sections of single mode for field input tapered to MMI as the main core sensor without cladding which is graphene based material, and then a single mode fiber as an output. In this configuration MMI responses to any change in the environment. We validate and present the results by implementing the design on a set of sucrose solution and showing how these samples lead to a sensitivity change in the sensor based on the MMI structures. Overall results, the 3D design has a feasible and effective sensing by drawing topographical distribution of suspended particles in the water.","inCitations":["c34032b43b45c8a9137043916f2de0e76e7fdb01"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Numerical analysis of a 3D optical sensor based on single mode fiber to multimode interference graphene design","doi":"10.1117/12.2227605","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1117/12.2227605","venue":"Photonics Europe"}

In Phase II, all configurations evaluated in Phase I were re-evaluated using a head-up display (HUD) command tracking task. Results from the evaluations with a target aircraft were compared to the results obtained using HUD command tracking. Cooper-Harper ratings consistently worse than 3.5 and pilot comments corresponding to Level 2 performance were obtained during all phases. Both test phases indicated that a stick force of 10 Ib/g was too high and a stick force of 4 Ib/in. was too low for favorable comments and ratings. In both Phase I and Phase II, the combination of 7 Ib/g with 6 Ib/in. and 7 Ib/g with 8 Ib/in. received the best ratings and comments.

They are the multiple-mode interference and distortions due to the ionospheric irregularities. Fading time series produced by the first of these mechanisms alone should typically represent a multiple-periodical process. This kind of signal may also be produced by an autonomous dynamical system. The character of the time series produced by the second mechanism depends on the nature of the ionospheric irregularities. Recently, evidence has been accumulated to show that sometimes the ionospheric turbulence on equatorial and middle latitudes represents a low-dimensional deterministic chaotic process. These facts suggest that for both mechanisms the fading time series may have a deterministic nature and therefore is predictable. Accordingly we apply the nonlinear predicting technique proposed by Farmer and Sidorovich [1987] to the fading time series obtained by the University of Illinois HF sounder. In its application the prediction technique is modified to take into account specifics of the HF data. For comparison, the conventional linear autoregression prediction technique is also tested. It is found that, in general, the nonlinear prediction and the linear autoregressive forecasting allow prediction on a few correlation times and work with roughly the same success.","inCitations":["2b598988dde806a070d5e393e0ee201d6b5698b4","d0799b8a384d27605159b40f5f2bf187a5cbde75"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Linear and nonlinear prediction techniques for short-term forecasting of HF fading signals","doi":"10.1029/96RS03793","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1029/96RS03793","venue":""}

The purpose of the heat treatment, performed at 700{degrees}C, is to relieve the residual stresses. Generally, it also increases the SCC resistance of the alloy. A laboratory study has been carried out in order to gain a better understanding of the metallurgical factors influencing the PWSCC resistance of Alloy 600 after heat treatment. It has been shown that there are two kinds of tubes for which the heat treatment does not produce a microstructure having a potentially high resistance to SCC: tubes with a high carbon content (over 0.032%) or tubes mill-annealed at high temperatures and heavily cold-worked by the straightening. The analysis of the behaviour of french steam generators reveals that the heat treatment generally had the expected beneficial effect. However, the early cracking in service of some treated tubes led EDF (national power company) to proceed with removals. The majority of the cracked pulled-out tubes exhibit microstructures having a potentially high PWSCC sensibility in laboratory tests.

However, the relative importance of the PtdIns(4,5)P2 5-phosphatases in regulating PtdIns(4,5)P2 levels for specific cell processes is not well understood. Ocrl1 is a PtdIns(4,5)P2 5-phosphatase that is deficient in the oculocerebrorenal syndrome of Lowe, a disorder characterized by defects in kidney and lens epithelial cells and mental retardation. Ocrl1 was originally localized to the Golgi in fibroblasts, but a subsequent report suggested a lysosomal localization in a kidney epithelial cell line. In this study we defined the localization of ocrl1 in fibroblasts and in two kidney epithelial cell lines by three methods: immunofluorescence, subcellular fractionation, and a dynamic perturbation assay with brefeldin A. We found that ocrl1 was a Golgi-localized protein in all three cell types and further identified it as a protein of the trans-Golgi network (TGN). The TGN is a major sorting site and has the specialized function in epithelial cells of directing proteins to the apical or basolateral domains. The epithelial cell phenotype in Lowe syndrome and the localization of ocrl1 to the TGN imply that this PtdIns(4,5)P2 5-phosphatase plays a role in trafficking.","inCitations":["77de5621618515ecc0ad8e9e5668e6f5477ce1bf","68618a16e801bd471c9f2e4aae2ef78d4afa6959","f49b08266d18d50063cc92d33af45612f275fd7b","ae7bff229fc929143ae359efa095773980533bc1","c4a3fa527050173e15dc6b674907a43fcea5e038","0d5600d957443eb576154745ce5abc9715ec0fe4","7da2e75420017a1a762a8d80d236e58b2e8f806a","d03037eef21986a671993222f42067ca99914a1a","8ca5316564dcc949ee81c0f733c5cea90ea98700","863cfce31eb84022a3fd4e566fc563e85f13a1ff","1bde21d3c6012f0d85bcc1dfa9bff7dbf2365f60","0e92c4b1af27189ff58714daca2e46422b08c48f","fbf76ed7d489c51b245a9e668027dbd2c0ff622e","8b0d7c01f96ecfc85ecea74e3933b2eee9679c19","8db41dafb9c2a6e2cea7786b385c2ea60c979e38","e2efa9c729c605c0774f372844608b36a648d1b7","dedf5ce78ef09f0175969eb7b4e18d3e31e9e65e","5db9b115163f2027fddabc38b6c617ed39e85625","4d9e6cc6fcfde7785585cd34d5b23315ed71558e","da88fd5007d2c496d90975ee6af33104cea70d4c","9793b07b5f15a22caf91fe414a07af86f0d8be95","ee72c3606798e2a56978d58ec72efb3ddc2aa9ab","02321bc18f1299e162c1fc07103878b45df6edc2","e41544d5f0e88ae399b47248b766d890dae6fdde","bab53c43b27c9ddc1457deafa7ca42952143fe03","d117ac3c8755c6f0fa561b34ded3e6171b5c8ce3","5dd5ef683fad4147e7ce7b73311bb47e500ea1d4","6d49de553e7f922c36e84ae9d44658c474735f62","01465b232668362098ce21b4f04bb13a22d0ccfd","ab05b77e5156dd65a94e3f5bad5d1d841ba22227","f8f055aaed37c717389cb1bf96b088a1cea1d8a6","93cd937301d3b63ff1f7f229ad0fc5cbf5a1ac95","3358026b6ee8d5902f5880d172dc6ecdb04889a4","bb4ad54b00ac746b2201feab98e1cf1fca9bf0bf","416f6d3fec63475e4785b60d294cb151fe391f22","8f95ac5245c57938e3e12ff843bf9f5b568445f8","b79edb208212291fb6bc6a57988eb62e8e992f14","02236a04dc74b99c5c713b582c6a8046b0dd2644","b4199dbc38463d39a354b58fe8a52edb627b1a89","0335e922e85d1f579f6888d7b696ced42e08f8e0","d8914b09eab4ee72846e7c1d9dc26e04e5df3fdf","963cb988b90b2a56bba8c02b9ecd80793f46cbad","4f117aa11795f8599343427d27cb4afbff68316f","f712ae20deafc94a8f0bca274036148e12b88e8b","c2a6c33b9965bdaf2f18d71b6d8bac18fc0ec562"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Ocrl1, a PtdIns(4,5)P2 5-Phosphatase, Is Localized to the Trans-Golgi Network of Fibroblasts and Epithelial Cells","doi":"10.1177/002215540004800203","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1177/002215540004800203","venue":"The journal of histochemistry and cytochemistry : official journal of the Histochemistry Society"}

Studies were selected using predetermined criteria, and two independent reviewers extracted data. Weighted mean differences (WMDs) were calculated using random effect models.\n\n\nRESULTS\nSix studies evaluated VO(2peak) involving a total of 571 adult cancer patients (exercise, n = 344; usual care control, n = 227). Pooled data indicated that exercise training was associated with a statistically significant increase in VO(2peak) (WMD, 2.90 ml·kg(-1)·min(-1); 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.16-4.64); however, significant heterogeneity was evident in this estimate (I(2), 87%). Usual care (control) was associated with a significant decline in VO(2peak) from baseline to postintervention (WMD, -1.02 ml·kg(-1)·min(-1); 95% CI, -1.46 to -0.58; I(2), 22%). Sensitivity analyses indicated superior improvements in VO(2peak) for studies conducted for a shorter duration (<4 months) and following the completion of adjuvant therapy (p-values < .001). Exercise training was not associated with a higher incidence of adverse events, although safety was not rigorously monitored or reported.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nSupervised exercise training is associated with significant improvements in VO(2peak) following a diagnosis of early-stage cancer, with minimal adverse events.","inCitations":["aba913f9aee91417d9f52bc85b6251a90aca97b8","705b81609097e92813e70e32d9c310b0ef93815d","bf45dc92a955832ac80a24839889b69acc56004a","6b4a34215b8a869f8b4b8dd4c4c55e98f8c51f24","f47c58a5808fad131d4b57a2138833b3c2eb6c30","619097de16dbb0e391b2eb6dc67909669f22bdbc","745b259fa8a5366681e97fb28bd2fa32854052cf","14a475a71de5ddb405e2812134beeeff4c845140","3bbfecfd0309dc4edbfce2ae1e4bfc012503825d","63626ff145f5272a7b0a56b2c75c9c1404f4deb2","a0ca6ab0cc0b0a774bc6410b45da59f6dadc582a","fea6ddc6cf4f1ab549f77dbdae9e273d7461ac3f","817da35bd661b890b270645e8a3956c52e796cac","a7dcb4ca59a76ad1ff564c5bac1573480d680952","114d9a29aaf4cc83d0b06e24418573221a54b1c0","c3ea670a6d544dcbcd8e2452331a0c54334a8a75","8631e71853f274947fee79775228f9c7240baccd","24823bfab8f0d5c868bed116829583a16a25d492","7446fc252e6736156a41c817962fe6dd632f5d2c","b25a74d69f87ca730deeaa6a4e4524c138a53720","016a4063eaaaa4f85c7a23cb53e567a45fe061d9","044ee338cdf95f323a560b47fcce02ae28b3513b","d17af1e7da1a0cb86762ec2c9493f9ae2e89b6ae","59ded212ae24a62576ad8842c800e97947d8024a","a7e26ca76dd2738465f1829dd2916a21e2bb0cb3","22f39f36a698677efc94e5d64d8071b9667d8b44","d3ba68311467280d09a8527b1797f443a2cfcc62","a5736b413a5cd535676ef20e39519eaddcd89f1c","8704356988f1828d031a086d1586101146937a22","5a25cb596fa73db01fdcd9dd0c6dd79dc584ba06","16d7fde1ad8422520d297324f40d6c891f1efe71","45e8f68dc0f1dd9061ea1fed93a62e9f6c46afd3","f4384cd02abf8ba1cae688b8babee98da57582fb","9910e7e7370001c30c23416e20220a215fc6a2b3","80c62664640b139ef33afd45e5df4ca090497e53","b2d69fdfb2593b05a677d4f6ca4c0a136a50fa88","450bcdae98eb718d3ad00e0b6f935afc0c191d0c","e3bd31a624c9943078bab40551c841d76ed3b8b3","aa65f3da22642822df54627dbfd399adb10493c7","ea1265b86c583f0ff0be679a1fee9c90fd9a044f","c9e23ff3067a6900d3b9a18150dcf68768d2e087","8cb57fab38469e6264fbbcea96efa337bd4bc5a5","5d8c3b467026ecc890543a91b68b33e3f98f51cd","3df928c53c7eed0a3a88455307cac6c581d4129f","a02c38d481670f6b4a525d5823abf527fbaba9e6","be63c8d33ff9e087a79b1393a47588386141711f","c095c0aa5814dacd165c4cd27d7c08d1d16b7bda","def7ce9f86e17f3aa82facb80b7c87f6f7f7f711","743a731d2730e5f98f3910ba4eb62ae0fea34e38","af9ef899cc8c3f06f3b9023ee21e26609ed95411","0f77fe5bdae0e6c23a3f266c8cf439129085cef8","8c17bd7c9ae2c078560bc8eac07e820d081d7de5","b6ebbd040dbff51603a93a93f0fd4c75d680655f","7e45a1b980158e873bc37dd875aeb36d533d463b","75c63a4e7dcf3c30efa8a690cd2e2c3909c45108","a2345713207bab6321d2e15158bc6059a3bfe650","91c5726e4a814d504483956a2f3376983fcba907","db83d3528ce491508c321daa8e64294001f92e11","b1d3e8ab22890b1ff8a7055a1ca2bfd530fb83d1","c2744845646a73b4b729a01dbeaea853dbd075f9","2bbfe36afd344d794aa5a513c4ffc53043100f33","830b9bb96f7cf876edfb93d417a83bf8a9c4a31b","ceda912eadb2b73c32c5ac1c0a85d0678b273d2c","e364c643a47ae916195142fc5d1ca6c8eb26cf56","3f1363ba5aba23cea499c859bd2cb45d2da41907","50329ebc421e05aee90708ab3920c7c7f0e1e3a3","e912698c46be20076549862c25707a964fa2382b","0765120bcec51d1c62dc950d79a3ac81c9b3cf70","f65c8606dce0f918a32610a81e3d300af13feea7","eef3e90a02362e00545bd46fdbbe6a5244de04b1","b49d7fcf703acd2ec24a4f111467132b2cd88d88","8e25097637a4b5c9f3200452ec304f71a05e8929","0d33398e60742763fd7770450184fae07d4a0931","c3087397801b1e331225f8a7653aff509fa0ae3e","c40a3cfad10a3049235d5bf10a57955882c236ac","cef425a127bdd48772c79a557b3a99cd81103d00","f67e159e1b481c79b36a5f0fa4661c87ec7f2077","32921807d00a9ef3383009df487e4f5491a6dc49","169a60f95661b1d6baf473b63b72271026fb2752","8cded5da02470b72c6774a876d350ba8816db953","836f65fb34249aa5dda4b17f2b22ec869df3cf6a","0b55d6d2e8ebdb74ebe820e1d498b233572e9070","a939d193674d9e869d44cdd437225d7d26e42d3a","ae50c3ef049e66efb5ba8aecfc89aef06ca12bc1","77ac4a786a03b38b289aa1ee519bfc1e2cd1856f","61276dd9ea3edcb4340f995e688a46189bfd2c87","26b7b703b61088456f7604a8ec0d00996ef716dc","1a04bccab9a5173766ec50c0cdb4c5d1b723545c","541686c459c1da7ddfbca753b4dd09f7165699fc","135b3abe86e9bdbdb05dac14ee4590ecb3c24ba1","8d83702f71561e7095a0e693fabc9a2573fa18aa","e00d9e950aa046b136613eee7f623d75139c91f3","da170a730d6823edae7e3d99c104798d987b4f0a","3ac19cce4bfb21916b91cd40e83b8f76ce31bd02","cdfa5f13e5fd2ba43c1c454066c5dff15a067959","b83d4f9cabdf7e362f0974893cb64d591ccb0011","2f935909456f1949ae27ad698dc298834899b7db","ef12ef2e961ab450192be189547dd48743da95a6","dea8db349cb01ca13cf6eefbaf36b5a58579b7ab","669bec002c4271707cb2628333d380b9781741f5","82e4cfd837b031464227b8cba6e8678e119e57fa","758215c9e8ad4ea18bc1cc891f418c1df490a6de","ea53b4c0d04e661f27d7bd003f4aa30786e0a1c7","ed960c35a11bd26c6b9a09c2cfda8d06c3cee4c8","ea82ffa30c66b573b88ff0b54782e0c42fcb235f","d5388048a79d74e3600d512200bb3a9fa7959fda","b64610af7e4bb53786defaceea95467a9b106b6c","e0040b5e11b47496cd357688d3f3fede981cfab4","7227fd24b3b3f6b2727cc4612d29d404c3bffe7a","9d4a84a6bd8735b01481674873ff87acda9dcc1c","1c70eadf50dd4d291505b724fc33c4fbb2dd31ce","051ef00705093f789142866f98cba8ea4093b36e","8a6d9838c2997257bf569c756f9c8c044eab04de","f4fcfa42b6bd1d454a099c07046fdf593b4fc504","e4eb673706c563120ac91c6c3094dee7cf912998","5ed12244a56c10ccd4920fb1073edc

Formulae are presented for the radiation intensity at large distances from the cylinder and for the radiation energy flux through the cross section of the cylinder. Under the Cherenkov condition for dielectric permittivity of the cylinder and the velocity of the particle image on the cylinder surface, strong narrow peaks appear in the angular distribution of the radiation in the exterior medium. The radiated energy inside the cylinder is redistributed among the cylinder modes and, as a result, the corresponding spectrum differs significantly from the homogeneous medium or free-space results. It is shown that the presence of the cylinder can lead to the considerable increase of the radiation intensity.","inCitations":["9b86705631e2d6e3d68311e079d0481105d1524d"],"pdfUrls":["http://accelconf.web.cern.ch/AccelConf/ICAP2012/papers/tuscc3.pdf"],"title":"Undulator Radiation inside a Dielectric Waveguide","doi":"10.1016/j.nimb.2013.01.076","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nimb.2013.01.076","venue":""}
