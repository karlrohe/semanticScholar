In weiterer Folge werden sie miteinander in Verbindung \ngesetzt um daraus abzuleiten, ob sie kongruent oder divergent sind, d.h. der Handel die \nBedurfnisse der KonsumentInnen kennt und sie befriedigt. \nDazu werden zuerst Theorien aus der Werbepsychologie herangezogen. Im Mittelpunkt \nstehen die im Inneren des Menschen ablaufenden aktivierenden Prozesse, welche die \nBereitschaft fur eine Handlung anregen bzw. das Verhalten steuern. Genauer wird das \nAugenmerk auf die Entstehung des Kaufverhaltens gelegt. Die aktivierenden Prozesse \nunterteilen sich in Emotion, Motivation und Einstellung. Unter Emotion wird genauer \nbeschrieben wie sich der individuelle, subjektive Zusatznutzen eines Produktes fur \nKonsumentInnen zusammensetzt. Die Motivation beschreibt den Prozess der \nBefriedigung bestimmter Bedurfnisse. In diesem Fall wurde die Maslow´sche \nBedurfnispyramide herangezogen, um aufzuzeigen, dass fur die Ansprache der \nKonsumentInnen die sogenannten Wachstumsbedurfnisse essenziell sind. In Punkto \nEinstellung werden die Konzepte des Involvements und des Commitments \nmiteinbezogen, da sie wichtige Uberlegungen fur die Marketingkommunikation \ndarstellen. Weiters wird hier die Bedeutung von MeinungsfuhrerInnen und Testimonials \nangesprochen, sowie unter dem Image, das in dieser Arbeit nicht mit Einstellung gleich \ngesetzt wird, der Country-of-Origin-Effekt und die Positionierung von Produkten \nbehandelt. \nDer Theorieteil beinhaltet einen psychologischen Schwerpunkt mit okonomischer \nRelevanz, weshalb anschliesend in der formalen Annaherung der soziookonomischen \nBedeutung des Themas Beachtung geschenkt wird. Hier wird auf das Begriffspaar \nGlobalisierung und Regionalitat genauer eingegangen und inwiefern Globalisierung als \nMotor fur die Hinwendung zu Regionalitat gesehen werden kann. Die Teilprozesse der \nGlobalisierung, McDonaldisierung und Amerikanisierung werden erlautert sowie die \nAuswirkungen der Globalisierung auf die verschiedenen Bereiche des Lebens - \nbeginnend von den Anfangen der Globalisierung im Zeitalter der Industrialisierung uber \n132 \nden Einfluss auf Wirtschaft und Politik, Bewirtschaftungsweisen im Agrarsektor und die \nUmwelt, Kultur, Einkaufs- und Ernahrungsgewohnheiten, Marktbedingungen und \nQualitatssicherung im Lebensmittelbereich. \nMit ausgewahlten Regionalitatskonzepten wird aufgezeigt, welche Bemuhungen in \nOsterreich unternommen werden, um regionale Produkte und die mit ihr verbundenen \nkulturellen und traditionellen Facetten bekannter zu machen und zu vermarkten. \nHerangezogen wird die Initiative GENUSS REGION OSTERREICH, die einen \nbesonderen Schwerpunkt dieser Magisterarbeit darstellt. Die Bemuhungen und die \nTragweite dieses Ansatzes bezuglich Regionalitat werden mit den Herkunftsgarantien \ngeschutzte Ursprungsbezeichnung (g.U.) und geschutzte geographische Angabe (g.g.A.) \nder EU und Slow Food verglichen. \nDer empirische Teil enthalt die theoretische Grundlage zur Erstellung und Auswertung \nvon Fragebogen und den konkreten Aufbau der in dieser Arbeit zur Anwendung \ngekommenen Fragebogen. Weiters werden die Forschungsfragen mit den Daten des Gfk \nAustria-Fragebogens beantwortet, der die Einstellung der osterreichischen Bevolkerung \nwiderspiegelt sowie mit dem aus dem selbst erstellten Fragebogen gezogenen Material \nden Handel betreffend, das in Anlehnung an die qualitative Inhaltsanalyse nach Mayring \nausgewertet wurde. Die Verquickung der beiden Auswertungsmethoden, der \nerklarenden, beschreibenden quantitativen Methode und des verstehenden Instruments \nder qualitativen Inhaltsanalyse macht es moglich, einen fundierten Vergleich zwischen \nden Einstellungen der KonsumentInnen und des Handels zu ziehen. \nDie wissenschaftliche Arbeit kommt zu dem Schluss, dass die Initiative 39% der \nBefragten bekannt ist und bei diesen auf hohen Zuspruch stost. Das Bedurfnis nach \nRegionalitat ist sowohl beim Handel als auch bei den KonsumentInnen erkennbar, \nwobei ein Anspruch nach Kennzeichnung regionaler Produkte auf Seiten der \nEndverbraucherInnen noch nicht ausgereift ist. Der Handel erkennt das Bedurfnis der \nKonsumentInnen nach Regionalitat und geht auf jenes ein. GENUSS REGION \nOSTERREICH ist dabei eine Stutze und hat ein hohes Ansehen auf Seiten des Handels. \nDie Einstellungen gegenuber der Initiative sind beim Handel und den KonsumentInnen \nmeist deckungsgleich und werden durchwegs mit positiven Eigenschaften assoziiert.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://othes.univie.ac.at/12396/1/2010-10-06_0409389.pdf"],"title":"Einstellung der KonsumentInnen und des Handels zu Regionalität und der Marke \"Genuss Region Österreich\"","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

While studies have shown that newspapers are the primary source of information to the public regarding environmental issues, little is known about how environmental news is used as a risk-communication tool. This article explores the role of local information systems in risk communication, using newspaper content analysis as well as in-depth interviews with journalists and community residents to develop a case study of an environmental assessment process for a nonhazardous industrial-waste landfill. Results indicate that risk messages were chosen and shaped by journalists on the basis of their own exigencies. In addition, while newspapers were a major source of risk information, their impact was mitigated by resident distrust and access to other information sources, most notably their own personal information networks.

In previous publications, the effect of non-conservative edge loading has been neglected; only the divergent buckling and the parametric instability have been considered as causes of unstable bandsaw blade motion. However, the non-conservative loading due to sawing can excite a flutter-type instability, similar to flutter in aeroplane wings. The extended Galerkin method is used to discretize the equation of motion, and a non-self-adjoint eigenvalue solver is employed to find the solutions.","inCitations":["dd54b686218e2354fb7156165a200d12d283af3c","5e5be4d49381e14323690c0025cba7dc4e084ed1","d2e15512dfac30831e3a3333843026ff23edc1fd"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Wide bandsaw blade under cutting conditions: Part III: Stability of a plate moving in its plane while subjected to non-conservative cutting forces","doi":"10.1006/jsvi.1995.0440","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1006/jsvi.1995.0440","venue":""}

FCM data analysis is a highly tedious, subjective and manually time-consuming (to the level of impracticality for some data) process that is based on intuition rather than standardized statistical inference. This study proposes a pipeline for automatic analysis of FCM data. The proposed pipeline identifies biomarkers that correlate with physiological/pathological conditions and classifies the samples to specific pathological/physiological entities. The pipeline utilizes a model-based clustering approach to identify cell populations that share similar biological functions. Support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF) classifiers were then used to classify the samples and identify biomarkers associated with disease status. The performance of the proposed data analysis pipeline has been evaluated on lymphoma patients. Preliminary results show more than 90% accuracy in differentiating between some sub-types of lymphoma. The proposed pipeline also finds biologically meaningful biomarkers that differ between lymphoma subtypes.","inCitations":["ba5842ffacb4074e51d069378ad326f4a0ae2f05","2e50c785af300080b840200a175516c8f1c06e3c","9b36aec2dfb73e158231eaae54d1a336c7992cea","910c8bf27a833c807e83e09dc9ac2f8ee3d967f9","6c1cb7465500e66abba0d170c877b00bae80104d","30cf08ae554d47971e2d8281d9d374df4ca193de"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"A Pipeline for automated analysis of flow cytometry data: Preliminary results on lymphoma sub-type diagnosis","doi":"10.1109/IEMBS.2009.5332710","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEMBS.2009.5332710","venue":"2009 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society"}

First, Beier-Neely field morphing and linear affine transformation were applied in geometric standardization for whole body and partial region respectively. Gray levels of pixel population at the same anatomical position were statistically analyzed for abnormal region classification. Morphological closing and opening operations were used to identify unified abnormal regions. Three types of 25 feature parameters (i.e. 10 geometric, 7 topological and 8 thermal) were extracted for parametric factor analysis. Positive and negative abnormal regions were further reclassified by decision trees to induce the case-based diagnostic rules. Finally, anatomical organ matching was utilized to identify the corresponding organ with the positive abnormal regions. To verify the validity of the proposed case-based diagnostic protocol, 71 and 131 female patients with and without breast cancer were analyzed. Experimental results indicated that 1750 abnormal regions (703 positive and 1047 negative) were detected and 822 branches were broken down into the decision space. Fourteen branches were found to have more than 4 positive abnormal regions. These critical diagnostic paths with less than 10% of positive abnormal regions (61/703=8.6%) can effectively classify more than half of the cancer patients (42/71=59.2%) in the abovementioned 14 branches.","inCitations":["5e10803ebaf6c4990d6c81fb256d9fb5c22a6585","f0f256abec9d120bf528443d78069e244067e2e0","512d5b0c1cdcfda4f5a11828eabb5352d668496b","786fc4d0a5ccc4cf1fd77897d97adf3abfc9ad45","9480cf229b77c1991ba10e9fe060e3ab7a1c1f49","2f292d26c6ad2cd3332606a08d0b4fde84404f25","141685adb090043054dd286572a56b520938b18c","9c5f1533fdbac60e4cb498aee651e6002711e601","ef1e514d0409418a92e60895995db93ca1274a17","98d8afc89d044e20929f56ce0d4c2640e6ab6991","202640bf248a939afffad6bd0422e408f85c3531","1ca58f9e139c00e781a7809da4f3d18eba503d5b","2bb935088eed22e21b75c1ae63a17c61f6b48d6b","3aae585cbb23b13f16626a3b4f8d5562b2c50768","eb7f763fab26029ef710c4a4771baa8d6e60bccf","c9769af8012e8286513fe6d293054154851b1369","fa6c5148448bbe30622a696d1fc3dc65a4eed414","9793824beb4e54f049da93abb6086e76d46e3a21","5d0b77626d866bda21cf7b88fdb209b0a7b2d272","f17f0b6ce70a3f24c2c9dedbfee125b11ed2d952","0f7db7addc20939fc85371ff02de05ea3fc6e75e","8711fe62a3213688bf59938a2fc4bab892f00ba9","91905e023f6398fbfa3e143df8ee95763fcfd2cf","bc7ab655e7e368152da68250cdcfcebfc8f4e539"],"pdfUrls":["https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q51560716"],"title":"Entropy-based feature extraction and decision tree induction for breast cancer diagnosis with standardized thermograph images","doi":"10.1016/j.cmpb.2010.04.014","sources":["DBLP","Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmpb.2010.04.014","venue":"Comput.

It is shown that achieving quality of PT results in the framework of the concept “tested once, accepted everywhere” requires both metrological comparability and compatibility of these results. The possibility of assessing collective/group performance of PT participants by comparison of the PT consensus value (mean or median of the PT results) with the certified value of the test items is analyzed.

Univariable linear regressions were conducted to examine predictors of average hours of nightly PAP use. Univariable logistic regressions were conducted to examine predictors of PAP adherence using the conventional clinical definition of ≥4 h per night ≥70% of the time. Persons with traumatic etiology were separately analyzed.\n\n\nRESULTS\nABI etiology was 51% traumatic, 36% stroke, and 13% other nontraumatic causes. Nearly two-thirds were nonadherent to PAP. For the overall sample, higher average nightly PAP usage was significantly predicted by positive hypertension diagnosis (β = 0.271, p = 0.019). Likewise, greater adherence based on the conventional cutoff was predicted by poorer motor functioning at hospital admission (OR = 0.98, p = 0.001) and lower oxygen saturation nadir (OR = 0.99, p = 0.003). For those with traumatic injuries, greater adherence was predicted by poorer functional status at hospital admission (OR = 0.98, p = 0.010) and positive hypertension diagnosis (OR = 0.16, p = 0.023).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn this study of hospitalized neurorehabilitation patients with ABI and comorbid OSA, predictors of adherence included lower oxygen saturation, poorer functional status and hypertension diagnosis, perhaps signifying the role of greater severity of illness on treatment adherence. High rates of refusal and nonadherence to frontline PAP therapy for sleep apnea is a concern for persons in recovery form ABI who are at a time of critical neural repair.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Incidence and predictors of adherence to sleep apnea treatment in rehabilitation inpatients with acquired brain injury.","doi":"10.1016/j.sleep.2020.01.016","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sleep.2020.01.016","venue":"Sleep medicine"}

Data were collected on a random 5% sample of the Danish population aged 16-78 years during a 15-year period (1980-94) and analysed with conditional logistic regression.\n\n\nFINDINGS\n811 cases of suicide were found and 79871 controls were chosen in this population. Unemployment, low income, being single, and a history of mental illness necessitating hospital admission were associated with increased risk of suicide. However, in the multivariate analysis, the strongest risk factor was mental illness necessitating hospital admission; risk of suicide was especially high during admission (relative risk 62.6 [95% CI 41.1-95.4]) and during the year after discharge (6.51 [5.03-8.44]). The effect of socioeconomic variables decreased after adjustment for history of mental illness. The population attributable risk associated with mental illness necessitating admission to hospital was 44.6% (43.6-45.5); the attributable risks associated with the other factors were 3.0% (1.4-6.6) for unemployment and 10.3% (6.13-16.9) for being single.\n\n\nINTERPRETATION\nSuicide prevention aimed at patients who are admitted to hospital with mental disorders and improved detection and treatment of mental disorders in the general population may be the most efficient strategy to decrease risk of suicide. Reports of high relative risk and attributable risk associated with unemployment and other socioeconomic risk factors may be confounded and overestimated owing to the lack of adjustment for the association with mental disorders.","inCitations":["b6801ea907faca55fb91df040438f13cf9ea3abd","2f56340b61202b7c55c5ffdc7ca6bb60a2e93fb0","fee1a0f804a25c564a559cc6c5ebd43f3f4127b6","f57ac0c33a3393fb7ca9a6b96dd03f1b7054a4d2","016d3018618be3c7ee03aa1d2ec3aabf203dc236","3d6f07c5d8628328d01ab885589a74ad22ef6b31","89a0468efc93b46db7521a850fdba4a035f68e61","996b55356dc828028d74986075659cdc7a59fdde","68f43a649a64cf45e1e3600a677a9528a5c2ad44","59f5ce9d18c1dcf81e39ab09a1711c7d558bb5c5","f43efc315db01ce08c1dc80e9bb5726e57f4e8b8","0f0caf02ad58005c54dd94386650bea0dbea1eb7","f13689de813867f8d58c648dbce5a715ca5e6d58","a226c104a816f84a32c76be2a44e26a4662a299b","703877467f67ccb948d091e00ea50ac1c0c782e2","8ff8a2e17ebb958b8f0569d588e09507bf3f0f2b","7852c793c9d18eef5fb839e03d86a731f7e5ef0e","703c69475a44943241281a3594f9481a3a870a84","e983faabef49308ef0e4070ee8240a90878c9ac0","b934aac458d736d751fba7d9238b114450b1890f","b6fef8d7857204b1594bec6fecb56ae235478f25","d55293e6d5fc0059d1a256bfa9184f25f2b4ccbb","bd6937873dd26b9a7600775a1071e7b0d9e168d2","74c1d162daf39a98d3e9b0f539de5139fcc56da5","ce5cc46895d1e05bf6ed42c150693f57eea57c09","c7b9824445ee5a5ad84248a622d97b0d3cdba2a8","4b78f74be5b6da0fcbd15293d0301029448c2d42","5f81c3fa53949ce0600e2b7435f526e7ba15f262","d6477d61ed72c28413a14b97c2d0fe0e04d11293","9bc3f0baf8c7c698857371568c23de0715d1718c","53b35dd99aa2e8f484891f69975792593f2f1cc3","585374181e887c22ed892bd85aedfa7e2daf232e","a7e7c2a68559e03abd4c3b715208c9b7aa3de4de","d5b28fbe68fb6370e52b7c2abce9fb3296210652","30b68c3448a6d03046a96d85402eb3dd530a80b3","d6e2b65adb3b39f90a43a59cfa315aaf70a608fc","e5465db0d59eb4fd01f24cee240cf3c9c0403ce8","ea846719981c10f0d2a411d7ceaaf0afa6240e0a","0b67a261cacdb30971988bf6629f08ff39347c2e","55f17fc60687e33301fcc08e6e525c93725a8971","61066f9eda08e7334b493ec2a0e56912bf3c06f6","32ebab27f56660dd4858d81782c3dac79a13a843","6338a6b81c3767663fd617b930948976b5e5853b","42e6a5cb0c47507a25b0798ea61ad0f98982ab01","69d8c46c6808e42014c423f29c46d0dd76dbd648","27e5364895ec642a4cf0fbbdea234ea6da635408","8a436b9645efe612860264b1eb9e960da24e7a3a","655bc887b22009c2885149fdaf3e0f0126cd4e9e","506cb8389b67602f3f2b02d587c5fe61be304139","8cd5d9bb35490f3dcce42155a6caac8de1781e9c","f798b9cffebaea02cb9aaa8cf38d704cb5b697c8","2a2671341270d4a7f3585fec085bd943bbb53919","44f87c6fa90f4880bb7dc0b714403a342bcd026e","242d8a038b9b1a111e10bd1df19f4cce75369e9b","952b3f8e9cfcf00d14298ee55894ec20b3f52089","4acbbcfa33edb2010dffe838393ef7f1eee0ff1f","718fe8754d23e7843bcc1d3408190b87807e4575","76e541e41c6eee98cfebfe630ce6e73d8ff961b1","55a55773d36cb39c5ec2531dfe97de7f8cc94f82","1f6ef52fc19acda22bf50aed23510ed06378c1a9","32ef8b106e4141df1dc423a094c771a5b17befa3","369c37dd0058e8b52b7a250eb41d95beff517c25","bb4f868a4b84ca1fddb192f46caad064ccc12121","a3faaa4757e560698adffddd40084ca30111edcd","9b2bf9afe27fed86ae149594f7d3aa6a2acd4d1a","6134ec96a5736082489ca99cdab231ee31665f15","a2055112396478bb54d713e710845c5eb1a60eab","b00a734cdc26e1ee70cdf8bc5dce6cb85e4c1a5e","0fae21eae30b089a754682b35322df93d89442f4","463aea812dba1c6d6e6c84fd797fa2e9d128c763","18be30b1a9e1e61b3f61a6f16fb30fd02754a155","e2917731e210f6b5149ba30af44a75f9a0bbff20","8aa0324080f657a3d15d0bd93f0dfc8a98c2e6cc","d55ce9816aaab038bf6233f31e625059036e269a","f2034115440f29a321e07064b7574f4057233bc9","61d5ff45929d993d386fab4161d9d5c8aac7b23d","a7eca281a9c29f2612a8764994d4d3d74281aeac","03e268536e3e87e04858d29cccc6c6d8fd384045","db4e7f7f424c09a4794cb450c6be7964e47720b5","21e0765c204facccba5bef1b724c675a4e7bad5f","fae28fa79f55953db8c1084282e6a6d61128a152","936b232e5cd430c2d7f9e5f3f190abc42f7d001a","5b7dda770e557c8af8cfffb3c9eae1dd799e8fef","ce80cc4494708753c0b3d72cd9e056b39abaea9d","bee38c5f28dc1329ee73b8d463932db8faaba1b9","fe5e40a683152d828c60ffe3d0db9695ffb020b7","80479d5993eaf59a959bcbeb6b934c0ded311732","973b87298ae496de2d04ced0068c7cd3e40d7181","617377dab0f2c7780fdad76f33fb9569e45bd91e","b8ec5af1805a637cf0d913535ed8acc912e56752","a52affa9cbba027bdce5d5e9b2719083a126844b","f81832dc282edd6aee6972da765c8862d1cd4a7c","0c73514337b3b216c8af37291d0d5793f35739a1","a17c11a6ca065221791a83615e8395fa6892be01","68913b8e0c96eb4f5f394440569936b117585128","d78fab6d362dde1ac7bea1357b2d1d004d638ae1","d5821dbb7ad03f27c664541639233c2632509bbc","d793fdd65170a34ff4d8bc28ce49f60bc76a02b6","c3ed3e524ee063d062d3c324c01c3ca51957f6dd","a860ae0d819a6302b110d58d749fec82948ce7b5","596e0561369de3602cd36285b5800c8c05aa9a94","06eea78069501b5936eacaf5075d2e9a3af15ce1","33bdbd0a90b886a228756d2c78eab8996aabc9af","9ba5997d20a6698d942113bd14727117312caa16","002cabf4487a0a8dcad442f7a97b71a17d22d997","6497db21b3d433fb8a52a5d40c063676422a9b8d","d4589cb29c15e12f0023c7e204d27e1d3ecd3d10","8237f05020eeb174c183f2d75026f44b9c27cb7a","cc12d497b2cb182b47741b124306f3d21152ee88","a610a0ea1915fd62fddea397a6d488a0181994bb","10717a0bc48a231fbe3787a082eb284697582086","904835c7bff25f278a17abba3fb1909987d6a2e8","cd8acc7d5ec0414dadc174c1af9e0798ffb6f0ad","1f5961db16abbce1f55d5942482183a36e6f7d36","56b4c298914635e1ba80d7ed537b462710711695","77b323c31c6ef86218b363cbcb9

This study was aimed at investigating the impact of climate change on three river basins in China, Ethiopia and Norway using WASMOD and HBV hydrological models.Design/methodology/approach – First, hydrological models' parameters were determined using current hydro‐climatic data inputs. Second, the historical time series of climatic data was adjusted according to the climate change scenarios. Third, the hydrological characteristics of the catchments under the adjusted climatic conditions were simulated using the calibrated hydrological models.

However, this technique can be technically difficult, especially in patients suffering from severe stenosis. The contralateral decompression from a unilateral approach can result in durotomy during removal of the hypertrophied ligamentum flavum. This complication can be difficult to treat through a small working channel. Objective To detail our group's operative experience with the CO2 laser and discuss our results and previous studies in the literature reporting results.  Methods The CO2 laser (Omniguide, Boston, MA) was investigated in the surgical ablation of the contralateral ligamentum flavum during minimally invasive laminectomies. Forty levels have been investigated thus far. The amount of voltage needed to adequately desiccate and remove the ligamentum flavum safely as well as the effectiveness of this technique were investigated. Results The contralateral ligamentum flavum could be removed effectively using the 9 to 11 watt continuous wavelength (10,600 nanometer) power setting on the CO2 laser. Shrinkage of the contralateral ligamentum flavum facilitated its removal using a number 2 Kerrison Punch. No durotomies occurred, and the use of the laser did not significantly lengthen operative times.  Conclusions The CO2 laser appears to be a useful tool in the armamentarium of instruments available to the minimally invasive spine surgeon and may help to reduce the incidence of durotomies when performing minimally invasive laminectomies.","inCitations":["28dce64ad676f388414462155a6b2e36c85db1ec"],"pdfUrls":["https://assets.cureus.com/uploads/technical_report/pdf/4423/1566921532-20190827-4106-1ptmhut.pdf","http://assets.cureus.com/uploads/technical_report/pdf/4423/1464917678-20160603-5436-1tk5i9g.pdf","https://assets.cureus.com/uploads/technical_report/pdf/4423/1511804925-20171127-4802-6lqr4n.pdf","https://assets.cureus.com/uploads/technical_report/pdf/4423/1507141991-20171004-4-11jbh5v.pdf"],"title":"Application of the Flexible CO2 Laser in Minimally Invasive Laminectomies: Technical Note","doi":"10.7759/cureus.628","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.628","venue":"Cureus"}

Based on expression profiling technology, targetable tumor-associated antigens (TAA) are identified and exploited for engineered T-cell therapy. Here, the specific recognition and lytic potential of transgenic allo-restricted CD8(+) T cells, directed against the ES-associated antigen 6-transmembrane epithelial antigen of the prostate 1 (STEAP1), was examined. Following repetitive STEAP1(130) peptide-driven stimulations with HLA-A*02:01(+) dendritic cells (DC), allo-restricted HLA-A*02:01(-) CD8(+) T cells were sorted with HLA-A*02:01/peptide multimers and expanded by limiting dilution. After functional analysis of suitable T cell clones via ELISpot, flow cytometry and xCELLigence assay, T cell receptors' (TCR) α- and β-chains were identified, cloned into retroviral vectors, codon optimized, transfected into HLA-A*02:01(-) primary T cell populations and tested again for specificity and lytic capacity in vitro and in a Rag2(-/-)γc(-/-) mouse model. Initially generated transgenic T cells specifically recognized STEAP1(130)-pulsed or transfected cells in the context of HLA-A*02:01 with minimal cross-reactivity as determined by specific interferon-γ (IFNγ) release, lysed cells and inhibited growth of HLA-A*02:01(+) ES lines more effectively than HLA-A*02:01(-) ES lines. In vivo tumor growth was inhibited more effectively with transgenic STEAP1(130)-specific T cells than with unspecific T cells. Our results identify TCRs capable of recognizing and inhibiting growth of STEAP1-expressing HLA-A*02:01(+) ES cells in vitro and in vivo in a highly restricted manner. As STEAP1 is overexpressed in a wide variety of cancers, we anticipate these STEAP1-specific TCRs to be potentially useful for immunotherapy of other STEAP1-expressing tumors.","inCitations":["d65ac3b18f730a77b8c19f673d4bfdca9e244f3a","101492eb9d693bb4ef0ee72a02c0fcce901abffa","b2700c2e4e54cc15a5d24bf3e9747ac3fd1abdd4","20b6b23bcb4a9c95a21aa3eb398c0822025488c3","9a8a78bb24056915f1bffcddf76e6b6874c4048e","21f76060e2c2284003aeb72e24c6f9103fa54f3a","c9e95a7f0e2b31b29817f37e05632680646fe39a","712e1eea364184ee108337d1c91ef715836b9f21","ce16ef8d4f620bb158a0fc4e107b395e6f977e91"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Transgenic antigen-specific, HLA-A*02:01-allo-restricted cytotoxic T cells recognize tumor-associated target antigen STEAP1 with high specificity.","doi":"10.1080/2162402X.2016.1175795","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1080/2162402X.2016.1175795","venue":"Oncoimmunology"}

Averaged glacier mass balance for these II years appears to be -55 g cm 2 year-1 according to stake measurements, and -51 g cm 2 year-1 according to geodetic measurements. The variability of accumulation is estimated as Cv = 0.15 and of ablation as Cv = 0.11. Thus, the variation in accumulation governs the oscillations in glacier balance. The inner nourishment of the glacier was also taken into account. The glacier mass balance is closely related to the relation between the accumulation and ablation areas . The \"transient\" values of both figures during the whole period of ablation can be used for this relation . The forms of the accumulation and ablation fields are similar from year to year and from one 10 day period to another. The areas of the accumulation and ablation zones are very different from one year to another. On the contrary, the average specific balance for each zone changes very little. One can use these features for the construction of accumulation , ablation, and specific mass-balance maps from satellite imagery. Mean values for the mass-balance terms occur in the vicinity of the equilibrium line. They can be calculated by using the air temperatures.

Transmission of one such infectious disease, human T-lymphotropic virus (HTLV), is related to the transfer of HTLV-infected, viable leukocytes of sufficient number. The ability to characterize allograft tissue as being absent of leukocytes, or containing relatively few leukocytes, by using a specific test has not been previously investigated. A quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) test was developed to interrogate protein tyrosine phosphatase, receptor type C (PTPRC) gene expression in tissue samples and was able to determine the number of leukocytes present in a tissue. The impact of a qualified leukocyte tissue testing method should be significant and lead to changes in donor eligibility regulations in certain countries. Human leukapheresis samples were used as a control to establish the amount of PTPRC in leukocytes. That value was used as a comparator to determine the number of leukocyte equivalents in tissues of interest. The qPCR test measured tissue leukocyte equivalents and the results were consistent with the relative abundance of leukocytes predicted for each tissue. Using qPCR to calculate leukocyte equivalents based upon PTPRC gene expression can be successfully employed to estimate the number of leukocytes in a tissue or allograft. This method could be used as a screen to rule out tissues that do not meet the criteria of being leukocyte rich and, therefore, do not need direct HTLV testing.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://www.karger.com/Article/Pdf/355138"],"title":"A Quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction Test to Enumerate Leukocytes in Allograft Tissue and the Implications for Donor Eligibility Testing","doi":"10.1159/000355138","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1159/000355138","venue":"Cells Tissues Organs"}

TRIF (adaptor protein of Toll-like receptor 3)-mediated and Cardif (adaptor protein of RIG-I or MDA5)-mediated signaling pathways contribute rapid induction of interferon-beta through the activation of interferon regulatory factor-3 (IRF-3). Previously, it has been reported that the hepatitis C virus NS3-4A serine protease blocks virus-induced activation of IRF-3 in the human hepatoma cell line HuH-7, and that NS3-4A cleaves TRIF and Cardif molecules, resulting in the interruption of antiviral signaling pathways. On the other hand, it has recently been reported that non-neoplastic human hepatocyte PH5CH8 cells retain robust TRIF- and Cardif-mediated pathways, unlike HuH-7 cells, which lack a TRIF-mediated pathway. In the present study, we further investigated the effect of NS3-4A on antiviral signaling pathways. Although we confirmed that PH5CH8 cells were much more effective than HuH-7 cells for the induction of interferon-beta, we obtained the unexpected result that NS3-4A could not suppress the interferon-beta production induced by the TRIF-mediated pathway, although it suppressed the Cardif-mediated pathway by cleaving Cardif at the Cys508 residue. Using PH5CH8, HeLa, and HuH-7-derived cells, we further showed that NS3-4A could not cleave TRIF, in disagreement with a previous report describing the cleavage of TRIF by NS3-4A. Taken together, our findings suggest that the blocking of the interferon production by NS3-4A is not sufficient in HCV-infected hepatocyte cells.","inCitations":["18a9b676580eb30667e0b2d162b62916dc95e92a","f9f203d8d5dbe9aba344f651284c2bb017fb0cbd","ac95e92165e9376b7f2f7a39c80aaee887541707","ba3df4b04826d625eeeee84b775225d415e407e1","93d80da9fa2cdb47f4ff0ff3510a166c8e9ca9b0","f568c97c952fb0ec84d3be0c165e1b742fc1818c","da78cf1faa536acc67a72b945c1d1fc81f0251ef","5943487599c6dad8b9e739935512ceb2492fd8e0","2c70a1bcfcad5a7f544aa048b6e084ba5f422514","6bf14174d222722d489ed015ae13d835e1e122dd","21e6f122b7069e7fddec0933cae83d82f32c1330","a83873c34deb1353128d64ad374f7ccb81d94668","9e0beede89bf1e66cb97214a6a33c2d47b6c45e8","17f7ce84273bc3db7571ebe95839440fc64b111b","4239009cbdc7a33ee19ef75e96dd6fffa18904e2","ba32a5e264fe03e093e7cf319e42a7697688fd78","ee445e05be28e6a595d765eea62a332a2cbb4f4f","f1baaf321d7e5f343ae00beda3f3a2177b85bbf4","22bed26a82a97c5b2152cafc486b6097aacfe163","3fdfad6f9289089c5f499f8771894b539b0d2446","36bbf2f5c105a70486b04675edd6539a2ff78200","00a0410d0104ea6091b7390cfbb6cccdff87d6e7","250585592ca6c18879f42860102791d0a14cf283","2aedca2ff5c361eb9254d02966d4289c12119646","6026050bd23d523a511a6eca3bb5ac98800716e8","5611a849e6b87ac9049d31b9aa8f7c3b6948434b","1c872fcfbb8ae99f46e4841355c9e3d9749c03ab","5ee32a84f80647ee0f911d9fab87f00197fba723","327b58816dadedfb94f4b2635a8cf88a94c3f8c8"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Limited suppression of the interferon-beta production by hepatitis C virus serine protease in cultured human hepatocytes.","doi":"10.1111/j.1742-4658.2007.05942.x","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1742-4658.2007.05942.x","venue":"The FEBS journal"}

In order to improve the performance of the turbine at low wind speed, starting time was combined with output power in an objective function and a three-bladed, 2 m diameter rotor was designed and optimized for those regions using a purpose-built genetic algorithm. The Blade-Element Momentum (BEM) theory was employed to calculate the output power and a modified version was used to determine the starting time in the presence of a small, but significant resistive torque. The optimization procedure maximized a combination of the output power in terms of the power coefficient and the starting time. Results show that the performance of a blade optimized for sea level degrades for other locations and that degradation is more important for the starting performance than the power coefficient. In order to improve the performance of the blade at the different altitudes, the optimization process was performed in two steps. First, the geometry of the blade was optimized for the air density at the appropriate altitude that increased both the power coefficient and the starting time. Much more power was achieved using the second step in which the tip speed ratio was optimized along with the geometry of the blade in the optimization procedure. The results highlight the importance of the drive train and generator resistive torque which delays the starting of the wind turbine especially at very high altitudes as the aerodynamic torque is reduced.","inCitations":["c539a7168227d5ba344d4def3ddff7cfe82760c8","222b3e18ccc15802cf295a52dc946665e75edecd","a4c46550b7b29ff19586c30cf54b91f46fe6f5b9","f3e0c7fef26392609075148f2807d6f1824500c6","5ee6a47c7885e1b9619f5c5f84bab913b6b71b47","296c9f4ffd767ccac03fc87536bb9eb1d2c20037","20692cafb7edafdcb7e668900e6af59c94d8a83f","aca00aeb5d9878ea165f2eef590ff47a9d558256","33e8362b02e6dcff7c9105d2c89cb58049173f66","86cbba91b4602e2fea10aaccbccb8cbc43e53398","b5658208b53c8de5c0244c4127a7963d5f732d4e","e9944a40db1f80d946b92c2312d96ba7dc98b15d","e8c416438c15d95aeda72133c5af65766f758a6a","f252d4f837c7214fef030b7e9e2c48694adbb7b9","1ccc43fe3147b819e7dd3e515df0fac0a2348ba4","91c2dc7088c0125bc061821682fccf9556a1812d","e99541618ebcc42ccde7d7c4eedb85ce23b63049","a64d6e7c0b0fcbd91528319be75e0b213b49dd00"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Effect of air density on the performance of a small wind turbine blade: A case study in Iran","doi":"10.1016/j.jweia.2014.01.001","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jweia.2014.01.001","venue":""}

The resulting preparations of 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase have a specific activity of between 200 and 600 nmol.min-1.mg-1 protein, representing an approximately 5000-fold purification of the enzyme. The purified 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase has a molecular weight of 853,000 +/- 34,000 and is composed of two types of subunits, a biotin-containing subunit of 80 +/- 2 kDa and a non-biotin-containing subunit of 58.5 +/- 1.5 kDa. These data suggest that the enzyme has an alpha 6 beta 6 configuration. The optimum pH for activity is 8.0. The kinetic constants for the substrates 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA, ATP, and HCO3- are 11 microM, 20 microM, and 0.8 mM, respectively. Kinetic studies of the 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase reaction with variable concentrations of two substrates confirmed that ATP and HCO3- bind sequentially to the enzyme and that ATP and 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA bind in ping-pong fashion. However, similar analyses indicate that the binding of HCO3- at the first site is affected by 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA. Kinetic studies of the role of Mg2+ in the 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase reaction establish that Mg.ATP is the substrate for the enzyme, that free ATP is an inhibitor, and that free Mg2+ is an activator. Both Mn2+ and Co2+ can substitute somewhat for Mg2+, but Zn2+ is unable to do so. In addition to carboxylating 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA, the maize carboxylase can carboxylate crotonyl-CoA, but not acetoacetyl-CoA. In fact, acetoacetyl-CoA is a potent, noncompetitive inhibitor, which indicates that the enzyme contains an acetoacetyl-CoA binding site that is independent of the active sites. The monovalent cations K+, Cs+, Rb+, and NH4+ activated 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase activity, with Rb+ being the most potent activator. The inhibition of 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase by sulfhydryl and arginyl modifying reagents could be partly alleviated by the substrates ATP and 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA, which suggests that sulfhydryl and arginyl residues may be involved in catalysis.","inCitations":["805852a7ecac17d4791e286ab273ba7f57274b58","415e93688cd93e1d524f31a5bd4b1508dbf12648","c4efafb2f420168c461a432ba7f6d3b9053fd354","ac40d9c27e314176006a573d94352c82ddc12c13","884855f133294a710a2e3c7aaaa532f376e263c3","5679326e901c8f55a9c3b629f82180eab9c56aca","fac537193315ac8438e844f2810628d865626fe3","424927691f994fc4523804ed74af5baee59605dc"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Purification and characterization of 3-methylcrotonyl-coenzyme-A carboxylase from leaves of Zea mays.","doi":"10.1006/abbi.1994.1141","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1006/abbi.1994.1141","venue":"Archives of biochemistry and biophysics"}

In a vaccine perspective, and especially in the context of the development of an A conjugate vaccine; it is the key to strengthen the surveillance systems and to include molecular epidemiology as a tool for monitoring the molecular evolution of Neisseria meningitidis in Africa.","inCitations":["45169952f5d89cfac80b255303cade9f13422631","88ac0f7e52f1bcc3f07ab402df16b1f89352775e","74f68f01913347356fe08f925471df5f759fb70e","b36f7125ca1bd6a2f3f78cb984c610ea5ec81bdc","fb74d0304252968dcc8ea39297e0de537580cc97","11524e398acc776bfb89fd4cdea2267649947be7","8cd407b19841b46aee9fe3fee754c4894b989ec8","0eb481b241b2d45fb1aa851711521ca576bffe89","c6947bccb87f9c9360abc7eaccd423125730414c","e372a094043e80c390cd24e74e1140ae3b60b339","9f83a49fd7668dc5fd65bca9d800cc8d949f94fa","6181dbfa43a15cb84b15bb1fc51ff919f1f79a51","253bf24fbf589822f0a55729e8fceaac3553e13e","71e10da61d57a4895b8893968f05fcdbda152298","d6c5c1106c9c1c63075f6b603cbd74d8a88a027c","27d65d4f1c98914dc407f8e0c5300b0afa729e97","d16a8416bc0db4e893d5639490dc3e0df2403ca1","77523a21697a6ffb390dfea0cb770a15ec16cb8c","15f33d0368471d960194b68ff61601dcc863f64a","fda415a17f62ba184f939cb88eb80793ed0b9771","68d57de44844aa3e45c6b404237739826fc0cdfa","af9236e8a600ab2a47d229b001c59af3b74ea62e","ccc5a290c61f3eb9dd4c36f85d9f382e632e40d0","52487357b4dd3a83ffa29e2c2849b978d49683fa","30b6454a05679073349c12c53d376d374c31197e","bd21326f2b81e4b7c47d975452bae78b78f44988","6724b5cb0deddec19bc07f0a71f90d6bffd91538","a413f9eb7a1f5cbe1e457736eb1a544e94ccb090","387857af63501e79ceb753448200e8e7007567ff","a314cf8d084a9d1edaaa4f20bdbee3f852cdbb36","eb6fbcab7d9fa0edc106e2bef5bbb55687ace9c1","ea87a9bacd71fcf2544063bf4d34fb7a861c1297","6b85e89d871b56f9645398ac95a90fabb3a2707b","3701e4f1064893b068bc97a0b8f914aac6cfd24e","11d1683f704041a16b978948554acffd0af2a540","6eb12b0ef52efe58bf4c0c15c7a7c3721730f6be","ba5eaa40d6b7852b8a1df53d612dbd13b8a95d92","aa940dd5efdede4a90cc98cfc4a140b652fc3a8d","622dfecd6a267cd1d83a8c353e4822931ce0fcce","2fe42cd9c764e4624ad3be35f9a7cbed660126ec","bdfd9e1f52f3cebe54e6f644a7cbd6c89ba569b9","7c3a4bdc2d406bb705a759f526169a495faf5b19","702390ae29634d1bf13c888064900932056ec588","4be8f006242677f9d8ecfad9dbbc1b8a357642c0","a7de5db897150f2af6fd57516523e0810029e47e","600db28c1d2b59b99b1262bf9e44676c00a875d6","133b176859dc93fac542b69f3d0e8fcefc62ac0d"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Meningitis epidemics in Africa: a brief overview.","doi":"10.1016/j.vaccine.2007.04.032","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2007.04.032","venue":"Vaccine"}

Exposure of Hp to lansoprazole led to extensive loss of viability and suppression of virulence factors such as motility, adhesiveness to epithelial cells, and urease activity. Lansoprazole produced aberrant bacterial morphology characterized by elongation and constriction of the cells and collapse of cell surface structures. The combination of lansoprazole with antimicrobial agents such as penicillins, cephalosporins, macrolides, tetracyclines, aminoglycosides, quinolones, and metronidazole produced an additive or synergistic growth inhibition of Hp.","inCitations":["4c77249fc35c7a69478b033fbf7737380e6edc59","86751fd9071079ec8262b8986d7e10d520421e9e","9f4a9c574a784ec473dcbf02c0dd4601eb58a8fb","6d3858cb82d2856e9eeb0dcca1b9dc5bc3dc1235"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Antibacterial properties of lansoprazole alone and in combination with antimicrobial agents against Helicobacter pylori.","doi":"10.1007/bf02114894","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/bf02114894","venue":"Journal of clinical gastroenterology"}

These patients were referred for selective vertebral and subclavian artery angiography. All patients (17 men, 11 women; mean age of 64 years, range 54-87) had critical lesions (> 70% stenosis) in the vertebral or pre-vertebral subclavian arteries or both. After confirmation of the severity of the lesions and feasibility for revascularization, all these patients underwent percutaneous intervention and stent placement. All patients were followed-up through clinic visits for a mean of 14.2 months, (range 3.5-24.3).\n\n\nRESULTS\nIn our 28 patients that were treated, 25 vertebral and 10 subclavian stents were placed. Success (< 20% residual diameter stenosis, without stroke or death) was achieved in 27 patients (96%). One patient undergoing intervention for an ostial subtotal occlusion of the left subclavian artery, developed a minor posterior fossa transient ischemic attack. At follow-up, 25 patients (89%) were alive and 22 (88%) of those had no further neurologic complaints. Three (11%) patients that had vertebral artery stents, died during follow-up from cardiac complications, unrelated to the neurovascular intervention. One patient (3.5%) had recurrent symptoms with in-stent restenosis at 6 months with successful balloon angioplasty and resolution of symptoms. The two other patients with persistent symptoms (only dizziness) had no evidence of restenosis and underwent further work-up that has not clarified the etiology.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nPosterior fossa ischemia is an under-diagnosed condition that occurs with relative frequency in cardiac patients. Awareness of this condition and adequate non-invasive testing permits identification of these patients. Endovascular treatment using coronary wires and stents including drug eluting stents, seems to be the treatment of choice for vertebral artery revascularization due to the high technical success rate, low complication rate, and long-term durability.","inCitations":["097f9325f824d59d78d2a6b06582b889ae2adca2","b60bae081325795029af5ba44144e18bffb2f3c5","7de11e5a55ee2e0cf6d9196b9fc74b0a92e1f9a5","a46b417371954d678f82b766966d9058c52c3890","585411fcce85632b8008ca45afbfebfc105b9c5f","c24b8a39d625b1d0356c9b80bd0921a5b847f6df","6c150be9b7dd7244171b33a6ce096844270edbe3","7b205fb30f2480e0ca329451274af9ce09012982","7e540f257654cb9257bc85ea8ddab4a3249e9793"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Percutaneous intervention for posterior fossa ischemia.

Immunocytochemical methods were used to detect cell proliferation by 5-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation, and FN organization [i.e. diffuse in the extracellular matrix and organized in fibrils or in focal adhesions (FA)] in human fibroblast cultures. Cell proliferation rates were related to FN arrangement and in particular a higher percentage of cells in the S-phase was related to a predominance of FA. The greatest difference in behaviour compared to that of the controls was detected after 120 and 168 hr: at these times, as well as at previous ones, the alloy with the highest Au content seemed the most biocompatible among those tested, as it behaved in a very similar way to the controls. In contrast, fibroblasts exposed to the other five alloys showed different behaviours from the controls. It is assumed that a correlation exists between FN organization and the percentage of BrdU-positive cells, and that these features vary in the presence of different alloys. The observation of FN arrangement together with cell proliferation rates could be another useful tool in determining the biocompatibility of dental metal alloys.","inCitations":["6eafb96a84c6788594ff46f0051ae84e982e154a","c2cae1f748fd7e644dacdb5273766c7a1d166176","d48f2726f3354d302624187d34b5f4f7b499f2c2","3452699b3ab06d7252d1323774ffb97d6654bed2","7468ad2c7eef1cbdb03a24aa81360d0ccb4d7184","ecc9c10707cad4a5a33b246fe4c6eacb10c2ff0c","3adfe8c6e93f0ab7b1635664a47d7b4fb1ce5a8a","a7554e6937f3230aa90a603fdeeeac5b66ad47c0","7fa71c05985ff186052be739c5dbd8713afd1169","dc15fb60086ab7fd7c2b6372032dc07a12ec37f3","6852b71cb65a9004b1121787e3766518b03c4b40","8f3e64404536bfd4999497ec6c5e44d7b927e5db"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"The influence of dental metal alloys on cell proliferation and fibronectin arrangement in human fibroblast cultures.","doi":"10.1016/S0003-9969(97)00055-1","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/S0003-9969%2897%2900055-1","venue":"Archives of oral biology"}

With the increased usage of P2P applications on mobile devices, its battery life has become of significant concern. In this paper, we propose a novel mechanism for energy adaptation in P2P file sharing protocols to significantly enhance the possibility of a client completing the file download before exhausting its battery. The underlying idea is to group mobile clients based on their energy budget and impose restrictions on bandwidth usage and hence on energy consumption. This allows us to provide favoured treatment to low energy devices, while still ensuring long-term fairness through a credit based mechanism and preventing free riding. Furthermore, we show how the proposed mechanism can be implemented in a popular P2P file sharing application, the BitTorrent protocol and analyze it through a comprehensive set of simulations.","inCitations":["92b7197fd417abc13daa0e767b6a1fd555ac8d7b","97de3d9c4228b4d9c0a4d703518713fe5375d9ff","7bd94d2d54f8a253be5f70b879e8a1cf4d62bc15","e7bf61e7e46b60bffc26baeeeac11ec5fb91e0cd","79bd769ce4f1f35098971cec94d04ed927444bca","b1022836efa094906eb887f40822c68d3dcbc711","57da334d7e9932befaa9e7a7e5ee6fa76e2ff78e"],"pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-36949-0_11","http://www.kkant.net/papers/P2P_EAC_CGWS.pdf"],"title":"Energy Adaptive Mechanism for P2P File Sharing Protocols","doi":"10.1007/978-3-642-36949-0_11","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-36949-0_11","venue":"Euro-Par Workshops"}

Topological transformation of layered double hydroxides (LDHs) to the corresponding mixed metal oxides (MMOs) offers an efficient strategy to achieve such interfaces. However, the formation and conversion of these heterostructured interfaces is lacking in study and remains elusive. Herein, we report a detailed investigation of the topological transformation of LDHs. The as-prepared MMO with abundant interfaces can be modulated by calcination of ZnCo-LDH at different temperatures. Among them, the ZnCo-LDH calcinated at 200 °C reveals the most abundant interfaces and exhibits excellent performance in electrochemical water oxidation. This work will deepen the understanding of the LDH topological transformation from the molecular level.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Fine Tuning the Heterostructured Interfaces by Topological Transformation of Layered Double Hydroxide Nanosheets","doi":"10.1021/acs.iecr.8b02246","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.8b02246","venue":""}

In this work, we showed that the droplets in oil-in-water nanoemulsions fabricated by spontaneous emulsification could be coated with an anionic biopolymer (beet pectin) using electrostatic deposition. Nanoemulsions were formed by titrating oil (medium chain triglycerides) and surfactant (polyoxyethylene sorbitan monostearate+lauric arginate) mixtures into an aqueous solution (10 mM citrate buffer, pH 4). Lauric arginate was used to generate a positive charge on the droplet surfaces, thereby enabling subsequent electrostatic deposition of anionic pectin. Extensive droplet aggregation occurred when intermediate pectin concentrations were used due to bridging flocculation. However, stable anionic pectin-coated lipid droplets could be formed at high pectin concentrations. These results demonstrate the possibility of tailoring the functionality of lipid nanodroplets produced by spontaneous emulsification.","inCitations":["1a076d816f2329561ae9be4153998e2a076d28e7","aa26dfae14f03eb803c731e69e8925552b9f2ef6","f4203b62c1d3c701ff3b55a8de6be23c020dafe0","4a7b1a357f0491861c3828b4cf4c7f575f514043"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Tuneable stability of nanoemulsions fabricated using spontaneous emulsification by biopolymer electrostatic deposition.","doi":"10.1016/j.jcis.2015.05.037","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2015.05.037","venue":"Journal of colloid and interface science"}

E(es) was measured as the slope of the end-systolic pressure-volume relationship with a conductance catheter during inferior vena cava occlusion. E(es-s) was calculated using a bilinearly approximated time-varying elastance curve. We also studied 105 patients with MR who had undergone mitral valve repair. All measurements in these patients were performed before surgery and repeated at about 1 week after surgery.\n\n\nRESULTS\nIn the animals in a total of 23 different stages, E(es-s) showed a good correlation and agreement with invasively determined E(es) (y = 0.84 x + 0.38; r = 0.8; P < .01, mean difference = 0.1 +/- 0.6 mm Hg/mL). In the clinical study, preoperative E(es-s) (r = 0.77; P < .001) and end-systolic volume index correlated well with postoperative ejection fraction (r = -0.69; P < .001). Multivariate analyses revealed that only E(es-s) was an independent predictor of postoperative LV function. Preoperative E(es-s) less than or equal to 1.0 mm Hg/mL was most predictive for identifying patients with LV dysfunction after surgery (sensitivity 87%; specificity 76%).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nLV end-systolic elastance can be estimated noninvasively and is useful to detect latent LV dysfunction in patients with MR before surgery.","inCitations":["08c20182921af24e716d280117f632340c733185","577cd6fa4041a8bec0876f6f742f51ad9ecfc527","6db5520060e346ed06a325a31d35d5a8e739b35a","146119ef8d520350435803aad7d040768643ef76","5400a64e3a2685a8c8b115911dcf8af904dfc29b","4a6af54ba268f0c4fe6253d40dd7b860e5093bd4"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Evaluation of left ventricular contractile function using noninvasively determined single-beat end-systolic elastance in mitral regurgitation: experimental validation and clinical application.","doi":"10.1016/j.echo.2007.02.009","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.echo.2007.02.009","venue":"Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography : official publication of the American Society of Echocardiography"}

CUA uses metrics such as the quality-adjusted life year (QALY) to assess the effectiveness of an intervention compared with an alternative. The QALY accounts for mortality (life years) and morbidity (severity of a state) in a single metric; the quality adjustment is based on stated preferences (also referred to as utility weights) that can be obtained from patients or the general public using preference elicitation techniques. For trial-based evaluations, preference-based measures have been developed to assess effectiveness and to elicit QALYs. Once the costs and QALYs for a study have been established, incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) can be used as part of a decision rule whereby an ICER threshold (or league table) is set to inform decision makers about the potential comparative cost-effectiveness of an intervention. Within this chapter, extra-welfarism as the conceptual basis for CUA and reasons for the use of stated preference to represent utility weights are described. Preference-based outcome measures and how they are used as part of cost-per-QALY analysis are also described; disability-adjusted life years are also considered. How ICERs, thresholds, and league tables can be used to inform decision-making is also introduced. Throughout this chapter, examples within the context of mental health are used.

Cold-formed steel is getting popular over the years in construction industry. However, due to its thin-walled behaviour, cold-formed steel is prompt to have buckling failure. Previous research were done to provide stiffener in order to overcome this problem. Furthermore, as addressed in this paper, curved section is introduced and studied to determine its behaviour compare to straight member in handling deformation. Both straight and curved cold-formed steel were tested under flexural with different length as the investigation variable. The results were analysed for comparison. Curved section of cold-formed steel behave differently in beam and column compared to straight section. Curved section has an advantage in reducing the deflection for structural members for flexural behaviour.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://eprints.utm.my/id/eprint/62300/1/TanCherSiang215_ExperimentalInvestigationonFlexuralBehaviour.pdf"],"title":"Experimental investigation on flexural behaviour with cold-formed steel cut-curved channel","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Detailed models of the observable ionized nebula support the recent claim that the Helix is actually a flattened disk whose thickness is roughly one-third its diameter with an inner region containing hot, highly ionized gas which is generally invisible in narrow-band images. The outer visible ring structure is of lower ionization and temperature and is brighter because of a thickening in the disk. We also confirm a central star effective temperature and luminosity of 120,000K and 100L ⊙ , and we estimate a lower limit to the nebular mass to be 0.30M ⊙. Abundance measurements indicate the and Ar/O=6.74×10 −3 (±0.76). Our carbon abundance measurements represent the first of their kind for the Helix Nebula. The S/O ratio which we derive is anomalously low; such values are found in only a few other planetary nebulae. The central star properties, the super-solar values of He/H and N/O, and a solar level of C/O are consistent with a 6.5M ⊙ progenitor which underwent three phases of dredge-up and hot bottom burning before forming the planetary nebula.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://arxiv.org/pdf/astro-ph/9901060v2.pdf","http://arxiv.org/pdf/astro-ph/9901060v1.pdf"],"title":"J an 1 99 9 Morphology and Composition of the Helix Nebula","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Eduardo Barbosa Almeida Resumen La exposicion al medio hiperbarico conlleva importantes cambios en la respuesta funcional del organismo. Uno de los cambios mas relevantes observados, en humanos, es la disminucion de la Frecuencia Cardiaca (FC). El objetivo de este trabajo ha sido analizar la mecanica de disminucion de la FC y evaluar la importancia de los factores inherentes al aumento de la presion ambiental: presion parcial de oxigeno (Ppo2), densidad de los gases respirados, aumento de la temperatura ambiental y respiracion de gases inertes. Para ello, hemos analizado la Variabilidad de la Frecuencia Cardiaca (VFC) en los dominios: frecuencia (Transformada Rapida de Fourier), tiempo/frecuencia (Transformadas Wavelet) y a traves de una metodologia no lineal (Plot de Poincare). La fase experimental consistia en la realizacion de dos protocolos. En el primero evaluamos la dinamica de la FC y VFC por efecto directo del aumento de la presion ambiental [1, 2, 3 y 4 Atmosferas absolutas (ATA)] y su incidencia en las presiones parciales de los gases respirados. En el segundo hemos buscado observar la influencia de los demas factores inherentes al medio hiperbarico no vinculados al oxigeno (aumento de presion ambiental de 1 a 3 ATA, respirando una mezcla de gases - trimix- donde la Pp,,2 era la misma que al nivel del mar). La diferencia entre los dos protocolos radica en que, en el primero se aumentaba la Ppoz y en el segundo no. Los resultados obtenidos en el primer protocolo nos indican la existencia de una bradicardia significativa como respuesta al aumento de la presion ambiental. La disminucion de la FC, por efecto hiperbarico, parece comportarse como una ley de potencia. Ademas se observaron cambios en la VFC que son de diferentes magnitudes en cada rango de frecuencia. En el segundo protocolo no se observaron cambios relevantes en FC y VFC. Con relacion a los metodos de evaluacion de la VFC, el Plot de Poincare se muestra como el metodo de evaluacion que tiene mayor poder discriminatorio de la actividad parasimpatica del sistema nervioso autonomo sobre el ritmo cardiaco, Esto es especialmente relevante cuando no se controla la frecuencia respiratoria. Las transformadas wavelet son una herramienta que permite visualizar, y analizar con detalle y precision, las alteraciones del espectro de frecuencia de la VFC, en estas condiciones. Concluimos que la bradicardia del ambiente hiperbarico (hasta 4 ATA) es una respuesta multifactorial basicamente vinculada al aumento de la Pp,,2, y esta mediada por un aumento de la participacion parasimpatica en la modulacion cardiaca.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Efecto de la presión hiperbárica y diferentes presiones parciales de gases sobre la modulación vegetativa de la respuesta cardiaca: aplicación de métodos lineales y no lineales en el análisis de VFC","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

The fate of the MMC after feeding, however, has not been elucidated. We used time series analysis with fast Fourier transforms (FFT) to study myoelectric cycling before and after feeding. Ten rats were chronically prepared with bipolar electrodes secured to the duodenum and proximal jejunum. Spikeburst frequency was recorded before and after feeding simple nutrients. During fasting, cyclic activity occurred at the MMC frequency. Although after feeding this periodicity appeared disrupted, FFT analysis showed persistent cycling at the fasted (MMC) rate. Digital filtering of data at the MMC frequency isolated cycling from background noise during both fasted and fed states and showed a depression in the amplitude of the waveform after feeding. Root-mean-square analysis of the waveform confirmed statistically significant depression of amplitude by 47-57%. The waveform propagated from the duodenum to the jejunum during both the fasted and fed state at an unchanged rate. We conclude that factors controlling myoelectric cycling during the fasted state persist after feeding, allowing continued net abroad propulsion of food.","inCitations":["2f10549abe7c84a0eb6663bb5eff226e26b1f673"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Preservation and propagation of cyclic myoelectric activity after feeding in rat small intestine","doi":"10.1152/ajpgi.1992.263.2.G248","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1152/ajpgi.1992.263.2.G248","venue":""}
