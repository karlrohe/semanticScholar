The NMR line below 305 K was a singlet with the Knight shift reduced compared to that in bulk. Above this temperature the NMR line split reproducibly into two components with opposite trends in the Knight shift temperature dependences which evidenced a nanoconfinement-induced transformation and heterogeneity in the electron system.

The design principle that allows developmental transcriptional programs to conserve embryonic morphology while adapting to environmental changes is still not fully understood. To address this fundamental challenge, we compare developmental transcriptomes of two sea urchin species, Paracentrotus lividus and Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, that shared a common ancestor about 40 million years ago and are geographically distant yet show similar morphology. We find that both developmental and housekeeping genes show highly dynamic and strongly conserved temporal expression patterns. The expression of other gene sets, including homeostasis and response genes, show divergent expression which could result from either evolutionary drift or adaptation to local environmental conditions. The interspecies correlations of developmental gene expressions are highest between morphologically similar developmental time points whereas the interspecies correlations of housekeeping gene expression are high between all the late zygotic time points. Relatedly, the position of the phylotypic stage varies between these two groups of genes: developmental gene expression shows highest conservation at mid-developmental stage, in agreement with the hourglass model while the conservation of housekeeping genes keeps increasing with developmental time. When all genes are combined, the relationship between conservation of gene expression and morphological similarity is partially masked by housekeeping genes and genes with diverged expression. Our study illustrates various transcriptional programs that coexist in the developing embryo and evolve under different constraints. Apparently, morphological constraints underlie the conservation of developmental gene expression while embryonic fitness requires the conservation of housekeeping gene expression and the species-specific adjustments of homeostasis gene expression. The distinct evolutionary forces acting on these transcriptional programs enable the conservation of similar body plans while allowing adaption.","inCitations":["8bf2126bff4f079f8df363376378026cde863899","715ba5c1ce9d5d5fe102ff8c27ff8430cfa40ce2","6c88e02b0d0528a2e091a21ae100d6e5b276f8ba","a7241ec453c90565c48ea404cd254d7f6a33edf0","74352e867bf487b73437fe14e9dc43e61093edc1"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Parallel embryonic transcriptional programs evolve under distinct constraints and may enable morphological conservation amidst adaptation.","doi":"10.1016/j.ydbio.2017.07.019","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ydbio.2017.07.019","venue":"Developmental biology"}

Yet, they are inadequately trained to perform this task. We present an analysis of the kader as maternal health promoters after their health promotion training with use of counselling card. Methods: Between March-April 2015, 14 participatory workshops were conducted and 188 kader in four villages in Ciranjang sub-district were trained. Data were collected through in-depth interviews and focus group discussions from community members, health care providers and policy makers in the four villages. A total of 44 interviews were conducted prior to health promotion training and 48 interviews posttraining. In 46 Posyandu, kader were observed during their practice of health promotion within 3 consecutive months of post training. Data was transcribed and analysed in NVivo 10. Results: Most kader acknowledged that health promotion training improved their knowledge of maternal health and counselling skills and changed their attitude towards pregnant women at the Posyandu. They could confidently negotiate health messages and importance of health facility delivery with antenatal women. The kader also found the counselling cards helped pregnant women understand the health messages more clearly. The participatory training method involving role play and direct discussions boost kader confidence to deliver health promotion. As a result, the kader gained community appreciation which enhanced their motivation about their job. Conclusions: Appropriate health promotion training, provided the kader with adequate knowledge and skills to become resourceful maternal health promoters in the community.","inCitations":["db8368d9b42e7f2a401ad035b754dd2989db2fdf","b61816db6171af1c46dfeffa6cc2c0fed42be70e"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Analysis of Indonesia‚Äôs community health volunteers (kader) as maternal health promoters in the community integrated health service (Posyandu) following health promotion training","doi":"10.18203/2394-6040.ijcmph20180462","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.18203/2394-6040.ijcmph20180462","venue":""}

The group is involved in promoting the provision of cycle routes, of which there are now over 320 km in the UK, utilizing disused railway lines, and creating new urban routes, for cyclists and pedestrians. Prior to changes in government policy, youth training schemes provided much of the necessary labour. Labour intensive limestone paving was constructed. The cost of works has now doubled, and contractors are now also used, providing asphalt surfacing. Projects are funded by the Countryside Commission, and by local authorities. The average cost of a cycle route is 30000 to 40000 per kilometre. Scotland has been the focus of much recent activity, with a cycle route opened between Ardrossan and Irvine in Ayrshire, as well as the Kilmacolm to Bridge of Weir route. A city-wide cycling strategy was carried out by Sustans for Edinburgh in 1985/86 is now being implemented. It is hoped that ownership of all cycle routes will transfer to local authorities in the UK. Sustans main involvement with local authorities is in the co-ordination of multi-authority projects. The most ambitious current proposal is for a Hull to Southport route, the Trans Pennine Trail which will involve 19 local authority areas.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Wheeling a New Venture","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

The purpose of the study was to quantitatively explore and analyze the relationships among the factors of servant leadership, school culture, and student achievement in Missouri elementary schools. Research procedures. Two survey instruments, the Servant Leadership Assessment Instrument and the School Culture Survey, were used. A total of 677 teachers from 62 elementary schools in Missouri participated. Data from the two surveys as well as student achievement data were aggregated at the school level and analyzed using correlation and multiple regression analysis. Findings. The results of this study explain the influence of principal servant leadership on school culture and student achievement, the influence of school culture on student achievement, and the influence of the combination of servant leadership and school culture on student achievement. Explanatory models were designed from the findings to depict the relationships between servant leadership, school culture, and student achievement.","inCitations":["2e7e5f9559cd2a3196f8cfa980953d355dc0e505","adbac4de3cbbb570bd2b2affbc1caca23469764e","257ee2d0a94e0e49c5bd2e631fd9b9297613977c","3ededf13b5972dff2969a143ebc52d89591482fc","31d0bd62d2ad3c22087242872209617160c5f7dc","b4bf838bcc6a0ecb41b8b0e2b8c2214f2aa5dedf","ed4732f68384eb767f5543c65956ae97d83130a9","fc62f21a6201598e34f704247957f5570ae8a25f","f8c566e68e4bb16d187a396780bbb5ce41717e84","40cd17ba8f826cee7cd09098bd622e6acd7bb15b"],"pdfUrls":["https://mospace.umsystem.edu/xmlui/bitstream/handle/10355/4657/short.pdf?isAllowed=y&sequence=2"],"title":"An analysis of the relationships between servant leadership, school culture, and student achievement","doi":"10.32469/10355/4657","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.32469/10355%2F4657","venue":""}

KP-102 induced a large plasma GH response at a dose of 0.5 micrograms/kg BW in conscious rats, although GH-releasing abilities of KP-102 varied markedly depending on the phase of GH secretion. Among urethan-anesthetized rats, KP-102 alone exerted a small influence on GH secretion, but it produced a large plasma GH response in the presence of exogenous GH-releasing factor (GRF). The rest of studies were performed on urethan anesthetized rats. During intermittent administration of GRF, the somatotropes became refractory to a large bolus dose of GRF, but KP-102 induced a marked increase of plasma GH. The GH response to KP-102 alone or KP-102 with GRF was significantly augmented when cysteamine HCl was previously administered. Although KP-102 and GRF acted synergistically on GH secretion in control animals, they acted additively in cysteamine-administered rats. Taken together, these findings suggest that the KP-102-induced GH secretion largely depends on GRF and the secretagogue potentiates the GRF effect by antagonizing the SS action at the level of somatotropes. It is concluded that KP-102 alone or in combination with GRF provides a means of stimulating GH secretion in the face of elevated inhibitory tone mediated by SS.","inCitations":["1bc895da91a062c56680f030ba974f9a534b749d","24df700694b4def0f1de80bf1694c4332ec6faa6"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"[Effect of newly developed analogue of growth hormone releasing peptide [D-Ala-D-beta Nal-Ala-Trp-D-Phe-Lys-NH2 (KP-102)] on growth hormone secretion in adult male rats].","doi":"10.1272/jnms1923.62.142","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1272/jnms1923.62.142","venue":"Nihon Ika Daigaku zasshi"}

Various difficulties are encountered in the collection of suitable material. Our knowledge of their faunas and the quality of their waters is based on relatively recent observations, and comparable water analysis results are available only for the last few decades. The degree of human influence varies with the region. When human settlement is of long standing, as in the Alps and the British Isles, man has wrought great changes in the surroundings over many centuries and thus also influenced the lakes. In Fennoscandia such changes have been slight and many lakes can be considered untouched even now. It is also difficult to obtain a true picture of the original distribution of the fish species, since changes were made in some fish faunas at a rather early date, e.g. in the British Isles (Varley 1967).","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"The Fish Fauna and Limnology of Large Oligotrophic Glacial Lakes in Europe (about 1800 A.D.)l","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

This occurs based on the setting of degrading curves for damage and deformation in the pavement structure. Repair and maintenance work is strictly linked to the courses; of course this means a need for funding. If the degrading curves are not set correctly the need for repair may arise regardless of whether the pavement actually is in a condition requiring such repair. One of the main factors affecting pavement degrading and, therefore, the behaviour of the HDM-4 model, is the socalled structural number (SN). There are many methods used globally to determine the SN value, based on the quantity and quality of the data available which might include: elasticity modules for the materials, pavement structure layer thicknesses, output from the back calculation programs, output from the FWD device or design characteristics of the road. In the Czech Republic substantial inconsistencies have been detected in the current methodology for the coefficient determination; therefore, the expression of the structural number has been optimised both for new road constructions and for existing pavements. The calibration of pavement SN determination in the Czech Republic was carried out by means of the VYNAPA software which modelled pavement structures most frequently used in the territory.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://www.h-a-d.hr/pubfile.php?id=690"],"title":"Vynapa - Czech Software Upgrade for Calculation of Pavement Design Parameters Used by Hdm-4","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

The fractal analysis of vascular volume revealed a self-similar nature with a fractal dimension ( D value) similar to that of flow distribution (1.20 ¬± 0.05 and 1.24 ¬± 0.09 for vascular volume and flow distribution, respectively) and had a more marked variability than the flow. The correlation of the regional vascular volume between adjacent regions decreased as the distance increased. However, the correlation coefficients in the endocardial-to-epicardial direction were significantly higher than those in the anterior-to-posterior direction ( P < 0.05 by paired t-test). In conclusion, we determined intramyocardial vascular volume density in the sagittal plane, and the distribution revealed considerable variability, self-similarity, and asymmetry in the correlation among the adjacent regions.

The NOMA with superposition coding (SC) in the transmitter and successive interference cancellation (SIC) at the receiver comes with many desirable features and benefits over orthogonal multiple access (OMA) such as orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) adopted by Long-Term Evolution (LTE). In this paper, we study the recent research trends on NOMA in 5G systems. We discuss the basic concept of NOMA and explain its aspects of importance for future radio access. Then, we provide a survey of the state of the art in NOMA for 5G systems in a categorized manner. Further, we analyze the NOMA performances with numerical examples; and provide some avenues for future research on NOMA on a set of open issues and challenges.","inCitations":["da182ed20e69fa57538b00b332a14cbc5ffdc4e2"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"On Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) in 5G Systems","doi":"10.7840/kics.2015.40.12.2549","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.7840/kics.2015.40.12.2549","venue":""}

Each drug sample was tested for its ability to cause platelet aggregation, which was measured as PAF-induced aggregation, before and after the addition of various concentrations of the examined sample, creating a linear curve of percentage inhibition (ranging from 0% to 100%) versus different concentrations of the sample. The concentration of the sample that inhibited 50% PAF-induced aggregation was calculated based on this curve, and this value was defined as IC50. In addition, the effect of eye drops on PAF metabolism was examined, through an in vitro analysis on PAF basic metabolic enzymes (PAF-cholinephosphotransferase, PAF-acetyl-CoA:1-O-alkyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine acetyltransferase, and PAF-acetylhydrolase).\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe IC50 values for Lumigan UD¬Æ (bimatoprost 0.3 mg/mL), Monoprost¬Æ (latanoprost 50 Œºg/mL), and Saflutan (tafluprost 15 Œºg/mL) were 8.7, 0.28, and 1.4 Œºg/mL, respectively.\n\n\nDISCUSSION\nAll three prostaglandin analogs suspended PAF, but bimatoprost induced the most potent inhibition, compared to tafluprost and to the weak effect of latanoprost.","inCitations":["8dd526b5586e5edd729af0e1fd7477f935c52e53"],"pdfUrls":["https://www.dovepress.com/getfile.php?fileID=33918","https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/pmc/oa_pdf/28/a4/dddt-10-3977.PMC5153256.pdf"],"title":"Impact of prostaglandin glaucoma drops on platelet-activating factor action: an in vitro study","doi":"10.2147/DDDT.S117806","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.2147/DDDT.S117806","venue":"Drug design, development and therapy"}

To make better use of the large number of ‚Äúthings‚Äù availability in the IoT infrastructure, we consider to dynamically discover and compose IoT capabilities in the IoT network for new or dynamically arising tasks. To achieve the goal, we develop a semantic-based routing protocol for IoT service discovery. In the routing protocol to reduce the space requirement for routing, each node maintains a routing table with a ‚Äútelescopic view‚Äù, i.e., more precise information about the capabilities of immediate neighbors and only a summary of capabilities for a further away neighborhood. We define an ontology of capabilities and design a capability summarization algorithm based on the ontology to realize the telescopic view concept. We also design an ontology coding scheme to further reduce the memory requirement for routing while enabling capability summarization. Our solutions significantly reduce the routing table size and, hence, is suitable for IoT devices with limited memory. Also, experimental results show that our approach can yield significantly lower network traffic and latency for IoT capability lookup when compared with existing semantic based routing algorithms.","inCitations":["2d5700378e49c49f16c279c300ecb76aa1d4cf7d","a0484c0f4930ed99acade3cb7a4ba30184f3ec37","5ab7daa9bb19adba9583cd416853dfd611171cf6","b33b8ba2fcd1efb4849d66c9e24eba3ee2d15713","e0dff5f27ae278eccde8b722347c4d5dcabe8769","cdab800f55f07f3a66b997ac467db2216ba13270","6433df291b27c0092fb222445a62a9c6d691d25c"],"pdfUrls":["http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/ICPADS.2017.00055"],"title":"Routing in IoT Network for Dynamic Service Discovery","doi":"10.1109/ICPADS.2017.00055","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPADS.2017.00055","venue":"2017 IEEE 23rd International Conference on Parallel and Distributed Systems (ICPADS)"}

The low incidence of this disease, despite the prevalence of streptococcal respiratory infections, and the high familial incidence suggest a genetic factor. A recent study, however, shows that rheumatic fever does not follow the pattern of a simple recessive gene (1). Rheumatic symptoms develop after mild as well as severe infections due to any one of 50 known types of Group A Streptococci. Attempts to prove that any particular cellular component or enzyme produced by these organisms is the cause of this disease have so far proved negative. Rheumatic fever is uncommon in children less than five years of age. The mean titers of antistreptococcal antibodies in patients with acute rheumatic fever tend to be higher than in children with uncomplicated streptococcal infections (2). These observations suggested that repeated, closely spaced attacks of streptococcal pharyngitis may be a determining factor (3). It is usually not possible to obtain a reliable history of remote respiratory infections. Furthermore, even if the illness is recalled, streptococcal pharyngitis usually cannot be differentiated from a sore throat of viral origin. The commonly studied antistreptococcal antibodies, such as antistreptolysin 0, are not type-specific and may show a rise in titer after infection with any one of the 50 types of Group A Streptococci. These antibodies usually appear one to two weeks after the infection and in most instances return to normal levels after two to six months.

The reduction of fluorine ions in copper metallization processes will be a key eco-friendly business issue in the near future. For this paper, new molybdenum alloy as a copper barrrier layer for IGZO and LTPS applications was developed that can be easily wet-patterned in copper wet etchant without etch residue. First, the effects of metal electrodes on the electrical performance of back channel etching type amorphous In-Ga-Zn-O thin film transistors were studied. Then, a secondary ion mass spectroscopy depth analysis revealed that the detected molybdenum content on the IGZO surface after wet patterning experienced a ten-fold reduction compared to pure molybdenum. In addition, new molybdenum alloy showed better thermal resistance properties compared to pure molybdenum. After the Mo alloy/copper/Mo alloy tri-layers were annealed at 400 ¬∞C for 1 hour, the electrical resistance decreased from 5.7 ¬µohm-cm to 3.2 ¬µohm-cm, while the pure molybdenum tri-layer showed a dramatic increase after thermal annealing. The reduced molybdenum residue after wet patterning also influenced the electrical properties of the back channel etching type IGZO TFTs. The mobility measured between 10~14 cm2/V.sec and the contact resistance was about 0.5 Mohm. Both value were comparable to reported value.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"P‚Äê56: Eco‚ÄêFriendly Copper Metallization for IGZO and LTPS with New Molybdenum Barrier Layer","doi":"10.1002/sdtp.10933","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1002/sdtp.10933","venue":""}

Unlike traditional solvent-based CO2 capture systems in which the same solvent is used for both CO2 absorption and stripping, the solvent of the DAS system consists of two aqueous phases. The upper phase, which contains an organic alkali 1-(2-hydroxyethyl) piperazine (HEP), is used for CO2 absorption. The lower phase, which consists of a mixture of K2CO3/KHCO3 aqueous solution and KHCO3 precipitate, is used for CO2 stripping. Only a certain kind of amine (such as HEP) is able to ensure the phase separation, satisfactory absorption efficiency, effective CO2 transfer from the upper phase to the lower phase, and regeneration of the upper phase. In the meantime, due to the presence of K2CO3/KHCO3 in the lower phase, HEP in the upper phase is capable of being regenerated from its sulfite/sulfate heat stable salt, which enables the simultaneous absorption of CO2 and SO2/SO3 from the flue gas. Preliminary experiments and simulations indicate that the implementation of the DAS system can lead to 24.0% stripping energy savings compared to the Econamine process, without significantly lowering the CO2 absorption efficiency (‚àº90%).","inCitations":["7a254940b5ad222a34532668776c602b7f1d3220","0989066e9b93ac3117a39e9629a3774cdac05fcf"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Dual Alkali Solvent System for CO2 Capture from Flue Gas.","doi":"10.1021/acs.est.7b00006","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.7b00006","venue":"Environmental science & technology"}

The security personnel are common between the 2 hospitals and use similar confiscation protocols. The institutions were evaluated between January 1, 2000 and August 31, 2000, which followed the implementation of weapons detectors at the children's hospital. The variety and scope of weapons confiscated were monitored.\n\n\nRESULTS\nDuring the 8 months, 3706 metallic weapons were confiscated. This included 3446 from the general hospital and 260 from the children's center. The weapons confiscated at the general hospital compared with the children's hospital included guns (4 vs. 0), knives (2048 vs. 114), box cutter/razors (596 vs. 37), scissors (70 vs. 53), chemical sprays (205 vs. 50), tools (73 vs. 6), and other (450 vs. 0).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nWhile more weapons were confiscated at the larger general hospital, the traditional sense that children's hospitals are at minimal risk is unjustified. The alarming number of lethal concealed weapons confiscated from both institutions demonstrates the importance of deterrent security measures, including the use of metal detectors to protect families and staff.","inCitations":["521dd2e51cb864ec0aaf44fa66d196df923327b2","94a2f6f8a11fa4ef0f789353b42d08829d872b93","9648fda38fce9e13ecf647d8b939ff53fc622927","feff0d690edfdcad9893604c92161cd379e80fdd","736ef53c8c625d950adaa0a826cd8b37b577fc65","5257ea160911b07d64e51d987e1d5df8e0720e57"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Weapons detection at two urban hospitals.","doi":"10.1097/01.pec.0000086236.54586.db","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1097/01.pec.0000086236.54586.db","venue":"Pediatric emergency care"}

Therefore, emphasis on developing ice mitigation systems has become a significant part of the wind energy conversion systems. These systems use various technologies and have different specifications, sometimes with no clear indication of their efficiency. Since the effect of cold climate on wind turbines is complex, not every ice protection system is suitable for a given wind farm. Therefore, the aim of this work is to compare the existing ice mitigation solutions and provide an indication on their efficiency. In this paper, we first review the most recent standards set by experts, and the major issues associated with wind energy in cold climates. Then, we present the ice protection techniques found in the literature, and then highlight the recent research on the optimization of the systems. Finally, we present an analysis of the current market, compare ice protection techniques and systems, based on various criteria, and measure the additional costs generated by ice mitigation.","inCitations":["ab7d3a264202317c241e2444a2ac4a4083ad1901","9124a308f7a12f12d79f6d9e927a0f283e0fdfed","45feace3a57be062e3813fa0108c721d38f44389","8dce805d297e99297184411a6b6f8cb2e77262e5","9d8e65ab4eb96291017254afcb46a679fcd4c9c7","107d958a862edb14937362a185854345968cc9d4","b594b3d9284e95c13fe86062e81489197fb2efd5","9f28f888cbc1005fb168c2432a434867a472c53b","5bca8bbdb35b923bec909645f5fcacfccb5bc093","c37a0c9db8f2072fcc24f3ffe21516fa47624534","1295ca7a65711139010de8d40f2b60d9ed2b00f8","b81497dc9257eab72bb3bbe6087b936fb0e7bd8e","123bb5b3ab6665bf5392403ad5403934cbc47dd9"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Ice protection systems for wind turbines in cold climate: characteristics, comparisons and analysis","doi":"10.1016/j.rser.2016.06.080","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rser.2016.06.080","venue":""}

Early larvae were characterized by a photopic visual system with a high density of cone photoreceptors, but no rods or photoreceptor summation on to higher order cells. Acuity of small larvae was comparable to other species. The mechanosensory system of early larvae consisted of a relatively high density of free neuromasts on the head and body. By approximately 10 mm total length (LT), many sensory attributes of larvae had changed. Visual acuity had improved to levels slightly better than in other species. Rods began forming and summation ratios increased, indicating development of scotopic vision. Cephalic lateral-line canals began to enclose at 15 mm LT and were complete by 24 mm. The trunk lateral-line began to enclose at 30 mm and was complete by 40 mm. Behavioural performance was tested using an artificial predatory stimulus under different conditions to isolate the roles of vision and mechanoreception. Both sensory systems were necessary to elicit the highest levels of responsiveness. Responsiveness of larvae 6 mm was largely influenced by visual input. Both vision and mechanoreception influenced ontogenetic changes in reactive distance of larvae. When there was no visual input, reactive distances increased slightly through ontogeny, indicating the use of mechanoreception. Only when mechanoreception was blocked, the ontogenetic increase in reactive distances was greater than that of larvae with all sensory systems intact. These results indicate that Atlantic croaker larvae use both sensory systems throughout the larval period, but the relative importance of these sensory systems changes with ontogeny.","inCitations":["ebe7a9d1390b162624385d483b592bf641209863","83828baf8fd2d6ebd22097e2ef204bee5945fcd0","ee2f2cdb76a4883302ad8189fb242d43b6cabe74","8e5d299b5bbd9fac101b85000b3cb8184511d20c","4d5d983ea4170babc2ee774070b205d6b9893ea1","1608140619d9accaf3bcf48bc6f91739b9f7d730","c134ebbda8e540e051f79335ec47fce0ea963af4","82e10de24174f04bc9be5d60ead7f650e2524e70","ca42d1f2529e0f616b95d232170127a2875c20c3","cc5492740b1ee3cc4e0d3746434dcb51a3a74796","337bf1993407e857d1344adbc23dbba69f485698","5889ddaec599f418778630d45d22d0e21e43cdbf","fdca183c94a035fb18c41086f4e5c62bd268015f","d92e88da6c15548cdd3004c6cee5b7ffb05a2a6a","d2743ee12afd0fdbedf7a5cf83017dcc75bd3134","6d25da5789c327111484e81aa49b347f2512758e","738b00053a0ade6d8b946429752865c18bfcc63b","1a4f4d7cb65f3f65ac5e2f1c23ade4abc47ce972","2c8e5a564cc89d4f0407e1af66ad64088a369022","6dcb7074855d4151ff6469b5ea91d97e6fc78c7c","987610e03b7ceef0e91b7c5eda1c1112a1576be3"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Sensory development and concurrent behavioural changes in Atlantic croaker larvae","doi":"10.1111/j.1095-8649.1997.tb01675.x","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1095-8649.1997.tb01675.x","venue":""}

The first survey requested information regarding personal characteristics, work characteristics, and depressive symptoms (CES-D); the second survey queried participants in the first survey about self-reported occupational injuries (including minor scratches or cuts) experienced in the previous 4¬†months. Risk ratios (RRs) were calculated through Poisson regression analysis. The number of occupational injuries during the previous 4¬†months served as the dependent variable, and depressive symptoms served as the independent variable.ResultsAfter adjustment for demographic factors, the RRs were 1.75 (95% CI: 1.41‚Äì2.18) and 2.68 (95% CI: 1.98‚Äì3.64) in male and female, respectively. Additional adjustment for work-related variables did not alter the RR considerably in females (2.65; 95% CI: 1.95‚Äì3.59). Among the male workers, however, the RR was not significant (1.21; 95% CI: 0.95‚Äì1.55). On the other hand, when the analysis was limited to blue-collar workers, after adjustment for demographic and work-related factors, the RRs remained significant in both genders (male: 1.34; 95% CI: 1.03‚Äì1.74; female: 2.04; 95% CI: 1.41‚Äì2.95).ConclusionsWe found that the risk of self-reported occupational injury experience was higher in workers who reported depressive symptoms.

Human visual inspection is currently the most widely used method to assess corrosion. In this paper, we propose the use of image processing to determine the extent of corrosion and estimate the time period within which the ship parts have to be replaced. In the case of availability of pre-corrosion images, the histograms of the pre-corrosion and post-corrosion images are compared and their similarity is quantified as the Sum of Squared Distances (SSD) value. Our method then produces a numerical output which signifies the level of corrosion. We then correlate extent of damage and ship part replacement period.

The migration of cells into a wounded area was dose-dependently stimulated by Ca D-pantothenate. The number of cells that migrated across the edge of the wound increased from 32 +/- 7 cells/mm without Ca D-pantothenate to 76 +/- 2 cells/mm with 100 mg/ml Ca D-pantothenate. Moreover, the mean migration distance per cell increased from 0.23 +/- 0.05 mm to 0.33 +/- 0.02 mm. The mean migration speed was calculated to be 10.5 mm/hour without and 15 mm/hour with Ca D-pantothenate. Cell proliferation was also dose-dependently stimulated. The final cell densities were 1.2 to 1.6-fold higher in cultures containing 100 mg/ml Ca D-pantothenate. The protein synthesis was modulated, since two unidentified proteins were more strongly expressed in pantothenate supplemented cultures. In conclusion, Ca D-pantothenate accelerates the wound healing process by increasing the number of migrating cells, their distance and hence their speed. In addition, cell division is increased and the protein synthesis changed. These results suggest that higher quantities of pantothenate are locally required to enhance wound healing.","inCitations":["26b0c31fb8f575cddde076f7ea83d534bc016acc","b20280f2f6ac046a890cf7e38bfaad8306a0fe68","551378a68c5cd6ebdb6572181e4b8bf824eb40ca","a75f9c77252e874abe333605e551da59cf1a0add","c7aea2934e06fe311968eedd39d446b93625c5f6","2803912587f673efa4492dbae30d7e098cf58a81","80041fbad5afb1f3528eb6daf6675aec412cf516","30a70408cf4332cf63d009490047cf14182b6a12","7d482a0df46b11770036b3f296fbc85e8ac82b7d","e0a3153967270e2a87b567d0282c6ec0832b7300","95a3eca44807e9ce5450fc5e7ed3b6253889a2b7","b0d276f5e887d0033207e952bd7c96c0d4aa2258","e06d2b516a18a1388663d18f78b321c8344db830","4156beb192534d7d476430bc65a53beba7a013d4","99cd2cd3bc1f334d49b2036203bbb2acda68c8b8","a7b770b8a14d323138f54f1d98a76fa13fd7dc15","81b54d61a9387a28c4e81cbf566759c84392548f","51616732d49592a4d7b736a8a5d143c7a9e1e2fd","ef260c09911832aeba9d3a5f12b9ee331c3070e1","e30b2ce20d5b0f697b4e241f1fed1f13a286fc1c","ffadf526581fc54c218d91e998fd708fea471ccb","f2bab9a522e1838499cb15a517782fd4763d03b8","648654b860a382358925b044c3006ed0526f74f5","da508569486bb646fb7b11535ff598cc8a33ad39"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Studies on wound healing: effects of calcium D-pantothenate on the migration, proliferation and protein synthesis of human dermal fibroblasts in culture.","doi":"10.1024/0300-9831.69.2.113","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1024/0300-9831.69.2.113","venue":"International journal for vitamin and nutrition research.

With use of CFRC, the insurmountable complexity of the LCRC and ULCRC connected with their initial heating in the dehydration temperature range of the HAC (up to 450¬∞C) is resolved.

Iotrolan was given intravenously to patients undergoing urography, head and body computed tomography phlebography and digital subtraction angiography. The agent was also studied after intra-arterial injections in cerebral, visceral and peripheral angiographic procedures as well as digital subtraction angiography. Data from 32 prospective double blind, randomized, controlled clinical studies, were evaluated. A total of 1203 patients received either iopromide, iohexol or iopamidol (all in concentration of 300 mg iodine/ml), and a further 1207 patients received iortrolan. As there were no sognificant differences (P = 0.0853) in adverse events between the comparative agents, their adverse event data were pooled for evaluation with data from patients receiving iotrolan. Adverse experiences were recorded in two categories ‚Äî local tolerance (heat and pain) and general tolerance (generalized heat and adverse clinical events). After intra-arterial injection iotrolan had a significantly lower incidence of local heat sensation (P = 0.0001) and a significantly lower incidence of local pain (P = 0.0001) compared with comparator agents. Also, after intravenous injection iotrolan had a significantly lower incidence of local heat (P = 0.0038). In the overall evaluation of general tolerance for all indications, iotrolan was shown to produce significantly less generalized heat (P = 0.0012) and a lower incidence of adverse events (P = 0.061) compared with the reference agents.","inCitations":["0f48f46df7ce1b274252fb5fcfd05f361d67205d","6c8db3b6bfd19947eb372148267242daf0257630","5d1b2ba50bd4ca71f48dca674fd326309034bfb6"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Clinical safety assessment of iotrolan 280 in European clinical studies","doi":"10.1007/BF02343268","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/BF02343268","venue":"European Radiology"}

From now on, images can be maintained on the LCD after driving voltages have been withdrawn from the electrodes. In low frame-rate applications such as e-books, e-labels, smartcards etc., this offers a major improvement in power consumption and battery life. However, bi-stable displays require high driving voltages and complex waveforms. Furthermore, the nature of some applications doesn't allow the use of relatively large passive components. This rules out more traditional approaches for high-voltage generation with external coils or capacitors. This paper describes the design of completely integrated and programmable high-voltage generators capable of generating output voltages up to 50V out of a 3 V supply voltage. Features like 8-bit output voltage programmability and stabilisation were implemented to make this type of high-voltage generator suitable for bi-stable display drivers. Design aspects and simulation results are discussed, as well as measurements on prototype generators implemented in the 0.7Œºm 100 V I 2 T100 technology from AMI Semiconductor.","inCitations":["86828890577bafb712f4b9e9be8da6de0fdb1471"],"pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1093/ietele/e89-c.4.531"],"title":"On-Chip Low-Power High-Voltage Generators for Monolithic Bi-Stable Display Drivers","doi":"10.1093/ietele/e89-c.4.531","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1093/ietele%2Fe89-c.4.531","venue":"IEICE Trans.

Like any other water meter technology, they have significant metrological limitations that prevent them, even if recently installed, from measuring all water consumption of a domestic customer. After installation, their metrological characteristics evolve depending on the particular design of the meters and their actual working conditions in the field. This work presents a comprehensive set of tests to determine the initial and after installation weighted error of two types of domestic single-jet water meters. Three non-linear degradation models have been derived from the tests results. These models consider age, totalised volume, or both parameters simultaneously as drivers of the weighted error. The results show that even though the construction of the two examined meters is similar, they have been working under comparable operational conditions and measuring water of the same quality, there is a significant difference in the performance between both types. This result highlights the need to conduct individual analyses for each meter type and the impossibility of generalizing conclusions on how the weighted error could evolve over time.","inCitations":["dca224fe92845e2d9e8afbb4f9bfa5878160853f","ab2bd33ef5bea930520804bb26aabb17a8a61bb5","1cb8d7dc27bbf90379cd8eea0a94d7c8adaf34a0"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Performance Analysis of Ageing Single-Jet Water Meters for Measuring Residential Water Consumption","doi":"10.3390/w10050612","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.3390/w10050612","venue":""}

Acute toxicity WW and LL is assessed on the basis of (L(E)C50, acute Toxic Units (TUa), pT values, and, by applying different simple result scoring systems or toxicity thresholds. The differences in legislation and recommendations for biotest application in WW and LL aquatic toxicity testing are compared.

The QRS complex is an important waveform in an ECG signal and it serves as reference point for most ECG signal processing algorithms. In this paper a real-time QRS complex detector based on discrete wavelet transform (DWT) is proposed. In contrast with other algorithms, ours is able to automatically select the detail coefficients that will be used to detect the QRS complex after applying the DWT to the signal. The algorithm was compared with other published methods and evaluated with two datasets, one of them with arrhythmia and the other in healthy conditions. The results for the signals with arrhythmia were 99.30% for sensitivity, 99.61% for positive predictivity and 1.12% for error detection rate, while in the signals in healthy conditions the values were of 99.95%, 99.98% and 0.0006% respectively.

In the face of tissue or nerve injury, the afferent encoding systems display robust changes in the input‚Äìoutput function, leading to an ongoing sensation reported as painful and sensitization of the nociceptors such that an enhanced pain state is reported for a given somatic or visceral stimulus. Our understanding of the mechanisms underlying this non-linear processing of nociceptive stimuli has led to our appreciation of the role played by the functional interactions of neural and immune signaling systems in pain phenotypes. In pathological states, neural systems interact with the immune system through the actions of a variety of soluble mediators, including cytokines. Cytokines are recognized as important mediators of inflammatory and neuropathic pain, supporting system sensitization and the development of a persistent pathologic pain. Cytokines can induce a facilitation of nociceptive processing at all levels of the neuraxis including supraspinal centers where nociceptive input evokes an affective component of the pain state. We review here several key proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines and explore their underlying actions at four levels of neuronal organization: (1) peripheral nociceptor termini; (2) dorsal root ganglia; (3) spinal cord; and (4) supraspinal areas. Thus, current thinking suggests that cytokines by this action throughout the neuraxis play key roles in the induction of pain and the maintenance of the facilitated states of pain behavior generated by tissue injury/inflammation and nerve injury.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Neuraxial Cytokines in Pain States","doi":"10.3389/fimmu.2019.03061","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2019.03061","venue":"Frontiers in Immunology"}

The stereochemistry of products formed in the reaction clearly suggest that the incipient carbanion at C3‚Ä≤ preferentially attacks the electron-deficient reagent from the Œ±-face of the sugar ring. Subsequently, the 3‚Ä≤-nitro group from 3, 14, 17 , 22 and 25 was removed by the action of Bu 3 SnH and AIBN to give 3‚Ä≤- C -substituted nucleosides 27 ‚Äì 44 [threo (major) and erythro (minor)] which suggested that the intermediary 3‚Ä≤-carbon radical abstracted the hydrogen atom preferentially from the Œ±-face. The stereochemistry of the products from the base-catalyzed addition reactions and free-radical promoted denitration reactions were ascertained by detailed structure analysis by NMR spectroscopy. The results presented in this paper is the first example of the preparation of C -branched nucleosides using the base catalyzed addition reaction at the Œ±-carbon of a nitro function in the sugar moiety of nucleoside.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"New synthesis of 3‚Ä≤--substituted nucleosides","doi":"10.1016/s0040-4020(01)81883-4","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/s0040-4020%2801%2981883-4","venue":""}
