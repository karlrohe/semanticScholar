Existing stereo-DIC calibration methods mainly rely on a well-made planar target with additional specific coding to perform pre-calibration. In this paper, a new method is proposed to calibrate a stereo-DIC system automatically with feature correspondences in an unconstrained scene. In contrast to traditional methods, the proposed method is scale-independent and does not require assumptions such as planarity. More importantly, it is capable of correcting disturbed external parameters in real time. With inverse depth parameterization, a stereo-DIC system can be effectively calibrated by a carefully designed bundle adjustment framework. Subsequently, a fast correction strategy based on massive-point subset tracking is derived to recalibrate the disturbed stereo-DIC system. The proposed method overcomes the predicament of reduced measurement accuracy due to the unavoidable disturbance of external parameters in dynamic deformation measurements. Experiments were conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Auto-calibration and real-time external parameter correction for stereo digital image correlation","doi":"10.1016/j.optlaseng.2019.03.018","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.optlaseng.2019.03.018","venue":""}

Ascorbate–glutathione (AsA–GSH) cycle is regarded as an essential mechanism for resistance of plants under stress conditions. In this study, the effects of 6-benzylaminopurine (BAP), a synthetic CK, on the growth, oxidative damage, AsA–GSH cycle metabolism, and hormone contents in the leaves of eggplant ( Solanum melongena L.) seedlings were investigated under 10 mM zinc (Zn) stress. Zn stress resulted in oxidative damage as evidenced by a decrease in eggplant growth and an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS, H 2 O 2 , and O 2 − ) formation and membrane damage (lipid peroxidation and electrolyte leakage). However, application of exogenous BAP significantly alleviated the growth inhibition and oxidative damage caused by Zn stress. Importantly, BAP further enhanced the redox states of AsA and GSH, and the related enzyme activities involved in the AsA–GSH cycle such as ascorbate peroxidase (APX), glutathione reductase (GR), dehydroascorbate reductase (DHAR), monodehydroascorbate reductase (MDHAR), and glutathione synthetase (GS) in eggplants grown under Zn stress. Quantitative analysis revealed that BAP could induce the transcript levels of MDHAR and GS , but not DHAR in AsA–GSH cycle under Zn stress or non-stress conditions. GR expression was further increased by BAP application in the leaves of eggplants under Zn stress. Moreover, BAP shifted the hormonal balance toward a substantial increase in the levels of CK and auxin (IAA) but a decrease in abscisic acid (ABA) content in the leaves with or without Zn treatment. The results of the present study strongly suggest that BAP-enhanced resistance of eggplants against Zn toxicity is associated with the regulation of AsA–GSH cycle metabolism as an effective antioxidant system and the balance of hormones.","inCitations":["fefc225d8a53485461d3356526051b47881c1d91","7e2c3c3e897b1c95fb84f61765a481044eeee59b","9ede99838e774928c44fb58b573c4c5d06e9ad48","7effa1facbc7e063501f5b08923bb16cebdc0d1d","8daf1ac8b2a84af1ac9b9eda228aa5f26dfbfe6b","56f4236b801febda3778280d592cdaa5d806918e","078d2dd982e943cf53cc931d981867dc01a1f719","53f8c326a4a1fbb573cad4390b7ae1fcbd996aef"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Modulation of zinc-induced oxidative damage in Solanum melongena by 6-benzylaminopurine involves ascorbate–glutathione cycle metabolism","doi":"10.1016/j.envexpbot.2015.03.004","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envexpbot.2015.03.004","venue":""}

Then any injective endomorphism of a finitely generated R-module is always an iso- morphism if and only if R is 0-dimensional, that is, if every prime ideal is maximal. This note aims at considering cases where an injective endo- morphism of a finitely generated module is, actually, an isomorphism. It is a simple exercise that artinian modules are endowed with this property (1, p. 23) and here we will show that the commutative rings for which the fact above is always true resemble artinian rings. A similar question on when surjective endomorphisms of finitely generated modules are isomorphisms was proved independently by Strooker (3) and the author (4) or (5) for any commutative ring, re- gardless of finite presentation (2, p. 35 ) or chain conditions (1, p. 23). For a commutative ring R, the result of this note says THEOREM. Any injective endomorphism of a finitely generated R- module is an isomorphism if and only if every prime ideal of R is maxi- mal. That the above condition is necessary, it is easy to see: If PCQ are two distinct primes in R, then any element xEQ-P induces, via multiplication, an injection of R/P which is not surjective. The con- verse takes longer to prove but it is just as easy. Consider thus a ring R with the aforementioned property, that is, of having Krull dimension 0, and let f be an injection of the finitely generated R-module M. This module can be made into an R(x)- module by defining x m=f(m) for m M.

Three percent of sera below the \"true B12\" (B12 binding to IF + R + Cbi) normal cut-off point were not below the cut-off point for normal \"total B12\" (B12 binding to IF + R); 6% of sera below the total B12 normal cut-off point were not below true B12 cut-off point. The correlations between Euglena gracilis and the radioassays were 0.80 and 0.83 in the 50 serum samples that also had E. gracilis serum vitamin B12 levels. Lactobacillus leichmannii serum vitamin B12 levels were determined in 49 of the 311 serum samples and results were comparable with results obtained by four radioassay binder systems: IF + R, IF + R + Cbi, highly purified hog IF, and saliva R binder. The closest correlate with L. leichmannii was radioassay using IF + R as binder (r = 0.93), then IF + R + Cbi (r = 0.92), pure IF (r = 0.80), and pure R (r = 0.73). The key to reliable results appears not to reside in a particular assay but rather in determining for each assay its own range of results in participants determined clinically and morphologically normal vs. participants with deficient vitamin B12 (with B12 deficiency defined independently of a serum B12 assay). When laboratory assay results differ from clinical judgment, further evaluation is the appropriate course. There is no \"gold standard\" for human serum vitamin B12 assay.","inCitations":["3cf5b47d374301e9fd8b25a021fc0719b70f915c","d6d33e13e1579485df6c438471942857ba8cbfd9","2838fd740536fd3e5d897eee7a0af8a347b8bc10","b197d20229b2790625d7b67461ccd22b33b7a0af","9378180ae774c41cf36efb75227465e99c1de17a"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Is there a \"gold standard\" for human serum vitamin B12 assay?","doi":"10.5555/uri:pii:0022214384902749","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.5555/uri%3Apii%3A0022214384902749","venue":"The Journal of laboratory and clinical medicine"}

Many analysts indicate the introduction of flexible jobs as the cause of employment growth. However, few researchers have established a causal relationship between labour market transformation and positive employment trends through a counterfactual framework. This paper presents a counterfactual model to estimate the effect on employment of introducing temporary work in 1997.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://www.aiel.it/page/old_paper/tajani.pdf"],"title":"Un modello per la valutazione d'impatto occupazionale del lavoro interinale in Italia","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

We used the Edward's recognition and estimation of cyclic trend method to study the seasonal variation of the incidence of rectal foreign body and Z-test to compare the seasonal incidences.\n\n\nRESULTS\nA total of 3359 hospitalizations with primary diagnosis of the rectal foreign body were reported from 2009 to 2011. The peak incidence of rectal foreign bodies was seen in October (peak/low ratio 1.20, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.10-1.32).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nData on seasonal variation of rectal foreign bodies are extremely limited. Further studies would be required to verify whether our findings of a higher incidence in the fall season are reflective of acute changes in the length of the days, climate, sleep-wake cycle, or decreased sexual intercourse at this time of the year. High suspicion at this time of the year may help promptly diagnose and avoid unnecessary investigations.","inCitations":["6cae9cb09252f56f6a8dabec42a066af7feb680f"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Seasonal Variation of Rectal Foreign Bodies: Data from Nationwide Inpatient Sample","doi":"10.4103/1947-2714.179959","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.4103/1947-2714.179959","venue":"North American journal of medical sciences"}

Do total dos efluentes, cerca de 10% correspondem ao estagio inicial de fabricacao do couro e o restante remanescente corresponde ? s demais etapas do processo como a neutralizacao, tintura, lavagem, etc. O uso de wetlands como alternativa no processo de tratamento de aguas residuais vem sendo empregado como alternativa, visto a tecnologia e manejo simples e de baixo custo em relacao a outros sistemas convencionais que, por apresentarem sistemas sofisticados de tratamento, proporcionam custos elevados. Visto ? problematica ambiental causada pela industria do couro, o presente trabalho avaliou um sistema wetland construido com macrofitas aquaticas flutuantes no pos-tratamento de efluente de um curtume de acabamento. A pesquisa foi realizada entre os dias 09/02 a 05/05/2006 na UNIOESTE/ Campus de Toledo, utilizando efluente proveniente de um curtume de acabamento de couro localizado no municipio de Toledo - PR, onde a materia prima e o couro wet-blue. O estudo foi baseado em dois sistemas: um utilizando-se a macrofita Eicchornia crassipes e outro a macrofita Salvinia sp. Os parâmetros avaliados foram: DQO, Nitrogenio Total Kjeldahl NTK, Fosfato Total, pH, O2 Dissolvido, e os ions (Cr, S, Al e Fe). O sistema II, operado com a macrofita Salvinia sp., apresentou problemas em relacao a concetracao de nutrientes fornecidos pelo efluente do curtume optando-se em operar somente com o Sistema I, onde foram avaliados 3 tempos de detencao hidraulicas (4, 6 e 8 dias). O Sistema I apresentou reducoes de 73,41% a 79,91% de DQO, 48,94% a 83,51% de Fosforo total, 59,24% a 67,93% de Nitrogenio total, 73,6% a 87,7% Cromo, 26,5% a 52% de Enxofre, 60 a 78% para o Ferro e 58,5% a 80,4% para o Aluminio. O principal limitante do sistema e o provavel responsavel pela morte das plantas no sistema II foi o Enxofre. De modo geral, o TDH de 6 dias foi o que apresentou melhores resultados em porcentagens de remocao.

These gridded data synthesize multiple satellite altimeter and wind model inputs to estimate both Geostrophic and Ekman-layer velocities. While the GC product was mostly devised and intended for open ocean studies, the present objective is to assess whether its data quality nearer the coast is suitable for other applications. The key ground truth sources are long-term mean and time series observations on the Northwestern Atlantic (NWA) shelf derived from Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers (ADCP) and high frequency (HF) radar networks in both the Mid-Atlantic Bight (MAB) and the Gulf of Maine (GoM). Results indicate that mean geostrophic currents across the MAB and the offshore GoM agree to roughly 10% in speed and 10 degree in direction with the in situ depth-averaged currents, with correlation levels of 0.5–0.8 at seasonal and longer time scales. Interior GoM comparisons at 5 coastal buoys show much less agreement. One likely source of GoM error is shown to be the GC mean dynamic topography near the coast. Comparison to near-surface MAB HF radar current measurements on the MAB shelf shows significant GC data improvement when including the surface Ekman term. Overall, the study results imply that application of GlobCurrent data may prove useful in coastal seas with broad continental shelves such as the MAB or Scotian shelf, but that large inaccuracies inside the GoM diminish its utility there.","inCitations":["e165920bef6e7aa0afc441cfa3235dedd8244eb4"],"pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.3390/rs10081205","https://res.mdpi.com/remotesensing/remotesensing-10-01205/article_deploy/remotesensing-10-01205.pdf?attachment=1&filename="],"title":"Examining the Accuracy of GlobCurrent Upper Ocean Velocity Data Products on the Northwestern Atlantic Shelf","doi":"10.3390/rs10081205","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.3390/rs10081205","venue":"Remote Sensing"}

Conversely, policy-makers and planners identify the need for policy-specific evidence to ensure policy decisions and practices are informed and validated by rigorously established evidence. In practice, however, these two aspirations rarely meet and a research-translation gap remains. The RESIDE project is a unique longitudinal natural experiment designed to evaluate the health impacts of the 'Liveable Neighbourhoods' planning policy, which was introduced by the Western Australian Government to create more walkable suburbs. This commentary provides an overview and discussion of the policy-specific study methodologies undertaken to quantitatively assess the implementation of the policy and assess its active living and health impacts. It outlines the key research-translation successes and impact of the findings on the Liveable Neighbourhoods policy and discusses lessons learnt from the RESIDE project to inform future natural experiments of policy evaluation.","inCitations":["06ec8046babec0ef45f254fc0f6d0184b9a0631b","f838ba4a78ddefa076760435056cffa5454cc4a3"],"pdfUrls":["https://res.mdpi.com/d_attachment/ijerph/ijerph-16-02448/article_deploy/ijerph-16-02448.pdf"],"title":"A Case Study of a Natural Experiment Bridging the ‘Research into Policy’ and ‘Evidence-Based Policy’ Gap for Active-Living Science","doi":"10.3390/ijerph16142448","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph16142448","venue":"International journal of environmental research and public health"}

In this essay I argue that this freedom is often still interpreted within a modern paradigm as an essential freedom of presence which has its roots in Neo-Platonic thinking. In Paul’ s letter to the Galatians there are insights to a different interpretation of the freedom we have in Christ as an eschatological freedom of calling and promise.  This freedom can only be grasped in faith and is never the possession of any one individual or community, but rather a continuous challenge. It is a freedom that creates space for the other (for that, that seemed impossible) to become present (possible) and therefore it finds itself between justice (dike) and mercy – justice, as that which creates space for those who do not have space (presence), the unheard voices and the marginalised voices; and mercy which brings these unheard voices (the non-present) into being. This is the freedom to which the Cross beckons and the Resurrection inspires.","inCitations":["b17c8a6db2d5680145f552ae4823849dfe5f97bf"],"pdfUrls":["https://repository.up.ac.za/bitstream/handle/2263/7759/Meylahn_Called(2005).pdf?isAllowed=y&sequence=1"],"title":"Called into the Freedom of Christ in a Postmodern Age and the Moral Debate","doi":"10.4102/ve.v26i3.248","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.4102/ve.v26i3.248","venue":""}

To design an encryption algorithm, we analyzed the encryption requirements to support scalability function in the scalable video and proposed an effective encryption method developed in the network abstraction layer (NAL). In addition, conditional access control scheme and key management scheme are proposed to consume the SVC bitstream protected with proposed method. Experiments were performed to verify the proposed method and results showed that proposed algorithms could provide an effective access control of scalable video as well as support a video encryption with scalability function.","inCitations":["9cf5754618c5f0f6e3db653da16be68abc452f95","0af7f8918977473c8ba14434c84fae70a284d859","b0783126bcc9ffe2518c759f7e4c3210dfc5ab57","01b771bf57c1acae534f5d759f5b6110f85aff20","2309d7427a72f836674b4bdcd12a56862d86efca","d8716ae99d55a8406ff94c355a6c81ace417a5ec","300bdaf61014dcefa482fd31dfb84e8bc98de6e9","a8587b5697d5859f97d31778b8299babb318354b","50089e889de5568934c75dab289e144d4d55cf89","88b979b6173246d7e0106c2b86ec1c395ee32ee6","afb0b653b74cbd6d2f745c058ec436d22973df7f","461711e4b6770f3c32026b3ce240ce69e25c8451","674e459b5b576af7d582619bfe7d02f8e3a2b312","ce2c9245f3f018a8120e25726f7189f038ddd162","7498833b3b01d7de7f2bf0f2ef6a1ad16ff68831","004e87b0fe97553c32647780d7162c07a01db879","cf178631f9d911646955435ffb11be84176881d2","eb8852219b467506734199b2fb6f97de18e553cb","24ff5b0efbcd054785147cd40615ccbb182325d6","05ec729cb419924ccd9f11ceb76873f715f9360e","f1593ab4d7daebb5bcc0fd45ec203d7f39a5d55c","529ccc19e5a21b5f412fdd91cc4279fa11eefe79","4bfc3ae22e9d2e1785b6fbadb711006e62fb9ef5","197eaafdff8ca0109eecd76b0314125ef0eaef70","8cd601efd72250257cb2df07996eea3bdc893d74","8015212052b72b433fdfa1a52ad0a2f52c226f59","e7cab7886cf88fb2cf3812827d56939083aa09e5","5cb49c266c7d626c79186ef6d80784af6195fa41","971519b384ee181a6d7ed8a9a2550a3232626de3","2c5c02c13df920912e9ea51892276e4514a7690a","aac8931affdac7e4561f01abfd7bc1a509e334b5","8dddd02ffb268588f96e5637375254e2c02f2627","8e4f1a06ee6085281b0de1cb4407cc85dd2a18e0","c9599d13e5965657558ebf0a68e72454cfcb359b","ee7456b490b7cd0c2cd69cd231fa4ff0f8896ace","6ce30a63027d825528921ecd7e29b46d3aa89bfa"],"pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1007/11922841_33"],"title":"Scalable Protection and Access Control in Full Scalable Video Coding","doi":"10.1007/11922841_33","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/11922841_33","venue":"IWDW"}

However, women's employment characteristics and child care problems were significantly related to emotional well-being. Interaction effects between child care and employment were also explored. Mothers who had concerns about child care were more likely to report depressive symptoms when they had good-quality jobs (higher wages) or when they had only one job or were not unemployed.","inCitations":["e24e4dee5c775716a0cb23323d2029e65f797552","ed380d0aa85212a7853139fcb674ae13da545ab7","ea67455b73626aea016ebd8af1195ee71203e1af","072a0c3f12e09cc2aab269f17af7b8e23dfe79ca","23d9ab251256b5cdc0f2e6bc68aa964858cfd74a","93380a19556f2691125e58dac4a166c511e01b63","58b4ab75a17cf20d67efe1dca960aab059418248","59972e4be5d4c55939f2c6127b6db9d0bf10701e","8ae5bd2567ff6428ec4847db95ba8e4544741996","482a888025df5fffb1fd959661140bb2ff63f3dc","59f0d51aece37c778379482dbf46d0a89bcc0845","c82f57c21ee3f8d21a87e88932ea59a8b75ee3e5","ed61bf5cb4911b73be4417388b93f9ceb5f9d8f0","81f5ff55e9cf2a586010c494bac0c129b0bd3c83","bf47da60dea13aaa793cec950a80587f4f059c71","2e64bec2ce05d170eb976be25d2a3649c5216a86"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Child Care, Work, and Depressive Symptoms Among Low-Income Mothers","doi":"10.1177/0192513X05285292","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1177/0192513X05285292","venue":""}

In wild relatives of pigeonpea (Atylosia, Rynchosia and Dunbaria sp.), there is a wider range of variation (4 to 12 ds/m) in salinity tolerance. A. albicans and Atylosia platycarpa were the two most tolerant wild types that could grow up to 12 ds/m. Salinity tolerance seems to be associated with exclusion of sodium and chloride from the shoot system, high potassium/sodium selectivity and high retention of sodium and chloride in the root system. These physiological traits, which are believed to be responsible for the higher level of tolerance to salinity in A. albicans, were uniformly expressed in the F1 hybrids (reciprocal crosses of A. albicans (tolerant) X pigeonpea genotype ICP 3783 (sensitive) suggesting that salinity tolerance is a dominant genetic factor. There was a positive growth response in pigeonpea genotypes with increasing calcium levels in the medium during salinity. The differences between tolerant and sensitive genotypes were maintained irrespective of the external calcium and sodium levels within a given salinity level (6 or 8 ds/m). The symbiotic ability of pigeonpea under saline conditions varied depending on the rhizobial strains, with IC 3087 and IC 3506 being more efficient than IC 3024, IC 3484 and IC 3195.","inCitations":["465fe1196b6927099c23e6e384a9f841c1440c24","57c542155986248fe0f84658d7dcb7953db2847f","fc89c55daafa1095476876aa7aa78e87ea8898f6","f563e1b02642bc189d6bd067f346d6886e7cafb2","fab77804ddcf718c16ca01982846045061ae99e2","cd56c75d5f7103f51be8adb60255aa2147c62f84","cc72b4e2e421407b6ffa4b5dc99b95634e27e3d3","6343c1f8015b384ff9f8819142b27e47267c2771"],"pdfUrls":["http://oar.icrisat.org/2707/1/59095.pdf"],"title":"Salinity tolerance in pigeonpea (Cajanus cajan (L.)

Colombia is the second largest producer outside Southeast Asia and the largest producer in South and Central America. The expansion of oil palm crop in Colombia has a great potential for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, because it is planted in areas covered by low biomass vegetation. The first step for reducing these greenhouse gas emissions is to quantify them, and the carbon footprint is the algebraic sum of the greenhouse gas sequestration and emissions caused directly or indirectly by an individual, organization or product for a defined period of time. For that, the objective of this study was to determine the carbon footprint of the crop stage, i.e of production of oil palm fresh fruit bunches in an experimental field, representative of a well managed plantation in Colombia. Following the Colombian Technical Standard NTC 6000, one ton of oil palm fresh fruit bunches was established as a functional unit; inputs, activities and processes directly or indirectly involved in the production of oil palm fresh fruit bunches were inventoried, and the carbon footprint balance between sequestration and greenhouse gas emissions was estimated using the Ecoinvent database and emission factors of the SimaPro 7.0 software. CO2 capture by the crop was higher than greenhouse gas emissions associated: for each ton of oil palm fresh fruit bunches produced, 606 kg of CO2 were fixed. N2O was the most significant greenhouse gas emitted during the crop stage, and the activities in descending order that contributed most to the greenhouse gas emissions were the use of chemical nitrogen fertilizers, transport of bunches to the processing plant, land use change and the energy used in transport and tractor traction. Since carbon footprint is a benchmark for internal management or mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions, a mitigation plan was drawn up to improve the carbon balance, by increasing the use of organic fertilizers: planting oil palms on degraded land or with low biomass accumulation; using oil palm biodiesel as a substitute for fossil fuels; improving the yield of oil palm fresh fruit bunches through increased production efficiency; and by producing biochar at the time of replanting. These integrated strategies that in descending order have different effects into the carbon balance could increase the eco-efficiency of the oil palm in terms of carbon sequestration for Colombian oil palm agribusiness.","inCitations":["aa1c531886870effd51c6f6ee8174c78e6985920","9a34f7c33499b4920a95b91f43e43b589e8079b1","2e67e04ee9b440f61276ed3d16a9ff442cb8fe33","16dcd0464add196cf30c3b86109c0c134069d194","2899ca9e1ac088c9315e677b8245474a01103aa6"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Carbon footprint of the production of oil palm (Elaeis guineensis) fresh fruit bunches in Colombia","doi":"10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.02.149","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.02.149","venue":""}

The lambs were 6–7 weeks old during exposure to the novel foods. Lambs that ate novel foods for 16 min per day for 5 days with their mothers consumed about twice (P<0.05) as much of the foods after weaning as lambs that ate the foods with a dry ewe. Lambs exposed alone five times to the novel foods consumed about half (P<0.05) as much as lambs that ate with a dry ewe. Lambs did not learn to eat novel foods by observing, but not concurrently participating, while social models (mother, ewe) ate the foods. However, lambs that observed their mother eat and subsequently avoid a harmful food, ate less (P<0.05) after weaning than lambs that had observed the food only during exposure. Results were the same when lambs were tested 2 months later.","inCitations":["5de0d52490ff1512b57b95f03e47fe5bdc7174da","610fcf213f38f73a4fe25f11dbc6eb835201e717","50dbe67b3b60fd8ea94c2de590fba5ded5a5f6f1","7b266f64d7af14c38bd7e8005e357a747fc96083","128c04b4d930d748b738430af624c82c3874773f","dd9432db6e6f45bb3bfc5889adbca5c0a876e63f","badf41f1b85378b3d824098c17333d546c452b74","7709a73860ca92fd0b762cae7dc429475e02c4e4","8ae9b50c9e03822cfdf1cc49053319b5748eff92","a5905ec5ad724077af5f15f52b08e26c42579de1","5ce824c5f1ec731101bf6652db85ed7a26ac23b7","9c5cb3269903d6c8ad4c5564ce2f9ea3b289d49b","1d98c947ac7f1ab6d2e7bcec1e54791f898c2d51","8b272e957124380f1f838ecde791b4173f7b169f","de1e99ff86d818b69a5b8dfca547a6647e5f9d78","d83fedfcbee66a25cd2f5951ee161b118a6ef77e","944e6f5f28f730dd6de92ea7ee1ad9ef778c6d6f","ca7db6f58ca25f466b09ecb40f27abd404568963","9d3d4061e566b16f05be361374d0679015ffc653","e31d99075181e83f55a15181a3d037fbab8bdb85","fbc89a9d7d687bca8d92e9a053f4dfdbd4dbcce3","dff0fc8bd2f63e5d54816aabcaa1d2526a18d9e0","d25c77c70d810eb4833ebe87df9aeb503ca08321","5d69bdfd2f4251c2b75704ecd6d1979f7aa5a2e3","33f5a6c944eeeb91c8a5f7f8a413a86d75b22037","4b4e6da26bcb135a374daa4936601c2e4beb0337","b5614a7ab1c8e17d26f7cd965a701aa67a70cc9c","68d0ddcfc06bf23fbbda28c3c906138f8bb30d67","92a0280454113b6029f367eb6b3e4d4161d381c3","4be0a6ce83b24973122dcd99ac4ab4f97f948c08","2162c211d9368548ae9ef34098d19e53597a3dce","be736cad00f49896378c60b16f7d9dc8850d17e9","3d5bbfb87d3751e945e67efa2038e47d2d52e0fb","0459bdfb00d781e0f956b5f20b79fb98e8cce35e","3d61fa649f62b1501750fc251c540bfbfc6136c5","853b1aafa734db47aefe1f1d0a122add42f0ecac","cb58cabb9de47815d7161878af5d25b4bed3502d","832db3ce749cb18047be51f49e2d1b2f79014514","4449bbb4b4536fe4530ee4a6924b9419865019b1","41a86d63f8b02890e6ad033702f77941d6ca71a1","701312347107c4b8539cbc0c747852fe231bfb64","af7fc3944e1ebc674f3c95f5c616afcbc0025341","b9aa2a4aba9598cb458c254d48afa143ead1c5a0","b23396b4f6ac4ff10abb678cdebf8a67a544c4c0","3b53ea4a767abe3206820bc295a9e71c1c2de087","379914f98f464350155f74f0521c861988a029ed","02228e4f773b473e34d667b5f5f1c429dea18d07","899207d1e1fdcf5a47863359c44aa15b9196c163","02bb1df914fb760162d6795a557188d94d7d63dc","16a1f67cc577f891916502745de39d2a052af8fd","4d1e8d7467f9fbd878128b48dc140f062fb26081","2866605bfbc485221542f486598f7e532cfd6345","668a24165722c54a1d4918a4cc4c0a1a7ebe8259","4ddf5a794732b85a427ecba632618831f92ff43a","4027347a7d14b885394bb67fe028eff4def1b639","1e4f1157b881077b191f5e29343a28112185f088","78de0b6d90fd6ff885148302b5a86f50badfc5ba","733a898033a370fff952857edca326ed93128c9f","9bdbab9719b5be90be3ef55e6566170945ebfbc4"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Ability of lambs to learn about novel foods while observing or participating with social models","doi":"10.1016/0168-1591(90)90066-M","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/0168-1591%2890%2990066-M","venue":""}

The horse is one of the few domestic species in which the conceptus-derived pregnancy recognition signal has not been identified. The presence of the conceptus reduces pulsatile prostaglandin F(2α) secretion by the endometrium during early gestation in the mare, partly attributed to the reduced expression of cyclooxygenase-2. Cyclooxygenase-2 has therefore been suggested as one of the regulators of endometrial prostaglandin F(2α) release modified by the antiluteolytic factor secreted by the conceptus. In addition, altered oxytocin responsiveness has been implicated in the adjustment of prostaglandin release in pregnant mares. While conceptus mobility has proven to be essential for establishment of pregnancy, conceptus-derived oestrogens and prostaglandins, principally prostaglandin E(2), have not been confirmed as the critical antiluteolytic factor. Various ways to induce prolonged luteal function in the non-pregnant mare will be highlighted in the current review, specifically, how they may pertain to the process of maternal recognition of pregnancy. Furthermore, recently published microarray experiments comparing the transcriptome of pregnant and non-pregnant endometria and different stages of conceptus development will be reviewed. Findings include the prevention of conceptus adhesion, the provision of nutrients to the conceptus and the avoidance of immunological rejection, among others.","inCitations":["fa08dc200441d790f9a819003310f01be3b1a10c","d58dd7562de84ed950ca3fce223c6a5dbd05bf9a","aeb197357b0f91d1de0bcca88558f059b4a136b5","cffa7c7c2caf5e5a28a125ce32f52d494981ed28","f671bc0a5028f6e5e01e40d6eaa0045e68f17ba5","e2963996587c01a97946faf3f02f32dbfa657146","12bebef917ec89227aefba4c33a64b4cadeab1cc","0fe619426bff1488773d19bae6b18407c74bcee3","1a55bafda46d908550f525c0f2bd3e90dae25f34","37e6607865299fc373be8397605e15c3cb76e48c","2810636464f04bcc677172903ec1b526fc8b11cc","471b5561c6cf2bbd0c18e3d7b93bfe03b2c7dec1","01aa46c00e33a7ac42a1a3dc986894b1f02f5363","35b5179fbe3cc67b8d39e6b090efe1ca667732bc","baeaa08fbdd947c3555aa20fd2b82a02d7c30632","a93577385a448b19f3f58d647e80d6a1e12e4b2a","815270f35126454e3306ed86fa49856371aaa319","4052423dc3cb2be2eec29e743ffca3c3bd840b3c"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Maternal recognition of pregnancy in the horse: a mystery still to be solved.","doi":"10.1071/RD10294","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1071/RD10294","venue":"Reproduction, fertility, and development"}

One of the most prominent landform groups from earlier glacial stages, and the most diagnostic for ice sheet reconstruction, is a set of lateral moraines. In this paper, we describe these lateral moraines within a key area around Kvikkjokk, northern Sweden. Position of these lateral moraines in relation to the last deglaciation patterns indicates that they were formed before the last glacial maximum (LGM). The location and morphology of moraines show that they were deposited by a mountain centred ice sheet with outlet glaciers along major valleys, emanating from the highlands west of the Kvikkjokk area. This ice sheet was likely less than 170-km wide and no more than 600-m thick. Climatologically and glaciologically, we expect the relict lateral moraines to have been deposited before 75 ka BP (marine oxygen isotope stage 4). Their preservation is a consequence of subsequent overriding of nonerosive cold-based ice. Ice-marginal landforms and deposits from mountain centred ice sheet configurations in Fennoscandia are scarce. Therefore, the relict lateral moraines are important tools for reconstructing these elusive early glacial stages, possibly correlated to the ice sheet inception.","inCitations":["429fddff2c71b1b1c78b183a41a9245e18c1212b","86da9043bc1b96531231903fcc9eb4bf66242db3","57164918505afe0edd8f7714aa4776f42248ff38","8145ce924fc1e99bc1c0c6e7ab4492490f985c52","7094703207b662a387b4481f66c3c05c5cc7b0c2","8a3bbe9399514da93d46a31e4d3dc5b97b4b2994","3263f30d0146e8003876ef69a7c0f6dc349c7e02","eece604b0e75e52b550c91843df1a18ef9202af5","030386d23c09f5a1490dd61a45d5d0f356127e15","02ca04f3ef43cf990a843164f82e92038de67288"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Relict lateral moraines in northern Sweden—evidence for an early mountain centred ice sheet","doi":"10.1016/S0037-0738(01)00249-4","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/S0037-0738%2801%2900249-4","venue":""}

Acute respiratory complications are also common after pediatric hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT), accounting for a high proportion of HSCT-related morbidity and mortality. Evaluation of these patients requires a thorough workup that includes identification and treatment of infectious etiologies, and treatment for noninfectious causes once infectious causes are ruled out. These patients should be closely monitored for development of pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome (PARDS) with early escalation of respiratory support. Patients undergoing a trial of noninvasive ventilation (NIV) should be continuously monitored to ensure they are responding. Prolonged delay of endotracheal intubation in patients who do not improve or worsen on NIV could worsen their outcome. Optimal treatment of immunocompromised patients with acute lung failure requires early and aggressive lung protective ventilation, prevention of fluid overload, and rapid diagnosis of underlying causes to facilitate prompt disease-directed therapy.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Acute Respiratory Failure and Management","doi":"10.1007/978-3-030-01322-6_11","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-01322-6_11","venue":"Critical Care of the Pediatric Immunocompromised Hematology/Oncology Patient"}

In the geothermal field “Los Humeros”, located between the borders of the states of Puebla and Veracruz, Mexico was realized a forest health monitoring to know the assessment could have these emissions of sulphur (S) and other two chemical elements measured by their concentrations on leaf tissues in the surrounding forests. For it were evaluated the forest healthy and pest insects registered at 20 stands of which were chosen completely at random 40 trees in total/site of the species Pinus montezumae and P. teocotein natural stands and plantations and picked up leaf tissue samples representatives per stand to determine the contents of sulphur (S), boron (B) and arsenic (As) representing each forest stand. The results of the study revealed that the presence of forest pests are not related to the proximity of the sites to emissions from stationary sources of emissions and moreover the amount of these 3 chemical substances monitored do not have none influence on the forest healthy sites condition, except for the Monterey pine aphid Essigella califórnica Essig, which seems to be directly associated with higher Boron content in the needles (mean=167.47± 32.15, and peak 635.46 ppm) and proximity of emission sources geothermal vents or where it is believed all these chemical elements are carried down by air currents to specific points and deposited in the stands. The general model obtained and with significance of R=56.6 and P value 0.0033 for the presence of Monterey Pine aphid and the three main pollutants released from smoke plumes in geothermal systems is [D: Essigella]= -0.2088 + 1.880E-0.5 (A:SO4)+ 0.002245 (B:B) + 1.248 (C:As).

For the TEH system, the triangular phase diagram is found to be dominated by a liquid crystalline phase at 25°C whereas a large portion of this phase melts to give a single-phase microemulsion at 35°C. For the hexadecane system, the single phase region in the triangular phase diagram is much smaller than that for TEH. These single-phase regions are almost isolated from the water/surfactant or oil/surfactant axes for both the oils. Since the surfactant is a commercial surfactant and contains many components with different polyoxyethylene chains, the theory for multisurfactant systems was applied to evaluate the hydrophilic-lipophilic balance (HLB) of HCO10. The HLB number of this surfactant is calculated by mixing it with a pure polyoxyethylene-type surfactant, C12EO6, whose HLB number is known.

Three experiments tested the interpretation of negative utterances of the form “X is not Y”. The first experiment compared novel and conventional metaphors presented outside a specific context. Results showed that both familiar utterances (He is not my son) and unfamiliar ones (This is not a court of law) were interpreted nonliterally. The second experiment examined the set of novel metaphors only. This time participants were asked to rate the appropriateness of the interpretations provided, which ranged between metaphorical and literal. Results showed that negative utterances were more metaphorical (M=4.94 SD=0.88) than their affirmative counterparts (M=2.70 SD= 0.85). In the third experiment the novel negative utterances were embedded in strong contexts, either biased toward the literal or toward nonliteral interpretation of the targets. Reading times of the negative utterances in their respective contexts were measured. Results did replicate previous findings (in Hebrew) testifying to the temporal priority of the nonliteral interpretation. Rather, in Russian, the literal and nonliteral interpretations took similarly long to read. How people process statements containing negation remains an open question in the field of linguistics. Several recent theories claim that negated items are eliminated from mental representation during the initial stages of processing (500-1000ms following their offset) and posit a „suppression operator‟ at work. Hasson & Glucksberg (2006), for example, in their online study, presented subjects with statements of the type „X is/is not Y‟ (e.g., „This lawyer is a shark‟, „This lawyer is not a shark‟). After the statement disappeared from the screen, subjects were presented with a pair of words, one of which has an affirmative-related meaning while the other has a negative-related meaning (e.g. vicious/gentle). The subjects were to decide which word was appropriate to the statement she had just read. They found that in the early stages of representation (150 and 500ms), the choice of affirmative statements was facilitated, even by those who had read the negative statements. In later stages (1000ms), the negative-related stages were not accessible to memory. These results lead authors to conclude that during the initial stages of comprehension, negation is actually presented as affirmation. MacDonald and Just (1989) argue that there is a difference in the mental representation of negative as opposed to affirmative statements. In their study, subjects were presented with a statement containing two items, one a negated item and one an affirmative item (e.g., „Almost every weekend, Elizabeth baked some bread but no cookies‟). After that, they read a sentence like „Elizabeth baked some bread‟ or „Elizabeth baked some cookies‟ and were asked to decide if the sentence was true or false. It was found that the participants had more difficulties with negated items as compared to the affirmative ones. The authors state that the fact that the negated items were still on the subjects‟ minds, leads them conclude that „they could not have emerged had negated information been either initially inaccessible or initially accessible but rendered inaccessible later on due to suppression processes assumed obligatory following negation‟ (MacDonald & Just, 1989). However, once enough processing time is allowed, negation results in suppression of negated concepts, so that negated items are either discarded from the mental representation altogether or replaced by an available opposite. This unstable nature of interpreting negation can probably be explained by the fact that understanding negation includes consideration of an alternative situation. The negation markers only shift the focus to the actual state of affairs. This model of interpreting situations was presented by studies of text understanding (Glenberg and Mathew, 1992; Glenberg et al, 1987; Zwaan and Radvansky, 1998; Zwaan et al 2002). The findings of Kaup et al. (2006) support the view that in the process of comprehension, there is a certain „tipping point‟ when our attention shifts away from the negated state of affairs onto the actual state of affairs. The shift of focus onto the actual state of affairs takes a certain amount of time. Kaup et al. (2006) presented subjects with positive and negative sentences in isolation and a picture of actual and counterfactual state of affairs and then with a picture of either an actual or counterfactual state of affairs. When the pictures were shown 750 ms after reading the sentences, the visual answers matched the meaning of the positive phrases but not the negative one. After 1500ms, the result was opposite. The authors conclude that the findings support the view that there is a certain „tipping point‟ in the process of comprehension when our attention shifts away from the negated state of affairs onto the actual state of affairs. Thus the focus on the actual state of affairs takes certain time. A similar study was carried out by Kaup in 2001(2001). In that study, subjects also had a self-paced reading of statements whose sentences contained both negative and affirmative items (e.g. „Almost every weekend, Mary bakes some bread but no cookies‟ and „Elizabeth tided up her drawers. She burned the old letters but not the photographs‟). In this experiment, probes were presented 2.5sec after the end of each statement. Consistent with the MacDonald and Just (1989) study, the results showed that matching negative probes took significantly more time. Another finding was that when the visual representation of the negated term was absent from the scene and the non-negated term was present, the response latencies were the longest (the example of Mary). But when the negated term was present and the non-negated one was absent, the difference in response latencies between the affirmative and the negative terms was smaller (the example of Elizabeth). Findings also show that when sufficient processing time (1500ms) is allowed, negated concepts are often replaced by an alternative opposite (Kaup, Lüdtke, & Zwaan, 2006), should it be available (Mayo, Schul, & Burnstein, 2004). Thus, while 750msec following its offset, open in not open lost initial levels of activation. However, after an additional 750 msec, it was replaced by an opposite “closed” (Kaup et al., 2006). Similarly, between 150-500 msec following their offset, negated and non-negated concepts (not a rocket /a rocket) were both represented as “fast”, but at 1000ms following their offset, their initial levels of activation were preserved following affirmative contexts only, in which this meaning was contextually compatible. Following negative targets, however, their initial levels of activation were reduced to baseline levels. Ferguson, Sanford, & Leuthold (2008) report a study consisting of two experiments in which they explored the role of context in perception of negation. The first experiment used an eye movement technique to discover if there is a difference between matching negated and nonnegated words that had appeared in a prior context with a congruent and a incongruent sentence. The results of this experiment showed that participants‟ eye movement behavior revealed no influence of the negated discourse on the initial stages of the target sentence processing. The situation, however, was different in the later stages. The authors suggest that longer reading times reflect subjects‟ attempts to relate the new information to the wider discourse context. Another experiment in this study was an ERP measurement. Here again, it was shown that there is a delay in negative context influence. Results revealed that the mental presentation is not updated immediately but rather, it requires time to compare the incoming information with the real world situation. This conclusion is consistent with other investigations on the topic (Giora, 2006; Horn, 2001; Israel, 2004; Jespersen, 1924; and Pearce & Rautenberg, 1987) An alternative view to the suppression hypothesis – the suppression/retention hypothesis has been proposed by Giora and colleagues. This view argues that suppression following negation is not obligatory, but rather is sensitive to discourse goals and requirements. Information will be disposed of when it is deemed unnecessary or obstructive, regardless of negation. In this respect, negation is not different from affirmation both might lead to suppression or retention of concepts depending on specific contextual information and the speaker‟s intent (Giora, 2006). In their study of lexical decision, Giora et al. (2005a) presented subjects with affirmative and negative statements of the type „X is/is not Y‟ (e.g., „The instrument is sharp‟ and „The instrument is not sharp‟). After 100ms, subjects were to decide whether the target word („sharp‟) was consistent with its affirmative/negated meaning. And in this initial stage the affirmative probe word („piercing‟) was chosen. Thus, according to Giora and colleagues (Giora, 2006; Giora, Fein at al., 2007), both negated and non-negated concepts can either maintain their initial levels of activation or allow their gradual reduction up to baseline levels and below, depending on discourse factors (the suppression/retention hypothesis, Giora, 2003). As opposed to the received view, then, in this respect, negation and affirmation are not different; they do not exhibit asymmetric effects even when later processes are involved (Giora 2006, 2007; Giora, Balaban et al., 2005; Giora, Fein et al., 2005). Indeed, more recent studies have shown that when negated concepts are not presented in isolation but rather are embedded in a supportive context, they need not be suppressed and replaced by an alternative. They can be retained if deemed useful for the unfolding context. Thus, when negated concepts (e.g., „The t","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://humanities1.tau.ac.il/linguistics_eng/images/stories/Nadezhda_Samokhin_MA_2012.pdf"],"title":"Negation in Context : Non-Literal Interpretation of Novel Metaphors in Russian","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

To fully determine whether the execution of saccades is affected by age, the authors examined detailed kinematics of vertical and horizontal saccades across a range of saccadic amplitudes (4°, 8°, and 12°). Ten younger and 20 older adults participated in each experiment. Whereas in the 1st experiment, the authors assessed volitionally generated saccades, in the 2nd experiment, they evaluated reflexively generated saccades. The results of those experiments showed that the saccadic motor system is relatively impervious to the effects of aging; in fact, the differences between vertical and horizontal saccades were more evident than were differences between saccades produced by younger and older adults. The authors discuss possible reasons for that relative resistance to aging.","inCitations":["d3a10cfca10ffe4895cf2aac854f76c5113b6f0e","cb461d2acf0ecd89281740cc7548f55178bbea8b","c5b23037cfb9acf1db952dd856f60ff61c136728","cde0b2fc70028e1f352da92eeff9a1159fd87d10","9159dff19eb6c87e1a8f689639c926396b6dc1a8","733e2d0849e9da8d69aa83e284f90f5e61d251eb","e2579267ab0300d57f2d74e9a8a7c9c9f3d0a389","7dfef364ab5c2ccf60180dc696c5c5b607b7bcf7","4a800fc4d35ff8dfce0c9a31f075ccdc0c7c45fd","1cce58e84108ae3f779f78cfa60d8471ac2b6e5d","4f514a7af0d66636e1900b38eca20388201374f6","cf9a76577c15c82df63167374c9392c3f4fcca6f","827f7e3ed979f5f58ab8ffa52ac0634ba7a5654b","a37e047e96c12ca97b994bac5cc9b120c99aa2f6","098a753a0ae520b2798a3c226292d3d502eb4a39","2ab18b92ac4a5be6580e508d6d5a81d42a4834e6","a27bf6049791d827024bbbf3cfc378edea8b50f9","52f082660df9c2462c62ef5deab9705b0bbf8936","8d474cf37a7d253a6bd1b1312870288fdb217b8f","9615e552b95e232f00c2e95679c006f6bc65374b","b3565c8f1ecd60194bb87e656d094b5eb9757904","0c9530ea0fad1c66c2f448ce444d07ba80aa9431","db434ec8d6fb9c961b2f45ae640784eb0484db78","4987c56201a366eb8c0d6469d0be9b3fc8a2f60c","17e338b6ef5243b1ea28e5b82b44585472f373c7","7e44424171e344e1d2a0ce8cee3f957a5148e456","91cab324f56c24a834afdd5bc187874b3a8e7751","6eb8c693005d15143194969efb115ad42d2cbd52","0f2f1dc62c36db739b0a02b1d8c63862820484f7","318040ba628228211b669adfd3eaa5b0ba9df1a4","fc905254729a7e164285c4b11633d2d9c98e1531","6d2bb60e7293164e92017bbbaee96d5e07fa1f09","525caee16c97dbd305465e40a2e927cbac49a406","88f115de6cb37e9290b747387eca5f322af30d01","b3b8e977645253ba562d31e3d434bd61db3e77ea","70598acee0aabf49ad2737626c55ca16f4dce2ec","0258f7909849ffeb979094e234fc7b044bc73bde","4cb50932441587ad890c9326f20884824408ea23","a58574a9d67d12340ec7e972ae286850fbd90a07","98479ef2ab0a9bf10872ba49a6c9226bcfa4f10c"],"pdfUrls":["http://psych.unl.edu/mdodd/VAMP/PDW_JMB.pdf"],"title":"Growing Older Does Not Always Mean Moving Slower: Examining Aging and the Saccadic Motor System","doi":"10.3200/JMBR.38.5.373-382","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.3200/JMBR.38.5.373-382","venue":"Journal of motor behavior"}

TH could induce radical polymerizations of MMA and methyl acrylate with a considerably high rate, and the rate of polymerization (Rp) of MMA was found to follow the equation: Rp = k[TH]0,3 [MMA]1,6. The overall activation energy and the chain transfer constant to TH for this polymerization were determined to be 47,7 kJ/mol and 0,52, respectively. From these results, an initiation mechanism involving a hydrogen-transfer from TH to MMA was proposed, which is similar to Mayo's initiation mechanism for the thermal polymerization of styrene. To confirm this mechanism, the spin trapping technique was applied. The results obtained regarding the trapping of the initiating radicals supported this hydrogen-transfer initiation mechanism.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Application of spin trapping technique to radical polymerization, 13 Polymerization of methyl methacrylate with 1,2,3,10a‐tetrahydrophenanthrene‐1,2‐dicarboxylic anhydride","doi":"10.1002/macp.1977.021780505","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1002/macp.1977.021780505","venue":""}
