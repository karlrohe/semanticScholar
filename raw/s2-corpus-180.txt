The analysis will be divided into three parts after an overview of Third Way opportunities in France over the whole period considered. The false continuation between the focus on localism and the autonomy of schools will first be explored. The second part will address the true break with the school model of the first modernity: the ideal of equal opportunities, public confidence in the state, and separation between schooling and common social life.

The process of diapedesis involves the selective disruption of endothelial cell junctions, which could compromise vascular integrity. It is therefore somewhat surprising that neutrophil transmigration does not significantly impair endothelial barrier function. We examined whether neutrophils might secrete factors that promote vascular integrity during the latter stages of neutrophil transmigration, in particular, the role of neutrophil serine proteinase 3 (PR3).\n\n\nMETHODS AND RESULTS\nEndothelial cells were treated with PR3 either in its soluble form or in a complex form with cell surface NB1. We observed that PR3 mediated the enhancement of endothelial cell junctional integrity and that this required its proteolytic activity, as well as endothelial cell expression of the protease-activated receptor-2. Importantly, PR3 suppressed the vascular permeability changes and disruption of junctional proteins induced by the action of protease-activated receptor-1 agonists.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThese findings establish the potential for neutrophil-derived PR3 to play a role in reestablishing vascular integrity after leukocyte transmigration and in protecting endothelial cells from protease-activated receptor-1-induced permeability changes that occur during thrombotic and inflammatory events.","inCitations":["14a1f5ef4a5b53f6ee261126600c993a6ae62d34","e86821b902e364741da26d25383c055b1b4aa097","4b72733268fca72c191778ff28697d3f2d638bcd","6d96ae352767e143641360c71e91a5f12ec67db0","105aa161941a55686cd899a0af684bac03075c5c","8ec3a85ae7e8b66ed1dc31f6d27b720c24d14ad3","2f18f070bc8ae98589f9331976cba5c953eac9db","0455d153f88095a539b9e8607b3341f9f96568fb","8aaac16122e44d83168e3dea70440b59eead77d9","abee4c02e54731abc4ddde3f6b09f4d470abd154","1329303f63d09fd568b83949bb88b8423fa08e80","03761fe384e852b1248ba69a8212951226ad177b","1e2c2beafc19f74c14cf3f1c44d1a829d96c9dcf"],"pdfUrls":["http://atvb.ahajournals.org/content/atvbaha/33/2/275.full.pdf","http://atvb.ahajournals.org/content/atvbaha/early/2012/11/29/ATVBAHA.112.300474.full.pdf","http://atvb.ahajournals.org/content/atvbaha/early/2012/11/29/ATVBAHA.112.300474.full.pdf?download=true","http://atvb.ahajournals.org/content/atvbaha/33/2/275.full.pdf?download=true"],"title":"Neutrophil proteinase 3 acts on protease-activated receptor-2 to enhance vascular endothelial cell barrier function.","doi":"10.1161/ATVBAHA.112.300474","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1161/ATVBAHA.112.300474","venue":"Arteriosclerosis, thrombosis, and vascular biology"}

The fragment recoil anisotropy (β=1.25±0.15) was found to be independent of the fragment vibrational states. Between λdiss=275 and 295 nm β assumes a value of 1.6±0.2, which exceeds the value expected for a simple impulsive process. Photofragment yield measurements carried out by PTS between 272 and 286 nm revealed a strong fluctuation of the vibrational state distribution with λdiss.

This program was developed because a software gap exists between the workstation-based research phase of a signal processing project and the more contained prototyping phase. The transition requires a shift from a workstations rich environment into an embedded system that typically offers only basic system software. The gap reflects more than just a lack of software tools. It concerns new challenges such as: parallel decomposition, optimizing data transfer, heterogeneous processing, interfacing with I/O devices, memory constraints, as well as real-time throughput and latency challenges. Mercury has bridged the indicated software gap by delivering on this program a deployment-focused environment for algorithms created in a popular research language, MATLAB (and its companion SIMULINK). The project has had the full cooperation of The Math Works, owner of MATLAB and SIMULINK. Mercury's discussions with Prime Contractors building large, embedded systems had shown MATLAB to be nearly universal tool of choice within the research phase of these projects. Demand for a MATLAB deployment path thus clearly existed. The most significant element required to pull MATLAB and SIMULINK into parallel processing is to create a \"mapping tool\" and an underlying \"component\" run-time system.","inCitations":["a5bae2719bdccfa621a7d2cb2d289c4a9738da22"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.dtic.mil/get-tr-doc/pdf?AD=ADA372422&Location=U2&doc=GetTRDoc.pdf","http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a372422.pdf"],"title":"Bridging the Development Gap.","doi":"10.21236/ada372422","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.21236/ada372422","venue":""}

An increase of the reverse transformation temperature (martensite stabilization) implies a retardation, or complete avoidance, of the shape recovery, thus failure of the function. Therefore, understanding the mechanism of martensite stabilization in NiTi alloy is extremely important and still needs in-depth studies for its successful use. In the present paper the influence of annealing on martensite stabilization due to deformation via cooling under constant tensile stresses in cold-worked NiTi thin wires has been investigated. The annealed samples exhibit different degrees of martensite stabilization. The stabilization effect was much smaller in 550 °C and 650 °C annealed samples than that in 350 °C and 450 °C annealed ones. It increases with increasing annealing temperature up to 450 °C and decreases when annealed above 450 °C. The result implies that other mechanisms are involved apart from plastic deformation under such deformation mode.","inCitations":["a044944f17ebed7e597292286b736fdf5d918fc6","00328e2062a8f131075deb52d1dc7d07e350e6f5"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Effect of annealing on martensite stabilization due to deformation via cooling under stress in cold-worked NiTi thin wire","doi":"10.1016/j.msea.2012.08.090","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.msea.2012.08.090","venue":""}

Antibodies against peak I were found in 14 sera and against peak II in all 20 sera.

We assume the Brans-Dicke scalar field as a logarithmic form ϕ = ϕ0ln(α + βa), where a is the scale factor, α and β are arbitrary constants, to interpret the physical phenomena of the Universe. The equation of state parameter wh and deceleration parameter q are obtained to discuss the dynamics of the evolution of the Universe. We present a unified model of holographic dark energy which explains the early time acceleration (inflation), medieval time deceleration and late time acceleration. It is also observed that wh may cross the phantom divide line in the late time evolution. We also discuss the cosmic coincidence problem. We obtain a time-varying density ratio of holographic dark energy to dark matter which is a constant of order one (r∼O(1)$r\\sim \\mathcal {O}(1)$) during early and late time evolution, and may evolve sufficiently slow at present time. Thus, the model successfully resolves the cosmic coincidence problem.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.01477v1.pdf"],"title":"Holographic Dark Energy in Brans-Dicke Theory with Logarithmic Form of Scalar Field","doi":"10.1007/s10773-017-3496-2","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10773-017-3496-2","venue":""}

Materiels et Methodes Nous relatons 7 cas d’hemangiomes orbito-palpebraux diagnostiques chez des nouveaux-nes et nourrissons âges de 8 jours a 2 ans. Nous exposons le tableau clinique, la recherche de pathologie syndromique (notamment le phace syndrom), le bilan d’extension locoregional et les complications ophtalmologiques. Le bilan paraclinique effectue a consiste en une echographie en premiere intention completee par une IRM en cas de lesion etendue ou de suspicion d’atteinte orbitaire. Resultats La gravite de l’hemangiome depend de son eventuelle extension intra orbitaire, de son mode evolutif et surtout de sa reponse au traitement par corticoides. Plusieurs cas ont une extension limitee a la paupiere et sont d’evolution favorable. Un cas est d’emblee severe, avec une extension intra-orbitaire, faciale et cervicale. Le traitement corticoide par voie generale a forte dose s’avere inefficace. Nous presentons les alternatives therapeutiques, leurs potentiels effets indesirables. Un cas est limite a la paupiere, mais repond cependant partiellement au traitement par corticoides, entrainant une amblyopie de privation. Discussion Nous discutons des modes de presentation de la maladie, des complications ophtalmologiques eventuelles : amblyopie par privation, anisometropie, compression intra-orbitaire. Nous presentons egalement les differentes alternatives therapeutiques en cas d’echec du traitement par corticoides par voie generale : corticoides en application locale, interferon α-2b par voie generale, injection intralesionnelle de cortisone, exerese chirurgicale. Conclusion Bien que d’evolution spontanement favorable, l’hemangiome orbitopalpebral demeure une cause d’amblyopie parfois profonde necessitant un traitement prolonge. Les therapeutiques actuellement disponibles en alternative aux corticoides par voie generale ne sont pas sans effets indesirables potentiels.

In the first study, 4 patients with allergic rhinitis underwent segmental bronchoprovocation (SBP) with low, medium, and high doses of ragweed extract instilled into different bronchial subsegments; bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluids were collected from each segment 12 min and 48 h after challenge. Eosinophil granule proteins and eosinophil survival activity were significantly elevated in the 48-h (late-phase) BAL fluids from these segments. Correlations were observed between the concentrations of eosinophil granule proteins and eosinophil survival activity (rs = 0.717 to 0.880, p < 0.001) in BAL fluids. Eosinophil survival activity was completely neutralized by anti-IL-5 monoclonal antibody in five of the seven 48-h samples tested representing three of the 4 patients. In the two remaining samples, eosinophil survival activity was only partially neutralized by either anti-IL-5 antibody or anti-granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) but was completely neutralized by anti-IL-5 and anti-GM-CSF in combination. Subsequently, in the second study, 10 patients with allergic rhinitis were challenged by SBP with ragweed extract. Eosinophil survival activity was significantly elevated in the 48-h BAL fluids; this activity was partially neutralized by anti-IL-5 antibody about (48%) and completely neutralized by the combination of anti-IL-5 and anti-GM-CSF antibodies. These findings suggest that the eosinophil survival activity in the late inflammatory lesions following SBP with allergen is mainly associated with IL-5, with small contributions from GM-CSF.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","inCitations":["98530cab800dc60a002529ef4e0dc3eefd3ffbc5","ac07b2458f1dbb8da8241d35ed68caf68af6d1a1","6631ac7ed79322b7b540dcc7f73323274d1e7283","08efc122ad6cb4314a8b2109faafddbfd83f4ec5","50ae243df123d9a9eeb9c80e338a643e81670820","539052d2cfd1c7d136d2a424adf95c281af99022","491b58d13e60f10cf045d8b61fe9a6656ce69fec","7a0faf20423a66b3baa2652232bcbc0094a1083a","ec7840c23b31461341da3c324c2dd76a7578ec08","acb8eca327b76738447291a8885a88254bac1b87","a789fc8a16de82d2b13213e19a0c16122fca8d8c","a51dfc6febe8ba8fb18aa9f2bbcbcd42899bdaf7","12de9a73f052ec3a9349be73d2db8d20828a03ef","37b56f972aec2d272107355006f74b139e35b612","937a19b2344d9c667410d2d7fafd061ff17a46ad","004dd8d0ec6835a5580e78e2772e0e0508ae7277","6e82892a9d4acba7c9e0a81615399a062a85a9fa","5e3e59187805ab9e7d5a87c252f3b036e43dc847","2142259375d7cac46ae20a5df72ef35abb6f9e00","b19fba5386bc6d1002806a0c8779354254c72eee","c93f2618abd36af0da688fb1e049d332ff84306a"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"IL-5 is the predominant eosinophil-active cytokine in the antigen-induced pulmonary late-phase reaction.","doi":"10.1164/ajrccm/147.4.901","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1164/ajrccm%2F147.4.901","venue":"The American review of respiratory disease"}

Se sintetizo una zeolita tipo faujasita a partir de Al puro y silica gel por el metodo sol-gel; se caracterizo por difraccion de rayos X (DRX) y espectroscopia de infrarrojo (FTIR). Se determino la capacidad de remocion de materia organica, sulfatos, fosfatos, nitrogeno amoniacal, dureza y alcalinidad presentes en aguas residuales domesticas (ARD) tipicas de la ciudad de Florencia Caqueta y en aguas sinteticas. El trabajo experimental mostro buenos resultados a escala de laboratorio, con posible aplicacion a escala real. Se identifico el material sintetizado como zeolita tipo faujasita Na-X. Debido al caracter basico de la zeolita sintetizada, solamente se observa remocion de cationes representados en dureza (Ca+2 y Mg+2), nitrogeno amoniacal y materia organica (Demanda Quimica de Oxigeno, DQO). La remocion es debida a intercambio cationico y a procesos de adsorcion de material coloidal.  La remocion de material contaminante en orden descendente es dureza (Ca+2 y Mg+2)   Material coloidal (materia organica).","inCitations":["25447391fd97aa7d800faf786d7d2c37fb45d3c5","2024ba1203504d769cad6cf3406760514681df8c"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Estudio Preliminar de la Capacidad de Remoción de Iones Inorgánicos de Una Zeolita Sintética Tipo Faujasita","doi":"10.18359/rfcb.1300","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.18359/rfcb.1300","venue":""}

Gp A (n=35) had prior PCI before CABG and Gp B (n=205) underwent primary CABG.\n\n\nRESULTS\nStatistically significant results were obtained for the following preoperative criteria: previous myocardial infarction: 48.6% vs 36.6% (P=0.003), distribution of CAD (P=0.0001), unstable angina: 45.7% vs 39% (P=0.04). For intraoperative data, the total number of established bypasses was 2.6 (GpA) vs 2.07 (Gp B) (P=0.017), with the number of arterial bypass grafts being: 20% vs 13% (P=ns). Regarding the postoperative course, no significant difference in troponine I rate, 24-hour bleeding: 962 ml (Gp A) vs 798 ml (Gp B) (P=0.004), transfusion (PRBC unit): 3.63 (Gp A) vs 2.5 (Gp B) (P=0.006). Previous PCI emerged as an independent predictor of postoperative in-hospital mortality (OR 2.24, 95% CI [1.52-2.75], P<0.01).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nPatients with prior PCI presented for CABG with more severe CAD. Thirty-day mortality and morbidity were significantly higher in patients with prior PCI.","inCitations":["88d163a814bdaa0a663741198b312e6104188575"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"[Correlation between previous coronary artery stenting and early mortality in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery].","doi":"10.1016/j.ancard.2013.02.006","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ancard.2013.02.006","venue":"Annales de cardiologie et d'angeiologie"}

There is also growing evidence for the involvement of the glutamatergic system in mammal’s locomotion, and thus, much experimental data support NMDA receptor plays an important role in motor activity. Most of the behavioural studies are related to the effects of NMDA receptor antagonists which produce an increase of motor activity in rodents after their systemic or intraestriatal administration7,9,18,29,33. Antagonistic dopamine/glutamate interactions14 at presynaptic and postsynaptic levels have been suggested to be important mechanisms for this induced motor activation since it can be inhibited by drugs which produce dopamine depletion or blockade of dopamine receptors7,9,33.

Review scope Included studies evaluated 1 intervention for MCI. Outcomes included cognition and incident dementia. Review methods MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Web of Science, AMED, and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews to Jan 2013; and reference lists were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Experts were contacted. 42 RCTs {n =7803}* met the selection criteria; 17 were rated as high quality (4 of 5 criteria). 9 RCTs evaluated cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEIs); 5 exercise therapy; 4 group psychological interventions; 3 computer-assisted cognitive training; and 2 each of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, ginkgo biloba, B vitamins, vitamin E, and omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids. Other interventions were evaluated in single trials and are not reported here. 25 RCTs defined MCI using Petersen criteria; other RCTs used other MCI definitions, Mini-Mental State Examination criteria and subjective or objective memory impairments, or other measures. Main results Results for study-reported primary outcomes are shown in the Table. Conclusions In mild cognitive impairment, cholinesterase inhibitors do not prevent dementia; evidence is insufficient for improved cognition. Evidence is insufficient for other interventions. Interventions for mild cognitive impairment Interventions Selected findings for study-reported primary outcomes Cholinesterase inhibitors No benefit with donepezil at 3 y (1 RCT, n =516), galantamine at 2 y (2 RCTs, n =2048), or rivastigmine at 2 y (1 RCT, n =1018) vs placebo for incident AD/dementia Donepezil improved cognitive function at 48 wk (1 RCT, n =757, ADAS-Cog SMD 0.10, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.20) but not delayed recall at 24 wk (1 RCT, n =270) vs placebo No benefit with rivastigmine vs placebo on a cognitive test battery at 2 y (1 RCT, n =1018) NSAIDs Rofecoxib increased risk for incident AD at <4 y vs placebo (1 RCT, n =257, hazard ratio 1.46, CI 1.09 to 1.94) No benefit with triflusal vs placebo for cognitive function at 13 mo (1 RCT, n =257) Ginkgo biloba No benefit vs placebo for preventing incident AD/dementia at 6 y (1 RCT, n =482) Improved memory (SMC 0.42, CI 0.05 to 0.80) and nonsense picture recognition (SMC 0.46, CI 0.09 to 0.84) at 6 mo vs usual care (1 RCT, n =120) Vitamin E No benefit vs placebo for preventing incident AD at 3 y (1 RCT, n =512) B vitamins No benefit vs placebo for immediate memory at 6 mo (1 RCT, n =152) Omega-3 PUFAs Improved cognition (ADAS-Cog) at 6 mo vs placebo in adjusted analysis (1 RCT, n =23) Exercise interventions No benefit with moderate-intensity group walking program vs a low-intensity active control for word recall at 1 y (1 RCT, n =152) Group psychological interventions 6-mo mixed intervention improved cognition vs a placebo intervention (ADAS-Cog SMD 1.00, CI 0.60 to 1.90, 1 RCT, n =22) 6-wk targeted intervention improved processing speed (P <0.001) and reasoning (P <0.05) but not memory at 2 y vs no treatment (1 RCT, n =193) Computer-assisted cognitive training No benefit with a mixed training strategy vs a no-training group on a cognitive test battery at 6 wk (1 RCT, n =47) AD = Alzheimer disease; ADAS-Cog = Alzheimer's Disease Assessment ScaleCognitive subscale; NSAID = nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug; PUFA = polyunsaturated fatty acid; RCT = randomized controlled trial; SM(C/D) = standardized mean (change/difference). Commentary Of the 42 RCTs evaluated by Cooper and colleagues, 25 met <4 of the 5 criteria for validity. The authors standardized outcomes to compare the magnitude of effect of diverse pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions; however, such standardization may conceal important clinical differences in effects. Most RCTs used outcome measures of questionable clinical relevance. Some, such as the Alzheimer Disease Assessment ScaleCognitive subscale (ADAS-Cog), were developed for patients with Alzheimer disease (AD) and may have ceiling effects or insensitivity to change (1). The failure of many RCTs to differentiate MCI subtypes, which have different prognoses, complicates comparisons. Cooper and colleagues' review supports the conclusion of a recent Cochrane analysis (2) that ChEIs do not reduce the incidence of dementia. Intolerance to ChEIs seems to be greater in MCI than in AD trials, with discontinuation rates of 18% vs 10% (1). Although ChEIs were associated with better scores on the ADAS-Cog than with placebo in 1 RCT in MCI, the magnitude of response was clinically meaningless (1). Some nonpharmacologic interventions for MCI were promising. For example, a 6-month cognitive intervention in a small trial of patients with amnestic MCI (3) had a 10-fold greater relative improvement on the ADAS-Cog than that seen in a 48-week trial of donepezil (1). The cognitive intervention also improved symptoms of depression, which often accompany MCI and are associated with twice the risk for dementia than MCI without depression (2). Whether starting ChEIs during MCI can change the trajectory of symptoms after AD has begun is unknown. Limited evidence from an open-label follow-up of an RCT in patients with early AD suggested that continuous treatment with donepezil led to better cognitive and functional abilities after 3 years than delaying donepezil for 1 year (4).","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Review: Cholinesterase inhibitors do not prevent dementia in patients with mild cognitive impairment","doi":"10.7326/0003-4819-160-8-201404150-02011","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.7326/0003-4819-160-8-201404150-02011","venue":"Annals of Internal Medicine"}

Studies, however, have been hindered by the ability to effectively analyze these single cell RNA-seq datasets, due to the high-dimensional nature and intrinsic noise in the data. While many techniques have been introduced to reduce dimensionality of such data for visualization and subpopulation identification, the utility to identify new cellular subtypes in a reliable and robust manner remains unclear. Here, we compare dimensionality reduction visualization methods including principle component analysis and t-stochastic neighbor embedding along with various distance metric modifications to visualize single-cell RNA-seq datasets, and assess their performance in identifying known cellular subtypes. Our results suggest that selecting variable genes prior to analysis on single-cell RNA-seq data is vital to yield reliable classification, and that when variable genes are used, the choice of distance metric modification does not particularly influence the quality of classification. Still, in order to take advantage of all the gene expression information, alternative methods must be used for a reliable classification.","inCitations":["e0f720fa7debf9ba03e45bdb114f20bf9ccda0d4","8e4e2ca2801cd6ea8a8ae6053ac6eef72dd8f412","ef2df8f08a2868f86eb384e516479ed7762a0bf6","f6bb69cd5544bd1d3a406508a7cac9e82600dd55"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Comparison of Principal Component Analysis and t-Stochastic Neighbor Embedding with Distance Metric Modifications for Single-cell RNA-sequencing Data Analysis","doi":"10.1101/102780","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1101/102780","venue":""}

They can be notoriously difficult to treat because of the operator’s inability to reproduce a pace map and/or obtain an excellent activation map, not to mention the limitations in the delivery of ablative energy despite optimal mapping. It is in these situations that heuristic approaches to ablation have been used by ablating on both sides of the septum. Dr Bogun and his colleagues at the University of Michigan have provided a potential framework to better tackle this problem by evaluating pacing and interventional diagnostic approaches to intramural VAs. In this issue of HeartRhythm, they highlight several insightful approaches to mapping of these arrhythmias. They evaluated the following: (1) the ability to use dual-site pacing to identify the origin of premature ventricular complexes (PVCs) and (2) the effect of cold saline irrigation on intramural PVCs to help better identify intramural sites of ablation. The first study tackles the challenge of identifying an intramural source of VA as opposed to a nonintramural source. Eighteen patients with confirmed intramural VAs and a similar number of control patients with nonintramural sources of PVCs formed the basis of this study. In a post hoc analysis, single-site pace maps were compared with the targeted VA by determining the Pearson correlation coefficient and the root mean square of the difference in QRS complexes between the pace map and the targeted VA. The QRS complexes of the individual pacemapping leads obtained at the 2 earliest breakthrough sites in “adjacent” anatomical areas were then averaged to yield a combined mean signal in MATLAB (Natick, MA). The QRS morphologies of the averaged pace maps were then compared","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Another brick in the wall: Conquering intramural ventricular arrhythmias.","doi":"10.1016/j.hrthm.2015.09.012","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.hrthm.2015.09.012","venue":"Heart rhythm"}

The macular pigment optical density (MPOD) was obtained by autofluorescence spectrometry using two wavelengths (488 nm, 514 nm). The density of the central macular pigment within 0.5 degree around the foveal center (MPODc) was measured from a MPOD map.ResultsEight eyes of seven patients were classified as type 1, 16 eyes of eight patients as type 2, and two eyes of one patient as type 3. The macular pigment signal was seen in the area of fluorescein leakage in type 1 and the occlusive area in type 3; the macular pigment signal decreased in the area of fluorescein leakage in type 2. The mean MPODc (± standard deviation) was 0.40 ± 0.16 density unit (DU) (range, 0.17-0.57) in type 1; −0.08 ± 0.15 DU (range, −0.29–0.25) in type 2; and 0.32 ± 0.08 DU (range, 0.26–0.37) in type 3. Significant differences were seen between types 1 and 2 (P < 0.001) and types 2 and 3 (P = 0.007). There was no significant difference between types 1 and 3 (P = 0.765). In 30 age-matched normal eyes, the MPODc was 0.58 ± 0.11 DU (range, 0.38–0.79). There were significant differences between normal eyes and each MacTel subtype (type 1, P = 0.007; type 2, P < 0.001; type 3, P = 0.043).ConclusionsThe macular pigment values and distributions, including leakage or occlusion, differed in each MacTel type compared with fluorescein angiography findings. The capillary occlusion in type 3 is not associated with reduced MPOD.","inCitations":["6c29f6bb8ef8c65a1a6ba8911e67859bdd282f4b"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Comparison of macular pigment in three types of macular telangiectasia","doi":"10.1007/s00417-012-2088-3","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00417-012-2088-3","venue":"Graefe's Archive for Clinical and Experimental Ophthalmology"}

The depth of invasion was the greater the less the degree of differentiation. The uncorrected recurrence rate of carcinoma was 14.9%, 28% of the recurrences showed an increase in malignancy grade and (or) depth of invasion. The recurrence rate fell within the first three years from 76.8% to 8.2%. In addition, there was a high degree of coincidence between carcinoma grade III and severe urothelial dysplasia. The diagnosis of severe dysplasia is an indication for frequent cystoscopic and bioptic checks. Since the biological significance of urinary bladder carcinoma depends not only on the degree of malignancy but also on the depth of invasion and the readiness of carcinoma towards invasion, it is necessary for successful prospective studies, designed to evaluate the course of urinary bladder carcinoma and their therapeutic response, to incorporate exact staging and grading.","inCitations":["0345a38e550dcca0e0593d99444877b0bb86904b","9a56f421ff89f1a8348bef213078bc233b578286"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"[Grading and staging of urinary bladder carcinomas (author's transl)].","doi":"10.1055/s-2008-1070114","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1055/s-2008-1070114","venue":"Deutsche medizinische Wochenschrift"}

In sociological applications, the third variable often pertains to countries, to subgroups of a population, or to time periods. We propose a regression-type approach that specifies that the log-odds-ratios that describe the two-way association of interest are a linear function of latent scores for the third variable. Additive and multiplicative models currently in use by researchers are special cases of the regression-type model. To illustrate the utility of the regression-type approach, we apply this approach to analyze (1) data on occupational mobility in the United States, Britain, and Japan (comparing mobility in these countries) and (2) data on the association between religion and voting behavior in U.S. presidential elections from 1968 to 1992 (comparing this association in the different elections).

They share a feature of working with the systematisation and reification of relics and objects. For too long there has been an almost indecent preoccupation with measuring and quantifying the existence of disabled people with the grand and commendable objective to know ‘us’ more. Despite these obsessions with disability, the sociocultural relations of impairment and disabled people have remained an afterthought in civic consciousness and at best peripheral in sociologies of the body. The aberrant, the anomalous, the monster or the disabled have formed ‘the background noise, as it were, the endless murmur of nature’, where disability is nonetheless always present in its absence (Foucault, 1970: 155). An act of speaking otherwise, this chapter shifts to a focus on abled(ness) to think about the production of ableism. We all live and breathe ableist logic, our bodies and minds daily become aesthetic sculptures for the projection of how we wish to be known in our attempt to exercise competency, sexiness, wholeness and an atomistic existence. It is harder to find the language and space to examine the implications of a failure to meet the standard or any ambivalence we might have about the grounds of the perfectibility project. This chapter first will outline an approach to expressing ableism (its theoretical features and character) and secondly it will provide an example of how ableism works globally in the knowledge production of disability. Finally I will discuss the possibility of disabled people turning their backs on emulating abledness as a strategy for disengagement both ontological and theoretical.","inCitations":["c5abcffda8d53cd7e4bd8e0a7eb0d01f7a58f5d8","ce756a50ba54a8bc55f67ece278f5bd6fca31705","547afa394ca8d806b3e62f2de665ac3b37478c2b","bdd28358274a3b2c319095ea76a7ae34549e6261","a5ff5563568f10aac61082dfa6e5481c4bec29d5","f38e80b54c6cb2e5371f873fdd1d6dfb600fe7fa","304c64965b14f1abdbbc0b16d0e17e517e758fe8","20fb5b7f54528282bbb797f5752487cc86b1b444","e5e2e7a03929b7e90899c421c38700cbb74b1eb6","ea101ef9db388093fd0cb719f8a4425b552cc46f","40b2b1e191f68f975d016bb2471e7c99e97bd270","99e7757b82959e0778a143acfe7d2948fb1daf11","35feaac2ddb09afb62b43834553ae692573dc77d","220d876c31107cf5eacc8a51e7b3ac512a9bd5c8"],"pdfUrls":["https://page-one.springer.com/pdf/preview/10.1057/9781137023001_13"],"title":"Stalking Ableism: Using Disability to Expose ‘Abled’ Narcissism","doi":"10.1057/9781137023001_13","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1057/9781137023001_13","venue":""}

The proposed controller is composed of two separate controllers. The sliding-mode controller is used for attitude control of the WMR, and the fuzzy controller-based hyperbolic function is designed to adjust the reach time of the sliding-mode control. Simulation results on a linear and a circular trajectory show that the proposed controller improves the control performance.

Of the 54 organic-walled taxa recognized, 12 are newly described: Yukonosphaeridion interior Awramik, n. gen., n. sp., Microagglomeratus borealis Awramik n. gen., n. sp., Phacelogeminus lineatus Awramik n. gen., n. sp., Palaeoanacystis magna Awramik, n. sp., Cephalophytarion majesticum Allison n. sp., Heliconema bulbosa Allison n. sp., Trachyhystrichosphaera magna Allison n. sp., Fusilabellum brevistriatum Awramik n. gen., n. sp., Sphaeranasillos irregularis Allison n. gen., n. sp., Hyalocyrillium clardyi Allison n. gen., n. sp., Eophycomyces herkoides Allison n. gen., n. sp. and Archeomyces dimakeloides Allison n. gen., n. sp.","inCitations":["399924cf140e4b1cb8290a0dbc86bc2ab6b84c48","ec4a829f79fa61d80f399c2c0511881adc1d3738","65174dd573d806b2f5a1d39fd563f7106d4eb497","365e96015eb6e04438b2ff73ea074c2874b81e06","7352f4f7c8190aa1f64b985af7708f7e52055cdf","ecbe8bb2e0a888e8ce0cda5ccc2bb0c0d1fd389f","877166bbc9b024e3493498fc06f2719715d88709","6cc9400fd2c64fd3bfe0565902bd44e6f6a4e4a4","4b0781db552810e42229620b194cc1450b5a57a9","66bbcf0f62c5afea586d5298331e4163a7d22104","00fae1a569b2b9b6c2e7f504bf3f08f2e1c0a4fa","6accabcacdc971c0882c054f672d51a2131e4621","5d8787ef4c82f9063499e1c5d670104391b3ac8c","e02db120d9e408454899d158a0550e0cff684ffe","58a4096c1564a9aa0f51539cca96495268807071","2a304cbbc70525ac35644883c0ea5f22491f5d79","47f8590f2f08ac46c22d5c98d6a0ed55f1e1eff1","da32becec99f3671d431ce077e6bbcc27bea9069","b6cf5c4d427e60f47e62bf8e94beaca14e1b3627","24155d169a6ae6fd26f4a79ce4c461f65986397c","2861eb15ead16fdc462e19c1f38f88770bda3cd0","fd01feaaea7f31f20e06705f9b28ec2ac4d1710d","0fe6ac25fdcca35bc7f6a9f74579df84a5d72942","5822ac9aeb1446597f0a91384b90d8ed6ef14072","d4ba6ee210f28b8e3427a7e1cfa8c423dc302b0d","4fc80b2fca929bd43df14313d25581d6221b208b","f596dd53af4f346a7e61bdcf90a565cb72575ff1","d33f2b07a4cb18e54f26961d44d2ed7041c18428","eaef9275c6d3e4fdfa159c5f9a45bbccf12a5d3b"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.geol.ucsb.edu/faculty/awramik/pubs/ALLI8953.pdf"],"title":"Organic-walled microfossils from earliest Cambrian or latest proterozoic Tindir Group rocks, Northwest Canada","doi":"10.1016/0301-9268(89)90060-0","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/0301-9268%2889%2990060-0","venue":""}

The case when polarization states of initial electron beam and laser photons are helicity is considered. It is shown that taking into account nonlinear effects in the Compton backscattering leads to decreasing the threshold of production of $e^+ e^-$-pairs and increasing their number. The consideration is based on the direct calculation of matrix elements in the formalism of diagonal spin basis.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://arxiv.org/pdf/hep-ph/9805362v1.pdf","http://arxiv.org/pdf/hep-ph/9805362v1.pdf"],"title":"On production $e^+ e^-$-pairs by a high energy photon in collision with photons of a laser wave","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}
