In this paper, we compare the environmental density dependence of the atomic gas mass fractions of nearby galaxies with the density dependence of their central and global specific star formation rates. We stack H I line spectra extracted from the Arecibo Legacy Fast ALFA survey centred on galaxies with ultraviolet imaging from GALEX and optical imaging/spectroscopy from Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We use these stacked spectra to evaluate the mean atomic gas mass fraction of galaxies in bins of stellar mass and local density. For galaxies with stellar masses less than 10(10.5) M-circle dot, the decline in mean atomic gas mass fraction with density is stronger than the decline in mean global and central specific star formation rate. The same conclusion does not hold for more massive galaxies. We interpret our results as evidence for ram-pressure stripping of atomic gas from the outer discs of low-mass satellite galaxies. We compare our results with the semi-analytic recipes of Guo et al. implemented on the Millennium II Simulation. These models assume that only the diffuse gas surrounding satellite galaxies is stripped, a process that is often termed 'strangulation'. We show that these models predict relative trends in atomic gas and star formation that are in disagreement with observations. We use mock catalogues generated from the simulation to predict the halo masses of the H I-deficient galaxies in our sample. We conclude that ram-pressure stripping is likely to become effective in dark matter haloes with masses greater than 10(13) M-circle dot.","inCitations":["a4cddb0c420ca820d36454c7ced2beb98bdc06f6","acc6962e4574de7212ce91147dbc92c870a5e015"],"pdfUrls":["https://arxiv.org/pdf/1209.2003v1.pdf","https://watermark.silverchair.com/427-4-2841.pdf?token=AQECAHi208BE49Ooan9kkhW_Ercy7Dm3ZL_9Cf3qfKAc485ysgAAAlEwggJNBgkqhkiG9w0BBwagggI-MIICOgIBADCCAjMGCSqGSIb3DQEHATAeBglghkgBZQMEAS4wEQQMesJ_PYw2WX7Y7GzZAgEQgIICBCs-SxR1mk6KxE0N_tDKyWOjQheL41kBycTO6sLS90ZMMT2gcGkeduRaE7lfF8W37StEVy3zEccqXq-bS6uES8BzIQoqTR-kiZBECX3eAtGhuNHoy8Rhpli1OPRWBxdNqadOnwu4XxYJPGgMDTf8UbodAKMGhf2JxsX_7FDr6NdJg_tgj1wIVnxs3ngiysWNxtR06_R_5KydozoKnwdlLqUjmpv0LIWM6V1yqeI1WyPUTMZg8P6IiLOuZFi5do4fCFf3mfcp6QWowsJ_Fq8ej8GnRY1vVODLAlXc2nwV_RpcYnV0w4e05-5wbOSVySS6BhetqBaAFblYhMAOv373DP_NF0UDolhVaHMg0J8W2VRPJ6gFi_yTKRwuWCUweq2LHpdocSwLfbZnEi0v9uRQ_a9TV3rs7LwI2m9PEDa3Q_nrNHxagGJ8PBuBlXo5xWiQUIEQJMCmdd5ZnSNV-NIzDf_YHrfOjXWxagwHLOJ_fCBCo830TFeKU-u1OfuQlaLmB8FWxzt6w5cgp5G7pzP3E_SiQ4zNNKbRh-vEp3FA-MlVWzyRlddqASuPK6e6DR1Xs5bU6u5hK9UDHWgAOtHr7JzSls9AwT3f6EgVFTo3Ju-VblQOukAscA2NXYCCimhIBzrXv7sMG4TbXHGN2jm11Z9aovbY3RGRBalj7y0sPduEWfS13Q"],"title":"ALFALFA H i data stacking – III.

However, IEC 62278 does not describe the methodology of substantial contents like how reliability target is set although it can be used as an overall guideline when RAMS requirements are included in the purchase specification. That is because RAMS requirements should be set with the specific railway condition. It is required to fully understand the meaning of railway RAMS parameters and apply those correspond to the specific railway system and environment condition especially when a quantitative RAMS requirement is set. In this study, the meaning and characteristics of RAMS parameters applicable to the development of quantitative RAMS requirement of rolling stock is described.

Soymilk and tofu were made using a bench scale (139 g bean, manual method) and a production scale (6500 g bean, automated machine method). Tofu yield, moisture content, hardness and elasticity varied with soybean varieties. The bench scale resulted in greater varietal effects on tofu yield, moisture content, hardness and elasticity than the production scale. The hardness of production-scale tofu was greater. The bench scale gave soymilk with higher yield and solid recovery. The two scale methods correlated significantly (p≤0.05) in tofu yield, color, texture, and chemical composition (moisture, protein, lipid, ash, calcium and magnesium). The bench scale may be used for screening tofu soybean cultivars in early breeding stages when available bean quantities are small whereas the production scale is more appropriate for evaluating soybeans for commercial tofu production.","inCitations":["1cb4dd82c0713abb26d3dea6350e08ab70aa57ab","0059082cdaa7a0a707281d28c43839baf7161df8","0f7f3b1772b26a5c8266a2c9426fe99964604cab","ef4b44f3b44e00d33a51fcad0a62185cc11ac441","659bf26c911a65c4c65417ce4f7c20d91333c749","20084c4c1770e97c83a7c6c53037b4dfefeacfff","f496475113d95525f44b9ea52c89febf35c97c3d","52a53c4680766854a7d824b3d240c27bccf333e9","9a39449ced723fc365819329d4c2a8f774f1acdb","58c6d2e126a5322cd430caaa507468744fff057c","94e25d4ed958a72253b08ca54a957a4ad262c5a9","d11e6e80d472f7b7318d738f34a245e4c0247877","842b7df5deb0785eeecc73c2110897acbf05af47","827dadec08505ec0d8131e601c7ab1ea94e5f7ce","9984a308d139c29c34cf19e22a79cd4d33307fdf","7b7d321185f7d3c724dce749aa5fad9b8bd99576","8ca5b20bd11ba02a3863a24a36ceb731f2006f8e","f167210689a8e00e9eeb2037b233e1123547ade3","59087790c7b405291aa7e452e7dcec744d33d803","0b41ca5efcfdb46fd6d20ee161b199787d79ba42","64333c2d23924598b61cebcb3d975e878ce0db37","7712e9ae33917bde54303c881ac038c74f368219","e965accadf16b95d4cd64bc930e5ab2751e187f9","b56bce8381d2c09637d1960ffa69188708af0ff8","f29696de7055f102f25f836ad50537cb175d8d76","1300d6f3b12f5e23b2c2c4efa6e1384817f4155c","a1bf36c63d61a1854d0d14b6eecb72181c691bde"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Comparison of bench and production scale methods for making soymilk and tofu from 13 soybean varieties","doi":"10.1016/S0963-9969(98)00032-5","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/S0963-9969%2898%2900032-5","venue":""}

In a simple and classical understanding, it has an informative and associative role. Although it is not easy for students to understand the multiple implications of the history of medicine, its importance becomes more evident during their academic formation. The students must be persuaded particularly about the ethical and cultural values that history of medicine has in their training. Furthermore, history of medicine participates in creating the necessary perspective for shaping the future of medicine in the next decades. This is, perhaps, the most interesting role that the history of medicine should play from the modern point of view of students and young physicians.

We compare the use of Path and Manner verbs in two groups of native speakers of Spanish studying English at elementary and advanced levels. The way movement was conflated by the advanced group was reasonably close to the English way, whereas the elementary group was still far from the English lexicalization of movement.

To date, there are 102 recognized serotypes that have been isolated and shown to be antigenically distinct (Hamparian et al., 1987). HRVs are non-enveloped viruses that contain four non-glycosylated structural proteins, designated VP1, VP2, VP3, and VP4, which form a protein capsid with icosahedral symmetry. Within the viral capsid lies a single-stranded genome RNA which serves as a monocistronic mRNA for the synthesis of the 4 structural and 7 nonstructural proteins of the virus. Upon entry into a cell, the RNA genome is translated into a large polyprotein which is subsequently cleaved by two viral proteases encoded within the polyprotein (Palmenberg, 1987). The genome RNA of picornaviruses contains all the information needed to initiate a viral infection since transfection of cells with the genome RNA alone will result in the production of infectious progeny virus (Mizutani et al., 1985).","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Molecular Interactions between Human Rhinoviruses and the Adhesion Receptor ICAM-1","doi":"10.1007/978-1-4612-2924-7_3","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4612-2924-7_3","venue":""}

Experiencing Turbulence brings together a selection of publications on Australian representation of Asia, published in various journals and books in the last ten years that follow the publication of Anxious Nation: Australia and the Rise of Asia, 1850 to 1939. Collectively they address key themes in the Australian response to Asia: survivalist anxieties, climate and race, population and immigration, empty Australia, gender and bush mythologies, and regional Identities. These essays reveal the central, often constitutive role that Asia has played in the formation of ideas of nation and identity in Australia from the late nineteenth century to the present. The collection underlines the often unpredictable character of engagement and the fluid nature of fear and fascination, proximity and distance in the Australia-Asia relationship. With the recent publication of a government White Paper on Australia in the Asian Century there is a new determination to persuade Australians that \"rising Asia,\" turbulent though it may be, is an opportunity for Australia more than it is a threat.","inCitations":["4437bc0bd18fa7eddfd4e0bf500ec1aabd2c8c55","e38b9f0ec44c90e6d7385eb4a9e4c3b8d0605e74"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Experiencing turbulence Asia in the Australian imaginary","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Aim: To measure serum concentrations of sFlt-1 and free PlGF in women with severe and mild preeclampsia. Methods: This study involved 25 pregnant women from 28 to 37 gestational weeks (8 normal pregnant women and 17 preeclamptic patients). Ten women with severe preeclampsia (proteinuria > 2g) and 7 women with mild preeclampsia (proteinuria < 2g and no other laboratory alterations) comprised the preeclamptic group. The serum concentrations of sFlt-1 and PlGF were measured by electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (Roche Diagnostics, IN). Data were analyzed using an Elecsys 2010/Hitachi. The statistical analysis was performed using Prism software (version 4.02, GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA). Differences between groups were evaluated using Mann-Whitney U test and were considered statistically significant at P<0.05. Results: The mean concentration of sFlt-1 in severe preeclamptic women (12.324 pg/mL) and mild preeclamptic women (9.505 pg/mL) were significantly higher than in normal pregnant women (2.201 pg/mL) (P<0.0001 and P=0.003, respectively). There was no difference between severe and mild preeclamptic groups (P=0.53). The mean concentration of free PlGF in severe preeclamptic women (152.2 pg/mL) was significant lower than in normal pregnant women (447 pg/mL) (P=0.02). No difference was found between mild preeclamptic women and normal pregnant women in terms of PlGF (P=0.07). The sFlt-1/PlGF ratio was also significantly higher in severe (175.8) and mild preeclamptic women (134.1) than in normal pregnant women (9.7) (P=0.0005 and P=0.003, respectively). There was no difference between severe and mild preeclamptic groups (P=0.53).

The commentators suggest several ways to refine the concepts of vigilance, fear, and risk. I discuss these refinements, which in the end will prove useful to assess further the relationship between vigilance and fear.

A","paperAbstract":"The vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) photoionization and dissociative photoionization of methyl fluoride (CH3F) in the 12.2-19.8 eV energy range were investigated by using synchrotron radiation coupled to a double imaging photoelectron photoion coincidence (i2PEPICO) spectrometer. The production of several fragment ions including CH2F+, CHF+, CH3+, and CH2+ as a function of state and internal energy of CH3F+ ions was identified and analyzed, with their individual appearance energies measured through threshold photoelectron spectroscopy. Dynamical information was inferred from electron and ion kinetic energy correlation diagrams measured at chosen fixed photon energies. The detailed mechanisms governing the dissociation of state-selected CH3F+ ions prepared in the X2E, A2A1, and B2E low-lying electronic states as well as outside the Franck-Condon region have been inferred based on the present experimental results and existing theoretical calculations. Both the CH2F+ and CH3+ primary fragment ions have three different channels of production from different electronic states of CH3F+. The spin-orbit splitting states of the F fragment, 2P3/2 and 2P1/2, in the CH3+ + F dissociation channels were assigned and adiabatically correlate to the X2E ground state and the A2A1 electronic state, respectively, with the aid of previous theoretical results. The CH3F+ ions in the high energy part of the X2E ground state are unstable and statistically dissociate to the CH2F+(11A1) and H(2S) fragments along the potential energy curve of the X2E state. The A2A1 electronic state is a repulsive state and exclusively dissociates to the CH3+(11A1') and F(2P1/2) fragments. In addition, the CH2F+, CHF+, CH3+, and CH2+ fragment ions are also produced in the B2E state and in the Franck-Condon gap by indirect processes, such as internal conversion or dissociative autoionization.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Double Imaging Photoelectron Photoion Coincidence Sheds New Light on the Dissociation of State-Selected CH3F+ Ions.","doi":"10.1021/acs.jpca.7b06038","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpca.7b06038","venue":"The journal of physical chemistry.

While our knowledge of human amniotic fluid is extensive, current data for equine amniotic fluid is limited. We therefore undertook a detailed lipidomics analysis of equine amniotic fluid. Using a non-targeted high-resolution mass spectrometric lipidomics analysis of equine amniotic fluid, we were able to characterize a diverse array of individual lipids. This non-biased analytical approach detected, for the first time, the presence of (O-acyl)-ω-hydroxy-fatty acids (OAHFA) with up to 52 carbon chain lengths in amniotic fluid. The identities of these lipid amphiphiles were validated both by high-resolution mass spectrometry and by tandem mass spectrometry (<2 ppm mass error) which identified the fatty acid and hydroxy-fatty acid components of individual OAHFAs. The only previous identification of OAHFAs has been in sperm and meibomian glands, and their sebaceous secretions, suggesting that these lipids may have unique functional roles in highly specialized compartments. The amphiphilic and surfactant properties of these unique lipids could provide an interface between amniotic lipids and fetal skin and/or lungs. The potential roles of OAHFAs as well as their source in amniotic fluid remain to be explored based upon these novel lipidomics findings but our study of the developmental time course of amniotic OAHFAs suggest that they may act as lubricants in delivery and/or a role in the development of fetal lung function around parturition.","inCitations":["dd0c0d51573b73e15578fecd6911d10f301866e8","8bc0759dae2dafb81830e3a01d9923bd70b35ecf","b3e5e655cfd836b6a6dc1e9ab1356a167eee1cf2","24324dbc10e41fa6d36905cf81ff5962b72a1f27"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Lipidomics of equine amniotic fluid: Identification of amphiphilic (O-acyl)-ω-hydroxy-fatty acids.","doi":"10.1016/j.theriogenology.2017.09.012","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.theriogenology.2017.09.012","venue":"Theriogenology"}

Besides, farm size and membership to farmer groups influenced intensity of adoption positively while farm income and frequency of organic fertilizer application influenced use intensity of organic fertilizer negatively. For smallholder farmers to benefit from adoption of organic fertilizer, interventions aimed at providing better extension services, better access to information media and farmer’s group formations are crucial.

Triton extracts of syncytiotrophoblast membranes were incubated with [gamma-32P]ATP, MgCl2 and MnCl2. Addition of epidermal growth factor (EGF) resulted in increased phosphorylation not only of the EGF receptor and a Mr-35,000 protein as previously described, but also a protein of Mr 95,000 on both tyrosine and serine residues. In addition, a small increase in the phosphorylation of a protein of Mr 105,000 was observed. Spermine had a similar effect on the phosphorylation of the Mr-95,000 protein, without affecting the phosphorylation of the other proteins. In the absence of MnCl2, the effect of spermine on the phosphorylation of Mr-95,000 protein was still evident, whereas that of EGF was greatly diminished. 2. The Mr-95,000 protein bound poorly to wheat-germ-lectin-Sepharose and was not precipitated by antisera specific for insulin and EGF receptors. The protein continued to exhibit serine and tyrosine phosphorylation on addition of [gamma-32P]ATP, MgCl2 and MnCl2 to a glycoprotein-depleted fraction prepared by chromatography on wheat-germ-lectin-Sepharose. The extent of phosphorylation was no longer increased by spermine or EGF, but was inhibited by heparin. 3. It is suggested that the Mr-95,000 protein not only is a possible direct substrate for the EGF-receptor (but not the insulin receptor) tyrosine kinase but is a substrate for other endogenous kinases, including a protein tyrosine kinase which is probably not a glycoprotein, and a protein serine kinase with properties similar to those of casein kinase II.","inCitations":["464e1aac66a079b4369efa628e6f1d38d375ac41","d5fdb9a9a4329f12bffc5b51fdcfab1ea05486fb"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Epidermal growth factor, but not insulin, stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of an endogenous protein of Mr 95,000 in triton extracts of human placental syncytiotrophoblast membranes.","doi":"10.1042/bj2440769","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1042/bj2440769","venue":"The Biochemical journal"}

Methods In total, 69 patients with IVCS were enrolled in the study. The patients underwent computed tomography (CT) venography before treatment. CT observations included assessment of the iliac venous channel sagittal diameter (IVCD) before the lower lumbar vertebra, causes of oppression, thrombus density, and embolization range. The patients with IVCS were divided into the simple IVCS (sIVCS, n = 22), lumbar degeneration-related type IVCS (dIVCS, n = 33), and IVCS of other causes (oIVCS, n = 14) including lumbar fracture, hematoma of infection, and abscess wraping around and compressing the iliac vein, groups. The treatment methods included target venous catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT), a mechanical breaking and sucking treatment for the thrombi, followed by balloon dilatation and iliac vein stent implantation. The factors that may possibly affect the treatment outcomes included IVCS type, duration of disease, thrombus hardness, embolization length, and treatment regimen. Logistic regression was used to analyze the factors that affected the therapeutic efficacy. Results At the first stage, CDT was only effective in 15 cases (5 dIVCSs and 10 oIVCSs) and was ineffective in the remaining 54 cases, which required further mechanical breaking and sucking of the thrombi and intravenous balloon dilatation. In the second stage, combination of thrombi breaking and suction and balloon dilatation was preliminarily effective in 26 cases (6 sIVCSs, 16 dIVCSs and 4 oIVCSs), but during follow-up from 1 to 6 months, treatment was considered futile for 9 recurrent cases (3 sIVCSs and 6 dIVCSs). So, 28 cases of preliminary ineffective treatment and 9 relapse in the second stage were arranged to the third stage of treatment by iliac vein stent implantation. All 37 cases were treated effectively and achieved a satisfactory iliac vein patency, and were followed-up for 24 months without recurrence.

Thirty normal subjects were tested on the Cybex Trunk Extension/Flexion (TEF) and Liftask (LT) machines during maximal (100%) and submaximal (50%) efforts. Considering each test separately, visual assessments of curve variability were indeterminate of degree of effort in 28% of TEF and 34% of LT tests. Measurement models of curve variability were more clearly discriminating. When a given subject's test curves were considered together, scaled visual assessments identified the degree of effort in 91% of TEF and 86% of LT results. The measurement models were accurate 90-92% of TEF and 79-92% of LT results.

Greater understanding of cancer risk has been found to be associated with greater health-related quality of life, improved psychological adjustment and greater health-related behaviours. The aim of this sytematic review was to assess the effectiveness of educational interventions in improving subjective cancer risk perception and to appraise the quality of the studies.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and prospective observational studies. Eligible studies were identified via Medline, PsycINFO, AMED, CINAHL and Embase databases. After screening titles and abstracts, two reviewers independently assessed the eligibility of 206 full-text articles.\n\n\nRESULTS\nForty papers were included in the review; the majority of studies were conducted among breast cancer patients (n = 29) and evaluated the effect of genetic counselling on personal perceived risk (n = 25). Pooled results from RCTs (n = 12) showed that, both in the short and long term, educational interventions did not significantly influence risk perception level (standardised mean difference 0.05, 95% CI -0.24-0.34; p = 0.74) or accuracy (odds ratio = 1.96, 95% CI: 0.61-6.25; p = 0.26). Only one RCT reported a short-term difference in risk ratings (p = 0.01). Of prospective observational studies (n = 28), many did demonstrate changes in the level of perceived risk and improved risk accuracy and risk ratings in both the short and long term. However, only one (of three) observational studies reported a short-term difference in risk ratings (p < = 0.003).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nFurther development and investigation of educational interventions using good quality, RCTs are warranted.","inCitations":["7fed0d22e8c4edcda5e7cfa8f845591c5117497f","2d2a638b0376b76f3b59045d7f54f049a639b1e3","f2c51ec785e7c3363447bd6ad90bd61b71627418","25f2fe274699ba3bef1723210bca9df41d1a5b0c","cded9de92f62906d98fb79045e7b969254ae463e","2a954dfe9193786d90eed8b20db2ca1ecb44ace5","f8cabda2fa10ada8908dbad191e43c54501e5605","cdc4424c82575fdb960f7c583bdea9da1ccbcb8f","7c0c0ac85e24bcd13a61b7ee88b03402de1c9009","27dbff798a3e1bf698e5af6ebe2e7f491c24212e","86fcd58c3d6928e7b39624e9c164df5d0cec4dd0","2bf478e7bd4db775f0e4feb1bf5fb490768ef2ed","26ac0d4da7bb2d4e58ba881e59aae10b1723e42b","5849781af09c73a798c1c463d3a0e82c09a80cc3","3da5f66b4eb44d8bc456061d1107b2d1ad5c7376"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.crd.york.ac.uk/crdweb/PrintPDF.php?AccessionNumber=12014006072&Copyright=Database+of+Abstracts+of+Reviews+of+Effects+(DARE)%3Cbr+/%3EProduced+by+the+Centre+for+Reviews+and+Dissemination+%3Cbr+/%3ECopyright+%26copy%3B+2017+University+of+York%3Cbr+/%3E","https://ses.library.usyd.edu.au/bitstream/2123/14338/2/Accepted-Dieng-Psychooncology-2012.pdf"],"title":"Improving subjective perception of personal cancer risk: systematic review and meta-analysis of educational interventions for people with cancer or at high risk of cancer.","doi":"10.1002/pon.3476","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1002/pon.3476","venue":"Psycho-oncology"}

The three types consisted of nano particles (CeO2-nano), rod-like particles (CeO2-rod) and cubic particles (CeO2-cube). Although the BET surface areas of these cerias correspond roughly with their estimated particle sizes, the loading of gold was the largest on CeO2-cube, which has the largest crystallite size and lowest surface area of the three oxides, and while no significant differences were found in the gold particle sizes in the TEM photographs, the surface density of gold particles was estimated to be the largest on Au/CeO2-cube. The high intensity of the (2 0 0) line compared to the (1 1 1) line in XRD diffraction implies that the (1 0 0) surface was selectively grown in the crystallites of CeO2-cube. Ce L3-edge XANES spectra of the cerias reveal that the population of Ce(III) was larger in CeO2-nano and CeO2-rod than in CeO2-cube. Au 4f XPS showed that there was a higher population of Au(I) on Au/CeO2-nano and Au/CeO2-rod than on Au/CeO2-cube. In the acrolein–methanol reaction, both methyl acrylate and 3-methoxy propanal were formed and comparison of the catalysts revealed that the differences in selectivity to methyl acrylate were small. In contrast, using crotonaldehyde instead of acrolein, the selectivity to methyl 2-butenoate was 100% on Au/CeO2-nano and Au/CeO2-rod and that to 3-methoxybutanal was 100% on Au/CeO2-cube. The differences in activity and selectivity are discussed based on the structures of the catalysts and the α,β-unsaturated aldehyde.","inCitations":["f2dc55472fa1a9a1e92d4e1a39f6988dd99d0672"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Coupling reaction between α,β-unsaturated aldehyde and methanol catalysed by gold-supported on mesostructured cerias","doi":"10.1016/j.apcata.2014.07.012","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apcata.2014.07.012","venue":""}

It is therefore critical to identify key theoretical determinants of exercise during home-based CR in order to inform the development of behavioural interventions that improve adherence. The present study examined the utility of the theory of planned behaviour (TPB) in explaining exercise behaviour during home-based CR. Seventy-six patients who were receiving 6 months of home-based CR completed a TPB questionnaire at the beginning and mid-point of the program and a physical activity scale at the mid-point and end of the program. Path analyses showed that attitude and perceived behavioural control significantly predicted intention for both time intervals (baseline to 3 months, and 3 months to 6 months), whereas subjective norm only predicted intention within the 1st 3 months. Intention significantly predicted implementation intention, which, in turn, significantly predicted exercise for both time intervals. Finally, several underlying accessible beliefs were significantly related to exercise for both time intervals. Therefore, results suggest that the TPB is a potentially useful framework for understanding exercise behaviour during home-based CR.","inCitations":["a416e71c93e60710221a08b699dff5474164cdf0","0709298608b53db7c3b5612f672669bb09a12d9b","08a8ed6091494b4862358c22e6599a2bd26aea93","36f98189eda53b50fd0af5d13fa92fceae927326","437a8585e0d6c8668070f99f925369fcef5a7a96","af3f2a7529888cf61fadc67f9f5229ccac4eb444","d1a7ea48343ae939220b8a9404832a9113cbf8b9","5fb00175adf728b65397e20077eed70c47c53901","4955717f02c665a4d5802fc93ff9ceafea8a7c26","0378a0383f1b7f982661033dbb27f2bc4fa221c1","0c64d1b6f0dee5b23b76b1519da12e3766bc6a16","dd608d4ecd7a179310b52576a0e93d27aa165d28","9a6b669081347ec1060cec641a47159213868820"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Understanding exercise behaviour during home-based cardiac rehabilitation: a theory of planned behaviour perspective.","doi":"10.1139/y07-117","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1139/y07-117","venue":"Canadian journal of physiology and pharmacology"}

The English PGQ was translated referring to the cross-cultural adaptation study process. Forty healthy pregnant or postpartum Japanese women were recruited. Women with pelvic girdle pain (PGP) completed the PGQ-J and 5 other instruments. Internal consistency, construct validity, test-retest reliability, ceiling and floor effects, and discrimination validity of the PGQ-J were analyzed.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe PGQ-J showed high internal consistency with a Cronbach α of .968, and an interclass correlation coefficient of .79. The content validity showed a high positive correlation with the Oswestry Disability Index and Disability Rating Scale.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe PGQ-J was reliable and valid with high internal consistency and content validity for assessing disability owing to PGP in Japanese pregnant and postpartum women.

The objective was to select potential growth promoters and inoculation method of emerald grass plants comparing them with mineral fertilization. In the first assay, nine microorganisms (Pseudomonas fluorescens (BRM32111), Burkholderia pyrrocinia (BRM32113), Pseudoruegeria sabulilitoris strain GJMS-35 (R-92), Bacillus thuringiensis YBT-1518 (R-61) and Bacillus thuringiensis YBT-1518 (R-58), Trichoderma asperellum (UFRA-T.06), T. asperellum (UFRA-T.09), T. asperellum (UFRA-T.12) and T. asperellum (UFRA-T.52) inoculation methods (irrigation and immersion). The experimental design was completely randomized in a factorial arrangement of 8x2 (control / non-inoculated, inoculated with P. fluorescens (BRM32111), inoculated with B. pyrrocinia (BRM32113) inoculated with P. sabulilitoris strain GJMS-35 (R-92) with B. thuringiensis YBT-1518 (R-61), inoculated with B. thuringiensis YBT-1518 (R-58), inoculated with mix composed of P. fluorescens (BRM32111) + B. pyrrocinia (BRM32113) and inoculated with mixtures of T. asperellum (UFRA-T.06, UFRA-T.09, UFRA-T.12, and UFRA-T.52) in two application, irrigation and immersion methods), with four replicates, totaling 64 experimental units. In the second trial, the performance of the best method and the best microorganism in response to the application of mineral fertilization in a completely randomized design in a 4x2 factorial scheme (limestone (without NPK), limestone + NPK (urea, triple superphosphate and potassium chloride), NP n K (urea, Araxá phosphate and potassium chloride) and substrate (soil without NPK / without liming), with and without inoculation) with five replicates. In the first trial, the irrigation application method, independent of the isolate, provided a 65% increase in total dry matter, whereas by immersion the increase was 35% in relation to the control. Analysis of main components reveals that the root dry matter and plant height variables were sufficient to explain the highest percentage of variation of the data. Higher increases were achieved by B. pyrrocinia (BRM32113), with gains of 156% and 92% in root dry matter and plant height, respectively, in relation to the control. In the second trial, better results of height growth, root dry matter, green cover area and accumulation of leaf and root nutrients were achieved in the absence of fertilization. Plants inoculated by irrigation with B. pyrrocinia (BRS3211) and cultivated in substrate had increases of 78% in MSR and 65% in AP. Significant increases were also achieved by inoculation combined with mineral fertilization. The rhizobacteria B. pyrrocinia (BRS3211) proved to be competent in inducing the growth of the emerald grass plant and could be inserted into an ecologically sustainable nutritional management program with potential for commercial use.

In such a scenario, it is required that different loops oscillating due to a common cause and hence similar frequency may be grouped together. In this paper an adaptive method for plant-wide oscillation detection based on multivariate empirical mode decomposition (MEMD) along with a grouping algorithm is proposed. The method can identify multiple oscillation groups among different variables as well as variables with random noise only. The proposed method is also applicable to both non-linear and non-stationary time series where the techniques based on the conventional Fourier analysis are prone to errors. Within each group that oscillate due to a common cause, the method can also indicate the location of the probable root cause of oscillations. The efficacy of the proposed method is established with the help of both simulation and industrial case studies.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compchemeng.2018.06.007"],"title":"Plant-wide oscillation detection using multivariate empirical mode decomposition","doi":"10.1016/j.compchemeng.2018.06.007","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compchemeng.2018.06.007","venue":"Computers & Chemical Engineering"}

Individuals launch firms and, if successful, expand their enterprises to other locations. But new firms must start somewhere, even if their businesses are conducted largely or exclusively on the Internet. Likewise, policymakers at local and state levels increasingly recognize that entrepreneurship is the key to building and sustaining their economies' growth. Although this is a seemingly obvious proposition, it represents something of a departure from past thinking about how local, state, or regional economies grow. Historically, state and local policymakers have put their energies into trying to attract existing firms from somewhere else, either to relocate to a particular area or to build new facilities there. Such smokestack chasing - or, in this cleaner era, simply firm chasing - often has degenerated into what is essentially a zero-sum game for the national economy. When one city or state offers tax breaks or other financial inducements to encourage firms to locate new plants or headquarters, and succeeds, some other city or state loses out in the process. Local, state, and regional economic development centered on entrepreneurship, however, is a fundamentally different phenomenon. The formation and growth of new firms, especially those built around new products or ways of doing things, wherever this occurs, is clearly a positive sum game, not just for the locality, but for the nation as a whole. This essay provides a guide to policymakers and citizens to what is known about the effects of various local and state policies aimed at fostering entrepreneurially driven growth. There is also much we do not know; thus, the essay identifies subjects that require further research.","inCitations":["81643327810f3cea5b5330311ae6dce5b314f43f","41b56c279c3a8e4e811cefa4ae261a4aecba38cb","d6a9fe0350c757fc4e9b26abf5410610c10e4615","c7764583c0f86ecde98585ac87e34cc969400cc3","0fe55b36c559cd1bc1465978e39a9122240614c7","fb599fc1c6e28557d56a071620e6a267031230a5","24d4cda277558669a51b703ad8e58a2928af530a","ca38339c761aae62ae4b0dda274874ba35f14ef1","78886cfefe2514274deaceb7d30532ebf5a2b2de","4e092b30687480ff231f6805a8672a4f5ae671b7","dd764d5e1998e7d125fa0868019a46071c032870","2706a35fe3da7babcaabf15694ea98ee36b604e3","f2276c0754f671e3a59da591cb3f8306d9bee22b","78e04da22e3ec05baa70585d96cf95c0315d12fc","fd52631a20755b31583fdc5f0a736a62c34ffa27","3c2a0597b4bc449d1c72639860b6a848107befbf","649a558f28e9a2bafe9f2667eca8d541721818c8","a4b1a8cfcb9db6f3a37c91a58ff96112d01262fc","032b34475fb8fdbc5aebe51aa7fe6c46e0f42f80","d52cdfea4786cb11391676de5912b29150adfe89","f09ccbef0534b87c5c002e491db7ea62b694017e","541d1b6d95d634876ef2fa90b97b8be1df14da19","975b3725f71baf2ce2e5054b366895719bd5de21","41330c047cef6b8596333a9b76ca6de3f82d3a03","71537dc614a998fd796d9a17ddef6d362979ce24","0b9b7d71c3459c01a0bab2130a1f2a699ab0de49","8c4af6555a1324eadaba0c5e845c8a05b61ad4be","e5a6a0ad6290c96878cf05707a6df6a3e3c78eed"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Publication%20Files/Entrepreneurship%20and%20Urban%20Success_Kauffman_foundation_e6a76acb-532b-46ee-a29e-3642e0e45aca.pdf","https://aese.psu.edu/nercrd/entrepreneurship/research-resources-on-entrepreneurship/publications/entrepreneurship-and-urban-success-towards-a-policy-consensus","https://surface.syr.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1100&context=ecn","https://www.innovations.harvard.edu/sites/default/files/polls-entrepreneurship.pdf","http://www.kauffman.org/uploadedfiles/state_local_roadmap_022608.pdf"],"title":"Entrepreneurship and Urban Success: Toward a Policy Consensus","doi":"10.2139/ssrn.1092493","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.1092493","venue":""}

The heterostracan fishes were jawless, microphagous, devoid of paired fins and encased in a bony armour. The classification is based on the arrangement of the plates of the carapace — the primitive forms possessed a tessellated armour made up of numerous small polygonal plates. Several genera had a tessellated carapace ventrally but large discrete plates dorsally. All further groups are characterized by distinct patterns of plates which remain constant within each order. The proportions in some species suggest sexual dimorphism. \n \n \n \n2. A study of the superficial ornamentation reveals patterns of growth. From the primitive tessellated condition different evolutionary lines can be followed leading to the fusion of these small elements into large discrete plates. Among the latest group of heterostracans there was a secondary redevelopment of tesserae. \n \n \n \n3. Impressions on the inner surface of the plates of the carapace enable certain aspects of the internal anatomy to be reconstructed. The nasal sacs were double, the acousticolateralis system was primitive. The brain was little more than the nerve cord swollen in three places, there was no cranial flexure. Impressions of two pre-otic somites were present, indicating that they had not migrated to form the extrinsic eye muscles. The branchial arches appear to have been of gnathostome type and in some genera spiracles were formed as an adaptation to a benthonic mode of life. \n \n \n \n4. Microscopic sections of the armour demonstrate the existence of four tissues: aspidin, dentine, enameloid and calcified cartilage. Aspidin was originally acellular but later became cellular; the organic matrix was first organized like dentine, but subsequently like bone. Furthermore aspidin was capable of remodelling. Dentine appears to have acted as a skin-like tissue and was capable of regeneration. The significance of enameloid and calcified cartilage in the dermal armour is not well understood. \n \n \n \n5. Until the end of the Silurian the heterostracans inhabited marine waters but from the beginning of the Devonian they colonized the fresh-water lakes and rivers of the Old Red Continent. One major group flourished in a large embayment on the edge of the Tungussian land mass. When the stratigraphical range and geographical distribution of the heterostracans is listed, evolutionary centres can be recognized and also migration routes: during the Upper Silurian the cyathaspids in the Canadian Arctic, the Lower Devonian pteraspids in Eastern Europe, the later Lower Devonian amphiaspids in north-west Siberia (Tungussian Realm), and the Middle and Upper Devonian psammosteids in the Baltic province.

In order to implement appropriate interventions, it is important to understand the symptoms in more detail. Despite the availability of BPSD assessment tools, it is unknown what the current practice of monitoring of BPSD in RACFs. We sought to investigate the current BPSD assessment tools being used in RACFs and explore different stakeholders' views on current practices. A cross-sectional convenience sample of 21 clinicians were identified and administered a questionnaire. Old age psychiatrists, aged psychiatry clinicians, behavior management teams and RACF staff completed the questionnaires. Clinicians reported that objective consistent information about BPSD were important for recommending and implementing pharmacological and non-pharmacological strategies for BPSD; however, the use of validated BPSD assessments in RACFs was not a usual part of clinical practice. RACF staff stated the major barrier to assessment of BPSD was lack of time. Alternate methods of assessing BPSD which consider preferences from clinicians and RACF staff should be further investigated. Modern technology which can allow \"real time\" assessment may be a solution.","inCitations":["9505739f0031b3861d1888f07b45fb8541e3fb31","d588ee3f99b4f5878a9ddc3627e20a791058d206"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Investigating the current methods of assessing behavioral and psychological symptoms in residential aged care facilities in a metropolitan city.","doi":"10.1017/S104161021600226X","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1017/S104161021600226X","venue":"International psychogeriatrics"}

The Odyssee software, one such tool for Fortran 77 codes, has been tested on a sample model that solves a 2D non-linear diffusion-type equation. Odyssee offers both the forward and the reverse differentiation modes, that produce the tangent and the cotangent models, respectively. The two modes have been implemented on the sample application. A comparison is made with a manually-produced differentiated code for this model (MD), obtained by solving the adjoint equations associated with the model's discrete state equations. Following a presentation of the methods and tools and of their relative advantages and drawbacks, the performances of the codes produced by the manual and automatic methods are compared, in terms of accuracy and of computing efficiency (CPU and memory needs). The perturbation method (finite-difference approximation of derivatives) is also used as a reference. Based on the test of Taylor, the accuracy of the two AD modes proves to be excellent and as high as machine precision permits, a good indication of Odyssee's capability to produce error-free codes. In comparison, the manually-produced derivatives (MD) sometimes appear to be slightly biased, which is likely due to the fact that a theoretical model (state equations) and a practical model (computer program) do not exactly coincide, while the accuracy of the perturbation method is very uncertain. The MD code largely outperforms all other methods in computing efficiency, a subject of current research for the improvement of AD tools. Yet these tools can already be of considerable help for the computer implementation of many numerical methods, avoiding the tedious task of hand-coding the differentiation of complex algorithms.","inCitations":["1955bd0a9536090530dfc48588e5cdf2d40cbc48","e1b2aefed97d876bd4cc1cca4b56eaa1a0e63fb5","10857ccd46356d528afcd5ad057a3dab260184f1","73315f4eed0637c91d654d15fa37f073ad7875d2","b2429c30c42d97286011a5be5fedd2d4908a1c1f","8c6fe7a46b9a1f5445059df529293daba2bd5bf9","acae8f664044185b7b506bd199590846822d28ac","4b2a1d59997d0501dc717c5fba352218b7df820f","8ddfd15ae077c8395978fa08dd433c81b608c1d3","49395f67ba7086834927dd471140d9c2c4e179a9","19afd806e31fb592f02e40ebca77c410a438ef06","37e5849c9794ff03f910ea0321fe403029285c6a","48422d58da5956c8b15bd3603449bb7ed4551009","0acaffb485e661111635babefc7bbc8e4c73dbdb","6ac6a1ed5de938bd3364ee92467b10e737bdfe7e","c5492636c198615a35025f051622a31171ee1216"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Automatic versus manual model differentiation to compute sensitivities and solve non-linear inverse problems","doi":"10.1016/S0098-3004(01)00048-6","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/S0098-3004%2801%2900048-6","venue":""}
