We used in vitro transcription system containing the HeLa cell crude extract as the source for RNA polymerase II and initiation factors. Gene fragments of identical length of 0.96 kilobase pair made from hPL1, hPL3, and hPL4 each contained the 5' flanking sequence of 497 base pairs, the first exon, the first intron, and a portion of the second exon. More than 90% transcripts of the hPL1 template were 470 nucleotides long, indicating that transcription was initiated at the proposed cap site. hPL3 and hPL4 genes generated heterogeneous RNA products of about 430, 470, 520, and 680 nucleotides suggesting that multiple start points were recognized for RNA synthesis in vitro. alpha-Amanitin sensitivity of transcription indicated that the DNA-dependent RNA synthesis was carried out by RNA polymerase II. These results show that hPL1, hPL3, and hPL4 genes have functional promoters and multiple initiation sites for transcription. Primer extension analysis of the 5' termini of hPL RNA isolated from term placenta shows that 82-83% of the transcripts are initiated at a region 29 base pairs downstream from a \"TATA\" sequence. This origin is observed in vitro for the transcript 470 nucleotides long. An additional upstream initiation region (-53) accounts for 8% of transcripts in term placenta and corresponds to the origin for the in vitro transcript of 520 nucleotides. At least three other sites 15, 23, and 39 base pairs downstream from the major cap site are functional in vivo. The initiation site at +40 is utilized preferentially for transcription from hPL3 and hPL4 genes in vitro.

To determine the role of microtubule integrity in stimulus-response coupling elicited by two different mechanisms, i.e., engagement of the Fc receptors (FcR gamma II, FcR gamma III) or engagement of the receptor for FMLP, we utilized colchicine (10 microM), which reduces pericentriolar microtubules to 29% of control, and compared its effect with that of nocodazole (50 microM) and lumicolchicine (10 microM). We now demonstrate that treatment of neutrophils with colchicine but not lumicolchicine, inhibits degranulation elicited by engagement of Fc receptors but augments degranulation in response to FMLP. In contrast to the ligand-specific effect of microtubule-disruption on degranulation, superoxide anion production (assembly of the NADPH oxidase) is unaffected by colchicine regardless of the ligand. To determine whether intact microtubules were required for responses elicited by ligation of Fc gamma RII(CD32) or Fc gamma RIII(CD16), mAb directed against these receptors were employed. Treatment of neutrophils with mAb KuFc79 directed against Fc gamma RII(CD32) or mAb 3G8 directed against Fc gamma RIII(CD16) inhibited degranulation of neutrophils elicited by immune complexes (IC). In contrast, removal of most of Fc gamma RIII by phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C did not significantly alter degranulation in response to IC. We conclude that degranulation elicited by IC results from ligation of both Fc gamma RII and phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C-insensitive Fc gamma RIII. The importance of microtubule integrity on the generation of intracellular signals was also examined. Degranulation of neutrophils proceeds via pertussis toxin-sensitive and insensitive pathways; treatment of cells with colchicine did not augment the action of pertussis toxin. Stimulation of neutrophils by chemoattractants results in a biphasic increase in 1,2-sn-diacylglycerol; a rapid increase (\"triggering\") secondary to the action of a phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C, and a late increase (\"activation\") secondary to the action of a phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase C. Treatment of cells with colchicine altered the production of both [3H]-arachidonic acid-diacylglycerol and diacyl[14C]glycerol in parallel to its effect on degranulation. These studies indicate that the requirement of intact microtubules for degranulation is ligand-specific. Furthermore, assembly of the respiratory burst oxidase does not require intact microtubules. Microtubules most likely alter the cycling of specific receptors or the generation of specific intracellular signals required for stimulus-response coupling in the course of degranulation. Intact microtubules are not uniformly required for the discharge of granule contents during exocytosis.","inCitations":["2f34cd0fcc9f887659d62404d778606e7930c951","34cabd1de0e6a8e8eca16d03ba845144cedded32","439ea66d77bbae3a4752c1532d79a05e267ad354","d84156c8bce718da39f43858ddb26565e2a6abdd","375a8b75f19240bd88f5e495ee10783196544c5a","c1699e48b8b6744da8a652854bdafd70de9b6437","3c35705039a2dd405055375d6fda4220fa51bb22","3319cddfe8f9de285c5b55fd621b3cf938a48a85","feef4804953c0a83ab2736615333c2c3b32c0047"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Differences in signal transduction between Fc gamma receptors (Fc gamma RII, Fc gamma RIII) and FMLP receptors in neutrophils.

Based on the Lyapunov–Razumikhin method and impulsive control theory, we obtain some Razumikhin-type theorems on uniform stability, uniform asymptotic stability, and global exponential stability, which are rarely reported in the literature. The significance and novelty of the results lie in that the stability criteria admit the existence of piecewise constant argument and impulses, which may be either slight at infinity or persistently large. Examples are given to illustrate the effectiveness and advantage of the theoretical results.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://advancesindifferenceequations.springeropen.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s13662-018-1725-5"],"title":"Razumikhin-type theorems for impulsive differential equations with piecewise constant argument of generalized type","doi":"10.1186/s13662-018-1725-5","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s13662-018-1725-5","venue":""}

Whilst a number of women may be managed based on a clinical diagnosis alone urodynamic studies may be useful in those women with complex or refractory symptoms. In the first instance all women will benefit from a conservative approach using bladder retraining although a number will require antimuscarinic therapy. For those women with persistent symptoms following medical therapy alternative treatment modalities such as intravesical Botulinum Toxin, neuromodulation or reconstructive surgery may be considered. This review, whilst giving an overview of the syndrome, will focus on a practical clinical approach to managing women with symptoms of overactive bladder (OAB).","inCitations":["05d096446ea13471e14fc4b4d8f79fbe26d9aad1","835a909f9ecea692c5c1598885772f3765ff2ae9","1a96b00f725d349c838cfce75df39493441ef1fc","550b91f3d6e1589c9abd819e7c0091f43c014695","309bdc9d2477cad9439e388c210d56787ed59bbd","0e70ee694a109f45b4e3fab4dcc7218e695e88b2","50efbc63ed3b965d445500f816930bfdef1d9244","9e0609fa1d51acaaf9d0c755cc22563724ae61ba","f3003c56e23cec19590d2864cc68da4d0c6c5c0d","10ae60412bdb444bec27b6c3fa9a19b9195b5b9b","674e900733751a7acc051535f6f9252968e6e976","984a86a0059e7de5d2c13fd02cfd680cee048d88","551ba9fc053f8d65afa5b785b47120a58d152d75","11a0bcf6283dbc6d23fa644e7e4b0f89d4a1de43"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Overactive bladder: diagnosis and management.","doi":"10.1016/j.maturitas.2011.11.016","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.maturitas.2011.11.016","venue":"Maturitas"}

Cluster analysis of RAPD-PCR patterns revealed that six of the isolates represent different strains. The six selected strains were identified as Lactobacillus plantarum by 16S rDNA sequencing, species-specific PCR and multiplex PCR of the recA gene. PCR amplification revealed the presence of genes of the plantaricin cluster described in L. plantarum C11.

Soils play a pivotal role in major global biogeochemical cycles (carbon, nutrient, and water), while hosting the largest diversity of organisms on land. Because of this, soils deliver fundamental ecosystem services, and management to change a soil process in support of one ecosystem service can either provide co-benefits to other services or result in trade-offs. In this critical review, we report the state-of-the-art understanding concerning the biogeochemical cycles and biodiversity in soil, and relate these to the provisioning, regulating, supporting, and cultural ecosystem services which they underpin. We then outline key knowledge gaps and research challenges, before providing recommendations for management activities to support the continued delivery of ecosystem services from soils. We conclude that, although soils are complex, there are still knowledge gaps, and fundamental research is still needed to better understand the relationships between different facets of soils and the array of ecosystem services they underpin, enough is known to implement best practices now. There is a tendency among soil scientists to dwell on the complexity and knowledge gaps rather than to focus on what we do know and how this knowledge can be put to use to improve the delivery of ecosystem services. A significant challenge is to find effective ways to share knowledge with soil managers and policy makers so that best management can be implemented. A key element of this knowledge exchange must be to raise awareness of the ecosystems services underpinned by soils and thus the natural capital they provide. We know enough to start moving in the right direction while we conduct research to fill in our knowledge gaps. The lasting legacy of the International Year of Soils in 2015 should be for soil scientists to work together with policy makers and land managers to put soils at the centre of environmental policy making and land management decisions.","inCitations":["fe9680aec38d74e427fe8a27d608ac3785224f58","987340e2e50fbd4add8fba00e0170a763d25e6e8","30abbe0f0ab031f041e33c80506fdb0300f3ab09","f8d571cf865086e86f9234b40db47cff5a8bbf9f","ca2d432f5353b65188abb1434d3b1adf26177ffa","5d46914102516261e42295d24564bc6a5f8bf38e","097a23f7f2d8e09fa945f42317a3bccc9f1276bf","1142dc74d8d70ba0fe34682e72c8f276236d611a","55787c1bfbc81f7a18700b026f6d1d79f9388d96","87c7afafe94584ac88b552b15aad579496fe7662","f21cac0702f4d8af526f19f8f44cf564fedc5394","31caa791879aa4d3c7f0cb2d3a907843ed74bce3","2fccf1168ca1a23c53875f96cc2d024647589b4b","df898a92a4c06a9c7467211d8bac27a282a5e27b","2ab0cef296464a2d6178cacc87118e72d373ec12","a4a1a32f3d67c3972f1bd5b0044b5e08aafc2b5b","deab508b35174ebbae9e3e7cbafcc82f178ad55e","974a64ef1e6e40e82d5cdd71284fe7ce12de33da","1fbab4197cb13c0cec7b15ebd1f24eb03b5169e8","dd58195c7a80c95819be01081da3d64229241540","1b891ee8cd86b4f432aab82cdbe1abd22deb405f","9a80c32f4c552bac1c3726ec5b2ef8430abe063d","724fdb35d2c4ac3b400b01075ba10db3011de665","0b0a4cd348d2a2ade8fb36741ffaf668b735dacf","af4a9c7fd0cd029054573a96d55ce47014320f4e","cbaa5ad7bd9e6386c6fc54bb372f889e77d83804","378bb852a0aec31015bbd0e691c7af53bf8d031b","6e58c72e7e0a54d4e2d14784571d1c024fb1c31f","248ba3cdeedc3b1c6beb4464c411e6dec40dc2f0","ba5b81b5f127cbd87f479653b6fbe04b67ae779e","eedb41c40a0c92865bc388dfec955e42e36e15f6","5653a3852c74a5bdaea94137b0f66f9ce33a3205","f4a1dd2e93d02af6d6de5921648aba9b7eb6f706","63d0a21acba02d2214c19f471a56890be5fee7ce","d0024f4ce928c9050f29bb90127d58299fa8a276","9e85ccbaeb368da842700dc121a41e6b24224a54","db4d8039abbb1b545c5c86070fb13821131bc3f0","823ab81323993409acb17274d92294eb2b90026d","1624bacec608568f86f02c052d39fd5ad4216fe0","6637882d3059038788a23c3fda8ac66370ecea39","2735bbf235ae056228665bdfbb3360077ea7aef5","9645fef2fc0f00398494f6ecf429bdb5d13c4510","076c16aa28c07ceacc8191263d3405942def39e4","dcbf2ac4d43d828d8945f939104618bd69415eb0","52132149cfdd7b622c1646c4677331e9ab83932a","a4ecc8d8c689ed6a4d775685bc8a9c5312fbe408","7e2a0dc44bfa2a5b5e30b7e99b8ae419421708dc","250801c5af078bccb0006f817309b088c566178c","ee1d5ddd1b8b8335225d5083ee8e0f90e4a61d44","2019e4416e636f0eeae6fd1468e68d54af9cfd13","f2187a03aa23396a93bf5ffe0f68326ae38ee335","c27a7eef49ad31d724a24cab38f7ecc8ef060fd5","73e1bee511331057f0b15c17324ba7870e3f20f8","4110ec8fd382929b6b6e533e577c851b6eedc3f9","7f80b9b7158a9f260f30cb3f59dad3483538662f","a8607378a2ecfbbc65e6451a08fe555e91df3888","56243a34b203ca2cb26999d6d220e3e5dc15386f","e3b108cff40aae037a47c8032815008653b8febd","fff061601efa35ecf2d24c7b56e01edfd694e556","91dded443addebdc01d1b3503fcfdd628c4e8d83","323c2f7d5da3b578eef4d7f2db2e536a7e33ed68","85423670ca28240fd24c6fb1c30a8f27576a9d72","5f3226ddda39ee0b9759b5572618a864d230abc8","f4b51110f9d0f1daea6e07508f142b9115b9d96a","8453de808f8dabac4b7be4be7a21f2d6e3745703","abb80c2913969f1623dfa242c7cb1cd92cc70ae3","4b4c3fc4fc5574fe68ae7ea1e0a9fabc1724e2e7"],"pdfUrls":["http://wiredspace.wits.ac.za/jspui/bitstream/10539/20637/1/Biogeochemical%20cycles%20and%20biodiversity%20as%20key%20drivers%20of%20ecosystem%20services%20provided%20by%20soils.pdf","http://centaur.reading.ac.uk/42162/1/2015%20Smith%20et%20al%20SOIL%20Discussion%20review.pdf","https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/files/169275448/soil_1_665_2015.pdf","https://www.soil-journal.net/1/665/2015/soil-1-665-2015.pdf"],"title":"Biogeochemical cycles and biodiversity as key drivers of ecosystem services provided by soils","doi":"10.5194/soil-1-665-2015","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.5194/soil-1-665-2015","venue":""}

This finding was verified by calculating the dynamical stability, molecular dynamics, and mechanical properties. The α-MnB had an in-plane stiffness Yx (=Yy) around 100 N/m while the β-Mn displayed an asymmetric mechanical stiffness of Yx = 186 N/m and Yy = 139 N/m. Both systems displayed a ferromagnetic ground state with metallic band structures. The calculated magnetic moments were 2.14 and 2.34 µB per Mn-B pair in the α-MnB and β-MnB. Furthermore, we investigated the potential superconductivity. In the α-MnB, we found the unique feature of Kohn anomaly at q~2kF in the diagonal direction of the Brillouin zone. The β-MnB phonon spectra showed a valley of degenerated localized softening vibration modes at the edge of the Brillouin zone. The ZA and LA phonon branches in this valley induced the largest contribution to electron-phonon coupling strength. The calculated total electron-phonon coupling parameters were 1.20 and 0.89 in α-MnB and β-MnB systems. Overall, we predict that the α-MnB and β-MnB systems can display 2D ferromagnetic superconducting states with the estimated critical temperatures of Tc ≈ 10−13 K.","inCitations":["db845241ca6d88c729b14c41aa4d8483f0b1c2e3"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Superconductivity in two-dimensional ferromagnetic MnB","doi":"10.1038/s41598-017-17235-y","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-017-17235-y","venue":"Scientific Reports"}

Indeed, the choice of legal methods can be as important as the formulation of the policy itself. While a good choice of methods will not heal a bad policy, it can help assure that a less-than-perfect choice of policy can be more forcefully realized than otherwise, it can also help improve the policy choices made and help protect democratic legitimacy and the rule of law. While deficiencies in legislation or in the political system may require resort sometimes to policy decisions in the course of law application, legislatures should minimize mixing policy decisions with law application. One of the simplest ways of promoting policy while safeguarding the rule of law is to restrict the effect of policy decisions to the future. In any case, policy decisions can ordinarily be expected to be better made when they are recognized as such, are made by institutions created to make policy decisions, and are reached by decision makers who can appeal to political responsibility as a basis for their decisions.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://scholarworks.law.ubalt.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1774&context=all_fac"],"title":"Policy and Methods: Choices for Legislatures","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Big Data has the potential to transform medical practice by integrating different data sources and making use of real time data, to increase patient s involvement and improve the efficiency of care. Some major challenges are related with understanding its value, ensure security and governance in a way that research, health-care management and patient’s outcomes can be improved. One thought it could be helpful to bring up this discussion to a larger audience, focusing on two main dimensions: the potential impact of Big Data on healthcare and the specific contribution of Medical Affairs (MA). On this regard MA can raise awareness, stimulate adoption of digital tools and electronic data management, support partnerships while mitigating potential safety and commercial risks.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://revista.farmacoterapia.pt/index.php/rpf/article/download/99/84"],"title":"Big Data Opportunities in Healthcare.

For so much, it recommends the use of the model of fields and weapons of the competition (FWC). Besides considerations about production strategy and competitive advantage in the SMC, the work presents a synthesis of the model of FWC, that it is a model quite adapted to formulate the business strategy so much as the production strategies. Field of the competition is where the company looks for competitive advantage and it is defined by the business strategy. Competition weapon is a factor that the organization uses to reach competitive advantage in a field of the competition and it is defined by the operational strategy. For each field of the competition there is a group of appropriate weapons, and the company should make use of them to overcome the competitors. The objective of this work is to determine that group of weapons.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://www.revistas.usp.br/rai/article/download/79094/83166"],"title":"CAMPOS E ARMAS DA COMPETIÇÃO: UM MODELO PARA FORMULAR ESTRATÉGIA DE PRODUÇÃO NAS PEQUENAS E MÉDIAS EMPRESAS DOI: 10.5585/rai.v4i3.109","doi":"10.5773/rai.v4i3.109","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.5773/rai.v4i3.109","venue":""}

As the NF-kappa B transcription factor has a central role in the control of transcription of several genes involved in immune and inflammatory responses, the authors have analysed the activation of NF-kappa B in human umbilical cord T lymphocytes. The activity was tested by quantitating the nuclear proteins binding to an oligonucleotide containing the consensus kappa B binding sequence (electrophoretic mobility shift assay). The data obtained demonstrate that phorbol dibutyrate/calcium ionophore A23187 (PDBu/iono) combination induced a clearly higher nuclear translocation of NF-kappa B in neonatal than adult T cells. This higher NF-kappa B activity was restricted to the CD4+ T-cell subset. Analysis of the nuclear extracts with antibodies directed against the major components of NF-kappa B the p50 and RelA (p65) proteins, indicated that the composition of NF-kappa B was similar in neonatal and adult cells. These results suggest that neonatal T cells are exposed to oxidative stress-inducing signals during delivery and/or are inherently more sensitive to NF-kappa B activating signals than adult T cells.","inCitations":["54996b08c0142dd39499505280d4eaafcbc1764c","25ff38fa072ebf05f612fd57418e17ede1d0d214","13fd9b74f624973adff81d4fa517026a0c38f5ed","af9c3f99d87d8c762331f6713464874c72e83d76","887e72e4e7d3e3105351c190e42a3f4ae2e77c70","5810bb103910889cac0fb102fea05cb8d00d02ab","2829401e3ff5bfee98fb8ed79d66abb646d17ea9","f143e07a07e99523b92ad5276fdf2f4b69e99f6f","36478d38c4177e26397aa268f050fefae86f9eec"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Signals leading to the activation of NF-kappa B transcription factor are stronger in neonatal than adult T lymphocytes.","doi":"10.1046/j.1365-3083.1996.d01-277.x","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-3083.1996.d01-277.x","venue":"Scandinavian journal of immunology"}

One way to do this is to meet some of our food, resource and energy demands with biomass. The major chemical components of biomass are lignin, hemicellulose and cellulose. To utilize them effectively a super tree with an increased polysaccharide and decreased lignin content is needed. Eleven lines of transformants in which the expression of a peroxidase gene has been suppressed were analyzed chemically, biologically and histochemically. The results showed that the lignin content of the transformants was lower than that of the control. It became clear that the lignin content could be suppressed by an antisense RNA method using the peroxidase gene. From the chemical analysis, the liinin of the transformants was found to have more syringyl and uncondensed units than the control. This chemical change faciliited the conversion of biomass and pulping, as shown in a pulping test. It is therefore possible to make a super tree low in lignin and high in polysaccharide.","inCitations":["c26fd9c58ec98a632da9564f821e2f2a5693d971","53539661876f758c4790c1af594a659dea3adc79","7f2c1e77a82f09e0a5a9437c643ec19051a0de51","443ef034b705e6e9a05f0118949d150fe089b744","a05683a023680da8ca8cbd05c42d7d72e38f5d73"],"pdfUrls":["https://page-one.springer.com/pdf/preview/10.1007/PL00014019"],"title":"Formation of a Tree having a Low Lignin Content","doi":"10.1007/PL00014019","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/PL00014019","venue":"Journal of Plant Research"}

Sperm were isolated after thawing using three different sperm preparation techniques: simple washing, Percoll density gradient, and Sephadex columns (SpermPrep Column; Fertility Technologies, Natick, MA).\n\n\nDESIGN\nWomen (n = 98) were randomized upon entry into the program into one of three different sperm preparation methods. The same sperm preparation technique was used for the woman during subsequent cycles, if pregnancy did not occur. The study was stopped when > or = 75 treatment cycles for each group were completed for analysis of PRs per treatment cycle.\n\n\nSETTING\nAll patients were treated at our private care center at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center.\n\n\nPATIENTS\nPatients entering this study were spontaneously ovulating women undergoing IUI with frozen donor sperm.\n\n\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURE\nPregnancy rate per cycle of timed IUI.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAfter 260 cycles of insemination, the PR per cycle was 19.1% with simple washing, 16.9% with Sephadex columns, and 11.4% with Percoll density gradient. Although these results were not statistically different, Percoll density gradient had a 40% lower PR per treatment cycle compared with simple washing. However, Percoll density gradient preparation of sperm resulted in a statistically significant increase in the motility, curvilinear velocity, straight line velocity, and the number of normal heads compared with the other two treatments.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nAlthough Percoll density gradient separation of sperm results in a population of cells that is more motile and morphologically normal, this did not result in subsequent cycle fecundity. These data suggest that the reliance on the averaged values of motility, curvilinear velocity, straight line velocity and morphology may have little predictive value of the potential fertility of frozen-thawed sperm.","inCitations":["7b60e9ede592978ec1e77242dab32eeab4f28f60","c0e827263b6e086eefbf6b57922d0ffbe2f07277","e2cc9b79c5cfd40386eb8d213c8b6f759d35e74a","0c3232ac4775b61b0b3aaa739e5b7f3309bf186a","dd544a6fa1ecf0f4a6382f26dd9d535fff698a28","386bdfeaa8386dc05e3dfc61c4218240d8a0a278"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Intrauterine insemination with frozen donor sperm: a prospective randomized trial comparing three different sperm preparation techniques.","doi":"10.1016/s0015-0282(16)57015-0","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/s0015-0282%2816%2957015-0","venue":"Fertility and sterility"}

In more detail, BRCs are defined by OECD as service providers and repositories of the living cells, genomes of organisms, and information relating to heredity and functions of biological systems. BRCs contain collections of culturable organisms (e.g. microorganisms, plant, animal cells), replicable parts of these (e.g. genomes, plasmids, virus, cDNAs), viable but not yet culturable organisms, cells and tissues, as well as database containing molecular, physiological and structural information relevant to these collections and related bioinformatics (OECD, 2001). Thus BRCs are fundamental to harnessing and preserving the world’s biodiversity and genetic resources and serve as an essential element of the infrastructure for research and development. BRCs serve a multitude of functions and assume a range of shapes and forms. Some are large national centres performing a comprehensive role providing access to diverse organisms. Other centres play much narrower, yet important, roles, supplying limited but crucial specialised resources. BRCs are considered as the next generation culture collections. In an era of globalisation, the OECD BRC initiative to establish the virtual infrastructure Global Biological Resource Centre Network (GBRCN) is essential and requires collections to meet the GBRCN operational standards (OECD, 2007). No single collection can provide the needs of biotechnology and bioeconomy and so a collaborative approach is absolutely necessary. The culture collections have worked for a long time in organisations at global (WFCC – World Federation of Culture Collections) or regional levels (e.g. European Culture Collections’ Organisation (ECCO) and Asian Consortium for the Conservation and Sustainable Use of Microbial Resources (ACM). They have shared biodiversity information at national, European or global levels. However, to guarantee high-quality BRCs and global network efficiency, the transition of traditional culture collections to BRCs is needed to be based on international quality management criteria. For culture collections to work altogether in a network, they need policies and legal frameworks at international, regional and national levels to establish, enhance and develop collections and create BRCs around the world. A strategic project to develop BRCs at European level is the FP7-project EMbaRC-European Consortium for Microbial Resources Centres and at a global level the ongoing demonstrative project GBRCN-Global Biological Resource Centres Network. Micoteca da Universidade do Minho (MUM) is partner in both projects and envisages coordination of policy and legislation developments for accreditation and protection of biological resources and their sustainable utilisation.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://repositorium.sdum.uminho.pt/bitstream/1822/9508/1/Santos_Lima_BCRs_European_Global_Projects%5B1%5D.pdf"],"title":"Biological Resource Centres (BRCs): European and Global Projects","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

The absorption band of P3 exciplex is structureless and very broad, the position of the maximum remaining unchanged.

Textliche Information kann heute den Benutzer auf den unterschiedlichsten Datenträgern erreichen. Diese neuen möglichen Formen der Vervielfältigung verlegerisch zu nutzen, gehört heute zu den die Branche verändernden Anforderungen. Im Mittelpunkt verlegerischen Interesses ist die Verbreitung von Publikationen über die CD-ROM als Trägermedium gerückt; sie ergänzt und ersetzt das Trägermedium Papier. Auch wenn das Spektrum Elektronischen Publizierens weit darüber hinaus geht, sind die nachfolgenden Empfehlungen weitgehend auf diese Publikationsform zunächst abgestellt. Wenn noch vor einigen Jahren nicht zu unrecht die Frage nach dem \"Ob\" gestellt wurde, so kann heute nur die Frage nach dem \"Wie\" gestellt werden. Dabei muß bedacht sein, daß die zusätzlichen technischen Möglichkeiten, Informationen zu verbreiten, nicht das Ergebnis der Weiterentwicklung der bislang von Verlegern genutzter Technik ist; die neuen Techniken haben andere, in der Entwicklung der Computerindustrie liegende Ursachen. Diese haben nunmehr auch den Buchhandel erfaßt und es wird darauf ankommen, die mit der Kulturtechnik Lesen entwickelten Methoden der Aufbereitung von Informationen in Druckwerken, soweit möglich, auch in die neuen Informationstechnologien zu übertragen und die den neuen Informationstechnologien innewohnenden weitergehenden Möglichkeiten zu nutzen. Die Empfehlungen der Arbeitsgruppe Textorientierte CD-ROM (Leipziger Empfehlungen) haben deshalb das Ziel, Elektronische Publikationen zunächst in eine Kontinuität zu gedruckten Werken zu stellen. Insbesondere in der Fachund Sachinformation sind die in Druckwerken verwendeten Funktionen der Erschließung über viele Jahre hinweg entwikkelt und Teil der Arbeitsmethoden der Anwender/Leser geworden. Diese Empfehlung soll aber gleichzeitig Ausgangspunkt einer die Dimensionen elektronischen Publizierens erschließenden Fortschreibung sein. Die Akzeptanz und das Erkennen der elektronischen Produkte als Erzeugnisse der Verlage werden erheblich verbessert werden, wenn Verlage zu erkennen geben, daß elektronische Produkte nicht mit gänzlich geänderten Erschließungsmethoden in Konkurrenz zu gedruckten Medien treten; fatal wäre der Eindruck, auch Verlage würden letztlich Bücher für \"altmodisch\" halten und auf Verfahren setzen, die sie selber nicht entwickelt haben, aber für geeigneter halten, als die von ihnen bislang entwickelten Methoden. Die Empfehlungen der Arbeitsgruppe Textorientierte CD-ROM sollen deshalb die Erarbeitung elektronischer Publikationen ermöglichen, die an die Funktionalität des Buches und damit auch an die Leseund Arbeitsgewohnheiten der Buchnutzer anknüpfen. Bei der Ausarbeitung der Empfehlungen wurde daher auch nicht in erster Linie auf die Fülle der in elektronischen Anwendungen möglichen Funktionen abgestellt, sondern vielmehr auf die Funktionalität des bislang verwendeten Mediums und die Übertragung dieser gewachsenen und bewährten Funktionen auch in Elektronischen Publikationen. Bei der Formulierung der daraus folgenden Anforderungen an von Verlagen zu benutzende Software wurde daher auch versucht, Begriffe und Methoden aus gedruckten Werken mit denen in Software entwickelten zu verbinden. Das Ziel des Papiers ist es nicht, Maximalforderungen aufzustellen; vielmehr kommt es darauf an, Minimalforderungen zu formulieren, die zu erfüllen nach dem Stand der Technik möglich sind. Diese Minimalforderungen betreffen sowohl die formale Aufbereitung als auch die Funktionalität der Software. Angesichts der raschen Weiterentwicklung werden die Empfehlungen fortgeschrieben werden müssen; darüber hinaus können die Empfehlungen auch nach dem jetzigen Stand der Technik noch nicht abschließend sein, denkt man nur z .B. an das Problem der Zitierfähigkeit von EP-Publikationen; diese Frage stellt sich insbesondere bei \"monographischen\", abgeschlossenen EP-Publikationen, weniger bei Datenbanken mit ständig veränderten Inhalten.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://www.jurpc.de/jurpc/show?id=1994_07_73500&type=pdf"],"title":"Leipziger Empfehlungen zum Elektronischen Publizieren","doi":"10.7328/jurpc/19949755","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.7328/jurpc%2F19949755","venue":""}

A working example includes a full-diallel among eight parents was used so that all possible hybrid combinations were included. The objectives of this study were: (1) to compare the GCA and SCA effects before and after partitioning, (2) to evaluate the relative contribution of each parent to its cross combination when it is used as a male or female parent, (3) to estimate maternal effects in the form of GCA and SCA effects, and (4) to estimate the relationship between maternal and reciprocal effects. Results revealed that estimated GCA effects according to Griffing’s method is equal to the average of GCA effects of each parent, after partitioning, when it is used as a male and a female in its hybrid combinations. In addition, the average of the difference between female and male GCA effects would provide precise estimation of the maternal effect. This would prove that maternal effect provides precise estimation to the favorable alleles, which is mainly additive. The SCA effects calculated according to Griffing’s method is the average of SCA effects of each cross and its reciprocal. The average of the difference between SCA effects of each cross and its reciprocal, according to the proposed model, is equal to the reciprocal effect. This would prove that reciprocal effect provides precise estimation to the interaction effect between nuclear and cytoplasmic genes given that the interaction between male and female alleles inside the nucleus of the cross is similar to its reciprocal hybrid.","inCitations":["adec1d457a473c4407dad9accc8ea8d88b9e5c65","00c400e386cba00efb5c7ca006ddfaedf89ccf53","3d9ee8892b7066fff346cf0c3b2a8d78d561c42a","4ad925c40371f706dd1e64ff20b602873367fcd6","8407ae413ee61de43ef2c9885a394e0a4533c54b","a00a155d99e2acd9dc54bdf8d9e8848cd7353745","61c8006c3ec1146183fb7bcc9e1091bb344283ac","93bb9787efe13d5a532b52923a868c16eea73caf","43773e54c8fb8a0939af32bed500b144718972d2","bfaf4b309c7963caa238b2968161888f44b41385"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.ccsenet.org/journal/index.php/jas/article/download/7813/7834"],"title":"Partitioning of General and Specific Combining Ability Effects for Estimating Maternal and Reciprocal Effects","doi":"10.5539/jas.v3n2p213","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.5539/jas.v3n2p213","venue":""}

To investigate the mechanism of cytotoxicity, we studied the effect of PHA on cytosolic calcium [( Ca2+]i) and cAMP in the S49 mouse lymphoma cell line. PHA produced a slow continuing rise in [Ca2+]i. Estimation of cell number by Coulter counting showed that PHA induced rapid lysis of S49 cells in a dose-dependent manner. Nicardipine (10(-5) M) did not prevent PHA induced cell lysis or [Ca2+]i increase. Also ionomycin (10(-7) M) did not induce cell lysis. The data suggest that PHA induced increase in [Ca2+]i is the result rather than the cause of cell lysis. Elevated intracellular cAMP has an antiproliferative effect on S49 cells. PHA had no effect on cAMP levels in S49 cells. Also S49 cyc- clone which is deficient in Gs was susceptible to killing by PHA. These results suggest that the cytotoxic effect of PHA on S49 cells is rapid, but is not mediated by cAMP generation or an increase in [Ca2+]i, and other mechanisms should be investigated.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Phytohemagglutinin rapidly lyses S49 T-lymphoma cells and the cytotoxicity is not mediated by generation of cAMP or increase in cytosolic calcium.","doi":"10.1016/0006-291X(90)90496-A","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/0006-291X%2890%2990496-A","venue":"Biochemical and biophysical research communications"}

Its incidence could be underestimated in template regions. We describe the manifestations of leptospirosis in an area of Southwestern Spain. Patients and methods Eighty-six cases of leptospirosis (April 1997–April 2013) were retrospectively analyzed. The diagnosis was based in clinical and serological (Leptospira IgM ELISA) judgment. Epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and prognostic dates were recorded. Results The mean age was 43.1 ± 13.8 years (84.9% males). The mean annual incidence was 1.99/100,000. There were activities of risk in 94%:82.5% contact with animals (57.4% pigs, 38.1% dogs, 31.7% cows, 22.2% sheeps), and 31.7% contact with pooled water. The most frequent symptoms were fever (94.1%), arthromyalgias (60.7%), and cephalalgia (53.3%). The main laboratory alterations were hypertransaminemia (48%), renal insufficiency (26.3%), and thrombocytopenia (16.9%). A lymphocytic meningitis was associated in 11 cases (12.5%) and a picture of Weil's disease was observed in 13 patients (15.1%). The patients with meningitis were younger (31.2 ± 9.2 versus 44.8 ± 15.2, p = 0.004). The patients with Weil's disease were older (53.5 ± 15.8 versus 41.2 ± 14.5, p = 0.007). Fifty seven patients were hospitalized (66.3%) and 6 patients died (7.0%). Factors independently associated with mortality were age > 60 years (odds ratio [OR] 45.0, confidence interval 95% [CI 95%] 4.7–434.6) and diagnosis of Weil's disease (OR 15.8, CI 95% 2.5–98.7). Conclusions In our experience, leptospirosis have a not despicable incidence and tends to show fever and arthromyalgias in men with risk activities.

In vegetative organs, LEC2 expression is negatively regulated by Polycomb Repressive Complex2 (PRC2) that catalyzes histone H3 Lys 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) and plays a crucial role in developmental phase transitions. To characterize the cis-regulatory elements involved in the transcriptional regulation of LEC2, molecular dissections and functional analyses of the promoter region were performed in vitro, both in yeast and in planta. Two cis-activating elements and a cis-repressing element (RLE) that is required for H3K27me3 marking were characterized. Remarkably, insertion of the RLE cis-element into pF3H, an unrelated promoter, is sufficient for repressing its transcriptional activity in different tissues. Besides improving our understanding of LEC2 regulation, this study provides important new insights into the mechanisms underlying H3K27me3 deposition and PRC2 recruitment at a specific locus in plants.","inCitations":["ded40a5ad9b39bf474ed48801bc624ae726f411e","91d2cff3c31f0df11ed16ca073d796420020c7ac","081524cbcebdf9a16e2e591576b2be6e6dccfca8","592d2b6d7324bd0f0b4c69ea1c64dadb9e386c07","d1ae1098a037bdb83e6d5d1f5297c0467b0cf31f","9c3dbb402233b0ea7eec78787933f46d907c7010","d6f66c5f8b069007df2a7286f7f6d7310ac1c592","565de5232211ce067f6fc67bbf4c3799b0861921","6cf431df6b3722727d78fc58fd14ee9486ec3c3d","1d1d8e75a47aa8e8b7c5907152cfe5d98c3c254b","1bffd35fd129a1901f7e442af34fd065e55dfcbe","8e41041528fc04e7f6c8ba931dc7ee6e02977836","a3206920a9472b6b0b4203d474eb2ddcfd304c02","0d35e0703166243973317fb9a164ee55ca5b92c8","a46e4969374e46482852a03cee48658fea79c846","1e1aef307c84c2f0a4d52a4351c32b5f1e56e25e","eba8c3318b8256bb690817dcde2173eee74edd1d","9781fc322441fab829bad5b6086e7314519d81ee","be8f606d877c2e283eb6bb9cf952ef5f433c932d","3814045ec4c39783b9086db8dfd600bc36078e48","0d5179ba587e9f1f9dc6da7dc56fd05807c0064f","97d7d7f3f970cad4005e2748bbbf5aecbc516bd6","205d89ab2df024dfc2795c7bde6963c50b3ed71c","6f5851f867f5c2af6bfa35fb3f2539ece40479d9","f5d587c3e403cb39ef79c26a33aa6ae4253e4846","afb012d95a82405daba7b970f77ff1a446cf0d3a","6400223476681b1b615d33693357a440e71d8202","5800be9cd41038eb663871b0bcf0c7890b07c21f","40a84edf9ba784222df77810329cdb1884c94ec3","1ee8ba219c674e20553be2aa8875e48ddb2b0d7f","47820262625c14e85ff49b9059982dfea31fcfa7","c0a6596052b7e767ca7e4a279c0273cce5253c89","4c7377ebc8b59bce4490ca626d23d3d94775433f","c86eae76b11c314e41a791e82162c4043e6e1cf6","4f07f415ab3aedae2e5d082e3743a1c666185ebb","75bdc7bafd1d95d95a7ef47b6639412bcd0cd97b","e656d9085c7dcc567c6d17955c40892699d72345","33b3cf67a01d385292b6a840b573450e21c79d14","19edee01f036b8ac44bcc8f5e2e75e69a6c60d69","9881753175e299822e02480989f344d04b7fe75d","ed053578e67a1c4bdad58a8e91d099bf4b937c4d","baa68717176c78841e290e2bccedc13387e1c43b","ae967c235d69c016438b7a94d876cbefe0428276","da582a6ac1a5165e940531371b57356fed577a3c","fb6307c0a247db7f0c793b77f1413a5a98789c99","12cbd051fe6e7b70b3793955020572a67f79918e","01b12a0e8353d2744be77498911f5c2f4f22444f","0117eb505668c55886c6621d49c4902b145bb862","62c74a5800175da3745e21af6ee808c2d22e6017","e2f9e230f603ff9856661e777ff1a74b9ee0bb69","c2f7e760e2ca29dac27caa7e8f74d1a7808794a7","ff4f7219f422ccb4326740d3d0b090fe06ee3bb4","078774fb5c17889de7c170b7c75c4fcb86bc211f","2c1087e31b1bfd95707d44bd7c1272824094c829","dcc027cf6180624a6878995e4a8bc174f80983d1","3d5859576a207c0f1b11ec4d6da70ab926df16f5","8edc6cb37d7451c2b9e7cd0575e4048570147ee3"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.plantcell.org/content/plantcell/23/11/4065.full.pdf"],"title":"Transcriptional regulation of Arabidopsis LEAFY COTYLEDON2 involves RLE, a cis-element that regulates trimethylation of histone H3 at lysine-27.","doi":"10.1105/tpc.111.087866","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1105/tpc.111.087866","venue":"The Plant cell"}

Therefore in SIOP 2001, post-operative treatment for BT-WT was prolonged and intensified (VCR/Act/Dox in stage I, VP16/Carbo/Cyclo/Dox in stage II-IV) aiming to improve survival. Here, we present characteristics and outcome of BT-WT patients treated on intensified regimen in SIOP 2001. Methods: Response and survival analysis of unilateral BT-WT (n = 238) patients treated from 2001-2012 (SIOP 2001) were compared with SIOP 93-01 (n = 113). Results: In SIOP 93-01 and SIOP 2001 trials, among 4061 unilateral non-metastatic Wilms tumor patients registered, 351 (8.6%) were BT-WT. Median age at diagnosis was 43 months (IQR 24-68). Stages were: I (n = 140, 40%), II (n = 106, 30%), III (n = 105, 30%). Pre-surgery chemotherapy reduced tumor volume from median 359 ml (IQR 174-611) to 123 ml (IQR 41-291).

The particular characteristics of the Zoroastrian veneration of fire can be defined as follows: first, because they emphasize the purity of fire, they avoid as far as possible any contamination even of the hearth-fire. Second, they place a sacred fire, especially established and perpetually maintained, in a temple, and make offerings of three kinds, fuel, incense and fat, to it itself. However, if these particularities are considered as reasons for naming Zoroastrians 'fire-worshippers', the second one needs to be re-examined, for Zoroaster himself did not mention temple fires, and the concept of the temple fire is not found even in the later Avesta. According to Greek writers, the Persians in early Achaemenian times appear not to have had a temple cult. Nevertheless, some time in the fourth century B.C., possibly in the reign of Artaxerxes II, the temple cult of fire seems to have been established, perhaps in reaction to the image cult of Anahita. Since that time, the temple cult of fire has occupied a central part in Zoroastrian observance. The development of this cult can be traced from archaeological evidence, such as surviving fire altars and their representations on seals, coins and tomb-reliefs, and also from temple remains. There is also the evidence of the Pahlavi books, and the living Zoroastrian tradition.","inCitations":["987e2c140ae309a3bb5cd07fd37a23dc788840b2"],"pdfUrls":["https://greeksoftheorient.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/yumiko-yamamoto-the-zoroastrian-temple.pdf"],"title":"The Zoroastrian Temple Cult of Fire in Archaeology and Literature (ii)","doi":"10.5356/orient1960.17.67","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.5356/orient1960.17.67","venue":""}

The thread-like structures of neurons and micro-vessels pose a unique problem in visualization since they tend to be densely packed in small volumes of tissue. This makes it difficult for an observer to interpret useful patterns from the data or trace individual fibers. In this paper we describe several methods for dealing with large amounts of thread-like data, such as data sets collected using knife-edge scanning microscopy (KESM) and serial block-face scanning electron microscopy (SBF-SEM). These methods allow us to collect volumetric data from embedded samples of whole-brain tissue. The neuronal and microvascular data that we acquire consists of thin, branching structures extending over very large regions. Traditional visualization schemes are not sufficient to make sense of the large, dense, complex structures encountered. In this paper, we address three methods to allow a user to explore a fiber network effectively. We describe interactive techniques for rendering large sets of neurons using self-orienting surfaces implemented on the GPU. We also present techniques for rendering fiber networks in a way that provides useful information about flow and orientation. Third, a global illumination framework is used to create high-quality visualizations that emphasize the underlying fiber structure. Implementation details, performance, and advantages and disadvantages of each approach are discussed","inCitations":["ee8174568b64decd98976cfaacfdfd2d68f484e7","45c91e1185b4772e5afa938d58a661671de20596","03fc4faa7f851544359f39e3cf79f0650495d94a","c6a5ef2063a1fccbdeca432c961d6a79aba63561","7fa7c75c81a05c2e8cda34c250b62f7c41dac2d7","da2e89f14d112e3aab257938616951670473b4da","8de80ffafbb12150ea137b7f654ca14fd4530d36","2406ebb48c74ea9b1c075d933eedbf658d048f3e","7141dce12854a0d208261b12c4341dee502c297d","27f56aa4f6cca73c6ae799ac8c2f954e949d9efd","6655f949bfb4e471c44825a1b8443c7447204a16","3f6e94751255c31b675910a8621ad88f49d0cd27","79c431fbafebb7c734fb0ca96e46f0bbfda3a8a8","30d9775284c6b68692e3fdb170d62bdc05ca6840","5280a623e2a62d5b32d945d174a7b6258646b7d9","fe8c6145775318be8eff0bdf84afbcf60d5c6565","059adf81529b712bc533e131152c47447442bfa7","5681caa5691b0b0b5c9e35bda197d1f67d062e62","6c4877823f96190f22cce80272daf7435489afb2","19a0b6b16b47b21dcadf10eadd70b9ed7e9eee0f","b8cdc3e9c787efa8cc63aca5848d46c19ee5028d","1cb590932933528b2ac73fa748ac6fbdd4a0ff8c","67be58fa9fc4d97dcf7f5f995fa9dde6d2fd4296","d23fb58d8a78ea2327e3b6841a1ce8a0b60f3b4f","98883bdd6ffdd919dff957db19af53b0ceb8ff58","eef31d2ff13e5736af0e321a95c5649bd9a21071","788f59bf5399f4e90fcd06e1888346e5b1fa6126","10a7563328583313e06436e7954f786403475f92","b9fc3b00282f0dad9ae59697a0ff106161e987a1","6eff49923f1a171c1bee0951fe2d7c0338dd2c97"],"pdfUrls":["http://research.cs.tamu.edu/keyser/graphics/people/melek_Z_files/Visualization%20of%20Fibrous%20and%20Thread-like%20Data.pdf","http://research.cse.tamu.edu/bnl/static/papers/melek.tvcg06.pdf","http://research.cs.tamu.edu/keyser/Papers/Vis2006.pdf","http://research.cs.tamu.edu/bnl/static/papers/melek.tvcg06.pdf","https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q33262459","http://research.cs.tamu.edu/bnl/papers/melek.tvcg06.pdf"],"title":"Visualization of Fibrous and Thread-like Data","doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2006.197","sources":["Medline","DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2006.197","venue":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics"}

Airborne particulate samples from the work atmosphere of a Soderberg carbon-paste plant were collected on glass fiber and Acropor filters using high volume samplers. The filters were Soxhlet-extracted using cyclohexane and extractable matter was subject to a liquid/liquid separation. The PAH-fraction was concentrated and separated on a gas chromatographic system with the possibility of mass spectrometric identification. More than 40 PAH compounds and some heterocyclic compounds having from 3-6 rings have been separated and identified. Quantitative determinations show that some of the PAH-components are 2-3 decades more abundant than recently reported data from urban air samples. The results are presented as a PAH-profile.

Irreversible enzyme inactivation was achieved after 2 min at 80 degrees C and 0.1 MPa. Enzyme inactivation at 0.1, 200, 400, and 600 MPa and 40 degrees C followed first-order kinetics. The enzyme showed residual activity of 50% after 12 min at 600 MPa and 40 degrees C. Mobility of aromatic side chains of the enzyme molecule was observed in all temperature- and/or pressure-treated samples; however, high-pressure treatment at 600 MPa induced a loss of tertiary structure and a significant decrease in the alpha-helix content. The relative content of beta-strand substructures was significantly increased after 30 min at 600 MPa and 40 degrees C or 2 min at 0.1 MPa and 80 degrees C. We conclude that the active center of MTG, which is located in an expanded beta-strand domain, is resistant to high hydrostatic pressure and pressure-induced inactivation is caused by destruction of alpha-helix elements with a corresponding influence on the enzyme stability in solution.","inCitations":["bf853f665f97106388e79e665dab16f411f7e185","daea641ebb9f1de1a16ff9e7cdbeabc9de6dc3da","53f992a8ef13f616c51a6e0386d7f0943bd141ac","47fed94ca438e30b569651722f7c74f9aba5c9ee","7478f169c34bc97f6d30366b070249b705c83325","cfc75815229efd561d54030da9e3576d4fd565f4","c84f6bc165c0d170874e33a8fa056937f505b977","1ed26b09d16382b085ebf972a522b8dbb29b7a2d","537c3ecdeeaa4e24c9034c40957ea94d0f0c72fe","eb24df069f2257678e938641c8a3e87def5eb02d","88459471b1ddcac8963db8aa984c6c9983f23154"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Structural changes of microbial transglutaminase during thermal and high-pressure treatment.","doi":"10.1021/jf0522863","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1021/jf0522863","venue":"Journal of agricultural and food chemistry"}

It consists of 6 cases (12 eyes), various ages (from 2 to 10 years old), different sexes (4 males- 2 females). All dogs showed: different stages of muco purulent filaments and redness; they were negative to fluorescein; Schirmer tear test I (STT I) on right eye was 5,8 ± 2,0 mm/1 min on left one was 6,0 ± 1,4 mm/1 min; cytology showed many inflammatory cells. The dogs were topically treated with purified murine NGF diluted in paraffin oil (value: 50 microgram/ml) for 4 weeks (2 drops every 12 hours). \n \n \n \nResults: The result of these studies showed a significant improvement as evaluated by STT I. Thus, the right eye was 13,1 ± 2,4 mm/1 min (p < 0,05), left eye was 14,0 ± 2,4 mm/1 min (p < 0,05). Moreover, dogs treated with NGF displayed decreased purulent corneal secretion and redness and improvement of corneal transparency. Cytology analysis indicated a significant reduction in the number of corneal inflammatory cells. \n \n \n \nConclusions: This report demonstrated that NGF is involved in the regulation of tears production, most probably by acting on tear-producing cells. NGF caused also a marked anti-inflammatory action of the dog’s cornea. This result confirmed and extended previous evidences on human dry eye and previous findings suggesting a potential therapeutic utility of NGF in spontaneous KCS affecting dogs. Neverthless, further clinical studies are necessary to assess the consistency of this clinic approach.","inCitations":["86435755cdbfc8d12f7b3f9ea463dce6af668e83"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"NGF topical administration in dogs affected by spontaneous keratoconjunctivitis sicca","doi":"10.1111/j.1600-0420.2007.01062_3171.x","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0420.2007.01062_3171.x","venue":""}

Discrimination occurs while the bee is on a flower; workers probe rewarding flowers as well as empty ones that have rewarded in the recent past, but they do not probe flowers that have had no reward. Recognition is not the result of honey contamination left on the flower by the bee during feeding. The deposit is only slightly soluble in water or ethyl alcohol but is very soluble in pentane.","inCitations":["2553da3ac7b5aa7b0263094233ae896aff82b75f","e78bfa3d13e4bb8bacc99c2f3e6af4edb807373a","5a98d7949814050f559a17f6b92129e9fede321c","872b0ee1383e0d432d7756149f1ac29494c76d0a","e36ff2173a049bc66ea0fb3a6af98dc4c720341d","3362a10615315e7cde04ddd1bcf3be04d20a601b","970c29a17ba064a0d235d25be658b69563140601","c371c03ee2e8f6f153b034f1731f3f4ccb2c4924","11392845a6b419527773ff6b8ab6b446470e0b3e","5f3ddd249b949a33e9dcdad89e9dd9f53b75787b","cf45ecfb339bc9857d0b2327c0f983fcd683163c","0451e2447a765cdaf15b38738e9540627488fe48","6a4166661fead0c8b038af328192760f6c9c5f36","d0dd4b6808913951691ab2cb161a621e1684c39d","65bd9784540a43743784f7f66e04592af44a86af","c940d9d9f2492c21d28e1d7c415d08aeec186c6b","c3ed8123b26b95f8076c00ecfd59f31ded68d21c","9955b9f8a3b8a34c066755d2f1e1726bda7615cc","0ba39f6a7034bc92fcfe6b0b0843e747688cf56e","3d35bcdd546f0813ec30305b5cc56fede313e264","e23bcb04f19fb3ba6d0ca98486d09fa1991b2b59","b6f3b311a8e1becce155c41826c1470a7ed4568e","d9a7e3e8a416ab208c86838f3313413e37bbc275","cd93959b04366d8e67d66f3cfd0b4a670634b8dc","cb94b29118f302b90c016856b7c4a990eba45bc9","5be21ef06df4fbcc4854c54454c3d3190ebb5528","cdcf13668cfa0d2fd2c6ab2f49742e4302ec6193","c8c092c74b0826a33748b2325d538c45c2ad2cb1","41aa7f48c37993aeb393117cd4498eec9815af74","bcde4fc7c6d8d5a3a8b0abd8bb3eb343923d94c2","eba1accb61b410519be5a8840b97bf0b57ff3c84","c388ed455cf59606a3669f05b66662f48b2b4b9e","337ac44d228e762eb9146a231f33d0bdd155d25b","9c8965d27de02d22ca03d849f891fbcf37a9538b","fbe3e493a79dfaaa3d38832f3a4260464a41a154","e4b9fa5a061422c20459bf49ed82b8a21ca77328","cdd64bbe68cdd987e9b6b20cc65223a3724fda8b","dff44129165e4aa543de9389ffb4f3117e85a75a","6de5d14a8995587dfa1f38554a3cd8aa4959d1c1","97dcc94cdb3b084d6852c529709415118db21f3d","afbd80de56a49917e27fe172e16c207c5ff661d7","23d389aab8a0218a5bda99b93e995c58f4de02f0","1634fec79305874a39b2b6ff32e53bc789cef325","055081ff7b0b7e80bdbef9d3d93a2b458b542cc2","c473b76eb34d733fadaa18b4acf41c91d26c5dae","8276e1284c906ef19f077c1fa10b9384fcf13caa","de25f6398baaa1e9697098558e8a82fb6f909d50"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.life.illinois.edu/scameron/pdfs/Chemical%20signals%20in%20bumble%20bee%20foraging.pdf"],"title":"Chemical signals in bumble bee foraging","doi":"10.1007/BF00299880","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/BF00299880","venue":"Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology"}

To test the possible origins of the cooperative inhibition of superoxide release, we have examined the effect of a panel of polysaccharides on superoxide release in the presence or absence of immune complexes. Although exposure to particulate beta-glucan and hyaluronan triggered superoxide release from neutrophils, other polysaccharides including chitin and mannan were without effect. Both chitin and mannan, but not other polysaccharides, inhibited the immune complex-mediated stimulation of superoxide release in a dose-dependent fashion. In sharp contrast to the cooperative inhibition mediated by monosaccharides, chitin and mannan exhibited Hill coefficients of 1. This inhibition of superoxide production was not due to simple blockage of Fc receptors since fluorescent immune complexes bound equally well to neutrophils in the presence or absence of mannan or chitin as shown by epifluorescence microscopy and quantitative fluorometry. Furthermore, this inhibition of superoxide release was not observed when neutrophils were stimulated with phorbol myristate acetate and ionophore A23187 or hyaluronan. Therefore, the specific inhibition of superoxide production by mannan and chitin could not be explained by either receptor blockage or by some nonspecific effect on cells. We suggest that these molecules interfere with a step in transmembrane signaling, presumably involving the integrin CR3. The observed Hill coefficients suggest the possibility that one polysaccharide may simultaneously bind to two monosaccharide binding sites yielding a Hill coefficient of 1, whereas individual monosaccharides separately bind yielding a Hill coefficient of 2.","inCitations":["218da5431cb884edaa94984f0623ff4113420377","62b3077b2afe156acd4184aa67e6d3e66791d51a","023dc1f9f343a5b6b71c359cf3c9c64e4f5ad21c","72bf3cfc23ddb681abf2512a6c11ea8d5009d5e3","8964fcb620b17dc669348f41121a50a9ff3bfcdd"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Influence of polysaccharides on neutrophil function: specific antagonists suggest a model for cooperative saccharide-associated inhibition of immune complex-triggered superoxide production.","doi":"10.1002/jcb.240560217","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1002/jcb.240560217","venue":"Journal of cellular biochemistry"}
