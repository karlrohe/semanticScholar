Atg7 is essentially required for formation of theautophagosome. The DMARD chloroquine (CQ) has been identified to arrest autophagy function by blocking the fusion between autophagosomes and lysosomes. Accumulating evidence demonstrates that autophagy is involved in the pathology of varies diseases including infections, cancer and neurodegeneration and recent reports also linked autophagy to osteoclastogenesis and rheumatoid arthritis. Objectives Osteoporosis is a disease associated with aging and hormones imbalance that causes bone fragility and susceptibility to fractures result from increased osteoclastogenesis and insufficient osteoblastogenesis. The underlying mechanisms are incompletely understood. Here, we investigated the role of autophagy in the murine model of osteoporosis. Methods Systemic bone loss was induced by ovariectomy (OVX). Autophagy was modulated by genetic as well as pharmacologic approaches. For genetic inhibition of autophagy, we crossbred Atg7 fl/fl mice with LysM Cre + mice to generate Atg7 fl/fl x LysM Cre + mice with selective inactivation of autophagy function in the monocyte lineage. For pharmacological inhibition, eight-week-old mice underwent daily intraperitoneal injection of 20mg kg -1 CQ for a total of 50 days. We applied Microcomputed tomography to analyze bone density in vivo. TRAP staining and bone histomorphometry were used to confirm osteoclast number in tissue. To assess osteoclast formation and activity in vitro , Atg7 fl/fl x LysM Cre + BMCs and CQ treated BMCs were cultured on bone slices and analysed by the TRAP staining and Toluidine blue staining (n=6, for each group). Results To investigate the effect of CQ on OVX-induced systemic bone loss, we analyzed the bone density (bone volume/trabecular volume; Bv/Tv) and the trabecular number (Tb. N.) at the proximal tibias. Bv/Tv and Tb. N. were strongly reduced in sham-treated OVX mice. The decreases in Bv/Tv and in Tb. N. were reduced by 76 % and 60% in CQ treated OVX mice (n=6, p Conclusions We demonstrate that inhibition of autophagy either by genetic or by pharmacological approachessignificantly reduced OVX-induced osteoporosis in mice. These findings identify the autophagy machinery as a potential target for the treatment of osteoporoses. Considering the potent anti-osteoporotic effects and the availability of approved inhibitors such as CQ, these findings may have direct translational implications.

Screening radioimmunoassays after sample clean-up were sufficient for a first survey of MPA treatments in livestock herds. Validation of all positive samples was performed by two-dimensional (silica gel diol phase and RP-18 phase) HPLC/RIA immunograms. Megestrol acetate and melengestrol acetate with cross-reactivities of 31% and 0.3% respectively were clearly separated by the RP HPLC. With an absolute detection limit of 4 pg MPA/tube (90% relative binding) negative control samples did not exceed 6 pg/tube, equivalent to 6 pg/g fat in the validating method. Seventeen days after intramuscular (i.m.) injection of 24 mg MPA only 32 pg MPA/g fat were found, while i.m. injection of 60 mg MPA and a waiting period of 19 days resulted in 2700 pg MPA/g fat. After feeding two calves 20 micrograms MPA per head daily for 1 week followed by 200 micrograms MPA per head daily for 2 weeks 359 and 468 pg MPA/g fat were measured. In plasma as well as in adipose tissue more than 80% of the whole immunoreactive material was MPA itself, without indications for the presence of cross-reacting MPA metabolites as confirmed by HPLC/RIA immunograms. Based on day of slaughter ratios of accumulation of MPA from plasma into fat of MPA-fed veal calves were 52 and 72 respectively. In urine MPA was only detectable a few days after injection; as compared to a plasma concentration of 950 pg MPA/ml the amount in urine was only 37 pg MPA/ml and also 325 pg unidentified MPA-equivalents/ml.","inCitations":["4d469733f5e160e502ade0818bde52fbf65c05c3","f10f6e81f314ebb9d54d183de3732b03019515f6"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Control of illegal medroxyprogesterone acetate-application in veal calves by residue analysis in adipose tissue using HPLC/RIA methods.","doi":"10.1080/02652038909373739","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1080/02652038909373739","venue":"Food additives and contaminants"}

Para tanto, o artigo inicia-se pela analise sucinta das 2(duas) especies de celulas-tronco existentes, ou seja, as adultas e as embrionarias, alem de demonstrar, de modo superficial, a diferenca entre ambas. Posteriormente aprecia-se especificamente a polemica e a importância da liberacao do uso das celulas-troncos embrionarias para possibilitar o tratamento de inumeras patologias, tais como de inumeras doencas neurodegenerativas, letais ou gravemente incapacitantes, ou seja, aborda a polemica que ronda a utilizacao de celulas-tronco embrionarias para o tratamento de doencas graves e letais. Demonstra-se no artigo as divergencias existentes em relacao ao uso de embrioes como materia-prima para a terapia com celulas-tronco, citando inclusive a posicao de maior parte das religioes que entende ser esta terapia um atentado contra a vida. Busca-se evidenciar de forma clara e concisa que tal posicao religiosa nao corresponde a realidade, pois os embrioes utilizados seriam os armazenados nas clinicas de fertilidade que depois de determinado periodo sao descartados, ou seja, caso nao sejam utilizados para este nobre fim de salvar vidas, serao apenas lixo hospitalar. Finalizando, concluiu-se que deve nosso Ordenamento Juridico permitir o uso de embrioes para fins terapeuticos, mesmo havendo divergencias nos aspectos eticos e religiosos, pois esta terapia para milhares de individuos constitui a unica esperanca de cura e em muitos casos a unica esperanca de vida, sendo o direito a vida plenamente garantido a todos em nossa Constituicao Federal vigente. Nao cabe ao Ordenamento Juridico impedir os avancos tecnologicos e cientificos que possam beneficiar a humanidade, mas sim, cabe a ele, estabelecer normas capazes de impedir a utilizacao desses avancos em praticas potencialmente perigosas e/ou nocivas para a raca humana. Sendo assim, deve-se almejar valores fundamentais de referencia que possam guiar juridicamente a atividade cientifica. Ressalta-se, ainda, ser necessario uma analise mais profunda desse assunto para se obter o seu exato significado e consequencias para a humanidade. No entanto, ate o presente momento, por todo exposto e analisado no presente trabalho cientifico, nossa opiniao e favoravel ao uso de celulas-tronco para fins terapeuticos, inclusive as de origem embrionaria.

As a proof of concept, K-BILDS was applied to cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) with HeLa cell lysates. Subsequent enrichment and MS/MS analysis identified 279 candidate PKA substrates, including 56 previously known PKA substrates. Of the candidate substrates, nuclear autoantigenic sperm protein (NASP), BCL2-associated athanogene 3 (BAG3), and 14-3-3 protein Tau (YWHAQ) were validated as novel PKA substrates.

Despite its importance, communication is often complex, in particular in older patients (aged 65 years or older). In addition to the age-related deterioration in information and memory processing older patients experience, communication is also complicated by their required yet often unmet role of being an active, participatory patient. Older patients rarely express their informational needs and their contributions to consultations are often limited. Therefore, older patients with cancer need to be prepared to participate more actively in their care and treatment.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nThe objective of this paper was to report the development of PatientVOICE, an online, preparatory tool with audio facility aimed to enhance the participation of older patients during educational nursing encounters preceding chemotherapy and to improve their information recall.\n\n\nMETHODS\nPatientVOICE was developed by applying the following 6 steps of the intervention mapping framework that involved both patients and nurses: (1) needs assessment, (2) specifying determinants and change objectives, (3) reviewing and selecting theoretical methods and practical strategies, (4) developing intervention components, (5) designing adoption and implementation, and (6) making an evaluation plan.\n\n\nRESULTS\nA careful execution of these consecutive steps resulted in the ready-to-use preparatory website. PatientVOICE provides pre-visit information about chemotherapy (ie, medical information, side effects, and recommendations of dealing with side effects), information about the educational nursing visit preceding chemotherapy (ie, aim, structure, and recommendations for preparation), techniques to improve patients' communication skills using a question prompt sheet (QPS) and video-modeling examples showing \"best practices\", and the opportunity to upload and listen back to an audio recording of a patient's own nursing visit.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe development process resulted in PatientVOICE, a multi-component online intervention targeted to older patients with cancer. PatientVOICE contains information about the treatment as well as information about the role of the patient during treatment. Using different methods (QPS and audio facility), we hope to support these patients during their treatment. In the future, the utility and usability of this complex intervention will be evaluated in a group of older patients who receive or have received chemotherapy.","inCitations":["dad4fe42c777599f5cedc70622d10ed21b1a4a04","958177d5dd56f1f3123ccd209ae471076de4d334","3af906c48b3572d454ffe502f1e282669bcf451b","c1bf67ff40e2be47d2ce6468a7ba01a3198de591"],"pdfUrls":["https://pure.uva.nl/ws/files/16230983/PatientVOICE.pdf","https://repository.ubn.ru.nl/bitstream/handle/2066/175775/175775.pdf?sequence=1","http://repository.ubn.ru.nl/bitstream/handle/2066/175775/175775.pdf?sequence=1","https://asset.jmir.pub/assets/2126ad6df9661965c09b7c3718242add.pdf"],"title":"PatientVOICE: Development of a Preparatory, Pre-Chemotherapy Online Communication Tool for Older Patients With Cancer","doi":"10.2196/resprot.6979","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.2196/resprot.6979","venue":"JMIR research protocols"}

Although the emerging new aesthetic devices for home use offer significantly more benefit than home-use products available earlier because they will be based on technology developed for professional aesthetic practitioners, they will nonetheless not compete directly with professional treatments. Home devices are expected to address a different need than professional services. The home aesthetic device market is either extremely large or quite small, depending on how it is defined. This type of differentiation has also been observed in the relatively recent introduction of home microdermabrasion kits, which appeal in large part to consumers who purchase drug-store cosmetics, and are highly price sensitive. The new generation of home-use devices incorporates advanced technologies such as phototherapy, radio frequency (RF), ultrasound, and so on, and therefore requires FDA clearance to market, supported by rigorous clinical studies demonstrating the safety and efficacy in the intended application. Radiancy, a leader in the professional aesthetic device market, manufactures equipment that delivers Light-Heat Energy (LHE), a proprietary technology utilizing thermal energy (heat), as well as photothermolysis to achieve the intended effects. In the home-device market, Radiancy was an early pioneer with the introduction of its No!No! hair-removal device.","inCitations":["5be6d488901d1d5e1f9b5a951f64ff40d00dd458"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Light-Based Devices for At-Home Use","doi":"10.1016/B978-0-8155-1572-2.50030-0","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-8155-1572-2.50030-0","venue":""}

Through the contrastive analysis on topological structures, control complexity and working efficiencies of different power converters, it is determined to use the Sepic converter as the topology for the DC/DC converter due to its smaller numbers of switching components and relatively simple driving control and modulation method, and the maximum power point tracking(MPPT) of the modules is ensured by the rise and fall of the control voltage. In allusion to the MPPT control of DC/DC power converter, a dual closed-loop control strategy, in which the voltage outer-loop and the current inner-loop are used, is proposed. Based on the analysis on small signal model of the control system, the design of the control system is implemented. Finally, the effectiveness of the dual closed-loop control is validated by simulation results.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"A Sepic Converter Based Modular Maximum Power Point Tracking Strategy","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

For this purpose, oocytes maturity and ovarian histology as well as Cd, Zn and metallothioneins (MTs) accumulation and expression of genes encoding Zrt-,Irt-related protein 10 (ZIP10), Zn transporter 1 (ZnT1) and zebrafish metallothionein (zMT) were examined in ovaries of adult zebrafish exposed to 0.4 mg/L Cd in water and supplemented with Zn (5 mgkg(-1)) in their diet for 21 days. Cd-exposure decreased the expression of ZnT1 and caused up-regulation of ZIP10 and zMT gene expression. These changes were accompanied by increased Cd and MTs accumulation, decreased Zn contents as well as by histopathological damages in ovarian tissues. The co-exposure of fish to Cd and Zn abolished ZnT1 down-regulation and rendered a persistently increased ZIP10 mRNA level. This treatment also decreased Cd and MTs accumulation, reversed Cd-induced Zn depletion and partially restored Cd-induced histological changes in ovarian tissues. These results imply that the downregulation of ZnT1 as well as the overexpression of ZIP10, in responses to the ovarian Zn depletion induced by Cd, play a major role in Cd accumulation and consequently in its toxicity. The protective effect of dietary Zn supplementation against Cd-induced toxicity is mediated, at least in part, by the increase of Zn availability and subsequently the induction of ZnT1 gene expression.","inCitations":["ed2ff017765e69454766edfb62c64d78170a167c","0b8ed3dcc0c1f74d663f5d494616b4fe84b4990a","155e59913210bc8d966f08835d43944fa591eed8","22c5514bbd5275ddbbca6e137cf5d1196392e35b","e366517fb15cf202bebd91d0e64db55a3e67df2a","9073416e5da67bd25cc7a535a8d3079baa41a184","a5b83bc7e85c6ce62fdcc2ad9d093a920f3abff3","fae9ece56c6706bcc528bbbcc261baaa791f26e6","f4a68d2a768d37482288e7e14b502d6fdcf0ee9e","24e331dfcf7831f85c875f46dfababd94bc6c699","58ad7031f85d6f896dee810bc158d7baafba27ec","be6fe5bac08dd749149d75a9ae3a5d5a54144b08","4c8dc9ac8cae08e27c063fac159fc469ef682264","eb809c2298264a6878d145e3248a576e3bf9323d","8959df1361af794337db2c44a7d1e80ed225efc0","a7e207382a5c2e2dbb2f914bef3e0e3573beefaa","a8b83a72536ce36e8aebeb88f67ccb060a3d22c5","35adc4992187b62b46bbdf25ca24d0d14e6bd951"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Cadmium-induced ovarian pathophysiology is mediated by change in gene expression pattern of zinc transporters in zebrafish (Danio rerio).","doi":"10.1016/j.cbi.2011.06.010","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cbi.2011.06.010","venue":"Chemico-biological interactions"}

Characterized by high field 1H- and 13C-n.m.r. spectroscopy, the polymers exhibited chemical shift variations in general accord with shielding differences expected on removal of sulfate substituents, and additional variations that probably arose from conformational changes in the polymers. Whereas the anticoagulant activity of heparins, as measured by USP, anti-Xa, and thrombin-time assays, was invariably reduced by the chemical transformations effected, the ability of heparin to bind calcium ions was found to be dependent on retention of the 2-sulfamino group, whether or not O-sulfate groups were present. The results suggest that the 2-sulfamino group is essential for maintaining a molecular conformation consistent with the ability for the L-iduronic acid residues to complex with calcium ions. Also, they show that although the anticoagulant and calcium-binding properties of heparin may be interdependent, they are not determined by the same structural entities in the polymer.","inCitations":["883b6d07938c799ef1e4e63e932a3908263c8244","a8e70634c3cb61824c2e500d398366fe4af48b8b","4f19880ccde7b9c5c7113edf91a28c57bd14c4df","3eef2e6dc539a422b9d9ba64dfc97712650a4512","3f2d8859c93cf4596bf7490309c12a2911bcfb5a"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"N.m.r. spectroscopic observations related to the function of sulfate groups in heparin.

Previous works to unravel the complex interrelationship between pain and insomnia have not explored the role of inflexible beliefs about the sleep-pain interaction, possibly due to a lack of a valid instrument for doing so. The current study evaluated the psychometric and functional properties of a 10-item Pain-Related Beliefs and Attitudes about Sleep (PBAS) scale.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThe PBAS scale was administered to four clinical samples of chronic pain patients with comorbid insomnia: to examine the scale's psychometric properties (n = 137), test-retest reliability (n = 26), sensitivity to treatment (n = 20), and generalizability (n = 62). All participants completed the PBAS together with validated measures of pain interference, insomnia severity, and cognitive-behavioral processes hypothesized to underpin insomnia.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe PBAS scale was found to be reliable, with adequate internal consistency and temporal stability. Factor analysis suggested a 2-factor solution representing beliefs about \"pain as the primary cause of insomnia\" and the \"inevitable consequences of insomnia on pain and coping.\" The PBAS total score was positively correlated with scores from the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) scale, Dysfunctional Beliefs and Attitudes about Sleep (DBAS) scale, and the Anxiety and Preoccupation about Sleep Questionnaire (APSQ). It was a significant predictor of insomnia severity and pain interference. A significant reduction in PBAS was also observed in patients after receiving a hybrid cognitive-behavioral intervention for both pain and insomnia.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nPain-related sleep beliefs appear to be an integral part of chronic pain patients' insomnia experience. The PBAS is a valid and reliable instrument for evaluating the role of these beliefs in chronic pain patients.","inCitations":["f92a51afbd374642e69b8f34be6a3a62be2ea2bc","3fb315e60a201d24214d482121e48224ee0e1c30","4f0f2824bf0542b593a442b68522c3696b6d9469","7a5095183b1a8c9c2e508d310e605aa889cdebb0","c97e48e5721da020489b506fa0eb9f2bc4bb91e6"],"pdfUrls":["http://jcsm.aasm.org/Articles/jcsm.12.9.1269.pdf"],"title":"Development of the Pain-Related Beliefs and Attitudes about Sleep (PBAS) Scale for the Assessment and Treatment of Insomnia Comorbid with Chronic Pain.","doi":"10.5664/jcsm.6130","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.5664/jcsm.6130","venue":"Journal of clinical sleep medicine : JCSM : official publication of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine"}

The first part of this two-paper series proposes a scenario-based stochastic model for the multistage joint reinforcement planning of the distribution systems and the electric vehicle charging stations (EVCSs). The historical EV charging demand is first determined using the Markovian analysis of EV driving patterns and charging demand. A scenario matrix, based on the heuristic moment matching method, is then generated to characterize the stochastic features and correlation among historical wind and photovoltaic generation, and conventional loads and EV demands. The scenario matrix is then utilized to formulate the expansion planning framework, aiming at the minimization of the investment and operational costs. The proposed expansion plan determines the optimal construction/reinforcement of substations, EVCSs, and feeders, in addition to the placement of wind and photovoltaic generators, and capacitor banks over the multi-stage planning horizon. In the second companion paper, the effectiveness and scalability of the proposed model is assessed through case studies in the 18-bus and the IEEE 123-bus distribution systems, respectively.","inCitations":["6894aeb495af7516efa30f1d3db1289074fc2295"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Active Distribution System Reinforcement Planning With EV Charging Stations—Part I: Uncertainty Modeling and Problem Formulation","doi":"10.1109/TSTE.2019.2915338","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSTE.2019.2915338","venue":"IEEE Transactions on Sustainable Energy"}

This paper presents a report on the work of the National Commission on Intermodal Transportation by Commission Member Thomas J. Donohue, President and CEO of American Trucking Associations, Inc. Mr. Donohue comments on the commission's report and recent political and market realities that contradict or support it, and on the conference presentations. He notes, in particular, the following four recommendations: support for the National Highway System and intermodal connectors (roads that connect to a rail, air, or water terminal); coordination between transportation, environmental, and related health and regulatory policies; the application of new technology for processing freight across the United States-Mexico and United States-Canada international borders; and changes in the rules that govern federal and state procurement processes for transportation.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"National Conference on Intermodalism: Making the Case, Making It Happen, New Orleans, Louisiana, December 7-9, 1994.

Numerical simulations are carried out on a Hele Shaw cell which consists of a representative unit element of a two dimensional spatially periodic flat plate with pores. The particle concentration in the fluid is assumed to be low so that particles enter one by one into the computation domain. Particles follow the flow streamlines under creeping flow conditions from a random initial location until they are subjected to physico‐chemical interactions near the filter surface or a particle already deposited. The computational domain consists of two regions: a fluid region and a porous medium region, i.e. the particle cake. The flow over the two regions of the Hele Shaw cell is computed using the Darcy model, including the variations of the permeability field due to the cake formation.

Inclusion criteria included diagnosis of hemangioma requiring propranolol of ≥0.3 mg/kg/dose, age <2 years, and heart rate (HR) monitoring for ≥1 hour. Data collected included demographics, dose, vital signs and adverse events.\n\n\nRESULTS\n783 subjects met inclusion criteria; median age at initiation was 112 days. None of the 1148 episodes of prolonged monitoring warranted immediate intervention or drug discontinuation. No symptomatic bradycardia or hypotension occurred during monitoring. Mean HR change from baseline to 1 hour was -8.19 +/- 15.54 and baseline to 2 hours was -9.24 +/- 15.84 bpm. Three preterm subjects had dose adjustments due to prescriber concerns about asymptomatic vital sign changes. No significant difference existed in pre-treatment HR or in HR change between those with later adverse events during treatment and those without.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nProlonged monitoring for initiation and escalation of oral propranolol rarely changed management and did not predict future adverse events. Few serious adverse events occurred during therapy; none were cardiovascular.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Limited Utility of Repeated Vital Sign Monitoring During Initiation of Oral Propranolol for Complicated Infantile Hemangioma.","doi":"10.1016/j.jaad.2020.04.013","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaad.2020.04.013","venue":"Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology"}

Blastogenic response of normal rat spleen cells to amphiphilic and hydrophilic components of Triton X-114 solubilized epimastigote forms of T. lewisi which characterizes the early phase of infection showed that suppression of responses to mitogens Concanavalin A (Con-A) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) occurred exclusively with the amphiphilic fraction that consists of integral surface membrane constituents. The Con-A-induced suppression by the amphiphilic constituents was ablated by addition of exogenous IL-2 or by the removal of the adherent cell population in the cultures. This suggests that the integral surface membrane components play an important regulatory role in infections with Trypanosoma lewisi, through complex mechanisms that probably involve the B cells and suppressor macrophages; the suppressor macrophages probably produce a suppressor factor that inhibits the proliferation of T helper cells and subsequently the production of interleukin-2.","inCitations":["caebd22549dcd86cad8ab784827c4e71b48e4d12"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Cellular responses to phase fractions of Trypanosoma lewisi.","doi":"10.1111/j.1365-3024.1992.tb00002.x","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-3024.1992.tb00002.x","venue":"Parasite immunology"}

The SSc-like traits in Tsk2/+ heterozygotes are highly penetrant. With their readily apparent skin fibrosis resulting from ECM anomalies, Tsk2/+ mice have signs that resemble human SSc features, making it useful as a pre-clinical model. In this report, we show a clear time dependence on the gene expression in the skin of the Tsk2/+ mice. We have pinpointed a mutation in Col3a1 that is the Tsk2 gene, and have confirmed the sequence difference between Tsk2/+ and the parent strain, 101/H. We present results on the expression of TGFbeta mRNA from cells cultured from Tsk2/+ and WT littermates that suggest a mechanism for the up-regulation of TGFbeta seen in the mutant strain. We show that elastin content in the skin, known to be controlled by TGFbeta and possibly up-egulated in SSc, is the earliest indicator of tight-skin in the tissue. Finally, we show that Tsk2/+ mice, and mouse fibroblasts transfected with Col3a1 from Tsk2/+, share a substantial fibrotic gene expression program compared to WT mice or transfectants, indicating that expression of the Col3a1Tsk2 gene alone accounts for the trait in Tsk2/+ mice.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://apps.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a593290.pdf","https://apps.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a569607.pdf","http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a569137.pdf","http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a589919.pdf"],"title":"Identification of the Gene for Scleroderma in the Tsk/2 Mouse Strain: Implications for Human Scleroderma Pathogenesis and Subset Distinctions","doi":"10.21236/ada613588","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.21236/ada613588","venue":""}

Methods The core authors, coauthors and their organizations whose articles were published in Chinese Journal of Orthopaedics between 1995 and 2004 were quantitatively analyzed using literature search through CMCI, which programmed by the People's Liberation Army Medical Library and their geographical regions distribution, the organizations of whom had high quantitative publication were determined using literature metrology methods. Results There were 2660 articles published in Chinese Journal of Orthopaedics between 1995 and 2004. All of 1123 authors of 2660 articles had only one article published which accounted for 69.67% of total first authors on the Chinese Journal of Orthopaedics in ten years. There were 2385 articles with one or more coauthors and the cooperative rate was 89.66%, and cooperative degree was 4.11 in the period of time. There were 275 articles with single author, which accounted for 10.34% of total articles. The articles written by the authors from military hospitals, university affiliated hospitals and provinces-level hospitals were 646(24.28%), 1091(41.01%) and 706(26.54%), respectively during the period. There were 218 core authors with 959(36.05%) articles published and there were 20 high-quantities organizations with 1007(37.86%) articles published in this study. The number one region of published articles was Beijing with 667(25.08%) articles. There were 2443 (91.84%) articles pressed from the organizations of affiliated hospitals of universities, provinces-level hospitals and army hospitals. Among them, Tianjin hospital (101 articles), Beijing Jishuitan hospital (100 articles) and affiliated Xijing hospital of the 4th military medical mniversity (79 articles) occupied 10.53% of the pressed papers and they were in the first three positions. Conclusion Authors of Chinese Journal of Orthopaedics have a wide distribution and highly cooperative rate. There were a group of active and talented core authors who has a great influence on the journal.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Analysis of articles and core authors in Chinese Journal of Orthopaedics from 1995 to 2004","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Common variant alleles situated both in the promoter and structural region of the human MBL gene (MBL2) influence the stability and the serum concentration of the protein. Epidemiological studies have suggested that genetically determined variation in MBL serum concentration influences the susceptibility to and the course of different types of infections, autoimmune, metabolic and cardiovascular diseases, but this is still a subject of debate.

Bei guter Methodik liefert sie eine Reihe von hochinteressanten Befunden über den Zusammenhang zwischen körperlicher Aktivität und Schlafapnoe. Zum einen konnte sie klar zeigen, dass ein 4-wöchiges körperliches Training von sehr bescheidenem Ausmaß zu einer signikanten Verminderung des AHI bei Patienten mit koronarer Herzkrankheit führt. Diese Verminderung des AHI war begleitet von einer geringeren Flüssigkeitsverschiebung von den Beinen in die Zirkulation während der Nacht. Die regelmäßige Muskelkontraktion tagsüber verhinderte oensichtlich eine vermehrte Wassereinlagerung in den Beinen, sodass in der Nacht weniger Flüssigkeit vorhanden war, die zurückströmen konnte. Damit bestand auch eine geringere Möglichkeit, dass diese Flüssigkeit sich in der horizontalen Lage in den Bereich des Halses verlagerte und dort tendenziell zu einer erhöhten Obstruktion der Luftwege führte. Diese Mechanismen greifen bereits nach kurzer Zeit und haben nichts mit der körperlichen Fitness oder dem Körpergewicht zu tun. Insofern weist die Studie einen einfachen und praktikablen, dabei sehr eektiven Weg der Behandlung des OSAS ohne Apparate auf. Tatsächlich handelt es sich um die erste randomisierte Studie, die den Eekt eines systematischen Trainings auf die Schlafapnoe bei KHK-Patienten untersucht. Möglicherweise ist der günstige Eekt einer fehlenden nächtlichen Flüssigkeitsverschiebung zumindest teilweise auch mit Kompressionsstrümpfen zu erzielen. Das würde bedeuten, dass auch weniger mobile Patienten mit Gelenkbeschwerden von dieser Idee protieren könnten. Prof. Dr. med. Hermann S.

The three solutions shown all use the RANS approach to predict mean flow fields. The major differences appear to be related to the use of the standard , the MMK and the RNG turbulence models. The inlet conditions chosen by the three modellers illustrate one of the dilemmas faced in computational wind engineering. While all modeller matched the inlet velocity profile to the full-scale profile, only one of the modellers chose to match the full-scale turbulence data. This approach led to a boundary layer that was not in equilibrium. The approach taken by the other modeller was to specify lower inlet turbulent kinetic energy level, which are more consistent with the turbulence models chosen and lead to a homogeneous boundary layer. For the case, wind normal to one face of the cube, it is shown that the RNG solution is closest to the full-scale data. This result appears to be associated with the RNG solution showing the correct flow separation and reattachment on the roof. The other solutions show either excessive separation (MMK) or no separation at all (K-E). For the case the three solutions are fairly similar. None of them correctly predicting the high suctions along the windward edges of the roof. In general the velocity components are more accurately predicted than the pressures. However in all cases the turbulence levels are poorly matched, with all of the solutions failing to match the high turbulence levels measured around the edges of separated flows. Although all of the computational solutions have deficiencies, the variability of results is shown to be similar to that which has been obtained with a similar comparative wind tunnel study. This suggests that the computational solutions are only slightly less reliable than the wind tunnel.","inCitations":["c454c4b6e25df82e135d4076aa233e52208f1668","80355cccb87e2446f8ac9131fd2b2b1f2d7fed77","b9f3828d523c464c339366ccc3d6d04be029a6f2","a1291e8cb953644f8f777cfc827965b439a6281c","8d9fd332648c0f998b4743cc92a5474f492127b3","2213385c7cd944b4ba584b8580afa912cd215779","9ea35a4bf05998de1b1f0707f5d4bf95d0663b2a","3b5aadb4dfba4647b5ebfd9298becd8deaeadff2","b6c5037187e49500c929b262af448a82a32c9b70","9e898abf3ff26c7ea2eebb622df1d3929bcf2676","4e031a548127f94ee017df397d82f9a7e70dfe13","e53cb310701431929259421f3b409768204d6178","6430f968c9f47c4a83101ed2febc4fcdd00cd220","28ccbcec1d9d7fca25f664643e6e5a148c66fff8","c15187c1fdcb584b40fd790ca75183c1ce70948e","92e013adedfe71879be269d5fcc050033d7cc74f","d84f051514a4f7acc5003a555304e3132c542b77","e7948a8bb2de419cd5920a13163b6212f503b962","7eb779a5e0265649669c805fe58e546f28355ac9","5d3ec55286b39846a0b35b6ab487d79adc03cf3a","0cb0b703679b9cb6859ff6bbfbd0eaf3d78b1fd5","119f52cd673b02da9412f46159c83584d081fad6","6a8c457aa90fa3003a4b83a28910a1e212984650"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"A 6 m cube in an atmospheric boundary layer flow -Part 2.

The associated mass dimension 8 coefficients for Lorentz violation studied do not result in any linearized gravity modifications and instead are revealed in the first nonlinear terms in an expansion of spacetime around a flat background. We consider effects on gravitational radiation through the energy loss of a binary system and we study two-body orbital perturbations using the post-Newtonian metric. Some effects depend on the internal structure of the source and test bodies, thereby breaking the Weak Equivalence Principle for self-gravitating bodies. These coefficients can be measured in solar-system tests, while binary-pulsar systems and short-range gravity tests are particularly sensitive.","inCitations":["a5b32dcc4ff44bb98aefabf39343eacdf595cf9b","2a9ed6df3971d509c74574b8747ae9b3edfdcba9","9348ea7090c85b87a730ccd57592c6b8fd9792d7"],"pdfUrls":["https://commons.erau.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1692&context=publication","https://arxiv.org/pdf/1608.00267v1.pdf"],"title":"Anisotropic cubic curvature couplings","doi":"10.1103/PhysRevD.94.065029","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevD.94.065029","venue":""}

Methods Sixteen white rabbits underwent unilateral anterior cruciate ligament transection and were divided into 2 groups randomly 5 weeks after transection. Experimental group rabbits received 0.3 ml of intra-articular 1% HA injection once a week. Animals in control group were treated under the same condition using saline. At death, 10 weeks following surgery, histological changes of articular cartilage of medial femoral condyle were evaluated by microscopy. The mRNA expression of MMP-1, MMP-3 and TIMP-1 in cartilage and synovium was analyzed using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) . Results Cartilage degradation in experimental group was significantly less severe than that in the control group. The expression of MMP-3 mRNA in synovium was significantly suppressed in experimental group compared with the control group (0.40±0.10 vs 0.62±0.13). HA treatment had no effect on MMP-3 expression in cartilage. No significant difference of MMP-1 and TIMP-1 expression in cartilage and synovium was found between experimental group and control group. Conclusion HA can alleviate the degeneration of articular cartilage of OA. One possible mechanism of the therapeutic effect of HA may be inhibition of expression of MMP-3 in synovium during early stage of OA.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"The effects of sodium hyaluronate on matrix metalloproteinase-1, -3 and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 mRNA expression in cartilage and synovium of osteoarthritis rabbits","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

In this study, we demonstrated the use of portable miniature near-infrared (MicroNIR) spectrometers for NIR-based pharmaceutical RMID and solved two challenges in this area, model transferability and large-scale classification, with the aid of support vector machine (SVM) modeling. We used a set of 19 pharmaceutical compounds including various active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) and excipients and six MicroNIR spectrometers to test model transferability. For the test of large-scale classification, we used another set of 253 pharmaceutical compounds comprised of both chemically and physically different APIs and excipients. We compared SVM with conventional chemometric modeling techniques, including soft independent modeling of class analogy, partial least squares discriminant analysis, linear discriminant analysis, and quadratic discriminant analysis. Support vector machine modeling using a linear kernel, especially when combined with a hierarchical scheme, exhibited excellent performance in both model transferability and large-scale classification. Hence, ultra-compact, portable and robust MicroNIR spectrometers coupled with SVM modeling can make on-site and in situ pharmaceutical RMID for large-volume applications highly achievable.","inCitations":["4d7cfb3a96eb65b017d5d8efb30aa5043a8aa97d","35dbcde68b99cfd9dbe91b83c5e11046ad22430c","1d1f4bb7e753c03e0496a3c304ef63fa9c028ea5","95ef49bf4915dcc4b5396a488da22dec143e6a28","a635c9fb94d667694a90e99d1de28e701618de02"],"pdfUrls":["https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/pmc/oa_pdf/2a/5f/10.1177_0003702816638281.PMC4871175.pdf","https://www.viavisolutions.com/fr-fr/literature/pharmaceutical-rmid-using-miniature-near-infrared-micronir-spectroscopy-articles-en.pdf"],"title":"Pharmaceutical Raw Material Identification Using Miniature Near-Infrared (MicroNIR) Spectroscopy and Supervised Pattern Recognition Using Support Vector Machine","doi":"10.1177/0003702816638281","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1177/0003702816638281","venue":"Applied spectroscopy"}

The size of the casks (5.2 m in height and 2.4 m in diameter), structural complexity and the inability to access the interior make this a challenging task. This project addresses these difficulties through a multi-modal approach involving nuclear, charged particle and acoustic methods. In this work, we report on measurements of the vibrational spectra and mode shapes using a 6:1 scaled TN-32 model cask constructed in our lab. 2-D vibrometric scans were performed with a laser Doppler velocimeter to measure the vibrational mode shapes exhibited by the cask. Good agreement is observed between the experimentally measured mode shapes and those determined numerically using a detailed finite element model.

The compound crystallizes in the cubic space group P43m (T/sub d//sup 1/, No. 215) with a unit cell of dimensions a = 5.827 (4) angstrom. Full-matrix least-squares refinement gave a final value of R(F/sub 0//sup 2/) = 0.103 for 71 unique reflections with F/sub 0//sup 2/ > sigma(F/sub 0//sup 2/). The molecular structure consists of monomeric Hf(BH/sub 4/)/sub 4/ units having rigorously T/sub d/ symmetry and tridentate tetrahydroborate coordination. Important bond distances are Hf-B = 2.281 (8) angstrom, Hf-H(bridging) = 2.130 (9) angstrom, B-H(bridging) = 1.235 (10) angstrom, and B-H(terminal) = 1.150 (19) angstrom. Important bond angles are Hf-H(bridging)-B = 80.6 (6)/sup 0/, H(bridging)-B-H(bridging) = 105.8 (6)/sup 0/, and H(bridging)-B-H(terminal) = 112.9 (10)/sup 0/.

Using a within-teacher design, the eighth-grade teachers’ social studies classes were randomly assigned to treatment or comparison conditions. Teachers (n = 5) taught the same instructional content to both treatment and comparison classes, but the treatment classes used instructional practices focused on teaching essential words, text as a source for reading and discussion, and team-based learning approaches. Students in the treatment conditions (n = 261) scored statistically higher than students in the comparison conditions (n = 158) on all three outcomes: content acquisition (ES = 0.17), content reading comprehension (ES = 0.29), and standardized reading comprehension (ES = 0.20). Findings are interpreted as demonstrating support for the treatment in improving both knowledge acquisition and reading comprehension within content area instruction.","inCitations":["57ba2e3f9cdeef69e3cee88cba06b9c999e0ac44","39f915aa439701846315edab742aa865b4e9d880","3a259eab1c54cf69254455af42eef232dc388f15","ff79d6207731a2eee53cb72c701b4d4d115857c8","25a3ceff78efc78287a57aedbb9ebb731f19edb8","406672c296ec574ecfe1aacaa8ada73d77bc73f3","173d537ff0729fe31bd260c4c5e95648628e4784","88dfae9d6d8f6ae994a3653869ae73906b3ac854","989d4164f7c827458468123b05ef2e6674969d0d","586913fc2726455acda6e3606791610beba1142c","85f60840c0a790162f015b6e1bc3080ffaf34f4d","85c045740fbaf7fa6bd3e5683a3a1b600af559a4","c6b21bb01c2e1312336310df77ce3ceae88abccd","8a32d31848c0de83c2139d766221453b8672152f","d4b38569cb6d4407ab07bf549aa348571c9b34bb","ca81cd351a540723dce459f419c3367cd3150fe7","8e64e1f26fbdc20c492e0df66587ebe4acad62ed","773efa851e40df2da994d626afb3530dd46b685e","2160a33f265de24a62dd190b2a4f493f61dd2e27","ce4ec980adfc4bec0717c0d7cb7d3c4ed1604908","60208bfb6f2e63c45de0066bfa7889b18b4d5ba1","03dff947d7967a3bc5c9581ecd2e20d1688023e8","a8361add8c1138897aff808becd4a1d13eb0acc7","b5a91477297051e30a98ce637acaaa6da5259f4b","1825ca0095bee9cfafa725508120266386b7d28b","3e4917d5cd6ad7b9bb8fc8e74777185e3eec041c","ce9c0c4b60e59551eac5ec7034190bcb43251f1d","6a44c1916cd86ba9835232c7f37706bfbd8035de","86c60248def0c18b5c03973928acf1734ff8bdda","7bde6afd3df28b1f73a60a6611db72155bdffbbf","ff930cc6f0c0b5eba74dc2118f1011f20e1a24ff","f3693157b65276ce6a15384891beef69d6c42964","ebb2bd6d3a6a344bbef54036efadbb6b5236686e","08f93d494c20e1d4ddee74776b07c94c19ae7297","48da2ea54b846d996535c73ce9ef05b173dc5f1b","a7537373ace2096ad36e7f7e8424ed7215d55921","14850cfaea91a5f7a27903a5595b091d0907fc90","947326ab364ce9d8e02d4b78b10d6081d8e9161e","0a674d82e17ec879b74b944c58ace8a231361822","357858c44c9b9a58496f15c250bc6f3c18c56d0e","5ba42c7b9b6c4d09d476571bc51d65c58dab9dde","b0b2c763af852f88dfbda6fa63dc974696341312","00643c195fe431d02c1ce3acfdfdf99837df83d8","95754aa2a0aa27d7e997cb5a48eaa966298fbeeb","713d07ed44194abfe58e6b800c1eac6151be5886","ef9a77858fe202bd5ae558559516a17bf9a9b90a","8f914ad526a760c50e967740d728e944ea6d3d37","3662fb9be1729149b03b12562fac29448348ce77","1dc72546998bc2f5a20f0ff62cb4f45bdccd88e6","f62aa9e47f35701290beb6c798ef056cdb450eda","8698ff60c0470075c719d3f3055f951a07b0c708","82a7994d241001bf170202eb24c419caab0a6583","028d372bdab142e319f67c758eeb5c8ec227a963","afcc0aeb249ae40f9a6832f7d232b5d8f2202c20","3024704532f97ff0a0a0ee9bf2010fc5aa2e9032","4139f04dcf67d4f66ee0977e5fac4d4782fe18b9","83f9af1184ccfee6bb85203aee64efe3641bbf83","7b9bf804e66dda76a363b88544bf8112b6c770e5","0fb96bf2db003884a089293c806887c188523eb4","bcd8e9890290c8758582b383cba4e4ea9f6c2080","2b5889a39a1edc48df9e5c31a395acdfb40379d2","b18b445490569497a8a5152c7b306c42c8264abe","81ccf2912ebffb80360ee043615867e4b14306f1","1cdf245657571892514ccd672763476b979ba3ae","fef5b048586bf511fac7abf9b5e9a962401bd636","4b3dbb7397341b37da98b637bf50e41e45b9284f","0789838683fe12768263002fc8467fb1cd3d64f1"],"pdfUrls":["https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED544200.pdf"],"title":"Improving Reading Comprehension and Social Studies Knowledge in Middle School.","doi":"10.1002/rrq.039","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1002/rrq.039","venue":""}

A further goal was to explore the impact on smartphone addiction of several variables related to smartphone use habits, perceived quality of life, and sociability measures. The data were collected online from 205 Italian-speaking volunteers (128 males and 77 females aged 18 to 99 years). The psychometric instruments included in the study were the SABAS and the Nomophobia Questionnaire (NMP-Q). Psychometric testing showed that the six items included in the SABAS comprised a unidimensional factor with good reliability (Cronbach’s alpha = .890). Therefore, the SABAS appears to be a reliable instrument to assess the risk of addiction to smartphone apps. Moreover, longer daily time spent using the smartphone was found to be positively correlated with the total SABAS and NMP-Q scores, while perceived quality of life and self-reported sociability were found to be negatively correlated with such scores.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Psychometric Properties of the Italian Version of the Smartphone Application-Based Addiction Scale (SABAS)","doi":"10.1007/s11469-020-00222-2","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11469-020-00222-2","venue":"International Journal of Mental Health and Addiction"}
