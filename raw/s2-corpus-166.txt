The prevalence rate of nightmares was 41% and 5% experienced nightmares once a week or more often. In the present sample, girls' nightmare frequency exceeded that of boys. The results indicate that parasomnias such as nightmares, night terrors and sleepwalking often occurred together. With regard to personality, the findings support previous studies in adolescents and adults which have shown a relationship between “thin boundaries” and nightmare frequency. As expected, the occurrence of stressors (school problems, parental divorce) affected nightmare frequency. However, correlations were small and inconsistent, so that future studies should be performed to elicit the temporal pattern of stress and nightmares.ZusammenfassungDie vorliegende Studie untersuchte den Zusammenhang zwischen Alptraumhäufigkeit und Schlaf und Wachverhalten von Kindern zwischen 6 und 11 Jahren. Die Prävalenzrate von Alpträumen betrug 41% und 5% der Kinder erlebten Alpträume einmal pro Woche oder häufiger. In der vorliegenden Stichprobe wurde für Mädchen eine höhere Alptraumrate angegeben als für Jungen. Die Ergebnisse legen nahe, dass Parasomnien wie Alpträume, Pavor nocturnus und Schlafwandeln häufig zusammen auftreten. In Bezug auf die Persönlichkeit sind die Ergebnisse in Einklang mit früheren Studien bei Jugendlichen und Erwachsenen, die einen Zusammenhang zwischen, ‘dünnen’ Grenzen und Alptraumhäufigkeit nachweisen konnten. Wie erwartet, beeinflusste das Auftreten von Stressoren (Schulprobleme, elterliche Scheidung) die Alptraumhäufigkeit. Die Korrelationskoeflizienten waren jedoch niedrig und nicht konsistent, so dass zukünftige Studien das zeitliche Muster des stressvorkommens und der Alpträume erfassen sollten.","inCitations":["d7585818e1ffc5f34c8627003c8f7809a81d50ce","4f78a63774698987ffa6c190256b8bf3af80023b","644a462cc8ca942fce74b160c9f116985b1814e4","7a49b838c255af093aff953f7e1e7ce71ea9d004","ca112ef14977fb3024e58256d60fa4a1d0c22d77","c7baefe20b49ffa096ffe9ea4753cfb796489893","bd1f63510231ea2f376716959cdbbe8f6ba0fadb","d9edea43d98afbee88b7bbd492f6c27f9712d15a"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Nightmares in children: Influencing factors","doi":"10.1007/s11818-000-0007-z","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11818-000-0007-z","venue":""}

An evidence of this is the concentration of cotinine (a product of the metabolism of nicotine) in lactants and non smokers. The exposition to the ETS disturbs the non-smoker, provokes a reduction of weight in the new-born of a smoker mother and increases perinatal complications, as well as it increases the incidence of bronchitis and pneumonia in smoker’s children and most of all induces a greater risk of symptoms and respiratory infections, asthma and otitis. The adult passive smoker has more risk of cardiovascular disease and cancer and worse coronary diseases, asthma and Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease.

G2 and G3 animals were vaccinated on day zero, and received a booster and two revaccinations on days 30, 210 and 390 and G1 animals received phosphate buffered saline. Serum samples were collected at 15-day intervals between days 0 and 60; and at 30-day intervals between days 60 and 540 and were tested by MAT and GIT with serovars Hardjo and Wolffi. G1 remained negative throughout the experiment. Both vaccines were able to induce agglutinating and growth inhibition antibodies. Six months after the last revaccination, all animals tested negative by MAT, but still were positive by GIT until the end of experimental period.

Sintering infiltrated bodies at a low temperature of 1300 °C yielded specimens in which silicon carbide, mullite and cristobalite were detected. Depending on the porosity of the starting SiC body, the porosity of the final ceramic could be varied in the range of 36–49 vol.% with a variation of flexural strength from 19 to 33 MPa. The average pore diameter (∼8 μm) was found to be almost independent of porosity.","inCitations":["15b641069e651a2aeb3da4c344333878141fb343"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Incorporation of mullite as a bond phase into porous SiC by an infiltration technique","doi":"10.1016/j.msea.2011.12.070","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.msea.2011.12.070","venue":""}

Molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) nanosheet could be well dispersed on the BCTM to form porous structure, while the BCTM can enhance the conductivity of MoS2 nanosheet. The synergistic effects between the MoS2 nanosheet and BCTM contribute to high hydrogen evolution reaction activity. MoS2/BCTM shows admirable catalytic ability with a low overpotential of 176 mV at 10 mA cm−2, a small Tafel slope 51 mV·dec−1, and outstanding stability over 2000 cycles under acidic conditions.

Reforming of biogas to hydrogen rich gas offers a green source of energy. This work demonstrates reforming biogas into hydrogen rich gas via a non-thermal gliding arc plasma stabilized in a reverse vortex flow with very low and competitive specific energy requirement. Parametric tests determined the individual effects of power input (140-300 W), steam to carbon ratio (0.0–3.0), and equivalence ratio (0.1–0.7) on reformer performance. Factorial tests identified optimal operating condition based on minimizing the specific energy requirement, determined to be 184 kJ/mol H 2 or 1.91 eV/H 2 molecule, significantly below the value for conventional steam reforming of methane, 3.37 eV/H 2 molecule produced. The optimum operating conditions were found at an equivalence ratio of 0.11, a steam to carbon ratio of 0.14, and an input plasma power of 160 W, resulting in methane conversion of 48.8%, hydrogen yield of 23.4%, hydrogen selectivity of 47.8%, and an efficiency of 25.3%. Hydrogen sulfide as a common contaminant in landfill gas has detrimental effects on downstream facilities. The reactor was also evaluated on synthetic biogas containing hydrogen sulfide at low concentration (21 ppm). About 5.7% of the sulfur input to the system was partitioned to the dry outlet reformate stream with the remainder captured as sulfate in a downstream impinger or recovered as a solid of unknown molecular structure deposited on tubing surfaces between the reformer and the impinger. This reforming technology offers potential to be deployed as a lightweight compact portable system for on-site applications such as landfills, and depending on available fuels, in mobile applications such as ships.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Reforming of biogas using a non-thermal, gliding-arc, plasma in reverse vortex flow and fate of hydrogen sulfide contaminants","doi":"10.1016/j.fuproc.2019.05.031","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fuproc.2019.05.031","venue":""}

To design devices for this field, it is necessary to be familiar with the thermodynamic properties of state in a one-phase and a two-phase environment. In most cases, thermodynamic tables and diagrams are used, as well as different empirical functions obtained from measurements. In our case, quantum statistical thermodynamics were used to calculate thermodynamic properties of state. The mathematical model for calculation of the thermodynamic properties of state in real-gas, one-component systems is treated. The virial expansion theory with quantum corrections was used to calculate the thermodynamic functions of state. The mathematical model of a weakly coupled, highly degenerate quantum fluid is also dealt with. We have calculated the thermodynamic properties of state with the help of the quantum field theory for many particle systems using finite temperature formalism. We used the Feynman-Dyson perturbation theory. We developed the expression for the grand potential of normal Maxwell-Boltzmann systems with the help of Green function temperatures and Feynman's diagrams. The results of the analysis were compared with experimental data, and they show good agreement.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Approach for Calculating Thermophysical Properties with the Help of Statistical Thermodynamics","doi":"10.2514/2.6701","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.2514/2.6701","venue":""}

However, there has been little research to assess the benefits of WWP in small businesses. The purpose of this study is to prospectively evaluate changes in health, absenteeism, and presenteeism for employees who participated in a WWP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe conducted an observational, 3-year cohort study of 5766 employees from 314 businesses of differing sizes. We followed two cohorts of employees, who completed at least two annual health risk assessments (HRA) between May 2010 and December 2014. Changes from baseline to the first and second follow-up periods were assessed for chronic and non-chronic health conditions, absenteeism, and presenteeism.\n\n\nResults\nSmall business employees were more likely to participate in the WWP than were employees from large businesses. Changes in chronic and non-chronic health conditions varied by size of business, with small business employees showing improvements in stress, overall health, depression, smoking status, vegetable and fruit consumption, and physical activity, and in their perceptions of job health culture. In contrast, large business employees experienced improvements in stress, vegetable consumption, and alcohol use. No changes in absenteeism or presenteeism were observed.\n\n\nConclusions\nSmall businesses achieve higher employee participation rates and more health improvements when compared to employees from large employers. Findings suggest that small businesses may gain the most from a WWP.","inCitations":["41934c2fbf1a475238e2f0ecfd4a19c0a8d966f2","3648447e975ee49e9ed43b9b5b97ed1f717e1faf","96d3de7e03c27d31d3fe7675a871aa94edadbfc2","54c647463adc2927576c7fa43f583819e85b110f"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"The Impact of Worksite Wellness Programs by Size of Business: A 3-Year Longitudinal Study of Participation, Health Benefits, Absenteeism, and Presenteeism","doi":"10.1093/annweh/wxy049","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1093/annweh%2Fwxy049","venue":"Annals of work exposures and health"}

Common methods to deal with these two difficulties are based on dimensionality reduction and feature selection. In this paper, we present a different way to solve high dimensional data problems by combining the ideas of Random Forests and Anchor Graph semi-supervised learning. We randomly select a subset of features and use the Anchor Graph method to construct a graph. This process is repeated many times to obtain multiple graphs, a process which can be implemented in parallel to ensure runtime efficiency. Then the multiple graphs vote to determine the labels for the unlabeled data. We argue that the randomness can be viewed as a kind of regularization. We evaluate the proposed method on eight real-world data sets by comparing it with two traditional graph-based methods and one state-of-the-art semi-supervised learning method based on Anchor Graph to show its effectiveness. We also apply the proposed method to the subject of face recognition. A novel graph-based semi-supervised learning framework is proposed.RMG can handle high dimensional problems by injecting randomness into the graph.Randomness as a regularization can avoid curse of dimensionality and overfitting.Experimental results on eight data sets are presented to show the effectiveness.","inCitations":["9c3be3f8f0b9753656d0c00c3087b069b8736ee0","15066723366aaa737227284fbef37124c6e71d79","2305c4dcc8612f2b8fc80a3c9d47df2d0abc8db3"],"pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1016/j.imavis.2016.08.006"],"title":"Random Multi-Graphs: A semi-supervised learning framework for classification of high dimensional data","doi":"10.1016/j.imavis.2016.08.006","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.imavis.2016.08.006","venue":"Image Vis.

Faecal calprotectin (FC) is a good marker in monitoring adults with ulcerative colitis (UC). Its concentrations in faeces is related to state of mucosa observed in endoscopy. There are a few studies concerning FC in mucosa status assessment in UC paediatric population. Aim. Determination of cut-off points for FC levels in children with UC corresponding to the severity of inflammation in the colon. Material and methods. 91 patients with UC (F 45, M 46, median 14.79 years) were involved to the study and had colonoscopy performed and FC level within a week before endoscopy measured. Mucosa status was assessed with Mayo score. We have identified three subgroups: those with mucosal healing and Mayo score 0 or 1, patients with moderate inflammation in gut mucosa defined as Mayo score 2 and those with sever colitis described as Mayo score 3. The ROC was used as a statistical method to establish cut-off points. The AUC assesses the differentiation quality of the study group. We also analysed other laboratory, clinical or demographic data to established their impact on state of mucosa. Results. Strong significant positive correlation between Mayo score and PUCAI and FC was found, with r = 0.61; r = 0.68 respectively. AUC for FC in differentiation between mucosal healing and moderate disease was 0.90 whereas mild colitis and sever disease was 0.53. The optimal cut-off levels of FC of discrimination between subgroup with no or low disease activity and moderate activity in endoscopy findings was 300 μg/g with sensitivity 0.90 and specificity 0.82. Conclusions. Only FC and PUCAI are strongly correlated with state of mucosa in children with UC. FC of 300 μg/g let us to distinguish children with no or low activity of the disease between those with moderate colitis. The differentiation between moderate and sever colitis is not possible in UC children with usage of model based only on FC.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://www.pnmedycznych.pl/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/pnm_2017_596-600.pdf"],"title":"Can we predict mucosal inflammation in children with ulcerative colitis without colonoscopy?

Examples show that for the large-aperture and high-order asphere with f/number of 1:1.08, the root mean square (RMS) value of its residual wavefront error can be within 0.01λ by combining a simple two piece of lens and the first negative order diffracted wavefront of a CGH as a whole compensator. The result shows that this method holds the characteristics of all-purpose and high precision, and overcomes localizations of other methods.","inCitations":["35aff39a9c245ac9ca08fcad8758366ad50b2305","fbb2f013ce67ab18acdbd3060a25614c4ca43b91"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Technical study for testing of aspheres by using ZYGO interferometer","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

In conventional evaporation system, the Se atoms were supplied as large clusters (Se x , x>5). However, the size of clusters can be reduced by the thermal cracking. The film qualities grown with small clusters (Se x , x<4) would be improved, since the smaller size molecules easily react with elemental metals, resulting in the reduction of selenium vacancies and the enhancement of surface migration. The CIGS films were deposited by the three-stage method with cracked selenium, and the films were evaluated by SEM, XRD, EDX, C-V measurement and admittance spectroscopy. It was found from the C-V characteristics that the carrier concentrations of the CIGS films grown with cracked selenium were increased with increasing the cracking temperature. The result clearly showed that the use of cracked selenium was effective for reduction of selenium vacancies. The conversion efficiency of 15.4% was obtained by using cracked selenium at a cracking temperature of 500 °C.","inCitations":["6f7f4ee9283379eb4aebe59e248f3d9bc4cee09e"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Cu(In,Ga)Se2 thin-film solar cells grown with cracked selenium","doi":"10.1016/j.jcrysgro.2008.09.091","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcrysgro.2008.09.091","venue":""}

In the present\nwork, we use N-body techniques to investigate some of currently open issues\nrelated to the formation and evolution of galaxies along the Hubble sequence\n(see Chapter 1). In particular, we address (i) the role of dissipation-less\nmerging on the scaling relations and internal color gradients of early-type\ngalaxies, by modeling these systems with two-component Sersic models; (ii)\nthe formation and survival of cold disks in the merging of late-type gas-rich\nsystems, and (iii) the different merging history of galaxy types through cosmological\nsimulations.\nWe present new spherical, isotropic, non rotating, two-component (dark +\nstellar matter) models of early-type galaxies (see Chapter 2). In order to\nrealistically describe the observed light profile of early-type systems and the\nshape of the mass profile of galaxy dark matter haloes predicted by recent numerical\nsimulation results, both components of these models are described by\na deprojected Sersic law. We perform a detailed analysis of structural properties\nand distribution function of these models, proving that they represent\nphysically admissible and stable systems. The free parameters of the models\nare derived from observational properties of early-type galaxies. We perform\ndiscrete realizations of the two-component Sersic models, analyzing in detail\nhow to derive an optimal softening length for the gravitational potential of\nthese discrete systems. The models are then used to simulate dry mergers of\nearly-type galaxy systems, by means of the N-body simulation code Gadget-2\n(Springel 2005, see Chapter 3). The mergers are performed with progenitors\nspanning a wide range of galaxy luminosities and with a variety of initial\norbital parameters. We find that dissipation-less merging preserves the Fundamental\nPlane relation of early-type galaxies, in agreement with previous\nworks. However, in contrast to previous findings, we find that dissipationless\nmerging also moves galaxies along other observed correlations, such as\nthe Kormendy, the Faber-Jackson, and the luminosity–size relations. Hence,\nwe conclude that all the above correlations are preserved after dissipationless encounters of early-type galaxies. For the first time, we are also able\nto perform a detailed analysis of how dissipationless merging affects internal\nstellar population gradients of ETGs. We find that the metallicity profiles,\ninitially assigned to the merging progenitors, can be significantly flattened\nafter the encounters. The amount of flattening is larger for low mass-ratio\nmergers (down to a minor-merger ratio of 1:4), and also becomes larger as\nthe mass of the progenitors decreases. Remarkably, this allows the existence\nof shallow stellar population gradients in ETGs to be explained as a result\nof galaxy-galaxy merging.\nThe second issue we have addressed is the possibility of rebuilding late-type\nsystems starting from merging of disk galaxies. Recent pioneering works\nhave shown that, in merger simulations with a significant stellar feedback,\neven a major merger can produce a disk-dominated remnant. These works\nshow that a combination of strong stellar feedback (in very peculiar conditions)\nand a large gas content are essential ingredients to the survival of disks\nafter a merging process. However, merger remnants result to have a large\nbulge component, which can likely describe only early spiral galaxy types. In\ncontrast, our simulations show that disk formation through merging of gas\nrich systems might be an important ingredient of galaxy formation theories\nin more general conditions. Using realistic galaxy models (M33-like) whose\nmain novelty is that of having a hot gaseous halo component (in addition\nto cold gas in the disk), we performed a set of hydrodynamical merger simulations.\nWe show that mergers between these progenitors, whose baryonic\ncomponent mainly consists of gas, produce late-type galaxies rather than\nelliptical/S0 systems. We interpret this result by the fact that gas cooling\nfrom the halo has a crucial role in producing the disk-dominated remnants.\nIn fact, we find that gas particles in the halo have a temperature very close\nto the peak of the gas cooling function. Hence, the hot gas cools very rapidly\nafter merging, acquiring angular momentum from the orbit, and settles on\nthe final disk.\nFinally, we have studied the formation and evolution of different galaxy types,\nwith the main focus of studying the properties of S0 galaxies, in N-body cosmological\nsimulations. From a large cosmological simulation, we have selected\na cluster of galaxies with size and velocity dispersion similar to the Virgo cluster,\ndeveloping an original scheme to identify elliptical, S0, and spiral galaxy\ncandidates. With this scheme, we have derived the morphology-radius relation\nand the velocity distribution of galaxies in the simulated cluster at\nredshift z = 0, and compared them to observational results. The first results\npresented in this work show a relatively good match of the simulated and\nobserved morphology-radius relation, but unfortunately, we also find that\nour simulations suffers of the low resolution problem.

The pathogenesis of bone loss in PBC is not well understood, since low bone formation and high resorption have been described. Bone disease is influenced by the duration and severity of the disease and oestrogen deficiency secondary to menopause. Genetic susceptibility has also been considered for osteoporosis in PBC, including vitamin D receptor genotypes, the gene encoding collagen type I alpha1 and insulin growth factor 1 gene microsatellite repeat polymorphism. Based on current evidence, the proposed genotypes either do not influence the development of osteoporosis in PBC or play only a minor role in it. The duration as well the severity of cholestasis are the main factors for such a disturbance since they are associated with the degree of bone loss. These features may exceed the potential effect of gene polymorphisms on osteoporosis in PBC.","inCitations":["8afba540ebe0cefc552e7c8ab254af4e2e3c3850","dd8890cb963338250dbb7bb59ba39bd3f5b832e3","2e5156a7c1805a59937370614f6dfdc0afd219c0","870bba5e46041eb55a1d6853a533a6e9b2d08e06","a7083659db27ca13d229770e7d63afc2ad2d81ca","d394277861594b0f7ff292969780cd6e7991f084","a738df2dd0dcfd3e611eb4b284bed6b374f22820","23bcefcf680357f5885ac0f1d48bf6266f72fc70","84e5926a3825587cf76d7c79d7204659db738c57","f4e31cc9aed6039fc3d0cb2099dfacbbc9eb269f","6c82ec00f5bdcd9123f923b0a6d78ee795215832","df14f383b753fb2dbf4f8718544df577a52b5834","63be043428289f9b814eaba2a45bb1144b4afa83","f5ae8dce02a751a1b8936b605305b9f95b8e6f25","9a25372898cac41b4f8e96538747f564f2b29b16","b9dd1e5efb8ca89aa820d3751502c8d993610b23","6301b06e3f0774094884f758ec7ca10f2826753d","f12c586386695a76d3ca05b1a415cfad920270e2"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Gene polymorphisms as predictors of decreased bone mineral density and osteoporosis in primary biliary cirrhosis.","doi":"10.1097/00042737-200503000-00009","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1097/00042737-200503000-00009","venue":"European journal of gastroenterology & hepatology"}

The relationship between mean and dispersion is very important in the geosciences and is expressed by the coefficient of variation according to: \n \n$$CV\\% = 100\\sigma /mean$$ \n \n(13.1) \n \nwhere a = standard deviation. The coefficient of variation is attractive as a statistical tool because it apparently permits the comparison of variates free from scale effects; i.e., it is dimensionless. However, it has appropriate meaning only if the data achieve ratio scale. The coefficient of variation can be plotted as a graph to compare data. A CV exceeding say about 30 percent is often indicative of problems in the data or that the experiment is out of control. Variates with a mean less than unity also provide spurious results and the coefficient of variation will be very large and often meaningless.","inCitations":["8d6cbe17cb100aa91e5baafbd14f54e47242b219","5008461e45787c291dcefdc7b86dc06b0ed5364e","05ee3d3208faaee357e24e0441193ac7d6ff8165","ec49281cac788dd82c0c437e4c8137da02b44b2a","a45bfdda880f74b8317c803badcf26b57f6704d1","6d5a589e58521a6181f65515e4b9abc1723c96c5","7b2a473b4ea327ef53f85194fda711d045dc8378","f362eea471c5cbf82e4e1961028e374480522b9b","8d0315d87e157940213ede9a6916b02876ee49a0","785a96dd9761f545df2c8caa592c2144f96822b5","739ec4f8a2f4f8d39169f6dda5a9f687431291e6","08c08a22edd30aa55d9bfd0c6f9ef49a23794f51","d2f9ba0aec2e97dc429cbe00538b51b0f2f06814","be156569f0d35c2491f8b70820fc272dc12c2993","d689befa82a9fd307e4a0ffef8ee62a0c6720163","a1c9c2b3b674c246ee4b1da922637a52757c5648","984b0fa4b1827ec1006b81a911c479f2b9a98998","97f555026eae37dfd6a54bea138656c2d84437d1","d2d696600841bd31cf7b5ff73b3c33680ec20bf8","f4d530cafd3988fb1528b043f3500dad23770b38","5812918c518f8ef3ea4a8b94f241472371e8f59d","c36726518d84da3ad0062030cc7313aff317c1d1","de5112628cb57d309810e3eeb4a17fb281284a8b","4de06e22617bab6d32da3b481411a20fd09daaa3","1ab737dfee6d5e1d7a0b8e51f4b2f588c2684740","6b02620d121f5cf41c19b5444c02e8b2f2572def","fcf213abde476dcb3d49a7c34f5101a0411ee642","f839ed897f268dee3b3ba757440aa29722420ae7","5b010d3d231c6313142f391acfd7ff28d3db477d","c4487e41de7d04594e8b43cce60f566988e3a8d6","7615ed4f35f84cc086b9ae8e421891f3d33c68a6","d9e1de6c286df24489233533296902e22e7514ae","e7047e27d17657f6be3712f1512a0f9bcb5a1148","405dfaefd668cba9d6d95a1316b7c0208059b631","55e4c1c02a7499cc99082ceaaf13d32af46ce845"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Coefficient of Variation","doi":"10.1007/978-3-642-80328-4_13","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-80328-4_13","venue":""}

In all cases, it turns out that productivity is  determined by general or more local principles, and that sets of linguistic and extra-linguistic constraints tend to compete or conflict with each other.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://ojs.uv.es/index.php/qfilologia/article/download/3282/2925"],"title":"The Xed out construction: between productivity and creativity","doi":"10.7203/qfilologia.18.3282","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.7203/qfilologia.18.3282","venue":""}

In the usual case, they are built as hybrid systems which integrate several software components of different nature and origins e.g.; legacy systems, web services, commercial components (typically referred as COTS) and, Free and/or Open Source Software (FOSS). The evaluation of individual software components is highly relevant in this kind of system and is usually conducted with the support of software Quality Models. However, these artifacts usually consider only the evaluation of technical quality requirements, in detriment of non-technical ones (e.g. costs, legal and quality of suppliers) which can be just as critical, particularly in the selection of COTS and FOSS. In this paper, we propose an extension to preexisting software Quality Models, intended to deal with technical and non-technical quality requirements in a homogeneous and holistic way. The relevance of the approach is illustrated in relation to four industrial FOSS adoption processes.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-29238-6_5"],"title":"On the Use of Non-technical Requirements for the Evaluation of FOSS Software Components","doi":"10.1007/978-3-030-29238-6_5","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-29238-6_5","venue":"QUATIC"}

Study design 724 non-syndromic patients with an orofacial cleft who had finished their surgical treatment were included in this prospective study. Mean age of the patients was 16.8 years (SD = 1.9). Patients were divided into two groups: cleft lip (CL), and cleft lip and palate (CLP). The CL and CLP group were again divided into patients with unilateral and bilateral cleft lips. Health related quality of life was measured using a modified SF-36 questionnaire to measure eight dimensions. To validate the modified SF-36 questionnaire, a control group of 744 patients who had undergone ENT surgeries were given the same questionnaire. Results The answers of the ENT patients were compared with the answers of the cleft patients, using the Chi-Square test. Cleft patients showed a high score on the eight dimensions of the questionnaire. For five of the dimensions the mean score was above 4. The lowest score was found on bodily pain (mean 3.45). There was no effect of age. Having a cleft palate influenced all eight dimensions statistically more in a negative way than a cleft lip does. Conclusion On average cleft patients have a good health related quality of life. However, there were differences in the levels of satisfaction. The major factor influencing quality of life negatively was the presence of a cleft palate.","inCitations":["015fd33b5be3d448e2bfec540372340995c1cfb6","e36cc1ac93501d652a64579c2f92c8ef6338c6e7","2fc5325704c15ca76087a0e8f76d5385bc00f8c5","b7c554986b35af9f8da0002615028f7fdb8d5b32"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Health related quality of life of patients with non-syndromic orofacial clefts.","doi":"10.1016/j.ajoms.2011.08.004","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajoms.2011.08.004","venue":""}

For each member of the families involved, we show how to easily determine the fundamental unit of the underlying quadratic order Z[(1+ √ Dk(X))/2]. We also demonstrate how the simple continued fraction expansion of (1+ √ Dk(X))/2 is related to that of (1 + √ C)/2. As applications, we present infinite families of continued fractions related to the Fibonacci numbers. This continues work in [11]-[12] and corrects errors in [15] (see Theorem 3.1). In 1949, Nyberg [14] found the first example of a parametric family in which a fundamental unit can be easily produced even though the period length of the continued fraction gets arbitrarily large. Since this discovery, there have been a number of generalizations: Dan Shanks [16]-[17] (see also Yamamoto [22]) in 1969 1971, Hendy [5] in 1974, Bernstein [2]-[3] in 1976, Williams [20] in 1985, Levesque and Rhin [7] in 1986, Azuhata [1] in 1987, Levesque [6] in 1988, Halter-Koch [4] in 1989, Mollin and Williams [13] in 1992, Williams [19] in 1995, and van der Poorten and Williams in [15] in 1999. In [12], we found infinite families of quadratic Pellian polynomials Dk(X) such that the continued fraction expansions √ Dk(X) have unbounded period length for arbitrary k, while for fixed k and arbitrary X > 0, have constant period length. In this paper, we continue the investigation for simple continued fraction expansions of (1 + √ Dk(x))/2, where Dk(X) are quadratic polynomials of Eisenstein type (see Section 3 below). We are also able to find explicit fundamental units of the order Z[(1 + √ Dk(X))/2]. A consequence of the result is an infinite family of continued fraction expansions whose fundamental units and discriminant are related to Fibonacci numbers. Ostensibly the first such finding of these types of continued fractions was given in [21], and the findings herein appear to be the second, albeit distinctly different from those given in [21]. The relatively “small” fundamental units for the underlying quadratic order which we explicitly determine means that we have “large” class numbers hD(X) for Z[(1 + √ D(X))/2]. The reason behind this fact is Siegel’s class number result [18] which tells us that for positive discriminants ∆, lim ∆→∞ log(h∆R)/ log( √ ∆) = 1","inCitations":["a4e437aa62973a5b6969663261507ad7a8b9fbc8"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Period Lengths of Continued Fractions Involving Fibonacci Numbers","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

It can be achieved by passive means using dynamic absorbers or by active means using sensors and actuators. In some cases, it is also not practical to apply a desirable control force in those locations at which the dynamics of the structure are to be controlled. In recent years, dynamic absorption schemes are investigated in which control strategies that absorb a steady state motion of a desired location in the structure have been developed. Such a vibration control strategy is termed as zero assignment. Unlike conventional full-state feedback control, which requires all the states of the system to be measured, zero assignment requires least numbers of sensors and actuators (depending on the number of dynamic absorption points) for estimating the control gains and, hence, it may provide economical engineering solution. However, while applying control strategy by active zero assignment, small time delay from the sensors and actuators in the feedback loop is unavoidable and they influence the control gains as well as the stability of the system. In this paper, we have developed vibration control strategy by active zero assignment and obtained closed form control gains for systems with and without time delays by using truncated and full Taylor series expansion. Some examples related to conservative and nonconservative systems as well as realistic distributed parameter systems are presented to demonstrate the active dynamic absorption and the effects of time delay on control gains. The effect of delay in the stability of the controlled system is also summarized.","inCitations":["ce9a587278a633630faba1869c725726aa492e7e","1d171818fb62ecf10c032b08c5ea880b5373cbaf"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Closed Form Control Gains for Zero Assignment in the Time Delayed System","doi":"10.1115/1.4002340","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1115/1.4002340","venue":""}

Retail shops vary in size, sell a diversity of household, mechanical and convenience items and appear as an integral part of urban form. While retails shops provide essential services to a variety of consumers generate employment and make urban streets vibrant, there have been few investigations into the nature of retail form in Sri Lanka. It appears that the global spread of supermarkets and shopping malls are transforming the retail space in Sri Lankan cities. Utilizing field observation data, this study investigates the extent to which traditional retail outlets dominate the retail form in the urban landscape, creates employment, and attracts customers. This study also examines to what extent city retail outlets are retained as shop houses. Results show that while Sri Lankan traditional small retail shops form a greater number of retail shops and continue to be an emblem of the urban landscape, the development of a few new shopping malls and supermarkets have impacted the daily shopping behaviour of people and are slowly transforming the retail form as well as urban landscape.","inCitations":["114d44ae4785148559f46f8f0d965b04c990aa07","93776f892c04f5f4e07fdf984537d9a8a3d71aea"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Traditional small retail shops vs. emerging supermarkets and shopping malls in a Sri Lankan city","doi":"10.4038/bhumi.v4i1.4","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.4038/bhumi.v4i1.4","venue":""}

Meta-analysis is also performed within a single cohort that is stratified by, e.g., sex or ancestry group. Having correlated individuals among the strata may complicate meta-analyses, limit power, and inflate Type 1 error. For example, in the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos (HCHS/SOL), sources of correlation include genetic relatedness, shared household, and shared community. We propose a novel mixed-effect model for meta-analysis, \"MetaCor,\" which accounts for correlation between stratum-specific effect estimates. Simulations show that MetaCor controls inflation better than alternatives such as ignoring the correlation between the strata or analyzing all strata together in a \"pooled\" GWAS, especially with different minor allele frequencies (MAFs) between strata. We illustrate the benefits of MetaCor on two GWASs in the HCHS/SOL. Analysis of dental caries (tooth decay) stratified by ancestry group detected a genome-wide significant SNP (rs7791001, P-value = 3.66×10-8, compared to 4.67×10-7 in pooled), with different MAFs between strata. Stratified analysis of body mass index (BMI) by ancestry group and sex reduced overall inflation from λGC=1.050 (pooled) to λGC=1.028 (MetaCor). Furthermore, even after removing close relatives to obtain nearly uncorrelated strata, a naïve stratified analysis resulted in λGC=1.058 compared to λGC=1.027 for MetaCor.","inCitations":["ecada85aeeed57bebcae30b37af677a07842e48a","1e8c8417c42ec686e75806eb97598442149472d4","ec33728b32498aa59ea523dfd0e281ab62be1be9","0559a579d05a5cd02acc36c3479109f44594315f","c3dfafbdec364626a7072af193cd7df7f00bc770","1be9d403468280fb68361eb155f31bf4d737284f","1bece815e93fabb3c39d29c5ad4aba61d4d35d2e","983823a32a98c3213a9b1758830c7699ca248795"],"pdfUrls":["http://biostats.bepress.com/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1249&context=uwbiostat"],"title":"Meta-Analysis of Genome-Wide Association Studies with Correlated Individuals: Application to the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos (HCHS/SOL).","doi":"10.1002/gepi.21981","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1002/gepi.21981","venue":"Genetic epidemiology"}

These NE cells release growth factors including neuropeptides and biogenic amines which correlate with tumour progression, differentiation, androgen independence, angiogenesis and poor prognosis. Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine 5HT), a monoamine neurotransmitter, plays a role in regulation of growth, gene expression and may function as a proto- oncogene. 5HT acts as a growth factor in tumours such as small cell carcinoma of the lung and colonic carcinoma. The in vitro effect of 5HT and 5HT antagonists on prostate and bladder cancer cell growth was evaluated. Cell culture and proliferation assay studies established a significant increase in growth proliferation by 5HT. Furthermore, there was a significant growth inhibition by 5HTiA and 5HTiB antagonists on prostate cancer (PC3) cells and bladder cancer (HT1376) cells. FACS analysis in PC3 cells demonstrated cell cycle arrest and apoptosis when treated with 5HTia and 5HTib antagonists. Immuno-staining for 5HT- A and 5HT-ib receptors was seen in PC3 cells, HT1376 cells, as well as in human prostate and bladder cancer tissue. Western blot analysis demonstrated 5HT-IA and 5HT1B receptor proteins in both prostate and bladder cancer cells and tissue. Ethical approval was obtained and the Helsinki Declaration of Human Rights was strictly adhered to throughout this study. These results imply that a 5HT system exists in both prostate and bladder cancer tissue. 5HTia, and in particular 5HT1B receptor antagonists, warrant further investigation as potential anti-neoplastic agents. A growth inhibitory effect of an alpha adrenoceptor antagonist (doxazosin) on PC3 and HT1376 cells was also demonstrated. This growth inhibition is independent of the antagonist action on alphai-adrenoceptors. Incubation of PC3 cells with 5HT or 5HTib agonist partially reversed the growth inhibitory effect of doxazosin. Doxazosin may modulate the action of 5HT, possibly at the receptor level. Doxazosin (or more effective analogues) commonly used in the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia, may be potential chemotherapeutic agents.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"The role of serotonin (5HT) and 5HT antagonists in urological cancers","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

The classical linear modal model is used, with additional terms included to represent the direct non-linear restoring forces of the system. Using this force appropriation for non-linear systems (FANS) method, a force vector with harmonics present is derived using an optimization approach such that the response of the system is restricted to that of a target mode, but in the non-linear region. The response obtained from several force levels is then curve fitted using the restoring force method applied in linear modal space so as to yield the direct linear and non-linear modal parameters for the target mode. The method is applied to a simulated two-d.o.f. example and good agreement is found between estimated and true parameters. An extension to the identification of critical non-linear modal cross-coupling terms is proposed.","inCitations":["ed06f33fd98f0ab0fe142613d9fc3cc0c3c97c53","92ed7b47494805392fd6fcd1ecfcb031bc07ad9a","ed118fd973d16673b672e6c5a45cc1c306c6ad23","a171ea3f437ff08668f3c5eb807cd17be925722a","6c1663ea8c900030f7e4f8ca61f6ea8620613123","a67ba5f5985e84547530ea3778ceaa120c9ecc8f","e2a67c7733c744260dc2dfe21973226856f67f68","4173863e6c047dc86b8e90aacd94e0b76dbe8ed4","19d8018fa7ac29a6fa1da91db429953c608f07b4","1cdb09b3586d963824442e4f443a447a429ba844","451ae3cdc95bf50431ff9e77abddeba96c9a4b50","86812e92a43f7adbcc1643883c143144f707c548","c8cf28cb2ee884aaaafa37eba0b61fdc1163c9a6"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"An extension of force appropriation to the identification of non-linear multi-degree of freedom systems","doi":"10.1006/jsvi.2000.3033","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1006/jsvi.2000.3033","venue":""}

Case studies of hindlimbs from normal, adjuvant arthritic, and etodolac-treated arthritic rats demonstrated the association of disease severity with inflammation, chondromalacia, replacement of adipose bone marrow with a fibroid marrow, osteoclastic bone resorption, synovial cysts, and pannus formation within the joints. Extensive periosteal intramembranous bone formation was temporally associated with joint destruction and medullary tissue pathology.In vivo data were correlated within vitro effects of inflammatory mediators (IL-1, PGE2) on bone resorption. Etodolac blocked bone explant PGE2 accumulation at concentrations of 10−7M and higher, and inhibited bone resorption at concentrations of 10−5M and higher. The data indicate thatin vitro andin vivo models of bone metabolism are well correlated regarding prostaglandin synthesis; that the inflammatory mediator PGE2 is largely responsible for the involvement of skeletal tissue in the adjuvant arthritis model; and that the effects of etodolac are specifically mediated by its ability to inhibit PGE2 accumulationin vivo.","inCitations":["4034993bd3f0fb0162a658c843922a6a0ad6b42b"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Prostaglandins in inflammatory bone pathology: Mechanism and therapeutic benefit of etodolac","doi":"10.1007/BF01967295","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/BF01967295","venue":"Agents and Actions"}
