In this field, nanotechnology appears to be promising in its ability to characterize an individual microorganism and detect heterogeneous distribution of microbes in food samples. In this study, atomic force microscopy (AFM), a nanotechnology tool, was used to investigate Escherichia coli (E. coli) qualitatively and quantitatively. E. coli strains B and K12 were used as surrogates to represent pathogenic strains, such as E. coli O157: H7. The results from AFM were compared with those from scanning/transmission electron microscopy (SEM/TEM). The qualitative determination was obtained using morphology and characteristic parameters from AFM images, and the quantitative determination was obtained by calculating the microorganisms in AFM images. The results show that AFM provides a new approach for rapid determination of microorganisms for food safety.","inCitations":["7a1d014e318e20d3270d14733205d7d5f853d434","f608e430fec686d507ba2ce2956d4df04bf3aa29","d546a4e71890a5f9563cd4252e1c4fe28e8bb57e"],"pdfUrls":["http://docs.wixstatic.com/ugd/0a5194_4fa6a93593084da5a3d4a173f4d6833b.pdf"],"title":"Application of atomic force microscopy on rapid determination of microorganisms for food safety.","doi":"10.1111/j.1750-3841.2008.00918.x","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1750-3841.2008.00918.x","venue":"Journal of food science"}

Glands histologically deemed normal were used as controls. The analyses were also carried out on tissue specimens incubated in hypo-, normo- and hypercalcemic media (0.5, 1.25, and 3.0 mM calcium concentration). Analysis of chief cells from normal glands did not reveal any significant differences in ionic composition after exposure to the different calcium concentrations. In chief cells from adenomatous and uremic hyperplastic glands, elemental changes were noted. In comparison with specimens incubated in 1.25 mM calcium medium, cells in 0.5 mM calcium medium had a lower content of potassium and phosphorus. After stimulation with increasing extracellular concentration, an increase in the K/Na ratio was observed, due to a marked decrease of sodium and an increase of potassium: the calcium concentration was almost unchanged. Our findings indicate that in HPT an increase in serum calcium concentration might exert a stimulatory effect on the Na/K pump (sodium pump) and on the calcium-activated potassium channels. Either of these mechanisms might contribute to a lowering of cytoplasmic calcium. Our observations suggest that changes in ionic content of the parathyroid cells may be of importance for the stimulus secretion process in the cells.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"X-ray microanalysis of elemental changes in human parathyroid glands in primary and secondary hyperparathyroidism","doi":"10.1007/BF01457660","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/BF01457660","venue":"Histochemistry and Cell Biology"}

Fifteen corn rows cultivated within the traditional system, featuring high productivity, were sampled in the Alto Paranaiba, MG, Brazil, for the agricultural year 2014/2015, and the productivity, extraction and export of N, P, K, Ca, Mg and S were assessed. Accumulation of these macronutrients in the grains and total extraction had positive effects in corn productivity. Mass of one thousand grains was the most relevant productivity´s component. N, P, K and S extraction and export increased linearly with increase of productivity.

Although frequencies <15 kHz do not elicit the ASR when presented alone, when presented with ultrasound (40 kHz), low-frequency stimuli suppress the ultrasound-induced startle. Thus, using methods similar to those in masking experiments, we used two-tone suppression to assay sensitivity to frequencies in the audio band. Startle suppression was tuned to frequencies near 5 kHz, the frequency range of male calling songs. Similar to equal loudness contours measured in humans, however, equal suppression contours were not parallel, as the equivalent rectangular bandwidth of suppression tuning changed with increases in ultrasound intensity. Temporal integration of suppressor stimuli was measured using nonsimultaneous presentations of 5-ms pulses of 6 and 40 kHz. We found that no suppression occurs when the suppressing tone is >2 ms after and >5 ms before the ultrasound stimulus, suggesting that stimulus overlap is a requirement for suppression. When considered together with our finding that the intensity of low-frequency stimuli required for suppression is greater than that produced by singing males, the overlap requirement suggests that two-tone suppression functions to limit the ASR to sounds containing only ultrasound and not to broadband sounds that span the audio and ultrasound range.","inCitations":["102dcac66e621be3a22fde770939dab1892ff2ee","b5238c4fbacb1bda7bc97c46455bd473361e0bb2","0849ae6eed1febbfe847314a7cb131927df9e90b","e2ae8a31e2f54e259c9cd9a9933c8bd53b64314a","3535cfa1df3ff48c54abba61e32e8dadbb9d84cd","0a27345519efc504ebefc3620d0f713f3574b0fc","178448446db2b7cadc2c07305f300bfc5857e287"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Two-tone suppression in the cricket, Eunemobius carolinus (Gryllidae, Nemobiinae).","doi":"10.1121/1.1451069","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1121/1.1451069","venue":"The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America"}

However, it is no longer available due to more stringent requirements on the manufacturing process. The objective of this project was to determine whether Corynebacterium parvum is an effective sclerosant in an experimental model in rabbits. The following medications were instilled intrapleurally in anaesthetized male rabbits: tetracycline 35 mg.kg-1 or C. parvum 4 or 8 mg, all diluted with bacteriostatic saline solution. Twenty eight days after the instillation, the animals were sacrificed and the pleural spaces assessed macroscopically for evidence of pleurodesis and microscopically for evidence of fibrosis and inflammation. The intrapleural injection of C. parvum was ineffective in creating pleural fibrosis. The mean degree of pleurodesis in the 10 rabbits who received tetracycline was 3.5 +/- 0.7 (scale 0-4) whilst in the 10 rabbits that received 4 mg C. parvum it was 0.0 +/- 0.0, and in the 10 rabbits that received 8 mg C. parvum it was 0.5 +/- 0.8. Based on this study, we recommend that C. parvum should not be used as a pleural sclerosant in patients with normal pleura.","inCitations":["a65a18448188ec490d40c0739d4929a57ec2319b","94c6ad7877777c1eb0914a413eb7498d88e70510","64df6065d83553486042f90034586dc3a216d310","9042e850f76d5d614478ff58746d5854c523046e","039080457815ea5c95e5a05a0a6d902abaff9f8b","cd97c8b4077fa8eae04bb6b4d5c875605e1e9549","19f39ce3b204fc4b5c4f3e9186aa60af7045a3e6","1a1992155c73cd7f4d4b5a865c7519cd2c37b121"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Corynebacterium parvum versus tetracycline as pleural sclerosing agents in rabbits.","doi":"10.1183/09031936.95.08122174","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1183/09031936.95.08122174","venue":"The European respiratory journal"}

The incidence among us was 15 women for each man and the distal metatarsal articular angle (DMAA) proved to be the main intrinsic factor responsible for the expressivity of hallux valgus in the male sex. In the second part, the goal was to evaluate the response of these patients to the surgical treatment. Methods: Data from fifty feet of male patients with hallux valgus, who were surgically treated by the same surgeon between 1985 and 2005, were retrospectively analyzed. The technique was algorithmically chosen according to the intensity and complexity of the deformities. Thus, 10 chevron osteotomies, 9 biplanar chevron osteotomies, 12 Mitchell osteotomies, 9 Scarf osteotomies and 10 basilar first metatarsal osteotomies were performed. The average follow-up was 10 years (minimum of 2 and maximum of 20). Results: After analyzing the group of patients, the angular radiological parameters, the sesamoid deviation and the articular congruence prove to have had the adequate correction of the deformities due to the treatment carried out. When examining the procedures separately, it is possible to notice the balance in their corrective capacities, except for the Scarf osteotomy. The rising in the AOFAS score certified the clinical and functional improvement of the operated patients in the postoperative period. Conclusions: It was conclude that hallux valgus in the male sex was adequately corrected with the selected techniques validating the algorithm of treatment employed for both sexes. A greater difficulty or resistance to the treatment of the male hallux valgus could not be detected. The Scarf osteotomy proved to have an inferior corrective capacity than the other techniques.","inCitations":["04a23d0f9cee0e6eacda7722b7a423f9b88860ca"],"pdfUrls":["https://scijfootankle.com/ABTPe/article/download/640/586"],"title":"Hálux valgo em homens – parte II: avaliação do tratamento cirúrgico","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

The frequent occurrence of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria due to irrational application of antibiotics increases treatment cost and mortality. Graphene oxide (GO) has been generally reported to possess high antimicrobial activity against a wide range of bacteria in vitro. In this study, a graphene oxide-quaternary ammonium salt (GO-QAS) nanocomposite was synthesized and thoroughly investigated for synergistic antibacterial activity, underlying antibacterial mechanisms and biocompatibility in vitro and in vivo.MethodsThe GO-QAS nanocomposite was synthesized through amidation reactions of carboxylic group end-capped QAS polymers with primary amine-decorated GO to achieve high QAS loading ratios on nanosheets. Next, we investigated the antibacterial activity and biocompatibility of GO-QAS in vitro and in vivo.ResultsGO-QAS exhibited synergistic antibacterial activity against bacteria through not only mechanical membrane perturbation, including wrapping, bacterial membrane insertion, and bacterial membrane perforation, but also oxidative stress induction. In addition, it was found that GO-QAS could eradicate multidrug-resistant bacteria more effectively than conventional antibiotics. The in vitro and in vivo toxicity tests indicated that GO-QAS did not exhibit obvious toxicity towards mammalian cells or organs at low concentrations. Notably, GO-QAS topically applied on infected wounds maintained highly efficient antibacterial activity and promoted infected wound healing in vivo.ConclusionsThe GO-QAS nanocomposite exhibits excellent synergistic antibacterial activity and good biocompatibility both in vitro and in vivo. The antibacterial mechanisms involve both mechanical membrane perturbation and oxidative stress induction. In addition, GO-QAS accelerated the healing process of infected wounds by promoting re-epithelialization and granulation tissue formation. Overall, the results indicated that the GO-QAS nanocomposite could be applied as a promising antimicrobial agent for infected wound management and antibacterial wound dressing synthesis.","inCitations":["08562e927e26208f4c129dc49243598612e2141f","f319c524077edc784711402b28f12b8fd9b912bb","7104399f10327ea8c662e45f6587ddd57d914691","9fac7d6ec87ec668ba728a3c3de33203286b0570"],"pdfUrls":["https://burnstrauma.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s41038-018-0115-2"],"title":"Synthesis of graphene oxide-quaternary ammonium nanocomposite with synergistic antibacterial activity to promote infected wound healing","doi":"10.1186/s41038-018-0115-2","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s41038-018-0115-2","venue":"Burns & Trauma"}

The trouble is that the argument against such an elegant evasion of the issue has been compellingly set out by Stevenson himself. In a devastating review of J.

El citado organo jurisdiccional, en la sentencia 1077, creo una nueva competencia que denomino «recurso autonomo de interpretacion de la Constitucion», mediante el cual interpreta de forma abstracta las normas constitucionales al margen de problemas concretos que vinculen dicha interpretacion. La Sala Constitucional demuestra en su interpretacion juridica que no le ha sido atribuida una competencia como la ejercitada y funda su actuacion en la existencia en el ambito de la jurisdiccion ordinaria de un recurso de interpretacion de leyes (art. 266 de la CB) que, operando «per saltum», hace aconsejable la existencia de un recurso de interpretacion constitucional (art. 335 de la C.B).

So far, several studies had been performed on hybrid polysiloxanes with perfluoroalkyl spacers. The present study focuses on hybrid polysiloxanes with alkyl spacers -C n H 2n -(called SiOHT PSX). Their synthesis is described, and the influence of the size of the spacer on the thermal behavior of these SrOHT PSX has been evaluated. The synthesis of SiH terminated hybrid oligosiloxanes (SiHT PSX) with different sizes was performed via a new route: polyhydrosilylation of octadiene with tetramethyldisiloxane (TMDS). The theoretical control of the average number molecular weights (M n ) was achieved by adding an excess of one of the difunctional compounds (TMDS in this case). These M n are discussed and compared to the experimental M n determinted by 1 H NMR. The influence of the size of the SiHT PSX on its thermal behavior was studied and considered in parallel with the homologue SiOHT PSX. The SiOHT PSXs synthesized may be considered as choice elastomers once they exhibe a low glass transition temperature (T g ) and excellent thermal resistance. The SiHT PSXs exhibit lower T g but they show a lower thermal resistance. However, they may be used as performing precursors for the synthesis of block copolymers.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Synthesis, characterization and thermal properties of SiH and SiOH terminated hybrid polysiloxanes","doi":"10.1002/1521-3935(20001101)201:17<2309::AID-MACP2309>3.0.CO;2-P","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1002/1521-3935%2820001101%29201%3A17%3C2309%3A%3AAID-MACP2309%3E3.0.CO%3B2-P","venue":""}

The study was undertaken to elucidate whether atherosclerotic aortic plaque detected by transesophageal echocardiography can be a clinically useful marker for significant obstructive coronary artery disease.\n\n\nMETHODS\nClinical and angiographic features and intraoperative transesophageal echocardiographic findings were prospectively analyzed in 131 consecutive patients (58 women and 73 men, aged 17 to 75 years [mean 54 +/- 12]) undergoing open heart surgery. Significant obstructive coronary artery disease was defined as > or = 50% stenosis of > or = 1 major branch.\n\n\nRESULTS\nSeventy-six (58%) of 131 patients were found to have obstructive coronary artery disease. In 76 patients with significant coronary artery disease, 71 had thoracic aortic plaque. In contrast, aortic plaque existed in only 10 of the remaining 55 patients with normal or minimally abnormal coronary arteries. The presence of aortic plaque on transesophageal echocardiographic studies had a sensitivity of 93%, a specificity of 82% and positive and negative predictive values of 88% and 90%, respectively, for significant coronary artery disease. There was a significant relationship between the degree of aortic intimal changes and the severity of coronary artery disease (r = 0.74, P < 0.0001). Multivariate logistic regression analysis of patient age, sex, risk factors of cardiovascular disease and transesophageal, echocardiographic findings revealed that atherosclerotic aortic plaque was the most significant independent predictor of coronary artery disease.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThis study indicates that transesophageal echocardiographic detection of atherosclerotic plaque in the thoracic aorta is useful in the noninvasive prediction of the presence and severity of coronary artery disease.","inCitations":["d6832d6f594761e7735c74a041b2d84df28e74f2","932f9ad6a15f61ef208bda2f4a558cc0a2699d88","1288854dcc20effd5f79ca7b4a8ad10eff4ce049","b8fe4b3eecc031c99fe3dc786e22f7c2e08ef340","8c130c4869c21c5d4d6c19f3af10607d842d569a"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.kjim.org/upload/42801399.pdf","http://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/pmc/9b/f6/kjim-14-2-20-4.PMC4531913.pdf"],"title":"Transesophageal Echocardiographic Detection of Thoracic Aortic Plaque Could Noninvasively Predict Significant Obstructive Coronary Artery Disease","doi":"10.3904/kjim.1999.14.2.20","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.3904/kjim.1999.14.2.20","venue":"The Korean journal of internal medicine"}

Mineralogical study showed that the main mineral phases are Francoise, beside calcite, gypsum clay and silica. The petrography of francolite shows that it is presented mainly in the form of pellets, ooliths and bioclsts, the matrix formed mainly from calcite, micro-quartz and anhydrite. The upgrading process causes enrichment of Francoise, clay and gypsum to some extent, and depletion of calcite and quartz. Thus the TCP increased from 52% in the original phosphate rocks and reaches 64% in the upgraded ores.

Marked changes in mitochondrial shapes were observed in cultured or subcultured astrocytes obtained from three species, including humans. As well, new types of organelles were observed: (i) numerous concentric membranes forming vesicles, which were termed multilamellar vesicles; and (ii) many vesicles gathering into membranous structures, which were termed multivesicular myeloid bodies. The number of abnormalities increased proportionally with increasing concentrations of the two aminoglycosides (streptomycin and gentamicin). The incorporation of peroxidase or albumin-gold complex in the abnormal vesicles showed that the endolysosomal system was involved in the formation of these vesicles. Our results show that: abnormal organelles are present in cultured astrocytes; these abnormalities are enhanced by streptomycin and gentamicin; and gentamicin induces more abnormalities than streptomycin. The binding of aminoglycosides to membrane phospholipids may explain the formation of the observed abnormalities in rat, sheep, and human cultured astrocytes.","inCitations":["89e94993886e7ecaba0a749ada461dc6a0c20a98","2c08ec7e4b194575f2c26e95b317a4fc2a570813","39bbc729c5d6ae3e4be367df8df55dd539d5cf07","3af86759c37bb0f8a4be687f74f4502d18d08bc3","d4de5250d0161528ec6cd432a63ba49bec7caee5","d6383a467e4a6e2a6c43aad573cae2f53633233e"],"pdfUrls":["https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0306452206011699","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306452206011699?dgcid=api_sd_search-api-endpoint"],"title":"Abnormal organelles in cultured astrocytes are largely enhanced by streptomycin and intensively by gentamicin","doi":"10.1016/j.neuroscience.2006.08.059","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroscience.2006.08.059","venue":"Neuroscience"}

However, it is not yet clear what controls the time-course (initiation and termination) of release. Various experiments indicated that the time-course is controlled by membrane potential per se. Consequently the phenomenological Ca-Voltage-Hypothesis (CVH) was formulated. The CVH was later embodied in a molecular level mathematical model, whose key predictions were affirmed experimentally. Nonetheless, the single most important basis for the CVH, namely that depolarization per se is needed to induce physiological phasic release, was challenged by two major experimental findings. (i) Release was induced by Ca2+ alone by means of Ca2+-uncaging. (ii) There was at most a small additional effect when depolarization was applied after release was induced by Ca2+-uncaging. Point (i) was dealt with previously, but additional conclusions are drawn here. Here we concentrate on (ii) and show that the experimental results can be fully accounted for by the molecular level CVH model, with essentially the same parameters.","inCitations":["089778bdee3c90188f0f014d2f98b6181e8fcd95","cdcc9e17dd187675bcc41ebf1b580c0a602bd172","e65f4129df4af0b739d8848db95040c0bed26a79"],"pdfUrls":["https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q51965232"],"title":"Release of Neurotransmitter Induced by Ca2+-Uncaging: Reexamination of the Ca-Voltage Hypothesis for Release","doi":"10.1007/s10827-005-0187-4","sources":["Medline","DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10827-005-0187-4","venue":"Journal of Computational Neuroscience"}

A criterion is provided which allows to calculate the range of weights most appropriate for starting the learning process. It is also shown that different interval sizes are needed for the different layers of weights in a network.","inCitations":["0398945b04a0d77d24047aa0989b1f7c8ce27144","87e9ef9612b64bd26fd53f0343e97b27eeb4bc16"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Optimal weight initialization for neural networks","doi":"10.1007/978-1-4471-2097-1_135","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4471-2097-1_135","venue":""}

The shift in T e with impurity concentration allows the individual thermodynamic vacancy formation parameters, h +, S +, h − and S −, to be measured. Assuming the temperature-independent Schottky parameters of Chandra and Rolfe (1970), we obtain h + = 1·256±0·008eV, S +=453±0·10k, h − = 1·334∓0.008eV and S − = 5·08∓0·10k.

In 1969, Lieberman and his group questioned the use of this time-honored term and proposed instead that eosinophilic granuloma be regarded as a separate and distinct entity which could present either as a singular (unifocal) lesion or as a multifocal process. The term, \"multifocal eosinophilic granuloma\" was, thus, suggested as a replacement for the designation formerly known as Hand-Schuller-Christian Disease. The remaining component of Histiocytosis X termed Letterer-Siwe Disease was felt to be a totally separate disorder unrelated to eosinophilic granuloma and best classified as a relatively aggressive reticuloendothelial malignancy. In this presentation, we wish to report a case of multifocal eosinophilic granuloma which has run a very interesting course over a total of almost 10 years from the time of initial symptoms to the present. The more recent classification of Lieberman will be employed throughout this presentation. We will also propose the hypothesis that in this case, multifocal eosinophilic granuloma may represent a sequela of acquired immune deficiency perhaps initiated by T-cell viral infection. The possibility that, in a susceptible host, development of eosinophilic granuloma may be triggered by contact with environmental agents will also be discussed.","inCitations":["69bac2076c82ead4485856839bab4a34b70f60ba","18cf6ed924d2067790c14cabc7327fc6e91695bd"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Multifocal eosinophilic granuloma: a clinical pathologic conference.","doi":"10.1111/j.1600-0714.1984.tb01448.x","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0714.1984.tb01448.x","venue":"Journal of oral pathology"}

Karl Wittfogel's thesis that centralized, andindeed despotic power, is needed to build and operate large-scale infrastructure has beensuperseded by a radically different post-modern discourse: The water users -- so long the“other” of the irrigation world -- need to take over management control from the state inorder to rescue the irrigation infrastructure from certain decay, and to protect thesustainability of the water resource.The reasons that reasonable observers view management transfer as necessary hasto do with both empirical assessments and institutional theory. On the empirical side,irrigation infrastructure in many countries is deteriorating due to the proximate causes ofbudget constraints in the administering agency, demoralized staff, corruption which leadsto inferior quality construction, and inappropriate initial designs. Theory suggests that itcould hardly be otherwise. The incentives facing irrigation agency staff as well as aidprofessionals in international donor agencies, are perverse (Ostrom 1995).Partly this situation is due to the nature of the goods which government agenciesare trying to control. Local resources -- including water and the associated infrastructure -- are common pool goods that are best managed through community cooperation. Evenone level upstream, in the conveyance system of secondary canals feeding the smallerirrigation communities, some kind of hybrid public organization that can harness marketforces (e.g., a public utility) is likely to be preferable to a conventional governmental lineagency (Picciotto 1995). But the other part of the problem with government agencies isthat they are often \"sick institutions\" (Klitgaard 1995) suffering from both structural andcultural maladies over and above their inappropriate mandates.Organizational problems of institutions can be addressed through training,management restructuring, etc. But the problem of agencies stretched beyond their realmof competence needs to be addressed by transferring part of their management functions.","inCitations":["c63d1a8092814c7ec9fca4f2166376b9dadf5b27","2d3872f22a90a17372761d2c64d5afb8066a5e0a","b3596fd7d16b51f886b959636f739845a771731f"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"TRANSFERRING IRRIGATION SYSTEMS FROM THE STATE TO USERS: Questions of Management, Authority, and Ownership 1","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

The basis of the method is to employ kernel principal component analysis (KPCA) prior to using principal component analysis (PCA) for mapping input space to a higher dimensional feature space through a non-linear map. The conversion of non-linear data by gaussian kernel (via radial basis function) into linear form for its simplification and application of PCA is referred as ’kernel trick’. The employed data sets include our Smart Cars data which are images of the moving vehicles and some other generic databases. The obtained results emphasize the representation of the multi-class objects in their feature spaces, how the features are separated among the object classes and classification results. We also introduce eigenvectors as a classifier in this paper and, therefore, the proposed method does not require any conventional classifiers for the classification. Eigendimension matching conforms whether an image feature is ’in-space’ or ’out-space’ by comparing the dimensional ranges. The experimental results show the robustness of the feature separation using kernel tricks with our car database that leads to the cars’ classification from its viewpoint. Further experiments with other generic databases and various traffic scenarios show the remarkable performance of separating and classifying objects of the the proposed method.","inCitations":["6a13b8af1d939235b976d05901da0c87187d521d"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.mukpublications.com/resources/ijcvb1-1-8.pdf"],"title":"Supervised Learning and Classification of Multi-class Objects Using Kernel Trick","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

In the late 1980s, the EU’s rural development policy shifted towards endogenous development, as introduced into the practice of rural development in the framework of the LEADER programme. The LEADER as the new model of rural development policy, the new paradigm of development focuses on participation, cooperation and utilization of the local resources. The basic institutions of implementation of the LEADER programme are the LAGs (Local Action Groups as local partnerships), which have a great role in the local development with their proactive operation. The impact assessment of the implementation of the LEADER approach showed that in spite of several positive examples, there are many factors which hinder the wide adoption of the features of the programme into practice, thus realization of results and impacts expected from it in the process of local development.

Streeter","ids":["52603479"]}],"journalName":"ABA Banking Journal","paperAbstract":"Three of the most passionate thinkers in the business mix it up over what it will take to succeed in financial services Stop here if you're looking for a prediction of, say, how many people will be doing their banking on cell phones in ten years. That's guesswork. Even five years is speculation. The real future of banking is an extension of the present, and, in fact, of the past. To address the future in realistic terms, therefore, you need to understand what in the present is changing or needs to be changed. From that foundation you can then make plans for one, two, maybe three years out. There are dozens people who would qualify to build that foundation. But we can't think of any three better than Tom Brown, Dick Kovacevich, and Jim McCormick. We were able to get them together in person in June to probe the present and future of financial services. The result of that spirited dialog, presented here condensed and edited for print, offers a combination of wry observations, thoughtful comments, and contending views. The latter was particularly evident in regard to the relative importance of market segmentation versus front-line execution. Thomas K. Brown is CEO of Second Curve Capital, a New York City-based financial services hedge fund he created last January. Most bankers will remember him as the candid and outspoken regional bank stock analyst at Donaldson Lufkin and Jenrette. After leaving DLJ, he spent about 18 months with Julian Robertson's Tiger Management hedge fund before starting his own. Richard Kovacevich, chairman and CEO, of Wells Fargo Corp., San Francisco, is arguably the most outspoken CEO of a top-ten bank. He is also among the most respected for what he did at the old Norwest and what he is now doing at the \"new Wells,\" which Norwest acquired in 1998. James McCormick is president of First Manhattan Consulting Group, New York City, which he helped found in 1980. FMCG, and McCormick himself, have long been known for keen analytical insights into the financial services business. Not a shy one in the bunch, as the following text amply demonstrates. NEW LAW, NEW ERA? Q. How big a factor will the new financial modernization legislation be to the future of banking? Kovacevich: The law was a defining moment that allows us all to truly understand that our past models are not where the future is and that we should abandon those things and think about financial services as the business we're in. The old segmentations are dead. We aren't pursuing our business based upon charter type, or who our regulator is, or what our product line is. We are differentiating our business by our unique relationship with the customer influenced by technology. That will turn into a [mix] of products and services that are not easily compartmentalized. McCormick: Financial modernization opens up opportunities for those who really excel at understanding customers and cross-selling to do even more than would otherwise be the case. That will be a challenge of major proportions. Brown: The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act in and of itself is not that important to the future of any financial services company. The ability to offer many products is not a positive. Banks already offer too many products. The majority of winners will increase their focus on products and on customers. Success will be about recognizing the need to change and the superior execution of whatever strategy a company chooses. Kovacevich: I'll make a projection. There are now only a handful of financial services companies that sell at or around the S&P 500. Five years from now it will be ten times that. Because people will start evaluating companies on the basis of financial services, which is a $2.1 trillion industry and growing very rapidly, as opposed to just the banking segment. That will cause p/e ratios for those companies that may have been broader than banking before, but were still defined by their old history and old charter to get close to the S&P 500. …","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Time to Start Planning for Biometrics","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Yet, knowledge about what these networks exactly encoded is still scarce. In this study we look into the content of those processes. We ask whether the neural representations of intentions are context- and reason-invariant, or whether these processes depend on the context we are in, and the reasons we have for choosing an action. We use a combination of functional magnetic resonance imaging and multivariate decoding to directly assess the context- and reason-dependency of the processes underlying intentional action. We were able to decode action decisions in the same context and for the same reasons from the fMRI data, in line with previous decoding studies. Furthermore, we could decode action decisions across different reasons for choosing an action. Importantly, though, decoding decisions across different contexts was at chance level. These results suggest that for voluntary action, there is considerable context-dependency in intention representations. This suggests that established invariance in neural processes may not reflect an essential feature of a certain process, but that this stable character could be dependent on invariance in the experimental setup, in line with predictions from situated cognition theory.","inCitations":["34869433ea63d341593f9bec58118d654850d4aa"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"The context-dependent nature of the neural implementation of intentions","doi":"10.1101/401174","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1101/401174","venue":""}

This system acquires EEG signals due to the left/right hand motor imagery among the normal subjects. For the processing of motor imagery EEG, we adopt the feature extraction method of second order moment in specific frequency band and the feature classification of linear discriminate analysis. Through the analysis of motor imagery EEG, we convert the data results into external control signal to control the movement of the cursor displayed on the computer. The experimental results show that the EEG analysis method makes it feasible and effective for disabled patients communicating with the outside world, and provides the basis for further study of brain-machine interface.

Much research on the welfare state emphasizes its institutional stickiness and immunity to major change. Yet, over the past two decades, governments in Germany, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom have introduced important reforms to their welfare regimes, enacting paid leave schemes, expanded rights to part-time work, and greater investments in child care. A comparison of these countries reveals a similar sequence of political and policy change. Faced with growing electoral instability and the decline of core constituencies, party leaders sought to attract dealigning voter groups, such as women. This led them to introduce feminizing reforms of their party structures and adopt policies to support mothers’ employment. In all three cases, women working within the parties played an important role in hatching or lobbying for these reforms. After comparing three countries that moved in a path-shifting direction, this article engages in a brief traveling exercise, examining whether a similar set of dynamics are lacking in two countries—Austria and Italy—that have moved more slowly in reforming these policies. Against the prevailing scholarly literature that emphasizes path dependence and slow-moving change, this article reveals the continued power of electoral politics in shaping redistributive policies.","inCitations":["83451abbb9f933a8522991ca8448a692ea766c7f","620f65eb39c0fd4847208c4f8d078c3df42c3640","65d3463d9bebad28e9ab8a114934e0cccbc0cbfe","61ecf779ffbb64dfa2277c35f31aaf9c585520de","d8aa59cc82981da1e2e8d1d0eaa9842e0215c079","af265119be1d60b3258e4714fdfa0d13a255100a","ad4ebac8e9c6b3532866b915ffbdc02d4a5c5069","643a0b86f5a144509f6b48dbd9c96d15e5dda284","dff8417e40853050485418131e79e6faa6ad949b","2708d6da52993ebea52a72bcaf386465eedf8b55","57a0dd49d293e1f3535dba3550d82297d3e70d2d","37a1635c52260df294a057a8f7c8fcfa25b89a08","bdd9b5cbec983649b7b08ef2e5c59af9e8da2952","5f99970392e9ac6704c3605dcf136f46b5ddd763","3a7369dfdd6c9fbfdbb10b345e7053fd8fc33041","69fda67f3b9f75d4d85da0dd9941f658131f634a","a332179776a9b2c076147601d263957e94cda023","583ddcd6f5fcdc33c41ecc571a6ef2a78ca3d48f","ed7ad76f3940c54bfe051e7c317cf0a5c5116623","be3d9c354a5162010892974cc5105a3bf2150c38","399a515c7f95d36002c77d6e3a79790a097515b3","27470c8093ec1119d188ba0eb1cabd7f6bfa0a36","0c43a3edbb3a8b665411755149557718511a9742","d87369bc0f227816d451ebafbc5185265d68f95f","8dedaa578ee5bfe8433be291b75f7811bb4f6d99","ac2a3ee23dbd8bbdeb731bad6a64609d5e4f4d25","2d9a4d32bed5b90e38a6c69eeafb9be390662adb","c61f997203a120240fc9895fef4848d89f41f015","690ffaaa45f90ac5cfc5326a1d65e78d547e3764","2faaf8ac23612995345c2a923ea53d28d9e14888","1fbecb87e4cecb9b1c21aa58940c27b7e49aaaf9","b5ea83ac01990238719b92f56a1a3be56c951188","ed990441ab1cffe1cfa2068f958e5b91a7061225","ebde1c021a7edb0b02fea588e6eab9dd66df64df","65f05d424f49040add0577b4206edd645d104cdf","a59f9a2c7b3f966f609dbfd7aa2b98f4ffbba8ee","257cf1d4db4adb961aa83c3a04e67269179bfac2","bd4b502161f9f18144361251a1c76667ce49e0d9","ebd1437aecda32aa058c8f46ad94296c78a68bb3"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Path Shifting of the Welfare State: Electoral Competition and the Expansion of Work-Family Policies in Western Europe","doi":"10.1017/S0043887112000251","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1017/S0043887112000251","venue":""}

Increasing nitrogen and potassium supply resulted in variable amounts of isothiocyanates, organic cyanides, sulphides and aldehydes measured by headspace analysis. Therefore it could be suggested that the desirable flavour of kohlrabi is influenced by the level of fertilisation. The effect of applied potassium on flavour quality is less clear cut. The observed inverse relationship between the amounts of flavour compounds and nitrogen supply might be utilised in production practices to obtain an optimal flavour quality.","inCitations":["b7ce5f6ec17c35c031aa50365be85f9074b2808a","9b8a5e0bc90c2e4c0048ae6288d292ebad2b9f6b","f3de355f3e507ef6ea75137dd43b66d10d0b09b6","29604ad40a4b2304fae429801b60a2a31db92105","f566f1517d361085f3a26118c13a3ace5c531355","cac6b93f8b9c9da3ea33031b11280756e5a8131b"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"The influence of different nitrogen and potassium fertilisation on the chemical flavour composition of kohlrabi (Brassica oleracea var gongylodes L)","doi":"10.1002/jsfa.2740600410","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1002/jsfa.2740600410","venue":""}

We sought to estimate the fractional excretion of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha in relationship to proteinuria in women with severe preeclampsia.\n\n\nMETHODS\nIn a cross-sectional study, we evaluated the serum and urine levels of TNF-alpha in 45 women diagnosed with severe preeclampsia (mean+/-standard error of the mean, gestational age 29.1+/-0.5 weeks). Forty-five healthy pregnant women matched for parity, maternal age, and gestational age at recruitment (30.1+/-0.4 weeks) made up the control group. Urinary concentrations were normalized to creatinine. The fractional excretion of TNF-alpha was interpreted in relationship to that of total proteins and soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 (sFlt-1).\n\n\nRESULTS\nWe found that the women with preeclampsia had significantly higher serum TNF-alpha concentrations compared with the women in the control group (mean+/-standard error of the mean, preeclampsia: 1.39+/-0.09 versus control: 0.93+/-0.07 pg/mL, P<.001). In contrast, urinary levels of TNF-alpha were significantly decreased in the women with preeclampsia compared with the healthy women (median [interquartile range], preeclampsia: 0.26 [0.10-0.91] versus control: 0.58 [0.21-1.29] pg/mg creatinine, P=.003), even though the hypertensive women had higher levels of proteinuria. In contrast to sFlt-1, urinary TNF-alpha did not correlate with the degree of proteinuria. Additionally, in preeclampsia, the fractional excretion of TNF-alpha was significantly lower (preeclampsia: 1.92% [0.46-4.20] versus control: 7.2% [2.44-12.07], P<.001).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe fractional excretion of TNF-alpha is significantly reduced in women with severe preeclampsia despite proteinuria. The decreased clearance and altered renal excretion of this cytokine may contribute to the exaggerated inflammatory response observed in preeclampsia.\n\n\nLEVEL OF EVIDENCE\nII.","inCitations":["59cfe29f3aa790365b03cc8425ae7343de76ccba","aa1ab96898100df8b2362c87dca00cc44b9d046a","c5e4301aa729adb08d3c3b8c0ed1e1258df6e4eb","ba5153ff287f43e759cb8ec065dcfe052a000978","d572cd35d9b0d3ba94a297a879d3d9b49a433077","ab617899b3856cb9fd951a4c78bcd7acfbcc2aa7","e66c000807b022d4625a8a9126d99b3177813aaa","b6d5f734dcb1483fdaa68942391d08cd9c188a09","12756430c47ea5d43138f7240ef2394ba41a69c0","f8f828720556fe3eb85007099e64dfb6e9b18d6a","3b6c37beb9027e434914b91a6da56ff860efc49e","b1044ce05d06b3323472d2ddff153558e0b5a091","8d8700efadc90c8aad63c0ccdb4875482f286dce","411abca3115653ccd1e52a25798dd7f8c2448d13","4b9198f5f25fed41c9a7e3ea3c659b5826436007","dcb1d84f04a98ec63dedc3926ad6c0da7884c094","b482772b36c260d69c2c197422a07401e76bb4c1","906eb7020d5dd6ebf91c838c00a3c989f0b2424c","97540ff15d7d985f6db9f9cb043f9581d357575a","a5dcd627333d435bbdb334a0e8e264d183dffa2f","028181106ca58246236592cbbbea520759932514","d15c6a9a4995fd38e2c406765b045094ea210aec","2a2e06c82e1c9161d5afb8a9042547d56d805c2a","8a8431de3163016193079f0fd0c217b5b4aa1103","12591d423d43da5b9ce62f75e66a25c5835e0087","bb8720c8ba01d188fe3077af48f70c8cd617a35e","1e4f36139ef437c341e564eb60fad85c0f6dbff6","55ba4bd2eb57474ba0456884c78e910193e95da8","bc73ce4b0cf56456349cc69600aab0dc96d5ab67","8146fee3f85c0eaaa717ad2f4b5987715491f0d3","718d3b7748879b0d673961b895c7b28828bcebe9","2b821c7467e82989e1e6df6b362049d7696ff38b"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Fractional excretion of tumor necrosis factor-alpha in women with severe preeclampsia.","doi":"10.1097/AOG.0b013e31817c4304","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1097/AOG.0b013e31817c4304","venue":"Obstetrics and gynecology"}

Human, psychologically detrimental aspects of this process were examined.

The construct of informational reception apprehension and existing scales provided a basis for developing a new foundation for measuring and assessing these difficulties. Long and short versions of a new information reception apprehension test for information technology (IRAT–IT) were developed and tested in relation to computers, Internet service, and time on-line. Richer assessment of underlying difficulties drawn from a receiver perspective resulted in reliable and valid scales that meaningfully related this type of information reception apprehension to information-from-technology behaviors. Suggested use in technologically advanced and technologically developing cultures is outlined.","inCitations":["b7373430c751878e2c8bf132f3cf7f5b538364bc","5d5218cfa101fdf64b63d5929ee9aca220024753","7a76e070bba6abd328dbfc9a8bb8a38bfa187eb6"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Informational Reception Apprehension and Information from Technology Aversion: Development and Test of a New Construct","doi":"10.1080/01463370500090845","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1080/01463370500090845","venue":""}

In this paper, we present a novel approach for enhancing human actions with a limited number of samples via structural average curves analysis. Our approach first learns average sequences from each pair of video samples for every action class and then gather them with original video samples together to form a new training set. Action modeling and recognition are proposed to be performed with the resulting new set. Our technique was evaluated on four benchmarking datasets. Our classification results are superior to those obtained with the original training sets, which suggests that the proposed method can potentially be integrated with other approaches to further improve their recognition performances.","inCitations":["dce3b1ebe0f0f8834e92fd07e5b6f944e50e6a87","7c948446e26587e784ca2695c9ed8b8f2ad066c5","8e25ba54d07f48e2a662ed1d6b7eea882e6f80a9"],"pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1007/s11760-018-1311-z"],"title":"Enhancing human action recognition via structural average curves analysis","doi":"10.1007/s11760-018-1311-z","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11760-018-1311-z","venue":"Signal, Image and Video Processing"}

We give a historically informed theoretical exposition of capital as the durable result of past production processes, transforming future production while not being transformed itself and associated with a particular economic actor. We then construct a taxonomy of the possible characteristics and location of intellectual capital in postindustrial production.","inCitations":["6643b6122d9fdb3a245acf6d49931e1712084c5e","3bdd3f0c41e3d1ec8ec3619bb39f59e380e79057","607d75c6f087680f71af7a7309538c570da04782","72cdaad3cf3f14d6e19eebc0cb5cffc6fff99f32","55156f66f76b8a075babe04e23c97b3f78f17ce9","9dcdc6c1626a54dc426df1d9754a1fe7249d9416","3de1018e4c7be250f06fdfe9d3c9fc18e2f9ddb6","777cf2235f13ddea0a4b1e53745c81dc89e91c28","1ca60275d6ff0cb4c60a87291ef3350cb4e2f33a","898ad450b575a6e90f8804f3337808a27668f975","313fe7cacbc0b05d741a6a90a0f2cc11503b7921","278d9ddc7de68b9b73ea161fc835f78c5d2de524","842d0270ac18a1f51da7e3826d999e120a2000e7","cb7fa5209441c69351561b1ba36b9b47a3d55e3e","f8dd47f94e6ed39d8d74de38ca30557a46382b6d","b58efa0e97a8a78ba6092f38b6778a9ebd2fbeaf","880051f86d15ade43b64ee8312a97cb532a5e76f","09bd167925af47b2f7afe74d4d2f128363d13cda","5d474b7de5351997e35b1520b36555ab955dc0fc","f2b5f8868b5a23335af75889a3c1fbf40c279a75","785479a7d00c66133c2764e9f8ad16200d609925","f4c26a8c7628d3cddbeceeddeae557960c48b940","4e654df43d2d3bc3e2d8e4c921ba55c75d45c529","348c19bd4bc928d17c5c198ced3aa8cb8d15184f","ec6830b8c7fd678ab027556702c914d4b3e03a09","5367ed388cab3e8042d4560233e409679ac29616","4a1a3a33e32c92fe9db5e29ca559f042ece4a30f","207e13c5bff5358cf235ff7de84627d9fc8f1639","c7401ce6f1eed12df76978206f7e9fbf40571d3f","f477df9e59eb92b00c02c0da01f46a323bf67072","f0e2809e0a9197cd97f8ed5be995fa7cc0ff6f62","4f073192e50be90c0e253d6689a26771f65008a4","363752311a0bc7916a25b203797894fef883bba3","198f7de670e8463e4180ff5007c4a69dfb11d14b","7257630f96b9bf2f400d153e964f4ff2d7f9fdbf","8e4441687a601a69a1f698e3326ab9fe8162df8f","2b27abe32728057c13cd7218ea9a81376c0031b9","6834d24fe285b46471d35516a99c81de3e25967e","eb16e105414ac1a35335a6264d2ea5fbf18c41ef","16b5dac4735c4061c8073cdf025393d96b3e050e","e577814781702c0da766bd39c15d4fda0c4fa047","497633cbac88f990bfb9843fe2e9f268866a7384","35a1495e56d0899f8d97eed89cfa594f18db195f","13724efaf38643f3cf7c1a8e892f5cf1f452acd8","f201f57edb06295f613699f2852d8c647c72d85c","77e6318cfc1cbb662c6b16db95ece0b13fd3da44","76246c2ee71f40d93a93d6c258f71aed7a55618a","d48edff93c99c7c662135b11ded5bc0912ad2c59","f8b2f73b8b8815f094cfb7335b3fac6a47c3944e","35ac56fc331ed542aeb8406d1f1967c1e94e8ae2","685df2f157f17c41093d9ef08f9470848608d918","7f69f41216ab0be331821c419ea8f08f5c0fe6f4","cd3bfca4e1d9d884573786903fe9a9b4bcbbdaf8","3a5fbf85fb6344d896bd117d164de718e5ca758a","b92d580e8c34c5e21a97ddf6e2091047f524e5db","edd387f9626714f75a398a4c89b3aeb92165072b","d276cf55553cc6e8eb34d7b186b9cd15d8749613","cc728d8d287f8e1cf6bd63d8b574f4e1397300a2","bde2329691ba3be542b2b7fd767d636dcab52a9a","1a6b95d5dd05d72c9c8b02ee6eede99dbf83bc6f","8b3b1e466c99984b28b4cd4e5c8482bccb3dbcdf","c3d0ff38ff46e1e272d7901c992077aab1e7ba4e"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Can Ideas be Capital?

This brief presents an efficient synchronization for embedded distributed multiprocessors. The proposed solution works in a completely decentralized request-response manner via explicit message exchange among the processing elements. Scalable lock and barrier synchronization algorithms, which are derived from the inherent distributed characteristics of the underlying architecture, are proposed to enable fair, orderly, and contention-free synchronization. We implement the proposed synchronization model in a distributed 32-core architecture with a commercial cycle-accurate SystemC simulation platform. Experimental results that show our proposed approach achieves ultralow synchronization latency and almost ideal scalability when the core count scales.","inCitations":["0a99d06b32e08d2bfbdb7f11f7654a43f9a319b9","3caf360aab3f990358d7ada4d46ec940854905ee","24bfe18669b8bbadd11e63b761087b8c5b521046","69c0cd8791a08aa513ad1ae81b16c78cc9164db3"],"pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2015.2408345","http://ieeemaster.com/2016/vlsi/Efficient%20Synchronization%20for%20Distributed%20Embedded%20Multiprocessors.pdf"],"title":"Efficient Synchronization for Distributed Embedded Multiprocessors","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2015.2408345","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2015.2408345","venue":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems"}

According to the nature of the analysed criteria the flowchart consists of two phases. Criteria used include hydrographical network, soil properties, terrain features, land use, etc. Some of them have strictly defined values (constraints), and other ranges within certain limits (factors). Limited criteria were analysed using rejection principle and influencing factors using proximity analysis and overlay methods. Selecting the potential sites using standard GIS analysis tools there was estimated about 3286 sites for possible wetlands with the mean area of inflow basin about 4 km 2 in the basins of water bodies at risk.

The National Radiological Protection Board (NRPB) recommends that \"CT examinations should only be carried out after there has been proper clinical justification for the examination of each individual by an experienced radiologist\". The aim of this study was to review the indications for body CT in a large acute hospital in order to identify groups of patients in whom CT might not be \"clinically justified\". We reviewed the age, sex and diagnosis of all patients undergoing CT of the abdomen and pelvis (including lumbar spine) in our department in 1992. All requests had been checked by a senior radiologist before booking. CT was performed in 1078 male patients and in 990 females. Patients examined for benign disease were younger (mean age 52 years) than patients with malignant disease (mean age 57 years). Of 915 examinations performed for benign disease, 293 (32%) were orthopaedic in nature and included 255 (87%) for back pain. CT was carried out for benign non-orthopaedic disease in 97 women under 50 years old, usually following other tests with inconclusive or normal results. 49 of these examinations were reported as normal. Of 191 patients who had more than one CT examination, 158 (83%) were undergoing follow-up for malignant disease. All 39 patients who underwent CT on three or more occasions had life-threatening conditions, either malignancy or complicated acute pancreatitis. We have been unable to find substantial numbers of patients in whom CT was performed inappropriately. Substitution of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for CT of the spine will help population dose reduction. The benign condition responsible for the largest radiation dose from CT is complicated acute pancreatitis, and it may be possible to substitute MRI for CT in these patients. Women under 50 years old with normal CT form an important group for clinical audit.","inCitations":["8ba1026c76c18cd711ec2bcbbfcfb70e607e3a1a","d51ae5527ae436a38e05106f42ad2329d2f4efcb","0d87b3c99853fcdf9532d196bc4282a08c6f481d","2d38552519bea6e367060d7b97d1563219ed162c","419f47bbd045936a1105df6958346fa21208ae54","a826116d07d563b97cb74746010d68bb7cd2e29e","1dcc0725b08503abdd61b4026605e22374d00eee","6e6e5c7a64ba9eed47c785f07b574194b9efdf7a","c6bc5471af65ce7e634926eacad7f307dd752c16"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Is computed tomography of the body overused?
