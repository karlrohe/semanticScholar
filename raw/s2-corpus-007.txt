The combined impact of advances in CLM and a better Arctic climate simulation, especially for air temperature, improve the permafrost simulation in CCSM4 compared to CCSM3. Present-day continuousplus discontinuous permafrost extent is comparable to that observed [12.5 3 10 6 versus (11.8‐14.6) 3 10 6 km 2 ],but active-layer thickness (ALT) is generallytoo thick and deep ground (.15 m) temperatures are too warm in CCSM4. Present-day seasonally frozen ground area is well simulated (47.5 3 10 6 versus 48.1 3 10 6 km 2 ). ALT and deep ground temperatures are much better simulated in offline CLM4 (i.e., forced with observed climate), which indicates that the remaining climate biases, particularly excessive high-latitude snowfall biases, degrade the CCSM4 permafrost simulation. Near-surface permafrost (NSP) and seasonally frozen ground (SFG) area are projected to decline substantially during the twenty-first century [representative concentration projections (RCPs); RCP8.5: NSP by 9.0 3 10 6 km 2 , 72%, SFG by 7.1 3 10 6 , 15%; RCP2.6: NSP by 4.1 3 10 6 , 33%, SFG by 2.1 3 10 6 , 4%]. The permafrost degradation rate is slower (2000‐50) than in CCSM3 by ;35% because of the improved soil physics. Under the low RCP2.6 emissions pathway, permafrost state stabilizes by 2100, suggesting that permafrost related feedbacks could be minimized if greenhouse emissions could be reduced. The trajectory of permafrost degradation is affected by CCSM4 climate biases. In simulations with this climate bias ameliorated, permafrost degradation in RCP8.5 is lower by ;29%. Further reductions of Arctic climate biases will increase the reliability of permafrost projections and feedback studies in earth system models.","inCitations":["c7576ed045e089a23b54a953a16dacd08e8cd713","ad04b1834a695350b732d66f59fe64d8d0f0f1c3","7c157740ae86331f8991bb84ae62b78c2677b28c","7c38792b2514e547b068a60dfc0f23d4dc821180","5e1e5a8c0510729d658c51f66ddf231431861fb6","48b928ebfaf3bc9370d37409ff7fd2cd43493379","46b2981df684d70ef37124bf38ae588d6d97a27c","927df39e42c5d7dac60782784202fe11d9212278","e19cd8117331ca2fcacb6b1f5413619fca07d465","14f54039b762c767ed23a94e0e4bf4fb6d69827e","b93c1969f76f951e4c5539942d686cd6360d33d3","e91b5cc06c85c7c195300138c7c3c0645afb8b9c","8b0b77cef8bfa5da0e4af65986be8925436cd71e","35b00c5bdb5527ed6e8d2979a7aa55ec5348803a","28abedb6aa05d3538e7770d368a2d25f14467019","5f5c1dc3867270aee7c2c04ab6749d656b8023c5","f2d681332c9fdf95a2c6d309134d991141d3578b","50195382bde2fb178b1b1995e42f583fdd55095e","574c988db3264b0c8d25568b193815d2957948d5","c24911a9fc3f9358024cf9ab379fd94b33bd0452","5cae227ef145d2deb42bcceccbaf9e159bca0982","897a8e71dc61dbbe4f959d016bfc7913cdce48c9","ba1b22cbab031e7cdd02f18069f6390acbc3ede1","2c81c2fd8619791c9199f6c22b6f0ff8102e9dba","52944d2d3168128931f99b4da426d32e0b82b2cd","31716fce975458fe048fffb61e982ca9ebbd5a68","b32c11904bb2999dc39fc892660db21cf374f45b","db3dad23ca7bc3cf017aa1524b28f06427e119f4","2f7c228a577bbddf358d66160deeefe5507ff90d","55428143b25141a8c776bece57c807826aa06844","99a4f5dfde357cefff51df83e66c15afd2b41100","901272caf5d43b8d30a2595b49db6b59be5f12e6","742818b12076542b7f3f3e1b5c776471ded9c2b3","0a9588e46fd5cbdfa1ca35477a5a360f4dd8718a","9e90ba4ded6e31d68fdfa27164a3c6a83e387522","c00698d9c65216de688150bde09d4dfb945084a3","91da49612a8b413cf8457b56ce22901a4475ee4a","5417e1e5eea6ab296c556b09cb47bd67b9a27847","dd437f97bef9e88148abf58026b815573cb52735","3f79c8ad12308c58b70a1c2f7dc800522d28c476","e7e521a23b4716673c001993c610939c4e5f8a9f","99ba7dc5e2e1db1e4e2dd3559212d836f8b5a29c","1394a3e1def7832a4cd007b5ea4e4724f9a68421","a8c6393a66e8748f3491267c80ddb272235df38c","bd11a9a7c1cdd29282c5e10b55d06dabab7f7b32","d4ea808e83fb2512701f2da12db1094aaa072a99","b78ceb9e9c0371ea80ebbc2a46324d818d4c7574","a62ebae8a745e61d84328add9f6a6d960e71de77","c8b6268681990d69c066737c7f8ee76d73bd94b9","80820482f1d2b69a4fdbf20546a434100283bd89","e868e4aa1757f08f9434d4371647cc503970443d","b2fc62a263fad33b6a69680896bf50dfed3cd963","6217846b2dfc7d7527d0de267e4cdb5634fa6b16","1e23c6bb6dc9d8b9ad4439adf05c63b48e9e6972","056482c02448b29cff3278a2a06ee372a08014f2","b92988590840a44735f5b77f2c2a8f0c26c42764","637c8c7f2e419d9463bac48aa3404b3734373682","61e04de496b95cb7edf3568ae88b8169e6028dac","cdf44cbcedd558def9b83bcfc69bc10bcc7969d6","b4abbbb771dd37c77df5e503db858e001da78548","67fdeb5b932158b1f6b95aff387b3b202fff25d6","673fa0feff3c80885c8cfa893ecd101420f5b554","18e935473eed952095abd988cc2ec70f3a0e1cc3","84ee823a9f4b4dca7366a9a9ea9da35c2aa35eab","64b52950f57543626ef630ec540f68f16597e4e6","3b0710a211f2e83e6d2bcc241e0d8b7010596980","faf9dbcc9b3cd19f3fdf495c23d3f821c2c7bee2","51899b18d287b2b395ce52457f5a9dcf6ee28fed","842641be542283277729c6c51c18c41a64f2454f","213da997e7a869e4f240fdc6c66662ee8423cfb3","6aa622e6592be946589cf9f42c155f2d57a285a4","bdbbc009f55cf6e4bd4a7c71e792be0bcb037fe4","52549f1dbb0bc86a4792d1fbfff9afc28406bbcc","596a0b63e7feb8d1ee775ac2e7302388ad3fedb7","261910798b8cb13d887fec07aae2a51e9535d81c","982bc51de8207dcfd8c3f6a472bab38d78fb91b0","b0b868817155476fc230699854e92b0921a6d277","750e2e67c9c8b4ab78064567a6a62d952e9ebef8","fff7e95fdddc81653392a3dd0894f6d1ea5bbe5c","26055a512d2e77173eadb1155346d4959f67d7a5","a855b6472af5009a3738f38713ced72dbcc07efb","d930ee845c991386fe138adc68f71bda9a857694","0b3ec2dc5299d9f015bcd2b6d8310ce00c02408f","f19138c600f342a44fc8a60a3b95fd0bcb73def3","235f788915f94af17eb1f8676f8a6ca463b52eb5","8eeae631ada92c9c134c52fd4212a0a79b95fb6f","1ebfea90e0622525d4829e688ec8b7100ee47b94","59ac9b3302e092ee5008f5d79bb550363b553bd8","d033dce1a0b88f18f200b06a0c0b15999f8d6827","278968267f3a7df0f75d84f9cd4a009dae8a589c","8ff4e3ee4ecc212bbb12e637d5e59b45a12afb8c"],"pdfUrls":["http://opensky.ucar.edu/islandora/object/articles:11914/datastream/PDF/download/citation.pdf"],"title":"Simulation of Present-Day and Future Permafrost and Seasonally Frozen Ground Conditions in CCSM4","doi":"10.1175/JCLI-D-11-00334.1","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1175/JCLI-D-11-00334.1","venue":""}

Usually, in an unknown environment, this problem is addressed by applying Simultaneous Localization and Mapping based on metric grid-maps. However, such maps are in general rather computational expensive and do not scale well. Insects are able to cover large distances and reliably find back to their nests, although they are quite limited in their resources. Inspired by theories on insect navigation, we developed a data structure which is highly scalable and efficiently adapts to the available memory during run-time. Positions in space are memorized as snapshots, which are unique configurations of landmarks. Unlike conventional snapshot or visual map approaches, we do not simply store the landmarks as a set, but we arrange them in a tree-like structure according to the relevance of their information. The resulting navigation solely relies on the direction measurements of arbitrary landmarks. In this work, we present the concept of the Landmark-Tree (LT) map and apply it to a mobile platform equipped with an omnidirectional camera. We verify the reliability and robustness of the LT-map concept in simulations as well as by experiments with the robotic platform.","inCitations":["7727c5222856a3d61db851cf9b76e14733f978ba","5748d5e62cbf2d5332c4a826c07960561495ff55","1456397d1c1563862210a4f9b43fef95f998c949","de75a66d32c84342cd0d3e775d5e7315d26f5ad9","e9533b508afa175d8e72e1c2806e8b6f0173bb66","12672b01e7681449a556a1105f24179be2a7b72e","a9498b3262e82303ad4c7df96296d2c8b451e533","3b69987b59dd9b3c97ed28bf32e626f46d39d1ea","a1f225add2b0de9a34af8327a57a73d94202eed4"],"pdfUrls":["http://elib.dlr.de/88600/1/LT-Map_preprint.pdf","http://www6.in.tum.de/Main/Publications/BuMa03.pdf","http://www6.in.tum.de/Main/Publications/BuMa04.pdf","https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q58026724"],"title":"A biologically inspired navigation concept based on the Landmark-Tree map for efficient long-distance robot navigation","doi":"10.1080/01691864.2013.871770","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1080/01691864.2013.871770","venue":"Adv.

Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses supported the validity of the proposed framework and the use of items with clearly implied outcomes. Furthermore, newly developed scales reflecting constructs representing increasing non-gains via approach and increasing non-losses via avoidance meaningfully expanded the approach-avoidance construct space. The current study also suggested contamination by implied outcomes does not invalidate approach-avoidance scales where reward/punishment context is specified. Finally, results indicated assessing an “effective avoidance” motivational orientation significantly and uniquely predict overall job performance.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://isiarticles.com/bundles/Article/pre/pdf/126671.pdf"],"title":"Measuring approach-avoidance motivation: Expanding dimensionality through implied outcomes","doi":"10.1016/j.paid.2016.10.033","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.paid.2016.10.033","venue":""}

The prothallial plates formed in 20 days after inoculation and the establishment of apical cell was later. After the formation of the prothallial plate, profuse unicellular hairs occurred on both the surfaces and margin of the prothalli. The young prothalli developed in 60 days after inoculation and the mature prothalli are cordate-thalloid. The sex organs formed in 65 days after inoculation. The antheridia appeared about 10 days earlier than archegonia. Archegonial neck usually inclines or curves towards the base of the prothallus at maturity.

Many other elements are simultaneously deposited in these annual layers, and are assumed to be essentially immobile. Three nuclear analytical techniques, the proton microprobe (,-PIXE), instrumental neutron activation analysis (INAA), and oc-track autoradiography were used to determine the temporal history of concentrations of elements in shells of the freshwater pearl mussel, Margaritifera margaritifera (L.), from four rivers in central Sweden. The high spatial resolution (3,m) of ,u-PIXE allows analyses of samples representing small parts of single years. Thirty elements were identified and quantified using INAA technique. Elemental concentrations in old samples (from 1860) were similar to those from young specimens (1970-85). Silver, gold, iron and cobolt decrease strongly and manganese and sulfur increase in connection with acidification after 1940. The present study indicates that shells of living mussels, together with museum or subfossil shell material may be used to date environmental changes caused by natural events and large-scale industrial, agricultural or nuclear contamination.","inCitations":["2079ad4945ec7e39470c4e399651d6da67779960","e96bc9053b564b608fcac44d5d07de77972e41e0","1dc0d0cf82cce7fb623f8869b9c9c204b6cd84b0","38aa35c530f52c3a23c0ac1e3c0d9977797a0b14","fe618d55cf51355b8b3fdc729c7dd5367e812bee"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"can Mussel Shells Reveal Environmental History","doi":"10.1016/0198-0254(87)90370-0","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/0198-0254%2887%2990370-0","venue":""}

Early relapse, defined as relapse within less than 18 months from time of initial diagnosis, is associated with a second CR rate of about 50% and an overall survival of 10% or less (Stahnke, K. et al. Leuk 1998). The second generation purine nucleoside analog clofarabine was designed to improve on the efficacy and safety of cladribine and fludarabine. Interest in assessing the utility of clofarabine in the treatment of pediatric patients with AML was stimulated by its Food and Drug Administration approval for the treatment of pediatric patients with relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia previously treated with at least 2 regimens. We report on our experience using clofarabine in 6 pediatric patients with relapsed AML, 4 of whom achieved complete remission (CR) with this single agent (Table 1). All patients received clofarabine IV at the recommended dosage of 52 mg/m 2 /day ′ 5 days, with cycles repeated every 2 to 6 weeks depending on count recovery. Patient 1 , who had Dandy Walker Syndrome and never achieved CR with prior therapies, received clofarabine after she relapsed 6 months following a bone marrow transplant (BMT); she achieved CR after 2 treatment cycles. Despite CR, the condition of this severely ill patient worsened and she died following multiple organ failure, pneumonia, and sepsis. Patient 2 obtained a CR after the first cycle of clofarabine and the CR continues after 7 cycles. However, the original plan to maintain this patient on clofarabine for 1 year was not achieved because of chronic thrombocytopenia requiring platelet transfusions. Patient 3 achieved a CR after one cycle of clofarabine and received one additional cycle of clofarabine as maintenance while awaiting BMT. Patient 4 had a CR with one cycle of clofarabine following a relapse after a first BMT. The patient received 2 additional cycles of clofarabine as maintenance before proceeding to a 2 nd BMT. This patient relapsed after the second BMT and is currently receiving induction with clofarabine. Patients 5 and 6 had not responded well to previous treatments and failed to respond to a single cycle of clofarabine. Patient 5 never achieved CR despite gemtuzumab and BMT. Patient 6 had an unsustained CR2 with gemtuzumab and failed subsequent therapies. Our experience indicates that single-agent clofarabine as induction therapy can provide durable CRs in pediatric patients with relapsed AML and provide a bridge to subsequent BMT.

Although ethnographers are supposed to devote themselves to collecting any single sample of native spreech, these may turn out to be more of a nuisance than anything else. Things get even worse when this piece of new knowledge does not fit the theoretical pattern the ethnographer has elaborated or relies upon to explain the facts he studies. These are the moments when, against all odds, the informant speaks too much: we cannot easily assimilate the atypical elements which he is supplying us with. W e would like to throw them away as, at a particular point during the production process of a movie, the director disregards some sequences or cuts some of the ends of these sequences off when the acting begins to deteriorate, to lose its zest. And yet, such moments are the crucial ones for the ethnographer, the ones which in fact allow the experience to proceed.

Since 1970, some trade unionists have been making use of European legislation to improve legal norms and build a strong body of case law. They have developed legal expertise and detailed knowledge of the practicalities of the law and have supported numerous claims. However this use of litigation has not developed consistently over time and across unions. Litigation has been quite controversial within the trade union movement. This article seeks to investigate what are the conditions under which some trade unionists have decided to rely upon litigation to further their female members’ interests, depending on the time period. The article emphasises the crucial role these local trade unionists have played in the development of equal pay litigation. The paper builds on a ‘developmental approach’ that differentiates several ‘stages’ or phases in which union’s litigation strategies for equal pay figure differently.","inCitations":["872f764dd648c07c93313d8490379038d3689d34","fc5e5bacda126db28d056aa89b54a05bb1bc1ae8","cbd388c774d50c205dedac74fce68492ae2f458d","66d2bdff18e5b95526333e7ef2f6077fc7be5a1e","1e5d53df472b9289611fab51bbfcd33af2f0f8d9"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Understanding the variations of unions’ litigation strategies to promote equal pay: reflection on the British case.","doi":"10.1093/cje/bev004","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1093/cje%2Fbev004","venue":""}

Since resistance to human serum is necessary for DGI, we examined the mechanism of resistance by GC to NHS. Our bactericidal assay exposes 10-fold dilutions of 10 8 plate-grown GC/ml to undiluted serum and measures the number of GC the serum can kill. Killing is expressed as the reduction in GC compared with paired, heat-decomplemented controls. NRS sterilized >10 5 GC/ml of six DGI strains. When NRS was mixed (1:1) with nonbactericidal NHS, killing was reduced to 3 GC/ml. This potent inhibitor of rabbit serum could be adsorbed to preincubated and washed GC. The heat (65°C) lability of the inhibitor suggested blocking antibody. Human cord serum containing maternal IgG, but no IgM or IgA, blocked rabbit serum as effectively as normal adult or matched maternal serum. IgG fractions added to rabbit serum reduced killing of DGI strains, but IgM and IgA did not. Absorption of NHS with resistant strains increased killing of the same and other resistant strains and removed the ability to block killing by rabbit serum. Absorption with sensitive strains decreased killing. Thus, resistant strains adsorb blocking antibody and sensitive strains adsorb killing antibody. We conclude that NHS contains an IgG blocking antibody that competes with natural bactericidal antibody in man and rabbits. We believe that natural IgG binds to certain gonococci possessing the appropriate receptor and enables them to disseminate in the blood by protecting them from killing by antibody and complement.","inCitations":["60dfd81f5913370a35a9b962c26939b88695d802","d31ff8724cf2aed8b1535b18d67b04c981f58658","15a8ddd6e67a3e7e25e1760c95e3a31df1d56d06","ec9110512a6aa03622120469a48ff7859fc85008","e27251fb7bbf9215c9a27f9dafe6f5e0c37f804e","fcca34fe1308947e2a8ea828def3ed0b4925ab99","242a7d5f79b72cfac53d74997ac2095fe0f6130c","d971f58efb4eb47aca50d2b6ea9cf87823a718ea","173cb5479411d12f13a56467d1e977a77c282d93","d4a245e2f7df56352100672291395a1d0f2d2c1b","c8c47bf3f95f7467e08c77fb886c47eae1326d63","fb24e5ad26c639b9acc5042d937bd05077f11e1f","a5fec0f6fbbbfaf37141f3c7747f88e728fdcaf9","734e2d819b979dfa3ef0a501a247f27a09dd0394","5d936c55bf5d31408d063fd2ef6f1056dc90b375","b4c36c5b2a8b61ddb032ba99c45dd346cb0d68c3","02b44e0388c44cba70176ac1c4a8c03b69f66d09"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Role of blocking antibody in disseminated gonococcal infection.","doi":"","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"Journal of immunology"}

We investigate the mechanism that gives rise to self-exciting oscillations at the micro level. The system dynamics is calculated using the multilevel kinetic Monte-Carlo method in real time. A grid with several millions of points is used. We show that the reason for the appearance of oscillations is lateral interactions in the adsorbate layer, which speed up the reaction and slow down the desorption processes. The reaction occurs in the form of a periodic surface explosion; as a result, the adsorption layer either fills almost the entire surface or is almost completely stripped from the surface. We investigate the effect of the migration rate on the realization of kinetic oscillations in the microscopic model. Analysis of films from the surface of the lattice model has shown that in the course of the observed reaction “eddies” are constantly born and destroyed in different parts of the surface. With certain special initial conditions, the model leads to excitation of plane traveling and spiral waves.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Monte-carlo simulation of the oscillatory dynamics of a catalytic reaction with lateral interactions","doi":"10.1007/s10598-013-9196-8","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10598-013-9196-8","venue":""}

Although our previous 6-month follow-up revealed early modest improvement, an extension of that follow-up to 1 year disclosed no additional gains in any patient. At the end of 1 year, only one patient could be categorized as moderately improved; three patients were mildly improved, and four patients were unimproved. The rationale for transplanting adrenal medulla was to reestablish a physiologic source of dopamine to the striatum. We measured cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma catecholamines and metabolites before and after transplantation. Conjugated dopamine (the predominant form of dopamine found in the CSF) and homovanillic acid (the major dopamine metabolite) were modestly and inconsistently increased in the CSF. Conjugated and free epinephrine and norepinephrine, as well as 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol concentrations were not increased in CSF after graft placement, an indication that the adrenal chromaffin cells were no longer producing high levels of these nondopamine catecholamines and metabolites. CSF cortisol concentrations were not increased after transplantation, compared with values from controls, consistent with low numbers of functioning adrenal cortical cells contaminating the graft (or poor survival). Posttransplantation CSF did not induce a neurotrophic effect in cell cultures of 15-day embryonic rat dorsal root ganglion or PC12 (rat pheochromocytoma) cell lines. Survival of samples of patients' adrenal medullary tissue for 2 weeks in tissue culture attested to the viability of the graft at the time of transplantation. The relative concentrations of dopamine to epinephrine or norepinephrine increased in these cultured adrenal medullary cells, presumably because of loss of the glucocorticoid influence on catecholamine synthesis. A wide variety of factors could have contributed to our failure to replicate the earlier impressive results of adrenal-to-brain transplantation reported by others. Continued transplantation studies in animal models of parkinsonism are necessary for better elucidation of these factors.","inCitations":["38139d0e51f980c6ebf31a8912d47da2d760890a","91bd5e8dbb7661c1e817ba77c9675d76e229e1c0","2eee5c1a2112690c8a444b0f9f1a61ee42c1e679","c9f653386a73dd6f1b164dd1490a1ef5b5009516","7012c43bc7d3f6dfcba8204cf24fadf75b24ceb0","81127f70d3c047757224e599c55ef6cf2f6da12f","0343cbca8986eeba445168d883b41e0881fe2b9a","d44754a01f02223f8f54fd927af75a233dabf1a6","fbce46cc7f23a4c6fb5b0c95863d46ffacf1868e"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Adrenal medullary transplantation into the brain for treatment of Parkinson's disease: clinical outcome and neurochemical studies.","doi":"10.1016/S0025-6196(12)62532-4","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/S0025-6196%2812%2962532-4","venue":"Mayo Clinic proceedings"}

In the present study, a kind of floor with SSPCM is put forward which can absorb the solar radiation energy in the daytime or in summer and release the heat at night or in winter. In this paper, the thermal performance of a room using such floor、wall and ceiling were numerically studied. Results show that the average indoor air temperature of a room with the SSPCM floor was about 2 K to 4 K higher than that of the room without SSPCM floor, and the indoor air temperature swing range was narrowed greatly. This manifests that applying SSPCM in room suitably can increase the thermal comfort degree and save space heating energy in winter.

Based on our experimental results we construct a phase diagram where structural behavior and superconducting properties of FeSe are found to be correlated. We show that below 6 GPa, where pressure promotes the superconducting critical temperature, the FeSe structure is composed of 2D layers of edge-shared FeSe4 tetrahedra, while above 6 GPa the superconductivity is strongly suppressed on formation of a new orthorhombic polymorph characterized by a 3D network of face sharing FeSe6 octahedra. Therefore changes in topology and connectivity of the FeSe structure are found to be detrimental for superconductivity to exist. This previously controversial crystal structure of the high pressure polymorph of FeSe was also unambiguously determined. High pressure FeSe adopts an orthorhombic MnP-type structure (Pnma) which corresponds to a slightly distorted hexagonal NiAs-type arrangement (P63/mmc). The structural transformation from the low- to high-pressure FeSe polymorph is first order in nature and is manifested as antiparallel displacements within the Fe and Se sublattices.","inCitations":["dffe393afcb1bf7e1429d5517694c13e0bf3432d","f243daa28ff7641f99fb90759058ad9fcbe25888"],"pdfUrls":["https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.07768v3.pdf"],"title":"Complex biphase nature of the superconducting dome of the FeSe phase diagram","doi":"10.1103/PhysRevB.96.014520","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.96.014520","venue":""}

Thus, mango peel was effective against \ndevelopment of diabetic cataract mainly through augmentation of antioxidant \nlevels, inhibition of polyol pathway enzymes and AGEs formation in lens of \ndiabetic rats. \nPRACTICAL APPLICATIONS \nOxidative damage to the constituents of eye lens is considered to be the major \nmechanism for development of various types of cataract and intake of food rich in \nantioxidants has been reported to delay progression of cataract. Mango peel is a \nby-product of mango pulp processing industry and is rich in antioxidants and \nexhibits antidiabetic properties. This study found that mango peel supplemented \ndiet delayed the progression of diabetic cataract formation. Thus, mango peel can \nbe supplemented in foods for management of diabetes and its complications.","inCitations":["dea06249d25edf842f67242e25efa7ffb01e78a6"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Supplementation of Mango (Mangifera indica L.)

The experimental value, c.- 2.0 V v. s.c.e., is more negative than the value calculated by assuming the absence of localized surface charge, -0.35 V v. s.c.e. For a given electrolyte, Epb depended on the crystal orientation, and became more negative in the order (111), (110), (111). These results are consistent with specific adsorption of anionic selenide species on surface cadmium atoms. For a freshly prepared CdTe electrode, Efb depended on the selenide ion concentration in a Nernstian manner, consistent with sub-monolayer adsorption of HSe-. In contrast, when electrodes had been exposed to selenide electrolytes for several days, Efb was less dependent on the selenide ion concentration, in some cases being constant over four orders of magnitude of [Se2-]. Such results were consistent either with saturation of the surface with adsorbed ions, or with pinning. As the electrolyte was oxidized, Ub increased linearly with Eredox, reached a maximum value at -0.81 V v. s.c.e., and then decreased, so that neither the ideal model nor the Fermi level pinning model applied. Models which assumed adsorption only of HSe- were inconsistent with the observed behaviour, but the results were explained quantitatively by a model which assumed the competitive adsorption of HSe- and Se on the semiconductor surface. Such a model was consistent also with the independence of Efb and the total selenide concentration observed in some experiments. .The largest built-in potential observed was 1.23 V. An improved method of preparing CdTe electrodes is described.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"On the flat-band potential of n-type cadmium telluride in alkaline selenide, polyselenide electrolytes","doi":"10.1071/ch9870723","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1071/ch9870723","venue":""}

Coronary stenting reduces the need for repeat procedures. Abciximab or stents individually are considered cost effective interventions. There is a need to quantify the economic value of the combination of abciximab and stenting over stenting alone.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA decision analytic model was developed incorporating the outcomes from the EPISTENT study. Costs from Canadian sources for hospitalization, procedures and medications were used. Life expectancy was estimated using a Markov model. Total expected costs and outcomes of the abciximab and stent vs. stent alone were compared in an incremental analysis. The perspective of the analysis was a Canadian teaching hospital.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe acquisition cost for abciximab was partially offset by reduced costs for managing clinical events resulting in a net incremental cost of 1,076 dollars per patient over one year (8,617 dollars combination vs. 7,541 dollars stent alone). This added cost was accompanied by a reduction in large MI or death by an absolute rate of 5.7% at one year (5.3% combination vs. 11.0% stent alone), yielding an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of 18,877 dollars per death or large MI averted.

History: Sydenham, in 1675, was the first to describe scarlet fever as a distinct disease. At that time scarlet fever and diphtheria were very often confused. Occurrence: The disease is more prevalent in autumn and spring months, usually endemic, but occurring occasionally in epidemics. Etiology: The specific cause of the disease is a hemolytic streptococcus. The two Doctors Dick of Chicago, in 1923-24, were the first to satisfy Koch's postulates, apparently proving that a specific streptococcus hemolyticus was the cause of scarlet fever. The disease may occur at any age but it is most common in children, young adults and in individuals subject to throat infections.

The current interest lies in the unraveling of a disorder-to-order transitioning code embedded in the amino acid sequences of IDPs/IDPRs. Disordered proteins are characterized by an enormous amount of structural plasticity which makes them promiscuous in binding to different partners, multi-functional in cellular activity and atypical in folding energy landscapes resembling partially folded molten globules. Also, their involvement in several deadly human diseases (e.g. cancer, cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases) makes them attractive drug targets, and important for a biochemical understanding of the disease(s). The study of the structural ensemble of IDPs is rather difficult, in particular for transient interactions. When bound to a structured partner, an IDPR adapts an ordered conformation in the complex. The residues that undergo this disorder-to-order transition are called protean residues, generally found in short contiguous stretches and the first step in understanding the modus operandi of an IDP/IDPR would be to predict these residues. There are a few available methods which predict these protean segments from their amino acid sequences; however, their performance reported in the literature leaves clear room for improvement. With this background, the current study presents ‘Proteus’, a random forest classifier that predicts the likelihood of a residue undergoing a disorder-to-order transition upon binding to a potential partner protein. The prediction is based on features that can be calculated using the amino acid sequence alone. Proteus compares favorably with existing methods predicting twice as many true positives as the second best method (55 vs. 27%) with a much higher precision on an independent data set. The current study also sheds some light on a possible ‘disorder-to-order’ transitioning consensus, untangled, yet embedded in the amino acid sequence of IDPs. Some guidelines have also been suggested for proceeding with a real-life structural modeling involving an IDPR using Proteus.","inCitations":["813424e52a59eac1043b84ca116a4f3e11ee47e1","7a5825777a55641905e8279e02cdc7111b0f8eae","a49e3d791d19d59756368a38ca0f96f2cef88f6e","2295cac64571f2eef5dd0c86d066d6bcf75bded8","97d7ec12b3cc8b55935c359dcbbb72459180577c","f60e56e45ac12f94c5e54e9a75d1a8b89c2e7216","bf91ead8b0d49922dab952aa7f96e1480578289c","fa3bbc7fe3fd75eacf07ba3ec703f9b0b15dbffc","d30c6390f58bc70f77a958c458de838302b51651","de771bddcdbad4c10128f80d7f418cf70eda7825","db64979702adb667df53307bfae04ddca6f6d268"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1109100/FULLTEXT01.pdf","http://biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2016/10/14/080788.full.pdf","https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q30400560"],"title":"Proteus: a random forest classifier to predict disorder-to-order transitioning binding regions in intrinsically disordered proteins","doi":"10.1007/s10822-017-0020-y","sources":["Medline","DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10822-017-0020-y","venue":"Journal of Computer-Aided Molecular Design"}

Here we investigated the novel, orally available PKC-inhibitor enzastaurin for its anti-MM activity. Enzastaurin specifically inhibits phorbol ester-induced activation of PKC isoforms, as well as phosphorylation of downstream signaling molecules MARCKS and PKCmu. Importantly, it also inhibits PKC activation triggered by growth factors and cytokines secreted by bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs), costimulation with fibronectin, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), or interleukin-6 (IL-6), as well as MM patient serum. Consequently, enzastaurin inhibits proliferation, survival, and migration of MM cell lines and MM cells isolated from multidrug-resistant patients and overcomes MM-cell growth triggered by binding to BMSCs and endothelial cells. Importantly, strong synergistic cytotoxicity is observed when enzastaurin is combined with bortezomib and moderate synergistic or additive effects when combined with melphalan or lenalidomide. Finally, tumor growth, survival, and angiogenesis are abrogated by enzastaurin in an in vivo xenograft model of human MM. Our results therefore demonstrate in vitro and in vivo efficacy of the orally available PKC inhibitor enzastaurin in MM and strongly support its clinical evaluation, alone or in combination therapies, to improve outcome in patients with MM.","inCitations":["3b0f02dafebe51278166c8c6349bd3b180864113","2eeed5987961e2574901398f3dc3f78d48495e8e","c881ea7e3847c047446c858cd609466e95e10c0c","91153ebdbdbfbfe0d6993ecd93f0ed58935d0862","769917640e79175df925c09442f462db2ac4404e","9960870ba652d60f7796426b4bbcd2bce44d450b","cf6356271a26a5edae5091384b7c61a63ce42df3","14e49abefc88a339cd10da527807a9a950e856d3","8f2b0c4a4c26ae04833052690e5cd2178d2c5759","ed27506c80e8152bea82ae54e3b28d1d04e1d119","5dfb570685a5dd0af232d80d1b58d810c6d71b06","333f197f904af2a33c66947387b17761f1514b24","b0ea7e282e1a7c976c1bf19d208ac32529360bf1","1240149b46d47fdac3b5b78d7b585a05cd63878e","c998ab6ec918fcb57872160e3facb2b63c4ba886","052d1a436d0fa8e218a4753f1881407e37208a3d","ba07ee2ec3ae12fd49be01183e77c4671219ebfd","1042ed4ddc1b260e5064ba74c6e97cdf9e4e8b59","f5488afc7944c7b6e64fee39a3ec19bfbb4f3470","bf450eb569bd636e5d28046af034aa9d58ed0c44","768987174e9e9d64d809031fd9087ab97ed19efa","8ec9b512206eeb73a33c9b0b0d6fc63bc386d5a3","e0189260d9a0caa01635a12f2b67145904a71256","e042b071039107e20b3bf2289e7ae9409a2980a2","12ce6549e94fa8e9be11b3d1b2b7da164185bdc1","b30fd3e71a2a373936877133e7e75420bc872a3d","376c84da39bf282a0987739b5fe171c496977df3","cea6a37020836742d50230d29af16bbe2862daaa","18048697a49d2458ee3afac079ef0a314e95c43e","defdab25fed905fd85e1be2c678723743075864e","a6bf70ba0acc739e58ca2b28c0236dd2aff8274d","cca52a9911ad56982b1605a32d59403f62841ffe","cb13ac7264079a04973a07bbb88d0534d03aa17f","bdf9896847487ab54404f2dc321a18b7bb8ae480","a582076cb2a913ffad96268a31847201b922ac7c","a702079b2d5e338276119365a0ef2e5bfb52aa6f","ed225db645916a0a539263aacf58eccf24c3b5b9","43acc2d5b25d63ec1c75bd23260a776a7c78409e","e61fec0675aa3110a36c74df6b51799fabfcf3b9","6bd177457583961ece38850f6531c30c2ab3e543","e2a08171d19fc17125d482d9b5117b2cf14ddfca","fef8db7d351b1d8deb3275a5cdf3f431545d8f74","1dda05fbf0163bfce4451ee2ef561f9290b90605","b879c0050e43612c09cc5dae842c4ffd46256eac","16059b40828b6365237dd58fe149e3a0977feb39","5aac8eb337d24bdcb8b03792ab886f35c2846ea1","8dfc670858477b8f018b8c5e5b33d14e7d00676f","39e3982e733c9bb4cdb138104073fdae383dc194","8bf2a4c438fae85553ff432fe5c6ebade83c7dbd","acfd9dd456604781975c83d7363830b7fec5a643","c0b9bb4b0f152e6363818af9ace568ab9996883d","6e45c28d561c9e203196e881e1137703257f0ce2","f6e2b0f8077d0df8a928fee403aaa66da86bdd3a","d7fc06e101dcdc6687bb8974311496c04af7bf3b","6d651ceb04049cb3edb476a4ebf5f3120ad4d5eb","5e8da17becb9000d26e6cd34db18c0441521d143","f5ad82dd8218bc69a9a8fd31ce6eef2cfdf4de71","48429a790599cc8e20622e384e02e2f8a4653af5","07f5095cce32e37a81fc80f0746474782754e76a","4920b8361afb96ac4ad2baea2b4bff0cd1d97a52","cf63a4f9168560146800148a2663bf4fee8e38cc","fd01c690633fd9860838966253091729ebdd1a24","ef70c4989a7cdbfe0f6fb78c98e022ed12e6c906","d2e58de2b4d9252d310b2d81218b44401fb4cedd"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.bloodjournal.org/content/bloodjournal/109/4/1669.full.pdf?sso-checked=true"],"title":"Targeting PKC in multiple myeloma: in vitro and in vivo effects of the novel, orally available small-molecule inhibitor enzastaurin (LY317615.HCl).","doi":"10.1182/blood-2006-08-042747","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1182/blood-2006-08-042747","venue":"Blood"}
