The fading gains are correlated across the receivers and sampled independently at each time. Perfect receiver channel state information (CSI) is assumed, whereas a noisy CSI of the main channel is also available to the transmitter. We propose lower and upper bounds on the capacity. Our lower bound is achieved by a coding scheme that involves a separate binning of the receiver CSI sequence and its channel output sequence. In general it improves upon the joint-binning schemes considered in earlier works. Our upper and lower bounds coincide, establishing the capacity, when either the transmitter has no CSI or when the channel gains of the legitimate receiver and the eavesdropper are statistically independent.","inCitations":["b54055b8899031e8617d84ba2ea5032168fbe54f","b745321d16eaef2ef13027a6922867fecb5363b0","3086a4eee7e46e3e0734e77f7aa7285e804ba25b","afffdae3c34b0a1db586421432517580ad317d59","9a46f7d7fbb98515e060636e9039b9c1a94bbf51","fdc0a0251adb84b4c61dba38a02021d88c12fc41"],"pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOMW.2011.6162578","http://licos.ee.ucla.edu/lib/exe/fetch.php/papers:remark_secret_keygen.pdf?cache=","http://www.comm.utoronto.ca/~akhisti/remark.pdf"],"title":"A remark on secret-key generation over correlated fading channels","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOMW.2011.6162578","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOMW.2011.6162578","venue":"2011 IEEE GLOBECOM Workshops (GC Wkshps)"}

Moderate to high correlations were found between overall performance on the phonological awareness tasks and the four transcription tasks. The lowest performers on the phonological awareness tasks also proved to be the poorest transcribers. Several poor transcribers showed difficulty with two specific phonological awareness tasks: phoneme switching and phonetic reversal. Implications for teaching phonetics are discussed.","inCitations":["927f99b18db7048cd6e88d14b11ce77e7849cfb1","296d2d84166207a6272ec5d5b3625e20ad1b218a","d3c4ade4e1145d8bcef56511ab947fd32398b0e5","9e6b9e1a2345c725c9e5edbd5a4fb179fb1c4b83","784d74a201b50b6d693960b57855122ed03468c3","7f5847d3710c06be3a56d4f50c0ed8e6c1f5807e","001167b6f2f5bb7258c8f7ca8e6000b4acb85286"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.asha.org/uploadedFiles/asha/publications/cicsd/2001FPhonologicalAwarenessSkills.pdf"],"title":"I Phonological Awareness Skills of University Students : Implications for Teaching Phonetics","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

The lung is a neglected organ in the study of dogs and humans with visceral leishmaniasis, but interstitial pneumonitis represents an important lesion characterized by thickening of the alveolar septum due to fibrosis and inflammatory exudate, and its pathogenesis is still uncertain. In this study, the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to detect Leishmania infantum in paraffin-embedded lung biopsies from naturally infected dogs from an endemic area in Minas Gerais State, Brazil; PCR was compared to histological and immunohistochemical techniques for detecting Leishmania.ResultsEighteen dogs in which leishmaniasis had been diagnosed by serological tests - indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFAT), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and complement fixation tests (CFT) - were classified as asymptomatic, oligosymptomatic or symptomatic. Nine of the 18 dogs studied had a positive PCR (50%) but parasites were not detected by histopathological and immunocytochemistry methods.ConclusionsThese data indicate that PCR on DNA extracted from paraffin-embedded tissue is a valuable method for detecting Leishmania infantum parasites in lungs of naturally infected dogs, despite the apparent absence of parasites from standard HE (hematoxylin and eosin) stained slides and of labeled parasites from immunocytochemical preparations.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://bmcvetres.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s12917-018-1730-7"],"title":"Detection of Leishmania infantum DNA in the non-parasitized lung of dogs with visceral leishmaniasis","doi":"10.1186/s12917-018-1730-7","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12917-018-1730-7","venue":"BMC Veterinary Research"}

SLE 2.1 cells were analyzed in more detail. The voltage dependence could be described by a Boltzmann distribution with Vo = +/- 63.1 mV and Gmin = 0.34. In cell pairs that exhibited spontaneously low junctional conductance, single channel events could be distinguished. Single gap junction channel currents had a linear current-voltage relationship. A frequency histogram of single channel conductances from eight cell pairs had three major peaks of 35, 60 and 97 pS.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe electrical properties of gap junction channels between mammalian lens epithelial cells were virtually identical to those previously reported for transfected cell lines expressing connexin43.

Bioassays revealed greater clubroot severity and incidence, and reduced plant height, where 100% of a susceptible cultivar had been grown. A higher proportion of susceptible plants within a resistant canola crop increased root hair and secondary infections. Regression analysis of root hair infection and the amount of Plasmodiophora brassicae DNA (as determined by quantitative PCR) revealed strong linear relationships between the two parameters. The linear relationships between root hair infection and P. brassicae DNA were stronger for the resistant cultivar than for the susceptible cultivar when regression analysis was conducted by cultivar over the sampling dates. In conclusion, the cropping of a resistant cultivar reduced clubroot severity, while the presence of susceptible volunteer canola increased inoculum potential. Quantitative PCR was a reliable tool for the quantification of root hair infection.","inCitations":["2de6eae10d6b3401925a92d40369ef47d2473ce3","2840cdcd6f3d59d8ee11fe1309b4f79cb98807ec","d8671381d49a8314bb6812911f0ea1c960fc86a2","9a672a22aa3e6d801a8dd72e8d960504f96f2fb1","0ec7ae2fe12f876a8378671db2270747ae292dcb","1434f0fe480e82be1817f1d63affe84ed6108c93","7b5ee274fdc50a3d1bbd74f4db4951ae7e9206ff","f632d19edba9e7687144b790e29bc80012fb46c1","29e825a8c0d277c1863863815a69549028ab821d","1a0ebe66f26c3c30e4656091a8e1666c96660072","b1fb28d484d539c84e1244643d0122d06bea4396","62997f7b5e82cb5ced7391357d036dd531543ec6"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Assessment of the impact of resistant and susceptible canola on Plasmodiophora brassicae inoculum potential","doi":"10.1111/j.1365-3059.2011.02582.x","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-3059.2011.02582.x","venue":""}

The production of lindane with the much larger quantities of associated waste isomers has generated large waste deposits and contaminated sites. This article presents an overview of HCH-polluted sites in Brazil as a basis for further activities related to the Stockholm Convention. The locations of HCH stockpiles and contaminated sites in Brazil arising from production and formulation have been compiled and mapped. This shows that the measures taken over the past 25 years have not resulted in remediation of the HCH pollution. An exposure risk study has been summarised for one major site and is included to demonstrate the contemporary relevance of the contamination. Major site remediation efforts are planned at one site but people live close to several other sites, and there is an urgent need of further assessments and remediation to ensure the protection of human health and the environment. The Stockholm Convention requires a systematic approach and should be adopted for the assessment of all sites and appropriate isolation/remediation measures should be facilitated. The appropriate planning of these activities for the production site in Rio de Janeiro could be a positive contribution for Rio+20 highlighting that green economy and sustainable production also include the appropriate management of legacies of historic production of an industrial sector (here the organochlorine industry).","inCitations":["ab64538b1757abc276310c76c722b5050e61306d","31dbbc9a79bfa2102b951063217280376943889e","c2390c20cd3d09e15c66c07a540b399dd0c803c6","d2418a3492154a8658e0df8bf37c174a2139cdea","fef7e758bcd8b014b086b769151e676c91de70c9","43dc8327a89c79f167d02c0b88889b1c0578cade","6a9649248bdba93b37bd243856b9062fd5d9326e","bb4956408b425567bae37ab8b8e88fa958d8cb26","f915b786487763c7ae8b9ad1b8411f501fcc079e","dadacc81b3a9f42bfd2a90cb9eeea2bea1e5acd7"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"HCH contamination from former pesticide production in Brazil—a challenge for the Stockholm Convention implementation","doi":"10.1007/s11356-012-1089-4","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11356-012-1089-4","venue":"Environmental Science and Pollution Research"}

Here, α1,2-mannosidase E-I from strain ATCC 26555 was purified by conventional methods of protein isolation and affinity chromatography in Concanavalin A-Sepharose 4B. Analytical electrophoresis of the purified enzyme revealed two polypeptides of 52 and 23 kDa, the former being responsible for enzyme activity as revealed by zymogram analysis. Time course proteolysis with an aspartyl protease from Aspergillus saitoi, converted α1,2-mannosidase E-I into an active polypeptide of 43 kDa which trimmed Man9GlcNAc2, generating Man8GlcNAc2 isomer B and mannose. Trimming was inhibited preferentially by 1-deoxymannojirimycin. Both, the molecular mass and the enzyme properties of the proteolytic product were identical to those described for α1,2-mannosidase E-II therefore supporting the notion that E-I is the precursor of E-II.","inCitations":["bca10ca9be7ed3dd0c72410036166c4ab564dde2","7cb93d94a1f53c3b7ac3a91730a82bd4e9d565bc"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Conversion of α1,2-mannosidase E-I from Candida albicans to α1,2-mannosidase E-II by limited proteolysis","doi":"10.1007/s10482-007-9179-x","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10482-007-9179-x","venue":"Antonie van Leeuwenhoek"}

Von besonderer forstwirtscha~licher und/Skologischer Bedeutung ist hierbei die Kliirung der funktionellen Zusammenh~inge zwischen Krone und Zuwachs der Waldb,iume. Grundlegende Arbeiten haben wir auf diesem Gebiete BURGEr, (1) ZU verdanken, der in umfangreichen Untersuchungen den zwischen Kronenraum, Nadelgewicht, Nadeloberfliiche und Schaf~holzzuwachs sowie Holztrockensubstanzzuwachs bestehenden Relationen nachging. Hinsichtlich der Fichte wurden diese Arbeiten kiirzlich erg~inzt durch einen Beitrag yon VANSrLOW (3). W~ihrend Bray.erR sich vorwiegend mit den Gesetzm~i~igkeiten der Baumklassen (Durchmesserklassen) befal~te und sich damit auf statische Relationen beschr~inkte, versuchte VANsrLow den dynamischen Ablauf der funktionellen Beziehungen zwischen Krone und Zuwachs innerhalb des Lebensablaufes der B~iume zu kliiren. Differenziert wurden diese Untersuchungen noch durch die Ausscheidung von drei verschiedenen Ertragsklassen. Es liegt nun nahe, sich einmal vollstiindig vom Kollektiv des Reinbestandes, wie er den bisherigen Untersuchungen zumeist zugrunde liegt, zu l;Ssen und allein den individuellen Eigenscha~en der Waldbiiume nachzuspiiren.

Radiation-induced biological effects can be classified as stochastic--malignant and hereditary diseases for which the probability of an effect occurring is a function of dose without threshold--and nonstochastic--inflammatory and degenerative diseases for which the severity and frequency of the effect varies with the dose and for which a threshold is present. The current International Commission on Radiation Protection (ICRP) approach for setting limits for intakes of radionuclides by workers, which accounts for doses to significantly exposed organs of the body, is based on limitation of stochastic effects in most situations. When setting exposure limits, nonstochastic effects are generally considered to be unlikely at the limits for stochastic effects. In some situations, limits based on prevention of nonstochastic effects are lower than for stochastic effects. This review considers the threshold radiation doses for thyroid, bone, liver and lung and their relationship to the limits recommended by the ICRP and the cancer risks at the limits. This review indicates that the threshold dose for nonstochastic effects in thyroid and lung is much above the dose limit as advocated by ICRP. The threshold dose for nonstochastic effects in bone and liver is much closer to the dose limit, but protection from nonstochastic effects should still be afforded by the dose limits.","inCitations":["af3c30a7b6a446a422c96c37befbd33475acf854","eb792eda2345095a34b1af2a83de287b874fc148","387e9ad136aa18bc673ded6dcb7ba34739c2e5d3"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Future development of biological understanding of radiation protection: implications of nonstochastic effects.","doi":"10.1097/00004032-198808000-00024","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1097/00004032-198808000-00024","venue":"Health physics"}

In the presence of mucosal Li the amiloridesensitive, transepithelial cation transport path can be described as a constant emf in series with a variable conductance. A comparison of equivalent circuit parameters, however, reveals that in the presence of mucosal Li the apparent emf of the cation transport path is markedly reduced, but the conductance of the active path may be greater than, equal to, or less than that observed in the presence of Na. In tissues characterized by a relatively low cellular conductance in the presence of Na, Li substitution increases the amiloridesensitive conductance, whereas, in tissues characterized by an initially high active “Na-conductance”, the amiloride-sensitive conductance is reduced in the presence of Li. Thus, the approximate identity ofIsc in some tissues after cation substitution is a fortuitous consequence of an increased amiloride-sensitive conductance in the presence of mucosal Li coupled with adecreased apparent emf for Li transport. The addition of small amounts of Li to Na-containing mucosal or serosal solutions inhibits active Na transport, suggesting that Li exerts a “toxic” effect on the transport machinery apart from its ability to serve as a substitute cation.Transmural Na flux measurements reveal that, when the mucosal bathing solution contains comparable amounts of Na and Li, the net flow of Na through the active path isless than the totalIsc. The ratio ofIsc to the net Na flux approaches unity as the mucosal Li concentration approaches zero, confirming the notion that the “extra current” is carried by Li ions. The ratio ofIsc to the net Na flux is a linear function of the mucosal Li∶Na concentration ratio and the slope of this relation can be interpreted to indicate that the ratio of the apparent rate coefficients for Li and Na movement through the active path is about 0.75.","inCitations":["d0ac7d288426a619c3c71fa74b7bfdd099575033","4af06d3e832f4ea19e04eb43224fe9a5b937e91a","62e69313b98b2f68bf0ff501c6d336ab18b79bb8","a6ab306647c68db8435c22be71ea1cd2ff8be328","74027d7a4070ccf22293f5de32d32b15ca04b83a","ffeb978f1c68a48544b23b411036b968116c7737","776a870d3b03846bcd5699ebeeea7ddf387feffc"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Cation selectivity in active transport: Properties of the turtle colon in the presence of mucosal lithium","doi":"10.1007/BF01868752","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/BF01868752","venue":"The Journal of Membrane Biology"}

Their main purpose is to explain the generation of multiple plumes on the west wall of a plasma upwelling and the relationship between gravity waves and large scale ESF irregularities. They have studied ESF structures resulting from one-dimensional or two-dimensional initial density perturbations an initiated by gravity waves. It is found that although plasma bubbles may be produced in all the situations, the production of the plasma bubbles initiated by gravity waves takes a time much shorter than that resulting from two-dimensional initial density perturbations. This is in agreement with a simple analytic nonlinear theory. The authors put their emphasis on the ESF structures growing from two different scale perturbations. The Rayleigh-Taylor instability initiated by gravity waves produces a steep gradient on the well wall, which provides a favorable condition for excitation of smaller-scale secondary instabilities. When both a seed gravity wave and a smaller-scale initial density perturbation are used, it is observed that the large-scale gravity wave determines the outer scale of results in multiple plumes preferentially located on the west wall.

IgG antibodies against LGI1 are associated with immunotherapy-responsive encephalitis and epilepsies. LGI1-antibody concentrations are 10-100 times greater in serum than in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Oligoclonal IgG bands are rarely found in patients with LGI1-antibody encephalitis or epilepsy. These observations raise questions about the sources of the B cells that result in production of LGI1 antibodies and how the IgGs reach the brain. We aimed to investigate the migration and expansions of peripheral and central B cells to the production of LGI1-specific IgG.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe performed PCR amplification and next generation deep immune repertoire sequencing of immunoglobulin (Ig) heavy chain variable regions (VH) from CSF and subsorted peripheral blood B-cell populations from two patients with limbic encephalitis and faciobrachial dystonic seizures associated with LGI1 antibodies. Bioinformatics clustering of related IgM-VH or IgG-VH transcripts was used to determine whether active B-cell diversification could be observed, and whether intrathecal B-cell repertoires, if present, were related to peripheral B cells.\n\n\nFINDINGS\nWe identified clusters of related Ig-VH transcripts in the CSF of both patients. Within these clusters there was a range of somatic hypermutations along the IGHV germline segment-derived portion. In addition, we identified a large number of closely related Ig-VH clusters that were common to both CSF and peripheral blood, including a small number of dominating Ig-VH clusters that might represent the most active clonally related B-cell populations.\n\n\nINTERPRETATION\nOur data suggest that some B-cell affinity maturation occurs inside the CNS compartment in LGI1-antibody encephalitis. Somatic hypermutation rates point to a CSF antigen-driven activation of clonally related B cells that shape the intrathecal immune repertoire. The target antigen or antigens of these clonally related B cells remain unknown; our work continues to determine the relative contribution of intrathecally activated and peripheral LGI1-specific B cells in this autoimmune CNS disease.\n\n\nFUNDING\nWellcome Trust Intermediate Fellowship to SRI, Fulbright-MS Society, Epilepsy Research UK, BMA Vera Down Research Grant.","inCitations":["fb5c9e74f06c057c37e3962ea98c0c01bc413a4a","c3b3eba1bed2500fd6968d8f7c31bfd20ed756e5","4e48667bf7afa4f4d354e59ab9492b9688208127"],"pdfUrls":["https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0140673615603610","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673615603610?dgcid=api_sd_search-api-endpoint"],"title":"The active intrathecal B-cell response in LGI1-antibody encephalitis","doi":"10.1016/S0140-6736(15)60361-0","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736%2815%2960361-0","venue":"The Lancet"}

Experimentelle Regenerationskurven, ausgelöst durch Behandlung von Mäusen mit Cyclophosphamid- oder Vinblastin-Injektion, wurden mit relativer Genauigkeit simuliert. Die Simulationen ergaben (i), daß unreife Granulozyten eine beträchtliche Kapazität zur Selbsterneuerung besitzen. (ii) Wenn ein Inhibitor der Zellvermehrung (Chalon) eine wichtige Regulierungsfunktion hat, ist anzunehmen, daß er nicht nur von reifen, sondern auch von unreifen Granulozyten produziert wird; (iii) Chalone können die Reifungs- sowie die Generationszeiten beeinflussen.Es ist möglich, diese experimentellen Thesen und andere Schlußfolgerungen aus den Modellergebnissen zu überprüfen.SummaryA mathematical model of granulocyte formation and its regulation has been made, using three negative feedback loops (i.e., two “chalone loops” and one “leucocytosis-inducing factor loop”, as well as a short-lasting signal to cell division, induced by cell death. Experimental regeneration curves obtained after treating mice with two injections of cyclophosphamide or with one injection of vinblastine were reasonably well simulated. The simulations suggested that (i) immature granulocytes have a considerable capacity for additional mitoses (selfrenewal); (ii) if an inhibitor of cell multiplication (chalone) is an important regulatory factor, it may be produced not only by mature, but also by immature granulocytes; and (iii) chalone may affect maturation times as well as generation times. It is possible to test experimentally these and other deductions mode from the model.","inCitations":["bba3e1be0e4816231e3d5721d127c19af9d8aa6c","2268c541c7fa105f99638a07d21589de4c364a09"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Simulation of murine granulopoiesis","doi":"10.1007/BF01039876","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/BF01039876","venue":"Blut"}

A collection of 244 all-night hypnograms is studied. Quartiles (q = 4) provide a good tradeoff between representational detail and sample variation. 15 descriptive variables are obtained that correspond to the bout duration quartiles of wake after sleep onset, NREM stage 1, NREM stage 2, slow wave sleep, and REM sleep. EM clustering is used to identify distinct groups of hypnograms based on stage bout durations. Each group is shown to be characterized by bout duration quartiles of specific sleep stages, with statistically significant differences among groups (p < 0.05). Several sleep-related and health-related variables are shown to be significantly different among the bout duration groups found through clustering. In contrast, multivariate linear regression fails to yield good predictive models based on the same bout duration variables used in the clustering analysis. This work demonstrates that machine learning techniques are capable of uncovering naturally occurring dynamical patterns in sleep data that also provide sleep-based indicators of health.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://page-one.springer.com/pdf/preview/10.1007/978-3-642-38256-7_25"],"title":"Clustering of Human Sleep Recordings Using a Quantile Representation of Stage Bout Durations","doi":"10.1007/978-3-642-38256-7_25","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-38256-7_25","venue":"BIOSTEC 2012"}

The tumor was located in the lower pole of the left lobe and the isthmus of the thyroid, and it had invaded the thyroid parenchyma, thyroid capsule, adjacent connective tissue, and neck muscles. Continuity between the cervical thymus and the tumor was noted. Subsequently, the patient developed widespread metastases in the liver, lungs, bones, and lymph nodes without local recurrence. Histologic examination disclosed a solid growth of epithelial cells with squamous cell differentiation and keratinization. The tumor cells had an ill-defined cell border and large nuclei with large nucleoli. Moderate mitoses and slight necrosis of the tumor were seen. Immunohistochemical examination showed that the tumor cells were stained positively for keratin but not for calcitonin or thyroglobulin. There were infiltrations of lymphocytes in the tumor and fibrous stroma, and most of them proved to be T cells.","inCitations":["e8bded968229e9dd458a05a2f8a4c00700820da7","c10f9ce585dcf5b21d3edcdcf1ae807eb0f40119","23ed0b5bc8bffe665e41752b09854f02ee7409bc","0627a0aa97690790cd85c53c89737527ffeb5de9","8c702cd2b8074a477e3a19691b8599642abe46c9","5dbfe217d0aa806ebaf8258a95523fce68669884","ca0822a43e1b09b1f5dee101f5c3e43644e76d93","78a84c4bc7c612f965dc0f1f1b99a4f6c648af84","cbcf158dffe1fb8133bdb19116d15f41bb2645e3","cc0168b29c4d9242dcae7cd22a689926f7cdfdf3","eebb70d533e21bb339fa94e6077b9afcdc4097b7","ed66d3a3a48fbce2844eea42c9258eb51220dfc4","fa4a6fc960d703d784b38112e7bcd97412209dd6","4a0724820cc3ec7d8de562cc87bbbbffe30573e0","cab936ac6fa21dc5cc0500de2a9956802cc0b91c","e9395d6a1fd251f00e153ca1153a0a3fef8eba4a","717ee20f593295ac2cac261a229db654a9a3b8a6","1c117c42a129497a0dd369877c4718e38dad8806","3a705ee405a2bbd2c14e9bb6270210a10e290397","a6e9e714e81a8dbd39f31b93bc6855c240f3ffc6","92ed715459d6ff372039dc9577af3c28e2d7e1b2","a72c5520b456ecdb9a0ec1f58f76fe668d882342","ca1cfad8d55b0473e1aab32d4b2082c1ef8997d0","b35cc3cbd96c9dd00c3a15e92045f8b4e6bc282d","c6e687515ed9d46c788a5ea10306abafdeeba6cd","69f076963caba6ddfdcc993f66bac61bb965b7d7"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Carcinoma of possible thymic origin presenting as a thyroid mass: a new subgroup of squamous cell carcinoma of the thyroid.","doi":"10.1002/jso.2930380311","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1002/jso.2930380311","venue":"Journal of surgical oncology"}

The analysis is based on Brown and Levinson‘s politeness strategies. The result shows that teacher and students basically employed positive, negative, and bald onrecord strategies. Teacher and students’ perception on social distance, the age difference, institutional setting, power, and the limitation of the linguistic ability of the students has contributed to the different choices of politeness strategies. The students tend to use some interpersonal function markers. Linguistic expressions that are used in classroom interaction are addressing, encouraging, thanking, apologizing, and leave–taking.","inCitations":["0b7aff8492ce17437cea3fcc41ac1daff9a8b275","730468d033dda9a3f9dc995ebf0850a5faf0c3e9","997ed216377cd48c29dce449d0fd27eaf22205d5","cca5afbe9ffbba84a89351e2aa3925e3e6f0a452","75998953ac18a38c4fddbbe2f3ce52fe4367189b","d2a8c3d04c77cc873c831e945cade4549f16fce9","311e964284ac9e47143e145acf207dfcb35ded16","8220d422386de04dd7787a860ea118040e05baac","c2f7ac1e0957c10ec976dd616a4a198c4a60e1b8","8ebe657627cff5a33fcee36c7d9beb3a0d746ae2","d2798f5a7634785bd3dc7790da4cc0f4b26a64d5","8e193eeb9830e57550a93d3399a6ff281d33fded","c0c3cbb1ced6e4cee72405dfd6b76bdbc217b782","ee1cdc4f06a74a43f67ff7b86c4209cb64a10c3e","ac3658ea0290e9c5614ee4fa610b7311694415c9","52876c0d67d7876b4e902d7355b2eadf657e63bc","28eb26256a463948d0b004ae39e1959c362b4169","f0eac65708b614be56d0f654db733d941eb58cbb"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.journal.teflin.org/index.php/journal/article/download/156/145"],"title":"Politeness Strategies in Teacher-student Interaction in an Efl Classroom Context","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Both species of Palmeria are new for the Australian region, as are one species each of Lithodesmium and of Ditylum, two species of the genus Lithodesmioides, one species plus one variety of Bellerochea, as well as one species and one form of Neostreptotheca. Lithodesmium duckerae, Lithodesmioides polymorphum and L. minutum, Ditylum buchananii, Bellerochea horologicalis var. recta and Neostreptotheca torta and its fo. triangularis are described for the first time. Palmeria ostenfeldii, a species associated with an epiphytic ciliate, is sep- arated from P. hardmaniana. In Ditylum brightwellii, the proportion of thecae with the slotted versus the fimbriate form of the marginal ridge is shown to be probably influenced by the ambient water conditions. In the same species, the ontogenies of the resting spores (including germi- nation) as well as of the gametes are described. Lithodesmioides presents new instances of fissipariety (split wall character) in both of its species. 'Simple pores', which have recently been demonstrated by Li and Volcani to be distinct in origin from areolae, are common in all described species of Lithodesmium, Lithodesmioides and Ditylum in two forms as either 'branching point pores' or 'intracostal pores'.","inCitations":["fd282126afc049800a62aff0faba129880b6d127"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Some marine diatoms from the Australian region, especially from Port Phillip Bay and tropical north-eastern Australia.

Two traits were defined for 48- and 72-mo herd life, true herd life and functional herd life, which were adjusted for milk production prior to culling. Heritabilities for 48- and 72-mo herd-life traits were low, ranging from .02 to .07; genetic correlations among herd-life traits ranged from .82 to .95, and phenotypic correlations ranged from .80 to .97. Genetic correlations between the herd-life traits and first lactation milk, fat, and protein production ranged from .37 to .81. Genetic correlations were lower between functional herd life and milk, fat, and protein production than among true herd life and these same variables. Multiple-trait REML from sire models, which included sire relationships, was used to estimate genetic and phenotypic correlations between 48-mo true or 48-mo functional herd life and linear type traits for registered Guernsey cattle. The genetic correlations were used to compute weights for indirect prediction of true and functional herd-life transmitting abilities from linear type traits transmitting abilities. The predictions are equivalent to multiple-trait BLUP with no observations for herd life.","inCitations":["8b9ccc019768068c02c5f9ae8ba5279358f2db81","5b7e113b25ebedaef06c54a0cce21c76d77ab47c","cc8f8e5e4a314f60b199cb7adfca7a79b5f82755","fd8e8a01ad88be7e92df42e5b4865037ede5953e","d4c4c7da024350d94306d3bb0e5a854c46ae81d6","6af7acf6bbb5594eda6e81b3be19e53dcae60ad5","9c5360f444b983a0b0a26f0d697d97ffb8ab965e","95b19b0ecdcd757714d51fe0fabe70c9c0a3cf5d","a8a427c5f16fa2dfa7c89c5c9938aa32d5346c72","b081daac3e3a4178ffdb85b592d90b14d5595d5e","950a00dbcbe63fc0785eaab71e06af06859e6565","ef62ae31b4a7f39faa9e85c7dead879528129eb5"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Analysis of Herd Life in Guernsey Dairy Cattle","doi":"10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(92)77960-0","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.3168/jds.S0022-0302%2892%2977960-0","venue":""}

The gross error referred to was discovered by an enthusiastic student who used the Helber chamber in making a count of red blood corpuscles.

Sequences analysis revealed that these viruses are reassortants bearing genes of H3N8, H7N3, H7N7, and H10N7 influenza viruses detected in wild birds and ducks, and can be categorized into three genotypes (A, B, and C). All six viruses bound to both human-type and avian-type receptors. The viruses in genotype B and C could replicate efficiently in the lungs and nasal turbinates of mice without prior adaptation, and the genotype C virus also replicated in the brain of two of three mice tested. It is important to continue to monitor the evolution of H7N7 viruses and to evaluate their potential to cause human infections.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"New influenza A(H7N7) viruses detected in live poultry markets in China.","doi":"10.1016/j.virol.2016.06.015","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2016.06.015","venue":"Virology"}

However, cells used as drugs remain critical to patient care. Cell therapy's origins began with the realization that complex tissues such as blood can retain function when transplanted to the patient. More complex transplantation followed, culminating with the understanding that transplantation of some tissues such as bone marrow may act medicinally. Administration of cells with an intended therapeutic effect is a hallmark of cellular therapy. While cells have been used as drugs for decades, testing a specific therapeutic effect of cells has begun clinical testing relatively recently. Lessons learned during the establishment of blood banking (including the importance of quality control, process control, sterility, and product tracking) are key components in the assurance of the safety and potency of cell therapy preparations. As more academic medical centers and private companies move toward exploiting the full potential of cells as drugs, needs arise for the development of the infrastructure necessary to support these investigations. Careful consideration of the design of the structure used to manufacture is important in terms of the significant capital outlay involved and the facility's role in achieving regulatory compliance. This development perspective describes the regulatory environment surrounding the infrastructure support for cell therapy and practical aspects for design consideration with particular focus on those activities associated with early clinical trials.","inCitations":["8cc9c225dcc038388be5d1603ee4cd5ca4284166","dab83f2ebd271d132ecc1e293b635644f8a9ec5f","3b79871c61eb0f7e9d7bc44f190afbe3ab711316","6952444506078fd78ec3fed11a6aa163da6539b3","d8419effc535947da3d6486ee4547d615e8f527e","b9edaacfab5c4690fab32603bed5d70ebeead4d4","0a354e02f4d1e3358fc9f3181ead4fc66358deb4","403bee52ba7edc58da628c8ce726e94b8f797040","71b3a3e4d5ab0ba00e09e2d677c4b94debbcee24","b58702d1f3278b5f4906fde2eed474cef4497212","ea7777b5fc1ef191f2e21767c51da5ad71138d73","adfb157b71d45f20ea23bc013147886af5ac503b","e6395f683a81c44e0505a75fb6b8ca5b944bd666","b19f0364fdb011a7012ec56bced3489e5171fe79","abc9224862b6879aed7a4e49e57c1ea4e6305ea2","b1eeccb9b3f1932e6d51b1edb637a8b0fe76263a","514f123aec81493b599b3d642ce5b0b17a79ab30","d21b3acfc6be6f341d1cecf2e4c8a27f67986c85","e5545d10cf0dac68d207d5e3d797e0e915f970c9","19905f4d6bf40d4ebed65492efa4c9071d040461","47ba69992b0420fbc0eb6b1f6e6cf798885a4ac3","d421885711678127c2cb9a83f8a6b665c02b9bdf","1b12317fd802569dac5e41cc6714579adac33090","844e0d060b12c6ed56558b1f2b5ed6cfd009e151","77f8868e4f2040752754970df1c356cd56d425b6","7397bc735e43a6b82789745ceaaefe5862c33a92"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Infrastructure development for human cell therapy translation.","doi":"10.1038/sj.clpt.6100288","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1038/sj.clpt.6100288","venue":"Clinical pharmacology and therapeutics"}

Tujuan penilaian ini adalah untuk mengetahui seberapa besar kontribusi dari seorang karyawan terhadap perusahaan dalam hal kemampuan dan profesional kerja. Selain tujuan tersebut, penilaian karyawan digunakan sebagai bahan pertimbangan bagi pihak manajemen perusahaan untuk menentukan besaran kanaikan gaji.
