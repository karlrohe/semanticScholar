This study compared two nicotine immunogens representing different hapten presentations, 3'-aminomethyl nicotine conjugated to recombinant Pseudomonas exoprotein A (3'-AmNic-rEPA) and 6-carboxymethlureido nicotine conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (6-CMUNic-KLH), and assessed whether their concurrent administration would produce additive serum antibody concentrations in rats. Effects of vaccination on nicotine pharmacokinetics were also studied. Vaccination of rats with these immunogens produced non cross-reacting nicotine-specific antibodies (NicAb). Serum NicAb concentrations elicited by each individual immunogen were not affected by whether the immunogens were administered alone as monovalent vaccines or together as a bivalent vaccine. The total NicAb concentration in the bivalent vaccine group was additive compared to that of the monovalent vaccines alone. Higher serum NicAb concentrations, irrespective of which immunogen elicited the antibodies, were associated with greater binding of nicotine in serum, a lower unbound nicotine concentration in serum, and lower brain nicotine concentration. These results demonstrate that it is possible to design immunogens which provide distinct nicotine epitopes for immune presentation, and which produce additive serum antibody levels. The concurrent administration of these immunogens as a bivalent vaccine may provide a general strategy for enhancing the antibody response to small molecules such as nicotine.","inCitations":["6a188f700378d07f6f0f1ea653925e155d49f8f0","afbf1fd5d73c67532deac09c138c563baba8cdb2","7dea01f2eb166118194f6da7de3d9a131f930715","47838ec84068806a80db41dee6b1171179aa870c","bb55fb90372d89429c6a3fe15824aa21eb7b199f","03e444f52f276653854865959d59c4bdc496eca1","05d3cdf27576f426a5ccdce89b3deb59bacfcdfd","8908957e5b21bada2fa4d98000a942a2c65875b2","6153be05142672c2c3617352922fad5cfff3b3e6","a3fc3f3a89229a584fbb9616f25352c04c5f8014","ea4714bddb3e9e99f4426f06b35d2c75baec28e1","a7ce043c6db42b6fd51d320aa60238b470176f76","a07ca421d236b771e85bc406cb9603ef06f1f48b","f3f898c9c79e0dff7ceae0acfb34e6a20578c472","e0c166415aed1d200bb334676c2a1df38a0ba7f6","41d1c3afb054a3664a386fcb8198e4da97c1064c","2370f73c0dfae725b57bf1d13d95a1e00cf9569c","71e7b5405778426c944963dc4950e3c5a817650a","1e7bb3e100542341d0253e971489f88fbd7615ea","7ab092c534f89e471ce0402193b842026ebd297f","a355c305fe9e8b0b862040dd30b46c765df96b91","c99b1fe602552c542c8d156b680260ce36d1e96e","c45a9b3d700f391f64850ecec0af7c62d4044b05","c24ca4c2e9ec8b32db858d2dd33650ada5ae887c","471d41e04b51ce1e3aed2dac9ce1cdcb222cc7f4","bb1b69d514ad081d410bfed10817343e8aba5f6d","09b3532e4c6ba2838d7e7e16ef9329bc178fe1c5","153c87f37b7696983fb730d6fb0f866919021630","b4a6a9540f2793623cf7d2b0cf1e414dc62bd6b8","c0f7b7faa7da4b98ddf58acecc5575b99dc28480","a357378f5c448b787599e6949b1d9fdc4c756d1b","2904bcbfa759ba4a870469caa09e355c45c770cb"],"pdfUrls":["http://europepmc.org/backend/ptpmcrender.fcgi?accid=PMC2577591&blobtype=pdf"],"title":"Enhanced immunogenicity of a bivalent nicotine vaccine.","doi":"10.1016/j.intimp.2008.07.001","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.intimp.2008.07.001","venue":"International immunopharmacology"}

The model is run for different Universal Times (UT), season and Interplanetary Magnetic Field (IMF) conditions. It is found that: (1) The TOI formation is critically dependent on UT, preferentially near 2000 UT in the Northern Hemisphere (NH) and near 1600 UT in the Southern Hemisphere (SH). These are the intervals when the high-latitude ion convection throat is closer to the middle-latitude high plasma density source region, so that more plasma can be directly transported into the polar cap region; (2) this different UT dependence between the two Hemispheres occurs, not only because of the different separation of the magnetic poles from the geographic poles in the two hemispheres, but also because of the UT dependence of the mid-latitude source locations (local time, latitude) and the magnitude of plasma density enhancements; (3) the TOI is generally stronger in the SH than it is in the NH, and in winter than in summer; (4) IMF By operates in the opposite sense in the two hemispheres in terms of the TOI pattern such that positive/negative IMF By tends to deflect the TOI toward the morning/afternoon sector in the NH. The opposite condition occurs in the SH.","inCitations":["7c9860dd56c6eb3d03a05256bae2370a0e238931","2a1009d4290852e3727847b079171d909e0eeccd"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"A TIEGCM numerical study of the source and evolution of ionospheric F-region tongues of ionization: Universal time and interplanetary magnetic field dependence","doi":"10.1016/j.jastp.2017.03.005","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jastp.2017.03.005","venue":""}

Generations of thinkers have struggled to fathom the world and explain it in an intelligible formation. Till date, a thoroughly satisfactory explanation of the cosmos has not been finagled. The search for a comprehensive explanation of the world continues. Dominating the interpretations of the world are the materialistic and idealistic schools of thought. These are diametrically opposed cosmological systems without a middle ground. The materialists see the world as essentially material, devoid of any god or maker. The idealists see the world as a product of a spirit or mind. They believe the world to be fundamentally non-material in nature. Nkrumah, a thorough going materialist, believes the world to be fundamentally material in nature, Berkeley who was the most radical advocate of idealism, however, believes the world to be fundamentally spiritual. But the cosmos is, irrespective of man’s interpretation of it. It is fundamentally one in our experience. The problem lies with our conception of some phenomena as material; and some others as spiritual. How can the material and non-material interact? If the world is material, it is definitely not spiritual. If it is made of ideas only, it is definitely not material. But supposing the world is neither material nor spiritual? It could as well be that our definition of matter does not encompass some of the properties inherent in the phenomena we regard as ‘matter”. It could as well be that what we refer as “spiritual” are properties inherent in but not encompassed by the definition of what we call matter. We could as well be living in a “matserial” cosmos, a world that is fundamentally made up of substances whose properties include those we conceive as “material” and some of those we consider as “spiritual”. Perhaps it is time to re-examine our concept of matter and our concept of spirit. Perhaps, we should be talking of “matser” rather than matter and spirit. This work is a product of library research, philosophical analysis and systematic philosophical speculation. It addresses the problem of the interpretation of the world which encompasses the problem of language and the mind/matter dichotomy. It is the finding of this work that the cosmos is neither made up solely of matter or spirit. Phenomena exhibit characteristics which we traditionally describe as spiritual and material. Our conceptualizations of mind and spirit logically leads to a dual cosmos of mind and spirit, which obviously is fallacious. We are in one cosmos. The cosmos is only doubled in our language, not in our experience. Our experience of the cosmos remains one. It is the recommendation of this work that “matser” rather than mind and spirit should be used to characterize phenomena. Ours is a matserial cosmos.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"The “matser” made world: a new conceptualization of matter and spirit","doi":"10.21847/1728-9343.2019.1(159).157444","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.21847/1728-9343.2019.1%28159%29.157444","venue":""}

In order to reach the nominal plasma parameters, optimized magnetic configurations with elongated plasma cross sections have to be obtained. A double null plasma shape has been developed for the purpose of identifying configuration requirements and analyzing the load assembly structural stresses. The overall electromagnetic, thermal and structural analysis of the machine configuration has been carried out using FEM models, 2D for electromagnetic and 3D for thermal and structural calculations, which takes into account an accurate description of geometry and materials of each component. In such a sequence of different analyses several FEM models are integrated and linked: common data files with all input entities (geometrical, materials, currents) are available to each FEM model. The output results files are printed in common directories and structured to be directly read or imported by the other FEM models. The whole process is fully automatic and doesn't need any data handling. It is possible in this way to interface different meshes in the same working environment (ANSYS), each aimed at its own calculation and detail. In the present work these points are taken into account and a complete electromagnetic, thermal and mechanical analysis for Ignitor double-null configuration has been done.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://www.afs.enea.it/capricci/default/Calcolo%20Strutturale/FIP/SOFE%202003%20Load%20Ass.pdf"],"title":"Ignitor double-null configuration: electromagnetic, thermal and structural analysis with integrated FEM models","doi":"10.1109/FUSION.2003.1426719","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FUSION.2003.1426719","venue":"20th IEEE/NPSS Symposium onFusion Engineering, 2003."}

an opportunistic infection that is often life threatening in the immunocompromised host. Early diagnosis is critical, especially given the efficacy and availability of several new anti-fungal therapies. Current (2008) diagnostic criteria have limited ability to detect early infection and are aimed at establishing disease. Although histopathology and culture techniques have traditionally been used to make a proven diagnosis of IA, their dependence on tissue samples and slow turnaround times hamper early confirmation of IA. Serologic detection of circulating galactomannan and 1,3-β-D-glucan fungal biomarkers show promise for improving the diagnosis of IA, and their use is included in the EORTC/MSG diagnostic criteria for IA. Numerous studies have evaluated the diagnostic performance of these two biomarkers and shown that they have suboptimal sensitivity when used alone for early diagnosis of proven IA. Currently available molecular assays also suffer from a lack of standardization. Evaluation of the use of different combinations of test methods to enhance diagnostic accuracy is also being done but prompt, accurate diagnosis of IA remains a clinical and diagnostic challenge. The clinical validity and limitations of biomarkers and current molecular methods for the early diagnosis of IA are summarized in this review with respect to the different patient populations at risk for this serious infection.","inCitations":["c7da7596f28db0cd0bbd89b9bd534b5550543dae","a1cf4adcc3b67f3ca259839bfafc3611ecbb878f","eb821f58d0f3a809f7a4c9394241c81f2d8851a8","7017a3a4b112b77c880f27118babbffaa3be9985","33d5346d2bb10222e99d1673130ea922fb2e4d49","b3572ff5d6b3afffc793ef0aa87ec750011c0e37","46ca02ff3ec74dfecb24bd79d53de98d7a67c285","26c654d554cdc9f86cd572a69fd2b653b12cdfa7","f62a17ddd5a049d53c8949b50a485f11f7db2944","3978cf1e0c61b49685d9b8e1a6cbb47989d27dd4","5dc95f10e632462887106d21b134c215128fd106","6af70ed5a80e224bc49fed5189a9aea6b0ded826","8b60fb665c22a950de01eee567b2a7c7b3baf24a","efd0d456cdc30d884f4dc8f68b996972cfe26900","8be49d72ff4ebf1ffa807a247b44a8c48ec262bf","f100f8705a0747cbefd2b70d830f2cea0d3add3f","81481fa7fff56f06474811f449363a3cf9a5cfcc","64a3cc85f3a8a98b51bc56309dc46178e842c207","e082e9612f4484d30adf7372b3e5ae0e09b06140","c721f99408ea86acaacf2956b7bba6e01e889c18","3e73ba09b0da38a1a7f16417790e96b672dd8b0b"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"The use of biomarkers and molecular methods for the earlier diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis in immunocompromised patients.","doi":"10.1093/mmy/myv026","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1093/mmy%2Fmyv026","venue":"Medical mycology"}

Such \"cancer stem cells\" have been isolated by flow cytometry, followed by xenograft studies of their tumor-initiating properties. A frequently used sorting marker in these experiments is the cell surface protein CD133 (prominin-1). The aim of this work was to examine the distribution of CD133 in pancreatic exocrine cancer.MethodsFifty-one cases of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas were clinically and histopathologically evaluated, and immunohistochemically investigated for expression of CD133, cytokeratin 19 and chromogranin A. The results were interpreted on the background of CD133 expression in normal pancreas and other normal and malignant human tissues.ResultsCD133 positivity could not be related to a specific embryonic layer of organ origin and was seen mainly at the apical/endoluminal surface of non-squamous, glandular epithelia and of malignant cells in ductal arrangement. Cytoplasmic CD133 staining was observed in some non-epithelial malignancies. In the pancreas, we found CD133 expressed on the apical membrane of ductal cells. In a small subset of ductal cells and in cells in centroacinar position, we also observed expression in the cytoplasm. Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas showed a varying degree of apical cell surface CD133 expression, and cytoplasmic staining in a few tumor cells was noted. There was no correlation between the level of CD133 expression and patient survival.ConclusionNeither in the pancreas nor in the other investigated organs can CD133 membrane expression alone be a criterion for \"stemness\". However, there was an interesting difference in subcellular localization with a minor cell population in normal and malignant pancreatic tissue showing cytoplasmic expression. Moreover, since CD133 was expressed in shed ductal cells of pancreatic tumors and was found on the surface of tumor cells in vessels, this molecule may have a potential as clinical marker in patients suffering from pancreatic cancer.","inCitations":["2087714d963b1fec2016947ebdaaa9c51db313cb","fe68caff6516d3085839112d002116105eafab97","2c33a102f91308b1fe8e8b1d91cdcffc8e47a2d1","903fa5a367a6a0c4c5a29048ceab83b3d7746f24","5283489ea7c472b667f0d4387a8cdc63aa15dd15","f9ad1d86c341ebc28e29a83bfb8b291048c7b7ad","8c9f6e6e20d545ba47e5fcbcf993507e04957c95","15256e3369b4876c02759146f9dec096a3276052","be0060f1bec5df936319b57e0a7035feb3cc6988","9f45c885e3fa891be3b08f6302b99816927ce637","06668362108902460f8ef0438abc4178e32b8269","d1ae6249cb0d71d668355ad9b928cb03d070ad15","7c352fb374f0db580c2bd85dfdf95b7cb2863741","cbccac78b4f12281d32c21abcebffa4baabfd41b","4cd28ba6fcda67337b44473843f3f8d60bb6278c","deff1e426f20ff882d0cd30923f0d8a52260bb93","d2224f661940c35cf2c6167889be99dbd9a20b06","56739c9e49e45edab0e4fa2ac2a95adb24b13604","1dae4a5e62a016aabfb15e3a84a48958ccfb331d","a708484bbfc47c4f9408d7bedb2e1702459fa77b","44e1bb22d94d0130b5413361288c061be18d49fc","2375173432cb12d07d2cdabc4b84db118f7c4f1b","8239a193d7349571cc837eeb2c35725870facf23","41a6126dac25df927d94dce50744732ea821301c","23889df09bcf52ddeb9603dc887c16ed1b4bb22e","fd76faaf71c7c08a362a6d346ec8cfef3252608f","4dbfb13a44c1c1f2baf47bce6920241ace77f8c1","196738fd8d255df51c451357d1ed20a22c5c12b3","ed653f71bcdab72900dbf79fd79d54bcf0b8e851","a8bb5240c2223aba1b3a102f1de1669f0403fae6","3227e2bf59937acfefa9642715af1f24772f28c9","5f4a24bb23483486b6622725db6192f3b2727fd8","8802f8cb68019162957c205935b5733999c0996e","5b3df34db21e3e5c66df6d3cf41af84343403cdb","95b75891b4e91d327a59b382c28ab7f5d0b80ab9","72b7e5e70a1c7e6ef4a6f99fcff66f462d42eacf","974acc493013bf37e9be19aa639b3d79e88d5c42","ac7a78935e62eaaa9b1019d6241ff5b756647501","8befb4d198bd61c1ea7a85c65b03296e2f6cdb49","2a60d4d3ee014707874f8f7a6b033b56f3a51f06","b42c3c8bd7c071cbcccb970e4ace955b1aed9ba0","5d9b3d5482e1504b68f1424613dde565a273f395","6052797ebdbc5b9cd3ac70d9b3bf76306e7d4d98","668c107f2d49e4e06e0b3513d4419c739906da66","3e03c6d8cfd5b1f59ac8e025af7646cd8b99ff48","b4f02150faf3c579d7ad5c89a15dc319a34df33f","9201825ec196b1ef48f80c8e740a02f7b1315998","efe37d7cd8ab9e04e748f7cccf933335498bb07a","47e71c53b3b3ea9d75f04e43b479060e80865f32","398b0839f545d91a40d28ac08737f3e3aa94c0ad","e7143cb09028d30396bbc09ed37a560274908c0e","5ed8e8c4db6cb8a8b1c3e262355709a81cbb2145","bae1773b225f9de949bcfb0615d19eb6b361e1c5","d4cae25baa86387bbde90dcc29158d9a13ed78d0","74247ac6d79a020290b88afcdefc72e3dcca43c5","dea781a673a59946328d171f03469bd002c4c613","680ed737ba078f22bd2ac06e845a45667ab0c3fb","7cb315ff0e5ad9549eb7a596d2392e5f75797dd3","1fc29df8f9ec68b7aa34a56f30eaa5fbaadb50cb","676f1fe56bbb0079a7747e2d4d6855ccad80b7c9","1dc4d71f02a527598e27877c37895e0a97184a87","584b47902e0d0fac6695f88f4bb6d8470d103081","6bac5aa9d812ca6b567ee1293a7cf5995154cede","a7dfbdb0d336de68ca26ea7618dff8422cc9be2f","ab91ed216504f7f0770987107fa63b16c3be0d61","27ed7f0ac7d18f963d6df7321b04aa820d7e7510","5153ffa326e94a52adbc5555e044f7480dbbd9ee","bfbbd924195ce11b0172add25fcf85d37285b044","5bb3bcd342981cac2b747a8a999191824aae6763","8056bc6615c710ea213aae9627fbaddf69e659b7","c57799fa38a5dfd28b6d9714a3946f7dd61c4972","07446912302d045e02419376e9b79f09d1514909","57dca8394ba0fe2466cc9290726c055b300e524a","a66a89c1012aab7ffb5a0e9bec524c5a0eb9da80","a45584bfb43b7913c574e4ef3df400575098d554","4de50530f3a73635c19d33251b52f5aacd7e64a2","e13a83b17944566e1598c128a465ebf06fe01bf6","9424fe23f478bc00f920641b87abf2726486d15c","35b33b4a201569d3d3711603b33172c797cf92ed","231e78a3443614dae323192f779df9abac44688a","e707e06dedee7c18cd9c1626c38b159b37c0c462","66bf4852169f5882efc60914255377e2331e5740","8c9deaf9957a9edccbed39d42ae6bb7eebc6973e","0e1d3e863c49ebe9c21ea1f0b69b47dbc5d469f0","3906764d782c12b34066e97c677c36d9f2041497","c1ab54c2601ff4309b033f9b940d06cc57e67f3a","bf9fe719eb404aaaaac0c15fc7a20863d23beeae","a7a40c8bc19a702cdb6e2f8f6c5658540c0712bf","a6224c47a2f737b6f394e29d94e3ca5424ee9556","be4f4916d3e1000edf1f4c132ae898cb2bd77934","c4e9fb00a489a8311f231e8aa0b8e12f2e46d761","414bc41009ae26d1959f6fc2d40bfa5ebd95a523","1fbcd308786498ff3a268b4840de5eb54dbd10b9","ed58421d72bd0ee47dad83ff39ccec069f9f6d6a","02ecf1206917403fa7ee445343ca73fe664b270d","03594d5e34f90e8687f041056e8117c9e1426110","afa0091aa292d0c59d1d23f4de974a888573951f","2eba4e6f1c1106f11c41f8e4e6200b216af2be2f","dcf6d57aebb3f0da9b8c5d2adecde676cece6541","9a59c8334adac76180acaa8347855c3265025301","875cc59e18ab1acc06abb35e41c9d72bfe73e2c3","e0b9c6c3c46b800057a3e96845a8cebc3a2db7c2","9f8970331b3022f4ed4392de6df70e59a77b4bfa","c98a9dc520cc0f9ab3c827f680fd24a82314c331","c76eda0e81e02da3034878ea0f828798595768ec","2772473614cb813ffffbd53cef756b3914e94854","bc46c101893770e40ddd884acb25759d9c2bcf58","41586ab96b3c474659ea086a30de9a62ca3f16d5","82213df776972dc361453cffc08d639ec673e927","a5a4129ec7f42b12014745e0ebc8d62fb1cb22b0","ab11fb7aa1ad5841419df5c493fe4fbe5894c0ce","991cf8b441ca76603d2a05b054bb046520854c2d","5e93fe4b30e5ac89585a4981bd2241db2444ff4d","6aab57f1e015b6423c1887fd6de3343c5aa177c0","84fff97840009dc86bfffbe6a9760408b75373b1","e9aaa948a2d7c60e7e57380e75b323

The treatment periods were separated by 2-week washout periods. Quality of life was assessed on the day before starting treatment and on the last day of each treatment period using the Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire. Sleep problems were also assessed.\n\n\nRESULTS\nIn the desloratadine plus montelukast arm, the mean (SEM) quality of life score before treatment was 3.1 (0.41). After placebo, this score was 2.16 (0.43), after desloratadine it was 1.79 (0.38), after montelukast it was 1.48 (0.37), and after montelukast plus desloratadine it was 1.59 (0.37). In the montelukast plus levocetirizine arm, the mean quality of life score before treatment was 2.58 (0.49). After placebo it was 1.78 (0.46), after levocetirizine it was 1.38 (0.42), after montelukast it was 1.36 (0.37), and after montelukast plus levocetirizine it was 1.26 (0.39).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nPlacebo, montelukast, desloratadine and levocetirizine significantly improved quality of life. Combining montelukast with either levocetirizine or desloratadine gave additional benefits in comparison to each agent alone and could be considered for patients whose quality of life is impaired by persistent allergic rhinitis.","inCitations":["9385e5b86be2dd2e8afbebb9d1a259d4eb46b564","6a30f1e0db0c008077729401f492c4e45564d278","3dbccfb8cb09c9b1ac87f171e2133eb29e7e126a","aef2329a0668ae46021fc01020990282ae652cf7","37ee5fffa876bac76e2da5e37370c9e49d848ff5","3420d4ae7dbcd65eb0205aba150e756ffa4a6af3","4062c5aeea3244c848eebe58f920f9779d64c21c","331840249a108c80ff83e4475d84e4c0a21b6176","2abb3fe49fff06acc96c75ac8f985434f79ccfe4","e43ad2717481395ce011a0742f48daf244791126","d0d03fc81ffcbf676c7de238c20d4f1c9a3ec6d1","107a6aa0b42e5c0baa16cf2f00f92a1e9b9a43f5","613b3df6814587aad73ddc2e309dda1cab8f9bf6","4ce49413c63084ef78528509672d8a52d8215030","d7ea7e962c489714947424504dac6b47b10a8cba","b72ffb49f7f1a9fc1eee31f89dc0826e22b04ffd","2b7b6570dea31671510a3c14fdbe8ac605da5852","cdb86187946fc913eb111df28d7a4d52023c249d","5d98b094031af45250ee0c740cae841c9abbbf78","f2cbb14479c3b1eefc03d75099e7c0a48d2c7b5e","b4a3a6292c826cb6b297ce7616bc2d3db1294abe","22e4cfab6263deb117c0cdbd78cfb2eda516ef33","bac31cc17aa92cb34a2e3e08d9c4144a24e52b75","2260101b0e4e410ec7d12d818e9fd0b28eff4f09","2da96adf47256dfcb1feee36809487925fbe56e6","8b8568738fa35137e282ab9eb094627a827aec40","7cff7066e09e60c94f90eef2e6c5f47ef9b0100f"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.jiaci.org/issues/vol18issue5/4.pdf"],"title":"Quality of life in patients with persistent allergic rhinitis treated with montelukast alone or in combination with levocetirizine or desloratadine.","doi":"","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"Journal of investigational allergology & clinical immunology"}

Yet, for decades (and decades) in the social sciences, scholars have conducted their work as if humans, for all practical purposes, were exempted from these universal evolutionary processes (Horowitz, Yaworsky, & Kickham, 2014; Maynard, Boutwell, Vaughn, Naeger, & Dell, 2015; Pinker, 2002). At most, these scholars allowed for the fact that our bodies may have been historically sculpted by natural selection, but the instant we invented culture we were freed from the laws of nature and exempted from the pressures of selection forces (Cochran & Harpending, 2009). Consequently, the role of biology in some disciplines has come a distant second to the role of culture and socialization in exploring and explaining human nature and human differences (Pinker, 2002; Winegard, Winegard, & Boutwell, 2017).","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Criminology’s Modern Synthesis: Remaking the Science of Crime with Darwinian Insight","doi":"10.1007/978-3-319-60576-0_7","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-60576-0_7","venue":""}

In this framework, an interlaboratory study of methods for testing biodegradability in water was undertaken. Two test methods were selected: the OECD Screening Test modified for dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and the Zahn-Wellens Test by DOC and chemical oxygen demand. Three test materials were investigated: tetrapropylenebenzenesulfonate (TPBS), diethylene glycol, and 4-nitrophenol. From the experimental data of 28 participating laboratories, some critical points of the methods were detected, and conclusions were drawn for improvements. Both methods are applicable for biodegradability testing but results from different laboratories may differ seriously. Such discrepancies are mainly due to different inoculum compositions. A high diversity of species is desirable. Furthermore, longer test durations are recommended, and the whole biodegradation curve should be examined instead of using only one value after a fixed test duration. Use of appropriate biodegradability standard materials should improve essentially the comparability between different laboratories. TPBS is scarcely degradable, diethylene glycol is degradable but often requires an adaptation period, and 4-nitrophenol is problematic by its toxicity, but obviously degradable by certain microorganisms.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Intercomparison programme on detecting biodegradability of chemicals in water: Final report prepared in July 1979 for the Environment and Consumer Protection Service of the Commission of the European Communities","doi":"10.1016/0273-2300(81)90094-5","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/0273-2300%2881%2990094-5","venue":""}

A major portion of real estate investments was directed to the development of a series of projects that primarily aim to attract these flows. I refer to these projects as “places of flows.” I mean by “places of flows,” places that have the capacity of attracting and hosting agglomerations of capital, people, and information flows and facilitate their transmission to the local context.

Genetic distances estimated from RAPD analysis was used to construct phylogenetic trees using Phylogenetic Inference Package (PHYLIP). Since phylogenetic relationships estimated for closely related species are more reliable than that estimated for distantly related species, analyses were conducted separately for groups of taxonomically related species. The results of the present investigation are broadly similar to the inferences by Goodspeed (1954) on the divergence and evolution of Nicotiana species. As would be expected, species included in the same or related subgeneric sections showed greater genetic affinity than species included in distant subgeneric sections. Available information on the geographical distribution of species, their karyotype differentiation in evolution, genome size variation and chromosome affinity in interspecific hybrids were used to interpret the results. The study has confirmed that the RAPD analysis is suitable for studying phylogenetic relationships between related species.","inCitations":["3a463aa1e39d855f31de534554fb3090d2810350","c4cb062072e6cf622d5e634ddf047eb3d47fe4c2","2dd415335842f06befa2cd828e941bbe6a3a77f3","722516dd996e6f057facd93bebb6b0e335337940","bac124e683c86f4fe344b55f0f71b5bbb49d70e4","3cabdd9e4a679e0e110b6577f2fa9ebbc93b07c3","1f83586fc94d27230c0fb5878c5771aff4896e5f","fa2bbf1156d523a04ecf2655c27dcb691e9606e7","e700228de6c63e807318abdcecfbacf86cd97919"],"pdfUrls":["https://www.ajol.info/index.php/ajb/article/viewFile/56123/44571"],"title":"Phylogenetic diversity and relationships among species of genus Nicotiana using RAPDs analysis","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

With increasing traffic at major airports and rapid urbanization, community noise exposure is also expected to increase concurrently. New technologies, while effective, take a long time to mature and penetrate the market, and are therefore only suitable as the long-term solution. A near-term solution of noise mitigation is to analyze and modify the ways existing aircraft are flown in current operations. The objective of this paper is to analyze the sensitivities of airport level environmental impacts such as noise and emissions to changes in aircraft takeoff weight, thrust and departure profiles.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Sensitivity Analysis of Airport level Environmental Impacts to Aircraft thrust, weight, and departure procedures","doi":"10.2514/6.2020-1731","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.2514/6.2020-1731","venue":""}

Neonatal injuries associated with breech delivery or intragluteal injections were not causative factors in this series.

However, little is known about the association between PLEs and PIU among adolescents. The present study examined the associations between PLEs and PIU and negative life events among adolescents. Methods: In total, 1,678 adolescents attending high school were recruited for a cross-sectional survey. They completed self-reported assessments of PLEs using the Prodromal Questionnaire-16 (PQ-16) and measures of depression, anxiety, self-esteem, internet use, and negative life events using the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D), the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSES), the Korean Scale for Internet Addiction (K-scale), and the Lifetime Incidence of Traumatic Events for Children (LITE-C), including cybersexual harassment and school violence. Results: A total of 1,239 subjects (73.8%) scored at least 1 on the PQ-16. The mean total and distress PQ-16 scores were significantly higher in students who used mental health services. The total and distress prodromal questionnaire-16 (PQ-16) scores were positively correlated with the CES-D, STAI-S, STAI-T, LITE-C, and K-scale scores but negatively correlated with the RSES score. Hierarchical linear regression analysis revealed that PLEs were significantly associated with a high K-scale score and the incidence of negative life events, such as LITE-C, cybersexual harassment, and bully-victims. Conclusion: Our results demonstrate that PIU and negative life experiences were significantly associated with PLEs in adolescents. Assessment and therapeutic intervention with regard to internet use as a coping strategy for stress are needed to prevent the development of clinical psychotic symptoms.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://fjfsdata01prod.blob.core.windows.net/articles/files/447649/pubmed-zip/.versions/2/.package-entries/fpsyt-10-00369.pdf?rscd=attachment%3B+filename*%3DUTF-8''fpsyt-10-00369.pdf&se=2019-09-04T06:22:46Z&sig=59cPXkBHLdjUqzGfQFXURpa%2BLWLzWTwlQ3Cu%2BRZAaIA%3D&sp=r&sr=b&sv=2015-12-11"],"title":"Negative Life Events and Problematic Internet Use as Factors Associated With Psychotic-Like Experiences in Adolescents","doi":"10.3389/fpsyt.2019.00369","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2019.00369","venue":"Front.

The recent obesity epidemic carries with it a number of anthropometric changes that have significant impact on design. We examine anthropometric change among US civilians over the last 50 years, and then examine that change in a subset of the US population--the US military--as military data sets often have more ergonomic dimensions than civilian ones. The civilian mean stature increased throughout the period 1962 to 2006 for both males and females. However, the rate of increase in mean weight was considerably faster. As a result, the male obesity rate changed from 10.7% in 1962 to 31.3% in 2006. The female change for the same period was 15.8% to 33.2%. In the Army, the proportion of obesity increased from 3.6% to 20.9%, in males. In the absence of national US ergonomic data, we demonstrate one approach to tracking civilian change in these dimensions, applying military height/weight regression equations to the civilian population estimates. This approach is useful for population monitoring but is not suitable for establishing new design limits, as regression estimates likely underestimate the change at the ends of the distribution.","inCitations":["7199d56f852b4e0882fff60ebc752598a27082c8","a1599170efe95c582823748526230e7690a87c31"],"pdfUrls":["http://content.iospress.com/download/work/wor0076?id=work/wor0076"],"title":"Anthropometric change: implications for office ergonomics.","doi":"10.3233/WOR-2012-0076-4606","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.3233/WOR-2012-0076-4606","venue":"Work"}

Therefore, generally coronary angiography is required for these patients. Our aim was to evaluate the diagnostic value of multislice spiral computed tomographic (MSCT) coronary angiography to detect CAD in patients with LBBB.\n\n\nMETHODS\nSixty one patients (31 males, 30 females, mean age: 56+/-13 years) with LBBB who have determined stenosis higher than 50% in quantitative coronary angiography were included in the cross-sectional study. The MSCT coronary angiography was applied to the patients with a 16-detector MSCT scanner that has an electrocardiographic synchronization unit. Each coronary artery was evaluated segmentally in the images acquired from MSCT coronary angiographies and any detected stenosis higher than 50% was recorded.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe data of 793 coronary artery segments achieved from MSCT coronary angiographies of 61 patients (13 segments for each patient) were compared with the results of conventional coronary angiographies of the same patients. When all the segments evaluated were included in this comparison, the diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of MSCT coronary angiography to detect stenosis higher than 50% were 91%, 67%, 97%, 85% and 92%, respectively. Also, it was observed that, MSCT coronary angiography has 80% sensitivity and 90% specificity to detect, at least, one segment coronary artery stenosis.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe MSCT coronary angiography can be utilized as a noninvasive diagnostic method for patients with LBBB, in order to evaluate coronary artery disease.","inCitations":["d1940a9e5bef817e46ba7b40d5059635d3f3fd54"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.journalagent.com/anatoljcardiol/pdfs/AnatolJCardiol_8_2_128_133.pdf"],"title":"The diagnostic value of multislice computed tomography in evaluation of coronary artery disease in patients with left bundle branch block.","doi":"","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"Anadolu kardiyoloji dergisi : AKD = the Anatolian journal of cardiology"}

This study investigated the effect of a shift from a non-grazing to a grazing diet on the rumen bacterial, methanogenic archaea, fungal, and protozoal communities. A systems biology approach based on a description of the community structure, core microbiota, network analysis, and taxon abundance linked to the rumen fermentation was used to explore the benefits of increasing depth of the community analysis. A total of 24 sheep were fed ryegrass hay supplemented with concentrate (CON) and subsequently ryegrass pasture (PAS) following a straight through experimental design. Results showed that concentrate supplementation in CON-fed animals (mainly starch) promoted a simplified rumen microbiota in terms of network density and bacterial, methanogen and fungal species richness which favored the proliferation of amylolytic microbes and VFA production (+48%), but led to a lower (ca. 4-fold) ammonia concentration making the N availability a limiting factor certain microbes. The adaptation process from the CON to the PAS diet consisted on an increase in the microbial concentration (biomass of bacteria, methanogens, and protozoa), diversity (+221, +3, and +21 OTUs for bacteria, methanogens, and fungi, respectively), microbial network complexity (+18 nodes and +86 edges) and in the abundance of key microbes involved in cellulolysis (Ruminococcus, Butyrivibrio, and Orpinomyces), proteolysis (Prevotella and Entodiniinae), lactate production (Streptococcus and Selenomonas), as well as methylotrophic archaea (Methanomassiliicoccaceae). This microbial adaptation indicated that pasture degradation is a complex process which requires a diverse consortium of microbes working together. The correlations between the abundance of microbial taxa and rumen fermentation parameters were not consistent across diets suggesting a metabolic plasticity which allowed microbes to adapt to different substrates and to shift their fermentation products. The core microbiota was composed of 34, 9, and 13 genera for bacteria, methanogens, and fungi, respectively, which were shared by all sheep, independent of diet. This systems biology approach adds a new dimension to our understanding of the rumen microbial interactions and may provide new clues to describe the mode of action of future nutritional interventions.","inCitations":["09394a1f577ff92566f07ca07180f1a1798d4b9f","f7de50159e1431069e996836256b95866e170747","5c4860978a4ba4047076c745b9a1d21db81cb550","1ced7b53e7893ddebd65840e1f46ad44b40c1515","806576ac667ffabab489d412b0002ea00c079e59","e81702e3456126676558b005fd8bd7bf2095983e"],"pdfUrls":["https://pure.aber.ac.uk/portal/files/28984563/fmicb_10_00122.pdf","https://pure.sruc.ac.uk/ws/portalfiles/portal/15222400/15042.pdf"],"title":"A Multi-Kingdom Study Reveals the Plasticity of the Rumen Microbiota in Response to a Shift From Non-grazing to Grazing Diets in Sheep","doi":"10.3389/fmicb.2019.00122","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2019.00122","venue":"Front.

Radiation doses to the involved area were 22-54 Gy (median dose, 49 Gy).\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe 5- and 10-year cause-specific survival rates were 91% and 73%, respectively. The 5- and 10-year disease-free survival rates were 83% and 59%, respectively. Eight patients developed recurrent disease: six at the local site, one in the cervical nodes, and one in the small intestine. Five of the six patients with local recurrence received less than 50 Gy. Four of the six patients developed recurrent disease in the treated area; the other two patients developed marginal recurrences. Prognostic factors such as age, sex, maximum tumor size, and lactate dehydrogenase level were of limited value.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe most common recurrence site was the local site. To improve the local control rate, the involved area should be treated with high-dose radiation therapy.

One hypothesis is that atherosclerosis makes arteries too stiff to spasm. The objective of this study was to assess the association between intracranial calcification, a marker for atherosclerosis, and vasospasm. Charts and nonenhanced computed tomography scans of patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage were retrospectively reviewed. Transcranial Doppler studies were used to categorize vasospasm using mean flow velocity: mild vasospasm 120-199 cm/second and severe ≥ 200 cm/second. Calcification of the intracranial internal carotid artery was quantified by calculating the volume and density of the calcified lesions. A total of 172 patients met study criteria (mean age, 54 ± 13 years; 88 women). Patients who had calcification (n = 90; 52%) were significantly older (61 ± 12 years vs. 46 ± 10 years; P < .0001). Mean calcification score was 532 ± 853. Calcification score was directly associated with age (P < .0001) and inversely associated with mean flow velocity (P = .0027). Only the highest tertile was independently associated with less vasospasm (odds ratio, .34; 95% confidence interval, .12-.93). There was an interaction between calcification score and age in which age greater than 65 years was only protective of vasospasm when combined with the highest calcification tertile. We conclude that intracranial calcification is associated with lower rates of vasospasm. The amount of visualized calcification inversely influences the severity of vasospasm. Calcification, and the underlying presumed atherosclerosis, maybe 1 mechanism by which vasospasm has lower frequency and severity in older age.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Intracranial vascular calcification is protective from vasospasm after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage.","doi":"10.1016/j.jstrokecerebrovasdis.2014.06.013","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jstrokecerebrovasdis.2014.06.013","venue":"Journal of stroke and cerebrovascular diseases : the official journal of National Stroke Association"}

Firstly, GO@Fe3O4@β-CD and CQDs were prepared and characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscope (SEM), UV-Vis absorption spectra (UV), fluorescence spectra (FL), fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and X-ray powder diffraction (XRD). For GO@Fe3O4@β-CD, Fe3O4 was easy to separate, GO had good biocompatibility and large specific surface area, and β-CD further increased the specific surface area of the adenosine polymers (A-Apt) to provided larger binding sites to A-Apt. Then, A-Apt was modified on the surface of GO@Fe3O4@β-CD while CQDs was modified by ssDNA (a single stranded DNA partially complementary to A-Apt). The immobilization property (GO@Fe3O4@β-CD to A-Apt) and the adsorption property (GO@Fe3O4@β-CD@A-Apt to CQDs-ssDNA) were sequentially researched. The base-supported chain-like polymers - GO@Fe3O4@β-CD@A-Apt/CQDs-ssDNA was successfully obtained. When AD existed, CQDs-ssDNA was released from the surface of GO@Fe3O4@β-CD@A-Apt and catalyzed CL. After that, under optimized CL conditions, AD could be measured with the linear concentration range of 5.0 × 10-13-5.0 × 10-9 mol/L and the detection limit of 2.1 × 10-13 mol/L (3δ) while the relative standard deviation (RSD) was 1.4%. Finally, the GO@Fe3O4@β-CD@A-Apt/CQDs-ssDNA-CL biosensor was used for the determination of AD in urine samples and recoveries ranged from 98.6% to 101.0%. Those satisfactory results illustrated the proposed CL biosensor could achieve highly selective, sensitive and reliable detection of AD and revealed potential application for AD detection in monitoring and diagnosis of human cancers.","inCitations":["c9341ad08bf01c428fad114f56da49721c59a49f","1c0632546cfb4eedbd5aa6235b8c035d67c8e221"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Highly selective and sensitive chemiluminescence biosensor for adenosine detection based on carbon quantum dots catalyzing luminescence released from aptamers functionalized graphene@magnetic β-cyclodextrin polymers.","doi":"10.1016/j.talanta.2018.04.068","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2018.04.068","venue":"Talanta"}

During the Cold War, many American adults feared that boys lacked the \"masculine'' qualities required by future defenders of the United States. Believing that boys needed additional instruction in appropriate gender behavior, educators turned to a new film genre: the classroom instructional film. Films in this genre emphasized the importance of patriotism, respect for order and authority, and the need for emotional and physical discipline in American males. Television shows and toy commercials also encouraged boys to envision themselves as future soldiers and defenders of freedom. Keywords: COLD WAR, GENDER ROLES, INSTRUCTIONAL FILMS, MILITARY, TOY COMMERCIALS Upset that 5-year-old Paul would rather play on the kitchen floor with his pet turtle than eat breakfast at the table with his parents, Paul's father Jim angrily informs Helen, his wife and Paul's mother, that it is time that Paul learns a \"sense of responsibility.\" By the end of the movie in which this scene appears, Fears of Children (1951), viewers have learned the reasons for Paul's fears and his defiant behavior: he needs to assert himself because his mother treats him like a \"baby\" by, for example, not letting him climb on rocks or play with children's scissors. His closeness to his mother has also led to his resentment of his father. Mothers, the film teaches, should not make their sons afraid to engage in harmless pursuits. Likewise, fathers should allow their sons to yell at them occasionally and to destroy their toys when they feel frustrated. Risk-taking and aggressive behavior are all part of being a boy. According to the film, attempts by parents to thwart such behavior harm a boy's development and risk turning him into both a \"sissy\" who remains abnormally attached to his mother and a sociopath who fantasizes about killing his father (as Paul does when he deliberately \"drowns\" the teddy bear that his father gave him). People today might find such a message familiar, especially if they, like Paul, grew up in the 1950s and 1960s, the height of the Cold War. During this period in American history, parents feared that, unless properly trained and actively encouraged to engage in appropriate gender behavior, children would be unable to adopt the \"correct\" gender role for their sex upon becoming adults. This fear was especially pronounced among the parents of boys. While girls who behaved like boys were often a source of humor in popular culture, boys who early in life did not display such manly traits as self-control, patriotism, assertiveness, and a disdain for all things feminine were often a source of anxiety. Perhaps unwittingly, Paul's parents, like other parents of the 1950s and 1960s (and as many gender theorists now argue), believed that \"masculinity\" was not synonymous with \"maleness,\" and that being born with an X and a Y chromosome did not make a male a man. Parents of the Cold War understood that masculinity was a social construct that was \"constantly created and challenged\" and that \"discourse constructs the ideology of masculinity\" (Reeser, 2010, pp. 18, 23). While nineteenth-century parents had not found it odd when male children played with dolls, American parents of the Cold War era found the same behavior to be deeply unsettling because the nature of the discourse had changed (Formanek-Brunell, 1992, pp. 120-121). Where nineteenth-century medical and pedagogical texts had stressed the innateness of \"male\" and \"female\" behavior (and had assumed that male behavior would naturally manifest itself only in those children with male bodies and only children with female bodies would develop female behaviors), medical, psychological, and childrearing texts of the mid- to late twentieth century regarded masculinity and femininity not as inborn traits but as behavioral habits that must be \"imposed\" on children (Reeser, p. …","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Wally Cleaver Goes to War: The Boy Citizen-Soldier on the Cold War Screen","doi":"10.3149/thy.0501.163","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.3149/thy.0501.163","venue":""}

Neuronal isoform glycine transporter-2 (GlyT2) reuptakes presynaptically released glycine and regulates the glycinergic neurotransmission. In this study, we examined whether a selective GlyT2 inhibitor, ALX1393, elicits an antinociceptive effect in a rat acute pain model.\n\n\nMETHODS\nMale Sprague-Dawley rats were implanted with a catheter intrathecally. The effects of intrathecal administration of ALX1393 (4, 20, or 40 microg) on thermal, mechanical, and chemical nociception were evaluated by tail flick, hot plate, paw pressure, and formalin tests. Furthermore, to explore whether ALX1393 affects motor function, a rotarod test was performed.\n\n\nRESULTS\nALX1393 exhibited antinociceptive effects on the thermal and mechanical stimulations in a dose-dependent manner. The maximal effect of ALX1393 was observed at 15 min after administration, and a significant effect lasted for about 60 min. These antinociceptive effects were reversed completely by strychnine injected immediately after the administration of ALX1393. In the formalin test, ALX1393 inhibited pain behaviors in a dose-dependent manner, both in the early and late phases, although the influence was greater in the late phase. In contrast to antinociceptive action, ALX1393 did not affect motor function up to 40 microg.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThis study demonstrates the antinociceptive action of ALX1393 on acute pain. These findings suggest that the inhibitory neurotransmitter transporters are promising targets for the treatment of acute pain and that the selective inhibitor of GlyT2 could be a novel therapeutic drug.","inCitations":["9bb878818c57646583c7dc759cc1f6c388106d97","0a9375c487c734424d556f90b419c2d6a99453bb","d7834c78c8d819f468fed5e4c9fa0c69c1b1c661","0b696f8fa76e6e2b408e5633199bc0766dffad90","3a6ea2b4a8dd6c5f65a7838c7a4cae3967c5e31f","c0ea6488f1c0924920be9a3f5a21b6207019a499","26f20fa82a74bc09713bb4f51ecc9714fb1e395a","ee1381236fd2d5db97e90d3418799c413d535f0a","ec48fb9ae264b44e8459f61e226a52561ed06095","c492a0f40c7c0be8673562fef2a654d88f3f0eda","7a5a1ae2f6edad6836204e6197ac2bfb4639c6cb","72c8728b1e16b64a458e2e1a969175c03e30cf6d","fdae2160381d03523e35e27a68ff0f9abfacef6c","f30fb2e119c245e89cbd9d36550c15832fadeb2a","00e41c4e779ee79a4f336b02a5f9b54dc16b920e","9ed3cde040a1ea0adcb85361b66f81d398a3ee8c","7f97b003af65e7465836337628d088b030154748","c6e4767ba53aaf7b60b7691392e038c1fbf1cd7e","6eda132d2f32b840bcf30f59cedd3dde10c0d105","30f52fc8953d19895e701eba68efcf405a0ba9d4","9b82d08ce6e81f5039629c20f851533f000d3ef2","667a7a7a2f766376e4af1605f1e6344a669c7383","c2978f4186b0876fac8ada101e7a0de51eb4dbff","d23e043bccc320b8fda26521415d66e9480106d7","58e72ad8a6b39be3d940f09916fbc5f1b69ce529","63ae0200b6e221c5e8f0c1489e1b2d9ad3a1f67d"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"The antinociceptive effect of intrathecal administration of glycine transporter-2 inhibitor ALX1393 in a rat acute pain model.","doi":"10.1213/ANE.0b013e3181c7ebbb","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1213/ANE.0b013e3181c7ebbb","venue":"Anesthesia and analgesia"}

As ubiquitous chromatin opening elements (UCOEs) have been successfully employed to stabilize transgene expression in murine hematopoietic and pluripotent stem cells as well as their differentiated progeny, we here investigated UCOE activity in their human counterparts to establish a basis for future clinical application of the element. To this end, we demonstrate profound anti-silencing activity of the A2UCOE in several human iPS and ES cell lines including their progeny obtained upon directed cardiac or hematopoietic differentiation. We also provide evidence for A2UCOE activity in murine iPSC-derived hepatocyte-like cells, thus establishing efficacy of the element in cells of different germ layers. Finally, we investigated combinations of the A2UCOE with viral promoter/enhancer elements again demonstrating profound stabilization of transgene expression. In all these settings the effect of the A2UCOE was associated with strongly reduced promoter DNA-methylation. Thus, our data clearly support the concept of the A2UCOE as a generalized strategy to prevent epigenetic silencing in PSC and their differentiated progeny and strongly favors its application to stabilize transgene expression in PSC-based cell and gene therapy approaches.","inCitations":["7af3e31127395c3d1a70508cc694d245bbf3854c","15c816598f1582b5f175cda476d4e7db44d476bc","428be05999fd1c3d310d2039977c20bb9c537ba1","7932061b5ee53db74667901a27d0063403b420fa","b21ca1e70e7d2af90447f2bf5c473b654b5fdfa0","7e7dd2c3c588647af4866f3bb8ff30cda966d7ef","fad5ab8d29972c10058b076f44ed00696304792f","4985e16e4bddfdff248b02c1f5f52bfcec9368bf","8ada6f3d66daba923310f094d50fa31e9f68b445","40da56371078e0ad9725308511237b39646cb98f","3e7534916f9b2481ab562154dac926895a997e59","906cb650d7508ce6c5ed99181ace22f6d0ab54b2","bc275122df18d7be5f6daff4f952c8ee6cf7730f","2d0b504dceca5f8d70ba55984b943faec359567a","4543220de4185cf9da8892107483b1f32e7d8ff8","d97c58232a8cdf46913404e0e0408b147b8c4227","64224abf535f5b156000bc79006cb165b29ac6dd","3e7548879709cd53af6558918fa0ba26d98408fa","f7277f4c68137854cc3805ba25ad3388fda1a0c6","1e1d9de8c9c5b0f172558cdf23d733b027d585f4","9260ecb9a430490dfdc5d3fe2ae9f91c0c934c9b","bfbce9f2451c262dc30ab8d0902ca6a592a572d7","22c544ee7b8b2b14d9f5ef6cfef7695730586bdf","1fd2cb6f4f060499979b9de7c0c3cdac432823e1","7c00fdfc229803c2cbc9db72da3a59310b66940f","0b5cc906a42b881bbb7187dab290a9e53bbd7689","9c9a72d986012d567dccdf1f0ac79267165dc608"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Promoter and lineage independent anti-silencing activity of the A2 ubiquitous chromatin opening element for optimized human pluripotent stem cell-based gene therapy.","doi":"10.1016/j.biomaterials.2013.11.024","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2013.11.024","venue":"Biomaterials"}

In the present study, oxygen deficient vanadium oxide (V2O3) has been synthesized in an autoclave at 500 °C for 4 h. The reaction temperature, time and atmosphere affect the pure phase formation of V2O3. The structural, morphological and surface characteristics of pure phase V2O3 has been analysed by X-ray diffraction (XRD), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), respectively. The phase transition with respect to temperature has been confirmed by thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity has been studied in an acidic medium. The synthesized sample shows higher cyclic stability for 1000 cyclic voltammetry (CV) cycles. It also exhibits a lower Tafel slope of 81.2 mVdec−1. The electrochemical double layer capacitance (EDLC) measurements was done via CV measurements performed at various scan rates. The observed EDLC value of synthesized sample is 242.6 μFcm−2. The study predicts potential applications of V2O3 nano structures for electrochemical applications like HER and supercapacitors.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Oxygen deficient V2O3: A stable and efficient electrocatalyst for HER and high performance EDLCs","doi":"10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.09.023","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.09.023","venue":""}

In this scope, hydro resources are becoming extremely valuable given the revenues that their operation can generate. In this paper we describe the application of the Matlab® Linprog optimization function to solve the Short Term Hydro Scheduling Problem, HSP, admitting that some stations are installed in the same cascade and that some of them have pumping capabilities. The optimization module to solve the HSP problem is then integrated in an iterative process to take into account the impact that the operation decisions regarding the hydro stations under analysis have on the market prices. The updated market prices are then used to run again the HSP problem thus enabling considering the hydro stations as price makers. The developed approach is illustrated using a system based on the Portuguese Douro River cascade that includes 9 hydro stations (4 of them are pumping stations) and a total installed capacity of 1485 MW.","inCitations":["383bfdbf7022f6534a867cd1c17e8bda762f59eb","a633144f142d268b036483d61bc7fe468342d9d3","5502de16944f179a0aed51567c8990045aadea54"],"pdfUrls":["https://repositorio-aberto.up.pt/bitstream/10216/84392/2/137670.pdf"],"title":"Application of the Matlab® Linprog function to plan the short term operation of hydro stations considered as price makers","doi":"10.1109/EEM.2016.7521186","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EEM.2016.7521186","venue":"2016 13th International Conference on the European Energy Market (EEM)"}

The production and export performance of turmeric in India have been examined using secondary data for the period from 1974-75 to 2007-08 and exponential form of growth function has been used for the analysis. The growth in production and export of turmeric has been reported significant, because of the high demand coupled with inflation. Instability index has been worked for the production and export for preliberalization and post-liberalization periods. Instability has been observed high for production, export and prices of domestic and international markets and domestic and international prices have shown high integration. For the assessment of direction of trade, the Markov chain model has been used. The data regarding country-wise export of turmeric has shown that the previous export share retention for Indian turmeric has been high in minor importing countries (pooled under others category) (87 %), followed by UAE (49 %), Iran (41 %) and UK (35 %). The countries such as USA and Japan have not been the stable importers of Indian turmeric. The plans for export may be oriented towards these two countries and also plans should be formulated for stabilizing the export of turmeric to other countries. The farmers should be provided training on production of a quality product.","inCitations":["44efc237a784dd0775aa4279ecf4e65643598765","46d010c9eb31788f129a716a9634f5e68022e160","88c0ed0d61637fadcf53d1e4d464811398895d72","c36ff4bb52e45ac6ca43f7bca8f82bbeeff0db0b","b32bec85cc31ccdb496811d30415766ed5c218ee","a2939b96cf1ec3ee3f37aba24fd05814c1b4bffb","ba53389c24f265b1bb4ec7eff5fbd13a1bd2be04","d7db79243bf59311bc7a0d33a1e3d58b7526bad8","e8bf3d4d4c698f3ac2b5b840af7d6c524532cfea","2db003aa635bb6d3b3e89719a9e2149ad27bbead","70830eee61c45744b36c83330e1a252613e03245","f5c99c9b41112fc815ea8264aa6905b9a24b4a9b","962020a0cf89a14fc8b45de712490a9f2be4cf79","8119d0f67fc300a74429e6038a65d7c3e0940abb","2fd2d95f4e5ebe89d67868bd6e4d92f1d3d4b9b7","3c744fd4d9540c3a420d33aba5ae4e7f57649e04","b71985cc45608df93689feb0748ff43b7fe7b6e3"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Impact of Globalization on Production and Export of Turmeric in India: An Economic Analysis","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}
