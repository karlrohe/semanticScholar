We investigated how and why snow patch vegetation and snow incidence varied over recent decades in Tasmania, Australia. Landsat images between 1983 and 2013 were used to calculate the proportion of clear days with snow visible on Mt Field. We compared average annual snow incidence on 74 Tasmanian alpine mountains for 1983–1996 with that for 1997–2013 using the small subset of Landsat runs in which most of Tasmania was clear of cloud. We related the temporal data from Mt Field to Tasmanian climatic data and climate indices to determine the predictors of change. We recorded plant species and life form cover from quadrats in transects through a snow patch on Mt Field in 1983, 2001 and 2014, and mapped decadal scale changes in boundaries and shrub cover at five other snow patches across the extent of the Tasmanian alpine areas from aerial photographs. The incidence of snow fluctuated between 1983 and 2013 at Mt Field with no overall trend. Snow incidence was less on lower elevation alpine mountains in the period 1997–2013 than in the period 1983–1996, but showed a weak opposite trend on mountains higher than 1350 m. The contrast in trends may be a consequence of the effect on lapse rates of stronger frontal winds associated with a steepening of latitudinal pressure gradients. At Mt Field, bare ground decreased, cover of cushion plants and tall shrubs increased and obligate snow patch species were persistent. The trends we observed in both vegetation and snow incidence differ markedly from those observed on mainland Australia. The increase in shrub cover and decrease in bare ground on Mt Field were unexpected, given the constancy in incidence of snow. These results may relate to ongoing recovery from a fire in the 1960s, as the shrub species that have increased are fire-sensitive, obligate seeders and there has been no indication of warming since 1983 in the climatic record for western Tasmania. There is a possibility that some Tasmanian alpine areas might act as long-term refugia from general warming.","inCitations":["d441c364bae491db0a126a0c82346f73777c25f8","5796a8de155e5bb9437966e26c3cdf56ac45c067"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Causes and consequences of variation in snow incidence on the high mountains of Tasmania, 1983-2013","doi":"10.1071/BT16179","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1071/BT16179","venue":""}

We aimed define factors that affect local tumour control and patient survival.MethodsA single institution registry study of 89 patients with non-metastatic soft-tissue sarcomas having preoperative radiotherapy between 1994 and 2014. Radiologic (presence of peritumoural oedema and volume change following radiotherapy) and histopathologic (tumour volume, grade and surgical margin) parameters were recorded. Outcomes were the events of local recurrence, amputation, metastasis and death.ResultsLocal recurrence rate was low (12%) and marginal excision gave equal local control to wide excision. Pelvic localization was associated with a higher risk for amputation. The absence of peritumoural oedema on MRI defined a subgroup of tumours with more favourable oncologic outcome. Reduction of tumour volume following radiotherapy was also associated with better patient survival. Both these radiologic parameters were associated with lower tumour grade. Tumour necrosis was not significant for patient survival. The local complication rate, mainly wound healing problems and infection, was high (40%), but did not lead to any amputation.ConclusionPreoperative radiotherapy of high-risk soft-tissue sarcomas allows for good local control rate at the expense of local wound complications, which are however manageable. Marginal excision is sufficient for local control. Absence of peritumoural oedema on MRI, as well as tumour size reduction following radiotherapy are associated to superior patient survival and can be used ass early prognostic factors.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://clinicalsarcomaresearch.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s13569-018-0106-x"],"title":"Preoperative radiotherapy of soft-tissue sarcomas: surgical and radiologic parameters associated with local control and survival","doi":"10.1186/s13569-018-0106-x","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s13569-018-0106-x","venue":"Clinical Sarcoma Research"}

As part of the fiscal consolidation implemented by the UK government, grants to local authorities in England were cut by more than a third in real terms between 2009–10 and 2014–15. With limited revenue-raising powers, these cuts meant drastic reductions in local authority spending in total and per person: local authority spending per person fell in real terms by 23.4 per cent over this period. But the size of spending cuts per person differed greatly across local authorities, ranging from 46.3 per cent to 6.2 per cent. On average, the distribution of the cuts across authorities does not seem to reflect the principle of ‘equalisation’ that was, at least in theory, in place up until 2013–14; the local authorities with least revenue-raising capacity (which are typically the most deprived) have on average actually seen the largest spending cuts. Moreover, this pattern looks set to continue over the next five years, with those authorities that have seen the largest cuts to date also expected to see the largest cuts in future.","inCitations":["21b225d664ac705cad9a6c8b88ec114ff2af8d8e","d50a95c6478ea285e884afd9d37defacb7826f8f","97b9cf031a32578ec0c8ead7c5fd7b891d111b9d","708fa395e91755145cf8d1536c2ba88585b4ac90","39e254f7b5ce8b031fe9dd934c06dc6bd55fb3a4","9f338463701200e6a215da5f12c53c81bef84eaa","c640f292b12bc11e179c81efce68ccaa9a1b5368","0278be9de2bcfaec5b78f5967798524acdea94bd","94423f539458008f2864dc1d4c49530776e1d324","8f1377d80315ff4361b6c96af12f5fa3402d3c0f","30ba07022261a4f0977d01ba3bf7acb2a606122b","4db3d1c28b100e4b6da05a1acf7c78cf761956bb","edeff68f87693bac6ca0138461ccc473c89c8beb","92e65c1f597de548188041eda0525d1a101edb04","3b6640061d56e5364c96e7774fcf050af7aad765","cd5e36ac7a51e9f2a7132d771f3f122053413929"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Delivering Fiscal Squeeze by Cutting Local Government Spending","doi":"10.1111/j.1475-5890.2015.12056","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1475-5890.2015.12056","venue":""}

In IL-1β-treated fibroblast cultures collagen production decreased by 15% and following PGE2 treatment by 34% compared with the controls. The latter effect could be abolished by indomethacin.

The investigated parameters were included the receiver aperture area (a 2 ), receiver tube diameter, cavity depth, inlet temperature and mass flow rate through the receiver. This cavity receiver is used as the heat source of the organic Rankine cycle (ORC). The ORC system is considered with R141b as the working fluid at the saturated condition. The main objective is the calculation of the optimum parameters for attaining the maximum overall thermal efficiency of the system. With the help of the receiver modeling techniques, the optimum aspect ratios of 54.25, 40.69, 32.56, 23.25 and 18.09 are identified for five cavity depths of 0.5a, 0.75a, 1a, 1.5a, and 2a where the accompanying optical efficiencies are 89%, 92%, 94%, 96% and 96%, respectively. It is concluded that for increasing the collector efficiency and overall thermal efficiency, a higher mass flow rate, and a lower inlet thermal oil inlet temperature are required. Also the results show that the optimum characteristic of the cavity for achieving highest collector efficiency and the highest overall thermal efficiency includes smaller tube diameter, lower inlet temperature of the working fluid, and the cavity depth of 1a.","inCitations":["e3e1c92ff38dd9b31210d82acaf547bd2b367a6a","4fc406d019fcecc24e35d1936997ea9dc5a6ed48","c3881ebda5416a3d924a35a1ffc0bff644718565","82407fa1db9d42fdc516e7ce53cf88253680b355","1355444c1156e26cbc52ca8793bfb2cb12dde846","0c8a277501694c22e0be4d4ddc63a5ee88e60dd5"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Performance study of a solar-assisted organic Rankine cycle using a dish-mounted rectangular-cavity tubular solar receiver","doi":"10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2016.08.014","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2016.08.014","venue":""}

Traditionally, the procedure requires the presence of a interventional cardiologist who carries out transseptal catheterization following arterial puncture and placement of a reference pigtail catheter in the aortic root. Use of His bundle and coronary sinus catheters to provide anatomical and electrophysiological landmarks enables transseptal catheterization to be carried out without the need for arterial puncture or intracavity pressure measurement. We report our experience with transseptal catheterization in an electrophysiology laboratory using only electrophysiological landmarks. The procedure was carried out on 68 occasions and was successful in all patients except one, in whom catheterization could not be performed for anatomical reasons and because the patient had previously received anticoagulation therapy. One other patient developed transient ST elevation, which was probably due to an air embolism.","inCitations":["9144ae709ed55f7a64d601725cf3ac90fd3b12f4","53fe55d464caf6bd26a2e744df3e6773f3cae0c6","b0497325da49bd1dee121371600796ddb6f37fca","718f889145b78e652bcbf0feb3b2349c32e30ffa","9fb441a4564fe5f90aacac4c606b7e2ad5d581e2"],"pdfUrls":["http://appswl.elsevier.es/watermark/ctl_servlet?_f=10&accion=L&anuncioPdf=ERROR_publi_pdf&fichero=255v60n01a13098658pdf001.pdf&lan=en&origen=cardio&pcontactid=&pident_articulo=13098658&pident_revista=255&pident_usuario=0&ty=58&web=www.revespcardiol.org","http://apps.elsevier.es/watermark/ctl_servlet?_f=10&accion=L&fichero=255v60n01a13098658pdf001.pdf&origen=cardioeng&pident_articulo=13098658&pident_revista=255&pident_usuario=0&ty=58&web=www.reves","http://apps.elsevier.es/watermark/ctl_servlet?_f=10&accion=L&fichero=255v60n01a13098658pdf001.pdf&lan=en&origen=cardioeng&pident_articulo=13098658&pident_revista=255&pident_usuario=0&ty=58&web=www.revespcardiol.org","https://www.revespcardiol.org/index.php?p=revista&pii=13098658&tipo=pdf-simple"],"title":"[Transseptal catheterization using electrophysiological landmarks in ablation procedures].","doi":"10.1016/S1885-5857(07)60111-X","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/S1885-5857%2807%2960111-X","venue":"Revista espanola de cardiologia"}

Radiological evaluation of symptomatic individuals is a cornerstone in the diagnostic workup, and should be based on precise and reliable diagnostic terms and imaging techniques. The authors performed a review of the existing original evidence-based radiological literature involving radiography, ultrasonography and MRI in athletes with long-standing symphyseal and adductor-related groin pain. Our search yielded 17 original articles, of which 12 were dedicated to MRI, four to radiography and one to ultrasonography. Four main radiological findings seem to consistently appear: degenerative changes at the pubic symphyseal joint, pathology at the adductor muscle insertions, pubic bone marrow oedema and the secondary cleft sign. However, the existing diagnostic terminology is confusing, and the interpretation of radiological findings would benefit from imaging studies using a more systematic approach.","inCitations":["c7788a6aaf70995e5a690b9bc04a0d40cc267bee","1cbd0f4f4f612ac5d8ed5800940caed4056dde62","df4ab8c5af25f6e48ed3d246fba147061856d9ed","32b7bd0552d8fa2d63ab8a5e76a9a0b65f9bb429","614efb3fc8353f7cff4e2b1935e54d5a7670347e","8394e3230e61777c0b82731ac4d3ee466f1b4a34","17f0da37c7a6a60984fdfdf9b1f94cd173623ab5","d1be49fd7cb4bdde36e6ab56cf6b8334751a91ef","bfedc16d727a6e6639651af7b6d1cb8a7fd7a159","d6458970d60ab98e3f48d47523e9c011274696e0","3f25daa0d6364f8295a3b3ec990a37031adf6248","dab133d6b85440ec5b512eb168003b0dfa82479a","96b493aaec44d1add5e958ff7505c45500f8a507","75e9b8fabf75f3ab2d29e0eed1d0a0f039312054","a231a25118190d77a3ff845ba8e758bee41f8e09","15d90cab9bbe987e9370ac58a1973c56223513aa","1951259f1872f430529cc323e034be4520f2e6ae","10374065b0da8f88356694dd7da88d4265455bb0","67b2abb1730bfb0d46d4861193367565d783da80","1d39af377360f4e858a5cb2e3bf05246ecb55dd7","fa7aa9c6751738a525733f28dc575a8e19986870","dfbef704545b15c5cbf1521c39699b5600db4380","ebcfd331ce530fd628b0862c5fbdffa375a28a1f","f9c3b3507a6396062ce078c333851afb4b25e493","b084b4d69d0490d6ceb409934aaea2b190413629","be563c03ed821d60ff216f362578f13e233c2e67","ab10e2ddfeb130db95208cd0d536c49baa7c9349"],"pdfUrls":["http://bjsm.bmj.com/content/bjsports/47/10/611.full.pdf"],"title":"Radiological findings in symphyseal and adductor-related groin pain in athletes: a critical review of the literature.","doi":"10.1136/bjsports-2012-091905","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1136/bjsports-2012-091905","venue":"British journal of sports medicine"}

Diese wiederum gehoren zur Superfamilie der EF-Hand-Calcium-Bindungsproteine. Von den vier EF-Handen ist bei NCS-Proteinen die erste nicht funktionell. Zudem sind die NCS-Proteine uberwiegend N-Terminal myristoyliert. Beides gilt auch fur GCAPs. Bisher wurden neun Mitglieder der GCAP-Familie entdeckt. Neben den langer bekannten GCAP1-3 wurden kurzlich im Zebrafisch die zapfenspezifischen GCAP4, 5 und 7 (zGCAPs) entdeckt. Wohingegen gerade GCAP1-2 gut charakterisiert sind, ist uber die zGCAPs wenig bekannt. Uber GCAP1-2 ist bekannt, dass sie calciumabhangige Konformationsanderungen eingehen und ihr Zielenzym, die Gyanylate Cyclase (GC), calciumabhangig regulieren. Bei hohen intrazellularen Calciumkonzentrationen inhibieren sie die GC, bei niedrigen aktivieren die GCAPs sie. Damit spielen sie eine wichtige Rolle in der Phototransduktion und Lichtadaptation. Auch bei zGCAP4 konnten mittlerweile calcium-abhangige Konformationsanderungen und eine calciumabhangige Regulation der GC gezeigt werden.\nIn dieser Arbeit konnte zGCAP4 zunachst durch die heterologe Expression in E. coli und Reinigung als Wildtyp, als A6S-Mutante (zur hinreichenden Myristoylierung) und als myristoylierte Mutante (was per Reversed Phase-Chromatographie sichergestellt wurde) in ausreichenden Mengen fur Experimente gewonnen werden. Mit dem gereinigten zGCAP4 konnten dann verschiedene Experimente zur Bindung von Ca2+-Ionen an dieses durchgefuhrt werden. Zum einen wurde die elektrophoretische Mobilitat von zGCAP4 untersucht, die wie bisher auch unter Ca2+-Einfluss hoher, unter Mg2+-Einfluss aber wesentlich niedriger war. Zum anderen wurde ein Ca2+-Bindungs-Assay mit dem Fluoreszenzfarbstoff Fura-2 als Ca2+-Indikator etabliert, der fur alle zGCAP4-Varianten (und auch fur myrbGCAP2) die Bindung von 3 Ca2+-Ionen ergab. Allerdings scheint es, dass tatsachlich nur 2 Ca2+-Ionen titriert wurden und dass dritte lediglich auf die Insensitivtat des Fura-2 zuruckzufuhren war. Daneben wurden mit dem zGCAP4 auch isotherme Titrationscalorimetrien (ITCs) durchgefuhrt. Die dabei erhaltenen Titrationskurven konnten mit einem Kurvenanpassungsmodell fur 2 voneinander unabhangige Bindestellen von Ca2+-Ionen an zGCAP4 am besten beschrieben werden, ebenfalls ein Hinweis auf nur 2 titrierte Ca2+-Ionen. Bei beiden Experimenten ist dies aber wohl auf eine unzureichende Decalcifizierung des zGCAP4 zuruckzufuhren. Auserdem hat sich gezeigt, dass die Ergebnisse des Ca2+-Bindungs-Assays und der ITCs miteinander korrelieren.

Mutations that truncate the extracellular domain of Notch receptors can cause aberrant signaling and promote unregulated cell growth. We have examined two types of truncated Notch oncoproteins that arise from proviral insertion into the Notch4 gene (Notch4/int-3) or a chromosomal translocation involving the Notch1 gene (TAN-1). Both Notch4/int-3 and TAN-1 oncoproteins lack most or all of their ectodomain. Normal Notch signaling requires gamma-secretase/presenilin-mediated proteolytic processing, but whether Notch oncoproteins are also dependent on gamma-secretase/presenilin activity is not known. We demonstrate that Notch4/int-3-induced activation of the downstream transcription factor, CSL, is abrogated in cells deficient in presenilins or treated with a pharmacological inhibitor of gamma-secretase/presenilins. Furthermore, we find that both Notch4/int-3 and TAN-1 accumulate at the cell surface, where presenilin-dependent cleavage occurs, when gamma-secretase/presenilin activity is inhibited. gamma-Secretase/presenilin inhibition effectively blocks cellular responses to Notch4/int-3, but not TAN-1, apparently because some TAN-1 polypeptides lack transmembrane domains and do not require gamma-secretase/presenilin activity for nuclear access. These studies highlight potential uses and limitations of gamma-secretase/presenilin inhibitors in targeted therapy of Notch-related neoplasms.","inCitations":["bc4ffeb65176e8b4bf766ff16a12cad06ce6b2fa","ec4a064a8d8628f1eb47ee7f880fa17ae9a69e03","5be03230715f1d8b9e9a0a9a1a375e4f1ff87f95","e96f66f23329e86bbf9a720a029dd3e4854991ec","4502b8594cb34dfe6a562dee076f61bfe9eb67d9","75f7c4c2b10efe379dd15d1258eace5fc9cae7b8","be2dac62cfaf0962e0e6212a0de907938c27fedf","1261c2cc7013c192148af25d8c5c4baf49a74e13","978ca69fbfd0edb53ef069d77cce0e554efe4b8e","8e04ca1e21998d34055ceec75f02b4ae3fcad2a2","255dde9095b3e80d4c869db37aea0603987b15a2","fcdd9f59c7e05223bff9f40c0a76b100d68914f1","a585cfb49d0b2a8346913cfd2d03f346d52b2eca","c08734f5d68cb490f5532067ebc11b964057ae9e","13e84e87cf8bf09ae209792d01f1f77e68eb3df2","f98ef685dcf7911183311bad680e071dbc2a30fd","b1974dd8f58219b665e40c786f3b478c8765f5eb","2398cc7583c6ab418e194dd1204ef8d8a943c579","36260e5ded2d5369e83d7a4b5195b2bb721f1168","6c5b591ea40f4fbc9954aec0bd94f5a59e5bb43b","68185e8e53ea927aa11c8d39fe85a5a992d20186","ff8076ed34bd848b72a514b7fdf262c64ead7b22","f4be852d644c7e343d5808cb844fa5ef8086db46","d979780f2c5cb57cc45a342eb7f16def6d0a2e67","00feb5016374d02372704f95423adcfd8cef6e0f","0a8f95aa54d907fa0e8a39355ec501832278693f","8ed90181505fc127115087fa145e20f9383c1fd5","1d97c70f21fe48f4f7a57c14ca3928f7d0195105","8093298a99b4c5809164c2af18741c15c42a1832","3d2a9898e455496122b7ac2bfcf38f79499cf3fa","68798678868e84b109cf0daffdd5624c5b06e018","55ff538016e07e98c48ae347315316679da23e10","d3d496fdd87ef59ea45ce1042edd6e9c0bbaf5dc","77e6165bb1d960916530ac65e524cebf9b336c13","357aea76b1e084bedc65c89ee5f7b83bbdbdb00b","6bb1258a9f3ee9f99947a171c7b32e0da1bcb037","9ea28adb800e3c2786a03ac8b8ee451176cd12fa","191b33b5b81c9dbadd172f9ddff70a522ca9e0ab"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Notch oncoproteins depend on gamma-secretase/presenilin activity for processing and function.","doi":"","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"The Journal of biological chemistry"}

In order to efficiently discover and manage the large amount of geospatial services, these services are registered with semantic descriptions and categorized into classes according to certain taxonomies. Most taxonomies for geospatial services are only provided in the human readable format. The lack of semantic description for taxonomies limits the semantic-based discovery of geospatial services. The objectives of this paper are proposing an approach to semantically describe the taxonomy of geospatial services and using the semantic descriptions for taxonomy to improve the discovery of geospatial services. A semantic description framework is introduced for geospatial service taxonomy to describe not only the hierarchical structure of classes but also the definitions for all classes. The semantic description of taxonomy base on this framework is further used to simplify the semantic description and registration of geospatial services and enhance the semantic-based service matching method.","inCitations":["73603ee677c4ae3f85ccd72e551e049c27d4f20c","c70bf4b681e16cdd59032c1ed702221c10427fd6"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.scielo.br/pdf/bcg/v21n3/1982-2170-bcg-21-03-00515.pdf","https://revistas.ufpr.br/bcg/article/download/43235/26251"],"title":"Semantic Description for the Taxonomy of the Geospatial Services","doi":"10.1590/S1982-21702015000300029","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1590/S1982-21702015000300029","venue":""}

This research provides numerical elementsin terms of significance of the security issue in Latin America, and at the same time, proposes a system dynamicsassessment model based on real-life information, able to establish analysis scenarios in order to measure the impactsderived of supply chain disruptions propagation caused by criminal acts. Finally, useful conclusions for designingmore resilient supply chains and future research are exposed.","inCitations":["fdc59719513e789da16dba2c81e0ccfafa6012f3"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.scielo.org.mx/pdf/jart/v12n4/v12n4a6.pdf","http://www.jart.ccadet.unam.mx/jart/vol12_4/6_supplyChain.pdf"],"title":"Supply Chain Disruptions Propagation Caused by Criminal Acts","doi":"10.1016/S1665-6423(14)70085-9","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/S1665-6423%2814%2970085-9","venue":""}

During personal interviews, 9% reported drinking heavily, 37% moderately, and 53% rarely or not at all. The women who drank heavily differed from the rest of the pregnant population on several traits, including age, education, use of cigarettes, marijuana and other drugs, parity, and association with others who drank heavily. Multiple regression analysis revealed that these traits had little predictive power for whether a woman was a heavy drinker. A systematic drinking history remains the most practical method in identifying problem drinkers.","inCitations":["4bcef1061a89f1e105bbb3850c4af347e9f5e611","06e01cf73e728bdce229402b30659b59a1deb2a4","6213a6d5f9435f81aa0c92337c95d066fe3f9a66","cddca13c0486342b034f30f5b27688265ed2833a","a2230a82fdbcd385e522c32ff01c63a77bba80ed","7bc8e3719ef63ff610f4d75b4bf5614539eb1599","12ba062bb163447adfd27625bc4b27092d5ab6cb","5eda6342968f55f72cd79c4d726ebb4758d604bb","42183dba71169f6a111132913c1102f5d098229a","b3bea9a522152785f46df9c2d571169cacc24eb5","5c7d0cc9efea7327733884e6adb27b458b8b0dd1","8cf8af4d6713eec5b3b3c5a26eeb2bec017ee779","1882e8021b20eea82056bb87814d13cec1a982af"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Alcohol consumption by pregnant women.","doi":"","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"Obstetrics and gynecology"}

To remedy this problem, it was decided to drive the ohmic heating (OH) system at 24 kA instead of the design value of 20 kA in mode B. Precautionary fault analyses had to be made before machine operation could be attempted at these levels to lessen the possibility of a coil failure since such a failure would have been catastrophic. Additionally, the time schedule called for a prolonged shutdown within a 12-week period from the time this study was undertaken, and it was desired to perform these experimental runs before the shutdown; therefore the study had to be completed several weeks before this shutdown.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"TFTR poloidal coil fault analysis","doi":"10.13182/FST86-A24874","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.13182/FST86-A24874","venue":""}

We find that increasing temperature reduces the Rashba splitting, with the largest effect observed in BiTeI with a reduction of the Rashba parameter of $40$% when temperature increases from $0$ K to $300$ K. These results highlight the inadequacy of previous interpretations of the observed Rashba splitting in terms of static-lattice calculations alone. Notably, we find the opposite trend, a strengthening of the Rashba splitting with rising temperature, in the pressure-stabilized topological-insulator phase of BiTeI. We propose that the opposite trends with temperature on either side of the topological phase transition could be an experimental signature for identifying it. The predicted temperature dependence is consistent with optical conductivity measurements, and should also be observable using photoemission spectroscopy, which could provide further insights into the nature of spin splitting and topology in the bismuth tellurohalides.","inCitations":["1f087c89f239b981444b017943e17124018bbae1","f7b607ccf8be8e1a514e2680bf0b29adb00d9e2c"],"pdfUrls":["https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.07809v1.pdf"],"title":"Temperature dependence of the bulk Rashba splitting in the bismuth tellurohalides","doi":"10.1103/PhysRevMaterials.1.054201","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevMaterials.1.054201","venue":""}

The playable city has emerged in the past decade to critique and challenge the dominant narrative and technological determinism of smart cities. Initially, playable and smart cities operated in opposition—playable cities advocating for people and place, smart cities advocating for data and control. Following the emergence of playable cities, the diversity of approaches to smart cities has increased with some smart cities adopting approaches usually associated with playable cities that are based on people, place, community and co-creation. Revisiting the relationship between playable and smart cities reveals uneven engagement and discourse between the two as they have become enmeshed and intertwined. To explore this complexity, initial findings from a one-year study investigating the relationship between playable and smart cities are analysed, drawing upon interviews with over thirty artists, designers, producers, architects working within cities. While all of the participants in the study engage with the concept of play in some way, their creative strategies are widely divergent. Subsequently, three main themes are explored in this analysis: firstly, strategies of appropriation—of smart cities infrastructure for example—that are used by those working in playable cities; secondly, responses to issues and opportunities that have resulted from the increased datafication of cities; and thirdly, adoption of the use of conversation in the co-creation of cities and the impact that this has on public space. As a result, the changing relationship between playable and smart cities is explored.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Citizens of Play: Revisiting the Relationship Between Playable and Smart Cities","doi":"10.1007/978-981-13-9765-3_2","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-981-13-9765-3_2","venue":""}

The target populations of this study were members of fitness clubs which have multi-purpose sports facilities in Taiwan. The researcher selected twenty (N=20) sports fitness clubs based on the geographic areas; North, South, East, and West part of Taiwan. The researcher conveniently selected twenty six (N=26) individuals from twenty (N=20) sport fitness centers. The sample size included five hundred twenty (N=520) individuals, who participated in sports activity programs. The survey instruments included a demographic survey, leisure involvement scale and attitudinal loyalty. The research model describes the causal relationship among leisure involvement and behavioral loyalty. These paths are related to the causal processes. Thus, the marketing analysis approach was necessary in order to examine these variables. The data analysis was conducted using SPSS (Statistical Package for the Social Science Version 15) and AMOS 19 (Analysis of Moment Structure Version 5.01) with the software package for Windows This study found that the leisure involvement has a direct positive relationship with affective loyalty and investment loyalty. Sports relating to excitement and competitiveness showed less marking potential. These results suggested that the development of the level of consumer loyalty appears to be best explained as a progressive process. That is, the formation of high involvement in leisure activity seems to be a key precondition for becoming a committed user of a leisure service agency and supporter of that agency The finding of this study may provide the necessary feedback and contribute to improved sports facilities and instructors health club in Taiwan. Also, this study may be important because it may provide valuable information for program directors and managers of sport fitness clubs in order to comprehend significant relationships regarding leisure involvement and their attitudinal loyalty levels in relation to Taiwanese sports organizations.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"A Marketing Analysis between Leisure Involvement and Behavioral Loyalty of Fitness Club Participants in Taiwan","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

The measurements were performed by HERA-B in the negative xF range (−0.12 < xF < 0.0) and for transverse momenta up to pT = 1.6 GeV/c. Results for three target materials: carbon, titanium and tungsten are given. The ratios of production cross sections are presented and discussed. The Cronin effect is clearly observed for all three V 0 species. The atomic number dependence is parameterized as σpA = σpN · A α where σpN is the proton-nucleon cross section. The measured values of α are all near one. The results are compared with EPOS1.67 and PYTHIA6.3. EPOS reproduces the data to within ≈ 20% except at very low transverse momentum.

Parallel Distributed Genetic Algorithm (PDGA) is employed in adaptive beam forming technique to reduce power usage of adaptive antenna at WCDMA base station. Adaptive antenna has dynamic beam that requires more advanced beam forming algorithm such as genetic algorithm which requires heavy computation and memory space. Microcontrollers are low resource platforms that are normally not associated with GAs, which are typically resource intensive. The aim of this project was to design a cooperative multiprocessor system by expanding the role of small scale PIC microcontrollers to optimize WCDMA base station transmitter power. Implementation results have shown that PDGA multi-microcontroller system returned optimal transmitted power compared to conventional GA.

We perform numerical simulations of a hierarchical configuration of three compact bodies in which a binary system is perturbed by a third, lighter body initially far away from the binary. The relative importance of the different PN orders is examined. We compute the waveform in the linear regime considering mass quadrupole, current quadrupole and mass octupole contributions. Performing a spherical harmonic decomposition of the waveforms we find that from the $l=3$ modes it is possible to extract information about the third body, in particular, the period, eccentricity of its orbit, and the inclination angle between the inner and outer binary orbits.","inCitations":["324ba20707a0bdbeb0f9651c03e10503041d634e","3848577d61140c1a4b771d73120a59c272132cd8","ff1447377b76ad05874241c29a4bca8007200abd","88a30b10686f1dd866591cb2b9a328c188ced1d5"],"pdfUrls":["https://arxiv.org/pdf/1012.4423v2.pdf"],"title":"Characterization of the gravitational wave emission of three black holes","doi":"10.1103/PhysRevD.83.084013","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevD.83.084013","venue":""}

More than 200 cases have been studied critically. There is extensive literature on the subject of blood sugar curves after various sorts of carbohydrate meals. In some studies standardized meals were given, in others not. Many clinicians have assigned diagnostic importance to an increased hyperglycemia following glucose ingestion. The interpretation of the value of sugar curves depends on the following factors: (1) The technic of the administration of the glucose meal; (2) the collection of blood samples; (3) the method of doing the blood sugar determination, and (4) the wide application of the test so as to learn the many factors which influence these curves. We believe it necessary, in order to support our conclusions, to discuss the first three of these points in detail.

However, there are few references in the literature on the role of either land or water-based physical exercise on women's quality of life during pregnancy. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of a physical exercise program of water aerobics on the quality of life (QOL) of sedentary pregnant women.MethodsA comparative observational study involving sedentary low-risk pregnant women bearing a single fetus with gestational age less than 20 weeks at the time of admission to the study, who were receiving antenatal care at a public health service. One group of 35 women was given routine antenatal care, while another group of 31 women, in addition to receiving the same routine care as the first group, also participated in three classes of water aerobics per week. QOL was evaluated by applying the WHOQOL-BREF questionnaire in both groups at the 20th, 28th and 36th weeks of pregnancy. In the same occasions, women also answered another questionnaire about their experience with pregnancy and antenatal care.ResultsThe great majority of the participants considered that the practice of water aerobics had benefitted them in some way. QOL scores were found to be high in both groups during follow-up.

Drinking status data were obtained from Gender, Alcohol and Culture: An International Study, the STEPwise approach to Surveillance study, the World Health Survey/Multi-Country Study and other surveys. Consumption and drinking status data were triangulated to estimate alcohol consumption across multiple categories.\n\n\nFINDINGS\nIn 2005 adult per-capita annual consumption of alcohol was 6.1 litres, with 1.7 litres stemming from unrecorded consumption; 17.1 litres of alcohol were consumed per drinker, 45.8% of all adults were life-time abstainers, 13.6% were former drinkers and 40.6% were current drinkers. Life-time abstention was most prevalent in North Africa/Middle East and South Asia. Eastern Europe and Southern sub-Saharan Africa had the most detrimental pattern of drinking scores, while drinkers in Europe (Eastern and Central) and sub-Saharan Africa (Southern and West) consumed the most alcohol.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nJust over 40% of the world's adult population consumes alcohol and the average consumption per drinker is 17.1 litres per year. However, the prevalence of abstention, level of alcohol consumption and patterns of drinking vary widely across regions of the world.","inCitations":["18901637c76fc3e615d05bb7cfa21d302fde1c85","57ae276e65dc1de1f37ee80184aea79e0c6b5cbf","d8a5987caf2eb6eaeaf03f939722c33aef98921f","a8904da37f647ea1e208d5dbbe430220b0c3ece2","9bef5d0410511d903654b84f606f3a2c749e1c11","fb8c3138195d09e78ffb9ab71d10d18d733fa907","1de8620d3315d9c046ad171634222f1429d6e554","2dead2112fedbc2a8f1fd8966dc3ddb374a66efd","a49818dce9ba9fb2b0aa60b1705d1c9348c075e4","6fd5435296356f296277c115782e317e5aea9431","4b96dea1f0a99dbfa3de4a095ceec4832489e90f","6f49f1e660dd280d294ee23205fcb7a59b8c5505","f51457ee0bfd5eb978c2a6c0fbee551cd5b754df","7b8205627ae4d49e7eaa948fb8790790e7e5cfb6","18916e8015217c2510b8c143ac73b251e4025ce3","13ebab481516e51d52c4abacc2d45f29df3fe86f","b9d5f3acb814a8250a018441f16d35fef6113d99","89d65bfb53e615bc2a748f861233fb8102906fd2","9d4b038f6aa7ab83b600cda3287351471fb24107","a8f0d89a0236af150769300fc7ec69c0bf122d57","0d155d755aa8e8c791dcbfc65c443ea32a3456a1","ef984010ceb890990b3335e5776b5d9ca33d1910","128c1c8bf4d809d0550f6d67c4b171e7a4cdfd1d","41bfd008c8b2fc41313e17175754286f4a04d203","9f4adedca49ef436f2844497debada14f1da0b5e","7be8a63e4982407a0f0d3a4999ba9939f1be300e","a7c948322fce36db0cd1576e0f66af10e19ff8a8","6336229358e698a16ca8a212999c4f172bb2072d","0d3a14967ec8ef09bc907950912701ec90288acb","9998fe225194be56ba43ee181310011f8e9eb34e","6fe11d18920c75949ca505ad6ace82e626b21446","65270fb1de10716f1ebbcf3ac17c489ac77018f8","ed8899e07afdca60cac2931816dd566cdf7f0459","dd129d06419ec5f3a2051c1c9b41d7c3ef201d2b","0f303e5aff0a130b703ae11d3717a641cec9a866","2f5e1e86d7e90f2d798aabac1793a8e93a4e1db0","ed93fda7643ea7cced769a204709d75435f4395f","90d1efaa67970a91ff1601d502ad4721ad40ae73","74320aeaf64c3f9930ba28266db77a0b5da10809","a8c84c06130407fbfd610ad0c16112124d7330c8","622eb7cad0b98c02e90ca42903c73a83df6b487a","9a8bcfaa213982b37a68da1d2a51d0ef12fdea50","285c2a17f7ab4e829fe5e838810ac49a5a2913a4","f302c7401847e6a062e214110f159dea97541c3c","58c6dbd2df90bcece252806f0547729034a3b586","3eb9bb8b7fe3e4824a98e352f9db35e6b9a9cf49","7ee2e927dbf2da99191fe13cad4eaaa2dd8a9a11","76cd2d2ab61873d76521d59a3dfe2d0ca63a567e","5e294e14d03e595d5b94f45bd5dd1affbe52861c","c2d80b47fc0c18c422e3146dbb2d8984761a1940","422101628d1bc707ddefc8a27b45257bf999097f","77294f2e3e30dcc33ae195989d8c475c99b99033","e2f3c273c5f924e0873be3bd242ab35d3dad95a1","8d3411e966429563b6457410b929fdd5250e4cca","e98d7353d718ddb58a09588db0524cf245432c57","fd1193e36a0402ba7ba4d5d6521e28e1716e9ef6","5c791a5f9de1db59647b624e7c20a65a8dbe54d1","e3213f5d7a1bf408c095113593b51ec5b823bca6","81fe73fb088a211171de168303ad5f6991025ccb","ef7e8606e2027699c8fdbfe3a5cee4a80574c7da","f7d49ce9c08d330a28f55ede33fb19447331d6fe","ad2d94dceaa160b1768e1950385d7b2e2092d41f","25b610b0601cf33d878f7d89ee3eda02f252536a","c1c5da3460705656407d460d5b6e3b248842b8ab","f7175793f2d80decce737b76bba13c2687ee16eb","a889a38aaa23ed578fe09ce54f5cba0e2dc5c22a","1308d18bcc44b116ba5343527c55f94852620c74","4bf5391beb7753b4e8b3c641c108c5c7be6c122d","c1ee5ce27242c02ab1f15e9a245d5f485ee54922","e503fa18e8c66652e22405ac0e93979443feadde","651fd1b9049b9024fe044f15db72dd57ec92e27d","3ca712dfec4ada456740888e0fafad5d8043da39","faaa9b91f7e5507663a2bf91dfc64d95bd6de8b3","2424dca06e3b1f31870afd486aa49a0c5bce0aba","186541a3c0f5eaa263062fdb75e32a27f11384e0","aef31736727c8a417d80e6f373fb6c633ec05460","06ae38369009d73368c9c911d3ed412f5a8c1e4f","354bebe9237ad816828af0394908b813f660c691","a89baaeaf3a23964927da0a3efe794a65b3383ab","4e80162dd63382356bbdf2c970702f20b6eec595","dab81b9db02cb755df5e5176f432b6ede9def976","0fcf07af9d661887ebb236a06d003d1bbb97c033","00b30e647564cbd3665002cf25828ad4fbd88db1","10ccb59f41ee6a26950591caed03655d66949949","beda74fe5542898a5a10ce231ff064b7e2ab770a","b448b034cba9011879b926dd06b37c65ec2a11f6","78ce1ffd54e96447bb2a5c81ede00743b9006676","cb401c3eb5e93cd569cf8dcee1f37cc79fe1ead2","6aad65c9a082cc2390d70e606635087b3da53277","66ae615d2a5b2afbf32e5cbefad50251cc0976da","cc93c95d3c116c6ca71cc34a586931d8997cef37","b2c1af22b768f45ebe953b8ca38100cab934ada3","424d045939e5b0b4d0b099a9722baf22a7ca4972","3f11e8313816690ec05cbbf8193821a4c2c21cf5"],"pdfUrls":["https://www.safetylit.org/citations/ild_request_form.php?article_id=citjournalarticle_389545_1"],"title":"Global alcohol exposure estimates by country, territory and region for 2005--a contribution to the Comparative Risk Assessment for the 2010 Global Burden of Disease Study.","doi":"10.1111/add.12112","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1111/add.12112","venue":"Addiction"}
