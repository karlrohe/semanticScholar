Analisa o percurso e desenvolvimento das politicas de avaliacao e suas manifestacoes recentes nos governos FHC e Lula. Para tanto, utiliza referenciais de accountability horizontal e vertical recorrendo a um desenho de instrumentos de coleta de dados em duas turmas de dez professores. Faz o resgate historico da avaliacao externa no contexto do Brasil e no mundo com o objetivo de situar a discussao da politica de avaliacao em vigor. Alem disso, aborda as logicas que estao presentes na avaliacao externa no contexto da escola e mais especificamente aborda a percepcao dos professores sobre o tema. Para a investigacao, utiliza o Grupo Focal para indagar sobre os efeitos da avaliacao externa junto a professores participantes de Curso de Extensao na UnB. Os resultados apontam que tanto as fases de elaboracao e quanto de divulgacao da avaliacao externa permanecem obscuras para a sua populacao alvo, o que incide decisivamente na percepcao, compreensao e apropriacao desta politica e seus dispositivos. Desta maneira, e possivel afirmar que as distorcoes observadas na implementacao, aplicacao e discussao da avaliacao externa no contexto escolar podem ser atribuidas a estes elementos causais \nAbstract","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Accountability de professores : um estudo sobre o efeito da Prova Brasil em escolas de Brasilia","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Presented data shows distinct changes in distribution pattern of both T cell populations after partial gastrectomy. There was significant decrease in percentage of ab T cells in mesenteric lymph nodes, Peyer’s patches and peripheral blood on the third day after partial gastrectomy. At the same time there were no significant changes in distribution of ab T cells in peripheral lymph nodes and in the spleen. In contrast the percentage of gd T cells in mesenteric lymph nodes, Peyer’s patches and peripheral lymph nodes was significantly increased on day 3. Simultaneously the percentage of gd T cells in peripheral blood was decreased, whereas no changes were observed in the spleen. The gastrectomy-induced changes in distribution of both T cells populations were most pronounced at day 3 after the surgery, whereas they disappeared almost completely on day 7. Laparotomy alone (sham operation) had no or a little effect on T cell numbers in all tested lymph organs. Hence the severity of the trauma may be of great importance. The data obtained from in vitro experiments showed suppressor activity of gd T lymphocytes isolated from MLN of gastrectomized mice. The gastrectomy-induced regulatory gd T cells suppressed proliferation of T effector lymphocytes in vitro via released TGF-b. The regulatory T cells were not induced in mesenteric lymph nodes of sham-operated mice.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"The influence of surgical operation on [gamma delta] and [alfa beta] T cell distribution in the mouse","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Telomeres also repress the expression of genes in their vicinity, a phenomenon known as telomere position effect. In an attempt to construct a conditional telomere, an inducible promoter was introduced adjacent to a single telomere of a chromosome such that transcription could be induced toward the end of the chromosome. Transcription toward two other essential chromosomal elements, centromeres and origins of replication, eliminates their function. In contrast, transcription toward a telomere did not affect the stability function of the telomere as measured by the loss rate of the transcribed chromosome. Transcription proceeded through the entire length of the telomeric tract and caused a modest reduction in the average length of the transcribed telomere. Transcription of the telomere substantially reduced the frequency of cells in which an adjacent URA3 gene was subject to telomere position effect. These results indicate that telomere position effect can be alleviated without compromising chromosome stability.","inCitations":["40513a11df8940200d3e468e9a3d19c4768b7832","1c782ef3dac79d447d7098507f22c5fc65cbe2ef","19441477098d539f9cbd45b52f50870ed194a202","75ffc79829346521f5ca9384330a7c2b3ef37580","9637b8d06496b8098898bb708e051606e2165c69","c4938a7b06e69cb9babcda67fae1df97367e4954","9f94e386c25cffcd23a29bab907dffc02d791da6","5b46183e671be5170bdb522c9e9105d9911a454f","df2d28edd65bd969f37da367ae791c308ce366eb","3d2f3febd17815d4864df423afc33e200ff73277","5444b15bf727ac4a9b1004cd015d2681e5103b70","6497de77adbcbcce6ede007e0a96d75bbc2cb74a","75e1a983b897db2e979fedc7e392db56c8a6b170","e17875a0ac1ee9e07f6977d18b296597ef8b54d8","c8561bb5e9565a3d5440bdd1aed8188995f44559","a54c3ce95d5e2d416c4146e2408fcdd49868f80b","418127462f64667fe72f84c499064d778fc8112d","95b218ea68ac26cb93d7e4f79950613d5230014b","780ae563e699b336b70b142234ec5e4060e1e5cf","4017ae1290272c5744849ccafc44a5a60d709bb2","53562c54289c55e091349d52ca1e3cdb96ba9d68","a7beff34e319d0dcec06c695e7b2a389c7fa2405","f1ed9cad669acd59d0d1b25fb1614f14dd6833a3","9a3825eeb049f2b51125363a6222d60d12a210a0","8e5c7c05c9ebd2b831fa36c0c8a8c328b53ba52f","281e6e6f5b8281d5ff4c635e3917657a2855c0eb","fd9eea1ba3d4d75a21bd6a36371188708fa86994","989557aed1541783d97092a8f7ec1ba6be24fc30","fe72c5a1dc9b7c6028d0b30cb79ace41d6c5a732","43e24573d992b53c4b45457f926aaa4b91324385","a1968884e5c1b6e08e8cf15107d1c87863fc9527","25e103b86e1d837f68b0d051467aa83a0bf01dc8","fdd6094198979568239e5ace96da1ca57b8d0438","00baa7df20674c62dbece48e386c4ab78aa84c2a","e59c826384b53760abe85c3e9bdba954f3280a1d","3bc1e7e5e412aaea5cccf6893d1ffa50e057dc66","708c001ab1b4864b04364e888ada4ef5dc34cd82","b501fe0f2b36c16ab75cb9756817af9d41a6cc80","d90b36ca82bb008d133cb9de78b2abce036fbcab","fe85a742b274767b1052874517b3f4ee4ae86c78","d1b08600431685d2f6c6a1a8f6ce190657ec145c","bc1ea4b2f45b7f958eec90f38b0ce4fd0d99b510","4ad5553d52631b790919017785b25358b6fefd91","b33274b0fccfc5b5695355dfa188099c773aa90c","c2c0a20beaae7532cbea9a1169394a1756bbc50b","35bc0177a8a372a4a200ec555bc5d9f434139b09","33f246a468059dd4c9aeaf79f68294be2959c4a8","034f193d7b64583e6ac7eca936bacb53156a16f6"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Transcription of a yeast telomere alleviates telomere position effect without affecting chromosome stability.","doi":"10.1073/pnas.91.25.12061","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.91.25.12061","venue":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America"}

It is often used against non-combatant targets[1]. Terror tactics may include biologic, chemical, nuclear, or explosive events. Biologic Bioterrorism is the intentional release of biological agents to cause illness or death in humans, animals, or plants. These agents may be bacteria, fungi, toxins, or viruses. They may be naturally occurring or human-modified. The agents are typically found in nature, but they may be altered in a laboratory to increase their resistance to antibiotics, and ability to spread in the environment. Biological and chemical agents may be spread through the air, food, or water. Terrorists use biological agents because they are often difficult to detect and illness onset may be delayed for hours to days increasing dispersal. Bioterrorism agents are a common choice for terrorists because they easy and inexpensive to produce, easy to disseminate, and can cause widespread effects. The challenge with bioweapons is that they may affect both enemy and friendly forces. Terrorists use biologic weapons as a method of creating mass panic. In the history of humanity, the intentional infliction of casualties on civilians was considered inappropriate. Civilians are usually not attacked for their own sake unless they happen to be living or working in an area that has tactical or strategic value. Unfortunately, bioterrorism agents are difficult to control and affect military personnel as well as civilian men, woman, and children. In the last 100 years, the United States and the international community have experienced multiple acts of terrorism and bioterrorism which have targeted civilians. World War I: Germany launched a biological sabotage campaign in France, Romania, Russia, and the United States by infecting horses and mules with glanders, a virulent disease. 1972: Two college students, Allen Schwander and Stephen Pera, were arrested for planning to poison the Chicago water supply with typhoid bacteria. 1984: The Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh followers in Oregon attempted to affect a local election by infecting doorknobs and salad bars in restaurants with Salmonella typhimurium bacteria. 1993: Aum Shinrikyo religious group released anthrax in Tokyo. 1995: Bombing of the Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City. 2001: Airline attack on the World Trade Center. 2001: Anthrax-laced of infectious anthrax were delivered to news media offices and the US Congress. 2009: Medical center attack at a Fort Hood, Texas. 2014: Bombing of the Boston Marathon. Present: Multiple bombings worldwide. Chemical During World War I there was widespread use of chemical weapons that often affected the civilian population resulting in many deaths. Since this war, most countries have agreed not to use chemical and biologic weapons. Unfortunately, with our present age of terrorism from individuals, splinter groups, and dictators, there is an ever-present risk that these agents will be used. Nuclear To date, other than the dropping of nuclear bombs by the United States to end World War II, there have been no recent acts of nuclear attack or nuclear terrorism. Nuclear terrorism is an act of terrorism in which a terrorist organization detonates a nuclear device. The possibility of terrorist organizations using nuclear is considered plausible as terrorists could acquire a nuclear weapon. However, despite thefts of small amounts of fissile material, all low-concern, there is no credible evidence any terrorist group has succeeded in obtaining the necessary multi-kilogram critical mass amounts of weapons-grade plutonium required to make a nuclear weapon. Explosive It is, unfortunately, becoming a common event on an international scale when terrorists use explosive devices to inflict casualties on the civilian population. Terrorism Definitions What is terrorism? What is a mass casualty incident? The United Nations definition of terrorism describes it as \"an anxiety-inspiring method of repeated violent action, employed by (semi-) clandestine individual, group, or state actors, for idiosyncratic, criminal, or political reasons, whereby-in contrast to assassination-the direct targets of violence are not the main targets.\" The Department of Defense defines terrorism as \"the unlawful use of violence or threat of violence, often motivated by religious, political, or other ideological beliefs, to instill fear and coerce governments or societies in pursuit of goals that are usually political.\" The Federal Emergency Management Agency defines terrorism as \"the use of force or violence against persons or property in violation of the criminal laws of the United States for purposes of intimidation, coercion, or ransom. Terrorists often use threats to create fear among the public, to try to convince citizens that their government is powerless to prevent terrorism, and to get immediate publicity for their cause\". The US Code of Federal Regulations defines terrorism as \"the unlawful use of force and violence against persons or property to intimidate or coerce a government, the civilian population, or any segment thereof, in furtherance of political or social objectives.\" A mass casualty incident is defined terrorist act that generates more patients than available resources can manage using routine procedures. Terrorism is generally considered to be the use of force or violence outside the law to create fear among citizens with the intent to coerce some sort of action. Health professionals should be aware bioterrorism is a perfect vehicle for terrorists to strike fear into the hearts and minds of citizens in the hopes they will bend the will of the people to support their agendas. All health professionals need to be prepared for this potentially catastrophic event[2].","inCitations":["d47e17e12440a35ee3434e7b0d28e3ce5dbe0111","dd7e4febe6dc3ce75e5ef9a92c2ba1b41b62c1d1"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Biologic, Chemical, and Radiation Terrorism Review","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

To determine whether these effects are mediated by separate PGE2 receptors, we compared the effects of PGE2 and its analogue sulprostone in the isolated perfused rabbit CCD. PGE2 increased basal water permeability (hydraulic conductivity), whereas sulprostone did not. PGE2 and sulprostone were equipotent inhibitors of water absorption when it was prestimulated by vasopressin. Pertussis toxin completely reversed the inhibitory effect of sulprostone but only partially reversed the inhibitory effect of PGE2. In contrast, a protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor, staurosporine, partially reversed the inhibitory effect of PGE2 but had no effect on sulprostone. PGE2 also raised intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i). This effect is coupled to its capacity to inhibit Na+ absorption. Sulprostone was 10-fold less potent than PGE2 both in raising [Ca2+]i or inhibiting sodium transport. The results suggest sulprostone selectively interacts with a PGE2 receptor coupled to pertussis toxin-sensitive inhibition of water permeability. Sulprostone less potently activates a PGE2 receptor coupled to [Ca2+]i, PKC activation, and sodium transport and completely fails to interact with the PGE2 receptor that stimulates water permeability in the collecting duct. These results suggest distinct PGE2 receptors modulate sodium and water transport in the CCD.","inCitations":["9e4691aead9dbdf481b54a9259738191efe625b0","1006b570872c7daabbebf9d97a18f2f4b932be77","56462878c3dcfdb7f11edae31d5c84ace58ab6c9","83d319bce8909208ca6c49f80fe27966cb6f7050","509f4b39c37b27decdc540aeb8a43da0b0143255","db0b63d1f087fd548245194bf5b653dfaaed06bb","0a887687926c9a0bbb8fa85d6d389716aa8b2b69","d301f462df4ec4980e5e2c9de84f0f771089a580","87dd469113c2ecc82cffbddc244c6f5f52b4c4ec","4cf692ea5a7e9771daac38a671a94a9f57d87724","50af4470e8bb725e82ebbcfef2c001f92d384cc7","219f0fb7df6e78f20cd8cf58a9b96956fec16efc","8221ad66f81241c034007ee0a73ec7f7b0378b9f","5b88297be9c02d7f32f949d56ded40e6c4a64d2b","f7425264bd8dcd018bbf0a10375aa0a3a57429f6","db964c3411ea9b71beace8a86c59a6830c9672f4","6d227675c1fb9e20caecf8857597148fa25f167a","455d735112078dd9786e9e6191341f683eb77265","40ac0bd2ca111e07c5f21aec0bd56507126fb537","1fab78190ba59234a3571e626d864fe76dd04d4e","e1248d5a77d8b0d2d33bd0d44b828123ac399169","275e19d2f2570cb43e1c54d05f9c9fc351e2d094","0467492c424ba836867823a540e95448e279a747","8d44a644b1c25a13336f35f692c52e501fb73bc1","383c46b6a302798abd81ac57341c74ccf83af93b","4d42f04d03416640662fd684f4e8e5d91c89f5db","282bfacad3a7b7615959e5216a0d2452ebc0d120","aab10ef21b4c1e16c0ebf84615c9a6bd2531d5c7","5a613f0d5ba4c9495001824b288a454e8163129b","dbba3c2b7e6c58e6b1695551698bdd5ee608068e","fe6e668762f64c6b30fb2d005a898741c3df3521","e8230b7d3d7c6926cf3b072c246f23375ed962c1","1d6a1e925c0ebc6a435bf01921b49fa0a9544d24","11207b0ad308a0c37fcb7815195778de9805f4db","26395803e16a73dc3788a04280b11c5020f7dd64","c7898f80fa7008b7badf1de47e759515e2f30659","7995deba6e1a983295948448b36574e5e6d5148a","c8f74f2cfa860e302a56b1527c9a6050254045df","36ce4a1dc31186f5e82d54f2a9279f4100cf2df1","1af15eb57e99972ad27525ced41346ac89ec7826","8a93edc98928867e008d077a00126c9269936ca2","417badf5f322d56ae18a73e5ebc17b753d6dfb5d","5187e06a29f168c6e08a6a630994d47ca89b56b9","4159e4bfd24618806bca98200b1ece6d7bfa0d92","de1add7ab8e487b1ca2a7d558d25da22ac362127","6747d2e544c166cd7cd1bfa86d778c1429e3cdac","9a4fb7ed11c55a308c7dffa8eb559ee36837d82b","3fc0d8178588168e1da816fe8ca07731a0e88a6a","e0ccec05066af9e7fc729e3db6ba95d57121f87f","4ceb07fc42ac8965417f2408ca8b4c5c8ca060cb","fb025dd5d124fffd4eb21fa1d00105036d9c5a9c","30511582da0fee248dfafa4b6383e3eea3b3dab4","df9ff0de82fbd565fba9118c372196189e726ec5","e9bf4bb9b0e92feac7da5b99a5f087907afe691b","0215b087e4db0bcca91bb986aa3b1239e39326ed","5548d50fde502095928ee2b17c7e7753d488e19a","c77d1998d18b3286c14f70ed2bb951a5c7daf65a","17a03bfd71623682e02f173bc0014779e10e7302","bfbc04373b4b3c1c5c431ee8b40f49136ffad905","b337dd8adbfe466dd9553d923137e69b311a8589","f48f4f8416b198bcd2f1d0ef4b1e121b9849c5fe","9888125ffc23dab446f2ad0a29b02835f5794a5a","df93b1d83add2b47beaa8bc48bb7b202832605eb","6c8991c91836f5f5df7c1aac0225f51f5ef415ab","b8bc534d9e429d381510ceae82662efcc97fdd47","0506c58cfd83e08f9e3665485c6e7bb1369d190f","6c035bf06605d7378e33ee8695332ebc40081ca0","4581bca93035dc813f00e73f62c304759d14e3cf","6e62763df84c72d409c387b6446884d66034c63c","d87b042d829f57d079e89216870a62d4a105ee97","8a6a9885f6f4f9e96378b3b37362ea498a0204e5"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Evidence that separate PGE2 receptors modulate water and sodium transport in rabbit cortical collecting duct.","doi":"10.1152/ajprenal.1993.265.5.F643","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1152/ajprenal.1993.265.5.F643","venue":"The American journal of physiology"}

Whereas Aquinas explicitly argues in favour of an analogical use and against an equivocal use, Maimonides on the contrary argues against an analogical use and in favour of an equivocal use of terms when applied to God. Although their respective concepts of analogical meaning appear to differ, I argue on the basis of an analysis of the criteria for analogical predication implicit in each that a thomistic concept of analogical predication is reducible to a maimonidean concept. Thus, it follows that the explicit critique Maimonides lodges against an analogical use of terms when applied to God, if defensible, can be shown to be successful against Aquinas' proposal for analogical language of God. On this basis I conclude that there is a significant and defensible philosophical difference between Aquinas and Maimonides on language about God.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"A Maimonidean Critique of Thomistic Analogy","doi":"10.1353/hph.2003.0051","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1353/hph.2003.0051","venue":""}

Numerous efforts have been done in different network layers to improve system performance based on real-time traffic transmission. The main contribution of this paper is to introduce a downlink packet scheduler for IEEE 802.16 standard MAC layer that improves the QoS of real-time traffic while not deteriorating the performance of non-real-time data. This scheduler categorizes the packets into three priority levels. Unlike the existing priority- based schedulers, in this model a budget calculation process is provisioned to prevent the low priority data from starving. The scheduler has been developed in a simulated IEEE 802.16 network scenario in NS3, hosting mixed types of traffic. Extensive simulation experiments show that the proposed scheduling model prevents bandwidth misuse which significantly improves the QoS parameters of real-time traffic comparing to a conventional packet scheduler.The scheme and conclusions are readily extendable to other 4G standards using the described mapping mechanism.","inCitations":["ab80c6a7115293238ddaa4f2db0f7efeb2e71410","b88ad15e4cebc068fb83bff123de32bc34eb76b3","0e627c77d3f661c038bc9bb04fbaf98f0b727b03"],"pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7145687"],"title":"An IEEE 802.16 MAC Layer Downlink Scheduler Implemented in NS3 to Improve the Performance of Real-Time and Non-Real-Time Traffic Transmission","doi":"10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7145687","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7145687","venue":"2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)"}

Palladium-catalyzed coupling of 1-tributylstannyl-4-thiofuranoid glycal with iodobenzene or a heteroaryl halide gave 1-C-phenyl- or 1-C-heteroaryl-glycals. Hydroboration of these glycals proceeded at the α-face, and subsequent alkaline hydrogen peroxide treatment of the resulting 2'-α-borane furnished the respective β-anomer of 4'-thio-C-ribonucleosides. These results demonstrate that this synthetic method has a wider scope in terms of heterocyclic base structure. During this study, unexpected Markovnikov-oriented hydroboration has been observed to lead to the respective 1'-α-boranes. These 1'-boranes were converted into either the ring-opened structure or the 2'-deoxy derivatives depending upon their stability.","inCitations":["2fd24749181f97dea53c8287f419e139b9acdf86","1c8a238144949946274cd55a9f8fb7ae41a35018"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"An access to the β-anomer of 4'-thio-C-ribonucleosides: hydroboration of 1-C-aryl- or 1-C-heteroaryl-4-thiofuranoid glycals and its regiochemical outcome.","doi":"10.1021/jo201100n","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1021/jo201100n","venue":"The Journal of organic chemistry"}

Nadine Gordimer's novels have often been analyzed as historical artifacts that give insight on South African historical situations, and the players in the drama. This paper suggests that a narratological study of point of view and the examination of diverse perspectives in the different novels sheds light on an understanding of the conflicts enacted in her fiction. The flexibility in her manipulation of point of view is observed in particular in four novels: A Guest of Honour (1971), The Conservationist (1974), Burger's Daughter (1979), and My Son's Story (1991). Her novels thus pose in acute form the question of whose story will be told and who will tell it. The multiplicity of voices and the corresponding shifts in focalization evident in her novels provide ways to explore the nature of both the creative act and the connection between the personal and the political.","inCitations":["b90e7679971708bc5a55f8c1d628c4021d172457"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Revising south african history: multiple perspectives in the novels of nadine gordimer","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

This article covers the carbon nanomaterials, presenting important aspects such as main properties, synthesis methods, and the application of these materials in the development of electrochemical sensors for the analysis of drugs and compounds of clinical interest. In this context, drug analysis is extremely important for quality control, to ensure that the medicine fulfills its role effectively without possible complications that could compromise the patient’s health and quality of life. In addition, analytical methods capable of determining compounds of clinical interest in biological fluids are extremely important for the indication of effective diagnoses. Thus, the versatility, selectivity, and portability of the electroanalytical techniques make the electrochemical sensors a favorite tool for the determination of drugs and compounds of clinical interest. It will be possible to follow in the present work that carbon nanomaterials have excellent thermal and electrical conductivity, strong adsorption capacity, high electrocatalytic effect, high biocompatibility, and high surface area. The possibility of formation of different composite materials based on carbonaceous nanomaterials that makes these materials promising for the development of analytical sensors, contributing to rapid, sensitive, and low-cost analyses can also be highlighted.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Carbon nanomaterials: synthesis and applications to development of electrochemical sensors in determination of drugs and compounds of clinical interest","doi":"10.1515/revac-2019-0017","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1515/revac-2019-0017","venue":""}

Further, we suggest the general hyperexponential interarrival distribution as a model suitable for network traffic and evaluate the ability of the third-order hyperexponential model to capture IDV, PRV and queuing characteristics. Although the hyperexponential interarrival distribution holds promise for network traffic modeling, in part due to its analytical tractability, we conclude that hyperexponential models with order larger than 3 will be required to model the burstiness of real network traffic adequately.","inCitations":["b9547ef0701eadded23f7e8442c5393e451ee84e","673fce1a2f1cfe079b6ee6d2bdccd2a61f895275","3f2f5884716d9b0dad7668b76f09a1deb02474d4"],"pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2002.997275","http://www.ittc-ku.net/publications/documents/Pothuri2002_IEEE-paper.pdf","http://ittc.ku.edu/publications/documents/Pothuri2002_IEEE-paper.pdf","http://profusion.ittc.ku.edu/publications/documents/Pothuri2002_IEEE-paper.pdf","http://www.rsl.ku.edu/publications/documents/Pothuri2002_IEEE-paper.pdf","http://www.ittc.ku.edu/publications/documents/Pothuri2002_IEEE-paper.pdf"],"title":"Characterizing and modeling network traffic variability","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2002.997275","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2002.997275","venue":"2002 IEEE International Conference on Communications.

The reaction rate depends on the electron donor capabilities of the aldehydes. Electron poor aldehydes undergo faster reactions than electron rich aldehydes, but both electron rich and bulky aldehydes can be transformed to corresponding olefins in very good yields and high E -selectivity.","inCitations":["d7b89a8e84bf18697f7186b911b7c7c77468e684"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Ruthenium(II)–salen complexes-catalyzed olefination of aldehydes with ethyl diazoacetate","doi":"10.1016/j.tetlet.2006.01.055","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tetlet.2006.01.055","venue":""}

Housing floor area is an ambiguous concept in Hong Kong because it covers a possible exaggeration of the amount of ‘private space’ exclusively enjoyed by the owner and an unidentifiable portion of ‘public space’ shared with other owners within the development. Using hedonic pricing models, this study has found that different distributions between private and shared space command different values from the housing buyers. Shared communal space generally exerts a downward pressure on housing prices. The buyers are willing to pay more for the private space and some desirable forms of communal space. A higher willingness-to-pay for the desirable attributes such as clubhouse indicates that the Hong Kong people are increasingly concerned about the quality of living space in the built environment. This study suggests a need of further research into the exact measurement and the different forms of housing space rather than simply taking the stated floor space figures for granted.\n \n","inCitations":["c6a3243867d0045a4239ea8b5e9c31d7b67276ab","fe3d1885f34a65832f90970525cc46246899b5a9","0c18efd038ea2279baf1a9281c4b25448ecd5c83","33509043102139028caa3453d5c1905a5e6cd3d8","19deba32b609ada21fa3c9f2b707682d1e25d667","c208ea753a1c92d2a266cf171af3f026a32ed64b","2713a862b217e6b829d777e6cebfc13b79c28cd3","06ca25121eb89d8f4bb646bfbfaee4e41c525aac","ff377bd7c5df372139d2e1a5851cc539fa2a1f1e"],"pdfUrls":["https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0197397507000690","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0197397507000690"],"title":"Private space, shared space and private housing prices in Hong Kong: An exploratory study","doi":"10.1016/j.habitatint.2007.11.004","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.habitatint.2007.11.004","venue":"Habitat International"}

We sought to determine if there is a gene–environment interaction between GSTM1 (GSTM1A and GSTM1B), and GSTT1 genotypes and cigarette smoking in the risk of breast cancer. Methods: Cases and controls were recruited in a case–control study conducted in Connecticut from 1994 to 1998. Cases were histologically confirmed, incident breast cancer patients, and controls were randomly selected from women histologically confirmed to be without breast cancer. A total of 338 cases and 345 controls were genotyped for GSTM1 and GSTT1. Results: None of the GSTM1 genotypes, either alone or in combination with cigarette smoking, was associated with breast cancer risk. There was, however, a significantly increased risk of breast cancer among postmenopausal women with a GSTT1 null genotype (OR = 1.9, 95% CI 1.2–2.9). There were also indications of increased risk of breast cancer associated with cigarette smoking for postmenopausal women with GSTT1-null genotype, especially for those who commenced smoking before age 18 (OR = 2.9, 95% CI 1.0–8.8). Conclusion: Women with a GSTT1-null genotype may have an increased breast cancer risk, especially postmenopausal women who started smoking at younger ages.","inCitations":["3bd6ee3cb167288c41ceb7bf7dc0ff5848ef4fff","0095340684bd578d75ff669dad2130e3959f6812","4f886c351b2891d39195e57f50c4c8bcfdc086d1","a8186a32fc6d70ae0cd56181ea084dc1dba26547","dcfc208eaa2be3c00087a9abb64fe6b95affa05b","a503d2caecd4e1b78bf3c8eda4d6d31673d53031","f00bccbb81520cb90a49bc8aedb3b12e168944e0","08b5729217acece5f303845a04be47c6d4bb6d1b","ddc2bce180f337c098fa0d0cb48ee451c5f7d7e6","955d08a393d9fdf8c8e4efaff72734ac602ca03f","5f6ddcd6b6cf93fb6ac894ff64e64b45508c98b3","561d1dc3b6208deec5c7a31a69dfe499d2977554","420b061061d43c01339a63850fbd359c602f8478","70b24dd5f22631beb693fc32dac97a5f78845648","168a61c66818f9a83a3ed7a699496d330f488e62","de32c6218d601ad1f584dc54c43b11fc4d679cb7","bc53ffd05aa9729973d07f103843478965a4761d","502a86d8bcd7208be6f539fcceba631f82f25a7d","aac4c515de429de4aa344e121856ec43bebbb3ff","298513c68964982ddb954d6ef22de48ca45b6374","23912e4658650509a6eff4117c751b5a8a530155","d34c35b92beb7eb25866bfeeac8e6028a3a622d6","3548d1bccc064d0f3787c1c046ca642517490888","38abfb013a2a1154d63f09714322bf272d542c71","a14a5aeb50cdc438bfe009e76f3a5f42f7c3196e","dae6574bb46ea7fa8b630d4e6316c5a24a998946","1b5699c178798f662073bcd4a73b5d60a35dc68d"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Cigarette smoking, glutathione-S-transferase M1 and T1 genetic polymorphisms, and breast cancer risk (United States)","doi":"10.1023/A:1019500109267","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1023/A%3A1019500109267","venue":"Cancer Causes & Control"}

Comparison has also been made with nanocrystalline Ti:Ru:Fe (2:1:1) and a mixture of Ti:TiO:Ru:Fe 2 O 3 (3/2:1/2:1:1/2). It was shown by cyclic voltammetry, open circuit potential decay and chronopotentiometry measurements that hydrogen absorption in the electrode material occurs during hydrogen discharge. The electrochemical behavior of nanocrystalline Ti:Ru:Fe:O (2:1:1:2) closely follows that of Ti:Ru:Fe (2:1:1), but differs radically from that of Ti:TiO:Ru:Fe 2 O 3 (3/2:1/2:1:1/2). This is due to the fact that the former two compounds contain a significant fraction of B2 phase (59 and 97 wt.%, respectively), while the latter does not. In steady state conditions, the ratio H/B2 phase in nanocrystalline Ti:Ru:Fe:O (2:1:1:2) is 0.15, about 1.6 times less than that for the O-free nanocrystalline compound. The coefficient of diffusion of hydrogen in nanocrystalline Ti:Ru:Fe:O (2:1:1:2) is 2.6×10 −13 cm 2 s −1 , more than three times less than that in nanocrystalline Ti:Ru:Fe (2:1:1). The difference between the hydrogen absorption characteristics of both nanocrystalline compounds are tracked down to the fact that their B2 phases have different stoichiometries.","inCitations":["fb576d6acd50c1ce526b673d87909b8a472b3c1e"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Hydrogen electrosorption in nanocrystalline Ti-based alloys","doi":"10.1016/S0022-0728(99)00446-5","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/S0022-0728%2899%2900446-5","venue":""}

(L.) Heynh. Treatment of wild-type seedlings with continuous low-fluence-rate light (< 1.0 μmol photons · m−2 · s−1) induced some inhibition of hypocotyl elongation at all wavelengths tested, with maximum inhibition in blue light. At higher fluence rates, inhibition reached a maximum of 70–80% in UV-A, blue, and far-red light. Fluence rate-response curves for seedlings of blu1, a blue light-response mutant, showed a specific reduction in their response to blue light, but their response to UV-A, red, and far-red light was similar to that in wild-type seedlings. In contrast, the phytochromedeficient mutant hy6 showed a loss of response to lowfluence-rate light at all wavelengths, as well as to highfluence-rate far-red light. However, hy6 seedlings retained sensitivity to high-fluence-rate blue and UV-A light. The data support the conclusion that blue-lightand phytochrome-dependent photosensory systems regulate hypocotyl elongation independently and in an additive manner. Furthermore, hypocotyl inhibition in wild-type, blul, hy6 and blul-hy6 double mutants was indistinguishable in UV-A light, whereas marked differences were observed at other wavelengths, indicating the involvement of a third photosensory system with an absorption maximum in the UV-A.","inCitations":["10d559136c14ca1fcc3e2fc1a05b277b4e4bfa7e","55cf7055788445bfd45b9c3b8469cb11e1dca254","5a92d3902e3ec7753644c515f99c90919bcb670e","7a81fb9cd5287963de6e3b2c63c9a30ee0e68062","577d4026ddd211002a10309da9499d99153fc29e","c78c9e15c81c6fb71ef14b1f701334ce776576da","c857de6e8fcd08ae308666937955b5999ee20975","ce42396afcbd54a8474e785374225df28295769e","5f456dcad3eedf6afc8f7d74c91866d4606de15e","1b766365b6d65947048f7cb1d60b9f5d0f59c65f","6496af3d3781e23052c1fdb741e17716a9a6a9ce","73a56ae7b528803569b882bcc12349a7e1c7f4fc","f51ab9653a9af1180fd78c0ea5f155151d6bd3dd","8afb8e5d48993c07558eb97deb5cb8fe658f2f91","db68214d5719280f337922bfcf8d4b2c252d06a5","add73904c7a99e09f49385b4b6a625860e5ec314","c41c6bf58d912706dc1c177a2debfca29db19826","b61d9ff3a0200e5a1bca994295fd6a2bc5e03807"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Spectral-dependence of light-inhibited hypocotyl elongation in photomorphogenic mutants of Arabidopsis: evidence for a UV-A photosensor","doi":"10.1007/BF00198946","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/BF00198946","venue":"Planta"}

The process involves oxidation of the waste gases followed by tritium oxide absorption onto the molecular sieve within the tritium waste containers. The tritium sorbed in the waste containers must be measured to ensure that the quantity of tritium sorbed is accurately known and is in keeping with the licenced capacity of the containers prior to their shipment of site. A DTO Waste Compliance Monitoring System has been designed and fabricated for on-line monitoring of the tritium sorbed in the molecular sieve tritium waste containers. The monitoring system is based on the in-line process tritium monitor qualified for HTO monitoring. The compliance monitoring system involves the use of three in-line tritium monitoring systems which are positioned prior to, between, and after the two tritium waste containers. The first tritium waste container absorbs the bulk of the tritium while the second waste container scavenges the breakthrough. The in-line tritium monitor system consists of a constricted main flow passage and a slip stream bypass, the latter containing an in-line process tritium monitor, a flow monitor, a thermocouple, and a humidification port. The flow rate through the main passage is typically 24 LPS while the flow rate through the bypass is about 15 NLPM. The in-line tritium monitor is out-fitted with a Keithley electrometer the output of which is connected to a data acquisition and control system. Time integration of the product of the total flow rate and difference in the upstream and downstream tritium concentrations along with appropriate background and temperature corrections results in the quantity of tritium sorbed on a tritium waste container.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"DTO Waste Compliance Monitoring System at TFTR","doi":"10.1109/FUSION.1995.534300","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FUSION.1995.534300","venue":"Proceedings of 16th International Symposium on Fusion Engineering"}

Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is used to optimize the design parameters of external manifold in the stack. The model consists of equations for the network with chamber structure of manifold. Simulation results indicate that the flow uniformity strongly depends on geometric shapes of manifold, including the joined position between tube and manifold, the dimension of manifold and the number of tubes. The ratio of flow velocity which describes the uniformity of flow distribution can be decreased by optimizing the geometrical structure of manifolds. In addition, it is found that the flow distribution can be intensively influenced by the gas resistance of the stack, which is closely related to the configuration of interconnect channels. The results summarize the importance of structure design of external manifold for stack performance. The numerical results are in good agreement with the experimental measurement in a 40-cell stack.","inCitations":["e5ee2e0aee498f38a7813d4fb3e3e85bd6811ce7","df6d099fd2e1a82d33433aeebd99b86cb2b045e8"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Numerical simulation of flow distribution for external manifold design in solid oxide fuel cell stack","doi":"10.1016/j.ijhydene.2016.12.009","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijhydene.2016.12.009","venue":""}

In order to capture all pathways of NO formation accurately the use of detailed chemistry in CFD is mandatory. Solving a transport equation for all species of a detailed reaction mechanism however is too costly for engineering purposes. Therefore an approach is discussed in the present paper which is based on the solution of a transport equation for NO where the chemical source term is retrieved as a function of reaction progress and mixture fraction from look-up tables. These look-up tables are computed by simulating an ensemble of laminar premixed flames at dierent mixture fractions using detailed chemistry. In order to define reaction progress for a given mixture fraction, the length of the H2O-NO-trajectory is used. A transport equation for the reaction progress is then derived. This tabulation concept is validated by computing dierent laminar, counterflow, hydrogen-air diusion flames with a finite volume solver. Comparisons with experimental data (NO and temperature profiles) and with finite rate chemistry simulations prove that the new model is capable to predict NO accurately.","inCitations":["300811ab5a4f32271496245e15b3ca63569fec60"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"A Novel Progress Variable Approach for Predicting NO in Laminar Hydrogen Flames","doi":"10.2514/6.2010-608","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.2514/6.2010-608","venue":""}

For such purpose, a study population comprising 20 female treated Class II malocclusion subjects with an initial mean age of 11 years underwent a two-phase treatment (orthopedics and orthodontics). The patients were diagnosed in centric relation and were treated according to the six keys for normal occlusion and functional occlusal parameters (centric relation, vertical dimension, lateral and anterior guidances, occlusal contacts and direction of forces applied on the teeth). After removal of fixed mechanics, retainers were installed and maintained for two years. Five years after orthodontic completion, the occlusal stability of the patients was evaluated regarding molar relationship and overjet, measured in dental casts.

We concluded that simultaneous evaluation of VEGF and EGFR expression may be crucial to select gastric cancer patients with poor prognosis who may benefit from tailored treatments. However, Liakakos et al. raised some concerns about the possibility of increasing cure rates by adding molecular drugs to adjuvant chemotherapy in all patients with stage II/III gastric cancer. Although gastric cancer is defined as a ‘‘rare disease’’ by the National Institute of Health, affecting fewer than 200,000 people in the US population, it still represents the second leading cause of cancer-related death throughout the world, with an estimated 700,000 deaths annually. Localized, nonmetastatic gastric cancer (serosaand/or node-positive cancer, namely, stage II or III according to the TNM stage system) represents a great therapeutic challenge with substantial differences between East and West. Since treatment expected to cure requires good local control and systemic therapy to control occult metastasis, Eastern physicians have claimed that advanced gastric cancer can be cured by complete tumor removal by surgery with appropriate lymphadenectomy, so called D2 resection, followed by adjuvant chemotherapy. Recently, the Japanese ACTS-GC trial has shown significantly better long-term survival in II and III TNM stage gastric cancer patients treated with radical surgery plus oral S-1 (tegafur, gimeracil, and oteracil) than in patients undergoing surgery alone [3-year survival rates were 80.5% and 70.1%, respectively; hazard ratio 0.68 (95% confidence interval 0.52–0.87), P = 0.0024]. Therefore, the standard treatment for curable advanced gastric cancer in Japan is D2 surgery followed by adjuvant chemotherapy with S-1 for 1 year. However, these excellent results have never been reproduced in the West, even by highly specialized teams performing D2 lymphadenectomy, and randomized control trials failed to prove the efficacy of adjuvant chemotherapy on surgery alone, with frequent locoregional recurrence and metastatic spread accounting for the still modest 5-year survival rates. Integrated treatments have been advocated to reduce postoperative relapse rates. In the USA, adjuvant 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)-based chemoradiotherapy after limited D1 surgery was established as standard treatment in node-positive gastric cancers undergoing potentially curative surgery; in Europe and the UK, perioperative epirubicin, cisplatin, 5-FU (ECF) chemotherapy was proposed as a standard treatment option for resectable gastric cancer, since it was shown to significantly improve survival after D2 surgery. However, despite these combined modality treatments, long-term results for stages II/III still remain poor in Western countries accounting for 5-year survival rates rather less than 50%. Thus, it is crucial to test newer regimens and multimodality treatments in order to pursue improved cure rates. Moreover, different clinical outcomes among patients in the same TNM stage receiving the same integrated treatments suggest, on one hand, biological and clinical heterogeneity of gastric cancer, and on the other, an urgent need to investigate new prognostic factors capable of selecting patients with high risk of recurrence. Recently, it has been suggested that molecularly based approaches may be critical for guiding treatment strategies in human malignancies, including gastric cancers. In this regard, determination of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) expression could be crucial for two reasons: first, for assessment of patient prognosis; and secondly, for identification of patients who could be treated with targeted therapies. In some human tumors, such as head and neck, lung, kidney, and colon cancers, both VEGF and EGFR expression were shown to correlate with more aggressive behavior, and selective anti-VEGF and antiEGFR targeted therapies were demonstrated to have potent antitumor activity alone and in combination with certain cytotoxic treatments. In Europe, bevacizumab, a VEGF-specific antibody, has been approved by the European Medicines Evaluation Agency (EMEA) for treatment of patients with metastatic carcinoma of the colon or rectum, in combination with fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy; in combination with paclitaxel, for first-line treatment of patients with metastatic breast cancer; in addition to platinum-based chemotherapy, for first-line treatment of patients with unresectable advanced, metastatic or recurrent non-small-cell lung cancer (www.emea. europa.eu). Cetuximab, an EGFR inhibitor, has been particularly studied and, at present, is indicated, in combination with irinotecan, for the treatment of patients with EGFR-expressing metastatic colorectal cancer after failure of irinotecan-including cytotoxic therapy; and, in combination with radiation therapy, for the treatment of patients with locally advanced squamous cell cancer of the head and Annals of Surgical Oncology 15(10):2983–2985 Published by Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2008 The Society of Surgical Oncology, Inc.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Integrated Therapy in Localized Gastric Cancer: Targeted and Tailored Approach","doi":"10.1245/s10434-008-0092-y","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1245/s10434-008-0092-y","venue":"Annals of Surgical Oncology"}

It is excusable for doctors to believe that if the serum thyroxine concentration is higher than the so-called normal range that the dose of thyroxine should be decreased. In fact, the thyroxine is replacing the thyroxine and tri-iodothyronine, which is produced by a normal gland. The only function of doing a thyroxine estimation is to confirm that the patient is taking the thyroxine and that it is being absorbed. Serum thyroxine concentration, if raised, confirms that the thyroxine replacement dose is inadequate but a suppressed concentration does not necessarily show that the dose is too high. Serum T3 must be kept within the normal range. Before the days of hormone assays, hypothyroid patients received about double the average dose of thyroxine given today, but did not develop osteoporosis or atrial fibrillation. Doses should be judged clinically rather than be governed by misinterpreted hormone results.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0140673600051485","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673600051485?dgcid=api_sd_search-api-endpoint","http://www.victorjtemple.com/PBL%20Thyroid%20function%20tests%20PPP%2011.pdf","http://www.iccidd.org/cm_data/2001_Zimmermann_Thyroid_function_test_Lancet.pdf"],"title":"Thyroid function tests","doi":"10.1016/S0140-6736(00)05148-5","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736%2800%2905148-5","venue":"The Lancet"}

Two sets (2004/2005, 2010/2011) of satellite images are used to visualize splay morphological developments and three types of crevasse splays are identified based on temporal changes: (1) new crevasse splays (NCS), refers to those splays that are not observed in the first set of images but can be observed on the second sets of images; (2) changing crevasse splays (CCS), representing those splays that are found on the first set of images but their geometry has changed between two satellite observation periods; and (3) inactive crevasse splays (ICS), referred to those splays that are found on the first set of images but on the second set of images they remain the same, or are partially overlapped by adjacent expanding crevasse splays. The density or frequency of these three types of crevasse splays has no correlation with the distance to the starting point of the river or the local slope. The cross-sectional area of the studied river steadily decreases downstream, and frequency analysis shows a downstream increase in the number of crevasse splays and suggests an exponential relationship with the river cross-sectional area. Development of crevasse splays is often attributed to topographic lows between adjacent crevasse splays, and they fill in the depression by compensational stacking e.g. Li et al. (2014). These amalgamated splays are capable of forming a large area of sheet sands and potentially provide an analogue for thin-bedded hydrocarbon reservoirs.","inCitations":["84fde9d902042674dd3b3d8e375cf42f1c12ef47","19c457faa4744248b56c39d8367a23f25e1d53fd","acdb8756d32b09ed08ab4300119091c09bb5b1e5","a002c9718346be20fbed3667f6a34ce9bbc0f81e","4618cfb8bc4efdab6d3426427590b9f71fb12b57","0e5cf419c43b260077be0a5aa7e33d5024b53747","d3f85df3dee1da1118a0183d247d5dae8eefb340","ccf10aa9c40750cc6e3b679e27f20f0c54a5238d"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Crevasse splay morphodynamics in a dryland river terminus: Rio Colorado in Salar de Uyuni Bolivia","doi":"10.1016/j.quaint.2014.11.066","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.quaint.2014.11.066","venue":""}

This proves the importance of this initiative for China and the long-term commitment of China to implement it. According to the Vision and Actions Plan to Jointly Built Belt and Road and the 21st Maritime Silk Road, it is a Chinese initiative born in China but turned to the world and it aims to a new global economic model that can support a sustainable global economy in 2100 BRI arises in the outcome of World Economic Crisis of 2008 which effects are still present in the world economy, and since 1997 Asian financial crisis until now China has adopted infrastructures investments as an economic counter-cycle measure. Also multilateral development financial institutions recommend their member states to increase infrastructures projects to underpin economic growth. The improvement of infrastructures and connectivity is a base for the development of trade, investment and economic activity. There is a tremendous academic research work on the impact of the construction of infrastructures, trade and investment in the economic growth. BRI takes these conclusions into consideration and advances new ways of progress pretending to reduce barriers and put countries working together with a new mindset based on knowledge, connectivity, trust and cooperation. But we face two realities in the world, for instance in Africa 650 million people don’t have yet electricity and in the developed world we are talking on big data and cloud computing. How to deal with this huge disparity? Does BRI call for the use of a global sustainability filter in strategic projects? Behind BRI, there is a financial sustainable rationale that should be prioratized; What is the cost of the infrastructures need to achieve this sustainable global economy? What are the sources for this financing? A model rather different from the traditional one China practised till now to implement infrastructures, the foreign aid model together with Outward Foreign Direct Investment or the Angola Mode Model will not serve this new vision of China for the world.
