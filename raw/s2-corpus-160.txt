Steady state bioconcentration factors or biomagnification factors measured with fish in laboratories are often used to estimate the importance of this undesirable process. In addition, to provide simplified estimates of bioconcentration or biomagnification factors, correlations between octan-1-ol/water partition coefficients and solubility in water have been evaluated. Although linear relationships are usually obtained, such relationships are not found for all kinds of chemicals. In particular for extremely hydrophobic chemicals significant deviations from linearity have been found. In the present paper elimination rates of 2,2',3,3',5,5' hexa- and 2,2',3,3',4,4',5,5' octachlorobiphenyl after dietary exposure are investigated. The data of the elimination process are described by first order kinetics. A good description of this elimination process is obtained if it is assumed that the fish is not one homogeneous kinetic compartment,but is composed of two compartments.","inCitations":["53a63af0ab14d788e82c02d1065fd51a5e8bb655","a5e140dd3453946e36c00560b25155c48d9dec67","5a0ccbbea9ecad8c95a1473428794122735f0df9"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Elimination kinetics of two unmetabolized polychlorinated biphenyls inPoecilla reticulata after dietary exposure","doi":"10.1007/BF01689095","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/BF01689095","venue":"Bulletin of environmental contamination and toxicology"}

Background Post mortem/biopsy studies have shown that DMF occurs in DCM, but its clinical significance remains largely unknown as its assessment requires invasive biopsy. EQ-CMR is a recently described technique that permits the non-invasive and accurate assessment of DMF by measuring the myocardial contrast volume of distribution (Vd(m)) at equilibrium contrast [1]. Methods Using international diagnostic guidelines we identified 28 patients with fDCM (mean age 42, 61% male, 89% NYHA class I, 11% NYHA class II). This cohort excluded the most severe cases of fDCM due to the high prevalence of permanent pacemakers or ICDs. The Vd(m) (a measure of DMF) was compared to that obtained in healthy volunteers (mean age 35, 63% male) and also to other indexed CMR parameters, including left atrial area and echocardiographic parameters of diastolic function (tissue doppler and strain imaging). Results fDCM patients had increased LV size (95mls/m2 vs 73mls/m2 , p=0.0001), worse ejection fraction (55% vs 69%, p<0.0001), increased indexed left atrial area (LAAi) (12.3cm2/m2 vs 9.5cm2/m2, p=0.0004) when compared to healthy volunteers. Significantly impaired diastolic function was detected in 14% of fDCM patients. No patients had worse than mild mitral regurgitation. The Vd(m) in patients was significantly greater than that of healthy volunteers (Fig 1) (0.282 vs 0.234, p=0.003). Vd(m) correlated with LAAi (fig 2) (r2= 0.44, p<0.0001) and EF (r2=0.12, p=0.034), but was independent of indexed LV diastolic volume, mass and echocardiographic derived parameters of diastolic function. On univariate analysis, LAAi was predicted by both Vd(m) (r2= 0.44) and E/Ea (r2= 0.31), which on multivariate analysis were independent with Vd(m) being the strongest predictor.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/pmc/30/18/1532-429X-13-S1-O108.PMC3106613.pdf","ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/pmc/30/18/J_Cardiovasc_Magn_Reson_2011_Feb_2_13(Suppl_1)_O108.tar.gz","https://jcmr-online.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/1532-429X-13-S1-O108"],"title":"The quantification and role of diffuse myocardial fibrosis in familial dilated cardiomyopathy - an equilibrium contrast cmr study","doi":"10.1186/1532-429X-13-S1-O108","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1532-429X-13-S1-O108","venue":"Journal of Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance"}

Important consequences are that Acehnese does not counterexemplify the universality of grammatical relations (contra Durie 1988 and subsequent), and that Acehnese provides clear morphological evidence for the presence in passives of the functional head that introduces the external argument.*","inCitations":["485501b9624c166b4b1cfeb1a6974f2f9aba9c3f","013e986345eac3bef6cb00e883b4994db7680de7","2be8dcd4484672286cc039f6c2ea9a9b63d2fa2f","bb26bc2e264e0ad7249f844a4a2b0f4783ef8132","56c427a56a1271217f49cc6d42cc506cebae7077","4d5b8cd454c00a83be4f4c1206a5b18881bb2cc1","e4ec42f9c821db2b136ac0d660d7830e86ff8374","522deebf75fdcbfecd46234fb8472c344e7a45db","102ad66911aaf76ae6341f1920e19414af017385","9d403fda822f8aeffe0da7a1c2f6f6a0c375f592","c1d843cd1988a1092516b18ae57747c5482776c6","49b05d991e57be12a0cd32880d7280b0b329a5df","751a2820558a8e667098576947a0f601de1ea840","157f0752b06db9588ef17b4e488ecb5a9f4a5bf7","bfe0c7d3b95cd97bf40d9ca462311747bcc182c5","a6762b2536a51968862b155aef1706a65695e37b","84afe9856c6b50e77dd8740a5fa604480f0f4042","1dc63656eac8dd02e2967b8b01a34a56c3a78fcf","003025f52ce8c64dd100de312ff377ce68650c53","035915ce19bd1757967c5d132707773099751698","91b5bc09dab880fae3ebcf2f336f9894202bdd40","98d72ab0a00e9e5fb20f564c06926f6af1653786","cf4fc337b6344b902c3d99808fab7c80f7b36871","4a93941e90ac9e35cc0c894d5d33f990f0f97ce0","aa6195696b4dfb4140d6ac38386861d50c0345a6","c61d3c07b49eb24713d07c3341b4c5313a2f10bf","37821ad80717c5749fe3e0deb28417a8ba80927d"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.ling.upenn.edu/~jlegate/88legate.pdf"],"title":"Subjects in Acehnese and the nature of the passive","doi":"10.1353/lan.2012.0069","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1353/lan.2012.0069","venue":""}

Nur in den untersuchten bildungsstarken Familien kam es zu einer gemeinschaftlichen Aneignung der Casting-Show, indem diese als Familienevent inszeniert wurde.

Previously, we reported the inhibitory effects of JuA on hippocampal formation in vivo and in vitro, the present study was carried out to examine the effects of JuA on glutamate (Glu)-mediated excitatory signal pathway in hippocampus. Microdialysis coupled with high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was used to monitor the changes of Glu levels in the hippocampus induced by penicillin sodium, or a mixture of penicillin sodium and JuA. The results showed that penicillin increased the hippocampal Glu concentration (p < 0.01) and a high dose of JuA (0.1 g/L) significantly blocked penicillin-induced Glu release (p < 0.05). Moreover, the effect of JuA on intracellular Ca2+ changes after the stimulation by Glu was studied in cultured hippocampal neurons with confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM). It was found that Glu (0.5 mM) induced an intracellular [Ca2+]i increase (p < 0.01), and JuA significantly inhibited the Glu-induced Ca2+ increase. The calmodulin (CaM) antagonist trifluoperazine (TFP) showed a similar inhibitory effect as JuA. These observations suggested that JuA has inhibitory effects on Glu-mediated excitatory signal pathway in hippocampus and probably acts through its anti-calmodulin action.","inCitations":["9a78183260a0086fe539fa6042d520284d1cbd4e","09cbb6bd48a5bddb717d63ca752d217c371deb12","2a36ea72a6efe1f08ac716e5262f98cee9f64ce7","81002a11915893b39119ca2c8f3acaf1b7e78514","eeb7d22750147b500e3abbd000e81295696a1bd9","f1c3b9330d86088f940888711747e22ab3b348be","3269eba3d1b09683f8b2c4428067074abb84b7c4","6ca4992590bded283f2ba52ff1d06df02bca5093","2d149b67a35b2f2024a52092b46c9431b57fa22e","7ef55ad28e7442759ea4f4a4ef75c545bc7fea81","8cdc3c1e35baa29153c84e9b8b9cf0cde26241d9","57a6d5dbd7c2d869f496fa56f2ba4f0fc2db5a50","2d599ffb32ac10ca84d1bd842956b57a1fc3d61b","6f21dedc9a248c873616c44faeccf695b158fa32","d125fc2c88440d27d662cdbde76e13a3abb5aafa","c375321154ff02be08adbb1d4bf72d3d2e848a21","220a9b8cc48f01e8728b00dd0fbaed237d40a857","86c02b937223a38ce57d73670da9f54b6c322066","1e57149811b08c68df5740e30612660a455c2b3a","76abbfad1e84bf4dc09774bd3887a77c7b71c8dd","870cd1066eb56ae6bba2d58964fb472c428c414f","d884c7ed2f6b39a2afb48314001fe0604da4f166","a55a354c5c25425f94bddda26754fbe6957e7f77","a0d612d6abfb878629500fda1fbd634ca2f454d7","fe5c725f379308cc62eca2c9affee719684c714b","193416ebe909aa8a6db7f38e420f964c88946d56","cc4d75358b5ad9fe8ef9b6323ef6d1e6acc5b035","5b219ea23b5088a9ad39782287567536b4c0a2cf","5de534ff64ee415bfd347c012c620120fb3a4c47","a2949d2e4022d0d2f4d149bb9ff5483ee1bdad80","feef212899c594366f84236342041190670c5a4c"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Inhibitory effect of jujuboside A on glutamate-mediated excitatory signal pathway in hippocampus.","doi":"10.1055/s-2003-42786","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1055/s-2003-42786","venue":"Planta medica"}

In this work, we seek new insights into the structure of single AgNssDNA clusters using analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC), nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, infrared spectroscopy and molecular dynamics simulations (MD) of a fluorescent (AgNssDNA)8+ nanocluster. The results suggest that the purified (AgNssDNA)8+ nanocluster is a mixture of predominantly Ag15 and Ag16 species that prefer two distinct long-lived conformational states: one extended, the other approaching spherical. However, the ssDNA strands within these clusters are highly mobile. Ag(i) interacts preferentially with the nucleobase rather than the phosphate backbone, causing a restructuring of the DNA strand relative to the bare DNA. Infrared spectroscopy and MD simulations of (AgNssDNA)8+ and model nucleic acid homopolymers suggest that Ag(i) has a higher affinity for cytosine over guanine bases, little interaction with adenine, and virtually none with thymine. Ag(i) shows a tendency to interact with cytosine N3 and O2 and guanine N7 and O6, opening the possibility for a Ag(i)-base bifurcated bond to act as a nanocluster nucleation and strand stabilizing site. This work provides valuable insight into nanocluster structure and dynamics which drive stability and optical properties, and additional studies using these types of characterization techniques are important for the rational design of single stranded AgDNA nanocluster sensors.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://ibbr.umd.edu/printpdf/91247"],"title":"Structural insights into DNA-stabilized silver clusters.","doi":"10.1039/c9sm00198k","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1039/c9sm00198k","venue":"Soft matter"}

Five of 11 patients had unequivocal confabulation as evidenced by ILMs. The presence of ILMs was associated with the degree of anosognosia (p=0.002), with hemispatial neglect (p<0.05), and with asomatognosia (p<0.01). The results confirm that a strong relation exists between anosognosia for hemiplegia and confabulations concerning the movement of the plegic limb.

The jet characteristics are determined by different factors, including the working parameters, the torch construction, the gas injection angle (GIA) etc. As there is little study on the influence of the GIA on the jet characteristics, experimental study on the GIA’s effects on the jet characteristics has been carried out on a specially designed non-transferred DC plasma torch, whose GIA can be changed by replacing a gas injection component. The arc voltages and thermal efficiencies of the plasma torch, the specific enthalpies and jet lengths of the plasma jets at different working conditions were obtained and analyzed. It has been found that the GIA greatly affects the arc voltage, the thermal efficiency, the specific enthalpy and the jet length. Based on these findings, plasma torch with appropriate GIA could be used to help generating the plasma jet with desired characteristics.","inCitations":["292a079ba09457c6e37b1ccf69f1dcacaaa33624","26ce57ec3661d87ef9718818989edc486153e3ff","62ca66bd70bcafa6c35d47d88eb1cdf11f3545bb","29892e2c34fd1517ad211c932cc59ec4fde978e5"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Influence of the Gas Injection Angle on the Jet Characteristics of a Non-transferred DC Plasma Torch","doi":"10.1007/s11090-016-9702-9","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11090-016-9702-9","venue":"Plasma Chemistry and Plasma Processing"}

Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) has previously been used to show that the conformation of aggregated, infectious PrP (PrP(Sc) ) varies between prion strains and these unique conformations may determine strain-specific disease phenotypes. However, the relative amounts of α-helix, β-sheet and other secondary structures have not always been consistent between studies, suggesting that other proteins might be confounding the analysis of PrP(Sc) secondary structure. We have used FTIR and LC-MS/MS to analyze enriched PrP(Sc) from mouse and hamster prion strains both before and after the removal of protein contaminants that commonly co-purify with PrP(Sc) . Our data show that non-PrP proteins do contribute to absorbances that have been associated with α-helical, loop, turn and β-sheet structures attributed to PrP(Sc) . The major contaminant, the α-helical protein ferritin, absorbs strongly at 1652 cm(-1) in the FTIR spectrum associated with PrP(Sc) . However, even the removal of more than 99% of the ferritin from PrP(Sc) did not completely abolish absorbance at 1652 cm(-1) . Our results show that contaminating proteins alter the FTIR spectrum attributed to PrP(Sc) and suggest that the α-helical, loop/turn and β-sheet secondary structure that remains following their removal are derived from PrP(Sc) itself.","inCitations":["fa46d2f2ff82c2549e477f3836d619d99f515626","c14a153a993037b3aa8531527e99cebe34a67d3b","37c8c146831f72d859cdd2b7df3ac50186505c0d","03925bc5590c11d4e25144148664093311d48a7e","1d969c216759ea218893e57189ae661725b047c1","2c89fe50c7e068228fe1ed1a28db09fa4fa05a71","9f57fdb88bca9f201430db9a8b32813b5748e3e5","9508456c161462497a8668f8e8a9552ae9b50b1b","aaa350a1d80355a2295db0cdf198c42145d870f0"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Identification and removal of proteins that co-purify with infectious prion protein improves the analysis of its secondary structure.","doi":"10.1002/pmic.201100253","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1002/pmic.201100253","venue":"Proteomics"}

Growth in BJ applications is driven by the use of finer powders and improved post-processing methods that can produce dense, homogenous final parts. However, understanding of the basic droplet/powder interaction is relatively limited. This paper considers the impact of in-process drying, part geometry, and droplet size on a key printing parameter: binder saturation. Parts of varying thicknesses are printed with a range of saturation levels under various heating conditions. The ratio of the printed part mass to the theoretical part mass is used to detect bleeding. In unheated powder beds, part mass increases linearly with printing saturation levels across the range tested (30 %–130 %). However, when the powder is heated between layers, there is a wide range of print saturation levels (30–80 %) over which increasing binder saturation or droplet volume does not increase the part mass. This stable part mass corresponds to accurate part geometries without bleeding and is likely due to enhanced evaporation of the binder solvent between layers. Smaller droplet volume (42 pl) was also shown to decrease saturation levels in unheated powder bed and in single layer parts. The differences in part mass with print saturation and droplet volume are most pronounced in thin parts. These observations lead to a simple method for determining an appropriate print saturation parameter for a powder/binder combination in thick parts.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Impact of part thickness and drying conditions on saturation limits in binder jet additive manufacturing","doi":"10.1016/j.addma.2020.101127","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.addma.2020.101127","venue":""}

Verbesserungen zeigten sich auch bei sekundären Endpunkten wie ACR50, ACR70 und PASI 75 (Psoriasis Area Severity Index). Insgesamt 422 PsA-Patienten mit aktiver Arthritis und aktiver Plaque-Psoriasis, die auf mindestens ein csDMARD („conventional synthetic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug“) nicht ausreichend angesprochen hatten und TNFi (TNF-Inhibitor)-naiv waren, erhielten im Rahmen der Studie OPAL Broaden randomisiert Tofacitinib (5 bzw. 10 mg 2 × tgl.), 40 mg s.c.

Materials were irradiated at 25 to 200 C by high-energy protons and neutrons from an 800-MeV, 1-mA proton beam at the Los Alamos Neutron Science Center (LANSCE). The proton flux produced in LANSCE is nearly prototypic of anticipated conditions for significant portions of the APT target/blanket system. The objective of this testing program was to determine the change in crack-extension resistance of candidate APT materials from irradiation at prototypic APT temperatures and proton and neutron fluxes. J-integral-resistance (J-R) curve toughness tests were conducted in general accordance with the American Society for Testing and Materials Standard Test Method for Measurement of Fracture Toughness, E 1820-99, with a computer-controlled test and data acquisition system. J-R curves were obtained from subsize disk-shaped compact tension specimens (12.5 mm in diameter) with thicknesses of 4 mm or 2 mm. Irradiation up to 12 dpa significantly reduced the fracture toughness of these materials. Alloy 718 had the lowest fracture toughness in bothmore » the unirradiated and irradiated conditions. All irradiated specimens of Alloy 718 failed by sudden unstable crack extension regardless of dose or test temperature. Type 304L and 316L stainless steels had a high level of fracture toughness in the unirradiated condition and exhibited reduction in fracture toughness to saturation levels of 65 to 100 MPa{radical}m. The present reduction in fracture toughness is similar to changes reported from fission reactor studies. However, the currently observed losses in toughness appear to saturate at doses slightly lower than the dose required for saturation in reactor-irradiated steels. This difference might be attributed to the increased helium and hydrogen production associated with irradiation in the high-energy, mixed proton/neutron spectrum.« less","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Fracture Toughness Characterization of 304L and 316L and Alloy 718 After Irradiation in High-Energy, Mixed Proton/Neutron Spectrum","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

We selected the Gossypium hirsutum GDSL (GhGDSL) lipase/hydrolase gene (CotAD_74480), which is expressed during SCW biosynthesis (19 through to 25 days postanthesis; DPA), for study. T1 -transgenic cotton lines expressing the β-glucuronidase (gus) reporter under the control of a 1026-bp promoter fragment of GhGDSL (PGhGDSL ) showed 19 DPA stage-specific increase in GUS expression. 5' deletion indicated that the 194-bp fragment between -788 and -594 relative to the transcription start site was essential for this stage-specific expression. Site-directed mutagenesis of eight transcription factor binding sites within PGhGDSL demonstrated that the MYB1AT motif (AAACCA) at -603/-598 was critical for the 19 DPA-specific reporter gene expressions. Yeast one-hybrid (Y1H) analysis identified nine proteins, including GhMYB1 (CotAD_64719) that bound to the PGhGDSL promoter. Further, Y1H experiments using the 5' promoter deletions and individually mutated promoter motifs indicated that GhMYB1 interacted with PGhGDSL at MYB1AT sequence. GhMYB1 was expressed specifically in fibre from 19 DPA, overlapping with the sharp rise in GhGDSL expression, indicating that it could regulate GhGDSL during fibre development. Analysis of genes co-expressed with GhMYB1 showed that it potentially regulates a number of other 19-25 DPA-specific genes in networks including those functioning in the cell wall and precursor synthesis, but not the major polysaccharide and protein components of the fibre SCW. GhGDSL and its promoter are therefore potential tools for the improvement of cotton fibre quality traits.","inCitations":["3d5f8e31d6528ff8e746191806c2dc3756ff1c38","a3e927028c3c6da201fe10e99f075970c5998847","3104470e3f0c6a7bf14fa5804520a477cbd0b80b","cee130cb44be193f040711bafca7b0fb69c516a9","d671c08a0951a55b2669445fd7f2488888c15f2c","932a4260812e7313d155f5daf7af60838357aa4a"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"GhMYB1 regulates SCW stage‐specific expression of the GhGDSL promoter in the fibres of Gossypium hirsutum L.","doi":"10.1111/pbi.12706","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1111/pbi.12706","venue":"Plant biotechnology journal"}

The SN arose from an earlier detachment of Montoneros, thus becoming the first political dissent of what was the political-military organization flagship of the argentinian peronist left, achieving to consolidate in major industrial cities. The focus is upon its uniqueness in comparison in the complex field of armed peronists organizations, the inquiry into aspects of the subjective experiences of the protagonists of such experience and the tactical and strategical definitions assumed by the SN.

It was found that BLFC oxides with Cu doping range of 0.075–0.15 maintain cubic perovskite phase in a wide range of temperatures. More Cu introduced at the B-site results in a gradual increase of the electrical conductivity, which is attributed to the denser overlapping of electron clouds of Cu–O bonds. With increasing Cu content, the oxygen vacancy concentration increases and the oxygen ion migration energy decreases, leading to the highest oxygen permeation flux of 1.59 mL cm−2 min−1 recorded for Ba0.975La0.025Fe0.9Cu0.1O3-δ 1 mm thick membrane at 950 °C. However, the oxygen permeability decreases with further Cu doping, which may be correspond to a presence of defect association. Ba0.975La0.025Fe0.9Cu0.10O3-δ membrane with 0.7 mm thickness delivers stable oxygen permeation flux of 1.57 mL cm−2 min−1 for 200 h at 900 °C.

Taylor","ids":["144588645"]}],"journalName":"Journal of Professional Issues in Engineering Education and Practice","paperAbstract":"Facility and infrastructure construction technology is advancing at astounding rates. As the complexity of technology grows, so does the technical, professional, and ethical obligations of the engineers charged with the safety, health, and welfare of the public. Professional licensing establishes a standard for technical and ethical engineering knowledge that mitigates risk and holds engineers accountable for their work. However, military engineers, as federal employees, enjoy sovereign immunity, which among other benefits excuses them from holding professional licenses in order to practice their profession legally. Under the doctrine of sovereign immunity, military engineers are able to plan, design, and build both facilities and infrastructure systems on military bases without a requirement for professional licensure. Without the threat of legal action from the civilian court system, discipline from state regulatory agencies, or an incentive of greater pay, a military engineer is not externally motivated to pursue a Professional Engineering (PE) license (Sweet 2008). While practicing engineering without licensure is legal under sovereign immunity, is it the most responsible option? Should military engineers only operate at the requirement of law, which is the “minimum standard of behavior that a person should follow?” (Fan and Fox 2009). Or, are military engineers ethically bound by codes such as the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE), which require them to (ASCE 2008): • “Perform services only in areas of competence,” • “Continue their professional development throughout their careers,” • “Provide opportunities for the professional development of those engineers under their supervision,” and above all, • “Hold paramount the safety, health, and welfare of the public” (ASCE Code of Ethics adopted 1914 amended 1996). Currently, all Air Force officers, including civil engineers are bound to the core values of the Air Force: integrity first, service before self, and excellence in all we do. These core values establish an ethical climate within the Air Force, which aims to guide professional conduct (Department of the Air Force 1998). Furthermore, upon completion of an initial eight-week training course, United States Air Force (USAF) Civil Engineers are awarded an occupational badge to wear on their uniform. This badge allows engineers to be recognized as possessing an expected level of competence pursuant to the badge level and a high ethical standard (Department of the Air Force 2010). The badge levels include Basic, Senior, and Master and indicate both time in service and achievement of specific technical training. Thus, obtaining professional licensure aligns with the symbolism of the badge and core values that all military engineers subscribe to. This paper focuses on the area of concern, legal but unethical behavior; an area where military engineers are currently performing engineering services without a professional license. Figure 1 shows four areas of ethical and unethical behavior in relation to legal and illegal behavior that are a common theme in professional ethics (Hinze 2001). Further, this paper addresses many factors that prevent military engineers, specifically USAF Civil Engineers, from meeting their ethical obligations and responsibilities to seek licensure. A recent analysis of 1,270 USAF Civil Engineer records showed that only 9% of the eligible (approximately 790 eligible) Civil Engineer officers ever attain Professional Engineer licensure. Keep in mind that over 480 Civil Engineer officers have less than four years of service and therefore do not meet the minimum experience requirements for licensure. Professional licensing sets a standard of ethical and technical ability. Several examples throughout this paper will underscore the increased risk for negative consequences that may result from military engineers choosing to forego a professional license. Presented below are four aspects of risk which licensing should mitigate and without which military engineers are vulnerable. • Mismanagement of facilities and infrastructure construction due to lack of experience (experience under mentor is required for PE License), • Below-standard work due to ignorance of standards, • Increased likelihood that the next generation of military engineers will not be licensed (fewer mentors available with licenses equates to fewer engineering interns able to fulfill prelicense requirements), and • Ultimately accidents, injury, or death due to substandard quality work; the paramount ethical responsibility entrusted to engineers (Griggs 2009). Military engineers have a responsibility to seek out professional licensure not only for these ethical reasons but also out of respect for their profession. One of the Air Force Civil Engineer’s strategic goals is to organize, develop, enable, and retain a trained, capable total force of Civil Engineers [United States Air Force (USAF)","inCitations":["c12fd95d4b1f4f39978da74d8a48f227d5b75e60","2db1dfd593853113bf6eb9ff341721974918a691"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Professional Licensure: Is It an Air Force Ethical Requirement?","doi":"10.1061/(ASCE)EI.1943-5541.0000083","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1061/%28ASCE%29EI.1943-5541.0000083","venue":""}

This equation is mathematically similar to the Mattedi-Tavares-Castier (1998) equation, but instead of using group contributions, the σ-profiles were used for molecular description. The interaction energy needed to calculate the probability of a contact in the equation of state is similar to the term used in the COSMO-SAC model. For each of the 169 substances studied here, three (3) parameters of the equation were estimated: the lattice cell molar volume (v∗) and two non-electrostatic parameters (C0,NE and C1,NE). Experimental vapor pressures and saturated liquid volumes were used to estimate these parameters and mean relative deviations 2.49% and 7.47% were found for vapor pressure and saturated liquid volume, respectively. It was also performed an analysis of the estimated parameters of some homologous series, resulting in universal functions for for all estimated parameters as function of van der Waals volume (VvdW).","inCitations":["669e3a98894327b0f37beafeaf41116bb4bff9b6"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Equation of state based on the hole-lattice theory and surface-charge density (COSMO): Part A – Pure compounds","doi":"10.1016/j.fluid.2015.11.010","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fluid.2015.11.010","venue":""}

Biological Sciences","paperAbstract":"Synchronous suspensions of the radiosensitive S/S variant of the L5178Y murine leukaemic lymphoblast at different positions in the cell cycle were exposed aerobically to segments of heavy-ion beams (20Ne, 28Si, 40Ar, 56Fe and 93Nb) in the Bragg plateau regions of energy deposition. The incident energies of the ion beams were in the range of 460 ± 95 MeV u-1, and the calculated values of linear energy transfer (LET∞) for the primary nuclei in the irradiated samples were 33 ± 3, 60 ± 3, 95 ± 5, 213 ± 21 and 478 ± 36 keV μm-1, respectively; 280 kVp X-rays were used as the baseline radiation. Generally, the maxima or inflections in relations between relative biological effectiveness (RBE) and LET∞ were dependent upon the cycle position at which the cells were irradiated. Certain of those relations were influenced by post-irradiation hypothermia. Irradiation in the cell cycle at mid -G1 to mid-G1 +3 h, henceforth called G1 to G1 + 3 h, resulted in survival curves that were close approximations to simple exponential functions. As the LET∞ was increased, the RBE did not exceed 1.0, and by 478 keV μm-1 it had fallen to 0.39. Although similar behaviour has been reported for inactivation of proteins and certain viruses by ionizing radiations, so far the response of the S/S variant is unique for mammalian cells. The slope of the survival curve for X-photons (D0:0.27 Gy) is reduced in G1 to G1 + 3 h by post-irradiation incubation at hypothermic temperatures and reaches a minimum (D0: 0.51 Gy) at 25 °C. As the LET∞ was increased, however, the extent of hypothermic recovery was reduced progressively and essentially was eliminated at 478 keV μm-1. At the cycle position where the peak of radioresistance to X-photons occurs for S/S cells, G1 + Sh, increases in LET∞ elicited only small increases in RBE (at 10% survival), until a maximum was reached around 200 keV μm-1. At 478 keV μm-1, what little remained of the variation in response through the cell cycle could be attributed to secondary radiations (δ rays) and smaller nuclei produced by fragmentation of the primary ions. Definitions 1. Linear energy transfer (LET∞) is the energy deposited per unit length of track by an ionizing particle and usually is measured in kiloelectron volts per micrometer (in water). 2. Penumbra. Atomic interactions along the track of a heavy ion result in the ejection of electrons with energies sufficient to move beyond the region of dense ionization which constitutes the track core, and so may be considered to form a penumbra of sparsely ionizing radiations around the track core. 3. RBE. The effectiveness of a densely ionizing radiation (heavy ion) compared to a sparsely ionizing radiation, e. g. X- or γ -photons, is measured by the inverse ratio of the doses of each radiation needed to produce a given radiobiological effect, and is known as the relative biological effectiveness (RBE): the usual reference radiation is 250 kVp X-rays. 4. D0 is a measure of the radiosensitivity of a cell as determined from the (limiting) linear slope of the survival curve, and is the dose in Gray (1 Gy ≡ 1 Joule kg-1) required to reduce the survival at a point anywhere in that region of the survival curve to 37% of its value at that point.","inCitations":["31c57901ae2c71718afcd10a61a3c8cc228e6649"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Responses of synchronous L5178Y S/S cells to heavy ions and their significance for radiobiological theory","doi":"10.1098/rspb.1989.0034","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1098/rspb.1989.0034","venue":"Proceedings of the Royal Society of London.

Objectives We investigated the effect of IXE treatment for 16-weeks on work productivity and activity impairment among patients with radiographic axSpA (r-axSpA) using data from the biologic-naive and TNFi-experienced patients receiving either placebo (PBO), IXE, or adalimumab (ADA; if biologic-naive). Methods Both COAST-V and COAST-W investigated the efficacy and safety of IXE among patients with r-axSpA that either were biologic-naive patients (COAST-V, NCT02696785) or TNFi-experienced patients (COAST-W, NCT02696798), as defined by prior inadequate response or intolerance to 1 or 2 TNFi. Patients were required to have a diagnosis of axSpA. Patients fulfilled ASAS criteria for r-axSpA and mNY criteria for ankylosing spondylitis. Active disease was defined by BASDAI ≥4 and back pain ≥4 on a numeric ratings scale (NRS).1,2 Full eligibility criteria were previously reported.1,2Patients were treated with placebo (PBO), 40-mg adalimumab (ADA) every 2 weeks (Q2W; COAST-V only), 80-mg IXE Q2W (IXEQ2W) or every 4 weeks (IXEQ4W) for 16 weeks. Work productivity was investigated using the Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire for Ankylosing Spondylitis (WPAI:SpA). Individual and integrated study data were analyzed using analysis of covariance models. Results reported as least squares mean (LSM) change from baseline±standard error (SE). Integrated data of COAST-V and -W were analyzed for inferential statistics due to small sample sizes in the individual studies. ADA was included in COAST-V as an active reference arm only, and the study was not powered to allow comparisons between the IXE and ADA arms. Results Overall, 365 (64.5%) PBO- and IXE-treated patients reported paid work (part-time or full-time) at baseline in COAST-V and COAST-W. Based on integrated data, Absenteeism was significantly lower in IXEQ2W treated patients than PBO and Presenteeism, Work Productivity Loss, and Activity Impairment were significantly reduced in IXEQ2W and IXEQ4W treated patients versus PBO (Table 1). WPAI-SpA outcomes for biologic-naive and TNFi-experienced were similar with some exceptions (Table 2). The active reference arm (ADA) exhibited numerical improvements for presenteeism, work productivity, and activity impairment versus PBO. Conclusion In this integrated analysis of patients with active r-axSpA, IXE treatment for 16 weeks yielded significant improvements in work productivity and activity impairment versus PBO. The effect is similar in biologic-naive and TNFi-experienced patients. A limitation for evaluations of work productivity in the individual studies was the relatively low number of employed patients.

Video blocking artifacts are measured by splitting the picture into small blocks and calculating the difference of the pixels around each border while video blurring is measured by getting edge information through Sobel operator, and counting the gradient histogram. The weighted sum of block artifacts scores and blurring scores can be calculated using linear regression. In order to eliminate the impact of different video contents, the scores which represent the quality of videos need to be normalized.

Los sitios estudiados incluyen minas, areas de trabajo, talleres de chancado, campamentos habitacionales y sitios de tarea, todos agrupados en torno a las principales fuentes de turquesa y de agua de la localidad de El Abra. A partir de una consideracion de los sitios, sus materialidades y contextos, asi como el patron de asentamiento a nivel de la localidad, se reconstruyen la organizacion y el funcionamiento de la explotacion minera. AbstractThis paper analyze the archaeological evidences associated with copper mining in San Jose del Abra, Northern Chile, during the Late Period (ca. 1450-1536 AD). The sites under study include mining operations, working areas, domestic facilities and task-specific campsites, all of them grouped around the main turquoise and water sources in San Jose del Abra. Trough the description, analysis and discussion of the sites themselves, its archaeological materials and contexts and the settlement system of this locality, we attempt to reconstruct the organization and functioning of copper mining under Inka rule.","inCitations":["6fcbef699b24ae5605ed39429d52327e84e81f6c","6369b3e8a26c6bd653095901f7030a5a15ee1751"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"La producción minera en San José del Abra durante el período Tardío atacameño","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}
