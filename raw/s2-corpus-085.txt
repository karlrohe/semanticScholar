The edaphic fauna of zonal untouched soils in natural ecosystems located in the different zones of the Republic of Moldova has been investigated. Soils of the natural ecosystems are the habitat and the source of the conservation and reproduction of the edaphic fauna. They represent themselves the standards of the biodiversity for soil invertebrates. The database of the invertebrates’ diversity of virgin and fallow soils has a practical importance as the natural standard for the operative evaluation of degradation processes and ecological effectiveness of the land management. Agricultural practices with the involvement of areas with multiannual grasses in a crop rotation system created conditions for the improvement of the invertebrate’s biodiversity in the chernozem which degraded as a result of a long-term arable use. The use of ryegrass and lucerne mixture during 3-5 years helps to restore the soil invertebrates at the expense of exudates contribution in the soil and roots of perennial crop residues. This procedure has promoted the revival of population of invertebrates. The number of invertebrates on average was 2.5 times higher compared with the control, the total biomass – by 1.6 times. This method is especially effective to restore the Lumbricidae family. Their number increased by 3.0 and biomass – by 2.0 times. The recovery rate of the population of Lumbricidae family reaches of 14.9 ex m-2 per year. Invertebrates’ diversity has been improved, the number of invertebrates’ families increased from 2-4 to 5-6.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/53453/1/MPRA_paper_53453.pdf"],"title":"Conservation of invertebrates’ biodiversity in soils of the Republic of Moldova","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Miran’s book is full of examples of Sufi brotherhoods, family connections, and trade routes that link Massawa to the Mediterranean and to Southwest and South Asian parts of the Indian Ocean, but there is hardly a mention of any such linkages with the Swahili world. One wonders if this is an oversight by the author or represents a precursor of the contemporary phenomenon of African nations often having stronger commercial connections to their former colonizers than to their neighbors. In fact the similarities between the port that Miran describes and ports like Zanzibar, Aden, Mombasa, and even Bombay or Singapore suggest that Miran’s work in Massawa may lend itself to the creation of a template or typology of colonial era ports in the western Indian Ocean and perhaps more broadly in the entire Indian Ocean. The cosmopolitanism that he notes there seems to be a feature of any number of Indian Ocean ports in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. While the book represents a major contribution to the literature on the Indian Ocean in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, it is not without its problems. It appears to have grown out of a very thoroughly researched dissertation and as a result sometimes has far more evidence than is needed to make its case, and sometimes the evidence is underanalyzed. The author also does not really trace out the connections that his subjects have to other regions. Massawa’s cosmopolitanism seems like an intensely local cosmopolitanism, as if it’s more about jockeying for power and prestige than it is about actual engagement with distant people and places. That may have been the reality of the situation, but it would have been interesting to see some of the connections and networks explored more thoroughly. Still it is a fine book and should encourage similar studies of other Indian Ocean ports in the colonial period. erik gilbert Arkansas State University","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Upstream Odyssey: An American in China, 1895-1944 (review)","doi":"10.1353/jwh.2011.0089","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1353/jwh.2011.0089","venue":""}

These substituents are highly variable allowing for a large range of properties. Such properties include being weakly basic, chemically inert, non-nucleophilic, and resistant to reduction or oxidation. Due to these properties, carborane anions have been given the term \"weakly coordinating\" to describe their interactions with cations. The isolation of numerous reactive species, superacids, and coordinatively unsaturated cations are testaments to the weak coordinating ability of carboranes.Recently carborane anions have begun being transition from being used for fundamental chemistry to applied chemistry with their utility in Lewis acid catalysis being explored by a number of research groups. This dissertation follows this transition as the exploration and discovery of new cations is explored in Chapter 2. Next by careful substitution at the C-vertex the synthesis of carborane anions that can coordinate to transition metals was attempted. By limiting the coordination of the transition metal to the substituent off the C-vertex the carborane ligand can stabilize traditional transition metal catalysts. The two specific substituents targeted in this research are phosphines and azides.Phosphines are an obvious choice as their use in transition metal catalysis is ubiquitous. Chapter 3 reports the synthesis and coordination to a gold (I) center of the diisopropyl undecachlorocarborane phosphine anion, iPr2P(CB11Cl11)-.Upon coordination to the gold, zwitterionic and anionic complexes were isolated. These compounds success in hydroamination of alkynes with amines serve as a proof of principle in the use of carboranes in ligand design. Azides arethe next target for the synthesis of new carborane anion ligands, since the azide can be a versitile synthon. Chapter 4 discusses the attempted synthesis of the undecachlroinated carboranyl azide, N3CB11Cl11-, and the competing side reaction discovery. This cycloaddition results it the cleavage of a typically inert B-Cl bond. The discovery of a new reaction involving both a carbon and a boron vertex being substituted resulted in the expansion of possible carborane fused triazole anions. Before these can be used as ligands their fundamental chemistry is studied in Chapters 5 and 6. The study of the carborane fused heterocycle resulted in the synthesis of a triazolium carborane zwitterion and a triazolium carborane radical anion.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Carborane Anions: As Weakly Coordinating Counterions and Coordinating Ligands for Catalyst Design","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

We developed patient-specific anatomical models with pulsatile flow circuit and investigated factors associated with AR after TAVR.\n\n\nMETHODS\nBased on pre-procedural computed tomography (CT) data of the six patients who underwent transfemoral TAVR using a 23-mm SAPIEN XT, anatomically and mechanically equivalent aortic valve models were developed. Forward flow and heart rate of each patient in two days after TAVR were duplicated under mean aortic pressure of 80mmHg. Paravalvular leakage (PVL) volume in basal and additional conditions was measured for each model using an electromagnetic flow sensor. Incompletely apposed tract between the transcatheter and aortic valves was examined using a micro-CT.\n\n\nRESULTS\nPVL volume in each patient-specific model was consistent with each patient's PVL grade, and was affected by hemodynamic conditions. PVL and total regurgitation volume increased with the mean aortic pressure, whereas closing volume did not change. In contrast, closing volume increased proportionately with heart rate, but PVL did not change. The minimal cross-sectional gap had a positive correlation with the PVL volumes (r=0.89, P=0.02). The gap areas typically occurred in the vicinity of the bulky calcified nodules under the native commissure.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nPVL volume, which could be affected by hemodynamic conditions, was significantly associated with the minimal cross-sectional gap area between the aortic annulus and the stent frame. These data may improve our understanding of the mechanism of the occurrence of post-TAVR PVL.","inCitations":["4dffe0c42a3ab4bb6978a8cf508651658aa7a19e","7746e3a84cb44de785caebc5d1eba89c2053c944"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Quantitative assessment of paravalvular leakage after transcatheter aortic valve replacement using a patient-specific pulsatile flow model.","doi":"10.1016/j.ijcard.2017.11.106","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijcard.2017.11.106","venue":"International journal of cardiology"}

Most programs have relied on purging dogs with arecoline hydrobromide and examining purge samples for worms to diagnose infection. This technique is time consuming and suffers from limitations including poor sensitivity, particularly in dogs with light infections, risk of hydatid infection to control personnel and severe side-effects of the arecoline in some dogs. Also, availability of praziquantel in several countries has further limited the value of the technique as owners can treat their dogs to eliminate worms prior to presenting them for purging. Application of a simple and sensitive immunological or serological detection system would overcome these problems and be a useful adjunct in control programs. Reports have described alternative techniques which show promise for accurate diagnosis of E. granulosus infection in the definitive host (Jenkins and Rickard, 1985, 1986; Craig et al., 1988). Recently, an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using E. granulosus protoscolex antigen was developed (Gasser et al., 1988), and its sensitivity was higher than the level achieved in studies using arecoline testing (Gemmell, 1968; Trejos et al., 1975). The aim of the present study was to assess the performance of the ELISA in an endemic area of Kenya for detecting dogs with E. granulosus infection, and comparing serological data with parasitological data obtained from the dogs by necropsy.

Richards, professor of the history of science and medicine at the University of Chicago, concludes his excellent, well-illustrated, scholarly biography of the German biologist Ernst Haeckel, The Tragic Sense of Life, with the following thought: ‘The sustained hostile reaction to Haeckel over the years has stemmed, I believe, from his passionately driven personality and the reckless abandon with which he pursued his Darwinian modernist convictions’. Ever since Darwin’s day, detractors of Haeckel – whether fellow biologists, historians of science or creationists – have levelled grave charges against him. Haeckel stands accused of not being a true Darwinian, of pushing a discredited theory (‘ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny’), of fraud in his artistically gifted drawings of animal embryos, of being a shameless populariser of evolution, of atheistic immorality as a convinced monist, and of purveying racial views acceptable to the Nazis after his death in 1919. Richards is determined to rescue Haeckel from themore malign of these attacks, and at the same time to remind the academic world of how much serious science he achieved andwhyDarwin keenly admired him and remained friends with him until his death. At their first meeting in Down House in 1866, Darwin said warmly: ‘Your boldness sometimes makes me tremble, but as Huxley remarked, someone must be bold enough to make a beginning in drawing up tables of descent’. To the fifth edition of The Origin of Species published in 1869, Darwin added the following lines: ‘Professor Häckel, in his Generelle Morphologie and in several other works, has recently brought his great knowledge and abilities to bear onwhat he calls phylogeny, or the lines of descent of all organic beings. . . . He has thus boldly made a great beginning, and shows how classification will in future be treated’. A paragraph in the biography’s introduction summarises Haeckel’s contributions to science (as opposed to his rip-roaring success as a writer on evolution and religion for the general public with books such as The History of Creation and The Riddle of the Universe, in their English versions). ‘Haeckel gave currency to the idea of the ‘‘missing link’’ between apes and man; and in the early 1890s, Eugène Dubois, inspired by Haeckel’s ideas, actually found its remains where the great evolutionists had predicted, in the Dutch East Indies’, writes Richards. ‘Haeckel formu-","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://home.uchicago.edu/~rjr6/Reviews/Haeckel%20Endeavour.pdf"],"title":"A scientific romantic","doi":"10.1016/j.endeavour.2008.06.004","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.endeavour.2008.06.004","venue":""}

Growth rates (g/d) for the five treatments were 218, 253, 253, 256 and 292. Addition of sulphate significantly increased growth rate and food utilization while MHA had no effect; formalin treatment reduced digestibility and food utilization. In a second experiment 58 lambs were used to study the effect of protein supplements for lambs weaned at various ages and weights. Diets similar to (2) and (5) from Expt. 1 were used, while an intermediate diet (6) was made from an equal mixture of diets (2) and (5). As weaning age increased and as live weight at weaning increased, the difference in growth rate and food utilization between lambs receiving diet (2) and those receiving diets (5) and (6) decreased. It is suggested that for most sheep production systems in which concentrates are used either as the sole feed or as supplements, simple fortification of whole grain with the necessary nutrients is all that is required to achieve optimum results.","inCitations":["33ca8642766b274c6fda8e17843b51f906b67005","a9e913b195a123ce2004de636b36be42f14d57d3"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"The use of whole barley diets fortified with solutions of urea, minerals and vitamins for lambs","doi":"10.1016/0377-8401(77)90003-7","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/0377-8401%2877%2990003-7","venue":""}

Blink suppression is thought to result from an extra-retinal signal that is associated with the blink motor command and may act to attenuate the sensory consequences of the motor action. However, the neural mechanisms underlying this phenomenon remain unclear. They are challenging to study because any brain-activity changes resulting from an extra-retinal signal associated with the blink motor command are potentially masked by profound neural-activity changes caused by the retinal-illumination reduction that results from occlusion of the pupil by the eyelid. Here, we distinguished direct top-down effects of blink-associated motor signals on cortical activity from purely mechanical or optical effects of blinking on visual input by combining pupil-independent retinal stimulation with functional MRI (fMRI) in humans. Even though retinal illumination was kept constant during blinks, we found that blinking nevertheless suppressed activity in visual cortex and in areas of parietal and prefrontal cortex previously associated with awareness of environmental change. Our findings demonstrate active top-down modulation of visual processing during blinking, suggesting a possible mechanism by which blinks go unnoticed.","inCitations":["20ca629908269c6236f7eeba488ea694f3fa8106","ae2d8cf79cf8ae7cb382f7e143da2633a5f2725c","284406c0e99dc035079d76825a2f7370c69d8c18","c5fed6d463367efb9000a5c59eac50e8240fbb4f","9e73f8fca100953cbaf890c21193a8c9c3f203be","8bea6b59366fe14c1a7c26c01a22891908d9e3e0","47cda59c2bd60187c5a482e61681ae0f83df798e","700f1434b70aa89fa2e7876704cca1437f7ab6eb","38bd7dd25b0f82f2f04163fa4f97be83b3e71a4f","7bad96a29a298fd6f7605bf8830884ac2f51ffa3","8cfeb68228d86d29ef7a86331cbc4aefac1a2e9b","3d6621ade6be4ba72dc3e2d5c5c298617024a5b0","339c2c4b6e75753185451001f4ab01aa873e088a","b72ce3aee42e2aaa902841830e3e6259147c7913","a315f44823afcf2378c5a3030268b337da23d141","aec55e5a3add1506bc8cba55765efd51a6833ddb","9695d4c31eb23c65870b022d413e70f0fd982eaa","dbcdbbffe90c77d9896508f8664b6d7684448f6b","fe7a1078597c002a4045fc3162770909b3a5a173","94de7beebb4c827b0fb9c5b882c6395a79b337cd","06038740ae6696fe8cfdf3d4dc1ea8eccbd6bb30","ded622772306681e2710578aa9fb32ac5ec7eb7d","e091800b75314c929efddbaa54f537b78c5b99b9","0856df70311de23b028c0a3011c7ae3be34db25d","5c400035a1d9f13775c3255b1b94b144cc3c67e9","a95c401e6cba8bf23ab12834997aad362c96c2f6","185984c72a1f7866d020123de6f9d4406d9f1749","a06ebb4fc64486ea8d97b3061e3ea0d4a64f18ce","7b6e1d3484b37a89982dc64d13cfe155c5121cb2","d604bd9c7374ac76399b2bb281ddbb7397c415fe","0b825284b126a2f4b37a780976fec577debbec5c","f4da345b47ca0c4ffcdab9b432d3baa93817fc45","aee4bc0f5377f3dce509374be0e55e6c5f0ba956","b82d01aae5004a73f790d59029dc73af13ad61f6","4fb800d95cd27f04bd0c9e3969634a8e1c7b7054","d1696d396ab97f91793568f6e1b9b1fdacb1567f","c71d30a3b1f1db723e72e6007d2d9abb6f0e8b27","78f2fd55c58fd8d18adb2e340dfc8cd07bee02f7","2a5bb1a16e9bda34e8dffa199180ffcef65673d3","431ab8c50e0b009bac04021b22eb0a3049f35b2a","a54cc76cccfd562f2535b505743e4f14b3a10381","79954e7e7367415eccaf84fa6891a4e379118c2c","5ce933e824b1297150837c24a27b5c3e48ec5933","069156e9a855dcd7a1ff1a5faf34c1693500513b","f35e6c6c59bb2ff756af1114959847000cb1c191","715d7e095d8c709cc64a90e275d8c2042bda887f","41a41a52bbfaae482605afd4fc2fc4b44baa7a3f","ec2194d330b11a30aec917cf9cf6e4c7f886ac43","1fa58bfec6b40cf12f276b46fd06b0e1dcef7c12","4c3ba01dbc6b4516f2812f8f5aa5860bf7dd78ef","f6633b00c7504cefb1f2819e84a795e0d2e50759","d776e4bdcd5c6a8261ac23b484ad7c741843038c","6a07bc5307e7b742423986a79102c6313162c986","db20e428ea1ee440ff0587ed0c513eeb8591a3be","01b5df700d906dfcbc2fa30336fff8ee8b302ba1"],"pdfUrls":["https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0960982205006603","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982205006603"],"title":"Blinking Suppresses the Neural Response to Unchanging Retinal Stimulation","doi":"10.1016/j.cub.2005.06.025","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2005.06.025","venue":"Current Biology"}

The use of principal component analysis causes improvement in terms of imperceptibility and the utilization of singular value decomposition helped to get good results in respect of robustness and capacity. Whereas, a method adapted to choose elements for modification based on watermarks enhanced security. In this way four conditions are met as suggested by experimental results. To evaluate the performance, a number of experiments were performed, and for this reason different color images were used as host and watermark. The proposed scheme is compared with state-of-the-art watermarking techniques and achieved better results.","inCitations":["8afc9bc4e4cba23e0ae2a42e772781bb6ea3f2fc"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"A novel blind color image watermarking technique based on singular value decomposition and principal component analysis","doi":"10.1109/INTECH.2016.7845031","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INTECH.2016.7845031","venue":"2016 Sixth International Conference on Innovative Computing Technology (INTECH)"}

It took almost 40 m.y., from earliest Valanginian to late Albian time, for Africa and South America to separate, as South America rotated clockwise relative to Africa about a pole located in northeast Brazil. Rifting mechanism and continental deformation were controlled by the distance from the shifting pole of differential rotation. The rift was cut into two approximately equal portions by the Ponta Grossa dike swarm and associated volcanics that formed over the Parana‐Tristan da Cunha hot spot. South of the dike swarm continental, breakup was fast and characterized by intense volcanic activity (seaward dipping reflectors). In this area, a euxinic sea formed by Aptian time over the oceanic crust. To the north of the dike swarm, continental breakup was slower, and a northward-tapering rift valley lying deep below sea level formed over extended continental crust. This depression was flooded catastrophically by sea water in late Aptian time, depositing a 2000-m-thick salt body. The oil fields constituting the South Atlantic Megatrend occur either within the salt basin, both above and below the salt, or near the pole of differential rotation in transtensional inland rifts that contain no salt. The opening of the Atlantic divided this megatrend into segments that now alternate between the Brazilian and African margins: an oil-producing segment on one margin is faced by a relatively sterile segment on the other. This distribution may result from alternating polarity of rifting by simple shear. Oil richness, defined here as the volume of original reserves per unit length of a segment, increases along the megatrend with distance from the pole of relative rotation. Far from the pole, as in the Lower Congo and especially in the Campos Basin where the rift is wide, the rifted continental crust extends far offshore, oil richness is high, and the largest petroleum accumulations occur offshore.","inCitations":["37f6e06f911d9849bad0a67aac3400554e61fd19","498f1f71880c1c2359766fdea13dd21d31591edf","0b4e284e0b80a6599ef8041a8e77043b8c8f329b"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"AAPG Memoir 73, Chapter 6: Habitat of Petroleum Along the South Atlantic Margins","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

This paper presents results of a developmental program focused on the use of a liquid-sorbent/membrane-contactor (LSMC) system for removal of CO2 and water vapor from air. In this system, air from the spacecraft cabin atmosphere is circulated through one side of a hollow-fiber membrane contactor. On the other side of the membrane contactor is flowed a liquid sorbent, which absorbs the CO2 and water vapor from the feed air. The liquid sorbent is then heated to desorb the CO2 and water vapor. The CO2 is subsequently removed from the system as a concentrated gas stream, whereas the water vapor is condensed, producing a water stream. A breadboard system based on this technology was designed and constructed. Tests showed that the LSMC breadboard system can produce a CO2 stream and a liquid-water stream. Details are presented on the operation of the system, as well as the effects on performance of variations in feed conditions.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Operation of a breadboard liquid-sorbent/membrane-contactor system for removing carbon dioxide and water vapor from air","doi":"10.4271/921321","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.4271/921321","venue":""}

And the SAR ADC could be considered as the suitable choice. The SAR ADC consumes low power due to its simple structure. Moreover, SAR ADC is scalable with the CMOS technology scaling since most parts of the architecture apart from the comparator are digital. Since the comparator, the key building blocks of SAR ADCs, is one of the biggest power consumers, its design must be carefully done in order to optimize the power consumption without a degradation in the performance of the SAR ADC. The design of comparator based on sense amplifier for SAR ADC is provided in this paper. A dynamic latched comparator with PMOSFETS differential inputs is first proposed, which has been verified by the experiments. Then a two-stage dynamic latched comparator with PMOSFETS differential inputs and complementary regenerative output latch is also investigated, which has improved performances.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Sense Amplifier Based Comparator Design for SAR ADC","doi":"10.1109/IMCEC46724.2019.8983883","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IMCEC46724.2019.8983883","venue":"2019 IEEE 3rd Advanced Information Management, Communicates, Electronic and Automation Control Conference (IMCEC)"}

Stimulation of D(1)-like receptors with SKF 38393 attenuated NHE activity in WKY cells (IC(50)=151 nM), but not in SHR cells. Stimulation of D(2)-like receptors with quinerolane (IC(50)=120 nM) attenuated NHE activity in SHR cells, but not in WKY cells. Forskolin was equipotent in SHR and WKY cells in inhibiting NHE activity. The effect of SKF 38393 was abolished by overnight treatment of WKY cells with cholera toxin (CTX, 500 ng ml(-1)), but not with pertussis toxin (PTX, 100 ng ml(-1)). The effect of quinerolane (1 microm) was abolished by overnight treatment of SHR cells with PTX, but not with CTX. The D(3) receptor agonist 7-OH-DPAT (IC(50)=0.8 microM) attenuated NHE activity in SHR cells only. This effect was abolished by S-sulpiride and by overnight treatment with PTX. The D(4) receptor agonist RBI 257 did not affect NHE activity. The 7-OH-DPAT inhibited NHE activity in freshly isolated renal proximal tubules from 4- and 12-week-old SHR and 12-week-old WKY, but not in freshly isolated renal proximal tubules from 4-week-old WKY. It is concluded that D(3) receptors coupled to a G(i/o) protein play a role in the handling of tubular Na(+), namely through inhibition of the NHE activity, this being of particular relevance in the SHR, which fail to respond to D(1)-like dopamine receptor stimulation.","inCitations":["4ef0d23a86ce4cc6b3221aad3b6c462e786a0d88","8c2a654a06b7be402e1d26f3a91ec814a657fef9","5e31f73559bd6b64a9ebe09f9c9f6e2864dd80e6","602493808405be0cc778aa3a3577768dc870a3e7","b7f3715426d5deb15563a55d41f34b7891c7c64a","8fb9305e5b4304ebb3c7b70a79878f64eb2a1772","ddfcef3eb5844a60496fffe8fbf7f36bc8625a30","70654212c3e817a89859ded845513d438cc4fc36","9441ee4cd371df12492819bfe9048e11deb4c5fc","12a889e6cf31fd26ac0dcdf5af897677015f9b3a","c57b1eb4dd7048383bcc9f0970b014e890c65604","7b2eb4dfec1790279e294aec99c52f826f808efb","023ce18559733bb0d3363760d9b4e725ee4b3226","423c0e9016122f4c4fa39ced827b8a5bd1701fa6","1fdd1f98a2004aea9500d1f789835ab0ef3230fa","9af50b68352538fca03953e9d82bab12d6c20e37","56e06d12e0cf09565693f2e9707c7319facfab7d"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Dopamine D3 receptor-mediated inhibition of Na+/H+ exchanger activity in normotensive and spontaneously hypertensive rat proximal tubular epithelial cells.","doi":"10.1038/sj.bjp.0705893","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1038/sj.bjp.0705893","venue":"British journal of pharmacology"}

Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the TGFB1 and VEGF genes have been associated with risk and progression of many cancers. In this study, we investigated the association between potentially functional SNPs of these two genes and risk of gastric cancer in a US population.MethodsThe risk associated with genotypes and haplotypes of four TGFB1 SNPs and four VEGF SNPs were determined by multivariate logistic regression analysis in 171 patients with gastric cancer and 353 cancer-free controls frequency-matched by age, sex and ethnicity.ResultsCompared with the VEGF-634GG genotype, the -634CG genotype and the combined -634CG+CC genotypes were associated with a significantly elevated risk of gastric cancer (adjusted OR = 1.88, 95% CI = 1.24-2.86 and adjusted OR = 1.56, 95% CI = 1.07-2.27, respectively). However, none of other TGFB1 and VEGF SNPs was associated with risk of gastric cancer.ConclusionOur data suggested that the VEGF-634G>C SNP may be a marker for susceptibility to gastric cancer, and this finding needs to be validated in larger studies.","inCitations":["ae15ef69e7b601d1e835f440272b6ce1ca86bbbc","d5507e41aef64874fc61278f8b30e6b7cf83e088","a22b49d8a7ebc61f2044f567675081255fc2a2e7","c888ea2546eed2a5942178350bc05d0594ce780f","b8ee8fac6f2f70a7c66b61ce919b846a2c8cb27e","f95b214c92c2b439f165d1a2af34458407503c9b","db28ab84a3aaabf49e1151602aec6be44873e626","679f06a63d4a350d1cb5f6f01b7197335a8cd59b","be732630697d52e0adf63f011fc65ebe069e2ca2","d31dd13a15ed93197c273b563fce0d433cc00cd8","a09c0de9bb52750b7394c5636f1db545b2ebaf64","dcd4f1f7ca064fe010068e429cb1c194bd090baa","af9c5dfce7dc9ffc0475e79c207e32694a73e023","35bc6e509fcfbe0a85a75a6398d35eb127ba7b84","b296cf78f19845beeb10d81edf56c4fadc01cbb5","bf05d6d6b26ee37a214cf2c345c497cf90792305","42cd3c2096d2ed51cd9d6a66bdba4ddf56f0a36e","cd91faec1241eb2e6bccf48af76b0efd00fa69c0","6bc5e5abf9b05e45e92b0c9665ec9bd53917231f","5bb93e440f2c099e97add5e58782c5f271c700be","83a732dc4652e712b861bfa514e41cc743d07cf1","e3595c4c50bf99d656d0bf9eb932e36a4180418d","767cf725d03aad274930e97d2afa7359107de390","22b4e2028c546d4e665b25cdb6058285dc0f8fe1","b483fffdbec8dbc15ddc5e5f470aafaadd1e0d77","bfc4a7a6bdc3872ea1d8704aed4421bd39148e89","668fa5e7b64253b442c60369840d66bfaa349a9b"],"pdfUrls":["http://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/pmc/2c/a3/1471-230X-9-77.PMC2771032.pdf"],"title":"The VEGF -634G>C promoter polymorphism is associated with risk of gastric cancer","doi":"10.1186/1471-230X-9-77","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-230X-9-77","venue":"BMC gastroenterology"}

A first leafing through the pages causes a reader to think it is a text book on theoretical mathematics: it is replete with charts, schedules, diagrams and tables. These indicate the great amount of thought and research that went into the production. It is a thorough and detailed study. But the result of the extensive use of charts is to make reading it slow going at times. The work is not an analysis of the substance of the cases submitted or acted upon by the Court. The authors' goal is \"to discern exactly what the Court has done, how countries relate to it, and ultimately what role it can be expected to play.\" The study is approached from several viewpoints. One is of the underuse of the Court and proposals for stepping up its activities. The second approach is through a statistical analysis of the matters before the Court. The next look is at the relationship of the states in the international community to the Court. And in a further analysis the authors suggest a method for predicting the future use of the Court under certain conditions. In April, 1970, during a major foreign policy address, the then Secretary of State, William P. Rogers, spoke of breathing \"new life into the neglected, in fact moribund, International Court of Justice.\" He suggested that the United States seek to include in future international treaties a provision for accepting the jurisdiction of the Court. He further proposed submitting various disputes to the Court. But, as the tables in this book indicate, that policy statement of 1970 must have been placed in a deep freeze.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://scholar.smu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3245&context=til"],"title":"Book reviews","doi":"10.1007/BF00993801","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/BF00993801","venue":""}

Since energy costs are significant in an apartment building mainly for heating, cooling, and lighting, it is very important to identify energy consumption patterns in the building. In addition, energy consumption in a dwelling is also closely related to the household’s operating costs for the life of the apartment. Therefore, it is very important that residents of apartments consider energy consumption and use patterns to minimize the operating costs of the apartment. To determine energy consumption patterns in apartment buildings, this study collected utility data from the owners of 614 apartments to include natural gas, electricity, and water consumption from January 2010 to December 2010. The number of users in each apartment and the orientation of the building was also recorded. The apartments are located in the Walbae district in Daegu, South Korea and have been occupied since August 2008. The study found that February is the lowest month of water consumption and August is the highest. The highest month of natural gas use is January, 1,038.7% higher than the lowest gas consumption in July. August is the month with the highest consumption of electricity, 62.6% higher than the lowest consumption in May.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"아파트 居住者의 에너지使用規模와 패턴에 관한 硏究","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

This reality is exaggerated by the immutable, irreducible factor of space, which greatly favors China in any potential conflict between the United States and China. This will force the combatant commander to create more combat time by increasing Taiwan's ability and will to withstand force during phases zero and one, and by allocating forces required to counter missile and submarine warfare threats posed by the PRC. This will allow the United States to apply asymmetric force in a deliberate rather than reactionary manner, decreasing the risk of escalation with a nuclear-armed adversary, and improving the odds of resolving the conflict successfully. Such a strategy will enhance deterrence and maintain the status quo in accordance with U.S. policy.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"A successful deterrence against a coercive attempt by China to reunify Taiwan must be defeated in phases zero and one.","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

There were three different volumes (large, medium and small) in which the hand tracker operated. Each volume represented cockpit space in which hand tracker movements correlated to cursor movements on the screen. Two aiding techniques were referred to as contact aiding and proximity aiding. Contact aiding consisted of a color shade change to the target when the cursor penetrated the target volume. Proximity aiding consisted of an algorithm that selected the target closest to the cursor and thus changed its color shade. Two target densities, high (16 targets) and low (8 targets), were used. Speed and accuracy were measured in the designation of targets using a hand tracker. Results showed that proximity aiding in the medium volume space yielded the best performance.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"The Use of Aiding Techniques and Varying Depth Volumes to Designate Targets in 3-D Space","doi":"10.1177/154193129403800102","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1177/154193129403800102","venue":""}

In this study we used a static, driving-related IB paradigm to investigate how experts allocate attention and filter information when driving. We demonstrated that expert drivers were better than non-expert drivers in selectively filtering important and unimportant information in driving scenarios. The results are central in understanding how expert drivers allocate attention when driving, and have implications for driver training programs. Background Attentional set theory in IB suggests that we can tune our attention to search for specific information in our environment that is relevant to the task at hand, and is one of the several possible mechanisms through which IB occurs (Most et al, 2005). Thus, attention can be considered as a ‘filter’ that rejects unimportant information from the attentional system allowing important information to be attended. We hypothesised that expert drivers would have a more developed attentional filter for driving-related IB stimuli than non-experts because of their better situatioanl awareness (Underwoord et al, 2013) and hazard perception (Crundall et al, 2003), however this results in at least two predictions: Expert drivers either have a ’wider’ attentional filter in which they detect a greater range of driving-relaed objects in a simulated driving scenario, or they have a more ’focal’ filter in which they are more likely to detect more relevant objects in driving scenarios. Method Expert drivers (Paramedics, N = 150) received considerable systematic training in driving. The nonexpert drivers (N = 196) consisted of normal drivers who did not drive as part of their profession. The groups differed in general experience measures, but there was no difference in age, or safety measures such as fines or collisions. Participants were required to make safety judgements on briefly flashed photos of driving scenarios. After a sequence of 7 scenarios, a ‘critical’ scenario was presented which contained an additional object: either a child standing, a child running, an adult standing, a garbage bin, or a stroller, each one located on the median strip to the right (Pammer et al, 2012; 2015). After the critical trial, participants were asked whether they could identify the additional object on the side of the road from a series of plausible objects. If expert drivers have a wider attentional window, we would expect them to be better at detecting all objects compared to non-experts. However if expert drivers have a more ’focal’ attentional window, then we would expect them to detect objects of greater relevance compared with non-experts. Extended Abstract Pammer et al. Proceedings of the 2017 Australasian Road Safety Conference 10 – 12 October, Perth, Australia Figure 1. Rates of Inattentional Blindness for expert and non-expert drivers Results and conclusions IB is indicated by the number of people who fail to detect the additional object in the critical trial. The results indicate that while both experts and non-expert drivers detected the high threat stimuli such as the stroller and child running, the experts were better at detecting the mid-range threat stimuli χ2 (2, N = 160) = 5.2, p = .01 (, but also demonstrated a clear ability to reject unimportant information, as no experts noticed a garbage bin on the side of the road (Figure 1) χ2 (1, N = 66) = 7.6, p = .006. This result implicates a more ‘focal’ attentional filter for expert drivers. Moreover, such attentional filtering may occur at a fast, pre-conscious level, as we also demonstrated that experts who reported not seeing the unexpected object in the critical trial, were nevertheless more likely to accurately choose the additional object in a subsequent forced-choice task. These results are important in understanding the role of attentional allocation when driving.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://acrs.org.au/files/papers/arsc/2017/Pammer_00102_EA.pdf"],"title":"Inattentional Blindness in Expert Drivers","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

More studies considering multiple factors should be conducted to promote rational decision making when planning projects and allocating budget for new educational facilities and to improve the current budget allocation system that uses a univariate model for estimating construction cost. This study is conducted to derive a construction cost estimation model for BTL educational facilities, especially for new elementary, middle and high school buildings.

The number of blisters saturates at about 5 × 105/cm2. Further bombardment induces pores on the surface, which are considered to be associated with injected gas-release. These pores erode the surface, and, eventually, get rid of the previously formed blisters. These observations are qualitatively explained by amorphization on the germanium surface. The amorphization make the range of energetic ions shorter, and, at the same time, the injected ions more mobile due to the volume expansion. The observed depths of blisters are more than 1 μm, namely, more than three times larger than the projected range of ions due to Schi⊘tt.

The Practice-Based Opportunities for Weight Reduction (POWER) trial conducted at Johns Hopkins University (MD, USA) compared the effectiveness of two behavioral weight-loss programs to a self-directed control group over 24 months among obese adults with at least one cardiovascular disease risk factor. In contrast to traditional efficacy studies that often enrolled convenience popula tions, POWER enrolled obese patients from primary care clinics and delivered interventions that could potentially be integrated into routine medical care. As a comparative effectiveness trial, our findings should be directly applicable to rou tine medical care and should inform patients, healthcare providers and delivery systems of effective treatment options [2]. This article highlights lessons learned from the design and implementation of the POWER trial. Details of the study design have been published [3,4]. Participants were obese patients from one of six participating primary care clinics, who had at least one cardiovascular risk factor (hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, or diabetes), regular internet access and basic computer skills (i.e., the ability to enter data into a website and send/receive email). Participants were randomized to one of three groups: control condition, remote intervention and in-person intervention. The primary outcome was weight loss at 24 months after randomization. The two behavioral interventions were based on previous trials conducted by the Hopkins investigative team that demonstrated the efficacy of lifestyle interventions in achieving and maintaining weight loss and improving cardiovascular disease risk factors [5–8]. The group receiving in-person support was offered group sessions, individual sessions (telephonic and in-person) and web support. The group receiving remote support was provided telephonic sessions and web support with no face-to-face contact. These active intervention groups were compared with the self-directed control group. A summary of the intervention recommendations and contact schedule have been published [3,4]. PCPs provided general encouragement for intervention participation and reviewed a one-page report of the participant’s progress at regularly scheduled clinic visits for those in the active interventions. The main results have been published and a brief review follows [4]. Of the 415 randomized participants, 64% were women and 41% were African–American; mean (standard deviation) age was 54 (10.2) years, and mean (standard deviation) BMI was 36.6 (5.4) kg/m 2 .

Considering the complexity of different plant' spectral feature, the feature space was consisted of Normalized Different Vegetation Index (NDVI), Kanth-Thomas transformation (K-T transformation) and an optimal band combination. In order to enhance classification accuracy, a dual-weight support vector machine (SVM) classification model by weighting on different features and classes was proposed. The kernel function of this model was selected as wavelet which satisfied the practical situation better. During the experiment, training and validation data were ground survey points located by GPS. The results from this study indicated that the invasion of spartina alterniflora was serious and it kept expanding to the southern. Furthermore, the method proposed in this paper could get higher detection accuracy than the traditional methods and was suitable for the small-sample experiment. Consequently, using this approach could provide timely analytical data for the time and space distribution change of the Salt Marsh Vegetation in intertidal zones, meanwhile the results will provide sound scientific basis for carrying out some proper management and control of Spartina alterniflora.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"The spatio-temporal dynamic analysis of salt marsh vegetation in Chongming Dongtan based on remote sensing data","doi":"10.1109/EORSA.2014.6927848","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EORSA.2014.6927848","venue":"2014 Third International Workshop on Earth Observation and Remote Sensing Applications (EORSA)"}

We examined CMI by measuring lymphoproliferative response induced in response to stimulation with the above three antigens following two doses of measles, mumps, and rubella-II (MMR-II) vaccine in a randomly selected, population-based cohort of healthy children. We determined if a correlative and predictive intraclass relationship exists between CMI to the three components of MMR-II. We detected positive lymphoproliferative responses to measles, mumps, and rubella vaccines. Mumps vaccine used as an antigen had the highest median stimulation index followed by measles and rubella vaccines. The overall intraclass correlation value for lymphoproliferative response to measles, mumps, and rubella using Pearson's correlation was 0.61 (95% confidence interval = 0.56, 0.66). We observed a significant pairwise association to individual vaccine components between subjects in the upper and lower 10th percentile of immune response. This study demonstrates recall CMI post-MMR-II vaccination with significant intraclass correlation among the CMI responses to the three vaccine components.","inCitations":["deea346c9d3ff29c7ad4e8950a8f53a9403f3e4d","bd8f083d2515b4dad6a1f7cf2bb11e2248818721","24eddd8f88f59bac6523b9a8e33a4118ba993407","b9d66ce5842a1ef8d2e96a7893e04bc289a6d9b6","5b0e1f7328d7f7fb8c3841c471a501472ec90330","2d997dad79990dddf6fcff7cb87cfabfc379aa7b","204b39bd556097f6c03da4b429694cdc21316735","b449d1cc0758f938874b19f0a0b5a2b53e0ff42b"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Correlates of lymphoproliferative responses to measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) virus vaccines following MMR-II vaccination in healthy children.","doi":"10.1016/j.clim.2004.12.010","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clim.2004.12.010","venue":"Clinical immunology"}

The relation of space and matter cannot be created if the amount of information of space and matter cannot maintain the relationship of space and matter. In space-matter model solely through the use of space waves, we can express spatial distance, time and energy.

Ninety-three patients, 69% unruptured and 31% ruptured, were treated with Orbit Galaxy coils for their anterior (80%) or posterior (20%) circulation saccular cerebral aneurysm. Primary treatment with Orbit Galaxy coils occurred in 84% of patients with an initial 100% occlusion rate of 65% while 16% had Galaxy coils placed into a \"secondary\" recurrent lesion. The overall incidence of recurrence was 26% with a mean interval of 7 months. Retreatment for recurrence was needed in 20 patients (22%). The mortality rate was 0%. A 2% incidence of rebleed was observed; each was after a secondary treatment. The morbidity of the treatment was low with 1% having a modified Rankin score greater than 3.

The elimination of gubernatorial elections in Russia in late 2004 provides a unique opportunity to study public reaction to policies that replaced democratically elected regional leaders with Kremlin appointees, thereby further concentrating power in the hands of the central state while simultaneously reducing the level of democratic accountability in Russian politics. Using a 2007 survey of 1500 Russians, it is possible to observe how key measures of public opinion and regime support were influenced by the elimination of gubernatorial elections. Because the timeline of gubernatorial appointments was determined exogenously based on the expiration of elected incumbent governors' terms, by 2007 some regions had governors who still held electoral mandates, while others had Kremlin appointees with no electoral mandate.

For this investigation the existing two-dimensional wind tunnel model, PaLASTra, which offers a quasi-uniform streamwise pressure gradient, was modified to reduce the size of the flow separation region at its trailing edge. The streamwise temperature distribution and the location of laminar–turbulent transition were measured by means of temperature-sensitive paint (TSP) with a higher accuracy than attained in earlier measurements. It was found that for the modified PaLASTra model the transition Reynolds number ($$Re_{\\text {tr}}$$Retr) exhibits a linear dependence on the pressure gradient, characterized by $$H_{12}$$H12. Due to this linear relation it was possible to quantify the so-called ‘unit Reynolds number effect’, which is an increase of $$Re_{\\text {tr}}$$Retr with $$Re_1$$Re1. By a systematic variation of M, $$Re_1$$Re1 and $$H_{12}$$H12 in combination with a spectral analysis of freestream disturbances, a stabilizing effect of compressibility on boundary layer transition, as predicted by linear stability theory, was detected (‘Mach number effect’). Furthermore, two expressions were derived which can be used to calculate the transition Reynolds number as a function of the amplitude of total pressure fluctuations, $$Re_1$$Re1 and $$H_{12}$$H12. To determine critical N-factors, the measured transition locations were correlated with amplification rates, calculated by incompressible and compressible linear stability theory. By taking into account the spectral level of total pressure fluctuations at the frequency of the most amplified Tollmien–Schlichting wave at transition location, the scatter in the determined critical N-factors was reduced. Furthermore, the receptivity coefficients dependence on incidence angle of acoustic waves was used to correct the determined critical N-factors. Thereby, a found dependency of the determined critical N-factors on $$H_{12}$$H12 decreased, leading to an average critical N-factor of about 9.5 with a standard deviation of $$\\sigma \\approx 0.8$$σ≈0.8.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Unit Reynolds number, Mach number and pressure gradient effects on laminar–turbulent transition in two-dimensional boundary layers","doi":"10.1007/s00348-018-2538-8","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00348-018-2538-8","venue":""}

Infants were examined at regular intervals until 15 months of age, and complications from BCG were documented. An investigation of BCG vaccination practices was conducted.\n\n\nRESULTS\nMild or moderate complications occurred among 16 of 166 (9.6%) infants born to HIV-1 seronegative mothers compared with 4 of 13 HIV-1-infected infants (30.8%, P = .04) and 10 of 75 (13.3%, P = .39) uninfected infants born to HIV-1-infected mothers. No serious complications were noted. The outbreak of complications was associated with administration of 2.0 to 2.5 times the recommended dose of BCG vaccine.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThis and five other cohort studies indicate that there may be a small increased risk of complications following BCG vaccination among HIV-1-infected children, but the reactions are usually mild and the risk does not outweigh the benefits of BCG vaccination in populations at high risk of tuberculosis during infancy and childhood.","inCitations":["f6cf0f563075466b1b7596320ab755c84b61d71e","816adc2a430ac9c6484c7a05f987c2242a6639dd","9e1d6c4fc48a0fe37d07576b93808b010898efb9","214abe1cc72b04bf69b7f9aadd7a3ff98a42cfc5","bc66c46eb8d3671a28b4964fd105a0a3aa172295","5b7a66820b569e334b410f0e81955d16b4713ab5","786e4d5acdff56735c85ecf405b4e42ac235779e","d91aedaa9ed0f0271776260e4f59a58742274c3c","b2b128f416b7a0c3927a4531e7896a91472f108c","877af6a2cb293728e1906af4e184b9b9d2b669cb","c2d6eccab763c9011c603da9bdde2acbe4246953","55f76d9f8657e67f521a237061109dd2abd2eb2f","fe7a487e699d83c34dae116722edffb940a27f77","fd85275a6735f01d7d70d8c56a774fa4f7d5be22","c02ab99251e04f65543239b9cb237b6e63b7ef8d","7ebda6ebfc1d827dfab06fef70eb08b9e41fe817","f0614f6ed41a986bbcda76650abdc08692074a31","ac3560e79e418b46e77bffb3909ffe22f86a8021","0a4dd1cdd5c946cbb022f16fd25f14a9c33dc748","b88fa0d43f4886c2b0ece509b0119aad24bf937d","4776d4214b4e88b88ca1d1fe110d2f61867b06ac","4e4496e0b5b62283ddd579f8617b700e68c945b3","93e718a25dcdf1569946baaf64355c550471a92b","dbad431106db1d246a76f3457bff201549afab35","cf9acccbbf7045794c396c4b73c8ea984544fa01","d506bb399a1588ca2b206ad1953496e31ab2d35a","cadff5dca02c8912d8a4a65f3e4bab1df6f5eee8","5cefea13fd6a49ed77ee29f6a033fc4711871391","d3ec50b2d08fe6d5b98c4aa0f392d43b1b0de19d","43bc4460e1c6cbf73fdec5cfb3577f6a0ab18bf0","193e3dd9c38d3c2bbd774d8e2ec6252675be9228","672fbe2ecac8e81df58d08a4a80e75f1a18c88e0","8488e27729c2e729e6fb67117eef38d204a19936","bd9406457267991ecebb8bfa7e588e3ffea7f4c9","a22b1a2fb09fe23df2166f7b48f9793802322cf7","f0fe4694c96043bd150a3ceb93025931a593405b","1a88dc5671fd5f8ad2d1e249a4f2c2b5caff2e65","952253205f11331afdf1b2ee193a51f4c323ecaa","790b0d73fe0b55b28bf0a270b4be91cd9f97a5d5","cb637207796bdd15a127bbbbdd406974ea235f9e"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Bacillus Calmette-Guérin complications in children born to HIV-1-infected women with a review of the literature.","doi":"","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"Pediatrics"}
