Simultaneous determination of the concentrations of H 2 O 2 , NH 3 and black carbon (BC) in both condensed and interstitial phases with high time resolution showed that the three species undergo different behaviour in the presence of a mixture of ice crystals and supercooled droplets. Both H 2 O 2 and NH 3 are efficiently scavenged by growing ice crystals, whereas BC stayed predominantly in the interstitial phase. In addition, the scavenging of H 2 O 2 is driven by co-condensation with water vapour onto ice crystals while NH 3 uptake into the ice phase is more efficient than co-condensation alone. The high solubility of NH 4 + in the ice could explain this result. Finally, it appears that the H 2 O 2 –SO 2 reaction is very slow in the ice phase with respect to the liquid phase. Our results are directly applicable for clouds undergoing limited riming.","inCitations":["7ea58b14686331fde139e3680af82f3185a37c80","3f64b0326ecc4d5dc8425e6257272e711cf2e0b7","737c4a53919c8bfb82288a783145989abe43ec24","f6eb1401ebf7118292ae22a6ce19278598c556eb","ffde1c26b25930022813ff819ed93755c8cd8fc3","73855cb27e1d62e65494b9de1f6be8d292fe0b51","997ac4cda0665ac8b2cb928208cce2f06474de6c"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Behaviour of H2O2, NH3, and black carbon in mixed-phase clouds during CIME","doi":"10.1016/S0169-8095(01)00097-7","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/S0169-8095%2801%2900097-7","venue":""}

Availability of combined localization and functional assays would greatly improve cell biology and drug modulation studies for this transporter. Here we demonstrate that an N-terminally GFP-tagged version of the protein (GFP-G2) can be used to directly monitor ABCG2 expression, dimerization, localization and function in living cells. GFP-G2 is fully functional when tested for drug-stimulated ATPase activity, vesicular transport assay, subcellular localization or cell surface epitope conformational changes. By measuring both GFP and Hoechst 33342 dye fluorescence in HEK-293 cells, we provide evidence that a real-time transport assay can be reliably applied to identify ABCG2 substrates, transport modulators, as well as to monitor the cellular functions of this multidrug transporter protein. This approach also avoids the need of cloning, drug selection or other further separation or characterization of the transgene-expressing cells.","inCitations":["99254813036e2b5a844043d45efabe3b20003f5c","e8762d5a4d0cc75e223c074387d3b05d107efc71","45ee4e505d00a0b2b7c60c6a8ca149abcc4ea03c","03336ce79d2d8e1bf0ae1710a176a4aaaa512d2f","cca1a3095963edf2eeaa2e7930b1f346abd16fb5","f0e4571d5790089dfd6945daadc037104a88cb2e","d7050f5d018c907d98072379ad21ce420eca1343","ef37598a9b16b9303e12b8096210d12592e6ede0","72fca07feffd65b2c78facb691a3212c8faab4e1","84dab605a96fb7ae109d96e08201fdbf38279e3c","f2fea8bef5855c00c5760272432d6dbf6f134752"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Combined localization and real-time functional studies using a GFP-tagged ABCG2 multidrug transporter.","doi":"10.1016/j.bbrc.2007.12.172","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2007.12.172","venue":"Biochemical and biophysical research communications"}

In disinfectant efficacy testing, as well as in research, choosing the best reactor to use is important because different laboratory reactors impart unique characteristics in the biofilm that influence everything from biofilm architecture and protein regulation to the response of biofilm bacteria to disinfection. In this dissertation, three laboratory reactors and associated standard operating protocols were developed to provide a reliable, standardized assessment of disinfectant efficacy against biofilm bacteria that grow: 1) in a moderate to high fluid shear environment, 2) in hot tubs, and 3) in swimming pools. The reactors and protocols were then evaluated for the statistical characteristics of repeatability, ruggedness, and responsiveness, required criteria for the standardization of a method. In the CDC biofilm reactor (CBR), biofilm was engineered to possess the characteristics of a field biofilm grown under moderate to high fluid shear. The laboratory hot tub and swimming pool reactors were each engineered to generate a field-relevant biofilm by modeling the physiochemical and biological characteristics present in such recreational water. Testing demonstrated that the CBR and laboratory hot tub system were repeatable and rugged. The hot tub and swimming pool systems were responsive to disinfectant type and concentration. This research demonstrated the feasibility of incorporating relevant engineering design into practical laboratory methods used to evaluate disinfectant efficacy.","inCitations":["c45f54e5b15d384e0f66a7024f89e5886af9fbf5","347de77cf5813f25ef1ed04ed791ce8d826dbeff","9e12ac52a135869255c494d160115d1334700a72"],"pdfUrls":["http://scholarworks.montana.edu/xmlui/bitstream/handle/1/1347/GoeresD0506.pdf?sequence=1"],"title":"Design of Model Reactor Systems for Evaluating Disinfectants against Biofilm Bacteria","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Furthermore, many students failed the class multiple times. Since 2013, a computer system called ALEKS has been used to teach the course and, along with some additional interventions, on Albuquerque/Main campus success rates for MATH 101 have increased to roughly 80% and MATH 102 to about 70%. This thesis provides a strategy to identify those 20-30% as-risk students most likely to need additional support to succeed. By combining data from the UNM Registrar (Grades, ACT scores, and demographics), NM county-level poverty data, and response-level ALEKS assessment and practice metrics, we developed a statistical model that uses data from the first week of class and vi predicts with almost certainty (1% overall error) whether a student will pass in that semester. This represents another potentially important incremental improvement to a series of successes in redesigning Intermediate Algebra at UNM.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://digitalrepository.unm.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1119&context=math_etds","https://digitalrepository.unm.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1119&context=math_etds&httpsredir=1&referer="],"title":"Which factors influence student success in Intermediate Algebra, MATH 101-102-103?","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

The prevailing influence of some institutions such as the University of Cambridge is obvious, while, unexpectedly, research fostered by technical problems met during the Second World War, also had a strong influence on the selection of projects. A recurring theme is a specific interest in mathematical problems posed by the theory of elasticity, no doubt a consequence of the enduring influence of past “elasticians” of great mathematical dexterity among whom A.E.H. Love must be singled out. A clear-cut emphasis was placed on problems dealing with the existence of field singularities such as happens with cracks, dislocations, and other material defects. Here great names are those of A.A. Griffith, Ian Sneddon, “Jock” Eshelby, and A.N. Stroh. Simultaneously, an “immoderate” but fruitful taste for problems of elastic wave propagation with applications in both mechanics and geophysics was demonstrated and still remains a subject of attraction. Furthermore, a geometrical approach to defect theory was proposed by a group around Bruce Bilby, while Rodney Hill produced among the most powerful results in plasticity theory and homogenisation procedure. Still it is the mathematical dexterity and elegance allied to a deep physical insight that best characterizes most of these works.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"The British School of Elasticity, Plasticity and Defects: Applied Mathematics","doi":"10.1007/978-94-007-6353-1_6","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-94-007-6353-1_6","venue":""}

Twenty-seven individuals who reported previous physician visits for their arthritis, spoke English, were Toronto residents, and were receptive to in-depth interviews were approached by the cohort telephone interviewer to discuss their experiences with prescribed painkillers for OA. Semistructured face-to-face interviews were conducted by a qualitative researcher in participants' homes.\n\n\nRESULTS\nNineteen adults (10 women, 9 men) ages 67-92 years were interviewed for 1-3 hours. Participants varied in their socioeconomic status and education levels. Most had comorbidities, such as heart disease and diabetes, for which they were also being treated. Findings indicated that adherence to pain medication differed from that of other prescribed medications. Participants were reluctant to take painkillers, and when they did, they generally took them at a lower dose or frequency than prescribed. This behavior did not reflect their recommendations for others, who they expected to be treated appropriately for pain and to adhere to pain medication. Perceptions and attitudes to pain played an integral role in participants' adherence to painkillers. Despite obvious physical limitations, participants minimized their pain and claimed to have a high pain tolerance.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThese findings suggest that reevaluation of the prescription of pain medication for OA is warranted and that the effectiveness of pain management in OA needs to account for adherence behavior in older adults.","inCitations":["5cc95387c3cb9247133f26b88a3c31b756a176ca","10609b8a3eef74a9d4dc7331bb7835946626fbb5","59b0d8b93600fee8eb331c4c7a03a03bddb82dec","9d49ebceaac91773cec2674f8d43b6718545a355","4fb33ddc0eff1ceedfc19fc5a9f14be4c094bae1","6914e7f2828a8f9cedbe1376164aa51a5eab91e1","d31b7753b33f92f9c5302c7f5a3a2f51f95e5c2b","5478d870bb64479935a2830d9f2aa573ad51c7d5","8b8ec08e2ca9828c6e19a4a3d030fb5a5378f76d","a17e514bdd0929054aa78167f0af85fe81d8dbef","b4c27758683c21cd9c279b8e81045d86ea83cc5a","9ca4af49ddf4220956c9c680e5dbf6896d0f637f","75b3c219db99cb1980795313ab6b75d9e84c5065","701e7b1723e5247c465345e759fa45c73aad85dc","9c683f1b670efca1ffc5973365368c0415696aeb","1a8e7ddf30ea1e3d734b80ed277375260ccfe818","9c22e3b17787378176c9b4780b45c302e613dc7e","9e00b7ec7d8aaaee76108bc1f9978d1eba64b85e","470a87b9de5627ff86e9204782436f58452494e4","3ae65082a6ab208e55599e5b0d4f1075f6d0b34c","7cbec25341c238582dfe4ecdafe616344f248cfd","dec44ade21fd85ddcb9e076d86e2444dac3071c8","66a2551743514b8cd256f36aa61840ebfdb27014","0e2d61d77f5ec90f94be713084ff8eb0d89585a6","bce38889fdba28328ddd7bff9b4b2cca94dec200","6c51c3df0bd45881e79f8178afa3e1a7f20d3572","b3e25e53f86f06c60816373b9159dada3d37f75a","f91ffb0191d57c90a758fd81ad309c7bd98a5503","98c9ff7e523ed9e92d97b4354bbdc2d342d1bfe7","bceb5f281039664a8ff593ce59988db4080fff4d","78ff40a5eca0205a902187ef77b37276ee7f4acd","d3b924e1edd3ec75e788d9c84a0b2105f8631e73","e10c68142926a51ce63523fc89d3fb1b1f60d22e","bd0f20257a3b63cc04314f5cd2f69c5ab4a74151","15c2b33ea1084a20ca69c6123fa4b03f7a4720eb","3a63f587d07f7617612c2ac36330bab0d5d5c9a9","9cc5582a528047f1682ec89b2f25f6fbaf3d62aa","1ec1fc2626541b9acffc17c2da7e5ede84bf02c1","af30bf34623a0de022d4c8fa3ad374ab15bc265a","6cf4ef13d1a82aa30cfbea455a7d85aeb92fb117","7a6768988c13ed5302c53684dbe6805a794a89c5","a39dce47eef3ee64f76037b86b2975b96672a8fc","9bcd939c484c9fd5922eeaf5aeadbe8203359be8","54481e5d94075d4159e9bdd2eac05fc71696a91c","50eeec0e126b170efea32324e49d7b795ff24213","7b575b90888af1101f73e4da856740c7acaf7919","35be59e464c4b51c24ec5aba409d18c852aa9766","4032b1ccfa9d99eb61b582e9c160bb729aaaf381","d6fd74fb06665a465ef71161b2f6f38cbf20c6ae","dd23d1843805494ea63c315d2e2c6b3888f586e6","556252a7fb424ef76cd0b0c69755890062a6b101","f2494bdcf73d9530f726bd9c87ae699f44bcd0ce","e258234ba6babfbc4d47ae33de735c28f5a61ccf","ea77b1c6f4a88a00e83efd9b3ee49e3defbbef0e","f8df2797da4d1a2d6ab084569ff1f2ad8dfa6d01","957224debe8e65cc71a8b345e61b4eb26bc004d4","a089a8aa799841cb62b6f7e399bfcdd959cfc433","85007c713c2f761b74594c1c47b493cd5bf2d2c5","a38e07b6535f764627ec747444551b33ceb42e1c","6c537b5626fc17add49c022bbdab2130a287acf5","d08e481e44536c615a0a86388277aa16a579e7fa","e0d9354388da32b224a13963fb35f64a46d15605","ae8fc9eaf4ef172ab8e08070ace644018fd4144b","0792efa4c0092d4cf09481c8ce002d7d5456f82c","56c0b3f21b7169da399ea17eb46d977e423ffde1","d5a4540bbd5382644751bd4a36dfced69d96d154","400f0dec212b17b7d6df0682c31f1d8ac244e8af","cac1629ca80c7e88a33d627af8a8ebfe122fa156","8a62d13377838af599fd505260e5381c0463dac2","4d04134ad42a04db14b017e3cc9842f5aca753bd","de7e4a068a851eb6d63e5b258a711bee2872f583","fceab0dc21dbb9ded0fe9840295c46fa4516e38e","4bde76b4444715f91ee4da2b86ae803d552999d2","4bc6b64b4d28da9905a13b0db0a5d3b3fa204703","6f343cee0c8debe3a7a4290fea5f487ac88acbcd","0f6f67e0f8ccbcb649c69d70114d93209c4ec995","ace82bd68e919a3c8bf3bf138430b48343f00a82","6dc0555420019dc07798727e742cb68d18f25bb0","e64df4dba5a38f33dd84d3ccaca17df20583ced2","fe91c3cc6b5be6f86500dd831ee4d1fde71b6741","9683da30392c457ecaad59e336c6418ca87d38d9","9845385954cf777ce71f4f60be007ffcd94f0816","f4b8234aab2ee8cf0760e878f30557c019247cb1"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"How \"bad\" does the pain have to be?

Although the semiconducting (2H) and metallic (1T) phases are known to be stable in thin-film MoTe2, semiconducting 2H-MoS2 is locally converted into metallic 1T-MoS2 through chemical lithiation. In this paper, we describe the observation of the 2H, 1T, and 1T' phases coexisting in Li-treated MoS2, which result in unusual transport phenomena. Although multiphase MoS2 shows no transistor-gating response, the channel resistance decreases in proportion to the temperature, similar to the behavior of a typical semiconductor. Transmission electron microscopy images clearly show that the 1T and 1T' phases are randomly distributed and intervened with 2H-MoS2, which is referred to as the 1T and 1T' puddling phenomenon. The resistance curve fits well with 2D-variable range-hopping transport behavior, where electrons hop over 1T domains that are bounded by semiconducting 2H phases. However, near 30 K, electrons hop over charge puddles. The large temperature coefficient of resistance (TCR) of multiphase MoS2, -2.0 × 10(-2) K(-1) at 300 K, allows for efficient IR detection at room temperature by means of the photothermal effect.","inCitations":["0d747bdd913683e4ead2d3b8f0645688729a5bef","97640b14a9fa570fa6bcf5c8f2ba6e58ba330c5d","b3c7dccb92a7baf2a98cd055aaa3c527c7279655","9ca071170fbbde2cf134625027d7a14ee4307cb4","38d8d6ed61ebb599bafa9ef8fa32ccff622ff124","c7f803e51388840e28ad3d15737f02c043f3daac","3a38a1e0fd25c36f4ff0a30dbdc5c3078c074aea","37ebee03777a6b15a68d94a54c84b7fc9154f65a","66ed58263e03c709edd19ec18a7422107ee06e31","1f8ca8ba46a5e042e6572f24aa056ee9da9a766f","ef8898db129c220418082b1889eec1109e568321"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Electrical Transport Properties of Polymorphic MoS2.","doi":"10.1021/acsnano.6b02267","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1021/acsnano.6b02267","venue":"ACS nano"}

Because the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (Stat3) transcription factor regulates multiple genes important to angiogenesis, we sought to determine whether Stat3 expression is related to vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression and microvessel density (MVD) in gastric cancer and whether these factors predict survival in gastric cancer patients.\n\n\nEXPERIMENTAL DESIGN\nThe expression of Stat3 and VEGF was determined by immunohistochemistry using archival tissues from 86 cases of resected human gastric cancer and confirmed by Western blot analysis. Angiogenic phenotype was determined by CD34 staining and microvessel counting.\n\n\nRESULTS\nStat3 expression correlated with VEGF expression and MVD. In univariate survival analyses, Stat3 expression (P = 0.013) and MVD (P = 0.036) were associated with inferior survival. However, when Stat3 expression, VEGF expression, MVD, stage, completeness of resection, Lauren's histologic classification, and age were entered into a Cox proportional hazards model, only strong Stat3 expression (P = 0.049) and advanced stage (P < 0.01) were independently prognostic of poor survival. Furthermore, genetically enforced alterations of activated Stat3 expression led to altered VEGF expression and angiogenic potential in human gastric cancer cells.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nDysregulated Stat3 activation may play an important role in VEGF overexpression and elevated angiogenic phenotype in gastric cancer and contribute to gastric cancer development and progression.","inCitations":["9e2a32d92661e6f136757e32d4f532f193094e40","86ef7916403de5e6d8c50aa5e9ad5b58ea7b88ee","93d96e126fbd1a4edffd33a8575930894d647293","7fec4791a857be5318a24bb45c2c6c66aceeee61","355415b7a3d1b84928e2d471b803edffc67a959a","6ffb4ec2302c4f74e4934945fcf1376c9954235d","bd323641e74f82ad484b1a990711ed141e28446e","c2c1195ab71d1cd807b1369fb704e1ae7752ca03","4b7c19a6812808ec3f850fc7d09b8b0dcb1b56e7","ae0f1796a3b162b5c74cb8fd9c7cc34dda92ed10","34f5e592aab3b620518dabbce027b10acfb37ed3","756f955d30e753b3009aa7eb5e767628d9102c0b","7ce8fade7bbe5dc09a75d43cdf45395e162bba9e","bf797efcb4774ae5c74e67368b2d719cc4b523c6","d063597fb7d1111470c3daf00169e4452ad33faa","bd57d8880a1627aa4ac3c10d81c78292b6af694d","2d800118d275f1811c7ee2698886a40d105659f2","b968fb039c60cef78599072112ba81f754db8aeb","5839ac8b84aec0ff9218e0e459e2d054569aa1a8","1b360dedba8bc1afc1697a7be94a32663a049711","21be3b82671cc32d5e4dd9aa33e66c1b581b731a","4d93d3feb4bfeeaee4900602e1bf5d90a386ba19","66e3dc0ea95779081cdc87df487ec3f42c31e87e","bff9e748cbc912859689869c696d4da2f2c3f90d","1e87fca10b0fd1e5c2a21dc01c5d25e2afaf698c","960ce0d05653e1c79d6a40ed07af21cc13a62176","6a7e4f2f0200a26e8b95839f7c87452dca1cf37a","6612dfd63a01cb6980e5cc829e48e47f2eaa8bfe","2f96b676ba7f0d2696f9945da1940ab7711814b6","8c7dfa19485ebf9cdd591d16e8ffe3e43941b849","8f758c89e54cdc598acc5c7fe5ad225afeae2e07","a9298e23f022b1acedec57726604763c28e22e36","5a81918837fade210128c92bc2d16c7f550761e6","1ad0ea3f1c457206d3bb0c7780bc83519c7625d2","223beab00f787cbf05cd2772ada07c6b2f49a782","a2e6447a68312dd74fb1ef53476ff4a6f6d2c42d","d14b09a57f044a1605ec1b4160da28c88bca478d","9bfc48ca017bcd708805b469fda8311a47f09954","da4e0909c87e6dc80e98f82c1115b92f116c9cfa","ece465807c23d42d275ffcce19ef06dd0b300f50","e0a6aa4a686abe2dc64049e747e49ee7f64d2aa2","5aad3b4de47a2777fa3bc6c651363faf06aa6a1c","b68c8b53e23cf38c91fe8d69fb6e34cdefa21948","6970b10f1a79a5ef7963b215fe4ed1456548b7fb","478746fccaad8261842d431111eafc1ac15d4a88","b10ec076bc93b0d0c9e05acfcd1fd8db0533d67a","8beab33e8b2270a55ee1b2d3d40cb6a577622e8d","a6f9dd956e16b8419b723032be13c71b58b9d275","51f5d772e770b49eb08b505df95fdfd2a4749d17","c515ae8fae16cfc9bd4112306495a81ffa0c7204","35b4ca0048d62651e9ab0e00787aa9c9c5ced757","df06e46853616e98e57bacaaf202d7cf283538ce","608b4a5338170187a048d84809446abbd954ff3d","0db7727696fee41b3e2b089f6e578d7c23beaaf4","544d0f4929e37b402ff061cade8ef127fdcb36b3","e55e1d4ed09a4e29bf5ec7e2f1a4c946487dc00f","fc03e57f861dc78edd5e0fffde34ddb1fa2abc3e","9002e1bac36b29faf5927b941b46869d9bc9b2bd","ece490d231b7ca9af39d847507a41f33bad2a8e3","c3108de817627a7761ae03cb873dd0ff67ef87ec","f9a495c71a8c6eba072b3d567400215ae031ca77","82534e532ddfb585e27f45c75813de374282562d","6c2204376672ba446bc1a937a09e1bd341abfae9","10fda7b75ff1e38559bf87af358cb99fa0226d59","da6b8341cb75f1b0e9709f94fc422a42c4dde88e","086977414a9e7f7aca5b7813eb9604ca4f8079f3","e0a2ba7820cc2314e73dc7a0b50ef117c9003ed2","94fae34a1c790c9e960fed9054f19ea23414a940","39ce64901f0ea821e56b78cdc0e6aa59f74b9052","20d550bd79286ed11f3526e976b85727e9badd0f","a4f510926ad54fd3c91cb3314515836e2167784a","37ad0b5d76f273cc0fbee31aef843a65ac156c08","435cf57219c3c666dc20922ce9ac0cf4c73ceb00","d23823c003d221a460025ca32f69e1349c7e029e","1395154c68d83548088a24afae7fee77c5850b63","d5b8bd232d3b143d4cbe8a26aebc5e73d3d403e6","c541c5a8c2a8d59f3c0be1ca0c07b92a115c2055","4051174fca59b32627f9fa5be7c14f0806461e83","f603eee840765f30f3dc7bdaa45326b91e83aab4","55cf15d4784792a10c5a6c596d0f773b8d7777df","99278479f216e1baf9c226662e8eeeba11dcc5fc","a6e2da4ff8a89ed7da0c8af6b29fcea076d27597","249f5c7b1959953690b0b4d68eee65f6d4cbcb37","d9b97bdc7363090469557f9cfab1c11df7c5d7ce","6eb5a01fdfba468002425cb3806441f0c03a46d2","78f516be69c304043c59499a3bad812875fbc684","a2b94ddd688419b2e2d9203d102671baae686070","6a67161dc05cddc335349423c5cec30ca9e7c30e","187b001408c7773cac9deb6d9416cf40b3db07ee","e37b3aac67813ec3699ff190de399807756f01d7","a654a4325373127a4a9df94690e3ae849216d2dc","142700337d46b096209e0deeda1f2d9e4169ff7c"],"pdfUrls":["http://clincancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/clincanres/11/4/1386.full.pdf"],"title":"Expression of activated signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 predicts expression of vascular endothelial growth factor in and angiogenic phenotype of human gastric cancer.","doi":"10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-04-0487","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-04-0487","venue":"Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research"}

Amplification of the MYCN oncogene, which occurs in ~25% of patients, is the most reliable marker of metastatic disease and predicts poor outcome. Recent findings show MYCN reprograms NB cell metabolism to promote glycolysis and shunting of glutamate into the TCA cycle, causing dependence on increased levels of TCA intermediates, such as a-KG and succinate. Allelic loss of the short arm of chromosome 1, (1p36) is associated with the vast majority of MYCN amplified NB, and a candidate tumor suppressor gene (TSG) in this region is succinate dehydrogenase subunit B, SDHB , which encodes a core component of the succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) complex, converting succinate to fumarate. We show that MYCN -amplified NB cells, with 1p deletion, have reduced SDHB protein levels and elevated succinate levels. Thus, we are now testing a model that the combined loss of SDH activity with MYCN amplification causes dramatic accumulation of cytosolic succinate, which in turn stabilizes HIF1α to accelerate NB pathogenesis in vivo . To test this model, we have generated mutations in zebrafish sdhb to determine if 1) it is normally required for sympathetic neuron differentiation and 2) cooperates with MYCN to accelerate zebrafish NB in vivo (Zhu et. al, Cancer Cell, 2012). As HIF1a is predicted to be upregulated in SDH-deficient cells, as well as MYCN -amplified NB, we have also generated stable HIF1α transgenic zebrafish lines to directly determine if HIF1α alone is sufficient to drive NB or cooperates with MYCN to accelerate it. The results from our studies of sdhb loss and hif1 α gain on peripheral sympathetic nervous system development and NB formation in vivo will be discussed as well as potential therapeutic approaches to target SDH/MYCN -dependent tumors.

Nous avons evalue l’impact d’un questionnaire remis aux prescripteurs et encourageant la reevaluation du traitement au 4 e jour, associe ou non a l’avis du referent antibiotique. Materiels et methodes Les prescriptions de 13 antibiotiques administres par voie intraveineuse dans les services de medecine et chirurgie ont ete identifiees a partir d’une requete informatisee et inclues prospectivement. Trois types de reevaluation ont ete compares pendant des periodes consecutives de 8 semaines : 1) groupe controle (reevaluation sans questionnaire ni avis) ; 2) groupe questionnaire (reevaluation sans avis associe) ; 3) groupe questionnaire suivi d’un avis. Le critere de jugement principal etait le pourcentage de modifications du traitement au 4 e jour (incluant : arret du traitement ou utilisation d’un antibiotique a spectre plus etroit ou relais oral ou diminution de la duree prevue de traitement). Resultats 402 prescriptions ont ete analysees. Au 4 e jour, 48,9 % des prescriptions du groupe controle ont ete modifiees. 50 % des prescripteurs du groupe questionnaire ont repondu qu’ils envisageaient de modifier le traitement, et ils l’ont effectivement realise dans 54,5 % des cas ( p  = 0,42). Le taux de modifications du traitement etait significativement plus eleve dans le groupe questionnaire + avis (66,2 % ; p  = 0,014). L’arret precoce du traitement en l’absence de documentation d’une infection bacterienne etait significativement plus eleve dans ce meme groupe ( p  0,0001).

Among the migratory species with known population trends, 88% (22 of 25 species) show population declines, and seven have been listed as threatened or Near Threatened in the IUCN Red List. The decline of migratory shorebirds is related to the deterioration of stopping sites (including staging and stopping sites) in the Yellow Sea, including loss of intertidal wetlands, spread of invasive smooth cordgrass Spartina alterniflora on intertidal flats, an increase in pollution, and an increase in human disturbance. We review research concerning shorebird migration through the Yellow Sea and highlight key research activities required for the conservation of shorebirds in the region. These activities include: confirming the population consequences of loss of stopping sites, estimating migration timing and numbers of shorebirds at stopping sites, determining the differing abilities of species to use alternative habitats, understanding intra- and interspecific differences in the use of stopping sites, maintaining and expanding surveys on shorebirds and habitat condition, and identifying threats to shorebirds beyond habitat loss by reclamation. The information generated by these research activities is required for the design and selection of effective conservation actions to reverse the decline in shorebird populations.","inCitations":["36075922106a00b744d2549a43199353f5187d0b","47da5b1d63b5471b242eba27899c3a6e21d48142","c2ed9e1d23412895d5318dfc42b25bba1c901410","2fefe72775df1cc7a4b9011ff3027da683a2452a","12a01c101a7ceed042d324f6577c9312007ea61b","b1002a3558a805797d2c5e66915c3e1e9b603980","278969a73ba59ef3009c307295f8d4d244a02527","da27e364e947ab6812c5f2b6059fe1a3d2c2be36","aace9eacedd5c21b24234a6e5cf0c06a95e20f70","628b9e388da4a948c0df83ee3d49d481194550dc","020250d8b6bda6a500caf801f0f89781f16ed7d1","a3d9ebb33932d72c35cd77e85d55fd1225ab507f","deb602c529fd564dc0f2c60e910130ff2f02d404","874252a2400fc7ed5ea711fd8e32b577717e12ef","4977203261899c07fcfe9847edd31c79ab00c8de","84b6fab64d6ac678572f5da06e73f17632423a0d","c5547057d61b14f2ca1c7ffe87caf54de2f5fe26","9130076631bc4f1be673993854baba0d24550241","c18ffd451eb20a41061f82c98b803badcf62b1f7","bd2de9ba13602b7190296e82f3c25b7c43f6fb79","3f1e421223fdbb92318c5c0acc5f872440a95900","5acfca6fe2ed42f3124fb3a3b7c4e89f379e5d44","d9fbf9fa04fcb42025fbb3b696cc1e152157fc93","75f659b0ff3f8d48314f31f9e89f1fdb3a9d3815","1a22e893ce02db244adccac142fe361869a631b0","e97a75073db648782d85810e0f32de7a8b9ba821"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Key research issues concerning the conservation of migratory shorebirds in the Yellow Sea region","doi":"10.1017/S0959270914000380","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1017/S0959270914000380","venue":""}

The effect is discussed theoretically from the standpoint of second order perturbation theory and the stochastic Liouville equation of Kubo, both for the case where the chemical shift is the main interaction. Experimental investigations of decamethylferrocene (resulting in Ea=3.3 kcal/mole) and hexamethyl benzene support the predicted trends. A five site jump model is used to interpret the results for decamethyl ferrocene, while the interpretation of the hexamethyl‐ benzene data is obfuscated by the presence of a chemical shift inequivalency presumably caused by a distortion of the aromatic ring above the phase transition (Tc=116 K).","inCitations":["667ca7ed2d5d633917f84353f61b6666875b7d18","a68e759cce557797f22f1c271632a0a2e0f4ed63","3b5948b32d6ca71861c2bccee3bf852c35f7a22a","d399f45caacf4e105e11dc26a2bfdd09fb0a1b5d","346bccebde5af7632e00f6fc8cf3c01a7ee762b3","cfb94881c7142609e8518ef2a1e23e71bd2ae838","4642da08526d56a0d0a19aee10ec273b38676867","e7c66452caee2bf463131809dcc19b295d643fbf","deb4e1c16da6b1e323f3663135cbc81fb6ce016b","3f715b60a6a3e3fb3189d8f529c25fdf0f9633e9","19b691fda74e641cdc0994679e9036ce0dfa1d0e","3937cb1fd1dc5e95a13dc7b34acfb3c49d2cb196","a12eb92cc9013103aacda6e5a77201aa9f103a28","edc1cae244db50c7d22ba72d9ba1f6a498851d73","12932aa0462da9e5ffdedbedc36c4766e563fbc8","b73ae5c007eb933905f5704a5e3d274d3d192777","a5a5d66fcefc941322dcbb11539fd7e91dcbf35d","fef58ada67324b1cfce9c9e21e3b92b8c0479f70","9e15a9608b5d1ed61c430f39514acdf507d838c4"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Slow molecular motion detected in the NMR spectra of rotating solids","doi":"10.1063/1.440491","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1063/1.440491","venue":""}

To realize cucurbit[8]uril (CB[8])-based SBCPs generating artificial light-harvesting in water, finely color-tuned supramolecular homopolymers (SHPs) comprising CB[8] host and different cyanostilbene guests (named as B, G, Y, and R) emitting blue, green, yellow, and red fluorescence are first synthesized and characterized, respectively. Light-harvesting SBCPs with mixed guest emitters are then simply produced by mixing blue and red-emitting SHPs according to the dynamic host–guest exchange interaction. The light-harvesting SBCPs show highly efficient energy transfer from B (donor D) to R (acceptor A) attributed to the D/A proximity and parallel orientation of their transition dipoles secured in the block copolymer structure. It is comprehensively shown that cyanostilbene/CB[8]-based fluorescent SBCPs represent a novel and fascinating class of eco-friendly artificial light-harvesting system.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Light‐Harvesting Fluorescent Supramolecular Block Copolymers Based on Cyanostilbene Derivatives and Cucurbit[8]urils in Aqueous Solution","doi":"10.1002/adfm.201705141","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1002/adfm.201705141","venue":""}

These findings differ markedly from the observations made in rats by other investigators.

The effect of the inquiline Philides anthonomoides Champion, 1906 (Coleoptera: Curculionidae, Conoderinae) on gall morphology is also described. Most Neotropical conoderines are associated with tree falls and are assumed to be wood-borers. This represents the first report of the species acting as an inquiline in galls.

In the Do stage, we conducted a tabletop exercise (TTX) for a tsunami disaster using a real-time tsunami prediction system. In the Check stage, we ran a workshop on an after-action review of the TTX. In the Action stage, we applied the SOPs of the real-time tsunami prediction system to the tsunami disaster management plan and conducted a second TTX. As a result, we verified the information provided by a real-time tsunami prediction system to apply the system to a tsunami disaster management plan for real municipalities.

Because urban areas with the least available access to adequate amounts of nutritious or affordable food options (or \"food deserts\") also tend to be the most deprived areas within a city, it is hypothesized that food access and foodborne illness risk are linked. However, the complexity of tracking numbers and sources of gastrointestinal (GI) illnesses often leads researchers to speculate about reasons for disproportionate rates of pathogen outbreaks among demographic groups. This study explores the suitability of existing data to examine associations between food deserts and the spatial distribution of GI illnesses in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. A spatial analysis by using GIS software methodology was used to identify and map food retail outlets and accessibility, as well as GI illness outbreaks and sales of antidiarrhea, antinausea, and rehydration products (used as a proxy for GI cases) within the city, based on available data. Statistical analysis of the maps shows no statistical relationship between location, access to food outlets, and rates of GI illness. The analysis points to shortfalls and gaps in the existing data, which leaves us unable to draw conclusions either supporting or refuting our hypothesis. This article includes recommendations to improve the current system of illness reporting and to continue to refine the definition and process of mapping food access issues. A more comprehensive set of data would enable municipalities to more easily identify groups most at risk, depending on exposures and the type of pathogen, and reduce the occurrence of foodborne disease.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Exploring the relationship between food access and foodborne illness by using spatial analysis.","doi":"10.4315/0362-028X.JFP-13-027","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.4315/0362-028X.JFP-13-027","venue":"Journal of food protection"}

Findings imply firms are employing knowledge management practices strategically to improve their competitive performance. Knowledge sharing, creation, generation and maintenance are perceived as important to a firm's productivity. Firms also found that knowledge management practices effectively improved worker skills and knowledge and suggested that more knowledge management practices would be employed due to loss of key personnel.","inCitations":["6d54f6b70fda1ec6847f0659224d380809c44b16","c59091dd7b3d20f56b145503d5a607a354f11271","18aa0ae881bbdb5641766c4f5422d270164f1038","6e284680c977fb4f20392509aa65b4016aecf96c","1c1b3af1670121a2daf09ec7fb6b5a85fbb858be","7fb008468d8d5c57ed9876a368830cb12f864b48","5f85500f4959f9cf029952721592df825659a014","9f679e440eb1afbeeb2285de96e550dd1abd0aeb","9c8cdd204043197e3b92fe759fc42454192b7c42","31193d6972178d97cc471acfdf4e61f52010d9e8","c6c7901731cc1331412aed2bf0fceda9d44cb660","b90c5364b99c81f4fc1793ed43cb9ab38d10519e","9de4dede246651ea103e42472db26d1cd42db07d"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Are we Managing our Knowledge?

On the basis of external and cranio-dental measurements taken from adult specimens, the following conclusions can be drawn: there is notable sexual dimorphism, males being larger than females and there is no clear pattern of variation associated with bioclimatic, latitudinal or altitudinal zonation. DNA sequence analyses were based on 1078 nucleotides of the mt cytochrome b (cyt b) gene (n=20) and 351 nucleotides of the 5′ hypervariable region of the D-loop (n=50). A high haplotype diversity within M. jugularis (cyt b=0.995, D-loop=1.00) was combined with an absence of genetic structure. Analysis of molecular variance showed no significant grouping of haplotypes with latitude, longitude or altitude. D-loop diversity and neutrality analyses indicate that the Malagasy samples form a single population, which has been expanding for between 120,884 and 230,588 years. According to the MaxEnt potential distribution model, M. jugularis is predicted to occur ubiquitously across most of southern and central Madagascar, accounting for the observed genetic and morphological homogeneity of populations; observed specimen records north of 18°S occur in unsuitable habitats and may have arisen from recent expansion into synanthropic roosts. This species has a broad geographic distribution across much of Madagascar, encompassing the elevational range from 70 to 1750 m. The vast majority of known roosting sites are in human built structures, which are often shared with different species of Molossidae.","inCitations":["d4d533c2ce808eb858b076d394edf446bb2562bd","2791893a8f2cbdd4715e56acb508bb857561039d","c0973c410f9373c2c633e94e729c345918b9684b","868cbf957e3be57d6cb11974cedb384b8dbf7172","fd924aff326f5a620b6f682aff5717b722c16046","bf6c72021de87335b1395c83a35394b465b59ec3"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Morphological and genetic variation in Mormopterus jugularis (Chiroptera: Molossidae) in different bioclimatic regions of Madagascar with natural history notes","doi":"10.1515/MAMM.2009.032","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1515/MAMM.2009.032","venue":""}

It is characterized by local or generalized edematous erythema with itching and increased blood flow and vascular permeability. Individual urticaria lesions typically last less than 24 h (usually less than 12 h), but new lesions may appear and resolve sporadically. Since the diagnosis is usually made based on the history and clinical appearance of the lesions, skin biopsy is not necessarily performed, but it is recommended for evaluating patients with refractory eruptions or suspicion of other diseases exhibiting urticaria-like lesions. The histopathological features of urticaria are dermal edema and perivascular and interstitial inflammatory cell infiltration, and there is only minimal change in the epidermis. Cellular infiltrates are composed of lymphocytes, neutrophils, and eosinophils.Recent findingsIn our 64 patients with urticaria, severe edema was found in 48 cases (75%) with mixed cellular infiltration in 45 (70%), lymphocytic infiltration in 17 (27%), and neutrophilic infiltration in 2 cases (3%). Perivascular infiltration was found in 35 cases (55%), and the others were classified into the perivascular and interstitial infiltration type. Subcutaneous cellular infiltration has been shown to be associated with poor treatment response.SummaryIn this review, we summarize the histopathological findings of urticaria and its differential diagnosis. Evaluation of the histopathological features may provide further insight into the mechanism of urticaria and potentially provide valuable information to develop more effective treatments.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Histopathology of Urticaria","doi":"10.1007/s40521-017-0144-2","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s40521-017-0144-2","venue":"Current Treatment Options in Allergy"}

Published in 1947 when the aging champ faced a waning career and mounting bills, My Life Story might be dismissed as a facile attempt to exploit his fame in order to raise sorely needed cash. Louis also received \"editorial aid\" from Chester Washington and Haskell Cohen, two sportswriters whose involvement might cast the value of the boxer's official story into doubt, insofar as they compromise the authenticity of the narrative. Moreover, the book resulting from this collaboration hews closely to the banal conventions of celeb- rity autobiography, portraying Louis as ordinary and modest, hard- working but lucky. This up-by-the-jockstrap tale of the boxer's rise from poverty to prominence disappointed reviewers in both the mainstream and black press who expected something \"that would reveal a little more of the man\" (Dulles 36). One reviewer grumbled, \"there is hardly a passage that couldn't have been written by a well-informed sports writer assigned to ghost the story of Joe Louis\" (My Life Story 99); another complained that My Life Story neglected the boxer's \"early years—a portion of Joe's life which might make fresh and interesting reading\" (Fay B14); another regretted that the book \"falls short of giving an adequate picture of the man who did this fighting\" (Martin 15); and yet another panned the book as \"trite and unrevealing to the","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Joe Louis's Talking Fists: The Auto/Biopolitics of My Life Story","doi":"10.1093/alh/ajr001","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1093/alh%2Fajr001","venue":""}

Data collected on ICU admission, day 2, 3, and 4 were analysed in 61 patients. Thromboelastometry made it possible to identify patients with a normal (group 1), hypercoagulable (group 2), or hypocoagulable (group 3) pattern. The best accuracy of thromboelastometry parameters as potential indices of coagulation abnormalities was yielded by the clot formation time and maximum clot firmness. The mortality rate was low in group 1(16%) and the presence of abnormalities, indicating either a hyper or hypocoagulation pattern, was associated with significantly higher mortality (42 and 39% respectively; P = 0.05). In group 1, baseline endotoxin activity was low [0.22 endotoxin activity units (EAU), 0.15–0.43] and did not change significantly during the observation period. In group 2, baseline endotoxin activity was elevated (0.52 EAU (0.39–0.62)) and remained high on day 2, 3, and 4. In group 3, baseline endotoxin activity was elevated (0.56 EAU (0.28–0.80)) and similarly to group 2, remained high on day 2, 3, and 4. The presence of coagulation disorders indicates a high-risk subpopulation of critically ill patients as reflected in significantly higher mortality rates and increased endotoxin activity.","inCitations":["85fbc29f6d497bce60b7da1fcbd78ce1aca25fa8","c1347d3bc17714b605f9c077cc559e6562cfed07","b150cfd48f726d228935e6b8c5ecc5f8ca56f3eb","c2193275e0b3f32a82cc33d5396a50b5452f080d","09967c8c436c7020e2ce0adf0b540f2076cb8208"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Coagulation abnormalities identified by thromboelastometry in patients with severe sepsis: the relationship to endotoxemia and mortality","doi":"10.1097/MBC.0000000000000572","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1097/MBC.0000000000000572","venue":"Blood coagulation & fibrinolysis : an international journal in haemostasis and thrombosis"}

We report the case of right ventricular perforation by a ventricular fixation lead in 61 years old man detected more than two months after implantation. Radiology and echocardiography can confirm the perforation by revealing progression of the lead beyond the cardiac silhouette or indirectly visualizing the presence of pericardial effusion.

The paper explores specific modeling approaches for tying together the real world one is controlling, the devices one is using to monitor and control that environment, analysis processing and temporal relationships between discrete events within the environment and related control functions. Part of the study is the application of the proposed techniques to a hypothetical air traffic control system; with examples of traditional process control environments as well.<<ETX>>","inCitations":["c725b7584bf8daea8a4b6e60cdf94e7e9dc53729"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Real-time environment modeling","doi":"10.1109/RTA.1993.263099","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RTA.1993.263099","venue":"[1993] Proceedings of the IEEE Workshop on Real-Time Applications"}

Recently, the development of power generation facilities, food production facilities, and the natural resources in the Japanese EEZ are planned. As the worldwide supply and demand of mineral resources are being tight, the technology for effective exploitation and the use of mineral resources in the EEZ will become a key for sustainable development in the Japanese industry. Prior to development of marine mineral resources, it is necessary to evaluate its environmental impact on the water column and seafloor of ocean. However, the environmental evaluation method for open ocean has not been established yet. Then, we are developing the environmental impact prediction model for the seafloor mineral resources development in deep sea area with the consideration of benthic organisms. This model can estimate the impacts of excavating seafloor and sedimentation of particles on marine organisms using an ecosystem model. In addition, the influence of an increase in dissolved oxygen on bacteria caused by the discharging of oxygen-rich waste water at seafloor, is considered in this model. The ecosystem in this model includes benthic organisms, zooplankton, bacteria, particulate organic matter and dissolved oxygen as the components. This paper introduces the calculation case using the prototype model.Copyright © 2013 by ASME","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"A Numerical Model for Environmental Impact on Marine Organisms for Seafloor Resources Development","doi":"10.1115/OMAE2013-10571","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1115/OMAE2013-10571","venue":""}

Климатске промјене су све видљивије у посљедњих неколико деценија, а њихов негативан утицај се осјети и у Републици Српској. Оне директно погађају привредне гране као што су водопривреда, хидроенергетика, пољопривреда, а посљедично се доводи у проблем производња хране и енергије. Имајући у виду да најзначајнији дио стакленичких гасова потиче од изгарања фосилних горива намеће се као нужност производња енергије из обновљивих извора, чија је економска исплативост неспорна. Већа улагања у производњу соларне енергије, вјетропаркова и осталих обновљивих извора би значајно смањило загађење, што је огроман допринос заштити глобалне климе. Истовремено, то је чиста и економична енергија која доприноси развоју привреде. Све учесталије суше и поплаве представљају велики удар на БДП наше земље. У Републици Српској је у току подизање неколико система заштите од поплава на критичним тачкама из којих су кренуле велике поплаве 2010. и 2014. године. Чишћење канала и прокопавање нових би додатно смањило могућности за поплаву, а ријешио би се и проблем наводњавања пољопривредног земљишта у функцији интензивирања привредних активности. Све ово би допринијело ефикаснијем привређивању, те кроз економски и еколошки развој и побољшању квалитета живота на нашим просторима.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://www.ekonbiz.ues.rs.ba/ojs/article/download/110/115.pdf"],"title":"INVESTMENTS AND MITIGATING THE NEGATIVE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE IN THE FUNCTIONS OF DEVELOPING OF THE REPUBLIC OF SRPSKA AND BiH","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}
