The role of pharmacists in this multidisciplinary team is to assist in the standardization of insulin therapy via selection of appropriate insulin treatment protocols, participate in formulary management of insulin products, and contribute to the development of order sets and policies and procedures to minimize the risk of medication errors and misadventures. In addition, pharmacists can provide guidelines or treatment recommendations in special situations, such as those involving patients receiving enteral or parenteral nutrition or high-dose corticosteroids and the transition from i.v. to subcutaneous insulin therapy. Education of patients and providers is another key role for pharmacists. Nurses are important allies in the effort to ensure safe insulin use, as they are at the bedside of patients administering and adjusting insulin therapy. Recommendations are provided for the safe and effective use of insulin for the treatment of inpatient hyperglycemia.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nPharmacists are an integral part of the multidisciplinary team ensuring the safe and effective implementation of inpatient hyperglycemic control and insulin usage.","inCitations":["a798ef14792b27315265c24f0fda22b7620bc81a","9f90c8229075a9c9a2a9ac362edbae33ad5bfde6","826df955bd8b754bd75c842f15021ae901ad833f","2cc5e73916f741f2614dd6fbf0f1e910d7df026f"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Ensuring optimal insulin utilization in the hospital setting: role of the pharmacist.","doi":"10.2146/ajhp100172","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.2146/ajhp100172","venue":"American journal of health-system pharmacy : AJHP : official journal of the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists"}

26S proteasome complex, leaving neurons susceptible to accelerated and impaired protein homeostasis, thereby contributing to the pathogenesis of neurodegeneration. Strategies aimed at enhancing the function of the 26S proteasome via phosphorylation of key subunit epitopes have been effective in reducing protein aggregates in mouse models of disease. We discuss how phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitors and G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR)-targeted drugs might be considered as candidate therapeutics, acting on second messenger signal transduction. The range of candidates might address the need for region-, cell-, or even cellular compartment-specific modulation. Given the array of clinical and experimental drugs targeting cAMP/cGMP signaling, we propose that proteasome activators targeting secondary messengers might be exploited as novel agents for the treatment or prevention of some neurodegenerative diseases.","inCitations":["ef26e6c089c1ca72c7db145b3f917973bcec36ad","87357a22ca81d9d04a8542035b268b8ba94292f7","e87c3c36dc90cde65dd65dfc0db469b68b0df018","505ca2ec4367f9b80f352d3e89a0664fb7edc21d","58fd9d2e9f755c8519255e11690d4c418cddc309","89704d0caeba654e8981a2ca835240b4b4fa3c1c","01bbf1f78b87c19d81c71f4c231acd72cbe3295f","7683af90fcdcb28e6962869abb2ca2f490ff29b1","42dc3af1cea0f355b5b6cac8bad06b44f639b35b","62c753db86488cd92db51533d7c5ac51d66ce46d","02d6ead9c50ccb68db51a4563621cc037c0f1511","b718af8146c4a3c8e750a0c73f0d22759df813f3","2ea331291aa2507680d409fa5b3d87e071859931","04b0e26e29389e1e51310346c22eb927f1a50e6e"],"pdfUrls":["https://www.psp.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Myeku_Duff2017.pdf"],"title":"Targeting the 26S Proteasome To Protect Against Proteotoxic Diseases.","doi":"10.1016/j.molmed.2017.11.006","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molmed.2017.11.006","venue":"Trends in molecular medicine"}

As the complexity and quantity of data being handled grows, it is imperative that efficient and reliable means be provided for: (a) data communication, between different organisations or on one computer system; (b) data archiving and retrieval, so that the high cost of information may be protected; and (c) data access, to enable efficient computation using the information. Different data structure may be required for different purposes. The complexity of the data structure definition depends on the breadth of users and systems requiring access to the data. Computational data structures must be efficient, e.g. arrays in Fortran. Data structures for archival and retrieval purposes need to be sufficiently well defined that a change of computer environment is not hindered by the archived data. Data structures for communication are intermediate in complexity between the above. Database Management Systems provide a means for storing data so that it persists between individual applications. The major benefits of such systems are that DBMS's promote data sharing and impose standards so that the data can be easily converted into a form suitable for a particular requirement.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Database Management Systems for the Geosciences","doi":"10.1071/eg988038","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1071/eg988038","venue":""}

The Kenyan dairy industry is based mostly on smallholder milk production. The history of cooperative development in Kenya is tied closely to the aims of the Government’s rural development policy. Soon after Independence in 1963, Government was given wide-ranging powers in organizing farmer cooperatives to deliver the necessary services. The government’s aim was to use cooperatives as a tool to facilitate commercialization of Kenya’s smallholder farm sector. Currently, most of the running cooperatives are characterized by weak management capacities, inadequate capital base, and low economies of scale. This exploratory research reveals the effectiveness of the value chain system as a planning tool, on the performance of the selected producer-owned dairy groups. The paper identifies the value activities within the milk value chain and the cost drivers within the chain that contribute to competitive advantage. An in-depth analysis of how the value chain strategy has been used in the selected dairy groups, the impact on their performance, challenges faced and the specific areas that supporting partners are able to focus on within the dairy value chain are discussed. As a result of this research, a positive change in the livelihoods of the farmers was realized, as a result of maximizing the core value activities within the dairy chain. The core activities were the activities within the ‘’inbound stage’’ of the dairy value chain and which include; Provision of farm inputs, selection of good cattle breeds, provision of animal feeds and drugs and proper milk handling practices, this means training the dairy farmers on clean milk production, at the farm level. The study established the lack of knowledge by the farmers on how to handle milk especially at the milking stage, and poor hygiene of the milk jars used during the milking process. This affected the quality of milk as a result of bacteria that contaminates the milk, causing rejects at the collection points. With such improved business services to small farmers, it was established that small farmers’ transaction costs that are usually large relative to the size of their output, was greatly","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://erepository.uonbi.ac.ke:8080/xmlui/bitstream/handle/11295/61512/EFFECTIVENESS%20OF%20THE%20VALUE%20CHAIN%20SYSTEM%20IN%20THE%20OPERATIONS%20OF%20SELECTED%20PRODUCER-OWNED%20DAIRY%20GROUPS%20IN%20KENYA%5B1%5D.pdf;jsessionid=8536C5344CC8EE032A27B302ECC799B2?sequence=1"],"title":"Effectiveness of the Value Chain System in the Operations of Selected Producer-owned Dairy Groups in Kenya","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

RFA and EMR are known to be clinically effective but the effect on the mRNA expression of molecular markers of disease stage, which may inform the long term risk of progression to adenocarcinoma, is unknown. We compared the mRNA expression profile in pre-treatment BE tissues biopsies and post-treatment neo-squamous tissues from the same level to provide a surrogatemolecular estimate of treatment effect. Methods: Paired pre-treatment BE tissues and post-treatment neosquamous biopsies were obtained from 38 patients treated by RFA (20 patients (3 IMC (prior EMR), 5 HGD, 12 LGD) or EMR (18 patients, 6 IMC, 12 HGD). mRNA expression of 16 genes significantly associated with different BE stages was measured using a multiplex tandem RT-PCR method with preand post-treatment tissues assessed simultaneously. Distal esophageal tissues from 12 patients with no history of GERD or BE were used as normal controls. Results: Endoscopic therapy resulted in a highly significant change in median values towards the normal squamous mucosa expression profile for all 16 genes on unpaired analysis. This change remained significant for 12 genes by paired analysis (t test). The only significant treatment differences in pre-post mean difference in gene expression were greater changes for RFA compared to EMR for 5 genes. The neosquamous expression profile was significantly different to the normal control profile for 9 of 16 genes. Conclusions: Both RFA and EMR result in marked changes in mRNA expression, with replacement of the highly disordered Barrett's dysplasia or IMC expression profile with a more \"normal\" expression profile. The neosquamous mucosa was significantly different to the normal control squamous mucosa for most genes but the significance of this finding is uncertain and may reflect confounding factors.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Mo1916 Gene Expression Pre- and Post-Endoscopic RFA or EMR Treatment for Dysplastic Barrett's Esophagus or Intramucosal Adenocarcinoma","doi":"10.1016/S0016-5085(13)62568-8","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/S0016-5085%2813%2962568-8","venue":""}

In this scenario, wine producers that want to win competitors must definitely be market-oriented. For wine producers, to be competitive means to focus on strategic business decisions, to keep the brand in the market, to increase new consumer segments and to move towards a diversified production that points to research and innovation, looking constantly for quality. Communication is nowadays one of the main strengths of competitiveness and especially strategically-market-oriented wine producers, are aware of it. This paper has the objective to know how much Sicilian wine producers believe and invest, efforts and money, in communication strategies in order to understand how the Sicilian wine communicates to consumers. For the survey it was used a stratified with proportional allocation sampling. A proper questionnaire, with mostly closed answers and only few open answers (with unique interpretation), was submitted to a sample of Sicilian wine producers. Through the use of hierarchical Cluster Analysis it has been possible to know directions of Sicilian wine producers towards investment in communication and to obtain Sicilian wine producers’ homogeneous groups according to investment expenses and type communication tools. Moreover it was possible to identify the measures of similarities and dissimilarities of expense items for communication and find the ones preferred by producers.","inCitations":["3a478ca6553e6d99e8c56b798cc23d22f2a7e05e"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"La comunicazione : un valido strumento per la competitività delle aziende vinicole","doi":"10.3280/ECAG2010-002004","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.3280/ECAG2010-002004","venue":""}

Endocrinology and metabolism","paperAbstract":"To evaluate the effects of endurance training on the expression of monocarboxylate transporters (MCT) in human vastus lateralis muscle, we compared the amounts of MCT1 and MCT4 in total muscle preparations (MU) and sarcolemma-enriched (SL) and mitochondria-enriched (MI) fractions before and after training. To determine if changes in muscle lactate release and oxidation were associated with training-induced changes in MCT expression, we correlated band densities in Western blots to lactate kinetics determined in vivo. Nine weeks of leg cycle endurance training [75% peak oxygen consumption (VO(2 peak))] increased muscle citrate synthase activity (+75%, P < 0.05) and percentage of type I myosin heavy chain (+50%, P < 0.05); percentage of MU lactate dehydrogenase-5 (M4) isozyme decreased (-12%, P < 0.05). MCT1 was detected in SL and MI fractions, and MCT4 was localized to the SL. Muscle MCT1 contents were consistent among subjects both before and after training; in contrast, MCT4 contents showed large interindividual variations. MCT1 amounts significantly increased in MU, SL, and MI after training (+90%, +60%, and +78%, respectively), whereas SL but not MU MCT4 content increased after training (+47%, P < 0.05). Mitochondrial MCT1 content was negatively correlated to net leg lactate release at rest (r = -0.85, P < 0.02). Sarcolemmal MCT1 and MCT4 contents correlated positively to net leg lactate release at 5 min of exercise at 65% VO(2 peak) (r = 0.76, P < 0.03 and r = 0. 86, P < 0.01, respectively). Results support the conclusions that 1) endurance training increases expression of MCT1 in muscle because of insertion of MCT1 into both sarcolemmal and mitochondrial membranes, 2) training has

In order to provide quantification of the issue, we carried out a meta-analysis of the published data. We identified 4 case–control and 2 nested case–control studies, including a total of 5,396 B-NHL cases. We derived meta-analytic estimates using random-effects models, taking into account the correlation between estimates. The odds radio (OR) of HBV infection in B-NHL when compared with the control population was 2.98 [95 % confidence interval (CI) 2.30–3.86]. There was evidence of statistical heterogeneity among all included studies (I2 = 65 %, P = 0.01), which disappeared in the subgroup nested case–control studies (I2 = 0 %, P = 0.49). OR was 2.59 (95 % CI 2.03–3.30) in the random effect model, suggesting a higher prevalence of HBV carrier state in B-NHL than controls. This meta-analysis provides quantitative evidence of a favorable role of HBV infection on B-NHL risk, which needs to be confirmed by experimental and epidemiological studies.","inCitations":["d672bd17696558e5cddafac606cf6c4affad34c0","41b449511dedfa7688d669d6f8ee33cfdf3579ee","7a58b68a3284b4c95a6512d1ba1941a2b0c6f2eb","f64776a69665fbc50b6c180532a0d159a3d36187","22235b8b6f7fdc7a9be589d18cd5621bc3e56170","2caf0cae34b4e9680eaab2296aedeb4e01dc8e2f","cc29810a193ad5645ed3a213541c9b73332b3f86","00ea771e5644ad635861f0e18b6b705324e2cd5c","840d375a08c7ed2fbe56da8ee15e4f44360b8372"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Association between infection of hepatitis B virus and onset risk of B-cell non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma: a systematic review and a meta-analysis","doi":"10.1007/s12032-014-0084-7","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s12032-014-0084-7","venue":"Medical Oncology"}

Flowing arterial blood creates a cavity that remains in continuity with the normal vessel and becomes lined by inflammatory cells and fibroblasts and is eventually replaced by fibrous scar tissue. The incidence of the radial artery pseudoaneurysms is very low and is generally associated with complications such as repeated punctures at the same site of the artery. The color Duplex examination provides a reliable diagnosis. Surgical treatment is recommended. Objective: We describe our approach to a radial artery pseudoaneurysm and discuss the treatment options that are available. * Residente de primer año de Angiología y Cirugía Vascular, Hospital Lic.

The main aim of the paper is to extend the knowledge on the meaning of taijiquan from the Chen family, for the people in Poland who prefer this kind of physical activity. Material & methods: The study was conducted on 110 persons aged 20-90 (the average age amounted to 45.2 years), including 72 males and 38 females who practise taijiquan in various centres in Poland. The authors used their own straw poll, composed of 12 questions (6 open-ended questions and 6 closed-ended ones), and the specification. Results: The main motive of taking up taijiquan by Poles is health improvement and fitness, as well as the interest in Oriental martial arts. For most practitioners it is, first of all, “internal martial art”, a form of Far Eastern meditation, the philosophy of life in today’s urbanized civilization. It is a form of physical activity available in Poland regardless of the age and occupation, becoming an integral part of their lifestyle and the only preferred form of physical activity. Conclusions: The findings lead to the conclusion that taijiquan is such an attractive martial art in terms of health benefits that its further popularization may become the only or one of the main “life sports” not only for Poles.","inCitations":["3cbe9fb9f3fc31c90d2240f22015ffcad87569df","92ee28db99a4cb8a6c2bac69d010a2636035f809","c31cd60170ee3f228308a85cafa3bd75730acd3c","a76c62d49d9d51595b5e1f0c0b7c605f3d3be842","2f6369b1a2612c61a8e4fe7963373191fad629a3"],"pdfUrls":["http://files.4medicine.pl/download.php?cfs_id=1313"],"title":"The meaning of taijiquan from the Chen family in physical activity of Poles","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Interpretation of the N sink versus source status of CWD of red spruce and Fraser fir was dependent on the method used. Over a chronosequence of decay, (1) N concentrations sug- geste daNs ink (i.e., an et gain of No f923% in red spruce and 563% in Fraser fir relative to N in live trees); (2) N contents that reflected changes in density suggested a smaller N sink (i.e., a net gain of N of 218% in red spruce and 125% in Fraser fir relative to N in live trees), but the stoichiometry of N and C suggested a N source in early stages of decay and a N source in the most advanced stage of decay only; and (3) N contents that reflected changes in vol- ume suggested a N source (i.e., a net N loss of -172% in red spruce and -122% in Fraser fir). The C/N ratios in CWD suggested that the shift from a N source to a N sink represented a shift from the mobilization of dissolved or- ganic N to the immobilization of ammonium N and (or) nitrate N. The magnitude of the net change in N contents in both red spruce and Fraser fir was amongst the highest reported in literature, suggesting that CWD plays a particularly important role in N dynamics in N saturated forests.","inCitations":["bed34de63e832934ef165b87b4fa823878d4b4a3","a6a4fd3c8f1b04b332a4edcf24662df14f099948","4aa683a7ab2ce2f76a2dd180c4436ed80be9aefc","e059741627392457430c1ddb7303eeb73ee3476c","f87046f632dda7e6295dbf3c4ba586cd8b0bac37","1c593a3c6ba1e295fd8e4f21a9cb0eea0ed5cbed","79933d8f0290afbe353612552c9681192bbf4675","ab76feb3debc041cdde702adbf069bb1596aa2fe","bff7e80b3f46d1917898b0ab5a9f1033a8300855","5196a5e7aa59f3860d1c5bc657be569bb3baff3e","463787f88da337354cf028a03350a81c4aa8ff5f","9e9e87fb4c8c42912f09c2536d2c3298f212581d","b557b69ab43e576aec7b6221b0b8cdb19ab36ba7","3ef5cc4d2e324614bf0267e6ede51f6747cb8c89","f2b8522b856fa52ddbb05a49626c412397fb7003","56115569945cd5d5043e383767d8daa71520425c","c5aef70b010115855260a2dd8e44a4fa1dc71b47","f12643939b809c4e3b639efb732eba8e4ccfda88"],"pdfUrls":["https://www.uwo.ca/biology/faculty/creed/PDFs/Journal%20Articles/016%20Creed%20et%20al%202004%20-%20Is%20coarse.pdf"],"title":"Is coarse woody debris a net sink or source of nitrogen in the red spruce - Fraser fir forest of the southern Appalachians, U.S.A.?","doi":"10.1139/x03-211","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1139/x03-211","venue":""}

Increasing object size requires greater effort by the fingers to grip. The main objective of this study is to analyse the variation in grip and pinch strength exerted on objects of various sizes and shapes in a short span of time. OpenSim 3.3 is open-source musculoskeletal modelling software used for performing simulations in a dynamic environment. The generic wrist model in OpenSim has movements on index finger and thumb only, for study purpose. Objects of various sizes were designed and imported in OpenSim. This study determines the joint moments exerted by the fingers during grip activities. Original model was modified and custom joints were placed in the proximal and distal phalanx joints of the fingers. This allowed the finger segments to undergo translational and rotational movements. Coordinates of the custom joints were adjusted to provide constraints in the joint movement to hold the objects in position. For grip strength, objects of various sizes and shapes were imported to OpenSim. Simulation was carried out for gripping the objects for a specified time period. The force generated by the synergistic movements of finger segments was compared among grip and pinch of different objects. This method is used to determine the grip and pinch strength by handling objects of different shapes and sizes under the influence of time.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Analysis of grip and pinch strength using inverse dynamics simulation technique","doi":"10.1177/0954411918798400","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1177/0954411918798400","venue":"Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers.

It is found that in the forward direction, the neutron distribution fails to attain equilibrium inside 140-cm-thick assemblies with transverse dimensions of 150 x 150 cm/sup 2/, whereas in the backward direction, equilibrium is reached even inside an assembly of transverse dimensions of 80 x 80 cm/sup 2/. It is shown that in the forward direction, equilibrium is delayed by the presence of a penetrating beam of uncollided sub-Bragg neutrons of the source. Thus, an experimentalist can hardly hope to observe equilibrium in the forward direction. The calculated value of diffusion length is in excellent agreement with the observed as well as the theoretical values obtained by earlier workers.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Space- and angle-dependent steady-state thermal-neutron spectra inside small beryllium assemblies.

If this mechanism fails, as happens with the vestibular hypofunction, the patient complains of blurred vision (oscillopsia). One way of checking the operation of this reflex is through quantification of visual acuity during head movements. In this paper, we will describe tests that allow its valuation. Method: Narrative review. Results: There are two types of tools that allow us to measure the dynamic visual acuity (DVA), the clinical tests, and the computerized. Reliability can be increased if in the clinical evaluation we add some system that allows us to control the frequency and the amplitude of the movement which we induce to the head. Discussion: Clinical tests are more simple, accessible and cost-effective, and however, the computerized are more accurate, but require more expensive and less close instruments. Conclusion: Even featuring a variety of objective procedures, the clinical determination of the DVA remains useful for screening the vestibular function and to measure the degree of compensation, during rehabilitation.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Revisión sobre la agudeza visual dinámica","doi":"10.14201/orl.17139","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.14201/orl.17139","venue":""}

The global rupture of an RPV is simulated by finite element limit analysis for the collapse load and mode to secure the safety criteria of a nuclear reactor under severe accident conditions. Finite element limit analysis is a systematic tool dealing with upper bounding and minimization technique to calculate the collapse load and mode. The finite element code (CALF, computer analysis of lower head failure) developed provides the temperature elevation in the lower head of a nuclear reactor under severe accident conditions as well as the collapse load and mode. The thermal analysis has to deal with heat transfer from the debris pool to the RPV wall and the top of the pool.

To rapidly evaluate metabolite similarities and differences among the EtOH extracts of the roots of eight commercial Astragalus spp., an approach based on direct analyses by ESI-MS followed by PCA of ESI-MS data, was carried out. Successively, quali-quantitative analyses of cycloartane derivatives in the eight Astragalus spp. by LC-ESI-MS(n) and PCA of LC-ESI-MS data were performed. This approach allowed to promptly highlighting metabolite similarities and differences among the various Astragalus spp. PCA results from LC-ESI-MS data of Astragalus samples were in reasonable agreement with both PCA results of ESI-MS data and quantitative results.

The fourteen papers, each of which is published here, gave a broad insight into the transformation of the Arctic which we can expect during the next century on account of anthropogenic warming. The special importance of the Arctic to the global warming problem is made clear in the first paper by Cattle & Crossley, which shows the results of the latest general circulation model (GCM) produced by the Hadley Centre for Climate Prediction and Research. Within 70 years, the Arctic is predicted to warm by at least 4 °C on an annual average, and in places by more than 8 °C, as compared to values of 0-4 °C elsewhere in the world and even a slight cooling in parts of the Southern Ocean. The warming will be greater in the winter, and this large Arctic enhancement of global warming persists even when the moderating effect of sulphate aerosols is taken into account. One mechanism contributing to this enhancement is ice-albedo feedback, whereby the retreat of seasonal snow on land, and sea ice in the ocean, reduces average albedo and so generates a positive feedback loop.","inCitations":["7ff1d84dea2cafbbbadbdc087e9a8e8850f4605b"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"The Arctic and environmental change - Preface","doi":"10.1098/rsta.1995.0063","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1098/rsta.1995.0063","venue":""}

They are effective against squamous cell carcinoma, Hodgkin’s disease, and malignant lymphoma and are particularly valuable since they show no immunosuppression(2). The mode of action has attracted a great deal of attention but the molecular mechanism of action is by no means clear. BLM shows interference with nucleic acid metabolism as evidenced by (i) inhibition of DNA synthesis(3), (ii) interference with mitosis(2), and (iii) DNA breakage(4). Recently BLM has been shown to release nucleosomes from chromatin(5). In addition there is interference with enzyme action, e.g., inhibition of ligase action(6), but stimulation of nuclease activity(7). BLM also causes liberation of DNA from DNA-membrane complexesi(8). Thus considerable biochemical evidence suggests that the principal cell target is DNA which is degraded by BLM both in vivo and in vitro (2,4,9-11). DNA cleavage is enhanced in the presence of reducing agents such as 2-mercaptoethanol, dithiothreitol, or ascorbate and by the addition of Fe(II) and requires oxygen(2,1l-13). The DNA cleavage is inhibited by Cu, Zn, Co, Mg, and EDTA(14). These observations led to the suggestion of a direct role of trace metal ions, particularly of Fe, in the mode of action of the antibiotic(12,13) which would be in accord with a general role suggested for Fe in tissue disorders and cancer control(15). Clinical grade BLM was shown to contain 0.02 mole% Fe by atomic absorption(15).","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Contribution of the Superoxide Anion-Hydroxyl Radical Pathway to the Cleavage of DNA by Bleomycin","doi":"10.1007/978-1-4612-6191-9_14","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4612-6191-9_14","venue":""}

However, there is a lack of empirical research that investigates the effective integration of specific risk management practices proposed by various standards with new product development programs and their association with various dimensions of risk management success. Based on a survey of 291 product development programs, this paper investigates the association of risk management practices with five categories of product development program performance: (A) Quality Decision Making; (B) High Program Stability; (C) Open, problem solving organization; (D) Overall new product development project success; and (E) overall product success. The results show that six categories of risk management practices are most effective: (1) Develop risk management skills and resources; (2) Tailor risk management to and integrate it with new product development; (3) Quantify impacts of risks on your main objectives; (4) Support all critical decisions with risk management results; (5) Monitor and review your risks, risk mitigation actions, and risk management process; and (6) Create transparency regarding new product development risks. The data shows that the risk management practices are directly associated with outcome measures in the first three categories (improved decision making, program stability and problem solving). There is also evidence that the risk management practices indirectly associate with the remaining two categories of outcome measures (project and product success). Additional research is needed to describe the exact mechanisms through which risk management practices influence NPD program success.","inCitations":["11ab649bca5f00b08d0b0f593b3d4b63d2cfd069","3fe644f269f564ef03f03129f60d3f4b4d5d3ab5","ea33773cbb9a8f9fb78e4a24b13fc0d1e33baa9d","e53fd487d1365b0dae0a0f42cf5810391a26e453","053ce097ba340fe39e92e6afdc1f4d701d5bf6ae","26a832cabedd6c1ffe99a8872c7329cc88150e7d","d6cd5c083632eb6a14695561a7d196f5af5b6d6c","16bb170973773685d64503ad91b2ad9c8f85a63e","26d2315c5865e79d649ae916198bef3b6e6fdaa4","76950a2ddd718c7e7faf093d8a36946c4abffc2b","0d5b986d84bf352447b5235bb47c476ff8d1631e","fc0b7cba011237afea6628fe9b09a15ef3aa7c37","435a6b72a5ce4e6cfb05a0f3c559dc07e85a918c","d97fb0a9749cf9f5576dda88a6cc142b5db8e9ef","0f7c0a2fae1cae862d3e4af1fbc696c05ac81396","2f74fcc4343827cbab023dc99803f957d08374e1","f1d58e54a99e69291f6d495125bbd22cdc8f2163","9d98b2935d1229c9cb6780261bb46142b68445b9","50c584ebe2103d89dc77784da10e6827bba292c2","cdfa6a544857b7d06144e4c262240ca1cee9ec50","2bea3b96c1f3929098351976303483f88e719e3b","c5103cab46201878d90cd6013003a0bacf933a25","76a13ed0a28be6b1297d778a70a5fdf84c3b56dd","f737faed35d6ed527507d7c91379b27598957603","5938239a6b6066d11dca83477d777f4df6f253bb","4cca6d140bcbc0d45cec58d9397e94a35444deab","93db88d4656bd1040e6169955834034ead2dd865","3293248ad0f39d1290a4d359daa979cdf8af8756","1323103f0820016aa4efeaaf41e4ef2bc805983a","242dac8840bdbc540ce8848c33322e642a680689","107c9b88221e04198aaa5fca36222c3478c2c3e4","871c4f71f5dece58479f5f57dd1babf4eb532417","a0ac7cc3195cfc7f829d7d4369a94a74b978b2bd","3480323eee9f904865734b9cc038202082c3bdca","17a724d95a95c7e8849b75577b1cb2afc05b7223","e8a095176afb5a5146e4c094ce8de3d8d50290a7","40ff4d7411cec4d9c9743eae63f813825384ef53","99629496ed0d6cd5a48781f7056265592d0796d5","10cb66f7ebdf0c28281161ddeb7fc8c069b59b17"],"pdfUrls":["http://isiarticles.com/bundles/Article/pre/pdf/43929.pdf","http://orbit.dtu.dk/files/89398964/Analysis_of_the_effect_of_risk_management_practices_Final_Pre_Publication_Manuscript.pdf","http://orbit.dtu.dk/en/publications/analysis-of-the-effect-of-risk-management-practices-on-the-performance-of-new-product-development-programs(1a3b2850-8fed-4bcb-afe6-9c5e20b1a66a).pdf?nofollow=true&rendering=short","http://orbit.dtu.dk/en/publications/analysis-of-the-effect-of-risk-management-practices-on-the-performance-of-new-product-development-programs(1a3b2850-8fed-4bcb-afe6-9c5e20b1a66a).pdf?nofollow=true&rendering=author","http://orbit.dtu.dk/en/publications/analysis-of-the-effect-of-risk-management-practices-on-the-performance-of-new-product-development-programs(1a3b2850-8fed-4bcb-afe6-9c5e20b1a66a).pdf?nofollow=true&rendering=long","http://orbit.dtu.dk/en/publications/analysis-of-the-effect-of-risk-management-practices-on-the-performance-of-new-product-development-programs(1a3b2850-8fed-4bcb-afe6-9c5e20b1a66a).pdf?nofollow=true&rendering=vancouver","http://orbit.dtu.dk/en/publications/analysis-of-the-effect-of-risk-management-practices-on-the-performance-of-new-product-development-programs(1a3b2850-8fed-4bcb-afe6-9c5e20b1a66a).pdf?nofollow=true&rendering=mla","https://orbit.dtu.dk/files/89398964/Analysis_of_the_effect_of_risk_management_practices_Final_Pre_Publication_Manuscript.pdf","https://orbit.dtu.dk/ws/files/89398964/Analysis_of_the_effect_of_risk_management_practices_Final_Pre_Publication_Manuscript.pdf","http://orbit.dtu.dk/en/publications/analysis-of-the-effect-of-risk-management-practices-on-the-performance-of-new-product-development-programs(1a3b2850-8fed-4bcb-afe6-9c5e20b1a66a).pdf?nofollow=true&rendering=cbe","http://orbit.dtu.dk/en/publications/analysis-of-the-effect-of-risk-management-practices-on-the-performance-of-new-product-development-programs(1a3b2850-8fed-4bcb-afe6-9c5e20b1a66a).pdf?nofollow=true&rendering=apa","http://orbit.dtu.dk/en/publications/analysis-of-the-effect-of-risk-management-practices-on-the-performance-of-new-product-development-programs(1a3b2850-8fed-4bcb-afe6-9c5e20b1a66a).pdf?nofollow=true&rendering=harvard","https://backend.orbit.dtu.dk/ws/files/89398964/Analysis_of_the_effect_of_risk_management_practices_Final_Pre_Publication_Manuscript.pdf","https://backend.orbit.dtu.dk/ws/portalfiles/portal/89398964/Analysis_of_the_effect_of_risk_management_practices_Final_Pre_Publication_Manuscript.pdf"],"title":"Analysis of the effect of risk management practices on the performance of new product development programs","doi":"10.1016/j.technovation.2013.12.005","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.technovation.2013.12.005","venue":""}

The merits of these motors could be enhanced further according to another design approach method which alters the typically used winding parts for low to medium power range motors. This paper deals with the high power brushless DC motor used for traction in a 48 V golf cart system. The stator is designed with segment rectangular copper winding to maximize output power within its limited dimensions. In the design process, the closed slot opening and slot-pole combination are investigated and compared in terms of efficiency and input current density. The developed motor obtained about 120% greater power density per volume compared to a commercial motor with round winding coils at similar efficiency and variable speed range.","inCitations":["9338dac453a56ea87edbf855751d456583b5b33d","16f9069110fe179781bb857cfbb335e4e281bfe5","ae904299793a557254f4a6b3b3b4c5225c0d3798","e1eab59099bb3b2338bfb953a159b23591761601","1ee8455b4ab388bb9df4b9aa8373b84d7b372ca6","e8b6907cacd92c7e003d9a853ebc34cccc105478","21a315b4604442168b162fde40803848c2361d1a","e1f13d9a1a71f30224b042d405f0b3a967d1fa9e","2d219ba033334e7502e79d6295bb3e0d6282a550","004b0dc102b3438367a19544890c9b427f4fc45e","fc50c7245b321fbe4f90bf1134c5fbe03f3e838e","6d739fd6ade7f19bf3a677527d7ec9b3a32dff63","a7a844bc93a6b03f0716549d8c9c9d78cbad699a","d808bd6435e93b57f14de2bc0390b08335843cef","639ada4370b8837bcf332080306bf48e7ac6d183","735aeccd9cdd4756dc63eda959c36ea3b2ec1afe","4093b4431a5d3b753fe4f912a88d7b8836de3855","a1fe2d5e84dddd1a242749e1254aa38b67263937","253cf18bf65431dd65e0c393d172b7339d055497","0e905c5b08f924f8c695b4b02aae9c01aaa84f8e"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Design of High Power Permanent Magnet Motor With Segment Rectangular Copper Wire and Closed Slot Opening on Electric Vehicles*","doi":"10.1109/tmag.2010.2060385","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/tmag.2010.2060385","venue":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics"}

The aim of the present study was to estimate a possible application of comet assay in the evaluation of DNA damage caused by different gamma radiation doses in peripheral human lymphocytes in vitro. Materials and methods. Whole blood samples of young healthy, non-smoking donors were taken. The samples were divided in 4 specimens. The first specimen was used as the control. Other three specimens were irradiated using constant gamma irradiation source (60Co) giving the dose rate of 0.907 cGy/s. Different specimens were irradiated for 51 s, 437 s and 1099 s, giving the doses of 0.5 Gy, 4 Gy and 10 Gy. In order to estimate dose-response curve on the control and all 3 irradiated whole blood samples, the comet assay under alkali conditions was performed. Results and conclusions. The comet assay endpoints showed statistically significantly higher values for all irradiated blood samples compared to the control. For both, tail length and tail moment, dose-effect relationship was found to be linear in a dose range of 0.5Gy and 10 Gy. By this work we also pointed out possible usage of the comet assay in the detection of DNA lesions caused by extremely high radiation dose, which is not possible by using standard cytogenetic methods.","inCitations":["947e47dace9c7459a11506a0356dcfb865bdc484","6ccfb907658c7b19a238cf2cc06c4fab23d8a6f0","a23793f92621da78242c457ffb5be3fb8f6b72c3","134554cd462fadd221d681df7e3a1371777d7bc7","5216f42fa89c8182cab6ac5a40afc4cbad9b43fa","71e06d6aa6fb4cf9ded0c4785306f2d3e352c29b","e098c93cfcb84dad26b577da38b97147d50e0794","e2240612837626d3ecd67a3cd8160271f69dd655","fe08a922b4cee18e5ab47c7ed54a8c0672d88360","7d4e0a1d26a47732922b4290aed51b08101bb95c","56c3a4d416a223c5ddc7daf7ad8f66d9d29e045f","0d61fefaa8874782b10c06338aac7579674ea13e","22135dce8a36c889bbd9e928e69d2890edecc8cd"],"pdfUrls":["https://www.onko-i.si/fileadmin/onko/datoteke/dokumenti/043801-garaj.pdf"],"title":"Comet assay in the assessment of the human genome damage induced by γ-radiation in vitro","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

This study describes the response properties of V1 cortical cells in a nocturnal primate and examines the receptive field organization of these cells in relationship to anatomically defined layers and cytochrome oxidase (CO) rich blobs and CO poor interblob compartments. Visual resolution and contrast sensitivity are consistent with other physiological and behavioral measures in this species. Comparisons are made with response properties of the same zones in macaque monkey, as well as of area 17 of a distantly related species (cat) that also occupies a nocturnal niche. 2. The responses of single cells to drifting sinusoidal gratings were recorded in V1 (striate cortex) of anesthetized, paralyzed bush babies (Galago crassicaudatus). Cells tended to be grouped with respect to ocular dominance, orientation preference, and direction selectivity. There was a high proportion of monocularly driven cells as in macaque monkey. Only 6% of the cells were nonoriented. These were poorly tuned complex cells and bore no resemblance to nonoriented lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN)-like cells reported in layer IV of macaque monkeys. Unidirectional cells were most frequently encountered in cortical layers that receive input from the magnocellular layers of the LGN. 3. Cells were classified as simple (31%) or complex (69%) according to standard criteria. Simple cells were significantly more narrowly tuned than complex cells for both orientation and spatial frequency. Complex cells had significantly higher average optimal spatial frequencies and spatial frequency cutoffs than simple cells. Contrast sensitivity of simple and complex cells averaged 38 and 34, respectively. Spatial resolution and sensitivity of these cells matches behavioral measures in bush baby. The spatial and temporal resolution of bush baby cells are similar to those of cats, which is likely related to the nocturnal niche of both species. 4. Cells in supragranular (I-III) and infragranular (V, VI) layers differed significantly in their response characteristics. The cells in the supragranular layers had significantly higher contrast sensitivity than did the cells in the infragranular layers. Cells in the supragranular layers likewise had higher temporal frequency cutoffs, significantly lower optimal spatial frequencies, lower spatial frequency cutoffs, and tighter orientation tuning than did cells in the infragranular layers. 5. Properties of cells in individual layers and CO blob and interblob compartments also showed differentiation. Layer III had the narrowest orientation and spatial frequency tuning with the tightest tuning in layer IIIC (IVB).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","inCitations":["bcb45c1aebcb0bd8102045270bd68b756e4d7136","09e8572c4a426f68ef89ff388a4554d296d7cb73","305c1f780b0199651a3201006dfb549d7ef2a358","bc8264f0fc2538041179261373a9f69b6bb21548","71d7cad0ed9e400779f9f09d74ce2cc418d62c8b","e567f8bce27d766c7f07d8f52c74c600dd9aa879","afca91e167d89fe9292904d8df9023ff76507ea9","3da5b640e5d0678c7030861e840f7fcf48a8dc62","2c11e839c3613263e77dc7f9712a06d537b2cfe1","7b52242677a656b6d62c9fe2472a05883b1b0162","69bfb0a36cec5ccc1cd13281ee8f3a8c12765b06","3bad8e212cc15a8fbf71889ab7ccc96a31703a66","8f22e21049c6caf95f8c5381836df436c5956498","c02f2b8ca737f1ac5a2f9f348eaee8941aad6f26","eeed88dfdba3d4504a942cf88efd07847b63607d","a406c1cc099252c17b0eb2d480fd57d5f6f86feb","2f74bb84476ce4a35420e9c12dc9d87cb7931fba","07139556780f44e14d994ebd7f135f9063e547a3","8338383e19e369b1e3074722ecc557bae9a711a8","3c6a15ccdfdc0673ded64ad89be88cf60524282a","e5952ad5afb1ef9e0538124cf0a9f8a429d98c05","4c660e5a53af0e7a6716638c15f8f92a98f2bc7e","281604b231992c64791f3a6081717ba0207d46f1","f766272478ff1e48d47efed57961c7377d0c6de0","5272a4d30f55f72ae7c7411cb9164a215e299e9f","b4d986418096e758ab378cda8d1360b092010c55","2a3dd63744445ba799c3b4d2898f5d3486510254","c77b2d52036abdcff08357de9d6228ad3644eabe","52ec543cd7ac227db145d79c4b9663ab66a6c373","0c68028567918d0a401feb1e9abe25f860ddcd90","04b24a96aba2741a9e7ae701560ba16fc06f9d36","2c238f5dfb884d32c5fa4c6f6ffb9f548d119d82","d8f94977e7b865f9cb0fef0de13e4f1f5324498e","88c02d51d1b0a4716ff9832289bbe2449fc30415","d08aeee52b12a0766e8c80499c1a0800ba9eec95"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Visual resolution and sensitivity of single cells in the primary visual cortex (V1) of a nocturnal primate (bush baby): correlations with cortical layers and cytochrome oxidase patterns.","doi":"10.1152/jn.1993.69.1.3","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1152/jn.1993.69.1.3","venue":"Journal of neurophysiology"}

However, searches for in vivo evidence of nucleosomal DNA fragmentation in leukemia cells freshly obtained from patients during chemotherapy frequently failed to reveal nucleosomal multimers (DNA ladders). It is not clear whether this type of DNA cleavage is an essential event in drug-induced apoptosis and thus a denominator of cell killing, or whether the internucleosomal DNA fragments are merely the by-products of the apoptotic process. Here, we report our investigation into the role of DNA fragmentation in apoptotic cell death induced by anticancer nucleoside analogues, both in cell culture and in leukemia patients undergoing chemotherapy. Using a 5'-end DNA-labeling technique and pulsed field gel electrophoresis, we detected fragmentation of DNA in two distinct size classes, internucleosomal and high molecular weight (predominantly 50 kb) DNA fragments, in a human leukemia cell line exposed to the nucleoside analogues fludarabine and gemcitabine. We further demonstrated that the two types of DNA fragmentation were separate events, distinguishable by their requirements for Ca2+ and responses to phorbol ester treatment. The drug-treated cells underwent morphological changes of apoptosis even after internucleosomal DNA fragmentation was selectively inhibited by intracellular Ca2+ chelation, or by treatment with phorbol ester. In contrast, neither apoptotic morphology nor internucleosomal DNA fragmentation was observed when the high molecular weight DNA fragmentation was blocked by inhibition of nucleoside analogue incorporation into DNA. These results suggest that cleavage of DNA into large fragments may be an initial event that is critical for drug-induced apoptosis, whereas activation of a Ca2+-dependent endonuclease to cleave DNA at internucleosomal sites is not an absolute requirement for the execution of the apoptotic cell death program. Further studies of leukemic lymphocytes obtained from 9 patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia during therapy with fludarabine revealed high molecular weight DNA fragmentation, which was correlated with a decrease of peripheral lymphocytes in 6 patients, whereas only 1 of the 15 patients evaluated for nucleosomal DNA fragments showed the DNA ladders. These results indicate that high molecular weight DNA fragmentation occurs in vivo, and may be correlated with the cytotoxic action of the anticancer drugs. Further study of the association of high molecular weight DNA fragmentation with clinical response to chemotherapy is warranted.","inCitations":["808cedcad3fd31ea5d59b6983c0cee71abee4c26","f689b1dec86185f84ba72c5b26a780645d974797","3ca8eeffd9b6e88d24151b04c31ccdbd9569604f","df5a82509315128a27d7eb5b0e710fe88457a321","2202fc38a75500cb140f82e38abfe6fda2da801c","24042de64d650aa836c1feabf23430252c67636f","a33cf7e7f3424c11dd4704f3465d43912e0b7e09","b091f3aff9cf0bca130e0656f40cf2f01b76dd4b","c1232482c45e58990132a013ed4afe02ca232aef","ed1e5785c338ad2db0806af5834683b830fa890d","fdde786f5a1845b2513566ee27fbf625da922cd7","75b8fc3296cc33628c6e85d35d12fc62e64f0e74","8e209053ae8d1ebfef6b4feaba62ecad88bd127c","65f956d8deeff1fe4b6f101b8c773dd62e5e5957","a7382b788e84542e5cfa8dc3d3f11efa33b2fef5","8a82ad22bd5d0dc1c1a4bd6ef3c77cd590473937","e7231bb08cc6afb3c290ada3559f6c6ff11660c2","5d15a5a2d7ab57707f9286f096487866132d4d94","6ded556703900d82acab8f6f85c39aab790c5304","18b87c668b68d2c3240a0696699acfb085bc6994","52a42cc89b46ca8daeaece46921341e23fde0d1a","2930f12299f4682e1686c04a0659dd8db6d41d89","bab0cfd0a63c22fbfdfb21ffa968df59ae68d0d9","58d6cf2803e71b07ac0837a612ac87313d45cf7e","d0fc405649d049c389028859005795c613063ac2","6e3be38f21056eef1cf25615053cbb003cce6370","17cd780caf52407caf21366409ca12850c6badc3","b0e67d3ca07b046f13fe9110e8e1a6eeb8ebb7a8","7b199d02cba8d1abf79a737ee9a56162dc5b43ff","c877a4d6ccd003aff5c33f85c81a0b35a372f497","d3c76b4839f7c302ed3a297d7cbb7fee9930bc3b","675656425f05a52c7ec372db56b0033d6cc7f720","162d324af6f480b663127af55ce8c2560428634c","23a1d18b5eddf68597e1db8cc1e3abedd2cad61c","ffd5e1db5766384003284065e2fd99ef600e01c8"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"High molecular weight DNA fragmentation: a critical event in nucleoside analogue-induced apoptosis in leukemia cells.","doi":"","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research"}

T helper type 1 (Th1) and Th2 cells are now known to selectively express CC-chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5)/CXC-chemokine receptor 3 (CXCR3) and CCR4, respectively. To clarify the mechanism of T cell infiltration, we examined in situ expression of these chemokine receptors and their respective chemokine ligands in 40 cases of human colorectal cancer. Immunohistochemistry showed a predominant accumulation of T cells expressing CCR5 and CXCR3 mainly along the invasive margin, whereas those expressing CCR4 were rare. Flow cytometric analysis showed that more than half of CD8(+) T cells and a fraction of CD4(+) cells isolated from fresh tumor tissues co-expressed CCR5 and CXCR3, and CD8(+) T cells and CD4(+) cells predominantly produced interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) over interleukin-4 (IL-4) after in vitro stimulation. RANTES/CCL5, a ligand of CCR5, was localized within infiltrating CD8(+) T cells in a granular pattern, whereas IP-10/CXCL10, a ligand of CXCR3, was localized in cancer cells and macrophages along the invasive margin. These data were consistent with an active recruitment of T cells expressing CCR5 or CXCR3 into the invasive margin of colorectal cancer. With the previous clinicopathological studies showing a favorable prognostic impact of T cell infiltration in colorectal cancer, our study supports the occurrence of a certain level of Th1-shifted cellular immune responses in human colorectal cancer.","inCitations":["a8b583b4cf4e3d098b74e5e2721d862fd7b7f27a","898623b8d2465ecd2d8cf0436fd803afd55ea7b5","a23fdebb4180dd10269644032e85863ec25b536b","467fd5901e25a4962c1bef1e81f47caf86bb4b4a","6893c360392eafcc362982e60c3d9fb6b8bb9de9","ab1654ff3722e9d49fed67e66b25cd5713d22e0c","4bc452d696ed28f5d700b40768ba997375aa9961","10b2afc343911ddb9decba042b871a6b0ab67bda","0487fdbec24af96a8200038ac24ee10b71a81d48","ec284467673b21067fd7b669b12dabc350e38cdf","40a283ceeb91166b51885c1a9fdcbc144b5e1520","bea96b50aaf07f17c0da38a0960741987487b2cf","565f8538c553ca30c7361e6a2e3b9909578da2ea","0db630b5d561d185e50601d5a87d87b46ecff68d","889eccc33763e5a9542f68d40ccb3e4f06312230","16553cc575c59c226ffd8ceb1aa8a42ac495fafe","ee26bb6877b94c3b689f85fb26d3f4986cd206ca","076feecaa623ae4ca44070323ded0f95b492ac86","159d794717bf73ae30eb23cbfc856f4f628e3f42","0ce1d20811bf8b6bf9a0bbe39a1d984b49cfbef5","b3df92fe5f1a6f6fcb3fad6565e9625c36ee93d6","1ed2005f7b81e0e0e423974131c36b0adb675dc1","c637c903615ed6bbc1fcce29571b2d9603eb26d9","53ead25d4a8806bd6080be52d1aa5ae992aae890","37ae1744d4b2e2c21c3fe412b6b700df0627d9eb","75f0308db4f663697542aebbbcb31ba677387946","f7bb4e4804819ebeada1b964e63298572d4f2582","881bc08df51a5a259ee2554741cdc92ecf876c95","2ec58831518a799bf275b187a4c2fe4ddb008492","1dc8b3ef29c7544f08a249ab671962600fb281b8","46235eab72c34c5c7e0760db38782b061f5f703e","034db9c4d4a6887e30b131332ba735afecbea139","c00d481719d710c057e92665d8fea648d96168cf","12e3f5a118ba05c4712c26edc265c1f925468287","5b7b00509b37e75c3e1697ad9d8f126301483e1d","87546ab25468da5fa5654199e2b29a1e5eb37d0f","0088866a0e05c4f92507e8021bc4376c96952b72","2548a835f0e7acd420e69e12d0ac97e0ad63e066","4dcf3ed1f01f8ba6d864a479e1fc0a7597777f4a","8022317f0957fa5b046c81d735aba25cf68832cd","c48c6c88c7eed8790f75e182819248c9bf842597","bce0112543150e20caf9cda2d2cfd765186fa43b","c5f826841a96de9182b063a16635fc2553845233","97673f27e4a0cd0ce6d67125c1c53105d066f48a","7e54999a3a176c312b596cbe27c99256962b9d2d","ca78b2a09162ef8ca2560d33f405c51a7a6babd4","66bbdb992294b7fc2931d61c9416142e29c64615","20cee80dabac7869376fd5cd5147230ff095171d","91fa33e84ea6be75375f46b4ecc3359da33824cb","68da3b268c73da4e97153c64f740eefd83c973b3","2190e6eee58fa34c1a5c19a395608fa547ec14e2","a72d85dff9483a4b65a4ff9dc9210e44c08177c0","75e492181118e904e081b06f1211a9794d529093","52d6dfce0500056eb91b34e66d385ce516ef643a","aab83c0e7e8cda1cd5a9a68d6622f054d279bf89","a8416a28e7b3f273b71c882290479174a0703d35","3178604154117dbb92f66c32ec710b2f786f1a5c","96086badebef2989bce27bcc476dbdaa4a030304","ffe8fe8e8249d3b9b6047a75b4bf4b0da1fd0144","7759f814465925071420eca601d98ad59ca56f69","1cbad5fa3425559d5223b70531348a5973c50421","44354762b186c9ee5a70257953b00be0dd26a80b","2af305018f8fa54824011cf4883a3392249533da","dbdebf9fd67deeed336330ef29b33cd6614e8b6f","066bc4a8f12874d9871cb7539d8ca5fef5bd7afa","c2ce5d33312a30fe37fa80b9e167b2c4f437daef","92b97f6393df2dd9a9a531eb7e6677e362470582"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Selective infiltration of CCR5(+)CXCR3(+) T lymphocytes in human colorectal carcinoma.","doi":"10.1002/ijc.21135","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1002/ijc.21135","venue":"International journal of cancer"}

Testicular needle biopsy carried out in addition to surgical open biopsy proved to be an effective method to obtain spermatozoa for ICSI from patients with obstructive azoospermia. Thus it might be possible to replace scrotal operations by simple needle biopsies. Embryos resulting from ICSI with testicular spermatozoa were used in 19 transfers that resulted in six pregnancies. One pregnancy resulted from six embryo transfers from ICSI after microsurgical-epididymal sperm aspiration (MESA). The normal fertilization rates with testicular (37.3%) and MESA spermatozoa (53.7%) did not differ significantly from each other, but with testicular spermatozoa the rate was significantly lower than that obtained with ejaculated spermatozoa and ICSI (59.7%) in the matched couples. The abnormal fertilization of oocytes with one pronucleus was significantly higher with testicular spermatozoa than with ejaculated spermatozoa in the control couples.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Testicular needle biopsy, open biopsy, epididymal aspiration and intracytoplasmic sperm injection in obstructive azoospermia","doi":"10.1093/oxfordjournals.humrep.a135752","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1093/oxfordjournals.humrep.a135752","venue":""}

El proposito de este articulo es estudiar en una serie televisiva sobre la biografia del narcotraficante colombiano Pablo Escobar como y por que este concepto puede adoptar otras formas de contenido ideologico, con un efecto similar al observado por Hannah Arendt en el juicio del funcionario nazi Adolf Eichmann. El enfoque metodologico de este trabajo pone en una perspectiva contempo­ranea el planteamiento de la sociologia del lenguaje y de la critica narra­tiva, inaugurada por Jean-Pierre Faye en sus estudios sobre los lenguajes totalitarios, al plantear como problema de fondo la transformacion de los dispositivos ideologicos en la era de la informacion, en la cual el sufri­miento social es presentado como espectaculo. La propuesta es deconstruir en la narrativa de la teleserie los mecanismos que presentan las actuaciones criminales como hechos comunes. Los referentes para este analisis son los signos religiosos que tienen un efecto de realidad en el desarrollo del guion televisivo y su funcion ideologica de interpelacion.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"La banalidad del mal y el rostro contemporáneo de su ideología en una teleserie del narcotraficante Pablo Escobar en Colombia","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Klaus Michel and Sanne Jünger 2. Roger Pfund 3. Robert Kalina (Austrian central bank) 4. Maryke Degryse (Belgian central bank) 5. Terry Thorn (De La Rue Currency / Harrisons & Sons, banknote printing house) In the design proposed for Ages and styles of Europe by Robert Kalina, which was ultimately chosen by the EMI Council, the jury praised its symbolism, bridges linking people of Europe and the continents of the world, and doors and gateways onto the future. In the next stage of the competition, the banknote working group produced a technical commentary on the jury’s shortlist. It pointed out that for some of the jury’s choices, sheets could not be cut into banknotes with a single stroke and the notes would therefore have to have the same colour at the top and bottom edge and also at both ends. Other common deficiencies were incompatible printing techniques, space where extra zeros could be added to denominations, poorly differentiated colours and weak contrast between the denomination and the background. Because the proposals that the jury liked best would require a lot of extra work and resources before being fit for printing, the banknote group expressed the hope that the Council would select only one and not two finalists. Not contenting itself with the views of technical and artistic experts, the EMI Council decided to explore the opinion of the general public and people who handled money in their work, by interviewing target groups from the Member States. In October 1996 the ten banknote series selected by the jury were shown to representatives of the public in the countries that would probably adopt the euro.5 EOS Gallup Europe, the polling company selected to do the research, asked 1 896 people their opinions of the designs. The subjects were aged 15–86 and almost half of them were chosen because their jobs involved handling large numbers of banknotes. A detailed questionnaire was drawn up and each of the interviewees was shown photocopies of the draft designs selected by the jury. The questions, totalling some 30, explored the distinctiveness of the notes, their acceptability and what the feelings they aroused.","inCitations":["f3da067674a19b52af05a09be0d79756b0cfb29f","16c6633469c12ff1607ec0ce8a7d28bc4a7fd52d"],"pdfUrls":["https://helda.helsinki.fi/bof/bitstream/handle/123456789/13645/the_first_euros_2015en.pdf?isAllowed=y&sequence=1"],"title":"The first euros : The creation and issue of the first euro banknotes and the road to the Europa series","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}
