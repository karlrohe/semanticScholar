Calvary is the only fully accredited, acute care hospital in the U.S. devoted exclusively to the palliative care of adult patients with life-limiting illnesses and advanced cancers. Approximately 2,500 cancer patients are admitted each year. Almost all are suffering from wasting due to their incurable condition. The average length of stay is 25 days. More than 90 percent of these patients die, robbed of their aspirations and futures. Tumors have stolen their lungs, disfigured their faces, silenced their voices, broken their bones and paralyzed their extremities. Many have been rendered hairless, wasted, helpless, dependent and bedridden. Often they vomit, bleed, swell and become deformed. By its mission, Calvary Hospital sees in every suffering patient a supreme dignity, even in the confines of a decaying body. Patients and their families never are abandoned. Never do they feel the absence of love.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://www.chausa.org/docs/default-source/health-progress/the-nature-and-treatment-of-human-suffering.pdf?sfvrsn=0"],"title":"The Nature and Treatment of Human Suffering","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

The electrochemical analysis put in evidence that nitrite ions were reduced from −0.6 to −0.78 V and the charge transfer step is attributed to the NO 2 − /NO redox couple. The Tafel slope analysis confirms that from E p to −0.78 V the reduction of NO occurs via an ECE mechanism.

While linear and branched actomyosin architectures are well characterized in cell-culture and cell-free systems3, it is not known how actin and myosin networks form and function to remodel membranes in complex three-dimensional mammalian tissues. Here, we use four-dimensional spinning-disc confocal microscopy with image deconvolution to acquire macromolecular-scale detail of dynamic actomyosin networks in exocrine glands of live mice. We address how actin and myosin organize around large membrane-bound secretory vesicles and generate the forces required to complete exocytosis5–7. We find that actin and non-muscle myosin II (NMII) assemble into previously undescribed polyhedral-like lattices around the vesicle membrane. The NMII lattice comprises bipolar minifilaments8–10 as well as non-canonical three-legged configurations. Using photobleaching and pharmacological perturbations in vivo, we show that actomyosin contractility and actin polymerization together push on the underlying vesicle membrane to overcome the energy barrier and complete exocytosis7. Our imaging approach thus unveils a force-generating actomyosin lattice that regulates secretion in the exocrine organs of live animals. Using intravital imaging, Ebrahim et al. show that actin and non-muscle myosin II assemble into polyhedral lattices around the vesicle membrane to mediate exocytic secretion in live tissues.","inCitations":["7f5db69b9f2f3b870f07a7165d44b1fc66fabc98"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Dynamic polyhedral actomyosin lattices remodel micron-scale curved membranes during exocytosis in live mice","doi":"10.1038/s41556-019-0365-7","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41556-019-0365-7","venue":"Nature Cell Biology"}

Therefore, the present paper purports to finding out the specific challenges which is evident in the Higher Education system of India and Government's initiatives to fight the existing challenges. Secondary data was used to infer the current scenario of Higher Education in India. It was found that the contribution of National Knowledge Commission (NKC), University Grants Commission (UGC), Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD) is enormous in addressing various aspects of Higher Education in India. In spite of many efforts by the Govt. of India to harness the education system, there is a huge gap between the policies initiated and their implementation which is demanding innovate approaches and models to ensure quality education.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Higher Education in India: Challenges and Government's Initiatives","doi":"10.5958/2231-458x.2014.00011.6","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.5958/2231-458x.2014.00011.6","venue":""}

This problem has received much attention as evidenced by the recent advancement in both the methodology and performance. However, most of the existing works neither explicitly handle face images with arbitrary poses, nor perform large-scale experiments on non-frontal and profile face images. In order to address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel face alignment algorithm that estimates both 2D and 3D landmarks and their 2D visibilities for a face image with an arbitrary pose. By integrating a 3D point distribution model, a cascaded coupled-regressor approach is designed to estimate both the camera projection matrix and the 3D landmarks. Furthermore, the 3D model also allows us to automatically estimate the 2D landmark visibilities via surface normal. We use a substantially larger collection of all-pose face images to evaluate our algorithm and demonstrate superior performances than the state-of-the-art methods.","inCitations":["b3f3586f37be17f2bee4d29e08e83587ca82f2cd","262cb6f0b9c910792b23aa4c3371652a976c01d1","1389ba6c3ff34cdf452ede130c738f37dca7e8cb","66490b5869822b31d32af7108eaff193fbdb37b0","fa0a0b26e1c041b8b79b5bb5382a09f764bba645","ebb3d5c70bedf2287f9b26ac0031004f8f617b97","704e78015518331eb88aff8b172fe78ea593c974","9d57c4036a0e5f1349cd11bc342ac515307b6720","6b93dd3fef08b914d03ccd735b4464b495d0ac44","b908edadad58c604a1e4b431f69ac8ded350589a","0ba6614ff9ed1cd00e07d44c5c61879958e7566b","e83fb018777af14b934a0999233f58691aa043fb","ec8ec2dfd73cf3667f33595fef84c95c42125945","fb87045600da73b07f0757f345a937b1c8097463","8dfa38f822989a0592ba326940cd1e86b4ca43e9","78f2c8671d1a79c08c80ac857e89315197418472","4a019870874ac1304b1fb9d90f97c57348d2f27e","14edd4432e376da1d6ae1ac5df5aadc3759940f5","19b9131b65e4695748c7e96ce2aecef09895b7f9","938baa1ad68b4075f79035f322283646eccab28d","4396563ee3ec167932071e7936111f6a8899e905","ca36fefa3732e25a760b6150b2867017ee92331a","392b8b95192703999f62e1833272fd1219cec991","63ada149373f27d1ded6df24acaa5871d0c3e379","c5858199b7703bf55f1772edad4856ac908f02b2","6043070c2f2f592601e90d2c71dc6fafca48056b","8a2deb2b4216f6c065c5e955706ce157d96625a1","9feabdf4bb2fe085c4cb0b30bf9013aeccc80114","8a85f0865930ea65239adb5ec2b97407c1446fa4","c548be2a5638e042d793f7014c96613078abb271","2a50e46c3c9553a5d03510fdace701bedbb8e829","63c0bba6ac0937736ec4d8e147acda594cc1fb70","cdb6b1a316995c42bcb90536d6fe17b81cd21b5f","941c4976ae4ce84170e9cbbf6da732829de9b18e","a83fc450c124b7e640adc762e95e3bb6b423b310","ca63b97afcae5c122b440c8a38396649bd6ac850","f79332fce3c3cc641c50d777454b1dd4debd3c5a","a49e8da790b1c5f393fb7e41f4fc5d488cf1c9ca","4486eec058b3ec6b38f100f5df0f0c2fb89bc24d","e5572917445531d4d1f96c15aa06f21c255df303","f201baf618574108bcee50e9a8b65f5174d832ee","6be2522fa708de1334fea647c9151149d16ec9a1","c1f184a0a9559e3d120357f75d44bd2a8393f886","8dcaac0fc1fe3c430d6c1d26a4e2d0577ce490c6","2ff3a9adb58edaa630b264b39d6495d5620aea97","a50fa5048c61209149de0711b5f1b1806b43da00","2201f187a7483982c2e8e2585ad9907c5e66671d","716d6c2eb8a0d8089baf2087ce9fcd668cd0d4c0","34fe617eb4881289eb1d33c4aedc905e9c3f22b9","d97a25d712db782250974c96f9d91dc83291b46d","69977d60dc7eb94543c6fb64b86b7c7a4ed1b6d1","5629fab81ca0221031828360811bc939cdd8f47e","dd715a98dab34437ad05758b20cc640c2cdc5715","df9edd16fd5057d5cd40368195f8c57b14e0cb67","ac155e2481333fddfd9d618939f4b3b30b66a1b5","3a43a0f8e507ba7977073a75a954f0366d19331e","50d8a165db9c455fab6aaf6cb024350d129befb2","30935c94dba2e4adc1e1063e2bb6b8f93c8b7cd6","7ceb1a27f2cb5509be717d4fe30157257e84767a","09ec60f2eea5d43792b2bc9da63b1c9b7719f666","8c7ee7acf850562e7515a3e01800c98cc393e62b","3fba0afcd8be6d7c0354fb888af13270ddb93e92","9801ae9a7853346db0d4a5bf1f87d06f0acb8fb7","6169e61281c1de50949c79c5300dbde7f9d242ba","822899df8c706ad327e94db526de0ec058d24d4c","5a564d108b43c6ff006a86d2fc981cd36c6c54dd","9c427dd9cc6f0bd053f8c58b9eebcb062bc1b43b","b53485dbdd2dc5e4f3c7cff26bd8707964bb0503","f7824758800a7b1a386db5bd35f84c81454d017a","5f6600fa4862a1aeebab707a171c380d095c312a","d22dd4a6752a5ffa40aebd260ff63d2c2a9e1da1","4a04d4176f231683fd68ccf0c76fcc0c44d05281","1d2f138e6d120659637dc0217dead5ba3e8a89c2","080a951a56cf75a971357e82816f7bd75f015b0c","ff0e397159b9eb3f98df7ed49b5d66433075c745","5c0d105cfcc78d689d948a2aa8d654cab4e545f2","b7946fe9974b2d32ac050c3c4b6cc64abd728f3b","9d14cdbf0af4af7a7bc0a62084fe9c0ab43d6502","5420ba17afbf550a9ee7eec933321ad7817cb70d","721e5ba3383b05a78ef1dfe85bf38efa7e2d611d","b5ca8d4f259f35c1f3edfd9f108ce29881e478b0","b2fdf0fc08e673eeeca5ce17c8e4765157d6b8f2","cffedfc08fb9059cd06c65961b9a84e6cbcfaf27","93420d9212dd15b3ef37f566e4d57e76bb2fab2f","b558f5ae01e48f104a1d7f081df32b3497e64610","0797c6aeb1ff46e37d3fcab10d90070990a33434","02e628e99f9a1b295458cb453c09863ea1641b67","d507fbc345fa6aeca442361dfc806c8bbf4b68d0","307aa94a046a7afa23ffd2ea0c9020e057b238bd","7d061a943d65da7e356900ab14f25cce24801421","04eed24e26d9e6aaf2ca434cad20facd5feb83d0","8a6033cbba8598945bfadd2dd04023c2a9f31681","08b37700134ae55abad764ae415b72e2d357f698","cc96eab1e55e771e417b758119ce5d7ef1722b43","6dc558cd4c74bc63b8390059de340d8b14503e6b","c5c0cda46a77a7ea8c1f6d4d762b189ef424ffa4","d09fd5e73beecb804aa1f291781b261978b45111"],"pdfUrls":["http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.03799","http://cse.msu.edu/~liuxm/publication/Jourabloo_Liu_ICCV2015.pdf","http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/ICCV.2015.421","http://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.03799v1.pdf","http://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.03799.pdf","https://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.03799v1.pdf","http://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_iccv_2015/papers/Jourabloo_Pose-Invariant_3D_Face_ICCV_2015_paper.pdf","http://www.cse.msu.edu/~liuxm/publication/Jourabloo_Liu_ICCV2015.pdf","http://web.cse.msu.edu/~liuxm/publication/Jourabloo_Liu_ICCV2015.pdf","http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_iccv_2015/papers/Jourabloo_Pose-Invariant_3D_Face_ICCV_2015_paper.pdf","http://cvlab.cse.msu.edu/pdfs/Jourabloo_Liu_ICCV2015.pdf"],"title":"Pose-Invariant

Throughout the book Scott shares his personal camera and Lightroom settings, as well as the studio-tested techniques he's developed for his own photography workflow. The book is written in his trademark step-by-step, plain English style, and because he knows what really works and what doesn't, he isn't shy to tell you flat out which tools to use, which to avoid, and why. This allows digital photographers of any skill level to jump right in using Lightroom like a pro from the very start, sidestepping a lot of the frustrations that typically haunt those unfamiliar with new applicationsespecially those as powerful as Lightroom.What really sets The Adobe Photoshop Lightroom 2 Book for Digital Photographers apart from other Lightroom books on the market are the last two bonus chapters where Scott answers the questions, \"In exactly what order am I supposed to do things in Lightoom,\" and \"Where does Photoshop fit in to the mix?\" Both chapters start with an on-location photo shoot, including full details on the equipment, camera settings, and lighting techniques. Readers then witness as he takes the photos from each shoot through the entire workflow process, to the final output of the 16\"x20\" prints. And, because he incorporates Photoshop seamlessly right into this workflow, you'll learn some of the latest Photoshop techniques for portrait and landscape photography as well. If you're one of those people who learns best by actually doing the projects yourself; who learns best without all the complicated technical explanations and confusing jargon, and if you really want to start using Lightroom today to unlock the productivity secrets of \"The new digital photography workflow,\"---there is no faster, more \"straight-to-the-point\" or more fun way to learn than this groundbreaking new book, and you are absolutely going to love it!","inCitations":["8111937cbef431627324e8cdc97b128316afbb45"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"The Adobe Photoshop Lightroom 2 Book for Digital Photographers","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

They may present with respiratory failure and pulmonary hypertension (PH) in the newborn. Long-term outcomes are different according to the mutations. We present an infrequent case, diagnosed in a tertiary hospital, who has survived. A term female Arabian infant was born via spontaneous vaginal delivery. Mother and father were consanguineous. Immediately after birth, the infant developed respiratory distress and was initially managed with continuous positive airway pressure. Her physical examination was notable for bilateral coarse breath sounds and generalized thoracic retractions. Chest radiograph demonstrated diffuse bilateral granular opacities. An echocardiogram revealed no evidence of anatomic heart disease with suprasystemic levels of pulmonary artery pressure. Over the next days, her gas exchange worsened, needing intubation and mechanical ventilation. She developed progressive hypoxic respiratory failure that needed high frequency oscillatory ventilation, and nitric oxide administration. The infant was treated with antibiotics but infectious causes for PH were ruled out with negative blood cultures. Chest computer tomography (Fig. 1) at 15 days of life showed bilateral granular opacities and ground-glass opacification; two doses of surfactant were administered without improvement. Bronchoscopic bronchoalveolar lavage detected PAS positive material. With this information, a lung biopsy trough video thoracoscopy was performed. There were marked alveolar epithelial hyperplasia and mild widening of alveolar walls and the suspicion of a genetic disorder of surfactant dysfunction was considered. She still needed mechanical ventilation and take away a treatment with monthly high intravenous doses of methylprednisolone in association with oral daily hydroxychloroquine and every other day azithromycin. Genetic testing showed a nonsense mutation in ABCA3 gene, c.4681C>T or p.R1561X. This mutation was present on both maternal and paternal alleles. At 7 months of age the infant was transferred to a pediatric lung transplant unit where she underwent bilateral lung transplantation at 10 months of age. Currently she is 2 years old needing home mechanical ventilation support because of tracheal and right main bronchus malacia. Interstitial lung diseases (ILD) are a heterogeneous group of pathological processes that affect pulmonary parenchyma and, in most cases, lead to an impairment of gas transfer and reduction of the lung capacity. There are no reliable estimates, but prevalence is likely <1 per 100 000.1","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://www.archbronconeumol.org/index.php?p=revista&pii=S1579212918303951&tipo=pdf-simple"],"title":"ABCA3 deficiency in a newborn with respiratory failure","doi":"10.1183/1393003.congress-2017.pa4169","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1183/1393003.congress-2017.pa4169","venue":""}

Recent molecular studies are generating an emerging picture of the origin of its biota, yet very little is known regarding their phylogeographic structure or on the factors promoting diversification within the archipelago. Here we aimed to obtain a detailed depiction of the genetic structure and evolution of one of the most widespread vertebrate groups in the archipelago: the day-geckos of the genus Phelsuma. In parallel, we aimed to infer divergence times between species and subspecies, testing a long-standing hypothesis that argues for different time since sympatry between species as the cause of their different morphological differentiation across the archipelago.ResultsMolecular data corroborated the existence of two main lineages, corresponding to the two currently recognized species. Divergences between species likely date back to the Mio-Pliocene, while more recent, Pleistocenic, divergences are suggested within each species. Populations from outer islands share mtDNA haplotypes with inner island populations, suggesting very recent dispersals (or introductions). We found no evidence of current gene flow between species, but results pointed to the possibility of gene flow between (now allopatric) subspecies. Time estimates suggest a synchronous divergence within each species (between island groups).ConclusionsThe geographic patterns of genetic variation agree with previous taxonomic subdivisions within each species and the origin of outer islands populations is clearly tracked. The similar intraspecific divergence time estimates obtained suggest that the differential body-size differentiation between species within each group of islands may be driven by factors other than character displacement proportional to time since sympatry, as previously suggested. These factors could include different habitats/resources available within each island group, niche differentiation and/or character displacement. We also bring again into consideration the hypothesis of body size being influenced by the distribution of native vegetation and social systems within this group, although it remains to be tested. Our results highlight not only the necessity of clarifying the role of ecology and interspecific interactions in this group’s morphological diversification and community assemblage, but also the importance of co-evolutionary mechanisms and their importance for appropriate conservation of island biodiversity. Further, we provide a detailed description of the phylogeographic structure of these taxa across these islands, which still remain poorly characterized in this respect.","inCitations":["4994e6a995f3913131a2940605be883b09756fc1","4ef24c8d8d5301ff3d3881b22a23d7af23c9dff2","6fd3e45771b5d5fb32254e7a33d542e2ebe052a4","1d11916ae6c22cda5910d7d242a18a5eb9f25b4d","ca75e612c1e8f488485498d50c922537211d7770","0d515658012d887bea494c3887a20794973f4d3a","673f2d1a8b94a25df7ca81fe5577c4af4c563ead","af3bbedd74b429cdd124dcedfde214480c2aa04e"],"pdfUrls":["http://bmcevolbiol.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/1471-2148-13-3?site=bmcevolbiol.biomedcentral.com"],"title":"Phylogeography and diversification history of the day-gecko genus Phelsuma in the Seychelles islands","doi":"10.1186/1471-2148-13-3","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2148-13-3","venue":"BMC Evolutionary Biology"}

These bacteria are equipped with an arsenal of virulence factors, such as siderophores and adhesins enabling UPECs to sufficiently colonize the urinary tract of humans and animals. Such virulence factors manipulate and impair the recognition of UPECs by the host's innate immune system. Among those, factors like the TIR domain containing proteins in E. coli (TcpC) have been described to interfere with the Toll-like receptor 4 signaling cascade. Nevertheless, some UPECs such as strain UTI89 lack TcpC, but also manipulate the innate immune response. By a random mutant-library approach we identified the galU gene of strain UTI89 to be responsible for a reduced immune response of macrophages. Consequently, we created a site directed knockout mutant of the galU gene in strain UTI89. This mutant caused a significantly increased cytokine response when co-incubated with J774A.1 macrophages. This phenotype could be recomplemented in trans by insertion of a galU-expressing plasmid. No differences in the viability of macrophages co-incubated with either the wild-type (WT) or the ΔgalU mutant strain could be observed. Nor could any growth impairment be detected in the ΔgalU mutant compared to WT strain. Hence, the increased cytokine response was not due to differences in the bacterial cytotoxicity or bacterial counts in the assay. Our results also demonstrated a reduction of intracellular counts of UTI89ΔgalU in the infection model. We were able to show a loss of the O-polysaccharide side chain of the ΔgalU mutant LPS. A comparable LPS structure could be generated by the deletion of the waaL gene in the UTI89. This also caused an impaired immune modulation. In contrast, purified LPS was not sufficient to impair cytokine release of macrophages. Moreover, no differences could be detected by applying bacteria inactivated with heat or formalin treatment. From this, we assume that the aberration of the LPS structure caused by the knockout of the galU gene is an important but not the exclusive cause for the loss of UPEC's immune modulating properties.","inCitations":["79e7ead3bba7d0a819d80cbec6666c5abe44493e","63ebfcaf59b698e6c26bc63a5364895e2098bd90","ec1059f5f8e1bc49ec7249a38d0daa487d5b1ccb","c12eaecb79807b9dde78d620c942d96732a8a982"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"The role of the galU gene of uropathogenic Escherichia coli in modulating macrophage TNF-α response.","doi":"10.1016/j.ijmm.2015.09.004","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijmm.2015.09.004","venue":"International journal of medical microbiology : IJMM"}

Trimenon wegen Verdachts auf schwangerschaftsinduzierte Hypertonie (SIH) und maternale Tachykardie uberwiesen. Untersuchungen: Periphere Schilddrusenhormone und TSH waren erhoht, TRAK negativ. Es bestand der Verdacht auf das Vorliegen eines TSH-sezernierenden Hypophysenadenoms (Differentialdiagnose: Schilddrusenhormonresistenz). Eine mogliche, kontrastmittelgestutzte MRT-Untersuchung wurde diskutiert, in Anbetracht fehlender Hirndrucksymptomatik ausgesetzt und nur fur den Fall einer Verschlechterung der Situation vorbehalten. Definitiv sollte diese Untersuchung post partum erfolgen. Die Perimetrie war unauffallig. Therapie und Verlauf: Die Therapie mit Propylthiouracil 3 × 50 mg/Tag wurde eingeleitet. Die peripheren Schilddrusenparameter normalisierten sich nicht vollstandig, fielen aber in den oberen normnahen Bereich. TSH blieb erwartungsgemas erhoht. Jedoch besserte sich die klinische Symptomatik der Schwangeren. Die Entbindung erfolgte normal. Das gesunde eutrophe Neugeborene wurde voll gestillt. Die postpartale MRT-Untersuchung wies ein 5 × 8 mm groses Hypophysenadenom nach. Folgerung: Bei Schwangeren mit SIH ist differenzialdiagnostisch eine Hyperthyreose auszuschliesen (Bestimmung von fT3, fT4, TSH, TRAK). Als seltene Ursachen einer Hyperthyreose mussen TSHom und Schilddrusenhormonresistenz in Betracht gezogen werden (TRAK negativ). Die Standardtherapie einer Hyperthyreose in der Schwangerschaft erfolgt mit PTU max. 50–200 mg/Tag. Thiamazol ist wegen des potentiellen embryotoxischen Risikos im I. Trimenon kontraindiziert.

The present study evaluates the efficacy of a fluorescent, anti-carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) nanobody for rapid tumor labeling in an orthotopic mouse model of pancreatic cancer.\n\n\nMETHODS\nAnti-CEA or control nanobodies were conjugated with the near-infrared fluorophore IRDye 800CW. Fragments of BxPC-3 (high-CEA expressing) or MiaPACA-2 (low-CEA expressing) human pancreatic cancer cell lines were orthotopically implanted into the pancreatic tail of nude mice. After tumors reached 7 to 10 mm in size, 2 nmol anti-CEA or control nanobody-IRDye800CW were injected intravenously. Mice were imaged at various time points hours post-injection.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAnti-CEA nanobodies clearly labeled BxPC3 orthotopic pancreatic tumors 3 hours after injection. The signal was present as early as 15 minutes after injection and was robust at 1 to 3 hours after injection with a tumor-to-background ratio of 2.66. In contrast, there was very low accumulation in the low CEA-expressing, MiaPACA2 pancreatic orthotopic tumors. The fluorophore-conjugated nanobody was specific for CEA-expressing tumors, while the control nanobody did not show any tumor-specific signal. Both nanobodies had strong kidney uptake as expected for small-molecule probes. The fluorescence signal was detectable using 2 clinical, Food and Drug Administration-approved, 800 nm imaging devices as well as small animal imaging systems.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThis anti-CEA, nanobody-based, fluorescent probe labeled pancreatic orthotopic tumors within 15 minutes of intravenous injection. Fluorescent anti-CEA nanobodies have labeling kinetics that approach the speed of nonspecific dyes such as indocyanine green but with the specificity of antibodies. The use of fluorescently-labeled, intact antibodies leads to a labeling delay of 48 to 96 hours between probe administration and the necessarily delayed time of operation, which can be avoided with nanobodies. The kinetics of a nanobody-based probe makes it a practical agent for same-day, patient administration and fluorescence-guided surgery.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Tumor-specific near-infrared nanobody probe rapidly labels tumors in an orthotopic mouse model of pancreatic cancer.","doi":"10.1016/j.surg.2020.02.020","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.surg.2020.02.020","venue":"Surgery"}

In the present study, we investigated the antifungal activities of 1444-nm Nd:YAG lasers against onychomycosis by microbiologic analysis and scanning electron microscopy. Scraped toenails from 20 participants with mycologically confirmed onychomycosis were prepared on polystyrene weighing dishes and treated with a 1444-nm Nd:YAG laser. The samples were analyzed for the presence of colony-forming units (CFUs) and scanning electron microscopy was performed using an toenail treated with the 1444-nm Nd:YAG laser. The mean reduction rate achieved by treatment with a total energy of 300 J was 75.9% (range: 33.3-100), and by treatment with 450 J was 85.5% (range: 66.7-100). However, the difference in CFU reduction rates between the laser settings of 300 J and 450 J was not significant. Analysis by scanning electron microscope revealed numerous disintegrated spores on the lower portions of the nail plate treated with the 1444-nm laser, while the upper portion of the nail plate presented only a few small and greatly disintegrated fungal spores. Our results suggest that a Nd:YAG laser with a wavelength of 1444 nm has antifungal effects on onychomycosis. However, further investigations should be performed to determine the long-term clinical and microbiologic effects of this treatment.","inCitations":["e826390b424340fdf82115defc7e8cf59052e9e3","b28044d1031c382a395e110726633ead740f7461","4443f41ee2a0a7f04c3a3233b5fef328f703b439","65d772e25b4c118ce2089e84d49e9b67b26a4afd","f42cfafd4bd94d9a7322581817a830b015d7ec1c","37804381b287a6b5038d85cc9aa1963d3c3d278d","4343095c7bccfee837486f978cdd0837d2969f5e","26ba1eec2b91f285fcffc35199e5cc09bb54518b"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Antifungal effects of a 1444-nm neodymium:Yttrium-aluminum-garnet laser on onychomycosis: a pilot study.","doi":"10.3109/09546634.2012.714455","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.3109/09546634.2012.714455","venue":"The Journal of dermatological treatment"}

Twelve of the patients had a history of sports injuries, 5 had shoulder injuries during working time, and 1 had a traffic accident. Among them, 18 had shoulder pain, 15 had limitation of range of motion (ROM) of shoulder, 18 had positive apprehension test and 5 had positive speed test. Three patients had Hill-Satch lesion in X-ray. Double contrast CT: I degree: 1; II degree: 15; III degree: 2. On arthroscopic view, 18 had anterior glenoid labrum detachment, 4 had anterior capsular laxity, 4 had combined superior labral anterior posterior (SLAP) injury, 3 had free body, 2 had humeral head or glenoid cartilage lesion. Anterior glenoid labrum detachment in 18 patients was reduced and sutured by the fixed anchor technique, 3 had anterior capsule shrinkage, 2 had debridement of frayed long head tendon of biceps, and 2 had reattachment of the long head tendon of biceps outside the capsule. SLAP injuries were sutured in 3 and debridement of frayed superior labrum in 1.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAll of the patients were followed up with an average of 18 months (10 - 32 months). All the patients felt free of the pain of their shoulder, except one felt shoulder aching after strenuous exercise. The loss of the external-rotation of the operated shoulder was less than 20 degrees in 2 patients and the posterior extension was 10 degrees in 1 patient. One patient had a positive result of Apprehension Sign. UCLA score: 14 +/- 3 preoperatively, 32 +/- 5 postoperatively (t = 14.081, P < 0.01). All patients returned to pre-injured sports activities and original work.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nTraumatic anterior shoulder instability can obtain good effects when treated with the arthroscopic surgery of shoulder. Complete reduction, and reliable fixation of the anterior glenoid labrum complex is the key point. Fixation with the suture anchor is reliable and makes the operation simple.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"[Arthroscopic surgery on traumatic anterior instability of shoulder].","doi":"","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"Zhonghua wai ke za zhi [Chinese journal of surgery]"}

The proteins are structural homologs, and are highly conserved among species. Although no homology has been detected with other heparin-binding growth factors, their functional similarity to members of the fibroblast growth factor (FGF) family is remarkable. PTN and MK are expressed during embryogenesis, showing an expression pattern that suggests functions in neurogenesis, cell migration, secondary organogenetic induction, and mesoderm-epithelial interaction. The widespread downregulation of PTN and MK in the adult human is reverted in a number of cancers, in which polypeptides are able to act as both transforming growth factors and promoters of angiogenesis. Elucidating the molecular mechanisms of PTN and MK action could lead not only to a deeper understanding of developmental processes, but also to the ultimate identification of targets for tumor therapy.","inCitations":["55e37796d735c6fc438c60fad5ec9882b18df594","81c06738c1054f1fdfd2853686228db2bdac8556","930400e1afaa9b30cfaaa2cefc71f3379828dc1f","d08f2e0b4c127fea96dc6fd12b9def7067f47484","8cf52a39943cd4b420be4da634f06758671f56b1","ea76f0f899a701e34c0dc8765897cf2d8df8cee8","d04c45ee9f8d544f222f00f6ce72d572da224273","6eccc4e9f9a6ff42e758e419609a08fa3121674d","d769eb9fd919cf098cc0b5622f25c60e4f729774","c248fbe602077fb7f5e7152c7500d2f139acfedc","0ee5cf096d16a75d2c592c5a8f1791f561719db6","093d1bdbf87447cc8071dfb5ac13c422f87f5208","1d60ab28be5fb6837daa3548fdd14f0fac7d78e6","47a9bde97d3804f7718aa18d668d66348befc30e","ae360283eabe90d5288c2eaf651061a244fe3e91","5c11b969c382dbb21cb28029a711a13fcc9ebbb2","61d3c345f76e62a4adc30ea951c3ce6d99352858","850d5575d2aa06d96fab8e82407b664e756b5d13","adabab551938df8148809163e04a91feb8749e5d","4728a46781a406943eddd92c9ba2ab06d9125531","816f6e7732c4a15025b872bd2ee59d98a4de5b29","b1aaeb0c2a148b8d751dbe76172d22ae2798d363","2661cce6bf827a996178d84202e3e0c5507a54cd","7785a6c8f2f976e4f6ceff10d5b1e4036174eb93","29920c80d2f6fb2d29648c829950c23f32a2701c","513b805c6065f949037310ba15f1513fc419c5b0","0717a725c171bc34d4db1f100f1acd19c6ed8274","913b3f54a0d836ba852d80afbe25b586a6a93e52","37308176c22f74db384ca403292980e49c51388b","687d0de681f317057763fdcdcca036f0f54a8a13","26b699349033c96ea2504222075dd788eaaa6caa","8aeb6a3d543ef98d22fb7d4a58832e00c1322bad","4f0a23e7b708148456904c580c94efe9b2bbede7","95d908fabbf09a2e41373f6537ffe19e238de683","98dc00e4d8a1cc43c1658ec5d2046339fb67a98e","7cc88f3e4a8a73b1ea51ef7cb75a166323c5676d","1664c2362636fca2142e6c633ecda7143b7c9915","94123c7b809a090ea1fc3ec14acd4b54297f3434","08782fd45dcf2191129b64ecc4b1ee692566c316"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Pleiotrophin and midkine in normal development and tumor biology.","doi":"","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"Critical reviews in oncogenesis"}

This study was designed to investigate the molecular characterisation of Campylobacter gotten from cultural methods in Osun State. Campylobacters isolated were biochemically characterized and biotyped. Confirmation of Campylobacter was done using flaA gene, hippuricase O for Campylobacter jejuni and aspartokinase gene for Campylobacter coli and single locus sequencing glnA gene were performed by PCR. Twenty five samples were amplified by PCR out of 57 Campylobacter strains that were positive for cultural methods from 815 stool samples with diarrhoea and 100 stool samples without diarrhoea. No Campylobacter was isolated from stools of children in the control group. Twenty-five isolates comprising of 18 Campylobater jejuni and 7 C. coli were identified. The nucleotide sequence of the gln A for all the isolated Campylobacter spp. showed 91.0% similarity with the ones in the GenBank. The C. jejuni was classified into biotypes I (44.4%) and II (55.6%) and all C. coli were of biotype I.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://www.scirp.org/pdf/OJMM_2019021216585199.pdf"],"title":"Molecular Identification of Campylobacter Species from Positive Cultural Stool Samples of Diarrhoeic Children in Osun State","doi":"10.4236/ojmm.2019.91002","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.4236/ojmm.2019.91002","venue":""}

It is believed that this is the result of thermal cycling during the hot working. In order to obtain basic information for a reasonable design and working of such material, a series of thermal fatigue tests have been made under large amplitude of temperature. In the present study, particular attention has been directed to the effect that the rapid change of deformability of the present material owing to the temperature level will have on the thermal fatigue characteristics. Attention has been paid also to microscopic observations of nucleation and propagation of thermal crack.From the present experiments the following conclusions are marked:(1) Thermal crack nucleates at the crevice of the scale on the surface of the specimen, in case of rich ductility and of fine structure (grain) of the material. The crack at early period grows by repetition of oxidation and at the latter period it propagates under thermal stress cycling. In case of coarse structure (grain) and of poor ductility, the crack propagates rapidly along the austenite grain boundary.(2) Thermal fatigue life of the material, of which ductility is much dependent on the temperature level, is approximately estimated from the information of static tensile tests of the same material at various temperature levels. This is expressed as[ΣNfN=1(Δep)2]1/2=1/√2ef*=1/√2∫T2T1ef(T)dT/T2-T1, orNf1/2(Δep)=1/√2ef*=1/√2∫T2T1ef(T)dT/T2-T1, where Δep is plastic strain range, Nf the number of cycles to fracture, T2 and T1 the upper and lower temperature levels, ef(T) tensile elongation at temperature level T. The latter equation holds in case of constant range of plastic strain during the thermal fatigue test.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Cr-Mo-V鋼の熱疲労","doi":"10.2472/jsms.14.158","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.2472/jsms.14.158","venue":""}

Recent experimental studies have shown that both fibrillation and defibrillation have a common electrophysiologic mechanism that is based on the interaction between the electrical field stimulus and ventricular repolarization. Ventricular fibrillation will be induced if the field stimulus is applied with the area of vulnerability, this area of vulnerability is defined two dimensionally by the shock coupling interval and shock strength, and is modified by the configuration of the shock. A field shock that is applied within the area of vulnerability causes heterogeneity of ventricular repolarization immediately after the shock (postshock dispersion), thereby enabling the development of circuit movements and reentry, and resulting in ventricular fibrillation. High energy shocks, however, that are applied above the area of vulnerability (i.e., above the upper limit of vulnerability) will not induce ventricular fibrillation due to homogeneous prolongation of repolarization and a resulting small postshock dispersion. In analogy, ventricular fibrillation will continue after unsuccessful low-energy defibrillation shocks due to high postshock dispersion, whereas a high-energy shock will synchronize ventricular repolarization, thereby causing small postshock dispersion and termination of ventricular fibrillation. This paper describes the relation between fibrillation, defibrillation and ventricular repolarization based on experimental findings. A possible clinical application of these findings is that the upper limit of vulnerability may be used as a surrogate for the defibrillation threshold. Thus, defibrillation threshold testing may not be necessary during future implantations of automatic cardioverter defibrillators. Seit langem ist bekannt, dass Kammerflimmern durch elektrische Feldschocks sowohl induziert als auch terminiert werden kann. Neuere Befunde zeigen, dass beide Phänomene einem gemeinsamen elektrophysiologischen Mechanismus unterliegen, der auf der Interaktion zwischen dem elektrischen Feldschock und der ventrikulären Repolarisation beruht. Kammerflimmern wird dann induziert, wenn der Feldschock innerhalb eines Vulnerabilitätsareals abgegeben wird, das zweidimensional durch Kopplungsintervall und Schockstärke definiert und von der Schockkonfiguration beeinflusst wird. Ein innerhalb des Vulnerabilitätsareals abgegeben Feldschock verursacht eine hohe Heterogenität der ventrikulären Repolarisation (Postschock-Dispersion), die die Entstehung kreisender Erregungen und damit Kammerflimmern ermöglicht. Dagegen können hochenergetische Schocks ausserhalb des Vulnerabilitätsareals (d.h. Schocks oberhalb der oberen Vulnerabilitätsgrenze) Kammerflimmern nicht mehr induzieren, da die Postschock-Dispersion durch eine weitgehend homogene Verlängerung der Repolarisation nicht mehr ausreichend groß ist. Analog persistiert Kammerflimmern nach einem erfolglosen Defibrillationsschock (d.h. bei niedriger Schockstärke) infolge einer hohen Postschock-Dispersion, während ein hochenergetischer Schock dagegen eine Synchronisation der ventrikulären Repolarisation und somit eine niedrige Postschock-Dispersion zur Folge hat mit dem Ergebnis einer Terminierung der Kammerflimmerns. Die vorliegende Arbeit beschreibt auf dem Boden experimenteller Befunde diese Zusammenhänge zwischen Fibrillation, Defibrillation und der ventrikulären Repolarisation. Ein potentieller klinischer Nutzen ist darin zu sehen, dass auf Grund des gemeinsamen Mechanismus und der resultierenden engen Korrelation zwischen Defibrillationsschwelle (DFT) und oberer Vulnerabilitätsgrenze die Bestimmung der DFT bei der Defibrillatorimplantation in Zukunft nicht mehr notwendig sein könnte.","inCitations":["0feceeabb1316763dbd03106245912a404014faf"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Mechanismus der Induktion und Terminierung von Kammerflimmern – Bedeutung der Dispersion der ventrikulären Repolarisation","doi":"10.1007/s003920070137","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s003920070137","venue":"Zeitschrift für Kardiologie"}

The aim of this study is to check the validity of Ricardian Equivalence Hypothesis and its sources of deviation in case of Pakistan. The study use annual data for the period of 1973-2009. Engle and Granger and Johansen cointegration approaches depicts the long run relationship among variables. Generalized Method of Moment results shows that the presence of liquidity constraints and infinite horizons are the sources of failure of Ricardian Equivalence Hypothesis. These findings illustrate concentration towards the importance of fiscal policies in raising private consumption and controlling budget deficits, which are the prime goals of stabilization policies.","inCitations":["771cbd30d43520346c1b9b1421eaee7af49c3dde","9e904fec5e93586506997237ace5043d344e0d80","9253ec319fc703c5ded1f1e90f7ebb9713209dff","0c5dc5a01f117744077b8f68aa09a753525de46f"],"pdfUrls":["https://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/32044/1/MPRA_paper_32044.pdf"],"title":"We are Living on the Cost of Our Children","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

This study investigates the interactions of a nine-year-old child whose home language is Portuguese and who learns science in this specific case in a diglossic environment in the Luxembourgish school system, in which his teacher used German for written tasks and Luxembourgish for oral communication. We examine, moment-by-moment, the interactions around a task regarding environmental protection. The role of this Lusoburguês (Luxembourgish and Portuguese identities and nationalities combined) student and his embodiment and participation changes when his group is confronted with an activity that requires an increased amount of manipulation. His identity evolves in interaction, as he becomes the leader in his group, and through a playful stance, manages to open the task so that his peers can further explore. Implications include the value of including more open-ended investigations in the teaching and learning of science as well as implications for further study concerning practice-based approaches in science classrooms with CLD students, particularly in increasingly multilingual/cultural and/or diglossic or heteroglossic school contexts.","inCitations":["a8cacaa5fd68d561b45631bf932e9b5b725880ad"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"‘Opening up’ a science task: an exploration of shifting embodied participation of a multilingual primary student","doi":"10.1080/09500693.2018.1447709","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1080/09500693.2018.1447709","venue":""}

In this project design was selected and the three dimensional design of the final design was made using CATIA (version 5) software, after which the equipment was fabricated using brass. This air tight experimental setup is developed to measure conductivity as a function of temperature and partial pressure. With this setup conductivity is measured using four probe method. Four probe arrangement is made using platinum wires passing through the alumina tube. Conductivity measurement as a function of temperature will give electronic conductivity of the sample. Using the same experimental setup, conductivity relaxation measurement is done to study oxygen transport properties of mixed oxides. Conductivity measurement with respect to partial pressure will give ionic conductivity of the sample. A mixed ionic and electronic conducting oxide i.e., La0.5Sr0.5Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ (LSCF) powder is synthesized by combustion synthesis. Powder samples were calcined at 6500C with a dwell time of 4hrs resulted in phase purity. High dense samples were obtained by sintering at 12500C for 2hrs. Data acquisition of the setup has been done by using the LABVIEW software. Activation energy of charge carrier is calculated by linear fitting the conductivity data. From conductivity relaxation data we are able to calculate chemical diffusion coefficient and surface exchange coefficient. Finally activation energy, bulk oxygen diffusion, surface oxygen reaction rate constant are calculated.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Development of Experimental setup for Electricalconductivity Measurement as a Function of Temperature and Oxygen Partial Pressure","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

T h e United States has a much larger drug problem than the United K i n g d o m and has also the legal complication in regulating misuse of drugs that there is a Federal law governing d r u g abuse (whose antecedents are explained by the author) as well as legislation in all 50 States. T h e current Federal Statute is the 1970 Drug Abuse and Control Act 21 U S C 801 tt seq. and at the time of writing 22 of the States have adopted its provisions. T h e author has summarized the law in each of the States with a commentary on the offences and their punishments which vary widely from one jurisdiction to another. From a comparat ive lawyer's point of view there is much of interest even though the subject matter is so technical. O f rather more general interest is the chapter on enforcement and the procedural and evidential problems which have beset enforcement of drug laws in the United States. T h e effect of the Supreme Court decision in M a p p V . Ohio (367 U S 643 1961) which overruled Wolf v. Colorado (328 U S 25 1949) on prosecution of offences is described. T h e upshot is that, in contrast to the position in Britain, in the United States the admission of illegally obtained evidence is refused to protect an accused's rights under the 4th amendment of the Uni ted States Constitution.

We argue that the endangerment of the Voro language has, in part, helped to propel it into particular spaces—the 2011 national census and public schools—where it is publicly defined and in some cases positioned as an asset. In both sites—the census and the schools—the language had historically been overlooked, ignored or disregarded. By drawing on 2014 qualitative interview data with Voro-language teachers and discourse analysis of pre- and post-2011 census-related texts from newspapers, we find that the twenty-first century marks the first time Voro has broadly been named, constructed and categorized into an official category.

Patients were stratified according to the Morise clinical score (low, intermediate, high) and to the CTCA findings [absence of coronary artery disease (CAD), nonobstructive CAD, obstructive CAD]. Patients were followed up for the occurrence of major events: cardiac death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, unstable angina and revascularisation.ResultsOne hundred and twenty-seven (87.6%) patients were without a history of CAD, and 18 (12.4%) patients had a history of CAD. Obstructive CAD (>50% luminal narrowing) was detected in 35 (24%) patients; nonobstructive CAD (≤50% luminal narrowing) in 62 (43%) and absence of CAD in 48 (33%) patients. During a mean follow-up of 20±3 months, 20 events occurred (four hard events). Sixteen events (three hard events) occurred in patients without a history of CAD, and four events (one hard event) occurred in patients with a history of CAD. In patients with absence of CAD as detected by CTCA, the rate of events was 0%. At multivariate analysis, hypercholesterolaemia and obstructive CAD were significant predictors of events (p<0.05).ConclusionsAn excellent prognosis was observed in patients with ACP and normal CTCA. CTCA shows the potential for optimal stratification of patients with ACP.RiassuntoObiettivoScopo di questo lavoro è valutare il valore prognostico della angiografia coronarica mediante tomografia computerizzata (CTCA) in pazienti con dolore toracico acuto (ACP)Materiali e metodiCentoquarantacinque pazienti (75 maschi; 64±12 anni) consecutivi con ACP sono stati inviati a CTCA dal dipartimento di emergenza. La CTCA è stata effettuata con tecnica standard ed uno scanner a 64 strati. I pazienti sono stati stratificati secondo lo score di Morise (basso, intermedio, alto) e la CTCA (assenza di coronary artery disease [CAD], CAD non ostruttiva, CAD ostruttiva). I pazienti sono stati seguiti per l’occorrenza di eventi maggiori: morte cardiaca, infarto miocardico non fatale, angina instabile e rivascolarizzazioneRisultatiCentoventisette (87,6%) pazienti non avevano storia di CAD e 18 (12,4%) pazienti avevano storia di CAD. È stata rilevata CAD ostruttiva (riduzione del lume >50%) in 35 (24%) pazienti; CAD non ostruttiva (riduzione del lume ≤50%) in 62 (43%) pazienti e assenza di CAD in 48 (33%) pazienti. Durante un follow-up medio di 20±3 mesi, abbiamo riscontrato 20 eventi (4 eventi hard). Sedici eventi (3 eventi hard) si sono verificati in pazienti senza storia di CAD e 4 eventi (1 evento hard) si è verificato nei pazienti con storia di CAD. Nei pazienticon assenza di CAD secondo la CTCA la frequenza di eventi è stata pari allo 0%. All’analisi multivariata, l’ipercolesterolemia e la CAD ostruttiva sono risultati predittori significativi di eventi (p<0,05)ConclusioniNei pazienti con ACP la CTCA conferisce prognosi ottima alle coronarie esenti da CAD. La CTCA ha il potenziale per una ottimale stratificazione del rischio nei pazienti con ACP","inCitations":["6fd07874124ae88ea95906edc5abe2647e087fa7","b4cb3ddf6a37ad2f8c79714deea6518fa76d8474","83c7e4d2917a03f739019302d0c9b508c29afea1","aa028485e654842ed6001fa82142a6751cb42b84","935308e0c74f13828389bc3e3efd4e04bd2c4aba","5c95961e92ab62292b3b2fe27e4def2b94d34540","e63be2cf9c7b21378c0839caea53421e2350dcf8","555c9c65d500e7869d763e2f42393da3b0e1016b","753e2746b9ce27357f3e4a18c8b969817a867825","b563586188fa96781c8f62ff50e8536ce90e5138","873247ce1f8f27e27c0e194a4287d7c28f741bf0"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Prognostic value of computed tomography coronary angiography in patients with chest pain of suspected cardiac origin","doi":"10.1007/s11547-011-0647-z","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11547-011-0647-z","venue":"La radiologia medica"}

Brain systems such as the cerebellum receive inputs from other systems and generate outputs according to their internal rules of information processing. Thus, our understanding of the cerebellum is ultimately best expressed in terms of the information processing it accomplishes and how cerebellar neurons and synapses produce this processing. We review evidence that indicates how Pavlovian eyelid conditioning reveals cerebellar processing to be an example of feedforward control. Eyelid conditioning demonstrates a capacity for learning in the cerebellum that is error driven, associative and temporally specific--as is required for feedforward control. This computation-centered view is consistent with a variety of proposed functions of the cerebellum, including sensory-motor integration, motor coordination, motor learning and timing. Moreover, feedforward processing could be the common link between motor and non-motor functions of the cerebellum.","inCitations":["f8031f601adc92bf8231349e936c3434d9517383","d7caa1550c515ff307f0267cb156dde5fdb934d4","879311e1c8c998decbec91054b8caaf21d2db77a","d90f1eb545b473879d9143a97f662c137b8f5753","f796f4a748d896f2282ce316a5c390e4459a6314","95a11e0c0763268c891e9450f1f09397b6e3ad00","1508b644838c6e847357433a2e89f97005362641","c1b89df2b224c763c8406130d4c7181de2375e34","2739e25318eea0baab26a6711ef4f243a95a02f0","0a262f933c7c9d625cf4af9ac06610211c9cb57b","e69415343bd4ae9041405e77b837b7407e9b81d3","1c6ff63665b57815674ce63d2b361959d70da019","b9209f65a2c812d9e6d894eb7263ac0042e2342a","b29202e81726066758aa978ab34b581bf9a4c6dc","a05b6b537d1d6d254be068948cd03d4e180a92c9","19a30ad283f2ab2d84f1c666d17492da14056d75","5d173f191f3e179a91193fdbdfca59dbe8a5d724","2a8e868904e5f2cfee02c3558e322cb0e8868d1f","0c922cd9218be5258852155eb9c928c5f92e8511","ee41f3f9a7adb787397aa48eb3a9515e8d470665","bb462d35edb6769baf16fa033054b6a2fea5e45e","fac52d64492f0af3ac42ce70d2a223b2bfafd44a","9e266b01e0b7f84ad746637b60e756dfae6a5040","d408be67334b1e81eabad4d8786040b5effcb15b","99955ce0e457ccb5276ef6520ea6442000810232","fefc920f07d701fa8913a1fa9af0126ec767cfff","51aa46d7ef7de70e83da6fa30c04924a3c967807","2022f4a586767c341fa45c89a1497adfbdf7a365","a349feb94fe2b1b0520710a36c475b98e52ce96f","4f44a807ee185937c6c3caa14274b11de0b8b05c","cf88da873f3b413431c30c1169ab4e0b120d06ce","7ff2b5610e60edd66cc0b9ca22e701d869222af5","acc98ad8e98b5c7631911b4f372eb4cd3239601d","80e244647460e81bda69c1197616a2059dd238d4","edecdeec1a149af6c893959d5f9d7ad11721da1e","83282b332efc5152348c5e8045d375bda2576574","84d4b942614314d7e42a6b3e0f16761cdcb16668","6b3ee7859eeef8571f1b0574e1b47e1a7a87c5f5","4d484689288196e34f0d1d32b74064955c0026ff","78f32fc428717a39072a73a241b611753379ae51","362ae1cad5db75e4c57ac052467be1b7e6a49d52","6131efaaecf353e46541d61535111d562b5e09f5","a14abf790f33b4814018996aa1c37d5a04344cd2","268a33ad2447861fad16646738e52ae9be261d7f","c188eb9d67d6148c28087b18f1762a160e04d134","45dab1edb990de9585c125a61c18028ae95b49ba","9b735570c4ff88af094ddd703d21c3183ec5a735","a2cb636c485811798f17ac6b5ae8efd15e510768","fd9a31063117f2ea8fef0b4f22fc5a5e5cf27534","1ee8098b949446b09f89f980f4553fa3cb7fabd3","dc30c42ea079cbc21650b0de5fc52728d3d393e8","8c55eee3d02b6d81a6101a78a44bf02b84455392","92b7fcee28abd68e8c0698cf3c17df5eb210083d","be791293f7573eacbd93b38e1c0f527e5e85bdf4","89add45c9caad711b1972a5dab9d3f83a1c40ae4","a36fa0e4a165c0573ab7201371e25ee2decbb7fa","c3ce5cfaca72e57f1f2e4864e5f27349b460f8df","1bf64bfa88a6742d534452d4143f3b4609cd271c","788ba6b840a79035b62b2dd4a64ded43e78b31fc","d49351c8c8f598e61821d8cd57bfc09ec1c8e302","10de0e402988471dcbcd5b5e7276f99214382504","5884cd86b4aa857b1ac0dca69e09f215c28be6cb","cf15a22838b689a861763417369b9f9f9761fcb0","a539c25e9ebfde7fb1208df2849f70fe3091dce8","aedcb0eae72a6420a32fa14de88b75f5ab3eb1d8","f7a4f07bd0a6a1c65152c056d9ac6a7f7e2bef0b","d4527e9fd58737e6dc57768bd0efa98188434d81","cced9252dd48522f0b0dbdaafd5d3e77ce6104fe","8ef35da43a40d23310d3366751aa13f080f735cd","403e51a20e9778fb3452fae1a68a3713d3c41b3a","44c4e254ab3439815f89a7bdb9bb4e12b73c1ff8","bc1523a24362a7c395b7852eec470f89bb5665f9","682ce7508d21447316f3a51883431fe1e4c5d51d","11c10cbcb658c39e06731fb0ff735dc57cbdf47d","c7d8f54e687e88f33f3fe5ef73248c8fbfbfa8e0","f962df569e9b079f7d17482cdf094cab40280224","2738f5307342cfdd24f2a71446587683d0c6e8c0","cd2a7eaa04df25c7326b22f0df5577f59240cd75","2af32829fb475d44d414203dd721fbabcf94c13f","09303286ae92be4a6116f976874bff0bfc5ae450","d17da8b7bafa4be77637373faf249ad3612a0497","603cca80b2af6689b14719d6dba238c9dd243023","ca504e5d95cc0db84f97098b53d70bcfc79cf462","666d1b4752909424427a5a0cea64d3572d83c30d","c7d779f9e93aa2b9152c587b0e8c88ffeb8b513a","836716b4d85397716f72277951d213a754c8a66c","23f72b3f467d6c25126a548538e985ebbeab709c","fdedb5b233e863fbfabd71441a5b2814d4a054a3","d1ed38da114a74d495a1d18331795dd5039cef76","43d75699788aeaf3a47fd0997d187e84e5f7b6a4","af68eba971dce7881ecc5bd14b446ed70ec54409","7c5224dc37022d54f91340ab16595b4148d450ae","f65535ff9c2bb9c17564c9b1870dab57f6e4c0ea","51e90957eb2dc013c359a63a14513928a37e6e00","500d1cab6ce513f4625f19b18934d7c883dc8ca5","092fe4bdbf89db8a75b6f68b037f15701036c8cf","272464c0fe3db49c9260e2b93546bc058c0f565c","a50cb834c56b8516e17e530e48185c8cb43870bd","8d9886f574e47a276e23aec9a467a552e4ae2e13","39ab3827807dd32484eedb41f1d9d8c88790ee1e","7d2ba7c890c0fa55aaddd806959bea841a3df384","fadf25750993564e785fa6846b7264842a8e8ed5","e593eb551b250b7decef635fa79196ecc75b87af","00f1229732d21b2a16971c384a13971a42c1b842","a968ddf629e43152ba4da0579d763f892dad02d6","cdb638bf3b805608040a1b139c552d200931d21d","db4a0dd62c7ec7533bf851d9d10b92684acfcea7","145876c97caaf3942ad150e0072590b2da7ab7c4","59d29038bcd5c82d11a7671975350956123d3500","24b917f16171f8fce23af1738c3ceec4b9a7e848","9d97eb07c36ce07cb1d9a29ee6b8e8afa51a1465","849be3c66c6231536ac0dc48d6359c8731e86d7b","fc5a8aaa3f43b9b6a5974cb7bca5a9972034cf25","5ed1fe1d12cbb40087686ac30b8179c22c158783","018fb6a2027f1427f5a66927f61dffa3718ca698","08d378b11f31e035d2cc0a54af

In the search for consistent and automated baseflow separation techniques, direct applicability to physical processes has been increasingly neglected. By way of contrast, this paper presents a continuous baseflow separation method that emphasises the physical relevance of the flow components, and demonstrates its performance. The proposed method combines the principle of an exponential master baseflow recession with a compatible smoothing function to link the segments of the master recession. Two calibrated parameters facilitate a good fit to a range of streamflow behaviours.","inCitations":["02dbde575db910c8a28bda25bfdca0a26885c392","7a3cae17ee0060e39201f1ec45ba8aa8291afdac"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Baseflow separation - A practical approach","doi":"10.1016/j.jhydrol.2019.05.040","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2019.05.040","venue":""}
