While the implications of such systems are widely debated, the use of performance measures within local school districts for budgetary decision-making has received relatively little attention. This study of school business officials finds that mandated performance measures, specifically standardized test scores, are important factors in budgetary decision-making but less influential than other factors. Variables that help explain the influence of mandated performance measures include district performance, socio-economic status, and the importance of community involvement in decision-making.","inCitations":["5c777bc880f785f400039b9a45645368a0da1d7f"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"From Accountability to Decision-Making?

Hidrostratigrafi adalah suatu model untuk menggambarkan stratum geologis penyusun akuifer, yang di dalamnya berisi informasi tentang karakteristik airtanah. Hidrokimia merupakan model untuk menelusur asal usul pembentukan airtanah, yang didasarkan pada analisis komposisi ion-ion penyusunnya. Penyusunan hidrostratigrafi didasarkan pada hasil pendugaan geolistrik, sedang penentuan tipe hidrokimia airtanah dengan metode Diagram Piper Segiempat ( Square Piper Diagram ). Penelitian ini dilakukan di sekitar lembah Rawa Jombor, Kecamatan Bayat, Kabupaten Klaten. Tujuan utama penelitian ini adalah : (a) mengetahui tipe akuifer dan tipe hidrokimia airtanah, dan (b) mengetahui faktor-faktor yang mempengaruhi variasi karakteristik airtanah dan asal usul airtanah payau/asin di daerah penelitian. Manfaat penelitian ini adalah sebagai dasar untuk menentukan lokasi dan kedalaman sumur bagi penyediaan sumber air bersih di daerah penelitian. Hasil penelitian menunjukkan bahwa lembah Rawa Jombor secara umum tersusu ole 2 tipe akuifer, yaitu akuifer bebas dan tertekan. Akuifer bebas meliputi akuifer bebas primer yang tersusun oleh endapan lempung pasiran volkan Merapi Muda, dan akuifer bebas sekunder yang tersusun oleh batugamping porous atay sekis-filit dengan banyak retakan dan sisipan kuarsa. Pada akuifer bebas primer banyak terdapat lensa-lensa airtanah payau-asin yang bervariatif antara satu tempat dengan tempat lain. Akuifer yang paling dalam adalah akuifer tertekan yang dibatasi oleh batuan malihan sekis-fill atau batugamping keras yang relatif kedap air. Pada umumnya akuifer tertekan terdapat di bagian timur rawa pada kedalaman >20 meter dan di bagian selatan rawa pada kedalaman >30 meter. Tipe hidrokimia airtanah di daerah penelitian dikelompokkan menjadi 5 tipe, yaitu tipe I (air bikarbonat, tawar), tipe II (air semi karbonat tawar), tipe III (air evaporite, payau-asin), tipe IV (air sulfat, payau), dan tipe Va yang merupakan awal pertukaran kation. Tipe III dan IV merupakan airtanah payau hingga asin yang banyak terdapat di bagian utara Rawa Jombor, yaitu di Tawang, Lebak, Bugel, dan Tanjungsari. Berdasarkan hidrostratigrafinya, airtanah kelompok ini merupakan lensa-lensa airtanah payau atau asin yang terdapat setempat-setempat pada akuifer bebas.","inCitations":["e185e1de0933ad3754dc0851e78246660c831aa1"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Hidrostratigrafi Dan Hidrokimia Airtanah Di Sekitar Rowo Jombor Kecamatan Bayat-klaten","doi":"10.22146/mgi.13224","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.22146/mgi.13224","venue":""}

In consequence, involved actors planners, institutions and communities must assume reflexive positions. Local government, acting in a planning capacity or as an active builder, generates an important impact on formal and spontaneous settlements in the city, which must be analyzed critically, due the effect those actions have on community life forms. The issue raises several aspects of deep concern for planning theory and praxis. Urban management is important for planning, because of its dynamic influence on urban quality, in its spatial, temporal economical and cultural dimensions. In this paper, the models of interventions of the public agency Simon Bolivar Centre, in the popular district of San Agustin del Sur in Caracas between 1960 and 1980 are examined. This analysis is relevant not only for academic purposes but also for guiding future interventions. The urban renovation process and its environmental repercussions are studied in order to delineate a more appropriate approach considered within a real context, and as a totality. In this way the goal is to achieve quality action, conceived as an interactive process, where the actors participate with roles clearly defined through time.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://www.etsav.upc.es/personals/iphs2004/pdf/179_p.pdf"],"title":"Government urban management in San Agustín, Caracas: ¿A never ending symbiotic process?","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

This was attributed to the large increase in net negative charge produced by the replacement of the positively charged ε-NH3+ groups of lysine residues by negatively charged-NHCOCH2CH2COO-groups. An intensive study of the specificity of this reaction and of its conformational effects was made by Cherry2 with the protein bovine serum albumin; the results have been briefly reported3. Utilizing these findings, Klotz and Keresztes-Nagy4 made the interesting observation that the electrostatic repulsions introduced by succinylation could result in the complete dissociation of non-covalently linked sub-units of proteins, in particular, those of haemerythrin, at neutral pH without the addition of any other dissociating agents such as urea or detergent. We have now shown that rabbit γ-globulin, succinylated either before or after partial reduction of interchain disulphide bonds5, can be separated into its constituent heavy and light peptide chains5,6 by gel-filtration in aqueous buffers at pH near neutrality without the use of detergents7. Furthermore, the isolated succinylated heavy and light chains are quite soluble in such buffers, whereas isolated but unmodified heavy chains are insoluble6.","inCitations":["5cd287b7e6bd2179ec5ad02e6dcc7368f40aea14","ac9b7ade143dd47ae190dc010af6594cb6cff03e","3a50d6ec94e59648181cf41cd8d0436e1bab6b1e"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Succinylation of Gamma Globulin","doi":"10.1038/210536a0","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1038/210536a0","venue":"Nature"}

Transplant recipients have multiple risk factors for delayed wound healing, such as use of corticosteroids and sirolimus, and the presence of uremia and diabetes mellitus. We report a rare occurrence of incisional hernia attributable to internal wound dehiscence after PD catheter placement in a patient on sirolimus.A 34-year-old Latino American man was started on PD training 4 weeks after placement of a PD catheter. Soon after completing training, he developed a large soft bulge close to the PD catheter, with expansile cough impulse suggestive of an incisional hernia filled with peritoneal dialysate. The size of the bulge would decrease after the dialysate was drained. No external leak of dialysate was evident along the exit site.Because of the size of the hernia and the history of it filling soon after dialysis exchange, the feeling was that wound dehiscence had occurred from the peritoneal side, resulting in a large incisional hernia. Because of the large size of the hernia within few weeks of starting PD, sirolimus was suspected to have induced poor wound healing, contributing to formation of the hernia.Sirolimus was stopped, and the patient underwent PD catheter removal and repair of the hernia. A new PD catheter was placed on the opposite side of the abdomen 10 days later. After another 6 weeks, the patient was started on PD. He has been doing well for the 15 months since then, with no recurrence of the hernia. Because he still had residual renal function, he continued to receive low-dose prednisone and mycophenolate sodium. At 10 months after PD start, he stopped the mycophenolate sodium on his own, and we did not resume it. He is still on low-dose prednisone.In end-stage renal disease resulting from failing renal transplantation or from calcineurin inhibitor nephropathy in solid-organ transplantation, sirolimus is a risk factor for wound dehiscence, development of incisional hernia, and peritoneal dialysate leak.Practical tips: Sirolimus should be stopped several days before PD catheter placement. Sirolimus should also be stopped if a PD catheter leak is detected or if incisional hernia develops soon after initiation of PD. Sirolimus should be held till surgical repair of the hernia and removal and replacement of the catheter.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Incisional Hernia After Peritoneal Dialysis Catheter Placement in a Patient on Sirolimus.","doi":"","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"Advances in peritoneal dialysis.

It finds that the institutional dichotomy of the rural and urban systems in land ownership and planning management has not only rooted the emergence and proliferation of urban villages, but also obstructed their regeneration. The core of urban village regeneration is the redistribution of interest derived from land appreciation; the current regulatory framework has difficulties in accommodating this redistribution and alternative legislation is needed. Collaboration formed by some powerful stakeholders is proved to be essential for project completion, and this partnership formation has to some extent weakened the top-down single-actor planning mechanism, which has been the routine in socialist China for decades. The study identifies the dynamics of land regeneration, suggesting that there is no single universal prescribed form of land regeneration.","inCitations":["06a765fe77d52ba5185847ba722bc8eca1f53591","7f4ee695d99df481e31b1be4407f45e0d40609bc"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"New urban paradigm beyond the west: investigating the regeneration of urban villages in Guangzhou, China","doi":"10.1080/17549175.2016.1224266","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1080/17549175.2016.1224266","venue":""}

Friction materials were fabricated with recycled rubber particles of two different sizes, approximately 75 and 450 µm, and their frictional performance was examined with a reduced-scale brake dynamometer. The results showed that the specimen with small rubber particles showed higher contact stiffness than that with large rubber particles. However, the small rubber particles in the friction materials increased the friction level and friction instability, accompanied by a higher wear rate, which were attributed to the larger high-pressure contact plateaus produced at the sliding interface. This study indicated that the frictional instability of brake friction materials is strongly affected by the contact plateaus and suggested that friction instability can be reduced by regulating the recycled rubber particle size.","inCitations":["60c2cd07bbd8a2a356c3113c890979ce3f266219"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Size effect of tire rubber particles on tribological properties of brake friction materials","doi":"10.1016/j.wear.2017.10.004","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.wear.2017.10.004","venue":""}

We assessed risk of rectal SCC in HIV-infected people.\n\n\nDESIGN\nPopulation-based registry.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe utilized the HIV/AIDS Cancer Match, a linkage of US HIV and cancer registries (1991-2010), to ascertain cases of anal SCC, rectal SCC, rectal non-SCC, and colon non-SCC. We compared risk in HIV-infected persons with the general population using standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) and evaluated risk factors using Poisson regression. We reviewed cancer registry case notes to confirm site and histology for a subset of cases.\n\n\nRESULTS\nHIV-infected persons had an excess risk of rectal SCC compared with the general population (SIR = 28.9; 95% CI 23.2-35.6), similar to the increase for anal SCC (SIR = 37.3). Excess rectal SCC risk was most pronounced among HIV-infected MSM (SIR = 61.2). Risk was not elevated for rectal non-SCC (SIR = 0.88) or colon non-SCC (SIR = 0.63). Individuals diagnosed with AIDS had higher rectal SCC rates than those with HIV-only (incidence rate ratio = 1.92; 95% CI 1.08-3.42). Based on available information, one-third of rectal SCCs were determined to be misclassified anal cancer.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nHIV-infected individuals, especially with advanced immunosuppression, appear to have substantially elevated risk for rectal SCC. As for anal SCC, rectal SCC risk was highest in MSM, pointing to involvement of a sexually transmitted infection such as human papillomavirus. Site misclassification was present, and detailed information on tumour location is needed to prove that rectal SCC is a distinct entity.","inCitations":["29ef398fa636a695501f4f564914f3cc4bde23b2","cdb5587ef158f09e439499421098c13b9ba04f27","0df7c6d075f99c9da0bcc6b22d72f0d8376b3b29","523aba166dbbe55a0ff620494973e2bf5e6c6ec6","a9cd8fb30301c31d7b1c77b2db2d4d61f266ae28","cf42dd43e13a013cc9652291e508095bbe3fcc60"],"pdfUrls":["https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/39146/cdc_39146_DS1.pdf"],"title":"Rectal squamous cell carcinoma in immunosuppressed populations: is this a distinct entity from anal cancer?","doi":"10.1097/QAD.0000000000000873","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1097/QAD.0000000000000873","venue":"AIDS"}

This is an essential question, since its answer can lead to more interesting systems of automated composition. Composing is a creative attitude, in which something new is created, by a specific intention of a composer, who is motivated by aesthetic or expressive needs. Such a composing act can be thought as some organization of the sonorous material. Therefore, some sort of musical semantics is associated to an ordering imposed to musical sounds by the composer in a procedure that is just the opposite of chaos, which in sound terms may be identified to noise . From the previous definition, one must find paradoxical using computers in music composition, since these devices cannot make any creative decisions, so, it is impossible for them to perform innovative creation and they have no means of expression and are not able to manifest any kind of aesthetic reactions to anything. Although true creation is actually impossible to computers, since they are guided by machine programs that define a priori what will be their behavior, an interesting alternative would be found by relying on unpredictable results, that is, those related to stochastic processes. In such processes, a kind of creative phenomenon would be associated to the production of something new, in the sense of unexpected . Following this idea, one may argue that the almost unpredictable results produced by such systems are more related to noise or chaos than to music itself. Although that is true for completely random systems, one may impose organization rules into this stochastic system in order to obtain some musical structure that a human listener would interpret as music. How can music be properly represented in computer systems? A better question is: how would musical knowledge for composing be properly represented in such systems? Considering the very nature of computing systems, it seems we should treat music as some kind of language. That subject is usually controversial, but it seems clear that using syntactic structures may be very useful as a mental model for describing musical structure. Therefore, gram m ars are pointed to be valuable for representing musical knowledge in a computer, and they constitute a very practical user interface as well. The present work is intended to be part of a musical meta instrument, which has the objective to work in music therapy applications, not only in contemporary music performances. In such applications, music perception and response from the performer is the most important requirement. Therefore, our starting point relies on three principles: emulating musical creativity by means of random choice; representing musical knowledge and musical structure by means of syntactic structures, like grammars; and realtime performance, allowing the presence of human performers who should interfere in composing decisions. 2 MARKOV CHAINS AND LANGUAGES Looking at computer music history, we will find the early experiences in algorithmic composition at Hiller Isaacson’s Illiac Suite [1]. In that work, stochastic paradigms were used for choosing compositional parameters, and musical structuring (or noise filtering) is represented by a transition state matrix or a Markov network. A Markov chain is a nondeterministic state machine, where the probability of the system being at some particular state depends only on its previous state and on the probability of a transition between those states. This could be described by a state transition table. Such a device turns out to be useful for music composing through the attachment of compositional decisions to their transitions, such as producing musical outputs as a response to the occurrence of some transition. Even though this kind of approach obtained very poor musical results, our interest in Markov chains rely on the fact that we can establish connections between them and the logical concept of language. In fact, the sequences of symbols produced by a series of Markov chain transitions can be proved to belong to some regular language. We may start from a linear grammar for that language, generating a corresponding finite state automaton and then transforming it into a nondeterministic first order state machine by converting its deterministic symbol consuming transitions into probabilistic symbol producing ones by attaching them probabilities of occurrence. The second reason for the interest in Markov chains is the great simplicity shown by such devices, which makes its real time implementa tion and interface very neat. The obvious limitation of this class of algorithms is the fact that first order Markov chains can only produce results equivalent to those of linear grammars. Considering that musical structure happens to be hierarchically organized, or, in other words, that there are usually nested structures in most musical works, we have to choose a less restrictive type of language, namely the context free languages. It is a consensus that even this kind class of languages is not enough for representing music: one may find several examples in which a compositional decision affects future symbol substituting; this fact is related to a specific context allowed by some rules in the grammar. These are context sensitive ones, hardly implemented on computer systems. A quick analysis of compositions made by a first order Markov chain will lead one to the conclusion that the system was only barely able to structure musical material as the composition enlarges, since its organization will be strictly local. The first choice for overcoming this difficulty was using higher order Markov chains, that is, a state transition probabilistic system where the next decision depends not only on the present state, but also on a number of past states. This does not lead to a practical solution since the original simplicity vanishes suddenly as the order of the system rises and the musical result is still poor. The use of higher order Markov chains usually conduces to nonlinear behaviors, like the presence of cycles, and its relationship with formal grammars becoming less immediate. Our problem is then representing probabilistic systems which are able to model hierarchical musical structure (and not only a linear one), trying to find a particular means of introducing musical context sensitive decisions, without discarding the simple idea of Markov networks. 3 ADAPTIVE FORMALISMS FOR MUSIC COMPOSITION The idea behind adaptive schemes is that, although the basic structure of the automata is maintained, it can be self modified in response to the occurrence of a transition. Therefore, an adaptive Markov network is defined by its initial set of states, initial state transition matrix and a set of transition functions , which are invoked whenever the associated transition is executed. Those functions may create or remove states or transitions in the automaton, what means that they are able to dynamically change the graph topology, that is, the algorithm itself. Adaptive formalisms are efficiently employed in compiler construction and natural language processing. Their use in nondeterministic schemes is new, and it showed to be a good contribution to computer music composition. It seems intuitive that such a mechanism is able to attach new processing steps to the original algorithm, associated to decisions that would be taken later in the future . That is, at a moment we may be concerned with choices that had a foundation in the past, what is equivalent of context sensitiveness. This new flexibility is introduced to make it possible to handle more sophisticated types of languages, leaving the original simplicity of the finite automata formalism untouched. We can extend this concept to a set of adaptive state machines, where all state machines may be executed independently, but the set of transition functions can make transformations not only local to a particular machine, but in any of the machines belonging to the set. These relationships between any pair of adaptive Markov chains can be of two types: the first, both state machines interfere with each other, by adapting its own behavior to the other. The second kind of interaction is when one machine controls the other, by imposing restrictions or constraints it must meet; such inter relation is called hierarchical. Presented this way, one may use adaptive sets of probabilistic state machines to make a compositional framework with a much smaller number of states, employing transition functions to change contexts or interacting with another machine at the same level or vertically structured. One composer transcribing musical knowledge to this framework, can treat any isolated detail, modeled through a particular state machine, while having control over the entire structure, expressed by machine interactions. With this idea, we kept simple the model, by making it hierarchically structured and by adding to it the capacity of taking contexts into account. 4 A PRACTICAL EXAMPLE In this example, we report a small experience, in which we generate increasingly complex melodies by imposing successive restrictions to the chosen musical notes. Let’s start with a simple eight state nonadaptive Markov chain to create a single melody line. For every transition arriving to each state we associate the generation of a musical note, in the scale of c major. The simpler machine has all transitions allowed between all states, with equal probabilities of occurrence (1/8). Hence, the probabilities of the system being in each of its states are the same, then the generated music will have the notes uniformly distributed among the possible notes. For instance, the syste","inCitations":["54a0016d876bce44874c6d5070fa1824dbb8b971","c108a5e0f82b0942c9dc36cbeca4201064ff0fd3","726a21e828af81ec756d2647baa24e7ebcd598e2","0335a84f0ba5685c683c90a5190bb33238138637","b78bda330758f3a479f1f3eb5f129b72899285f6","d41a7ce4866ac65e8cc7838a5f6d2f20434f7cc3","a6d02f4b7690a7163e71f1f4787cd4fefcfff136","a9cfdd5d90521d9ea8ce456b3bde520de7ee63eb","9ae31415238af09f7243a27f80e29d3d0dcfcb07","ade11343284aecb2da160d3e49dd1f1377ca6e3b"],"pdfUrls":["http://compmus.ime.usp.br/sbcm/1999/papers/sbcm-paper-1999-7.pdf"],"title":"A stochastic musical composer based on adaptive algorithms","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Most universities' mission statements involve teaching, research and service, but while the teaching and research missions are clearly defined and located within certain areas of the university activities, service is less clear and more ambiguous, assuming an increasingly important and central catchphrase in many higher education institutions' publicity or ‘marketing’ strategies. As little research has come out to understand and locate the place of service in relation to the other core activities, an understanding of it could be useful in comprehending the wider implication of utilitarian‐driven higher education policies and developing effective frameworks to rethink policy and practice. Based on two case studies, this paper argues that service, rather than being simply one of three functions, is a broad concept that covers the core activities and is influenced by the context of universities.","inCitations":["dff744d295d076e014d57cc317ec3f46580dbca8","44c23aef4029354244a006a0426421706b0f440b","f5c0722c4753e4ae99b4da3c8d2b81a14c0c4cec","bb07b3bbf5adca37aa5ce2a1acd564404b2e766b","07a428f7033c09d19a64d8142b4444c0ad6f5ca8","a0427eb2a3e5f9c311fe2767c8f5c0bbea72e99a","17ccc5bc8aab2f15a90d5cdf5ab6c9414a2e6b9f","7ff003112ed1ed6025e90bdb5e3f02264b060b57"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"The dynamics of service of higher education: a comparative study","doi":"10.1080/03057920902831390","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1080/03057920902831390","venue":""}

The stratigraphic sequence at the forebulge is thin or absent. Research on the Kuqa foreland basin in Northern Tarim basin and previous studies on lithospheric flexural simulations of foreland basins show that accommodation space from the forebulge to the foredeep develops inconsistently due to compressional tectonism, which results in the forebulge rising while the foredeep subsides. This inconsistency is dynamically associated with the formation and migration of the forebulge. In an active tectonic phase the forebulge rises and migrates gradually toward the thrust-fault belt, which results in the basin narrowing and deepening, and the development of accommodation space becoming more and more inconsistent. In an inactive tectonic phase the basin is wide and shallow and accommodation space develops consistently. Therefore, the reflection configuration of a second-order sequence is two-layered in seismic sections such as the Jurassic and the Kapushaliang Group, Cretaceous of the Kuqa basin: the lower layer is a group of wedge-shaped, regressive reflections shrinking gradually toward the thrust-fault belt; the upper layer is a group of strap-shaped, widespread reflections. Further, the correlation model showed that the third-order sequences in the lower part of a second-order sequence onlapped gradually toward the craton, which indicates the initial tectonism and the formation of the forebulge; that the third-order sequences in the middle part gradually decrease in size toward the thrust-fault belt, corresponding to intense tectonism; that the third-order sequences in the upper part are widely distributed, corresponding to an inactive tectonic phase such as the Lower Tertiary of the Kuqa basin.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Accommodation Space Evolution and Third-Order Sequence Correlation in the Second-Order Sequence of a Foreland Basin","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

We conducted a population-based, case-control study in Washington State using 1994 to 2002 linked data from the Washington State Birth Registry and the Comprehensive Hospital Abstract Reporting System (CHARS). We identified 1060 singleton, term newborns (602 males, 458 females) with International Classification of Diseases (ICD-9) diagnoses consistent with encephalopathy, and 5330 unaffected control newborns (2756 males, 2574 females). Intrapartum fever was defined by a diagnosis of intrapartum temperature of >38 degrees C in the birth registry or CHARS databases. Chorioamnionitis was defined using ICD-9 diagnoses recorded in CHARS. We identified 2.2 cases of encephalopathy per 1000 births. Isolated intrapartum fever was associated with a 3.1-fold (95% confidence interval [CI] 2.3-4.2) increased risk of newborn encephalopathy. Chorioamnionitis was associated with a 5.4-fold (95% CI 3.6-7.8) increased risk of encephalopathy. We found that isolated intrapartum fever and chorioamnionitis were independently associated with an increased risk of encephalopathy in term infants. Our data also indicate that there is a spectrum of risk for encephalopathy in term infants exposed to intrapartum fever. Infants born to women with signs of chorioamnionitis other than isolated intrapartum fever may be at higher risk of encephalopathy than those exposed only to isolated intrapartum fever.","inCitations":["2d7f5a35b558024ae6fb85666f171cf81b6fd8b9","efc5c06906054d08c64cbe05d68b5e1a5e4b5010","588265423fdf9cd06d7b226a562f8987c9036d3d","15d4349446e357e75787ead42600828f95b0ea8e","fb5239fd72de0a68dfc8f5d9324b9c6dcbe4453b","69b5bd62070cdfd4583184e6dc87deabc95f7eed","05d81f5fe540f8be8fb69dcf036ee46c80f18c79","0cbb033658e290cd950983d5a61dbd7215c4dbfa","f9a7610d71aea74bc9af02b9e7c7c194216b6c8c","cfff556178eee37456a23a282c8a92a2e79da656","63d1fc7c78a09879e8c0c8dfe8f7525a02635093","9dfb7b9e2f10919358e93497d3153a531aa57113","2b13eb5398b94f9f6e8b023b6a4d6770d1a5787d","5446cd3dabe12fc1e0de67562b71c5b49c4b3947","08afd44463e8c0e2bd028021dbf5e77a32b19089","c3e666321a539a21d5b50b4cc60e9edf89b46884","9f868ed75ea9235fb6ea5ebaad9bbe32936deda2","fc2d55fac5628958d83f0df51d4b28420adf0e53","e4c0117cae384dbfa2c57517e6530d50a9a69508","e17cbdfdf9944ce9043c24bfeb587a1875eaee90","deb30b62ed3cbe1fad00a426d02ef6fed3ece002","52dfe55bd27f066d810fbe50f45d41329b4031eb","1b3702d737866ce86ecfe9684ff1ee367df15cc4","49544f9073442232c54ea14bffdc5002b0e30335","10d8f73a170e88ed8a1f8598e83ca7bdaf6749c1","f6a4393bb6a70365ed3882caf9dbf6c8cabc573b","718eb909abc0a0b214739bbcd4c4902fa1486338","098d19ab05aa876adf8b4bf90fa423e710c5f228","09fcecf90193d13926783cda9c72e24ff1adaf53","f084374eb83f6070aa358d02c1bbc6a93fac803a","99e094cd3702185f3b0efb59c858187481e61da3","a7094ed7587c4ba0f1eda2c5cb46e9917e4c7195","e6ca15eda004c0cfd05e886b69cbbf0c776d01be","0f575d5a3196cd7c0b2bb19c58426ede1b383566","a23680d86f30e320863bc416ce92e2bf8117c97c","4529e5f6da70558c80ed83c71d047732b7f5c0c7","0b4062bc9afe7d5e8b4feb83adb66df917c1b797","828ac21121fc0a98ca6908b802d1325f5a95b07e"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Intrapartum fever and chorioamnionitis as risks for encephalopathy in term newborns: a case-control study.","doi":"10.1111/j.1469-8749.2007.02007.x","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-8749.2007.02007.x","venue":"Developmental medicine and child neurology"}

A cooperative Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC)-based optimization method for implementing a highway lane merge of two connected autonomous vehicles is presented using solutions obtained by the direct multiple shooting method. A performance criteria cost function, which is a function of the states and inputs of the system, was optimized subject to nonlinear model and maneuver constraints. An optimal formulation was developed and then solved on a receding horizon using direct multiple shooting solutions; this is implemented using an open-source ACADO code. Numerical simulation results were performed in a real-case scenario. The results indicate that the implementation of such a controller is possible in real time, in different highway merge situations.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Cooperative Highway Lane Merge of Connected Vehicles Using Nonlinear Model Predictive Optimal Controller","doi":"10.3390/vehicles2020014","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.3390/vehicles2020014","venue":""}

Greenpeace further researches revealed that these same chemicals can be found in many daily consumer products. This report completes the loop by illustrating two disturbing developments. Firstly, that many of the same chemicals used routinely in consumer products and present in house dust, are also present in the human body, including in prenatal and newborn children. Secondly, that these chemicals are likely to be having a detrimental effect on the health of children and the human population at large. Dorey draws together the available evidence that illustrates how and why prenatal and newly born children are particularly at risk from chemical pollutants. The evidence presented here, from academics, governments and international institutions is not easily dismissed, contributing as it does to a growing bank of international research that reinforces the conclusion of this report--that current chemical legislation is failing to protect children from a harmful chemical assault that begins from a child's conception. The study focuses on seven key chemicals: alkylphenols, bisphenol A, brominated flame retardants, organotins, phthalates, chlorinated paraffins and artificial musks, and demonstrates: the presence of these substances in children, the ways in which children are particularly exposed, how this increased exposure increases the potential for detrimental health impacts, the different illnesses and diseases that are now being linked to this chemical exposure and the specific health impacts of the key chemicals listed above.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"[Chemical contamination of the child: bioacumulation and potential effects].","doi":"","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"Revista espanola de salud publica"}

Yet the boundary between science and policy is not only imprecise, but one that is also socially constructed. Negotiations take place between two main groups, managers and scientists, surrounding the roles and expectations each has towards the other. Pressure is placed upon each group to conform to the role expectations of the other. Taking note of reform attempts of the European fisheries management system which are already under way, we suggest that reform must provide for effective two-way communication between scientists and managers, which recognises their different needs and role identities, and focuses on both areas of conflict and areas of common interest, in order that the system better meets the requirements of each party, ultimately aiding in the shared goal of the sustainable use of fisheries resources.","inCitations":["16be3ded470d05ee578bb93c4260c5c301ab6c0f","4dc419c3ce17612bbdf59fe466d1deea983e919a","20bdf7aad24f4271b618fc5f6f604f4c516af82f","6def5b950b467678421873ec68718afe64c78e02","ded02b1346328c5077f71a21be85dc7fe5cf5009","539d377e1e90bae8badbfafaab81c8700604a8f5"],"pdfUrls":["http://sep.csumb.edu/class/ESSP645/readings/DelaneyandHastie2007.pdf"],"title":"Lost in translation: Differences in role identities between fisheries scientists and managers","doi":"10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2007.04.009","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2007.04.009","venue":""}

Rural areas situated near the industrial area are facing the problem of contaminated water. Present work is an effort to develop a self sufficient, easy to assemble and eco friendly system for the removal of heavy metal ions from the water. Millet husk readily available in the rural areas of eastern Rajasthan has been tried and tested for the removal of chromium and manganese ions from the aqueous system. The results are exiting and indicate that it could be used for the removal of heavy metal ions from the water. A column of 12 inches height and 2 inches diameter of pretreated millet husk was used as a biosorbent. This column is sufficient to treat a 50 ml solution (0.012g/L) of chromium ions and 65ml solution (0.001g/L) of manganese ions. The rate of flow of the solution was kept 2ml/min at room temperature and Ph3-4.","inCitations":["6fa8bf8429b34350943131c9a7806b3ad9742508"],"pdfUrls":["http://ijcepr.in/vol-2/issue-1/6.pdf"],"title":"Use of Millet Husk as a Biosorbent for the Removal of chromium and Manganese Ions from the Aqueous Solutions.","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Changes in tension were monitored isometrically on spiral strips of canine basilar arteries and femoral veins suspended in 10 ml organ baths and on spiral strips of canine saphenous veins superfused between two platinum electrodes for electric stimulation (150 mA, 0.1 ms, 2 Hz) and measurement of tritium overflow. Cumulative concentration-response curves were established for, 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), noradrenaline (NA), dihydroergocornine (DHCO), dihydroergocristine (DHEC), dihydro-α-ergokryptine (DHαE), dihydro-β-ergokryptine (DHβE) and CODE. CODE and its single components were about equally potent in antagonizing responses to 5-HT on basilar arteries. On femoral veins DHEC antagonized responses to NA noncompetitively whereas the other components caused competitive antagonism against NA. Compared to CODE DHαE and DHβE, the α-blocking potency of both DHCO and DHEC was about 10 times weaker. All 5 ergot compounds were about equally potent in antagonizing contractile responses to electric stimulation of saphenous veins whereas the stimulation-induced overflow of labeled NA was inhibited in the following order of potency: CODE≧DHCO > DHαE > DHβE > DHEC. The 5 ergot compounds stimulated arterial and venous smooth muscle at slightly higher concentrations than necessary for antagonism of 5-HT or NA. Evidence is presented that the mechanism of the stimulant action on arteries differs from that on veins.It is suggested that the diversity of actions of CODE is the base for its therapeutic effectiveness in patients suffering from regional vascular disorders.","inCitations":["0d0fc779178b22e5d54724ef000a6ff6b836369e"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Actions of Co-Dergocrine mesylate and its components at vascular smooth muscle","doi":"10.1007/BF00500484","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/BF00500484","venue":"Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Archives of Pharmacology"}

The process is characterized by consisting of the following steps of: introducing a condensation product of modified phytic acid and ethanol amine into a silylanization process of an electroplating and blackening process; forming a silylanization film and a protective film of the condensation product of the modified phytic acid and the ethanol amine on the metal surface; and when Si-OH in silane is condensed and a silane film with a Si-O-Si three-dimensional netlike structure is formed on the metal surface, jointing the condensation product of the modified phytic acid and the ethanol amine with a polar group through a covalent bond and embedding into the polar group so as to form a silane-phytic acid composite film. The corrosion resistance of the composite film is greatly enhanced, the hard water resistance is remarkably enhanced, the production cost is lowered; the composite film can be separately applied to anticorrosion treatment on metals; and the application and popularization of a technology become possible.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Novel process for improving organic film treatment metal surface","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}
