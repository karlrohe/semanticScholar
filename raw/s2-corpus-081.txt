In response, we describe PCC indicators and the evaluation process used to identify a set of PCC indicators for state use. Materials and Methods: The Surveillance and Research Workgroup and Clinical Workgroup of the National Preconception Health and Health Care Initiative used a systematic process to identify, evaluate, and prioritize PCC indicators from nationwide public health surveillance systems that Maternal and Child Health (MCH) programs can use for state-level surveillance using the Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS) and Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS). For each indicator, we assessed target population, prevalence, measurement simplicity, data availability, clinical utility, and whether it was related to the 10 prioritized preconception health indicators. We also assessed relevance to clinical recommendations, Healthy People (HP)2020 objectives, and the National Quality Forum measures. Lastly, we considered input from stakeholders and subject matter experts. Results: Eighty potential PCC indicators were initially identified. After conducting evaluations, obtaining stakeholder input, and consulting with subject matter experts, the list was narrowed to 30 PCC indicators for states to consider using in their MCH programs to inform the need for new strategies and monitor programmatic activities. PRAMS is the data source for 27 of the indicators, and BRFSS is the data source for three indicators. Conclusions: The identification and evaluation of population-based PCC indicators that are available at the state level increase opportunities for state MCH programs to document, monitor, and address PCC in their locales.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Surveillance Indicators for Women's Preconception Care.","doi":"10.1089/jwh.2019.8146","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1089/jwh.2019.8146","venue":"Journal of women's health"}

Therefore, it is of great significance to understand the influence of gamma-ray irradiation on the distribution of traps to ensure the safety of electrical equipment. In this work, PET films with thickness of $100~{\\mathrm {\\mu m}}$ were selected as samples. Then they were irradiated in air at room temperature by gamma-ray, the irradiation dose rate was $10 \\sim 130$ Gy/min. The total irradiation dose was controlled at 0 kGy, 100 kGy, 500 kGy, 1000 kGy, respectively. Surface potential on the PET sample was established by dc corona charging with needle-to-plate electrode. Surface potential decay measurement was carried out with an electrostatic voltmeter, by which trap distribution of the sample could be extracted and the influence of total irradiation dose was estimated. The results showed that with the increase of the total irradiation dose, the deep trap center became deeper whereas the shallow trap center appeared to be shallower. The possible mechanism that was responsible for such behaviors was discussed on the basis of radiation induced variation in the chemical and physical structures.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Effect of Gamma-Ray Irradiation on Surface Potential Decay Behavior of Polyethylene Terephthalate Film","doi":"10.1109/icd.2018.8514646","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/icd.2018.8514646","venue":"2018 IEEE 2nd International Conference on Dielectrics (ICD)"}

The electric utilities will send repair crew to deal with the outages as soon as possible. Due to the limits of repair resources in a large-scale multiple contingencies, an effective resource management is especially crucial In this paper, a fuzzy rule-based system is proposed to assist the dispatchers in crew management in case of large-scale multiple outages happen. Fuzzy logic is exploited to determine the priority of repair sequences of the events. The proposed fuzzy membership functions include the functions of the types of key customers, the estimated time needed for the repair, the amount of resources needed, and the easiness of restoration after the repair. To increase the availability of the resources and meet the special requirements of events, fuzzy rules and fuzzy membership functions are proposed to determine the priority of each crew and vehicle to be dispatched to the Held. Besides, pre-scheduling for the outages that lack some resources temporarily is proposed. The proposed system is developed in the basis of the integrated system of automatic mapping/facility management (AM/FM) and the outage management system (OMS) of the Taiwan-power company. A test is implemented to show the effectiveness of the proposed system.","inCitations":["d2dbaf286905620de495be1d940e0883513b33a2","6cf7afef44313f2de096b9ab7b80cb8810230130","44d93f6aa591c4583be17a7a2e11604d79f75605","5a29d3b68eee5aaa5db6b74314e5d521679e93b5","dfb5983528c08421e9762c2ea077e20c943c4233","08a7b9c3431c977f4b8359c5ec276055a91c99a8","9b22a46427fb57a07d8f179a8622ff3d01604312","9a1a0793147fdfcae790a5c92d7150746dbd8b81","30eac3f2012485a2853ba0c4a138dc00dff0a76e"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"A fuzzy rule-based system for crew management of distribution systems in large-scale multiple outages","doi":"10.1109/ICPST.2004.1460162","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPST.2004.1460162","venue":"2004 International Conference on Power System Technology, 2004.

Two hundred and twenty-three students about to complete an introductory tax course were given ten brief scenarios focusing on the ethical and professional responsibilities of CPAs with tax practices. For each scenario, the students were asked whether they believed the opinion or the situation described was considered appropriate under existing professional standards, and whether they personally believed the opinion or situation described was appropriate. They were also asked whether they believed evading taxes was immoral. The results indicated that female students had higher personal ethical standards for issues involving tax professionals than did male students. Exposure to a course in auditing (the accounting course generally having the most extensive coverage of ethical issues) was associated with higher ethical standards, but exposure to a general course on ethics was not. Students aspiring to be tax professionals had higher ethical standards for issues involving tax professionals than those that did not, but their beliefs about the morality of tax evasion were not significantly different. The implications of these and other results are discussed.","inCitations":["f18c4898460926f70ccce5bf578bee38f76568ea","b8c2df6829d1be225164c97c16c3e6ef1f1a36b9","fa7350b8dfb4c2ea580f9e48fbc0afa8d2908b7d","0bcc4530a8927b7cc31b2a2bbabaf69fc46bf3d4","86b6def23bfb27c84ef5ce2632952263f23ecb82","915dd298caec0325ef052ab4555fb7bbdc38fa70","2e8e4c48b4a982c4c6838cc12c961d59e5c8c0db"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"An examination of ethical standards for tax issues","doi":"10.1016/S0748-5751(98)00004-9","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/S0748-5751%2898%2900004-9","venue":""}

Insulin-like growth factor II mRNA-binding protein (IMP) zip code-binding proteins participate in mRNA localization, and in motile cells IMP-containing granules are dispersed around the nucleus and in cellular protrusions. We isolated the IMP1-containing RNP granules and found that they represent a unique RNP entity distinct from neuronal hStaufen and/or fragile X mental retardation protein granules, processing bodies, and stress granules. Granules were 100-300 nm in diameter and consisted of IMPs, 40 S ribosomal subunits, shuttling heterologous nuclear RNPs, poly(A)-binding proteins, and mRNAs. Moreover granules contained CBP80 and factors belonging to the exon junction complex and lacked eIF4E, eIF4G, and 60 S ribosomal subunits, indicating that embodied mRNAs are not translated. Granules embodied mRNAs corresponding to about 3% of the human embryonic kidney 293 mRNA transcriptome.

They were planning to marry or had experienced some form of sexual violence. Of these, 48 chose hymen reconstruction (HR), 26 a temporary hymen suture (THS), and 27 to resort to some expedient for staining the sheets or to another alternative for surgery. At follow-up, 13 of the 17 women who had THS and six of the 11 who had HR reported blood loss on their wedding night, whereas all six women who inserted a capsule with food colouring stated they had stained the sheets.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nCost-effective procedures help young women who are no longer virgins to avoid reprisals by their husband or family. Pelvic floor exercises will tighten the vaginal opening. THS seems more effective than HR for producing blood loss. There are alternatives should no blood loss occur during penetration.","inCitations":["be6bde9d2baf78ccdb69b2b78db72c709320a66c","c5d6046ecd29abafa363bc458a357ff23c0ee519","e69c2d1a03c85fc7b8c047e5c632f5e3d663aa01","e3bfe236ca06dadbe4ce56e361e7fbe0d64846b6","8ee12d2e8ad669bcc649a359d7a7b70513a8dfc3"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Wrestling with the hymen: consultations and practical solutions.","doi":"10.3109/13625187.2014.984834","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.3109/13625187.2014.984834","venue":"The European journal of contraception & reproductive health care : the official journal of the European Society of Contraception"}

At quarterly intervals, prospective data continued to be collected during this period and an additional three year follow-up period.\n\n\nSETTING\nA 292 bed tertiary care children's hospital.\n\n\nKEY MEASURES FOR IMPROVEMENT\nWe aimed to reduce our infection rates to below the national mean rates for similar units by 2000 (a 25% reduction).\n\n\nSTRATEGIES FOR CHANGE\nA stepwise introduction of interventions designed to reduce infection rates, including maximal barrier precautions, transition to antibiotic impregnated central venous catheters, annual handwashing campaigns, and changing the skin disinfectant from povidone-iodine to chlorhexidine. Effects of change Significant decreases in rates of infection occurred over the intervention period. These were sustained over the three year follow-up. Annual rates decreased from 9.7/1000 days with a central venous catheter in 1997 to 3.0/1000 days in 2005, which translates to a relative risk reduction of 75% (95% confidence interval 35% to 126%), an absolute risk reduction of 6% (2% to 10%), and a number needed to treat of 16 (10 to 35).\n\n\nLESSONS LEARNT\nA stepwise introduction of interventions leading to a greater than threefold reduction in nosocomial infections can be implemented successfully. This requires a multidisciplinary team, support from hospital leadership, ongoing data collection, shared data interpretation, and introduction of evidence based interventions.","inCitations":["5d525ea84a27bb04637afd96d5d47e5056ded76e","cba9989a8ef327845b5856a617510c9805b28b71","72dcb34107a8a078875d364b7fee348faebb8d80","38e7b2b9e03cbfcc2fc03298d4ba9df6896f1dcd","6844e3f8fd7b780a32b068796033d23fabc898fe","5a795a327a8095e31f8f65366d2a86bd2613e914","36312ccc5fdb75d405d8084b9af667e909c4d1b7","d810ae6b5feef1f2616386d3b2251441f92c8468","9899af58ff57cb6c24e2bd442eca10873ab44090","6a46fa5b794bfffd1ad47588c89dca0ebc573860","91b45f305f203a52cdcf6b64ab1511162bb66b5b","537b085e95a3eaa7b5960813e3edf811047ce33e","91dac9aa0a5f336c225c9d792edcbb9a717cf4ed","2c33358d30a79bb39547868d577cfcadf4e6fee9","670e91de98ffa14b896bb420ddadd32dd6d6d6d6","cc602b646d06cab710d0a3535e3fc30092034383","0d0924800377127acc47fb586a1084d7f4bc301d","bb43030e7d260ddd23d9662c60727c3f038e338d","cae8cfdc594524305328d666222f1c37eed9dc69","d06c9c2aee354c472c5abad5dc134857381989f1","1bf78e75da00290d5fd1928ad5db30df0057471a","a137214cc8e4abe0411f478ab8a88ce3278d64bc","d818ebb1d7e5524d2c9b7e28c9515d335d96993c","e9070b20a0d54e2f0da2a9a879b139168c30638c","2b10fefdedd01443ead2fecba20a83e1df1a42c9","a909be9830f1120a0a6c61335e490748206d6628","8c8f6ff2edeb3c41d75cc85da1911f70a29984dc","e74d36c4d616837d43623f5d79a4d78be887e744","56b37161014d23f90e3dd23eabb0fdd3091c8853","98e5adb51ada1ba2bfb183a7447378ebc2ea0cd5","aa559a2a871a6d28bf6766ff77c2f26c512d6113","518a930eef850fe266292bebbf0268fa6085acb2","842d8d36d8e78a528435441b9d18e4e667b59b87","0d952618e2cc4a7220f24f25e21071b96b1e7cb3","734ed38023d115c7c1a8c7d4acd1c390849d8a8f","9eb23c4aad1dcf1655838bde91731362d50e0260","fd919fa68f54590d71a3e11c70f2f0acda01b21a","41cd1c9eb99b73f336c37b38a6320b5172d1c3a4","92ae97505ad62a89a80bd08945c053ec4e85efa5","c5795366631cd9a515f6b156a867ca3bdd743d37","bc30bea7920dc28b1bd26c316d1af2cd5a7af434","eca8e846939d5569759a50b3f438f57218f94246","70c7d23f3a5ac0433076e3c1c09e4f761e760c2f","017214b0c5b9f476f582624e9c3105808450f5e2","1acdddb783ed2735171445a5d58be44d2434ba77","65e2df89d5d806e8646ffb56753cb0b76be8dfba","436effc86ac1212bb6b6775cef76d2697bd3bf85","7fbca44b21b151e213234c3ccc78792e89ff9a46","93451e01bf2129626186d40fbb6d4fc3629a391d","42b973aa508d85827dc30cd475befd891895b259","2900e1ae9bb341cd5487a5c144fc543e417aa0d6","3e70132ac0dc1dcd6b7ffc1772f0b57140129e59","d8245d7b91b2f5911dbd29808a5c67954f0e62ac","fab8a3b7049b8aeae96f413daf8588d588b650c1","78a1b2ec2b814b5da7560ea952953ecb4cc8d5af"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Reduction of bloodstream infections associated with catheters in paediatric intensive care unit: stepwise approach.","doi":"10.1136/bmj.39064.457025.DE","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.39064.457025.DE","venue":"BMJ"}

The hydrolysis of the ECM appears to facilitate tumor cell migration contributing to the metastatic dissemination of malignant cells (1). A major group of proteases that has been directly associated with tumor metastasis is the matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), a family of endopeptidases known to cleave many ECM proteins (1). The MMPs are multidomain proteases that contain a zinc atom in the active site and are produced in a latent inactive form (zymogen) (2). Acquisition of enzymatic activity requires cleavage of the inhibitory N-terminal domain (3). Thus, generation of the active form usually occurs concomitantly with a decrease in molecular mass and exposure of the active site. Once activated, all the MMPs are specifically inhibited by a group of endogenous protease inhibitors known as the tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs), which bind to the active site inhibiting catalytic activity (4).","inCitations":["6715ae2c5702d436def769f9d774e8325de3ab80","4ce36ee6e282e2a3d80ed38524671ad488d4c3a0","08acc2dd0be4afa263ae886022bca169a1401b7a","558680db9f25fc94b477f5ab1ab092cf1017548b","9a15d8185bd19bae3b297f81a5648cf7e77ec9a0","ca2faac63f9733ead676a6058460f6fef30e9f0b","17f50de2ea6a6d3017c6d0deaa5b62af4bb9ca95","b4d7995b84a09f996dce1b0499c3f42042a49377","3448c98c082e61920e54a0ece359ced2f15b83f1"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Assessment of Gelatinases (MMP-2 and MMP-9 by Gelatin Zymography.","doi":"10.1385/1-59259-136-1:163","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1385/1-59259-136-1%3A163","venue":"Methods in molecular medicine"}

It is based on the well-known fact that at the transition state, the electronic structure of one isomer changes to the other. We discover that this switch of electronic structure causes a strong electronic flux that is well distinguishable from the usual flux of electrons that travel with the nuclei. As a simple but clear example, the effect is demonstrated here for bond length isomerization of Na2 (21Σu+), with adiabatic crossing the barrier between the inner and outer wells of the double minimum potential that support different \"Rydberg\" and \"ionic\" type electronic structures, respectively.","inCitations":["37bb68a0fdf63d502f3ee838fe7b00496930ae63"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Communication: Electronic flux induced by crossing the transition state.","doi":"10.1063/1.5018236","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1063/1.5018236","venue":"The Journal of chemical physics"}

Materials and Methods: Fifty LDLT donors (39 males and 11 females) their age 20-37 years (mean age 20.8 years) referred from liver transplantation surgeons to radiology Departments at Dar Al Fouad Hospital for doing preoperative MRCP during the period from April 2009 to March 2011. Intraoperative cholangiography (IOC) was used as the reference standard. The MRCP was performed on 1.5 Testa MR magnets using respiratory triggering techniques T2-weighted sequences in axial/coronal thin sections, and variable-thickness rotating slabs. The accuracy of preoperative MRCP for biliary mapping in potential LDLT donors was analyzed compared to the IOC findings. Results: Of the 50 donors, MRCP showed only 12 (24%) had type K1 anatomy (classical branching patterns of the biliary system). The remaining 38 subjects had anatomical variants: 17 (34%) had type K2a, 3 (6%) had type K2b, 10 (20%) had type K3a, 4 (8%) had type K3b, 2 (4%) had type K4 and 2 (4%) had unclassified pattern (type K6). Compared with IOC findings as the reference standard in our study, MRCP correlated with IOC in 48 (98%) of 50 subjects. Conclusion: Preoperative MRCP accurately depicts the biliary anatomy and variants in LDLT donors and should be used in the preoperative workup of all donors, to allow exclusion of unsuitable donors, thus ensuring donor safety and optimal recipient outcome.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://medicaljournalofcairouniversity.net/home2/images/pdf/2013/march/06.pdf"],"title":"Role of MR Cholangiography in Evaluation of Hepatic Biliary Morphology in Living Liver Donors","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

The inclusion of spectra of model solutions in the program LC Model confirmed the assignments in situ. The first postmortem phase was characterized mainly by changes in the concentrations of metabolites usually observed in vivo and by the appearance of previously reported decay products. About 3 days postmortem, new metabolites, including free trimethylammonium, propionate, butyrate, and iso-butyrate, started to appear in situ. Since the observed metabolites and the time course is comparable in sheep and human brain tissue, the model system seems to be appropriate.","inCitations":["ddbf2eeb5bb5e4c7ef033715438f90140d59c472","83a15165b5b01a7cfabadcd1e565a5eeda9aa126","7980f3c7aac7066e93b667b4bc7936d096e5bff0","502b48a85804507c4a2f83ccb5bf19a63086d8c1","05b2b80693da34c505af104cc0c99f111c474c51","df354182061825a9c4de1e779c41560fa0ca802d","0cbb89bed9219587f525778b042f4a1834e6b1a5","e39a55d3cbe3e38b449d2b7e9cfd8b3c4efc24bf","66789cf0663ab76479bf8504912b3555d6fbbe52","cca43e7df6d6da86031268f090a0ca1df8a844b7","c4e93a1949c2d6a81fa6634b1362b26a884765b8","5f967d6dbd9826991034c2605f4169e00b30b904","af80c1c4296a9aa80a5b90ea9156344fa8f9617c","00b91470ab85b05321bb3c19b36d84aa3f6efbc4","82e92926b5c1ee63f360ddbcb8e360c1aaca9aa2","9909efa7b499f32c043b5f74e06a6c5ca8fd67b9","037c089423a3553ff713e28188d129aa449edbe5","3e6788ab905803a0cf0599e32c32efb51a12c131","0c777b769c1dff72a9215652c6777912ee79ffd4","82fa1a912a61f4a586af88298ff14194f57817bd"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Observation and identification of metabolites emerging during postmortem decomposition of brain tissue by means of in situ 1H-magnetic resonance spectroscopy.","doi":"10.1002/mrm.10294","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1002/mrm.10294","venue":"Magnetic resonance in medicine"}

Studying differences in rural household energy consumption across different villages allows local governments to strengthen rural energy policy and adjust measures to local conditions. We selected typical villages and used questionnaires and household interviews to investigate differences in rural household energy consumption in mountainous areas, semi-mountainous areas and plains across the Loess Hilly Region of Gansu province. Results indicate obvious differences among village types. In mountainous areas households mainly depend on straw, and coal, animal manure, solar energy, fuel wood and biogas to a lesser extent. In semi-mountainous areas they mainly depend on coal, and straw, fuel wood and solar to a lesser extent. On plains they mainly depend on coal, and firewood, straw, solar and fuel wood to a lesser extent. These energy combinations prove that farmers tend to make full use of their own resources to achieve maximum utility. Villages on plains have the highest average consumption of coal at 1354.6kgce; villages in mountainous areas use the lowest at 655.27kgce; and semi-mountainous areas are in the middle at 1007.41kgce. The average consumption of straw is highest in mountainous areas (833.18kgce), and least on the plains (162.48kgce). Energy for cooking and heating accounts for most of the energy consumed. Villages in mountainous areas rely on a kang to warm them in winter and in semi-mountainous areas heat is supplied by a combination of kang and stove. Water loss and soil erosion are very serious problems across this part of Gansu and environmental and economic problems should be considered as a whole and resolved together when developing rural energy programs. Based on the differences in energy use described here, we propose a‘Four-in-One’ecological model for energy use on plains, the‘One Pool with Three Improvements’biogas courtyard model for semi-mountainous areas and the‘Five Combined Components’orchard ecological homestead model for villages in moun- tainous areas. These programs are discussed.","inCitations":["c27e3dfecb08d5c1283c1568e92aec7c5dcca533"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Differences in Rural Household Energy Consumption Across the Loess Hilly Region of Gansu","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

In 2000, the Millennium Summit of the United Nations established reducing child mortality as one of eight Millennium Development Goals for the year 2015. In 1990, one in 11 children died before reaching age 5; by 2017, it had fallen to one in 26. Between 1990 and 2017 under-five mortality rates declined from 93.2 per 1000 live births to 39.1 per 1000 live births, with the rate falling in all World Health Organization regions. Mortality rates among older children and young adolescents (aged 5–14) also dropped, by more than 50%. Yet, despite this survival success, too many children continue to live under adverse conditions that do not allow them to develop, learn, work, and thrive to healthy, productive adulthood. In addition, too many countries were unable to achieve the targeted Millennium Development Goals in child and maternal health. Whether living in impoverished families or marginalized communities, children continue to die because of their status and the environments into which they are born. In 2015 the United Nations General Assembly adopted seventeen Sustainable Development Goals to be achieved by the year 2030. These goals address global challenges including poverty, inequality, climate change, environmental degradation, prosperity, and peace and justice. With the Sustainable Development Goals, the focus has expanded from child survival to addressing the psychosocial and physical environment that strongly influence the developmental and health outcomes needed for children to thrive. A global focus on adverse childhood conditions and thriving is critical because the world is increasingly interconnected in health and disease. Also, a growing proportion of births worldwide occur in countries outside North America. It is estimated that by 2050, the African continent will account for 42% of all global births and 40% of all children under the age of 18. The article in this month’s issue by Berens et al. contributes to this necessary focus by developing a measure of the psychosocial conditions that influence a child’s ability to thrive in the austere conditions of a resource-limited setting. The study is an excellent example of collaborative research that attempts to decipher how adversity can disrupt foundational developmental processes, but also incorporates appropriate cultural humility in its international context and framework for local adaptation in Bangladesh. They are commended for their consideration of multiple dimensions of validity and community participatory processes including conducting interviews and focus groups with parents and pretesting questions using cognitive interviewing methods. These are important components in measure development for a specific population. Translation and back translation of measures to other languages also requires careful attention. Their validation of a Childhood Psychosocial Adversity Scale used in Bangladesh can help assess early childhood needs and guide interventions on a population level. It is well known from the literature on adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) that chronic activation of the stress response can lead to poor health outcomes beyond early childhood. These include dysregulation of the neuroendocrine and immune system development, altered cardiovascular functioning, metabolic dysregulation leading to obesity and type 2 diabetes, and epigenetic modifications that alter gene expression. Differential risk susceptibility in individual children can be accounted for by adaptive capacities that are influenced by supportive environments; hence the need for emphasis on development of such support in settings worldwide. Amelioration of the toxic stress response and understanding how the response can be mitigated in global health settings should be a high priority for the worldwide pediatric community in order to promote resiliency and buffering of the stress response for all children. This requires an explicit focus on social determinants of health and the social and physical environments of children and their families. Evidence suggests that interventions to create strong social relationships may prevent and ward off long-term impacts of ACEs. Interventions and policies to prevent and buffer adversities such as those emphasized in the Sustainable Development Goals are critical to ensuring the health of the world’s children. In 2019, the World Health Organization identified ten Threats to Global Health. While six threats relate to infectious disease (global influenza pandemic, antimicrobial resistance, Ebola and other high threat pathogens, vaccine hesitancy, dengue, HIV), four relate to the psychosocial and physical environment or access to care (air pollution and climate change, fragile and vulnerable settings, noncommunicable diseases, weak primary health care). For children worldwide the focus must remain on infectious disease while expanding to address social determinants of health which influence susceptibility to infection and other diseases. The first Sustainable Development Goal is “No Poverty”, a goal that would disproportionately improve the lives of children. The 2016 UNICEF report Ending Extreme Poverty: A Focus on Children found that children are more than twice as likely as adults to live in extreme poverty. In 2013, 19.5% of children in low and middleincome countries (LMICs) were living in households that survived on an average of US $1.90 a day or less per person (compared with only 9.2% of adults). Globally almost 385 million children live in extreme poverty, with the youngest children most at risk. The World Bank’s flagship report Poverty and Shared Prosperity 2016: Taking on Inequality documented that half of the 767 million people globally living on less than $1.90 per day are under the age of 18. These estimates were based on data from 89 countries representing 83% of the developing world’s population. It is clear that poverty is associated with negative health and","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Global Child Health: beyond surviving to thriving","doi":"10.1038/s41390-019-0574-6","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41390-019-0574-6","venue":"Pediatric Research"}

However, the tectonic activities have resulted with a fragile regional geology. Moreover, the high mountainous topography causes high overburden pressure in the underground structures causing squeezing and other stability problems. Thus the huge tunnelling potential can only be materialised by applying professional and scientific approaches.This thesis focuses on the stress induced problems with special reference to squeezing. Main objectives of this study were to review and check validity of the available tunnel stability assessment methods, to carry out relevant laboratory tests and interpret the results, and to use a numerical modelling code. In the present study, two projects have been used as case studies, both located in Nepal Himalayan region. These are Khimti1 hydropower project - a completed project; and Melamchi water supply project - yet to be constructed. Both projects include tunnels through series of weak rock mass strata with high overburden stress.One of the factors that may cause stability problems in a tunnel is the stress level acting around the opening. A tunnel fails when the stress exceeds the strength of rock mass. If the stress level does not exceed the rock mass strength, but is sufficient up to a critical level to cause creep, it may lead to rock failure after some time. In a tunnel stability assessment, the determination of the critical stress level is important. Creep tests were carried out on the Melamchi gneiss and the critical stress level has been determined.The resulted creep test curves were calibrated to obtain rheological parameters. Tunnel deformations including time-effect, were calculated for a given stress level. Based on the creep test results at various uniaxial stress levels, an equation is obtained for the relation between the strain rate and stress level. Back analyses have been carried out using the available empirical, semi-analytical and analytical methods and FLAC3D code; the results have been found to be in close agreement with the tunnel convergence measurements in the Khimti tunnel. So these methods were used in the Melamchi tunnel design.In the 66 squeezing tunnel cases from around the world and the Khimti case study, it was observed that the rock mass strength (corresponding to rock type) has a significant influence on squeezing phenomena. Thus the available squeezing prediction criteria based on the rock mass classification alone, need to be updated by including rock mass strength as well. Similarly, ‘valley side effect of topography’ has been found to influence the tunnel deformation in the Khimti project. It has opened an area for a further study to correlate the valley side effect of topography to the stress increase in the tunnel.","inCitations":["53d2afb777177359ee68f2c3a1e0e9838d47568e","80ed076d821f8279628e9087cede630116251893","10fb9a76f95fa34f8c87146bdc8437bf6f04cec1","b269b12b3c1568f0e686ccfbc150f5fee0c5c9e4","d8827058ce1e1bb448bf21d4e0a327faec6e219a","47ae538a56354b3db6a4989d18fc6ce0e7ef362b","b38f3cde52225219ad30dfcf2316777957dc6adc","d8e0c300de64c383b4ec587fccefbf723625889f","82dedcf1f0af220c7572ae15f65c689116378fda","2577a9f50b6615625f9f9484aeca6c20e9396384","1070abde99b7c5a1cbb153e39fbaa6f27222f53e","610104081a46b358cf8d2b7ab406558fc7ebdfac"],"pdfUrls":["https://brage.bibsys.no/xmlui/bitstream/handle/11250/248703/123175_FULLTEXT01.pdf?isAllowed=y&sequence=1"],"title":"Stress Induced Problems in Himalayan Tunnels with Special Reference to Squeezing","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

As many as nine different cp32s appear to be capable of stable replication within a single spirochaete. Here, we show that a construct (pCE310) containing a 4 kb fragment from the putative maintenance region of a B. burgdorferi CA-11.2A cp32 was capable of autonomous replication in both high-passage B. burgdorferi B31 and virulent B. burgdorferi 297. Deletion analysis revealed that only the member of paralogous family 57 and the adjacent non-coding segment were essential for replication. The PF32 ParA orthologue encoded by the pCE310 insert was almost identical to the PF32 orthologues encoded on the B31 and 297 cp32-3 plasmids. The finding that cp32-3 was selectively deleted in both B31 and 297 transformants carrying pCE310 demonstrated the importance of the PF32 protein for cp32 compatibility and confirmed the prediction that cp32 plasmids expressing identical PF32 paralogues are incompatible. A shuttle vector containing the CA-11.2A cp32 plasmid maintenance region was used to introduce green, yellow and cyan fluorescent protein reporters into B. burgdorferi. Flow cytometry revealed that the green fluorescent protein was well expressed by almost 90% of both avirulent and infectious transformants. In addition to enhancing our understanding of B. burgdorferi plasmid biology, our results further the development of genetic systems for dissecting pathogenic mechanisms in Lyme disease.","inCitations":["54e1c41335f8b3a307bae8afdb2001f7bbf2f2b1","42a8d85e737e95e487bcf834c51c5a53ca4048c8","d2afb2fefa4101ace33dd99f0b2e305456f39c3e","15a8e3bbf9b44ca005b51e74c110367937c7ab9e","71801027959a936f7228f9ce2ca524adb85d5bd4","ba3d203b6b447e54c05e3434f2916580413595fb","d68c8abd006382d43d3ee94b0116a199c315295a","5dade4ae46a9300e2369940764fe1cf515adc9ae","027f07630b6f60e40d6e16ef5fbfb0e2a7ffa136","63df6bd3913dfd0e946af3f494bbecdc418082a2","38db5e6b8b1529c1f66b1286ceea2b466484be63","aa77acde7f8e5e66c301ff7a827ecfa8b206c02e","65854fcfe108bef0cf2d200587b4d214fc186c45","4268d4faa6816f266b2904cebcfc512c74f20267","da90d35960d68de4c88a3ccce686c94fa7fc5a3d","5b56589e97bc97f42b596e1bd0106da0d3c25e2d","ab20aeb6c42693f816531aadd247e5158dc773e0","6ce2a5e0c8177d7e3414b33bac46acb04a3e63ba","0b2934f012313c1e549fbe6d46179076a44925dc","90666127d16bd46856d5c2f4fb39a163fe3bb67c","e074717a97df1a01472d82990e0cb31834cbf621","15dadf8e3101b30482d3eec4ef36a80299a518c9","6cdb0db2d6d9521c68a6032fbfe0283334a7f70b","a3707a3424fea6f339bd09143f42bca9ebf68ff8","11878013b6e8457aed78256c544084a29fb376b7","722e41b767909acfac7e9131ef2d8c6f66c18554","3e761062c533acb1aa423a0a01ae46b139af1aef","0566a598a2218b0586cc1f5e66de7c6afe79d95f","4cc4b74404f71873deeb140e92f19420ac4b5c50","8013da5a1bbe04a7c77e2fa9390fb7558a397d0b","daae074b8f8c93fe5a29a7f3ecebf529d39c55c2","1479ba5274db3491a9c3c2798af63d9b8dd920fb","d716d3c0280375aac6a521c5e5676fd861adde3a","cad12ab8030a90281d17529644b106fcf070bb4e","e6a69c07533ba9c26b18a9af614198e0fb5fcaca","640f1e85567598c94e875d1df659af7d6cd43183","3a6c461c65f52e135b6c24467cb98222a8f12d2e","867885e3174b7e48590372a5d43201cf4b96703c","88fb773452c23d4154f54a4adc9e8d3631aa00ea","9bca1a3ff6071acc24333063506c6748128b3f2f","e34cc2395b2c693830fa7791728f45efee737ea7","71d00b6bd6ee1e6bc7d2544418cb3adc62f9e392","69fdae514443d23ee4f5afc273a34e318e804a2e","3c7a06fbaef729494e187dd0d045675b5afb85ac","863982ff599b143e5c56bf31a35cd8d4b4dc9913","43c71e684aa30d80e9d6ff101efe11c57914cd05","f1f1c1c9b770b72fbf254bd0b92e1e348496d282","3a608e8a6f2e87a074afc91ab5a4991e07afb212","2069891ff7926529934ec6954432e608a62b5cb6","de68fa1163353948e7678a82956c61087a9dc75e","373e63076c3c53f1e76a1093355fec06b6590ba9","5956e019afa719e29634d23954fd45c3404fa333","983b8f39ebeb4513c3bf2f0bdd7e841dbac14ef2","133572542d1d83ee3086f85a848f68b7e96a21d1","efcd16ad25f0cb8cc30ccea1394ee59edde7b8eb","2ed051f81d29738cea82029926b29183cd40360a","3c64094adc47f92d3343c0ec8b5ed73fbc628053","2753dae870b00ee2361ac44a68652ee5ae07c926","80921aeadc8f759c889846cae331d96f858a8dcd","271312e133e9c955df777e6a78d81490cf2a2ec7","1e9031c15110958c327daa3aea96fa94fb5bd415","48a6451a420d5233fb9b6deddfa4449f493cf2af","d4b4d896661283d8373369f747a6208e4f8078eb","933e9ec9d09b6b819c2f12d3190ccab847a194c6","551e870990eb52d8e2a0ea167c28da48562182a7","71b80faac19dcdcf043b4b8c230b407496c79222","e8432d7fc0244d3f00b0e5295c5e592f8ab08bb4","ad3538dfcdcb43f94225665f57944d2b67ae0f56","7abe96bb4af728436587aa4affbb2277fc7b3307","9cd80adc3e88457ac0a03e8adfd5e0bdc6e63a52","75f8b6edb9c84524bfd079f6a7c26d0ac2cfc675","beff2088bcb110e6a67f6ffb56456f267900bf5e","feccaa2cc1d8d1bbf7e7a267b47f17f3eba04ecf","42a9655a0d3d870d52ab3850f636ec87e1e69f9c","4395875a2770ec8ddc4409ea05d380965fac04f4","8d0514453d87fbdc9182bfe5482da83d5e6aa26b","2eba4708299feedf0bd2b1d07e164d7351c77c16","8b9804a9447b7da03fa8a5afb21bbed0b62f0414","a7a27c3e384304b5f75699915ec8b44c3197de6e","6be7ca1aa5a571e78ddc8c397e893743ab16c1ea","6afc446be68bc7fc2fb9007d3dbca24f5edfd2c4","48b00053073c4ee9b33d1eedf872742b1a869b75","180dda637c78fcb687b9605f4ef2b980e6fa7041","de9a0c4fbaf7a38e16b695f74a24ed81a280bf99","afeca98476d3d2b1af6a479f26a4eb04ddfb8142","db02b4b39474da8eba2ab3388df66983e1bb202c","87e856a17bdd9524b3c521422022dee7a2c067c5","8be1765f302870f39db0a74867cc3a7ecb17ae97","c71c370639988b00b8322f7e3771bc43caf89290"],"pdfUrls":["http://pbil.univ-lyon1.fr/members/lobry/articles/GenRes_2000_10_1594.kim/EggersCH.pdf"],"title":"Identification of loci critical for replication and compatibility of a Borrelia burgdorferi cp32 plasmid and use of a cp32-based shuttle vector for the expression of fluorescent reporters in the lyme disease spirochaete.","doi":"10.1046/j.1365-2958.2002.02758.x","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2958.2002.02758.x","venue":"Molecular microbiology"}

We address these issues in a sequence of tuffaceous muds and volcaniclastics at International Ocean Discovery Program Site U1437 and produce the longest continuous magnetic polarity stratigraphy in the history of scientific ocean drilling. Remanence measurements were filtered to remove intervals affected by fluidization, plastic sediment disturbance, and core biscuiting. Drilling overprints are concentrated in the disturbed annulus surrounding intact core material. Bioturbation was limited to a vertical extent of at most 15 cm. Changes in sediment color, stiffness, and magnetic hysteresis all suggest that remanence was locked in within a few meters of the sediment–water interface. We did not observe any systematic offset between magnetostratigraphic and biostratigraphic datums. Authigenic growth of greigite, in response to both initial sulfate reduction in the upper 50 m of the sediment column and to deeper resupply of sulfate, has led to magnetic overprinting. Anomalous polarity artefacts, extending <5 m and occurring within about 20 m below a real polarity transition, appear to be due to a chemical remanence acquired by greigite produced during early diagenesis. Diagenetic magnetic mineral alteration resulted in the progressive loss of fine-grained magnetite, which enhanced susceptibility to drilling and post-drilling overprints and increased the resistance of these overprints to removal by conventional demagnetization. We recovered the magnetostratigraphic record from many samples with resistant overprints through low-temperature demagnetization through the Verwey transition. This article is protected by copyright.

NWA 032 is similar to Apollo 12 and 15 olivine basalts; however, low whole-rock MgO combined with high olivine phenocryst abundance suggests that NWA 032 represents a previously unsampled mare basalt. Mineralogy, Textures and Composition: Northwest Africa 032 is a crystalline basalt (SiO2 = 44.7 wt.%) with olivine and pyroxene phenocrysts. The groundmass is composed mostly of bundles of elongate pyroxene and plagioclase (An86) crystals radiating from common nucleation sites. Groundmass pyroxenes are zoned from ~ Wo10 to Wo40 and En05 to En45. Other groundmass minerals include elongate splays of ilmenite, equant grains of troilite and rare Fe metal. Phenocrysts of olivine (~12 vol.%) and pyroxene (~5 vol%) range up to ~ 200 μm across and are surrounded by FeO-rich rims <5 μm wide. Small equant chromite phenocrysts are typically included within or occur adjacent to olivine. Pyroxene phenocrysts exhibit complex variations in CaO, Al2O3, MgO, and FeO, but both olivine and pyroxene are characterized by decreasing Mg/(Mg + Fe) from core to rim. Phenocryst interiors have broad zoning profiles with Mg/(Mg + Fe) ranging from 0.65 to 0.55. Steeper compositional profiles, with Mg/(Mg + Fe) descending to ~0.5, occur adjacent to the FeO-rich quenched margins. The quenched margins have Mg/(Mg + Fe) as low as 0.15. Where olivine and pyroxene phenocrysts are intergrown, an FeO-rich margin does not occur along the olivine/pyroxene interface, indicating that the phenocrysts grew together before the groundmass crystallized. Shock effects include whole-rock melt veins, maskelynitization of feldspar, and undulatory to mosaic extinction in olivine phenocrysts, suggesting shock pressures in excess of 25 GPa [2]. The whole-rock oxygen isotopic composition (δO = +5.6‰, δO = +2.9‰) falls on the terrestrial fractionation line. Mn/Fe ratios in pyroxene and olivine are within the ranges identified for lunar rocks and are distinct from values associated with the Earth, Mars, and Vesta [3,4]. The major element composition is similar to low-Ti (TiO2 = 3.0 wt. %) mare basalt. Petrogenesis and Lunar Origin: The broadly zoned phenocrysts with distinct FeO-rich rims and the radiating texture of groundmass crystals indicate that rapid crystallization followed relatively slow phenocryst growth in NWA 032. Preliminary modelling using MELTS [5] suggests that spinel, olivine, and pyroxene crystallize from a melt of NWA 032 comp osition as temperature drops from ~ 1200 to 1150°C under low pressure (1 bar), whereas high pressure (5 kb) suppresses olivine crystallization. NWA 032 is similar in major element composition to mare basalts collected during Apollo 15 [6], but has a higher concentration of olivine phenocrysts (12 vs. 0.1 to 8.6 vol.%). NWA 032 is similar to Apollo 12 basalts in olivine phenocryst abundance [6], but has significantly lower whole-rock MgO (8.5 vs. 11.5 to 16.5 wt.%). These data suggest that NWA 032 represents a previously unsampled mare basalt. References: [1] Grossman J. G. (2000) Meteoritical Bulletin, 84, in press. [2] Stöffler D. et al.

However, their criticisms could, at least in some of their more general aspects, be taken to apply to all of the contributions to the special issue ofPoetics in which our paper appeared, and of which we were Guest Editors. We would therefore wish this reply to be in turn understood as having a wider reference than to our paper alone, and we shall in fact have occasion to refer, if only briefly, to the work of several of our colleagues. We consider Peterson’s and Wuggenig’s commentaries together under the following three headings: data, analytical methods and interpretation, although as regards methods we are chiefly concerned with Wuggenig’s position. 1. Data Both Peterson and Wuggenig seek to show that our paper is flawed through its reliance on the secondary analysis of data of a kind that is inadequate to our substantive concerns. As a preliminary point here, we may note that Peterson (p. 301) begins by contrasting our approach with that ofBourdieu (1984) which, in his view, ‘represents a classic case of a purpose-built questionnaire’. The contrast is unfortunate, for while Bourdieu’s questionnaire is indeed purpose-built, his survey is technically flawed both as regards sampling 1 and – as we","inCitations":["d4e3b1200f0fcc65dddd767be2f5679e947b9c1f","562b692c48a8591360729277bec8e997ea7cd493","8974683e87727a85b96efa6f1116fec2cee7ac8b","7bfcde13da91cfb3daa0353be35e5de31778fdbc","7dd6ac26c8ec7bbd113eee5c1ee1528226b9d18b","c5472150cdd89b3ea5375aaea0812b8402bbfcac","07c062da013125534e36ef5a9adb695928054f2d","6f5dad925816f2f0d6e897538c5066fd6dbd46bb","dc0df67cde0d18750a6eb0c18895f92c1fb70fff","854774de5eef2b9c46a78a78a4545183a5e84219","aaf3ed6db4f049be8738aa9b978898a6351fa8df"],"pdfUrls":["http://users.ox.ac.uk/~sfos0006/papers/poetics2007reply.pdf"],"title":"Data, methods and interpretation in analyses of cultural consumption: A reply to Peterson and Wuggenig","doi":"10.1016/j.poetic.2007.06.004","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.poetic.2007.06.004","venue":""}

With an increasing demand for container-grown plant materials for use within Hawaii and for shipment to the mainland United States, the need for a soilless growing medium made with locally available materials has be­ come more important. One such mix proposed by Voss and Watson (1968) was composed of volcanite, a tra­ chyte-pumice volcanic material from a specific cinder cone on the island of Hawaii, mixed with wood shav­ ings. Because supplies of wood shavings are limited, and due to recent interest in composting waste products from animal industries, it was decided to test these materials to determine if they could be used as a satisfactory sub­ stitute for wood shavings as an organic amendment for growing plants in a volcanite mix.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://www.ctahr.hawaii.edu/oc/freepubs/pdf/HRN-9.pdf"],"title":"Preliminary Evaluation of Compost for Potting Media Mixtures","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

The Lattice Boltzmann (LB) method can accommodate the complex geometry of mussel clusters. This hydrodynamic model is expanded to incorporate physiological activity, in order to quantify the relationship between mussels, the surrounding flow and the spatial distribution of phytoplankton concentration (the mussel food supply). Uptake results, from simulations at the smallest scale of modelling, quantify the non-linear effect of competition for phytoplankton and are shown to be generally independent of diffusive conditions. Statistics of phytoplankton uptake and the hydrodynamic drag force of the cluster are absorbed into a second scale of consideration. Approaches for generating optimal arrangements under various physical constraints at this (medium) scale are presented and compared, following the objective of maximising collective phytoplankton uptake. It is found that branching structures are optimal in limited domains of unidirectional flow, nets perpendicular to unidirectional flow are more efficient in larger areas and spirals are optimal in flow of varied direction. Lastly, analysis of the efficiency of some presently used structures is given, along with methodological suggestions for integrating the optimisation process into large scales, such as an aqua fa11n in a bay environment.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://ir.canterbury.ac.nz/bitstream/handle/10092/5970/smith_thesis.pdf?isAllowed=y&sequence=1"],"title":"Optimal marine farm structures.","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

One of the pivotal transcription factors induced by hypoxia is Hif-1α. However, in serous ovarian cancer (SEOC), Hif-1α expression is not a prognostic biomarker. This study aims to assess the hypothesis that the serine-threonine kinase Nek6 functions as a downstream effector cooperating with Hif-1α in driving ovarian cancer aggressiveness. Nek6 was overexpressed and Hif-1α was silenced in A2780 cells. Nek6 was also stably silenced in Hey cells. The dependence of Nek6 expression on Hif-1α was assayed as a function of hypoxic growth conditions. Nek6 interaction with the cytoskeletal gateway of drug resistance was investigated with far western blot. The co-expression of NEK6, HIF1A, TUBB3 and GBP1 transcripts was quantified with qPCR in two cohorts of SEOC patients (346 locally treated patients and 344 from the TCGA dataset). Nek6 expression is induced by hypoxia in a Hif-1α dependent fashion. Nek6 directly interacts with GBP-1, thus being a component of the cytoskeletal gateway of drug resistance. Nek6 overexpression increases and silencing decreases the anchorage-independent growth of cultured cells. In SEOC patients, NEK6 expression is significantly correlated with HIF1A. Co-expression of NEK6, HIF1A, TUBB3 and GBP1 transcripts identifies a subset of SEOC patients characterized by poor outcome and drug resistance. This study demonstrates the functional relevance of Nek6 in the context of the adaptive response to hypoxia in SEOC. This finding may help identify a sub-population of patients at high risk of relapse to standard first-line chemotherapy.","inCitations":["9336d71f561e26aae6ec842dc45fae76c6956a21","4d814744a79cf82c33db844afe9ec71a74103565","eaafac2f6e6d56c91c92e4adaf756074d1a2e727","9e7525861a6c0ab2f4f6d86b2b9d0c318ef2c44c","93e5c4b2b5f7ccaa0312eebe884eb9ae10af5e7e","e2fc802230b3a651482cac1c1a46186c75036e48","1858cb5272da61737f9f5cd4c9a0bcf511069bd7"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Nek6 and Hif-1α cooperate with the cytoskeletal gateway of drug resistance to drive outcome in serous ovarian cancer.","doi":"","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"American journal of cancer research"}

Clinical evaluation of disease in pigs included daily examination, rectal temperature measurements and cardiac and respiration rates. Haematological studies included: hematocrit (%), hemoglobin (g/dl), and white cell, neutrophil, lymphocyte and eosinophil counts. Blood biochemistry included: bun (mg/dl), creatinine (mg/dl), AST (UI/l), ALT (UI/l), CPK (UI/l) and ALP (UI/l). No significant differences were observed in rectal temperature and in cardiac and respiration rates between inoculated animals and the control group (p> or =0.05). Significant differences were detected (p< or =0.05) in the values of % hemoglobin, and eosinophils, as well as in the values of CK, ALP, AST and ALT. The variations observed in some cases were related to the number of T. spiralis larvae inoculated and varied with the number of days post-infection. Inoculated pigs showed significant differences (p< or =0.05) in weight gain when compared with uninoculated controls. This study has clinical, haematological, and enzyme alterations in Trichinella infected pigs provides a better understanding of acute and chronic trichinellosis in pigs.","inCitations":["a98c2ca63401843e4a75c8f7981e3b340945d20d","ebe80ae15577929f3d273b49422fd01d51c41811","05d6d459866aae102afd478951057bf17785afb7","085b8346a5a722380296ccbbad3777bda000b63c","18a3b8d8fb7fd92aea6cddf3c153bcf36464f88b","12c044449611b0c34d90d28ad767b3656a485b69","a25bd0c49d6f3ecfe297454571385d4f4685f017"],"pdfUrls":["https://naldc.nal.usda.gov/download/10203/PDF"],"title":"Clinical, haematological, biochemical and economic impacts of Trichinella spiralis infection in pigs.","doi":"10.1016/j.vetpar.2007.04.017","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetpar.2007.04.017","venue":"Veterinary parasitology"}

Recently, there has been an increasing interest in using synthetic (D,L)-tartaric acid as a substitute. Several toxicological studies have been published on L(+)-tartaric acid, but practically nothing concerning the racemic form. The metabolism of L(+)-tartaric acid has been investigated in a variety of species including man. Species differences have been noted in the ability to excrete the acid in the urine after oral administration. The decomposition of tartaric acid by the intestinal flora has been implicated as an important factor. (Underhill et al., 1931 a,b).

Washed cells transported [14C]lactose and [methyl-14C]beta-D-thiogalactoside, a nonmetabolisable analog of lactose, at similar rates and with similar affinities (Km for transport, less than 1 microM). Transport was inhibited to various extents by the uncoupling agent carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone, by unlabeled beta-galactosides and D-galactose, and by osmotic shock. The accumulation ratio for methyl-beta-D-thiogalactoside was greater than or equal to 4,100. An abundant protein (molecular weight, 41,000) was purified from osmotic-shock fluid and shown by equilibrium dialysis to bind lactose and methyl-beta-D-thiogalactoside, the former with very high affinity (binding constant, 0.14 microM). The N-terminal amino acid sequence of this lactose-binding protein exhibited some homology with several other sugar-binding proteins from bacteria. Antiserum raised against the lactose-binding protein did not cross-react with two glucose-binding proteins from A. radiobacter or with extracts of other bacteria grown under lactose limitation. Lactose transport and beta-galactosidase were induced in batch cultures by lactose, melibiose [O-alpha-D-galactoside-(1----6)alpha-D-glucose], and isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactoside and were subject to catabolite repression by glucose, galactose, and succinate which was not alleviated by cyclic AMP. We conclude that lactose is transported into A. radiobacter via a binding protein-dependent active transport system (in contrast to the H+ symport and phosphotransferase systems found in other bacteria) and that the expression of this transport system is closely linked to that of beta-galactosidase.","inCitations":["50e186c7836fadcd144373088d1ec09b7d8e6758","b8915e74f43f5c261ef4024b960ebfcf83ad0340","e25606759bf0cea29c0d23cbdbaff1db69ea53f7","98097ffaa9f8a15b6e78383aee0270243248e21d","5a6a3d7831b1d118f113f85dfc7ebc9330f0844b"],"pdfUrls":["http://jb.asm.org/content/172/4/1703.full.pdf"],"title":"Binding-protein-dependent lactose transport in Agrobacterium radiobacter.","doi":"10.1128/jb.172.4.1703-1710.1990","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1128/jb.172.4.1703-1710.1990","venue":"Journal of bacteriology"}

Imazaquin was applied preemergence at 140 g ai ha−1. Subsoiling in the fall did not affect imazaquin dissipation, total volume of runoff, imazaquin concentration in runoff, or imazaquin concentration in soil, as determined by chemical extraction. A corn root bioassay revealed no differences due to tillage systems in plant-available imazaquin in soil. Imazaquin concentration measured by chemical extraction or bioassay diminished over time, with a half-life ranging from 8 to 25 d. A field bioassay utilizing cotton and corn was conducted in 1997 and 1998 using plots that had received imazaquin the previous year. In 1997, 2 wk after planting, cotton and corn injury ranged from 3 to 15%, whereas no injury was observed in 1998. Injury symptoms declined over time, with no injury 5 wk after planting in either year. Although early-season cotton stunting and slight discoloration of corn was apparent in 1997, imazaquin residues did not affect subsequent vegetative and reproductive growing patterns of cotton or corn. In 1998, corn and cotton height were significantly greater in subsoiled plots compared to conventional tillage.
