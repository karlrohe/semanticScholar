Yet debugging support for such systems is woefully inadequate; typically a central user interface coordinates a set of conventional debuggers. This structure leads to synchronization problems and is limited to debugging user-mode applications. In this paper we present the design and implementation of PDB, a pervasive debugger which executes in a virtualization layer underneath the entire distributed system. By running each node of a distributed application in a separate virtual environment atop the debugger, PDB can exercise full control over the entire execution environment.","inCitations":["05c6426341a3b72053044c5aad497a0b883d5ec7","80e65d8691d8bcf51e20a6ca59ec10cb8ed6c9fe","7e708593369cef2a99a5f56129ac601d29781341","aed931ccb79bcf5cbf7304362110e37dd6819e61","03ed5059fd78882e912039b5a6003bca3651a164","5dd9aa330e222799c115b198775c576e8049e2cf","04d8ffef9ca364028ff24ff7229e4a7ca093f3e6","c19c03de80d9ce4ce02da59f8d5d543ccb2090dd","9bb264aedcda2437638465023dd7aad3c11697c6","0f27068933f21cca41983e36c3005781b34d2acd","0caf1e703f93bea22bea9ba152278a3f3c225e5e","ec91e34811ed2ba7e0930ac4bbcc0cbb596341fd","486715411c705975d79de7c12f42f79eec1abd60","afe8858d0d0da3af70b97b5603d96abd7f008943","5d419202fefa1da147c2b0531fb4eb91904460a0","d5e51f293768742c3e64433e7e1a16a62a105be0","cf89354f2f52402c462c2d794dcdd4bc9d381f98","04cf67f07eb11a6921d7524b5abd35add7e9de6d","199104025d96f8b101750407589307d8d9e8a4cc"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/srg/netos/papers/2004-grid.pdf","https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/srg/netos/papers/2004-grid.pdf","http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1033253"],"title":"PDB: pervasive debugging with Xen","doi":"10.1109/GRID.2004.49","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GRID.2004.49","venue":"Fifth IEEE/ACM International Workshop on Grid Computing"}

Reconhecida como um processo benefico, a inflamacao pode tornar-se prejudicial quando em excesso. Assim, estrategias terapeuticas que possam atuar na resolucao da inflamacao sao estudadas e desenvolvidas, tendo os produtos naturais e seus derivados um papel de destaque para as descobertas de novas moleculas anti-inflamatorias. Nesse contexto, o alcaloide 1 (3 metoxi-4-hidroxifenil)-7-metoxi-1,2,3,4 tetrahidroisoquinolina (MHTP) foi sintetizado para prospeccao de novos compostos com propriedades terapeuticas. Desta forma, o objetivo desse estudo foi avaliar o pontencial anti-inflamatorio do MHTP, in vitro e in vivo, utilizando modelo murino de inflamacao aguda. Inicialmente, foi avaliada a viabilidade celular em cultura de macrofagos peritoniais tratados com varias concentracoes de MHTP. Observou-se que o alcaloide nao apresentou citoxidade nas concentracoes de 10, 25 ou 50 μM. Nestas concentracoes o MHTP inibiu (p < 0,001) em 24%, 47% e 39% respectivamente, a producao de NO de macrofagos estimulados com LPS (1 μg/mL). Alem disso, o tratamento com 10 μM de MHTP diminuiu (p < 0,001) os niveis das citocinas IL-1β, IL-6 e IL-10 em 35,7%, 31,0% e 33,4% respectivamente, sem alterar os niveis da quimiocina MCP-1/CCL2 no sobrenadante da cultura de macrofagos. Adicionalmente foi avaliado o efeito anti-inflamatorio do MHTP in vivo. O pre-tratamento oral com MHTP (2,5, 5 ou 10 mg/kg) apresentou efeito anti-edematogenico (p < 0,05) no edema de pata induzido por carragenina inibindo a acao da PGE2 mas independente da desgranulacao de mastocitos ou atividade da histamina. O alcaloide (2,5 mg/kg) tambem foi capaz de inibir (p < 0,01) a migracao de leucocitos totais em 41,4% para a cavidade peritonial durante a inflamacao induzida com carragenina, diminuindo o numero de celulas polimorfonucleares (PMN) (59,6%) e proteinas totais (29,4%), sem alterar celulas mononucleares (MNs) e os niveis de MCP-1/CCL2, IL-1β, IL-6 e IL-10. Apos caracterizacao do efeito anti-inflamatorio, prosseguimos o estudo avaliando a atividade do MHTP no modelo experimental de lesao pulmonar aguda, onde o pre-tratamento com o MHTP (2,5 mg/kg) inibiu (p < 0,001) a migracao de celulas inflamatorias totais e PMNs para os pulmoes em 58% e 67,5%, respectivamente, sem alterar os MNs e a quantidade de proteinas totais. Os resultados obtidos nesse estudo nos permite concluir que a molecula MHTP apresenta efeito anti-inflamatorio por inibir varios componentes do processo inflamatorio inclusive parâmetros relacionados a lesao pulmonar aguda. Portanto, respaldamos o MHTP como um prototipo de molecula com atividade anti-inflamatoria no desenvolvimento de novos farmacos a serem utilizados na resolucao do processo inflamatorio.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Efeito anti-inflamatório do MHTP, uma nova moléculado tipo alcaloide tetrahidroisoquilínico","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

The success of this work will increase the available options of material selections for structural engineers for application in marine industries. The experiment was carried out with ASTM A536 grade ductile iron, which was produced using a high frequency dual track induction furnace of 2500kg, followed by subjecting the ductile iron samples to a specific parameter of heat treatment – Austenitizing (930oC for 140 minutes) and austempering (370oC for 10 minutes) in potassium nitrate salt bath to give ADI. Stress corrosion cracking (SCC) characteristics of the ADI and the standard 316 ASS specimens were evaluated in marine environment for 15 and 30 days respectively at constant strain rate of 5mm/min at room temperature. The stress-strain characteristics of exposed and unexposed specimens were compared and parameters such as yield stress, ultimate tensile strength, elongation and fracture strength were used as benchmark to assess SCC susceptibility. The study reveals that ductile iron properties (mechanical) were significantly improved after heat treatment, elongation increased by 27.04% and tensile strength by 58.62%. SCC test results show loss of elongation in the range of 23.20 – 26.48% for ADI in 15 and 30 days exposure. In contrast, 316 ASS retains most of its ductility. Both alloys retain their tensile strength in 15 days, however, there was decrease in the tensile strength of ADI by 5.93% as compared to 4.40% for 316 ASS in 30 days exposure. The fracture stress for ADI nevertheless occurred at 611.35MPa higher than 394.25MPa for 316 ASS. This indicates that ADI is significantly more resistant to SCC by providing better protection under overload condition in marine environment.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://annals.fih.upt.ro/pdf-full/2019/ANNALS-2019-2-28.pdf"],"title":"Stress Corrosion Resistance Capacity: Austempered Ductile Iron and High Strength Alloy Steels in Marine Environment","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

An approach to implementing SGA is defined and refined, indicating principles which may be used in applying the method to other engineering problems.","inCitations":["04e99987be293adfb52b6abce4e6a91c82e7a878","83a6e3655a4c430ae0b965f87c8b56e1cd1e1468","8d60ccfe51d272bdee993e70b3d287816c279915","2622ecff68e5993c718deca004c70beee7d172eb","7534f9506bd2400dcb2133ed82c3bd6da8fdb204","d6b4238c26e431c2144f81e6bdb39d924590b984","34b7a05b8de39f1fb5ebd992c505c660a1b06bc6","deccc62b8a6bc7fd04fb811f3d6c15f0c6ce8501","15e79368922261122f2d4e44b7cfb1cfd25769d1","53efe3b5b4f3ff3d014abd23382c1d190c31cc1a","c3168efbdd2fdaf12eb5bde264707d1ce4617b3f","4ea2482bba11b78e9b42702f129425300972fe73","710baa625ce42fab9913f0dd472f5627168cd5c1","42f421a9dbb7ca13efd9f004e058d1b5d7fb2c95","7276d3ac76b6c50a4f0ab3e1f9a514d056c7f67b","7355c3a9e9a97786c51b7d8bd028240767ed8342","857fbca43c1e11245d3f15f8978b87f1f0afa08c","58cf4b7686cbc05ae1eddd34848d2e4818c1d500","dbc34af0ea56b5d22fb83697afbbc9a6bb3dabda","ca928826f74eb7fba53d05b804d00fd680874127","5a851178b7c2dbdfb774aef3758ba56851b8e79b","b8f0855310d0d055bed4cdf2ae5d599d99a53f69","e069dd10af6b3b32bf030b90bb98c722e0133992","0cd6d56b268cabe525cf7d85f88026f7c98ba16d","6dc903eb08d3f63124b9c8ed698cb8ff2ea2dca2","5460a2d4e8b1c0ca3891bdff58ef48dacc6a2cb9","d64fb496120fa1be4acc9a884f70e86505b9f17d","abdd581fc847ec514b4c1498417c5f74132b8f05","223f80263a3d0038c702ab05464640b52dac1bd9","950059d749f1a46fa995fae5008caef49c2b8c09","b301482150ed590fbe6382e223722aa58f4096d8","7d0cc9b31679161f1340ac84dd348fbd9dbcf3ab","61959f1ad725dcab642ea74df32293d4061a10d5","b9b8d778f98255f8147ed93873632d072f1ed0db","72499877eac48c36c32b2c63161c25f242f5af97","d6eb9ae3b535758c92d892de164f0264dde2f428","096b0a41ef28950ba3961c4aa7d76490db689da2","b1d0fd7bb6e71f9a4e8847dc19062f01e7caee52","f674f2287b86a0c58487d993e913a8362b8a2742","8a0368710b07ddbbe1b1b67717023ee4e5de9ead","c3acb5a572a97b17b424f934d6396a4d4cf42aa3","0dddc29d52e2e02e5b3b487c7a04326d5096fc31","9ac00c64557eb541dff2d9a1aded1f402130f3f5","8401ed2cf82a5c9d732bddfb8d86265c9c135855","c625f379cd9dbe334026e7b7130f12929006bd9c","f1f21331295c2902147d87eadd9b2e1de47cca2d","946dcb34d6a04bbc7661d8e0f5db2d2c09cfa332","5bf17b3605c69a43e0dae7f2035a02b4ab720e0f","2455a6de1b4653032ce2d25c229757746456790a","7a2ddce78a4a91faa995b60ecda2d1f364122414","f31b8114cdcfae4515647720ce314fbfbe1ba31a","5a451196292ff7fbe6f4562956d2faa8c01732a4","84aba4eb759630cbeee3aafc721d8ef22091bf84","82dad8c3e2d13c84a3cc8a9416794562996f0449","34678bbbd6e4ddb2fb1d12700610b744ba9a786c","da498d6033e7505ea47709b6ba8a9fa533001356","81251748f4a68ac663564b207d8c5e95b1ec46c4","2948eca78b220e5ea1e3ae1b546f5cfdccf847a4","987b50c97d7af03fa5991be45ed9954bed69f3b5","aedaf66381077ff02c09f53d8508e02a7092cfa2"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"The use of the simple genetic algorithm in finding the critical factor of safety in slope stability analysis","doi":"10.1016/S0266-352X(02)00027-7","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/S0266-352X%2802%2900027-7","venue":""}

Even though broader concepts of frailty include psychological characteristics, frailty is largely neglected in mental health care. The aim of the present study is to examine the prevalence of physical frailty in depressed older patients and its potential overlap with depression criteria. Method: Cross-sectional observational study including 378 depressed and 132 non-depressed adults aged � 60 years according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) criteria. Physical frailty was defined as � 3 out of 5 criteria (handgrip strength, weight loss, poor endurance, walking speed, low physical activity). Results: Prevalence rates of physical frailty were 27.2% and 9.1% among depressed and non-depressed participants, respectively, which remained significant after controlling for relevant covariates (odds ratio [OR] ¼ 2.66 [95% confidence interval [C.I.] ¼ 1.36, 5.24], p ¼ .004). Physical frailty in depression was associated with more severe depressive symptoms; this association remained significant in subsequent analyses with purely physical proxies for frailty (hand grip strength, walking speed) and different severity measures of depressive symptoms. Conclusion: A quarter of depressed older patients is physically frail, especially the most depressed group. This cannot be explained by overlap in criteria and should be examined in future studies, primarily on its presumed clinical relevance.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"RESEARCH ARTICLE Physical frailty: vulnerability of patients suffering from late-life depression","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

French thinker Jean Baudrillard is the most effective and distinguished sample of the claim, the end of art. In this point, after evaluating Danto’s ideas from the modern perspective, the claim of “end of art” will be discussed through Baudrillard’s post-modern perspective. When Baudrillard directed his gaze onto the world of art, the situation he saw was not a very optimistic one. Modern art and post-modern art, in which the thinker is also included, is the production of the Western World. As a result, in this sense, the literature of art is merely valid for the modern art taking its roots from the Western World and this domain of thinking. According to Baudrillard, art has lost its own privilege and purpose; it is not made for development of culture, but for consumption of this culture; and instead of existing through its own content of meaning, it has been unconsciously spread over all segments of the society. As a result, the discussion of what is art and what is not has progressively become more ambiguous.

The intensive culture of fish has led to outbreaks of various bacterial diseases, causing economic losses to the aquaculture industryworldwide [1,2]. In the last yearsin the Mediterranean basin is registering a growing attention to some emerging bacterial fish pathogens. In the last years in the Mediterranean basin is registering a growing attention to some emerging bacterial fish pathogens. In particular Vibrio harvey, normally pathogen for crustaceans, molluscs and elasmobranchs, recently caused damage to the nervous system and septicemia in varying degrees of various fish species farmed. Also other Vibrio species such as V. splendidus, V. mediterranei, V. ordalii, V. aginolyticus, V. vulnificus, V. parahaemolyticus are becoming dangerous for the farmed fish species [3]. Among Gram negative bacterial there are also: Tenacibaculum maritimumthat causes the flexibacteriosis. The fish disease marine flexibacteriosis is characterised by necrotic lesions on the body, head, fins, and occasionally gills, with erosive lesions on the external surface as the prominent clinical sign[4,5] and the halophilic Photobacterium damselae subsp.piscicida responsible of the photobacteriosis in a great variety of fish species [6]. The disease exist in two forms the acute bacterial septicemia with a striking lack of gross clinical signs in most susceptible hosts and the chronic form with typical whitish pseudotubercles being present in the spleen[6-11]. While among the emerging bacterial diseases caused by Gram positive there are the streptococcal infections (caused by Lactococcus garvieae, Lactococccus piscium, Streptococcus iniae, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus parauberis and Vagococcus salmoninarum that affect a variety of wild and cultured fish around the world [12,13]. And therefore, streptococcosis of fish should be regarded as a complex of similar diseases caused by different genera and species capable of inducing central nervous system damage characterized by suppurative exophthalmia (“pop-eye”) [14] and meningoencephalitis.","inCitations":["41f430d42438a8438b37d166fdb4a8909461d2da"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.jacobspublishers.com/images/Aquaculture/J_J_Aquacul_Res_1_1_001.pdf"],"title":"Emerging Bacterial Pathologies in Mediterranean Mariculture","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Le coût de ces traitements atteint des nombres à six, voire même sept chiffres. Le système de santé et, avec lui, l’assurance maladie sociale se trouvent confrontés à divers défis. Nous en mentionnons certains ici de manière explicite: Nous assistons à des avancées médicales qui semblaient encore impossibles il y a seulement quelques années, mais nous nous heurtons dans le même temps à des difficultés concernant les médicaments, les vaccins ou les résistances aux antibiotiques. Nous constatons en outre que le système d’autorisation actuel n’est pas aligné sur le développement fulgurant de la médecine et se heurte à ses propres limites. La Suisse est un pays pauvre en matières premières qui doit avant tout sa richesse d’aujourd’hui à sa capacité à innover. Des innovations majeures ont vu, et voient encore le jour en priorité dans les domaines de la technique, des sciences naturelles et, précisément, de la médecine. Il est indéniable que nous ne pourrons continuer à appliquer notre recette du succès basée sur les évolutions innovantes que si nous sommes prêts à investir les ressources nécessaires, en particulier financières, dans la recherche et la formation. Dans le cas contraire, nous ne disposerons plus à l’avenir de produits innovants et hautement perfectionnés. Les nouvelles méthodes de traitement médical sont une autre des conséquences de notre capacité à innover. Elles sont synonymes d’espoir d’une vie saine, ou pour le moins acceptable malgré la maladie, pour les personnes dont la pathologie ne pouvait à ce jour pas être soignée ou dont l’évolution pouvait tout au plus être ralentie. Dans le même temps, nous déplorons l’augmentation annuelle des dépenses de santé et, conséquence directe, les primes annuelles d’assurance maladie plus chères chaque année. Sur le plan politique, tout cela entraîne une multitude de propositions politiques et de révisions des lois censées amortir la croissance des coûts liés à la santé. Le risque est que nous finissions par perdre de vue la situation dans son ensemble et que nous bloquions notre action à cause de points de détail. Les aspirations politiques et l’évolution de la médecine suivent des chemins contraires: nous saluons le progrès médical, mais nous masquons dans le même temps que cette évolution a un coût. Nous nous retrouvons ainsi face à des questions de société profondes. Nous devons impérativement poursuivre dans les mois et les années à venir le débat suivant: jusqu’où la responsabilité de l’Etat est-elle engagée concernant la santé de ses citoyens, et où commence la responsabilité personnelle de chaque citoyen? Quels sont le but et la finalité d’une assurance sociale? De quelle assurance maladie sociale voulons-nous disposer et quelles prestations doivent alors être financées? Quel tarif ces prestations peuvent-elles atteindre? S’il est admis que les réponses à ces questions ne sont pas faciles à trouver, elles nécessitent un large débat socio-politique qui doit placer en avant-plan le bienêtre de la société et le soutien apporté aux malades. Savoir dans quelle mesure et de quelle manière nous pouvons et voulons financer tout ce qui semble possible techniquement ne doit pas se résumer pas à se demander si l’assurance-maladie sociale doit rembourser telle prestation à tel prix demandé. Il serait en effet envisageable de débattre d’autres éventuelles possibilités de financement à mettre à disposition. Dans tous les cas, il est trop simpliste de réduire le débat public à une question de coût ou de financement. Seul un large débat socio-politique portant sur d’éventuelles restrictions d’accès aux produits innovants et aux possibilités de traitement novatrices permet d’atteindre le degré de légitimité démocratique souhaité pour des solutions durables et solides tant au niveau démocratique que sociétal. La situation actuelle, qui nécessite de trouver des solutions individuelles au cas par cas, n’est ni satisfaisante, ni acceptable sur le long terme.

First, the effects of mass discrimination during lead isotope analysis, using the silica-gel phosphoric acid method, are discussed in order to verify the validity of the linear discrimination law. In this discussion, we give evidence of a slight bias of the isotopic composition of the SRM 981 NBS lead standard, commonly used for mass discrimination calibrations. A rigorous way to deal with the propagation of the within-run statistical errors on the precision of the double spike correction is then presented. This allows the optimization of the parameters of the method (spike isotopic composition and precision, spiking proportion) and the calculation of the respective error associated with each corrected isotopic ratio. The perturbation of the double spike correction due to analytical contamination, which has caused previous failure in the application of the method, is avoided by preparation of the mixture between the spike and the sample at the very end of the chemical separation procedure. Using a single collector mass spectrometer, examples of application on lead standards and on a set of samples suggest a possible improvement in the precision by a factor of 3 compared to the usual method of fractionation normalization and confirm the usefulness of the method with the new generation of mass spectrometers.","inCitations":["a32d9a77c4c9bd54f94f2477c409f980f60f4427","ca7a1f1020971f57514e42bf39afb5be13f8e18f","1fe9f2453a9fdb8ced920dda2ac4b6c14a4a2a4e","87a364a8cb51be51c192568e946055b506eeb9ba","6a7af48bc404fbee03cee9746d603a36df782ae9","8bfe3d8f70c15fa537b174fa28116b6f73408cf7","7e0ff0049a75453dcf27e22f8b5bf1f25f73c365","b29e0dda219e9cabd7fcae4c26a57ec274640e30","22b79b53ed3a78ac67a19b9c5f8cfc8f53237cfd","92b104565ad0b7129c87f0ffa0abe2fff412474a","61da923b2762afc859dd8b1f190e92fb838bd74b","eaea005e84eb189185f45cbad6d3752ad9d05b29","067771430b1afeb778a2ee43dab9c85651723019","99fa33ee0ef1fb04b871a682f0aca9b2885fd069","16ac6f992142256f9d70b6f51fa9beff344ca184","555db7e38b4138367aa6a29fe9a38f3c43aba5c1","d6f3b40c92cc16016fa2798dd6f210b77401804a","7cf013ff1275cd780727d037097f965c4ba016ab","4ef57c7c700b3ef5027f58bac58505cd957998fd","8b9ea0141e43cef2433a124feced8312da75f256","0ba2f45c5e68e3bd1910e709d9196de290681d2d","9aa9b9ca0e90b8dbda3272ec125f3800d4d33c26","74a27a1ca0948551e80a70cf18632329fb65ec58","4125b48adea31af1c161a8b29e8cd6a0f2165da2"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Precise lead isotope measurements by the double spike technique: A reconsideration","doi":"10.1016/0016-7037(85)90202-9","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/0016-7037%2885%2990202-9","venue":""}

OI-RAID consists of two layers of codes, outer layer code and inner layer code. The outer layer code is based on disk grouping and Balanced Incomplete Block Design (BIBD) with skewed data layout to provide efficient parallel I/O of all disks for failure recovery. Inner layer code is deployed within a group of disks. As an example, we deploy RAID5 in both layers and present detailed performance analysis. With RAID5 in both layers, OI-RAID tolerates at least three disk failures meeting practical data availability, and achieves much higher speed up of disk failure recovery than existing approaches, while keeping optimal data update complexity and practically low storage overhead.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/DSN.2016.15"],"title":"OI-RAID: A Two-Layer RAID Architecture towards Fast Recovery and High Reliability","doi":"10.1109/DSN.2016.15","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DSN.2016.15","venue":"2016 46th Annual IEEE/IFIP International Conference on Dependable Systems and Networks (DSN)"}

This so-called sensitization to histamine is not an anaphylactic phenomenon. It is due to the action of a component of H. pertussis , the histamine-sensitizing factor (HSF), which in some unknown way overcomes the physiological mechanism in rats and mice that makes them more resistant than other species to histamine. Guinea-pigs which appear not to possess this mechanism and are about 200-fold more susceptible, weight for weight, than rats and mice, were not made more sensitive by H. pertussis . After a stated dose of vaccine, sensitization was detectable in 48 hr., reached a maximum in 3–4 days, remained at this level for about 2 weeks and gradually disappeared. The effects of dosage, route of injection, and weight and sex of mice have been examined. The HSF was found in strains of H. pertussis ; it was not found in H. parapertussis, H. bronchisepticus or H. influenzae . It was only slightly affected by heating at 70° C. for 1 hr. but was destroyed at 80° C. in ½ hr. It was destroyed when bacteria were disintegrated by shaking with glass beads, or by grinding after being freeze-dried. It was found in the supernatant fluid of a partially autolysed vaccine. HSF was antigenic. Antisera were prepared in rabbits. Anti-HSF combined with HSF and neutralized its histamine-sensitizing activity. Bacteria treated with antiserum in vitro absorbed anti-HSF and did not thereafter sensitize mice. Antiserum protected mice passively against the sensitizing action of vaccine, presumably by combining with HSF. After sensitization had developed the sensitive state was not affected by antiserum. Although HSF is an antigen there was no indication that histamine-sensitization was due to its antigenicity. The HSF was differentiated from heat-labile and heat-stable toxin, haemagglutinin, capsular material and agglutinogen. The preparation V 17, which is a small fraction of the disintegrated bacteria, adsorbed on red cell stromata (Pillemer et al. 1954) had a high histamine-sensitizing value. Compared with whole bacterial vaccine it caused little production of agglutinin in mice; in rabbits it caused a slower and smaller production of agglutinin and a faster and greater production of anti-HSF. For this reason immune rabbit sera may have a high agglutinin titre and a low anti-HSF value or vice versa. Anti-HSF rabbit serum protected mice against sensitization by V 17. Vaccines could be graded according to their histamine-sensitizing activity. This did not always correspond to their grading by agglutinin production in mice. The relation of HSF to the immunizing antigen of H. pertussis and the use of histamine-sensitization to indicate the immunizing potency of pertussis vaccines are discussed. We wish to thank Glaxo Laboratories Ltd. for the supply of reference vaccine, and the Whooping Cough Immunization Committee of the Medical Research Council for vaccines and sera.","inCitations":["a6a18d01e2fe8faa5c0b14c6e19682db7884c43d","f6d4da732e2a0c6c1e95a3728d3bb31759c04d88"],"pdfUrls":["https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/D23E2AB4B66C1C61839BEDF32D93D5A3/S0022172400000668a.pdf/histaminesensitizing_property_of_haemophilus_pertussis.pdf"],"title":"The histamine-sensitizing property of Haemophilus pertussis.","doi":"10.1017/S0022172400000668","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1017/S0022172400000668","venue":"The Journal of hygiene"}

The hardness profile revealed that the range of heat affect zone for the Al⁻Zn⁻Mg⁻Cu alloy was slightly wider than the Al⁻Li⁻Cu alloy when they suffered from the thermal transient. Additionally, the characterization of precipitates inside the different zones was obviously different, which corresponded to the microhardness distribution profile. At the periphery of the kissing line, the Al⁻Li⁻Cu and the Al⁻Zn⁻Mg⁻Cu alloys mutually diffused during the weld process. The magnesium element in the Al⁻Zn⁻Mg⁻Cu alloy diffused into the Al⁻Li⁻Cu alloy. But the copper and zinc had no change because of the low diffusion coefficient in aluminum. The heat affected zone of the Al⁻Zn⁻Mg⁻Cu alloy showed a higher corrosion susceptibility immersed into the corrosion environment, and the Al⁻Li⁻Cu alloy did not show severe corrosion.","inCitations":["a5f6bd6eeac658ff9dd9eb8e44493ed703957291","21bdaceab7e8185bb8cce67d5632bbcdc03a571b","4c0cb4aa6b1f6ddced85e63bdc6f8d542d25fa4e","d2484ac90dca55dd99b425ee1c95bc3ee98bb16d","f12d945f0b8678d117ed5ff3a3063b7139221607"],"pdfUrls":["https://res.mdpi.com/materials/materials-11-01132/article_deploy/materials-11-01132.pdf?attachment=1&filename="],"title":"A Study on Dissimilar Friction Stir Welded between the Al–Li–Cu and the Al–Zn–Mg–Cu Alloys","doi":"10.3390/ma11071132","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.3390/ma11071132","venue":"Materials"}

It was found that REAlO3 shows a preference for Al2O3-excess whereas RE3Al5O12 most readily exhibits RE2O3-excess. Also, lattice volume changes for the energetically favorable intrinsic mechanisms are relatively invariant as a function of RE cation size in RE3Al5O12, but not in REAlO3. However, in non-stoichiometric RE3Al5O12, the energetically preferred disorder mechanism results in an increasing lattice expansion with increasing RE radius whereas, in non-stoichiometric perovskites, a relatively small, radius independent, lattice contraction is predicted. These results illustrate that defect behavior in REAlO3 perovskites and RE3Al5O12 garnets is quite disimilar.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Comparison of defect processes in REAlO3 perovskites and RE3Al5O12 garnets","doi":"10.1002/pssb.201248583","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1002/pssb.201248583","venue":""}

Polymer ligands offer the advantages of synthetic simplicity along with chemical and molecular weight tunability. Here we compare the phase behavior of 5CB blended with poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) and with gold NPs functionalized with thiolated PEO (AuNP-PEO) as a function of PEO concentration by DSC, POM and 13C NMR spectroscopy. Both PEO and the AuNP-PEO form uniform dispersions in isotropic 5CB and phase separate below the I-N phase transition temperature. Above the PEO crystallization temperature, the PEO/5CB blends show the expected biphasic state of PEO rich-isotropic liquid co-existing with PEO-poor nematic droplets. At PEO concentrations above 10 wt%, nematic 5CB nucleates with PEO crystallization. Both PEO and AuNP-PEO induce homeotropic alignment of the 5CB matrix immediately below TNI. The AuNP-PEO/5CB blends form thermally reversible cellular networks similar to AuNPs functionalized with low molecular weight mesogenic ligands. A thermodynamic model to account for the observed phase behavior is presented.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Polymer functionalized nanoparticles in liquid crystals: combining PDLCs with LC nanocomposites.","doi":"10.1039/c8sm01192c","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1039/c8sm01192c","venue":"Soft matter"}

Activation of ribonuclease L also induces dimerization. Here, we demonstrate using equilibrium sedimentation that dimerization requires the binding of one 5'-monophosphate 2',5'-(adenosine)3 molecule per ribonuclease L monomer. No dimerization was observed in the absence of activator up to a protein concentration of 18 microM, indicating that unliganded enzyme is unable to dimerize or the association is very weak. In parallel with dimerization, enzymatic activity is also maximized at a 1:1 activator: ribonuclease L stoichiometry. The same stoichiometry for dimerization is observed using a nonphosphorylated activator 2'-5'-(adenosine)3. Adenosine triphosphate or RNA oligonucleotide substrates do not induce dimerization. The observed stoichiometry supports a model for ribonuclease L dimerization in which activator binds to monomer, which subsequently dimerizes.","inCitations":["d3444fe8d48a23e03fe3221ab41b7e50be0f56e8","1d87c24648b576018fcbee0561eeb584b71b959e","883cd8f1a1febf7f8ba204f77751532cf3cca731","e4edc839a71fe23441d84390c0f562e0fa9aaabd","bc63231131bf10aa74f401dfcde4d59018dfe220","e1ec61750ff7573442f453e29fc35d0afdb67f88","f7c1171a470dfd7e62b8e6a6222ba7c43a35e3ea","5f7d89f4695fa5c8837869da0e6c821d08d1e3f2","0aa79178912b17fb031fb3ddf61f42c4de6c77f5","c06fc7d923588bb424a585e759c211a20a90c3ab","883bcbf7c24c1e1a0038ab784edbcc7274fe9b3a","b80659af776eafd1fae4cbbf8928c3d8c931720e","fd7d4c54a7855286c7eab153af87b9b6ae19d7de","334ca110299d7d00ddf19c3bfaf3cda14c559392","4bd001f4788463ee8eb84408f6a96e0a9cec4c95","16be38f52af6087d319ca3d5a49715b0e40431cc","81f940830b57beb0ff7b519e40492edd830bb5dc","2cf3e642e2825decdd5e37049d90abee3a97718d","80753af7bf851474b3b2bfb2ecfccfc8786ef270","96e8ff881d79daf91a9b0077c14e918f72e49ede","3c155e2ed652376a0c045815c88a6d552343e0d9","a16cead921b31abbc1d729330a0ab760b711b558"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Stoichiometry of 2',5'-oligoadenylate-induced dimerization of ribonuclease L.

In maturity, the tissue is renewed continuously by local bone resorption and subsequent formation in a process called ‘remodeling’. Both these metabolic activities are executed by bone-resorbing osteoclastic and bone-forming osteoblastic cells. It is known that bone mass and trabecular orientation are adapted to the external forces and that alternative loading conditions lead to adaptations of the internal tissue architecture. The question is how the characteristics of external loads are sensed in the bone, and how they are translated to structural adaptation of the tissue. The time scale of the underlying processes is on the order of months, or even years. This aspect makes bone a complex research topic. In this paper, we discuss the application of computer simulation to investigate the remarkable adaptive processes.

This was a nationally representative study of the US population. Data analysis was conducted in 2018.\n\n\nExposures\nFirst noncigarette tobacco product used (none, e-cigarette, or other tobacco product) between wave 1 and wave 3.\n\n\nMain Outcomes and Measures\nEver cigarette use and current cigarette use at wave 3.\n\n\nResults\nIn the sample (N = 6123), respondents were 49.5% female; 54.1% non-Hispanic, white; and the mean (SD) age was 13.4 (1.2) years. Of these, 8.6% reported e-cigarettes as their first tobacco product, while 5.0% reported using another noncigarette product first; 3.3% reported using cigarettes first. Cigarette use at wave 3 was higher among prior e-cigarette users (20.5%) compared with youths with no prior tobacco use (3.8%). Prior e-cigarette use was associated with more than 4 times the odds of ever cigarette use (odds ratio, 4.09; 95% CI, 2.97-5.63) and nearly 3 times the odds of current cigarette use (odds ratio, 2.75; 95% CI, 1.60-4.73) compared with no prior tobacco use. Prior use of other tobacco products was similarly associated with subsequent ever cigarette use (OR, 3.84; 95% CI, 2.63-5.63) and current cigarette use (OR, 3.43; 95% CI, 1.88-6.26) compared with no prior tobacco use. The association of prior e-cigarette use with cigarette initiation was stronger among low-risk youths (OR, 8.57; 95% CI, 3.87-18.97), a pattern not seen for prior other product use. Over the 2 years between 2013 and 2014 and 2015 and 2016, 21.8% of new cigarette ever use (178 850 youths) and 15.3% of current cigarette use (43 446 youths) among US youths aged 12 to 15 years may be attributable to prior e-cigarette use.\n\n\nConclusions and Relevance\nThis study's findings support the notion that e-cigarette use is associated with increased risk for cigarette initiation and use, particularly among low-risk youths. At the population level, the use of e-cigarettes may be a contributor to the initiation of cigarette smoking among youths.","inCitations":["e56f3124b0e4837024330ef890014d4f359cf112","45e481153cfa63f2147d98b705b64db0ac9a3a41","aec744be627af70905015831fe51585df077904f","2bfaa430fa49effdbbc01859786b9d3a19513ea0","5b14386c044a0bd4e453681877cec888f6061523","257ace5bbcf6d257b5ddf6890cc611144be0ca68","dd7e413a8e3982e51a95a6bab74d7f3411fcc6e3","0fd396166604123daf72d3c88299baac940892fb","7297109c23149f81efa71fd5c8df17032ced0c93","b3787adc66422a0c26063d066aa8c14349c427a3","33cc2c974dd3387c4cc75620679ce131bdd7067d","c2133bdd7c5916fd53e038588667cc070bb20046","24ed53d554269498377894fe567a9ccfca702e39","7d08962929ea50af6b48861d790e742ce1df5854","3234c107b60f38616289ac3398c99f94619ee658","f30d63789774585fd80da355d8d2c396a2824666","29474ae8d892bdf724d136063fa02e80d9659721","5f46e7f9e5a19050bdcbdec83f4730f4159abb6f","34104c172b31a02def573d71e48492988e610fef","b9eac829d1b204fb6e464dfffce7394da79dab33"],"pdfUrls":["https://www.issup.net/files/2019-02/berry_2019_oi_180323.pdf","https://cdn.jamanetwork.com/ama/content_public/journal/jamanetworkopen/937802/zoi180323supp1_prod.pdf?Expires=2147483647&Key-Pair-Id=APKAIE5G5CRDK6RD3PGA&Signature=cYS67sAz9in9mn6OjM7wN5b8FgH4vsvV9MxZbTLnj53J~AiJKnT~wjtx8idpRPWvJKCluwC-1XAgWmEUbA-z1aNxrnioTG5OwHu1xwEPdid8Tn7wvSO6EtO8P24GrsXBgwOG2NsSRBHAdAF5foIPldn58kcnpSFnVYV~UQ7xLmjE3cLVPUuVouZXZxhAwiStRsjB6OTu98wSTVIgyY4Wgl4S3L8NziiZJMdof2JTn0T0FGzy7LlF6ZUGgSbgZIsfhY8gFPntThFzVsB-Oyb84eOo-pM9Ycn556GFOE77NSlxNPbvnUH~4Ot6PSa9wA9ZdKotPAFNXf~PA98Ls-5JSw__","https://respiratoryacademy.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/PCRA-Journal-Club-February-2019.pdf"],"title":"Association of Electronic Cigarette Use With Subsequent Initiation of Tobacco Cigarettes in US Youths","doi":"10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2018.7794","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2018.7794","venue":"JAMA network open"}

AF episodes were induced with burst pacing and aconitine in each dog. For each model, AF was induced from the RA in six dogs and from the LA in six dogs. Dominant frequencies (DFs) were obtained using the fast Fourier transform of the unipolar recordings obtained from each electrode of the array. Standard deviation (SD) was used to compute the frequency dispersion within an atrium. Regularity of the signal was quantified using an organization index (OI).\n\n\nRESULTS\nDFs were largest in the atrium where aconitine was applied. Aconitine AF had larger gradients than burst-pacing AF (5.0 +/- 4.5 vs. 0.9 +/- 1.0 Hz: P <.006). Aconitine AF when compared with burst-pacing AF had greater absolute LA-RA differences in the SD of DFs (2.3 +/- 1.9 vs. 0.2 +/- 0.2 Hz; P <.001) and in OI (0.11 +/- 0.07 vs. 0.06 +/- 0.07; P <.07).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nDifferences in frequency gradients and organization were observed during AF induced by burst pacing and aconitine.

We analyse the effect of the intersubband interaction and coupling of subband wavefunctions through the barrier on the intrasubband and intersubband transport scattering rates. We show that the intersubband interaction controls the roughness potential of different interfaces through the dielectric screening matrix. In the case of lowest subband occupancy, the mobility is mainly governed by the interface roughness of the central barrier. Whereas when two subbands are occupied, the interface roughness of the outer barrier predominates due to intersubband effects.

Volcanic dust is shown to have been an important cause of climate change, while the effects of sunspot-related solar constant variation and anthropogenic forcing are not evident.","inCitations":["71e85d1bb4e22e324782979b37257c639581cef3","ce8e392a97dbd25c7f20855547ec8be444416c4e","af5a3d585174d941033baa8687cfc158955dbd5f","56e784ad4492b5a6d4b0393e8bd4c9a1d036a988","52a0217db6c16a9e1b11d6499e24e272ed0f0e24","46d13755ba84ac7eeab67646c0281b35fe653a6a","b4aecae36888214b4fded7d02c9cd7ae72591622","da83f7ef9e834598ac3ef78ec3b35d33cf1efdfe","d307058edc1bc64e45d70d0638fe374c2229850c","42e6be140eb14b33a9eb9687e7d0e561312f71b9","da2f71d221fb83282330e38f08972b0dd69253dc","3b99004b9a7f896f93512bc152c253d2e4785e8c","a286a56f2027a492cceec067c926bab7c207b9cc","1839687ea3105450c490862050a4754bc9cd7547","eb7e2b471b4380ceb4d50c6b0a5e9b125cdd019d","7e63627f733b706902f5182b7181e3b86ef60c8d","d06c168fcaf9c1ee06be07a9fbaafec9861530d2","3ef52054067e8e93706a2cc1034a227d9da8e3d7","71314588946f4db3b60e04b40b6a866379f44bd2","5e4d009730719a9ab46fb5927d39be05174a51e2","79c6e2985ba076eb5442cdc71afa7e879dd36584"],"pdfUrls":["http://climate.envsci.rutgers.edu/pdf/RobockInternalExternalJAS1978.pdf"],"title":"Internally and Externally Caused Climate Change","doi":"10.1175/1520-0469(1978)035<1111:IAECCC>2.0.CO;2","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1175/1520-0469%281978%29035%3C1111%3AIAECCC%3E2.0.CO%3B2","venue":""}

Larger femoral heads have had success in decreasing dislocation rates; however, there are concerns regarding the subsequent use of thinner polyethylene liners, and their effects on wear rates. Historically, high stresses on thin polyethylene bearings have caused concerns, including rim cracking and catastrophic implant failure with polyethylene thicknesses less than 5 millimeters. Recently, sequentially cross-linked and annealed polyethylene has been shown to reduce the wear rate significantly, compared to conventional ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) in vitro. The purpose of this study was to analyze the clinical and radiographic outcomes in a cohort of patients treated with sequentially cross-linked and annealed polyethylene bearings with a nominal thickness of 3.8 millimeters. Outcomes were compared to a similar cohort of patients who were treated with total hip arthroplasty during the same time period and utilizing the same polyethylene thickness of 5.8 millimeters or greater.\n\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nWe identified 50 patients (53 hips) who had a minimum 2-year clinical and radiographic follow-up after a standard total hip arthroplasty, performed with a thin, sequentially cross-linked and annealed polyethylene bearing surface. There were 15 males and 35 females, with a a mean age of 60 years (range, 16 to 93 years) and a mean body mass index of 28.6 kg/m² (range, 17.2 to 47.5 kg/m²). Overall survivorship was compared to a cohort of 50 patients (53 hips) treated with total hip arthroplasty during the same time period, utilizing the same polyethylene of 5.8 millimeters or greater thickness. Radiographic analysis of polyethylene wear was performed on a subset of 26 hips, using a previously validated two-dimensional computer-aided technique. Volumetric wear was calculated and subsequent annual volumetric and linear wear rates were derived for each patient in the study cohort. Additionally, radiographic analysis was performed to assess for any progressive radio-lucencies or malalignment.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe overall survivorship of the study cohort was 100%, compared to a 96% survivorship in the comparison group (two failures due to infection). The mean Harris hip scores in the thin polyethylene cohort improved from 43 points (range, 10 to 67 points) pre-operatively to 91 points (range, 69 to 100 points) postoperatively. Upon radiographic review, no malalignment, radiolucencies, or polyethylene fracture was noted in the study cohort. The mean volumetric wear rate was 0.4122 mm³/year (range, 0.2311 to 0.7310 mm³/year), and the mean linear wear rate was 0.0004 mm/year (range, 0.0002 to 0.0007 mm/year) for the thin polyethylene group. The mean volumetric wear was 0.8839 mm³ (range, 0.4621 to 1.5839 mm³) for this cohort. Excellent clinical and radiographic outcomes were found for patients treated with thin, sequentially cross-linked and annealed polyethylene bearings utilized in total hip arthroplasty, with a nominal thickness of 3.8 millimeters. We have not seen any failures with thin polyethylene liners that have undergone this manufacturing process, which is in contradistinction to results of previously reported thin polyethylene liners. Wear rates were lower than other bearing surfaces at similar periods.","inCitations":["7d956f37bbeba52937c0f3221825ab0e1832420f","ec96f37a968f47141137cd36b7369b0c7854d908","d088a68584c476c3cbff0586a237a93cb565acdb","40cdc842d2cb8648cdf2c4b12fd565982c251482","daa26ebb4c69f902e15c6ed3b0551665731ad4be","4a452f01e82368c8fec97030ece46005760112d6","a5c7788557277357d5d34c65ece212d26f2f1868","8f7bcb179361bbd522acab9fc1635544066fc542","aab891552f1f3b517ecad4476b6fd372420da881","79a1ceb4e0971dd4152f87440e15644fd39cc44a","46340fb20597e1e43b3f9fbf84518091050bfafd","ae128f3c3967fcf2c5d21808c564f46883d323d8","fd47400afb458aeb22702e85d266f64469036265","ce5f8ce48035aa21afbebce0d3f37b907df80a75","bde98dae7d12cbd069a601fb5f7da87ae0b7b344","88c64801ecba67f7e574a2732ab6a56a9e9028f5","35be13cbfd5f61da87651ea4666cf567cf6a3ce7","1b3d7cc620556211cc838a83aeacde6e007ecb02"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.southtexasbone.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Early-Outcomes-of-sequentially-cross-linked-polyethylene-liners-with-large-diameter-femoral-heads-in-total-hip-arthroplasty.pdf"],"title":"Early outcomes of sequentially cross-linked thin polyethylene liners with large diameter femoral heads in total hip arthroplasty.","doi":"","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"Bulletin of the NYU hospital for joint diseases"}

Love poems are a literary genre of Phoenician origin, arising from the marzeaḥ , the sacred banquet which probably commemorated a dead god. Attested at least from the 14th cent. BC, love poems were introduced from Phoenicia into Mesopotamia during the Cassite period (14th-13th cent. BC) and into Ramessid Egypt (13th cent. BC). After 1200 BC, love poetry survived only in Phoenicia. The Song of Songs , written in Mishnaic Hebrew, cannot be dated prior to the 2nd cent. BC; it shows affinities with Egyptian love lyrics but we do not know anything of the link. The Song of Songs further gives a theological solution to the problem of the god traditionally conquered by death: on the basis of Platonic philosophy, it makes of Love a god stronger than Death.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://sefarad.revistas.csic.es/index.php/sefarad/article/download/861/1035"],"title":"Il Cantico dei cantici nel quadro della poesia dell´antico Oriente","doi":"10.3989/sefarad.1997.v57.i1.861","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.3989/sefarad.1997.v57.i1.861","venue":""}

We aimed to determine changes in medicine use as a result of the program.MethodsThe program provides targeted patient-specific feedback to medical practitioners. The feedback is supported with educational material developed by a clinical panel, subject to peer review and overseen by a national editorial committee. Veterans who meet target criteria also receive educational brochures. The program is supported by a national call centre and ongoing national consultation. Segmented regression analyses (interrupted time series) were undertaken to assess changes in medication use in targeted veterans pre and post each intervention.Results12 interventions were included; three to increase medicine use, seven which aimed to reduce use, and two which had combination of messages to change use. All programs that aimed to increase medicine use were effective, with relative effect sizes at the time of the intervention ranging from 1% to 8%. Mixed results were seen with programs aiming to reduce inappropriate medicine use. Highly specific programs were effective, with relative effect sizes at the time of the intervention of 10% decline in use of NSAIDs in high risk groups and 14% decline in use of antipsychotics in dementia. Interventions targeting combinations of medicines, including medicine interactions and potentially inappropriate medicines in the elderly did not change practice significantly. Interventions with combinations of messages targeting multiple components of practice had an impact on one component, but not all components targeted.ConclusionsThe Veterans’ MATES program showed positive practice change over time, with interventions increasing use of appropriate medicines where under-use was evident and reduced use of inappropriate medicines when single medicines were targeted. Combinations of messages were less effective, suggesting specific messages focusing on single medicines are required to maximise effect. The program provides a model that could be replicated in other settings.","inCitations":["cee063064af9c6c1a6fedd93f4f704379c3159c9","0b40c8ec97f4473e29946a9a5044f1754e4bb6f4","0a34b947e2225a8d6662e6a0be7b8fb3ed444790","eee43e975294c6b59f55e9e0a4db80edac504feb","81a81d17d05d4dac785d0839f2ab2d7d0a3dd6df","39921705780fad577ed0475fadc84665fe36fdeb","0a430ca95bfe8028bdfc01c3f0727713be15450d","5db96733f2a39a11becdd42cc9136b0cffb499ec","2d82b6d6a4516f12e250bb147fb00258b70e535b","328ca78fed19ab38f6c84482b5e759ee79cf4d90","3e51f5b34af325a50f9273c6c827fe8cd73eda00","5cd6b571d0294b9fde14fb9557d57a81921d8631","f9819def9c0f42b95fa18c369c25aa99311d80e3","6c3da70953dc02e3aa9666c2421a201deba3afd4","514f56269c4cbb05d7a10cbbd37ec1b8cd79d1d4"],"pdfUrls":["http://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/pmc/da/47/1472-6963-13-514.PMC3878826.pdf","http://download-redirector.springer.com/redirect?contentType=pdf&ddsId=art:10.1186/1472-6963-13-514&originUrl=http://bmchealthservres.biomedcentral.com/article/10.1186/1472-6963-13-514"],"title":"Bridging evidence-practice gaps: improving use of medicines in elderly Australian veterans","doi":"10.1186/1472-6963-13-514","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1472-6963-13-514","venue":"BMC Health Services Research"}

To better understand the forms of empathy experienced by people observing animal-computer interaction, we designed and studied an interactive installation for orangutans at a zoo. Through collaborative design we established an understanding of zoos' objectives and strategies related to empathy in the zoo context. We deployed a prototype installation, and observed and interviewed visitors who watched orangutans use the installation. Analysis of observations and interviews revealed that visitors responded with cognitive, affective and motor empathy for the animals. We propose that these empathetic responses are prompted by the visibility of orangutans' bodily movements, by the \"anthropic frame\" provided by digital technology, and by prompting reflection on animals' cognitive processes and affective states. This paper contributes new evidence and understanding of people's empathetic responses to observing animal-computer interaction and confirms the value of designing for empathy in its various forms","inCitations":["ce1a1c31169307dd84c9903307cd0f46aa136ecb","6ed2e8f3ac7a9914da568aa0358b808ca26842ae","63f0acee22bb80174574ba47e9ae3ed3423d03b2","9bbabb7ea3ee36a739a2360cbffd66ab7009a676","049a6d42690e9701814b7ea1db554fb8f05f2b19","67413398b4dccc17ff321d7e0ec6155faad8036c","bf5214de5a1460e01eccffb74c60a57b43cf099e","f64279ceb5af05bbd93a17f657f2a092b8e6fad3","445664875a80a6d848f90fbafc66099c8cde0ddf","b4bcd14854c91e089912fb33bbe552c9974983c0","37e6616cfce9dad8948eb25ed8e329f4790d2d15","1d00069813dfde3122f414721d1d33a7b215bcd9","97352a28513657997171aeb94a03402514201168","9e6c1c580fa9ce93f1b9d5196802717108203c5f","2a904d1c61f7dc91588b9a3238a6f422328fa2e5","a8511e42a0bcd6b76ecdebf52358b30fd854067f","ced03c01add114dd8fd60df344f415272b7362ad","fb1d9f6b72d02814007d00878374830e90a97dda","808effb799bdd2010ad6a561c74bfcb0e9adec0e","2d8f9b7866bd8063e1e2335b3595b9bf141a2aec"],"pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/3025453.3025729"],"title":"Kinecting with Orangutans: Zoo Visitors' Empathetic Responses to Animals?

The HFRC was tested for slump, compressive strength, flexural strength and impact resistance. The test result demonstrated that mixture of such hybrid fibers improve compressive strength, flexural strength and impact resistance of concrete. Moreover, it was found that HFRCs to which hydrophilic fibers, i.e. PVA/MSF and JUTE/MSF, were mixed show more improved features that HFRC to which non-hydrophilic fiber, i.e. PP/MSF was mixed. Meanwhile, the finding that PVA/MSF HFRC exhibited better performance than JUTE/MSF HFRC was attributed from the former having higher aspect ratio than that of the latter.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Mechanical Properties and Impact Resistance of Hybrid Fiber Reinforced Concrete with Type of Reinforcing Fibers for Precast Concrete","doi":"10.5389/KSAE.2013.55.4.029","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.5389/KSAE.2013.55.4.029","venue":""}

All patients underwent staged SNS placement with the InterStim device for treatment of refractory voiding dysfunction. The patients were followed up for evidence of AEs and device efficacy. The patient and device variables were examined statistically for evidence of predictive value.\n\n\nRESULTS\nFrom September 2001 to March 2008, 221 patients with a mean age of 48.8 years underwent SNS lead placement for the treatment of intractable urinary urgency/frequency (n = 121), urge incontinence (n = 63), or urinary retention (n = 37). Of this group, 202 patients (91.4%) experienced a >50% improvement in symptoms and underwent implantable pulse generator placement. At a mean follow-up of 36.9 months, 67 patients (30.3%) had experienced AEs (pain in 6, elective removal in 10, lack of efficacy in 11, trauma in 18, infection in 7, hematoma in 3, and lead migration in 12) requiring 44 lead revisions and 47 implantable pulse generator revisions. The significant predictors of AEs included a history of trauma (P < .001), a change in body mass index class (P < .001), enrollment in a pain clinic (P = .008), the duration of follow-up (P = .002), and a history of AEs (P < .001).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe results of our study have shown that SNS is an effective treatment for patients with intractable voiding dysfunction. Complications are not uncommon but can be minimized with better patient selection.","inCitations":["125157298645e06fb91e0aa23d8d7bc7ecf40158","33598f20f4bc2ea9ffba342ccb772baabafeaded","573477b2ba7c12cc82cf8808819a3c780634fedf","d5edca306c55e4db2d70fea66f4050006aa14bdd","436e0da5929285c16e18c4dbf906b7e64e5b2d01","036b92b117113637da5f4f6faf92cfa1645acadf","aa864fcc576db2cb7ca8aa2bd3c9c614fe8d8703","01fc6def6526cfb84a55f6184c54232da5e5f04a","09fd8bd05638d183483e232c4b9a33b571cfe6f8","aa064d01f1308a473f9abd3648982fef25d750ef","82cd54ee9233821df17f8454ed032469038ea609","0b1639d636519f20692585ae55790abcbd4af615","3532f9e99d9b2cc35a7b34381befea3b5976f31e","8a8e77e16016f87147de24ab49b9e61df3d2d617","c0f589006e19ce71124d051b9fad4836e6638fb6","e8a60b1823dbf5f55d40b49b6693f386d575e594","db5aed09abd867eece07f064e872dda7dd53f0a0","3926feed8e0e4441875b6a8bbcd19549b66bbc2e","471a58f80300b93546e1f56a2d45014e4ffbe06e","09dcf972febe5c2926bff2ac4f532ba49079711a","9f298d59c26aee3308b1bb51cd2a2fe8eec51b73","712ccaf635357eb9d48f782d3b1e5fbd5d426875","fcf09e9994ab0174d5166f2e820d35d9c1d27d7f","c95a14ea9ab6a8b078eb000821a4743becdad032","ebf9dedfbb5ca5457d6e222589d9d6941b7bfe4f","3b3f4258d7f0314dc389732769a88d0af6333188","1d39b5809053efde3e51f369ab7414316dd77821","5e255f31fa0d4a00a537122e700ade6192ef803b","4878c70fc0b9b9e69fd4abe076c90ba5f22d11e7","bc571227b4846a4dd3da760537a01f7142d1dbf5","f8beeec0c3c01159e16b221e3e0629e4410b9914","149fed9723caeb53cc347f165d43e6d57fa9c3a6","6671cc7121b509a3bedb7b2b9b7c12f999c5aa13","67c0a22f611694c8d06552ae697215b87ce36e31","69f8577ceee12f4b6573e37192e6131f14eeac8f","2d1469036a4741cfcdf5fab81cb6edd7886a24fc","3cea79ca300866a646d31c35f279eb66e44d4eb6","3827311bcf6f6ae205d69e3e707995c569727991","483029f9d5cf2787b61eda9d3f0492fbbf2a53b0","ca03f0f123b936d7362a909bb8a6e6262246cfac","9030284531b2cc710acaf1acaf9b97ad29eee536"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Incidence and predictors of complications with sacral neuromodulation.","doi":"10.1016/j.urology.2008.11.047","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.urology.2008.11.047","venue":"Urology"}

This column briefly covers the primary changes and summarises the debate about various diagnoses, with a particular focus on diagnoses of relevance to medico-legal psychiatry and the legal system. Underlying concerns about the validity of diagnostic criteria and their applicability to forensic issues are discussed. Concerns about the DSM-5 are not only due to the specific diagnoses and their criteria, but the methodology of checklist criteria. This is amplified in medico-legal settings, but is also in part necessary. Clinicians, lawyers, and judges will all need to think carefully about how they use the DSM and its ilk in forensic settings.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Disorders, sublime menu: the DSM-5.","doi":"","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"Journal of law and medicine"}

Granular activated carbons made from pelletized poultry litter have been shown to adsorb various positively charged metal ions from laboratory-prepared solutions. The objective of this study was to develop a conceptual capital and operating cost estimate using the Superpro Designer process simulation program. In the study, it was assumed that the activated carbon manufacturing facility obtains the poultry litter from various farmers at a cost of $5.50 and $27.50 t−1 for transportation. The carbon manufacturing facility processes 20 t of poultry litter per day and converts it into granular activated carbon for a final carbon yield of 21.6% (dry basis). This facility operates continuously, 330 days of the year. Several parameters were incorporated in the study including equipment sizing, capital costs and operating costs, such as labor, utilities, maintenance and equipment depreciation. The largest contributor to the cost of producing the activated carbon is the $1,200,000 equipment cost of the combined pyrolysis/activation furnace, which contributes about $0.47 kg−1 to the production cost. This study indicates that activated carbon can be produced by this method at a cost of about $1.44 kg−1.","inCitations":["55a54298ced11c2c627c350d3a67bf4059a79564","0c6fd2b67a65af0d0d3ef16146e62eeeb2e8f577","f389c3e8b9f3663f4876afbeff5b36f7dd008df7","6438b019d94483dd73bb8a3ef3e9b3deba618d93","8267cd99fa80d923a4e1f500a6de417db8961f8d","fdacf67014458c76dc1e35aba64c55ba711bf2be","1d45fa409b07f107b421c7a50808cc507ed5f401","8823402684cc24465647742438df6fe4997a1aa4","fa40dcd17778c8fc0eadf0aee708f33106ecc024","37cce687ab59fdaf59fc35ac343d4cd2507f17cd","5ef56a4ef464ba31390b6027baf6d953cd4aab3e","82daa0611db0d6a3029834728c5bc8256a2770ad","19a2cdf44142dbf7ec1a4e5f825f581c1aaad129","505a96647ae08cda794aad2857ebc4bf6f0e17ab","31f941175429ac463ae0facd55377c5ecb750ae2","233cf6471c63f8275caec3be16117957e6380c9b","b5cecd9c590e339c6135d0f83441bf5fd049d2ed","c8e453dd4aeab03a14030825f0961b7da504f48c","0fba582ce417aaf9f6d24a0cdc865fe3c8e32d48","6531b1abd251781d41363d42be838c55e3ca8c9b","0d1bd88c5349a28fd2f7b0d622044858a65ab1a7","c487e2fa7cb6573d0744fd1cbedcef683ab69541","9bfd1ba278035c82a45f600cec90308e4ceaa78b","2adfac5b0238e6cc82efa5d09d1c64340082f7c7","ee45db2a24e5d9d824d470c84ebe5a81dc41e985","ae94afa99f76ba44f2de6c62068e8c85fc241152","5a369f0ea1c5ce7f40e97b2601682c93ab9cea15","8ced68baa34239e8d857b9d24a9de3334d6fc59d","2fbe9e56ccf9a951e67be54fb3204312ed57653b"],"pdfUrls":["https://naldc.nal.usda.gov/download/16296/PDF"],"title":"Activated carbon from broiler litter : Process description and cost of production","doi":"10.1016/j.biombioe.2007.11.008","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biombioe.2007.11.008","venue":""}

We have first investigated O-GlcNAc level and Hsp70-GlcNAc-binding activity (HGBA) behaviour after exposure of HeLa and HepG(2) cells to a wide variety of stresses. O-GlcNAc and HGBA responses were different according to the stress and according to the cell. HGBA was released for almost all stresses, while O-GlcNAc level was modified either upwards or downwards, depending to the stress. Against all expectations, we demonstrated that energy charge did not significantly vary with stress whereas UDP-GlcNAc pools were more dramatically affected even if differences in UDP-GlcNAc contents were not correlated with O-GlcNAc variations suggesting that O-GlcNAc transferase is itself finely regulated during cell injury. Finally, HGBA could be triggered by proteasome inhibition and by L-azetidine-2-carboxylic acid (a proline analogue) incorporation demonstrating that protein misfolding is one of the key-activator of this Hsp70 property.","inCitations":["472043f588721d43f425d2aa5d6016b9e30e3f5f","690ead6542c74693e16a476de704be46a6827007","1d8ba127da04afa438621d82f52086dfe3f36053","59f844dde6312ca56946e85bf084173412965b81","14aa68a6e9fdf81fe6b9e24982b1d896ec0ce762","a417fff6e346b623d7cb87dca8b0a2d5eb6f68a9","de8d7b003abebe6b0184d82f173cdc9fd8649ea8","8bd45dbdd913b250d742d38a213a31a0f685ece6","ea8d96edd2521fc2eb931d8bdbb274cf0b13d7c3","8179499ef458d5eb1654c2608375d78133500a33","55a7dee5078a1dc5f49c2e0c04d76bf780796e24","ccd7abc4ccff21ef4c0de4c3847bd97a42db59bc","946828ab887b8bb81f901e4c55d1868ad4e51218","8c6470bdca1ec1803f3bd5cef8b8c287a1483ce3","6f16cdcfdfc5d7fbbc0cc0f69547b44b6ad2c4fd","92609c1f6149d2283eb64c91c15ee550656f6e84","2a35a6bee0a7d64da17f608d0a7b4190bd7c2d9a","f30ad542fb76d4e226130b9b5b45b0013e8c3938","e483ef9c4c634fc191348fc7170732895b30bcb8","cb527101bef197742c2f96e1d9f077af999b4cc2","b3a5044bbe1ed4980b105492cc9da1b2e2fbb2c0"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Hsp70-GlcNAc-binding activity is released by stress, proteasome inhibition, and protein misfolding.","doi":"10.1016/j.bbrc.2007.07.020","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2007.07.020","venue":"Biochemical and biophysical research communications"}

Studies all showed the potential role of HBx to promote HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC); however, the role of HBx play in the pathogenesis of HCC is still enigma. Some reports suggested there is a threshold level of HBx in HCC development. The rapid degradation of HBx by the proteasome pathway, which is one character of HBx protein, will lead to the low concentration of HBx. By the way, there are also inconsistent data in both in vitro result and HBx transgenic mouse in vivo models. Conditional expression system (Tetracycline (Tet)-inducible) is adopted to highly and specifically express HBx in the liver of zebrafish, here, we try to reveal the role of HBx in liver pathology and also reflect to the high level of HBx in the clinical case. We established a liver disease model by using zebrafish and explained the possible mechanism of HBx involved in pathogenesis of HCC, from the hepatocyte apoptosis to the liver disease progression. For performance of the Tet-inducible system in vivo, we first tested the toxicity of doxycycline (Dox) in zebrafish and 100μg/ml is highest dosage for induction without severe toxicity. Later, 30μg/ml is chosen as the default concentration for the induction assay and the inducible expression pattern is successfully and efficiently achieved in our in vivo model. In the liver pathology, human liver disease progression, as inflammation, fibrosis and HCC phenotype, can also be observed in the transgenic zebrafish by using H&E staining. By the induction of TGF-β expression in the liver, we hypothesis the apoptotic capacity of HBx may play an important role in the HBV- related liver disease progression.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"肝臟專一性表現 HBx 促進斑馬魚模式生物肝癌的形成","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}
