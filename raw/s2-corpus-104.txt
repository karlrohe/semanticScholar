Drawing on the work of Bruno Latour, I argue how they could be tied together in order to provide an enriched understanding of climate denial: rather than being a cause of dysfunctional climate politics, it constitutes a symptomatic outburst of the political in a completely depoliticised landscape. Moreover, this diagnosis points to what I believe is a fundamental flaw in the science-policy architecture of climate change: in attempting to translate the universal validity of science into the contours of an inclusive, consensual negotiation model, the constitutive role of exclusion in the emergence of scientific objectivity is overlooked. This eventually allows me to argue that the issue of climate change, rather than being a problem of translating scientific matters of fact into political matters of concern, constitutes first and foremost a political struggle over what to be concerned about.","inCitations":["92a4d853f06fb7506effab02084199eddf464e61","23efe5f08ccbee837845f3b1a29c4b96a1fbfb66","1ad4e3f7c105f02ff2a4b9f56e00de3026856251","68b90a68f8f708b4e06a8e86141ba90e6fca694f","2998d0d561a1c79f83427a4cb77b9432c0ea7651","b736e365f9b7ef63718acb970d294d0b85461991"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Does the Climate Need Consensus?: The Politics of Climate Change Revisited","doi":"10.5250/symploke.21.1-2.0147","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.5250/symploke.21.1-2.0147","venue":""}

Although\nthere is strong evidence for the existence of surface bound nanobubbles,\nthe possibility of stable nanobubbles in the bulk remains in question.\nIn this work, we show how ultrasonication of electrolytes can create\ntransient bulk nanobubbles. To do this, glass nanopores are used as\nCoulter counters to detect nanobubbles. During ultrasonication, these\ntransient bulk nanobubbles are shown to exist in relatively high concentrations\nwhile bubble activity on the surface of a solid media close to the\npore is driven by ultrasound. However, the transient nature of these\nbubbles is evident upon termination of the ultrasonic source. High-speed\nimaging suggests that these transient nanobubbles originate from the\nfragmentation of larger bubbles,\nwhich skate over the surface of the structure in the acoustic field\npresent. Transient nanobubbles as small as ∼100 nm in radius\nare detected. In contrast to previous work with microbubbles, no evidence\nfor the oscillation of these nanobubbles during translocation was\nfound. The novel experimental approach presented here provides strong\nevidence for the existence of transient nanobubbles in bulk solution.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/pstorage-acs-6854636/22052037/jp0c00435_si_001.pdf"],"title":"Generation and In Situ Electrochemical Detection of Transient Nanobubbles","doi":"10.1021/acs.jpcc.0c00435","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.0c00435","venue":""}

In addition, we wanted to investigate the difference between interpersonal and noninterpersonal traumatic events, the impact of ACCs, and the cumulative effects of these events on self-reported symptoms of dissociation, depression, and anxiety. Adolescents from the normative population (n = 188) answered the questionnaire LYLES and also the Dissociation-Questionnaire-Sweden and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. The results showed that LYLES was stable, with test-retest r = 0.79 and kappa item per item ranging between k = 0.44 and 1.0. ACCs contributed independently to the explanation of symptoms explaining them better than potentially traumatic events alone, particularly for boys where the impact of ACCs exceeded the impact of events. The conclusions are that LYLES displayed satisfactory psychometric properties and that ACCs seem to be a valuable addition to an instrument to evaluate potentially traumatic events.","inCitations":["c5d9d4f9f996d9e1d0993e745dfe33e759bcf711","55b5366e1e18e0ae75e73c929fae4ae436d98a70","b9d821501d36cce961e716fd0bc30ae96662ac58","e58222825771d3b890500b02b6162a0dc38d4d2c","98695828a5f37d05fd91459325ac53b9123db6a5","0ef5ac060d1fb106e44d5ba43200dae91e129e0f","e076dfc3531a9983005329d7d79d77cdbbe4cb11","2b49ab8fb593e4ede380a3810274b770bec4633f","464543f497af32aea4ea5fafb1c8223ce919ef70","c87a8be9a6fcc84afe86f021da7304d455649ef5","bde39218be528910f5a24a05d601b7439844a1f5","bcbc261be1d8acf1ca173a215fb209a3c105937b","c987472d4beeeccadfbef56e4136d1ef6d885927"],"pdfUrls":["http://liu.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:355570/FULLTEXT01.pdf","http://liu.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:355570/FULLTEXT01"],"title":"Evaluation of the linköping youth life experience scale.","doi":"10.1097/NMD.0b013e3181f4acb6","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1097/NMD.0b013e3181f4acb6","venue":"The Journal of nervous and mental disease"}

In this paper, a novel combined conditioning method was proposed to enhance the sludge dewaterability. The sludge was firstly disintegrated by NaCl, then the sludge particles were re-flocculated by cationic polyacrylamide (CPAM), meanwhile the sludge filter cake was modified with rice husk (RH) as filter aid. The results showed that combined NaCl-CPAM-RH conditioning greatly improved the sludge dewaterability compared with that of raw sludge. The optimal NaCl pretreatment lasted 120 min with a dosage of 0.25 mol/L, the optimal CPAM and RH dosage was 30 mg/L and 50 wt%, respectively, which led to a moisture content of sludge cake of 65.44%. The changes of sludge liquid and solid phase conditioned by NaCl-CPAM-RH were analyzed. The NaCl pretreatment disintegrated the sludge floc structure with the release of protein and polysaccharide from EPS and Ca 2+ and Mg 2+ from sludge flocs to liquid, accompanying with the release of water trapped in sludge matrix. The addition of CPAM and RH reconstructed the sludge flocs with a big mean diameter d(0.5) of 126.84 μm, and the sludge filter cake showed a porous and rigid structure with a porosity increment of 138.62% and a compressibility reduction of 39.62% compared to that of raw sludge.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Combined sludge conditioning with NaCl-cationic polyacrylamide-rice husk powders to improve sludge dewaterability","doi":"10.1016/j.powtec.2018.05.042","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.powtec.2018.05.042","venue":""}

Because the dynamics that influenced this development are still effective, a review of what happened in the first century of the history of Christianity can be instructive for the church in our own time.1 Though the threefold categorization of ministry types is convenient and defensible, it must be conceded at the outset that the distinction is not always a sharp one and that the same person could be the bearer of more than one type of ministry and thus come under more than one category. It should also be noted that development was not uniform and proceeded at different rates in different localities. The three types, listed in order of appearance, can be denominated (1) charismatic, (2) familial, and (3) appointive. I am using the term “charismatic” not with the modern connotation, but in the original sense based on Romans 12 and 1 Corinthians 12. The main distinction between the three types upon which I am focusing is the mode of reception and basis of authority. Charismatic leaders received a direct divine call. Familial leaders were blood relatives of Jesus. Appointive leaders were elected in some fashion by the church.","inCitations":["c4ddc5c4ebc0fac4801fe43e38cd79018a305fa0","7d69d9a256fe4ae2dc8491def4e4a09cbe14ae86","1562640cfb65591668bb1d91cc2626467f1ebc4c","0e068abd5d52fbee13a4798ff54e84adc7a771b9"],"pdfUrls":["https://digitalcommons.andrews.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?amp%3Bcontext=jats&article=1171&httpsredir=1&referer=","https://www.andrews.edu/library/car/cardigital/Periodicals/Journal_of_the_Adventist_Theological_Society/2006/2006_02.pdf","http://www.atsjats.org/publication_file.php?journal=1&pub_id=315&type=doc"],"title":"Leadership in the Early Church During Its First Hundred Years","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

To conduct the evaluation, we have used the conditional difference-in-difference method and mobilized business data covering a relatively long period (2006–2012) to provide a better evaluation of the policy's effects over time. Our estimates indicate that belonging to a cluster creates a significant leverage effect rather than a crowding-out effect: compared with firms outside clusters, firms inside clusters receive more R&D subsidies and invest even more in R&D. However, the leverage effect is not immediate since it appears four years after the launch of the cluster policy and is mainly driven by small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Thus, the policy should be i) pursued over time to produce tangible results and ii) relevant not only for SMEs but also for intermediate-sized firms and large firms, which can constitute the core of collaborative projects initiated within the framework of the cluster policy.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"R&D crowding out or R&D leverage effects: An evaluation of the french cluster-oriented technology policy","doi":"10.1016/j.techfore.2020.120025","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.techfore.2020.120025","venue":""}

Owing to the poor outcomes following liver transplantation with recurrent HCV infection, liver transplantation using HCV seropositive donors (non-viremic and viremic) had been restricted. However, as a result of the growing supply of HCV seropositive donors from the recent opioid epidemic along with the advent of efficacious DAA therapy to treat HCV recurrence, there has been an increasing trend to use HCV seropositive donors for both HCV seropositive and seronegative recipients.

Larval bluegill, channel catfish, carp, largemouth bass, and smallmouth bass and juvenile bluegill and mosquitofish were exposed to different combinations of pump speed and water temperatures in the PPS. Wide differences among species in their sensitivity to pipe and condenser passage were observed. For most of the species tested, short-term conditional mortalities resulting from the physical stresses of pipe and condenser passage increased with ..delta..T and/or pumping rate. Pump passage was not a major source of physical damage, and no clear relationship was found between pump efficiency and mortality. Susceptibility to physical stresses associated with entrainment was inversely related to the size of the entrained organisms. Delayed mortality frequently occurred among fishes exposed to stresses in the PPS. However, delayed mortality estimates in these experimental groups were significantly greater than corresponding values in handling control groups in only 15 of 64 comparisons. Like short-term mortalities, relatively higher delayed mortalities were often observed for the smaller species tested.","inCitations":["c048f273210b167d9c5118e2abf70bc16fc7da97","b17e5dad1a67d2cc409bbaef80106d2e2ecbf062","e4d8f5cd08f65d9b107a630fc25eb447d4e79d25","d283b974d2e7f1c114dd5635a19805206c3a4e8e","c16f112dfe2d25de4f3fa0e6d698fd0130f8713f"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Investigations of entrainment mortality among larval and juvenile fishes using a Power Plant Simulator","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

The RCM-κ does form concentration-dependent micelles. Also, β-CN phosphorylation level influences micelle formation. Complexes were low-temperature reversible and RCM-κ fibrils were seen.

Although some exercises can exacerbate its symptoms, swimming is considered a safe form of exercise based on the assumption that the humid environment is protective against exercise-induced bronchospasm. 2 Unfortunately, conflicting reports emerging over the last two decades on the effects of swimming have created a cloud of confusion among parents and doctors. This article aims to provide health professionals with an up-to-date knowledge on this matter. Early studies reported that asthmatic children who participated in a 6-8 week swimming program have better aerobic capacity and asthma control. 3,4 It is also noted that in children with mild persistent asthma, indoor swimming sessions (without chlorination) had a positive effects on lung function and bronchial hyper reactivity (BHR) was significantly decreased. 5 Over the last decade however, several reports have reported the detrimental effect of prolonged chlorine exposure as well as the observation that children attending indoor chlorinated swimming pools has increased risk of developing asthma. ’’ Long term attendance at indoor chlorinated swimming pools in children up to the age of 7 years is a major factor in the rise of asthma in the developed countries......’’ Early study in a cohort of swimmers reported an increased incidence of exercise-induced asthma. It is suggested that volatile compounds from pool chlorination acted as possible irritant agents. Studies also reported an elevated level of neutrophils and eosinophils count along with increased bronchial hyper-responsiveness. This increased bronchial responsiveness however, became attenuated and disappeared after discontinuing their intensive training. One group of researchers has conducted several studies to assess the acute and chronic effects of indoor swimming, Serum levels of surfactant associated proteins A and B (markers of lung hyper-permeability and cell injury) were measured in a subset of healthy children (before & after a swimming session) as well as in 226 healthy children who have been attending an indoor swimming pool since the age of 6 years old. Serum concentrations were found significantly increased not only after a swimming session but also after 1 hour pool exposure prior to swimming. A positive dose-effect relationship was also seen between serum SP-A & SP-B and cumulated pool attendance. 6 Goodman et al conducted a meta-analysis on 25 relevant studies performed over the last four decades. From six epidemiological studies looking at the association between swimming and asthma in childhood, none of the individual point estimates demonstrated a significant increase in asthma prevalence among those participated in swimming activities. They found no consistent association between asthma prevalence and the use of swimming pool in childhood. 7 Recently, the first prospective longitudinal study to examine whether swimming in infancy and childhood was associated with asthma and allergic symptoms was published. More than 5,700 British children were followed up to the age of 10 years. After adjusting the effect of confounders, swimming was found not to be associated with ever asthma, its frequency did not increase the risk of having asthma/ allergic symptoms and irrespective of their atopic status and the difference in cumulative pool attendance (CPA) had no effect on the risk of having asthma at 7 years of age. Surprisingly, in those with current asthma at 7 years of age, swimming was associated with higher FVC and FEV1, suggesting its protective effect. 8 The significance of these results was recently debated. Proponents of regular swimming activities believe that its simple prospective design has provided the natural experimental environment and validated epidemiological tools were used to correct most significant confounders. Their findings have somehow challenged the idea of pool chlorine hypothesis. On the other hand, Bernard and his colleagues believe that early exposures to chlorinated pools may have exerted an adjuvant effect in sensitisation process itself. This theory is supported by their own data and those from previous observational study which demonstrated a lower prevalence of asthma and respiratory allergies in subjects who swam in swimming pool disinfected by copper-silver ionisation method. They also suggested two possible explanations for the negative association in this study. First, due to the differences in exposure-response relationship and the natural course of respiratory diseases, the association between swimming and asthma are more difficult to be identified in younger children. Second, the researchers have underestimated the cumulated pool attendance (CPA) for their study population. They argued that since the climate and socioeconomic status in United Kingdom are not so different from Belgium, there is no reason to believe that the rates of swimming pool attendance are lower given its popularity among its society. Numerous studies have attempted to associate chlorine exposure and the risk of either developing asthma or worsening itâs the control. Due to differences in study population and methods, results have been conflicting. It is important to note that individual response to chemicals and exercise may vary particularly in the presence of atopic co-morbidities. Hence, parents should be aware of these inherited differences and should be regularly reminded on simple measures such as a warm-up period as well as pre-treatment with bronchodilators which often reduces the risk of exacerbations. Sports athletes on the other hand, need to be aware of the Therapeutic Use Exemption (TUE) policy, established by the Irish Sports Council that allow athletes with valid medical reasons to continue to use medications that are often prohibited in sports. 9 Finally, a good advice to parents is that they should be encouraged to be pro-active to ensure that swimming pool facilities provided in school and in the community are safe, well ventilated, clean and not overly crowded. All of which if not monitored could lead to deterioration of their child’s health.

The transition thresholds are marked under the variation of the cavity aspect ratio Ar=W/H (1/8, 1/4, 1/2), the Rayleigh number Ra (104-5×107) and the Hartmann number Ha (0-150). The Lattice Boltzmann (LBM) approach is used to solve the governing equations. Horizontal temperature gradient is responsible of the convective motion and heat transfer. The changes in the convective flow patterns and temperature contours due to the effects of varying the controlling parameters and associated heat transfer are examined. It has been concluded that the flow is strongly unstable and presents multicellular structure at Pr=0.01 typical of liquid metal compared to Pr=0.1 cases. The same effect is observed by decreasing the cavity aspect ratio Ar. The Magnetic field magnitude necessary to control and stabilize the flow is the weaker for Pr=0.1. Increasing gradually the Rayleigh number Ra, the flow undergoes transition to steady state with fewer cells than at low Ra. the transition occurs at a threshold value showing weak growth rate in the Hacr compared to Ra variation. Increasing the Prandtl number to 0.1, the core flow structure is distorted due to the Lorentz forces which outweigh the buoyancy forces and a thermal stratification is clearly established. For high Hartman numbers and Rayleigh numbers, the stretching effects suppress the unsteady behaviour and results in steady state with extended unicellular pattern in the direction of Lorentz force.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://www.akademiabaru.com/doc/CFDLV11_N3_P55_71.pdf"],"title":"Transition Thresholds and Routes to Unsteadiness of Magneto-Convective Flows in Tall Cavities at Low-Prandtl-Number Fluids","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

meaning.","inCitations":["707e2d6df481e0c522cacaccdb094642c2a647ef","99a83b534fbf710a1797f02ab67129e6eb17f4b3","50d45ab12b84ba8a2e49ea0b75a9bd22d2a30f55","5cc780e95bea8b1127b7396ea93c4bbbcf8c22f6","42a30362eb0d2d7f70313c9c241ef324dae5d337","4ed5b385d3c56f021833651f5ccbd37f3bf57c85","1bb01bedc08c092b060b14df9900ae792f95e362","ad93b9f7b8631af97fdea62a755122184375233c","43b364a45e3c633a7370027d3340f2f05ad260f7","e0bfb9ef0cf9ad103557c3b3d36a4c99d07cf30e","e142b982f38041034137898725068d72e889fb72","7cb2edc7474fce5356cc80f3e979e90d76b77bd5","f0396315f7d67f90198f7318a1a2dbe79fc0c843","8b223357a7e5620b8b9eb835ff15a0583c570ae1","79c939e60d8d9fe9c239e428df03e2da0392b6ec","8a805b3895e9ccef20b3f809a9d0f87edc5fb006","51c89e06d3185fe520537da0ed1829256a950855","8c21b80df92609df408ddb0dbfbb16eda5c54977","66167bf855521f6deb2f02b38250b9113cf3190f","fc8c662d067b4cf65770e50555318c6b79141748","75b72f74958c3ac868571e79295b99f4f7f45b89","af02532724075d31b0f91741e273345ddada2830","e029a5e503b42fdf5065b206976a039250e622dc","c8e3ec752ceacc0eab133d6e4049c1d47e3dfcee","56458cc222c9ef7aa362b39bc0842249fddec1a0","b168563b7de37e29d633c2e2dbbd484c156200d5","a164f4614e3226bb1198fc8c40aea4ecd0ab2ffa","91282fd88d8b6e9ef23de67e817564739fc72a32","e756f9d85b0261942df811766df006ca1dc8056f","272d0bdd3ff186819a20b1fb627beb213e39e609","cd0fd67ca1b97f1816a8e2b7f4394448cc06ebd3","d67a849d1bdfe227c6864959fa9ee08a7636e253","b80361d579a37aedde9d78ad765108a1a250cdcf","30f62c757c300738d4134cb22f06841da751ca76","691a96be0b8194b846c607f037416e87ffd628a6","01f5013cae55811f6433c7df5a135f752f5914fc","1deaf3ba101220be2086d126d1b201005b3b57f0","07d38ed2e4c319b11e507f3dbf36f2e422dc4c0a","3e636bc760342689b411a054a210099e823f1875","7942bcd50f28c1cd338343f13245ce513ce44cac","12c7f105b7bef209be4b0c379a36d0eee6aa13f0","fcf00fb80fa6fb5b6cbf2b992abc6d599e011e02","73cab1de9f372b493797f14f79aa0ea6f4080cd6","97a92ac6e6061b96ac8ffca1800a969766f59b40","b00a62d0e50af3671a5b4158dc49c19035c44a50","42f0a18aa441ed17c509c4001223007692a252eb","484449555b57691c67a7c4666427e9d9b9ddc3d5","6752d0574ac5763a80af7ef1337febb8734c331a","8ad81110a65b90ae53812252e3b3ae062102a88e","6d35e5b225597f51e0b4f80ed42f87be471f76f8","a08ce8e7924abaf9072785bfb66b8bf0e703be08","8caaa0f875ba31aadd6ff337667a1e60212f3b77","45805d64338a73563f8ef67952211aaed2e999b0","7e56d73c2d74f6ceda1e697a60454ad9e5c47ed8","cd49fb48d7598f39ea34eec5451041ad8ab11b27","90ee529d8fe1a50c10d55ac75c0bb015ae70c38e","3d5417eca9c9fc2f871e88e9c8e1324e60862b15","f8c5908a262eadcd3eda141ec5ab33f186255618","b440dc0c979af58e89e23934c97f49f513cdae32","b21321a45f0842d3254ccfec39992002cec74f1d","bfa582d6eb0c07ad259ccdc800d19747c81094da","6a2b9d0b6f3ec95f081bcf727709d35b32150a65","5307136cbbd8695263c9dde8432894773402450c","e6f40b56df370753adec37089dac1bbd7e54d014","e3a7376248b4e93269a96ba9c2f836eb4a4e77eb","a931d4ad59794ecc179fc4973d68e2cd46616234","db5d10633f76a93d00f670fb68fe695f965e48ff","50c5416e7fb827ac9864c73b62d959c55965e721","86ea80743c2d4f5763006a12aac92bbdcad9b0da","a9cf4a8d4de84d2fdca84f9833d238e660d2a8a2","780464b091db6b80aa534c986d44df8e9de0a010","f34be18650ae805ca0213cf6b564d53dfebdc64a","55051edca121fa9c9dd2aa063fb7f37dec8c0520","33374f4803d0060e6ed41e5389440d6431b89663","62e1547530ae0556ab55381e7a0df9c9f9ec06c2","d77d1fb3181c288c6da9908a2d67fbc13a52b827","80ad7c23905423390264907707be485a9427d6eb","192e0d5f43e7577dcc8cd65c3b9faf07f2427087","fb23d0ba0292ac26fff4cf1d0a8e6d5815319359","6e91a77d5d4436203395c79473ef767fb18ddd44","d0be72f0dd2eef03425eef5b0639a85f3ae1c997","92407118a05f3c6c952eb00a8c84f183611ffbf9","4cd5d0d3df1b304ba08f3d566c4b4341f5b8f76a","129544aa2d2edc52f6600de9a9e3da85372ecebb","325be613122e6895b1ee8cf029f5a5dddb162af0","33a8be8cdbc3b921ae3dbdb61678f150d85dff3d","a0b8f4d44befeb07de4f8de11e8cecf76d659455","0298c93d3f63d365b4a2c66738db435ab28dae45","532d484efba62bea8ba4355871ef6e810fa2ffcb","c6aefce0039fdea81ead39197393cec1f825506a","f4eb1ef06069be59621005dc02bc7d4baa073403","b791a937f31c17d36e7a5dd05c7ddd21cd9dec65","4160faa593d93063e9dcffae6b1e6e9f3ea8d98a","e71d61001405d01083d470b601aa7925a6ae05f0","7ebf69322e758911b135a721c5705935a7807994","fd9ddadc5539d8e4d2b66fbd0e13dbafc3a18361","dc207be8538b517b49754bcc0257ab0b42dc4e19","21386b17a03e0229f73ee436b520bbf82267ba48","c4e55a9debe7104209e563309ac1437676091e94","945b536ed556d3faee067449aacfaa5706c1b3c1","3a6e51279f67ad0074c3ac527f3254e0171c782c","ac0f12a84cae05ae001051ddced09508cfd98059","74c27296fd6a1dfc07940b5c07d1d5354e5c1623","e6bcb6aae2402ef79307b30555c08b3c363fc547","8311a05af59c3c7a4bb88b19b0917146104aa57c","23b64f45d365e2d3a12e6b018835814b97883769","b233ea921a8e0e4567b3df1fd5d7a4c8477cf998","9abb95194e50334c1989f01a967d56bbec81fa0f","719e74b9a5677d74495f8e6f10fe5620e2475b37","d5670e85078897e8fa7ea7aec6b1f3cbdad7d0b4","77ef7ba1b0ca217c83b91c78b11e0f1551b352f8","c04944cd5f23d922cf69ba5f8907193bbf289d24","c9638c39e67dbfacd030e761cfd0cf98a84114ad","cb581a74b690d5d49b9a1441fb65829563c5bcc6","c46b320689e7d34c33275e619845891d3f7305e6","d329db337254615b3c21ede2c1052

The large majority of the species he discovered belong to the Anomodont group, of which Dicynodon is the best-known genus—characterized by having a tortoise-like beak with or without permanent-growing, large, upper canines. Carnivorous types are very much rarer than the vegetarian Anomodonts, and Bain was successful in getting only comparatively few specimens, and most of these in a very unsatisfactory condition. Most of his collecting was done in what we now regard as the middle zones of the Karroo, and the majority of his specimens belong to the suborders Gorgonopsia and Cynodontia.","inCitations":["6acf3e77272f34a00775244676761ac3b113b5b5","4e377a6cf13e881c3b08b6fe2a279c82aa78d704","74506903ff11174d680f1468bbc7fc6d0a0b36da","550838df9456cfc62940fbb4dd0d1f7d3986f654","ef214b480d017e378b2a487886c8e77b32746e48","3828793ec4496d6e701000f4b97a235f49070c03","6eb8458761dc33484df4e5c996c73ab8774ce616"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"On the Structure of the Skull in the Mammal-Like Reptiles of the Suborder Therocephalia","doi":"10.1098/rstb.1936.0001","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1098/rstb.1936.0001","venue":""}

In these dipoles the largest magnetic field error perturbing the particle closed orbit at 0.5 T injection field into the LHC, is caused by magnetization currents in the NbTi 1.8K or Nb 3 sn 4.5K filaments of expected 10 µm diameter. To compensate this negative 1.9 O/oo relative sextupole error at 3 cm bore diameter, a novel, elegant and inexpensive method is proposed ; one could either place a continuous, thin and concentric permanent sextupole layer within each 12 m long S.C. dipole or referably insert two short lumped correctors at its ends. To determine the compensation efficiency, systematic and random errors of the magnetization current effect in the S.C. windings and error sources in the permanent sextupole correctors due to geometrical, magnetic and temperature inlluences as well as to the interplay with the main dipole field are considered, taking notably into account that the correctors will have to operate at liquid helium temperature. Low temperature measurements on samples of permanent SmCo and NdBFe magnets indicate consistant and interesting improvement in the remanent field B r of about 7 %, excellent reproducibility of B r to a few 10-4at LN 2 , and LHe temperatures as well as very good mechanical behaviour. Low temperature sample measurements in external and opposed dipole fields up to 1.9 T resulted in a remanent field reduction of -AB r /B r = - 5.7 %. Reducing the opposed dipole field to zero, a permanent demagnetization effect of - 2.5 % remained. Based on computations, mechanical properties and low temperature permanent magnet sample measurements, the proposed compensation of magnetization current induced error in windings of superconducting magnets is entirely feasible ; an error reduction factor of3..5 can be expected. A correcting permanent sextupole prototype magnet has been ordered and will be completely tested.","inCitations":["2ee5539e310ce658112d8226faa267a656faa67f"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"A novel, elegant method for passive compensation of magnetization-current-induced field errors in the CERN LHC 10 T superconducting dipole magnets by permanent multipole magnets","doi":"10.1109/TMAG.1987.1064890","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMAG.1987.1064890","venue":""}

Small arms are difficult to track and are not the stuff of military parades, but they are immensely destructive. In addition to what is already circulating, a substantial percentage of what is newly produced enters the black market and is destined for conflict zones across the globe. I argue that the illicit trade in small arms should be understood not as a market but as a network, one that shares some important properties with networked forms of organization studied by sociologists. I then employ quantitative methods developed for the study of social networks in an effort to show the basic structure of illegal small arms transfers to Asia, including the Middle East. The analysis draws from my Illicit Arms Transfers (IAT) Dataset still in development, so the results make use of the most rudimentary information being collected. They are suggestive, however, and the analytical approach promises to shed considerable light on a corner of the international arms trade that is of great interest to the research and activist communities, and of great consequence to those in war-torn regions of the world. THE ILLICIT ARMS TRADE IN ASIA: A SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS Despite the downward trend in the total dollar value of the arms trade since the end of the cold war, few believe that there is a similar trend in the international transfer of small arms and light weapons (SALW). Comprehensive and reliable longitudinal data on the volume of the SALW trade are not available, but developments over the past two decades point to an increase in the flow of this type of weaponry. The proliferation of low-intensity warfare, conflicts in which SALW figure prominently, is a source of increased demand, while stocks of military surplus created by the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact and the collapse of the Soviet Union vastly increased supply. Light weaponry continues to be produced—by an expanding number of manufacturers, many of them driven to export in order to achieve economies of scale—and some of this is added to the second-hand equipment circulating in today’s war zones. Of this trade in SALW, the value of which has been estimated at roughly $4 billion per year, probably 10-20 percent occurs in the black and gray markets. Information about the illicit arms trade abounds, particularly in the form of investigative journalism. Although much of this information has been gathered, collated, and examined by researchers in the academic and activist communities, systematic data collection and analysis has yet to proceed very far. Data collection itself is a formidable task. Aside from the obvious difficulty deriving from the efforts of black marketeers to keep their activities out of view, the variety of actors, locales, equipment, and forms of transaction involved in the illicit arms trade presents a major challenge for any attempt to catalog them in a systematic way. Nevertheless, some progress is being made and perhaps it is not too early to begin mapping the structure of black market transfers of SALW.

The dynamics of the two-mode system is integrable under 1:1 coupling except that when more couplings such as 2:3 resonance are present it may become unintegrable. A three-mode system is in general not integrable due to couplings and its dynamics is very complicated and includes periodic, quasi-periodic, irregular and chaotic motions. The dynamics of su(3) algebra will be drastically different. In the chapter the algebraic properties and dynamical behavior is considered to lay the foundation of the algebraic approach to the molecular highly excited vibration. For a three-mode system, its Hamiltonian up to the second order anharmonicities without couplings is shown in detail in the chapter. For numerical calculation, ᾀ ᾀ 1 and ὠ are taken as -50.45cm -1 and 0.15 cm -1 and 3428.99 cm -1, it is taken as 1000 cm -1 100 cm -1 and 10 cm -1 to show strong, medium, and weak couplings.

The main objective of this study is to understand the magmatic evolution of the volcanic complex and to develop a model to answer some outstanding questions related to bimodal products of rift related volcanism, using geological mapping, petrographic and geochemical approaches. The Boku complex is characterized by two main phases of activity: pre-caldera/caldera forming eruptive activity and post-caldera eruptive activity. The volcanic stratigraphy consists from bottom to top of a sequence of rhyolitic lava flows, pumice flows, welded ignimbrite, pumice fall, rhyolitic lava dome, obsidian flow, lower basaltic lava flow, ash flow, basaltic scoria and upper basaltic lava flows. The lithologic varieties together with the geochemical results indicate that the Boku eruptive products are bimodal in composition; no intermediate compositions are found. The mafic rocks are transitional to weakly subalkaline basalts while the silicic rocks are predominantly peralkaline rhyolites. These two groups of rocks are co-genetic and related to each other by fractional crystallization processes starting from mantle-derived basaltic magma with a small component of crustal contamination. The available geophysical, geochemical and field data suggest that the evolution of the evolved silicic center which hosts a bimodal rock distribution can be explained as a result of prolonged stagnation of transitional basaltic melt (sourced from the mantle) at relatively high pressures, where these evolve to intermediate compositions. The transitional basaltic melts can occasionally erupt to the surface along weakness lines such as faults that infrequently cut the lower part of the shallow reservoir, generating basalts from the intra-caldera and lateral eruptive centers. We consider the intermediate magma is mechanically trapped at mid-crustal depths because of its higher crystal load (ca. 50%). Silicic magma is formed at shallow depth by prolonged fractional crystallization of the intermediate magma and minor assimilation of crustal material. These silicic magmas generate both effusive and explosive eruption products in the overall stratigraphy of the volcanic complex.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://goldschmidtabstracts.info/2019/3294.pdf"],"title":"Magmatic evolution of the Boku Volcanic Complex, Main Ethiopian Rift","doi":"10.1016/j.jafrearsci.2018.08.003","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jafrearsci.2018.08.003","venue":""}

These major air pollutants impose harmful impact on human health. In this study, the varying trends of ambient air quality and the levels of related air pollutants are analyzed based on the database monitored at Bahadurshah Jafar marg near ITO intersection, air quality monitoring station. Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) approach, implemented by Box–Jenkins is used to forecast the levels of ambient air quality parameters. The performance evaluations of the adopted models are carried out on the basis of correlation coefficient (R2) and root mean square error (RMSE). The results indicate that the seasonal ARIMA model provide reliable and satisfactory predictions for the air quality parameters and expected to be an alternative tool for practical assessment and justification.","inCitations":["cb6f7fd93b1dc92ce62e4077ee535b8c1187b1e5","0ff9d3acb355d4cdf635390c88adf794390de3a7"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Time Series Analysis of Ambient Air Quality at Ito Intersection in Delhi (india)","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Ces relations sont-elles specifiques ? Trois objectifs sont proposes, pour chacun d'eux , nous presentons un eclairage cote emprunteur et un cote preteur. Le premier, en lien avec les evolutions reglementaires, montre que l'information est au cœur de la relation et que tout changement ou evolution de l'information impacte la relation. Le second objectif, plus strategique, montre que la prise en consideration de biais de comportement (biais de sur-confiance et d'optimisme) ou que la mise en place d'une relation durable entre le preteur et l'emprunteur impacte les decisions d'octroi de credit. Le troisieme objectif, de nature financiere, montre que la relation preteur emprunteur amene a la determination de voies d'endettement « optimales » pour un menage mais, egalement, a la reduction du risque du preteur dans le cadre de la theorie du portefeuille. Une methodologie a la fois qualitative et quantitative est utilisee. Nous constatons que l'equilibre est de type melangeant et que la relation bancaire n'impacte qu'indirectement ce marche. La prise en compte de comportements biaises pour les emprunteurs conduit a une composition du portefeuille de credits moins risquee pour le preteur. La relation preteur emprunteur est apprehendee a partir de l'analyse des systemes de partage de l'information des 27 Etats de l'Union Europeenne.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"La relation prêteur-emprunteur : une application au marché français du crédit à la consommation","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

In this method, an appropriate mixture of ethanol (as the disperser solvent) and 1-undecanol (as the extracting solvent) containing appropriate amount of 2-thenoyltrifluoroacetone (TTA) (as the complexing agent) was injected rapidly into the water sample containing iron (II) and iron (III) species. At this step, the iron species interacted with the TTA and extracted into the 1-undecanol. After the phase separation, the absorbance of the extracted irons was measured in the wavelength region of 450-600 nm. The artificial neural networks were then applied for simultaneous determination of individual iron species. Under optimum conditions, the calibration graphs were linear in the range of 95-1070 μg L(-1) and 31-350 μg L(-1) with detection limits of 25 and 8 μg L(-1) for iron (II) and iron (III), respectively.

In addition, pimozide, which can selectively inactivate dopamine receptors in the brain, produces similar pharmacological effects to ouabain when given by the same route of administration in the mouse, although a significant degree of sedation and catalepsy can be induced using doses of pimozide that have little effect on body temperature. Further observations involving the interaction of ouabain with the dopamine receptor stimulant apomorphine suggest that the catalepsy and hypothermia produced by ouabain both involve central dopaminergic pathways. Whereas the production of catalepsy appears to be the result of a dopamine receptor blockade, possibly in the corpus striatum, the production of hypothermia, although associated with increased brain dopamine levels, is not.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Possible involvement of a dopaminergic pathway in the depressant effe ts of ouabain on the central nervous system.","doi":"10.1016/0028-3908(73)90105-6","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/0028-3908%2873%2990105-6","venue":"Neuropharmacology"}

Age standardized incidence rates (ASRs) were estimated using direct standardization and the standard population of World Health Organization (WHO). Data was analyzed using Cochran-Armitage test for linear trend and software of WinPepi 2.1.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOf 3,584 cases of liver cancer recorded between 2003 and 2009, 2,224 and 1,360 cases were men and women, respectively, which revealed significantly increasing trends (p=0.001). The highest incidence rate (950 cases) occurred in 2007 and the lowest rate (256 cases) in 2003. Based on the result, liver cancer incidence was more in men compared to women and the incidence increased with age.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nAccording to this study, the trend of age-standardized incidence rate of liver cancer in Iran is rising. Hence to prevent and control this cancer, it is necessary to investigate the related risk factors and implement prevention programs in Iran.","inCitations":["c8c70b336ead54a88d610a41dfb3bbf7aaa4cfc3","91bda766b1fabbb9256e72be8410284d4d85b71e","bbd6993686203f77192b03b9fafa6c70fdde1331","543b99bffdaadfc061b62e067a8f1a4f7d46088e","50a37a1c202ff42344dd99d680e839f9398870d7","8777548b3ef3e487a490b2e1d53efe5e29f7dde9","67f40b379eb5003969a4e634a3f7541fe7e41d89","5372c1097743de9d3354cb2888ada790fad13080","355e75cf2156a40a91bc54f10976c17430fbcf00","177cabbcd08e1aa63f9f94c687fd58992a5f3c31","2ac0942064e7088e57b1f4e8bdbb63d6766944af"],"pdfUrls":["https://www.jcpsp.pk/archive/2016/Apr2016/15.pdf"],"title":"Incidence and Trend of Liver Cancer in Iran.","doi":"","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"Journal of the College of Physicians and Surgeons--Pakistan : JCPSP"}

This study conducted a systematic random sampling. Questionnaires were distributed to home economics teachers from 285 middle schools, 123 high schools, and 130 of them were sampled as the subjects of this study. The results of this study were as follows. First, home economics teachers were active participating school lifelong educational program. But according to the result of research on the actual condition, the proportion of taking part in it was low. More than half of home economics teachers who took part in program's lecturer were in charge of computer courses. So they didn't show their ability as expert. Also they were in charge of several works than roll of lecturers. It was mentioned too great a burden. There is little in-service training for meeting specialization for school lifelong education. They wanted to take part of lecturers of program and preferred hours of being over class. More than half of them had intended to obtain a lifelong educator's license. The part of elective courses for obtaining a lifelong educator's license is similar to home economics educational contents. So, they have an advantage of obtaining it. Second, one-fifth of school that gave school life education carried out program of related home economics. Mostly they had mothers of students-oriented programs on artistic topics and leisure. But this is that home economics teachers mentioned less important teaching at society in the future. They importantly mentioned program on children's education in now and the future. Parents of students and local residents also extremely wanted it. For differentiated school life education, quality of programs is important greatly. Third, the actual condition of practical room relating home economics is only practice to cook mostly. So they are reluctant to be open it because of being responsible for the results from using there. It is necessary to ameliorate there's facilities and to increase there's area. Fourth, home economics teachers want to improve their specialization through in-service training, to develop and diffuse programs of superior quality, and to get extra pay for overtime from the government.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"가정과교사가 인식한 학교 평생교육을 위한 가정과 자원의 활용 실태 및 활성화 방안","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

This paper presents a novel account that appeals to a peculiar presuppositional property of why questions and their impact on the information structure of Wh-questions.

There was complete restorative dentin bridge a month later. The bridge became thick and dense, and mainly was tubular dentin in 3 month. There were well developed odontoblasts under the bridge. In the calcium hydroxide capping group, inflammatory cytonecrosis zone was found in the surface of dental pulp and only a little calcial bodies formed in two weeks. Complete restorative dentin bridge was formed in 1 to 3 months, the speed of dentin bridge formation was not as quick as that of DPP group.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nDPP can induce pulp cells to develop into odontoblasts and formation of dentin bridge with little stimulation to the dental pulp.

Sustainability is no longer a political or moral flag, sustentability has become a necessity. Aquaponics has been predominantly spread throughout the world through household-scale producers. Aquaponics is a method of producing food that involves the integration of aquaculture and hydroponics in recirculating systems for water and nutrients. Furthermore, Aquaponics presents itself as a real alternative for the production of food with reduced impact to the environment for its sustainability characteristics. Thus, Aquaponics is among the sustainable techniques involving fish and vegetable integrated production, capable of benefiting both. This integration allows the plant to use the nutrients from the water provided by the fish, thus improving water quality.","inCitations":["def55dc9257bb69a475c535f74e8c299171cc6f2"],"pdfUrls":["https://periodicos.ufv.br/ojs/rbas/article/download/2809/1292"],"title":"Aquaponics: Integration between Aquaculture and Hydroponics","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Even the most promising nanoparticulate delivery systems have challenges from gastrointestinal barriers. The novel approach using bio-inspired yeast microcapsule helps in the delivery of charged nanoparticles like quantum dots, iron oxide nanoparticle and various fluorescent nanoparticles. The long-term administration has a good safety profile compared to other delivery systems. Particles can be incorporated into yeast microcapsule by electrostatic interaction, layer-by-layer approach, and surface derivatization. Areas covered: The article highlights the various applications of yeast cells in drug delivery. The authors describe the mechanism of encapsulation into yeast cells. The authors discuss various methods used for cell wall preparation and mechanisms associated with the passage of yeast cell through the gastrointestinal tract. The authors also review the association of biotechnology with bioengineering and synthetic biology approaches in transforming yeast as a delivery vehicle. Expert opinion: Yeast provides an opportunity to use the principles of biotechnology and bioengineering to tune it to an efficient drug delivery carrier. The applications of yeast microcapsule for oral and topical administration are noteworthy. It is proved that yeast microcapsules prepared from yeast cells are promising drug delivery carriers.","inCitations":["21431afc03e319eb30282fd9fe0e49100572aa75"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Yeast-inspired drug delivery: biotechnology meets bioengineering and synthetic biology.","doi":"10.1080/17425247.2019.1551874","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1080/17425247.2019.1551874","venue":"Expert opinion on drug delivery"}

This is due to the need to meet more competitive market conditions by increasing power/weight ratio without incurring mechanical unreliability. Many engine components are inherently most difficult to analyse by theoretical approaches. The adoption of model techniques for experimental stress analysis can show great savings in cost compared with the use of prototype full-scale testing for proving mechanical strength. The advantages of model techniques for prediction of stresses due to mechanical loading are discussed in the paper, and some applications, using plastic, rubber, cardboard and aluminium models are described together with a full account of the experimental techniques, results and limitations.","inCitations":["9f546daab65d462db880dcd6bd6c24bdd4719d13"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Structural Model Techniques and Their Application to Oil Engine Design","doi":"10.1243/PIME_PROC_1964_179_037_02","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1243/PIME_PROC_1964_179_037_02","venue":""}
