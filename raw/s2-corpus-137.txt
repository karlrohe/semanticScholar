However, there are a number of factors that affect a team’s productivity. Thus, understanding the team dynamics and the different factors that influence their working is essential to improving their productivity. One such key factor is the amount of time a team spends on communicating to completing their tasks. This paper reports on a small scale case study, of (eight participants in) four student groups, using extreme programming. The study was conducted in a controlled environment to study the factors that may affect a team communication time, during the implementation phase. We found communication time between team members of the same gender is the longest. However, forming a team with relatively equal experience and including a well documented pre-training reduces the communication time significantly","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://fada.birzeit.edu/jspui/bitstream/20.500.11889/4149/1/Communication%20Time%20in%20Extreme%20Programming.pdf"],"title":"Communication Time in Extreme ProgrammingTeams: A Controlled Case Study","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

It is unclear how evidence demonstrating the efficacy of combination 5-alpha reductase inhibitors and alpha blockers for improving symptoms and reducing risk of disease progression translates into real-world practice for the treatment of BPH. A retrospective study of a database was conducted to describe pharmacotherapy utilization/trends in the treatment of BPH among patients in the managed care setting. After inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied, the final sample size was 107,038. The proportion of patients with BPH receiving 5-alpha reductase inhibitors therapy increased (21.1% in 2003 to 30.5% in 2007), as did the proportion receiving combination therapy (10.7% and 16.1%, respectively). We observed an almost 50% increase in 5-alpha reductase inhibitors use over 5 years and a 60% increase in the use of combination 5-alpha reductase inhibitors/alpha blockers therapy.","inCitations":["261a143814be22a164dc6da60b3865fd17ae425f"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Evaluation of Recent Trends in Treatment Patterns Among Men With Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia","doi":"10.1177/1557988312469245","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1177/1557988312469245","venue":"American journal of men's health"}

Adapting the method of [8] to the context of speech recognition, this paper uses a recursive divide-andconquer algorithm to reduce the space requirement to logarithmic in the number of frames. With this procedure, it is possible to do exact computations for observation sequences of essentially arbitrary length. The procedure works by manipulating a stack of alpha vectors, and by using sparse vectors, the space savings can be combined with those of traditional pruning techniques. We apply this technique to MAP lattice construction, and present the rst results in the literature for that technique. We nd that it is an e ective way of creating word lattices, and that doing the exact computations enabled by the log-space technique results in lower word error rates than space saving via traditional pruning.","inCitations":["4bcf33754c0b573ee066103a1c21c7229de007a9","25badc676197a70aaf9911865eb03469e402ba57","e4900d5c2da2cc3bd47669fc06337abba62e7200","5d10cf2382aaa86dd64fb3accb33b971e8346443","11f9664eb42cdbe6f434aea3381458d4055328f6","7c77b8ff77a5118f6c121d40ec28292e3920462a","5b3296cfe3104c562c4033393c0b4ce9e3f20555","1789bb205a815dc4bdfd019f67c1c4d23f9cc30f","58a367a84323f5245d7d1740ed159774e8bcc6b5","03c9e963e0896040c96e32057a7bd97eafc3c595","25c11857cb9eea54589e830c92263cf6af3c864a","81e449ab7747dd9dec6e13a50346e1690b9dfd78","97dcff36f285864bf47bb0eed2d343136ec3886f","d2abea2ac0f677fa0b68aace67bcfd019a3491d4","a5013cf1115462edf1b8c9e2c91861f81a2cead7","31ae04c6ad9801edf4043cce3ce3110eac1aca3e","222c23cba96dd487eee0722d3d302cc97e70d18e","c03a8a2cbdb9d209040d76e4450ef1135cf1c793","7573c7a38b73334d1be3627f776b8f295b38a2a1","f5f9e4512b74de4b52836f3f5ac8514be31bc157","5ff709f0afc5d0a077c292f4e86cd3087cab0a97","897f5c2740d3b3ba8f5782f41dc22ecee8aa0839","5e86e17d83c97dafa3413d1d0dae219bd527ed61","1dc7039fe215331900cf14747a85ee8ac460172b"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.isca-speech.org/archive/icslp_2000/i00_2855.html","http://www.isca-speech.org/archive/archive_papers/icslp_2000/i00_2855.pdf","http://www.research.ibm.com/people/m/mukund/postscript/icslp00d.ps"],"title":"Exact alpha-beta computation in logarithmic space with application to MAP word graph construction","doi":"","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"INTERSPEECH"}

The influence of ingredient composition and bacterial cultures on kinetics of acidification, α-amylase activity of the bacteria, apparent viscosity and microstructure of the fermented products was investigated. During fermentation of the gruels, α-amylase activity was determined through the Ceralpha method and apparent viscosity, flux behavior and thixotropy were determined in a rotational viscometer. Rheological data were fitted to Power Law model. The combination of amylolytic and probiotic bacteria strains reduced the fermentation time of the gruels as well as increased the α-amylase activity. The addition of passion fruit fiber exerted less influence on the apparent viscosity of the fermented products than the composition of the bacterial cultures. Scanning electron microscopy provided evidence of exopolysaccharide production by amylolytic bacteria strains in the food matrices tested. The co-cultures made of amylolytic and probiotic bacteria strains are suitable to reduce the fermentation time of a soy milk/rice matrix and to obtain a final product with pH and viscosity similar to yoghurt.","inCitations":["69e061eaadd4f203c273d354cae59f09935a778b","4a864396aef19693a28564d790e53f00461ba2e2","795d2a295bac8ff844cf062ebbd4525936095552","5063c0e6b7e85c4bea4678efb3b37bb8937d860e","b2c36ebaa90022c9a2ee0147a9f55e0975d115bf","3a0e16b9b3202f5ed61c98095489cfaa73e627df","437d0befb374f024800cb43223665bfbb5483f71","77a6fd88143f1cbbd1e11357e7025174d28e5b73","12d3518f3ba21859282271a238b59a7156f9b901","95b73552c0d8fc910eeab863c1c45a201c920eab","4d884681d142aafe2912ad721f3acfe07b6c0e03","b8f3ed68d4bccf34b0f049119bbc1b850671cad3","f7ace1d10f440fdc4ce65b65669df1d16181cc76"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Influence of cofermentation by amylolytic Lactobacillus strains and probiotic bacteria on the fermentation process, viscosity and microstructure of gruels made of rice, soy milk and passion fruit fiber","doi":"10.1016/j.foodres.2014.01.028","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2014.01.028","venue":""}

Incubation of the cells with 20 mM-glucose for 25 h decreased the rate of 2-deoxy-D-[3H]glucose (dGlc) uptake to 0.106 +/- 0.016 nmol/min per 10(6) cells compared with 0.212 +/- 0.025 in cells maintained at 2 mM-glucose (final glucose concentrations at the end of the incubation period were 16-17 mM and 0.7-1.0 mM respectively). An additional 5 h incubation of these cells with medium containing the opposite glucose concentration (i.e. change from 17 mM to 1 mM and from 1 mM to 17 mM) increased the transport rate to 0.172 +/- 0.033 nmol/min per 10(6) cells in cultures initially conditioned at high glucose, and decreased the transport to 0.125 +/- 0.029 in those conditioned at low glucose. Plasma-membrane- and microsomal-membrane-enriched fractions were prepared from these cells for [3H]cytochalasin B (CB) binding and Western-blot analysis with antibodies against GLUT-1 and GLUT-4. A decrease in glucose concentration increased the number of D-glucose-displaceable CB-binding sites and GLUT-1 protein in the plasma-membrane fraction to the same extent as the increase in dGlc transport. Under downregulatory conditions, the lower dGlc-transport capacity could be accounted for by a decreased number of transporters in the plasma membrane of the cells. No apparent modification of the intrinsic activity of the glucose transporters was observed in up- or down-regulated cells. Under downregulatory conditions, the CB-binding data indicated a large increase in the number of transporters in the intracellular membranes of the myocytes. Western blots of the same membranes also indicated an increase in GLUT-1 content. However, the interaction of the intracellular GLUT-1 protein with the polyclonal antibodies was much weaker than that of the plasma-membrane-associated GLUT-1. The GLUT-4 concentration was too low to permit quantification in membrane fractions. Our findings suggest that autoregulation of glucose transport in L8 myocytes is accompanied by parallel changes in the number of GLUT-1 transporters in the plasma membrane, and that the rate of transporter degradation may be augmented in the upregulated myocytes. These glucose-induced changes are fully reversible.","inCitations":["8b3bd661f5e25a960a9ca52095e251a6ed19a154","20986d32c6df09957149764ddb36352e94d44685","26850d0be93693797abdd0c20e4895c68abd071b","4104a45be025024052fd5e17a351ceafe88e4ea0","294a6c5fe6592b212414e0681f7362a7ac5dcc7c","00b9ebac762d2e60b1fa90af91ba575d6d9db64c","f122d1141427d72e52cd08a6bb5f2da8f7f0b711","88bc06e2b0348cc68375cb29515066cb8a8c8981","27787f5d2552675a94aa06f9a070f505dced01aa"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Glucose regulates its transport in L8 myocytes by modulating cellular trafficking of the transporter GLUT-1.","doi":"10.1042/bj2860157","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1042/bj2860157","venue":"The Biochemical journal"}

Very well directed and superbly acted, Hamlet was a memorable experience, at once exciting and poignant. The production of Cymbeline was enjoyable and, in a way, illuminating, but it hardly convinced one that Cymbeline can be treated as a very serious work of dramatic art. The staging of The Tempest, one regrets to say, was calamitously dull and uninspired. Does one excellent production cancel out one very poor one? The question cannot be answered, but there was enough good theater at the Great Lakes Festival to persuade audiences that Shakespeare is very much alive and kicking in Lakewood, Ohio. Each year, of course, the makeup of the company varies. This year the group was substantially stronger than the year before. It included accomplished actresses and almost a surfeit of talented actors. Jeremiah Sullivan and Evan Williams, who played major roles last year, were joined by such gifted newcomers as Keith Mackey, Richard Fancy, David Palmer, Richard Bowden, and Don Bishop in secondary roles. Lawrence Carra's limitations as a director were obvious in his production of The Tempest, which demands delicacy of poetic imagination and an aura of wonder and magic. He is much more at home with familiar realities-with flesh-and-blood, psychologically motivated characters. But then his command of the stage is impressive: the pacing, the rhythm, and the ensembles of Hamlet and Cymbeline were very good indeed. There were practically none of the comic vulgarizations of minor characters that marred some of Carra's previous productions. At the core of the dullness of The Tempest was Tom Gorman's portrayal of Prospero as an aged, smiling, reassuring, avuncular, almost Polonian, Prospero, who had difficulty speaking the glorious poetry of his role. Elsewhere there was not much that reminded one of lyric grace. All was pedestrian and attenuated, incapable of sea-change. The costumes were pastel, and so too were Sebastian and Antonio, who were depicted as interior decorators trying to be effeminate villains. With so many fine actors in his company, one wonders why Carra allowed Gorman to play Prospero, Polonius, and Bellarius as variations on Lionel Barrymore, and why he gave the kingly roles of Alonzo and Cymbeline to Charles Smith, an operatic tenor of very limited acting abilities and no royal presence. The lack of organic conception in The Tempest was most apparent in the staging of the hymeneal masque as a ballet, performed by members of the Cleveland Civic Ballet to music by Arthur Sullivan. The choreography was uninspired; the ballet went on and on, and had no stylistic relation to the Elizabethan, the Shakespearian, or The Tempest. Strong performances by Jeremiah Sullivan as Caliban, Keith Mackey as Stephano, and Josef Warik as Ariel kept disaster in check.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"The Great Lakes Shakespeare Festival","doi":"10.2307/2867642","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.2307/2867642","venue":""}

Analysis results show that the AVM is only effective as long as the capacitors are large enough to maintain nearly constant voltage across each MMC submodule. This paper also shows that previously developed MMC averaged models are not able to accurately simulate the transients under dc fault conditions. This paper introduces topology changes to a previously proposed averaged model that results in much improved simulation for such conditions. This paper also shows that the model can be used effectively to study HVDC grids with significant time savings.","inCitations":["2863d61be2defa99f9587b8bdaebbaf29017dfaf","c153d661a01cd0d4217722c4831ab782e81af5eb","a7e6acd9c92348847a845d5f6b5046d903cf24bf","a4b9615adab9aee0ae2ea401d3cd9aa2de0e3802","618334e9346ee9b7befc75d80db0a88cb9b27beb","22c6f308735d80ca07c7a26b7280d86d1eb6f4b0","2783ef3f26189f8a37b1c7530fe4feeafb031dcb","c74e25f92e7ce73766c9b92edd83541dc1c3a3d7","b703d5e220bf476f3d2906c46e215a299dd4393f","987b53426d66b9887aab14b18df9ab5829147d1a","ef9ba2d52c519e96be49c08abed65e5f5392f53e","386858b1d62eb5212caad2b7f09766478c604f55","2bec15f0b3afe199f7ad4917241e930269053287","2fdcadc7e3ea0066cb6824dfd7acde03ffa22a6c","57680593dd2d8195ad1baa2e761a7a9091e228aa","1cb3d86ff9974abd26b009e04c21c0e123431f49","59f0c6e144e23258db0f4751eb44e209b1a6c40b"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"The Use of Averaged-Value Model of Modular Multilevel Converter in DC Grid","doi":"10.1109/PESGM.2015.7285775","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PESGM.2015.7285775","venue":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery"}

They are usually small, well-encapsulated tumors with low mitotic activity, and concurrently carry low risk of recurrence. Here, we report a case of atypical histological variant of spinal schwannoma that had higher cellular density, nuclear atypia and lack of encapsulation. To our best knowledge, no such cases of this atypical variant with regards to lumbar spine have been reported in the literature.\n\n\nCASE REPORT\nA 66-year-old male had an incidental left-sided paraspinal mass discovered while undergoing workup for cholecystitis. On examination, the patient was neurologically intact. Imaging revealed the presence of contrast-enhanced, partially cystic mass arising from L3-4 intervertebral foramen and causing left psoas muscle displacement. A minimally invasive left L3-4 posterior extra-cavitary resection was done. Histopathologic examination revealed partly unencapsulated tumor with higher than usual cellular density and nuclear atypia, resulting in a diagnosis of 'atypical schwannoma.' Follow-up imaging at 6 months follow-up showed stable post-surgical changes and residual tumor with no evidence of progression/recurrence.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nAtypical schwannoma has higher cellular density, nuclear atypia and lack encapsulation. Review of the literature suggests an increased risk of recurrence when compared to typical variants and complete tumor removal should be attempted.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Partially Cystic Lumbar Schwannoma with Atypical Histopathological Features.","doi":"10.1016/j.wneu.2020.03.131","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.wneu.2020.03.131","venue":"World neurosurgery"}

Twelve focus groups of people receiving HIV care were conducted in community settings in South-East England. Groups were quota sampled based on age, gender, sexual orientation and ethnicity. Data were analysed using Framework Analysis. The results showed that among the 74 respondents (61% male), a preference for maintaining all care within specialist HIV clinics was commonplace, but was highest among participants with more extensive histories of HIV and comorbidities. Participants valued care-coordination, inter-service communication and timely updates to medical notes. There were high levels of concern around HIV skills in general practices and the capacity of general practitioners to manage patient confidentiality or deal appropriately with the emotional and social challenges of living with HIV. Participants valued, and had an overall preference for, the specialist knowledge and skills of HIV services, suggesting that non-HIV-specialist services will need to build their appeal if they are to have a greater future role in the care of people with HIV. Particular concerns that should be addressed include: patient confidence in the HIV knowledge and skills of non-specialist service providers; clear processes for prescribing and referrals; improved levels of care-coordination and communication between services and increased patient confidence in the capacity of primary care to maintain confidentiality and to appreciate the stigma associated with HIV.","inCitations":["49a24d1a09ec8ffb8e3cff125765ad2add544a69"],"pdfUrls":["http://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/10044544/1/Sabin_Sabin_Patients%20perspectives%20on%20the%20development%20of%20HIV%20services_Int%20J%20STD%20%20AIDS%20-FINAL%20CLEAN.pdf","http://sro.sussex.ac.uk/74557/3/Patients%20perspectives%20on%20the%20development%20of%20HIV%20services_Int%20J%20STD%20%20AIDS%20-FINAL%20CLEAN.pdf","http://sro.sussex.ac.uk/id/eprint/74557/3/Patients%20perspectives%20on%20the%20development%20of%20HIV%20services_Int%20J%20STD%20%20AIDS%20-FINAL%20CLEAN.pdf"],"title":"Patients’ perspectives on the development of HIV services to accommodate ageing with HIV: a qualitative study","doi":"10.1177/0956462417735723","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1177/0956462417735723","venue":"International journal of STD & AIDS"}

FL of NO3− and SO42− decreased as follows: pine >> cedar > cypress ≥ oak and pine >> cedar > oak ≥ cypress, respectively. FL of NO3− for all tree species fluctuated synchronously with CL of T-NO3. FL of SO42− fluctuated with CL of SOx, but the dominant pollutant deposited (SO2 or SO42−) appeared to differ for different tree species. Dry deposition conductance (KL) of T-NO3 and SOx was derived as an FL/CL ratio. Seasonal variations of KL likely reflect the gas/particle ratios of T-NO3 and SOx, which were affected by meteorological conditions such as temperature. Dry deposition velocities (Vd) of T-NO3 and SOx were obtained as the mathematical product of annual mean KL and the total leaf surface areas in the forests. The comparison of Vd among tree species indicated that the loads of acidic air pollutants were higher to coniferous forests than broad-leaved forest because of the higher KL and/or larger leaf surface areas.","inCitations":["9b0ba44e7b089a439382ec0b3fb7a3d561438ff7","edfd8440e3fc50f6612da9a3270f43caec13b76b","046077900c08decda57bbcfabf929b79c0008d08","2246c6aaca57cd92d59e9a119d2a7e439318dc35","6a00f8a901f1781370fa27416507b4e2ea9ee033"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Dry deposition of acidic air pollutants to tree leaves, determined by a modified leaf-washing technique","doi":"10.1016/j.atmosenv.2008.07.015","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2008.07.015","venue":""}

In a SECO, an organization wants to achieve its business objectives supported by technologies based on a common ecosystem platform. Modifications on technologies can make essential systems unsupported or low performance. Thus, IT managers should consider information about technologies and their relationships. Such information may be spread in different documents and/or difficult to analyze due to the lack of support. As such, related attributes assist IT managers and architects in making decisions on the IT architecture modification, i.e., the set of technologies supporting products and services adopted by an organization. This research aims to identify architecture attributes that affect a SECO and its platform and technologies from the literature. With the intention of comparing this research to a well-accepted standard, ISO/IEC 25000 characteristics were analyzed against architecture attributes. Then, we have evaluated such attributes with experts from industry and academia based on a survey research. As a result, 64 attributes were identified and grouped by 11 critical factors. Critical factors are macro attributes that encompass other attributes. Then, a better understanding on how IT managers and architects’ choices can affect SECO could help them to take actions to mitigate negative effects.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-33742-1_6"],"title":"Identifying Architecture Attributes in the Context of Software Ecosystems Based on a Mapping Study","doi":"10.1007/978-3-030-33742-1_6","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-33742-1_6","venue":"ICSOB"}

With the corresponding precursors of hydroxide composites prepared during the first stage, ion exchange (from OH− to S2−) and reduction of GO are performed on subsequently, resulting in NiS/rGO composite. The NiS nanorods uniformly distribute on the surface of graphene, forming a 3D conductive network. The electrochemical performances of the composite are investigated in extenso as electrode materials for supercapacitors, and it exhibits preferable cycling performances and excellent capacitance. These satisfactory electrochemical behaviors can be attributed to the introduction of graphene, which enhances the specific surface area and electronic conductivity of the electrode, producing more active sites for the charging/discharging process and facilitating fast electron transport through the underlying graphene layers.","inCitations":["0a1fa58711700242ee68fd0ad5d217d53c569c61","9bc5f6d4fc0c8497557f5ea2b1de37fe5f8a3086","7a9292ec6f66a56af59964e684d0c4452e9a734b","21139805532b11872f4e41ed6ffa62d9f4162d0a","c017ad7bf7539c881be6191eca9b6ce87e80fbd3","3d9ecbdefe38fc5174775fb32abcb27202ff69bf","0234428424524d5a10b97e741293664d44f8f276","b12bd22925f6a8479628e52b761bbac3e6a7ed4d","4b6839269fe94989b089aaa88f71d7207f8bd6c7","325f338d18d183450b2f02ab1daddd4f74fcfd9a","7bfbc3a738c768510405e29a31784991eee99253","a5f8907d32a3d6729fa56262223fe35088133330","e604d982f2b088a961bd9064908ee35155510795","ed2b805ce5804b619b886d6f6bd0eb919ebb3486","cd7f12bdbcbae9cd516cba872b8cae8a6ecff386","620aee517710c9c731a37e892cf36a47b34f4957","1f135aaff028bb972b7ea2be2856f0d1eb314cd1","a229e25786fa286ad509c8e389e37d1a048bf76d"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Electrochemical performances investigation of NiS/rGO composite as electrode material for supercapacitors","doi":"10.1016/j.nanoen.2014.02.006","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nanoen.2014.02.006","venue":""}

Display manufactures calculate the area ratios of their displays' RGB triangles to a standard RGB triangle in the CIE 1931 xy or CIE 1976 u'v' chromaticity diagram to indicate the displays' relative gamut size. However, they typically fail to mention which of the two diagrams the metric is based on. This paper shows that the ratios calculated in the two chromaticity diagrams are highly inconsistent, and that the Rec. 2020 area-coverage ratios for wide-gamut displays in the xy diagram are much more correlated to the Rec. 2020 volume-coverage ratios in some color-appearance spaces than the Rec. 2020 area-coverage ratios in the u'v' diagram. This paper recommends the use of the xy diagram for area-coverage ratio calculations for wide-gamut displays.","inCitations":["627700c3713fd5be8648d4071c7c94aaad5fbb3c","73147b0534cbc9d9875244c7f37b09125fca086f","9a3eca63b57e071a8a8679328285a5fb7435b13d","6aa29387b042d6b5be6ad7fa907b1333be46e129","3f7c0fd80cdbc5197fb7782cf42a62071a1a253e","aa5a08ecd695e48556668954e422081eeae1f017","6772376436d3340aca65cdc85214d8e8a9375166","89a34292d0a292f400501697ff978a6f11c12c5d","b74729c23f9fa0b3129ab613e819a4801f4ab44a","a9b8ced345f7a1e53edc2d7caf3e94808d8b7a0a","e2cb973e77dd7382825de6f1bd641dfdd3bcafb8"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Metric of color-space coverage for wide-gamut displays.","doi":"10.1364/OE.23.007802","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1364/OE.23.007802","venue":"Optics express"}

A non-catalytic domain in A3G binds strongly to RNA, an interaction crucial for recruitment of A3G to the virion; yet, A3G displays no deamination activity for cytidines in viral RNA. Here, we report NMR and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation analysis for interactions between A3Gctd and multiple substrate or non-substrate DNA and RNA, in combination with deamination assays. NMR ssDNA-binding experiments revealed that the interaction with residues in helix1 and loop1 (T201-L220) distinguishes the binding mode of substrate ssDNA from non-substrate. Using 2'-deoxy-2'-fluorine substituted cytidines, we show that a 2'-endo sugar conformation of the target deoxycytidine is favored for substrate binding and deamination. Trajectories of the MD simulation indicate that a ribose 2'-hydroxyl group destabilizes the π-π stacking of the target cytosine and H257, resulting in dislocation of the target cytosine base from the catalytic position. Interestingly, APOBEC3A, which can deaminate ribocytidines, retains the ribocytidine in the catalytic position throughout the MD simulation. Our results indicate that A3Gctd catalytic selectivity against RNA is dictated by both the sugar conformation and 2'-hydroxyl group.","inCitations":["36791fe12d5d71a1d3d392ccec73289321914b43"],"pdfUrls":["https://escholarship.umassmed.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1038&context=schiffer"],"title":"Mechanism for APOBEC3G catalytic exclusion of RNA and non-substrate DNA","doi":"10.1093/nar/gkz550","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1093/nar%2Fgkz550","venue":"Nucleic acids research"}

The chosen theoretical perspective, that of S. B. Bacharach and E.J. Lawler, is considered appropriate to the current South African context as it offers an analysis of bargaining relationships which precede specific negotiating events and extend beyond these events. By viewing the bargaining relationship as an enduring power struggle, and by drawing an analytical distinction between potential power, tactical action and bargained outcomes, a framework is presented within which the effect of specific tactics on outcomes, as well as on subsequent power relations, can be analysed. It also allows for a bargaining analysis of power and tactics which can extend from the apartheid era through to the post‐apartheid era in South Africa.","inCitations":["7c7d10763df8b6aa6e6a04221d808b0697df7677"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Bargaining power: dependence capabilities and tactical options in South African politics","doi":"10.1080/02589349108704952","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1080/02589349108704952","venue":""}

Density and velocity distributions are systematically prescribed. The flux into the neutral particle analyzer (NPA) from this plasma is determined by summing over all charge exchange neutrals in phase space which are directed into apertures. Calculation of the process is continued through the NPA using appropriate cross section data to obtain analyzer output distributions. Theoretical results were compared with NPA measurements on four plasma heating devices having radial electric, E, fields and axial magnetic, B, fields. Drift velocity, in the azimuthal direction, is identified with E/B. Especially detailed data, obtained by sweeping the line of sight of the apertures across the plasma of the NASA Lewis HIP-1 burnout device, are presented. Selection of randomized cyclotron velocity distributions C about mean azimuthaldrift yield energy distributions which compare well with experiment. Use of data obtained with a bending magnet on the NPA showed that separation between energy distribution curves of various mass species correlate well with a drift divided by mean cyclotron energy parameter of the theory. Use of the guiding center model in conjunction with NPA scans across the plasma aid in estimates of ion density and E field variation with plasma radius.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19740019120.pdf"],"title":"Guiding center model to interpret neutral particle analyzer results.

Here we investigated the role of microbiota and IL-22 in T.gondii-induced small intestinal inflammation. Oral T.gondii infection in B6 mice causes inflammation with IFNγ and IL-22 production. In IL-22-deficient mice, T.gondii infection augments the Th1 driven inflammation. Deficiency in either IL-22bp, the soluble IL-22 receptor or Reg3γ, an IL-22-dependent antimicrobial lectin/peptide, did not reduce inflammation. Under germ-free conditions, T.gondii-induced inflammation was reduced in correlation with parasite load. But intestinal inflammation is still present in germ-free mice, at low level, in the lamina propria, independently of IL-22 expression. Exacerbated intestinal inflammation driven by absence of IL-22 appears to be independent of IL-22 deficiency associated-dysbiosis as similar inflammation was observed after fecal transplantation of IL-22-/- or WT microbiota to germ-free-WT mice. Our results suggest cooperation between parasite and intestinal microbiota in small intestine inflammation development and endogenous IL-22 seems to exert a protective role independently of its effect on the microbiota. In conclusion, IL-22 participates in T.gondii induced acute small intestinal inflammation independently of microbiota and Reg3γ.","inCitations":["bb88169461538056d5f26c1c1f3ffa63c2617d0d","fe77da8a0150477b9220fb7cc9250646844e4922"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Interleukin-22-deficiency and microbiota contribute to the exacerbation of Toxoplasma gondii-induced intestinal inflammation","doi":"10.1038/s41385-018-0005-8","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41385-018-0005-8","venue":"Mucosal Immunology"}

Previous cross-sectional studies showed that increased 18F-fluoride uptake lesions at vertebral corners were associated with both inflammation and structural changes on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and radiography, respectively, in patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS) 1,2 . But, longitudinal studies that investigated the association between increased 18F-fluoride uptake lesions and future syndesmophytes formation are lacking. Objectives We aimed to demonstrate that increased 18F-fluoride uptake lesions on PET predict the development of new syndesmophytes. Methods In 12 patients with AS, 18F-fluoride PET-MRI (Philips Healthcare, Cleveland, OH, USA) was performed at baseline and radiography was performed at baseline and 2 years. We recorded 18F-fluoride uptake lesions on PET, acute (type A) and advanced (type B) corner inflammatory lesions (CILs) and fat lesions on MRI and syndesmophytes on radiography. An increased 18F-fluoride uptake lesion was defined as an uptake greater than the uptake in the adjacent normal vertebral body (Figure 1). Results Of 231 anterior vertebral corners without syndesmophyte at baseline, 13 type A CILs (5.5%), 2 type B CILs (0.9%) and 20 fat lesions (8.7%) on MRI and 6 increased fluoride uptake lesions (2.6%) on PET were observed. After 2 years, 16 new syndesmophytes (6.9%) in 8 AS patients (66.7%) occurred. New syndesmophytes developed significantly more frequently in anterior vertebral corners with increased 18F-fluoride uptake lesions (50%) or fat lesions (25%) at baseline, as compared with those without either feature (5.8% and 5.2%, respectively). In generalised linear latent mixed models after adjusting within-patient correlation, baseline increased 18F-fluoride uptake lesion significantly predicted the development of new syndesmophytes (OR=20.6, 95% CI=2.7–156.1, p=0.003). Fat lesions were also associated with new syndesmophytes development (OR=9.3, 95% CI=2.1–40.2, p=0.003), but this association was not observed in CILs. Conclusions Our findings indicate that increased 18F-fluoride uptake lesions can predict future new syndesmophytes formation in patients with AS. 18F-fluoride PET may be used to estimate structural damage in these patients.

However, what the user sees on the monitor does not match its output, even if the monitor and the output device are calibrated with CIE/XYZ or CIE/Lab. This is especially obvious when correlated color temperature (CCT) of CRT monitor's white point significantly differs from ambient light. In a typical office environment, one uses a computer graphic monitor having a CCT of 9300K in a room of white fluorescent light of 4150K CCT. In such a case, human visual system is partially adapted to the CRT monitor's white point and partially to the ambient light. The visual experiments were performed on the effect of the ambient lighting. Practical method for soft copy color reproduction that matches the hard copy image in appearance is presented in this paper. This method is fundamentally based on a simple von Kries' adaptation model and takes into account the human visual system's partial adaptation and contrast matching.","inCitations":["794d0d32f5d8b5c3ef3825c3c3c4bff4bfde2fc6","ef63bf72c5b963d356dafa532e5472218ebe7d9d","835f47e92c5dc79c24eb0e6b6054cc7cb03a29ed","cbac9abf615af0106f4bdc57c05c1ca94a955505","1dab06b90b0884a0b0c646a5442ce2a883674a1b","bf52c27d2c7cf25a08f9652fa80dd9925112606a","bb5247c09bff3a323a4a20f8b1db12411814a01e","73cd9a3755bb61767b6960ae437e6f66a13f43b5","9cb9de695d1cce71532ea9ca090c7ef921adb0be","ca53504793d426efcc39e6f3e376a67468d5b57a","33a81fe133969a4a0b08b4489417da9e3cd53af8","2c17190c7556fa0ec387d0bdebbbfa092b5e415d","c941c2d29083527a853c13ff3a3a0d5e32566a79","fd0d4addebbedbcb2d9a3189a36733a9e6194c01","ccdf3797d5d7d0619e65a68344be65d6b189ad56","ef47fb5c6b513ba65cb56e0ab8473a4202d7a58e"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.imaging.org/site/PDFS/Papers/1997/RP-0-67/2394.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1117/12.173847"],"title":"Practical method for appearance match between soft copy and hard copy","doi":"10.1117/12.173847","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1117/12.173847","venue":"Electronic Imaging"}
