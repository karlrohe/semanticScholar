It was expected that their buccal morphological structures are adapted to this type of feeding. Consequently, buccal cavity and lingual structures of E. wahlbergi were examined by extended focus light microscopy (LM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Morphology of the tongue of E. wahlbergi was similar to that of other fruit- and nectar-feeding bats. The elongated tongue of these bats possessed filiform and conical papillae as mechanical papillae and fungiform and circumvallate papillae as gustatory papillae that varied in distribution. Epomophorus wahlbergi had five palatal ridges and one post-dental palatal ridge, and relatively wide, flattened molar teeth. A hard, papillae structure at the posterior end of the upper palate of the upper plate, which has not been previously described, was observed. It appears that this structure works together with the palatal ridges and teeth, so that the bats crush fleshy fruits during feeding and extract the juices before discarding the pulp. Consequently, lingual and particularly palatal structures of E. wahlbergi show morphological adaptations for efficiently feeding on fleshy fruit and nectar.","inCitations":["7b3222b04732ba4bc870ce29494f2abd8e5b66b4","79169ae44c9c16db89357b7b7a4947ee8777b2db"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Palatal and lingual adaptations for frugivory and nectarivory in the Wahlberg’s epauletted fruit bat (Epomophorus wahlbergi)","doi":"10.1007/s00435-012-0170-3","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00435-012-0170-3","venue":"Zoomorphology"}

Because there are a lot of theoretical arguments that support that female directors improve the companies’ performance, there are inconsistent empirical conclusion in recent research. Especially in European countries differ the empirical findings, while in US studies the findings appear to be consistent. This paper uses and compares data from listed companies on the S&P 100 and FTSE 100 in 2013. A two-stage least-square (2SLS) estimation will be applied to test if there is a positive impact of female directors on corporate performance. The sample shows that every company has at least one female director on the board. However the findings imply that there is no impact of gender diversity on corporate performance in that sample. It can be argued that there is no impact regardless of the geographically location of the company. This paper gives some suggestions for future research for this emerging topic.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://essay.utwente.nl/66198/1/Moser_IBA_SchoolofManagementandGovernance.pdf"],"title":"To what extent does gender diversity on a board of a company listed on the S&P 100 and FTSE 100 affect the firm's performance: A comparative study","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

In the U. S. S. R., in particular, there has been considerable attention paid to these problems, but workers in other countries have contributed occasional important studies. Since such reports form the basis on which we designed our program and since there has been no recent adequate account of them other than by Russian-speaking authors, we review briefly a selection of recent published work to illustrate the considerations involved. Much of the Russian work in the field has been summarized in papers given at the second Geneva Conference on the Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy (1-5). Most of the relevant studies mentioned in these papers concern changes in conditioned reflexes in various animals after whole-body or partial-body irradiation. For example, secretion of saliva in response to conditioned and unconditioned stimuli before and after whole-body irradiation with 250 r was studied by Fadeeva, Kurtsin, and Golovskii (quoted by Gorizontov, 4) in dogs with Pavlov stomachs; hypo- and hypersecretion were observed after irradiation, depending on the conditions. Yanson (quoted in 4) studied the increased rate of respiratory rhythm associated with a defensive conditioned reflex elicited in rabbits; he found that after 500 r to the whole body or to the head of the rabbit the rate fell sharply and remained low for some days. Many other such results are also referred to in the papers cited. Some studies have been made of the electrical activity of the higher nervous centers after irradiation. Lee et al. (6) stimulated the sciatic nerve of cats to evoke a cerebellar response which they recorded with electrodes touching the pia mater; the amplitude of the response began to diminish after a dose of about 6 kr had been given, and the effect was severe after 10 kr. The response continued to fall for 10 to 30 minutes after irradiation had ceased. Various changes after irradiation have also been reported in electroencephalograms (2, 7).","inCitations":["dd00679b6bd71b62fadc1cc7cfa0e3445e24e602"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Search for immediate effects of x-radiation on frog nerve-muscle preparations.","doi":"10.2307/3571044","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.2307/3571044","venue":"Radiation research"}

In the USA, they have quadrupled from 1999 to 2010. Opioid use among patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) over time is not well described. This study examined trends of opioid use in patients with RA. Retrospective prescription data was examined from 2005 to 2014 in a population-based incidence cohort of patients with RA by 1987 ACR criteria and comparable non-RA subjects. Differences in opioid use were examined with Poisson models. A total of 501 patients with RA (71 % female) and 532 non-RA subjects (70 % female) were included in the study. Total and chronic opioid use in 2014 was substantial in both cohorts 40 % RA vs 24 % non-RA and 12 % RA vs. 4 % non-RA, respectively. Opioid use increased by 19 % per year in both cohorts during the study period (95 % confidence interval [CI] 1.15, 1.25). Relative risk (RR) of chronic opiate use for RA patients compared to non-RA subjects was highest in adults aged 50–64 years (RR 2.82; 95 % CI 1.43–6.23). RA disease characteristics, biologic use at index, treated depression/fibromyalgia, education, and smoking status were not significantly associated with chronic opiate use. Over a third of patients with RA use opioids in some form, and in more than a tenth use is chronic. Use has increased in recent years. Patients aged 50–64 with RA use substantially more opioids than their non-RA counterparts.","inCitations":["9f8c2ab7a26b6652419bcdfde51be8fca96f1b17","8a107c690fc0e9a7798444f47315801e182d04ca","2c13f6faaf112d6b9da5df6e7abd5d259be7ee42","79690e06f384f7551b0eea0cfe30992554ac9bc3","e2e87ecdc60684fd930870a1e09fbc4bd26e7afd","93b947c88ccc6a77f7fa7f29cce3c9fe93b731d9","f5f24534c0197b333944d0df9aed913466b7bc5f","6e04cf4c4179dd903442185b44f7d1c723f2c835","ebbf09f92fb5c7766d7302a4bd49702ceb515b9d","49f6c978eaea7eba3a1e295095c7d11cc46dfb15","9721680a1a19adc792df81286f2677b7643f1dd0","55acb4e71d4329175d8495ba2adbb8b2c54a8b9f","cce17a1648eadc775db2d48dc4fa6b08381ec6f6","d5f28371ddde53a30e889afdbbbe7417a3389f0c","f3432bd870a715870be45793fc1592bd91937322"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Opioid use in patients with rheumatoid arthritis 2005–2014: a population-based comparative study","doi":"10.1007/s10067-016-3239-4","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10067-016-3239-4","venue":"Clinical Rheumatology"}

Various instances are known where the corresponding truncated sum ∑ k = 0 q − 1 c k x k , with q a power of a prime p, also admits a closed form representation when viewed modulo p. Such a representation for the truncated sum modulo p frequently bears a resemblance with the shape of C ( x ) , despite being typically proved through independent arguments. One of the simplest examples is the congruence ∑ k = 0 q − 1 ( 2 k k ) x k ≡ ( 1 − 4 x ) ( q − 1 ) / 2 ( mod p ) being a finite match for the well-known generating function ∑ k = 0 ∞ ( 2 k k ) x k = 1 / 1 − 4 x . We develop a method which allows one to directly infer the closed-form representation of the truncated sum from the closed form of the series for a significant class of series involving central binomial coefficients. In particular, we collect various known such series whose closed-form representation involves polylogarithms Li d ( x ) = ∑ k = 1 ∞ x k / k d , and after supplementing them with some new ones we obtain closed-forms modulo p for the corresponding truncated sums, in terms of finite polylogarithms £ d ( x ) = ∑ k = 1 p − 1 x k / k d .","inCitations":["11edfe6fd36c2d2a81202b5a81f30b78954e623e","5a0219902629578b5d4d128aadf822983732f981"],"pdfUrls":["http://eprints.lincoln.ac.uk/28782/1/Truncation.pdf","https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.02322v1.pdf"],"title":"From generating series to polynomial congruences","doi":"10.1016/j.jnt.2017.06.007","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jnt.2017.06.007","venue":""}

This paper presents a framework based on rate-distortion (RD) theory to analyze these multiple-decoding algorithms. By defining an appropriate distortion measure between an error pattern and an erasure pattern, the successful decoding condition, for a single errors-and-erasures decoding trial, becomes equivalent to distortion being less than a fixed threshold. Finding the best set of erasure patterns also turns into a covering problem that can be solved asymptotically by RD theory. Thus, the proposed approach can be used to understand the asymptotic performance-versus-complexity tradeoff of multiple errors-and-erasures decoding of RS codes. This initial result is also extended a few directions. The rate-distortion exponent (RDE) is computed to give more precise results for moderate blocklengths. Multiple trials of algebraic soft-decision (ASD) decoding are analyzed using this framework. Analytical and numerical computations of the RD and RDE functions are also presented. Finally, simulation results show that sets of erasure patterns designed using the proposed methods outperform other algorithms with the same number of decoding trials.","inCitations":["7766f6eda02db2b48c66335dcc4cf2055c4ed876","33b2817d6e559c262b5823b9e11383d846c6ae6e","9b5632633d0e32b5dbe5bc585d40423605f2084e"],"pdfUrls":["https://arxiv.org/pdf/1005.4461v3.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2010.2095202","http://arxiv.org/abs/1005.4461","http://people.tamu.edu/~phong.sy.nguyen/ita11talk.pdf"],"title":"On Multiple Decoding Attempts for Reed–Solomon Codes: A Rate-Distortion Approach","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2010.2095202","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2010.2095202","venue":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory"}

PDAC frequently presents at an advanced stage with extensive metastasis, which portends a poor prognosis. The known risk factors associated with PDAC include advanced age, smoking, long-standing chronic pancreatitis, obesity, and diabetes. Its association with genomic and somatic mutations is the most important factor for its aggressiveness. The most common gene mutations associated with PDAC include KRas2, p16, TP53, and Smad4. Among these, Smad4 mutation is relatively specific and its inactivation is found in more than 50% of invasive pancreatic adenocarcinomas. Smad4 is a member of the Smad family of signal transducers and acts as a central mediator of transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) signaling pathways. The TGF-β signaling pathway promotes many physiological processes, including cell growth, differentiation, proliferation, fibrosis, and scar formation. It also plays a major role in the development of tumors through induction of angiogenesis and immune suppression. In this review, we will discuss the molecular mechanism of TGF-β/Smad4 signaling in the pathogenesis of pancreatic adenocarcinoma and its clinical implication, particularly potential as a prognostic factor and a therapeutic target.","inCitations":["2adbc662424a9a01e0ad8cfa739da16dbcac20e6","38985233cb6d352c52f831536aa2960d64951aef","26497baf16a92858edf4eeeeaaa69538a808d3f0","e0bca6fefe4ffa19d0f87dde95eceb3984758c29","fd3b86529bae12aeda7418e966fa7754881cdd5d","87c28c3173cf6a4278125be1a332c82abf848427","ee430a92c237f055aaef29fbab99339c049516fc","73a9b01e46e79b25c464aed71cbae9b0ba84253c","ba750b21aa44d0f058abf8a7c17622be59c3c442","f0ffd27dae0d2f95cf85f12bed47611edf762d48","77d3c88ba1c2d2893ffdad96aa1446a06fd32a37","101a29672fbd582c9a5e7de63b5310f2dfcbf325","181d1e6708929d42f7e2c3522103833ad8160023","565411ca54ad4c28b1cd21931f566317e4bd017b","5ff49c628db72fdc444586ed66f817f3266b9a9b","5dd9add7525686feb6a4f6c1b6293b8b8fdd0fc2","dbc8e44c88187cb645b9dd97f0733c2ef72720db"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/6/1/5/pdf"],"title":"The TGF-β/Smad4 Signaling Pathway in Pancreatic Carcinogenesis and Its Clinical Significance","doi":"10.3390/jcm6010005","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm6010005","venue":"Journal of clinical medicine"}

Combining bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells and mild hypoxia (5% O 2 tension) in serum-free culture not only improves expansion but can also significantly enhance self-renewal of hematopoietic stem cells. Our findings contribute to the development of more efficient culture systems for the ex vivo expansion of cord blood hematopoietic stem cells for cellular therapy. Abstract: Cord blood (CB) is a rich source of hematopoietic stem cells (HSC). It has been used successfully to treat a variety of hematological and non-hematological disorders. Beside the advantages of CB, its main disadvantages are the limited number of stem cells available for transplantation and delayed engraftment. Identifying strategies to enhance expansion and self-renewal of HSCs can improve transplantation efficiency. The aim of this study was to examine different culture conditions on ex vivo expansion and homeobox protein Hox-B4 gene ( HOXB4 ) expression in cord blood CD34 + stem cells. Human cord blood CD34 + HSC were cultured in serum-free medium supplemented with cytokines with and without a feeder layer in normoxia (21% O 2 ) and mild hypoxia (5% O 2 ).At the end of 7 days of culture, the highest number of total nucleated cells (TNC), CD34 + cells, colony forming units (CFUs) and HOXB4  mRNA were observed in a co-culture of  HSC with a bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell(MSC) feeder layer at 5% O 2 .We concluded that the combination of  bone marrow (BM)-MSC and mild hypoxia (5% O 2 ) not only improved HSC expansion but also enhanced HOXB4 gene expression as a self-renewal marker of HSC, and better mimicked the niche microenvironment conditions. https://doi.org/10.2298/ABS171028003M Received: October 28, 2017; Revised: December 21, 2017; Accepted: January 14, 2018; Published online: January 26, 2018 How to cite this article: Mohammadali F, Abroun S, Atashi A.

In view of the need for an accurate, reproducible and inexpensive method for screening large numbers of farmworkers and others exposed to organophosphates, a manual commercial method was modified for use on an automated (centrifugal) chemistry analyser. The resultant procedure can be performed rapidly with a 24-fold cost-saving over the manual method. The volume of sample required is small, results of the automated and manual method showed excellent correlation and the reproducibility characteristics of the automated assay procedure was adequate for clinical use. Reference ranges were determined on children and adults. The results best fitted two reference ranges: children and adult females had a combined mean of 5,687 U/I with a lower (2,5 percentile) and upper (97,5 percentile) limit of 3,070 U/I and 8,483 U/I, respectively. The corresponding figures for adult men were 8,607 U/I (mean), 4,687 U/I and 9,116 U/I.

This viewpoint is reflected in the UK Government environment White Paper (1990) which states (para. 1.14) that ‘the starting point in this Government is the ethical imperative of stewardship which must underline all environmental policies’, and that ‘we have a moral duty to look after our planet and to hand it on in good order to future generations’. These principles are expressed in the term ‘sustainable development’: not sacrificing tomorrow’s development for an often illusory gain today. The Government considers that to achieve this end required the full integration of environmental considerations into economic policy, and that economic development and environmental protection need not be irrevocably opposing principles. Development provides the wealth to invest in cleaner methods of production and to husband natural resources.","inCitations":["5facce8e24160b672725d8f8a0113174289ecf7e"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Case study: the Government sector","doi":"10.1007/978-0-585-36577-0_14","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-0-585-36577-0_14","venue":""}

Failure to adjust and adapt in the early period of postpartum could lead to a more serious psychological disorders in the mothers as well as the fathers. Therefore, this study aimed to review the effectiveness of prenatal education as an early intervention toward postpartum adjustment and psychological well-being among the parents. Methods: An online electronic database searched was conducted and the relevant studies were selected and included based on the selection criteria. Result: Six studies were included in this review, however no consistent results were found in the studies. Three of the studies reported significant differences between the intervention and standard care groups. One of the study indicate a significant difference of the intervention in the prenatal period but no differences during the postpartum period. Studies which focused on specific psychological issues in the postpartum period would show a more significant result if the issues were presented during prenatal intervention. Conclusion: Prenatal education had different level of effectiveness in the postpartum adjustment and psychological well-being of a parent. The early intervention aimed at specific psychological issues during the postpartum period would yield a more effective result as compared to a more general postpartum adjustment issues. There were no standardized prenatal education program for the expecting parents but most of the studies structured the education programs according to their targeted needs of the study.","inCitations":["9ce6369367e5bb41cb02a9689a2c46c48a51defa","d707f8773b066ff5facad299d15e0d35a5fb8e9e"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Prenatal Education and Postpartum Well-being","doi":"10.4172/2376-127X.1000248","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.4172/2376-127X.1000248","venue":""}

Alternatively to traditional bottom-up approaches, which examine specific contaminants only, we present a top-down approach using a one-class support vector machine (SVM) trained on clean EMG and tested on artificially contaminated EMG. Both simulated and real EMG are used. Results are evaluated for each contaminant: 1) power line interference; 2) motion artifact; 3) ECG interference; 4) quantization noise; 5) analog-to-digital converter clipping; and 6) amplifier saturation, as a function of the level of signal contamination. Results show that different ranges of contamination can be detected in the EMG depending on the type of contaminant. At high levels of contamination, the SVM classifies all EMG signals as contaminated, whereas at low levels of contamination, it classifies the majority of EMG signals as contaminant free. A transition point for each contaminant is identified, where the classification accuracy drops and variance in classification increases. In some cases, contamination can be detected with the SVM when it is not visually discernible. This method is shown to be successful in detecting problems due to single contaminants but is generic to all forms of contamination in EMG.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://www.micansinfotech.com/matlab_doc/Automated_Biosignal_Quality_Analysis_for_Electromyography_Using_a_One-Class_Support_Vector_Machine.pdf"],"title":"PRICE LOW PRICE GUARANTEED Automated Biosignal Quality Analysis for Electromyography Using a One-Class Support Vector Machine","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Patients using oral therapy alone for it seldom achieve and maintain the recommended 7% HbA1c goal for glycemic control. However, the majority of patients with a longer duration of diabetes remain poorly controlled with oral agents, and use of insulin, which could improve glycemic control, is often long delayed and not aggressive enough. Glargine, a long-acting insulin analog with a more favourable 24-h time-action profile (no pronounced peak) than long- or intermediate-acting human insulin preparations, may be especially suited in this condition. AIMS: To compare the safety and efficacy of the long-acting analog insulin glargine and human premix insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes who were previously treated with oral hypoglycemic drugs alone but inadequately controlled. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: A total of 750 subjects with type 2 diabetes who were receiving oral hypoglycemic drugs for diabetes control were randomized to receive insulin glargine once daily (n = 370) or human premix insulin twice daily (n = 380) for 24 weeks in an open-label, tertiary centre study. Doses were adjusted systematically to obtain target fasting glucose < 100mg/dl. Outcomes included fasting blood sugar, HbA1c levels, change in weight and insulin dose from study start to end. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Qualitative variables were tested using Chi square test and p values were calculated between two groups. RESULTS: At the start of study, age range was 30-70 years, BMI was 26.48 +/- 6.3 kg/m (2) , and HbA1c was 11.9 +/-3.1%(mean +/- SD) for both group. The mean change (means ± SD) in HbA1c from baseline to end point was similar in the insulin glargine group (−3.0 ± 1.68%) and the human premix insulin group (−2.89 ± 1.79%) (P value =0.3861). The symptomatic hypoglycemic episodes were greater with human premix insulin than with glargine (significance level 0.00002).Subjects in the insulin glargine group experienced less weight gain than those in the premix human insulin group (0.4 vs. 1.4 kg, P < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with type 2 diabetes, once-daily bedtime insulin glargine is as effective as twice-daily human premix insulin in improving and maintaining glycemia control.

Influential experimental paradigms, such as the rubber hand illusion (RHI), in which a seen rubber hand is experienced as part of one's body when one's own unseen hand receives congruent tactile stimulation, have extensively examined the role of exteroceptive, multisensory integration on body ownership. However, remarkably, despite the more general current interest in the nature and role of interoception in emotion and consciousness, no study has investigated how the illusion may be affected by interoceptive bodily signals, such as affective touch. Here, we recruited 52 healthy, adult participants and we investigated for the first time, whether applying slow velocity, light tactile stimuli, known to elicit interoceptive feelings of pleasantness, would influence the illusion more than faster, emotionally-neutral, tactile stimuli. We also examined whether seeing another person's hand vs. a rubber hand would reduce the illusion in slow vs. fast stroking conditions, as interoceptive signals are used to represent one's own body from within and it is unclear how they would be integrated with visual signals from another person's hand. We found that slow velocity touch was perceived as more pleasant and it produced higher levels of subjective embodiment during the RHI compared with fast touch. Moreover, this effect applied irrespective of whether the seen hand was a rubber or a confederate's hand. These findings provide support for the idea that affective touch, and more generally interoception, may have a unique contribution to the sense of body ownership, and by implication to our embodied psychological \"self.\"","inCitations":["a4f4f35a02cc0a969656463184ca43fbc0ed7e0e","c9341376528603453d2e58de9077868687dc9255","8e8cb72cc2ee1a29d67df405c27e4071cffc4c30","6991ed7e9a904a10490a106ac07af076ba3e5a37","1b489552ce4d62f57f24d3c818fbad3428738d0a","ffb0ab8434dd5df62a659c44beaa6a56277a52fb","a277677fe5cb347693ef92ca71527c62c802de2f","ac7f55f8291f0c74da3ade9da2840fd3fa5a55b1","8fd8cf153d35268d690fb550ff0c18a0b28d7b08","31ad8065f61cb64c7ebc8742888f56879aebdd65","c74f7b623debe9b5ce15aa424f829111bc51d3fd","a650f89c02ff0911e322d838079cb91725e696e7","24e227afc155149aeae031bf7847f93d9ae3bc53","6f45e33ee345ad81c2367e207ae8ab04ec5ca4ef","43adcb1fe1c7afe70bfa06dcca677f6436860b90","3ab1725e12ac35b5dc198ad8966ab32056406990","6cc08172a5036ed252b2f7790484651e4f16b0dc","04df51b10b64acf2747d947c0860e4ab69c93f14","d1e1e1ae1d90558498e4312d07cc18b92769d8bc","1892d8564aac7604cf57aa3e77b7c8fe4e9e0154","c3518f441cc5d8a76bed858ed802eed337b696f4","2edab0aa51510067dc545088010c6ee43794bee4","cad43b05904f1b5eab89e8362309eda9e76798c0","e625c098cb447c1bfdec384bd24f73678ac1e6c3","aed9d6520524b4cfe5f7a14d41b58ebeccb91e94","c5a2ddbc95006c062392be02b135839b7c836469","a447e17118e331ef5288dd46a1af960a0b925ebb","d4e3a38285a95f95b6c77ee033db027571f648ab","728d4d4220733b2e72fba461479a1f9ea5fa4891","ac54c588ce6d80be448e707e240b1db9446ea20f","f8dacddb697143209033ccdd3bf056b4170799b3","22b6b0f5335fe4c828f7190405c9eb78a5ee599e","2d8489d9eb86ce1b5f1c49fecdec6f5caf372a35","5ed453eb787b88a1456aef1b8b4db8488e622034","e896ef706048ddd0b91e0534432906531c857902","37b263a47b21588535a7851574ef3c6e7dc99d42","2d7da8ca67ee3156cd6ded32151985aaf471a31e","47eea169d77d21148f5ef42dd5f5ffa514da6959","509bc5709ddd056a0b1ac6da5ca9387cea25f8b0","220e9764e09d5c6569db678750714ab3040cd66c","b76be2007355796806fd350e869f16ee6f6062df","906ca66e22dccf6cd6a8a7253ca9d2c1b136d341","bfe39ce6ac42541c0c66972b0374da8ab87bcdf5","69ab31cb04408fdb8ca122815dedfd394e17fcb2","7dcdabb99c2e2745e74ff5a7eadb4119b8f51798","f4119f4181feb1f94ccf3fafc2a64f53f55a60e9","94f3e3d233b53cd9ce87dd07488627e074cf50db","7f993949fee1796b68fb52f05ea267b044364cd8","f62ce8c225dc2cb1a1f77542d6183b3992bff043","926b32309b93e4e01b39cfc3736884eb7d6e4e1a","d737548e36eead819147c2134d728a6ae63b1aa3","bd62fddf6de7dcdd74fc22beba6c6be7970b0773","e74f14d87931354fc7475d18751989f465fdc70e","cc46f84f4309684ee5e5408c10305935694d313b","39a52c1e317b9fa18067dd8fabe1ec1ae3624907","443332b64b8cecd8af0531e8c596608e8f7375d3","2d0ad3f2a1a16c49e4fe9d669315a0ab78b64529"],"pdfUrls":["http://uhra.herts.ac.uk/bitstream/handle/2299/12220/JenkinsonBodily.pdf?sequence=2","http://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/1412511/1/fpsyg-04-00703.pdf","http://www.fotopoulou.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/1_Crucianelli_et_al_2013.pdf","http://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/pmc/2a/08/fpsyg-04-00703.PMC3792699.pdf"],"title":"Bodily pleasure matters: velocity of touch modulates body ownership during the rubber hand illusion","doi":"10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00703","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00703","venue":"Front.

This reagent, although probably a mixture of isomers, did not significantly penetrate the plasma membrane of human erythrocytes at concentrations below 5 mM at 37 degrees C. When allowed to react to completion, it irreversibly inhibited the uptake of 3-O-methylglucose, with a half-maximal response at about 1.5-2.0 mM-reagent. The rate of transport inactivation was a saturable function of the maltose-maleimide concentration. Studies of reaction kinetics and effects of known transport inhibitors demonstrated that irreversible reaction occurred on the exofacial outward-facing carrier, although not at a site involved in substrate binding. Reaction of intact erythrocytes with [14C]maltose-maleimide resulted in labelling of a broad band 4.5 protein of Mr (average) 45,000-66,000 in electrophoretic gels. This protein was very likely the hexose carrier, since its labelling was inhibited by cytochalasin B. Exofacial band 4.5 labelling was stoichiometric with respect to transport inhibition, yielding an estimated 300,000 carriers/cell. These results suggest that the exofacial sulphydryl which reacts with maltose-maleimide is distinct from the substrate binding site on the hexose carrier, but that it confers substantial labelling selectivity to impermeant maleimides. Additionally, the high efficiency of carrier labelling obtained with maltose-maleimide is useful in quantifying numbers of carriers in whole cells.","inCitations":["32cbc2554920612b2c600c60f9f87e593a4a95c3"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.biochemj.org/content/ppbiochemj/254/2/329.full.pdf"],"title":"Inhibition of hexose transport and labelling of the hexose carrier in human erythrocytes by an impermeant maleimide derivative of maltose.","doi":"10.1042/bj2540329","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1042/bj2540329","venue":"The Biochemical journal"}

Relevant radiocarbon data sets published\n\nto date, which were measured at different sites by different laboratories, were claimed to be incompatible. Therefore,\n\nthe question of agreement between laboratories and dating methods needs to be addressed at the outset of any study attempting\n\nto resolve such a tight chronological dilemma. This paper addresses results pertaining to this issue as part of a comprehensive\n\nattempt to date the early Iron Age in Israel based on many sites, employing different measuring techniques in 2\n\nlaboratories. The intercomparison results demonstrate that: a) the agreement between the 2 laboratories is well within the\n\nstandard in the 14C community and that no bias can be detected in either laboratory; and b) calculating the Iron I|IIa transition\n\nin 3 different ways (twice independently by the measurements obtained at the 2 labs and then by combining the dates of both)\n\nindicates that the lower chronology is the preferable one.","inCitations":["fcafe7e81e8bfeae447a5105050e13d0b91d8f86","165dd11faa30ca8c0557ff7064ac405746f6d785","dbde9e88b10fd6e94064dfb3b535a2d0e18c2cdf","3f43e11c2107a1cc1f372bbe82e8581e8a184293","81d18e0c89c35370e48ad32f4cdbcfdb5df2dced","6e93d088e265134ff641f1a8d0e856d5d3749e4e","e4330222e132186b6bf080bc521665ad797bae55","ee8fc62b5b67941c79182ecadfc24a086de99032","7d1496fbf1a8c26098fefed7895e1687f9183685","48bffeb59f2b91814ba99e29dbc7fd2e98c31f29","872abc609e228d2de355b93cf5ab24786bdcbc60","7f17dfb464981492541d761b8fd3581db64aee27","35ad8415a52cc8f81a01cab230d34a440aeff75a","c18359a550da06041962eda03c13a7d6385b415d","7ea9b1915072f2adff3762b59b7c7d79805fee8e","0e4a2e0f29f99bd4f49cd1c03d9f8b0a29caf2d8","5dbe0f1efbf39faa54355809d3f4e25538fb28a9","eef2b3d74e931565f26a173b8a617942837edf17","47ec32646ab9a8cb508d413d1b37c7a1ee188c62","ef2724266240f4d6fb9a02e070991831fb944bd9","de46c55ebf01d02478011ef3782ff40213739ef5","416ea9c1a98f170859565301470a640c7e9e77c0","386fde3d68befbee98edc2f301914db4282c1f20","5117e76307b75cfa70b933561ffbc72e64b1d950","f3788042ae2a36123b31c68c07daab2e29f258ea"],"pdfUrls":["https://journals.uair.arizona.edu/index.php/radiocarbon/article/download/2799/2564","https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/9E4A579AAABD63C763F465CE83B2EA71/S0033822200052188a.pdf/dating_the_iron_age_iii_transition_in_israel_first_intercomparison_results.pdf"],"title":"Dating the Iron Age I/ii Transition in Israel: First Intercomparison Results","doi":"10.1017/s0033822200052188","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1017/s0033822200052188","venue":""}

Strain HYL7-15(T) contained MK-7 as the predominant menaquinone and its DNA G+C content was 44.9 mol%. The major cellular fatty acids of the novel strain were iso-C(15:0) (16.49%), iso-C(17:0) 3-OH (10.96%) and summed feature 4 (comprising anteiso-C(17:1) B and/or iso-C(17:1) I, 18.46%).

It is also produced in smaller quantities in other tissues, including mammary gland (Le Provost et al. , 1994). The gene coding for prolactin is located in cattle on the chromosome pair 23. Togeth er with growth hormone (GH), PRL stimulates mamogenesis, lactogenesis and galactopoesis (Carsai et al. , 2010). The increasing of blood prolactin concentrations during pregnancy leads to increasing of lactogen tissue growth, correlated after birth with an increased mi lk yield. Therefore is a valuable candidate gene for improving milk production in cattle and ot her species. In cattle several polymorphisms were described in PRL gene. Among these a silent A-G substitution from PRL exon three gives rise to a polymorphic Rsa I site (Lewin et al. , 1992) having an effect on milk production, although the results are conflicti ng (Chung et al. , 1996; Chrenek et al. , 1999; Dybus, 2002). The aim of our study was to determine the allelic and genotypes frequencies in PRL-Rsa I 3 rd exon site, in a primitive cattle breed with very l ow milk production, as is Romanian Grey Steppe breed. The amplification was performed with the primers described by Dybus et al. (2005) and the thermal cycling conditions as descr ibed by Carsai et al. (2011).

The ratio of A:B-chains was best obtained by debranching of limit dextrins of the amylopectins. Although, an exact ratio was difficult to obtain without adjustments, the discrepancies were small and the ratio was not dependent on the original length of the chains. From the knowledge of the external chain length and the chain distribution of the φ,β-limit dextrins, the original distributions of A- and B-chains were traced and the chains were grouped into characteristic categories. Clustered chains were represented by a degree of polymerisation (DP) from 9 to 34. A-chains overlapped with ‘fingerprint’ B fp -chains (DP 15–20) and constituted probably building blocks inside clusters. The shortest A-chains (A fp ) at DP 6–8 and all long chains (DP≥35, including long A-chains present in PAPS) were amorphous. In a proposed two-directional backbone model, the clusters are connected to a backbone that extends in a (almost) perpendicular direction and is formed by the amorphous chains. The model makes it possible to construct a super-helical structure from a single amylopectin macromolecule.","inCitations":["431e8d50fde01cbf9cfefcb50854b373fe5a8d8a","950e8c4cbe34dc425f8322ecab575fdb95c04a44","81c5e48254d881935e40150173118602f3de98c3","c82d8e8c7c8c1d9aeb742a6acb1e894a741e80cb","c899e21aad41d477c9ccad5874d0d390d140e9d7","75433a0bc8f5a2c60cff2064e6e8dbea757511ed","bd87c30a71f1b2e6a1b22dc45ff7b05c6f04c364","49978a49ee42f6e302f4f47656b34ccd6c6c68a0","4b70218ed5d457453d22b29df2119b71e21525da","2aeed5993024e991fb68f2c49a723c000f69a49f","6e7ef45cbc1c61aac7f043ce9f74c959be6fa35d","822f4979a8657c574637fd1bb6918f8806833d69","e2c2738b19ca87263544676dfc99cbf6b85c6702","84644c02939008165fd2f250fe75b17461093367","37850a96016e2f95439c1f914180bde3b3e1bf11","7e503f0ec581bc715473442d25d3a5458c677e20","f15b854d25dfb296bafd7d6af05f7fa0d8e80966","cd9876516406009cbae6a14694c28d87b9cf70c7","6e3e6c9ebb6d74fdc56e7f954d71881a618b9b89","969b60a8b9f896cb81b076eaa164c8a4400c2e8d","fa33cf171d898749f5cf602f86d2c69e666592be","7aa14b43a0929e7c3950b1b7f91530c06e1d6577","eb9a40b45da7741dafd7dc2ff29979d6881c5da2","edde5ff61f0b613df2187a6e8b97a80cebb0d69f","87a3a6a859df45e8c272573a4a10e5c656bfedf9","6c2def21d00181f6eafd5ebf2c00d67d3abf538f","64646a81b6cd0225d7134d4c3f1b2e45c607b49e","3b9b1f35e44e1dbed0c06b6b0f964a956aa04391","99e492c3e9ed1ce2880b49ee0b5b506ec922523b","0461c1aa5e4021b2d362812fbb01322a50546725","85e258f0fe8b5e48cd5c3c8b42321c11902c39d9","7fcc614b6f9edafd32f311fff93806e447f78c81","7cf677d551f7b4ce99df932ace4df4ebe00ea07c","3b3c06a199072fcb4da6727e31beeb7b2722cf74","c79287e6134513d2c7fca071cb3f1c1a235164c6","0f142485cc2f83b4954e52f9058350206bb81320"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"On the nature of categories of chains in amylopectin and their connection to the super helix model","doi":"10.1016/j.carbpol.2004.04.015","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2004.04.015","venue":""}

In particular, she has concentrated on the period during which this type of art was born and has investigated the processes which, from the beginning of the 11th century onwards, led to the renewal of monumental sculpture in several regions. Having investigated previous methods of analysis, she has proposed a new way of looking at the chronological order of the first steps in this period, notably from the example of the exceptional workshop which created the abbey of Saint-Beno t-sur-Loire. Her study of the Corinthian capital and its multiple transformations came about from a greater understanding of the notion of the Renaissance of Antiquity, which recurs throughout the period. Other studies concentrate on the role of sculptural decoration in the buildings, as well as the genesis of certain forms of architectural structure. Much of this research has appeared in the form of monographic studies of important individual monuments. These nineteen studies are principally concerned with the Loire valley, the Berry, the Bourbonnais and Burgundy and they delineate the artistic landscape of those regions which were among the most precocious and the most inventive in the Capetian kingdom.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"L'art monumental de la France Romane : le XI siècle","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

The cells were purified up to 40 +/- 16% and transitional changes in immunophenotypic subpopulations in suspension culture were examined following stimulation with three different combinations of rh colony-stimulating factors (rhCSFs): 1) rhIL-3 alone, 2) rhIL-6, rhSCF, rhG-CSF, plus rhGM-CSF, and 3) the four CSFs plus rhIL-3. With all three CSF combinations, the total cells increased continuously after day 5 until day 14, and a combination of the five CSFs always gave rise to the highest number of total cells. Immunophenotypic analysis of the expanded cells showed that with all three CSF combinations CD34+ cells reached a maximal rate on day 5 and then decreased in an inverse correlation between the logarithm of CD34 positive rate and the duration of suspension culture. The maximum expansion of CD34+ cells and PB progenitor cells (PBPC) with rhIL-3 alone, the four CSFs, or the five CSFs was observed on day 5, 10, or 7, respectively. The combination of the five CSFs was identified as the most potent stimulus for expansion of PBPC and CD34+ cells, as it increased non-erythroid PBPC 89 +/- 69-fold, with a range of 24 to 204-fold on day 7. However, differences in the expansion rate of these cells on days 5, 7, and 10 were not statistically significant. The majority of purified CD34+ cells coexpressed CD38 (91 +/- 3%) but were negative for CD33 (85 +/- 4%), and one-half coexpressed CD13. With all three combinations of CSFs, the mature CD34+ cells that coexpressed CD38, CD33, or CD13 expanded in parallel with the total CD34+ cells, while an increase in relatively immature CD34+ cells, which do not express CD38, CD33, or CD13, was only statistically significant with the five CSFs. Thus, rhIL-3 played a critical role when combined with the four CSFs by increasing both mature and immature CD34+ cells.","inCitations":["d762ca298f2df7407339739e8b8069eb3659462a","44cd5290eb42c2be4295d713e5afc1cf61b44905"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Transitional changes in immunophenotypic subpopulations of human peripheral blood CD34+ cells expanded in vitro.","doi":"","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"Experimental hematology"}

Different weight ratios of CaSO4.2H2O bleaching agent relative to crude oil (2, 4, 5, 10, 20 and 30 wt. %) were prepared. One sample of raw crude without any bleaching agent added was isolated as a control. Each of the 7 crude oil samples were preheated at a temperature range of 80oC - 120oC.The different weight compositions of CaSO4.2H2O were added and the respective slurries agitated for 30minutes.The agitated slurry was then filtered. The experimental results for red color were recorded and % free fatty acids (ffa) and % bleachability were calculated. The results indicated that there was decrease in red color of crude oil from 14R-4.3R with increase in weight ratio of bleaching agent. There was also an increase in red color bleachability from 24.285 % - 60.714% with increase in weight ratio. % ffa and solid nonfat (SNF) remained constant at 0.56% and nil respectively. The results indicate that calcium sulphate dihydrate (CaSO4.2H2O) is an effective bleaching agent in bleaching of crude soya bean vegetable oil.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"The use of calcium sulphate dihydrate (CaSO4.2H2O) as a bleaching agent for crude soya bean vegetable oil","doi":"10.1016/j.promfg.2019.07.014","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.promfg.2019.07.014","venue":""}

This study uses 2010 Medicare and Medicaid data for HIV-positive Californians to examine how antiretroviral treatment (ART) relates to patient and provider characteristics. Logistic regressions isolated the effect of race/ethnicity on receipt of ART. Over 90% of the full sample received any ART. Nearly 80% of ART users received a recommended combination for at least half the year; half had a recommended combination for 90% of the year. Lacking evaluation and management visits, or seeing only providers with low HIV patient volume lowered the odds of receiving ART. Controlling for other factors, African Americans remained less likely to receive ART at all, or to be covered for 90% of the year with a recommended regimen. The observed racial treatment differentials may lead to important health disparities.","inCitations":["08b9507bf94803b90cf40faaa73dbc5972eafcfa","d3395f6b567c3b833f1ef8e7c7c94ccfb36b7378","4b6f5afc29b3c0588d9e92b95543926143d56d5e","85b20988c720c3a8e894829a46534c6681b132bb","5de8e7bb4b5501e7f5b3e7a389c25fecf26d7104"],"pdfUrls":["https://muse.jhu.edu/article/648769/pdf","http://muse.jhu.edu/article/648769/pdf"],"title":"Antiretroviral Therapy: Racial Disparities among Publicly Insured Californians with HIV","doi":"10.1353/hpu.2017.0031","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1353/hpu.2017.0031","venue":"Journal of health care for the poor and underserved"}

To test antibacterial and antifungal activity, the filtrate obtained by culturing Aspergillus candidus on malt extract broth for two weeks screened by using agar well diffusion method. The active ingredient was purified to yield white crystalline compound and identified using UV, FTIR, 1HNMR and EI-MS analyses. The MICs of antimicrobial properties of the purified compound were determined using microdilution broth method. The compound was also evaluated for its antioxidative activity using DPPH radical scavenging capacity assay. The cytotoxic effects of the compound on normal and carcinoma cell lines were assayed using 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide [MTT]. MTT reduction assay was also used to evaluate the antiviral activity against herpes simplex virus type 2. The 50% cytotoxic concentration (CC50) and the 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) were calculated by linear regression analysis. Likewise, ciprofloxacin, fluconazole, α-tocopherol, and acyclovir were used as positive controls of antibacterial, antifungal, antioxidative and antiherpetic activity, respectively. The active compound was identified as dihydroxymethyl pyranone. The compound had high antifungal activity against dermatophyte as well as other opportunistic fungi tested. Also, the compound was highly active against Candida albicans. The compound had antitumor activities against HEp-2 and HepG2 cancerous cells with IC50 of 7μg/ml. The most important finding that none of the examined dilutions showed cytotoxicity to normal cells. Compared to α-tocopherol, the isolated compound exhibited high antioxidative activity for the radical scavenging activity. The compound did not show antiherpetic activity with acceptable therapeutic indexes. In conclusion, this is the first report concerning the antimicrobial, antioxidant and antitumor activities of Aspergillus candidus. The result of this study illustrated that the dihydroxymethyl pyranone is a potential drug and a good candidate for further studies and development.

This exploratory study canvassed paediatric speech-language pathology services around Australia through an online survey of parents and compared reported service delivery to preferences, satisfaction, and external research evidence on recommended service delivery. Respondents were 154 parents with 192 children, living across a range of Australian locations and socio-economic status areas. Children had a range of speech and language disorders. A quarter of children waited over 6 months to receive initial assessment. Reported session type, frequency, and length were incongruent with both research recommendations and parents' wishes. Sixty per cent of parents were happy or very happy with their experiences, while 27% were unhappy. Qualitative responses revealed concerns such as; a lack of available, frequent, or local services, long waiting times, cut-off ages for eligibility, discharge processes, and an inability to afford private services. These findings challenge the profession to actively engage with E(3)BP including; being cognisant of evidence-based service delivery literature, keeping clients informed of service delivery policies, individualizing services, and exploring alternative service delivery methods.","inCitations":["250f0da195684faa02986fefea0abb913d8027b9","5d59174dd3680f4e3ce011e7bedee56d76e291ba","f5fa33a9e659a020bf9f9ade07ba2f1c1a55ff7a","ad43e3a3d1c9dcbf10f83efe36c3ea9f94503a94","b5582374e2878104bc178522a89feb08127a457f","f83b23b04566955a07cfc4b0606850e2c476ae21","4fe5b39fea282ad6830d7afd7add11831a6b2101","bd0284b4f014e5df4fe113cc3f028816cc98123b","314285bcf43f30f781551e2d66c80ae2b2ee4c9e","0933ae52b90514dbee4cddcb639f2acea6700efd","5ff394903c37ad9484dc39d43d6dde6efef2c47a","db8470eb5d0394fa7dba2ded3a8ea892b4729ee2","588e3177e80ea06a9769d1c6bc650ef8c817e7f6","a8510aa0c5ef25db6dbcb563b9c6dc61a7ed67ff","7f7cff5ee7caa7fd467716fed21d3660a2534af0","679e1812fc667b829b8825f7d895030b81b0774a","2b2d2dfc0b5d5d9c5a1aadf904f8de9192c03ba8","003aa6cfa66c3cbcb86b79f008af5830b6d44052","f58104acae4ee38c4c57e04af7d3ae990a64dd96","8ee2d391801e6a52be0f2c4682abd7fde53241a0","fe03216b2d025b8cd0c0d9aa226d84373ecc723a","a107fe9588dd25e12f75fafa3edddb9244cdbb23","804c5c16c7c6d3a647a0b6952d79b9ae5e81888e","7efdab815d56f56a742f5656bd2440393c1d2ed0","47026dd44f626c0eec17132d53e63eb4ea27c9e1","802f5bc692e9ca77476d757bb154a14a293c139e","994f878bea70c3665198d20246ca7b53772f3418","4386e6c34a3765e0f9644797d9bc43dadfc7d519"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.aph.gov.au/DocumentStore.ashx?id=0bfc46f9-525c-47e9-a4c4-dff7835f97b2&subId=32888"],"title":"Paediatric speech-language pathology service delivery: an exploratory survey of Australian parents.","doi":"10.3109/17549507.2011.650213","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.3109/17549507.2011.650213","venue":"International journal of speech-language pathology"}

Brachial arterial FMD after reactive hyperemia was assessed by ultrasonography. BPT was assessed using the microchannel method. In healthy controls, BPT significantly correlated with FMD (r = - 0.325, p <  0.05), HDL cholesterol (r = - 0.393, p <  0.05), body mass index (BMI; r = 0.530, p <  0.01), and plasma fibrinogen concentration (r = 0.335, p <  0.05). In a multivariate regression analysis adjusted for all clinical variables, BPT remained significantly associated with BMI and fibrinogen, but not with FMD, in healthy controls. In patients with coronary risk factors, BPT significantly correlated with FMD (r = - 0.331, p <  0.01), HDL cholesterol (r = - 0.241, p <  0.05), BMI (r = 0.290, p <  0.01), hematocrit (r = 0.422, p <  0.001), white blood cell count (r = 0.295, p <  0.01), platelet count (r = 0.204, p <  0.05), and insulin (r = 0.210, p <  0.05). In a multivariate regression analysis adjusted for all clinical variables, BPT remained strongly associated with FMD and hematocrit in patients with coronary risk factors. These data indicate that BPT is closely associated with FMD in patients with coronary risk factors and suggest that the measurement of blood rheology using the microchannel method may be useful in evaluating brachial arterial endothelial function as a marker of atherosclerosis in these patients.","inCitations":["7ce135221a61b2353ae292d83b220ad7a057ecc3","a163667950dbf5c1c757aa34ae52c0f1f695ded4","9239e17a5fddb6b005727cc3aa129f705383d52b","6416ba928544d5c4ff470d77a77fa8b598f98d10","131c820727aec586938f63db7e226cd672561f64","b3c78374b89b4ed926635d1c63210378b0c676e6","5d9be6edafd39a8188a50ef375e1a036af02c4b3","317ad4a0f4ea16cdc4cf1906c1d2aeeb2efa3fc9","742da36cf435f6fb0f875a675bc7c3ce79535019","e070e6fc48ba5817062e2510076e85751d44ee83","8240b76c3be1cdb45df46b022c7034d8c584b0a9","6df5fd5e083c1ac52370b53a8d425fec94cefed9","d5a36e04dc053517d608cc453bc0546bf0e96208","829c91c797dbc9aab478565387cca9eecb0d968c","8c568a1e32fb690ade1aa2c920f5ac22c1e0924b"],"pdfUrls":["https://gair.media.gunma-u.ac.jp/dspace/bitstream/10087/9852/2/%E5%AD%A6%E4%BD%8D%E8%AB%96%E6%96%871405%E5%89%AF%E8%AB%96%E6%96%87.pdf","http://content.iospress.com/download/clinical-hemorheology-and-microcirculation/ch1960?id=clinical-hemorheology-and-microcirculation/ch1960"],"title":"Impaired blood rheology is associated with endothelial dysfunction in patients with coronary risk factors","doi":"10.3233/CH-151960","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.3233/CH-151960","venue":"Clinical hemorheology and microcirculation"}
