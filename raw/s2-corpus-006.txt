Participants (>18 years, ≤65 years) with or without nocturia (controls) were included and completed a 72 hr FVC; osmolality and sodium excretion were analyzed on daytime and nighttime urine.\n\n\nRESULTS\n(1) Nocturia severity: Compared to controls (N = 38), those with ≥2 nocturia episodes (N = 29) have higher nocturnal voided volume (NVV) (P < 0.001) based on increased sodium excretion (P = 0.003) and lower functional bladder capacity (P < 0.001). Those with one nocturia episode (N = 21) present with lower bladder capacity (P = 0.005). (2) Gender: women with 1 and ≥2 episodes have lower bladder capacity than controls (P = 0.047 and P < 0.001, respectively). Men with ≥2 episodes present with increased NVV (P = 0.001) and decreased bladder capacity (P = 0.049). (3) Age: Younger participants (<44 years) with ≥2 nocturia episodes present with lower functional bladder capacity than controls (P < 0.001). Older participants (45-65 years) present with both increasing NVV and decreasing bladder capacity with increasing nocturia frequency (P < 0.001); sodium excretion is higher in those with ≥2 episodes (P = 0.029). (4) Causes: the percentage of isolated NP decreases (P = 0.005), whereas the combination of both causes increases with increase in number of nocturia episodes (P = 0.020).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe mismatch between functional bladder capacity and NVV with increasing nocturia frequency demands a comprehensive diagnostic approach to subtype the patient, which involves anamnesis, FVC, and analysis of daytime and nighttime urine.","inCitations":["94e342ed04017262aff0106a0961a1d42539b039","639a06d0c6beb57589775396a042e056a7bfd6a0","63d592ef971d708729d3d981863fd54c56cef7a8","10d306166e0a7e94ba825c7e1c90642f292f4e51","ad398eca24aab70e51173dccc8d247d5789953a1","27762222237ddb94f08ae90f36f5ebe306739704","5bab9f2d04777058c3929df69194ca344742f3da","015a7bcbb44574a6a16d93dc7b433ce28074acdd","fe9e997af1a9a3823d7cd02ac81f136f6a9ea249","18eee207cd13bde38b7625322010fcb574ea9cb4"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Exploring nocturia: gender, age, and causes.","doi":"10.1002/nau.22638","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1002/nau.22638","venue":"Neurourology and urodynamics"}

Some psychiatric symptoms are produced by thyroid illnesses and there isa frequent association of thyroid dysfunction with mood disorders. Therefore, routine thyroidfunction assessment in patients with mood disorders and the treatment of sub-clinical thyroiddysfunctions is recommended. The usefulness of adding thyroid hormones to antidepressivetreatment in euthyroid patients to obtain a potentiation effect has been probed repeatedly. Themost common strategy is potentiation with T3, but high doses of T4 have been also used in pa-tients with resistant depression. Thyroid hormones exert their action in the central nervous sys-tem through a variety of mechanisms: modulation of gene expression of several groups ofproteins, some of them with known physiopathological implications in mood disorders and theinfluence over serotonin and noradrenergic neurotransmission, known to be one of the modesof action of antidepressants. Finally, it is also important to stress the complex relationship be-tween psychiatric drugs, deiodinases and thyroid hormones, that can potentially help to under-stand the mechanisms of action of these drugs (Rev Med Chile 2004; 132: 1413-24).(","inCitations":["f45e52114b11462f8eea91c1e8dc18cf64bdad8a","018e470a22d4b645813dba59d8a085a5511ecc73","415922d4c8c6de16f35898bc7feac78ff789a3ea"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Trastornos del ánimo, psicofármacos y tiroides","doi":"10.4067/S0034-98872004001100012","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.4067/S0034-98872004001100012","venue":""}

OEE is simple and clear, and standards and guidelines have been developed. Nonetheless, literature indicates imperfections in applying OEE with regard to time base and rate efficiency. As literature lacks a basic framework for OEE, effectiveness has been approached systematically that resulted in a new equipment effectiveness E. The main difference between OEE and E concerns the choice of the time base. OEE does include equipment-independent conditions, such as lack of input items. This condition is not caused by the equipment but by the environment of the equipment. E has been defined to get a performance measure that is related to equipment-dependent states only, viz. effective state consisting of productive state, scheduled down state, and unscheduled down state. Because of the stand-alone condition, the equipment effectiveness expresses the (equipment) internal losses, while utilization expresses the external losses. By using E, equipment can be compared and improved. It can be concluded that the advantage of E over OEE is that real equipment effectiveness is measured as the influence of utilization (equipment-independent conditions) is eliminated.","inCitations":["b40eb716a9155c05f3e06e15e1a260b0ad176060","b87637a007945796f20f7bff22e24f2b717b6268","b1e089aa4bd9971e2b686513080145334148ff39","b610be92f913174db66828c7b593909215359bce","2ab30e0ab52a9b1796923766b850acfea183d30b","7724c196c754f6ee487e3a9f1950263bc89d2fd0","4b99868dcdf05802a20f65e7193180039fef21b7","b60045ab71af588763d2032cd96f64265ac1043e","cb78d771e82e613af01c6c8591e817e319627eea","a33374e170e1e3230991058cbf51409e42461700","5be7266df6e009e92acbd2c48977c826e9906802","704024a172e4bde2440481b3ab0f564b6c475208","c421b802d8531f35094cdf69b26d23755b05dbdd","07deafcec7e89a0389afaa4a82a3f560d9e0a828","69a18ee09ecdde44f47369ce911de3288268e126","318947540b9fe184e231618f5204d1a7e50311a9","a869c3a85128fe92b01acd151d1610d9c7ada1f2","365f41320cdad82c243c277c74c48fa191748b95","25d2483a6b03606dea6654af57b52176c912de85","8ed1cd050f5e42779aaf33dda0214426dddc3104","564fd1c67fe1dca99e3972756332fa17e1291a5e","a04758457c9a8c11d55f24ddebc6e061758b9cf2","16415d1dcac067d30bb6c979fa2b6235f8914d47","8542bf6a0cc49eda35c30ef599c8f287e8c37f46","6ddac0b5c7c318030b69b98724c27f4beea9a570","60d2f5dbe77619c8e8489a435925743d26642b1e","f3eab437d93c5df5433ce5aad088ea9fb79601d3","0cbe8dca969493f20c63c1d1642fb7e71355b3d2","14075d6624caabaff7928d4165437097c9f3187d","5adc613eca91c31e32c12af0e681307d8d0bb2cd","acac95300fc1a7ed4fce813eebf1eacb228ed003","b2e2a33b8ae1f091e614e32823f2a9f10878ba3f","379c7e2cee23f5acfdfa59cc9556d3f0bc356a29","69bfcdb695106429ccd12a78c9660ea13141220d","5319c2c6f1408350a4966daa696c81be57848072","1bb0e336bd56d91d766a95a4a2b0856d24f0468f","e760f6b07fc05f42da597372af1791f2c0c152c5","0b091384113812ea11b4b88afdf94372b6d30681","3258dc2eb69b699d85e67a659ad5698d54019985","ca011d6fed60a684a9650bc22914a2a540d463a1","118195c95a0014922e060e209892e624c942d5b0","d69445559ea6a8231d5c18f3820644fcc864247e","f9f71e0a9505e0a02d88974a6bc4d6f50f67864a","0c68fb9372c42f4a45d8d955f69df46002cdaa1e","74c3cd4a99fec76611ce48e1f1bc0c8b45c1842c","0323216461cead64e7935f19d9cbff18ca5730e0","6b10d71d17b1a847cd322820c9f925d26960a3b2","9980d498567aaddbf3fb0fbfba62477003050af9","8834b2f0650c39084f6fc1c0072039ac4684e89b","cc62b7905364827a236666b1d68f21d73192ee95","77b0c1fe905764a7385368f6cd2e87be8d510d07"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Equipment effectiveness: OEE revisited","doi":"10.1109/TSM.2004.836657","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSM.2004.836657","venue":"IEEE Transactions on Semiconductor Manufacturing"}

The profile of the safety factor, q, determines the mode separation of the resonant surfaces. The q profiles, the ratio of plasma pressure to magnetic energy, β, and the parallel current density to the magnetic field lines, μ, are studied with the varying aspect ratio, A. A new Mercier stable RFP plasma is proposed by introducing a finite surface toroidal current density at the plasma edge. The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of a finite surface toroidal current with a low-aspect-ratio (low A) on the profiles of q, μ, β and the ratio of plasma pressure to poloidal magnetic energy, β p . The investigation is performed using an equilibrium model with a finite pressure, in which unknown functions in the Grad-Shafranov (GS) equation are specified. Specified functions are composed of some numerical parameters that allow systematic variation of equilibria. The GS equation is solved in the toroidal coordinate for various A values, where the β limit of Mercier stable equilibria is determined. First we confirmed that q at the centre, q 0 , increases as A decreases. The result shows that the profiles of q, β and β p , strongly depend on A. The β and β p obtained decrease with decreasing A. In particular, the decrease in β differs from the case of a tokamak. The decrease in β is recovered, in spite of a low A, by setting the toroidal current to be finite at the plasma edge as a boundary condition.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Low-aspect-ratio reversed field pinch plasma equilibria with finite surface toroidal current density","doi":"10.1088/0741-3335/47/8/010","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1088/0741-3335%2F47%2F8%2F010","venue":""}

Simultaneously, a foreground is formed through the person’s interpretations of these possibilities, tendencies, propensities, obstructions, barriers, hindrances. A foreground is a fragmented, partial, and inconsistent constellation of bits and pieces of aspirations, hopes, and frustrations. It might be both promising and frightening; it is always being rebuilt and restructured. Foregrounds are multiple as one person might see very different possibilities; at the same time they are collective and established through processes of communication. In this article educational meaning is discussed in terms of relationships between the students’ foregrounds and activities in the classroom. I illustrate how students’ dreams might be kept in cages, and how this has implications for how they engage or do not engage in learning processes. I investigate how a foreground might be ruined, and in what sense a ruined foreground might turn into a learning obstacle. Finally, I discuss processes of inclusion and exclusion with reference to the notion of foreground.","inCitations":["1c2478678dc5333458537e674d0973f40ecedd9d","59a40331964ab0c004b75a6b8b456efbb9acbef7","ba4bc13604a3673d69c40bb38af2c6d5a3b903bd","536df6910949cfc0ce4926e3acc57f674d0c4ddb","5061483b6dbb5b26d20f7878b93d69bf1ff25eb4"],"pdfUrls":["http://pythagoras.org.za/index.php/pythagoras/article/viewFile/162/180"],"title":"Students’ foregrounds: Hope, despair, uncertainty","doi":"10.4102/pythagoras.v33i2.162","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.4102/pythagoras.v33i2.162","venue":""}

Electrochemical properties of the composites were characterized by cyclic voltammograms (CV), galvanostatic charge/discharge and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). At high discharge rates, the increase of specific capacitance of electrode material was primarily attributed to the improvement in wettability between electrode material and electrolyte, which came from the attached hydrophilic functional groups, resulting in rapid proton transport and more ion-accessible surface area.","inCitations":["9dcc41bcbcdeae5215ff010e7d449590079596d3"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Effect of chemical modification of graphite nanoplatelets on electrochemical performance of MnO2 electrodes","doi":"10.1007/s10854-009-9966-4","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10854-009-9966-4","venue":""}

This paper examines that claim in terms of the public management narratives that underlie the discourses of research policy at the European level.

Using an analytical framework based on three types of public administration narrative: New Public Management, Network Governance, and Neo-Weberian Bureaucracy, this article examines the ways in which the evaluation and distribution of research funds and the conflicting conceptualizations of the term excellence have moved EU policy towards a New Public Management narrative and a more divided Europe of Knowledge.","inCitations":["ea797243e1704c4a16b8090f43be3f6b5d5851db","98966565bcf6b40a9e82ba352934c75fcaea6b25","8df7aed19fea3db5cc6a56f0e8089405d76841e5","e5474581f14d3d43c69839bcc07a4ffb07c979b8","0e9b34b602e1726e77ee37c6cc71ee1f45881103","66a6d7c318bac8ff136984af96d500fcb738b1fa","4d927327e93b72a796e28ca8577a14266835fa23","59e0515d4aa9dacfc1d6dd03742ff65a70054d46"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.jcer.net/index.php/jcer/article/download/634/509"],"title":"Shifting Policy Narratives in Horizon 2020","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

These problems are computationally ve ry complex, thus it is preferable to use various approximate methods , leading to a good solution within an acceptable t ime. Methods: One of such method is the genetic algorithm mimicking the processes of evolution and natural selectio n in the nature. In this paper, the different variants of th e public transport lines layout are subjected to th e artificial selection. The essence of the proposed approach is a simplified me thod of calculating the value of the fit function f or a single individual, which brings relatively short computation time even for large jobs. Results : It was shown that despite the introduced simplifi cations the quality of the results is not worsened. Using the data obtained from KZK GOP (Communications Municipal Association of Upper Silesian Industrial Region) the des cribed algorithm was used to optimize the layout of the ne twork of bus lines located within the borders of Ka towice. Conclusion : The proposed algorithm was applied to a real, ver y complex network of public transportation and a possibility of a significant improvement of its e fficiency was indicated. The obtained results give hope that the presented model, after some improvements can be the basis of the scientific method, and in a consequen ce of a further development to find practical application.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://www.logforum.net/pdf/11_3_7_15.pdf"],"title":"The Design of the Public Transport Lines with the Use of the Fast Genetic Algorithm","doi":"10.17270/J.LOG.2015.3.7","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.17270/J.LOG.2015.3.7","venue":""}

Reactive oxygen formation correlated with AZQ-dependent production of single and double PM2 plasmid DNA strand breaks mediated by this system as detected by gel electrophoresis. Direct two-electron reduction of AZQ by purified rat liver NAD(P)H (quinone acceptor) oxidoreductase (QAO) was also associated with formation of AZQ semiquinone, superoxide anions, hydrogen peroxide, and hydroxyl radicals as detected by ESR spin trapping. Furthermore, PM2 plasmid DNA strand breaks were detected in the presence of this system. Plasmid DNA strand breakage was inhibited by dicumarol (49 +/- 5%), catalase (57 +/- 2.3%), SOD (42.2 +/- 3.6%) and ethanol (41.1 +/- 3.9%) showing QAO and reactive oxygen formation was involved in the PM2 plasmid DNA strand breaks observed. These results show that both one- and two-electron enzymatic reduction of AZQ give rise to formation of reactive oxygen species and DNA strand breaks. Autoxidation of the AZQ semiquinone and hydroquinone in the presence of molecular oxygen appears to be responsible for these processes. QAO appears to be involved in the metabolic activation of AZQ to free radical species. The cellular levels and distribution of this enzyme may play an important role in the response of tumor and normal cells to this antitumor agent.","inCitations":["dfa669336a6bf922a4c646ba49c0022663a29b20","87c71ec87c4574ca419cdc9afc9087972bf625e9","ac1dc2604db5a3f67a5bce7e960d9ae9a85e0aa3","2ab22595a7cc45f876614568fa62d15e0d0255a0","0a98e67a68671c4fb20e1deafc9c9f50cec73b7b","fdd93137c0b204e73a6b2da0ea6042bb47f41988","4e822688943c88be33eaebd028bcf98edffb7e26","b9cd10c3c19e45af8838728d1ae4d89a1185562e","09facd6e49fc44ca030e1fc8c2cca004dde05362","20da38d44fbac2b9684197bb7577c030c42e2d14"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Free radical formation and DNA strand breakage during metabolism of diaziquone by NAD(P)H quinone-acceptor oxidoreductase (DT-diaphorase) and NADPH cytochrome c reductase.","doi":"10.1016/0891-5849(91)90141-O","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/0891-5849%2891%2990141-O","venue":"Free radical biology & medicine"}

We have developed an osteoporosis case manager intervention. The case manager educated patients, arranged bone mineral density tests, provided prescriptions, and communicated with primary care physicians. The intervention was compared with usual care in a randomized controlled trial.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe recruited from all hospitals that participate in the Capital Health system (Alberta, Canada), including patients 50 years or older who had sustained a hip fracture and excluding those who were receiving osteoporosis treatment or who lived in a long-term care facility. Primary outcome was bisphosphonate therapy 6 months after fracture; secondary outcomes included bone mineral density testing, appropriate care (bone mineral density testing and treatment if bone mass was low), and intervention costs.\n\n\nRESULTS\nWe screened 2219 patients and allocated 220, as follows: 110 to the intervention group and 110 to the control group. Median age was 74 years, 60% were women, and 37% reported having had previous fractures. Six months after hip fracture, 56 patients in the intervention group (51%) were receiving bisphosphonate therapy compared with 24 patients in the control group (22%) (adjusted odds ratio, 4.7; 95% confidence interval, 2.4-8.9; P < .001). Bone mineral density tests were performed in 88 patients in the intervention group (80%) vs 32 patients in the control group (29%) (P < .001). Of the 120 patients who underwent bone mineral density testing, 25 (21%) had normal bone mass. Patients in the intervention group were more likely to receive appropriate care than were patients in the control group (67% vs 26%; P < .001).

To explore the magnitude of salinity and temperature anomalies and their generation processes, the authors studied the response of the Pacific Ocean to idealized EmP anomalies in the Tropics and subtropics using an ocean general circulation model developed at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Simulations showed that salinity anomalies generated by the anomalous EmP were spread throughout the Pacific basin by mean flow advection. This redistribution of salinity anomalies caused adjustments of basin-scale ocean currents, which further resulted in basin-scale temperature anomalies due to changes in heat advection caused by anomalous currents. In this study, the response of the Pacific Ocean to magnitudes and locations of anomalous EmP was linear. When forced with a positive EmP anomaly in the subtropical North (South) Pacific, a cooling occurred in the western North (South) Pacific, which extended to the tropical and South (North) Pacific, and a warming occurred in the eastern North (South) Pacific. When forced with a negative EmP anomaly in the tropical Pacific, a warming occurred in the tropical Pacific and western North and South Pacific and a cooling occurred in the eastern North Pacific near 30°N and the South Pacific near 30°S. The temperature changes (0.2°C) in the tropical Pacific were associated with changes in the South Equatorial Current. The temperature changes (0.8°C) in the subtropical North and South Pacific were associated with changes in the subtropical gyres. The temperature anomalies propagated from the tropical Pacific to the subtropical North and South Pacific via equatorial divergent Ekman flows and poleward western boundary currents, and they propagated from the subtropical North and South Pacific to the western tropical Pacific via equatorward-propagating coastal Kelvin waves and to the eastern tropical Pacific via eastward-propagating equatorial Kelvin waves. The time scale of temperature response was typically much longer than that of salinity response because of slow adjustment times of ocean circulations. These results imply that the slow response of ocean temperature due to anomalous EmP in the Tropics and subtropics may play an important role in the Pacific decadal variability.","inCitations":["209b3c659ddb76e835a62765692d597d7fe790d7","88b92ce98799f91a082eacc27f029f91f39bbe77","7ac306018797b76bf46545350b16e52b7fc465f9","e8996b5dc85953b27b30ced1388cc1e3a3fce852","c98cf9f772b7cf311d217c2537cf9d4fe2f4b373","18b96e6b272ae90de0b4fd29855f705bbf3477c1","87bec87098ad5aa5c16b54829ff837bda672c1f2","ff92f82f056cb2ac6c58764bb289c271a489370e","70eab7fac0e2a9abe0bd4aad6e249b79298587f1","dc53ccc383fdebbb740d82c6f8b6c776c74e7222","7a12994521798646d190c6bd404fa12d92190618","d3ba46793535237f359d7f69bf56392760972e4e"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Oceanic Response to Idealized Net Atmospheric Freshwater in the Pacific at the Decadal Time Scale","doi":"10.1175/JPO2820.1","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1175/JPO2820.1","venue":""}

Both enzymes were found to be more active than porcine pancreatic elastase. In the absence of Ca2+, laminin fragments produced by leucocyte elastase resembled those formed by the pancreatic enzyme but at physiological concentrations of Ca2+ cleavage by cathepsin G was much more selective. Initially laminin (900 kDa) was cleaved at two major sites only with similar rates leading to three fragments. Fragment C1-4 (about 550 kDa) comprises the intact three short arms of the molecule and fragment C8-9 (about 350 kDa) contains the entire triple-coiled region by which its three chains are assembled and the major part of the terminal globular domain of the long arm. The remaining C-terminal region of this domain was recovered as fragment C3 of about 50 kDa. Stabilization against proteolytic attack was restricted to the region of fragment C1-4 and only this fragment exhibited strong Ca2+ dependent self-association similar to that of intact laminin or of its complex with nidogen. The associative properties of fragment C1-4 were dramatically diminished upon removal of the tip of one of the short arms comprising fragment 4.

In China, almost half of all homes use solid fuel to meet their household energy demands. Gasifier cookstoves offer a potentially affordable, efficient, and low-polluting alternative to current solid fuel combustion technology, but pollutant emissions and energy efficiency performance of this class of stoves are poorly characterized. In this study, four Chinese gasifier cookstoves were evaluated for their pollutant emissions and efficiency using the internationally recognized water boiling test (WBT), version 4.1.2. WBT performance indicators included PM2.5, CO, and CO2 emissions and overall thermal efficiency. Laboratory investigation also included evaluation of pollutant emissions (PM2.5 and CO) under stove operating conditions designed to simulate common Chinese cooking practices. High power average overall thermal efficiencies ranged from 22 to 33%. High power average PM2.5 emissions ranged from 120 to 430 mg/MJ of useful energy, and CO emissions ranged from 1 to 30 g/MJ of useful energy. Compared with several widely disseminated \"improved\" cookstoves selected from the literature, on average, the four Chinese gasifier cookstoves had lower PM2.5 emissions and higher CO emissions. The recent International Organization for Standardization (ISO) International Workshop Agreement on tiered cookstove ranking was developed to help classify stove performance and identify the best-performing stoves. The results from this study highlight potential ways to further improve this approach. Medium power stove operation emitted nearly twice as much PM2.5 as was emitted during high power stove operation, and the lighting phase of a cooking event contributed 45% and 34% of total PM2.5 emissions (combined lighting and cooking). Future approaches to laboratory-based testing of advanced cookstoves could improve to include greater differentiation between different modes of stove operation, beyond those evaluated with the WBT.","inCitations":["2f82ff0a2a9122cdc25f88646ffb05da55bd0f29","1ac19a41077b09bfae2c12c8d32adf92166fe1d8","a5826b0af0ed862d572b8f05efe4d86b30bf7689","faba354e63250b03d1562c7297b306a22104bde6","49afd67dd0a870b7552677240282a47fae615a82","9334eb562821e2ed1ea6b993f1bb1f3c74a0e048","c492cdf3993d830ba15f10284baa373d32550128","269a5b914d1307e4fb5f8c597c410857f86e2473","12b1a7d1c694e5858ff302e3d39818e138baddd6","a18265598fd583b7dbc66a979cfb356758c05a12","c8380f23480fe26b91fc055f6795d42ec87e450e","2d294e45fb798f7dcbfb43193c257a6c3b9fa497","ea253090b22101b2a2093b6634904c5af4f067d4","5f371279b7585bd3ebb0800a609b7f305c878aed","29790cca12a3ee16ad7594ed944207a8ce07b5d7","f56ae432f097b42c2bdb5a66cb94f5c6d7854302","20ddf956f58e454e09b6f7f38b92064b86272746","0b906050516b88c5e38d712852bf36d36adb3dbb","6e2b80096c1cdf6847c6be950118b443e2906049","b429e76631553e0248e2de6f2e00b34cef6f92fe","a37ca5e3bbe9c696938ebe5fb28bbd1de1e76b5a","89ade0eadfe4f529eeb36ee7b2483415fb49260a","4b8fc5696d4fe4cb7efdfb542488cf9e4eb85270","3560379d10b6f1fd82f0a16b53ff7ab87fbf27b6","23984a0f442eedc0fb421f26453597b5b1177e01","c45710c3219ab88a55ffabb4203b7063cc3cb7bc","ea1e3708fb3987b3fc4766ce0c511f484387f77f","409d1453dee7b35a6d0bdac8d76ffe0d60336cf0","625d6b5609969b4789e804c89e4ac9c7eb3beb7c"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Pollutant emissions and energy efficiency of Chinese gasifier cooking stoves and implications for future intervention studies.","doi":"10.1021/es405723w","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1021/es405723w","venue":"Environmental science & technology"}

This novel synthetic method involved the transfer of TiO2 into the surface of LiMn2O4 with Vulcan XC-72 active carbon powders as a dispersant. The X-ray diffraction shows that spinel structure of materials does not change after the coating of TiO2. The electrochemical performance tests show that the initial discharge capacity of TiO2-modified LiMn2O4 is 111.5 mA h g−1, which is better than that of pristine LiMn2O4 (103.8 mA h g−1). The cyclic performance is significantly improved after surface modification. The TiO2-modified LiMn2O4 by a carrier transfer method exhibits better discharge capability and lower resistance.","inCitations":["38b67d1ca4f67ce6abe8efbe49361906b128ddf7","d77c4630c35363ca4d7582933ee33c84aa637f25","a06e515779dbda47decdabe8693eaf0f4e63984d","91df0925cdef86bb95fbb305d6a501a7275637da","d43eddec7418da640c57c3321f9bcf099c6a1b27","dade00be8095069ef52500515c729f231b84049b"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Preparation of TiO2-coated LiMn2O4 by carrier transfer method","doi":"10.1007/s11581-008-0290-4","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11581-008-0290-4","venue":""}

We also aimed to determine whether the percentage of weight loss over the course of treatment correlated with changes in positional alignment. Materials/Methods: Between 2005 and 2009, 124 patients with locally advanced head and neck cancer were treated at out our institution using IMRT with daily on-board imaging with megavoltage computed tomography (MVCT). The MVCT images were acquired over a longitudinal field of view that typically ranged from C7 to 2 cm superior to the base of skull using a coarse resolution in-slice thickness and nominal beam energy of 3.5 MV. After the MVCT images were reconstructed, they were fused with the treatment-planning CT images using automated registration bone presets and prepared for realignment if needed. These IGRT image sets were independently reviewed in the sagittal, coronal, and axial planes using the fusion split screen. We examined overall patient set-up shifts in the anterior-posterior (x), right-left (y), and superior-inferior (z) directions for IGRT, and the mean overall shift vector (MOSV) was subsequently calculated to be used as a measure of positional displacement. The percentage of weight loss during the entire course of treatment was determined from a retrospective review of patient records. The Pearson’s Correlation Coefficient, rho (r), was used to determine if a significant correlation existed between percentage weight loss and MOSV. Results: A total of 3,968 fractions were analyzed. The mean systematic alignment errors for all 124 patients were 0.5mm, 1.6mm, and 5.6mm in the x,- y-, z-dimensions with daily IGRT. The mean MOSV for all patients was 8.4mm with a standard deviation of 7.5mm. The mean percentage weight loss for all patients over the course of treatment was 7.2% with a standard deviation of 5.8%. When we compared MOSV to percent weight loss, we failed to detect any correlation between the two groups using the Pearson’s Correlation Coefficient (r=.05). The covariance (r^2) was determined to be 0.002. Conclusions: Although the benefits of daily IGRT have yet to be demonstrated with respect to the clinical endpoints of localregional control and overall survival for patients undergoing IMRT for head and neck cancer, this strategy appears to be a feasible and practical way of minimizing patient set-up error. Notably, the inability to identify any significant correlations between positionalshiftsasmeasuredwithdailyIGRTandvariousweightlossparameterssuggestthattherandomvariationobservedhascauses more complex than simple weight loss.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Long-term Single Institutional Experience with the Use of Daily Image-guided Radiotherapy (IGRT) for the Treatment of Head and Neck Cancer","doi":"10.1016/j.ijrobp.2009.07.1506","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijrobp.2009.07.1506","venue":""}

In addition to their hypolipidemic effects, chemoprotective properties have been attributed to statins as well. These effects involve multiple mechanisms, which, however, are not known in detail. The aim of our study was to assess in non-malignant as well as cancer cells the impact of simvastatin on the amount of cytosolic lipid droplets (LDs) implicated in many biological processes including proliferation, inflammation, carcinogenesis, apoptosis, necrosis or growth arrest.MethodsHuman embryonic kidney cells HEK-293T and human pancreatic cancer cells MiaPaCa-2 were treated with simvastatin (6 and 12 μM) for 24 and 48 hours respectively. Neutral lipid probe Nile Red was used for detection of LDs by fluorescence microscopy. Cellular cholesterol content was determined by HPLC. Changes in expression of genes related to lipid metabolism in simvastatin-treated MiaPaCa-2 cells were examined by DNA microarray analysis. Validation of gene expression changes was performed using quantitative RT-PCR.ResultsThe treatment of the cells with simvastatin increased their intracellular content of LDs in both non-malignant as well as cancer cells, partially due to the uptake of cholesterol and triacylglyceroles from medium; but in particular, due to enhanced synthesis of triacylglyceroles as proved by significant overexpression of genes related to de novo synthesis of triacylglyceroles and phospholipids. In addition, simvastatin also markedly influenced expression of genes directly affecting cell proliferation and signaling.ConclusionsSimvastatin treatment led to accumulation of cytosolic LDs within the examined cells, a phenomenon which might contribute to the antiproliferative effects of statins.","inCitations":["92b04611c4ff062b66e674498543fd1d48f7b330","abe87caa2028402d58722d75b55063afd92de54e","fb511149b35287296710261c6689c5bfc526c864","13898850eecc73331fe8be2a8e8024b8c805e66a","55dd9f34262ac118a237518bf56c2d706b9039b1","5d8958c0da70cb165d8377e0119390140a269942","bcb077f134bb4b7df1a98d9ad6a8bc0ed5c3d6af","70e27fde26fc54dd0fa46eafc43e33315b04b835","11d4133d361a9b7608e9bc06eedb0c1f76323091","16f14f858285aa9694f7bf755a56e74c6e35509b","cf06ef0dc63fcbbd09b5023a83f697aa0bd040c8","f7178b30b31402ee3f6b9a874446fbf42cc1a3ad","568d9005b0f12c694e5344719bd5cca350b636bb","9c580f207810ceb434c36c33b86cf81c5d3ed9d4"],"pdfUrls":["http://download-redirector.springer.com/redirect?contentType=pdf&ddsId=art:10.1186/1476-511X-12-126&originUrl=http://lipidworld.biomedcentral.com/article/10.1186/1476-511X-12-126"],"title":"The effect of simvastatin on lipid droplets accumulation in human embryonic kidney cells and pancreatic cancer cells","doi":"10.1186/1476-511X-12-126","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1476-511X-12-126","venue":"Lipids in Health and Disease"}

The antibody showed high cross-reactivity with dihydrostreptomycin in various foodstuffs (buffer 103%, milk 96%, honey 84%, kidney extract 129% and muscle extract 98%). There was no significant cross-reaction with other aminoglycosides or commonly used antibiotics. A streptomycin derivative was used to prepare a stable, reusable sensor chip surface. The assay allowed the direct analysis of bovine whole milk (fat content approximately 3.5%). Honey samples required dilution with buffer, while kidney and muscle samples from pigs were homogenized in an aqueous extraction buffer and clarified by centrifugation. The limit of detection for each assay was determined from known streptomycin-free samples (n = 20; mean - (3 x standard deviation)) and the results were as follows: milk 30 microg kg(-1), honey 15 microg kg(-1), kidney 50 microg kg(-1) and muscle 70 microg kg(-1). Repeatability (or relative standard deviation) between runs were calculated (n = 3) at the respective Community maximum residue limits (MRL) and 0.5 x MRL with the exception of honey since no European MRL exists at present. Results were determined as 4.3% (200 microg kg(-1)) and 2.8% (100 microg kg(-1)) in milk, 13.3% (40 microg kg(-1)) and 9.5% (20 microg kg(-1)) in honey, 7.1% (1000 microg kg(-1)) and 7.6% (500 microg kg(-1)) in kidney and 7.1% (500 microg kg(-1)) and 11% (250 microg kg(-1)) in muscle.","inCitations":["473decd70549892d1057b1999bfe7b90ac7d9b6b","8e7f160faeda12b34ffab224c92e2576c1041d37","d5577c42a6e5fe868392fa5bf751ebff554a6811","9969aab31444d0cd5ad78a9e3c4b6a01fc541ee2","a6ce457b2b58e5aadadcb514283dab9fab85fa1c","20a0fb58f48e3fa1ecb6c935d1f68d3d0ae6cf71","1a2dd3262e298806f406c12c5e81fe22e4294a73","b204bbfb1190d1eb4c8256deb822744b72b72be9","3c3fd3b94d66073cd177fb53be0b836ca9a7dded","7ac4bfb0b6782c119cd546b288fbe12009b5712c","b91d1c88ceb70fa83752147c7ec381cf44e5c228","c75218c1610f5c67ef8c1c45bcbe990d42ef991a","beadf9ea31b351c6f51ad32493f854cfe470a9ac","e16572e6e9114b0e1be6d3515ffadb2fe472854f","c7002e5f22fee7037c8b9ef1ba8a39f15526c46f","aed25c6faa708bc2c73daa6f5fb19d2544430f35","3cb025131cdb49c4922a0b8faa6353f203f9feed","a94e10012ef905e938d8b9bef1739d1288f3a673","ffdbc14f13dafa3fde765383040c5a4097caa757","5fbdc717cc06376ba5a5998d83e7ae03bbddc66e","a897612cefe30f2326f77497dd10ebcc65cb5d25","1ecd9785f8869ebb879f263cb72fdc67cc829688","e36aaf40858a012af459e97ed1510b7be7d76ea7","942abf3676308f65cb4330f88850896bda4e6e3a","176d6a1f776090047c04828217ed1bf5a0a65f23","b12e8083a430710b96e60ac1bad9781fbe0469c4","8c264cb39f47013f42f37e0ff8086fd99fc169a2","8c5b760122cd95573d65130d066bd4074c2b0a4f","2d6868ef25c6d82790cf5fa4d78eee2e6956fcce","03fd02481c1bbe9422d26c993b9f6c96e50e8248","a324fb4771cc55c46a50a78ee45e5375063c35f6","34c5d9076a660cb11f1a53a5b827169e799f1c23","eff0bfaccbba02dcf3442088c2d73fe4578673cb","76b3117ec4bcc97b34c3cbc3a69f557568e00aa0","f5ef7b1bd01a20dacfd9bd42da51192afee55a29","e286eedbabf34a003a3086f2687b86f22ffdd2e5","a39c1b132a860fbc20248a6b9ceac7ac17c7d582"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Detection of streptomycin and dihydrostreptomycin residues in milk, honey and meat samples using an optical biosensor.","doi":"10.1039/B200757F","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1039/B200757F","venue":"The Analyst"}

The genetic components of this remain unidentified. Linkage studies have demonstrated susceptibility locus for primary strabismus at the STBMS1 locus on 7p22.1 as well as other loci on 4q28.3 and 7q31.2. Recently next generation sequencing (NGS) technology has emerged as a powerful tool in discovery genomics and a large number of novel disease-causing variants are being reported. In this study, we recruited informative families for subsequent genetic analysis for disease-causing variant identification.\n\n\nMETHODS\nAll consecutive families with two or more affected members with primary concomitant horizontal strabismus were prospectively recruited at the ophthalmic outpatients department (OPD) of Lady Hardinge Medical College, New Delhi, from August 2014 to February 2017. Detailed phenotypic evaluation and pedigree documentation was performed.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOf the 39 recruited families of north Indian origin, 18 families each had affected family members demonstrating either ET or XT. 100% concordance of the phenotype in the affected family members was observed in these families. While vertical transmission was observed in 17/18 families with XT, 7 with ET had affected members across one generation, 2 demonstrated consanguineous pedigree, and 2 comprised identical twin families. In 3 families, a combination of ET and XT was noted. This comprised one family with the ET and XT patients being from 2 separate arms of the family related by marriage, one family where one sibling had XT and the other had ET, and another family where the maternal aunt of the affected proband with ET had XT.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nSubjects with familial primary concomitant strabismus recruited in this study may provide a valuable resource to unravel the genetic determinants of this condition, which is a common disorder of early childhood with high ophthalmic morbidity.","inCitations":["e5e08ffe71b484ba8941144211a3be5dc6a0b90b"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Pedigree Analysis of Familial Primary Concomitant Horizontal Strabismus in Northern India.","doi":"10.1080/09273972.2017.1350865","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1080/09273972.2017.1350865","venue":"Strabismus"}

In particular, the history of the commercial fishing of dugongs and marine turtles has received comparatively little scholarly attention. Since European settlement in Queensland, various human activities have exploited these resources. We present documentary and oral history evidence of the scale of those industries. Based on extensive archival and oral history research, we argue that diverse fishing practices occurred and that the sustained exploitation of dugongs, green turtles, and hawksbill turtles led to observable declines in the numbers of these animals - now species of conservation concern.

World Health Organization (WHO) criteria for screening anemia (2001) was used, and the proportion rates of mild, moderate and severe were analyzed. The nutritional status was defined according to the growth references of body mass index (BMI)-for-age z-score for 5-19 years developed by the WHO. Stepwise Logistic regression was used to assess the association between anemia and nutritional status, gender, urban/rural areas, age and ethnic minorities.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe prevalences of anemia were 4.4%, 26.4%, 6.6% and 5.8% in Mongolian, Hui, Zhuang and Korean students, respectively, of whom, the prevalence of anemia was highest in rural girls and reached 4.8%, 42.0%, 9.0% and 6.7%, respectively. Most of the ethnic minorities' students belonged to mild anemia, and the prevalence of severe anemia was 1.4%, 12.9%, 1.6% and 1.9% in Mongolian, Hui, Zhuang and Korean students, respectively. Stepwise Logistic regression showed that the girls, rural students, students aged 12 years and 17 years, Hui, Zhuang and Korean students were more likely to develop anemia than the boys, urban students, students aged 7 years and Mongolian students. The overweight students were less likely to develop anemia compared with the normal students and there was no significant association between anemia and thinness or obesity when the other factors were controlled (P>0.05).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe epidemic of anemia was different in the different ethnic minorities and the prevalence of anemia in Hui students was of moderate public health concern according to the WHO's criteria. We should pay more attention to the prevention and treatment of anemia for Hui and ethnic minorities in rural areas, especially for rural girls. The nutritional status of students could not be a basis or judgement for anemia as there was no significant association between anemia and nutritional status.","inCitations":["eec00edd4fe1e3e65e8df4cdfcf67e9179b981d1","2165fc7cda5cd2d34d4ad67edd2335ac89de3375"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"[Prevalence of anemia and its association with nutritional status among Chinese students of ethnic minorities in 2010].","doi":"","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"Beijing da xue xue bao.

Against the background of a possible language shift, this study focuses on how the symbolic value of language is mediated in the social action of the Ngoni. With an ethnographic approach and by using nexus analysis and ethnolinguistic identity theory as a framework, this article shows that the Ngoni language is the strongest bearer of Ngoni identity. Even though the Ngoni have a monolingual norm, they code-switch. This practice, moulded by history, ideologies and large-scale discourses at the societal level, reflects a hybrid identity, formed by socio-political power structures. The analysis shows that the ethnolinguistic identity of the Ngoni is weak, resulting in unstable bilingualism. Therefore, the findings fuel the discussion of possible future language loss.","inCitations":["468c3d9ee26199cc756e853922d454a7deb2ce31"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Identity Construction and Norms of Practice among Bilingual Ngoni in Rural Tanzania","doi":"10.1080/10228195.2017.1367956","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1080/10228195.2017.1367956","venue":""}

This paper proposes a much simpler modeling method by using a generalized average model of high-Q resonators, which are common components in WPT systems. The proposed method can be easily adopted in systems with various topologies. A pulse density modulated WPT system is modeled as an example. The derived system model includes not only the resonant tanks but also the power converters, and is expressed by a lower order model with more concise formulae as compared to existing dynamical models.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Modeling the dynamics of wireless power transfer using a generalized average model of high-Q resonators","doi":"10.1109/apec.2018.8341547","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/apec.2018.8341547","venue":"2018 IEEE Applied Power Electronics Conference and Exposition (APEC)"}
