There is increasing evidence that genetic alterations might play an important but underestimated role. Current knowledge of the genetic base of Hirschsprung's disease in contrast is far more detailed. The two enteric neuropathies have several clinical features in common. This association may also exist on a cellular and molecular level. The aim of this review is to enlighten those etiopathogenetic concepts of Hirschsprung's disease that seem to be useful in uncovering the pathological processes causing achalasia. Three aspects are looked at: (i) the genetic base of Hirschsprung's disease, particularly its major susceptibility gene rearranged during transfection and its potential reference to achalasia; (ii) the altered motor functions in both conditions with loss of inhibitory innervation and interstitial cell pathology; and (iii) the involvement of these motility disorders in genetic syndromes.","inCitations":["a5bd01905a138ce13ad0a12e928d07358d652899","e6253980933a309eadd4414807f96921f7ec05b5","2b0102ba47c910c0472e8f61db19de01f1632ac1","661e8c231906d2a468780070f25923eb14569c8f"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Etiopathological aspects of achalasia: lessons learned with Hirschsprung's disease.","doi":"10.1111/j.1442-2050.2011.01277.x","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1442-2050.2011.01277.x","venue":"Diseases of the esophagus : official journal of the International Society for Diseases of the Esophagus"}

Side effects of methadone treatment may be potential obstacles to its continuation. Sleep quality and sexual function are two culture-based concerns, directly related to patients' compliance with methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) program. This research was conducted to examine the frequency of sleep disparity and sexual dysfunction in patients under MMT referring to MMT clinics of Kerman, Iran. Methods In this cross-sectional study, 198 adult subjects under MMT for more than 6months were enrolled. Measurement tool consisted of Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Arizona Sexual Experience Scale (ASEX), the 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12), and a demographic questionnaire. The questionnaires were self-completed, except where individuals were illiterate. Results Mean±SD age of the subjects was 41.2±7.9years and 93.4% of them were male. More than half of them used heroin. Prevalence of poor sleeping and sexual dysfunction in patients under MMT were 67.7% and 18.2%, respectively. There was no association between sleep quality and sexual dysfunction and demographics or methadone dose. However, a significant correlation was observed between mental health and sleep quality ( r =0.16, P =0.033), and sexual function ( r =0.18, P =0.011). Conclusions Sleep quality showed a poorer profile than sexual function. Therefore, more emphasis should be laid on treatment of sleep disparity during follow up of MMT patients comparing to their sexual function. Patients should be reassured that probable sexual dysfunctions should not be regarded as a consequence of MMT.","inCitations":["1ff249141506666d0c410719a2cc46b4f810fb7e","6e4268097b688bf76d5ded53b7144dcb507f0581","07950f079183a67b88aaa4ed2f6bb015b484ca2b","8bdfe40cdfc38399558c61a9aad623ad4eed567b"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Sleep Quality and Sexual Function in Patients Under Methadone Maintenance Treatment","doi":"10.1016/j.eurpsy.2016.01.125","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eurpsy.2016.01.125","venue":"International Journal of High Risk Behaviors & Addiction"}

A central argument is that stereotypes of black women were highly gendered and clustered around contradictory representations, particularly the ‘Sable Venus’, ‘She Devil’ and passive ‘drudge’. Thus, the persistence of an African-centred ‘woman's culture’ and strategies of resistance, collaboration and survival are vital to understanding black women's self-defined (as opposed to white attributed) identities. The first section examines the relationship between gender, race and culture in the mediation of African and slave women's identities.

In view of the conventional chemotherapeutic drugs with many restrictions such as nonspecific systemic toxicity, short half-life and low concentration in the tumour sites, stimuli-responsive DDSs can deliver anti-tumour drugs targeting to the specific sites of tumours. Owing to precise stimuli response, stimuli-responsive DDSs can control drug release, so as to improve the curative effects, reduce the damage of normal tissues and organs, and decrease the side effects of traditional anticancer drugs. At present, according to the physicochemical properties and structures of nanomaterials, they can be divided into three categories: (1) endogenous stimuli-responsive materials, including pH, enzyme and redox responsive materials; (2) exogenous stimuli-responsive materials, such as temperature, light, ultrasound and magnetic field responsive materials; (3) multi-stimuli responsive materials. This review mainly focuses on the researches and developments of these novel stimuli-responsive DDSs based on above-mentioned nanomaterials and their clinical applications.","inCitations":["74e6dc4bffd13aa21f2be973bbeeafb6f75da6ab","853d85756ed0c44b5c9a966ef74dcf5b423a6517"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Stimuli-responsive nanoscale drug delivery systems for cancer therapy.","doi":"10.1080/1061186X.2018.1519029","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1080/1061186X.2018.1519029","venue":"Journal of drug targeting"}

The economic analysis was designed and carried out in the hospital perspective. End-points were: Ejection fraction, New York Heart Association (NYHA) class, no. of hospitalizations in Cardiology Ward and ICU (Intensive Care Unit), Days of hospitalization in Cardiology Ward and ICU, no. of clinic visits (outpatients), no. of day-hospital visits, no. of days free from acute events requiring hospitalization or clinic visits, health care costs.ResultsIn the 12 months following biventricular pacing, patients showed: a reduction in functional NYHA class (3.0 ± 0.3 vs 2.1 ± 0.3); a reduction in cardiovascular related hospital stays (from 42.0 ± 37.5 days to 2.8 ± 6.4); an increase in number of days free from acute events (from 104 ± 123 to 266 ± 137). Overall costs decreased from € 383,518 to € 289,890 (with implant costs) and to € 58,549 (without implant costs). In-hospital stays in Cardiology and Coronary Unit decreased by 93% and 95%, respectively.ConclusionsBiventricular pacing in heart failure patients represents an efficient approach in the hospital perspective and allows a less intensive use of clinical resources. Even if other non-hospital-sustained costs are not taken into consideration, it seems reasonable to deduce that the significant improvement in patient’s clinical condition after implantation will provide a considerable reduction of total costs also in a broader perspective.","inCitations":["cdbf29b3ad5649b4eaf24ddb4bb4b88cceeb47cf"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Valutazione economica della resincronizzazione cardiaca nei pazienti affetti da scompenso cardiaco moderato-avanzato","doi":"10.1007/BF03320600","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/BF03320600","venue":""}

In this simple model an Ekman transport layer is induced by a wind-driven shear friction profile to force the coastal ocean. An analytical perturbation solution, including a component of internal Kelvin waves, is solved for the coastal upwelling system with weak alongshore-varying topography. Under uniformly upwelling favorable winds, the model solutions show that alongshore-varying topography leads to the formation of upwelling centers along the coast by increasing upwelling on the downslope sides of topographic highs and decreasing upwelling on the upslope sides of topographic highs, similar to the observed features off the New Jersey coast during summer seasons. A conservation theorem is derived that indicates the topographic variation does not change the total amount of upwelled water but redistributes it unevenly along the coast to form enhanced upwelling centers. The theory suggests that alongshore-varying topography plays an important role in controlling the formation of upwelling centers as it enhances upwelling at some locations and induces downwelling at others. In addition, the variations of the upwelling fronts are further complicated by the topographically trapped Kelvin waves.","inCitations":["4034d7ae7d8681bc8aebf20cf725ccc5a280f2a0","d45686750c69d643ac823ee1626b1fa76f4c8194","57d5db12941779b5554487f9a0636f81a5a20e71","d2d97843545e0033b054626163c33b7bc0e66a9e","f1fb34c77f1004c3bdeffaa3338079efb145a34a","bcca03e0b08e44ca11dae716e1a21a9d00e0554c","ee924e0a25473b5872410ff904ba7394e4ad636d","391ee055c12bda5219ba7f07a68141cc24e0c793","bdee42a84f476409669e8f37bc11b0ce72f03bde","cf4471bc803e5e4c8c8fd81293e2c7cba00d7c02","18962496afffe98296fc58374e2b3767bc51cfad","01b6d48daa7a9bc6727b93efbba62025816372c7","ee7a7514db544f8c4b4bcc465270e2d70b152a3d","fe35d788ecfd99f39e619f5dc96f256472c14c82","a9ba06b3ed8001c9eb995b50b175147e2ed6a433","1a7b9e633e67b7c206e195898e01f5fade601c5f","eb8005c3de38e4ac0243d07707d4f39d1206b56b","89c483c29e27f4e4e6669034d04f67662f7b04f9","0a35dc11b7e1d5e0e999947cbe65230cfc533d0d","dbe960a6bafba287667f0d4876b7113e8bb5ce52","e59e7ab85c033c5e4b5ea81fb48b12a83eae6a78","7bd6a1c86c44ad09adb435652b091441923fd79e","c183ab05a5489acac8622a54efa43ecf3858ba5c","629c902ed832008a05054f1114aefd88bda5a704","e3e89592548f3983fca5d648f1a56acc5ebf454a","830eee6e15e1c2db78a744e5bf72ec5c26173281","ea6c8a73f1eb3d200a6ce9569d34b0162c35686a","958ef4e3d9392168c916868c20d68f66a4a125b5","87b4df211c5ed722302f1d07221d0b1661681804","bcbdb0fa771ae9be99464b7256391adabb078808","4e6feb3c4873fabec2cb9cb69034a16e4c765ff5","7451118820dbfd69a086f658c7243792900cccd0","74138a90281117f790423e6d364b0ba07486841b","5bab5e830392383248b0f42ce1131ef5d4b2b5fd","0ceeccb45090d7831089991eb64a288f5164cfca","bc4f92457de13b10b48a8ba2d9c6bf92ddfbd207"],"pdfUrls":["https://marine.rutgers.edu/pubs/private/Song_etal_JGeophysRes_106-C5_p.9223_2001.pdf"],"title":"Effects of topographic variability on the formation of upwelling centers off New Jersey : A theoretical model","doi":"10.1029/2000JC000244","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1029/2000JC000244","venue":""}

The objectives of this study were to identify (i) professional or demographic characteristics; and (ii) attitudes associated with pharmacists’ ADR reporting in northern Portugal.\n Methods: We conducted a case-control study on a population of pharmacists employed in hospital and community pharmacies across Portugal’s Northern Regional Health Authority catchment area in 2003. Cases (n = 34) comprised pharmacists who had reported at least one ADR to the northern region’s drug surveillance unit, and controls (n = 280) were randomly sampled from pharmacists who had never reported an ADR. All were interviewed using a mail questionnaire. Most attitudes were based on Inman’s ‘seven deadly sins’ and were measured using a continuous visual analogue scale. Answers were recorded in a range from 0 (total disagreement) to 10 (total agreement). Logistic regression was used to determine the ADR reporting adjusted odds ratio (OR) for a change in exposure corresponding to the interquartile range for each attitude.\n Results: The response rate was 86.8%. Reporting probability proved higher among hospital versus community pharmacists (adjusted OR 20.0; 95 CI 3.3, 125.0; p < 0.001). Attitudes to ADRs were strongly associated with reporting probability. Hence, an interquartile decrease in any of the following attitudes increased the probability of reporting by (i) 223% (95% CI 51, 595; p < 0.05) for “Really serious ADRs are well documented by the time a drug is marketed”; (ii) 240% (95% CI 89, 508; p = 0.002) for “I would only report an ADR if I were sure that it was related to the use of a particular drug”; (iii) 316% (95% CI 44, 1104; p = 0.010) for It is only necessary to report serious or unexpected ADRs; and (iv) 171% (95% CI 13, 549; p = 0.020) for “I do not have time to think about the involvement of the drug or other causes in ADRs”.\n Conclusions: ADR under-reporting is strongly associated with certain attitudes, possibly indicating that under-reporting could be minimised through educational interventions targeted at changing such attitudes. Pharmacists’ ADR education must be improved and educational programmes should be focused on altering attitudes identified by the study as being associated with under-reporting. Our data also indicate that community pharmacists must be a priority target for this intervention.","inCitations":["eddca76cb0bf5efd0e3aa43e6a4ac8b512d6d82c","8ae1f4b3db50d5c51b3d0e4091a12b8e782d7bc0","6bcf6b45bcdcff1ef316125181e91a21e84df68f","6f78cfe08231f8d8eeb8cd8396a17787180034bc","01bba0417495ee51d493eea07d047d59335348ad","c24584497d7646d3633274c78e4ece14c531caa5","314386bafd000d8d18c3707157c1534a9d11afa9","72ce4721da7dcf647a9521659dc0262a8ec099bf","8833ce2c60b0ddab0b183a8bbb541ba327b2062e","e7c46ef9cc73dafb59bfe5176791ec3f6b4851eb","d9ba53c658d8d99d80a0e6338b81b7ccdedb3a50","891010e7b6a19a72e85ef54270fa94983d3c7f30","87fea58c453e60264869f0d48d2e827d11d10294","b844bcd529ed16e27b380683bceb8649ecd5fb43","a2e5e24837d9653d8aa86c8cdadad157de2da7e6","a664ef32e0a342c9f2e6d5ac58128af475a1ccd4","1d0bd8ed72744312cf758a71491afe54123d3833","5cdbb2783a0504d5b77477f0fb13fb981d1f0676","f5d6bb76f98697dccb4b7c47f8789033100d5045","905ee7409bb2316c8b32985a5d9ee3f10f63e1d4","4aae97d29f0f1a4816e383292881567d1ae2f313","a4dd0292d7125e64afefbceebc207e5955f747ff","6b960167304844306438db02d04c796249eff286","042dcc5882bb8f1b61d40169456096c511c076f2","1c658f7862824fc241a9b1ff04ade3f59acb88d3","e2a5afb1ea71ea6546cbeb1cc64764b166e8fecf","50a635027ab16ad7633b9c925f38223f9336c41d","f6e2ca74550bcfb4621d40f33e685cd26097c4a3","e7cd2b151af084b7a69ffa800472acae7af52e2c","2421cfb617df8b8bde3dea83ced13f9aaed8edfb","d2324dab3dcdb1abc421f4ab46e6ec8c027af66e","0610defaca595caea426035c1b099b1ace4936f0","50dfe19d9a559bafb5e5cdfea1a3dfd2ea657a41","16c62d0df601025c88c68ac322239bee8b8de13c","2dad2a07df0dd0f9e56820a0f969699f4b2589d8","c247e4a3dd4a652587c8aa8272bbcf6169e382fc","cb6c12282c0ba7a3281e72f99bac12c234cf7ce9","c2f0c44d43c8f34eae8b74c6823a0957059acf9c","93ff97a31b72974f9b050f0b514e199643e1a55d","242a0557e384bcded261f83b6a44ecd086dc1015","946b8b83b7dfc6ada06fd3e2a3fc0cd41b67ac9d","bf0e2dbd64eda527cca679a02c1e2af131ee34ae","13a2f2f38ee8dc54a3f8e4a525765e38ea64a3eb","8ca9f46aec7e0b23db2381c51a51426f3dfc9bc5","1b3752fef3144a5bc2974d738c8595ae0461de7f","10ade9895077545abd6c96b18d9a3edaae2f13c1","e38e4ee4aa34ad3f498e71a9dfdd6b4880317e50","c176d2a8cabc3ebd83c615070b2bf9987694b8e7","f8ed7284fb89a46ce72dec5307e191f08ff5988e","0add4f8b638fc1079bbe360afcec33b8a47ddb33","e2cead4ebad92c14ea4f4b9dd5ce116d95f74dba","42bc50e09661a179acbd538c822a69488865336b","ff54b939913809d2b79c2ba45f6b769224218003","6cee00976685859524313e3e23b2a405e90b8334","35837f294003b7fec3b8a89f80e2ce34cef6f6a4","5ee6bfd5cbd6543556c6e6bfd69da5ff75cecf9e","c52dd3cdf6ef4003148fcd6394e023654adadb66","be20daa6af31d0c8ebcf1d3fd19d0ced88fb0816","30c876e6508efdc2a8012a851ef896109aca2e6d","0169f55a856ddb21db0676f97c5daf9aee9b7ae4","be1a534c4316a8c354e61fc24ef13d15e90bd0f9","3b5bdca51f3dd7b97b2401b98e142d892221cb36","6c46d3b449c8c80b6878ecc893a2421714e6c8e9","58c76c80dfd9858a93fcf0a6149688de80e13576","7ee750d5374228c8d48750e2961bdcee829d385c","eebea6ab704a9af779edbe1a733fdd015e14245c","6045717bacdd4598908d19ebaf180414397afba7","61de874c310092a1288d4ef27bacf75423f7c155","4212a52a0f9e8d225a5aeecb33627754d832e1e3","48596dc3b3732bfbdda91f98dbde8aff4fb9f953","9b21b783de5565730f002eaad0b151212970bad4","936f907537426133f7cafd7b6e110164f19852ca","b8c4139427b49330a07b69441f66cfeb88e4ff0e"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Influence of Pharmacists’ Attitudes on Adverse Drug Reaction Reporting","doi":"10.2165/00002018-200629040-00004","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.2165/00002018-200629040-00004","venue":"Drug safety"}

By using glass reflow and seedless electroplating process, a void-free copper via with a smooth side wall can be obtained. This enables a vertical interconnection between the electrical pads through the glass substrate. Furthermore, the proposed through-glass-via was applied to the packaging of a CPW transmission line to investigate its effects on the RF performances. For the encapsulation of the packaged device, which is the CPW line in this case, the glass cap with the cavity is anodically bonded to the substrate. The measured insertion loss of the whole packaging including the copper vias and the CPW line covered with the glass cap was 0.197 dB and the return loss was 20.032 dB at 20 GHz.","inCitations":["898c5b2311b495af6ad23cec8467e6a09dacbbed","62da59a5b2c9534a75fa1d77cb8ab4ad494ef7f8","8e6fe037494e420da4d7ec38857bfacecc5ac186","f902ce55dd37ee6b704fa18c37ab3ac879e74350","76ed2762c8328279edd709409b0437a45e83082d","7fe6a1f5b40bc6e4de363a10ed02030d365b6d7c","1d0376fd97ad1e2057312599322e31d36021701b"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Fabrication of void-free copper filled through-glass-via for wafer-level RF MEMS packaging","doi":"10.1049/el.2012.1413","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1049/el.2012.1413","venue":""}

Its unique flora and fauna, rugged scenery, and historical connections with Charles Darwin, make it a place of environmental pilgrimage. Between 1970 and 1985, visiting tourist numbers, comprised largely of foreign naturalists, grew from negligible levels to about 15,000 per annum. In 1987, visitor arrivals to the Galapagos grew to 32,500 following the opening of a second airport in 1986. Management of tourism has involved a policy which requires most visitors to be accommodated on boats, places strict controls on the sites which can be visited, and requires tourists to be accompanied by highly-trained Naturalist Guides. The policy precludes development of any substantial island-based tourist infrastructure.

In addition, the method of Paritial Least Squares (PLS) was used to achieve principle components and various spectral preprocessing methods were discussed. During PLS modeling, the Savitzky-Golay could improve the Prediction Residual Error Sum of Squares (PRESS) within 6%.

The most important predisposing genetic factors in psoriasis are genes of the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region. Accumulative evidence has shown that several HLA alleles are closely associated with psoriasis; however, they tend to vary in different racial and ethnic backgrounds. One hundred forty-seven unrelated Slovak patients with psoriasis vulgaris (average age at onset 28 ± 14 years) were genotyped for the HLA-C, DQB1 and DRB1 alleles by the polymerase chain reaction using sequence-specific primers. Allele frequencies observed in the group of psoriatic patients were compared to those obtained in the ethnically matched control group comprising 194 subjects with no history of psoriasis. Susceptibility to psoriasis vulgaris in our study group is significantly associated with HLA-C*06 (odds ratio (OR) = 3.85), DRB1*07 (OR = 2.56) and DQB1*02 (OR = 1.09), respectively, whereas DRB*01 (OR = 0.05) is associated negatively. Hereby, we provide the first report on the association of HLA-C, DRB1 and DQB1 alleles with psoriasis in the Slovak population. Our findings confirm HLA-C*06 and DRB1*07 as the most important genetic risk factors for psoriasis. However, the role of HLA genes as causative in the pathogenesis of the disease remains unclear. Identification of genetic factors that increase the risk of psoriasis is a precondition that helps to elucidate the pathogenesis of this troubling disease and identify targets for a more specific and effective therapy.","inCitations":["843d5cbd6c2fe028ecc56a68a150e5df78079502","aca7de8984c531d5f2f351460bbb3bd075de0c0f","5c48dad6e1034f578528f9a2d83cfd5535fe88dd","7121f1902d94ccd7ea975d06d0389d2fd682a8e9","1db7692402b9a3fc28d7b1d16b5f742299950d1b","cd9070ac05d984cb37bfdb5e96bfa63f503a4138","d29f5620f74519e6e385379a04534cf873284e81"],"pdfUrls":["http://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/pmc/02/9d/12223_2012_Article_213.PMC3683150.pdf"],"title":"HLA-C, DRB1 and DQB1 alleles involved in genetic predisposition to psoriasis vulgaris in the Slovak population","doi":"10.1007/s12223-012-0213-7","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s12223-012-0213-7","venue":"Folia Microbiologica"}

The correlation of +0.839 between the percentage of total protein determined by formol titration and the Kjeldahl method indicated that the Orange G dye method has an advantage in accuracy compared to formol titration as a rapid method for determination of protein in milk.

Because these disorders can often be chronic illnesses with significant physical, psychological, and social consequences, early intervention is critical for a good prognosis. This requires skilled primary care physicians to recognize signs of eating disorders and refer patients to the appropriate level of care. The purpose of this project was to gain clinical exposure to eating disorders and their treatment to become a better-informed future general pediatrician who can identify and initiate management of these disorders.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"The multidisciplinary treatment of eating disorders focused clinical multidisciplinary independent study project (FCM-ISP)","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Total, viable and necrotic tumour tissue, tumour cell yields, and colony forming efficiencies were measured in clone A human colon tumour xenografts as neoplasms grew from about 100 mm3 to about 6000 mm3. The volumes of the total, viable and necrotic compartments were fit using the Verhulst equation to obtain estimates of growth rates and maximal sizes of the various compartments (carrying capacities). Additionally, at four discrete tumour volumes (250, 850, 2500 and 5500 mm3), hypoxic percentages, proportions of parenchymal tumour and host cells, interstitial fluid pressures, and proliferation kinetics including measurements of apoptosis were determined. \n \n \n \nThere were interesting relationships between the shapes of the curves for total, viable and necrotic tissue to some of the other endpoints measured. Specifically, the volumetric growth curves for the total and viable tumour tissue compartments were identical to a volume of approximately 1000 mm3, but diverged at larger sizes, with the viable cell compartment exhibiting a smaller carrying capacity. The shape of the growth curve for the necrotic compartment exactly mimicked that for the total volume compartment, but was delayed in time by about 21 days. Similarity in shape to that of the overall tumour volume/necrotic volume curves was also seen for the curve for the increase in interstitial fluid pressure, and for the increase in the size of the host cell compartment. In contrast, the growth of the hypoxic compartment and of the parenchymal tumour cell compartment were similar in shape to that of the viable compartment. These data indicate that these compartments are functionally linked. \n \n \n \nMarked changes in cell kinetic parameters occurred as tumour size increased from 250–5500 mm3. The labelling index and growth fractions decreased from 0.256–0.125, and 0.77–0.40 respectively, and the cell loss factor increased from 0.52–0.74. The volumetric and potential doubling times increased from 4.3–17.6 and 2.1–4.6 days respectively. The cell kinetic changes could not be clearly related to the changes in shape of either the overall tumour volume or the viable tumour volume.","inCitations":["0a3bee8d6b8ce69611aa1c69c87c57efbedec164","058e92e37491a566bd131daf5916f7730e63cb96","0acaa3a3eee6ea9e19bcf4bc660eeba5929df5e9","e59372ae47d971d4c6f351ddedecb7af880044a7","7a10a29def0be2ec0122c69fa469d10bd334b86f"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Changes in the extents of viable and necrotic tissue, interstitial fluid pressure, and proliferation kinetics in clone A human colon tumour xenografts as a function of tumour size","doi":"10.1111/j.1365-2184.1994.tb01387.x","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2184.1994.tb01387.x","venue":""}

Selection of the appropriate type and quantity of resuscitation fluid is not supported by evidence based consensus and discussions such as the ‘crystalloid colloid debate’ have been prolonged and unhelpful. We are seeking a straightforward way of guiding resuscitation of shocked patients. The Prior Hypothesis suggests that capillary blood pressure and membrane osmotic pressure (MOP) must be equal and opposite to achieve fluid balance in the microcirculation. Membrane osmotic pressure is critically dependant on the pore size of small vessels – larger pores allowing the egress of large molecules from capillaries and therefore lowering capillary MOP. Our studies suggest that shocked patients fall into two groups: a ‘dry shock’ group with elevated MOP, and a ‘leaky shock’ group with a low MOP. The ability to identify these different groups has implications for treatment– both choice of resuscitation fluid, and the use of other vasoactive pharmacological agents which influence capillary pore size. Methods Concurrent blood pressure and MOP were measured in 57 shocked patients on presentation to the Emergency Department. MOPs were measured using a process taking less than 5 min with a standalone osmometer requiring as little as 50 µl of serum. Results In the patients tested two distinct patterns of abnormal MOP were distinguishable. 20 patients fell into the ‘leaky’ shock group (MOP 19–24 mmHg), 9 in the ‘dry’ shock group (MOP 27–30 mmHg) with a further 16 having MOP in the normal range (24–27 mmHg). Conclusion Our findings are consistent with the use of a rapid MOP test to categorise acutely presenting patients into ‘dry’ and ‘leaky’ shock depending on capillary pore size. Further work is required to test the utility of near patient MOP testing as a guide to effective therapy during emergency resuscitation.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"PP21 Rapid assessment of membrane osmotic pressure as a guide to resuscitation in the acutely shocked patient","doi":"10.1136/emermed-2019-999.21","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1136/emermed-2019-999.21","venue":""}

Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) is able to delineate internal structures of vessel wall with fine spatial resolution.

The findings revealed that the time needed to administer the WAIS-III subtests to generate the summary scores, index scores, and both scores were 58, 51, and 65 min, respectively. The time required to complete the primary subtests on the WMS-III was 21, 15, and 6 min for Immediate Memory, General Memory, and Working Memory, respectively, resulting in a total administration time of 42 min. The time necessary to administer most of the subtests was unrelated to age, education, or performance level. These data demonstrate a shorter than expected administration time for the WAIS-III and a longer than anticipated administration for the WMS-III.

Social networks in cloud are used to reflect real world relationships that allow users to share information and form connections between one another, essentially creating dynamic Virtual Organizations. Anonymous authentication is a technique enabling users to prove they have privilege without disclosing real identities. Many existing anonymous authentication protocols assume absolute trust to the cloud provider where all private keys are stored. This trust result in serious security and privacy issues in cloud provider. In the proposed work secure and efficient anonymous mutual authentication protocols using Radio Frequency Identification technology for cloud services are implemented based on ZKP technique. Zero Knowledge Proof is an interactive system where one party wants to prove its identity to a second party using a password but does not want the second party to learn anything about the password. Finally present experimental results and validate the acceptable performance impact of our deployment on a modern social network.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Efficient RFID Authentication in Cloud Computing","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

The primary questions addressed in this study concern the role of self-regulation while children were engaged in drawing pictures of real and make-believe objects. The study questions were addressed by examining the private speech (i.e., spontaneous self-directed talk) and drawings of real and make-believe objects made by 108 children (36 in first grade, 36 in third grade, and 36 in fifth grade). The findings of this study illuminate differences in the use of private speech (overall and by subtype) for self-regulation purposes by participants based on the type of drawing task (real or make-believe), grade, and creative ability level of participants. This study also found a moderate, positive (r =. 28, p <. 005) correlation between the drawing and creative ability of participants. Avenues for future research are discussed.","inCitations":["0c19c8892a7821bd7e76f315310f40cdcff296c2","fb8acfea94598265c9f30109d614f7a54f133372","3bb2da769905817dc3955dff54ee5dffcf472164","8981b2b45dab5ca12470f8f6ce5e4deb59c3942d","5fa030abb35595df7a0b91ff807058b9f42e3420"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Situated Creative Activity: The Drawings and Private Speech of Young Children","doi":"10.1080/10400419.2004.9651458","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1080/10400419.2004.9651458","venue":""}

Subdebris melt was calculated based on empirical equations derived from field observations. The model was applied at the Inylchek glaciers. While runoff from Southern Inylchek flows directly into Inylchek River, runoff from Northern Inylchek is blocked by Southern Inylchek and forms Lake Merzbacher. This lake is drained frequently by outburst floods. To calibrate the model, a multi-algorithm, genetically adaptive multi-objective method (AMALGAM) was used. Daily runoff observations from Inylchek River as well as glacier mass balance gradients from other glaciers in the Tian Shan were used as objective functions in three split samples. Runoff simulations yielded Nash–Sutcliffe coefficients mostly higher than 0.9, and the mass balance gradients were simulated in an acceptable range. The results of the different split samples vary considerably. Considering the used objective functions and additional data such as the equilibrium line altitude, we chose the most promising parameter set to calculate the filling of Lake Merzbacher. This analysis indicated answers to several questions concerning the hydrological system of the lake. Apart from calving at the ice dam formed by Southern Inylchek glacier, the lake seemed so be filled predominantly by meltwater from Northern Inylchek glacier. The lake has a permanent runoff, also during the filling process. After the outburst, the channels seemed to be closed quickly.","inCitations":["ed1cd213035b5da07af17d22da27252f757bb3a6","7fd2b0b6ad444cd23e885d3b6176e79281ef07ce","ba37619df012d259a6bb2303fa99c80728260497","df81b1639d2e3f03d3f9cbbb1264afe10e41ecae","cc3caee4adeb590e1db0378b453ce46e89b1d2a1","4f4a5f5ffb4dcdfb7f4be439929c08d004f0b1db"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Modeling Runoff from the Inylchek glaciers and Filling of Ice‐Dammed Lake Merzbacher, Central Tian Shan","doi":"10.1111/geoa.12061","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1111/geoa.12061","venue":""}

The natures of the X and Y atoms not only affect the relative stability of the isomers, but also the interaction sites available on the H2XY molecule. For all the systems considered in this study, a covalent structure was obtained from a non-covalent isomeric form involving a double π-hole interaction. Such a covalent structure corresponds to the global minimum for the (SO3)(H2CS), (SO3)(H2SiO) and (SO3)(H2SiS) complexes, and a local minimum for the (SO3)(H2CO) complex.

This structure contrasts with compartmentalized assemblage structures that have been verified in antagonistic food webs. Here we evaluated whether nestedness is a property of another type of mutualism—the interactions between ants and extrafloral nectary-bearing plants—and whether species richness may lead to differences in degree of nestedness among biological communities. We investigated network structure in four communities in Mexico. Nested patterns in ant–plant networks were very similar to those previously reported for pollination and frugivore systems, indicating that this form of asymmetry in specialization is a common feature of mutualisms between free-living species, but not always present in species-poor systems. Other ecological factors also appeared to contribute to the nested asymmetry in specialization, because some assemblages showed more extreme asymmetry than others even when species richness was held constant. Our results support a promising approach for the development of multispecies coevolutionary theory, leading to the idea that specialization may coevolve in different but simple ways in antagonistic and mutualistic assemblages.","inCitations":["580c2409f3ef417a72f97847d16514ba0a0da263","c7a19c4a5381d196619824b10d233a9f6c401bc5","30ebb4fab96a6c37b94e85278991e138fa38244c","6f245cc1c4c69968bf539c739ce853959f059a5e","03c54a4341c47997097fdd6ba1c8760fddfe4735","329674ef0458030b32f4fee882242360dbc59319","c6dc586525fa8358e2aa2f572e373b928174fdfe","2361658140cbdbd8e82af46788842f054ae66a6c","5c0b00e91b211cf4555c0dfc673c595ee89b1bf3","5cdd68c9c8413bc8856895997699b01b33666dcb","f148194a6ecccc36ecc50373b5216794aea1fc64","55ab917ba9be8323139e36301d30e27eab42df07","6ae09646790950cc7328483739e6b79f45433e69","514af4b5c2cf0c7366e03c2400556070721b08ed","138747bbeb3389c61dbd3e79d90734ced460f583","9a37e02f638276f278c2df0199514b2dd56f43c3","9c07564435c7d008ad2a68baaf0c2593a8dd13b6","f51e88c912fc731ee0260259ab0bcd3de31933e9","ec8636a7e21f2f2e6c7a8b17a4bc5ecf68ad5cdd","254f618fe23089a40bc62573e093e31fa1463343","0a1b634093b6c6d44661cce6fc9b64c03d02c1da","ffa86be97efd0068f5c7066bce66b74324809379","b5d8d45b8c2df677f2845131954efcc9e8521976","76ae3ac925d2bb093289e4bd3beb9465665ad46f","cc68a5c1ff28f864ba35667df785dd63815adb02","510d4896f7e93aa55d045097e8b18ded23559fb3","29968d4ca03ccd34ce77dd39bfff3de24ff04b1d","3aa829b825e4df4ebfa43a64d0d8b2f0f29fed8a","f0f23f988d808d6f72df824469b79dfbf9b7dcf6","7b92f57d7b6fa28b00045c6827e63ae6e6e813d1","5810be944fd0b9889f6e29df5f72a4b8a3617522","21c8e1a96132fe1ff57a2c9e17e69738bf12e2ac","35cfeb6ab3a4cf57b49196d0d68f476952d285be","032fdfc73d35e1e951715a68cfd2cf88a068d09b","736bb2ebfef7dce311c9d456f5df9f1bd79410e9","f8f256e5c304d5a9f6b264b608980b07ac768ad4","50f24c3722d23266af843772d97c4128bfd2be04","319c1064a236ea7e7a81fe7d0cf26a1d976933f4","749f0ef72e1dd861fa61cd0a7ed8976efdc67033","277333dd0854befc9405b32af06a37748e996323","788fcb2eea4125b4650545d5cbe6dced8a24330c","7e06ecf72f87988d4d1bae8c97d91badf86ad077","228ecc36c67fc2bc4a2246000beec2933597fe85","0e3128e3ecb5e104ba2b1e5af9dfb4b48617c182","2cd22cee4a46297a43bbf4413b7064578516c0c7","2fa9365994fd753c25a76eca6a2fbb9d0e61d7b1","712e549ae0b1d431897e69c902d24d74c8aadf40","f3681d0c65fd0a21b6e144a87505ee1a6bd0c4c4","ad7cb6d6a4c986ce91186c475013687cebe0d048","e638ef11479643b9dfcc3959fe515645ea49e770","110eaa75c355e26a707d696efb85a1c725ef5571","d392ccf5db900d65f407bf1014c74f948ad708c7","7943733ec52adc0d3e2827a5f373fed2edaebd88","a58ad56d2cadec3b650407f078850a7cecd838fd","36c3259950238590c2a6d29fe724d55158e5e799","5c4a0888ec628ee42200a587243998f5a0ed0beb","a18513ed36ceabdc6deafd64621f941284ee4acd","ffa265caa85fd2fe87f13cf0fb282a7d93789f05","56ce77400c5043a296248058d4af71ffc4b970f8","ad1782ea008412a87b0fa710714896458074cfb3","cca7c385ceac3464c70995b9dfa2536c7fc3a207","f6ad7a33fa56abb2f8a40969c96d9a5f06161531","c0e5e7857e1e1e9a5a9e56dfe8529c7fda032589","09959ae4684ebf362b564b0f4caf4d60eb45a86a","bbed9ac5d4057decdaf3ef60d32200a7051d9352","67932e58848afbb2b658cd58d99a843082a445b1","aa6a3e9263d9827965e782531be31533288e766f","47bd94c73c5853b891feecc9807b6fdc97c18c9f","ce5986db004bbdc688672744ebac3ebd0193fc36","994d44a20cf842425ea42423038cd4525918203a","bc41b3e081d03935ccc790e18744a49971e7792f","470478eb4e09153847ca6efd59e2b61dd979f821","cdfdb24cda1f8ab2a0e68c7fade6859534618ddf","1c42b4720aeec3eeeb0ce735019780b0c4eda57f","c6b9f1382164355e149816510ba01e8d70a5d047","d92fe8685b0db0d0d009e64a39cab679c13e337c","9fe8dab29e210f23db27493e001f4622603879be","7bc9dd2ca258e06cc115f456ebcb216fbb0abf9b","c1bcfef0850ecc48a91535f54b8e62d95957c991","7b4b3af5bca0e1bfe9e5bd2521f8858351f177e6","b1cd490a6c0731323dfa71848899f5b75fb4c0ff","181ee1069fb08658a85e77b22ae35d1941a716d5","e3a69c315ec6598550c1d409fd09f37e58c75f4e","1b671ade6f0314520d92baf4c05986a1b2e564d9","1bf2aac01ec91aa5a8d998324e524652f35fcad5","25ff9ca78a4390f6cad5817fb9b18cc419bf1f0a","e0bbaf549d6ad98b533a559714e213bead737a91","a46630629bff43a3a393ffe964da94324e9d7fe8","791a853986db0320f57b9097698207000b7141ed","ed781b2215ffcde881dc0715c056d000e0526b40","89ffff45a7f161bd8cc6cb513f833ee31665f24b","24e3f4731ffc74d12c54d84a257134d54d1370c6","a5ec55fb43569ca4f71c49189dd0f6e73b5d829e","f9d5880a8ff0e0e27b344751af30e364b09b6539","d4a970a4c4cba7d36ce9d9a57aacb1fb93f91795","fe41baa0b4578d736d49502e4e85a34a947cf0dd","306207517f9abe05171f50ef7458b5f2fbd9d1ba","606c7fb361cae0d21686866ece083ec2d1d25e60","3508d298547c91a5ce4e006496b93f4f14c3af01","8ba390051b04c62e66901d09ded4f59bcc19ed35","2b285cf27b3d205f4332fbb2b8b588cf9065098d","d30a1dd88da3a9a94d78ac3db87f42ec5617aabc","e05bf36661d912702964b15aeaba21da98206a8d","ac2359f52b9c958e4e9ae17ba521787506c08dce","f9ff085fdbf52126519e95d0d974d9f2df8a06df","8beb1d14e4823ddef8c2d326fd7e9ab4e43eb410","3334418e029046d1f2535fe7d50b68761aea9578","b84788ecd2055e112fe7cf47bdcffd029ef8e37c","d6ff682cd35e48ae9fe8d530b0a75eafc3514734","b3b592e18474102192a8387f7baad63274a1f019","b91edae7298e48978b1fa3964063f18d2cc68df4","4b191478dd04c142c8cf174a5e529ccca30a50a3","db8665d2ff6c00e4459cbdccf2f18bc3e89e5606","dc5c0402f0789e86eab65f577eb7c5dc780d0766","086597cd6b5ae286c023a81c6db30b6c93de4490","621c5ae4f0b12a4a89b69350f

We have developed a quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR assay for measurement of GHR messenger ribonucleic acid levels in small human tissue biopsies. To compensate for sample to sample variation, an internal RNA standard, which differs from the wild-type GHR transcript by only a few nucleotides, was reverse transcribed and amplified together with the GHR transcripts. PCR was carried out using one biotinylated primer to permit the purification of single stranded PCR products on streptavidin-coated microtiter plates. The ratio between the wild-type and mutated transcripts was determined by two separate minisequence reactions in which a primer, annealed immediately 3' of a variable nucleotide, was extended by a single 3H-labeled nucleotide, complementary to either the wild-type or mutated sequence. The assay range was 0.125-8 x 10(5) transcripts/sample, the mean intraassay coefficient of variation was 8.7%, and the lower limit of detection was 0.125 x 10(5) transcripts/sample. GHR messenger ribonucleic acid levels were detectable in small amounts (10-100 ng) of total RNA extracted from adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, and liver. The GHR gene expression in liver was approximately 10-fold higher than that in skeletal muscle, whereas intermediate levels were found in adipose tissue. In nine patients undergoing elective abdominal surgery, GHR gene expression in skeletal muscle was reduced on day 3 after surgery compared to the baseline level. The decrease in GHR gene expression was accompanied by a decrease in skeletal muscle glutamine. This suggests that the postoperative protein catabolism may be caused at least partly by acquired GH insensitivity due to reduced expression of the GHR gene.","inCitations":["4cd656019165f047e8c6c648e5cbdbb804d9f7cf","12c4347b0d5b35689314d7925f1c95bc97f74225","658fd28dee3f3d6ddc3a03ad036ee47eeed650f8","d0eb67993427775d32a87166f48277a974febfcb","0c3cbd27c5a308761ae2e34cb0f814753b1e0878","f86091b2f41dac6871404d2a67f310ebad6c2eeb","9ce1fd3581971c6b299f6095a47827f35fa4f1fb","63354e9675a1efd4a1c53f71aed7a9c212c31bdb","b932432e554ec5a3cefa952d580ff87d6c9fbb31","8691ca5fd132e22aed723b7f8e7bc61fd80cd244","a7ca2c36d7b8c2c1cda96a3c9b0e834eb5c8aa68","a107f93bf90f41bbab01a3f932e4a8b7445670cb","c9c94ee13868ce1f2ee00efee145a371bca66c4f","a3ba94d1d39bb19c5015e7537032794819ba8706","27dc7b6d56c08e9077a90ce77275e53fe232c8d0","9b709fbaa40e12f006905392cd7ba37dffa0c3fa","9206de59219f81ae11ff18b5321dcddf2dce2fdb","32f98ed1fe46724eedb700bb2dbd3ecf37ae4cf7","a0fb1bed1a15787d04bea84bdccd945888128c76","41fa2d2c788a6d825516531364cc4e8e66d8a012","3a48200ce7da3d365202f527624e7e8478744444","fdb25e083955d9f4596d4c9150580a5270593a3b","eef2ee2bfddc2abaf9e0e23c18ca7cf31165d68f","1aaef5491ad2480d3bc019151d7a7703519aa5f3","3eec1d464476d4772a1f1158a0d6331fd3a00ca0","2c62ffee6dc3c4b193ea001ce5637338787a1e0f","e56f0760b07004c66a47feaf3b5ffc304a902d3d","488cedb601b26cb14f247cea36190b2e3feececa","977e5a6af124cf296ae5b0440e56bfe5d64ed5fe","028664ca4706f6d13bf01e8f2053b6f171aa682b","0593a4f8c6a1bccb4fd8e1d408b2690071c355f8","13d64a282acf4737e3d2b8c64ea91e0efe41440c","3d8233b3432d7383fdea521ed54c6f7935041f30","7a339cc5686489069bc1818cde4daf93a0500f51","2fee06a46eb0170fc03ff673514bff5b51a2f235","e8ef3647567e54198e1b7f0fc6a6944a0cfc8c11","9bd5d85471d35de54fbd9f2667b5129fe971fd80","051807d3c94b6ef8ffc5a6c7730308b3cbfee07f","9993fd5bfdaad07d2bc8945429119856cbbfc7f9"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Measurement of human growth hormone receptor messenger ribonucleic acid by a quantitative polymerase chain reaction-based assay: demonstration of reduced expression after elective surgery.","doi":"10.1210/jcem.82.2.3718","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1210/jcem.82.2.3718","venue":"The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism"}

For instance, in nanometric technologies the increase of integration density makes memory devices more sensitive to radiation effects that can cause multiple bit upsets (MBUs) in adjacent cells. In this paper we use random error correcting codes to deal with such particular channels. We propose a very simple and efficient scheme for correcting blocks of adjacent errors. Our approach consists in applying a transformation to the code in order to adapt it to the channel. Undoing the transformation at the receiving end converts blocks of adjacent errors (of any length) into low weight error vectors that will subsequently be corrected by a bounded distance decoding algorithm. The proposed method can be applied, without noticeable loss of performance, to any existing encoding-decoding scheme. Moreover, and in a list decoding fashion, we obtain stronger results for binary cyclic codes.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6979827/"],"title":"A simple scheme for correcting blocks of multiple adjacent bit errors","doi":"","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"2014 International Symposium on Information Theory and its Applications"}

Despite a strong biological rationale, little research has evaluated whether incremental increases in preconception blood pressure have early consequences for reproductive health. We evaluated preconception blood pressure and fecundability, pregnancy loss, and live birth in the EAGeR trial (Effects of Aspirin on Gestational and Reproduction; 2007–2011), a randomized clinical trial of aspirin and reproductive outcomes among 1228 women attempting pregnancy with a history of pregnancy loss. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure were measured during preconception in the first observed menstrual cycle and in early pregnancy and used to derive mean arterial pressure. Fecundability was assessed as number of menstrual cycles until pregnancy, determined through human chorionic gonadotropin testing. Pregnancy loss included both human chorionic gonadotropin–detected and clinical losses. Analyses adjusted for treatment assignment, age, body mass index, race, marital status, smoking, parity, and time since last loss. Mean preconception systolic and diastolic blood pressure were 111.6 mm Hg (SD, 12.1) and 72.5 (SD, 9.4) mm Hg. Risk of pregnancy loss increased 18% per 10 mm Hg increase in diastolic blood pressure (95% confidence interval, 1.03–1.36) and 17% per 10 mm Hg increase in mean arterial pressure (95% confidence interval, 1.02–1.35) in adjusted analyses. Findings were similar for early pregnancy blood pressure. Preconception blood pressure was not related to fecundability or live birth in adjusted analyses. Findings suggest that preconception blood pressure among healthy women is associated with pregnancy loss, and lifestyle interventions targeting blood pressure among young women may favorably impact reproductive health.

At multiple steps along this pathway, cells are instructed by transcription factors on how to further differentiate, and several check-points have been identified. These check-points are initial commitment to lymphocytic progenitors, specification of pre-B cells, entry to the peripheral B-cell pool, maturation of B cells and differentiation into plasma cells. At each of these regulatory nodes, there are transcriptional networks that control the outcome, and much progress has recently been made in dissecting these networks. This article reviews our current understanding of this exciting

The sample consisted of 29 patients, 23 women and 6 men aged between 65 and 100. In an initial interview at the hospital a questionnaire about daily living activities before the fracture and an ADL taxonomy were used. In a second interview three to four months later at their homes the same questionnaires was used and the subjects were asked about satisfaction with life as a whole. After the fracture many had difficulties in conducting hobby activities and in making social contacts outside the home. Grooming and washing were other activities that few could manage. A large number wanted to perform most of the activities that they did not have the ability to do. A hip fracture is a hazardous event in the life of an elderly person, and may lead to a permanently more restricted life. It is apparent also that this influenced how satisfied th...","inCitations":["892272a66987ea2c23fda8f9515a613b4b2f07fa","1827b30fa6e6510d8e93a68f362072d921685cf0","c9f51aee986aa017d5f1d0fa757f6f2b461a3b7e","d5c06b5d0c7e895996a6c8a314d847207beb71c6","aebe4faa346f06b0667a5e3cbb568f0465685e55","e89824714afec120f445c62337f8f44dba3d5586"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Consequences of a Hip Fracture in Activity Performance and Life Satisfaction in an Elderly Swedish Clientele","doi":"10.1080/11038120310004501","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1080/11038120310004501","venue":""}

The capital investment required would be relatively small, comparable to a single large present-day launch. 1 2 An attractive payload would be large quantities of high-performance chemical rocket propellant (e.g. Liquid Oxygen/Liquid Hydrogen (LO2/LH2)) that would greatly facilitate, if not enable, extensive exploration of the moon, Mars, and beyond. The concept is to use small, mass-produced, two-stage, LO2/LH2, pressure-fed rockets (without pumps or other complex mechanisms). These small rockets can reach orbit with modest atmospheric drag losses because they are launched from very high altitude (e.g., 22 km). They would reach this altitude by being winched up a tether to a balloon that would be permanently stationed there. The drag losses on a rocket are strongly related to the ratio of the rocket launch mass to the mass of the atmospheric column that is displaced as the vehicle ascends from launch to orbit. By reducing the mass of this atmospheric column to a few percent of what it would be if launched from sea level, the mass of the rocket could be proportionately reduced while maintaining drag loss at an acceptably small level. The system concept is that one or more small rockets would be launched to rendezvous on every orbit of a propellant depot in LEO. There is only one orbital plane where a depot would pass over the launch site on every orbit - the equator. Fortunately, the U.S. has two small islands virtually on the equator in the mid-Pacific (Baker and Jarvis Islands). Launching one on every orbit, approximately 5,500 rockets would be launched every year, which is a manufacturing rate that would allow significantly reduced manufacturing costs, especially when combined with multi year production contracts, giving a projected propellant cost in LEO of $400/kg or less. This paper provides new analysis and discussion of a configuration for the payload modules to eliminate the need for propellant transfer on-orbit. Instead of being a “propellant depot”, they constitute a “propulsion depot”, where propulsion modules would be available, to be discarded after use. The key observation here is that the only way cryo-propellant can get to orbit is by already being in a tank with a rocket engine, and that careful system engineering could ensure that that same tank and engine would be useful to provide the needed rocket impulse for the final application. Long “arms” of these propulsion modules, docked side-by-side, could boost large payloads out of LEO for relatively low-cost human exploration of the solar system.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://trs.jpl.nasa.gov/bitstream/handle/2014/44775/10-5108_A1b.pdf?isAllowed=y&sequence=1"],"title":"Low-cost propellant launch to LEO from a tethered balloon — ‘Propulsion depots’ not ‘propellant depots’","doi":"10.1109/AERO.2011.5747487","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AERO.2011.5747487","venue":"2011 Aerospace Conference"}

Populations of different stored grain insect pests and grain losses were determined. The actual storage loss following the treatment period was the highest in the control (d) followed by PEPF (c), multiple dose fumigation (b) and recommended practice (a). The total insect density at dispatch was the highest in control (d), followed by PEPF (c), multiple dose fumigation (b) and the recommended practice (a). Thus, storage losses were directly related to insect population density level. The major insect pest species recorded were Rhizopertha dominica, Trogoderma granarium, Tribolium castaneum and Sitophilus oryzae. Differential population growth patterns were observed under different protocols.","inCitations":["12d8b368aabd0df71e39c290a090d1e52728988d","53ec31e8b882fee944b510b5f75eafe46ce67849","b8b957d4a7e07bc7debc2bf9573caae306aed4d3","13158865e8248f2c87bea7de7cc977b0533110ba"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Management of Bagged Wheat Godowns to Control the Stored Grain Insect Pests","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Data, such as passwords or bank account details, could be further used for other criminal activities. For instance, the scammers may intend to leave the victim’s information behind after they have successfully committed the crime so that the police can suspect the visible evidence as a suspicious criminal. Many customers are now aware of the need to protect their banking details from the phishers by not providing any sensitive information. Recently, phishing attacks have become more sophisticated and targeted to the online banking users. Hence, this paper reviews one form of a current type of phishing attack known as a ‘man-in-thebrowser’. It specifically focuses on the use of browser extensions, including their operational strategies. Techniques to identify, minimize, and prevent this type of attack are considered. Lastly, the author provides specific advice for the bank customers based on her research interests and experience in online banking security.","inCitations":["1b04c24fe528b5131f58adf50e323d8ce229adc8","01ec623512bcfd2453e9c1b618145c0d800f893c","6b28a50e927bd0bfb330fd1f287de487790aa89a","dbe3ef83949c778e9c058a71f4d696ce434f326b","ddc967d57dd8e8737aa2766659fd932cbeb3bb7e","00cf44f4486f5afbae4dec922f6625940fe422b1","5498d488b77d91d3b7119e91012546221b7aff95","469c5a06b5ee1f8a8895cb6da01e1921da8ee811","345796dd6038042697749cef024464ffa4df62a8","6c09cbabe3fc44cf12c5dc043667058ff99ae474","33cb456651b669f9109329559a4ead4556f54034","dc4d7bfd1e8b890f5da9d1aeb8f8fb91acea43e2","76147e21fd950cb8c46b3b4271a88bfaa763e69d","0ac6084ff2e9d6b59992ae7d211784690b133e5c","39d4410dccaf88273b48df464a89f30088cc8738","ffcd9d6b90691f0d4495b543ca54dfc962cd38c6","80e71bcebc15efe18d338ee82255e8c703795b67","a2789dfb6eab151f718c39b005a61a90fd23f371"],"pdfUrls":["https://ro.ecu.edu.au/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1014&context=ism&httpsredir=1&referer="],"title":"Review of Browser Extensions, a Man-in-the-Browser Phishing Techniques Targeting Bank Customers","doi":"10.4225/75/57b4164330df2","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.4225/75%2F57b4164330df2","venue":""}

New trade policies under NAFTA and GATT opened markets previously closed to some U.S. producers, but created additional import competition for others. The 1996 farm bill removed the government safety net for some crops, leading to more downside price risk. Economic and political turmoil occurred in the former Soviet Union and parts of Central Europe, while China emerged as a major force in world trade, but some other Asian powerhouses faltered. These changes have had major impacts on U.S. producers, while presenting new opportunities for some and new challenges for others. Increasing globalization has meant that U.S. agriculture has become more than three times more dependent on international trade than the rest of the US economy. In 1997 for example, U.S. exports of food and agricultural products accounted for 28 percent of farm cash receipts. For the overall U.S. economy, merchandise exports accounted for only eight percent of gross domestic product (GDP). Greater access to international markets is considered essential to the continued growth and prosperity of the U.S. agricultural economy. In fact, trade growth is especially important as farm program support is lowered and producers become more dependent on commercial markets to maintain the size and scale of U.S. agriculture. Large shares of important U.S. crops and livestock products are exported each year. About one-half of U.S. wheat output is exported each year. U.S. cotton exports account for 40 percent of production, while soybean output represents 35 percent, and corn one-quarter. Even though U.S. beef exports account for only 5.4 percent of production, this share has more than doubled since 1988 and is projected to double again by the year 2005. Consequently, agriculture in the United States is becoming increasingly trade oriented and more sensitive to events and actions which occur beyond our own borders. U.S. agricultural imports are also growing in importance. While agricultural imports represent only 4.5 percent of total consumption, this share has increased by 50 percent since 1990, reflecting greater dependence on foreign food supplies and agricultural products. Imports of coffee, tea, cocoa, bananas, and tropical cooking oils account virtually all of U.S. consumption. Nearly 80 percent of broccoli for processing is imported, compared to 60 percent of all fresh fish, and more than 40 percent of fresh grapes. Fresh fruit imports account for 37 percent of consumption, while fresh vegetables represent about 10 percent.

The specific binding of [3H]SQ 29,548 was inhibited by KW-3635, a novel non-prostanoic TXA2 antagonist, SQ 29,548 and BM-13505 (daltroban). SQ 29,548 showed a single class of binding sites with a Ki value of 1.6 nM. The inhibition patterns were better fit to two-component curves for KW-3635 (Ki values of 0.45 nM and 42 nM) and BM-13505 (2.3 nM and 20 nM). U46619, a TXA2 agonist, induced an increase in intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i), which was inhibited by these antagonists. KW-3635 and SQ 29,548 did not induce any increase in [Ca2+]i, whereas BM-13505 was found to induce a smaller increase in [Ca2+]i. The BM-13505-induced increase in [Ca2+]i was also inhibited by pretreatment with KW-3635, SQ 29,548 and BM-13505. The results demonstrate that BM-13505 has partial agonistic activity on TXA2/PGH2 receptors, and KW-3635 and SQ 29,548 do not. SQ 29,548 and BM-13505 inhibited both U-46619- and BM-13505-induced increases in [Ca2+]i to a similar degree. Alternatively, KW-3635 inhibited a U46619-induced increase in [Ca2+]i more effectively than a BM-13505-induced increase. These results suggest the heterogeneity of functional binding sites or subtypes of TXA2/PGH2 receptors present in VSMC.","inCitations":["1d1e0d657cfbcf9bf3bd3f4841f2579e17b6df82","f7899bbff61defee5f3de3ab9d2dc773974a1eeb","b246a0af039b3983fa7e8bbe153c400a9a6bfc29","43e9be9b9495c17f239b0d16cd3e0ff8478ce3b1"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Differences in activities of thromboxane A2 receptor antagonists in smooth muscle cells.","doi":"10.1016/0922-4106(92)90128-I","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/0922-4106%2892%2990128-I","venue":"European journal of pharmacology"}
