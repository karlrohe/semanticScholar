Piemontese×Friesian heifers were mated with Piemontese bulls or Limousin bulls. The offspring (75% beef breds) was used in two different husbandry systems for the production of meat. The young bulls ( n =68) were kept indoors and fattened more intensively, grew quicker and were slaughtered at a younger age (18 versus 26 months) than the outdoor fattened heifers (n=43). Due to the commercial beef production systems in the Netherlands, the effect of the husbandry system was confounded with sex. Carcass and meat quality were determined as carcass weight, conformation score, fatness score, pH, meat colour, drip loss, heating loss, shearforce, intramuscular fat and sensory characteristics, such as tenderness, juiciness, aroma and liver taste. Results showed that the breed of sire had no major influence on meat quality of the loin, although Limousin offspring were fatter than Piemontese offspring. Differences in the husbandry system led to minor differences in meat quality of the loin of the crossbred offspring. Rapid growth within the husbandry system was related to a higher carcass weight, a better conformation and better eating quality.","inCitations":["730f1d4c38c9ed6f6a50ccaea8d2425a13f22e10","e7fdb7e13b248c575dd23c058c47fcf72df19515","5eb748ea2ef7f9f6a06fb2a1d73c95df57c048cd","a182725f6c8ba77385fcb0d119143d96d3747dfa","bdc88cc6514fe9be3467aaafd344c23eda603509","8d84c18f90c38096ce8598b6b764440de8bfc47b","afefabb8d2b5a68f48ac92f85d7850e9f09e9475","a5a7f926f955b2ff8cda79b725e23ceb38b7aba7","622bd15771addcb610c587bea220441cef1bcf94","453ed00691f8f655e23db87cf11e65e9798c7968","28836a1fe005e636edea59f29aa9ec6792859001","a9626ff8afaafbd1e40f371e02d601a64517ca71","3ae5c29f0e61362e7f727aa11c9163bfce43b696","fee73f25b162b2489d13ad6bcbd9b2cbb08638a6"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Effects of sire breed and husbandry system on carcass, meat and eating quality of Piemontese and Limousin crossbred bulls and heifers","doi":"10.1016/S0301-6226(98)00176-6","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/S0301-6226%2898%2900176-6","venue":""}

After oil quenching from 1300 C, all the alloys -- except SMA-15 (27Al-14Fe) -- have a two-phase microstructure, one phase of which is martensite with the characteristic platelet morphology, and the other a globular second phase distributed throughout the microstructure. The amount of second phase generally increases with increasing Fe content. Alloys containing less than 145 Fe were found to be quite brittle at room temperature, indicating that the second phase is at least partly responsible for room-temperature ductility. The best tensile ductility (12%) was obtained in SMA-17 (23.9Al-20Fe) which was shown by X-ray diffraction to consist of 70% (mostly disordered) fcc ((Ni,Fe){sub 3}(Al,Fe)) + 25% (partly ordered) bct (martensite) + 5% B2 (NiAl). Differential scanning calorimetry showed that the transformation temperatures for this alloy were M{sub p} = 65{degrees}C and A{sub p} = 95{degrees}C. Room-temperature tensile strains of 2--3% could be almost completely recovered in SMA-17 by heating for 3 min. at 600{degrees}C with the load removed. Upon subsequent cycling (i.e., strain-anneal cycling), the amount of strain recovery increased dramatically from 70% in the first cycle tomore » nearly 100% after 4--5 cycles, indicating that cold work may help in improving the shape memory characteristics of this alloy.

The proposed filter comprises of half wave SIR based multimode resonator, with Bowtie radial stub integrated into its symmetrical plane. To attain dual band characteristics from wideband response a new transmission zero is created in wide passband which splits it into wide and narrow passbands. A new transmission zero is procured by Bowtie radial stub. The wide and narrow passbands are centered at 5.5 GHz and 12.5 GHz respectively. To procure flat pass band response, a high impedance Interdigital feed structure is used at input and output. Due to this feed structure, the insertion loss S21 is at almost 0dB line in first passband. Further by varying the radial angle $\\theta_{1}$ of Bowtie stub, both passbands are controlled by manipulating the location of new transmission zero TZ and even mode frequencies in both passbands. From simulation results, the measured return loss S11 and insertion loss S21 for the first passband are less than −10dB and 0dB respectively with upper and lower edges of pass band are at −24dB and −30 dB respectively. Additionally, for the second pass band the measured return loss $\\mathbf{S}_{11} > -10\\mathbf{dB}$ and insertion loss $\\mathbf{S}_{21} < - 1.3\\mathbf{dB}$.

Data on the impact of early weaning for restarting the post-calving sexual activity and consequently, on pregnancy percentage, are offered. Also the interaction of early weaning with the nutritional status of the cow, which was assessed by the body condition before mating, is underlined. Information on the nutritional management alternatives of the early weaned calf is presented classified according to grassland or confinement conditions. The nutritional management of the early weaned calf under grazing conditions is characterized by the management based on concentrate supplementation (18 % crude protein), at a rate of 1 % of the animal live weight. This strategy allowed attaining similar performances to those in which the calf remain with the cow. The nutritional management of the early weaned calf and managed under confinement is suggested as a strategy allowing higher profits than those attained under grazing with \nfeed conversion around 3.5 kg of feed/kg live weight of calf produced.

Fabricating these complex structures by using common approaches (e.g., casting and machining) is very challenging. Therefore, rapid prototyping techniques, such as selective laser melting (SLM), have been investigated for these applications. In this study, we characterized a highly porous (87 vol.%) 316L stainless steel scaffold prepared by SLM. 316L steel was chosen because it presents a biomaterial still widely used for fabrication of joint replacements and, from the practical point of view, use of the same material for fabrication of an augmentation and a joint replacement is beneficial for corrosion prevention. The results are compared to the reported properties of two representative nonporous 316L stainless steels prepared either by SLM or casting and subsequent hot forging. The microstructural and mechanical properties and the surface chemical composition and interaction with the cells were investigated. The studied material exhibited mechanical properties that were similar to those of trabecular bone (compressive modulus of elasticity ~0.15GPa, compressive yield strength ~3MPa) and cytocompatibility after one day that was similar to that of wrought 316L stainless steel, which is a commonly used biomaterial. Based on the obtained results, SLM is a suitable method for the fabrication of porous 316L stainless steel scaffolds with highly porous structures.","inCitations":["fa0fe8c8dbb155e0fa36e42e1322512d6660b7bb","54f618304fdbeb7668aec4a4f519ddb3a12983d5","53840c99fcb400ffdcb6cdde09cde5f97c499e5f","e36cb4013d258948740130f497d54e7bd8d708b6","6d04e6c6662d9ea700de9149c0e2cf3ca2b6f357","072fe4330438a3606c28e04b6a62edf9c5aca83d","2b8101b8f79c863902238ccbd4b3acaffe5faa31","ca8a6d7456e6448d7a1b9d05d830b31e50c93324","278dd1a0c1e4676142c30b037d012d38bc82ad5e","2e642692dcb02da0fe69cb13ba320c052e7f92fb","971e759ea86c2c5536c431b308c6a434d2476d32","0317f0713be7487152b5d4d9d2366e35b25f7256"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Highly porous, low elastic modulus 316L stainless steel scaffold prepared by selective laser melting.","doi":"10.1016/j.msec.2016.07.027","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.msec.2016.07.027","venue":"Materials science & engineering.

The paper includes a synopsis of Sensorimotor intelligence, followed by preliminary suggestions for a mechanism (the \"Schema mechanism\") for its development, and a hypothetical Scenario which partially reinterprets Sensorimotor development in. terms of that mechanism. The Schema mechanism focuses on Piaget's concept of the competition and evolution of mental \"schemas.\" The schema is modelled here as an assertion that one partial state of the mechanism's world-representation is transformable to another via a given action, taken when the schema is \"activated\". A proposed process of \"correlation\" allows a schema's assertion to be extended or revised in response to empirically-observed effects of the schema's activation. Correlation uses the formation and activation of schemas to propose and test hypotheses, in contrast with the passive tabulation characteristic of associationist mechanisms. Further features are proposed to enable schemas to become coordinated into composite structures, \"compound actions\", which can be used by other schemas; and to synthesize new \"items\" (state-elements) when existing ones prove inadequate to model the world. The Scenario outlines how the Schema mechanism might begin to make its way through the progression of Sensorimotor stages; development culminating in Piaget's third stage is discussed. This development includes learning about the visual and tactile effects of eye and hand motions-eg, learning how to look directly at an object, or to move a hand into view; and die organization of that knowledge to designate the tactile properties of \"visual objects\", and vice versa-eg knowing how to touch an object which. is seen-paving the way to a sensory-modality-invariant representation of objects and space. The Schema mechanism attempts to \"learn from scratch\", without built-in expertise or built-in structure in its learning domains. In the past there has been little success among Al programs of this genre. But many such attempts have suffered from mechanisms which were trivial in that they placed the full burden of acquiring and structuring knowledge on one or two simple tricks, whereas, I claim, the present effort shows a willingness to incorporate a multiplicity of elements into a complicated mechanism. In addition, the Schema mechanism benefits from its orientation around a nontrivial theory of development. Piaget gives a comprehensive account of the infant's evolution of primitive problem-solving and domain-specific (chiefly object-manipulation) knowledge; this .ccount is …","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/41044/AI_WP_198.pdf;jsessionid=2B2B43C15722C76329E7C45F93E39018?sequence=4","http://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/41044/AI_WP_198.pdf?sequence=4"],"title":"Suggestions for Genetic A.I.","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

This effect consists of the occurrence of high frequency harmonics. When the rotor turns, the movement of rotor slots in relation to the stator slots produces cycle variations in the magnetic circuit reluctance. This effect results in high frequency harmonics in the current wave spectrum. Simultaneously high frequency harmonics torques appear. These are known as slot harmonics. To avoid slot harmonics, both in the rotor and in the stator slots, the slots are skewed. When this technique is used, the simplified hypothesis of the finite element model (FEM) in 2D cannot be employed, as it is based on the concept that the magnetic field possesses translational symmetry along the machine shaft. In this paper a method for analysing electrical machines with skewed slots is presented without using the 3D analysis.","inCitations":["1ec54d3a78da2b4be9bcaf500617c146f6de4940","01ea7c248ee43e64ffa54b9eb6bd7f142817d7e0","21f999def4bee9c0ee3282765afa62342aa52fe2","a9eaf9e6ddb5ae44f1bae289042595f553af0823","b679a457916424714e8d76ebb0bf5c4001035e71"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Analysis of skewed slots in induction machines by using 2D finite element method","doi":"10.1108/03321649810203152","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1108/03321649810203152","venue":""}

It is often associated with significant hemodynamic perturbations and can severely impact the outcome of ICU patients. Etomidate is often chosen by many critical care providers for the patients who are hypotensive because of its superior hemodynamic profile compared to other induction medications. However, recent evidence has raised concerns about the increased incidence of adrenal insufficiency and mortality associated with etomidate use. A combination of ketamine and propofol (known as ketofol) has been studied in various settings as an alternative induction agent. In recent years, studies have shown that this combination may provide adequate sedation while maintaining hemodynamic stability, based on the balancing of the hemodynamic effects of these two individual agents. We hypothesized that ketofol may offer a valuable alternative to etomidate in critically ill patients with or without hemodynamic instability.Methods/designA randomized controlled parallel-group clinical trial of adult critically ill patients admitted to either a medical or surgical ICU at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, MN will be conducted. As part of planned emergency research, informed consent will be waived after appropriate community consultation and notification. Patients undergoing urgent or emergent ETI will receive either etomidate or a 1:1 admixture of ketamine and propofol (ketofol). The primary outcome will be hemodynamic instability during the first 15 minutes following drug administration. Secondary outcomes will include ICU length of stay, mortality, adrenal function, ventilator-free days and vasoactive medication use, among others. The planned sample size is 160 total patients.DiscussionThe overall goal of this trial is to assess the hemodynamic consequences of a ketamine-propofol combination used in critically ill patients undergoing urgent or emergent ETI compared to etomidate, a medication with an established hemodynamic profile. The trial will address a crucial gap in the literature regarding the optimal induction agent for ETI in patients that may have potential or established hemodynamic instability. Greater experience with planned emergency research will, hopefully, pave the way for future prospective randomized clinical trials in the critically ill population.Trial registrationClinicaltrials.gov: NCT02105415. 31 March 2014.","inCitations":["975090319bf6b2a027bbc4dc37ce9dd73b91ba1c","e374bc127fcda029527bbd922e05253875322447","ad92993d9bd48817eb2703780f07a023f192c54a","c3d499d51bd2b580e8126cc10753ae5c3abd7689","b15a491545f1b1338003c8c938fa1fa503ac7940","87b556976e5aa94e53f646281b696d0ff9cbb52b","6212dd0cb885f304bdcd95724293df1255380396"],"pdfUrls":["http://trialsjournal.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s13063-015-0687-0?site=trialsjournal.biomedcentral.com","http://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/pmc/4c/5c/13063_2015_Article_687.PMC4409710.pdf","http://www.trialsjournal.com/content/pdf/s13063-015-0687-0.pdf","http://old.trialsjournal.com/content/pdf/s13063-015-0687-0.pdf","https://static-content.springer.com/esm/art:10.1186%2Fs13063-015-0687-0/MediaObjects/13063_2015_687_MOESM2_ESM.pdf"],"title":"Ketamine/propofol admixture (ketofol) at induction in the critically ill against etomidate (KEEP PACE trial): study protocol for a randomized controlled trial","doi":"10.1186/s13063-015-0687-0","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s13063-015-0687-0","venue":"Trials"}

Moreover, the TERS has not been updated to DSM revisions and DSM is not used for the official clinical routine documentation in several European countries.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nThe objective of this study was, therefore, to investigate the psychometric properties of a diagnoses-corrected version of the TERS (items 1 and 2 omitted).\n\n\nMETHODS\nIn 85 patients awaiting liver transplantation, the discrimination capacities, predictive value, convergent validity, and interrater reliability of the original version (TERS10) and the diagnoses-corrected version (TERS8) were analyzed.\n\n\nRESULTS\nIn both versions, patients with psychiatric diagnoses (69.4%) exhibited significantly higher TERS mean values than patients without psychiatric disorders. This also held for patients who were temporarily not found eligible for transplantation in the psychosocial evaluation (25.9%) compared with patients who were eligible for listing for transplantation. Furthermore, the area under the curve was >0.90 for both versions and a cutoff of 32.25 is suggested for TERS8 (sensitivity of 90.9% and specificity of 87.3%).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nOur results substantiate good psychometric properties of the revised (diagnoses corrected) TERS, which is of great benefit for standardized psychosocial evaluation before liver transplantation. Further, validation of TERS8 and its cutoff in other samples of (liver) transplantation patients is needed.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Standardized Evaluation of Candidates Before Liver Transplantation With the Transplant Evaluation Rating Scale.","doi":"10.1016/j.psym.2016.11.006","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psym.2016.11.006","venue":"Psychosomatics"}

This property can lead to water and contamination rejection from surface. For creation of this characteristic on brick surface, first the sol, containing particles with average size of 243.48 nm was synthesized using simple route. The contents of mentioned sol were sodium silicate, hexadecyltrimethoxysilane and oxalic acid. The prepared sol was brushed on to brick surfaces. After drying of coated brick surfaces, the water contact angle soared considerably to 153.91° and sliding angle was lower than 10°. The resulted superhydrophobic brick was further assessed using abrasion test, water immersion test and resistance against acidic and basic environments. The results represented that the superhydrophobic brick was very durable under harsh condition. The water contact angle nearly remained constant after stability tests which can assurance the application of this method in industrial scale.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Fabrication of superhydrophobic nano sol: Waterproofing of coated brick","doi":"10.1016/j.jobe.2017.09.003","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jobe.2017.09.003","venue":""}

The O18+K1+ColV+ form of MW was highly virulent for chickens and mice but the corresponding form of K12 was only highly virulent for chickens; the O18-K1-ColV- forms of both strains were of low virulence for chickens and mice. K1 was more important than O18 or ColV in determining virulence for both animal species. Ducks and guinea-pigs resembled chickens, not mice, in their response to infection with the O18+K1+ColV+form of K12. Pathogenesis studies revealed that the virulence of the forms of MW and K12 was associated with their ability to proliferate in the central nervous system; only low numbers of organisms were found in the blood and spleen of inoculated animals. The O18+K1+ColV+ form of K12 multiplied in mouse brain and in mouse blood in vitro; its multiplication in chicken blood was partially inhibited. Agglutinins to this and other forms of K12 were found in chicken serum but not in mouse serum. Large doses of mouse serum given to chickens and large doses of chicken serum given to mice did not alter the manner in which these animals responded to K12 O18+K1+ColV+ infection. Vaccination protected chickens and mice against lethal intracranial infection with the O18+K1+ColV+ forms of K12 or MW; it produced a much stronger immunity in mice against intraperitoneal challenge than against intracranial challenge.","inCitations":["5efbbeb4c27c0384b0614c56e17d2cbfdcedd77d","98142d2055cfb08e3e27dbbb0c7e5bf96df0a197"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Acquisition of genes from an O18:K1:H7 ColV+ strain of Escherichia coli renders intracranially-inoculated E. coli K12 highly virulent for chickens, ducks and guinea-pigs but not mice.","doi":"10.1017/S0022172400062781","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1017/S0022172400062781","venue":"The Journal of hygiene"}

By heating the boron target up to 800 °C its intrinsic electrical conductivity becomes sufficiently high to sustain a stable d.c. magnetron sputter discharge. The process parameters required for maximum c-BN formation were different for the three methods investigated. This could be correlated to the process parameters measured by means of Langmuir probes and optical emission spectroscopy. The films were investigated utilizing Fourier-transformed infrared spectroscopy with respect to their phase composition and compressive stress. Investigating the delamination of c-BN films, humidity was found to play a crucial role.","inCitations":["ae3c3cc0dd1ef34947c0fac12b4b68db6bbf753b","9acc905f2c2d1e9d51b8998f6b9e6796da8851cc","468b2009e738e80252a5f61cc241231f92cca798"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Cubic boron nitride films by d.c. and r.f. magnetron sputtering: layer characterization and process diagnostics","doi":"10.1016/0925-9635(95)00507-2","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/0925-9635%2895%2900507-2","venue":""}

This study investigates the influence of the carcass (body) ply turn-up and bead reinforcement turn-up around the bead region on tyre durability and operating characteristics using finite element analysis (FEA). A slick motorsport tyre with two carcass plies was modelled in ABAQUS based on the material properties obtained from tests and the profile provided by the tyre manufacturer. Various factors including the material property, the cross-section area, the spacing and angles of the reinforcement cords and the height of reinforcement turn-up, were characterized by numerical experiments using the design of experiment (DOE) method. The effects of these parameters on tyre durability and operating characteristics, in terms of mean response analysis of carcass stress, vertical stiffness, lateral stiffness, cornering stiffness and the strain energy density (SED) of elements in the critical region, were determined from the finite element tyre model. Similarly, optimum reinforcement turn-up heights were obtained and provided predictive information for tyre design purpose. Furthermore it was observed, from both experiment and prediction, that the vertical stiffness was rather high for the requirement of the Formula Student (FS) racing car. In order to reduce the tyre vertical stiffness and improve the tyre durability, an improved tyre based on the original design but with single carcass ply was proposed. The FEA results on tyre durability and operating characteristics from both the original and improved design tyres were compared. The FEA predictions indicated that the improved design model was capable of providing the required tyre characteristics as well as improved tyre durability. It is therefore proposed that the predictive technology using FEA can be utilized to optimize the tyre reinforcement turn-up effect in future tyre design.","inCitations":["974f9652209839e4c467c7e68dd1dec6465346be","6e4f0f45146488027b5637aa3e3d452251ca751d","2107fbe28aa2998fa19092fe1b944c5e1c1a9f79","8e5f18820dafa50593f12304755325b6f4d2da93","22a9f8102be59f46dcc56fd4477c2136770dbb01","74bd3470e0302a727ea33d573b25efbc2f729742","b5f581a5e19a604c167cb3bbbb1f387aeb8ded3e"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Optimization of reinforcement turn-up effect on tyre durability and operating characteristics for racing tyre design","doi":"10.1016/j.matdes.2011.06.014","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.matdes.2011.06.014","venue":""}

A method based on two independent measurements (Bragg curve and beam transversal map) is developed to evaluate the saturation dose defined as the value above which the photoluminescence intensity begins saturating up to an asymptotic maximum.

A continuacion se estudian las relaciones sociales que se generan en torno a la tienda mediante el analisis de ambos sectores patronal y asalariado en diferentes aspectos tales como las sociedades que constituyen para la defensa de sus intereses respectivos la actividad sindical o la evolucion de las mentalidades.","inCitations":["016e91a96414071e34ae9a67a8c180c242efa6d6","f35a9c7890a2b7303ebc54fcfd2681857804ee70"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Los sectores mercantiles en Madrid en el primer tercio del siglo XX.: tiendas, comerciantes y dependientes de comercio","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

As expectations of diversity loss grow, this understanding is also critical for effective management and conservation. Although explanations for biodiversity patterns are still a matter for intense debate, they have often been considered to be scale-dependent. At large geographical scales, biogeographers have suggested that variation in species richness results from factors such as area, temperature, environmental stability, and geological processes, among many others. From the species pools generated by these large-scale processes, community ecologists have suggested that local-scale assembly of communities is achieved through processes such as competition, predation, recruitment, disturbances and immigration. Here we analyse hypotheses on speciation and dispersal for reef fish from the Indian and Pacific oceans and show how dispersal from a major centre of origination can simultaneously account for both

Fish from two populations (Bez Basin, south-east France) experiencing contrasted thermal environments (i.e. more or less stable) were reared during 4 months at three distinct temperatures (7, 9 or 12 degrees C). Both somatic (soma fresh mass and muscle triglyceride content) and reproductive (gonad fresh mass, fecundity, mean diameter of eggs and gonad triglyceride content) indicators were examined. Mixed models indicated that an increasing temperature had significant negative effects on all life-history indicators except for soma fresh mass. Differences in life-history strategy with regard to muscle and gonad triglyceride contents, however, suggest that populations experiencing more variable thermal environments may be better adapted than others to cope with an increasing temperature. These findings may have important implications for C. gobio populations, within the context of climate warming.","inCitations":["76aa4f9cff034f336f39f95494e59a4710216c31","55a18c451116fcbcca3c4fb5a7d9c3f5282730ae","46472c34012147ec14b988c1e89286710b5c6110","b389009dab92f16f7a90882ee742f5d6f645408b","23488c278303563fb7ebaf1eb840f9f49f146b97","02cc13a7f01e5926a3d5337cc82df920c728d165","6d8fc15dfc6f605b08c12b2516da2bfb23ccca91","9de3b0d898be80c6dc20d91de9e6a20beb5bee32","bc51121191f090cda826f09acb917deb7de22c79","c7d5c75e3ea8cf93ad39726792d4fdc1b6f1aaab"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Effects of temperature on biological and biochemical indicators of the life-history strategy of bullhead Cottus gobio.","doi":"10.1111/j.1095-8649.2009.02373.x","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1095-8649.2009.02373.x","venue":"Journal of fish biology"}

The patient series was retrospectively compiled in 1991; follow-up was prospectively assessed until 2000. Novel ECG variables characterizing repolarization and the T-wave loop were automatically analyzed. Of 772 patients with technically analyzable data, 252 patients (32.6%) died after a mean follow-up of 10.4 +/- 3.8 years. Direct comparison between dead and alive patients showed that the so-called T-wave residua (the absolute and relative amount of nondipolar contents within the T wave) predicted mortality (111 900 +/- 164 700 versus 85 600 +/- 144 800 between dead and alive patients, P<0.0002; and 0.43 +/- 0.62% versus 0.33 +/- 0.56%, P<0.0005 for the absolute and relative T-wave residuum, respectively). On Cox regression analysis entering age, left ventricular ejection fraction, echocardiographic left ventricular hypertrophy, and either of the T-wave residua, risk prediction was independent for the absolute (P=0.022) and for the relative (P=0.006) T-wave residuum, respectively, with age (P<0.0001), presence of left ventricular hypertrophy (P=0.002), and left ventricular ejection fraction (P=0.004) also being predictors of survival.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe heterogeneity of myocardial repolarization, measured by the so-called T-wave residuum in the ECG, confers long-term independent prognostic information in US veterans with cardiovascular disease.","inCitations":["12f18ff0ad88792a82c207741cc0e7d0aa829464","fc1ba906d0cee1a1e9e2f484927731e0ffe3aa0b","83226af6e4ebabe6445806d8ce0b63d80afd67ba","57a2731fd8c4348015355aec8b78f7626264dc03","f13044dc01a1e255b223208a5462eb998f95f3c4","9707128c2645864b1b5d92187977f9e7383f8a35","50e362d9c2e4b4f06f7e42b67d237273da29b2b1","5084b6b68dcd1ec7a77978bcd6b48d4df0ed5ac3","86c9e5ba963612f91bf755b9f9c27eb25bb0e357","4f6005509bd20dfae1e893453c54755a95c33ce2","872e0c064c70f50c7fcf0637f60168828057bff1","fb12aca78cd5f65708f62c3df91beada8cae0433","70c3a2657f31cfe95d94d20cc00d620cb90abea6","53c3cd63598f7b0853e684292f4cdc77d63252c2","9a11015dde70872c563632b7f1ece210dad7f8a8","93f64b426c626b2c0287aef74462e0453c018a02","519543019c1afa2237c4dbc187d45393f3493d26","d55767d6387727f8207b5c926c1fbe2c18dc68d4","32f27fee4132e86d0145071876b95e6e86dff3f1","1a724d83a91f61f7871460369791faea2abd3548","a428eae2b9923a6a1181f55da36e2b82108fce48","f7b684216147daa2463b66a2419df5a94d05b217","42d4a24e572ce504b0aeef71ce7a3ceb5abd334c","4e4191a6a0af4b30234d1bd0a790cf19e921a82c","7062b074ccb11b57a9ab0524d9e9d4e976e4a422","1594739d929077a72ae411f389d236f47f680031","bd1b21c5afebe07ab532868e54e33ce436a6865c","1b271476f5c940322f62732a491fca06815a3ce4","7c09e1038bb660f72dbed1acff691ec6c1f1174c","24b776338fc62c3012dc86e36c5db403784d562b","411b5634729f10ee737a17a95d3a6f0153a5bf87","ded94ef740acc29545f06c3e7af826bfe73beb45","0d38419a411fe4d7abbc0eed7ad86f15414adff5","9b9f1b05b5a7de89ffe36eebf453b1e7abdbed1a","cf8bd79b3accf70d21551d9218f71266c88469e9","9e3846ecaf3f3e4708341d786de960c7d0615b4e","d95971b2f377bb252426257fe41166ca309b40c2","846c6de646274ebc045165072be15e40e25b334f","86e98dd4c4df86a3b2e8571cf4bfad4d7b77de1d","75fdfa4580d090ea740db666b323a96140b21f86","91633aeb60f5f99b05205277b4f3d9140c38a541","460c12c68ff112e28376b7812343a5c836d9ca6f","b35eae71cb5f7fade14c8495326e12f6228d99e1","aeb73023366a4dca76f701859742e761f626c49b","60a8f72a46f2f7df7c465b7b587a316161a37e57","3cfca98a9467737692aa50df05d7a30e7fd5aa6e","88300e69d40d83faf2abec18aa92add342cd94eb","c94a95060d1b0605d209910f27bba29cd3135f24","28fb41efbeb63bef0ffd766f7b38c8d962600abc","17c6fc4a29300b01703269f598fe696f271b4ade","f66ab36a7146487196573ef039a1d6a9faabddb5","d353712877277434d18572abc87ec7a607fb196d","ae4097e7e624f6d798f13ea9267cdb8ed13d37a4","42424dad94a0aa1202e7509e79a332d319785f58","6bfbbee9ccb969f53d0828a156c70226eae81284","1ba5be8f66fff0fe990920a48e74b64424f53369","e6920e91b30e82ca95d2aeaa308110208180684a","1d4fe9b69d3ca10cd3673441c937fc17314e52e6","1fe338233d1a52a6f299af45a3efeb64d89e22dc","0dc323188c338a055be41fa8e6645cf6a79cf03f","f19eacf5777b4644f5bcff6b492f5648a5a32cc3","d8ee03c570a7edb7ec5a4e9d45f6a40f237d702c","e1e1dea614610dd316cab55762810fc90f9f7e55","18f023414ea72f5ffa568343f7ab690e874e6626","59a2a3bf6a1c4f3cd416c31602ba20c526f4c00b","206bd6ebb0b498e6e67f7a2dd67207dd71d58fb1","6ea3e53170e2d49e2e4f5146758fe69d77e53748","3942fef094b251480bf8ebd3104858842110c7f4","d135c8aeb5c882393c3dc379048cf2b17cce1406","1de33174f3b8d852a7ecdbd7d38f07c45f56ede7","43dadd02d35baeb60bcf12d46ad730459259eb16","e2e09905c90500ed59df88b60093137dcb177d5c","8e81749609e338b6bca1f5153c00f164d6fc809b","a3b3c53eb13affe78f153e30c6254e6bd63d6af5","80911bb06bc28ef47e1cde867bd8916989a580a2","8f78bdc16f2849ef0751f78a91c6f70f52761194","79dba96d29132f5470c1d64730f70b400be82af8","1290be7458696c83378b4860d6af3c107959a180","581345dc9689289a11567cb114e5f61464c6588e","194ec452c14fc9e76386e0fefb5f7610c9ef07f8","7380634057d27ab946c96979c49716f1ce9ccca1","e2fee2ef2fec2456f326b15485c7bfdecdd45bc0","07fa598381188906354e2002038b5373fb14cf95","61e1c88f858a5b4565ca69e1fef745f054bc68ef","fa7281d68019c9dd04d64f559ab7f74d992e5057","941ca786dca92b2fc604d6b29081e09c3ee8154b"],"pdfUrls":["http://circ.ahajournals.org/content/circulationaha/105/9/1066.full.pdf","http://circ.ahajournals.org/content/circulationaha/105/9/1066.full.pdf?download=true"],"title":"Analysis of T-wave morphology from the 12-lead electrocardiogram for prediction of long-term prognosis in male US veterans.","doi":"10.1161/hc0902.104598","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1161/hc0902.104598","venue":"Circulation"}
