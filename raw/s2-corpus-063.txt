Statistics reveal that every minute a human is losing his/her life across the globe. More close in India, everyday many lives are affected by heart attacks and more importantly because the patients did not get timely and proper help . In this paper I am presenting real time patient monitoring system along with additional facility that aims to expand patient monitoring over a wider area such as a remote village or town. The idea behind this is that remote places usually lack proper health care facilities and good doctors to treat various diseases. The patients could be scattered in various places including hilly terrain, where doctor’s frequent availability is not practicable. An Ad-hoc sensor network based solution is provided along with real time patient monitoring system. The proposed technique is intended specifically for remote rural areas where the infrastructural facilities such as the internet, GSM/GPRS etc are not available.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://www.rroij.com/open-access/adhoc-sensor-network-based-remotepatient-monitoring-system.pdf"],"title":"Ad-Hoc Sensor Network Based Remote Patient Monitoring System","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Herein we report a strategy to co-modify TiO2 with oxygen vacancies and CoOx nanoclusters for enhanced photothermocatalytic reduction of CO2. The TiO2-x/CoOx material exhibits prominently enhanced activity for the yield of CH4 and CO under ultraviolet irradiation at elevated temperature of 393 K, which is 111.3- and 13.2-times greater yield of CH4 and CO, respectively than the conventional photocatalytic process at 298 K, and 175.1- and 2.9-times greater yield of CH4 and CO, respectively than the pristine TiO2 under the same photothermocatalytic conditions. Control experiments over singly modified TiO2 and doubly modified TiO2 by different preparation history, together with high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM), electron spin resonance (ESR), and transient photovoltage measurements reveal the synergistic effect of oxygen vacancies and surface-grafted CoOx on the photothermocatalytic reduction of CO2 to CH4, i.e. oxygen vacancies at TiO2 surface facilitate the adsorption and reduction of CO2 and the dispersion of CoOx nanoclusters, whereas surface-grafted CoOx clusters facilitate the hole trapping and the oxidation of H2O. Thereby the coexistence of oxygen vacancies and CoOx nanoclusters at TiO2 surface promote the separation of photogenerated electrons and holes, and remarkably enhance the eight-electron reduction of CO2 to CH4 under photothermocatalytic conditions. This study shows the great potential of photo-thermal synergy on CO2 reduction and provides a promising means to design photothermocatalysts for solar photocatalytic reduction of CO2 to fuel.","inCitations":["a079339ff2361df119fd7ac87231ff878c105ead"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"TiO2-x/CoOx photocatalyst sparkles in photothermocatalytic reduction of CO2 with H2O steam","doi":"10.1016/j.apcatb.2018.11.022","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apcatb.2018.11.022","venue":""}

This information is essential to the planning and application of an in vivo drug trial in the R6/2 mice.","inCitations":["99b78aea3f57925568c771bfc1823f5c5ddc7616","83f7182b9e62a987578269a883e53328f6b3923e","693f7417a38a249cfb34e7f59b0e1f12111b72c9","70f6648ac0fca60dcee0692a4750b665eb18a520"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Monitoring aggregate formation in organotypic slice cultures from transgenic mice.","doi":"10.1385/1-59259-804-8:161","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1385/1-59259-804-8%3A161","venue":"Methods in molecular biology"}

Biological aging of the ovary is accompanied by a decline in both the total oocyte pool and the number of antral follicles maturing per cycle, as well as changes in the levels of circulating reproductive hormones. The biological aging hypothesis predicts that aneuploidy rates should be higher in women with a prematurely reduced oocyte pool, and that women with trisomic conceptions should show signs of earlier ovarian aging than women of the same chronological age without trisomic conceptions. Comprehensive studies of aneuploidy in groups of women with known causes of premature ovarian failure remain to be done, though anecdotal evidence does suggest increased rates of pregnancy loss and aneuploidy. Smoking, which is a well-documented cause of earlier ovarian aging, is not associated with an increase in aneuploid conceptions. Evidence from women with unilateral ovariectomies is inconsistent. Support for the biological aging hypothesis was provided by one study showing that menopause occurred about a year earlier in women with a trisomic spontaneous abortion compared to women with chromosomally normal conceptions. Associations between high FSH and pregnancies with Down syndrome and chromosomally abnormal spontaneous abortions have also been reported. However, the most direct test of the hypothesis, which compared antral follicle counts and hormonal levels in women with trisomic pregnancies and those with chromosomally normal pregnancies, failed to find a difference in the expected direction. A prospective study of FSH levels in women with subfertility also failed to find an association with the rate of pregnancy loss. The bulk of evidence thus suggests that, if the processes of biological aging are indeed related to aneuploidy, they probably involve factors other than those measured by oocyte or antral follicle pool size and reproductive hormone levels.","inCitations":["4b057e2ef263cba18fb5f7788af88592da9379e1","a802f6c8d41c830dce544113e0d7fa946ff86051","5f64042c811295029178e4e2200ea675a5c4a80c","bf305560ba338f17281d05c9d21137d46df02c58","80be2df3f8933183b0193a16b5c93457413260bc","6c507eb7b2ec29c257486f1e1db5cf3e6e3aae39","037d147c2750b35e00b4d1f2352e9f2e6b78b7fe","bc0b2dd36aacc26f05d5d083bf37b25087ba4c89","bbd1ffc3f465ff61b61994e86bdcb45d51dbf998","7b6377e8d75d98b4fd2d3b6dd478650506060ba8","95138b8bc17186841a30e9156bce5db6701b3e4d","8a5a665951ef3e970a01a7e995d1334ad4f97f4c","dc07d7c1f64e15a88f49efa227538c2fea66a689","550595307e006f489d03adc5b375b6f775029004","f5fb3bb65f7a594e2c98bf7fe6ebf444a686a2ca","3758d62d8966a276bacc0e1239a0ef7000cad9cb","2c82ea38268ea302fd8c7711790d83f5c2a2959c","da0088717efeebed58d0b16b3bfef3713c7b84e1","a11edc8ba444f17bd753e5426d6c9b0ef28e0521","8157fede070353b6ef06f1e7cea086d6c60be8fa","ba2a0c9f5612b3e82d6fbd0f55d3a0c6c7cb93d4","8d06b617584cf95a31bf8dc2b9a680a2340390f6","2c2f6f97ef7374df88bb8b0a2a42f223c5b78c54","f302abea94d2fc307d35fa49272b461e737f6ef0","b59d3068a88dcda4e35270a1ab29e5416a0dc27a","1a594b2ee9eabb95de5897bde559101650fda0ca","f787d56bafb7c763e6de3f8d01fdb57738cc9792","0200d3cfdc386088943cd18223bfeeff2ec25ad2","1cb1cd4ea33c8d2c02796e71e8b31d3d7ee6ab14","cd4343d2348b934d978247b1564f4c328a47da4a","e8ef1b15680b56698b9c8be0ea55ad5ec4ce8e6a","5c29fbfd6040b7f6debc68913de05bb535f4f0c2","69f4d7efd135c9b6e68378e113140895ea5752ad","c1500755db28a94030cbee98ef016b2ef01e9697","16d86ff9d1bc67d4414ec051fbc89455107daac5","4f52799fa0a7c2845b928a8be936ed56f51d511c","d5b17b562589a6686a32b65b7fa3b5951a1b73a4","c59927f7760ea8f8cbd85892770ebc38a3c34739","0805f81ee5f14a260aac084ed267710664dae44c","5a957843d48cb342cb16d7da6341a6d9bb9bbd76","39c980fff2dcc53b4750bd32e19b0facfe2140aa","b52408f8b645b1e97c9ca1ceadb7dc27dcd39fe5","9bea28edde7e04aa1e2e52882ee8df0714ce956a","d207aaca8421e5351ae2d2535d9941930f2f650e","6484f8fcd7b1de21e07c3bcac8fd6c35156dff1e","bf8d1b36661e37d659f204517eb32293027a06ae","3bd23522fb654f8fa2ded1d6317e34312259d627","86f1c9b21769552ab84de08bd194de468e9f1b77","4d0483c5567038d2b8b7bcb88fb8ac8ecc962df3","759bd8e68a1a5d29f44e89b0b95756811f3a3c6e","cb8068c88e1292415f7eb24c88eaa63cfd3c490d","29877e0816615708aeaa3943c966204b7404f253","871d1df27a0f5f67e105389306377f817d3d191f","140ef67dd22489e648c08893c025cd38a9ee9d45","284f0ee5f64728cde1e05a8b6404f761f33fb94d"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Biological aging and the etiology of aneuploidy","doi":"10.1159/000086899","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1159/000086899","venue":"Cytogenetic and Genome Research"}

It is somewhat less known that Einstein preferred constructive theories, and hence that his special theory of relativity seemed preliminary because its elements: clocks, rigid bodies, electromagnetic signals, etc. were presupposed rather than constructed from elementary constituents. Hence, questions remained: can special relativity be reformulated as a constructive theory? Can the effects of relativistic kinematics be explained in terms of microphysical interactions? In Physical Relativity, Harvey R. Brown boldly elucidates a mainly constructive account of special relativity. His project builds upon the works of earlier ‘‘trailblazers’’ and ‘‘unconventional voices.’’ Foremost among them is FitzGerald, who in 1889 proposed that moving bodies deform, to account for the null results of Michelson’s interferometer experiment. Contrary to most histories of relativity, Brown reasonably argues, as he has before (2001), that actually there is no evidence that FitzGerald expected only a contraction along a body’s direction of motion. Indeed, his prominent contemporaries, such as Oliver Lodge and H. A. Lorentz, did not present the hypothesis in that way either; since they acknowledged that a transverse axis of the body could well expand slightly to contribute also to Michelson’s net result. What appeals to Brown about FitzGerald’s account is that it involved, from the start, the expectation that the deformation might be","inCitations":["e9eefd99cc87c09551dc9301e3bf8f8e1990c4e4","a5ff9be760c91b5c27db24dd90556e94cd44ba42","a8f15df06e4f977d0bf284e760c2db659856a42b","92db3aadc573b0f9324433a50cc9e8164b90a7bf","4665e56c9811ff6f2cb538c473e3b713ffe4c0bf"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.martinezwritings.com/m/Relativity_files/SHPMPFitzGerald.pdf"],"title":"There's no pain in the FitzGerald contraction, is there?","doi":"10.1016/j.shpsb.2006.08.002","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.shpsb.2006.08.002","venue":""}

Extensive research has been conducted on the reliability of MapReduce, ranging from adaptive and on-demand fault-tolerance to new fault-tolerance models. However, realistic benchmarks are still missing to analyze and compare the effectiveness of these proposals. To date, most MapReduce fault-tolerance solutions have been evaluated using microbenchmarks in an ad-hoc and overly simplified setting, which may not be representative of real-world applications. This paper presents MRBS, a comprehensive benchmark suite for evaluating the dependability of MapReduce systems. MRBS includes five benchmarks covering several application domains and a wide range of execution scenarios such as data-intensive vs. compute-intensive applications, or batch applications vs. online interactive applications. MRBS allows to inject various types of faults at different rates and produces extensive reliability, availability and performance statistics.

These studies have greatly increased our understanding of factors affecting plant growth and physiology. Modern molecular technologies enable even greater insight into the complex biochemical processes underpinning those responses. In a recent study during winter in Hamilton, New Zealand, gene expression profiling was used to understand the way in which perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) responded to different defoliation management practices. Plots in perennial ryegrass-dominant pastures were defoliated to 2, 4 or 6 cm residual height and regrown until the 3-leaf stage before determination of pasture yield. Water-soluble carbohydrate (WSC) energy reserves and the expression of photosynthesis genes were monitored throughout the regrowth cycle. Pasture regrowth was reduced by lax defoliation (P <0.001; 2270, 2250 and 1910 kg DM/ha for residual heights of 2, 4 and 6 cm, respectively). Gene expression profiles indicate that plants defoliated to 2 cm increased photosynthesis in stubble tissue at the 1-leaf stage of regrowth, thereby compensating, at least in part, for the reduced leaf area and WSC reserves. This compensatory mechanism is one possible reason why regrowth of pastures defoliated to 2 cm was not compromised. These data confirm the results of previous studies and, for the first time, provide a physiological basis to explain how ryegrass adapts to different grazing management regimes. Use of such confirmatory techniques should give farmers greater confidence in the extended research results and, depending on the technique used, can provide a mechanism for gene discovery.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://ecite.utas.edu.au/X/7C3E5FE7569597CCE053021911ACF44A"],"title":"Using molecular biology techniques to improve our ability to manage pasture","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

The relationship is T t = A [1— exp (— BΔT c )] where T t is the daily total atmospheric transmittance, ΔT is the daily range of air temperature, and A, B, and C are empirical coefficients, determined for a particular location from measured solar radiation data.

Previous studies on the apoptosis of coronary atherosclerosis are usually prone to run into qualitative description without the aid of \"quantitative\" evaluation. To eliminate such subjective errors, we have designed a triple immunofluorescent stain assessed by digital camera and computer-aided analysis system so that the actual quantitative apoptotic expression of coronary atherosclerotic development can be more precisely evaluated.\n\n\nMETHODS\nSpecimens of coronary artery were obtained from consecutive patients undergoing coronary endarterectomy or cardiac transplantation. Twenty-seven blocks of paraffin tissue specimens from 16 patients were analyzed. According to the American Heart Association (AHA) classification of atherosclerotic lesion, type I, II, III lesions were defined as early lesions and the other three types: IV, V, and VI as advanced lesions. Apoptosis and cell types were recognized simultaneously by triple immunofluorescent stain combined with Hoechst, Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP Nick End-Labeling (TUNEL) and smooth muscle cell (SMC) marker staining. Apoptotic index deduced from TUNEL-positive nucleus number divided by Hoechst-positive nucleus number. Apoptotic cell-type index deduced from TUNEL-positive nuclei, which are surrounded by cell type fluorescent marker, divided by total TUNEL-positive nuclei.\n\n\nRESULTS\nFourteen early lesions and 13 advanced lesions of tissue specimens were analyzed in this study. The mean apoptotic index of early lesions was 2.60 +/- 1.72%, which is significantly lower than that of the advanced lesions (7.42 +/- 3.07%). The apoptosis between the tapering portion and lesion portion obtained from 10 coronary endarterectomy specimens was also significantly different (2.59 +/- 1.90% vs 8.10 +/- 3.20%). In either early or advanced lesions, the predominant cell type of apoptosis was SMC.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe identical counting and quantification analytic method we designed is more accurate and quantitative than the traditional investigation in detecting and affirming the \"homeostasis\" role of apoptosis in the atherosclerotic pathogenesis process of coronary artery disease.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Modified quantitative detection of apoptosis in coronary atherosclerosis.","doi":"","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"Zhonghua yi xue za zhi = Chinese medical journal; Free China ed"}

It has also given rise to recurrent annual haze, which has had serious implications on the health of the people and the economy of the region. This thesis analyses the impacts of policy on the utilisation of peatlands in Peninsular Malaysia. It examines policies to assess if they are functioning as intended and explores why some appear to be failing to fulfil their objectives. Influenced by the Public Policy Analysis and the Institutional Resource Regime frameworks, the thesis describes the main uses, the users and actors of peatland management in Peninsular Malaysia and the related policies (as well as regulations). It also discusses the implementation of the resource regime, using the North Selangor Peat Swamp Forest, the Southeast Pahang Peat Swamp Forest and the Ayer Hitam Forest Reserve in Johor as three case study sites. Key ecosystem services provided by peatlands and peat swamp forests in Peninsular Malaysia and their rivalries are highlighted, as well as gaps in policy for peatland management. Attempts that have been made to regulate the rivalries and gaps, and institutional mechanisms set up for collaborative cooperation are also discussed. My results suggest that the public policy implementation modalities of peatland management in Peninsular Malaysia and their effect on sustainability is dependent on the relations between the Federal State and the federated states, as well as on the weak endowment in action resources of politico-administrative actors in charge of policy implementation. It also concludes that peatland management in Peninsular Malaysia is a simple regime where a limited number of the goods and services provided by peatlands and peat swamp forests are regulated in a coordinated way. However this has meant that many of the actual uses are unregulated, leaving a large scope of manoeuvre for individual exploitation and the avoidance of the constraints needed if policy is to be implemented successfully.","inCitations":["5676f42ae7393e0b4a94594b97f1b63f2391652a"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Peat resource management in Peninsula Malaysia : connections between policy and practice","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

In particular, we focus on the case when the densities $h_1$ and $h_2$ have singularities, but $1/h_1$ and $1/h_2$ are still integrable on $[0, 1]$. Under both Gaussian and sub-Gaussian errors, we construct an adaptive wavelet estimator that attains asymptotically near-optimal convergence rates that deteriorate as long-memory strengthens. The convergence rates are completely new and depend on a balance between the smoothness and the spatial homogeneity of the unknown function $f$, the degree of ill-posed-ness of the convolution operator, the long-memory parameter in addition to the degrees of spatial irregularity associated with $h_1$ and $h_2$. Nevertheless, the spatial irregularity affects convergence rates only when $f$ is spatially inhomogeneous in either direction.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.00478v2.pdf","http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1912.00478"],"title":"Anisotropic Functional Deconvolution for the irregular design with dependent long-memory errors.","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Similarly, in split-phase induction motor (SPIM) drives also, addition of such a zero-sequence signal to each set of three-phase sinusoidal modulating waves leads to reduction in total harmonic distortion (THD) in a motor current. However, the above method known as double zero-sequence injection pulse width modulation (DZIPWM) is significantly inferior to four-dimensional 24-sector space vector pulse width modulation (4D24SEC PWM) in terms of THD. This paper investigates and attempts to determine the zero-sequence signal, if any, whose injection could result in a harmonic performance comparable to that of 4D24SEC PWM. Such a zero-sequence signal is determined and is shown to be quite different from that used in DZIPWM. The analytical findings are used to propose a computationally efficient, carrier-based approach to implement the 4D24SEC PWM, whose implementation is otherwise highly resource intensive. The feasibility, computational efficiency, and accuracy of the proposed approach are demonstrated and validated on a 6-kW split-phase motor drive, controlled from a field programmable gate array platform. This paper enables good harmonic performance of the split-phase drive with low computational effort and resources.","inCitations":["18cd6ed5a8df0ea796a21cafa180b246b1a583ad","76bdedbe23dc4881c3b010532a5b95c943555a49","2fa8bd8fc857cfa48a20388c06e54c4125ae9ee7","54301edcf005ce60fa82a47bec2b50ae79042b35","9792529696fc9679b70a7a5f6b0e12459c07b9c5","e3af305190e77db6e6906c134f536312f0016735"],"pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2016.2643620"],"title":"Investigation on Zero-Sequence Signal Injection for Improved Harmonic Performance in Split-Phase Induction Motor Drives","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2016.2643620","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2016.2643620","venue":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics"}

Mice were divided into naive, sham, neuropathy control (NP) and NP + drugs groups. Neuropathic pain was evaluated by cold plate test after two weeks operation. The antiallodynic effects of TR and AG were assessed. Nitric oxide precursor L-arjinin (LA), nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitors L-NAME, L-NMMA and 7-NI were used to investigate the role of nitric oxide in these effects. Lastly, the combined effects of TR and AG was determined. Results: According to the results of experiments, TR and AG, developed neuropathy in mice showed the antiallodynic effects by extending cold plate latency (CPL). LA did not changed the effects of TR and AG. All NOS inhibitors enhanced the antiallodynic effect of TR while only L-NAME enhanced the effect of AG. The combined use of TR and AG showed greater antiallodynic effect than the effects of individual drugs. Conclusion: According to findings, TR and AG are promising drugs for treatment of NP and combined use of these drugs may be more effective. The role of inhibition of NOS in the antiallodynic effects of these two drugs were different in extent and the other possible mechanisms beside NOS inhibition may involve in the effects of these two drugs.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Farelerde Oluşturulan Deneysel Nöropatik Ağrıya Karşı Tramadol ve Agmatinin Etkilerinde Nitrerjik Sistemin Rolü","doi":"10.17826/cutf.37615","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.17826/cutf.37615","venue":""}

Estudio bibliografico estructurado de los trabajos sobre adecuacion en relacion con las CF publicados en la bibliografia biomedica (PubMed, Embase, Indice Medico Espanol y revision de las referencias de los articulos encontrados). Analisis metodologico y sintesis cualitativa. Resultados. La evidencia disponible sobre el diagnostico y manejo de las CF es escasa. Salvo la relacionada con la medicacion preventiva de recurrencias, el resto de los criterios de evaluacion se basa en la opinion de expertos o metodos de consenso. Se han identificado ocho articulos que reflejan los siguientes problemas: uso insuficiente o excesivo de anticonvulsionantes en las crisis, realizacion injustificada de punciones lumbares, analiticas sanguineas, estudios de neuroimagen o electroencefalogramas, y prescripcion de tratamientos preventivos en CF simples. La calidad metodologica de los trabajos revisados es escasa y su heterogeneidad impide la sintesis cuantitativa. Conclusiones. El manejo de las CF en la infancia se debe revisar, ya que una parte importante de las decisiones de la practica clinica (tratamiento de la crisis convulsivas, actitud tras el episodio convulsivo, pruebas diagnosticas posteriores) no siempre se sustenta en una evidencia cientifica valida.

This model describes planar motions of mobile agents, where each agent can interact with all the agents within a circle of a constant radius, and can furthermore interact with some distant agents to reach a pre-assigned number of neighbors, if needed. Some sufficient conditions imposed only on system parameters and agent initial states are presented, which ensure achieving synchronization of the whole group of agents. It reveals the intrinsic relationships among the interaction range, the speed, the initial heading, and the density of the group. Moreover, robustness against variations of interaction range, density, and speed are investigated by comparing the motion patterns and performances of the hybrid metric-topological interaction model with the conventional metric-only and topological-only interaction models. Practically in all cases, the hybrid metric-topological interaction model has the best performance in the sense of achieving highest frequency of synchronization, fastest convergent rate, and smallest heading difference.","inCitations":["5a0bb8eaa88dec2f3ba41298faa694c3b183934e","e34677bb8b5d4b3588676a7a975060841d58df6b","81fcec310d79d3790a4c83788ff465522d1374a7","4baf52b8bc898d77123ed9ced026e8626d323dba"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Synchronization of multi-agent systems with metric-topological interactions.","doi":"10.1063/1.4955086","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1063/1.4955086","venue":"Chaos"}

Allocations for resources such as main memory can be very different depending on whether the workload type is Online Transaction Processing (OLTP) or Decision Support System (DSS). In this paper, we present an approach to automatically identifying a DBMS workload as either OLTP or DSS. We build a classification model based on the most significant workload characteristics that differentiate OLTP from DSS, and then use the model to identify any change in the workload type. We construct a workload classifier from the Browsing and Ordering profiles of the TPC-W benchmark. Experiments with an industry-supplied workload show that our classifier accurately identifies the mix of OLTP and DSS work within an application workload.","inCitations":["d792f82fc9b7bcbf4c17a934e9de8dbad705b1da","0e75e0383a55b4cd3b4b8422494a4e4e5a2e3602","120537b54fe3068433201ddf6f0610410f7c729b","08a737785e4343b041d7d3d36e11e856c7a634cf","420374434e6c13ae1c59662e8b401354162bff39","8effc3bad876ae132611a2418f57d9ce6da7e9eb","848611c81dd9fc46419e077182299009f195ce2f","7c95787746bbe89d926be44a3343dffa0008422a","2093545bf09328d75ce5ca9677e0807582e9b484","571dfebdd39ad5c7f379a216d47062a69c1f542e","f6d4639664df6a9d6ec88d1dfdee7f88a294a909","c44567997e60d1e51b828b72c27e92471a488c73","2fa817ae0adc71715c4bbbba4bd15172b92ecc45","bf2e7437433225af85905722bf1fd3f68ec618a6","836e0ddc3e87fb3eca7fe6f131d9a0e2e6fd3d17","05ea5170154f7db60f419d83c87d97182dcb075e","0c83c34a4de24c1f24d8c097491c22a2f08ce86f","12a911fa2c9babc1d91368a8fde757c4f8a282c1","f2129db63c298aecd9a587bd25ef8fbbd915d2d9","b560c1b6aee67e4bf330dc75d3881bff5e096cd0","c9abee45cb61d975540fed23507192c6a3a56dfd","f72d4ccd7f064cc3c0b1a65b4ccb79c5d3fbd2db","fafa332e5f58357f2b27cc7327ab8743cca49260","0aab47b8273377ca963041420ac66e08f2e07db3","86da6a1bf62ce8c94252c7772246f20106d8caf2","057ed3d43281c580ebf03bd890619ca4742ecbdb","8dec78829665422bc028b1a7b2b1f23fff828356","2b6ea71d521837863fd3a5de34836f30551f99db","ac30c6911dcf5c9c42aaeb25a92fe96e3a17e744","d89d745a0390a6fcf850443b63db1532cbe4ae0f","ea51261588c39303717f777a52a4899684b523d6","efd25150468aa6a15cff8a9137dea9668cdbf044","37d543efda665556815dc45af537a3400fb106c7","dc992ba96a60a8ab81f9e12bdb884a46c6f553e9","f06047b27c620c1bbef69f5d8c053d3ac9104fb0","11286db2f27b2c7a4196a9e214c4de12d8759bac","aec35acb3bb03d27a9f3029377949130381eaeb4","5d50fff28e2068e550214da8a7eed00178453bf6","c36ae6940ddfd3e5e26311fca6a95745b598ae6e","0026734bb061eea31f20794147834a44030f4151","cfd78675bba62bbbcf39bc1a12024d34a92854c1","e04974bf66aa5840d5163b6bf04cc49cff89c752","fec2758531f3e0ad4d2e928c522641a6381d06bb","1d2107c8a2db5a33150f9c38e2187ca208600087"],"pdfUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Said_Elnaffar/publication/2559425_Automatically_Classifying_Database_Workloads/links/00b4951dc330a21c92000000.pdf","http://www.cs.queensu.ca/home/elnaffar/Publications/cikm2002.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/584792.584898"],"title":"Automatically classifying database workloads","doi":"10.1145/584792.584898","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1145/584792.584898","venue":"CIKM '02"}

But the AC usage in the home has no restriction. The controlling of device is done by manually, that is we using remote and off it on nearby the device. Nowadays the energy consumption has a greater need. And also the manual overhead is also there, this is because of the continuous on and off of AC. So to minimize the energy consumption, manual power etc, a new AC automatic control system was introduced. This is a system which works on a schedule base. Also we can control the AC using a laptop through Wi-Fi. Through the system we can give schedules and according to that the AC can be on and off. We can give daily or weekly schedules. And also a instant ON and OFF of AC. Through a button we can send the time of laptop to the system attached to the AC through a relay. Also a Wi-Fi router is attached to the system for a wifi access. Thus the full system will help to facilitate a full-fledged automatic AC control.

Subjects were given problems to solve requiring the application of rules to the statements or trees. In the first experiment, response latency was less for subjects seeing trees than for those seeing statements. It was also found that latency increased as the problems became more difficult. In the second experiment, response latencies for subjects seeing no rules were less on difficult problems than for subjects working with rules involving English and nonsense kinship terms. This difference disappeared with practice. These findings provided support for an account of diagram interpretation based on the facilitation of search and computation through the spatial arrangement of concepts.","inCitations":["cd223c48d73e88cf04cf59c27846bafe41164f8d","b9002f53bf021a2f8ce21d9e52de0adfe282e70d","10e2efc647a659c74e6a4368984f48d08b55aacc","0041cd343828c6a92c8c6d6d4aecb53d17b8cf43","c994470d6cec2f047f473fe86dcba13daa6c9a5d","dacb02562e31e82f115aff5dd721f4f121464a31","c9f4862d32f4c2bb943d61f6cb899d8c56ba850e","663b94489cb98b669852bc7fcc049ef74f3a9811","ad8bd4b525e381c275ce2d45db21a4c16f18bd04","4958f799dfa3cfe8671c2c1c93f33441b067799b","8514c8e5611de52e8eeaabbfc2616262685ab23e","f45d421bf0a52b5ac5f8dd71a418f405351f646f","af756f3168f1c2d1750392b703d33afae342658d","6e1a04d0fe8d0ce19296bc1df7bc1fb36dcf31d9","8b7d7635bf51cbc28f6cec0a8064782c69db4548","95cfddb849f19eddb8dbfac018f7c34c0c3d883d","74a348bb2004676cdb770b04d96328dc529d97a4","950692357274470c3b3fc1fcaff0d8e3d81ef01d","23dce3574849cb9e196680c4b4c6f843a796bfa5","1d8d91e4f65d0befc759647560fa93a4cd16cf60","b93d5932268ddb9d09c7dace86cd5038feb7df44","86a67c55140b49715cdb2fb9840a5b389c196d04","19f7f499d60bdd45876335fd2462d0d6a829fb14","9cc156dc507f219479f406b10ea2302fe244855e","df6e6a7781e45fbb7be0a089a618f8180f71fec6","ca96efc2932aeeffc4f6dc2154a1f712bf9ec451","8641ad4a89b47ac1b5522088090c5f0afd871602","efab05b7f0802a843033427b4af1b4b1cbd53b84","6d15afaa048876bbc31ffa40a00df7efe02f4841","679575e8a930ed5c1f50e691615bb52df584242b"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Diagrams as aids to problem solving: Their role in facilitating search and computation","doi":"10.1007/BF02298104","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/BF02298104","venue":""}

In comparison with single population GP and traditional multi-population GP, HFC-GP showed a more competitive performance in preventing premature convergence.

Isso dificultava a integracao e comunicacao entre os mesmos, uma vez que a maioria possuia protocolos especificos e em muitos casos proprietarios. A norma IEC 61850 visa padronizar a comunicacao entre sistemas e dispositivos em subestacoes eletricas e tem como objetivo principal garantir a interoperabilidade entre IEDs (Dispositivos Eletronicos Inteligentes) de diferentes fabricantes.Entretanto, a norma nao e simplesmente um protocolo novo. A norma especifica o IED, a arquitetura de rede, como as informacoes devem ser armazenadas e disponibilizadas, os servicos disponiveis, alem de definir varios aspectos como velocidade, novas funcionalidades entre outros que disponibilizam ao usuario um verdadeiro universo de possibilidades. Percebe-se que ainda existe falta de conhecimento dos requisitos da norma IEC 61850 por grande parte dos profissionais da area. Neste trabalho serao apresentadas as principais possibilidades sugeridas pela norma visando fornecer aos profissionais da area adquirir um conhecimento que permita desenvolver projetos de acordo com os requisitos definidos na mesma.

Envisaged from the perspective of Karl Deutsch, communication channels are objects that have meaning in the construction of the Cameroonian state. The link between circulation and political integration overturns the enchanting vision of the state, and removes the substantialist, naturalist and fixist vision of the concept of a Cameroonian state brandished by many as a totem or repeated compulsively as an obvious fact, without it being possible to clearly define its content, functions or existence. The aim is therefore to extend the understanding of the state beyond its classical reference frameworks (elites, political parties, political institutions, etc.) which alone do not suffice. Reflection on political integration thus takes place from more practical questions of the circulation and the construction of communication channels, and of the physical integration of the territory. We discover that the tendency for dichotomy between spaces of “hard state territorialisation” and “soft state territorialisation” entail the fragmentation of the Cameroonian “we” and the bricolage of the construction of the Cameroonian nation state.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Dialectic of the Empty and the Full in the Construction of State Order in Cameroon","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

This reactor had been designed for both electricity generation and nuclear thermal propulsion purposes to deliver a thermal thrust of {approximately}5000 N by a specific impulse of 670 s at a hydrogen exit temperature of {approximately}1900 K. For this nuclear thermal thrust, the total energy generation was calculated at {approximately}10.44 kW(thermal). On the other hand, during the power mode, energy generation is {approximately}640 kW(thermal) with power levels of {approximately}50 kW. Because a thermionic reactor is a very compact critical assembly, it has an extremely high neutron leakage. Reactor control can, elegantly, be performed through the manipulation of the radial neutron leakage with the help of the rotating reflector drums containing B{sub 4}C segments. Because the neutron capture reaction in {sup 10}B is exothermic, the control drums will be producing nuclear heat during reactor operations under neutron irradiation. While the heat generation in the reflector control drums may be low and may not require a heat removal system during the power phase, a cooling system for the boronated drums may be needed during the thrust phase.

In adults, it can be shown that dietary oligosaccharides can improve calcium absorption. The present analysis was performed to evaluate a possible influence of dietary oligosaccharides on parameters of calcium metabolism in preterm infants. The concentrations of calcium and phosphorus in plasma and in spot urine samples as well as the plasma activity of the alkaline phosphatase were measured in preterm infants fed either a standard formula (n = 15) or a formula supplemented with dietary oligosaccharides (n = 15) at the end of a 4-wk feeding period.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThere was no influence of the different diets on the plasma concentration of calcium and phosphorus or on the plasma activity of alkaline phosphatase. In urine, there was a tendency towards higher calcium concentrations in the group fed the supplemented formula compared concentrations in the group fed the standard formula. The concentrations of phosphate were not significantly different and, as a consequence, there was a tendency towards a higher Ca/P molar ratio in the group fed the supplemented formula. The data indicate that the calcium absorption might be influenced by the dietary oligosaccharides. Thus, the possible effect of dietary oligosaccharides on calcium homeostasis should be included in the discussion concerning the consequences of the use of dietary oligosaccharides in preterm infant nutrition.","inCitations":["55586e7b6be1d9399019f1da7890438db91a053e","90eedd1f0470d7720ee2bd0dfc4a327b97717db2","f5789fcc117e8b5bc1a1015b487d221b3fe47e41","7f63b2ed6161d52dd4233d3a4b82b3223aba0f13","aedfa2836834926f34da6dbc3ebcdc14decd2aef","f317104f22b10f6c0eb0964b3bdd0ff6da44926a","9955f4cfe429aa0a4aca90526fd78ba63ac65ea6","32623ebf6915d47492f745f2f746a4b6ecada9fe","f06b5e1c422daa2c47a8f724a39aec8d3d268963","c8623a16f2a3f1ec65f271d699212aa87f4aa0e0","06848efe856551cf3005a08e3d75eaddc56a3508","a96e878dac38ac1b3c1af44b36955179a55950d0"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Oligosaccharides might stimulate calcium absorption in formula-fed preterm infants.","doi":"10.1111/j.1651-2227.2003.tb00654.x","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1651-2227.2003.tb00654.x","venue":"Acta paediatrica (Oslo, Norway : 1992).

Methods: The questionnaire was administered to 228 students in two nursing colleges. Collected data were analyzed using t-test, ANOVA with scheff’e test, and stepwise multiple regression. Results: In this study, nursing students health literacy 14.37 ± 2.00, self-care agency was 158.10 ± 26.62 points, health promotion behavior were 145.67 ± 35.10 points. This result was higher than the previous study. The subjects’ health literacy had a significant positive correlation with self-care agency (r = 0.60, p< 0.001), a significant positive correlation with health promoting behavior (r = 0.25, p< 0.001), and self-care agency had a significant positive correlation with health promoting behavior (r = 0.39, p< 0.001). Regression analysis to identify factors affecting the health promoting behavior showed that self-care agency was the most significant factor (p= 0.001), followed by health literacy (p= 0.048). In the regression analysis, self-care agency and health literacy were significant predictors and explained 23.0% (p< 0.001) of health promoting behavior. Conclusions: Results of this study have suggested that self-care agency and health literacy were significantly related to health promoting behavior in nursing college students. Therefore, in order to improve the health promoting behaviors of nursing college students, it is necessary to improve the health literacy and self-care agency, and the systematic education strategy and education program should be developed and applied.","inCitations":["73b3d3d8fa9ae45539b6537f93557057cff48d0e"],"pdfUrls":["https://e-jhis.org/upload/pdf/jhis-43-2-126.pdf"],"title":"Influence of Health Literacy and Self-care Agency on Health Promotion Behavior in Nursing Students","doi":"10.21032/jhis.2018.43.2.126","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.21032/jhis.2018.43.2.126","venue":""}

The application of the fluorescent antibody technique (FAT) coupled with the impaction of contaminated air onto glass slides affords a rapid and specific method for the identification of air-borne Pasteurella tularensis. Early experiments presented problems of cross-reaction with organisms other than P. tularensis. These cross-reactions are eliminated by specific adsorption and proper dilution of the conjugate. A series of experiments conducted under rigidly controlled laboratory conditions indicates that fewer than ten viable P. tularensis per slide can be detected by this method. Time of impaction as well as the presence of large concentrations of other microorganisms did not alter this number. Calculations indicate that a concentration as low as one viable organism per 5 liters of air can be detected.","inCitations":["a17815d2eee4b325eaa4ca22b23d658656ea5444"],"pdfUrls":["http://aem.asm.org/content/9/6/585.full.pdf"],"title":"Detection of air-borne Pasteurella tularensis using the fluorescent antibody technique.","doi":"10.1128/aem.9.6.585-587.1961","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1128/aem.9.6.585-587.1961","venue":"Applied microbiology"}
