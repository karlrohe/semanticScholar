A comprehensive parametric study is reported and effects of such significant variables as air compressor pressure ratio, evaporator temperature, the pinch point temperature difference in the evaporator and degree of the superheat at the ORC turbine inlet on the exergy efficiency, rate of produced hydrogen and sustainability index of the proposed system investigated. Using direct search method by the EES software, the combined system is optimized to achieve the maximum exergy efficiency. It is observed that the rate of produced hydrogen decreases with an increase in superheating degree of ORC turbine and takes the maximum value with change in evaporator temperature. Under the base condition, the corresponding cost values for the power, steam and produced hydrogen are 4.811 cents/kWh, 20.56 $/ton, and 3.967 $/kg H 2 , respectively. Moreover, under the optimized condition, exergy efficiency, rate of the produced hydrogen and sustainability index of the proposed cogeneration system is 52.09%, 8.723 kg/hour and 2.162, respectively.","inCitations":["37445a6e3c262602c371e3a667acfc2f419c4eed","58fb06f30329ac0c39bc71ad776c2394c5419b03","cba19f26f099c2aa1f877df39107e463769ea619","a065bb8d85ba3873ca9429705269f86edeb555e5","3d3422c7dd39dae8e7c3b09f2e47682a331812f3","fba321310dd076a7b46e1b82a6837f576735aaf6","b7576133e16eb9e1e94b89201bb14f4927fdd965","5de7f642813b08d06a3292798052a516490df171"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Analysis of a gas turbine based hybrid system by utilizing energy, exergy and exergoeconomic methodologies for steam, power and hydrogen production","doi":"10.1016/j.enconman.2017.04.020","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2017.04.020","venue":""}

This fast a posteriori error sequential technique (FAEST) requires 5p MADPR (multiplications and divisions per recursion) for AR modeling and 7p MADPR for LS FIR filtering, where p is the number of estimated parameters. In contrast the well-known fast Kalman algorithm requires 8p MADPR for AR modeling and 10p MADPR for FIR filtering. The increased computational speed of the introduced algorithm stems from an alternative definition of the so-called Kalman gain vector, which takes better advantage of the relationships between forward and backward linear prediction.","inCitations":["76a1bde0f932f0bf59780ecdb7dd99a30571bb74","ace3e094ea2ea6c46dfbe8558f180800ad0302cb","2c4eb937d381a0ec38efddbed625947b88817bd0","056a0d2c816cb199d35bf770d8596cd454ffedcd","db9f023915a8e14025ba05a959e74147ffeac943","d52d47754a6ef2650c9ac52b9066fb39054e218a","904867c492c6b032356a60d7441ba7e64ff17e84","b237a764487adbc991cfc3f6ab82919d1dc326ed","c62e48f9d7bf50e475b8b53b88a5c7f1d1b0f2d3","800caebff15814460138f2744578a6124cea4d15","ad3295c5bbe198526a007fbf92f6d93ea8c71415","dfb8c83c5c1ee3f46b0690bba4543eeb8c859424","1d0ea3bf8794eacedf7ef2107c84b958a02c9894","611bc431010ef8ec43bbdf211cbc8a16dfc055ce","507891693415433da752fa06a6272486ad7794cd","02fa7009c7ececb8a58e17e69f24b0a5c6e3cab7","d413e8acd042ad27098bba11bbf03b27fc135644","afe0261c97e6b5f67086d5e5ecf9db8d0313c279","fb8ccb98edd9ca627e807d55d582ecaa3cacce37","23edbfe4e73be1c066e4f53fdca1800b1d2a59c9","64777d416540bf9e88896d5dd082121819783b3c","7615d9d3e2673a8e548cacdec471df68bb189860","f32465479e073ed5e6cc245219e842c727440816","db891062732c399106673b7520ec4d792679f6f7","a287680cd23ae4923ccdca7f6904050f226b6745","7535fa23cff5f00258a40b289c37de32ab159139","97891f031e217a2625f3279d5c5f58d4985b092f","8ce5447a868292f9ddec7f318058f0313d964f1b","734d6f808c4436f4590de889fe0c6ffbdcd1fc13","9d75344116e0d5070f3a012460d1e9121613b7d9","effed72ac4222c5594d2f385e37fb9288b6662ef","fe6fccf6b24c2d5f49eb182eb49c58bd852ddb08","219cbc2c5864b19774d7eacdffabed17d6919851","15047a485fbb425bb1be54cab7f2cc88c5078242","57163b9ada1152349245294f6c40277bf42fd3c0","9da5ad08d1541b6b268505a5ad8363e7805288ec","2694d0cee3fd7558fb2a1ccb92166efbd2d0dfe6","4c3d2dd47ccc98240399fbb2b030c2f413a6a27d","2718db7e6111a058b1547a4dc94a1c965f0dcf0e","9fc270b76a429a325b063ac43358b24537d70d5a","552239b72568cf28eb246bdfd9973a1cecbcfe9a","7ac67e0e7b4617d47bf16120db0ad98721e54f32","50033056fba726518e1195598646073c956b1185","62cfeeeeb1e00a08fa19c0391a1a4d2e124d1c0d","25e6285cdea332b597faa43a5abcebeb86f8581e","fccbbfb2b32d0c9a29b50cfd9faf47fdb21d431a","fc627548056d340aaa8ac772e153a95aa4056473","a8e54b7bc0836f472805c274bd10af452d27a719","8bb7a47e7edf8c2099f7e68b68076059e368365f","a04d9aea1da9ba2b813f57b05c96e18dcaf264f7","93d352060334a42fcbe9a7db5c237fb76299c9f2","ebedf24d757eebb81f3357ff2cba344ff9baf8f5","6b292ccfa1efaab8a7d65be7b8634d648e267e54","c74676a800b04e755dd2d6e8d5f02debdccad5e1","f6051494c4e571b9ffe31fdaad7bd13c6692b3aa","5509a449fbe94e7d9c48590f74e2b0bc4d98e4c8","5c4a60674190c2215d1ec6bfbb314a55d8e624a5","62fb79fc0a7738b383348cb9be8a33c26121a4da","6af02e3381b44a934c68ba2e2cfce7d6e3fc0937","74e2530f7579d0267eaca7d233377fd2d41fb267","d92962e360dac76b1f26fd9968f9f76a1c5765fb","74b1b72a5891ee26dd3e2f071a8eb0284c2ec44f","de83079c1cef7f614f765c3ba193db510a672490","3f68244239db747e5475b390bddba22e9fad6243","1e54a9168ffebae3f4b42f61f28849ee93749a65","e1dd200a86a4eb1e003e0854afaad53fb04d3e1f","d8a5a639c32ce6e7234606fa5b5f624a3d5aebff","109302f99b9f0a9f38a7409a9d019bc0490d6251","1eea96b248736e8566dd608db89d01a03a8f085c","7fb0f0c4ea40a2dd6d575966444cb88694ad008a","3cfd069dfe552f09367c116a8e115e574191ba73","230dca9ad25722769618d134097c80e9722e4c72","a27bbbbed83e94a08d40289fe2810aa623583048","65c4afeb9948213590aeea5e096eb9eac2904aed","aaef12d3733f40a9347e3e98e13347e73a366d67","7cf6a38e47d696eedf870b36c6755b2bd5204688","b331520276d599e4d727e7d2c8dac72b8405a0fd","a3ec91f8ce4bda831263c115f9957eeb8249ba71","7d09aa7a3241596fcafc711b0d7ce22a0d51fe20","f4fd1d582b82e5e4512f9918fe314216530c178e","103365740478994a12630c71448ff689bdc79531","5641bc7d9be3c583a4b1552f9279a2dcce4738e0","7d661ae23df6fe6681e227632337ae28b1c80fb0","8d08da5c98c117cda4ae63eb8bd35210f67d2cc8","161d01d631dc5c9c008de0b797b2721befbaa138","083fc787ab27bbec41bc55adecfe8c90ed781a8c","e54edb1945935a40d1bf89637c024cfb32984db2","c0238ee53e63438542b9a9e4b6a776461fcba2e0","8914cb7ab37d651707516eae4521ac35e4fc8831","39582a84b7873492ce6b80657d0e8f16bbb11abb","bf25ff1b67d0bae1214f2cff27061f493582e922","eba2a52ec114882c91e672ade7c749dd0b9de294","00fdb7eb0cf810cf6a10b6bed98b17d7c4ba7c89","e7e2055c4d5cb3c9277b46d99cbabcc649131a1d","563f84a4ab143c4bfa6e1cb69b59955fcaaf1846","872640527a61ced4987994b82da69ffe8a3d8cdb","3b4f64aec6675dd2ef31121d7afa1ee0062d0292","b354da3efd5117c8d156d1d740086637cee8bdb6","9b8a7102b4b9cd9ee12f310a1a84753c476e97c5","0934f04f5a8b1093d6db98129e74c5ad8aed3440","d035c77f71f0e45807a091394fa1f1fb85fa8c08","53bc3b7789797a0992e1d9b634ad14cce088b05c","a7a460aebaea4d74b457026e3f6522cd58cb5a81","fbd696b790349cf5d3dab6d2cf3c6bbd995b74df","40981823c0c838f6d37a4a7e47a65a576fdd7249","bb69047127556bcaed51dbe5d62b781521a91adb","1d62e88f62102ca5df76d1e70775161cb8ce8d18","6bae44ec8d29cde38a4362bc5f66aa99f6a44f54","0d64f9169e70378d58dd6783393cdccef3f5fd08","15c7f4d89c36ce667307d31be68d97975bdff14a","e1909169b4b0ed2f051eafebce1c0cb020191dcd","8edab096444585630b94f0e172e72f1e87082d03","7952bc8c623618d13aeb42c485e3b51e1d1afea1","03d5ff7ae7f1616b02351b3e76966755a7545794"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"A

These nanotubes are used for loading and sustained release of corrosion inhibitors. The inhibitor is kept inside the particles infinitely long under dry conditions. Here, halloysite nanotubes filled with anticorrosive agents are embedded into a SiOx–ZrOx hybrid film. An aluminum plate is dip-coated and immersed into 0.1 M sodium chloride aqueous solution for corrosion tests. A defect in the sol–gel coating induces pitting corrosion on the metal accompanied by a strong anodic activity. The inhibitor is released within one hour from halloysite nanotubes at corrosion spots and suppresses the corrosion process. The anodic activity is successfully restrained and the protection remains for a long time period of immersion in NaCl water solution. The selfhealing effect of the sol–gel coating doped with inhibitor-loaded halloysite nanotubes is demonstrated in situ via scanning vibrating electrode technique measurements.","inCitations":["ca0d445018a84416e2fa581ee6614c044e7739e0","3bbc9fb53f9b211bde0ef27da6112cb82181f53e","567968234a4464f2e6a7119813d53db4a60a6587","cb6d37a2f2fc89b5bc97f4fc4903fe66662ce6ad","48cc43982c9c514696557c40a6f877a566b47882","5d9a3e511b4bd1bb670f3aac18e413c691bb6ee8","996e50bf94c61cd6e514b6636994376524d05db4","4aca586a7e68b61ed1dbc751882e4feba1ff9eef","d7a580960f634de75568d30e079782aa127c6e69","a8a0ebdc3a38c41860adce26a73719e90797bedd","651001ab5958144c2f161f9a2d2b74cc9915c352","977eee3995dd3f5d7af9921edc09ba5f13509628","ccf7bc76409f907c9818ecf919a0f9c7ae226065","0ac5c6d1e55bae089dc39b349c927de5c10d62b1","1b8b381c0386bd39dfc29a482e87ae93055c98df","6d85ed47e739b3ce434da6da23d40ee6448d0fce","9a2dc87f634dac24683b6aa87beed7ee5e764267","31386f2adabfd3fa62c8650045c908795f3e5bf8","0e792bad8251483c4d9e052a615b73f8b64c48a1","fb549acd36aae1f9de17a0ab5b4b22040880fa81","ba567db454e0a3bebd596b0354246142a6818252","ea08e35f5cd1a0c577a432d3d272d80aa448e925","496e10ba3feb5e727e2fd3e6aa9b7aaa4d94b7df","ead9816be6664e110629a9ad9ed209536bb16096","d7677d205492031dba68a7884f7e0c7797ccdb13","c897b02147def70b6395ff738677a3b4e4410b71","1210186bb5298765ed0711bb7a2f9225652bdace","b935aa1c737fb9d735f9725b7a860274a80e4282"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Application of Inhibitor‐Loaded Halloysite Nanotubes in Active Anti‐Corrosive Coatings","doi":"10.1002/adfm.200800946","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1002/adfm.200800946","venue":""}

This discourse encourages, and is encouraged by, economic rationales for behavior and is marked by the collapse of many complex societal roles into the simpler category of \"customer.\" Moreover, practices emergent from consumerism and economic rationalism often act as organizational and social defences against anxieties about the uncertainties and changes occurring in a world increasingly dominated by global markets where the customer is \"sovereign.\" Six working hypotheses are proposed to explain the operation of these new social defences. Evidence in support of these hypotheses comes from collaborative action research projects in which the author is involved. The argument moves toward a consideration of the new \"consumer-provider pair\" which, it is proposed, has become a major signifier within the consumer discourse and which might be considered as a transitional pair in dealing with widespread ...","inCitations":["6543a3d9866c2778a26853ac4e662cc3ea26ad03","93fc1bb8361e62fcce5c3894052dc0d804c0e7db","7bee021bcc77cb8466a01e303d02adbd8b35b733","cc8b5c5f6f98cc59a5562d8ed636f5ca2e8cf229","8590f5ca03b8c57dd1839d7ef6036dddfe746912","61d12f1ab4f48d72569a1225c0c714142f32cc52","f52ce04010128a736fcb752271bd4dac3454ee6c","c80498dc1709f99687ec5145b19d501f2e758e88","e76d1c1da46f531f5bd110bcdd250765a130c286","f9c7f360d52d8f8cf9e7e0c9a0ef405305b44454","da6f13409842b18b20df763039211b955bedb3e8","70fa627a3f1f895376f7356691b48fe6088448c9","c73c4250ca8b514a6f3f692dc9c496c48af571ab"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"The Tyranny of the Customer and the Cost of Consumerism: An Analysis Using Systems and Psychoanalytic Approaches to Groups and Society","doi":"10.1177/001872679905200603","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1177/001872679905200603","venue":""}

Simultaneously, a methodology is structured in order to optimize step by step the thermal performance of the reference building aiming to net zero energy or even to surplus energy. This methodology could be used as a guide for building engineers and designers for future projects. Window-to-wall ratio, solar shading, thermal mass and ventilation strategies are the main parameters evaluated. Passive strategies comprise the main focus of the study whereas active strategies in form of PV solar panels are supplementary in order to satisfy the annual energy demand and improvise the thermal comfort of the reference model under investigation. Carbon Profiling, considering embodied energy of the materials, is included as a criterion for the final optimization. Literature review on passive building envelope strategies, case studies in the Netherlands and in Europe, Passive House standard, Energy Codes and Green Village requirements are the most important aspects that determined the procedure of this study. The base model refers to a Passive House medium weight construction. Window-to-wall ratio aspect and solar shading application are the first parameters to be evaluated. After defining the first base model, different materials as thermal mass types, combined with ventilation strategies, are compared. A final solution is chosen as a proposal for the Green Village office for a period of ten years. The proposal is based on Passive House criteria, regarding low operational energy, embodied energy and thermal comfort. Thermal models are simulated by EnergyPlus with DesignBuilder as user-interface. The output is mainly annual heating and cooling energy demands. Artificial lighting and thermal comfort distribution are also taken into consideration.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Towards Zero Energy Office Modules through Parametric Analysis of Building Envelope Strategies: Recommendations for the Green Village","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

The present review explores and summarises total diet studies (TDS) carried out in different countries focusing on mycotoxins determination. TDS were classified by samples preparation, mycotoxins analysis and dietary exposure evaluation. Most of reviewed TDS performed multi-mycotoxins analysis in composite samples mainly, prepared taking into account local culinary habits. High performance liquid chromatography coupled with fluorescence detector was the predominant and the most sensitive technique used for determination. Ochratoxin A was the most analyzed mycotoxin, followed by trichothecenes, aflatoxins, zearalenone, fumonisins, patulin, enniatins, and beauvericin respectively. Alternaria toxins and ergot alkaloids were also included. Food commonly analyzed were cereals, meat, vegetables, fruits, nuts and beverages. The findings in food were in below the current European legislation, except for some sporadic samples of wine and milk meaning less than 1% of total analyzed samples. Dietary exposure was evaluated, through the estimated daily intake mycotoxin evaluation and risk assessment concluded that relatively scarce toxicological concern was associated to mycotoxins exposure.

The clinical effects were observed,and the serum prolactin and abdominal fat deposition were detected before treatment and at 14,28,56 d after treatment. Results After treatment,the PANSS scores were significantly low er in the four groups,there was no significant difference among the 4 groups( P 0. 05). The serum prolactin levels,subcutaneous adipose and abdominal visceral adipose in group A,group C and group D were significantly higher than those of group B( P 0. 05). M enstruation delayed rate( 4. 35%),menstrual flow reduce rate( 4. 35%),breast sw elling rate( 2. 17%) in group B were significantly low er than those of the other three groups( P 0. 05). Conclusion The effect of aripiprazole on serum prolactin and abdominal fat deposition of female psychiatric patient is slightest among the 4 drugs( risperidone,aripiprazole,sulpiride and perphenazine),it is more suitable for female patients.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Influence of different antipsychotic drugs on serum prolactin and abdominal fat deposition of female psychiatric patient","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

The basic parameter is the area geology. The existing lithological types and tectonic activity developed over them will define the aquifers, their position and interrelations, hydrochemical characteristics and the possibility of developing them. The area morphology, topography and drainage system will supply data concerning the capacity for infiltration, time of residence of the water and aquifer recharge and discharge areas. In this context, the article evaluates the hydrogeological potential, intrinsic vulnerability and hydrochemical types of the groundwater in the Serra Geral Aquifer System, used for human supply in small rural communities in pig farming areas in the Northwest of Rio Grande do Sul state. It also indicates the areas that are more or less vulnerable to contamination. The results obtained spatialize a zone in the area of the study, with a very good hydrogeological potential and low to moderate intrinsic vulnerability of the aquifer, as opposed to zones with a hydrogeological potential that varies from good to poor and moderate to high intrinsic vulnerability of the aquifer, The main RBRH — Revista Brasileira de Recursos Hídricos Volume 17 n.2 Abr/Jun 2012, 31-41 41 hydrogeochemical types identified include calcium or magnesium bicarbonated waters and sodium bicarbonated","inCitations":["6fa8d5f7eda3a3b4840f8e6460e41ce970a15c50","47a7cfedbffb91286aabf33888a750b3ad10159f","c692ab0ae49f8b6a8f9a04e8467c386f1b754e96"],"pdfUrls":["https://abrh.s3-sa-east-1.amazonaws.com/Sumarios/62/f93b94c5a99b02cca35538b253fe75f4_0963fe6ca5d6d495479f7ff6644a4e41.pdf"],"title":"Avaliação do potencial hidrogeológico, vulnerabilidade intrínseca e hidroquímica do sistema Aquifero Serra Geral no noroeste do Estado do Rio Grande do Sul","doi":"10.21168/rbrh.v17n2.p31-41","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.21168/rbrh.v17n2.p31-41","venue":""}

However in contrast to passenger cars, there has been minimal published research on sideslip estimation for articulated HGVs. State-of-the-art observers, which rely on linear vehicle models, perform poorly when manoeuvring near the limits of tyre adhesion. This paper investigates three nonlinear Kalman filters (KFs) for estimating the tractor sideslip angle of a tractor–semitrailer. These are compared to the current state-of-the-art, through computer simulations and vehicle test data. An unscented KF using a 5 degrees-of-freedom single-track vehicle model with linear adaptive tyres is found to substantially outperform the state-of-the-art linear KF across a range of test manoeuvres on different surfaces, both at constant speed and during emergency braking. Robustness of the observer to parameter uncertainty is also demonstrated.","inCitations":["879fd15a85c9afa09e7d0356456e3e126ee98bee","87a22734bc69abffa85b738e9b6ab0b674979669","49abdb1cd20c940e20557cce95d5bbb4efa11f7c","cc61e32ad0754e43014d3e8f526805879cc830ad","74c51d318a55b41a3fdcd96ba00390fed6e201b0","68c9c3672fe37cb9a3fc16b867c9fce8f0a2c53e","9bed747267fc1de8b3ee22b2c4299db1c5ba7438"],"pdfUrls":["https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/bitstream/handle/1810/260770/Morrison_et_al-2016-Vehicle_System_Dynamics-VoR.pdf;jsessionid=FE43C668E57567DE9E8237212AD56AE6?sequence=1"],"title":"Sideslip estimation for articulated heavy vehicles at the limits of adhesion","doi":"10.1080/00423114.2016.1223326","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1080/00423114.2016.1223326","venue":""}

They are absent or neglected in the literature, and generally go untreated. We report details of 24- month amputations and mortality rates in 90 patients with CLI who were not considered suitable for revascularization, treated from 2005 to 2008 in a dedicated unit of our department. Patients with endstage general conditions or needing immediate primary amputation were excluded from our study. All patients received multidisciplinary assessment. Their median age was 78.4 years; 28 patients (31.1%) had rest pain only, and 62 (68.8%) had ischemic skin foot-leg wounds or gangrene <2 cm. Sixteen patients (37.7%) were assessed as not suitable for revascularization because of poor functional status, and 76 (64.4%) because of inadequate outflow limb vessels.

Under military occupation, Samoans revived kirikiti in the districts as part of broader efforts to reclaim activities restricted under German rule. In Apia, Samoans regularly played ‘English’ cricket to establish relationships with officials, while kirikiti served to entertain soldiers and ‘perform’ loyalty. Under civilian rule, Samoans gradually developed different strategies to navigate New Zealand colonialism—including on the cricket pitch. While controlling and policing kirikiti remained a fruitful means of ‘performing’ accommodation, adherents of the Mau protest movement used the game as a form of anti-colonial protest. These divergent responses demonstrate the game’s value to Samoans in the face of new and increasingly invasive—if not necessarily pervasive—forms of colonial power.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Navigating New Zealand colonialism: “more interested in playing cricket than in Samoan politics”","doi":"10.1007/978-3-030-27268-5_8","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-27268-5_8","venue":""}

In Indonesia intellectual capital has not been implemented in reality there are still many companies that do not publicly report corporate finance, that the recognition of intangible assets, other than patents, copyrights, trademarks, franchise, leasehold and goodwill has not been included in the balance sheet or even in supplement disclosure. Management of intellectual capital as an added value in the company, can be known influence on business performance or company performance. The result of hypothesis testing shows that Intellectual Capital (IC) has a significant effect on Financial Performance. Keywords: Intellectual Capital, Financial Performance. Abstrak. Penelitian ini bertujuan untuk mengetahui bagaimana perkembangan intellectual capital (IC) pada perusahaan JII, bagaimana kinerja keuangan pada perusahaan JII, bagaimana pengaruh intellectual capital terhadap kinerja keuangan perusahaan JII. Variabel independen dalam penelitian ini antara lain diukur dengan Intellectual Capital (IC). Sedangkan variabel dependen dalam penelitian ini diukur dengan Kinerja Keuangan. Untuk menguji hipotesis maka digunakan analisis regresi linier sederhana. Data yang digunakan bersumber dari laporan tahunan dari perusahaan yang bertahan dalam Jakarta Islamic Index (JII) pada tahun 2011-2015. Hasil dari penelitian menunjukan bahwa rata-rata nilai intellectual capital 36 perusahaan mengalami kecenderungan menurun . Di Indonesia intellectual capital belum diimplementasikan secara nyata masih banyak perusahaan yang tidak melaporkan keuangan perusahaan secara terbuka di media masa, bahwa pengakuan asset tak berwujud, selain paten, hak cipta, merk dagang, franchise, leasehold dan goodwill belum disertakan dalam neraca atau bahkan dalam supplement disclosure . Pengelolaan terhadap intellectual capital sebagai nilai tambah di dalam perusahaan , dapat diketahui pengaruhnya terhadap business performance atau kinerja perusahaan. Hasil pengujian hipotesis menunjukkan bahwa Intellectual Capital (IC) berpengaruh signifikan terhadap Kinerja Keuangan. Kata kunci: Modal Intelektual , Kinerja Keuangan .","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Pengaruh Intellectual Capital pada Perusahaan Jakarta Islamic Index (JII) Tahun Periode 2011-2015","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Focussing on the seasonality of decadal SST anomalies, individual heat budget analyses were conducted for the ocean mixed layer in a southern region (25°N-35°N, 175°E-145°W), and a northern region (39°N-49°N, 165°E-155°W) of the North Pacific. It was revealed that the decadal SST anomaly in the southern region, which was pronounced in winter, was significantly maintained by meridional Ekman temperature advection that occurred during November-anuary. On the other hand, the decadal SST anomaly in the northern region, which was observed in almost all months, was maintained by the sum of the effects of sensible and latent heat flux, and the net long wave radiation flux at the sea surface, and the meridional Ekman temperature transport during the period of October-ecember. In the Kuroshio extension region, which overlaps the southwest portion of the northern region, the anomalous temperature transport by entrainment in the seasonal thermocline was found to be very important for the maintenance of decadal SST anomaly.","inCitations":["644cbd3a581153227a1832c04e731a4a1b27f68b"],"pdfUrls":["https://ams.confex.com/ams/pdfpapers/21890.pdf"],"title":"Maintenance of Decadal SST Anomalies in the Midlatitude North Pacific","doi":"10.2151/jmsj.81.477","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.2151/jmsj.81.477","venue":""}

The generalization is achieved by using proper definitions of the stress and strain tensors along the curved-coordinate lines using the matrix of position vector gradients in the reference configuration. This matrix, which accurately captures the element geometry at the integration points, allows using consistent gradient transformation in the calculation of the stress and strain tensors. The generalized SSM implementation is used to verify the results and evaluate the performance of the absolute nodal coordinate formulation (ANCF) finite elements (FE). The focus of this study is on the Poisson locking that characterizes fully parameterized ANCF elements that employ different orders of interpolation in different directions. ANCF beam and plate nonlinear problems are presented, and the obtained simulation results are compared with analytical solutions as well as results obtained using commercial FE computer programs. These results are also compared with the results obtained using ANCF beam and curved plate elements in the case of nonzero Poisson ratio in order to demonstrate the SSM effectiveness in alleviating the Poisson locking. It is shown that a much smaller number of ANCF plate elements is required to achieve approximately 0.9% difference from the results of commercial FE computer programs.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Generalization of the strain-split method and evaluation of the nonlinear ANCF finite elements","doi":"10.1007/s00707-019-02558-w","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00707-019-02558-w","venue":""}

The mandatory support program, initiated in 1948, obligates the Commodity Credit Corporation to support tung oil prices to growers at a minimum 65 percent of parity or at 24.3 cents per pound in 1968. Large accumulations of CCC stocks, close to 63 million pounds in 1966, triggered a change in CCC inventory policy.","inCitations":["185b7ab708f5d56941380046ded2e1e8d33f42c5"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"An Economic Appraisal of the U.

Instead, it can be found usually as part of more general courses on software quality assurance or software engineering. Based on the feedback from the different symposia dedicated to software testing, it can be observed that good testing professionals are well sought after on the job market. The International Software Testing Qualifications Board (ISTQB) and its local organization, the Hungarian Testing Board (HTB) plays a significant role in the popularization of the software testing profession. This organization is responsible for defining various guidelines such as examination structure and regulations, accreditation, certification etc. for software testing professionals. Undoubtedly, the activity of the Hungarian Testing Board also contributed to the fact that significant improvements in the Hungarian higher education can be observed in this area. The majority of the authors of this article are also members of the organization, and the courses they teach at their institutions are all good examples of this positive change. In the talk, we will stress the importance of software testing as a profession and point to the weaknesses in this area in the Hungarian higher education system. We will then overview the structure and content of the international standard teaching curricula, and investigate the possibilities of the extension of the teaching plans in the higher education according to these international guidelines.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://www.inf.u-szeged.hu/~beszedes/research/TesztelesKepzes-JAVITOTT.pdf","http://compalg.inf.elte.hu/~attila/pub/TesztelesKepzesAFelsooktatasban.pdf"],"title":"A Szoftvertesztelés-képzés Helye a Hazai Felsőoktatásban És Kapcsolódás a Nemzetközi Standardokhoz the Software Testing Curriculum in the Hungarian Education in Conjunction with International Standards","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

They show that the number of obese patients with preoperative comorbidities has increased with time, but the percentage of patients with postoperative complications has decreased over time.According to results of their prospective survey of experienced anesthesia providers, moreover, the authors contributed their findings to improved quality of perioperative care over time. Other than the limitations described in discussion, however, we noted that when using multivariable logistic regression analyses to assess association of body mass index with the risk of overall complications after TKA, only year of surgery was adjusted, whereas some important preoperative and intraoperative risk factors affecting the occurrence of postoperative complications were not provided and adjusted. First, preoperative hemoglobin and albumin levels, and functional status of patients were not included in demographic characteristics. In fact, preoperative anemia is highly prevalent in patients undergoing TKA and has been shown as an important risk factor for early postoperative morbidity and mortality [2]. Furthermore, morbid obesity and malnutrition often are co-occurring conditions and malnutrition has been considered as a modifiable risk factor for postoperative complications of TKA patients [3].

The post-transcriptional regulation is mediated by the AU-rich element (ARE) located in the TNF-alpha mRNA 3' untranslated region (UTR), which controls its translation and stability. In resting macrophages, the ARE represses TNF-alpha mRNA translation. Activation of macrophages with various agents [for example lipopolysaccharide (LPS), viruses] results in translational derepression, leading to the production of high levels of TNF-alpha. TNF-alpha ARE has also been shown to confer mRNA instability as its deletion from the mouse genome leads to an increase in the TNF-alpha mRNA half-life [Kontoyiannis, D., Pasparakis, M., Pizzaro, T., Cominelli, F. & Kollias, G. (1999) Immunity 10, 387-398]. In this study, we measured the half-life as well as the poly(A) tail length of TNF-alpha mRNA in the course of macrophage activation by LPS. We report that TNF-alpha mRNA is short lived even in conditions of maximal TNF-alpha synthesis. Moreover, TNF-alpha mRNA is hypoadenylated in a constitutive manner. These results reveal that TNF-alpha mRNA rapid turnover does not constitute a regulatory step of TNF-alpha biosynthesis in macrophages and that TNF-alpha mRNA translational activation upon LPS stimulation is not accompanied by a change of poly(A) tail length.","inCitations":["963b9ac2d6ace4969dde3dfb1102db3499846244","2ad6b314af8748d793ee4bff7499035918922410","fc4cc563bf0807d0228c32eda3475fd440f675ac","0c27205c465548bf56859e6d13dd2acf771dade7","e2a193a65a0c617501306aa8e6dbddc0cf290678","6fbc48151fb65b5d5977880c12f62f3ac6bdb561","8961883efafb1800998e27baf99df4788781d307","69b8bb02019230711a2676f7a23f0d444598de9b","c533903cb9b1f1255c8fd728847ffce1062ec792","c156a1ae2a1a62b04bdf2b3364c7b6c7c7579ea0","23c3efb89ab142d4d740189973c5759ee95724a6","024fe3dbee48fa205c7368109cf53f0e157644a1","3277f3cfa8561ec25b9e297d7aac0e1c1f881a24","efd81e4ec6711c6c4dd9504307860a4b2ca62c4c","c3c42f1206e4ea8cd8b76f53f497b1471a63e699","877378ebbd985779453d2e079f127bbb07c76c80","5e6a49a21e79ad8d755ffc9eb4cf32f431f95183","739efd11372bb1b7c5f1251f313f04807452b17c"],"pdfUrls":["https://dipot.ulb.ac.be/dspace/bitstream/2013/50459/1/Mijatovic%202000.pdf"],"title":"Tumor necrosis factor-alpha mRNA remains unstable and hypoadenylated upon stimulation of macrophages by lipopolysaccharides.","doi":"10.1046/j.1432-1327.2000.01676.x","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1432-1327.2000.01676.x","venue":"European journal of biochemistry"}

Inhibitor of growth 4 (ING4), which is a cofactor of histone acetyltransferase (HAT) and histone deacetylase (HDAC) complexes, could negatively regulate this inflammation. However, the exact molecular signalling pathway regulated by ING4 remains uncertain. As a pivotal HDAC, the silent information regulator Sirtuin1 (SIRT1), which is widely accepted to be an anti-inflammatory molecule, has not been found to be linked to ING4. This study investigated how ING4 is involved in the regulation of inflammation by constructing lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced macrophage and mouse sepsis models. Our results revealed that ING4 expression decreased, while the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines increased in LPS-stimulated cultured primary macrophages and RAW264.7 cells. ING4 transfection was confirmed to alleviate the LPS-induced upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokine expression both in vitro and in vivo. In addition, ING4-overexpressing mice were hyposensitive to an LPS challenge and displayed reduced organ injury. Furthermore, immunoprecipitation indicated a direct interaction between ING4 and the SIRT1 protein. Moreover, ING4 could block nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) P65 nuclear translocation and restrict P65 acetylation at lysine 310 induced by LPS treatment. These results are the first to clarify that the anti-inflammatory role of ING4 is associated with SIRT1, through which ING4 inhibits NF-κB signalling activation. Our studies provide a novel signalling axis involving ING4/SIRT1/NF-κB in LPS-induced sepsis.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"ING4 alleviated lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammation by regulating the NF-κB pathway via a direct interaction with SIRT1.","doi":"10.1111/imcb.12308","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1111/imcb.12308","venue":"Immunology and cell biology"}

The mu mutant mice failed to generate anti-AChR antibodies and were completely resistant to the induction of EAMG. However, mu mutant mice developed clinical EAMG when antibodies to the AChR main immunogenic region were passively transferred. Further, the in vivo expansion of lymph node cells after AChR immunization was greatly impaired in mu mutant mice. The mu mutant mice gave an effective in vitro T cell immune response to the immunodominant pathogenic AChR alpha chain peptide 146-162 (alpha 146-162) and to the whole AChR protein when tested on day 90 after immunization with AChR, whereas the response to both AChR and its alpha 146-162 peptide was reduced when tested on day 7 after immunization. The in vitro production of IFN-gamma and IL-2 by AChR-specific and alpha 146-162 peptide-specific lymphocytes was lower in mu mutant mice. The AChR immune mu mutant T cells proliferated and produced IFN-gamma when AChR or alpha 146-162 peptide was presented by wild-type irradiated AChR-primed antigen-presenting cells (APCs). This indicates that B cells are important in the processing and presentation of AChR dominant peptide in vitro during the initial immune response to AChR. However, APCs of non-B-cell lineage are sufficient to process AChR and prime the T cells to AChR dominant T cell epitope peptides.","inCitations":["b0b0f2a8d643cbd122aad334aab7a7b9bb646bb8","d60f9fd8841d4790b2328f7a4633695ca25c8978","3786dc2b9b8588fdb9997ab21563da959d08b3b0","1ab0a9c08254184cd1a3083e4c1ffeb36c339c8d","a7ba0dc59a057a7960aa396a7a79edac752ae8fa","ce8ca4cac8b7dd21a084cbc5a4eebdecb5a91acd","8b0de32271150542d5ce2b99120acfdc9c655c0d","cbcca8eb8539fd02de89b2e17cb63ce56efeb89e"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"The effect of B cell deficiency on the immune response to acetylcholine receptor and the development of experimental autoimmune myasthenia gravis.","doi":"10.1006/clin.1998.4535","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1006/clin.1998.4535","venue":"Clinical immunology and immunopathology"}

We show that transcription driven by a -714/+78-base pair DNA fragment of the erythroid promoter of the human porphobilinogen deaminase gene is down-regulated upon TPA treatment of erythroleukemic cells. Examination of the DNA binding activity of trans-acting factors involved in the expression of the porphobilinogen deaminase erythroid promoter showed (i) a constitutive expression of the CACC binding proteins and (ii) a decrease in DNA binding activity of two tissue-specific factors, NF-E1 and NF-E2. Kinetics experiments indicated that NF-E2 was down-regulated after 1 h of TPA treatment whereas NF-E1 was down-regulated at the protein and mRNA levels only after 5 h of TPA treatment. These results suggest that different pathways, acting via different transcription factors, are involved in the TPA-mediated extinction of erythroid-specific genes.","inCitations":["ed489504ce80649c72c3d1177fa00f3079f4149a","57b13fd3dedda3009d6087b388f46961bbe424f8","a232175933fa24f845794018e9adeab6f6ca568b","ca104da97abefc003729d83373790db21f8cfa8c","6020c22c9f493eec46a77af4b6ee19de2f7e0583","ba436f7573c114ba675f3191f8988a427b8aa658","3ca66354bef408bb4a3335186e6cddbdff294804","d082bdac1186b888396ab7987c531c066e89b631","3c93641268da27b9f66a4a5fc6774a9568449a8f","dcf6dd1cf405dcba6e6f44716eb1dea07a9783d3","039575350f0033c05cdfa5c7602084a3c4cc5167"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"The extinction of erythroid genes after tetradecanoylphorbol acetate treatment of erythroleukemic cells correlates with down-regulation of the tissue-specific factors NF-E1 and NF-E2.","doi":"","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"The Journal of biological chemistry"}

Z-scores were calculated with respect to expected UA-PI values in normal pregnancies after log-transformation. AC-Z-scores were calculated with respect to expected size in normal pregnancies according to a standard chart. Functional linear discriminant analysis (FLDA) was applied to generate 50(th), 5(th) and 95(th) percentile curves for changes in both AC and UA-PI with gestational age in fetuses with gastroschisis. These curves were compared with the standard curves, as were the means. UA-PI was also plotted against AC. For this relationship, a robust Spearman correlation coefficient was obtained with FLDA.\n\n\nRESULTS\nIn fetuses with gastroschisis, there was a highly significant negative correlation between UA-PI and AC, normalized for gestation using Z-scores (median correlation coefficient, - 0.289; median P = 0.000023). Moreover, compared with standard curves AC was lower and UA-PI higher in the gestational-age range studied. Both the AC and UA-PI curves showed a significantly different rate of change with gestation compared with the normal ranges. The mean values for fetuses with gastroschisis compared with the standard AC and UA-PI range curves were significantly different for AC throughout gestation, and for UA-PI from 32 weeks' gestation.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn fetal gastroschisis, it is well known that AC tends to be smaller, though UA-PI has not been reported to be abnormal in any consistent way. There is a clear relationship between the fetus's AC for gestation and UA-PI, which is not the case for normally grown fetuses. The data suggest that the growth restriction seen in gastroschisis may be explained by hypoxia, and not simply by the classical explanation of extra-abdominal displacement of the abdominal viscera.","inCitations":["d1340c81ac3466c8148636d18bcf47584bc9ca4d","48f01152607ca30495183d8285b3d836020c1488","fd2c92d8dec977fa2ceb6212b059d8e4ff5f1d8c","a57173214f4ec916126a27e2cca54ddeea242d01","0dc32b9aa0b13e7043372599c896cecf849f5c86"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Umbilical artery pulsatility index and fetal abdominal circumference in isolated gastroschisis.","doi":"10.1002/uog.8947","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1002/uog.8947","venue":"Ultrasound in obstetrics & gynecology : the official journal of the International Society of Ultrasound in Obstetrics and Gynecology"}

First, MT data were acquired over a wide symmetric range of frequency offsets, and then a trio of quantitative biomarkers, i.e., the apparent spin-spin relaxation times (T2,f, T2,r) in both free and restricted proton pools as well as the restricted pool fraction Fr, were mapped by fitting the measured Z-spectra to a simple two-Lorentzian compartment model on a voxel-by-voxel basis. The mean restricted exchangeable proton fraction, Fr, was found to be 0.17 in gray matter (GM) and 0.28 in white matter (WM) in healthy subjects. Corresponding mean values for apparent spin-spin relaxation times were 785 µs (T2,f) and 17.7 µs (T2,r) in GM, 672 µs (T2,f) and 23.4 µs (T2,r) in WM. The percentages of Ff and Fr in GM are similar for all ages, whereas Fr shows a tendency to decrease with age in WM among healthy subjects. The patient ZAPPED images show higher contrast between tumor and normal tissues than traditional T2-weighted and T1-weighted images. The ZAPPED method provides a simple phenomenological approach to estimating fractions and apparent T2 values of free and restricted MT-active protons, and it may offer clinical useful information.","inCitations":["607e4074e3e9be5877324210543a44273a5396ba","9c412afa3ea713b6acc94b1b592e9c1b8b0333d2"],"pdfUrls":["http://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/pmc/1e/ea/pone.0119915.PMC4358893.pdf","https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0119915&type=printable"],"title":"Z-Spectrum Analysis Provides Proton Environment Data (ZAPPED): A New Two-Pool Technique for Human Gray and White Matter","doi":"10.1371/journal.pone.0119915","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0119915","venue":"PloS one"}

No mortality, clinical signs of toxicity or adverse toxicological effects on hematology or serum chemistry parameters, body weights, feed consumption, ophthalmological examinations, or histological evaluation of tissues were noted in any treatment group. In the developmental toxicity study, groups of pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats (25/group) received 0 (control), 5,000, 25,000 or 50,000 ppm Aquateric in the diet on gestational days 6-15. No evidence of maternal toxicity or fetotoxicity or embryotoxicity was noted. The no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) exceeds 50,000 ppm in the diet, which represents a dose range of approximately 3600 to 4100 mg/kg/day. The results of these studies demonstrate the low toxicity of Aquateric. The estimated human intake is approximately 4 mg/kg/day. Based on the NOAEL from the subchronic study of 3604 mg/kg/day, the margin of safety is 900.","inCitations":["37f96f89e5abbf2dcb11480f3d97c6018b435072","aa38905b0d96e70d63cc0e22af44cf8d47851bcd"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Subchronic Toxicity and Developmental Toxicity Studies in Rats With Aquateric® Aqueous Enteric Coating","doi":"10.1080/109158199225675","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1080/109158199225675","venue":""}

Under this ruling, permit holders may discharge, without fear of penalty, any disclosed pollutant within the reasonable expectation of the permitting authority. This decision is worrisome because it does not protect the goals of the Clean Water Act and deprives the public of information about pollutants in the environment.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://digitalcommons.pace.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1590&context=lawfaculty","https://scholarship.law.berkeley.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1709&context=elq","https://scholarship.law.berkeley.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1709&context=elq&httpsredir=1&referer=","https://digitalcommons.pace.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1590&context=lawfaculty","http://scholarship.law.berkeley.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1709&context=elq","https://digitalcommons.law.buffalo.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1175&context=articles"],"title":"Piney Run : The Permits Are Not What They Seem","doi":"10.15779/Z387Z6J","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.15779/Z387Z6J","venue":""}

Glucose disposal rate between the 2nd and 4th h of a euglycemic insulin clamp, developed through a constant infusion of insulin (0.77 mU X kg-1 X min-1) together with somatostatin (80 ng X kg-1 X min-1), was 2.5-fold higher in a DG-5128-treated group (P less than .01) than in a control group.

Yeasts and acetic acid bacteria are included in the growth model. The version of the model described relates to a cylinder of silage subject to forced aeration, a common experimental configuration. The model was very sensitive to variations in insulation thickness and yeast growth rate, and to initial pH, especially when maize was the forage. Great care is needed when selecting input data for use in the model to be sure that the physical and chemical properties are accurate. The model solution was sensitive to grid size, but with 361 cells, the maximum grid resolution that could be used on a 486 series PC, solutions were achieved with an acceptably small loss of accuracy. The model predicted the results of an experiment on silage deterioration quite accurately. However, the model also predicted that considerable spatial gradients of parameters, such as temperature, pH, and lactic acid, would occur. This indicates the need for care when taking samples or making temperature measurements in deterioration experiments. The model is potentially a useful tool in predicting the optimal time and position to take samples for analysis in a time-course experiment.","inCitations":["8c63aa7a8b2c2bf2b17758d67cba5aa5c64e353b","8c1b6767d7d0eb701d483b67964290fcc1b0eaf5","ba301e250e556954d36023217f2f84f7bd6682fa","85104c95a3999363c8344fba3e8ac294ad0f8d7f"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"A mathematical model of the aerobic deterioration of silage","doi":"10.1111/j.1365-2494.1995.tb02306.x","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2494.1995.tb02306.x","venue":""}

Individual gliadins differ in molecular weight, isoelectric point, and amino acid sequences, making their analyses especially difficult. We here used preparative polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in acidic conditions to fractionate gliadins of the cultivar Fraza. Resulting fractions were then analysed by ELISA to test their immunoreactive properties with antigliadin polyclonal antibodies. Preparative electrophoresis yielded 60 aliquots, of which 15 contained single proteins. Separated gliadins differed in immunoreactive properties: antigliadin antibodies bound stronger to a and β gliadins, while the immunoenzymatic reaction with y and ω-gliadins was much weaker.","inCitations":["43bff5ecd52bdd98034d910d2ed4e0cf409e6b5f","daf63911bdaefce30360ff4e7be5ffbdbcf195b4","5d506cd92593f299305f0f190cf4d75e8b084008","55c76b641f59ab9ee716335aaf4e410e854a4ac5","389d72d02c4f885c4fb6ef67cc6231087d8c4a58","86932c05cb415407a547f002d2bb57e3d6358756","a05c8649da71ff036e97350979bc8d5ce4438a5b"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Isolation and purification of individual gliadin proteins by preparative acid polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (A-PAGE) for allergenic research","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Many employees encountered increase in distress, a negative stress and even faced a situation of facing disciplinary actions due to frequently getting delayed in reporting to their work. Due to this they have encountered a negative impact on their career advancement, incentives, and salary hike and job security. Many employees found it impossible to relocate their residence to close proximity of their work place in spite of facing huge trouble due to unreliable and unsafe public transport.

The bleeding was managed surgically, with suturing of the faucial pillars incorporating a piece of Surgicel into the closure. Two days later the patient experienced an episode of partial airway obstruction, due to a piece of dislodged haemostatic material, owing to failure of the closure. The techniques used in the operative management of post-tonsillectomy bleeding are not formally evaluated or discussed in the current literature, and in some cases are unreliable or even potentially hazardous.

MicroRNA miR-34 was recently found to be a direct target of p53, functioning downstream of the p53 pathway as a tumor suppressor. miR-34 targets Notch, HMGA2, and Bcl-2, genes involved in the self-renewal and survival of cancer stem cells. The role of miR-34 in gastric cancer has not been reported previously. In this study, we examined the effects of miR-34 restoration on p53-mutant human gastric cancer cells and potential target gene expression.MethodsHuman gastric cancer cells were transfected with miR-34 mimics or infected with the lentiviral miR-34-MIF expression system, and validated by miR-34 reporter assay using Bcl-2 3'UTR reporter. Potential target gene expression was assessed by Western blot for proteins, and by quantitative real-time RT-PCR for mRNAs. The effects of miR-34 restoration were assessed by cell growth assay, cell cycle analysis, caspase-3 activation, and cytotoxicity assay, as well as by tumorsphere formation and growth.ResultsHuman gastric cancer Kato III cells with miR-34 restoration reduced the expression of target genes Bcl-2, Notch, and HMGA2. Bcl-2 3'UTR reporter assay showed that the transfected miR-34s were functional and confirmed that Bcl-2 is a direct target of miR-34. Restoration of miR-34 chemosensitized Kato III cells with a high level of Bcl-2, but not MKN-45 cells with a low level of Bcl-2. miR-34 impaired cell growth, accumulated the cells in G1 phase, increased caspase-3 activation, and, more significantly, inhibited tumorsphere formation and growth.ConclusionOur results demonstrate that in p53-deficient human gastric cancer cells, restoration of functional miR-34 inhibits cell growth and induces chemosensitization and apoptosis, indicating that miR-34 may restore p53 function. Restoration of miR-34 inhibits tumorsphere formation and growth, which is reported to be correlated to the self-renewal of cancer stem cells. The mechanism of miR-34-mediated suppression of self-renewal appears to be related to the direct modulation of downstream targets Bcl-2, Notch, and HMGA2, indicating that miR-34 may be involved in gastric cancer stem cell self-renewal/differentiation decision-making. Our study suggests that restoration of the tumor suppressor miR-34 may provide a novel molecular therapy for p53-mutant gastric

The paper is divided in three parts, the first part being addressed to the synthesis, structural aspects and intercalation properties of HTlc, the second part to the properties of the intercalation compounds with biologically active molecular anions, the third part to the preparation of polymeric nanocomposites for biomedical applications. Ion exchange procedures have been used to obtain the intercalation compounds of MgAl-HTlc with ibuprofen, diclofenac, indomethacin, ketoprofen and tiaprofenic acid and to study their release in solutions simulating biological fluids. Some of these intercalation compounds have been tested to improve the solubility of poorly water-soluble drugs such as indomethacin, ketoprofen, tiaprofenic acid and flurbiprofen. MgAl-HTlc and ZnAl-HTlc have been used as starting materials to prepare new sunscreen products, in which organic filters are entrapped between HTlc lamellae, in order to improve “solar product” effectiveness and safety. The preparation of polymeric composites constituted by HTlc exchanged with the anti-inflammatory diclofenac or the antimicrobial drugs and polycaprolactone are also described.","inCitations":["4ad50cb935e6f0aaaf0f768af8078c38c2ecb382","f8c44e76398e44edb2391beab74b4caf2b301eff","b41ffdb254ddb71b05ead6bd3f28c48fe215e106","c259153ef124bf91fe36cd216e5f1d41279e89c7","9e1c996a64d9499decfb12a8fd3e416d8f4adf30","2bf967f0c4d14d2e1d6b36cd8de5769a934e0eb2","1d7354f75eeef04dcc9c42dd1bda71d967afe4cb","4ac2ef913963c60450132c253f959b32287e39d6","11cfb8566070201cc0798da8b2c974f9aa012659","c7b123e0cdda79fc890c2ff939d0e20fd1541fab","0a09d84cb4c4110cfd5cbaab324472d7128b6d07","3cde9b69a6f06857b3a0d0d79c8d97105aa1a230","6a9c46727192eaa4a88c99c5ad26a7976097dc66","320f0579220921afeba60c928567b32f98c7cfca","7b6deb2038a29b383da3f19c8880b6fd53657d56","b7139e3ac63245c55f53909c6e4e8622f5d2a827","8071b170651a3df7e76cd4ef2723f0cd202687fb","c06f5d29a02938993df736a1bc5c4eda8719a09e","9d83d3a01e8419825459d8cceb95eb2a457a7dbb","a2d84ee37b6e1934aaa75a94f172d4056b18b411","4593fce8afdc34d677eff89380d16a731251584b","1e54263126305910cf5044f0168852581df90092","ca5ae699e4d3cea31e9e110791608c3f88480020","2a7fa5184ec995eb7f719f05b39c9eb719ae6df5","bf988101f308e7e21fdd0fc0d0c6bc7c840c3821","86873fea729f5b25fe868244a97a2de8eec8cdd7","b648e6a8fd3bac30510f795b9ed649d9f10bfa89","c187e47975cc6c7b74ed53be758a95284b6d33f8","45c814e4ee74f8307d0254d2f7712e6695a2d7ee","3078b48078d8036b886bff320bc480413814e1c5","640e4c3c7851e1589e9b4d4081e2ffac4bee5472","c63a8e6219f6f5b103dab88fff1c5a0bc7da6275","8144476f5ba7aab66dcbf04b4a7d5bb41ccd0430","cb6b627f0437c0a8390d48e38953b1af216b0d5f","d1c91fa89ab88197ca2c8889ecaccc18d43b09c8","65f73fb236639d719fe6d9e5aca76159b77765da","df64b464888a5f8e23cdf41a32680ecadbf4ed3a","4016740ddc4beb19b5634715bb53055c32f21817","070c9c50df2983e7999290fa3f71b41c6b6b9372","48af31a477089c7cf8a10788109737754fa00359","ddf692b2154461565ef7dd54d2959d6a972fc31e","7e8c514687cd1c81903001f4f9149bcdf58b001e","c6a1fd9c0c11751b6e49b7aa7ad111dae26ad85d","5ed5d1be971f45c3dc281203bf293222676715b3","7dbd12856d33da43392de55617ecffa1c2571b36","c7a7615359d05f46092675e8efa8315f6ef903fa","e34d46176556c6414306dd9b9f57c3b7a0ab98b3","7003b941d946386bcd9992d2809df3295a974e2a","92a99f10e27598ac00d888e526fdfc3a5880d6a0","2b18a039d9fa1d5128ca5f3e4c4a9b607ef5e37d","086b3d879ba0bde4e309650c4d02321c0acdb367","f65b9ceda2189a183681fa51e95456720c5fd45d","bb2cc97d9d0609f3f121e261374246bca6d753c4"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Hydrotalcite-like compounds: Versatile layered hosts of molecular anions with biological activity","doi":"10.1016/j.micromeso.2007.02.005","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.micromeso.2007.02.005","venue":""}

Metal coordination is one of the most interesting aspects of spiropyrans for its potential in sensing, catalysis, and medicinal chemistry, but little is known about the details surrounding spiropyran-metal ion binding. We investigated the interplay between an N-modified 8-methoxy-6-nitrospiropyran (SP-E), designed to provide appropriate molecular flexibility and a range of competing/collaborative metal binding sites, with Mg2+ , Cu2+ and Zn2+ , which were chosen for their similar coordination geometry preferences while differing in their hard/soft character. The formed molecular complexes were studied by means of UV/Vis, fluorescence, and NMR spectroscopies and mass spectrometry, and the crystal structure of the SP-E-Cu complex was also obtained. The results indicate that the Mg2+ , Zn2+ and Cu2+ complexes have identical coordination stoichiometry. Furthermore, the Mg2+ and Zn2+ complexes display fluorescence properties in solution and visible-light responsiveness. These results provide important spectroscopic and structural information that can serve as a foundation for rational design of spiropyran-based smart materials for metal sensing and scavenging applications.","inCitations":["edb57ebb47d47e940d81eb394a041176dca4999d","0ee4ce6a9b3a2e8696adfbc7674ea513b3e5f2c7","34398447894073d597ecdafa4d02003695e03a4e"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Probing Metal Ion Complexation of Ligands with Multiple Metal Binding Sites: The Case of Spiropyrans.","doi":"10.1002/chem.201602608","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1002/chem.201602608","venue":"Chemistry"}

Y aboga por una vision integrada de las artes, asi como los planteamientos de globalizacion del area de Educacion Artistica que se incluyen en la propia ley (LOGSE). Desde el punto de vista metodologico, se apoya fundamentalmente en la paradigma cualitativo -sin desestimar la complementariedad con la metodologia cuantitativa- y sigue la perspectiva interpretacion del enfoque etnografico, aplicado a la Educacion Musical.\n Como sintesis, en la primera parte se incorporan los principales postulados teoricos acerca de la funcion cognitiva y las produccion de aprendizajes significativos.

It was confirmed that similar results were obtained for both syndiotactic and atactic P(3HB)s. On the other hand, the acidic degradation of these polymers using a protonic acid, such as p-toluenesulfonic acid, exclusively produced the linear 3HB oligomer instead of the cyclic oligomer. The formation of the cyclic oligomer was regarded as the characteristic feature of the lipase-catalyzed degradation in organic media. The cyclic oligomer obtained readily reacted with alcohol as a nucleophile, and using lipase, to produce the alkyl ester of the 3HB oligomer.","inCitations":["1310fc70f90c06165df376e688c190e5dfe85a4d","7303d7aa4b6e9df76cc097c0197fb9a45b799ca7"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Lipase‐Catalyzed Transformation of Unnatural‐Type Poly(3‐hydroxybutanoate) into Reactive Cyclic Oligomer","doi":"10.1002/1616-5195(20020201)2:2<88::AID-MABI88>3.0.CO;2-5","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1002/1616-5195%2820020201%292%3A2%3C88%3A%3AAID-MABI88%3E3.0.CO%3B2-5","venue":""}
