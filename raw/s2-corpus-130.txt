Fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) carries a pivotal role in diagnosis of metastatic tumor to lymph node. This study highlights the role of FNAC in diagnosis of STS metastasis to lymph node.\n\n\nMETHOD\nA retrospective study over a period by 4 years carried out. FNAC of enlarged lymph node was performed in patients with STS. Cytology smears were examined in conjunction with clinical details. Histopathology and Immunohistochemistry (IHC) were correlated in synchronous cases.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOut of 326 patients, 21 with STS had enlarged lymph nodes, of which 19 cases showed involvement (5.8%). Sixteen cases were metachronous and 3 cases showed synchronous involvement. Fifteen cases had regional lymph nodes while 4 cases had distal lymph node involvement. Head and neck and lower extremities were the most common primary sites of STS. Rhabdomyosarcoma was the most common sarcoma metastasing to the lymph nodes followed by synovial sarcoma, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor, and clear cell sarcoma. Other rare tumors included leiomyosarcoma, epitheloid sarcoma, liposarcoma, malignant fibrous histiocytoma, and Ewing's sarcoma/peripheral neuroectodermal tumor. We had a case of dermatofibrosarcoma protuberance (DFSP) of scalp with cervical lymph node metastasis. Very unusual about this case was its rare primary site and the rarer lymph node metastasis.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nFNAC plays an important role in the diagnosis of lymph node metastasis in cases of STS.","inCitations":["8c5e9fb679e694fbe74d07ad20f887dff9d99a0f"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Metastasis of soft tissue sarcomas in lymph node: A cytomorphological study","doi":"10.1002/dc.23754","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1002/dc.23754","venue":"Diagnostic cytopathology"}

It consists of providing the ability to evolve its internal meso-structure while in operation. This new design strategy is allowed by the features included in a new family of FPGA devices, which is called FIPSOC (field programmable system on a chip). Besides a programmable digital section composed of an array of LUT-like configurable cells, the device includes a configurable analog part and a general purpose microcontroller. Furthermore, the configuration scheme used for the programmable digital section allows for an efficient and fast realisation of dynamic reconfiguration principles. As we shall show in this paper, these properties offer two new on-line hardware evolution strategies, giving rise to what we have called virtual meso-structures.","inCitations":["cb56d9a8f2dd252072566380a3a0aa7d14380626","f1b577cc8515cc5bc37883f7a0b5fc83ed8f198e","811f2bf35c8e5250ee655d4507de9cb7953c623d","a257c27f38748f2e8621519919c7db59f21a2db1"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.sidsa.com/data/micron99.pdf"],"title":"Approaching evolvable hardware to reality: The role of dynamic reconfiguration and virtual meso-structures","doi":"10.1109/MN.1999.758860","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MN.1999.758860","venue":"Proceedings of the Seventh International Conference on Microelectronics for Neural, Fuzzy and Bio-Inspired Systems"}

Therefore, we have incubated cultured rat and human primary hepatocytes with noncytotoxic concentrations of (3)H-OTA ranging from 10(-7) to 10(-5) M for 8 h and determined its metabolism and covalent DNA binding. In rat hepatocytes, OTA was metabolized to small amounts of three products, which were further studied by electrospray ionization (ESI)-MS/MS techniques. In addition to 4-hydroxy-OTA, which is a known product of OTA biotransformation, two novel metabolites were detected and tentatively identified as hexose and pentose conjugates of OTA. The in vitro induction with 3-methylcholanthrene (3MC) increased the formation of 4-hydroxy-OTA but did not alter the formation of the conjugated metabolites. No covalent binding of (3)H-OTA or its metabolites to DNA was observed in rat hepatocytes with or without 3MC induction with a limit of detection of 2 adducts per 10(9) nucleotides. However, the cellular ratio of reduced glutathione to oxidized glutathione was significantly decreased by treatment with OTA. In cultured human hepatocytes, (3)H-OTA was only very poorly metabolized, and no covalent DNA binding was observed. In conclusion, the results of this in vitro study do not support the notion that OTA has the potential to undergo metabolic activation and form covalent DNA adducts in rodents and humans.","inCitations":["0693b1c638d177aaf92bc8463da91e039d667e49","39fd522202a022857bc8c50b45e25630e232d78a","1085ecb9e09893990871e488eb52f1502f716f08","4d70e184930a44ff77f7d82963a07f9a7ddded30","4294a93e0354e759dd9869883e341cce5decf817","a25fdf077dd893828329f5924903f104335dc5a8","be6876e82a0df5d2e04f8ee8e3d144516cc6551a","3c85ddc64c7ace575bfc3e704c10abf056391c66","358319e3368b232a2624e5dc4a1134b6657bbdd8","e3e5ff9a6bcf1b9b71e728b1cfa8534702ede9de","02b94924502be3a64f4e0920a823c855a860ae78","34ece5fc3baa413c7bc8b5088024c0a37e682c82","4f298d43d679f662adf14920f59ede7b8eb3aedc","10cbd704010277508912aa35eac07b300260fb37","5c6b09313333c69f78bb9c0b471451c0b8518ec5","5350c7169c39e6597328a94e67694e55b717c477","efe54961878f37a03428addf172416b140c62ef7","05b5755288414c54d30cddda495696ca282a4d67","96554e2ea128831321f80a26511c3f22eaec40a2","1cd573cfa96d0a759d94b196c1638574ab63a1cd","2a496480ae416d07d1f0f8f1d1eddadf8613c00e","b7969d06225ad9a89ca4927cd08479441567a8db","7844079ad9fc322acecd3fe6d31e9ebdca7c91ed","23715026f4f5d63037c9ac6c480dd435fb94a329","1b522b81b36053ea1010ecb3f23452c59e89a61a","21a48e3b917c9d7504f6c341129dd09e55300684","1c1ca99be904879b38d6d829c2cfebde78d84417","d18f404d528dccdb21ce9195a91c3363fbf57b85","d96781ef141bec11861fd1d722f91d78959947ed","c0fb4eeb79a8f147e35ba2396b98dd047d005db7","d9c2685b862f3b93de521fc8a2be814f408e8d0f","ca1976bca26836b89d18b0794c20cedb3e562bc7","6b9f3d39aa538f6af982491d97804005fdcb7eb1","3bee8edfa6e608b2f78f13566960d3b093799760","ca0b52b5549dd84633bb222bcdc31a6bf39029da","be53ac8da456cb8c941b36f279633689fa9e9f14","846954ebcaa6879232e92c6d93fea8bf0a112c5b"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Metabolism and lack of DNA reactivity of the mycotoxin ochratoxin a in cultured rat and human primary hepatocytes.","doi":"10.1021/jf0111817","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1021/jf0111817","venue":"Journal of agricultural and food chemistry"}

Karp [1, Corollary to main theorem] shows that there is an wdistributive non-12wI-representable 12W1-complete Boolean algebra. Karp later pointed out that, for every cardinal K> 12%1, there is an co-distributive non-12w|-representable K-complete Boolean algebra. The following strengthens the completeness requirement. THEOREM 1. The Continuum Hypothesis implies the existence of an co-distributive non-colc-representable complete Boolean algebra. In [3, Definition 1.2], the property PK was defined for cardinals K. We will prove the following theorem. THEOREM 2. If 121 <12\"11, then there exists an co-distributive complete Boolean algebra that does not have the property P.1. Theorem 1 is a consequence of Theorem 2, since the Continuum Hypothesis implies both 121 <I12)11 and (by [3, Theorem 4.2]) the equivalence of co1-representability with property P... Assuming the negation of Souslin's Hypothesis, Smith's [3, Theorem 3.4] implies our theorems. However, R. Jensen has shown that Souslin's Hypothesis is consistent with the Continuum Hypothesis; so Smith's result does not imply ours. 1. Preliminaries. Let co be the first infinite cardinal; co, is the first uncountable cardinal; xy is the set of all functions from y into x; lxl is the cardinal of x (cardinals are initial ordinals); Dm(x) is the domain of function x; x4y is the restriction of a function x to the domain Dm(x) ny.

illustrated in South America. Because of the extent of this health crisis, a number of more serious symptoms have become associated with ZIKV infection than what was initially described. In particular, neuronal and ocular disorders have been characterized, both in infants and in adults. Notably, the macula and the retina can be strongly affected by ZIKV, possibly by a direct effect of the virus. This is supported by the detection of replicative and infectious virus in lachrimal fluid in human patients and mouse models.\n\n\nMETHODS\nHere, we used an innovative, state-of-the-art iPSC-derived human retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) model to study ZIKV retinal impairment.\n\n\nFINDINGS\nWe showed that the human RPE is highly susceptible to ZIKV infection and that a ZIKV African strain was more virulent and led to a more potent epithelium disruption and stronger anti-viral response than an Asian strain, suggesting lineage differences. Moreover, ZIKV infection led to impaired membrane dynamics involved in endocytosis, organelle biogenesis and potentially secretion, key mechanisms of RPE homeostasis and function.\n\n\nINTERPRETATION\nTaken together, our results suggest that ZIKV has a highly efficient ocular tropism, which creates a strong inflammatory environment that could have acute or chronic adverse effects.

The temporal evolution of cortical activation and connectivity patterns during a fatiguing handgrip task were studied by functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). Twenty-three young adults (18 to 35 years old) were recruited to use a handheld force sensor to perform intermittent handgrip contractions with their dominant hand at their personal maximum voluntary contraction force level for 3.5 s followed by 6.5 s of rest for 120 blocks. Subjects were divided into self-reported physically active and inactive groups, and their hemodynamic activity over the prefrontal and sensory-motor cortices (111 channels) was mapped while they performed this task. Using this fNIRS setup, a more detailed time sequence of cortical activation and connectivity patterns was observed compared to prior studies. A temporal evolution sequence of hemodynamic activation patterns was noted, which was different between the active and the inactive groups. Physically active subjects demonstrated delayed fatigue onset and significantly longer-lasting and more spatially extended functional connectivity (FC) patterns, compared to inactive subjects. The observed differences in activation and FC suggested differences in cortical network adaptation patterns as fatigue set in, which were dependent on subjects’ physical activity. The findings of this study suggest that physical activity increases FC with regions involved in motor task control and correlates to extended fatigue onset and enhanced performance.","inCitations":["776d731167d06bf394824284a9d1523c526898b0"],"pdfUrls":["https://nanolithography.spiedigitallibrary.org/journalArticle/Download?fullDOI=10.1117/1.NPh.6.4.045011&isResultClick=False"],"title":"Mapping cortical network effects of fatigue during a handgrip task by functional near-infrared spectroscopy in physically active and inactive subjects","doi":"10.1117/1.nph.6.4.045011","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1117/1.nph.6.4.045011","venue":"Neurophotonics"}

The thickness design of u-GaN interlayer matching up with background doping level for improving laser performance is studied. It is found that a suitably chosen u-GaN interlayer can well modulate the optical absorption loss and optical confinement factor. However, if the value of background doping concentration of u-GaN interlayer is too large, the output light power may decrease. The analysis of energy band diagram of a LD structure with 100 nm u-GaN interlayer shows that the width of n-side depletion region decreases when the background concentration increases, and may become even too small to cover whole MQW, resulting in a serious decrease of the output light power. It means that a suitable interlayer thickness design matching with the background doping level of u-GaN interlayer is significant for InGaN-based laser diodes.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"The thickness design of unintentionally doped GaN interlayer matched with background doping level for InGaN-based laser diodes","doi":"10.1063/1.4945015","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1063/1.4945015","venue":""}

In the first part of the experiment, the response of three rural dust samples ap - plied into the soil were assessed in pot experiment to observe uptake of As, Cd, Pb, and Zn by aboveground biomass of oat (Avena sativa L.). Although the element contents in dust samples exceeded significantly total element contents in soil, the element content in plants was not affected by single-rate soil amendment with rural dust sample. Soil sorp - tion capacity and neutral pH of the experimental soil (7.0) was sufficient for immobilization of the elements. Howe - ver, potentially mobilizable portions (0.005 mol/l DTPA extractable) of elements significantly increased (Cd by 116%, Pb by 39%, Zn by 50%) in the treated soil, which suggests a possible release of these elements in long-term horizon. On the contrary, high percentages of potentially toxic elements (Cd, Zn, Ni) in the most mobile (exchangeable) frac- tions were determined in the second part of investigation in two urban dust samples collected in Prague Letna auto- mobile tunnel, and Prague subway station Museum. These results suggest possible direct impact of mobile, and thus potentially bio-available, element fractions on human environment. The results of both particular experiments cannot give complete information concerning behavior of harmful pollutants in airborne particulate maer and their influen - ce on human health. They can however indicate two of possible ways of environmental pollution with this material. Yet, it would require a more detailed investigation in future.","inCitations":["09590976ffa03f6856e5494597f3ef62b0848557"],"pdfUrls":["https://www.agriculturejournals.cz/publicFiles/50996.pdf"],"title":"Particular aspects of environmental impact of potentially risk elements from airborne particulate matter","doi":"10.17221/3613-pse","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.17221/3613-pse","venue":""}

The selection of the appropriate formulation (carrier and drug) with optimal delivery is a challenge investigated by researchers in academia and industry, in which millions of dollars are invested annually. Experiments involving different carriers and determination of their capacity for drug loading are very time-consuming and therefore expensive; consequently, approaches that employ computational/theoretical chemistry to speed have the potential to make hugely beneficial economic, environmental, and health impacts through savings in costs associated with chemicals (and their safe disposal) and time. Here, we report the use of computational tools (data mining of the available literature, principal component analysis, hierarchical clustering analysis, partial least squares regression, autocovariance calculations, molecular dynamics simulations, and molecular docking) to successfully predict drug loading into model drug delivery systems (gelatin nanospheres). We believe that this methodology has the potential to lead to significant change in drug formulation studies across the world.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/acsomega.9b03487","https://eprints.lancs.ac.uk/id/eprint/141144/1/Manuscript_5_.pdf"],"title":"Prediction of Drug Loading in the Gelatin Matrix Using Computational Methods","doi":"10.1021/acsomega.9b03487","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1021/acsomega.9b03487","venue":"ACS omega"}

While previous studies have evaluated germ cell dynamics in the postnatal marmoset, the features of testicular somatic cells remain largely unknown. Therefore, the aim of this study was to establish marmoset-specific markers for Sertoli and peritubular cells (PTCs) and to compare protocols for the enrichment and culture of testicular cell types. Immunohistochemistry of Sertoli and PTC-specific markers – anti-müllerian hormone (AMH), vimentin (VIM), α-smooth muscle actin (SMA) – was performed and corresponding RNA expression profiles were established by quantitative PCR analysis (SOX9,AMH, FSHR,VIM, and SMA). For these analyses, testicular tissue from newborn (n = 4), 8-week-old (n = 4) and adult (n = 3) marmoset monkeys was used. Protocols for the enrichment and culture of testicular cell fractions from the 8-week-old marmoset monkeys (n = 3) were evaluated and cells were analyzed using germ cell- and somatic cell-specific markers. The expression of AMH, VIM and SMA reflects the proportion and differentiation status of Sertoli and PTCs at the RNA and the protein levels. While applied protocols did not support the propagation of germ cells in vitro, our analyses revealed that PTCs maintain their proliferative potential and constitute the dominant cell type after short- and long-term culture. Expression of functionally meaningful testicular somatic markers is similar in the human and the marmoset monkey, indicating that this primate can indeed be used as model for human testicular development. The PTC culture system established in this study will facilitate the identification of factors influencing male sex differentiation and spermatogenesis.","inCitations":["5de127fee0221f85f97f47d76e774ec5c6f62b81","33a4c70ed4ad2e5d094f8cf6c965af567d41c04d","df14c121e5685b93bffe73645e76bc2cf51f5f96","f7103f00c77b0e684e97c19e48258620897abed0","adca6f67e07ca34baf4f5e02ab6ddfe67e79650a","721baab06e9c55b95bc762dc746f68a65eafbe95","424c676fbd0cf452dc23846b06285651db934e95","774581888453067a7cc3d3c994bf2c4195f58fc9","2fed29d58a101508e29f0db9dce3a50a8ee7b730","febd99086d241a55dd3af1fd1f3b148c5dab792e","33bdc1754a4d8bf972558b56719a81f9cb9b3ab9","85ddbaf5adc12829c06a911079018965804d31d3","e689ed0513653825bcf055638ba4b747cf34d86c","3768696eaf90880916b856d5a8bb5b758cbb7213"],"pdfUrls":["https://www.karger.com/Article/Pdf/339010"],"title":"Comparative Marker Analysis after Isolation and Culture of Testicular Cells from the Immature Marmoset","doi":"10.1159/000339010","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1159/000339010","venue":"Cells Tissues Organs"}

Methods and Results—Using data from 3078 participants from the Framingham Offspring Study (a cohort study) who attended examinations 4 (1987), 5 (1991), and 6 (1995), we evaluated the progression of MetS and its components. MetS was defined according to the Adult Treatment Panel III criteria. Using logistic regression, we evaluated the predictive ability of the presence of each component of the MetS on the subsequent development of MetS. Additionally, we examined the probability of developing cardiovascular disease or mortality (until 2007) by having specific combinations of 3 that diagnose MetS. The prevalence of MetS almost doubled in 10 years of follow-up. Hyperglycemia and central obesity experienced the highest increase. High blood pressure was most frequently present when a diagnosis of MetS occurred (77.3%), and the presence of central obesity conferred the highest risk of developing MetS (odds ratio, 4.75; 95% confidence interval, 3.78 to 5.98). Participants who entered the MetS having a combination of central obesity, high blood pressure, and hyperglycemia had a 2.36-fold (hazard ratio, 2.36; 95% confidence interval, 1.54 to 3.61) increase of incident cardiovascular events and a 3-fold (hazard ratio, 3.09, 95% confidence interval, 1.93 to 4.94) increased risk of mortality. Conclusions—Particular trajectories and combinations of factors on entering the MetS confer higher risks of incident cardiovascular disease and mortality in the general population and among those with MetS. Intense efforts are required to identify populations with these particular combinations and to provide them with adequate treatment at early stages of disease.

The main research challenges are identifying and refining realistic requirements for a MANET routing protocol and designing such protocol. In this paper we report on the field experiments we performed in order to address this. Our approach builds on energy efficient MANETs to provide continuous monitoring of multidimensional parameters of animal mobility including temporal and spatial walking intensity and feed intake in order to detect oestrus, pregnancy, animal diseases and reduced efficiency of pastures. We support remote and in-situ, specific and range queries and notifications about newly detected events.

However, the overall structure and composition of vaginal microbiota in different trimesters of the pregnant women has not been fully elucidated. In this study, the physiological changes of the vaginal microbiota in healthy pregnant women were investigated. A total of 83 healthy pregnant participants were enrolled, who are in the first, second, or third pregnancy trimester. Quantitative real-time PCR was used to explore the abundant bacteria in the vaginal microbiota. No significant difference in the abundance of Gardnerella, Atopobium, Megasphaera, Eggerthella, Leptotrichia/Sneathia, or Prevotella was found among different trimesters, except Lactobacillus. Compared with the first pregnancy trimester, the abundance of L. iners decreased in the second and third trimester while the abundance of L. crispatus was increased in the second trimester. Moreover, we also found that vaginal cleanliness is correlated with the present of Lactobacillus, Atopobium, and Prevotella and leukocyte esterase is associated with Lactobacillus, Atopobium, Gardnerella, Eggerthella, Leptotrichia/Sneathia, and Prevotella. For those whose vaginal cleanliness raised or leukocyte esterase became positive, the richness of L. iners increased, while that of L. crispatus decreased significantly. Our present data indicated that the altered vaginal microbiota, mainly Lactobacillus, could be observed among different trimesters of pregnancy and L. iners could be considered as a potential bacterial marker for evaluating vaginal cleanliness and leukocyte esterase.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://downloads.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2019/6079734.pdf"],"title":"Lactobacillus iners Is Associated with Vaginal Dysbiosis in Healthy Pregnant Women: A Preliminary Study","doi":"10.1155/2019/6079734","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1155/2019%2F6079734","venue":"BioMed research international"}

In some cases, polyphenism has been attributed to facilitating morphological diversification and even the evolution of novel traits. However, this process is predicated on the origins and evolutionary maintenance of genetic mechanisms that specify alternate developmental networks. When and how regulatory loci arise and change, specifically before and throughout the history of a polyphenism, is little understood. Here, we establish a phylogenetic and comparative molecular context for two dynamically evolving genes, eud-1 and seud-1, which regulate polyphenism in the nematode Pristionchus pacificus. This species is dimorphic in its adult feeding-structures, allowing individuals to become microbivores or facultative predators depending on the environment. Although polyphenism regulation is increasingly well understood in P. pacificus, the polyphenism is far older than this species and has diversified morphologically to enable an array of ecological functions across polyphenic lineages. To bring this taxonomic diversity into a comparative context, we reconstructed the histories of eud-1 and seud-1 relative to the origin and diversification of polyphenism, finding that homologues of both genes have undergone lineage-specific radiations across polyphenic taxa. Further, we detected signatures of episodic diversifying selection on eud-1, particularly in early diplogastrid lineages. Lastly, transgenic rescue experiments suggest that the gene's product has functionally diverged from its orthologue's in a non-polyphenic outgroup. In summary, we provide a comparative framework for the molecular components of a plasticity switch, enabling studies of how polyphenism, its regulation, and ultimately its targets evolve.","inCitations":["e38c793f1d6af1c6a0ced0e2dee9b02128ebab38"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Regulators of an ancient polyphenism evolved through episodic protein divergence and parallel gene radiations","doi":"10.1098/rspb.2019.2595","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2019.2595","venue":"Proceedings of the Royal Society B"}

We have since extended its capabilities to support profiling of OpenMP regions and POSIX threads (pthreads) in general. We will show the principles we used to highlight the balance between multi-core (OpenMP) computation, MPI communication and serial code in Allinea MAP’s updated GUI.

For an under-sampled system (which is characteristic of nearly all imaging systems), the replicated frequencies can overlap scene frequencies. An optical anti-alias filter can eliminate the overlapping but does not prevent frequency replication. Frequencies above the Nyquist frequency are eliminated by an ideal reconstruction filter. As overlapping increases or with less than ideal reconstruction, the resultant image is distorted. The phases associated with the replicated frequencies violate linear-shift-invariant system requirements. As a result, movement of the scene with respect to the detector array creates ambiguity in edge locations further distorting imagery. While sampling theory suggests that sharp cutoff filters are required, these filters will create ringing (Gibbs phenomenon) in the image. Replicated spectra that appear in the image are called the spurious response. Out-of-band spurious response (above Nyquist frequency) looks very similar to the input but with phase variation. The phase errors interfere with target recognition and identification. In-band spurious response (frequencies less than the Nyquist frequency) appears somewhat like noise. At this juncture it is not clear how this \"noise\" interferes with recognition and identification tasks. It may only affect detection. Since the sampling process replicates frequencies, it is possible to extract information with reconstruction band-pass filters whose center frequency is above the Nyquist frequency.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"What causes sampling artifacts?","doi":"10.1117/12.783715","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1117/12.783715","venue":"SPIE Defense + Commercial Sensing"}

Superword techniques are appealing because they require minimal changes to an existing design, offer backward compatibility with an existing ISA, and offer large potential for performance improvements. This paper also describes new compiler techniques that are key to the successful use of a superword processor. Automatic parallelization of general-purpose, sequential applications is needed in order to provide a seamless interface to the user. One of the most important tasks of the compiler is the grouping of multiple memory operations into a single wide load or store. We will show that this can greatly increase memory bandwidth. We will show that a superword-extended VLIW machine can outperform a clustered VLIW with similar resources by a factor of 2.43. Even compared with an ideal VLIW machine we achieve speed-ups of 1.84.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://hpc.isti.cnr.it/~diego/papers/utah.pdf"],"title":"Superword Processors","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Guided by the relationship between the amplitude for one-photon-induced electron emission and the electron–ion recombination amplitude in the three-step model of high-order harmonic generation, it is argued that synchrotron-based photoionization might be a superior approach to imaging molecular orbitals. Within the Hartree–Fock independent-particle picture, the molecular-frame photoelectron angular distributions, measured as a function of photon energy, could be used to reconstruct all orbitals occupied in the Hartree–Fock ground state of the molecule investigated. It is suggested that laser alignment techniques could be employed to facilitate the measurement of the molecular-frame photoelectron angular distributions.","inCitations":["72bfddeeac54b4cc7d8629b41c80e689bda0b8f8","ae279e7ea8915207c665c3b7f8ef205603f9404c","df6a831692c13a9cb9144c69415e9a5af5723ca1"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Imaging molecular orbitals using photoionization","doi":"10.1016/j.chemphys.2006.07.008","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chemphys.2006.07.008","venue":""}

Th e plant is selected to evaluate the possibility for novel pharmaceuticals since most of the bacterial pathogens are developing resistance against currently available antibiotics. Aims: To determine the antibacterial activity of crude extracts from diff erent parts of Catharanthus roseus against several bacterial species of clinical signifi cance. Materials and Methods: Extraction of each plant part in appropriate solvent followed by evaluation of antibacterial activity by agar well diff usion assay against a total of six bacterial stains. Further, minimum inhibitory concentration(s) was evaluated for active crude extracts. Results: Data indicated that the pattern of inhibition depends largely upon the extraction procedure, the plant part used for extraction, state of plant part (fresh or dry), solvent used for extraction and the microorganism tested. Dry powder extracts of all plant parts demonstrated more antibacterial activity than extracts prepared from fresh parts. Furthermore, extracts prepared from leaves were shown to have better effi cacy than stem, root, and fl ower extracts. Organic extracts provided more potent antibacterial activity as compared to aqueous extracts. Among all the extracts, the ethanolic extract was found to be most active against almost all the bacterial species tested. Hot water and cold water extracts were completely inactive.

At a median follow-up of 50 months, 34 patients (64.2%) had no evidence of disease and 19 (35.8%) had died from the disease. High levels of SAP at diagnosis correlated with worse survival (P = 0.002). There was no difference in overall survival between patients whose SAP decrease rate was > 25% and those with a rate < 25% (P = 0.14). Among female patients, \"rapid\" SAP responders had better survival than \"slow\" responders (P= 0.026).

The ALMQ was constructed based on the Academic Motivation Questionnaire, which is a measure of academic motivation in Japanese university students, and has 15 items. The reliability and construct validity of the ALMQ were examined in a sample of 448 Japanese university students, who learn Arabic, but are not Arabic majors. Both exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses of the items fully supported the five subscale structure corresponding to the different forms of motivation that were proposed by self-determination theory: amotivation, external regulation, introjected regulation, identified regulation, and intrinsic motivation. Internal consistency reliabilities of the subscales were excellent (αs = 0.86 to 0.90). The test-retest reliability over four weeks was also adequate for a sub-sample of 214 participants (rs = 0.69 to 0.79). The construct validity for the ALMQ was supported by relationships to subjective learning outcomes and the Simplex structure between the ALMQ subscales. As expected, the relationships with subjective learning outcomes and forms of motivation varied depending on the degree of self-determination. In addition, correlational patterns between the subscale scores showed the theoretically expected simplex structure. The ALMQ is expected to be utilized as a suitable measure for understanding the motivations of Japanese learners of Arabic.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"The Arabic Learning Motivation Questionnaire: Development of a New Japanese Measure Based on Self-Determination Theory","doi":"10.4236/psych.2019.1016140","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.4236/psych.2019.1016140","venue":""}

A rectangular opening is cut through the panel into which is inserted and snap-fitted a housing having two parallel vertical walls extending into the interior of the fixed bottom rail. A stop plate is pivoted on the bottom edge of the opening and is rockable between an unlocked position in which the sliding vent clears the stop plate and a lock position in which the sliding vent is prevented from further movement by abutment of the bumper stile of the sliding door or window against the stop plate. In the lock position, a spring biased pin protudes from the stop plate and abuts the fixed bottom rail, thus preventing the stop plate from being moved to unlocked position.

The capacity of an organic acid to enhance iron availability in man, as estimated by chemical means, was dependent upon heat treatment, exogenous iron source, and pH. While frying caused marked reductions in soluble iron at pH values of 5.7 - 6.0, combinations of an elemental iron source with either ascorbic, lactic, citric, or malic acid produced significant increases in percent soluble iron at pH 2, 4, and/or 6. Based on both solubility and technological feasibility, hydrogen reduced elemental iron was considered the most suitable iron fortificant for soy in a soy-hamburger patty.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Effect of Organic Acids in the in vitro Solubilization of Iron from a Soy‐extended Meat Patty","doi":"10.1111/j.1365-2621.1985.tb13747.x","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2621.1985.tb13747.x","venue":""}

Experimental evidence suggests that PAF plays a role in the pathogenesis of a variety of inflammatory processes including allograft rejection. In this study, we evaluated the effects of the PAF antagonist BN52021 on the course of renal allograft rejection in a rat model. Kidneys from ACI (RT1a) rats were transplanted into fully allogeneic PVG (RT1c) rat recipients. Animals received 60 mg/kg/day of the PAF antagonist or vehicle beginning immediately prior to the transplantation procedure. In rats treated with the PAF antagonist, allograft GFR and plasma flow were maintained at levels that were significantly greater than controls. Despite the improvement in renal allograft function, BN52021 had no effect on allograft histomorphology and both groups manifested intense inflammatory cell infiltration consistent with acute cellular rejection. PAF antagonism reduced urinary excretion of thromboxane metabolites and decreased thromboxane production by homogenates prepared from kidney allografts. The PAF antagonist had no effect on urinary excretion of peptidoleukotriene metabolites or on the production of LTB4 by allografts. These data support a role for PAF in the pathophysiology of acute renal allograft rejection, and they suggest that the hemodynamic effects of PAF during rejection may be mediated through stimulation of thromboxane A2. In view of the beneficial effects of PAF blockade in rejection as well as recent reports describing efficacy in models of cyclosporine nephrotoxicity, PAF antagonists may have clinical applications in human renal allograft recipients.","inCitations":["6199454146acbb5131aa52eb8a1a9147d09f4816","4b2c5eaa0820f82d06782468ad7dc0b8acb9a06f","fe56cc30af02b1710b9738a24300ad64246dab62","941b1633151105d312e356c1d419449eb80aa256"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Role of platelet activating factor in kidney transplant rejection in the rat.","doi":"10.1038/ki.1995.301","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1038/ki.1995.301","venue":"Kidney international"}

The design objective is to prolong the network lifetime of such networks. For this purpose, EMP introduces the strategy of energy critical avoidance in the process of on-demand construction of multicast routing trees. That is, those energy-critical nodes in the network are discouraged from involving a multicasting task. EMP also incorporates the destination-driven feature in its tree construction process in order to reduce the tree cost. We present the detailed design description of EMP. Simulation results show that EMP can achieve high performance in terms of network lifetime.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"An energy-efficient on-demand multicast routing protocol for wireless ad hoc and sensor networks","doi":"10.1109/glocomw.2013.6855685","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/glocomw.2013.6855685","venue":"2013 IEEE Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM)"}
