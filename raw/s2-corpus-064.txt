In Papua New Guinea changes in attitude take a long time. The principles of a widely available service were set out in the 1974-78 National Health Plan. The 1986-90 plan reaffirmed them. The decentralized health service in Papua New Guinea is based on the type of administration that had existed in the Health Department. At the 1980 meeting of provincial health officers, the Secretary for the Western Highlands Department reported that services were not improving because of the skilled manpower shortage. He found that the national staff feared for their own status and ignored decentralization. They believed that it was a \"passing phase.\" They refused to make decision, forcing responsibility on the provincial governments. The Secretary suggested that discipline should be broadened to include people affected. Many provincial health officers (PHO) were overseas contract workers, while headquarters staff were citizens of Papua New Guinea. Certain arguments against decentralization used by officials of the Papua New Guinea Department of Health were similar to arguments put forth by the New York City Health Department staff when decentralization was decided on in the mid-1970s. In late 1982, the situation started to improve in Papua New Guinea. In the provinces, all health workers tended to see themselves as members of a single team. The former PHOs became Assistant Secretaries (Health) for the provincial departments. A course in community health was introduced at the University of Papua New Guinea. A diploma is now necessary for those who want senior provincial health positions. Improvements in health occurred from the decentralized primary health care (PHC) approach. Infant mortality decreased from 134/1000 live births in 1971 to 72/1000 in 1980; childhood mortality decreased from 79/1000 to 42/1000. Life expectancy at birth rose from 47.4 years to 49.6 years. Maternal mortality apparently remained high. The population had improved access to health services. The coverage of disease control programs improved when PHC was introduced. To give more responsibility and power to the people is the basic purpose of decentralization.\n","inCitations":["5713fcc9c65800f1a710ea1376e8031af34856f7"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.allclassical.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/January_2011_Power_Increase.pdf"],"title":"More power to the people.","doi":"","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"World health forum"}

A partial soybean hydrolysate containing 73.04% free fatty acids and 24.81% triglycerides was used as a substrate for the enzymatic production of fatty acid methyl ester (FAME). Whole-cell Candida antarctica lipase B-expressing Aspergillus oryzae, and Novozym 435 produced only 75.2 and 73.5% FAME, respectively. Fusarium heterosporum lipase-expressing A. oryzae produced more than 93% FAME in 72 h using three molar equivalents of methanol. FFA and TAG were converted simultaneously in the presence of increasing water content that resulted from esterification. Therefore, F. heterosporum lipase with a noted high level of tolerance of water could be useful in the industrial production of biodiesel from feedstock that has high proportion of free fatty acids.","inCitations":["9ed18652e9a0669c7811b0608f813440177dd941","691334652310e8bbc78539e69155d68e7c2004a0","98d602b02f113edffa65d40dd4fc664affc346a2"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Simultaneous conversion of free fatty acids and triglycerides to biodiesel by immobilized Aspergillus oryzae expressing Fusarium heterosporum lipase.","doi":"10.1002/biot.201600400","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1002/biot.201600400","venue":"Biotechnology journal"}

The study was conducted in three stages: Initial Evaluation - Application of a questionnaire with essay questions and multiple choices of subjects in the area of Speech; Orientation Program - The researcher lectured through slides and brochures on: Development of Speech and Language, Reading and Writing, Voice, Stuttering, Hearing. And Final Assessment - Reuse of the questionnaire according to the themes of the area of Speech. The data collected were subjected to comparative analysis of performance before and after the program. The program succeeded in reinforcing the importance of partnership between speech therapy and education, and also contributed for the teacher to base his pratices on scientific knowledge.","inCitations":["5f1b9a0ce95d55b24a73ed19b1fe047a9507c922","9b9acf5f0ace4d3731d538d1baf024ab33138c3d","00075cc0685823210e02422a129467a5e422e3fb","1278acfe34a6348d8433fcbcb0b9eb5d7cf0cce0"],"pdfUrls":["http://revistas.pucsp.br/index.php/dic/article/download/8039/5902"],"title":"Programa de orientação fonoaudiológica para professores da educação infantil","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

With the exponential growth in research volumes, it has become difficult to keep track of the ever-growing number of application areas as well as the corresponding problem solving techniques. In this paper, we consider the computational linguistics domain and present a novel information extraction system that automatically constructs a pool of all application areas in this domain and appropriately links them with corresponding problem solving techniques. Further, we categorize individual research articles based on their application area and the techniques proposed/used in the article. k-gram based discounting method along with handwritten rules and bootstrapped pattern learning is employed to extract application areas. Subsequently, a language modeling approach is proposed to characterize each article based on its application area. Similarly, regular expressions and high-scoring noun phrases are used for the extraction of the problem solving techniques. We propose a greedy approach to characterize each article based on the techniques. Towards the end, we present a table representing the most frequent techniques adopted for a particular application area. Finally, we propose three use cases presenting an extensive temporal analysis of the usage of techniques and application areas.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://arxiv.org/pdf/1608.06386v1.pdf","http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.06386","http://arxiv.org/pdf/1608.06386v1.pdf"],"title":"Which techniques does your application use?: An information extraction framework for scientific articles","doi":"","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"ArXiv"}

A postal questionnaire was sent to 113 anaesthetists of varying experience working in the Northern Region of England. They were asked to allot ASA grades to 10 hypothetical patients. Ninety-seven (85.8%) responded to two mailings. In no case was there complete agreement on ASA grade, and in only one case were responses restricted to two of the five possible grades. In one case there was a significant difference in answers between anaesthetists with the FRCA (or equivalent) qualification, and those without. So much variation was observed between individual anaesthetist's assessments when describing common clinical problems that the ASA grade alone cannot be considered to satisfactorily describe the

We studied the interactions between four different species of parasitic cuckoos and their three respective hosts in Bangladesh: The Indian Cuckoo Cuculus micropterus parasitised the Black Drongo Dicrurus macrocercus, The Asian Koel Eudynamys scolopaceus, the Long-tailed Shrike Lanius schach, and the Common Hawk Cuckoo Hierococcyx varius, and Pied Cuckoo Clamator jacobinus, the Jungle Babbler Turdoides striata. The breeding seasons of the Black Drongo, and Long-tailed Shrike, started in late March and ended in July, which coincided with those of the Indian Cuckoo (late April–early June), and Asian Koel (March–July), respectively. The Jungle Babbler started breeding in late February, continuing up to June. Competition between its two brood parasites appeared minimal because of their non-overlapping breeding seasons: March–May for the Common Hawk Cuckoo, and June–July for the Pied Cuckoo. The eggs of the Indian Cuckoo, Common Hawk Cuckoo, and Pied Cuckoo show excellent egg mimicry, but the Asian Koel’s eggs are highly non-mimetic. The nest’s height above ground was an important predictor of brood parasitism in Long-tailed Shrike with an increased risk of brood parasitism in low nests. All the host species suffered the costs of brood parasitism, showing reduced breeding success. 64 Indian BIRDS Vol. 12 No. 2 & 3 (Publ. 12 october 2016)","inCitations":["9b164c640e6831388182f72a4f49e6b6e72eeff8"],"pdfUrls":["http://indianbirds.in/pdfs/IB_12_2_3_NahidETAL_Cuckoos.pdf"],"title":"Brood parasitic cuckoos and their hosts in Jahangirnagar University campus","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

However, the short-circuit current characteristic of a synchronous compensator after a 3-phase terminal fault shows delayed current zeros (DCZ) which means prospective current has no natural crossing through zero for several cycles. This imposes high technical requirements on the generator circuit-breaker (GCB) employed in such application regarding the interruption of fault currents. It is essential to assess the possible occurrence of DCZ and select appropriate GCB to ensure high availability of the plant. In the beginning, this paper identifies requirements from a GCB in case of DCZ. Then, the possible cases of fault currents which show DCZ in a typical synchronous compensator plant are investigated using simulation model in the electro-magnetic transient program EMTP-ATP. The DCZ associated with synchronous compensator terminal faults and out-of-phase synchronizing faults have been analyzed. Furthermore, a third case is studied which can occur in synchronous compensator plant with 3-winding step-up transformers. The capability of GCB to interrupt those fault currents is specifically investigated by means of simulations which considers the effect of circuit-breaker arc-voltage on the prospective fault current. Comparison between SF6 and vacuum extinguishing technologies is presented.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Delayed Current Zeros in Synchronous Compensator Plants","doi":"10.1109/ICRERA47325.2019.8996507","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICRERA47325.2019.8996507","venue":"2019 8th International Conference on Renewable Energy Research and Applications (ICRERA)"}

We have reported previously that exposure of three different rodent tumour cell lines (K HT-LP 1, B 16-F 10 and SCC-VII) to extreme hypoxia (< 0.03% 02) in vitro, followed by a recovery period (18-24 hr) under normalconditions, can induce a significant increase (> 10-fold) in the metastatic potential of the tumour cells, as assessed in an experimental metastasis assay. We have also shown that cells exposed to hypoxia in vivo, i.e. cells isolated from hypoxic regions of tumours, demonstrate an increase (2-3 fold) in metastatic potential, particularly when allowed a 24 hr recovery period in vitro. Longer periods of recovery result in the exposed cell population losing its increased metastatic ability. Recent lywe have found that KHT-LP1 or B 16-FI cells exposed to acidity (pH 6.5) or glucose starvation in vitro for periods of 24 a.8 hr demonstrate a large increase in metastatic ability (> 10 fold) when allowed to recover in normal medium for a similar period of time. To investigate possible reasons for this increased metastatic potential, we have examined the ability of the tumour cells to invade through Matrigel-coated millipore filters. Both KHT-LPI and SCC-VII cells were found to demonstrate increased invasive capacity (ratio: treated/control = 4-5) after exposure to (24 hr) and recovery from (24 hr) extreme hypoxia. Similar results were obtained for KHT-LP1 cells exposed to glucose starvation for 2 a. a .Shrfol lowedbyasimilarrecovery period but SCC-VII cells showed only a small effect following such exposures. When examined in a biochemical assay, KHT-LP 1 cells were found to contain increased levels (factor 1.7) of the proteolytic enzymes Cathepsin L and B after hypoxic exposure but not after glucose starvation. No change in levels of these enzymes was noted in the SCC-VII cells. Northern blot analysis of tumour cells exposed to stress conditions is in progress to examine the expression of metastasis-related genes. These results suggest that conditions in tumours may affect the progression of the cells to a more malignant phenotype.

We sought to identify the causative pathogen in individual cases of pediatric outpatient with RTIs and to determine whether particular clinical features of RTIs are associated with particular viruses.\n\n\nMETHODS\nOver 3 years, we prospectively collected nasopharyngeal aspirate specimens from individual pediatric outpatients with an RTI accompanied by persistent fever (>3 days, ≥38.0°C) and peak temperature ≥39.0°C. Two methods-(1) viral culture for respiratory viruses and (2) real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays identifying 9 different respiratory viruses and 2 respiratory bacteria-were used to test specimens.\n\n\nRESULTS\nFor 495 specimens, viral culture and real-time PCR assays together identified at least 1 pathogen in 83.0% and ≥1 viruses alone in 79.4%. These 2 methods identified 138 children with respiratory syncytial virus, 66 with human metapneumovirus, 73 with parainfluenza viruses, 124 with adenovirus, 23 with rhinovirus, 38 with enterovirus, 11 with influenza type C virus, 15 with Mycoplasma pneumoniae and 3 with Chlamydophila pneumoniae; the coinfection rate was 19.7% among all infections. Among the patients with single-pathogen infections, the rate of lower RTI was 37.6% for respiratory syncytial virus, 40.7% for human metapneumovirus, 18.2% for parainfluenza viruses and 2.2% for adenovirus (P < 0.01).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nViral culture and real-time PCR assays were used together to identify causative pathogens in 83% of febrile outpatient children with RTI; specific viruses were associated with particular clinical diagnoses.","inCitations":["72ccf0f35644ef7efe30597b401df041fe1cbfb3","43025f1a0752f270882c91d703a747e1a48615fa","e26fc50bbe16e4a4c8bffabc5a0d2ac0f2e603f9","0a851d4005336287cd41901a8fcd0ba3bab686c9","b85919ec2ccdc07f31ef2b5b945fe28a69ec302d","6fb3aa75d9d9ccff93e8ac2b6643336551159218","fa8fe63fdfcebc78c072d5f97e5845a64b2874e0","f6a9efffd6ed1bf8d50745ad7b276cd299930d60","e18ca686e912010947b7702e3793264b9e518135","33a165fbe54b5c61883774462eae240a019fc060","8f373ec94dd18fb8f52cdc0167f3dcd27d010835","01023c82de865b9434e237429c8c0b96ea0d93cd","b2a14bbf54877f52ff60561788ea1d83a9e71901","d24b9ee5f6da8aad4daaa035c86598c1f29c19d5","59d9e6a7e58060c1df5b9df490cac6878a1f628b"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Three-year study of viral etiology and features of febrile respiratory tract infections in Japanese pediatric outpatients.","doi":"10.1097/INF.0000000000000227","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1097/INF.0000000000000227","venue":"The Pediatric infectious disease journal"}

The ER responds to the disturbances by activating mechanisms that increase the capacity to eliminate ER stress. This article elucidates the effects of ER activation that eliminates both ER stress and associated cardiovascular, type 2 diabetic (DM2), and other metabolic diseases. ER-activating compounds eliminate ER stress by lowering elevated cholesterol, regress atherosclerosis, decrease cardiovascular mortality, reduce blood glucose and insulin, and, together with the normalization of glucose-insulin homeostasis, remove insulin resistance, pancreatic β-cell failure, and DM2. A deficient cytochrome P450 activity in hepatic ER leads to cholesterol accumulation that induces stress and xanthoma formation, whereas P450-activating therapy up-regulates apolipoprotein AI and LDLR genes, down-regulates apolipoprotein B gene, and produces an antiatherogenic plasma lipoprotein profile. The ER activation reduces the stress also by eliminating hepatic fat and converting saturated fatty acids (FAs) to unsaturated FAs. Cognitive processes require gene expression modification, and preclinical studies indicate that ER-activating therapy improves cognition. Promotion of healthy lifestyle choices and indicated therapies are key factors in the prevention and elimination of ER stress and associated global health problems.","inCitations":["5a881aa948de36c49b41325ff43305555e8b826c","4b67384de4ab646c74713a3700670bee66e8b9e5","67ae30c635b2505b897e503f7375b20e4b470d56","1d183a7d3df61a5eb2afa15636b9568d08968866","94a9b3aac720ef7e58a774f3f6fd0c7f8de05ba3","a4d38777542b7083a8ba4692efa3c5577bd52a04","6d0ed68aa2dfa87335f5ee6129aa300ccaf1d616","48ad9df5cf2ec48486239afe666920efd5ec74c9","d15897d8e465f90e2266ac925b16992775df2dba","53a1e274c7e38d0306e0d83b2fbf1c55bf3ce31a"],"pdfUrls":["https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/pmc/oa_pdf/b0/6e/ANN-45-194.PMC3581057.pdf"],"title":"Elimination of endoplasmic reticulum stress and cardiovascular, type 2 diabetic, and other metabolic diseases","doi":"10.3109/07853890.2012.700116","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.3109/07853890.2012.700116","venue":"Annals of medicine"}

Clinical assessments by supragingival plaque (PL+), gingival index (GI), bleeding on probing (BOP), probing depth (PD), clinical attachment level (CAL) and subgingival plaque collection for microbiological analysis were made prior to and after treatment. Multiplex Polymerase Chain Reaction was used to determine the presence of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Campylobacter rectus, Eikenella corrodens, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella intermedia, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythensis and Treponema denticola. GI, PD, CAL and the number of BOP+ sites underwent a significant reduction over time in both groups. When compared to baseline, the pair-wise analyses showed significantly lower PD and CAL at 6 months in the CG and significant reductions in the GI, PD, CAL and a number of BOP+ sites at 3 and 6 months in the TG. For microbiological results, significant reductions were seen for C. rectus and R. gingivalis in the CG and for T. forsythensis, E. corrodens and T. denticola in the TG.

Both ultrasonic and manual debridement are equally effective in non-surgical periodontal therapy of severe periodontitis in terms of clinical and microbiological effects.","inCitations":["2779415deaea8c3200e907ccb649154bb3cd88fa","156370bcfcebbd8ef744d5f133516c241106221f","4a3d52483149c2d8decf2c1159843bcfb2d08f56","e9fb15d68d35b9e0a9049b49e7631904accdb59e","906a78df27687dded8e213529cf7414a8f05a24f","0dbdd4057256fd5baad740321574aae242065601","c4044806e92bb240bba9ba53213305126464732f","129d296ebfcba41e4404c3a641b054e7fa2879cd","9f5e62f7a3b9f0e8336a9f6672df6ef07a91b250","b6457716f1ffa29ad921d2d4380aad27e37a05fe","06a48a43b8d72e7cb2eed017778bfdbbdcfe647d","a0be14a15c42f453d245906fbae8f7ed3e7d9b8c"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.newmicrobiologica.org/PUB/allegati_pdf/2006/2/Micro2_04_D'Ercole.pdf"],"title":"Effectiveness of ultrasonic instruments in the therapy of severe periodontitis: a comparative clinical-microbiological assessment with curettes.","doi":"","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"The new microbiologica"}

The technology would take less than a minute to use, and it could be accessed from anywhere at any time. Wouldn’t all clinicians want to use a system like this? \n \nThere is no question that physicians in every specialty are well trained and have a vast knowledge base. Physicians go through countless hours of training during medical school, residency, and fellowship in addition to acquiring experience during their postgraduate work. Their comprehensive education provides them with a unique set of skills that allows them to effectively take care of patients in both an inpatient and out-patient capacity. \n \nHowever, having a wealth of knowledge does not make physicians infallible; human error is an inevitable consequence that occurs regularly in practice. Furthermore, errors come with a high cost; erroneous diagnoses are typically the primary or second-leading cause of malpractice claims.1 \n \nMost claims filed against physicians result from only a small number of causes, such as a failure to diagnose an infection, a heart attack, or a venous thromboembolism. These conditions can occasionally present in an unusual manner and might not be included in a physician’s differential diagnosis. As a result, a system that would supplement clinical knowledge with important information about unusual symptoms would likely be in high demand. \n \nThis is the viewpoint advocated by Jason Maude, cofounder of Isabel Healthcare. In 1999, his daughter Isabel was incorrectly diagnosed with chickenpox. Instead, she had two rare but well-known complications of chickenpox—toxic shock syndrome and necrotizing fasciitis. Her father formed Isabel Healthcare that same year, with the goal of decreasing misdiagnoses. He spearheaded the development of a Web-based checklist system (Isabel) that was designed to assist clinicians who were uncertain about their diagnoses. \n \nUsers of the system pull data from a patient’s chief complaint and medical history, and Isabel generates a brief list of the most probable diagnoses. Included in this list are two or three “can’t-miss” diagnoses that the clinician can rule out immediately. Isabel can be accessed from anywhere and can be integrated into various electronic medical record (EMR) systems so that there is no need for redundant data entry by the clinician. Isabel also directs the clinician to relevant literature about these conditions and provides information about the gold-standard treatment for each illness. Isabel has correctly diagnosed diseases in several complex scenarios, and the American Medical Association has selected Isabel for its new physician portal. \n \nNaturally, physicians might be skeptical of a powerful computer program that could be perceived as a substitute for the clinical experience that medical professionals have accumulated over years of training and with their thousands of patient encounters. However, according to Jason Maude, the system’s development was not meant to replace a doctor’s clinical experience; instead, he explains, Isabel can serve as a valuable supplement to a doctor’s clinical knowledge. During a telephone inter view, Mr. Maude emphasized that the clinician is still essential to the practice of medicine. He said that Isabel is like a library, a tool for clinicians to extract appropriate questions that they might not otherwise ask. He correctly points out that physicians need to accept that it is not possible for humans to know (and remember) everything. \n \nWhen should Isabel be used? \n \nDecision-support systems should not be relied on in every case. A physician’s clinical training and the ability to evaluate the severity of subjective symptoms cannot be replicated by a computer program. However, a system like Isabel can be a valuable resource for learning about patients with atypical symptoms and those patients who are not responding to traditional treatments. Isabel can also be integrated into the teaching curricula of medical education at all levels. Encouraging physicians-in-training to compare their own differential diagnoses with those supplied by Isabel could both supplement their knowledge and give them greater confidence when they treat patients. A system like this is especially relevant to PT it could reassure the clinician that the right drug is being administered correctly by removing doubts about dosing and reducing errors in prescribing. Isabel has the potential to improve quality and safety in our institutions. \n \nMost important, decision-support systems such as Isabel may serve as a way to usher in an important change to the culture of medicine. It is impossible, even for subspecialists, to know everything about every disease that they encounter in practice. Physicians, as a rule, do not tolerate uncertainty well; many physicians feel that uncertainty can mask deficiencies within their knowledge base. However, providing a new generation of physicians with decision-support tools can help eliminate these fears and improve care by encouraging compliance with standards established by evidence-based medicine. \n \nAs always, I’m interested in your views.

Clini E, Foglio K, Bianchi L, Porta R, Vitacca M, Ambrosino N. Reprinted with permission from Chest. 120(5):1500-1505. © 2001 American College of Chest Physicians. Objective: To compare the functional benefits and relative costs of administering an intense short-term inpatient vs a longer outpatient pulmonary rehabilitation program (PRP) for patients with chronic airway obstruction (CAO). Design: Retrospective case-control study. Setting: Pulmonary ward and outpatient clinic of a rehabilitation center. Patients: Forty-three patients (case subjects) selected on the basis of selection criteria were compared with control subjects matched to them for age, sex, FEV(1), and diagnosis of either COPD or asthma. Case subjects performed 10 to 12 daily sessions (5 sessions a week) of inpatient PRP; control subjects performed 20 to 24 sessions (3 sessions a week) of outpatient PRP. Measurements: At baseline and after the PRP, an incremental exercise test was performed, including evaluation of dyspnea and leg fatigue by Borg scale (D and F, respectively) at each workload step. The cost of PRP was also evaluated. Results: Both PRPs resulted in similar significant improvements in cycloergometry peak workload (from 68±18to 82±22and from 75±17to 87±27W in case subjects and control subjects, respectively), isoload D (from 6.4 ± 1.6 to 4.2 ± 1.8 for case subjects and from 8.5 ± 1.9 to 6.3 ± 2.4 for control subjects) and isoload F (from 6.6 ± 1.8 to 4.2 ± 1.8 for case subjects and from 8.9 ± 1.9 to 7.0 ± 1.8 for control subjects). Although the single daily session was less expensive, the outpatient PRP total costs were greater because of the higher number of sessions and the cost of daily transportation. Conclusions: In patients with CAO, a shorter inpatient PRP may result in improvement in exercise tolerance similar to a longer outpatient PRP but with lower costs. Whether a shorter outpatient PRP may get physiologic and clinical benefits, while further reducing costs, must be evaluated by future controlled, randomized, prospective studies. Effect of Exercise Training on Postexercise Oxygen Uptake Kinetics in Patients With Reduced Ventricular Function. Myers J, Gianrossi R, Schwitter J, Wagner D, Dubach P. Reprinted with permission from Chest. 120(4):1206-1211. © 2001 American College of Chest Physicians. Background: The time required for oxygen uptake (02) to return to baseline level (recovery kinetics) is prolonged in patients with reduced ventricular function, and the degree to which it is prolonged is related to the severity of heart failure, markers of abnormal ventilation, and prognosis. In the present study, we sought to determine the effect of exercise training on O1 recovery kinetics in patients with reduced ventricular function. Methods: Twenty-four male patients with reduced ventricular function after a myocardial infarction were randomized to either a 2-month high-intensity residential exercise training program or to a control group. O, kinetics in recovery from maximal exercise were calculated before and after the study period and expressed as the slope of a single exponential relation between 02 and time during the first 3 min of recovery. Results: Peak 0, increased significantly in the exercise group (19.4 ± 3.0 mL/kg/min vs 25.1 ± 4.7 mL/kg/min, p < 0.05), whereas no change was observed in control subjects. The 0, half-time in recovery was reduced slightly after the study period in both groups (108.7 ± 33.1 to 102.1 ± 50.5 s in the exercise group and 122.3 ± 68.7 to 107.5 ± 36.0 s in the control group); neither the change within or between groups was significant. The degree to which 0, was prolonged in recovery was inversely related to measures of exercise capacity (peak 0,, watts achieved, and exercise time; r = 0.48 to 0.57; p < 0.01) and directly related to the peak ventilatory equivalents for oxygen (r = 0.59, p < 0.01) and carbon dioxide (r = 0.57, p < 0.01). Conclusion: Two months of high-intensity training did not result in a faster recovery of 0, in patients with reduced ventricular function. This suggests that adaptations to exercise training manifest themselves only during, but not in, recovery from exercise. Discharge Criteria From Perioperative Physical Therapy. Brooks D, Parsons J, Newton J, et al. Reprinted with permission from Chest. 121:488-494. © 2002 American College of Chest Physicians. Objectives: To develop valid and reliable hospital discharge criteria and a scoring system that would be used to assess when a patient should be discharged from perioperative physical therapy (PT) care. Design: We developed the postoperative physiotherapy discharge scoring tool (POPDST), a tool composed of objective criteria and a scoring system that would be used to determine when a patient should be discharged from perioperative PT. It is a composite score of the following five subcategories: mobility; breath sounds; secretion clearance; oxygen saturation; and respiratory rate. The score for the POP-DST ranges from 6 to 15, with a score of > 13 indicating readiness for discharge. We examined the content validity of the POP-DST using focus groups and a mailed survey. To determine interrater reliability, two therapists, who were blinded to each other's scores, assessed postsurgical patients. Validity was examined by comparing the decision to discharge based on the score on the POP-DST to the decision to discharge according to the therapist's judgment. In addition, subjects who were discharged from PT were followed-up 7 to 10 days later to determine whether they had developed any subsequent respiratory problems. Patients: One hundred four surgical patients were assessed to determine the reliability and validity of the POP-DST. For the ability of the test to detect postoperative complications following discharge from PT, 204 surgical patients were followed-up after discharge from PT. Results: Interrater reliability was moderately high (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.76; r = 0.77). There was strong agreement between the decision to discharge the patient from PT based on the tool criteria compared to the therapist's judgment (kappa range, 0.91 to 0.96). The ability of the POP-DST to predict those patients who would not develop complications postoperatively was 94%. Conclusion: The results indicate that the POP-DST would facilitate clinical decision making related to PT discharge planning in postsurgical populations. The instrument demonstrated strong content validity and predictive validity, as well as high levels of interobserver agreement. This tool should be considered as a work in progress until it is more fully validated. 34 Cardiopulmonary Physical Therapy Vol 13 S No 2 June 2002","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Abstracts of current literature","doi":"10.1007/BF02759885","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/BF02759885","venue":""}

But in a structured peer-to-peer network, frequent joining and leaving may cause huge maintenance overhead. To deal with this churn problem, we proposed a two-tier architecture called adaptive sector-based routing model (ASBRM). In ASBRM the key space is divided into several sectors and each one has a super peer who plays the role of the relay proxy of the sector. When the number of peer members in a sector exceeds a predefined threshold, it will split into two sectors so that the traffic and computational overhead of the super peer can be kept within an acceptable range. For the convenience of explanation, we combine ASBRM with Chord and perform a series of simulations. Both analysis and simulation results show that ASBRM achieves lower communication cost of members' joining and leaving while at the same time the message routing path length is also shortened.","inCitations":["795fc8189190be002954cf49155d767a5c952b4b"],"pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1016/j.comnet.2012.11.006"],"title":"An adaptive sector-based routing model over structured peer-to-peer networks","doi":"10.1016/j.comnet.2012.11.006","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.comnet.2012.11.006","venue":"Comput.

Fe 3 S and e -Fe coexisted stably up to 220 GPa and 3300 K, and thus, Fe 3 S is likely to be the stable S-bearing iron alloy under the Earth's core conditions. The solid iron ( e -Fe) also contained 7.6(0.8) at.% of sulfur at 86 GPa and 2200 K. The amount of sulfur in the solid iron increased with increasing pressure at the eutectic temperatures. If the sulfur content obtained in this study is extrapolated to the conditions at the inner core, all the sulfur in the solid inner core can be stored in e -Fe. The eutectic composition becomes nonsensitive to pressure and seems to be constant around 20 at.% of sulfur at pressures above 40 GPa. The pressure gradient of the melting curve of the Fe–FeS system is 13.4(0.7) K/GPa. Based on our results of melting relationship, the temperature at the core–mantle boundary should be greater than 2850(100) K, assuming that sulfur is the only light element in the Earth's liquid outer core.","inCitations":["d5244208897720943cb976fadc238fc6d428ef57","e48791c8c66b82826431c01c879f8f78d2180964","23f67843a3d3b53a4bbb86bd339a868c8d46e67c","33b22f5a5d8bbfab2f2c62da119f3ee740e3588e","aabedb447d245b149d4a4031e34c0a29ba969b54","b69a4b141ff062c3813432bd66a3572d9413505b","72c26e9f605eefcc2f0652a555ef372464a0e05f","a0328eace6f24575025c84ac8e7a91e84fb15c63","6a1960294f88dd8d906560fbe73471aabb2bbc2a","fc3ca435ac168d8b2962b4e0185994cc43bcb4af","fdff5b3f60517cff6370ef5d6d98873e054f7804","61c57fd01b876b46332ce318dea4809ff5635677","779e03c4f75d9193151a216074df42e4cf0dce3d","8cadc8fedc97c1546e2cc98d6e38c4a2fb30442a","0a9bb053938abf73de3145f147121b00d04e86cf","ce62ff8ad93679e79fc1b134f1550fe6849d9f9c","a7f7d154e700b3fc410381ee21956f0711f07bce","9e50488e17ad0c7500d4be6dd70eb2bb804541b6"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Phase relationships of the Fe–FeS system in conditions up to the Earth's outer core","doi":"10.1016/j.epsl.2010.03.011","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.epsl.2010.03.011","venue":""}

The production of toxic oxygen products is a linear function of cell number, the duration of incubation, and the amount of immune complex employed. In the case of neutrophils, there is a direct relationship between the amounts of immune complex internalized, secretory release of lysosomal enzymes, and production of O-2 and H2O2. With both neutrophils as well as alveolar macrophages, maximal production of O-2 occurs with the largest complexes (formed under conditions of antigen equivalence). When limiting cell concentrations are used, alveolar macrophages produce considerably more oxygen products than an equivalent number of peritoneal neutrophils obtained from the same animals. Thus, alveolar macrophages as well as neutrophils represent important potential sources for the generation of toxic oxygen products in lung inflammatory reactions. Experiments have also been designed to estimate the relative contributions of neutrophils and alveolar macrophages in vivo during acute immune complex deposition in lung. The data indicate that both neutrophils and alveolar macrophages are activated by in vivo exposure to immune complexes, each cell type producing a 2-4-fold increase (over baseline levels) in the amounts of O-2. Thus, alveolar macrophages as well as neutrophils may play an important role in the generation of toxic oxygen products that have been incriminated in the pathogenesis of acute lung injury following deposition of immune complexes.","inCitations":["62505e2ef6a18a39d4ddcec81f9d21fb53eb4428","07f370247a6f6c4d6fe9d5cbe2e3ab478710d1df","6b78425349595d82dd23185fc5e9c0bcd32bd84c","ce0ba1ea4a9bea914efbd441e0fefc40e4705f86","c2b3a3271efc5eceb9f872fd24d9f03d35afa0cc","88c426f04149a6b473012902bbcb3def785b5f6a","e9298f8f4331ee95b11e609fd993ec08857c8918","ac4b6e44f6e72821a1fb62965c987aa2e3d6f55c","dfd66c537ec0d22d665f5915ace16f79d579b9ef","cb337c45068064b5d142691194d635f09f71e1ed","9e57564ca028d8f18397745321ae9d22bd01477d","4d4f8514f4c11fd743560a2f5a46fb0345a5fa14","cd8b6e74e202beb457152297d563e96130d5f7a9","526a36c0acbb9e312c299a20a70cb6a4efa3cedc","4a90a4c7ac4ae17e989d4da721253ca275f9bdb6","16a6475b974924fee10c123f463760444b4f5f35","b0249ebcff3033014f876dc872950df37a664bb0","2fe3a6490ace95c1892c248f805e759fb2c4e811","43bbd4ae44d5fa34408377f1ef0ea25a888f1153","1fe66bd246d9e61c97f751a41568c25744ef04e5","34a73382030bbae1c36fe6535b9b37cf82e3b1ce"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"In vitro and in vivo stimulation of rat neutrophils and alveolar macrophages by immune complexes.

To solve the problems, this paper proposes a set of computer-aided tools called “PVoT (Portable Virtual reality systems development Tool).” PVoT is designed based on the methodology, called “CLEVR (Con-current and LEvel by Level Development of VR systems),” a comprehensive collection of conventional and new concepts for building VR systems with three major philosophies [1]. With PVoT, one can design and immediately validate various aspects of the virtual reality systems in design reducing the temporal gap. This results in a highly interactive and seamless development environment. PVoT also collects performance data of all high-level elements in a given VR application and provides developers with a basis for performance prediction and tuning. The effectiveness of CLEVR/PVoT is demonstrated with case studies and an analysis of the development process.","inCitations":["d127cc0ed7b0b07c6099e3acf73d8431f5b1a585","a563dbb73b8d51c967c3f76e1c741a509fb587f6","bb10d376ee7b0a997fd5b7dc4c1d0b200596930a","67f339d8dedc243884ec7d29d809ba81b44a2c62","3b1db70596c5e1d5b5eac9ea7a418c53641f3c44"],"pdfUrls":["http://digilib.unsri.ac.id/download/20070403.pdf"],"title":"PVoT: An Interactive Authoring Tool for Virtual Reality","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Skin surface markers on T6, T10, T13, T18, L3, L5 and S3 were used to obtain FE ROM and the minimum and maximum angular motion pattern values (AMPmin and AMPmax) for T10, T13, T18, L3 and L5. Markers placed on left and right tuber coxae were used to obtain pelvic vertical displacement. Friedman's tests and post hoc Wilcoxon's signed ranks tests were used to determine the effects of water depth on measured variables.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe FE ROM of T10 (8.4°), T13 (8.1°), T18 (6.9°) and L3 (6.4°) when walking at high depth was significantly greater than control (5.5, 5.7, 5.1 and 5.1°, respectively; P<0.008); T13 AMPmin was significantly lower in high water (-3.0°) than control (0.1°, P = 0.001) and L3 AMPmax significantly greater in high water (-1.9°) than control (-4.8°, P = 0.001). There was no significant association between pelvic vertical displacement and water depth.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nWalking in high water causes cranial thoracic extension and thoracolumbar flexion when compared with walking in water at hoof depth. This postural change should be considered when designing rehabilitation programmes for horses with back and/or hindlimb pathology.","inCitations":["6bcf19fb87f0fea10b612a92b233b95d89cd1f33","91ce4d6710c61cb8816e49cad8cdd19eccc97bb6","e70e1d1393ab374506994d7af26f5a50ff94ba8d","4c6280e46edc1b0af6d4766952a5b515b47fb785","6c6a4764cfc1b965d7b9a228da5a3bae1e756afe","da2d6019f4805cdaa627961328c7b7980e20237f","d9c4da1a879ee3dcd8638f148a31032a42f39dca","777b4596ddf56ca9d3b566a76838805f49124164","e7cc1628a509300c4d421e856edee4dbb997fd1e","acefe57647f8c8c1725ad23b4d4673c77059106a"],"pdfUrls":["https://img1.wsimg.com/blobby/go/f4492349-b92e-4040-8e57-8a73fd21a66f/downloads/1d1uoa7h1_920093.pdf?ver=1569198867772","https://hartpury.pure.elsevier.com/ws/portalfiles/portal/8585602/Water_depth_modifies_back_kinematics_during_water_treadmill_exercise.pdf"],"title":"Water depth modifies back kinematics of horses during water treadmill exercise.","doi":"10.1111/evj.12519","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1111/evj.12519","venue":"Equine veterinary journal"}

The study was conducted by using a quantitative method with a pretest-posttest control group design. Subjects of the study were 16 middle managers in PT BAT Yogyakarta. The data used were collected using a self-efficacy scale. The data collected were analyzed using Mann Whitney test and Wilxocon Signed Ranks test. The results of analysis showed that there was difference in self-efficacy among middle managers between the experimental group and the control group viewed from difference in pretest-posttest score (Gained Score) with Z = -3.464 and p <0.05.

In this paper, nanosecond laser ablation of aluminum in air and water is investigated through a self-contained hydrodynamic model under different laser fluences involving no phase explosion and phase explosion. The ablation depths and profiles are predicted and validated against the literature data and experiments. In case of nanosecond laser ablation of aluminum in water, deeper crater depths are found in all the conditions studied in this work, which may be attributed to the combination effects of laser ablation and shock compression. The analysis of the shock compression in air and water indicates that the shock compression is mainly responsible for this enhancement of ablation in water.","inCitations":["defb873dcffd81dd399810a2b715137143893a72"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Analysis of nanosecond laser ablation of aluminum with and without phase explosion in air and water","doi":"10.2351/1.4794032","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.2351/1.4794032","venue":""}

Impacts from 10–100 meter size NEAs are not statistically life-threatening, but may cause significant regional damage, while 1–10 meter size NEAs with low velocities relative to Earth are compelling targets for space missions. We describe the implementation and initial results of a real-time NEA-discovery system specialized for the detection of small, high angular rate (visually streaked) NEAs in Palomar Transient Factory (PTF) images. PTF is a 1.2-m aperture, 7.3 deg^2 field of view (FOV) optical survey designed primarily for the discovery of extragalactic transients (e.g., supernovae) in 60-second exposures reaching ~20.5 visual magnitude. Our real-time NEA discovery pipeline uses a machine-learned classifier to filter a large number of false-positive streak detections, permitting a human scanner to efficiently and remotely identify real asteroid streaks during the night. Upon recognition of a streaked NEA detection (typically within an hour of the discovery exposure), the scanner triggers follow-up with the same telescope and posts the observations to the Minor Planet Center for worldwide confirmation. We describe our 11 initial confirmed discoveries, all small NEAs that passed 0.3–15 lunar distances from Earth. Lastly, we derive useful scaling laws for comparing streaked-NEA-detection capabilities of different surveys as a function of their hardware and survey-pattern characteristics. This work most directly informs estimates of the streak-detection capabilities of the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF, planned to succeed PTF in 2017), which will apply PTF's current resolution and sensitivity over a 47-deg^2 FOV.","inCitations":["ac3bee2888f3fec222be1569ed2f4b6ce45e2b17","d9a625c0e6a51011dab8bda30e7c2e2ed378efe4","c3ba98325c7dad03b471e41f02b04a9e6f579894","958da45ee7621c7509e89d70f4238a60a3db2b51"],"pdfUrls":["http://authors.library.caltech.edu/74089/2/1609.08018.pdf","https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.08018v1.pdf"],"title":"Small Near-Earth Asteroids in the Palomar Transient Factory Survey: A Real-Time Streak-detection System","doi":"10.1088/1538-3873/129/973/034402","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1088/1538-3873%2F129%2F973%2F034402","venue":""}

Few studies examined prospective-longitudinal associations of FS not meeting criteria for PA with the subsequent onset of mental disorders to clarify the role of FS as risk markers of psychopathology.\n\n\nMETHOD\nA representative community sample of adolescents and young adults (N = 3021, age 14-24 at baseline) was prospectively followed up in up to 3 assessment waves over up to 10 years. FS, PA, anxiety, depressive, and substance use disorders were assessed using the DSM-IV/M-CIDI. Odds Ratios (OR) from logistic regressions were used to examine the predictive value of FS-only (no PA) and PA at baseline for incident disorders at follow-up.\n\n\nRESULTS\nIn logistic regressions adjusted for sex and age, FS-only predicted the onset of any subsequent disorder, any anxiety disorder, panic disorder, agoraphobia, GAD, social phobia, any depressive disorder, major depression, and dysthymia (ORs 1.54-4.36); PA predicted the onset of any anxiety disorder, panic disorder, GAD, social phobia, any depressive disorder, major depression, dysthymia, any substance use disorder, alcohol abuse/dependence, and nicotine dependence (ORs 2.08-8.75; reference group: No FS-only and no PA). Associations with psychopathology were slightly smaller for FS-only than for PA, however, differences in associations (PA compared to FS-only) only reached significance for any anxiety disorder (OR = 3.26) and alcohol abuse/dependence (OR = 2.26).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nFindings suggest that compared to PA, FS-only have similar predictive properties regarding subsequent psychopathology and might be useful for an early identification of high-risk individuals.","inCitations":["ae6dae4761ff2ccd1dedd65b27b03bfc9ae62daa","9f435ae0780fbc461c13ff54dbf8cbf2c19cbac7","e818d697e1e630c5654584eae22feb7f84f900d1","cea8aa1e47b50e896c54310dc6d4f804ae22f423","239f5493932412419acfc0d1d5b7d5cb2ea06c5b","0c80445d3c1e38c9ce4050c60c47df2eeb683da6","adf2b837ef0b40da167ef8023341d4b536e59849","f992ab46f8b6cf3de5afe55bd27530ddb0c2cd0c","adf338ddd1d6b0be96c8508e6f23a73bd6ed08bc","ae47817dd4e37e606e90597e3c003d57e6722bb4","447ba898ca502e3c7c359938e685d65ca4699ce8","5d68b0ae55a9bc5b738ac01404254469c2c28b06","da3b04d66cc7ed894f490c6d6c3b01d4f5903be5","7d2225d87163ed48a348509e008c7c6f022fdc24","58e1e2cc351e8c1e150cada1b1608bd8da3ff6a0","6517f261dd715756477b940ebdfe121c8a633173","51d885edca80c72e1be2bc47e54ef93a1569a90a","b7c2891f63a72a2b5769660ea3151552392fd2cf","c34c0a7cda6c218ddaa6b0a099fbed09c01be3a2"],"pdfUrls":["http://isiarticles.com/bundles/Article/pre/pdf/75360.pdf"],"title":"Associations of fearful spells and panic attacks with incident anxiety, depressive, and substance use disorders: a 10-year prospective-longitudinal community study of adolescents and young adults.","doi":"10.1016/j.jpsychires.2014.04.001","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2014.04.001","venue":"Journal of psychiatric research"}

O projeto foi retomado no quinto semestre na disciplina de comportamento do consumidor, com uma pesquisa a fim de investigar a viabilidade da abertura da empresa na cidade de Sao Borja e quais metodos ela deveria adotar. O objetivo era criar um site de encomendas virtual, onde a arrecadacao partiria dos espacos de publicidade dentro do site, criando paginas personalizadas para as empresas. Em um primeiro momento o site foi pensado para os servicos de lanche na cidade. O site aproximaria o cliente da empresa, pois se pode informar todas as especificacoes do seu lanche na pagina do Delivery, evitando problemas na producao das encomendas, alem de informar a forma de pagamento. Depois da criacao do Delivery surgiu a duvida: Seria lucrativo investir nesse produto? Nossa incerteza foi sanada no quinto semestre com uma pesquisa acerca do comportamento do consumidor e-commerce em Sao Borja. Foram seguidas duas linhas de pesquisa, uma qualitativa e outra quantitativa, alem de buscar dados secundarios com pesquisas realizadas pelo IBGE sobre a populacao do municipio. Inicialmente foi feita a pesquisa exploratoria e qualitativa para levantar hipoteses de perfil de consumidor, atraves de questoes roteirizadas, que foi verificada na pesquisa com dados externos. A segunda pesquisa, descritiva, buscava compreender quem era esse consumidor, como, quanto, quando e onde consumia os lanches (34% dos entrevistados costumam comprar lanches de tres a quatro vezes na semana), aliada a uma pesquisa prognostica que buscava revelar os futuros habitos de consumo do publico alvo. Foram utilizados dois metodos de coleta, o primeiro de forma exploratoria e qualitativa, atraves de formularios roteirizados. O segundo metodo utilizado foram questoes fechadas de multipla escolha, atraves de formulario online no Google Docs. A primeira pesquisa foi qualitativa e buscava identificar o perfil do publico alvo no universo de 25 pessoas, atraves de entrevistas de profundidade dirigidas individualmente. Partindo disso, foi realizada a pesquisa quantitativa com o universo de 9445 pessoas, onde o calculo amostral com erro de 5% e confiabilidade de 90%, resultando a pesquisa em um universo possivel de 420 pessoas. Avaliando as respostas obtidas se provou que e viavel a implantacao do sistema de Delivery Online em Sao Borja, baseado no fato que foi identificado que as pessoas da cidade tem o habito de fazer compras na internet. Outro dado relevante e a frequencia que as pessoas encomendam, onde o maior indice apresentado sobressai o dobro das demais alternativas. Conclui-se que o DeliverySB funcionaria em Sao Borja, vendendo principalmente para a faixa etaria de 20 a 30 anos. Os sistemas de pagamento adotados seriam em cartao e dinheiro, de forma presencial com a maquina de cartao, pois mesmo que haja uma maioria que paga com cartao de credito/debito a diferenca para o dinheiro foi minima.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Delivery Sb: Planejamento E Pesquisa Do Site De Encomendas Online De São Borja","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

J. Smart Nano Mat. DOI: 10.1080/19475411.2014.885913) exhibits this carboneous raw material as a multi-level fractal structure of nanosize fragments of reduced graphene oxide (rGO). In view of the extraordinary importance of the rGO starting material for the current molecular graphene technology, the natural rGO deposits turns out to be quite challenging, making it highly necessary to prove the reliability of the proposed rGO concept of shungite. Once consistent with all the block of the available geological and physical-chemical data obtained during the last few decades, the concept nonetheless needs a direct confirmation in terms of the current graphene science. The first such acknowledgement has been received just recently when studying photoluminescence (PL) of shungite dispersions (arXiv:1308.2569v2 [cond-mat.mes-hall]). A close similarity of PL spectra of aqueous dispersion of shungite and those of synthetic graphene quantum dots of the rGO origin has been established. The current paper presents the next direct confirmation supplied with neutron scattering. Elastic neutron diffraction and inelastic neutron scattering have left no doubts concerning both graphene-like configuration and chemical composition of basic structural elements of shungite attributing the latter to rGO nanosize sheets with an average 11:1:3 (C:O:H) atomic content ratio. The experimental data are supplemented with quantum-chemical calculations that allowed suggesting a clear vision of the shungite structure at its first nanolevels.","inCitations":["9f814e4c0d3ea48495302fd0163d6b1aab056502"],"pdfUrls":["https://arxiv.org/pdf/1403.4920v2.pdf"],"title":"Shungite in view of neutron scattering","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

The field reliability that was attained from using functional screening on an example product is presented. Because of the exceptionally low failure occurrence now possible in today's products, some simple alternative reliability monitoring statistics based on the binomial are suggested. Implications of this improved reliability on the effectiveness of screening methods is discussed, and the notion of field failures as screening escapes is introduced. Then some reasons to experiment with functional stress screens in place of a total reliance on the more traditional environmental stress screens are presented. Finally, the characteristics of functional screens are presented. Careful experimentation using appropriate statistical analysis in developing and comparing screening approaches is emphasized throughout this paper.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Functional screens for electronic reliability","doi":"10.1002/qre.4680030105","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1002/qre.4680030105","venue":""}

Rhus verniciflua Stokes (RVS) has traditionally been used as an ingredient in East Asian medicine for the treatment of gastritis, stomach cancer and atherosclerosis. The aim of the current study was to analyze the effect of RVS on LPS‑induced inflammatory responses in the RAW264.7 mouse macrophage cell line. RAW264.7 cells were treated with various concentrations of RVS and LPS at specific time points. WST assay, trypan blue assay and quantification of activated cells revealed that RVS suppressed cell proliferation in a dose‑dependent manner. RVS induced G1 cell cycle arrest, suppressed iNOS and COX‑2 mRNA expression induced by LPS and decreased intracellular ROS levels induced by LPS. In addition, RVS induced PARP and caspase‑3 cleavage suggesting that RVS causes cell death. Results of the present study indicate that RVS may be advantageous in treating inflammatory disease.","inCitations":["dd19af5793cd2a959a36658862d23297057323ae","711270c684544405a285cf6b73c08705d716fa8a","9c5b117233d8705b9d2c21126a5d28cc31a49105","0829ec61c6133facd4f0729159a6f3708cdfe89b","147581e1fb0a84311314b21b040605da639c0c6e","e5cb5b4f7d54e5e2601af58da652013ba9168730","2902636713af18d100ad25d2c0e42668a21ac81b"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Anti‑inflammatory and anti‑proliferative effects of Rhus verniciflua Stokes in RAW264.7 cells.","doi":"10.3892/mmr.2013.1775","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.3892/mmr.2013.1775","venue":"Molecular medicine reports"}
