In western Lake Ontario 90% of the diet comprised alewife and smelt. In the Niagara River the principal food items were smelt, emerald shiner, common shiner, and bluntnose minnow and in eastern Lake Erie the principal items were smelt, emerald shiner, and trout-perch. Nonfish material was rarely observed. Methods for studying the diets of common terns on the Great Lakes are examined.Three indicators of food availability were examined in 1979 at the Eastern Headland in western Lake Ontario: (1) percentage fish accepted by chicks, (2) foraging time, and (3) chick growth. More food was presented to the chicks than they could eat. Food acceptance levels increased with chick age and brood size and ranged from 43.5 to 91.5%. Foraging trip times were 17.2 min on average and, depending on brood size, tern pairs spent an estimated 45–64% of daylight hours foraging for food for their chicks.

Zwar lassen sich Kaisers programmatische Texte als Versuche interpretieren, mithilfe religioser Deutungen die Legitimationsprobleme seiner widerspruchlichen Dramatik zu losen; diese Interpretation setzt sich jedoch dem Einwand aus, Kaiser habe die messianische Programmatik den skeptischen Perspektiven seiner Stucke erst nachtraglich aufgesetzt. Zwei bislang unveroffentlichte Briefe Kaisers an Landauer ermoglichen demgegenuber den Nachweis, das Kaiser die zentralen Thesen dieser Programmatik bereits zur Zeit der Arbeit an seinen expressionistischen Stucken ab 1917 in Anspruch nimmt. Dieser Befund ist nicht nur fur die Spezialforschung interessant, die Landauers Beitrag zu Kaisers mystischem Literaturverstandnis bislang vernachlassigt hat. Als einer der zentralen Dramatiker des Expressionismus ware Kaiser auch fur die aktuelle Epochenforschung von Interesse, die das Verhaltnis der literarischen Moderne zur Sakralisierung der Literatur uneinheitlich bewertet.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Sakramentaler Expressionismus?

We summarize three different Gr\\\"obner bases implementations: shared memory parallel, pure distributed memory parallel and distributed memory combined with shared memory parallelism. The last algorithm, called distributed hybrid, uses only one control communication channel between the master node and the worker nodes and keeps polynomials in shared memory on a node. The polynomials are transported asynchronous to the control-flow of the algorithm in a separate distributed data structure. The implementation is generic and works for all implemented (exact) fields.

These synthetic equivalents enabled incorporation of the polar head group of FTY720, through Julia, Wittig, and Horner-Wadsworth-Emmons reactions and also allowed for variation in the chain length of the lipophilic side chain in target, through the Weinreb amide functionality therein. The use of tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane, commercially available at low cost for the polar head group offers a distinct advantage. Convenient reactions and simple functional group interconversions in good to high yield highlight the strength of the new route developed for the synthesis of clinically important FTY720.","inCitations":["4a2acac1ed76f8d4a300cab7b415c484adf7cad6","7443ec795830d0d783c6f7c39022d376b3e2d8a5"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Weinreb amide based new synthetic equivalents for convenient access to immunosuppressive agent FTY720 and analogues","doi":"10.1055/s-2007-990961","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1055/s-2007-990961","venue":""}

The authors conducted 43 interviews with automakers and dealers selling plug-in vehicles in California’s major metro markets and analyzed data on customer satisfaction with new car dealers and Tesla retail stores. The initial findings revealed: • Plug-in vehicle buyers rated the dealer purchase experience much lower than conventional vehicle buyers while Tesla earned industry-high scores; • Plug-in vehicles returned higher dealer gross profits but may insufficiently compensate for greater demands, including the provision of support services beyond traditional offerings; • Public incentives could better align with established dealer practices and business drivers to improve program effectiveness. The authors consider how pre-existing retail configurations and arms-length manufacturer-dealer relations in the traditional franchised model could both enable and hinder retail innovations for PEVs. The paper considers implications and opportunities for policy.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Zero-Emission Vehicles and Retail Innovation in the U.S. Automotive Sector: The Consumer Purchase Experience and Dealer Engagement","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Hyperbaric oxygen therapy influences recovery from sudden sensorineural hearing loss, but the underlying mechanism is unknown and the appropriate indications and protocols undetermined.\n\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nNineteen patients affected by sudden sensorineural hearing loss were treated after unsuccessful medical therapy, either in an acute or chronic setting. Pure oxygen inhalation at 2.5 atmospheres absolute pressure was administered for 90 minutes, for 30 sessions. Frequency-specific and average pure tone hearing thresholds were determined before and after hyperbaric oxygen therapy. The number of hyperbaric oxygen therapy sessions, the patient's age and any therapeutic delay were considered as quantitative variables possibly influencing outcome. Stepwise multivariate analysis was performed.\n\n\nRESULTS\nSalvage hyperbaric oxygen therapy appeared to improve patients' pure tone hearing thresholds, particularly at low frequencies. Positive results were more likely with increased patient age and reduced delay in receiving hyperbaric oxygen therapy.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nHyperbaric oxygen therapy has a strong scientific rationale, and improves pure tone hearing thresholds in cases of sudden sensorineural hearing loss unresponsive to medical therapy. Further research may be able to identify those patients with sudden sensorineural hearing loss for whom hyperbaric oxygen therapy would be most cost-effective.","inCitations":["d443b6cd6ad12ed73ac982f57ba15ae0a4515fa7","d449104859d241dcf1722baf48c3607a477884a2","019607f02f401324f462724ba25eff1d450d7ada","fb9d78ec86d08d647187573f3c953fa0166846da","973ac2590b4f0880081830512b176d7dad3170e7","45a72b83d98478c914acd1730f39da209ef6c688","f99b3b1f78e93a457e9b5c251f4c525d85993340","b7981e16996ea64ff008ae8960ae06dd78df048b","c30240d512746b24b235793b833e5e95718e0f15","bc5d2ee2f4fbb155b5c38724225d45d925b85808","5adb097636e8ab20811b18e76d3ca18577bf0b54","1d8001896dd9cb9a6e5941228f46414abc8488e9","b46e802db46df8413c95f81c94348076b3d5f439"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.practicalreviews.com/My_Media/PDF/Otolaryngology%20-%20HNS,%20August%2015%202010.pdf"],"title":"Hyperbaric oxygen therapy as salvage treatment for sudden sensorineural hearing loss: review of rationale and preliminary report.","doi":"10.1017/S0022215109992052","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1017/S0022215109992052","venue":"The Journal of laryngology and otology"}

In this paper, a winter wheat field of 28.5 hm2 under traditional cultivation model in Tianzhuang town of Huantai county was selected as the research area. Sampling by mesh point method (60×60m), the variation characteristics of soil available nitrogen (AN), available phosphorus (AP) and available potassium (AK) in the before sowing, reviving stage, jointing stage, filling stage of winter wheat were analyzed by the method of geostatistics and GIS. At the same time, Pearson correlation analysis was used to study the response of wheat growth and development to soil nutrient variation. As the growth period goes by, 1) each nutrient showed low-high-low and moderate variability. AN and AK had the highest content at reviving stage, while AP at jointing stage, as turning point. The order of variability of each nutrient was AN>AP>AK. 2) The difference of nutrient variation first increased and then decreased, and showed medium to strong spatial correlation. Three nutrients in the before sowing stage were strong spatial correlation, and the reviving stage was medium spatial correlation, to the jointing and filling stages, AN was medium spatial correlation, AP and AK were strong spatial correlation. The spatial correlation of each nutrients was the weakest in the reviving stage, and AN was the strongest in the before sowing stage, while AP and AK were strongest in the jointing stage. The spatial correlation of each soil nutrients decreased from before sowing to reviving stage, jointing stage to filling stage, and the spatial correlation increased from reviving stage to jointing stage. 3) Soil nutrient content first increased and then decreased, and the grade of nutrient gradually decreased. 4) The correlation between soil nutrients and wheat growth was gradually increasing. AN had the highest correlation with wheat growth, followed by AK and AP lowest. The effect of soil nutrients on the growth of wheat at the reviving stage was higher than that of the current nutrient, and the growth of wheat at jointing stage was mainly influenced by the current nutrient, while the growth of wheat at the filling period was both influenced by the nutrient content of the last and the current period; the date to supplement fertilizer should be postponed properly. In this study, the soil nutrient dynamics and its influence on the growth of wheat during the winter wheat growth period under the traditional field model were well understood, which could provide a theoretical basis for the precision management of soil nutrients in the northern winter wheat area with relatively uniform planting environment and cultivation management.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Spatio-temporal variability of soil nutrients and the responses of growth during growth stages of winter wheat in the north of China","doi":"10.1101/398701","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1101/398701","venue":""}

This fear is produced by a series of subjective sensations experienced by the patient in the interval between the injection of the drug and the onset of the convulsion. Patients complain variously, stating that the sensation may simulate crushing of the chest, electrocution, bursting open of the head or impending death.1These profound fear reactions produce a marked and understandable resistiveness in the patient, which is commonly of such degree that treatment must be suspended prematurely. An attempt to alleviate this resistiveness arising from severe fear reactions in the following 2 cases prompted me to induce metrazol convulsions with the patient under anesthesia.

The total number of people with diabetes is projected to increase from 171 million in 2000 to 366 million in 2030 (Wild S et al., 2004). Diabetes mellitus is a complex and a multifarious group of disorders that disturbs the metabolism of carbohydrates, fat and protein. It results from shortage or lack of insulin secretion or reduced sensitivity of the tissue to insulin (Prasad Sk et al.,2009). Diabetes mellitus, one of the most common endocrine metabolic disorders has caused significant morbidity and mortality due to micro vascular (retinopathy, neuropathy and nephropathy) and macro vascular (heart attack, stroke and peripheral vascular disease) complications (Patel DK et al., 2011). . The treatment of diabetes mellitus is considered as the main global problem and successful treatment has yet to be discovered. Even though insulin therapy and oral hypoglycemic agents are the first line of treatment for the diabetes mellitus these have some side effects and fail to significantly alter the course of diabetic complications. Currently available oral therapies for treatment of diabetes mellitus are sulfonylureas, biguanides, glucosidase inhibitors and glinides, which can be used alone or combined with other drugs to achieve better effect. Many of these oral antidiabetic agents have a number of serious adverse effects, thus, the management of diabetes without any side effects is still a challenge.

The tested antitumor drugs were selected so as to produce different biochemical actions, and they were classified into three categories; five agents of group I (antimetabolites), eight agents of group II (alkylating agents), and five agents of group III (antibiotics). The results showed that all antimetabolites, all alkylating agents, and three of the antibiotics had positive responses, but the antibiotics aclarubicin (ACR) and chromomycin A3 (CHR) had negative responses. Both antibiotics that gave negative responses were anthracyclines, but daunomycin (DNR), which was one of the anthracyclines, had a positive result in the umu test. These results suggest that it is possible for the umu test to detect genotoxicity of chemicals regardless of the types of DNA damage (inhibition of DNA synthesis relative enzyme, DNA base alkylating, DNA strand-break, and DNA adduct), but difficult for it to detect genotoxicity of any anthracyclines.","inCitations":["58b3980e74042f8d0665da2b2956e3f31d91cd7d","fa5aff738d1d1920fe229afd6cc21da506f18261","222e3c875e72b864d26781d3d2a616823ed92033","f94fc18fea90e22e4e0b557fd287eefb4f8a76d9","00c1cebd1b0bbf3ce61714311ddee99550a42e08","c7ae50f5ba9ec65b009a79553b205f02e88245a7","e77c6113258e3aaf2bf94bccd6e9114ee00cb0d5"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Investigation into the ability of the Salmonella umu test to detect DNA damage using antitumor drugs.","doi":"10.1016/j.tiv.2005.10.007","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tiv.2005.10.007","venue":"Toxicology in vitro : an international journal published in association with BIBRA"}

In a nutshell, screaming newspaper headlines are no longer necessary to drive home the magnitude of the problem.

As ultrasound propagates in a liquid medium, due to attenuation, the resulting pressure gradient will cause the liquid to move in the propagation direction - the wellknown effect of acoustic streaming. The streaming velocity will, for a given acoustic output, be proportional to the viscosity of the fluid. In this study, we verify that acoustic streaming can be induced in an anthropomorphic sinus phantom cast from a human cranium. The sinus phantom was made from agar with added graphite providing sound attenuation prior to the sinus cavity corresponding to an in vivo situation. A number of water-glycerol solutions with scattering particles, were prepared to mimic a clinically interesting range of viscosities (7-47 mPas). Using a 4.2 MHz continuous wave Doppler probe, clearly detectable Doppler shifts in the range of 6.5 to 20 Hz were recorded. A linear relationship was found between the Doppler shifts and 1/viscosity (R2=0.94, corrected for the square-law dependence of sound speed variation due to varying glycerol concentration) (Less)","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"An ultrasonic method for detection of fluid properties in the paranasal sinuses","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

When transiently overexpressed, MKP-3 dephosphorylates and inactivates extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2. Little is known about the roles of endogenous MKP-3, however. We previously showed that MKP-3 is upregulated in cell lines that express oncogenic Ras. Here we tested the roles of endogenous MKP-3 in modulating ERK1/2 under conditions of chronic stimulation of the Ras/Raf/MEK1/2/ERK1/2 pathway by expression of oncogenic Ras. We used two cell lines: H-ras MCF10A, breast epithelial cells engineered to express H-Ras, and DLD-1, colon cancer cells that express endogenous Ki-Ras. First, we found that MKP-3 acts in a negative feedback loop to suppress basal ERK1/2 when oncogenic Ras stimulates the Ras/Raf/MEK1/2/ERK1/2 cascade. ERK1/2 was required to maintain elevated MKP-3, indicative of a negative feedback loop. Accordingly, knockdown of MKP-3, via siRNA, increased ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Second, by using siRNA, we found that MKP-3 helps establish the sensitivity of ERK1/2 to extracellular activators by limiting the duration of ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Third, we found that the regulation of ERK1/2 by MKP-3 is countered by the complex regulation of MKP-3 by ERK1/2. Potent ERK1/2 activators stimulated the loss of MKP-3 within 30 min due to an ERK1/2-dependent decrease in MKP-3 protein stability. MKP-3 levels recovered within 120 min due to ERK1/2-dependent resynthesis. Preventing MKP-3 resynthesis, via siRNA, prolonged ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Altogether, these results suggest that under the pressure of oncogenic Ras expression, MKP-3 reins in ERK1/2 by serving in ERK1/2-dependent negative feedback pathways.","inCitations":["03c5d098a5dcea39d194386b689a68746373db3a","5cdff27726243cea962ded8fae447dde9e9b898f","08691c0c74c0dcb82590ec6b885b752d6b73556f","3b87708a073b32a89bd93643c4c951b4fadcf71b","7d1ff465687d7f1c133325672ab50d89c5de2269","f0578b9312e894e0494030b47ad13a1580bd4373","2a978530ab4baa28af891d79f82e18a9d345f4f3","6773dfc3a3856a8a61fd105ae573a97c0c9aa6d7","c9780cd53afb1ad9be338be7fc15e8f247f085d6"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Reciprocal regulation of extracellular signal regulated kinase 1/2 and mitogen activated protein kinase phosphatase-3.","doi":"10.1016/j.taap.2008.08.007","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.taap.2008.08.007","venue":"Toxicology and applied pharmacology"}

In this preliminary work, core level x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) has been used for the first characterization of the surface composition of Dow Chemical's SiLK* semiconductor dielectric (*trademark of the Dow Chemical Company), its behavior during annealing in vacuo, and its interface formation with thermally evaporated copper in situ. The fully conjugated SiLK* resin shows a C is spectrum with intense shake-up structures, quite similar to those of polystyrene; a small amount of oxygen is detected. Upon annealing in ultrahigh vacuum (7.10(-9) Pa) no significant outgassing is observed; no noticeable change in intensity, width, position of the C 1 s and O 1 s core level peaks or satellite structures is measured. After annealing, the interface formation between SiLK* dielectric and copper has been characterized as a function of incremental coverages from 0.5 to 10 Angstrom of Cu. While the XPS C is spectrum shows only a normal intensity decrease, the Cu 2p(3/2) levels shift from a high binding energy to a purely metallic value: this is interpreted as the formation of small Cu clusters, evolving to a more continuous layer for higher Cu coverage. Annealing in vacuo of the as-prepared Cu(10 Angstrom)-SiLK* interface at 400 degrees C for 1 h does induce an increase of the carbon signal, attributed to further coalescence of copper in metallic clusters.

Specifically, attention is primarily given to the problem of formalization of production-type knowledge at the conceptual level (expert level) in the form of a solution graph that allows us to describe the fuzzy logic of the learning scenario planning, taking into account the individual characteristics of the learner. At a sufficiently deep level, the relationship between the infological model and the conceptual representation of knowledge in the form of a set of product rules for the analytic component of the learning environment is described. The technique of triggering rules (activation of associated events) in the process of logical inference is designed with taking into account the need to provide information to the user, testing the level of its assimilation and determining the outcome of the event. Two-level representation of events (compact and detailed) is proposed to provide a certain flexibility to the system. In terms of modification of the synthetic component of the learning environment to a more detailed form, the scheme for transforming the graph of solutions into an equivalent (according to the logic of \"reasoning\") feed-forward neural network (multi-layer perceptron) is brought. Neuron activation functions are defined which provide tact-by-tact management of the learning process and fixing its current state in the working memory of the intellectual learning environment.

In most Western societies, at least 90% of people consume alcohol at some time during their lives, and 30% or more of drinkers develop alcohol-related life problems.1 Severe alcohol-related life impairment, alcohol dependence, is observed at some time during their lives in ∼10% of men and 3–5% of women, with an additional 5–10% of each sex developing persistent but less intense problems that are diagnosed as abuse.1\n\nIndividuals with alcohol abuse are not dependent on alcohol, but have repeated legal, interpersonal, social, or occupational impairments related to alcohol consumption.1,,2 They frequently use alcohol in physically hazardous situations. If individuals with alcohol abuse continue to drink, they may go on to develop alcohol dependence. Alcohol dependence is characterized by tolerance (a need for markedly increased amounts of alcohol to achieve desired effect and/or markedly diminished effect with the continued use of the same amount of alcohol), and a withdrawal syndrome when alcohol is discontinued or intake is decreased. Alcohol-dependent individuals often spend a great deal of time using alcohol, and return to use despite evidence of physical and psychological problems. Alcohol abuse and dependence are commonly called alcoholism.\n\nDepression and alcoholism are associated with considerable morbidity, disability, and mortality, and co-occur more commonly than expected by chance.3–,8 The extent of comorbidity between depression and alcoholism was demonstrated by the results of several large epidemiological studies.3–,7 The National Comorbidity Survey (NCS), a nationally representative survey in the US, found that compared with non-depressed respondents in the NCS, the lifetime odds of alcohol dependence were significantly elevated for both men (2.95) and women (4.05) with major depression.7 Conversely, NCS data demonstrated a two-fold increase …","inCitations":["249ad4f23decbad36cf58058f3dfb6baa02f8eef","00124ca4d0ea4598a15cba913ebb97508dbed946","9910a26f533afc5c3c9ea42ebc9dae97f3d159bb","7a8363fb2c308f113b273a4aac88071da28df311","0f87cb3742c023e5089509c79bf30a45b9d37ea9","5dbfa7a3c0f081744cbdda07847a0d227a748ce9","ae412c807d1bc987a05d9a3f7fb1cfe01b9db8bd","f63ae983e2b365dc049b68c8530f0ffe8f6442a0","7e6f920adb019f362e08c391e05ae4c38ffc0a35","a2580fd0c3a3ef6bc219e70361fab6cbb0965b77","5b328166f3aa41d1afb9676f4a17f9b054028983","860a675cd3a736b8510d95f28fdf9bed452134a3","f2d1e851d7ba3c690ada3ffe7da2fe83a87360d2","84ac2e6e056f14886417482379fe1f493683fa0c"],"pdfUrls":["http://qjmed.oxfordjournals.org/content/qjmed/97/4/237.full.pdf"],"title":"Depression and alcoholism.","doi":"10.1093/qjmed/hch045","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1093/qjmed%2Fhch045","venue":"QJM : monthly journal of the Association of Physicians"}

We apply an extension of our Moray Drive control approach, which we introduced earlier. This extension we call as 2 DOF Moray Drive. The 2 DOF Moray Drive derogates the control problem of the hyper-redundant degrees-of-freedom (DOFs) to the simple one of 2 DOFs. Therein, one of the variables signifies the linear combination of the objective initial and final postures of the arm, while the another one expresses the amount of the pull-out-rate, when pulling the arm out of the housing slider. Further on, the optimized motion of the 2 DOF Moray Drive is generated by using the Fourier series expansion method and the culculation convergence method of steepest ascent. The characteristics of the proposed control technique are also demonstrated by computer simulations, including the motion with different gravity conditions, as well as the motion with fluid resistance from water.","inCitations":["53ee621e3310e5cd6d386d01d348bd3fc4e9d30f"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"2 DOF Moray Drive for Multijoint Manipulators","doi":"10.7210/jrsj.14.436","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.7210/jrsj.14.436","venue":""}

When both symptoms cause an important repercussion in patient’s daily life, the hearing aids may be a good tool to this rehabilitation. However, when adapted only to improve hearing, the results on tinnitus are less satisfactory because the occlusion of external auditory canal by the hearing aid mold may enhance tinnitus perception. The objective of this study is to evaluate the tinnitus response to behindthe-ear hearing aids with large vent ear molds. Methods: 31 patients with tinnitus complaint and hearing loss clinically bothersome received the orientation to undergo a test using bilateral behind-the-ear devices with large vent ear molds ( 2 mm), whenever possible, for about 3 weeks. When acoustic feedback appeared, the ventilation was decreased ( 2 mm). Tinnitus and hearing loss annoyance were evaluated by each patient through the visual analogue scale from 1 to 10. Results: Besides the initial orientation, 16 patients opted for unilateral use and 7 had their ventilation decreased to less than 2 mm due to acoustic feedback. In general, annoyance due to tinnitus decreased in 71% and due to hearing loss, in 87% of the cases. Molds with large vents were significantly better for tinnitus control. There was no significant difference between unilateral and bilateral adaptation. Conclusion: Behind-the-ear devices with large vent ear molds represent a good tool to control tinnitus and hearing loss when both symptoms are important in the patient’s life.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"P037: Tinnitus Control by Behind-the-Ear Hearing Aids: The Importance of Large Vent Molds","doi":"10.1016/S0194-59980300824-6","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/S0194-59980300824-6","venue":""}

The biphasic response suggests the presence of two glucosyl transferases only one of which is inhibited. The inhibition appears to be a property of the intact nucleotide phosphate sugars and not due to competition for a limited pool of dolichyl phosphate. UDP-galactose and UDP-xylose cause a less marked inhibition of the same enzyme. The failure of UDP-glucose to inhibit mannosyl transfer suggests that the pool of dolichol monophosphate used by mannosyl transferase is not available to the glucosyl transferase. The relationship between the degree to which an exogenous prenol phosphate acts as an acceptor of mannose and the degree to which it inhibits mannosylation of endogenous dolichyl monophosphate varies among different prenyl phosphates. Mannosyl transferase exhibits two pH optima.","inCitations":["39d6fc80a16ceb54edb4633580a7f738bccc2816"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Factors affecting glucosyl and mannosyl transfer to dolichyl monophosphate by liver cell-free preparations.","doi":"10.1111/j.1432-1033.1978.tb12126.x","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1432-1033.1978.tb12126.x","venue":"European journal of biochemistry"}
