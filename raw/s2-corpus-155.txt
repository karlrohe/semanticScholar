This study was carried out to investigate the plant growth and nutrient absorption characteristics of Ardisia pot plants according to the growth stage and nutrient solution strength. The Sonneveld solutions were diluted to 0, 1/4, 1/2, and 1 times to make treatment solutions. The plants were examined at the vegetative (rooted cutting that have not flowered) and reproductive (more than one year old plant that have flowered) growth stage. A. pusilla showed no remarkable changes in plant growth according to growth stage and nutrient strength. The excess nutrients of the higher strength treatments of 1/2 and 1 times accumulated in the nutrient solution; therefore, the nutrient concentration of 1/4 times was the most effective treatment to economize nutrient supply and improve plant growth. However, some nutrients should be adjusted in the nutrient solution. The compositions of nutrient solution must be adjusted to supplement the contents of total nitrogen as calcium in leaves decreased during the flowering and fruiting. In A. japonica, the nutrient strength must be supplied in different levels according to the growth stage. The nutrient solution strength of 1 times was recommended at the vegetative stage and 1/4 times at the reproductive stage. The leaf contents of calcium and magnesium decreased in the nutrient treatments compared to control; so nutrient solution composition must be regulated for this two nutrients. The excess nutrients accumulated in the higher strength treatments of 1/2 and 1 times until 18 weeks, but the nutrients of ammonium, phosphate, potassium, and magnesium were absorbed suddenly after 18 weeks in these treatments. Therefore, supplementation of these nutrients during this period must be considered. According to this study, the needed nutritional conditions of the two plants in the same genus were different. Therefore, the nutrients must be supplied in the proper time for each plant to harvest high quality products.","inCitations":["bef05977db8e93bd33eda3b46066158a927378b6","1bd1ef527cb530108788a519b6fd31cb253a4b09"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Growth Responses and Nutrient Absorption Characteristics of Ardisia Pot Plants in Two Growth Stages as Influenced by Nutrient Solution Strengths","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Two mechanisms of reactions were considered, the hydrogen transfer and the radical adduct formation, and it was found that hydrogen transfer is the only important route in this case, particularly at allylic sites. 7α products are predicted to represent more than 90% of the total initial damage, albeit 7β products are expected to be found in small but not negligible proportion. The chlorination degree was found to play an important role in the extent of the oxidative damage to cholesterol inflicted by the ROO• family. The estimated rate constants are 2.74 × 105, 1.32 × 105, 3.09 × 102, 6.07 × 101, and 8.75 × 10−1 M−1 s−1 for the reactions with •OOCHCl2, •OOCCl3, •OOCH2Cl, •OOH, and •OOCH3, respectively.

The results obtained confirm previous concepts (arrived at by geochemical flux models) of a sizable interchange of material between both sedimentary sulfur reservoirs and, accordingly, varying amounts of oxygen stored as sedimentary sulfate (this amount fluctuating between some 0.5 and 1.5×1022 g during the Phanerozoic). With the constancy of the sedimentary δ13Ccarb record indicating that the crustal Corg reservoir and its stoichiometric oxygen equivalent (i.e., total photosynthetic oxygen) did not change very much during the last quarter of the earth's history, fluctuations in sulfate oxygen must have been buffered by the two other O2 inventories, namely, oxygen fixed as Fe(III) oxide and free oxygen of the atmosphere. Although the main responsibility for balancing variations in sedimentary sulfate would go to the fixed oxygen because of its overwhelming size, repercussions on the free oxygen can by no means be excluded. If we accept a variation of free oxygen proportionate to that of the sum of the two reservoirs as a minimum requirement, then atmospheric PO2 can be expected to have fluctuated during the Phanerozoic within some ±20% of its present level.","inCitations":["f550b851c281113cd3db45df2340343ece45153b","22022c83d43294aeca5aa751ebe13bc1f44cfa7f","71a1b737b3b02b328ee78b1c703e2239ea110e6f","5fec77302a22e8ef322bcd8cfc0e4347f7128916","0992f3ac93eaecddd3a9bb0356e92dfbe3780a49","7dbcd487d0dae842f1f5232403e2dbf891ae6aa9","35ec5c3e862209c643d55c203005214637e97933","5b3fa34f4981b4911ae8d586bfc2f4269c99bd65"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Sulfur isotope variations in marine sulfate evaporites and the phanerozoic oxygen budget","doi":"10.1029/JC082i018p02557","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1029/JC082i018p02557","venue":""}

The system is built as a set of two parallel quasi-one-dimensional traps (the reservoir proper and a pulse-generating cavity), which are linearly coupled by the tunnelling of atoms. The scattering length is tuned to be negative and small in the absolute value in the cavity, and still smaller but positive in the reservoir. Additionally, a parabolic potential profile is created around the centre of the cavity. Both edges of the reservoir and one edge of the cavity are impenetrable. Solitons are released through the other cavity's edge, which is semi-transparent. Two different regimes of the intrinsic operation of the laser are identified: circulations of a narrow wavefunction pulse in the cavity, and oscillations of a broad standing pulse. The latter regime is stable, readily providing for the generation of an array containing up to 10 000 permanent-shape pulses. The circulation regime provides for no more than 40 cycles, and then it transforms into the oscillation mode. The dependence of the dynamical regime on parameters of the system is investigated in detail.","inCitations":["a24ce1d2915189e483d5b7f94e680e93a01b7cfe","c08e5252de59046389fadde6c9f88a2b2ab0e21f","4d0ae9f49acc0bc2e34611cfda1e2c4e1f2372c5"],"pdfUrls":["https://arxiv.org/pdf/cond-mat/0510447v1.pdf"],"title":"A model of a dual-core matter-wave soliton laser","doi":"10.1088/0953-4075/38/23/005","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1088/0953-4075%2F38%2F23%2F005","venue":""}

The results showed that PP and mPE were partially miscible and could form some cocrystallization, although the extent was very small. A modified Avrami analysis and the Mo method were used to analyze the nonisothermal crystallization kinetics of the blends. The values of the Avrami exponent indicated that the crystallization nucleation of the blends was homogeneous, the growth of the spherulites was three-dimensional, and the crystallization mechanism of PP was not affected by mPE. The crystallization activation energy was estimated with the Kissinger method. Interesting results were obtained with the modified Avrami analysis and Mo and Kissinger methods, and the conclusions were in good agreement. The addition of less mPE increased the overall crystallization rate of PP. The relationship between the composition and morphology of the blends was examined. © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The underpinning of the course is the generalization of the arithmetic they have previously studied and communication about mathematical ideas in a language that is rich in symbolic notation. Therefore it is not surprising for students to find algebra as abstract and unconnected to the real world. Over the past twenty years, there has been a movement in the United States to make algebra more concrete. Specialized manipulatives have been invented in order to provide “hands-on” materials for students to use. Algebra tiles, positive and negative counters, and balance apparatuses, to name a few, are commercially available materials for “concrete learning” of algebra. Although concrete materials may be helpful for students to learn algebra, it is not the materials themselves that provide algebraic meaning or understanding. Some educators assume that from the use of hands-on materials, students will automatically jump to abstract understanding of algebra. Research informs us that this is not the case. Physical knowledge is knowledge of objects observable in external reality, while mathematical knowledge is the mental relationships students construct in their heads. The source of mathematical knowledge is thus in the student [Kamii and DeClark 1985]. It is equally true that if students are taught abstract ideas without meaning, there will be no understanding. Students need experiences with a concept to develop meaning for themselves. If we want students to know what mathematics is as a subject, they must understand it. Knowing mathematics — really knowing it — means understanding it.

If the fusion rules are $\\mathbb{Z}/2$-graded, axial algebras afford representations of transposition groups. We consider axial representations of Weyl groups of simply-laced root systems, which are examples of regular $3$-transposition groups. We introduce coset axes, a special class of idempotents based on embeddings of transposition groups, and use them to study the propagation of fusion rules in axial algebras, for root system ${\\rm A}_n$. This is related to the construction of lattice vertex operator algebras and we show it reflects on the fusion of modules for the Virasoro algebra when we specialise our construction.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://arxiv.org/pdf/1403.3308v1.pdf"],"title":"Fusion rules from root systems I: case ${\\rm A}_n$","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Based on the LLVM/Clang compiler infrastructure, CodeCompass gives exact information on complex C/C++ language elements like overloading, inheritance, the usage of variables and types, possible uses of function pointers and the virtual functions - features that various existing tools support only partially. Steensgaard's and Andersen's pointer analysis algorithm are used to compute and visualize the use of pointers/references. The wide range of interactive visualizations extends further than the usual class and function call diagrams; architectural, component and interface diagrams are a few of the implemented graphs. To make comprehension more extensive, CodeCompass also utilizes build information to explore the system architecture as well as version control information. CodeCompass is regularly used by hundreds of designers and developers. Having a web-based, pluginable, extensible architecture, the CodeCompass framework can be an open platform to further code comprehension, static analysis and software metrics efforts. The source code and a tutorial is publicly available on GitHub, and a live demo is also available online.","inCitations":["296d35407073bf905dc62f894b8aa2cdd383e11a","4a516a3882fe37a07865b470faa3a8504c25bd7f"],"pdfUrls":["http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/117763577","http://gsd.web.elte.hu/papers/2018/codecompass-industry_icpc_2018.pdf"],"title":"CodeCompass: An Open Software Comprehension Framework for Industrial Usage","doi":"10.1145/3196321.3197546","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1145/3196321.3197546","venue":"2018 IEEE/ACM 26th International Conference on Program Comprehension (ICPC)"}

Educating preceptors has traditionally focused on didactic instruction emphasizing the cognitive domain. Although the information gleaned from the cognitive domain is valuable, learners fail to put the theory into practice (Hayes, 2016). This gap between theory and practice leads to an unsatisfactory onboarding experience and a higher turnover rate for new employees. This begs the question of how to create buy-in and improve implementation of the new concepts among preceptors. The answer is to teach using the affective domain. Creating an emotional response and personal experience enables learners to formulate a frame of reference that reshapes their understanding, guides their future actions, and enhances their self-confidence (Mezirow, 2009). This column, the first of a two-part series, presents teaching strategies emphasizing the affective domain that were successfully integrated into a preceptor development class.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Teaching Preceptors Using the Affective Domain (Part 1)","doi":"10.1097/NND.0000000000000489","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1097/NND.0000000000000489","venue":"Journal for nurses in professional development"}

The total population and the velocity distribution of atoms sputtered in both states were determined from the saturation behavior of the photoionization process and the flight time distribution of the ejected neutral species between the ion-bombarded surface and the ionization volume. We find total excitation fractions of several percent, which are only weakly dependent on the sputtering conditions such as the nature or energy of the primary ions. Furthermore, we show that metastable atoms are ejected with lower average velocity than those emitted in the electronic ground state, thus indicating an excitation mechanism populating this state which becomes less efficient with increasing emission velocity. From the polar emission angle dependence of the measured energy spectra, it is inferred that the excitation probability is not simply related to the normal component of the emission velocity. @S0163-1829~97!10031-5#","inCitations":["1a56b9b79de0ce3685da8626c5416f2d3244fa1e","b280ec2dcedb576e2d193c9051cd179f0ec31608","e48c018579d97762bc07c1f07a9b846db3d8ace4"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.ilp.physik.uni-essen.de/wucher/PUBLIC/Reference%20Manager/PdfFiles/Berthold%20PHYS%20REV%20B%2056%201997%204251.pdf"],"title":"Energy- and angle-dependent excitation probability of sputtered metastable silver atoms","doi":"10.1103/PhysRevB.56.4251","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.56.4251","venue":""}

Spontaneous circulation returned after 5 min of cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and the patient was intubated and taken to the emergency department. On arrival, he was unresponsive and hypotensive with sinus tachycardia, decreased breath sounds on the right, scattered rhonchi on the left, and equal but thready pulses throughout. Electrocardiogram (ECG) and cardiac markers were normal, but he had a raised white cell count with neutrophilia and a lactic acidosis of 8·3 mmoL/L. Chest radiograph showed near total right hemithorax opacifi cation. He was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit for presumed septic shock and started on metronidazole and cefepime, but because of haemodynamic instability he was not put on post-arrest hypothermic protocol. Chest CT showed widespread consolidation of the right lung with a 12 × 12 × 22 cm fl uid-air collection in the posterior hemithorax (fi gure). Fluid from an ultrasound-guided thoracentesis grew Gram-negative rods. He developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) needing escalation of ventilatory support, with worsening hypoxia and acidosis (arterial blood gas pH 7·18, PaCO2 68, PaO2 41, HCO3 25) despite maximum medical therapy, and he died. The pleural fl uid later grew Pasteurella multocida. On discussion with his family we learnt he cared for several feral cats, which slept in his bed. An empyema typically develops adjacent to bacterial pneumonia and is the most complicated type of parapneumonic eff usion. In a study of US hospital admissions the admission rate for empyema-related diagnoses almost doubled between 1996 and 2008. The progression of an isolated empyema depends on underlying risk factors, with a morbidity and mortality rate between 10 and 50%. ARDS is often the fi nal result of both pulmonary and non-pulmonary illnesses. The most common pathogen isolated in empyema is Streptococcus pneumoniae (20–50%). Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas, Klebsiella, and anaerobic bacteria make up most of the remainder. P multocida is a Gram-negative coccobacillus and zoonotic microbe found in the oral fl ora of cats (70%), dogs, and other mammals. It is often associated with soft tissue infections after cat bites; however, people can be colonised, with the potential for human-to-human spread. The lungs are an unusual site for P multocida colonisation, although transmission is related to inhalation of contaminated aerosols or inoculation with animal secretions. Underlying chronic pulmonary diseases can predispose patients to infection. The progression of P multocida pleuropulmonary infections is often non-specifi c, presenting with gradualonset subjective fever, sinusitis, bronchitis, or pneumonia. In patients with empyema and ARDS a history enquiring about previous animal contact can help guide appropriate treatment.","inCitations":["215f8d517d725a3fecec8b5d5bd7beabdfdfddbe","2639008b7bba924cef27a1724c6e9b1738a6cfc5","d3369a8375738ce9b54c264c707546786a75e0ca"],"pdfUrls":["https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0140673614609223","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673614609223?dgcid=api_sd_search-api-endpoint"],"title":"A fatal pasteurella empyema","doi":"10.1016/S0140-6736(14)60922-3","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736%2814%2960922-3","venue":"The Lancet"}

Another thesis can be loosely formulated as the thesis that moral obligation may affect moral responsibility, that is, either moral praiseworthiness or blameworthiness. It’s the thesis that what’s obligatory or impermissible for you has, or may have, a direct bearing on whether you are morally praiseworthy or blameworthy for what you do. If both the first and second theses are true, then factors not in our control that may influence obligation may also affect responsibility. In this paper, I explain and motivate a third thesis. It’s the thesis, roughly, that responsibility may affect obligation. This is so because obligation is associated with desert, and in a subset of cases, desert is associated in the relevant way with responsibility.

Of potentially important supplements, glucose, glutamine, Pluronic acid F-68 as well as several amino acids had significant beneficial effects. A determination of amino acids profiles via HPLC analysis allowed the formulation of a balanced medium. Unbalanced supplementations of amino acids were found undesirable because of the toxicity of some amino acids at high concentration. Compared with the basal medium, the maximum viable cell and final IgA concentrations in the final version of the protein-free medium were increased by 130% and 700%, respectively, whereas the IgA molecular weight pattern and in vitro activity were not affected. The IgA production was even higher than in a serum-containing medium (RPMI 1640 + 10% FCS) and the price of the protein-free medium is about 20% of this serum-containing medium.

Despite many improvements in the medical and surgical management of these disorders, development of effective treatments has proven to be challenging. This is because of the limited suitability of existing experimental models for acquiring a thorough understanding of the mechanisms underlying skeletal and cardiac muscle diseases and the lack of efficiency and specificity of many of the currently available therapeutic interventions. Therefore, the aim of this thesis was to establish and use dedicated cellular models in combination with genetic interventions to study the biology of skeletal and cardiac muscles in healthy and diseased states and thereby identify potential targets for future therapeutic interventions. The experiments described in this thesis indeed emphasized the importance of cellular models for (i) elucidating the mechanisms underlying skeletal and cardiac muscle diseases and (ii) identification of novel therapeutic targets. This thesis also underlined the usefulness of viral vector-mediated gene transfer technology for development of biological assays and the evaluation of therapeutic targets. In conclusion, application of in vitro models in combination with genetic interventions can improve our understanding of skeletal and cardiac muscle diseases and aid development of new therapies for these disorders.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://openaccess.leidenuniv.nl/bitstream/handle/1887/30224/thesis_Zeinab_Neshati.pdf?sequence=15","https://openaccess.leidenuniv.nl/bitstream/handle/1887/30224/booklet_cover_Zeinab_Neshati.pdf?sequence=14","https://openaccess.leidenuniv.nl/bitstream/handle/1887/30224/front.pdf?sequence=13"],"title":"Cellular models and viral vectors for skeletal and cardiac muscle research","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

This study was carried out to determine the oral health status and treatment needs of children and young adults attending a day institution for those with special needs.MethodsThis study was carried out as part of an oral health screening program organized by the institution and consent was obtained from parents and guardians before the screening. All information was supplied by the parents during the screening using a questionnaire completed by the dentist. Oral examination was carried out on all consenting subjects in attendance on the days of screening in the school clinic with parents and teachers in attendance, using standard World Health Organisation oral health indices to assess dental caries, oral hygiene status, malocclusion and other oral health parameters.ResultsFifty-four subjects aged 3–26 years (mean 12.28 ± 6.82 years) and comprising 72.2% males and 27.8% females participated in the study. Over 90% were from parents of high and middle level educational background. Thirty-six (66.7%) were caries free, with a mean dmft score of 0.7 ± 1.77 and mean DMFT score of 0.4 ± 1.44 with no significant difference across gender (p = 0.5) and parents' educational status (p = 0.43). The mean OHI-S of the total population in this study was 1.36 ± 0.16. Females had a mean score of 0.88 ± 1.10 while males had a mean score of 1.55 ± 1.24 with no significant difference (p = 0.6). Twenty-five (46.3%) had good oral hygiene, 17 (31.5%) had fair oral hygiene and 12 (22.2%) had poor oral hygiene, with no significant difference across gender (p = 1.11) and age groups (p = 0.07). Fifteen (27.8%) had gingivitis with no significant difference across age groups (p = 0.17). Forty-five (83.3%) had Angle's class I malocclusion, 6(11.1%) class II and 3 (5.6%) class III. Chronologic enamel hypoplasia was found in 9 (16.7%) of the total population. Up to 53.7% of the total population will require oral prophylaxis, 33.3% required restorations on their posterior teeth and 12.9% required veneers for labial facing of hypoplastic enamel.ConclusionThe subjects in this study had a high prevalence of dental caries and need for restorative care. They would benefit from parental education on diet modification, improvement of oral hygiene practices and regular dental visits.","inCitations":["555a96a38f1c0e744bf6bbb096aade42c86d98df","9d0abf90f0b6d8c40e52c2f29f9f12f369863fec","3a3804d82b21733834b363bfd0eb90aa38e2b956","5314dad3cf0eef7d61f40500be0570ecb1e6c480","f3adb523630cbb6e68c03faa46a8a553e84114e3","a6dab72b67465935d6a3a41fdfed6803d18122f3","5b242d11aa6bc5b8e9190c126b0fafb60e8c4a83","8d1d4e32880bf1e42a9a043c4daeaa0374db77e9","28d148d5787bc9d7e6c03086f9b2824a41daf09a","4da5935421835d59d1f5156c99c6b4a71e6d6c96","2227154264208a04986feb9c294150d61d7beb96","c80272cfdaaa63fc3fbe3e2fcebbaac5e8bc0a97","2c0b9ccbd710b64029f5b5a0d5d2e859bec4b056","9c8407e462348c622c470f236373dafab21d8cc4","9e4ae19808d5e54b2d7e9ae12c055b0f6d4b74bb","fe578bf0a0bc3144724477951d3009c7b14f81ff","8da6ef4accd6fb568036ebbb5ca65ad619e780c9","1d7f9e4e9c37fca9eb720520674af76deda7dc43","2d542561b5747986d4241807bca793b88d44e0ac","d46d07eb2ea323712cbbe6f5561de74b3fd1ffed","4299255fc04c96870c33bb6bad0dbfb0f5fd13dd","ffb07bfba0989d23f2130155816adc7f3c81e57a","c81bc7b3d1aaa1cbf4bacf6c5f1787cd5d72dfa1","87ca80fdc0eda5489842e333bcf4c4c2dd03d2b7","01bb077509f558767bd550fb670cd86e1139508c","61eb5c29ea0f6298970d9b7e3140d2872fe26770","4a515da83cdb7852c1dd8e5ae20f089af660eb58","6773f9080cb733ad03e93cffeab322704acae2f2","98235022a8d3170e03505d654d3b6798c11eee4d","3b47d971efb976f49f2851b5fec4512839e05659","727afff044e83d147987974a49aafe2361a58b6f","815a105572e35f1f0cc7a7f99abc564da62980e5","792de549e91d46d561f9635b47212af8aef0ff29","eb406a610a724e6b557ab330f08f2fc33a496fa8","cee495ec9d844b0f3a7cfb0d602c418e8228b104","bd20d51d993fa263ca2ed5368158f0e343627daf","a0a446e3440480020d2b74ce3e47d0dcd7a4344a","a45c62f2e1ca4a1bdd2d0bf79dc4849afec167e2","331438d7b9bac609a1fa0972153266b9809fe844","efc89e73e0eec5c947ce3bcd55447c3367f07cb1","f1d5b9d8c53221bdd23a6926b11b286a0fdd0d24","e116404a062f3f85640f850de2e0bf0379991b73","796014c4493d56106447d7c354ec0d5330efd377","4d911eef1a60b8ff39c9ca52bad12d58bd52b5c7","150b444e02a818ab35797a7dac4233d1f68e0e5f","cc4ca7b3034c5dcbd6757044249492600884f3a4","7ea8bcf0ac70b8d1d46c879fb0783b7479789a02","f8dda184225c8d698e34190aa41aa6abcfeb70d0","b23684b439209a1d8f8c5125c29baa93e1007d3e","0640d9477772f669ceb3e5440eeab37157aa6a2b","6a79c9c6a711918bc91a2484af049974a6d4ca0d","07ea1d504faf0003c924517c5e660c706f00e440","d18c851580991b7a583a660b6cc16b25c560b2be","6ed6ba1138d97743be59f83e405d0a1ddbd94e07","b9cab52f70d6d3bb498ff1d9e0781cf6dfbcf122","7fcc1f2c088b2bbc2c11aa8487581d7dc9ec8386","afc95b8440860afb10b6f433a2db060f4adcb082","ca67273f84afde82612c4aa12d2b9ab4ebd7b269","28f6d6e11d07ac709b00e12380e1911a4da087ad","f22c3cec33552462600ec60990331b30841520a2","78b9058052f7a11d03e73b5fb9cf8a40a8baa049","22db9d09e6307045740cda735bcd3185f684cebc","4000e4642c493f13d1c6d31cf3cdf7dd7489cc47","02fa3285c0d3f7d92bdf6a5bcb5060cac66454b7","71d5e4d00d0da90aa57fe9dbc8c59ff6549783b6","4b85fbbe8148565110c86815256ea10a45d48785","d08426ffefac9440f94db6324ad6e92c4f2358c1","9cfca440c70459e5d6e1864becfe3420468c6c7f","b836267702572b301e3a10605fe7a2c2f762e3fe","b8d6dfc16836450e017024c5cca5a40a2dfbc49d","2a0357f8bcd367881a5b409c8fad4d110438906f","73b96ec4790998aad51881b9b7f7f0125895f679","27bc135d796304aee02aad50469c8e51c6fcf15d","5670fb73541332784b935498f3416cbd95c5347a","45ac9051f5cce7852bb0b6b04269ade5e2872178","f9d5c85e59060c762f8c59625ba1d32399412f78","eea6cc734cfb6f53ef46f0b85e219a6a98d6d8fe","cd4ad632127a39d7aa2b4b7fffd379713404eafb","e4b1886dc87e09836f888ae6b6e97830121c811f","3d14d04750e2854baa24bc0bef3b31eac7a45c1d","052db93f884057691030b4f2fc058a26af231823","b35db98e946f123f9799182af75de50668c396fc"],"pdfUrls":["https://www.biomedcentral.com/imedia/2076580684199332_manuscript.pdf","http://download-redirector.springer.com/redirect?contentType=pdf&ddsId=art:10.1186/1472-6831-8-30&originUrl=http://bmcoralhealth.biomedcentral.com/article/10.1186/1472-6831-8-30","http://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/pmc/fd/6c/1472-6831-8-30.PMC2579283.pdf"],"title":"Oral health status and treatment needs of children and young adults attending a day centre for individuals with special health care needs","doi":"10.1186/1472-6831-8-30","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1472-6831-8-30","venue":"BMC oral health"}

But why are there currently so many overseas doctors and nurses in Britain, for example, and why does such a large proportion of NHS staff come from the developing world? \n \nThere are several good reasons: the niche is becoming increasingly larger as health care has become the largest industry; the British government is spending so much money on the NHS; because of the European Working Time Directive there is a need for more doctors; British health professionals are becoming increasingly demoralised and humiliated by politicians and managers; and young Britons do not aspire to become doctors or nurses any more. There is another reason: the peoples of the former British colonies outnumber those of the French, Spanish, Portuguese, Dutch, and Danish put together, they speak English, and they went to medical and nursing schools that followed in principle the tradition of British medical education and training. \n \n \nIt could be said that for a northerner not to have worked in the south is a crime \n \n \nTheir home countries are unable to retain doctors and nurses not only because they do not pay them well but also because they do not treat them well and they cannot provide them with working environments in which they could function. Public medical care has disintegrated in many parts of the world and is, in Africa, worse than elsewhere. \n \nWith the destruction of public health care a new niche opened for doctors and, to a lesser extent, nurses in developing world countries: commercial practice, mostly urban. In as much as Britain competes for medical manpower with African countries, it competes with the burgeoning private sector, for the ministries of health are unable to employ the medical manpower available, let alone required. \n \nThe migrant workers that rich countries employ—whether taxi drivers, toilet cleaners, computer operators, or consultant anaesthetists—support the economies of the home countries by sending an admirable proportion of their income home to their families. For some poor countries these remittances are the most important foreign exchange earner. \n \nThe migrants, the returnees, and the commuters also exert professional influence in their home countries. Considering the societal and professional decay in much of the developing world, these reimported role models are essential. Furthermore, the migrants have been, and are, the major force behind democratisation across the continents. Were it not for those thousands of Kenyans—among them prominent opinion makers, such as doctors—who have been or still are abroad, and were it not for electronic communications, Kenya might still be a one-party state and Daniel Arap Moi its president. \n \nThose who say that the brain drain is a crime do not seem to think of such benefits. Also, no one has so far said that employing migrant computer operators, pilots, preachers, or even teachers is a crime. \n \nThose who desire to cure or to minimise the brain drain list a number of remedies. One recommendation is to refuse to recognise degrees and qualifications obtained in poor countries. Considering that it took over 50 years to arrange recognition, such a move would be retrogressive, smack of neo-colonialism, and would be politically impossible. \n \nSome would like poorer countries to curtail education and training so that “products” are not exportable to rich countries. The trouble with this line of thinking is that, specifically in the health sector, the knowledge and skills required in poor countries are much broader than those needed in rich ones. Health care in the rich world is so specialised, structured, and monitored that “half trained” migrants would fit in nicely, whereas they would be useless in a district hospital at home. (Already teaching hospitals in the developing world imitate their northern counterparts and do not train for practice in the bush—another factor contributing to the brain drain.) \n \nIf the north wants to help the south it has to do it in a big way. Short of a Marshall plan, nothing will really work, not in most countries of sub-Saharan Africa. So what does the north need to do to halt the brain drain? Rebuild the public hospitals and health centres and provide and guarantee maintenance and supplies. Establish a telecommunication system, including radios and aeroplanes, and arrange for realistic salaries and housing. If this were to happen a large proportion of migrants would flock home—after all, it is not such fun to be a casualty officer in Liverpool or an intensive therapy nurse in Birmingham, Alabama. \n \nMeanwhile, let British, American, Scandinavian, and Japanese medical students, postgraduates, and consultants travel to the poor countries in a properly organised, well thought out manner and work there. They will invigorate the healthcare sector at both ends, and will gain insight and self confidence, and everyone would benefit. After a while it could be said that for a northerner not to have worked in the south is a crime.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"How to halt the brain drain","doi":"10.1136/bmj.332.7546.921","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.332.7546.921","venue":""}

The relative importance of these two factors is discussed in the light of historical examples. It is apparently rare that a discovery results more or less automatically from a given state of science and research (as in the case of insulin). Nearly always the personality of the research worker turns out to be the determinant factor. Essential traits of this personality are an independent mind capable of liberating itself from dogmatic tenets universally accepted by the scientific community; the capacity and courage to look at things from a new angle; powers of combination, intuition and imagination; feu sacré and perseverance--in short, intellectual as well as moral qualities. The personality of a great scientific discoverer, furthermore, integrates the spirit of his epoch into his individuality. About half the research workers considered here were aged below 35 at the time of their discoveries. The author therefore hopes that our universities will, in the future, provide opportunities for young research workers as well as for somewhat older individualists.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"[Does the mind drift where it wants?

The model consisted of H9 lymphocytes, as surrogates of maternal HIV-infected T cells, incubated for 3 h with JEG-3 trophoblasts in the presence of 10-fold dilutions of leukocyte-derived IFN-alpha (from 1000 to 0.1 IU/ml). The dose effect was monitored either directly, by measuring the levels of proviral DNA by PCR after a single round of infection, or indirectly, by coculturing infected JEG-3 with cord blood-derived MT-4 lymphocytes and determining the levels of p24 production by ELISA. Both assays revealed a dose-dependent blocking effect of IFN-alpha on cell-mediated HIV transmission. The complete inhibition of HIV infection was observed in the presence of 100 IU IFN-alpha. The efficacy of such a low dose could not be attributed to insufficient viral load because up to 10(8) infectious particles could be transmitted during cell-cell contact. An adhesion assay ruled out the possibility that IFN-alpha acts through prevention of lymphocyte-trophoblast contact. The results suggest that physiologic levels of IFN-alpha, present in the placental environment, may contribute to the protection of the fetus against HIV infection.","inCitations":["781eea494d3e21fa50e034400191a1563bbfbdcf","c5f6222ef1789e8e9e4bd4a41c426e17da97fd17","f6e7af9029bb9db3a71778bf3123c575bc59dc64"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Protective effect of interferon-alpha against cell-mediated human immunodeficiency virus transmission resulting from coculture of infected lymphocytes with fetal trophoblasts.","doi":"10.1089/jir.1995.15.503","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1089/jir.1995.15.503","venue":"Journal of interferon & cytokine research : the official journal of the International Society for Interferon and Cytokine Research"}

It is demonstrated that there exists a limited “window” in the space of system parameters where self-consistent solutions can exist. When the density of the quasi-trapped plasma is sufficiently large, a redistribution of the total current can be a cause of the sheet decay, when the local current of the trapped particles compensate (totally or in part) the main current in the center and at the edges of the sheet, while the total current generated by ions on the trapped trajectories vanishes.","inCitations":["787d4eb537b5c8fc324e1bc4e0d4da514d4178d4","40e6885b280147c1a23f49d64ef5d493534a2fb3"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Influence of Trapped Plasma on the Structure of Collisionless Thin Current Sheets","doi":"10.1023/A:1019846428446","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1023/A%3A1019846428446","venue":""}

Pre-steady-state kinetic steps were identified with chemical steps proposed for the mechanism of this enzyme (Palmer, J.L., and Abeles, R.H. (1979) J. Biol. Chem. 254, 1217-1226). The steady-state kinetic constants for the hydrolysis or synthesis of S-adenosylhomocysteine were in good agreement with those values calculated from the pre-steady-state rate constants. The equilibrium constant for dehydration of 3'-ketoadenosine to 3'-keto-4',5'-dehydroadenosine on the enzyme was 3. The analogous equilibrium constant for addition of L-homocysteine to S-3'-keto-4',5'-dehydroadenosylhomocysteine on the enzyme was 0.3. The elimination of H2O from adenosine in solution had an equilibrium constant of 1.4 (aH2O = 1). Thus, the equilibrium constants for these elimination reactions on the enzyme were probably not perturbed significantly from those in solution. The equilibrium constant for the reduction of enzyme-bound NAD+ by adenosine was 8, and the analogous constant for the reduction of the enzyme by S-adenosylhomocysteine was 4. The equilibrium constant for the reduction of NAD+ by a secondary alcohol in solution was 5 x 10(-5) at pH 7.0. Consequently, the reduction of enzyme-bound NAD+ by adenosine was 10(5)-fold more favorable than the reduction of free NAD+. The magnitude of the first-order rate constants for the interconversion of enzyme-bound intermediates varied over a relatively small range (3-80 s-1). Similarly, the magnitude of the equilibrium constants among enzyme-bound intermediates varied over a narrow range (0.3-10). These results were consistent with the overall reversibility of the reaction.","inCitations":["38140df48e7e17fd088e1fb52b8e59902e9e47ee","3e2072ac3578ee2557d65a06a5c6ca5e16760afb","f21ab99219b7b97687c2ff85c92dabe49672fdd0"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Mechanism of bovine liver S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase.

Diffusion MRI using pulsed gradient spin-echo (PGSE) diffusion encoding measures a marked decrease in the mean apparent diffusion coefficient (MD) of water after acute ischemic stroke. Insight into the microscopic environment can be gained by varying the \"diffusion time\", Δeff. The oscillating gradient spin-echo (OGSE) method enables greatly reduced Δeff compared to PGSE (Fig 1), which grants sensitivity to diffusion restriction/hindrance over smaller length scales [1]. In a rat model of global ischemia, larger differences between OGSE and PGSE were observed in ischemic grey matter relative to healthy tissue [1]. Also, recent ex-vivo and simulation work has suggested that cellular beading may cause the MD reductions in stroke [2]. While OGSE has been applied to healthy human brain [3-4], it has not yet been applied to human stroke. This work aims to determine the dependencies of MD and eigenvalues on Δeff in human stroke, and test whether any changes are consistent with cellular beading using simulations. Methods. In vivo. DWI was acquired in 5 acute stroke patients (age 40-65; onset 24-72 hr; NIHSSS 1-6) on a Varian Inova 4.7T using OGSE 50 Hz (Δeff = 4 ms) and PGSE (Δeff = 40 ms). Two patients each had 2 distinct lesions while the others had 1 lesion each; lesions were partially within white matter in 4 patients. The lesions were outlined on the PGSE DWI and then applied to the OGSE DWI to measure MD in all the lesions (N=7), as well as parallel (λ||) and perpendicular (λ┴) eigenvalues in white matter lesions (N=4). Statistical significance was evaluated using paired t-tests for OGSE relative to PGSE. In a water phantom, consistent MD was measured for OGSE (MD 2.17±0.02 x 10 mm/s) and PGSE (MD 2.18±0.03 x 10 mm/s) (N=4). Both protocols used 2D single-shot EPI with: TR = 12.5 s; TE = 110 ms; FOV = 24 cm; 2x2x2.5 mm; 20 slices; 6 averages; R=2 GRAPPA; b = 300 s/mm; 6 gradient directions. Simulation. Random walk Monte Carlo simulations were performed with Camino [5]. Cylinders with an initial diameter of 4 μm and an intracellular volume fraction (IVF) of 0.7 were modeled as undergoing ischemia-induced beading of amplitude 0.6 [3] and an increase in IVF to 0.78. Simulated OGSE and PGSE diffusion encoding was the same as used in vivo, with a “free” diffusivity of 1.7x10 mm/s (= λ|| measured in healthy white matter using OGSE). Results. MD was reduced in the lesions compared to contralateral tissue for PGSE (-44 ± 10%), which is typical, but notably, MD did not reduce nearly as much for OGSE (-14 ± 23%) (Fig 2, 3). In the white matter, λ|| had a similar trend as MD, with decreases in the lesion of (-44 ± 15%) for PGSE and (-23 ± 21%) for OGSE. Interestingly, while λ┴ decreased by (-26 ± 20%) in the lesion for PGSE, it increased by (23 ± 35%) for OGSE. The Monte Carlo simulations exhibited strikingly similar trends for changes of these three diffusion parameters with diffusion time (PGSE 40 ms vs OGSE 4 ms) in healthy tissue and ischemia-induced beading (Fig 3).","inCitations":["0970fcd61bcd004f415257867c9986a4f5b9a5b4","53cd3774e395d0b2d772d2e80570db565dd8082f"],"pdfUrls":["http://cds.ismrm.org/protected/14MProceedings/files/0106.pdf"],"title":"Oscillating Gradient Spin-Echo ( OGSE ) DTI Yields Mechanistic Insights in Human Stroke","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Although the authors present a justification for the use of radiotherapy in this subgroup of patients, their article also illustrates many of the reasons why the management of patients with bulky retroperitoneal metastases continues to remain controversial. Intercomparison of results among different series dealing with bulky abdominal disease is hampered by the lack of a universally accepted criterion defining Stage IIB. The most commonly used criteria are (a) palpability, (b) largest dimension > 5 cm, (c) largest dimension > 10 cm. Although the Royal Marsden Hospital criterion6 of a mass > 5 cm is widely used, we have found that the 10 cm dimension is a more appropriate criterion.15 In our Stage II experience the incidence of relapse after radiation or chemotherapy was 0% (O/S) for patients with disease 2 cm but ~5 cm, 0% (O/l 3) for disease > 5 cm but 10 cm in largest dimension. The 10 cm criterion was also significant in the Norwegian Radium Hospital series.2 Laukkanen et al. use palpability as their criterion for bulky disease. This, while most readily available in retrospective reviews, is the least objective and precise criterion. Since the hazard for relapse is an increasing function of disease volume, objective and consistent criteria are essential, especially when dealing with small numbers of patients. Small numbers of patients pose problems for all investigators of this disease. Stage IIB seminoma is indeed very rare and many large centers report patient accruals both in radiotherapy series6,“,13,‘5 and in chemotherapy reports4’9’ IO. 12 that average to only 1 or 2 patients per year. Despite some 35 years of patient accrual (1948-1983), Laukkanen et al. could present only 23 patients with Stage IIB disease. The long time span encompassed by this study led to the inclusion of patients managed without the benefits of sensitive tumor imaging techniques, without tumor markers (especially alpha fetoprotein) and even in some cases without megavoltage irradiation. The inclusion of such patients, especially those receiving orthovoltage irradiation, in current reports adds nothing to the elucidation of the role of radiotherapy in this disease in 1987. No matter how good sporadic results might have been, few investigators today would be persuaded that the problem of management of Stage IIB disease is really so simple as to be amenable to orthovoltage treatment. Laukkanen et al. attempt to show that results did indeed improve as technologic advances were incorporated into the management of Stage IIB: 3 of 4 patients relapsed after treatment during the orthovoltage years, 4 of 14 patients relapsed after megavoltage irradiation without CT scanning, and 0 of 6 patients relapsed after CT scan-assisted megavoltage irradiation. However, due to the small number of patients, these trends were not statistically significant and the authors are left in the unsatisfactory position of having to justify the value of modern irradiation more on general principles than on demonstrably superior results. There is no doubt that the results reported by Laukkanen et al. (91% survival at 5 years) are excellent. The difficulty is in understanding exactly why their results are so good in order that we all could reproduce them. Numerous radiotherapy series have documented long-term survival rates between 54% and 73% in Stage IIB pa-","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Seminoma with bulky abdominal disease.","doi":"10.1016/0360-3016(88)90450-6","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/0360-3016%2888%2990450-6","venue":"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics"}

The resistance-nodulation-cell division (RND)-type efflux system plays a major role in tigecycline non-susceptible Acinetobacter baumannii, but the mechanism in A. nosocomialis remains unknown. Our aim was to analyse the contribution of efflux-based tigecycline resistance in clinical A. nosocomialis isolates collected from multiple medical centres in Taiwan.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA total of 57 A. nosocomialis isolates, including 46 TNAN and 11 tigecycline-susceptible A. nosocomialis (TSAN) isolates, were analysed. Of these, 46 TNAN isolates were clustered to ST410 (43 isolates) and ST68 (three isolates) by multi-locus sequence typing.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe relationship between the RND efflux pump and tigecycline resistance was indirectly verified by successfully reducing tigecycline resistance with NMP, an efflux pump inhibitor. The three RND efflux systems (AdeABC, AdeIJK and AdeFGH) were detected in all clinical isolates. The transcript level of adeB gene increased significantly and was correlated with tigecycline resistance. Moreover, the AdeRS two-component system was further classified into four different types of AdeRS patterns considering the amino acid sequence. Further analysis showed that tigecycline resistance was related to the transcript level of adeB gene and the AdeRS pattern.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThis study showed that the dissemination of TNAN isolates in Taiwan is attributable mainly to the spread of ST410. The AdeABC efflux pump appeared to play an important role in the tigecycline resistance of A. nosocomialis.","inCitations":["dccd7f5edb32dc9cd010224843635b65f5bff9a0","f15e961695980fdfad26628198a38aebb8867600","4faccdccda73ad6a30cf610b5d98c9d2e6b31650","508694d2e9b84ded1a123fd333e0b8dd77c30cdb"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Overexpression of AdeABC efflux pump associated with tigecycline resistance in clinical Acinetobacter nosocomialis isolates.","doi":"10.1016/j.cmi.2018.06.012","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmi.2018.06.012","venue":"Clinical microbiology and infection : the official publication of the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases"}

Four hypotheses are suggested to explain this pattern. First, nationalization of sectors such as oil, mining and utilities, where foreign ownership, per se , is incompatible with economic control or national security, was virtually complete by 1975. Second, as time since independence passed, LDCs gained confidence in their own identities and their perceptions of foreign direct investment became less symbolic and more functional and pragmatic. Third, and most importantly, as bargaining power, technical and administrative capabilities, and knowledge of multinational firms increased, states became more confident of their ability to achieve control indirectly through regulation and, in industries where ownership was not of the essence, saw direct control through expropriation as less effecient and effective. Last, the economic problems faced by many of the LDCs in the late 1970s increased the attractiveness of foreign investment and/or constrained expropriation.","inCitations":["cb425163d3e8e4ff46357488964559b17c3f88c6","4e37888e519efa3fd5b62ae063772918b85ac30d","0784ce0e17170dd2fe12bf99798af8cc904329dd","31249957beaf80a0976c09c7177d4b1a8df415c6","a6049df83e064fe8f09c6e5254946a3883419d88","85827192f30a1b916df3db0307e053f81728e7e2","205ae8ba01362f57a76209a5f7c1482f4c8522a7","a6135a2b95e8f0d9b19d422b283cf04eab56b64b","864a24ebae7d32e551b8dd8b4047fbe50a89a243","930a244095d85be2668fdf39ec80147291943f93","3de2f528bb6eb399d538312c44fe0d385808dd4a","fd89040b729bf233addaa2410a81e2502a741185","25b467a2dff0251c6c5c2ef3c594b3c1bc26fac3","63b4b29ebaf0cee44bce7248eb674518d0b6da25","b572a1a4dd9d0de9ab68b509a33db798a39aeab2","64241394d51d76890872249bca380f499cc3b6f7","43d22f3c283688dcbc4b421be9fa64334c9380ae","8569b5640c7a45ce884b3d8125dca55416b39057","2ce71ee63021908ee34a9f4cb11573ac622c8b91","620a5dd099e7763441b0d1000b3272e6fcfb48bb","a9645ca8d86f9872e57f811b8a13cd225e2fd06d","cf99d839edac4d64e576553799fab2194798f798","da75eb4eb1488fb74e41a330b393d463708136ca","56e1b21c29a727efe7864b040633cf2aff4a93f4","bd4ac251ab68cd3b60f4fb74c71d6e265e17706c","83c5fc278b9ffd531654f96017dbff0a2fb82b68","dcd0c0ce0cf69ce83e7052763c196833bd37d2bd","0d6cc501a3dbd77430160f2ff96b38d51fcbea29","72fda9269769cd451f358f699e7b757bcefa16a9","d1c227a558bca17fce710bc754f428dd0ef8ea0e","b7bd68d25402d98810228a7fa38de016c8817896","78ee2fe13644406459959cf276092d78e518bd15","2772cd5cc14e3b6a12556faf7fa02b0b46b1fcb3","d9366d3eb1e16a01b2d002b4d582c3ed0cabb955","2b8d60665f805cfa5fa3af07eb9f45e2a429e0ce","0682e1e97f3556e7145a8fac6155dff30c5a3af3","22731d090ff4a22a1464b14f84d8133596f883ae","142b131a287c0f10b086599bbd115f232265db27","2bd3f900337a2b96b8739cd6512cef16779b677e","f62702ca55223236cb9be2689a085678539a4698","b834cdc4aefa0aa98a7edb86a8eedd8161b4ca86","854df64cd29027bfcf8e30bcec1c5bf2c23d5441","71e2e53c00b3d15689aff6bbe125c14e0907ee2a","c51dec096b1bc359718e3ccc807373f8a25af4f7","93b76583319bccdc8727b106e1d15fb4b8673057","cc72a3c7be516c698244fd2e905f1710a5d4f67b","149ce959b02d13e4774b88509083a75db394c312","96a003c42bbca1a3590fb3e6d695f5e6a06737fb","816ca919b9be8e69f7e3be59bca22411d574939e","780109c236ee52a8cf002344571f2b9bc17af668","ec0f414e21ba71fc66bf06a7be6991c51beeb7ec","2a09c0e489224e0bb8b47dc35b720ebaa60145ae","59273be24867ed7986e976a85f8ad2582ce3e65a","6e6f7eb08a0a0e1f14c476da0363d7f327899b4e","cd2a4571fa3863c0f90f635b1c1206c8fd42d0c1","05bbea50dfe63cb2742df823b3066819ad918a1b","d428941ebb45127863bc18dcc3404359c0cc55ab","4abd870c471f455749d8c6a46ec47dacc2583778","18b3c9afd41c82eef26b0f395ef61111ade31e5e","507b41e830c4ce8941d00373c6acda8b6a538320","c9812e52e249b8a34e3515184c5fd833953debe9","ed416d3b60c69ee1eaa6c465857ef1945c15691a","b34dae9f9f656a6505f670502d10f24e24318b81","448bd1e305cd741f9b0ca067c22af930eb0cfcf6","79fbf4684298ca152d590f536c0ad213d74ab720","2d65154440f757994dde170313e0b193368db442","9a1dda7319fe4d557d70c8bbb7fd052b8346ce2b","6328a5c4ce47410a3c8a5a3e930c53533a7861dd","cbdcb756d786c9c5928e18c89bdc87a02a1dd577","ee44c931e7fc7d65cf8c55efcd216b8239f71fd5","c09cfd31c85efb90b545f04d463675730539a657","7882f03e768cae384a3ee6fac2152aad8ce45a3f","b632eada1528706cf895e0b210d3b5065f32200a","40c3cc66c25c55f8a0d716d6cfc01488245f0ccb","9f310ecf2247448838328611a82f3ecb1b0b7bfa","3ff3f6629a62b0b14dff1e58f0c583c0cf0db61d","7a4ccd6db9f6260c7391a65a014c35795bfcca2b","efb832edd674583ffcd449a45de69c139bf6d148","3be270e2af58a133d922c5ab8ca8faab88a0efbb"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Expropriation as an Attempt to Control Foreign Firms in LDCs: Trends from 1960 to 1979","doi":"10.2307/2600634","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.2307/2600634","venue":""}

Parents completed the Infant Toddler Quality of Life Questionnaire (ITQoL), Short Form Health Survey (SF-36v2) (assessing maternal QoL), Baby Eating Behavior Questionnaire (BEBQ) (assessing appetite), and Infant Gastrointestinal Symptoms Questionnaire (assessing GI burden) at enrollment and when infants were 2.5 m, 4 m, and 6 m of age.\n\n\nResults\nAmong 75 enrolled infants, 70 completed the study at age 6 m. At enrollment, only 1 statistically significant moderate correlation (ρ = 0.46, P < 0.01, Table 1) was seen between maternal Physical Health Summary with infant QoL Impact on Parents-Time. However, most infant QoL concepts became moderately associated with maternal Mental Health Summary scores at 6 m. Statistically significant moderate and positive correlations were detected between maternal Mental Health Summary with Satisfaction with Child's Overall Growth and Development, Temperament and Moods, Overall Health, and with 3 Child's Impacts on Parents concepts. At 6 m, statistically significant moderate and positive correlations were seen between BEBQ concepts (Enjoyment of Food and General Appetite) with Temperament and Moods (ρ = 0.47 and 0.40, respectively, P < 0.01). No moderate correlations between BEBQ concepts and maternal QoL were found. Surprisingly, no correlations between GI tolerance measures and maternal/infant QoL concepts was detected except 1 weak correlation between flatulence and infant QoL Impact on Parents-Emotional at enrollment.\n\n\nConclusions\nIn this cohort, relationships between infant and maternal health-related quality of life evolved as infants grew older. Infant temperament and moods positively correlated with both maternal mental and physical health and with infant eating behaviors, suggesting that infant temperament and mood may be an important factor affecting maternal and child health.\n\n\nFunding Sources\nNestec Ltd.\n\n\nSupporting Tables Images and/or Graphs","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Associations Between Health-related Quality of Life, Eating Behavior and Gastrointestinal Tolerance Among Exclusively Breastfed Infant-Mother Dyads in the Philippines (P11-107-19).","doi":"10.1093/cdn/nzz048.P11-107-19","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1093/cdn%2Fnzz048.P11-107-19","venue":"Current developments in nutrition"}

The sediments and waters used were taken from an inner-city heavily polluted canal. Addition of KH2PO4 into the operated experimental units, with and without (i.e., static) intermittent sediment resuspension, were made similar to the external P input and carried out periodically. The results show that the amount of the accumulative P adsorption onto the sediments was up to 363.4 mg x kg(-1) under the conditions of sediment disturbance over a 39-day period, and it was evidently higher than that (213.2 mg x kg(-1)) under static conditions. Sequential fractionation indicated that most of the incorporated P was accounted for in the Fe/Al-P. There were over 61% in the case of intermittent sediment disturbance and up to 83% in the case of static conditions. Based on the bioavailability of Fe/Al-P, 40.6% of the incorporated P was accounted for in non-occluded Fe/Al-P of the sediments under intermittent sediment disturbance conditions. This value increased to 59.5% under static conditions. In addition, more than 23% of the incorporated P was accounted for in HCl-P of the sediments under intermittent sediment disturbance conditions, on the other hand, the concentration of HCl-P kept relatively constant under static conditions. After 39 d of P adsorption by the both sediments, the values of the maximum sorption capacity (S(max)) decreased,while zero equilibrium P concentration (EPC0) and P saturation P(%) increased. However, the extent of EPC0 and P% under intermittent sediment disturbance conditions was obviously lower than that under static conditions. It was hopefully suggested that intermittent sediment disturbance can not only accelerate the P adsorption but also enhance the P retention by sediments.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"[Mechanism of phosphorus adsorption and immobility by sediments in innercity heavily polluted canal].","doi":"","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"Huan jing ke xue= Huanjing kexue"}

I NTRODUCTION Recently, percolation theory has become a useful tool for th e analysis of large scale wireless networks [1]–[6]. A percol ati n process resides in a random graph structure, where nodes or links are randomly designated as either “occupied” or “unoc cupied.” When the graph structure resides in continuous spa ce, the resulting model is described by continuum percolation [1]. A major focus of continuum percolation theory is the random geometric graph induced by a Poisson point process with constant densityλ. A fundamental result for continuum percolation concerns a phase transition effect whereby the macroscopic behavior of the system is very different with densities below and above some critical value λc. For λ < λc (subcritical), the connected component containing the ori gin (or any other node) contains a finite number of points almost surely. Forλ > λc (supercritical), the connected component containing the origin (or any other node) contains an infinit e number of points with positive probability [1]–[3]. Naturally, the characterization of the critical density λc is a central problem in continuum percolation theory. Unfortunately, the exact value of λc is very difficult to find. For two-dimensional random geometric graphs with the Euclidea n norm, simulation studies show that λc ≈ 1.44 [7], while the best theoretical bounds obtained thus far are 0.696 < λc < 3.372 [1]. In this paper, we give a new mathematical characterization of the critical densityλc. We develop an analytical technique based on probabilistic methods [8] and the clustering effect 1This research is supported in part by Army Research Office (AR O) Young Investigator Program (YIP) grant DAAD19-03-1-0229 a nd by National Science Foundation (NSF) grant CCR-0313183. in random geometric graphs. This analysis yields a new class of lower bounds forλc. In particular, the lower bound for two-dimensional random geometric graphs is substantially improved to λc > 0.833. Moreover, the same analytical method can be extended to higher dimensional Poisson random geometric graphs, where we can obtain similar bounds on the corresponding critical densities. II. RANDOM GEOMETRIC GRAPHS We are interested in properties of graphs with vertices placed inR, where the existence of links is determined by geometric proximity. This is the case in wireless networks, where a communication link exists between two vertices if the distance between them is sufficiently small, so that the received power is sufficiently large for proper decoding. A mathematical model for the above scenario is as follows. Let ‖·‖ be some norm onR, e.g. the Euclidean norm, and let Rn be a sequence of n positive parameters, {r1, r2, . . . , rn}. Given a finite set of pointsXn = {x1,x2, . . . ,xn} ⊂ R, we denote byG(Xn;Rn) the undirected graph with vertex set Xn and with undirected edges connecting all those pairs {xi,xj} with ‖xi−xj‖ ≤ min{ri, rj}. The resulting structure is called a geometric graph[2]. A particular category of geometric graphs is based on random point configurations. Let f be some probability density function (p.d.f.) onR, and letX1,X2, ...,Xn be independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) d-dimensional random variables with common density f , whereXi denotes the random location of nodei in R. Finally, let ri = r for all i. The resulting graphG(Xn; r) is referred to as arandom geometric graph[2], [9]. In the following, we consider random geometric graphs inR, with X1,X2, ...,Xn distributed i.i.d. according to p.d.f.f over a given regionA ⊂ R. Let ‖ · ‖ be the Euclidean norm, and let A = |A| be the two-dimensional Lebesgue measure (or area) of A. An event is said to be asymptotic almost sure (abbreviated a.a.s.) if it occurs with a probability converging to 1 as n → ∞. We say f(n) = O(g(n)) if there existsn0 > 0 and constantc0 such thatf(n) ≤ c0g(n) ∀n ≥ n0. We sayf(n) = o(g(n)) if for all constantsc1 there existsn1 > 0 such thatf(n) ≤ c1g(n) ∀n ≥ n1. We say sayf(n) = Ω(g(n)) if g(n) = O(f(n)). We sayf(n) = Θ(g(n)) if f(n) = O(g(n)) and f(n) = Ω(g(n)). Given a graphG = (V, E), whereV andE denote the set of vertices and edges respectively. Given u, v ∈ V , we sayu and v are adjacent(or u is adjacent tov, and vice versa) if there exists an edge between u andv, i.e., (u, v) ∈ E. In this case, we also say that u andv areneighbors. A. Degree Distribution In the following, we outline some basic results for the degree distribution of random geometric graphs. These fact s are required to prove our main result. More detailed discussions can be found in [2], [9], [10]. Consider a vertex j at a given locationxj . A second vertexi is randomly placed in A according to some prescribed p.d.f. f(·). There exists an edge between these two vertices if and only if vertex i lies within a circle of radiusr aroundxj . Let this circular region be denoted as A(xj), then the probability for the existence of an edge between i andj is given by","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0610751v1.pdf"],"title":"New Lower Bound on the Critical Density in Continuum Percolation","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Reuptake regulates the availability of this neurotransmitter and therefore hSERT plays an important role in balancing human mood conditions. In 2016, the first 3D structures of this membrane transporter were reported in an inhibitor-bound, outward-open conformation. These structures revealed valuable information about interactions of hSERT with antidepressant drugs. Nevertheless, the question remains how serotonin facilitates the specific conformational changes that open and close pathways from the synapse and to the cytoplasm as required for transport. Here, we present a serotonin-bound homology model of hSERT in an outward-occluded state, a key intermediate in the physiological cycle, in which the interactions with the substrate are likely to be optimal. Our approach uses two template structures and includes careful refinement and comprehensive computational validation. According to microsecond-long molecular dynamics simulations, this model exhibits interactions between the gating residues in the extracellular pathway, and these interactions differ from those in an outward-open conformation of hSERT bound to serotonin. Moreover, we predict several features of this state by monitoring the intracellular gating residues, the extent of hydration, and, most importantly, protein-ligand interactions in the central binding site. The results illustrate common and distinct characteristics of these two transporter states and provide a starting point for future investigations of the transport mechanism in hSERT.","inCitations":["264a100c2374e40a4591d1b6589858f2991ce8f4"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"A structural model of the human serotonin transporter in an outward-occluded state","doi":"10.1101/637009","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1101/637009","venue":""}
