The projections to the translational invariant space and total- S z -zero space give logarithmically increasing mutual information with respect to the system size. In the anti-ferromagnetic S =1/2 Heisenberg chain and lattice, the optimized energies become accurate numerically using variational states of projected tensor network states, because projections reflecting symmetries of the ground states generate quantum entanglement.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Quantum Entanglement of Tensor Networks with Symmetry Projections","doi":"10.1143/JPSJ.81.043001","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1143/JPSJ.81.043001","venue":""}

The aim of this study is to investigate overweight, as a predictor of brace results in AIS patients.MethodsDesign: retrospective cohort study. Population: 351 AIS patients (306 females), mean age 12.9 ± 1.4, mean Cobb 35.6 ± 11.4°, mean ATR 11 ± 4.3°, BMI 19.7 ± 3, median Risser: 2. Inclusion criteria: no previous treatment, full-time prescription of brace at first visit (18–23 h per day), scoliosis physiotherapeutic exercise according to the SEAS protocol associated. Outcome: improved, progressed, and stable according to the 5° Cobb agreed threshold. Statistics: a stepwise linear regression was used to look for the effect of BMI as a predictor of result. A Chi-square test and logistic regression were used for the overweight category (BMI ≥ 85th percentile). Control for possible confounders was applied.ResultsBMI is poorly correlated with final results. Confounders’ adjustment did not change the correlation, and the predictive model explained about 10% of the result. Brace results were not statistically different in overweight and normal weight: 44 vs 52% improved, 52 vs 41% stable, and 3 vs 7% worsened, respectively.DiscussionBrace results were similar in overweight and normal weight subjects. These findings subvert the previous results and disprove the role of overweight as a negative predictor. Treatment management, brace type and effectiveness may play a major role in reducing the risks of scoliosis progression.","inCitations":["afb93b3e5a8b8f5a6376c119c10a023bc3a76598","bea31444570723d31620f1af0dd6a162b54e686d","830a1a101418276a0b1b2522c236f47b97ff5c90","7fec915d33d327e9ed9c8c0f8aa9fb0441b8cfb1","5d94d4fd2ec041a10c9e70032f2dbcaae3ec9e48","080710d4703d9f9ac950aa7fa2de61971b3c3bb7","a80173336d8753f09c00e78c8ff1a057b6149903"],"pdfUrls":["http://isico.it/images/uploads/pubblicazioni/abstract/ID00513.pdf","https://en.isico.it/isico/ricerca/pdf/ID00513.pdf"],"title":"Overweight is not predictive of bracing failure in adolescent idiopathic scoliosis: results from a retrospective cohort study","doi":"10.1007/s00586-017-4985-y","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00586-017-4985-y","venue":"European Spine Journal"}

(HD) patients. The nutrition care process (NCP) based on assessment, diagnosis, intervention and monitoring of nutritional status is a systematic method that nutrition professionals use to make decisions in clinical practice.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nThis review examines from a clinical-nutritional practice point of view: a) nutritional status as a mortality causative factor; b) phenotypic characteristics of malnutrition/wasting/cachexia, and c) current trends of NCP with special emphasis on nutritional support and novel nutrient and pharmacologic adjunctive therapies in HD patients.\n\n\nMETHOD\nA literature review was conducted using the Pubmed, Science Direct, Scielo, Scopus, and Medline electronic scientific basis. Studies which assessing nutritional status and nutritional support published from 1990 to 2013 in HD patients were included and discussed.\n\n\nRESULTS\nFrom all the epidemiological data analyzed, NCP was the suggested method for identifying malnutrition/ wasting or cachexia in clinical practice. Nutrition support as an unimodal therapy was not completely able to reverse wasting in HD patients. Novel experimental therapeutic strategies including the use of appetite stimulants, ghrelin agonist, MC4-R antagonists, anabolic steroids, anti-inflammatory drugs, cholecalciferol, and other components are still under clinical evaluation.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nNutritional status is a strong predictor of morbidity and mortality in HD patients. The terms called malnutrition, wasting and cachexia have different nutritional therapeutics implications. The NCP is a necessary tool for assessing and monitoring nutritional status in the current clinical practice. Novel pharmacological therapies or specific nutrient supplementation interventions studies are required.","inCitations":["fd12fc0f6d45843e0309a89d172e00afa0cd76bb","581e0a1513c17a5319d01e158038a811bc26a3a9","36e94a3063e740e042b8fe98c38218b17419071f","a6bce7b711075b2b21b7ef561a47effc195a8979","bfbb7fc1cde84c2a3e72b5ced72168cc28f8a06e","b56512007433939b480089f5cecf0291c8a4e0ca"],"pdfUrls":["http://scielo.isciii.es/pdf/nh/v29n4/05revision01.pdf","http://www.redalyc.org/pdf/3092/309231669005.pdf"],"title":"A clinical approach to the nutritional care process in protein-energy wasting hemodialysis patients.","doi":"10.3305/nh.2014.29.4.7222","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.3305/nh.2014.29.4.7222","venue":"Nutricion hospitalaria"}

The proposed model has a simple formulation by using average constitutive relationships and can also estimate the shear contribution of concrete at crack surfaces by fixing crack directions. Using the constitutive laws of principal applied stress direction, the model is applicable to reinforced concrete columns that have a large difference in the amounts of longitudinal and transverse reinforcements. In addition, the effects of bending moment and axial force acting on the shear-critical columns are considered in the proposed formulation. To verify the applicability of the proposed formulation to the shear behaviour of reinforced concrete columns, nine reinforced concrete columns with various shear span-to-depth ratios and axial force ratios were cast and tested. Additionally, the experimentally observed shear strengths of 47 columns in the literature we...","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Non-linear shear analysis of reinforced concrete columns by fixed-angle theory","doi":"10.1680/stbu.10.00069","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1680/stbu.10.00069","venue":""}

Each respondent performed a PC 15 times and a ranking method 6 times (two attempts of ranking three, four, and five health states, respectively). The health states of the PC and the ranking method were constructed to overlap each other. We converted the ranked data into PC data and examined the consistency of the response rate. Applying probit regression, we obtained the predicted probability of each method. Pearson correlation coefficients were determined between the predicted probabilities of those methods. The mean absolute error was also assessed between the observed and the predicted values.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe overall consistency of the response rate was 82.8%. The Pearson correlation coefficients were 0.789, 0.852, and 0.893 for ranking three, four, and five health states, respectively. The lowest mean absolute error was 0.082 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.074-0.090) in ranking five health states, followed by 0.123 (95% CI 0.111-0.135) in ranking four health states and 0.126 (95% CI 0.113-0.138) in ranking three health states.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAfter empirically examining the consistency of the response rate between a PC and a ranking method, we suggest that using five alternatives in the ranking method may be superior to using three or four alternatives.","inCitations":["5f85c662e8ad7029f9d9d644f4335f11c96a4fb6","b6ac492ed8c55c5a5343e9fc3c03499b6baf7b53"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"How Many Alternatives Can Be Ranked?

However, the selective forces leading to single mating in certain conditions and multiple mating in others remain enigmatic. In this study, I investigated whether queens of the wood ant Formica paralugubris adopting different dispersal strategies varied in their mating frequency (the number of males with whom they mated). The frequency of multiple mating was determined by using microsatellite markers to genotype the sperm stored in the spermatheca of queens, and the validity of this method was confirmed by analysing mother–offspring combinations obtained from experimental single-queen colonies. Dispersing queens, which may found new colonies, did not mate with more males than queens that stayed within polygynous colonies, where the presence of numerous reproductive individuals ensured a high level of genetic diversity. Hence, this study provides no support to the hypotheses that multiple mating is beneficial because it increases genetic variability within colonies. Most of the F. paralugubris queens mated with a single male, whatever their dispersal strategy and life history. Moreover, multiple mating had little effect on colony genetic structure: the effective mating frequency was 1.11 when calculated from within-brood relatedness, and 1.13 when calculated from the number of mates detected in the sperm. Hence, occasional multiple mating by F. paralugubris queens may have no adaptive significance.","inCitations":["1a0aaa32cf5ce214214629fbfc67429913709e7a","088e655f898244c5d981092c992bfaab9fe34285","7fc486cdf2cdb2fb4e29b359fd204a3eae9c178e","6c2bcc4a6f04a42c90dcb794b735f3a3587e9acb","9fe3c622f3c2a71ef17b33883a3803b4edab350a","e8c3d2493b93231ac00867ddaa322f64ccb49f1d","2b9befaf99082d3f979534ee89e24c1b3c429bb9","42dce7c9b2e976c869afef7f4e1f9d1ed688b2df","0f3fdb9da86e80326ef110f82fa4959d72f892bd","9c8478bcf27586d34014643bf4cbe5887f59877a","4953f3a8da0bd07f564b1e57c2266ac649f4dd37","635bd7229ff6e2e40bc980ae393612386792f90d","b4f8938708f182d1da9f424b4279d02a197585cd","cd85fa0f28efedb9bea4b1c9d5d4df861740ca61","476d33e0919c01cb9823bba8394e75442bc0616f","e70a51d3156c659f8d1ba55229e2a1d09bfd60b2","946da5fb943686906065639fd3b5c867b3d0f212","68ebeacbcec0832cd31c1e17f25964c9120c4315","c0d05d8d36e36c0fc14bd259e941304992d4277c","d3b43f4c2fe890a54f22afb8026c1b4e27a6c191","ef61f9e8d4d01f0db3d2bff9bce39678bab4bc95","4a2edb3cf0ed8ff148d29619c23c8de9a1add54d","d5a121f83c324fba053734b038ebfdd140c8bf93","78e9e63209e71121077e8b9b1de65a7502c076be","5a4e91a39e1bcb52c19f23323af9e94ba373bb3f","19a8cea5ff59b28183040aa15ec594739859dd05","fa63726d0a6cf7d6285d51bfed806fc4b06b8469","ce6eecbbd2890063913aa7c340226647e602ff85","a6b8f1ad9e9a3ea7bdcad972b285c2f2d986121b","0d54a45c67e6cd487b3bd2c87c98445120ee9dd0","f71314842dffdf6020e8f0c5ca4ca3cc312d6e0a","04888915a7905432ccc94b2fd4bdcd8643f82280","78d43c5e7cc7c54522e374844e41817aa64e4eaf","414bc81645fdbebfe389479983ed7ae32829a4ff","12a2f6d77c075ae6a722034ef063b7108f8c0288","706d996086bfbd8d8caf582b6152f81c0bc07e2a","133fde4f20041283bdfe79e9c952614471666a6c","3f7edea8f27c497fc0282af9da9542c536fc5537","e797fda903e0e177b01fd640b47442271f6ebd77","8836b36a321378ea385b44c27794dde1d4308887"],"pdfUrls":["https://serval.unil.ch/resource/serval:BIB_B38D0E5CD2DD.P001/REF"],"title":"Mating frequency of ant queens with alternative dispersal strategies, as revealed by microsatellite analysis of sperm","doi":"10.1046/j.1365-294x.1998.00422.x","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-294x.1998.00422.x","venue":""}

In addition to having inherent resistance to radiation treatment and chemotherapy, MG cells are highly infiltrative, rendering focal therapies ineffective. Genes involved in MG cell migration and glial cell differentiation are up-regulated by hypophosphorylated nuclear factor I (NFI), which is dephosphorylated by the phosphatase calcineurin in MG cells. Calcineurin is cleaved and thereby activated by calpain proteases, which are, in turn, inhibited by calpastatin (CAST). Here, we show that the CAST gene is a target of NFI and has NFI-binding sites in its intron 3 region. We also found that NFI-mediated regulation of CAST depends on NFI's phosphorylation state. We noted that occupation of CAST intron 3 by hypophosphorylated NFI results in increased activation of an alternative promoter. This activation resulted in higher levels of CAST transcript variants, leading to increased levels of CAST protein that lacks the N-terminal XL domain. CAST was primarily present in the cytoplasm of NFI-hypophosphorylated MG cells, with a predominantly perinuclear immunostaining pattern. NFI knockdown in NFI-hypophosphorylated MG cells increased CAST levels at the plasma membrane. These results suggest that NFI plays an integral role in the regulation of CAST variants and CAST subcellular distribution. Along with the previous findings indicating that NFI activity is regulated by calcineurin, these results provide a foundation for further investigations into the possibility of regulatory cross-talk between NFI and the CAST/calpain/calcineurin signaling pathway in MG cells.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Effects of nuclear factor I phosphorylation on calpastatin (CAST) gene variant expression and subcellular distribution in malignant glioma cells","doi":"10.1074/jbc.RA118.004787","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.RA118.004787","venue":"The Journal of Biological Chemistry"}

This \"memory-prediction\" function is essential to efficient and accurate perception. Many of the defined cognitive deficits associated with schizophrenia suggest a breakdown of memory-prediction function. As deficits in memory-prediction function are proposed to lie more proximal to the biological causes of schizophrenia than deficits in standard cognitive constructs, tests that more directly probe memory-prediction function may be especially sensitive predictors of conversion in individuals at high-risk for schizophrenia. In this article, we review the conceptual basis for this hypothesis, and outline how it may be tested with specific cognitive paradigms. The accurate identification of cognitive processes that precede the onset of psychosis will not only be useful for clinicians to predict which young people are at greatest risk for schizophrenia, but will also help determine the neurobiology of psychosis onset, thus leading to new and effective treatments for preventing schizophrenia and other psychoses.","inCitations":["f867b890ea2c1a5e98a4be7b4d1d203750c7de01","9528ef534fd54697128b376d8f6a0be18cee8e19","98d7407bff9a26f6d9cbc8b88aea11bf6a6c1d45","03f28f6e33326354b78630eddc72f264b3cf1ed8","18e057837cbf290970b786c41dfeabe26f5a64a9","348fa86de7c434d3ff88e08548360d9d191a468d","ba72a9aab2670e45a4d8681517fa88f39977e6b9","249a6b434d8f84d5847c1f7b0bb17df38b929e46","ac86d8aa485ac1da9135b1fa56aa4cdbaf221399","3698e473c1e500d389fb1dd5131cee64d9e85754","5545a273866e8b8dc32d1cf29f91b74921296a83","15eb8e6689e5e7de0d9b2c5b35b7a52ebf749012","32d3a609cba045448ee3a6c789b26651e2a6e85c","7795f75125321ddf623956d9577114c15889bf86"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.annals.edu.sg/pdf/38VolNo5May2009/V38N5p414.pdf"],"title":"Measuring memory-prediction errors and their consequences in youth at risk for schizophrenia.","doi":"","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"Annals of the Academy of Medicine, Singapore"}

V. Contributions on the simulated envelope for diagnostic analysis in regression models. The simulated envelope is a diagnostic analysis method used to evaluate the hypothesis about the probability distribution assumed for the response variable in a regression model. In this work, we describe some procedures to obtain the simulated envelope and, later, we propose a method to decide if we should reject a model using the envelope. In order to compare our procedure with other proposals, we performed a Monte Carlo simulation study in two classes of regression models. The results indicate that the proposed method presents good performance, since it provides stable rejection rates of the model under the correct distribution. About other methodologies, besides having a higher computational cost, the rejection rate under the correct model increases as the sample size rises. In addition, we also compare the full normal plot and the half normal plot with envelope using Monte Carlo simulations studies. The results suggest that, in general, the full normal plot performs better, especially with the proposed procedure. Finally, we apply our decison method and the other proposals to real data from the National Health Survey (Brazil) of 2013. To these data, our method suggested a different decision from that one provided by the other procedures.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://repositorio.ufscar.br/bitstream/handle/ufscar/11534/Diss_Victor_Final_UFSCar.pdf?isAllowed=y&sequence=1"],"title":"Contribuições sobre o envelope simulado na análise de diagnóstico em modelos de regressão","doi":"10.11606/D.104.2019.tde-07082019-113800","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.11606/D.104.2019.tde-07082019-113800","venue":""}

Both points for the LCL origin were marked with 2-mm Kirschner wires. The distances between the center of the anatomic LCL origin and the LCL origin points determined by palpation and fluoroscopic imaging were calculated. An independent t-test was used to compare the distances between the anatomic LCL origin center and the determined LCL origin points.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe LCL origin points determined by fluoroscopic imaging were significantly (P = .005) closer to the anatomic center of the LCL origin point than the ones determined by palpation (3.2 mm ± 1.6 mm vs 5.0 mm ± 1.6 mm, respectively). A total of 92.7% fluoroscopically determined LCL origin points were within a 5 mm radius surrounding the anatomic LCL origin point. In contrast, only 53.8% LCL origin points determined by palpation were within a 5 mm radius surrounding the anatomic LCL origin point.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe use of palpation to identify the LCL origin may not be an accurate method for performing an isometric and anatomic LCL reconstruction. The use of fluoroscopic imaging appears to be a feasible method for identifying the LCL origin in clinical practice and may increase the accuracy of LCL origin identification. Fluoroscopic guidance improves accuracy in determining the anatomic LCL origin, which may help avoiding tunnel malplacement during LCL reconstruction. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The use of a previously described radiographic method for identifying the LCL origin may be used to achieve a more anatomic LCL reconstruction.","inCitations":["16839700948dfc55d3b17a1aa455182fec32ac9a","3ec2844c71958aa0321612dff7c8b6c93c5edf18","b77aefe2bb48b32b37cdacf5ca619d69c954205b"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"The Use of Fluoroscopy Leads to Improved Identification of the Femoral Lateral Collateral Ligament Origin Site When Compared With Traditional Tactile Techniques.","doi":"10.1016/j.arthro.2018.03.035","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.arthro.2018.03.035","venue":"Arthroscopy : the journal of arthroscopic & related surgery : official publication of the Arthroscopy Association of North America and the International Arthroscopy Association"}

This model also predicts relaxation times with a system-specific temperature dependence, as the product of the universal cooperative length scale raised to the sixth power and a non-universal thermally activated process. In the glassy state, the length scale for cooperative motion can become temperature-independent, so the model predicts relaxation times to have an Arrhenius temperature dependence. As expected by the model, the same activation energy is observed both above and below the glass transition. At sufficiently high temperatures the model ceases to apply to relaxation times, and the crossover to a high-T Arrhenius temperature dependence provides an experimental estimate of the caging temperature. We also report an approximate power law relation between the fragility index and the cooperative length scale at the glass transition.","inCitations":["81dde688db6cdec188738fc68db2adcd1dc4b3ff","c5bc428857f12bc5292f28a26274d1753903558c","7b9369a568cbf26f34ef6e663ad321a5ce8c6438","1dc4c2c7be52331b844e60987361212dd3961599","06f15a91b583dc20a9ef87d5b2a21cef6f2ef823"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Temperature dependence of relaxation times and the length scale of cooperative motion for glass-forming liquids","doi":"10.1016/S0022-3093(02)01464-3","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/S0022-3093%2802%2901464-3","venue":""}

In this paper,the concepts and calculating methods of a 3D model of ecological footprint recently introduced by Niccolucci and Wackernagel,etc.are discussed systematically.In particular,a great deal of emphasis is put on two indicators of the 3D model-footprint depth and footprint size.The main strengths of this model are also studied by comparing it with the classical model.Some improvements are proposed using two new indicators-appropriation rate of capital flows and use ratio of stocks to flows.An empirical analysis on China based on the data of national footprint accounts during 1961—2006 illustrates and tests the methods discussed.It is concluded that the footprint depth has almost tripled since 1978 when China entered an ecological deficit era,while the footprint size declined by 12%.This presents a huge demand for compensating the lack of natural capital flows through depletion of stocks under the high human induced pressure.In 2006,China required also almost 3 times its land area to support its population′s resource consumption.In this sense,the 3D model becomes a temporal-spatial approach to better explain the difference between human demand for natural capital flows and stocks.It enhances comparability between either different regions or different generations,and is partly able to avoid excessively conservative estimates.Room for further improvement is identified as well.","inCitations":["310313c8964eef2c2ca068faf85cf12f42f97df3","6b1e0192ec13f454f226ec297b7dbb53d110672d","4d0dcd132ca03cb17dc2c1158c992565b5067591","8acc5ff603c0615c390a18454838b0bad983d7d7","21de47a8841345071c88816d71ff841c52b53f2f"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.ecologica.cn/stxb/ch/reader/create_pdf.aspx?file_no=stxb201111051670&flag=1&journal_id=stxb&year_id=2013"],"title":"Ecological footprint depth and size: new indicators for a 3D model","doi":"10.5846/stxb201111051670","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.5846/stxb201111051670","venue":""}

Half of our subjects are “watched” by images of a robot presented on their computer screen. The robot—named Kismet and invented at MIT—is constructed from objects that are obviously not human with the exception of its eyes. In our experiment, Kismet produces a significant difference in behavior that is not consistent with existing economic models of preferences, either self- or other-regarding. Subjects who are “watched” by Kismet contribute 29% more to the public good than do subjects in the same setting without Kismet.","inCitations":["2947661784445c786f5204e50fce4cf76076d7ec","2483fe3d0d73afcb6160980dbbfdb4e5ff2e9f23","86bdd1fbb499f2ea105295bed5ed13ddfe0c570a","30bba022b9f2149706b6d844acda96613b5ee8a5","2845d6111b60d178b3740c7e55b48161e18b1068","1edb4fb984fb8352fdbbebf871aaf917affb7f04","59a289a6c335d4d5e3ad3375f745cc030e5f7cdc","49e989b97d8a9d0ab0145c714e0ca70dae6bd876","a9c635485f7af271ade7cfc59376b67a4bace2dc","87dca42638f3a12f7e6e258899b0b6a2c08e514a","5e94555b69dc8d582dc98c4c57146c6ee7a82cc5","747ab26373a10d1404502a0fed4bc50419ec064a","a9345e462a744f8c887a966ca7527139b6910f29","ac3c9ca2224415cb08be787cb43700f150821644","0107af89fa87a5f95642e1175ff26e6b77eab10b","7ba3a3c6c5d566c1a986f0abb11b2a3cd5f8c8db","6018e25fb062da8d1e8765fccba0a4f6bef3c873","aa2068713fdbc6185143cd7dd18c0b58711b5528","22b2dbad31d39ba2a32c7e7c6074ad2f3857fff6","f259d0fc89e3fb714968d2d7364143fd15d8b332","2c5c455786fd59a8349d709f34ad11cb1c307e70","bebca25570ba88f4f2fd9b03c052402f4098048e","759f5481ca28e682f42c6f4ea8ed90f3b995d6c1","cde6830170b24929231e282b8ebf45cd5bfd0f44","0584144fcb2062a76bd077635a6850bbb53a7a1b","60e2318be6f370b6ca3ba182befc2cd915b9d69f","34b1ab475278e3bf7d29203737873e66b764f3d7","c9966ba440ba472feba6e1e1141e310af7299866","5bf68dcd9fb081f0d83c52e2e8424218715f9108","bc97c1eaef15f2a97e3862f1557e4255b5796df6","851f7c665af296270f26a90d6b48d0eac312cd1e","d2b42dda5eb8e8e1edc269e44105be5c00b2bcc7","9def5a8771089a357e511faf496d8bbc7ff69bc1","f87e67183f3cac1d50aebb396c23d6e2e76be559","7b20f731a6e03b0cbd174f3a046c0f3fc90a47f3","ba7afaf2d9a5195f9925844c63d297eed23fcf58","622f12844ae6620973db3022789896eb7b0da3a6","88a863d84442b82542d4d88449e8f2843de7f303","312c42491b7dc925d302fba8bf9f184528fcae50","83056d527e4e4773a57e2c9004de9febd0948e33","64358080a777c2f0d91f2d899397307f107ed550","6e18864bcf79315b2ffdd83f49d5903cfb001cde","b8bd4413a6b2001bad04dcb9495c55fb455d435d","85a93b497c1862a88b7313e5f5dd5d340f4f5b7f","a07d25d7e5d2c601554fdf0888f50fe6daeea3b3","1f629809ff619ad84d4a1623dc8f837cc2fa3add","9d174f3aaed1c3f5faf7151908d02bf2b09178a0","227062c1799f1d8b19d81e4f95a534968ecc8454","6d73f6630cef31dd1ab71245d0c7f64c92951780","4810203d0bac04bb79c9c35f39d7f1756f5cfa39","e27007e58e7ed373ded5997f7545fcc0b08c7c44","af31a2044622f29f1bffbb11d2ef2bd9d13f2c88","7abd4b133770a6a342d939851bb9b0d331a95f3d","cc65c86680a931620e2dc17c1b00cb68717b406d","b7473e7d19e56920d5de520b3356951e2e0300b0","66d11874dc21f9e974b0cae057d281949aead74a","8033fa283fc5aab0de4e2908a91988601b2b1f42","1611abe4db1ac742b4289a8675f58cc6943e105c","0cdb19cd97f4815291b316b7f0a0d75585e9427a","7fe8647c50c400580acb88f3f3b0ad11772dfa2d","346ece2e3bcb0c7239a65906e2e2c68d12d10a85","8be7043d70985f5b1fe736d6f4ac3972f01959ea","5dde9d2c21f66a467d8a39f547b903baa653b2b5","305e06c2942e4c51509f9851a2bffa93100e8859","ebdf0a85f1ab0056461888f542efb380f8deb6c4","04d0fa0202b58ed6adeae3b77f3379e50c6f57a0","9cad6ad7a0e3ac9159d68f243e43f86aa4d1f8cf","c8b08314ef3b6a019e1fde540dc54d452be7f4c0","efcca531a3d0bfdc8f809d53b6dfe9200200b385","175a2daeb756a17a7d3128694a56a3e8a247ed95","346bdd0b382aa0bc15530d4d8b1d0411bcfcf1e1"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~ped/publications/PEDpublications/2007/Burnham%20and%20Hare,%202007,%20Engineering%20Cooperation,%20Does%20Involuntary%20Neural%20Activation%20Increase%20Public%20Goods%20Contributions.pdf","http://brtf.sdsc.edu/biblio/EngineeringHumanCooperation.pdf","http://blueribbontaskforce.sdsc.edu/biblio/EngineeringHumanCooperation.pdf","http://evolutionaryanthropology.duke.edu/sites/evolutionaryanthropology.duke.edu/files/site-images/Burnham%20and%20Hare_%202007_%20Engineering%20human%20cooperation-does%20involuntary%20neural%20activation%20increase%20public%20goods%20contributions.pdf"],"title":"Engineering Human Cooperation","doi":"10.1007/s12110-007-9012-2","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s12110-007-9012-2","venue":"Human nature"}

The fluid enters the channel with uniform axial velocity \n and temperature. The wall of the channel is assumed to be at uniform \n temperature which is different that of the fluid at the inlet of the channel. \n The distribution of the entropy generation as well as the total entropy \n generation has been studied numerically. It is found that the Re number and \n the geometric parameters, height ratio and module length ratio have \n significant effect on both the local concentrations of entropy generation as \n well as the total entropy generation in the channel. Flow separation and \n re-circulation size, strength and location of flow are found to be major \n concern in determining the local entropy generation.","inCitations":["f0dc984ea613f02ba9532c643e1b5ad56799c107","b5ab7744a33932951c1ad334b2fb70ec0bcf8144","fa8a63727825859d8d564fd495630e8ee05fe727","cc51a20d633f047be8aae55df5a1ab59db54e659"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.doiserbia.nb.rs/img/doi/0354-9836/2013/0354-98361200200B.pdf"],"title":"Thermodynamic Analysis of Fluid Flow in Channels with Wavy Sinusoidal Walls","doi":"10.2298/tsci110403200b","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.2298/tsci110403200b","venue":""}

The effect of isochronal heating of deformed samples on the spectral distribution of the recombination radiation due to regular segments of dissociated 60° dislocations of “relaxed” morphology was studied over the range from 130 to 700 °C. The substantial redistribution of the PL intensity after the 500 °C heating of deformed samples correlates with a decrease of a major portion of deformation-induced point defects ( PDs ). This suggests that the PDs annealing is accompanied by gathering of impurities near 60° dislocation cores and changing of the radiation energy of regular segments of dissociated 60° dislocations.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Dislocation photoluminescence in plastically deformed germanium","doi":"10.1016/j.physb.2009.08.112","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.physb.2009.08.112","venue":""}

The mean concentration of CRF did not increase during labor, and it decreased rapidly after delivery. On the contrary, the mean plasma level of ACTH increased only slightly during late pregnancy, but during labor the increase was significant. These findings suggest that CRF in maternal circulation is not primarily involved in the regulation of maternal ACTH secretion, and the stress of labor does not increase the release of CRF, which probably originates mainly from the placenta.","inCitations":["151ba02dd25d3834c2e92927eb6a8c0753cb824c","6d0c6d134ca18c3e2648dbb6ff36775081a3668e","9cef761b3e7d7e144a8b0a9b23630af798e91e09","adfa10edc2a6ca87135cd06c610b08f8cedb8b03","ab6a5db2bb0ac90080d4e362a48ae220549e7599","eb848ec70329a29027c73dafbe3ae48f9a076ce8","b0e2fdc96b8beb6f6f1e4f21895ea3630c505117","a73248d5c43ae9e709131ebfc43962f7e2fec43a","586c483684d872107acdfb9688b177e4a84868e6"],"pdfUrls":["https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0143417987901016","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0143417987901016?dgcid=api_sd_search-api-endpoint"],"title":"Immunoreactive corticotropin-releasing factor and corticotropin during pregnancy, labor and puerperium","doi":"10.1016/S0143-4179(87)90101-6","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/S0143-4179%2887%2990101-6","venue":"Neuropeptides"}

Relational search procedures, as proposed by Edgar F. Codd, offered both improved data independence and an enhanced combinatorial freedom for the user.

This politically significant change of technocultural patterns led to wild debates, and not only among intellectuals. Likewise, the change meant big trouble for software engineers. Advocates of user independence tried to promote their concepts, destabilize adversative suggestions, and gain allies by aggressive claims, heroic narratives, and cooperative publication strategies.","inCitations":["5befea7e767ee6ded3280d84078359506edd06ed"],"pdfUrls":["https://www.tg.ethz.ch/fileadmin/redaktion/dokumente/PDF_Files/2012_Gugerli_World_As_Database.pdf"],"title":"The World as Database: On the Relation of Software Development, Query Methods, and Interpretative Independence","doi":"10.1353/lac.2012.0016","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1353/lac.2012.0016","venue":""}

This study evaluates the public health implications of Salmonella species contamination of naira notes obtained from butchers in Abakaliki meat market, Ebonyi State. A total of 95 samples of naira notes in different denominations (N5 to N1000) were randomly collected from butchers within Abakaliki metropolis between the months of March and May, 2016. All the naira note samples were analysed using standard  microbiological procedures. A total of nine (9.5 %) Salmonella spp isolates were obtained from the 95 naira note samples. All the Salmonella spp  isolates were completely resistant (100 %) to ceftazidime. The highest susceptibility frequency was observed for ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, meropenem, imipenem, and ofloxacin with values ranging from 88.9 % - 77.8 %. There was a statistically significant difference in the mean percentage resistance and susceptibility of the Salmonella spp isolates (P ˂ 0.05). Most of the Salmonella spp isolates exhibited multi-drug resistant traits as they were resistant to at least two different classes of antibiotics. The average multiple antibiotic resistance indices (MARI) of the Salmonella spp isolates was 0.35. This study shows that ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, meropenem, imipenem, and ofloxacin are still effective in the treatment of bacterial infections caused by Salmonella spp .

In the New Testament the term \"church\" is used variously. In the Acts and Pauline Epistles it is applied to local, regional, even house (ecclesia domestica) \"churches,\" as well as to \"the Church\" simpliciter. In Matthew 16 the usage is clearly universal; in chapter 18 it is more properly local. 2. The question is whether the term is thus polyvalent or merely ambiguous (polyguous) if not downright equivocal. It can be urged, however, that the distinction between universal and local church is not primarily theological, but rather a sociological observation which theology must then clarify. 3. Mutual Primacies, (a) The universal Church has primacy insofar as the Church is really ultimately the will of God to save all men (2 Tim 2:4) and the new creation consequent upon that saving will (Rom 5:12-21). (b) The local church (which must not be restricted to either the liturgical Eucharistic synaxis or the Ignatian bishop church) has primacy insofar as the Church is the concrete actualization of the peoplehood of God's election. The creature must be someplace, the Eucharist must be celebrated someplace. Hence the advantage of the local church is its here and now definiteness, its diversity and its unavoidable demand to make a decision. The advantage of the universal Church is its anti-sectarian and world-wide dimension. Conflict between them is not in their ecclesial ontology nor is it theoretically a desideratum. This does not mean that conflict is neither possible nor practically undesirable. 4. Reconciliation between the universal and local Church is to be sought in the understanding that \"being\" is \"being-with,\" that \"substance\" is \"relationship\" (according to the ontology implicit in the doctrines of Trinity and Christology). Hence the relation between the universal and local Church is best described by the term \"perichoresis.\" Hence the local church is not a merely jurisdictional administrative unit nor does the universal Church grow \"federally\" as if by the annexation","inCitations":["051a87b2dd5eab5bf6a757da4c814ce27663fc2a"],"pdfUrls":["https://ejournals.bc.edu/ojs/index.php/ctsa/article/download/2770/2405"],"title":"Theology of the Local Church","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Promising results are obtained by using hydrophobic photosensitizers which can be specifically transported and released to the tumour by serum lipoproteins, especially low-density lipoproteins. The photosensitizer molecule should possess those structural features which induce a high probability of photoactivation by 700–800 nm light, as well as a high yield of long-lived triplet state. The use of liposome-delivered Zn-phthalocyanine as a second generation phototherapeutic agent for tumours is proposed.","inCitations":["d8beaf1690591da58ab8a3832e529c4afd5c5f2c","04cdf7a3d1ac41bcfe86986f9115d64c9069d7d8","772a6943d39b470c5e9657318c8dbe58a9c4a61a","618ae155bec95b4c9ce0a447c5850e66a7cbc5b7","eb5d2b9f230802f9e363a34e71f432cc8d88735b","e18cc0a244ec1ce00457c8feed11eb62f94187de","a07b63fdd960d90472b82ec6b11f3f1fe9da4da9","52b77545003c3d44175d5524944af63824c3cfe7","0ffa19af5e1749f58ced70c6a1100c5133b821d1","91eeeebf919e2d0b95ca24d0adb521ac7abcc1a9","6f3d91d04f7a915dbc1d0cb06922d457a0cebdc1","62f69c1417b5b0a7c6b24d4daeb758a4e4e9c244"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Factors controlling the selectivity and efficiency of tumour damage in photodynamic therapy","doi":"10.1007/BF02031372","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/BF02031372","venue":"Lasers in Medical Science"}

Furthermore, automatic reference obstruction analysis was optimised. Values of the minimal lumen diameter (MLD), reference vessel diameter (RVD), percent diameter stenosis (DS) and bifurcation angle (BA) for the different bifurcation segment models were validated against precision manufactured plexiglass phantoms. In anteroposterior views, accuracy and precision (mean difference±SD) of 11- and 6-segment models for MLD were 0.013±0.082 mm vs. 0.003±0.100 mm, for RVD -0.030±0.047 mm vs. -0.029±0.045 mm and for DS -0.48±3.66% vs. -0.11±3.97%. In smaller vessel segments (true MLD <0.7 mm), MLD overestimation was reduced. Inter-observer variability for MLD, RVD and DS for either model was ≤0.052 mm, ≤0.043 mm and ≤2.24%, respectively. Agreement between models for MLD, RVD and DS was ±0.076 mm, ±0.021 mm and ±2.53%, respectively. Accuracy and precision for BA were -2.6±3.5°, and variability was ≤1.2°. Accuracy and precision for diameter-derived parameters were slightly decreased in projections with 30° rotation; BA precision dropped to 6.2°.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nMLD quantification is improved for true MLD <0.7 mm, resulting in highly accurate and precise diameter measurements over the entire range of phantom diameters. Automatic reference obstruction analysis provides highly accurate, precise and reproducible RVD and DS measurements.","inCitations":["7b2ee852b25c847ffc1619843a05a6306941c8ee","a9b513f81f0a14812490b8f4637d745cf476d255","aac2a177d94e254a48677e20cc4d6078ba6eed1a","a745dad61d4d7aabd59de536606f010fa2999d8c","13e07e4d2205c0968a54e253f0aa43f70b539b5a","e32c47ac2525d1e5d6a7c26dedcd63b4b46732ed","492836d3fa140b9342aa6f9e9399c83d0cb8787c","ec5c732ab1393deace02c713f1fcdafe2fec95c0","67cfdd946f195cc2ef947933f62f035bc96a0d4a","a82f2e685e02fbf355485d101a229d463c9fb216","a9e36afa7940f44f52d2446670dcc64c243c3d42","8cfa7ff526d0d85114a606dcb9b4e91dfc4c0963"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Advances in two-dimensional quantitative coronary angiographic assessment of bifurcation lesions: improved small lumen diameter detection and automatic reference vessel diameter derivation.","doi":"10.4244/EIJV7I11A208","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.4244/EIJV7I11A208","venue":"EuroIntervention : journal of EuroPCR in collaboration with the Working Group on Interventional Cardiology of the European Society of Cardiology"}

We propose to do it through moving and executing user-defined programs near the data inside an object storage cloud, which is significantly different from traditional public clouds having well-known security vulnerabilities. As arbitrary separation of storage and computation increases latency and decreases performance for cloud file sharing, our approach is to package application requirement and move data after processing them based on the requirements, rather than moving data first and then process them where the application is located. Here, first, resizing images is done according to several dimensions for covering diversified remote devices. Then, encoding of images is done using the P-Fibonacci transform of Discrete Cosine Coefficients PFCC algorithm. Afterwards, images are resized to both JPEG and PJPEG types of images for faster and smooth use through adding a new middleware named iBuck. Furthermore, detailed experimentation have been carried out to evaluate performance of the middleware service on cloud file sharing environment.","inCitations":["db3a6b68461b3fa494ce8826acd5325e37d4f9fe","f7ddd8dbfd1effaca89484924c96ae70d98f253b"],"pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1109/NSysS.2017.7885816"],"title":"iBuck: Reliable and secured image processing middleware for OpenStack Swift","doi":"10.1109/NSysS.2017.7885816","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NSysS.2017.7885816","venue":"2017 International Conference on Networking, Systems and Security (NSysS)"}

The tendency of recrystallization for these alloys was explained by Zener Hollomon parameter(Z).

The model incorporates both the thermal losses and the water usage to determine the temperature of the water in the tank. Water heater loads are extracted from household load data and then used to determine the household water usage patterns. The benefits of the model are: (1) the on/off state of the water heater and temperature of the water in the tank can be accurately predicted, and (2) it enables the development of water usage profiles so that users can be classified based on usage behaviour. As a result, the amount of ancillary services and peak shaving that can be achieved are accurately predictable and can be maximized without adversely affecting users.","inCitations":["a997453211435088c0a8fe5dabd8b43503a3fe33","b25482ecd7c2de565d41beb53640e3a75b8150cf","ec4518e1ed08c312843de9b743705f025c2ecb82","68f8531b1f5e9c6299b72be889457d77fa6b6b8e","e4f3e3b9c43a2edeb9ffa8ab852a214e87774020","08f95226b344ce5dfb63e375afe01659b89235bf","0153d46d4563bb73e59d45f26e0f9ca997c8784f","26697a027e4ac911c2efef75d2ccbc3c72ff3555","c9dae8daa65836f5ad37a9c6a82439fed85706c3","55ebc96d2d2003be816c92d30f28a373daf43b65","a5607272a12d4fd23b7eb5699abe1c4795cb2661","59f1acb6d657b87c80e0d87068532aeab0022918","19c722440f1d4cc1dc53f57c5d00ff12b43ebfc0","3b8735a736ecafcd8bc1603fbd9fe4d2eb79c6d1","376440e6caff92f217852018254103898749a196","5e836443769bfe8073bd6de394ca8dabf6cc2247","f69096e9647d734f11daa24707542804ed4503fa","997f0f039790389525e1da4a23436d1c3d4b1947","59ae3b92cac8e19990aa57a0f53e4ba2c6f397a8","58683a3b7c1b502cc2411643ca2521cdee40ecb7","2d0bba67b23461b62ee59fb37e0406333af2dc85","4fb2d08ee86541058983f597b7bf1901b11610c5","b3ac76f69e27a74af37824504d7c26de1764accd","54f3688ab476da601b538b3bc790975575c80509","664bffcbdd3fd07d74a1d55cc9332827c6b8907c","e07dc21f738b0293b3ed190858dec9ca27ec746d","398030bbdf82c5e678b1a112f296a2c29b4f5c8c","33a997ca29d149a12061933a8fd2ae8677934062","b6ae7b34c3c95c9e4f2642b31c93981fa44294ad","2e82972c8ca5ffa897ec7b3bc49fef0f74ae6030","307bc8d79015cdabb557518d1e32707d4605060b","9064a23dde20c4d4bb3e42a8b340d10690f07b23","118213bb0ec3b596d68a9fd503ba8abf7ae48219","f90002593252ced978126f2aec4600f6104e9266","27b5347c9c6a5411e13a2e62664dd625664066b1","db18a38870264443b7497230ea588ddec7f53ac3","965958885f2bbb3db55a7d590bffbac88b775881","be714482b1cf9097d51d4e5ed02e256a82521b29","5cb5b5d87dbf3cc6a51187336e439112875a0a32","86a45ef6ade7b21a9141e9901054863685f36bd5","9e097b1bd654f1b1dead7840f3d412c7813b80da","88ba0f40ec233bb29c817949469f993c2d5c0621","6bf2402e3fd4d7ca84e62b42df02bf9a8adc4ee7","163fa5a220be5fbb47219a71c15614731bc57909","8a856882d29a459694ee2e50e642b618f7232889","a93de05149308c1d9b18d1d7e69e1fc318c53963","7c323a0f19adbe63212269fc53ca60116db5ce29","4c7f9e63a70daf266f1fe5ee0a8234634816528c","d3db9126a7f59b316d9d96eae78a2ff0c39192c3","106b02255af0f24ce6b920331c499fa39202cbb6","37f2ba410623322a1e0e2b264dd368a354e49f29","066d5c67a7785fb7db1080c9b56f77cd057c71d7","59a9cc0691b72d68e3e62549fedf5e1eb029453b","6c24f97b30b3bdcc7638e4386c44a20162643b9e","33ad080b89bac0e10235f299cfc7f612ab0a409f","27799dd154b0efd3834f4975a41d12cf40fd76d2","692fa555ea0189a3497135d3b0351e9ebcb7b83d","a31b544cc540d784514fcda5e3d241432381b8e3","894b4b918cb4abe5dbaa20507191c712f6cb64c7","de518b4305f0aac05f88a3969511acc18fa8bdfc"],"pdfUrls":["https://people.csail.mit.edu/lpaull/publications/Paull_EPSR_2010.pdf"],"title":"A novel domestic electric water heater model for a multi-objective demand side management program ☆","doi":"10.1016/j.epsr.2010.06.013","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.epsr.2010.06.013","venue":""}

His head is adorned by a helmet – or it might be a head-dress – from which rise two horn-like projections, each one terminating with the head of a bird, clearly delineated with eye and beak. The birds (the curl of their beaks suggests they are intended to be understood as raptors) face each other, curving inward until they overlap and form a circle above the spearman’s clean-shaven face. To the right of this figure stands another apparition. He too holds a spear, thrust seemingly into the earth – or perhaps into the foot of his companion. He is drawing a sword with his right hand. This figure is clothed, perhaps even in armour, but a tail hangs down at his rear and his features are inhuman. He has the head of a beast. \n \nVarious overlapping interpretations have been offered for this striking image – it is Oðinn/Woden leading an ecstatic dance; a warrior in ritual transformation from man to wolf; a shaman enacting an initiatory rite; the dramatisation of a mythological scene. We will almost certainly never understand what message this image was truly intended to convey. What is clear, however, is that in this image the categories of beast and human are inextricably blurred, confused, confounded. Who here is the human? Which is the god, the animal, the hybrid? Does the naked spearman wear birds upon his head or do divine raptors control the body of a human puppet? Does a man wear a wolf’s clothing, or does a wolf wear a man’s? It is precisely this sort ambiguity in the representation of beasts and beast-identities that lies at the heart of this collection of papers. \n \nThe image on the cover of this book is a matrix of 7th century date, found at Torslunda in Sweden, and designed for the production of panels of decorated metal ultimately destined for the ostentatious helmets of an elite warrior aristocracy. Objects bearing this style of iconographic display are exemplified by finds from the Swedish cemeteries of Vendel and Valsgarde but also in similar objects from English contexts: the famous helmet from mound 1 at the Sutton Hoo cemetery in East Anglia and fragments from the Staffordshire Hoard found in the West Midlands. The precise mechanisms that linked England and Scandinavia in this period are hard to define with precision, but artefactual, iconographic, linguistic, literary and mortuary parallels demonstrate a degree of contact and the sharing of cultural concepts. The geographical remit of the papers presented in this volume reflects the fact that ideas about the natural world – especially the ways in which its fauna were represented and imagined – were fluid around what might be described as a ‘north sea cultural zone’: they certainly did not respect the political boundaries of modern nation states. How and in what ways ideas changed over time and were shared amongst the inhabitants of this zone will be explored by some of the chapters directly, but will also (we hope) be illuminated by the juxtaposition of studies treating the theme of ‘beasts’ from a variety of disciplinary and regional perspectives within these vaguely defined parameters.","inCitations":["42b81e5b5ab7d6d698b8a86a4dc0d835be2fd90e"],"pdfUrls":["https://filesartw.firebaseapp.com/aa410/representing-beasts-in-early-medieval-england-and-scandinavia-anglo-saxon-studies-178327008x.pdf"],"title":"Representing beasts in early medieval England and Scandinavia: an introduction","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

For nearest neighbor antiferromagnetic Heisenberg interactions there is no Neel ordering at zero temperature both for quantum and classical spins. We show that, due to the peculiar structure, antisymmetric Dzyaloshinski-Moriya interactions (D.(S i × S j )) are present in this -lattice. In order to derive microscopically this interaction we consider a set of localized d-electronic states. For classical spins systems, we then study the phase diagram (T, D/J) through mean field approximation and Monte-Carlo simulations and show that the antisymmetric interaction drives this system to ordered states as soon as this interaction is non-zero. This mechanism could be involved to explain the magnetic structure of Fe-jarosites.","inCitations":["5a5118cf91943f5812c58fae548a5a6f5fbdcbe9"],"pdfUrls":["https://arxiv.org/pdf/cond-mat/0108003v1.pdf"],"title":"Dzyaloshinski–Moriya interactions in the kagomé lattice","doi":"10.1016/S0921-4526(01)01543-5","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/S0921-4526%2801%2901543-5","venue":""}

Hot springs are generally the result of water flowing through hot rock formations and eventually reaching the surface as fumaroles, geysers, or other outlets. Water temperatures can be extremely hot; the thermal springs in Arkansas flow at a fairly constant temperature of about 64 °C throughout the year. Thermal waters are often highly charged with dissolved minerals due to the dissolving power of hot water and the fact that they are under high pressures underground. Thus, at spring sources, and for varying distances downstream, one may observe deposits of minerals that precipitate out as soon as both pressure and temperature are reduced when exposed to air. Bacteria appear to be the only living organisms existing in water up to 75.5°C Algae are the life-forms most adaptable to existing under high temperatures, and their presence provides the brilliant colors found in many of the large hot pools that form the source of the thermal springs. Cyanobacteria, such as Synechocyetis and Phormidium, have been found flourishing in waters as hot as 60°C. As waters cool to below 40°C, diatoms begin to appear. Protozoa, water mites, and midges are also found near the sources of these springs where the water has cooled to around 50°C As the water further cools downstream, the normal occupants of streams begin to appear—mayflies, stoneflies, and fishes.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Special Riverine Systems","doi":"10.1016/B978-012050340-7/50014-5","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-012050340-7%2F50014-5","venue":""}

However, the back-propagated values of different layers vary dramatically. This inconsistence of gradient magnitude across different layers renders optimization of deep neural network with a single learning rate problematic. We introduce the back-matching propagation which computes the backward values on the layer's parameter and the input by matching backward values on the layer's output. This leads to solving a bunch of least-squares problems, which requires high computational cost. We then reduce the back-matching propagation with approximations and propose an algorithm that turns to be the regular SGD with a layer-wise adaptive learning rate strategy. This allows an easy implementation of our algorithm in current machine learning frameworks equipped with auto-differentiation. We apply our algorithm in training modern deep neural networks and achieve favorable results over SGD.","inCitations":["8dc5f55d3ad0c1711081c78f6b97ee23b0971e13"],"pdfUrls":["https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.09750v1.pdf","https://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1802.09750","http://arxiv.org/abs/1802.09750"],"title":"Train Feedfoward Neural Network with Layer-wise Adaptive Rate via Approximating Back-matching Propagation","doi":"","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"ArXiv"}

Multi-hop transmission is carried out between the source and the destination nodes by concatenating consecutive cluster-to-cluster hops. For each hop, both the transmit and the receive clusters can exploit node cooperation such that cooperative distributed multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channels can be formed. As proposed in [1], a time-division protocol is employed for transmissions within a cluster and between clusters, i.e., the intra-cluster slot is used for broadcasting within the transmit cluster, and the inter-cluster slot is used for transmissions between clusters. Distinguished from the scheme in [1] that space-time codes (STC) are utilized for inter-cluster transmissions, random beamforming is proposed in this paper, which is shown to outperform STC in term of energy efficiency provided that the number of nodes within receive cluster is adequately large. We demonstrate that even with moderate number of nodes within receive cluster, e.g., 10 nodes, random beamforming can offer higher energy efficiency for inter-cluster links, at 5% outage rate. The \"random\" nature incorporated in random beamforming scheme assigns the clusterhead node within receive cluster in an alternate manner, thus balancing energy consumption within receive cluster.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1109/WCNC.2008.98"],"title":"Space-Time Codes Versus Random Beamforming in Cooperative Multi-Hop Wireless Networks","doi":"10.1109/WCNC.2008.98","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCNC.2008.98","venue":"2008 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference"}

Using a combination of hierarchical model-space partitioning, OpenGL-assisted view-frustum culling, and OpenGL-assisted occlusion culling, we achieve a significantly better performance on general polygonal models than previous approaches. In contrast to these approaches, we only exploit common OpenGL features and therefore, our algorithm is also well suited for low-end OpenGL graphics hardware.

In the history of science and technology, there have been situations where very simple concepts have changed the world; the creation of the wheel is a clear example of this. Often, these inventions have come to life as a result of specific human needs which must be satisfied. Since the invention of radio waves in the nineteenth century, communication systems have become a priority, not only for military use, but also for civilian applications, with an increasing interest in having more demanding services from the users. This situation has motivated scientists and researchers to seek novel and innovative methods to provide broadband services throughout the wireless channel, serving a larger number of users and improving spectral efficiency. The potential of HAPS is dawning on us slowly. The acronym HAPS is a term standing for high altitude platform stations, also known as stratospheric repeaters [WRC-122, 97], [ITU-F.592, 02]. HAPS is the name of a technology for providing wireless narrowband and broadband telecommunication and broadcasting services. HAPS aims to provide these services to users using either aircraft (manned or unmanned) or lighter-than-airships (LTA). These platforms are reusable and positioned at stratospheric altitudes, from 20 to 50 km approximately. The International Telecommunications Union (ITU) published a report in 1998 which outlines HAPS as a new technology, entitled High Altitude Platform Stations: an opportunity to close the information gap [ITU-Q/2, 98]. The ITU defines HAPS as a term referring to balloons or high-altitude aircraft that can be used to provide communication services [ITU-F.1399, 01], [ITU, 03]. A HAPS, in essence, is a radio relay in the sky. The ITU has described HAPS as representing a new and long anticipated technology that can revolutionise the telecommunication industry. It is the next generation of wireless communications infrastructure that can make efficient use of radio spectrum","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://media.wiley.com/product_data/excerpt/17/04705106/0470510617.pdf","http://media.wiley.com/product_data/excerpt/17/04705106/0470510617.pdf"],"title":"Introduction 1.1 What Is a Haps?

The corpus was automa- tically segmented at the phonetic, syllabic and word levels (EasyAlign), and in larger pause-separated units. Part-of- speech annotation (DisMo) and prominent syllable detection (ProsoProm) was added automatically. The corpus was also manually annotated at the syllabic level for stylistic variants, such as post-tonic schwas, liaisons, elisions, disfluencies, audible breaths and noises. Acoustic analyses (ProsoReport, DurationAnalyser) provide more than 100 micro- and macro- prosodic measures, which we correlate with the phonostylistic features and the linguistic annotation. This analysis results in a contrastive, fine-grained prosometric description of phono- stylistic and situational variation, over 4 situational, gradual dimensions: audience, media, preparation, and interactivity. Further statistical analysis was carried out to explore the discriminative and explanatory power of combinations of prosodic measures.","inCitations":["8a751611f62ccf6132fe8b1097cd80f14da60f5b","6f8e41eac8e5dbe7c60e609520ed134f2f89314e","4f64bcbaa8a7b1e465fd82c2f7ebb0a83549ce2c","94790a1c4da9ecd20941095ce48e4c5a6d8ebde2","f82c28a16ec8ff9e9f453de51857bc45e84d0986"],"pdfUrls":["https://www.isca-speech.org/archive/SpeechProsody_2014/pdfs/10.pdf"],"title":"Speaking style prosodic variation : an 8-hours 9-style corpus study","doi":"10.21437/speechprosody.2014-9","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.21437/speechprosody.2014-9","venue":""}
