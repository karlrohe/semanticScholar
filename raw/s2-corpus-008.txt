The analysis allows one to measure the degree of non-uniqueness between the potential and the radial distribution functions g(r), in the case of pairwise but not purely site–site interactions. The g(r) obtained from MD simulations are used as ‘experimental’ input data in the RMC procedure and the constraint of rigid molecules is imposed. The particle configurations produced by RMC are then studied by using a recently proposed general method for analysing the localorder in liquids. The same analysis applied to the particle configurations produced by the conventional MD simulation yields a set of partial distribution functions which relates the main features of the g(r) to microscopic pair geometries. A comparison of the partial g(r) shows that the three-dimensional structures produced by the MD and RMC simulations differ significantly.In ot...","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"The reverse Monte Carlo technique applied to fluids of diatomic molecules","doi":"10.1080/00268979650026460","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1080/00268979650026460","venue":""}

They provide a unique brain-machine interface (BMI) for interacting with a growing number of applications. EEG devices interface with computational systems requiring access control. These controls rely on a number of authenticators, including “what you know”, “what you have”, and “what you are”. The “what you are” authenticator, formally known as a biometrics authenticator, is increasingly gaining acceptance. An emerging approach in physiological biometrics is cognitive biometrics, which measures brain's response to stimuli. These stimuli can be measured by a number of devices, including EEG systems. This work shows an approach to authenticate users interacting with their computational devices through the use of EEG devices. The results demonstrate the feasibility of using a unique hard-to-forge trait as an absolute biometrics authenticator by exploiting the signals generated by different areas of the brain when exposed to visual stimuli. The outcome of this research highlights the importance of the prefrontal cortex and temporal lobes to capture unique responses to images that trigger emotional responses. Additionally, the utilization of logarithmic band power processing combined with LDA as the machine learning algorithm provides higher accuracy when compared against common spatial patterns or windowed means processing in combination with GMM and SVM machine learning algorithms.","inCitations":["0b683204439e75be6f95ff97d377d3723896a607"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Electroencephalogram (EEG) based authentication leveraging visual evoked potentials (VEP) resulting from exposure to emotionally significant images","doi":"10.1109/THS.2016.7568908","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/THS.2016.7568908","venue":"2016 IEEE Symposium on Technologies for Homeland Security (HST)"}

In this study, soil contaminated by mechanical oil was repaired by domestication and inoculation of microorganisms collected from the contaminated site, and soil quality and plant growth indexes were evaluated to verify the efficacy of our solvent extraction–indigenous microbial degradation technology. Solvent extraction of the contaminated soil removed 97.03% mechanical oil, increased soil water-holding capacity by 68.20%, and improved root activity and soluble sugar content of alfalfa plants. However, solvent extraction depleted 82.98% of the soil organic matter. Screening and domestication of strain TB-6 from the contaminated site revealed that it is an Enterobacter with obvious degradation effects on petroleum hydrocarbons (C15–C28). After the solvent-extracted soil was inoculated with TB-6 for 30 days, the soil structure became loose; degradation rate of residual mechanical oil was 19.45%; and soil organic matter content, water-holding capacity, alfalfa root activity, and soluble sugar content increased by 35.00%, 9.01%, 44.60%, and 7.03%, respectively. These results indicate that TB-6 has a good repairing effect on the soil after solvent extraction, and the combined technology efficiently removed mechanical oil from the soil and reduced the damage caused by the solvent.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Use of solvent extraction–indigenous microbial degradation technology to repair soils contaminated by high concentrations of mechanical oil","doi":"10.1101/664490","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1101/664490","venue":""}

Unlike many groups, no endemic foraminiferal species have been reported from methane seeps, and to our knowledge, genetic data are currently sparse for Pacific deep-sea foraminifera. In an effort to understand the relationships between seep and non-seep populations of the deep-sea foraminifera Cibicidoides wuellerstorfi, a common paleo-indicator species, specimens from methane seeps in the Pacific were analyzed and compared to one another for genetic similarities of small subunit rDNA (SSU rDNA) sequences. Pacific Ocean C. wuellerstorfi were also compared to those collected from other localities around the world (based on 18S gene available on Genbank, e.g., Schweizer et al., 2009). Results from this study revealed that C. wuellerstorfi living in seeps near Costa Rica and Hydrate Ridge are genetically similar to one another at the species level. Individuals collected from the same location that display opposite coiling directions (dextral and sinstral) had no species level genetic differences. Comparisons of specimens with genetic information available from Genbank (SSU rDNA) showed that Pacific individuals, collected for this study, are genetically similar to those previously analyzed from the North Atlantic and Antarctic. These observations provide strong evidence for the true cosmopolitan nature of C. wuellerstorfi and highlight the importance of understanding how these microscopic organisms are able to maintain sufficient genetic exchange to remain within the same species between seep and non-seep habitats and over global distances.","inCitations":["bdfeccd90b9ea69fa610991edc662420b0a5585c","77db8f5626a013661c812fb0ab7675c4a02d4ae8"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Phylogenetic placement of Cibicidoides wuellerstorfi (Schwager, 1866) from methane seeps and non-seep habitats on the Pacific margin.","doi":"10.1111/gbi.12118","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1111/gbi.12118","venue":"Geobiology"}

With respect to their learning strategies, according to the Kolb’s Test, we determined some students who seem to learn more through the use of passive and theoretical learning strategies instead of more flexible and dynamic methodologies. According to the Holland’s Test, they seem to have chosen the correct career, except in Agricultural and Forestry Sciences, in which they seem to get to the university without a clear vocation.

Diese beiden sind für das Studium des toten Raumes die geeignetsten. Andere Reaktionen, wie die von Adolf v.

The late Pleistocene through early Holocene channel is characterized by a meander or braided system with lateral cutting and backfilling, resulting in the valley-wide deposition of massive to cross-bedded, fine-to-medium textured sand. The late Pleistocene–early Holocene floodplain is also the sand source for the adjacent Bolson sand sheet. The sand sheet stopped accumulating new sand 5000 yrs ago, an event directly related to the shutting off of the sand supply caused by the deposition of overbank muds that covered and sealed the floodplain surface. During the middle Holocene, the river may have dried intermittently with the floodplain becoming deflated and local sand dunes forming on the floodplain. After 5000 yrs the climate was less arid and the river shifted to a regime of increased flooding and overbank deposition of silt and clay. By 2500 yrs, a late Holocene period of wet climate resulted in further overbank deposition and the formation of a cumulic Mollisol across the floodplain, the Socorro paleosol. The period of wet climate corresponds to the Audubon Neoglacial and active rock glaciers in the southern Rocky Mountains, speleothem growth in nearby caves, and other evidence for wet-cool conditions in the region. After 1000 yrs, the climate became drier, and the deposition and accumulation of overbank muds by the flooding Rio Grande came to a halt. Even though the river has flooded often in historic times, and presumably during late prehistoric times as well, there is little evidence for deposition of overbank sediments on the floodplain since A.D. 1000. Accordingly, the present-day surface of the Lower Valley is ten centuries old. Three channels occur on the US side of the Lower Valley floodplain, and during the past 2500 yrs stream flow has shifted from one to the other by the avulsion process of channel reoccupation, although most flow has been in the Rio Grande channel, the largest of the three.","inCitations":["55524dd9f9bb6f0ab9fe535042a27fffec9330c9","a6c2dc0c9c78ca8466472187cdda7c612ed7aa07"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Floodplain construction of the Rio Grande at El Paso, Texas, USA: response to Holocene climate change","doi":"10.1016/j.quascirev.2012.11.013","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.quascirev.2012.11.013","venue":""}

Data from 162 patients enrolled in a community-based incidence study of PD were used to estimate health state utility values. Self-report data from the EQ-5D, a generic measure of HRQL, were used to derive preference-based health state utility values. The impact of motor and non motor symptoms, and other clinical and demographic factors, on the derived EQ-5D health state values was examined in univariate and multivariate analyses. The mean health state utility value for recently diagnosed PD patients was estimated at 0.65 ± 0.27. Significant reductions in health state values were attributable to pain (−0.18), motor functioning (−0.16), depression (−0.12), and insomnia (−0.11). Depression had its greatest impact (−0.19) in patients in the less severe stages of PD (i.e. Hoehn Yahr stages ≤2.5). This study shows, through the presentation of QALY values, that there is scope to achieve significant health gains in newly diagnosed idiopathic PD patients via improved management of pain, depression and insomnia, alongside the treatment of primary motor symptoms.","inCitations":["51501cac0c4dcf1f97597eb93712537c8a6737eb","1a7895d1428b1880b58c176d20e7ea621fd94328","c3bba2f7fdbfa177b151f8fd9f74b9248181e049","c34b21bf45f152519d574e6c86c0132d41609d6e","07721cf52e6226343fe222e402c03b7c594ba5d2","88400ba993df2fdd44811bd16c0133c4a96958cd","18c24254bb45fdf28154c81a4fff344b9ebf23f5","f0494866e07a4b71128033adca98c25a6d62d19f","502290b95755d5077e5b95ec076724c3728074c7","a0caa274edfd918e7c49fd93e6e805661cc2adec","3966ef85e1a5ddca9ca8ae3c9809d65b69bf4599","b13e6fa1fa403cbe2e6558f96e133151d2e8223d","32113c29b24b0195666b2b1f19f8334b6489798e","e45cf9af25b1d42db32572083a021740d1504034","b5e23643d7fcc3296b4b2b1a891e09ffee360bfd","99d74fabf206dd7f30ff6b0f4f78d55e06ce89eb","76bcffc01ab547cbedf285b29c206e07d5e19fe0","f3e412b1f014fa2d37865586cd827fda14d022ea","eece73c620ec94ba8a057ec2d79b3e669387564c","9f51203ce6c05a5b8dcdbf5fb1f0caa0d7d0f14f","b9f032209c56a18fe143655e37245718b34075b8","34902f310a204b45555955a6f2e8591c441af8ed","fad4a6ad30af89bbfe8aebcc169b08a05a7d9e89","0b188cf1e4c493bc38b3828217f80e6509a86032","4aa832e99bf102703081272de2a455f1ca2baf75","192d576f866ff42dde1f31548fc748ef85171061"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"The impact of motor and non motor symptoms on health state values in newly diagnosed idiopathic Parkinson’s disease","doi":"10.1007/s00415-011-6202-y","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00415-011-6202-y","venue":"Journal of Neurology"}

Therefore, the number of mortality caused by HIV/AIDS is increasing. The use of ARV and development of HIV/AIDS management are expected to suppress the progress of HIV infection into AIDS and, therefore, the mortality can be diminished, while in fact most of the patients eventually suffer from AIDS due to secondary infection that commonly causes death. There should be a management by analysing microorganisms that trigger secondary infection. The method of this study was observational descriptive with cross sectional design. HIV infected blood samples were using ELISA Antibody (IgG and IgM) and Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) on laboratory test. The result showed correlation between HIV/AIDS severity and the amount and types of secondary infection. The most common secondary infections were toxoplasm (96.77%), hepatitis C (22.58%), tuberculosis (19.35%), and hepatitis B (3.22%). Other less frequent secondary infections, which were quite difficult to diagnose and not commonly found in Indonesia, were West Nile Virus (25.81%), Japanese Encephalitis Virus (3.22%), and Enterovirus (3.22%). Due to MDGs (Millenium Development Goals) target and the results above, researchers are highly demanded to contribute in decreasing mortality related to AIDS through early detection of secondary infection,including type of infection which have not been commonly found in Indonesia, such as West Nile Virus and Nipah Virus. The discovery of secondary infection in this study was not enough to suppress the occurrence of infection in HIV/AIDS patients. Antimicrobes and good nutrition are required. Moreover, there should be either a primary or secondary prophylaxis to prevent secondary infection that raises the number of mortality and morbidity of HIV/AIDS patients. The result of this study was to meet the target of MDGs by establishing new policies in handling HIV/AIDS infections and have potential as model for policy control in HIV/AIDS.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://e-journal.unair.ac.id/IJTID/article/download/2016/1654","http://repository.unair.ac.id/85302/4/10ANAL1.PDF"],"title":"Analysi S on Secondary I Nfecti On- Tri Ggeri Ng Microorganisms in Hiv/aids Patients as a Model for Policy Control","doi":"10.20473/ijtid.v5i4.2016","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.20473/ijtid.v5i4.2016","venue":""}

As in most countries of Europe the industrial workers in Scandinavia Denmark, Finland, Norway, and Sweden have since the Second World War a right to be represented on committees at the plant level. These committees have somewhat different names in these countries, viz. committee of cooperation (samarbejdsudvalg, Denmark), production committee (tuotantokomitea, produksjonsutvalg, Finland, Norway), enterprise council (f6retagsnamnd, Sweden) but their structures and functions differ only slightly from each other. Consequently, they are here treated together and called plant committees. The present plant committees were established either through agreements between the employers' national federations and the trade union federations (Norway 1945, Sweden 1946, Denmark 1947) or by a special law (Finland 1946) which decreed such plant committees compulsory in plants having more than 25 (Denmark, Sweden) or 50 (Finland, Norway) employees. Depending on the size of the plant there are 6 to 12 members in the committees, one half of these being elected by all workers or workers who are trade union members, as in Sweden the other half representing clerical staff and management. Whilst the functions of these plant committees have been defined in slightly different ways, their actual functions are practically the same in all these countries. They can be summed up as follows: 1) communication between management and workers; 2) cooperation between management and workers for higher productivity; 3) discussion on workers' safety and welfare; and 4) discussion on schooling and training of workers and apprentices. Wages and hours of work are, as a rule, excluded from the competence of these committees. All plant committees are consultative in nature. The minimum number of meetings is prescribed by agreements or law.

Carrying capacity as a planning concept for national parks: available of desirable capacity? Landscape Plann., 2: 243–247. Planning inevitably requires an initial consideration of all the effects of each alternative as well as a detailed consideration of the main effects of each. Useful planning procedures must therefore meet three criteria — at least. First, they must promote the consideration of all the effects. Second, they must provide an objective method to distinguish the main effects from the less important effects. Third, they must promote consideration of tradeoffs between gains in some effects and losses in others. The recent paper by Ovington et al. (1974) in this journal suggested the use of tourist carrying capacity as a planning concept. A review of this concept against these three criteria suggests that it meets the first criterion, but could usefully be extended to meet the other two.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Carrying capacity as a planning concept for national parks: Available or desirable capacity?","doi":"10.1016/0304-3924(75)90029-5","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/0304-3924%2875%2990029-5","venue":""}

Cows calved January through March and calves were weaned in October in each of the 5 yr of the experiment. Cows grazing fescue-legume consumed 1.7 kg/d more (P less than .01) dry matter (DM) that was 4.6 percentage units more (P less than .01) digestible than cows grazing fescue. Cows grazing fescue-legume produced .4 kg/d more (P less than .01) milk and weaned 23.8 kg more (P less than .01) calf than cows grazing fescue. This increased production required an additional intake/cow-calf unit of 2.3 kg of digestible DM for each additional kilogram of calf weaned. Cows grazing fescue-legume were less efficient in calf production at least partially because they gained 33.3 kg more (P less than .01) weight and 1.82 mm more (P less than .01) fat cover at the 12th rib during lactation than cows grazing fescue. Cows producing relatively large amounts of milk consumed more digestible DM, weaned heavier calves, and were more efficient producers of milk and weaned calf regardless of pasture type grazed. The influence of milk production on these variables was more dramatic for cows grazing fescue than for those grazing fescue-legume. Cow type favoring maximum conversion of digestible DM intake by cow and calf to calf gain was different for the two types of pasture. For cows grazing fescue, those having either small amounts of fatness or having small structural sizes, regardless of milk production, were the most efficient. Structural size was not related to efficiency for cows grazing fescue-legume. Fatness had little influence on efficiency of low milking cows. The relationship of structural dimension and efficiency for cows grazing fescue was due to interrelationships of structural dimension, change in cow weight and fatness during lactation, and calf weaning weight: cow weight ratio. Relationships between efficiency and fatness could not be attributed to these variables.","inCitations":["9f28ecaaf6f68e986d59a823529e99ed64ebdf03","1c10d6d0bbd1541705664407414040ec9febda53","cffa568fe1df000d7e2337f98cf14bc126ec0c21","7c6d1316b3783dcd43178ff00615e73c556dd08b"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Phenotype x nutritional environment interactions in forage intake and efficiency of Angus cows grazing fescue-legume or fescue pastures.","doi":"10.2527/jas1983.564960x","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.2527/jas1983.564960x","venue":"Journal of animal science"}

After a description of the main types of elements, their life and death within a species, including regulation of transposition, and their distribution in natural populations and on chromosomes are discused. The impact of TEs on the host genomes, the putative relationship between environment and transposition rates lead to a discussion of the interaction (or co-evolution) between TEs and their host. These results introduce the analysis of the phylogenies of TEs and their interpretations according to different models, for example, horizontal versus vertical transmission.

In chicken, a second epithelial layer, the subperiderm, located underneath the periderm develops in later embryogenesis. Together the periderm and the subperiderm are referred to as the PSP unit. The cells of the PSP unit are tightly connected by tight junctions (TJ), thereby providing the embryo with an impermeable bilayered diffusion barrier. The emerging epidermis assumes its barrier function by cornification beginning at embryonic day 17 (E17) before at E18 the PSP unit undergoes desquamation. Lipid analysis of both epithelia after their mechanical separation revealed a dramatic increase to about 100-fold values of barrier-relevant ceramides, i.e. those known to essentially contribute to the diffusion barrier of the cornified envelope, in the emerging epidermis between E17 and E19. In contrast, the content of barrier-relevant ceramides in the PSP unit remained at constantly low levels throughout embryogenesis. These data strongly argue in favour of different mechanisms for the barrier function of the two epithelia. TJ in the PSP unit provide the main diffusion barrier protecting the embryo until beginning of desquamation at E18. At this developmental stage the content of cornified envelope-specific ceramides is substantially elevated, thus enabling the epidermis to fulfil its function as the major diffusion barrier after desquamation of the PSP unit. The observation that barrier-relevant ceramides are formed prior to desquamation of the PSP unit points to a precisely regulated sequence in that desquamation does not occur until the lipid-based barrier of the cornified envelope is completed and suggests in addition that these lipids might be essential regulators of the interaction between the PSP unit and the emerging epidermis.","inCitations":["2f449979ebe206dbbfac40a02d98a2be483f7c04"],"pdfUrls":["https://www.zellbiologie.uni-bonn.de/arbeitsgruppen-1/prof.%20herzog/124.-van-echten-deckert-et-al.-epidermis-during-chicken-embyogenesis.pdf"],"title":"Specific distribution of barrier-relevant ceramides in the emerging epidermis and the periderm/subperiderm during chicken embryogenesis.","doi":"10.1016/j.ejcb.2007.01.004","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejcb.2007.01.004","venue":"European journal of cell biology"}

Since its inception, a variety of new testing techniques and numerical schemes have been developed to improve the efficiency and accuracy of the method. The main objective of this paper is to present the pseudodynamic test method from a user's perspective. With this objective in mind, an overview of the pseudodynamic test method is provided. Some of the most up‐to‐date developments, including substructure testing techniques, are illustrated with test examples. It is shown that while the method is definitely more complicated than conventional quasi‐static tests, it can be implemented and applied to structural research with a small incremental cost.","inCitations":["333c9748ca06457893c4934c19729c9afa8a3013","d4989498445da038c7c596415ffb3d4bf6079f8a","eb0b659f336a99aba18d68327cfc88674cd58d03","7264dc40c73498abd943a6c549b5075f0d0f52de","421e35f3cd7ec8bbff70327d8cf8b7a832005092","8eb07b0002523753961f535b7e6cd3c47b580c85","b6b9d80f3e316234596af232325ff78e0f92d878","cbe8d7e04d92f5082deb042b29eb804d5e8f4dbe","2e56c986887973134742bf122109feafdbd5a306","eef41ee475fa0eec9eb53035dc06b0376f883300","9808a7fcad98d1f6e9b924268d9adb72a6e19a98","e25b41d07fe2f1fe0efb6bd01fbad009b64c0da2","dab4560956d8ec5ef219f1036f382d372515e7d9","6246f95cb0b37e9b3a808c8d6298b64846c65cab","a66bae4d280007f314b85d521b0922641d77d5f0","f38038fea1162936721bf389fcb49a8ea0109d6f","2d19e80aea6874aa10c1a11d4e0f1e26c4a83a4b","af4320878a42c31516dca15ed8b3a374e79713d0","be0fe43280e585a6cfce81a49879b967649e5ee3","ff58c293c666e1a66946fee1b6cee3493a8599fe","73f3bec2e0cb02c9851d75b34ae6aaa99b00fea2","3709b4a0ab57f6c76f45cfff66c376f85bdd555c","f7bd81df1fe30ddb964352ae7e81713b15ba4005","1a38a45c9a241f99d83d161a88c8b5582dfcc758","30b3de8c2bf1e80483fe95c3ee159fdac39067cb","657fccf8804d5b5544279eb8ea2ac9ca6ddef1e7","48f3fec1c299d25464b695616564e4579ccb1242","c8af6bc4a1fa308096003c847057068b2b0792d1","ef994384ffc859ac43ed8194b3ab54e7c7c4faf8","2b5ba77d1e8fc9ec882bcf1bc11de44ba08137af","8e4f72dac352b7bdd10e4fca6b7c5372228a4d56","6d441785a641cc5e89d789789fb40406e1eb01e9","bb827589fa86c45791e1b134c77954038a8a91e9","04da3baf5ade3b875ee484ecc487f875242e568f","e84e176a21e8bb9508a25a32c52d6227f3ff64d1","cec43578b73eccd12c26d18c2b04164c6d9812b3","867b8daa1d3fab2bf526a0916f4ce2d50cdf6d6c","8a26c793580498055dad5a9b61a2efe408a58a5a","6562ea0358360a31e2038c9509614a1ccea1a6c2","b927f5c3cee4687ab71fc60ffb1cf008a625f25f","7d0cc8d73f031c7795d78965987855f4b70a0d0d","141ac42434bdbf324124c06cd4e2813200f5b0b4","fd0d43c6d93a8be87c665cc2ced8184375fc7888","ea65bc1c95dbb169390e21de20eddafc420d2976","b080e0f216f0896d2a6cdfc7e812df52524c6476","de83e9a17d810b47009670044848001d01f5a002","64212fdaf7bf7f4fd40295f6b90b3f8a10c5fddd","ec3bdae9ee600919305dc4c272bed984e70075a0","c3fc0ff9dbf8fed33b5cb4d5262164027ef8c15e","126e635cc06b83e88b00083e048cb8ba92da6a66","d46b8e46c0ff2a80cd9e68e9144c24008e7f1152","64a0d53a59ddac8a4a8e1a64b6818e8e6edbea4a","ad258b639e937ea0a7de24725fac29c1026de937","7fb14f35ace68a535f906e786f2351fc58b75904","377e2bd79a7a2cbe2648a6f5feee744ec60ab450","a8f500b90c29a2371afb9c472fb12168b3e43e22","3e58a197aae921c6b18d1c91b7285921adcd80b8","6b14d1607367562e7ff472f1db3b49b9c1bbb3da","7cb5e8eef06963768b8b07cdaa0c3853ca06515b","9beaa68b3b1a41bf1e4926588177d97144ffd106","02a14ffb8dd661b01d9660926111094274f2e4d8","5734759ac1ac08df86f8c887474ba22fb7602508","26cc16dd04854141d2881a514325a0e85dff0797"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Application of Pseudodynamic Test Method to Structural Research","doi":"10.1193/1.1585867","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1193/1.1585867","venue":""}

It is not known whether recent advances in care have affected the rates of chronic infection. We aimed to determine if the rates of developing new chronic P. aeruginosa infection among adolescents and adults with CF significantly changed over time.\n\n\nMethods\nThe cohort consisted of individuals with CF followed in the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Patient Registry aged ≥13 years without chronic P. aeruginosa at baseline. Multivariable regression models accounting for within-patient correlation were used to assess the change in rate of developing chronic P. aeruginosa infection between 2003 and 2012.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 15504 individuals were followed for a median of 5 (interquartile range, 2-9) years. The annual rates of developing new chronic P. aeruginosa decreased from 14.3% in 2003 to 6.4% in 2012. After adjusting for potential confounders, relative risk (RR) of developing chronic P. aeruginosa infection decreased significantly over time compared to 2003 (P value test of trend < .001). Compared with 2003, the RR of developing chronic P. aeruginosa infection in 2012 was 0.33 (95% confidence interval, 0.30-0.37). No significant increases in risk of chronic infections with other major CF bacterial pathogens relative to 2003 were identified.\n\n\nConclusions\nAmong individuals with CF, a significant decrease in the risk and rates of developing chronic P. aeruginosa infection between 2003 and 2012 was observed. Whether this decline results in changes in clinical outcomes warrants further exploration.","inCitations":["2eef93563e6d9b1a73fca439c3a07f30b08ebf4e","f2dd67b772de2fa4c5ea73b53a2e902c7c75b66d","81a6ed51c2516ef00fcb4eb624c1b6405c482bb5","5bb72b40f05bc15dac4bcb573dbe61e9e5c0b9b1","daf73fe07f63a2d5c45dfc6ab9087ba3ed553340"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Changing Rates of Chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa Infections in Cystic Fibrosis: A Population-Based Cohort Study","doi":"10.1093/cid/ciy215","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1093/cid%2Fciy215","venue":"Clinical infectious diseases : an official publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America"}

The volume change associated with the phase transition caused the crystals to shatter. Single crystals gave a single extremely sharp endotherm in the DSC thermal curves obtained but different crystals gave significantly different transition temperatures over at least 5°C range (≈61 to ≈66°C). Multiple crystals gave multiple peaks within the same DSC experiment even when cleaved from the same single crystal. Polycrystalline samples produced DSC thermal curves which were much broader and the transition temperature appeared to increase with a decrease in particle size. On average, small crystals (≈38 μm) had a transition temperature (76°C) about 13°C higher than large crystals (≈63°C). The enthalpy of transition of the small crystals was about 500 J mol −1 lower and the entropy of transition was 0.3 R lower than the large crystals. These investigations suggest that the thermodynamic properties vary with the particle properties which are dependent on particle size and particle size changes occurring with thermal cycling.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Polymorphism of phenethylammonium bromide : the effect of particle properties on the thermodynamics","doi":"10.1016/0040-6031(93)80502-2","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/0040-6031%2893%2980502-2","venue":""}

For each defensive strategy, its effectiveness is validated, and its side-channel resistance is evaluated by the TVLA general tests. The correlation power analysis exploits the vulnerabilities in productscanning-based polynomial multiplications. The statistical analysis program in C++ takes time linear in the input size on average and practically less than 8 seconds on an ordinary laptop to reveal all the coefficients of each private-key polynomial. The three countermeasures together demonstrate the tradeoff between security and performance. The predictions about their effectiveness, performance, and side-channel resistance are supported by the correlation power analysis and the TVLA general tests based on thousands of traces.","inCitations":["993bf9792ae8db5e5a8406e6fb9c851ebfd94974","e49ce4a6fec24fba2dd39195cf39c089f8a7d88f","da4a9c91cfc6fc7afc0de03ccb4f83e481bffe6e","f2c42f8a4098554fc468b3b9cb6cef9c0697c826"],"pdfUrls":["https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/100.pdf","https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/100"],"title":"Correlation Power Analysis on NTRU Prime and Related Countermeasures","doi":"","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"IACR Cryptology ePrint Archive"}

Although facilitation theory presents new possibilities for the restoration of heavily degraded mangrove sites, knowledge of tree–tree interactions in stressed mangrove forest ecosystems is too limited to utilize facilitation appropriately. The aim was to determine the mode of local interaction among stressed mangrove trees by investigating the effect of clustering on tree size and crown morphology under contrasting stand densities. The study was conducted in a dwarf Avicennia germinans forest in Northern Brazil, in which tree growth is limited by infrequent inundation and high pore-water salinity. Autoregressive regression, Voronoi tessellation and spatial point pattern statistics were used to address the spatial processes underlying tree interaction. Under low stand density (1.2 trees m−2) dwarf trees which grew in clustered cohorts of A. germinans had a less stunted crown morphology revealing the dominance of a positive neighborhood influence among plants. In contrast, dwarf trees in the denser forest stand (2.7 trees m−2) were interacting competitively as indicated by the more negative effect of neighbors on crown morphology and size. The shift from facilitative to competitive interactions is an important feature of mangrove forest regeneration under harsh environmental conditions. If mangrove trees are unable to regenerate naturally on severely degraded sites, intraspecific facilitation could be used to assist regeneration by planting seedlings in clusters and not evenly spaced.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Density-dependent shift from facilitation to competition in a dwarf Avicennia germinans forest","doi":"10.1007/s11273-017-9561-z","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11273-017-9561-z","venue":"Wetlands Ecology and Management"}

The main study hypothesis assumes different patterns of creating candidate lists in EP elections in comparison to parliamentary elections, involving the combined occurrence of several determinants. The first of them is the tendency to fill the highest positions in candidate lists with popular people well-known in the media, who have an advantage over anonymous ones. The second factor is territorial bonds connecting candidates with the electoral district where they stand for election. Another determinant taken into consideration is the territorial form of the candidate list. The last important element of analysis is the concentration of support, determined by the position on the candidate list.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Candidate Selection in the 2014 European Parliament Election in Poland","doi":"10.6084/m9.figshare.1282353","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.1282353","venue":""}

Currently, the University of Brasília (UnB) owns and operate a WLAN (Wireless Local Area Network) infrastructure to serve users of its campuses. Through this infrastructure, UnB is seeking alternatives to better serve its users, preferably without increasing its costs. An alternative is the implementation of voice over the wireless network of the Institution, where users utilize their mobile devices for communication while providing mobility. When using voice over wireless networks, parameters such as delay, delay variation and packet loss must comply with the recommendations for reasonable phone calls quality. Furthermore, providing mobility in IEEE 802.11 networks involves the transition of the mobile user between access points and this very process is one of the key factors of voice quality degradation. The UNB wireless networking solution encompasses technologies such as ClientMatch, IEEE 802.11r and 802.11k standards that assist the mobile user in the transition process. In this context, this work evaluates the impact of the ClientMatch technology, IEEE 802.11r and 802.11k standards in supporting mobility and voice traffic, while evaluating the audio quality, performance of the main QoS (Quality of Service) parameters in a VoIP network (Voice over IP). The conducted experiments showed that the ClientMatch – Sticky Client technology is not tailored for mobility support, presenting low rate of action, while the IEEE 802.11r and 802.11k technologies have not produced the expected results. Even with the low rates of operation of ClientMatch – Sticky Client technology and unexpected results of the solutions 802.11k and 802.11r, the UnB WLAN infrastructure provided good performance for voice traffic, even under moderate mobility, attaining acceptable levels of voice quality; nevertheless, the process of transition between access points, ClientMatch – Band Steering and the distance between access points may impact in the results. In addition to the experiments that seek to evaluate the impact of technology ClientMatch and IEEE 802.11r and 802.11k standards in supporting mobility and voice traffic, tests were performed with CODECs (Coder Decoder) by mobility of mobile client. The encoder – decoder G711 showed the best results in the experiments performed with respect to the voice quality.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://repositorio.unb.br/bitstream/10482/19389/1/2015_ClaudioXavierOliveira.pdf"],"title":"Avaliação das tecnologias ClientMatch e dos padrões IEEE 802.11k e 802.11r no suporte a mobilidade e tráfego de tempo real em redes WLAN","doi":"10.26512/2015.10.D.19389","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.26512/2015.10.D.19389","venue":""}

Mas de 40 estudios y diversos metaanalisis avalan la eficacia de estas intervenciones, cuya rentabilidad superaria a cualquier otra intervencion en el medio inespecifico. Aunque su efectividad (resultados en condiciones naturales) y generalizacion no son tan evidentes como su eficacia en condiciones experimentales, su potencial repercusion sobre la Salud Publica hace que profesionales y autoridades sanitarias se esfuercen en su difusion y promocion. Pero, ?nos hallamos ante una panacea? La diversidad de intervenciones agrupadas bajo el comun denominador de intervenciones breves y la disparidad de estudios, a menudo dificilmente comparables, obligan a una revision critica que cuestione tambien su validez. Se concluye que la intervencion breve es en conjunto eficaz, efectiva y eficiente, sobre todo en Atencion Primaria de Salud, aunque no todas las intervenciones son igualmente eficaces. La ampliacion del espectro terapeutico, aplicando intervenciones mas sencillas a los bebedores de riesgo, no deberia hacerse en detrimento de recursos especificos mas complejos para los alcohol-dependientes. Por lo que respecta a la intervencion breve propiamente dicha, debe seguirse investigando su aplicacion optima: que ingredientes, duracion y extension, en que medio, a cargo de que profesional, para que paciente.","inCitations":["0ad7b836f6f516276f30e2dee17202b77f12558e","f0033f1dd108896a41f2440fa44255a7a5344856","ef1039c43b48a6f7b12fe1bd26ea4070861b9950","ce471517104598f0dd2fd008a576f150d569ec41","6d43d4876bbd5d4707b670c85b3aece44c0e9f93","fa2e1eacc1c07ec7cbcf1426f83532b5155d977d"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.adicciones.es/index.php/adicciones/article/download/532/524"],"title":"Efectividad de las técnicas de consejo breve","doi":"10.20882/adicciones.532","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.20882/adicciones.532","venue":""}

An endonuclease specific for ultraviolet-irradiated DNA has been purified about 750-fold from a crude extract of Micrococcus lysodeikticus using phase partition, TEAE-cellulose and phosphocellulose column chromatography, and isoelectric focusing. 2. 2. Isoelectric focusing resulted in separation of the endonuclease activity into two discrete fractions (pI = 4.8 and 9.0, respectively). These two fractions are also distinguishable from each other in chromatographic behavior. The relation between the two fractions is not clear at present. 3. 3. The enzyme attacks ultraviolet-irradiated double- or single-stranded DNA in an endonucleolytic manner, but not non-irradiated DNA. With double-stranded substrates it induces only single-strand breaks. It is active in the presence of EDTA and no stimulation by Mg2+ is observed under the conditions employed here. Acriflavine does not inhibit the enzyme at a concentration of 1 μg/ml, but partially does at 10 μg/ml. It is likely that a break is introduced in the vicinity of every pyrimidine dimer formed by ultraviolet irradiation. Molecular weight of the enzyme was estimated to be approx. 13000–14000. 4. 4. Evidence is presented suggesting that an endonuclease activity against methylmethane sulfonate-treated DNA found in a crude extract of this organism may be attributable to another class of enzyme different from the endonuclease active on ultraviolet-irradiated DNA.","inCitations":["fe62b3265d590feda282786debf75c140fc0e52e"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Repair of ultraviolet-damaged DNA in Micrococcus lysodeikticus.

We describe a new technique that circumvents these difficulties.\n\n\nMETHODS\nBetween April 2001 and April 2004, a total of 113 recipients were scheduled for PTx with PED. The superior mesenteric vein was approached from the right retroperitoneal aspect instead of from the anterior transmesenteric route. The pancreas graft was eventually placed in the right retroperitoneal space, being covered by the ascending colon and its mesentery.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOne hundred ten (97.3%) PTx were performed as planned. Systemic venous effluent was preferred in three patients because of incidental diagnosis of liver cirrhosis during surgery (n=1) and severe obesity (body mass index>35 kg/m2) (n=2). The Y iliac artery graft was kept as short as possible, and arterial anastomosis was always performed with ease. After a mean follow-up period of 21.2+/-19.9 months, the relaparotomy rate was 13.6%. No patient died after repeat surgery, and none required multiple relaparotomies. Overall, 10 grafts were lost because of acute rejection (n=3), chronic rejection (n=2), venous thrombosis (n=2), recipient death (n=2), and late (6-month) arterial thrombosis (n=1). One-year patient and graft survival were 98.1% and 90.7%, respectively.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nOur data confirm that PTx with PED is not associated with an increased risk. The technique described has distinctive technical advantages and should be included in the repertoire of PTx.","inCitations":["b83e3f335b07e25d887783ef93cc24e279f56124","089c8d897493de245095fc011c4aea5f4d5bd687","209d1b7fe8bce7e0d6b490b55f5b8e6987d93883","935a12df4f8f341a5ab557f7f331a1560586a06b","17725fc68cd42729766160895d8635a952c1dd84","f74704bbba7f3613ed2b55952c8a840e22e2a828","e3014241f625c5cd1224934a498f963b2f819aa5","b37586691723f92ab96c6f74a9c0f33089fd2e89","9a6274b615e0343c18b69c9c3a4ff07780362e38","59284d8db61ac84f73b00c23bb9e105a8f83dedf","a4eea5f0fc0bd6fcf4d75f8648221ac827ad41ef","aabc0560b4be5c1685016d9513117b6ded44e832","2f0d064c041e55e60aa69d9af2880cdd07b7613a","7cd90c8afb7782b6a898ba0e2af2a073d65d18c5","a2eec51d7504233c3e3e6b10c696b94e4da81d90","223e44b12678623360211f0f0c8d71290e0f4d04","34734a2a5c7dbb6c1e6ef13907b6bbb167db6bc8","47821dc2f82445cbfc89428f1faa4e4fa9468504","f4ab6d6e4450b8affae2567bccdcffe4c90be752","c420b722ac816b81a8ab981173032a57c01dbe45","fa3d49383fad628c44bf732eba447250f7b2c862","5565c6f735961fe26df9f6717dd2618acae20f1a","25e30ac1a38c24a34cdf6247acce521920fb486a","874cf490e30a0a368b5011d3c88f06b4b4124152","0e4e9a28321aaf02518c1ef66529be251ba48866","2d5069526b2c0c27788e3fed9802e3de3f05aeef","deb12390ed255598242616e65537154df85943ff","444960ecdaeff0e9cfe895fdf551e8d58fc42f89"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"A technique for retroperitoneal pancreas transplantation with portal-enteric drainage.","doi":"10.1097/01.TP.0000157279.39764.CC","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1097/01.TP.0000157279.39764.CC","venue":"Transplantation"}
