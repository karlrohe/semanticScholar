Patients are fasting for at least twelve hours and tests are started early in the morning. 5 mCi of 99mTc-Hepatobida are injected intravenously. Thereupon gastric juice is collected by means of a gastric tube every ten min during 90 min. Duodenogastric reflux is provoked by installing 100 ml of Intralipid. Sampling of gastric contents is continued as above. Radioactivities in the aspirate are compared in five patients before operation, after truncal vagotomy with pyloroplasty, after highly selective vagotomy without pyloroplasty and after highly selective vagotomy without pyloroplasty. There is no typical pattern for either type of operation. We suggest that motor antral activity is more important than pyloric function.","inCitations":["2ba363c5831702735106bb300f34a1252cffdd10"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Quantitative assessment of duodenogastric reflux after vagotomy with or without pyloroplasty-A clinical investigation.","doi":"","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"Scandinavian journal of gastroenterology.

Even if Article 51 of the UN Charter has been expanded to include acts of terrorism as armed attacks, it still does not give the right for States to act in self-defence when there is a mere threat of force. This situation would not have appeared if there would have been an explanation of the notion ´armed attack`, but interpretation of Article 51 shows that there was no intention to include anticipatory self-defence. State practice, UN documents and decisions from the International Court of Justice can all be evidence of practice and if there is opinio juris, the behaviour becomes customary international law. The United States promote for pre-emptive and preventive self-defence. Compared to anticipatory self-defence the ´Bush-doctrine` is wider and includes self-defence against general or specific armed attack that State believes will occur. The UN is of the opinion that the Security Council can authorize anticipatory self-defence if a State puts the matter to them, but the principle of non-intervention is too great to accept the legality that States can act anticipatory on their own device. There must appear an imminent threat of armed attack and the use of force in self-defence still has to be proportionate. This is in correspondence with the objects and purpose of the UN Charter. Article 2(4) of the Charter prohibits the threat or use of force and if a situation is put to the Security Council it is up to them to decide what kind of action is required to maintain international peace and security. The ICJ confirmed the criteria of proportionality as being part of customary international law in the cases of Nicaragua, Nuclear Weapons Case and Oil Platforms Case. The Nicaragua Case also stated that the words ´an armed attack occurs` speak of the actual commencement of physical violence by armed forces and separated grave use of force and less grave use of force as in the General Assembly Resolution 3314. The prominent writers agree that it is not legal for States to act anticipatory, unless the Security Council authorizes it. There is a gap between the legality and the legitimacy when force may be used. If a State act in self-defence against a threat of force or aggression that does not reach the threshold of armed attack, it is illegal if not viewed to the Security Council and given authorization.

This by itself refers to something intangible and not directly observable; but these two phenomena manage to pique the interest of both preschoolers and adults and make them form their own representations for both concepts. In this research, we studied the ideas held by the preschoolers on earthquakes, volcanoes and the creation of these two, before and after an organized teaching intervention. Also, an attempt was made to record the emotions expressed by children about the earthquakes and the protective measures they tend to adopt in such situations. The sample consisted of 63 preschool children from a public kindergarten located in the city of Patras. Ever before the teaching intervention, children had already formed some early representations for these phenomena, representations that were enriched (approaching even the scientific model) after the didactic intervention had been completed. Finally, the feelings expressed by the children throughout the study resulted from the understanding of the significance of this issue: there was a transition from the feeling of fear or panic to feelings that had more to do with staying calm and keeping their composure (in order to protect themselves) in a case of an earthquake.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Η Προσέγγιση Γεωλογικών Φαινομένων Στο Νηπιαγωγείο : Οι Ιδέες Των Παιδιών Προσχολικής Ηλικίας Για Τους Σεισμούς Και Τα Ηφαίστεια","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Coded video recordings were evaluated by a semiquantitative method. CsA infusion (1.6 +/- 0.4 mg/kg/min) induced a nearly complete inhibition of the subcapsular blood flow. At lower infusion rates (0.46 +/- 0.2 mg/kg/min), the blood flow inhibition was less pronounced. CsG infusions at corresponding rates induced significantly less inhibition. Pretreatment with a new calcium antagonist, isradipine (18-20 micrograms/kg bwt), completely prevented the CsA-induced impairment of subcapsular microcirculation. The calcium antagonist, however, did not improve blood flow when administered after induction of inhibition by CsA (16.8 +/- 2.5 mg/kg), emphasizing the importance of pretreatment. This study suggests hypoperfusion due to vasoconstriction as an important pathophysiologic mechanism for CsA-induced nephrotoxicity. CsG, when given at corresponding rates, induced less inhibition of the blood flow. Pretreatment with a calcium antagonist, isradipine, completely prevented a CsA-induced inhibition of blood flow, suggesting a potential value in the prevention of CsA-induced nephrotoxicity.","inCitations":["95660acb190b8dd6e4129018822b0957faeb822c","81bd566f3ff09d1b42b6d398191934f72389c87c","08f53cee5fac2401456690edbdc361c2820c6d39","83d23073e21198bd7b727727b64b289d97d9f2fb","0a2838aaad9ad615766684bbf0f6dae88ca31645","9ff50a22c7f706e1e46e7779e3c64cc9d7a186dd","3e35d13fb5c953632cc1c99aab265ebfdfec2399"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"In vivo fluorescence microscopy of kidney subcapsular blood flow in mice.

Statistical analysis included Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, Student´s\n t-test, ANOVA, two factorial ANOVA and Dunnets\n t-test. Significance was set at p < 0,05. Both\n combinations caused adequate depth of anaesthesia\n to allow endotracheal intubation. Animals in group\n KD lost the righting reflex three minutes earlier than in Group AD. The\n injection volume of the combination ketamine/dexmedetomidine\n was lower than with the alphaxalone/dexmedetomidine\n combination (0,9-1,1 ml vs. 3,0-4,5 ml). In both\n groups cardiovascular parameters were stable and remained in a clinically\n acceptable range. Hypoventilation caused moderate respiratory acidosis during\n isoflurane anaesthesia.\n Quality of recovery was smooth and coordinated in  group AD. Animals in group KD were\n sensitive to noise. Group KD regained the righting within 8 minutes after end\n of isoflurane supply. (9 minutes faster than group\n KD). However, group AD needed two times longer to acchieve\n sternal recumbency.. All otters of group KD could be relased\n to their exhibit on the same day. Because of reduced activity two otters of\n group AD needed further surveillance for one day. In conclusion, the combination\n of dexemdetomidine and alfaxalone\n provides an alternative to ketamine combinations\n for induction of anesthesia in Eurasian otters. However, the larger injection\n volume  and a\n possible longer recovery time to full activity has to be considered.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Untersuchung zur Praktikabilität der Anästhesieeinleitung und der Stressbelastung beim Europäischen Fischotter (Lutra lutra) mit Alphaxalon und Dexmedetomidin verglichen mit der Kombination Ketamin und Dexmedetomidin","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Over these 59 years of its existence, it has steadily grown into the largest Earth Science Association in the country with over 2000 Fellows spread across the length and breadth of this land and drawn from the Academia, Government/Public Sector laboratories, Mining and Mineral industry and from agencies concerned with the protection of our fragile environment. It has also been bringing out the Journal of the Geological Society of India in an uninterrupted fashion and on time every month, which is a no mean achievement by itself. Over the years the spectrum of activities have also appreciably broadened including shouldering some international obligations like the bringing out the quaterly Journal of the International Union of Geological Sciences (IUGS) – The Episodes – for a period of eight years, organizing the participation of the Indian School children in the annual International Earth Science Olympiads(IESO) as a part of our outreach programme to popularize earth sciences and organizing from time to time some major international events like the 10th International Kimberlite Conference in the year 2012. The Society has also been bringing together scientists from different branches by organizing seminars, symposia and workshops on selected topics of current interest to coincide with its Annual General Body Meetings as well as on other occasions. Short term courses offered by national and international experts have also been attracting wide participation and recognition under the auspices of the Society. All this has been achieved primarily due to the commitment and support of many of our Fellows assisted by a small team of office staff in Bangalore. This year’s Foundation Day Celebrations extended over two days viz. on 28th and 29th May in view of the fact that the following two important topics of current interest were chosen for deliberations: (1) Drought Scenario and its Monitoring System in Karnataka (on 28.05.2017); (2) Strengthening and Restructuring the State Departments of Mines and Geology (on 29.05.2017).","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Foundation day 2017 and a report on strengthening and restructuring of State Departments of Mines and Geology","doi":"10.1007/s12594-017-0744-2","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s12594-017-0744-2","venue":"Journal of the Geological Society of India"}

Among pharmacological pain management interventions, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are frequently recommended as the most effective treatment option for OA. However, the use of traditional oral NSAIDs is associated with risk of serious adverse events involving the gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, and renal systems. Topical NSAIDs are an alternative with well-established tolerability and efficacy in the treatment of OA of the knee or hand. While the management of OA pain is evolving toward the more widespread use of topical NSAIDs, some OA management guidelines have yet to incorporate these agents in their recommendations. This review examines the efficacy and tolerability of topical NSAIDs, their current placement in OA management guidelines, and their potential role in enabling pain specialists to provide individualized care for their patients with OA.","inCitations":["6ad9d44ab63f42679863979771b39caee29f6a81","fcdc689f35e1dac3433f0beb8b51a9819067f5f7","ad1847ddad74ec442badac7eb560037a05d510f3","6cf4ef13d1a82aa30cfbea455a7d85aeb92fb117"],"pdfUrls":["https://www.dovepress.com/getfile.php?fileID=19668","http://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/pmc/2c/1d/jpr-7-211.PMC3990388.pdf"],"title":"Clinical trial data in support of changing guidelines in osteoarthritis treatment","doi":"10.2147/JPR.S45321","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.2147/JPR.S45321","venue":"Journal of pain research"}

This slip progression is prevalent in children and occurs very rarely after spinal maturation. The pathomechanism and predilection for children remains controversial despite considerable clinical and basic research into the disorder over the last three decades. Here we review the pathomechanism of spondylolytic spondylolisthesis in children and adolescents, and specifically the Tokushima theory of growth plate slippage developed from our extensive research findings. Clinically, we have observed the slippage site near the growth plate on MRI; then, using fresh cadaveric spines, we found the weakest link against forward shear loading was the growth plate. We subsequently developed an immature rat model showing forward slippage after growth plate injury. Moreover, finite element analysis of the pediatric spine clearly showed increased mechanical stress at the growth plate in the spondylolytic pediatric spine model compared with the intact pediatric spine. Thus, spondylolysis progresses to spondylolisthesis (forward slippage) in children and adolescents with the growth plate as the site of the slippage. Repetitive mechanical loading on to the growth plate may serve to separate the growth plate and subsequently progress to spondylolisthesis.","inCitations":["a3e760be00580749dfda09de050d4268d644b729","de622b224bfb76d38db29055280d7720db1b99a2","cc299348326ca2bd1a46641ab6d7771ebe62df21"],"pdfUrls":["http://medical.med.tokushima-u.ac.jp/jmi/vol62/pdf/v62_n1-2_p011.pdf","https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/jmi/62/1.2/62_11/_pdf"],"title":"A review of the pathomechanism of forward slippage in pediatric spondylolysis: the Tokushima theory of growth plate slippage.","doi":"10.2152/jmi.62.11","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.2152/jmi.62.11","venue":"The journal of medical investigation : JMI"}

In an interview in this issue of Computer Music Journal, Ms. Ferreyra relates some of her personal history and offers advice for young composers who may have little experience with analog tape manipulation. (She has also served as curator for the audio compact disc that will accompany our next issue.) The first technical article in the current issue elaborates upon work presented in the officially designated best paper of the 13th Colloquium on Musical Informatics (CIM), held in L’Aquila, Italy in September 2000. The authors, Pietro Polotti and Gianpaolo Evangelista, have devised a sound analysis and synthesis technique based on their harmonic-band wavelet transform (HBWT). This transform is able to separate a spectrum’s harmonic components from their sidebands, which are adjacent frequency regions that in the case of many musical instruments contain noise or microfluctuations from the theoretically static harmonic component. The authors have observed that these noisy sidebands can be modeled by pseudo-periodic 1/f-like noise, resulting in the technique they call fractal additive synthesis. The goal is to capture the realism of sustained natural sounds, whose timbres are usually neither static nor noise-free. Continuing a recurring theme from the past few years of Computer Music Journal, researchers in Helsinki present a new article on the synthesis of plucked-string sounds. Mikael Laurson and his coauthors have refined a technique for emulating an acoustic guitar, based on physical modeling. Their article covers not only the synthesis model itself, but also expressive real-time control of a PatchWork-based synthesizer implementation. Henkjan Honing’s article sets forth a formal analysis of existing representations of timing and tempo, and proposes some extensions and alternative approaches. Mr. Honing’s timing functions combine a time-shift function (which handles phenomena such as notes played “behind the beat”) with a tempo-change function (which handles variations such as accelerando, ritardando, and rubato). A generalized version of the model encompasses temporal structure, performance-time, score-time, and global tempo.

Group key agreement (GKA) protocols enable a group of members to negotiate a common encryption key via open networks so that only the members can decrypt the ciphertexts encrypted under the shared encryption key, but a sender cannot exclude any particular member from decrypting the ciphertexts. In this paper, we bridge these two notions with a hybrid primitive referred to as contributory broadcast encryption (CBE). In this new primitive, a group of members negotiate a common public encryption key while each member holds a decryption key. A sender seeing the public group encryption key can limit the decryption to a subset of members of his choice. Following this model, we propose a CBE scheme with short ciphertexts. The scheme is proven to be fully collusion-resistant under the decision n-Bilinear Diffie-Hellman Exponentiation (BDHE) assumption in the standard model. We also illustrate a variant in which the communication and computation complexity is sub-linear with the group size. Of independent interest, we present a new BE scheme that is aggregatable. The aggregatability property is shown to be useful to construct advanced protocols.","inCitations":["2b8ca4cb5941ad2bfeecc572c3b71092c913ec87","6f55fbfedb3f21a2d07b133e1e94029f2137e82b","ffde41db2f51d5d7aaf52ee49b5b004276222b88","e7ed94c22af1627015dbdda47bceb4d0ea2da6be","9868a41b4aea86ef32eb8627888623d9a7129e52","d92da73c6611009c3c2c58093a1396d8f82fb950","62286015040700bf270e3e622ae93236ad7e8e9e","8060e3e5f13b6ae1f0ced23cf539a146af35baf5","dcdad106286fdc7f063807b0ec6337c269309d83","55162b3f42079f9b75d57058535adfba0f861d6f","53434e2df41d09b6be9b10f1f3d405f2fe8df954","a05b139fee64ef6aaff9bd7c42f897534cc737bf","107c5c5bf34e06ece782f0f3487af84146b256d2","dc52c836fcb75de644de0f6a4165c13d681b901d","9a8a5063aa2886907d18bd1ecd997b6b84781398","f151d14d1c57becbc40c81fd0b9f95e097d8bbb1","12357ba5fcda6df6589d390d1404b9f3b7cd5d9f","c1a77564f6c0eae702c4d9a7c0f1f4ec4c7ff644","14fa4b72cc88beab55b6956e8f60a95642727f73","167a4dd128ea8bca22b57c6e89ae825252f2b2f7","cd578be2aa730cc38596423d98c55ab45f76a185","002b0a61520c6e1f749452fc383399fe500e8644","718a12feaf4361edb6b1e1dfa1ec2bd93369811d","ed51689477c76193c09bf41700d43491c0b26cd6","68a070408d548cde5033a63d769e3594a84107ec","232802fe707faa0be9fac92d42be849e075a6bea","da06a933f541373951e08dbd493800a65cac5cf5"],"pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-25385-0_8","http://www.iacr.org/archive/asiacrypt2011/70730143/70730143.pdf","http://crises2-deim.urv.cat/docs/publications/lncs/658.pdf","https://www.iacr.org/archive/asiacrypt2011/70730143/70730143.pdf","http://www.researchgate.net/profile/Lei_Zhang48/publication/221327280_Bridging_Broadcast_Encryption_and_Group_Key_Agreement/links/09e4151249d4e2526d000000.pdf"],"title":"Bridging Broadcast Encryption and Group Key Agreement","doi":"10.1007/978-3-642-25385-0_8","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-25385-0_8","venue":"ASIACRYPT"}

Las caracteristicas histologicas del tejido gonadal se describieron en funcion de los siguientes estadios reproductivos: reposo (0), inicio de la madurez (I), madurez total (II), desove parcial (III), desove total y degeneracion (IV). No se encontraron diferencias significativas en la proporcion total de sexos, aunque este parametro difirio significativamente de una relacion 1M:1H en algunos meses. La especie presenta asincronia en la maduracion de los foliculos, sin embargo, el analisis cuantitativo revelo que los estadios II y III estuvieron presentes durante todo el periodo de muestreo. Se observaron los cinco estadios de maduracion gonadal en hembras, pero solamente los estadios I al III en machos. Las frecuencias de los estadios se relacionaron con las variaciones significativas que presentaron los promedios mensuales del diametro de los foliculos y del lumen en ambos sexos. El diametro promedio de los ovulos maduros fue de 6,00 ± 0,11 µm, presentando su maxima proporcion en el estadio II. El incremento del estadio II, observado desde julio hasta septiembre 2002, se correlaciono con aumentos de temperatura, mientras que el incremento del estadio III coincidio con disminuciones de temperatura observados desde octubre de 2002 hasta enero de 2003. Tanto la salinidad como la concentracion de clorofila a mostraron escasa variacion durante el estudio, indicando que no son factores limitantes durante el proceso reproductivo de la especie.

It is a collection of stories about the old times when the everyday decisions were based on a spiritual understanding of the workings of the natural world—a moral legacy that has the potential to reinvigorate and revitalize our secular lives today. The book presents personal experiences and historical accounts of medicine men and their extraordinary and inexplicable range of powers. Deloria notes that “American Indian medicine traditions are a wholly North American phenomenon” based primarily in relationships with the land and nature (53). These historical spiritual traditions are distinct for each indigenous culture, yet a general philosophical approach is shared across cultures. The time frame of the book includes colonial times, western expansion, and the early twentieth century. The geographical focus is the northern Plains, the author’s homeland, with a few examples from the Southwest and east of the Mississippi. A central characteristic of the book is the extensive use of historical quotations to document American Indian spirituality. Quotes function as evidence of the existence, diversity, and veracity of American Indian medicine men. Multiple sources are effectively used to demonstrate the workings of old-time spirituality. These accounts were written by anthropologists, missionaries, soldiers, trappers, traders, and Native scholars (Gladys Tantaquidgeon, Francis La Flesche, John Stands in Timber, and Ella Deloria). Although anthropologists are both praised and criticized for their reporting of spiritual events, Deloria makes ample use of excerpts from ethnographic monographs by Frances Densmore, John Swanton, James Murie, Morris Opler, Paul Radin, Frank Speck, Ray DeMallie, and Peter Nabokov. The book also provides brief accounts of several powerful medicine men, such as Black Elk, Geronimo, Goose, and Horn Chips.

In the absence of spermidine at total adenine nucleotide concentrations between 0.35 and 1.4 mM, the static-head linking number was independent of the sum concentration of ATP and ADP, but depended strongly on the ratio of their concentrations. We established that the same linking number was attained independent of the direction from which the steady state was approached. The decrease in linking number at static head is more extensive when spermidine is present in the incubation, but remains a function of the [ATP]-to-[ADP] ratio.These results are discussed in terms of various kinetic schemes for DNA gyrase. We present one kinetic scheme that accounts for the experimental observations. According to this scheme our experimental results imply that there is significant slip in DNA gyrase when spermidine is absent. It is possible that spermidine acts through adjustment of the degree of coupling of DNA gyrase.","inCitations":["214dbedcbe5c7ae39512b1d1f3be2819f651b6fc","f3f1f70c8a0d873002fbe1857b6c9278c5fc8cff","70de3070bfc76c48b90bdcd66fd9a9a7393ce72e","7a5ca39ce67fab6290d81ecf6e812989ad0a44de","c32570af52e7bbefee58092fa875bebb33d9575a","57209786a37f95dc8c46c1c4279e75a7e021764e","ddcd18c0d56ead3ea097559936e5fbfbeeb6ce60","e891d1a0907e094683d1020c66acffa194441d08","89d244b13c6f8ef2255d0be59a8ce6e8d7d260e2","ea09efe65e5a34aec247ca675d7d1bc00ff13e0f","070bdbd5aeb52b2ca4f18e5b41b66a267944b39a","7115fbe1b1fa66202bb13a1c16b50401a5a9b503","f1441ed0d4514fd11bc1d5ad2e21687dc296fe67","fdef77134fd0740d85b0f0946587c30349dbc7b8","91ce04b052f6716322f7da0d1118dade99648da0","7d81ddebb523acb186e09248679584ea489f0318","a88c66dc24e9db4c843b423376754853d31dec7b","0337dfa037dec00c831f24a652161c63eafb93ea","af199e00d64e2b28c02002ef225e3f935dd5f90d","f70da1fd86deec980900b63a5f1be72aa87b87bc","51ce649d941cea3d1ad26543f19bb89b939c4dfa","93acf979eabb1ceea3fc115f43ec67a540eb0267","ce173e4af74df6fab498014570feef1de40a6ef0","d119e1c7f26601105c882cc1c878873a861afb16","d39fd15e1df48080dbeb13c64403023f9d0472f2"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"DNA supercoiling by DNA gyrase","doi":"10.1007/BF02918357","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/BF02918357","venue":"Cell Biophysics"}

The results show that, under low sliding velocity of 0.66 m/s and low applied load, the predominant wear mechanism of Al-10Ti alloy against carbon steel is adhesion. The fine dispersing reinforcement in the alloy promotes the nucleation and propagation of cracks on the subsurface, leading to a higher wear rate of MA Al-10Ti alloy, compared with that of RS Al-10Ti alloy. With increasing normal load, the formation and spallation of transfer layers on the worn surface become the predominant wear mechanism. Therefore, the wear resistance of the alloy obtained by MA surpasses that achieved by RS due to the higher strength at both ambient and elevated temperature. The wear transfer layer of the MA Al-10Ti alloy is determined to be consisted mainly of Fe2O3 and metal Fe.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Dry sliding wear of MA/PM Al-10Ti alloy","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

The maximum and minimum values of JQ were 517.4 kJ/m2 at 25°C and 304.5 kJ/m2 at 180°C, respectively. Dynamic strain aging (DSA) was also observed to occur when the temperature exceeded 260°C with a certain strain rate. Both the dislocation density and the number of small dislocation cells effectively increased because of the occurrence of DSA; as a consequence, crack propagation was more strongly inhibited in the steel.

The main problem in this study is to analyze what problems Laurel, as the main character of the story, faces and what efforts she does to overcome them. In this analysis, the thesis writer uses literary approach to analyze her work. She will use the theory of characterization and conflict to reveal Laurel?s problems and her efforts through the actions, speeches, and observations of the main character and also through the ideas of several minor characters. Through this analysis, it can be seen in the beginning Laurel lives a life as a pessimist woman who feels frustrated, suffers from the loss, and hopeless. A part from that she has also another problem where in some events of her life she has failed in making some decisions. Moreover, she is also in a lack of self-confidence which makes her not have enough courage to oppose those who treat her badly. All of her complex problems have caused her great unhappiness. She lives in a deep pressure, sorrow and full of fear. However, in the end, after the funeral of her father, she eventually manages to solve her problems. By having a positive thinking, by learning from her mother?s experience, and by having self-reliance, they become her efforts to overcome them. At last, based on the discussion, Laurel is successful to conquer her problems and brings her to be a better person who lives in hope, courage, peace and victory not only now but also for her future.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"A Study of Laurel's problems and her efforts to overcome them as seen in Eudora Welty's the optimist's daughter","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Geographic mobility was defined both as distance moved and as number of moves. Two-hundred-one eighth and ninth grade students were selected as subjects for this study. All subjects were administered the Rosenberg's Self-Esteem Scale (S.E.), the Physical Estimation Scale (EST), the Sport Competition Anxiety Test (SCAT), and the Fear of Negative Evaluation (FNE) Scale. Subjects also completed a study-designed form created to produce personal data needed to determine each subjects level of geographic mobility. The specific hypotheses tested were: (I) that high-mobile students will have significantly lower self-esteem scores than low-mobile students, (II) that high-mobile students will have significantly lower estimation scores than low-mobile students, (III) that high-mobile students will have significantly higher competitive trait anxiety scores than low-mobile students, and (IV) that high-mobile students will have significantly higher fear of negative evaluation scores than low-mobile students. Hypotheses I and II were supported statistically for both definitions of geographic mobility. Hypothesis IV acheived statistical support only when distance moved was used to define mobility. Discriminant function analysis was conducted in an attempt to better identify salient variables related to geographic mobility. The best ii discriminator of high and low mobility groups was identified to be global self-esteem accounting for an overall classification accuracy of 71.3%. Results of this research identified global self-esteem, physical estimation, and fear of negative evaluation as the intrapersonal factors related to the geographic mobility construct. It was recommended that future studies concentrate on distance of moves as a method of defining mobility and that they explore the possible effects of high-mobility on athletic participation and performance.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://digitalcommons.uri.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2617&context=theses"],"title":"The Effect of Geographic Mobility on Selected Psychological Variables in Eighth and Ninth Grade Students","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

The betaTPSF was considered to indicate an admixture of CSF to the subdural fluid if betaTPSF/betaTPSER>2.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe median beta TPSF level for the whole patient group was 4.29 mg/L (range 0.33-51 mg/L). Cerebrospinal fluid leakage, as indicated by betaTPSF/betaTPSER>2, was found to be present in 93% of the patients with CSDH and in 100% of the patients with SH (p=0.724). In patients who later had to undergo repeated surgery for recurrence of CSDH/SH, the betaTPSF concentrations (median 6.69 mg/L, range 0.59-51 mg/L) were significantly higher (p=0.04) than in patients not requiring reoperation (median 4.12 mg/L, range 0.33-26.8 mg/L).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAs indicated by the presence of betaTP in the subdural fluid, CSF leakage into the subdural space is present in the vast majority of patients with CSDH and SH. This leakage could be involved in the pathogenesis of CSDH and SH. Patients who experience recurrences of CSDH and SH have significantly higher concentrations of betaTPSF at initial presentation than patients not requiring reoperation for recurrence. These findings are presented in the literature for the first time and have to be confirmed and expanded upon by further studies.","inCitations":["0bf12672b846b90b2df6f0752859f22ed3cd7a81","2f7225455c3e1c03c003a162c71e016a5b5b35a4","033faad714942e2d2fd095539c9bca8ec52fb140","517f1658649da740919c2605c97438902d2b99ef","f0767ad393bb5e403899584a979ebb6a80e91845","48ef164e3586e9d71fc74cff46bf4429ec806892","d06beff12882b1d315de1c5fecf09573d8f754f0","35bdc64b175c3f7e760120926dfb9ce3c18e20db","7d607b9d42c0f4725a0d4f21b4806d1b796ac754","0d1d4d46a9ca979bc98a9935e33fdb98464458d1","2f7d08992e1e7882b9f9c1a85da39b3c444b687d","fadd4b967a95796234aeb7aac570d00ffbfe52fa","6b7e9c24cd6e3469d5283e3990328145be6ab910","5ad9a60ae687737f37097348d7a4392cf0c97ce6","1dc9991c9a3c250d8921acd6da1c83848df7e667","8fe9fb870619cc662eee0651eb53df825122abce","ceeb0991055fd4a0bba62d294d030120316f396c","d49d67335e0e886150b5e6c60b772820d72a1542","1045c0597ac772c9d9f6143562bf198446ac507d","b21e55f4276df26fa525d20d85bb0dee52492dd5","c3c8eeace2af183f27a7f72c1fca15c053bc0359","447beff5f6a6810ea9364faf3a72bf608b27e3db","feaaca835337fa4aa86d722e5d0579160807f802","d5bde1b1b06a8ebd6ed7a531b41445ed2558ef00","c98705d01db29f791839d636ac8ec42f9382b74a","205ecc8f0b3dfac61e0ed1d2661b40b707abf8e9","1bc98a7181e9ad5d49125f951c71e745feef7afa","66f1218982f8c3a16e47c43d386530e65c0134c1","a062053c42e06b3c507be11e1c5204605a15c6fa"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Cerebrospinal fluid leakage into the subdural space: possible influence on the pathogenesis and recurrence frequency of chronic subdural hematoma and subdural hygroma.","doi":"10.3171/JNS/2008/108/2/0275","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.3171/JNS%2F2008%2F108%2F2%2F0275","venue":"Journal of neurosurgery"}

It is also capable of explaining the behavior by which people help others probabilistically (known as ex ante fairness). Furthermore, in contrast with the existing view of ex ante fairness based on expected outcomes, my model does not imply that stronger ex ante fairness behavior is associated with less risk sensitivity. I study these predictions with evidence from an experiment. I find that subjects take more risks when outcomes are ex post fair compared to when they are ex post unfair. I confirm ex ante fairness behavior is a common choice pattern and document how, according to the model, it responds to its relative price. Finally, I reject the implication of existing models that stronger ex ante fairness behavior correlates with less risk sensitivity.

METHODS: A prospective study was conducted on 100 anti Ro/SS-A positive mothers that were followed before and during their 118 pregnancies (4 twin pregnancies and 18 second pregnancies). Counterimmunoelectroforesis (CIE) and immunoblot (IB) were used to test antibodies to extractable nuclear antigens (ENA). RESULTS: Only 2 cases of CHB (1.8%) were found among the 112 living newborns. In one case the mother with primary Sjögren's Syndrome (pSS) was anti Ro 60 and 52kD positive while in the other case the mother affected by undifferentiated connective tissue disease (UCTD) was anti Ro 60kD and anti La positive. No fetal death was due to CHB. There were no cutaneous rashes at birth while mild hepatic enzyme alterations were observed in 21 (68%) of the 31 tested newborns. In 22 healthy newborns an ECG have been registered and in 4 cases (18.2%) sinus bradycardia was found. During the follow up 7 suckling showed Cutaneous Neonatal Lupus. Moreover a six month girl developed Kawasaki Syndrome. CONCLUSIONS: The risk of delivering a child with CHB is 1.8% in anti Ro/SS-A positive mothers with CTD. This finding is extremely important in the preconceptional counseling of anti-Ro/SS-A positive women. Furthermore mild electrocardiographic abnormalities may be found in their healthy newborns.","inCitations":["24da7b15cf13de0270d9c63ff63b65faa9d547a4","6ee45b774f5fbc7ccce38bb9d8001cac4e4a326f","0e88f3ef2468224117772d751097e23bdc648bea","710391f86f27f50d33fbb44dbbb5016151ea1d48","5c3cbc030d5e321cecbf3ec8df3a20c8d087aedf","12404ee1d44c0257292ed314c01234645e48e98f"],"pdfUrls":["https://www.reumatismo.org/index.php/reuma/article/download/reumatismo.2001.298/41"],"title":"[Neonatal lupus: clinical features and risk of congenital cardiac heart block in newborns from mothers with anti Ro/SSA antibodies]","doi":"10.4081/reumatismo.2001.298","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.4081/reumatismo.2001.298","venue":"Reumatismo"}
