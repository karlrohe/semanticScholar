This concept has recently been challenged, at least in part, by studies with transgenic mice. According to the neurotrophin hypothesis, mice with genetical disruptions of any part of the CREB–BDNF–TrKB pathway would be expected to display depression-like behaviors. However, none of several mouse strains investigated so far have exhibited such a behavior, some of them being even less ‘depressive’ than the controls. Despite some possible explanations for the lack of a depression-like phenotype, the present findings challenge the hypothesis that this signaling pathway plays a major role in the pathogenesis of depression. However, mice with impaired CREB signaling show reduced BDNF inducibility. Moreover, mice with impaired BDNF-TrkB signaling have a decreased behavioral response to antidepressants. Thus, despite the conflicting results on the role of the CREB–BDNF–TrkB pathway in the pathogenesis of depression, this signaling cascade seems to be directly involved in the mechanisms of antidepressive therapy. Therefore, pharmacological strategies should be developed to generate small-molecule agents that increase the expression and promote the release of BDNF more specifically and more efficiently than currently available antidepressants.","inCitations":["1f81831fe7538c61486b5cba9285d7d5bde0616f"],"pdfUrls":["https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1566277203000884","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1566277203000884?dgcid=api_sd_search-api-endpoint"],"title":"Modeling depression with transgenic mice: the neurotrophin hypothesis revisited","doi":"10.1016/S1566-2772(03)00088-4","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/S1566-2772%2803%2900088-4","venue":"Clinical Neuroscience Research"}

A local strain of Cladophora was used to remove cadmium from a synthetic wastewater. The algae were grown in a laboratory using natural water under the following conditions: pH controlled between 7.8 and 9.0, 18 hrs of light/day, occasional application of plant fertilizer. Cadmium was added to the water in two modes ‐ one time addition of a large dose of heavy metal (concentration 5 mg Cd+2/L), and several small, equal doses (each 1 mg Cd+2/L), added everyday. Experiments were replicated to verify reproducibility. In all sets, removal of cadmium (in a range of 8 days) varied from 86% to 96%, based on the residual concentration in the water. Percentage of removal calculated from digestion of biomass closely approximated these values (within 20%). High degrees of removal were observed in the first 48 hours.

Coupled inductors enable to integrate magnetic components into one assembly. Therefore, the miniaturization and the lower cost of the magnetic component for the inductor are achieved. However, characteristics and design methods about integrated coupled inductors for proposed circuit have not been analyzed yet. This paper analyzes characteristic about the proposed circuit and flux in the core of proposed integrated coupled inductors. Moreover, the design procedure of proposed coupled inductors for the case of using the conventional three-leg core is presented.

Between 10/2006 and 12/2015, 572 T1-T3N0M0 PCa patients received 70.2 Gy in 26 fractions at 2.7 Gy/fraction: 344 patients (60%) with three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT) and 228 (40%) with intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT). Radiation Therapy Oncology Group/European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer criteria and Houston definition (nadir + 2) were used for toxicity and biochemical failure evaluation, respectively. Median age was 74 years (interquartile range 69–77). Compared with 3D-CRT, in IMRT group more high-risk patients (29% vs 18%; P = 0.002) and more high-volume target (75% vs 60%; P < 0.001) were included. Acute gastro-intestinal (GI) toxicity G > 1 were registered in 8% and in 11% IMRT and 3D-CRT patients, respectively, whereas late GI G > 1 were observed in 2% and 16% IMRT and 3D-CRT patients, respectively. Acute genito-urinary (GU) toxicity G > 1 were registered in 26% and 40% IMRT and 3D-CRT patients, respectively, whereas late GU G > 1 occurred in 5% IMRT and 15% 3D-CRT patients. Multivariate proportional hazard Cox models confirmed significantly greater risk of late toxicity with 3D-CRT compared to IMRT for GU > 1 (P = 0.004) and for GI > 1 (P < 0.001). With a median 4-year follow-up, overall survival (OS), clinical progression-free survival (cPFS) and biochemical PFS (bPFS) for the whole series were 91%, 92% and 91%, respectively. cPFS and bPFS were significantly different by risk groups. Multivariate Cox models for bPFS and cPFS showed no difference between irradiation techniques and a significant impact of risk group and initial PSA. Moderately hypofractionated radiotherapy is a viable treatment option for localized PCa with excellent tumour control and satisfactory toxicity profile. IMRT seems associated with a reduction in toxicity, whereas tumour control was equal between IMRT and 3D-CRT patients and depended mainly on the risk category.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Impact of image guidance on toxicity and tumour outcome in moderately hypofractionated external-beam radiotherapy for prostate cancer","doi":"10.1007/s12032-018-1233-1","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s12032-018-1233-1","venue":"Medical Oncology"}

An EtOH extract of Bauhinia strychnifolia showed good inhibitory activity against several cancer cell lines including HT-29, HeLa, MCF-7 and KB. As there has been no previous reports on chemical constituents of Bauhinia strychnifolia, this study is aimed to isolate the pure compounds with anti-cancer activity.\n\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nFive pure compounds were isolated from EtOH extract of Bauhinia strychnifolia stem using silica gel, dianion HP-20 and sephadex LH-20 column chromatography and were tested for their cytotoxic effects against HT-29, HeLa, MCF-7 and KB cell lines using the Sulforhodamine B (SRB) assay.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAmong five compounds, 3,5,7,3',5'-pentahydroxyflavanonol-3-O-α-l-rhamnopyranoside (2) possessed very potent activity against KB (IC₅₀=0.00054μg/mL), HT-29 (IC₅₀=0.00217 μg/mL), MCF-7 (IC₅₀=0.0585 μg/mL) and HeLa cells (IC₅₀=0.0692 μg/mL). 3,5,7-Trihydroxychromone-3-O-α-l-rhamnopyranoside (3) also showed good activity against HT-29 (IC₅₀=0.02366 μg/mL), KB (IC₅₀=0.0412 μg/mL) and MCF-7 (IC₅₀=0.297 μg/mL), respectively. The activity of 2 (IC₅₀=0.00054 μg/mL) against KB cell was ten times higher than that of the positive control, Camptothecin (anti-cancer drug, IC₅₀=0.0057 μg/mL). All compounds did not show any cytotoxicity with normal cells at the concentration of 1 μg/mL.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThis is the first report of compounds 2 and 3 on anti-cancer activity and based on the anti-cancer activity of extracts and pure compounds isolated from Bauhinia strychnifolia stem, it might be suggested that this plant could be useful for treatment of cancer.","inCitations":["ceb6975ec4df3422f144ca70a2bbfaf48a8bd93f","5fce872d2279db2360e6d454777fa98c055db51b","11ab8486cd6e3c5acac4e1082e63dcdf5de389ad","194c01e70147d8d238f27a15f076aa3f7fd85a2e","9cc619754515be4ccc8f85143592cce8ed34542c","810b3e2c1e2911cdeb2bc569bdde77d789781369","408f9323118e82346177700aa3e128f6822a0fd4","8714425a556f8f40b5a6d603d737505e825c085e","04e7ff1bb17ae7ed4716672830f161d75f0ab7c1"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Anti-cancer activity of compounds from Bauhinia strychnifolia stem.","doi":"10.1016/j.jep.2013.09.025","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2013.09.025","venue":"Journal of ethnopharmacology"}

Scalp hair samples were collected from inhabitants of the rural outskirts of Gdansk, located in the north of Poland (from citizens living near a phosphate fertilizer waste disposal place) and from the donors who were employed in two factories in southwestern Poland (coal mine in Zabrze and lead manufacturing company in Olawa) characterized as urbanized and highly industrialized areas (exposed groups). The results were compared with an average element composition of the hair of students attending the Technical University of Łodź (control group), people who were assumed not to have any direct contact with these elements, and with literature data. The determination of elements was performed with ICP-MS and ICP-OES methods. A questionnaire involving personal data information about such things as sex, age or smoking habits was completed by the volunteers. Our results revealed significant differences in concentrations of metals for studied groups and suggest that the populations we studied are exposed to toxic metals. The most probable exposure pathways seemed to be workplace and environmental pollution. This work was also undertaken to study inter-element interactions which were analyzed by the evaluation of correlation coefficients between a pair of two metals. But, with a few exceptions, no essential relation has been established.","inCitations":["4ddacdf1e693d595325d369cb168087a4556f0ac","7a75dd89b54658db180d2d8fd5bb665ad5b8bfce","cb05167cd66a14df8896160979de66697decc337","e99b637835db1119df020867be6f8e0917656d74","2bc4a016109d94f04e8c6ea3ca1d8312e8d31f48","3e27498af141696c65722315377885c5da0edf14","9413a5601e0c3fa2848e4160baf64f4632b5050e","18d46bd8fe540cdf7aee20f86b830e43920e1c45","bdc9609bb1eead6550f7bf48149d921f1e65c0c2","7bd709864af67a08817de26004e1084674cb3d68","7f7a9e7a8f9de111adf582f36b5c968c88af623a","2a2e0ae57d8a27dd0781d9a95f6fd4d849e8ec90","fab67052b5fe671df68c0e6d3a27ee3e4ef13da7","dc456fa3c4c2ef828bc4cc7d335a83e03ad1f848","f166ea09edb5b3fe96010a0812612f15a7dc89b0"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.pjoes.com/pdf/18.6/1151-1161.pdf"],"title":"Human Hair as a Biomarker in Assessing Exposure to Toxic Metals","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Syndication of investments helps to overcome the problem of distance to portfolio firms if one of the investors is located close to the investment. Altogether, we find no evidence for a severe regional equity gap for young and innovative companies in Germany.","inCitations":["8cb30f10b404d00371f1ef0b61a6f72adb348f04","a0922468e82ad3c85f20d5b93d5a97cf7485ed39","9a8fd15f4da41c033600bfdb01df2f54d10cc7d7","d14b5c755a401f9d0f5c475b96e73b14f6d6f2d2","9f874edd7bea7bc93a51afdd3edfc5c38665bbe8","ee5b1ae99702adaf35252fea0e851c472d05c4d6","814bda22c06b34e9ab46c8f476f5b983eef1e261","ce0daa5c204d3c4f13ff92af265369a9a608e1af","83a40f7d2ec16b6294c69a45457b865878f6db0f","7f08740414fd578c67e556bc81f31e69a6851d8b","97b324063b8a2394349f62ad396886c0dbe8e5ac","93bae3bb7e8b2977baeae2f9336712376062b54b","54ac6aca145bd071ed30d783243fafa6603c6725","1dbd8ffbb2feb562753e1c6a5321b4118c32ca5a","0bc292bee1ba370565027ec0b8385f4507b47244"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Is Venture Capital a Regional Business?

The desired trajectory to be followed by the mobile robot in presence of bounds on the linear/angular velocities and accelerations is available online. Moreover, with the respect to the kinematic constraints, the desired path has to be kept as long as possible. The implemented algorithm is based on a discrete-time kinematic control which implements a warping of the time law based on the definition of a virtual time. In addition, a fuzzy inference system handles the additional information given by the difference between the virtual and real time in order to exploit the knowledge in advance of the desired path. The experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the adopted algorithm.","inCitations":["bd7c8bf02928e7b41b3a6895513fde462052473d","a2000eb6f95e8b09d40c63952596b78de10a8bde","c79e4191029c0f634d0d8f473240974f2aa2416b","4d92ffe7fb6dbaca27ac7867c748d28cabeaf080","fc00af3d24ee342839ecfda5028b0ebf95c2c7c4","8083c61a3f4388d022aad7a5a5cd6b9be487aceb"],"pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1109/ROBOT.2002.1014857","http://www.researchgate.net/profile/G_Fusco/publication/224055135_Experiments_of_fuzzy_real-time_path_planning_for_unicycle-like_mobile_robots_under_kinematic_constraints/links/00b4952f8d3fc25d31000000.pdf"],"title":"Experiments of fuzzy real-time path planning for unicycle-like mobile robots under kinematic constraints","doi":"10.1109/ROBOT.2002.1014857","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ROBOT.2002.1014857","venue":"Proceedings 2002 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (Cat.

In addition, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was available from 22 of the TSP patients and neopterin concentrations were determined in these. Elevated levels of neopterin were found in only 3 of the 36 HTLV-I-positive serum samples, all from TSP patients, but significantly elevated neopterin levels were observed in 12 of the 22 CSF samples. The localisation of the elevated neopterin concentrations to the CSF of patients with TSP suggests a marked degree of activation of the cell-mediated immune system intrathecally. This provides further evidence in favour of powerful immune mechanisms operating centrally in the pathogenesis of TSP.","inCitations":["2012a0fdcc665c7245bae4d01a85c473b8776ae8","918458f7dce5cb707c816163fee13741d9653218","07c5a4b88c4b7f6dd5fdcbb7e39cde403baba19d","c4451d719d9fd07d208f7354624927114421b9be","678343e038498616873f46760eb2be336ee0d45f","891a76cdb8620c3f8112d30d4130287eee505306","5ab1ed16215646534aeef333dfd42fe145e30d0e","6b680bb334faee3d82e4b26e65f18bbd3900e554","b532701e030abdd3f418edf48ad70b2bc3b93f09","0811e5f88cfdc5646bfc9f865f176ffe6a553fed"],"pdfUrls":["https://page-one.springer.com/pdf/preview/10.1007/BF00810351"],"title":"Neopterin concentrations in serum and cerebrospinal fluid in HTLV-I infected individuals","doi":"10.1007/BF00810351","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/BF00810351","venue":"Journal of Neurology"}

Once formed, the steroid-receptor complexes were analyzed by isoelectric focusing in agarose gel slabs. A careful slicing of the receptor tracks revealed the presence of three distinct radioactive peaks focused at the following pI values: 5.3 +/- 0.2 (n = 17) and 4.4 +/- 0.1 (n = 17). All these peaks correspond with receptor isoforms as suggested by control experiments. The receptor state was analyzed after focusing by a chromatographic assay on DNA-cellulose, DEAE-trisacryl and hydroxyapatite minicolumns. The peak of pI 4.4 apparently corresponded to the non-transformed receptor and was greatly stabilized in the presence of RU 486, whereas the peaks of pI 4.8 and 5.3 were probably made of transformed receptor and meroreceptor. These results were confirmed by autoradiographic studies after isoelectric focusing of receptor molecules covalently labelled with [3H]dexamethasone mesylate. Thus, the rat-liver glucocorticoid receptor appeared to be a rather acidic protein which became less acidic after transformation by heat, displaying a pI shift which was strongly reduced in case of steroid-receptor complexes formed with the antiglucocorticoid RU 486.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Microheterogeneity of agonist and antagonist glucocorticoid receptor complexes detected by isoelectric focusing and modifications induced by receptor activation.","doi":"10.1016/0167-4889(87)90075-9","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/0167-4889%2887%2990075-9","venue":"Biochimica et biophysica acta"}

Studies in other failure models have suggested that the intrinsic coupling between L-type Ca current (I:(Ca,L)) and SR Ca release is reduced without a change in SR Ca load. The present study investigates whether Ca(SR) and/or coupling is altered in midmyocardial myocytes from failing canine hearts (F).\n\n\nMETHODS AND RESULTS\nMyocytes were indo-1-loaded via patch pipette (37 degrees C), and Ca(i) transients were elicited with voltage-clamp steps applied at various frequencies. I(Ca,L) density was not significantly decreased in F, but steady-state Ca(i) transients were reduced to 20% to 40% of normal myocytes (N). Ca(SR), measured by integrating Na/Ca exchange currents during caffeine-induced release, was profoundly decreased in F, to 15% to 25% of N. When Ca(SR) was normalized in F by preloading in 5 mmol/L external Ca before a test pulse at 2 mmol/L Ca, a normal-amplitude Ca(i) transient was elicited. E-C coupling gain was dependent on Ca(SR) but was affected similarly in both groups, indicating that intrinsic coupling is unaltered in F.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nA decrease in Ca(SR) is sufficient to explain the diminished Ca(i) transients in F, without a change in the effectiveness of coupling. Therefore, therapeutic approaches that increase Ca(SR) may be able to fully correct the Ca handling deficit in heart failure.","inCitations":["4cba2dad0088cbda9b641271a959192865d7fe3a","6464c6145946fb2677390228b97785a53fb5e96d","82111d719f8095f7a9b0eacbb93b8f5eddf6f47a","503fa64ba79b6308da3fbdbb0253ed81f587c0af","40e0efd59d9bf49516fe13cab7b417b68feccb88","30b2185240effd9e219d88ffb44f439049c21fea","0ccfdcf12542272921ba1be3434fb3da972f41de","e0401c888e271229953d4a5d0737463b5e5d41e3","b617a49366c3a0274c423f36e646a46b8fd91adb","62c74656e45df89cea3e8ad649ab3ec0eea4a3d1","7c1e6ed038ed45e6b3253cf0dbcb7d9e875dbaab","d8852becd6f65ebe31c0c281a52eeffb61433a80","ca5826c3ba907bb355166248af6c74f98147fec9","c62bb052b650af5ebc43fcffb725aaa2e450f75f","4fc8f14dec1e331d68d9e7f738ebd32115adbe6b","da47c3ac4aa6bbf00d9bd329d11f0019a2975905","2256082b49c6887a187889e7e99033b918e01c4e","746652da243a6553c3031dac9edaa151f1bf3bf4","0b747b2d63be13bf253bf8a5c767834d43ce6e04","12646651bb017140bfe6921091aa7ec3be364f11","36fc1e5330521435cf810bbe2d9e50979ba704df","f4d71858b343c9ee5dbcd5c46cd33bd09a9c5f71","01a65ceb9be1bd43e86ffa11a86bf1280b4e3fa0","d292986f0186f9dddf39aaeef2f18670fbc03af7","cdffe4982d49966512f52d22d32a335c6602e2ec","0c8316921cfa2faa6927e7beedec9aaa33d4f4bf","2a7a216c5d7c61200346b368ac2b534153912095","3a6775a9fa2bafa31718b56582621473e0b0260d","12280a019aa5fb9f5414e3262f24e990aee63573","def3cc81cd9c9d6994c8743b937dfcde6381705b","e6762f16d6b4e6ce5e33db79cd0941b93c17d803","b0d168faebad5fd7ada93c02ae0a9674718730b3","935fe00eec2e39487101fbf16dcd5653f2b5ccb1","7a13a963035ee39be0fbd86042fd3ac64bb5b698","8de1cbbf5d559904a5457131b0d18ed8ad09e2ba","0e06f5d24c8898aad1462ef076eb0249ab068dee","13b65f0de8a47797d2955f4654f0d205dd07de08","aa1fa768d7d4525b3c5de4df55dbc62237d6609d","dd4d940a99c8e77afc7a77836475f9b1b6ea6ec9","95cba1baaeb724e12414090b8f606b4c40fc8172","1eeb3520c639c307f3ed241789c206a39b32af70","05b8c22cd1369c82dea69ed3b75aee8e389f8300","57eda4f4c423df9b8b23b64d31f80e4a752024e4","a9dd74872c37face273d0cfc44834ae051755627","f653c97d2bbac48b56426ae34ca38ef72eab9f2f","5db4e1bf57415080a311a9185440d5cd5e28f46c","7f841ca0b683d346c180acc9fdc014c5c2243206","ad46b7cd3992315ce11857ed9428a6dc567bccda","29fd7d85b833e8b0373647ce936e9e56d716ba2c","e44b80f780d5a3131c5f98518453ce616db88859","87c1589c3e7d3a2b1b1cdcd49e92e80142980ef3","3c8bfde8db88a62dcfbb4292c4aadbf151038340","20e6cc346fb13ceeeeb31337e03c9568c1be33c9","d0ef7593da2c0b7da8123114ccbb061486b19f52","f824d84a61c19f3c6a9096b3e401adda82b89655","3936f4dae569fb943a29224d2db0a59a3fc6d221","30632e681039cc4f9a4c4044c56bbc739dcc3ab8","0c52376865ab6ced0acb62b59d24ed66473bc7d1","4bc705e84ac2ba28b0cfcf973b66a4c690b5fbf4","2ceba6002f58d82b38d286cc72275c6d0022fbfa","4b4a66fb42351b11957ec317ea95cd7f5f35fe4b","a230568c5e8e4b4d17ca14e0cb624a34a3d21785","c0fbc193a15b3f9c2522b43342ec1d1bf2acaa5f","355f7dedc94c9935a213941bd132fcfc48e0eaec","fd35c2fa85880904f5da7386f090ca24ebc44518","e5df95efcd5fc28e9a3c35fcf990d10c25943859","0de5c34a93b89226f42676d2e1a41dab6b5d6430","05b3659b6015025b0490e4b869ffe766ea3142c9","ae2f73fbd02497ffe8529d6e9bd6b09dcda928b9","f448dc90cc9c304e87c0f83454c8ae77825967b4","b7179f2ae55d954dc2ea33d4dbc303cfc8c05725","3860eaf5be194f18be4dc12a6f25fde37f4c03d8","f2f62d1ae3fd10269f9a50d85d55bc3638e03e48","0e3ffff9552b628876f21ba655c7c79eaf1dbd3d","b27fdf227e78171932c0babde14887d7fd22843f","c80f6d60bc64f82a4fd68fd080022f8a8229638e","799d7774e8da03ce0d3237a255505ee84c25ade1","3b7ff7d203e052b071d9caa49812675e5f6a1f20","94b6d7cdb1cd6a3b174816f698a1682a80b1691b","c69c50627843e7dc4e94bf7c89f60145cb1d4dd4","a00b2aed079cb73acfb60f630f97f18bb7ac0e65","160d12973937433fd6292f57ea6e13542ad51516","586b22dd4b4d99dfbc1105209749864da6d53014","da56c5ceb4d395ccbf61a67c92de6aa3743f2c58","cc82361ae68b9c250139d5e5f1dc7cdbad5b059b","ff9384ff64e48a5588ad44459bb8af6d8f80f40a","1e051162f763384d04ccfa1daa01a84de1bc66db","058f30d32b42243d9e067c61ddd3e009f071fcdf","cbdb8e3020d2139480fd38f790ab75d2c12f4fc6","112dd47c5ca3bd0ac2967233085a3ae517110e55","8f7a7a03ef527e65e86a69200806f6e1b0f9d091","0d9a4e07bcc525d7de2eb6eb29fdeeb39ca0779c","80ca4874daf0110355505a6cf12e2f1d68e2d280","64153775b25a0b8cdcd0e27e460d6b3b96f86adb","1da75e0187e43ec2b3ebf2c1aa22e4b3e02017b1","5329a719c2c0a5e03995a3a5a8de440095a32cc2","2ff68bbec936be823829da3c63e210de26550d24","57a598affba928aec10a654e50a693553fb67c21","dbcfda3cb45bce80b246f15131762b0eaefdcda3","2d1cec39fbe3f98fed72e909e67fc7a173efa275","20cd8aa8a6e7975940c10ec84fede65b625aa090","4d116270088a0bfdd5720cffd4d9bede31273bba","dae7c4e18dc80824e6e3d90169828e368093f1ca","2f26ac2839680219b91f507eb22fcb6731eaf930","c27ce6ed240bb96608b52ef4f3e983c6fb8467e2","13c6abd298f9de7b75da241b53cdcccf7c33b567","1bfd7be81231dbf510f576477e19c6229db03840","ca2afcd011170007c5ff520f85bf8ca1287e81ec","cdfa45c27789d9ea6142c687a9c28ebfe2eb1c4b","5f96c7feacc8b9f472155eca91548656c5299a5a","235d4975c45bb7dc386d10ae0c18580d10e643c0","d393996800e25b3bb7557080b07b2d2880f7a8d2","8b825069878c8852630c395299c5b004a4416206","5e53e43fd469c1ae5cd182f85d0cee269ed814fc","75ee267c9de25b409e4442c31da6844f9aa93eb5","7d319ab6513806b7a0a8829d1b852

The effects of aging on the physiological characteristics of skeletal muscle are fiber type specific. This review describes the aging process in skeletal muscle; specifically, the effects of aging on the biochemical, morphological, and physiological characteristics of type I (slow-twitch) fibers and type II (fast-twitch) fibers. The effects of training on specific fiber types are also reviewed. The age-related decrease in maximum isometric force may be due, in part, to a decline in muscle mass. Decreases in muscle mass appear to occur in weight-bearing muscles and are most marked in those with a high proportion of type II fibers. The age-related fiber atrophy contributes to the decline in muscle mass. The decline in fiber size is prominent in type II fibers, whereas type I fibers are less affected. The age-related prolongation in isometric twitch properties may be due, in part, to alteration in the capacity of the sarcoplasmic reticulum for calcium release and recapture. Resistance and endurance training appear to attenuate the age-related alterations in skeletal muscle properties if the stimulus is of a sufficient intensity and duration.","inCitations":["9352d6419ebcfa273c52943e81421d76359f8d82","2a0ea6aafef202fa8d77f8f3af3642486fe9f688","2a65b89643ca9ddee41d74817b8de72a482182ef","f1f87c66bb4937c377ed439f7170088589cf2312","02230a20d9472b3a097eba2f234ff1de2b27fc91","8db04ba20ca21ac25fb04462914b471a00059d3e","c65409937d64a0986183f8a5385474d7b7538340","a2b91e9b613fb9af51813bd6c8db19428707c1cc","c64f76876539f9f2e92fc4a8dff5c55e7ff3d3b8","862a4ba4ae73a86f088450f460bf868026094706","7c84b68753e330db01f87025dc71ef5a2e1e3666","0ea4a28abfa81adefa98edee35214398f8187813","b88610c0fe420bcf31a0ad6dcb54086f040dfa6a","d8a03f21325796fa423222379a54a18a61c2301b","57e983aecf758707925c82efa12d2b981b330bd0","317b74c6834d7d37ac697eaadafc49ce6b3c6e35","94fb6c4e5501b55a6b95fc491951752be057faec","ddf46778f63bdbc5af012ea81f77cb7213539840","595917a425764ccbe3e56dcd12c0b0e8eee81ae0","6f34922946433d65da1f528cf058ba3be75f4e1b","65c1362b802e5d70bf995840ae042ed076b17bd7","549702c0a9b2404f1f4c95b139b3f6698447f2f9","116c1e31f27ac31fd808ac9a4e808fb324077ac2","7ea81991e386be0504528cdf555a7b3066c664b1","cb842205e7c002a4ae03602694641515e842e1e3","6dff7b6eb537d1ea229feab1623f85dd7c38b96c","6d2d18a99b1ff48968e9bdddc21f1e5f3006d2ec","5489d9bc08d4a43f5f4fd0890ced6810a2e51bc8","1ccf7dda963aab9ea8194bedd9d2950616ff7edd","eba9f11e9e081ccf63f40386681a4e582438018e","552902bcb4952fb28685258bd954cdefbb36e0c5","7734e6c42942789503fc52f4aea9a6bb3fbe9bf7","44bcb215f7e3e5ec410c6ed9be48fa9da3d43067","087e62a2a51851392ef641468dbc0a703fcf4ae1","fcf78c19344fd5755357182db017e975e0239e46","00caac722bed8942b2d3511700873b14aaa48004","d1f1e586a5b2edd66a4ccc7d7588d2ff0f7089e7","44395aac81c08d874bbe4f49e9463811911483e5","294a514e8ad88692a8e1f533c62bb9fa8a536ac7","4bb65a48e289cdc479c7238cd73ee66ebb0a7c65","eba1a8f0ddac8286d5e0016a1c45ae9d2283af0b","85092bfe122c06980ea5619aae19135cde61af83"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Effects of age and training on skeletal muscle physiology and performance.","doi":"10.1093/ptj/74.1.71","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1093/ptj%2F74.1.71","venue":"Physical therapy"}

We produced 0.5-3.0 μm fragmin (low molecular weight heparin)/protamine microparticles (F/P MPs) as carriers for the controlled release of HGF. F/P MPs immobilized more than 3 μg of HGF per mg of MPs and gradually released the absorbed HGF into the medium with a half-release time of approximately 5 days. Compared with HGF alone, HGF-containing F/P MPs substantially enhanced the mitogenic effect of HGF on cultured human microvascular endothelial cells, by prolonging the biological half-life, and its conjugation to F/P MPs protected HGF from heat and proteolytic inactivation. F/P MPs disappeared 8 days after subcutaneous injection in mice, suggesting that they are rapidly biodegraded. Furthermore, the number of large (diameter ≥200 μm or containing ≥ 100 erythrocytes) and medium (diameter 20-200 μm or containing 10-100 erythrocytes) lumen capillaries 8 days after injection of HGF-containing F/P MPs was significantly higher than that after injection of HGF or F/P MPs alone. Furthermore, the number of small (diameter ≤ 20 μm or containing 1-10 erythrocytes) lumen capillaries was significantly higher 4 days after injection of HGF-containing F/P MPs. This increased angiogenic activity of HGF in vivo is probably due to both sustained local release and protection against biodegradation by the F/P MPs. Thus, F/P MPs may be useful and safe HGF carriers that facilitate cell proliferation and vascularization at sites of tissue damage.","inCitations":["d3b51c775a4fce7d9ec0dce5675216748665a93f","1d0289144bba465b5c293d09255e54b1bd70625d","1e7cf7d50b2786b2949dae3006c032eeb7437b4d","e964b5f606ea1bcbef432b394df84490c6ce7a65","7bc109e564e36f434fc254a27844c8efd8c92757","4201c3af22d29c67483bd3821835f6d3e7127317","a81c6dc28b865ace7aa56e1ded26b64d5063095c","464e34d50d6d39e7abdc9a3be75df41a9da7299a","3e20ecc0b5dcc0e3359543b608451a9d06dbdf68","2b18f7ff6c42912404ac5e640f90a97dc4bd9a37","d3d8c8a571e570845a2ca54cf44069cfbb023673","91f6e429aa137d6d22ce68a6ba0764d288992eb8"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Fragmin/protamine microparticles to adsorb and protect HGF and to function as local HGF carriers in vivo.","doi":"10.1016/j.actbio.2012.08.003","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.actbio.2012.08.003","venue":"Acta biomaterialia"}

The results show that 97.8% of RhB and 5.6% of MO were degraded under the same conditions, respectively. Photocatalytic degradation of RhB was obviously superior to degradation of MO. The adsorption of MO was almost negligible and 56.8% of RhB was adsorbed on ZnIn2S4. Superoxide radical was the key active species, and hydroxyl radical played a supplementary role during photocatalytic process. Different chemical bonds with different bond energies were destroyed when degradation of RhB and MO. Photocatalytic degradation of RhB was superior to that of MO because the excellent adsorptivity of RhB than that of MO, and the CN bond of RhB was easier destroyed compared with azo bond of MO under the same conditions. The photocatalytic degradation of MO in a system in which superoxide radical was key active species can be improved by adding hole scavengers to inhibit recombination of holes and electrons, which would result in more electrons reducing oxygen to superoxide radical.","inCitations":["512b7ddb068927a34ea2aaec7a1146c72998e5d3","663f6e6a607b66d5a3e2495a5aab882f830d8442","a576690696aeb7c4309195af8a5d8e4920070434","d8655c341bd7b74fcdfac6e679312087df2cfa3c","01f3d3bfb74166aa59c10352496629fe34c7693f","c079e803e46bd6d86335f8f0a79759ecd1c5a8a1","78a1d4cae65f3602640db714cf5325edea6a97db"],"pdfUrls":["https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlepdf/2017/ra/c7ra00199a","http://www.rsc.org/suppdata/c7/ra/c7ra00199a/c7ra00199a1.pdf"],"title":"Comparative study of the photocatalytic performance for the degradation of different dyes by ZnIn2S4: adsorption, active species, and pathways","doi":"10.1039/C7RA00199A","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1039/C7RA00199A","venue":""}

The imaginary part of Regge-behaved amplitude comes from the s-u crossing term of the convergent lOPE amplitude, accompanied with the diver­ gence of lOPE expression. Duality between t-poles and u- or s-singularities is necessarily contained in Regge behaviour. A general expression for the lOPE amplitude satisfying full Regge behaviour is persued and comments on related models are made in connection with our approach. Phenomenological aspects of various solutions are also discussed. The analysis of hadron scattering using finite energy sum rules has revealed the existence of an intimate connection between Regge pole exchanges and re­ sonant states in direct channel and has developed into Veneziano amplitude. This has created a problem of understanding of the physical implication of Regge pole exchanges. Regge pole exchange originally gave an exchange picture of composite par­ ticles at high energies. Its connection with the one-particle-exchange (OPE) mo­ del (which was proposed as an application to hadron reactions of the Sakata model) is quite interesting, especially when we consider its success in describ­ ing low energy scattering phenomena, such as nucleon-nucleon scattering. Among the interpretations of Regge behaviour so far proposed, that of an infinite sum of single exchanges of Regge recurrences is the most attractive one for a gener­ alization of OPE model. The purpose of the present paper is to give a general expression for the scattering amplitude based on the infinite sum of one-particle-exchange (lOPE) model/), 2 ) in which Regge behaviour is imposed at the asymptotic energy region. As an a posteriori result, the duality concept comes from the requirement of Regge behaviour in all the complex u plane except a positive real axis, where","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"An Approach to Regge Behaviour and Duality Based on an Infinite Sum of One-Particle-Exchange Amplitudes","doi":"10.1143/PTP.47.208","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1143/PTP.47.208","venue":""}

This presentation examines our PMCTA technique and analyses the reasons for incomplete performance and complications. Methods Review of all PMCTA records. CT images were compared with autopsy reports. Failure of PMCTA was defined as inadequate contrast filling of visceral and cerebral vessels including the site of suspected pathology. Complication was defined as iatrogenic vascular abnormality. Results 136 PMCTA performed since May 2010. Indications were subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) 39 (29%), haemopericardium 25 (18%), suspected GI hemorrhage (HGE) 17 (13%), intra-abdominal HGE 16 (12%), suspected pulmonary embolism 15 (11%) and other HGE 23 (17%). Autopsies were performed in 119 (88%). Failed and complicated PMCTA was observed in 53 cases (39%). These included inadequate filling of cerebral arteries 41 (30%), incorrect vessel cannulation 3 (2%), traumatic rupture of cannulated femoral vessel 3 (2%), iatrogenic arterial rupture due to over distension 3 (2%) and traumatic dissection of aorta. In 27 of 41 (66%) incomplete cerebral arterial filling occurred in cases of SAH. Discussion The inability to adequately fill intracranial arteries is an important deficiency in our technique especially given that SAH was a major indication in those cases. This failure seems to be a function of the raised intracranial pressure associated with SAH. Complications were considered largely technical and may have reflected inexperience of operators responsible for groin dissection or local variation in groin anatomy. Conclusion PMCTA as practiced at VIFM under performs especially in the cranial cavity for detecting causes of SAH possibly due to raised intracranial pressure. Meticulous dissection technique is required at the groin in order to avoid cannulation site complication.","inCitations":["e99e29802c384f3055761ceb3214571f80c2b617"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"When it goes wrong: Complications of post-mortem CT angiography (PMCTA) as performed at VIFM","doi":"10.1016/j.jofri.2013.03.017","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jofri.2013.03.017","venue":""}

Using multiple antennas at both the transmitter side and the receiver side increases the channel capacity without additional frequency spectrum and transmitted power. However, due to the limited space at the size-limited terminal devices, the most critical problem in designing multiple antennas is the severe mutual coupling among them. The aim of this thesis is to provide compact, decoupled and efficient multiple antenna designs for terminal devices. At the same time, we propose a simple and cost effective method in multiple antenna measurement. All these efforts contribute to the development of terminal devices for the fourth generation wireless communication. The background and theory of multiple antenna systems are introduced first, in which three operating schemes of multiple antenna systems are discussed. Critical factors influencing the performance of multiple antenna systems are also analyzed in details. To design efficient multiple antenna systems in compact terminals, several decoupling methods, including defected ground plane, current localization, orthogonal polarization and decoupling networks, are proposed. The working mechanism and design procedure of each method are introduced, and their effectiveness is compared. Those methods can be applied to most of the terminal antennas, reducing the mutual coupling by at least 6dB. In some special cases, especially for low frequency bands below 1GHz, the chassis of the device itself radiates like an antenna, which complicates the antenna decoupling. Thus, we extend the general decoupling methods to the cases when the chassis is excited. Based on the characteristic mode analysis, three different solutions are provided, i.e., optimizing antenna locations, localizing antenna currents and creating orthogonal modes. These methods are applied to mobile phones, providing a more reliable link and a higher transmission rate, which are evaluated by diversity gain and channel capacity, respectively. In order to measure the performance of multiple antenna systems, it is necessary to obtain the correlation coefficients. However, the traditional measurement technique, which requires the phase and polarization information of the radiation patterns, is very expensive and time consuming. In this thesis, a more practical and convenient method is proposed. Fairly good accuracy is achieved when it is applied to various kinds of antennas. To design a compact and efficient multiple antenna system, besides the reduction of mutual coupling, the performance of each single antenna is also important. The techniques for antenna reconfiguration are demonstrated. Frequency and pattern reconfigurable antennas are constructed, providing more flexibility to multiple antenna systems.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Calculation of signal correlation in lossy antenna arrays using scattering matrix","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

It is biodegradable, biocompatible, exhibits thermoplastic properties and can be produced from renewable carbon sources. The commercial exploitation of P(3HB) has been mainly held back by its high production costs. Hence, a lot of research is required to optimize P(3HB) fermentation conditions. In this study we have focused on the effects of impeller speed and pH on P(3HB) production in Bacillus cereus SPV. Four different impeller speeds, 50, 125, 250, and 500 rpm, were used. The highest amount of P(3HB) accumulation was achieved using 125 rpm impeller speed (34% dcw) and this was attributed to optimal cell growth rate. Also, pH-stat fermentations were carried out at pH 3.0, 6.8, and 10. This study confirmed that lack of P(3HB) degradation during unbuffered Bacillus fermentations is due to the low pH conditions. This observation is crucial for the industrial exploitation of the genus Bacillus for the production of P(3HB).","inCitations":["a0ff4db642086356c38b54639d8a8bbc0a0ad13b","86d8a9b93108389b6e5817d548d9388de7ae3790","ebeb018cc6345fa3ab3115fcde53d4269322f682","7dbab72587e5879ffedebf5d56d0e924d1d7276a","012a4a93bc61011de1b3378e04c3f23ffe940c79","106c83083be1a0e86b000a783c3417c0a3f1914d","d1254b1e78e0bbe23771a60b57136e7cbbbd464b"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Effect of impeller speed and pH on the production of poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) using Bacillus cereus SPV.","doi":"10.1021/bm801395p","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1021/bm801395p","venue":"Biomacromolecules"}

Its average effective dose (E) is 0.53 mSv which is comparable to the annual per caput dose from diagnostic radiology, 0.6 mSv. However, existing studies on optimum tube potential for pelvic X-rays tend to be limited to screen-film and computed radiography. The purpose of this study was to determine the tube voltage for dose-image optimisation in pelvic direct radiography (DR). Fifty-four pelvic phantom images were acquired using 50-135 kV at 5 kV increments (three images taken at each kV level) and milliampere seconds determined by automatic exposure control. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and dose were measured for each image. Figure of merit (FOM) defined as the ratio of SNR 2 to E was used to determine the optimum tube potential. The FOM indicates 135 kV is the optimum setting for pelvic DR. Using the European Commission tube voltage recommendation (75-90 kV) as a reference point, there was only a slight (5.56%) decrease of image quality in the femoral neck region at 135 kV. However, its E was 0.054 mSv. This appreciable dose reduction potential could be attributed to the improvement of detective quantum efficiency and image processing technology of the recent DR system.","inCitations":["4cd5a618741210b6bba16c9836087bca8a3c2084","f95770662b38976fa4d6bc8aa7dd1705ebbd3b6d","fd1acbc95e0d14fb219fc51ffba980df446696a2"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.sar.org.za/index.php/sar/article/download/354/247"],"title":"Optimum tube voltage for pelvic direct radiography: a phantom study","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

For the capture of butterflies during 38 days of sampling between the months of July and December 2016, an entomological network and six Van Someren-Rydon traps baited with decaying fish and fermented fruits were used. A total of 284 individuals of 44 species were captured, from the families Nymphalidae (S=38), Papilionidae (S=3), Pieridae (S=1), and Riodinidae (S=2). The most abundant species were Pierella luna lesbia and Heliconius erato venus in the preserved forest; Pierella luna lesbia, Heliconius erato venus, and Colobura dirce in the secondary forest, and Anartia jatrophae, Heliconius erato venus, and Anartia amathea in the habitat of permanent intervention. In the preserved and secondary forests, there was a 62% similarity in the composition and structure of butterfly species, but not so in the permanent intervention habitat. Out of the 44 species reported in this study, 25 constitute new species records for Pacurita locality; the Nymphalidae family was the predominant one. The species P. luna lesbia, A. jatrophae, H. erato venus, A. demophon muson, and S. magdalena cleove were the best represented despite experiencing changes in their abundance according to the type of habitat. © 2018.

Finansinspektionen). One of the reasons for the SFSA to revoke the license was HQ Bank’s valuation of the financial instruments. Mr. Johan Dyrefors was the auditor of the bank at that time. Both he and the audit firm KPMG was reported to the SBPA (sw. Revisorsnämnden) since SFSA did not share Mr. Dyrefors opinion that the trading portfolio had been measured in a correct way. Therefore, we investigate how the SFSA and Mr. Dyrefors argue for their notion of the concept of an active market and what supports their opinions in current regulation and previous research, which also is the research question of this thesis. Limitations: This thesis does not investigate the level of activity of the options, which existed in HQ Bank’s trading portfolio, nor their markets activity properties. No deeper investigation of the underlying financial aspects, such as which measure of volatility is the most appropriate or examination of the fitness of valuation models, will be carried out since these topics concern financial economics rather than accounting. Neither the management of the bank nor how it affected the liquidation will be examined. Method: An explanatory case study has been performed in combination with a qualitative text analysis to compare the parties' opinions and legal dogmatics to compare the opinions with the standards and current law. Finally, market data have been extracted from a financial instrument used in both the SFSA’s and Mr. Dyrefors’ line of argumentation. Results and conclusions: Firstly, the parties agree that activity existed on the market, but their interpretation of whether it was large enough to be useful for the valuation diverge. Mr. Dyrefors’ arguments, consistent with some academics, indicate that fair value is problematic when markets are illiquid and spreads are large. Secondly, our findings show that HQ Bank’s definition of an active market lead to a possibility to manipulate the market, though this might not have been the purpose. Finally, lacks of general proofs from both parties’ basis of conclusions reduce creditability in the discussion. As long as assumptions are fully motivated and consistently handled, both opinions may fall within the boundaries of the IAS 39. The fall of HQ Bank clearly indicates that the scope of interpretations in IAS 39 might be too broad. Suggestions for further research: A quantitative study of the level of activity of the options in HQ Bank’s trading portfolio or the properties of their market activity would be interesting, as well as if observable market data was used enough as input in the models and how this affected the accounting. Also, whoever aims to evaluate new valuation techniques, which improve characteristics of reliability, must be encouraged, since both science and regulation seems to be missing solutions to this fundamental accounting issue.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://gupea.ub.gu.se/bitstream/2077/29323/1/gupea_2077_29323_1.pdf"],"title":"The fall of HQ Bank AB - from an accounting perspective","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

However, knowledge about the neurobiological mechanisms underlying these activity-induced cognitive benefits is still limited, especially with regard to the role of white matter integrity (WMI), which is affected in cognitive aging and Alzheimer's disease. To address this knowledge gap, we investigated the immediate and long-term effects of cognitive or physical training on WMI, as well as the association between cognitive and physical lifestyles and changes in WMI over a 6-month period. Additionally, we explored whether changes in WMI underlie activity-related cognitive changes, and estimated the potential of both trainings to improve WMI by correlating training outcomes with WMI. In an observational and interventional pretest, posttest, 3-month follow-up design, we assigned 47 community-dwelling older adults at risk of dementia to 50 sessions of auditory processing and working memory training (n = 13), 50 sessions of cardiovascular, strength, coordination, balance and flexibility exercises (n = 14), or a control group (n = 20). We measured lifestyles trough self-reports, cognitive training skills through training performance, functional physical fitness through the Senior Fitness Test, and global cognition through a cognitive test battery. WMI was assessed via a composite score of diffusion tensor imaging-based fractional anisotropy (FA) of three regions of interest shown to be affected in aging and Alzheimer's disease: the genu of corpus callosum, the fornix, and the hippocampal cingulum. Effects for training interventions on FA outcomes, as well as associations between lifestyles and changes in FA outcomes were not significant. Additional analyses did show associations between cognitive lifestyle and global cognitive changes at the posttest and the 3-month follow-up (β ≥ 0.40, p ≤ 0.02) and accounting for changes in WMI did not affect these relationships. The targeted training outcomes were related to FA scores at baseline (cognitive training skills and FA composite score, rs = 0.68, p = 0.05; functional physical fitness and fornix FA, r = 0.35, p = 0.03). Overall, we found no evidence of a link between short-term physical or cognitive activities and WMI changes, despite activity-related cognitive changes in older adults at risk of dementia. However, we found positive associations between the two targeted training outcomes and WMI, hinting at a potential of long-term activities to affect WMI.","inCitations":["8e6a4877f269b2d7d9a8b2c4897d6de7d8c07559","fb4088e918d4ef6761709b7fa830a922cc6b7ca8","d8648df8678fa9a5490038a5d4afab430141fd46","f96a02d9ef9041055812496f1caebe7054f7942d"],"pdfUrls":["https://publikationen.bibliothek.kit.edu/1000070090/5954109","http://kops.uni-konstanz.de/bitstream/handle/123456789/38951/Fissler_0-404989.pdf?isAllowed=y&sequence=1"],"title":"No Evidence That Short-Term Cognitive or Physical Training Programs or Lifestyles Are Related to Changes in White Matter Integrity in Older Adults at Risk of Dementia","doi":"10.3389/fnhum.2017.00110","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.3389/fnhum.2017.00110","venue":"Front.

The potential utility of this exemplar-distribution approach for theories relating selective attention, similarity, and categorization is briefly discussed. Nosofsky (1986) proposed and tested a unified quantitative approach to modeling performance in tasks of multidimensional stimulus identification and categorization. The approach was based on the assumption that both identification and categorization decisions are governed by similarity comparisons with individually stored exemplars. By modeling patterns of identification confusions, a multidimensional scaling solution for the exemplars was derived. This solution was then used in conjunction with the exemplar-similarity model to predict performance in four separate categorization conditions with the same set of stimuli. A key component assumption was that selective attention processes may systematically modify distances among exemplars in the multidimensional psychological space.","inCitations":["75a874b3e8a03d90b8a9bca3a79fe575ebf34ff3","21932da2b1cbaa7676c222f5d52b17f894ee61eb","c561be91ab1e962907528d4583e507c53b360de9","e025f66bd1b60a4b9fb858f0e6838e561c676d4c","7fc28fa81cc33ca9fb47fd33649714089010ed07","aad63f99c269bab90353adffb77c76db8d340af9","f0fca05c6459595148e67a075dec01b60cdb9168","7bb9e06eb10c6b2dc11057a075945d824cb104ea","45764e2d1a1139ff62c9af284f5101967f2867d6","a7cab9be85df9a375329ea7f4709b43ca5088157","3b4ea8f80377674b63f5eb490627798298452b80","afc623f4590fc1d510173a75cadbb0859118cb67","10cac11f7228c3438ba8c10afae48d75390c311c","81fc0c216f144dba4c79e25fe53bcc1c1f4e0993","db4ce227a7108d4752724f6bb862b39f55e3d40f","9041901ac255488f053df089094e9a452c1b7ea7","f69d7e7cb9e7193b3ba309885701b7255151eb2c","a6fce25267d192dd2e892079fd81597d74263374","de57aaf233ed2050529aeb70f1c36881996deb47","bb276a2b7b723092f5ee9517a0dee172b5b4fd82","bcd9b08301567b2607c0fe490dae816fcd4102c3","ac716ae0df9edf6522b13455ec5039563db68ccc"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.cogs.indiana.edu/nosofsky/pubs/1988_rmn_jep-g_on.pdf","http://cogs.indiana.edu/nosofsky/pubs/1988_rmn_jep-g_on.pdf","http://voteview.com/pdf/Nosofsky_Reply_to_Ennis_1988.pdf"],"title":"On Exemplar-Based Exemplar Representations: Reply to Ennis (1988)","doi":"10.1037//0096-3445.117.4.412","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1037/%2F0096-3445.117.4.412","venue":""}

Of central interest is the Jones representation [6] and the work of [8] gives a homological construction for the summands in this representation which have two rows. In this paper we shall give a construction which is related to, but more general than that offered by Lawrence. Our approach has some advantages. For example, one fundamental question is whether such a representation can be chosen to be faithful and the representation is constructed in a way that is sufficiently geometric that it affords some insight into the faithfulness questions in the spirit of [10]. Another advantage is that calculations become rather routine. One further consequence of the method is that it yrill produce representations with many parameters. The central idea has two main ingredients, the first being a generalisation of the classical Magnus construction and the second, which also lies at the heart of [8] is iterative. These combine to give a method for constructing new representations from old in a rather nontrivial way. The first result is the following.

The research described contributes to a body of work examining how mass media and other social forces factor in the creation of negative stereotypes that damage the reputations of the places in which the poor reside. The overarching framework of understanding, provided by Goffman’s theory of stigma, is complemented by two further inter-related theoretical approaches, namely Social Exclusion and Political Economy. Combining analyses of media production (practices), media content (discourses) and audience reception (beliefs, attitudes), we analyse the representation of one of Ireland’s most deprived public housing estates in the print and broadcast media. Having established the stigmatising character and impact of national and local media content via this tripartite methodology, we focus on identifying and explaining the media practices that serve to (re)produce the estate’s ‘spoiled identity’. Our analysis of journalists’ explanations for these practices identifies the commercial realities, which progressively influence media production, as directly impacting media producers’ relationships with, and depictions of, poor places. We conclude by examining debates regarding the potential for rehabilitating a spoiled identity.","inCitations":["3719b02ca4a8003c9f91221e58a1e4a87a15c7be","cd3b608db67551e6cbb99f529cf68a3c8320aed6","394e9e27b3c85446b46e367d6ff91bd81aae0fec","784139b03e6dafeab1745d16bf02c5a043e6aaee","672fec1d3743eb1e8156efcb5b5015c0f3a1cce9","28f8937bb5e54d2521244da1218be2c72bad6dfe","5a4eb3a2610393c1e47993382ed29c04b2f07507","f122295a8769824f860e0f676e2b996b81b9237e","28172eb7d25ef626bd0d918ff5f1fe6a5cf5b0d2","7beb0fd368b0bcd7f687d55a7107b957b87e5909","0640466de394bcff0f9b767f9db6f61b3f22f639","350a22271a2b6e440944fce0c48412d68b08226b","274d920eeacc9e107537e9d1ae8a8e4ff52f5c21","dd4e9d9c026b4bc3cd47f99ba934a4cea2bcb356","069f06bf639c4a679d8512a348a1e0023cc31e1a"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"At the edge: media constructions of a stigmatised Irish housing estate","doi":"10.1007/s10901-011-9210-4","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10901-011-9210-4","venue":""}

To assist in this regard, this paper examines the predictive performance of a range of pile design methods against a newly compiled database of static load tests on driven piles in siliceous sands with adjacent CPT profiles. Seven driven pile design methods are considered, including the conventional American Petroleum Institute (API) approach, simplified CPT alpha methods, and four new CPT-based methods, which are now presented in the commentary of the 22nd edition of the API recommendations. Mean and standard deviation database statistics for the design methods are presented for the entire 77 pile database, as well as for smaller subset databases separated by pile material (steel and concrete), end condition (open versus closed), and direction of loading (tension versus compression). Certain methods are seen to exhibit bias toward length, relative density, cone tip resistance, and pile end condition. Other methods do not exhibit any apparent bias (even though their formulations differ significantly) due to the limited size of the database subsets and the large number of factors known to influence pile capacity in sand. The database statistics for the best performing methods are substantially better than those for the API approach and the simplified alpha methods. Improved predictive reliability will emerge with an extension of the database and the inclusion of additional important controlling factors affecting capacity.","inCitations":["bead7abb8b6feb7fb2edceced2f2d3bc7b365214","103006cdca1ba353cf60f6faabbf40db3a007465","8bb6e32083bb9a488acedb4d8d2e78f633e78263","3067b5f3546deaeaed5320edac926a7c0078a20f","b60e6393455bd6c8fb962b4e5af309da1786dcc0","5153153bcaaafe3a6d0aadb93bbe18bb2d9c867c","238d0999511685bc14f885d7d8491e1ee7f439d5","9f35a914664579cc29f73930a1c507055f5832f1","e19815fcadaea06cd70408e7098da49d666095a8","6f7953f7a46174dc8efd317ca9a2082370e1179a","3d0802fe4b72758d3cf949ef0061fbb2aa19eb4c","6302d5c3333942364d90a7e9587906894ed14101","22b7738284d3eeb354cd0b946651f36c2a993f1a","4a6a1008b0c9636727ebbb93a5684225b0854428","967b25b77bc844414654ce49b1160c35dbc1dd94","089c4886f52ceba294e36e0a11779e58d7db6b61","3db7959bb13dfbe12bbdbee0064edf0fe4fcc724","e4612602d68a125025178004b66e3b2df1c80c00","7ab8e0978e3220223a03b2fc42210ab51c2ff79e","5b5079038ac6e0ae74db6b8fe287706826169b09","73eb46e44dc0b56faa3d357c3ccd07621f990a45","8b6deae643f288eba07409e22490fd449282b4f9","95e9da35449ae859575dc875f366708f5641445c","87ca8135ec3a0fb060bc11b52ba6dba607fc9d65","aaa7b1cc1d9929afb502d5a953e8dc68cdb0d713","d1a4c4a00c83be85df223ed7e4f53eca93686758","ebce1810d6e4b9b14fec674effaeaef784073494","78da60bdb15b76ef9226c4f6c0a45ef04ba675e2","2518d5ab0cb8c3b6fd7d31051e315a9605d021e0"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Database assessment of CPT-based design methods for axial capacity of driven piles in siliceous sands","doi":"10.1061/(ASCE)1090-0241(2008)134:9(1227)","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1061/%28ASCE%291090-0241%282008%29134%3A9%281227%29","venue":""}

Calcium loading was performed by adding 1.5% CaCl2 (Calcium chloride) to the drinking water. Calcium loading attenuated the development of hypertension in the SHR but not in the WKY, and at the end of a 3 week experiment, systolic blood pressure was 171+2 vs 197+3 mmHg (P less than 0.01). In spite of this reduction of blood pressure, there were no significant changes in sodium-water balance, plasma levels of norepinephrine and epinephrine, plasma renin activity, plasma aldosterone concentration and serum electrolytes due to the calcium treatment. On this basis, the depressor mechanism of calcium loading in the SHR was studied by observing the pressor response to norepinephrine and the vascular reactivity to norepinephrine in hind limb perfusion. It was found that both the pressor response and the vascular reactivity were significantly attenuated by the calcium treatment in the SHR but not in the WKY.

It can distinguish food images from other images, analyze the food balance, and visualize the log. In this paper, we demonstrate how the performance can be improved by the personalized models. Because our Web application has an interface to review and correct the food analysis results, the generation of the personalized models can be done on-line. Experimental results using two hundred images showed that the extracted image feature vectors differ from user to user but on the other hand the feature vectors and the food balance of each user have a strong correlation. Therefore, the accuracy of the food balance estimation was improved from 37% to 42% on average by the personalized classifier.","inCitations":["5265a2acbb98b94c4b96a6bd3111388d99981d1c","37cc0296f8d1ca70a445ff49276776a2633bed93","18de3b586a7dbcaab9f82d0765d2037790753211","b7bd82bfbbc5a1c32af9b0966f782a8cac0845c8","c73fd084d6e57fbbe2dfc061fe6834df6eb0c67c","eeb12828c561e1b471ddad6270cf0e34bdc4d85a","2f8cf0eddb66d53e86121bb742a1dce14e86df1c","f389b1d9f8635070b487315addb9b636fb79a57f","22d920f6927cdd6e6b95c2f32d6e591973010dbf","c325ce22107370dca42f60894a9a97f52dc3d1f5","e36cdf913fda75f0b4d83206b522542b2f03c4df","e37d8dc0ffa9fd8fb6ddef9dddc8a2017042d4e2","8edcc72a3bf574ebf90a8de945993d1ef13122b7","a027807ac5575953ef4bc6ef3fdd4cfd7c8d3acb","b6901e52e81607e9ca94837c82de80596e581217","f9bfe089e78e60b0b9fd38174fde1fda0c04fc1c","96b379dc4a2ded17f993dd0586623ef398337054","1778833c3e23bb8b5a0cfcf87dc5398fa31909ff","19d5365bec746c420ff496d47736b697c1f4a599","4d6d77dee9fe65677a4d63766cc387ee7a0e276c","3dbd03afd07a3001c05ba8f98a7d5f83b5e23742","12bf3da24ee6a31144639b65a29726916c208f26","f7d7ae54c21d588a9c0517bf4336b39a25a834fd","35c5de0ae9224cc97bdd4d46be6a6b6121f3a41b","159ce29f50a04ef7c791ffb5396039ddd5244159","e5446dc815b068c55e0e4f64fecf90736f7eae2a","e5223afaec09c029185d9f209ee06a76930e7513","af2a85d546f83c970d181652061cf10d4e8991ad","a221e5650e65247a567f5077130b1181409d5115","b52d0e290a878e7d357570c84f987a37a96b95c7","9218c565cc46f02881be910d959fcdbe5043fbd0","3ab1450b2db38e95eb1ba21bcd577b051cec4c56","63970e6d8985ed4760202852a9ba38f907004c7c","c6a199ecafe38d84857a19359f46157caa6694d4","60fe801de3ddcad56ad4f803c81e6393ed5a60ca","724df12e9d92fb2467966ffccef0a4095d257c75","9f45a7e7d852acb8383c50f79d9df18ba5751660","8cc0c8f102d1bbb9e0431f2e16cb80243650c7a7","78286ece890d7f2fb42cbcdbbb46bce8b35e3111","543444e1c202b0609b762b188e882d4df812688a","64d42a977f644e1b2d0e680bc91cf5e5b3cbf034","f75bbb3eb2b29f71122a5c833f8bfbef93541291","621447ca93067fa73eea4fa661fab68f8647368f","a782537f62b59e7935a5c94b1ffeb2551988a074","f9b06cc299099026b656dfd13eaf0af934d64897","a11f5e74b13a6353d14e024d06a902b9afa728b3","011eeaefb94b34a06bd1ec63d481d0daed131813","47d2b311a0b9f8cc573a90d497c3fceceec83dce","c163f859c7e2c14b762bed0dddae8a794bfdb5fa","ffff18e40754bc455c36f52b000857d4e23dcdb4","7deaadbbaac9aa833d3d8a88da9c8ef754730639","c0321fe6b8ecc44bc98670d8cdbe018e45692f63","d060f9a877779b888cc318c4aa17351f5e1b2d42","c6362113885a8a1ceee4f8ed44140b46df633b0c","a64cf14a842d9727f031ce60a6d162c7e2320797","23e32d01763ef53b7ec94de90ef82520ead5b61e","ea5596bef5a6de15d4818e94b415ee662737a4f1","1aefd7278e0f88188e8f23ed9a1a443f16fb20ad","a6524ca0fabea791107a17ce6f86ab751574536b"],"pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1145/1630995.1631001"],"title":"FoodLog: capture, analysis and retrieval of personal food images via web","doi":"10.1145/1630995.1631001","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1145/1630995.1631001","venue":"CEA '09"}

NETs consist of chromatin covered with antimicrobial enzymes and are normally degraded by DNase-I, an enzyme which is known to have reduced activity in SLE. Decreased ability to degrade NETs is associated with disease activity. In the current study we investigated how the ability of serum from SLE patients to degrade NETs varies during the course of SLE as well as what impact this may have for the clinical phenotype of SLE.MethodsSerum from 69 patients with SLE, included in a prospective study, was taken every 60 days for a median of 784 days. The ability of serum to degrade NETs was determined and associated with clinical parameters occurring before and at the time of sampling, as well as after sampling by using conditional logistic regression.ResultsAs many as 41% of all patients in the study showed decreased ability to degrade NETs at least once, but with a median of 20% of all time points. Decreased degradation was associated with manifestations of glomerulonephritis as well as low complement levels and elevated levels of antibodies directed against histones and DNA. Furthermore, the odds ratio for the patient to develop alopecia and fever after an episode of decreased NETs degradation was increased by four to five times compared to normal.ConclusionsDecreased degradation of NETs is associated with clinical manifestations in SLE and may contribute to disease pathogenesis. Potential therapeutics restoring the ability to degrade NETs could be beneficial for certain patients with SLE.","inCitations":["9e051e4ae688259d86766e698f4af573fd4d0363","8a6dae096021502bfde342e8a489572fea9e494c","f47ba1b00de6a3cc9af0e7e1f2eee8c4a3a07d5f","99d83942a12b1a3bb7132294eb7b66fc53542b36","1dc52988b3e9795af6188d6767c1403a0d925584","09203e02b9c77bd17b88dc3deb9177beb73bf07c","f2bdc6c90ab3a16abd8a735b934cda24a1fe7b93","e49ab4f7576f5a3d527a68b8302e5211933248fb","9253076e9fe7df065ea568cfd6ab2c7a9fc9eb84","e5a6dacd33ccd767eb4fab55c17afaf2d9dc76b2","eb83da6f0583f6e97ab8a68cfcbb8263dd9be6dd","d407d52e13ef7329e7592a088427e4d95356e878","abe6dd3ef026ace143d5d616066df7dd2974e419","67a470d3e53b7fd2d5a0ddb4dcff966340b684e3","7d3c63f9bd822b9c9805b112e05357b7044e04ed","5b4245604f7dd67ab7c0b28f93cb8d8d44513e9d","781ef5f98e730c8b9fd42756cfdf6285750909eb","9f2812b091cbc0a623ddc465cb950a63d1cd3749","e13d861d83918963322a60a56c012c821835c309","844d39e612a38f426e53125b8652818d6ca97523","cf1aec1586c5b7553548d80fb69c52f5439cef80","3aed50a172805db0e5ae421ebdb4f46ef07a96b8","f0119ff8fa121785db7528c528c60ba3569e8108","18f2a5a1299d2f748acd284f31ca0f90cc6fecf2","385ae652dbe758511e0430e4b4c1996128b79766","07acdb883bff2c2df2d2161bfa966479747e8f13","601a9e8ba3369e49610a8e6cd367636b46b48fc5","e53cc5daf302895f4011104f9c9ded63478c1b05","8c46540d675b00c0a124f572ab12d4a6e341b6c6","061880db35f5046f6d528bf2374ead6836b045a8","e874dd3d7f31a5032b187e96b4106473e0a9ef0f","2a47e98a56f0b4a38f956662439e0779d16e2930","88337a340109481c195c262e27a7e2dd3275d77b","f58a4efb8b08d01aa5e3aa35d080fb5ef9ebbe71","6ad77342aba813e8300f935578858109fb704b1f","0349de6497bc1b8907998ea8cf2ac531131a3e10","dfa1367be0399ca98ed4937dade30cbe6c1e054f","948b3a13caebb08043123ec8ec65da7ce8ce4acd","7b0ef5d334833f4143cfb0d5f26e4c5396aa0301","97beb7c859ed6262201e2b61e6f9e5675791f7f3"],"pdfUrls":["http://arthritis-research.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/ar4264?site=arthritis-research.biomedcentral.com","http://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/pmc/d9/19/ar4264.PMC3978901.pdf","http://arthritis-research.com/content/pdf/ar4264.pdf"],"title":"Degradation of neutrophil extracellular traps co-varies with disease activity in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus","doi":"10.1186/ar4264","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1186/ar4264","venue":"Arthritis Research & Therapy"}

The survey explores how demographic factors affect perceptions of sound awareness technologies, gauges interest in specific sounds and sound characteristics, solicits reactions to three design scenarios (smartphone, smartwatch, head-mounted display) and two output modalities (visual, haptic), and probes issues related to social context of use. While most participants were highly interested in being aware of sounds, this interest was modulated by communication preference--that is, for sign or oral communication or both. Almost all participants wanted both visual and haptic feedback and 75% preferred to have that feedback on separate devices (e.g., haptic on smartwatch, visual on head-mounted display). Other findings related to sound type, full captions vs. keywords, sound filtering, notification styles, and social context provide direct guidance for the design of future mobile and wearable sound awareness systems.","inCitations":["df8b4524d4612960264644d0df9e5c229466e17e","ee7399007ed52bdcb458a197cb64d50292d560ab","882f58c743fb6a7cb2591e1736f9343e3f7346f8","64b0bb63015048b662fb165e9280a6f732a928f8","fdc69738f68745f1b11b269d30f9482fb428480b","81466142bca50a3e00e9ff4a0a0938795aba469a"],"pdfUrls":["https://makeabilitylab.cs.washington.edu/media/publications/Findlater_DeafAndHardOfHearingIndividualsPreferencesForWearableAndMobileSoundAwarenessTechnologies_2019.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/3290605.3300276"],"title":"Deaf and Hard-of-hearing Individuals' Preferences for Wearable and Mobile Sound Awareness Technologies","doi":"10.1145/3290605.3300276","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1145/3290605.3300276","venue":"CHI '19"}

One of the reasons they make these rings is to expand the array of available polycyclic aromatic materials used for making optoelectronic devices and used as organocatalysts. In particular, researchers have been looking at graphite-type materials based on six-membered ring core structures containing electron-deficient boron atoms. But incorporating both nitrogen and oxygen along with boron has remained elusive. A research team at Japan’s Institute of Microbial Chemistry has now designed and synthesized oxaazaborinanes—molecules that contain a B3NO2 ring—that are a cross between previously known borazines (B3N3) and boroxines (B3O3). The new ring had been a missing link in the collection of six-membered ring compounds containing B, C, N, and O (Nat. Chem. 2017, DOI: 10.1038/nchem.2708).

Digital repositories have in view to ease of use of digital content in a daily basis. Digital preservation systems, on the other hand, provide discovery and access options, propose standardized workflows use and risk analysis. This paper discusses the model of digital preservation management in distributed network that has the feature of using at least six institutions where copies of digital documents are stored. The model was assumed by the LOCKSS initiative at Stanford University that supports the creation of collaborative networks distributing collections saved in various institutions. The distributed model makes use of local infrastructure to ensure that at least one of the participating institutions have the latest version of a newspaper, book or thesis that was copied from the original. THE LOCKSS performs four functions of digital information management: \na) Collect contents from electronic publications using a web crawler similar to the ones used by the search mechanisms. \nb) Check periodically for consistency informational content is stored. \nc) Give Internet pages where preserved documents can be found. \nd) Makes available an interface that allows the administrator to select new content to be preserved, safeguarded, monitored content and control access. \nIn countries like those in Latin America, a model like this is can make possible that free access documents will be always available and to have the support of local specialists. The technological and financial regional cooperation would facilitate the adoption of the model. It will be presented the Brazilian experience, who in this year, with the creation of the Digital Preservation Services (Cariniana) by IBICT adopted LOCKSS Alliance digital preservation system to preserve national newspapers using OJS platform and books and theses that are stored in DSpace tool. The Red Cariniana covers among other services, the creation of digital memory centers and scanning units, as well as human resources training in digital preservation in Brazil.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"PRESERVACIÓN DIGITAL DISTRIBUÍDA: un modelo para América Latina","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}
