When the illuminated area contains an Al 2 O 3 particle, the diffraction lines near the ellipsoid-like particle become split. The splitting of diffraction lines maps the spatial variation of the residual strain around the particle. A model for computing the displacement field around a particle in TEM foil was constructed on the basis of Eshelby's equivalent inclusion method. Taking the equivalent eigenstrain as one of the adjustable parameters, the eigenstrain is determined by fitting the simulated LACBED patterns to the experimental patterns. The factors influencing the LACBED patterns and the accuracy in determination of the strain field with this method are discussed.","inCitations":["48662045a1e5d73e1f931cdc2f624bc0b82b5842"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Determination of interfacial residual stress field in an Al-Al2O3 composite using convergent-beam electron diffraction technique","doi":"10.1016/S0304-3991(97)00122-8","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/S0304-3991%2897%2900122-8","venue":""}

The structure, conductivity, thermal expansion behavior, and chemical compatibility were studied by XRD, dilatometry, and four-terminal method. A limiting current oxygen sensor was prepared with La0.8Sr0.2Ga0.83Mg0.17O2.815 as a solid electrolyte and La0.8Sr0.2(Ga0.75Co0.25)0.8Mg0.2O3−δ as a dense diffusion barrier.

There were no intra-operative femoral fractures. Late complications requiring reoperation were one femoral fracture and one fracture around the nail secondary to tumour. Seven nails had to be dynamised and a further six 'self-dynamised' at the site of the distal locking screw. One patient required revision of the distal locking. Only one other patient required secondary surgery for a wound haematoma. There were no cases of implant cut-out or non-union. The Targon PF nail represents a progressive development in the design of intramedullary nails for proximal femoral fractures and the results compare favourably with other intramedullary systems used to treat complex proximal femoral fractures.","inCitations":["471643aed789928e318e4228b3730b7a9d0345d9","299025ad5c1ddba80bf98a854aed0ce328396e10","b307e0565a5808a322df5cb01472724c73664b66","b40023fcb1c79f5b2776684f96fdc7fce54e6108","f9cb747f3faf63c53e8d08a50f5ddd620e863be6","288a9a152c489729a748da8a268b1c330e20a46d","809e15c990d3b14c2e5986dafa959429c733da73","eb30aca01a4cd7e194576c89a5f0bcd62dcc389d","38f0b169f118dce0e96b178ec11fb158138b4da2","d59062de3192a769ad51a610e5c42c20415960e0","50469fd5ba6a2daba892e19940f3830cba5c9139","99ca236edbc7c2b60032ade4818c8a0ba752a3f2","ec8dca19c256b3f9c016b49a2d1da3d2138ace6e"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Intramedullary osteosynthesis of complex proximal femoral fractures with the Targon PF nail.","doi":"10.1016/j.injury.2007.05.010","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.injury.2007.05.010","venue":"Injury"}

Their absorption spectra and HOMO–LUMO gaps are quantitatively analyzed to reveal the influence of different oxygen-containing groups including their locations and quantities on the optical properties of GQDs. Compared with those on the edge of the GQD plane, oxygen-containing groups located on the surface have more evident effects on the optical properties. The calculated HOMO–LUMO gaps of pristine GQDs and edge-functionalized GQDs with –OH, –COOH, –OCH3, –CHO, and –COC– are 2.34, 2.32, 2.31, 2.30, 2.27, and 2.15 eV, respectively, whereas the HOMO–LUMO gaps of surface-functionalized GQDs with the groups above are 0.36, 0.32, 0.37, 0.39, and 1.86 eV, respectively. Interestingly, the influence of surface and edge functionalization on the HOMO–LUMO gap of GQDs is almost opposite. The absorption process is investigated along with excited state analysis, which includes the oscillator strengths, natural transition orbitals, and charge difference density. It is found that functionalization on the basal plane greatly changes the distribution of electron density in surface-functionalized GQDs.","inCitations":["07c048cfeaded8f05da698ab5ab5c639b6123f50","60812e47745de92d04e8cc4e58b0dfccf559b976","ccd44752006af815c10184b520f69f9bd3749ed8","8a242d941dafda9a14ed5b666e1d44890a0ee1b0"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"The optical and electronic properties of graphene quantum dots with oxygen-containing groups: a density functional theory study","doi":"10.1039/C7TC00631D","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1039/C7TC00631D","venue":""}

In order to guard against publication in predatory journals, authors may use checklists to help detect predatory journals. We believe there are a large number of such checklists yet it is uncertain whether these checklists contain similar content. We conducted a systematic review to identify checklists that help to detect potential predatory journals and examined and compared their content and measurement properties. We searched MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, ERIC, Web of Science and Library, and Information Science & Technology Abstracts (January 2012 to November 2018); university library websites (January 2019); and YouTube (January 2019). We identified sources with original checklists used to detect potential predatory journals published in English, French or Portuguese. Checklists were defined as having instructions in point form, bullet form, tabular format or listed items. We excluded checklists or guidance on recognizing “legitimate” or “trustworthy” journals. To assess risk of bias, we adapted five questions from A Checklist for Checklists tool a priori as no formal assessment tool exists for the type of review conducted. Of 1528 records screened, 93 met our inclusion criteria. The majority of included checklists to identify predatory journals were in English (n = 90, 97%), could be completed in fewer than five minutes (n = 68, 73%), included a mean of 11 items (range = 3 to 64) which were not weighted (n = 91, 98%), did not include qualitative guidance (n = 78, 84%), or quantitative guidance (n = 91, 98%), were not evidence-based (n = 90, 97%) and covered a mean of four of six thematic categories. Only three met our criteria for being evidence-based, i.e. scored three or more “yes” answers (low risk of bias) on the risk of bias tool. There is a plethora of published checklists that may overwhelm authors looking to efficiently guard against publishing in predatory journals. The continued development of such checklists may be confusing and of limited benefit. The similarity in checklists could lead to the creation of one evidence-based tool serving authors from all disciplines.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://bmcmedicine.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s12916-020-01566-1"],"title":"Checklists to detect potential predatory biomedical journals: a systematic review","doi":"10.1186/s12916-020-01566-1","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12916-020-01566-1","venue":"BMC Medicine"}

Their diverse demographic and socioeconomic characteristics have attracted considerable academic and policy attention, especially insofar as those distinctive characteristics have persisted in the generations born in the UK. No official projections of the UK ethnic populations have been published since 1979. This article provides projections to 2056 and beyond of 12 ethnic groups. Given overall net immigration and vital rates as assumed in the office for National Statistics 2008-based Principal Projection, and the ethnic characteristics estimated here, the ethnic minority populations (including the Other White) would increase from 13 percent of the UK population in 2006 to 28 percent by 2031 and 44 percent by 2056, and to about half the 0-4 age group in 2056. Alternative projections assume various lower levels of immigration. Possible implications of projected changes are discussed.","inCitations":["7d36e01e7fee89918d0a297fc39321614950c1a0","b57ff1939ee72dcc85951e3a1ee6c96cfcd28dc6","8559d4c5851ad1f3d6adeab5275b40ecd0128205","f31b3ade11723801bacb2afe5ba81cedd86cdf96","2b8887e9994d32b1ccd2f86b3dc8b01ae450b4ec","b53e720e89208c15c104815685c1655b85c88c0e","08ab29cacc58fccbf1b9d0f4579f8e53257dd34d","c35e38fbc57607a70ac8d582c44ec96af791857c","658d83ea5034788c0240970a83d0aea080f9fac9","23cc0894c5e2ca05470487a05dd9aafb8e70835b","13a09562568aeafd5585c5832e41830347b0e36e","9c7e17c41e9e44e3ef3bda3433e98b85f3d607da","acbdf0e82769d2171f5e33aec4c57f9324763a4a","e107ef9156cd02de2dec59c37130568f8e2c6492","1e6f0e4442ff029b3475364331388b8afee81429","1d491ade4cd66edcec58581bdcdb30b79e8db426","db2497ff995e1cb18f177d9d7984aa020e7836da","2e3d21fdcc5fd2537e7d8d34e7293b0424709032","18d5745ad003ac9133041cbc773ba3ce62e1d311","e3d792d1a2ba627bf6119a5eab6dbbbfd59424b3","1e565dc2eea5e99637068f615df2ecdd106ba163","54d89c5d0a8ba22329098c9fe475d2594c37c185","b30765032e87b481ed94f37212cb0cbf433585e7","9ff024a42b53d70b1673b6c0e1e5d86fcd33f1b6","dd8ce88a82a17a51ce8544635c4ac38b55e82c87","675a1303a8eb05e53ff63ff3d94aec6a321e057a","b026a1afdcf9cc725df20590ee9c29792f3b0861","476b42d55d74f21702dbd273b6eea42fd2f2c01b","d5b140d1eff61c02cbb8627fce43d8a65632af0c","290005003493580de20787dad81c4fb51aa8c84a","c5a52ec066dd2582b6898f50383643ef7b1c01d4","46d40b79fe68fb4f171c905035587654a1ed0117","842c093fc3343420b134abd575668d2868230c77","a0ca95485d068a5efbf17b68b7e105f4ebcb0ba9","ce77b0f95629539ade342301e4444162421aa2ec","46273e30668ca3c485b0009d5a23a1fe44a33f56","b5dba7d6f8298ce2798eb2e724a96b97ead87f0b","043beedf6417406f53575f74c920a814d06db086","2d41f138ca44227bb44d143a7998fd0467b6e115"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Projections of the ethnic minority populations of the United Kingdom 2006-2056.","doi":"10.1111/j.1728-4457.2010.00342.x","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1728-4457.2010.00342.x","venue":"Population and development review"}

Each year, 1.3 to 5.3 million women in the United States experience IPV. The large number of individuals affected, the enormous healthcare costs, and the need for a multidisciplinary approach make IPV an important healthcare issue. The Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) addresses domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking. It emphasizes development of coordinated community care among law enforcement, prosecutors, victim services, and attorneys. VAWA was not reauthorized in 2012 because it lacked bipartisan support. VAWA 2013 contains much needed new provisions for Native Americans; lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, gay, and queer (LGBTQ) individuals; and victims of human trafficking but does not address the large amount of intimate partner violence in America's immigrant population. There are important remaining issues regarding intimate partner violence that need to be addressed by future legislation. This review examines the role of legislation and addresses proposals for helping victims of IPV.","inCitations":["4a1fd5daa4de8738bdb342d50a63a2e4b888379d","d1dab3f5959e74f0d49b5a164cf2c56d4992b265","5c9334bf44d694682c6063d6b8abed7c877a73bc","c0f4eb6593b4071925bd981819b8840504581169","04e8e4a7db6a1f930f232685c6571f215c89bb8e","8aa83d7a4e1a70e3a95e0c75e431ddebbd5014e2","19baca4dd2da8a2f1236467777eea46589e42b7d","30d45aba05660502fa7d8e722b746fd9c4c9bdc8","b321417721578552ada93e05ef18eb34d76d2235","e964f8ac97d802262c3e98f23c040ef2df43f485","046977cbd4f050a0391deb0ff333ba01c658cf54","81645ff348ffdda33e1eee83e81b48e5ef07c414","9101ad11157130d743cb1880e8a5742ed80e6555","da167ebe4d618b6a9667ec7d1d627c4f3f78c04b","211fa052d7df676ccd17fe57e930d09f2053cdbe","45e3af3d401de72076849e493e9ce860b12925d6","c18a772aac89264c97708b6496d9fb3ba108668d","799b11f5a8a9bde299eba780f2a2968853dc1eda","bf94097ac19eaab5be51909e03977883b517c654","119f7d3507541d2b3d573fef1eb6d4349cc15ee7","a6b5faa362e244f84f69112a1cde3d7b09341160","3fa79a8dd8cb86e086a4dd4bd04bbcf8e3f11596","e4511d07a4197aa947b3a9abe52449e8a5fd6c39","ecd19b0e76b2d1e41b81d22f0a6af87161170d37","206cc9a32b4c11985df6decf515b5f6981fcf392","1daa3a1e106e656ab7aeeff1af92b32d6922043e","1a13a8a0c8eec2401e6efa5cfe966fccd97105f3","2a4762c9a93e38322dc9ad6848380095794973eb","f15627065f6f19c393b6dbc669e0f761540476a0","daeee941cb15d520d0488362238cb279cf035989"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"The role of Violence Against Women Act in addressing intimate partner violence: a public health issue.","doi":"10.1089/jwh.2013.4387","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1089/jwh.2013.4387","venue":"Journal of women's health"}

This is particular true for the Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS) where the modulation techniques are optimized towards environments that are difficult to reproduce (e.g., ship to plane, plane to satellite communications). Such cases necessitate a wireless channel emulator to facilitate testing in the laboratory as the protocols are being developed. Furthermore, the increasing complexity of communications protocols and highly variable network scenarios force the channel emulator to support an accurate and complicated channel model that can scale to handle a large number of radios that operate across a wide frequency spectrum. We developed a unique channel impairment emulator prototype to meet these requirements. It maximizes the scalability and performance, operating in a frequency range of 2 MHz to 2 GHz. Moreover, our emulator design accommodates radio operation that use unknown frequency hopping techniques, which is increasingly common in JTRS systems. This key feature to this system is a high throughput channel tracker module that handles high bandwidth intermediate frequency (IF) signals while providing the scalability to handle a large number of channels.","inCitations":["f249f2c92541ba7774924f8a49407640a671308c","51ed907120a2b5d390040a2188251ee0e1317bd0","7a8ba8903f832db993ae01789e6d2aff6698c234","397ed388ad75fb3eb392b618f0ab1a3b6ab9bc7e"],"pdfUrls":["http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~jmatai/presentations/FPL2014.pdf","http://kastner.ucsd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/admin/fpl14-channel_emulator.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1109/FPL.2014.6927410"],"title":"High throughput channel tracking for JTRS wireless channel emulation","doi":"10.1109/FPL.2014.6927410","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FPL.2014.6927410","venue":"2014 24th International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications (FPL)"}

Four of them were newly employed workers. At regular time intervals the workers were equipped with a personal air sampler and cadmium concentrations in blood and in urine were measured. The total airborne concentration of cadmium at the different work places was very high. The median values ranged from 110 to 2125 μg/m3. In view of the hygiene practice of the workers, ingestion of cadmium may also have played a role in the overall exposure. After the start of the exposure, cadmium concentration in blood increases linearly up to 120 days and then levels off. This suggests that when equilibrium is reached cadmium level in blood is a good indicator of the average intake during recent months. The interpretation of the cadmium levels in urine is more complex. In seven workers exposed for more than 250 days cadmium level in urine seemed to reflect mainly current exposure. Our results suggest also the existence of three phases in the evolution of the Cd levels in urine after the onset of high exposure. A first phase of very short duration (0–15 days) is observed during which cadmium level in urine increases rapidly to reach a value of about 15 μg/g creatinine. This is followed by a second phase (15–120 days) during which cadmium level in urine increases more slowly. After 120 days there is apparently a rapid increase of the cadmium level in urine (third phase). The results obtained during this study as well as our previous clinical observations on workers exposed to cadmium lead us to propose a tentative biological threshold of 10 μg Cd/g urinary creatinine. It should be stressed that this proposal applies only to adult males occupationally exposed to cadmium and not necessarily to other groups of the general population.","inCitations":["fa2fb6aa5be3db60f552ec3b5d29bd52ffed695b","7626f0466f053f6eadf5cffad628efaae6fe59a2","9ae149514aa9a56d1f2b3dffa56ba949d13f6204","af97ac68433979701b5490615166033ce5ed57e8","a82b9ac998203fc71bbaee32aea506d3906a6dd2","8711cf36d76aa91ccb2791392de569edd0a5786b","5e518a02e1343e626bb7dfdf2057763348f9cd81","6f3d71b77a6597e43f2a5bc6d41109ce5bc7014b","17f7c02f65e7b8ccb3c2c5103aaecd0c57a584fa","471ae89d68f8736f84f3384586c77a5cde7bc04b","d46c8a04962de795dd561808a59aace0e4d8deea","452eecab6bc44447626f4ebda7c6c93014545fcc","9e20a154f102f12c04aeffb7c0e922a3b186ccdc","34b2d470296c0e13e27858a4551a4136a50cd707","79fe5eab2ec14381c45d9b5cfb2d5fb47f6619d9","bdbfc9d0b0512c683e292bf3fbb6b6cb5068ebd7","b500f11ce68cc1aa6ed5f6672c6774fde44e09fc","3fdeab926662dc03f7f4860639a607b039c34a4c","12dd56c679ece9b1975271d86b11bde11935ba76","d9f0fd0b8435babb0b258c094748845d41070e6e","695dfb55cee48c3bbb29fb8d0d190c83ece4a545","62efd73da2e34569da82b28825b9f72a4672af9d","ec1857509d1e4a1f72106cbde4d7b802b005255a","7a50bdc052cc326c56d56626fde9578e34821d2c","814b24c1451720a8c4d353b7e8646d99a717e417","8559443d0c1dda0e813c92bb1543e0f657278457","8500b5d2be4e567e672f23dad8fa4c7e250b6621","493affb103dcdf455e63e6c7cedc2c4c94219196","4ce3e749d440b857d9565271160aad8f024f9e9d","e41df54c618cf8f4fc39a70117fe4595afccf7f9","fff2ba74570aad133752d92503554f8d48fbf5f4","ac882f437db92c5d869daec0ba627e82f40680b1","21d889a3572523c37b24538470f2fd899e35a0aa","b195f678658700e906ac0dda334944860e9b617b"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Significance of cadmium concentration in blood and in urine in workers exposed to cadmium.","doi":"10.1016/0013-9351(79)90014-8","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/0013-9351%2879%2990014-8","venue":"Environmental research"}

Although bacterial products translocate systemically in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)-infected Asian macaques, several studies have shown that MAIT cell frequencies actually decrease in peripheral blood during the course of HIV/SIV disease. However, the mechanisms underlying this proportional decline remain unclear. In this study, we characterized the phenotype, activation status, functionality, distribution, and clonotypic structure of MAIT cell populations in the peripheral blood, liver, mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs), jejunum, and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid of healthy and SIV-infected rhesus macaques (RMs). Low frequencies of MAIT cells were observed in the peripheral blood, MLNs, and BAL fluid of SIV-infected RMs. These numerical changes were coupled with increased proliferation and a highly public T cell receptor alpha (TCRα) repertoire in the MAIT cell compartment without redistribution to other anatomical sites. Collectively, our data show systemically decreased frequencies of MAIT cells likely attributable to enhanced turnover in SIV-infected RMs. This process may impair protective immunity against certain opportunistic infections with progression to AIDS.\n\n\nIMPORTANCE\nThe data presented in this study reveal for the first time that MAIT cells are systemically depleted in an AIDS virus infection.

NFCI continues to be a major operational hazard for personnel who must perform in cold environments. Despite considerable research, the mechanisms underlying NFCI have remained elusive. The objective of the research described in this report represents the initial efforts to develop an animal model that adequately reflects the symptomatology observed in human NFCI. A salient feature in the post cold exposure manifestation of NFCI in humans is that, following an initial period of sensation loss in the affected limb, an increased, often permanent, thermal sensitivity develops. This is one of the more debilitating aspects of NFCI since personnel are unable to tolerate even minor alterations in temperature of the hands or feet and are thus greatly restricted from performing in inclement weather conditions. In the present study, thermal sensitivity was measured in the tail of adult rats before and after the tail and a portion of the hind flank were exposed to cold (1-4 deg C) or warm (28 deg C) water for one to nine hours.

The catalyst is usually in the form of a coated layer on a specific substrate. The service life of catalyst products depends greatly on the strength of the coated layer. In reality, coated layers have been found to fail in both a cohesive and an adhesive way (Yang et al. [ 1 , 2 ]). In contrast to the importance of the strength of these coated layers, there has not been any strength measurement technique that can separately measure the adhesive strength of the coated layer reported in the literature. To address this, the current paper presents a novel technique that is capable of separately measuring the adhesive strength of such coated layer in a reproducible manner. Coated layers were prepared by drying a suspension of γ-alumina particles at set conditions on various substrates followed by calcination. The particle size and pH of the suspension were known. Three different substrates were employed to prepare the coated layer, which were FeCrAlloy, cordierite and alumina. The adhesive strength of the coated layer was found to be influenced by the surface and the structure profile of substrates and the pH of the γ-alumina suspension.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Adhesive strength measurement of catalyst support","doi":"10.1016/j.powtec.2018.09.044","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.powtec.2018.09.044","venue":""}

More precisely, analytical methods for ER determination have changed over the last two decades from ligand binding assay (LBA) dextran-coated charcoal (DCC) to enzyme immuno-assay (EIA) and more recently immunohistochemistry (IHC). We examined the respective clinical impact of ER determination according to these 3 methods over the period 1983–1999 within a group of 1940 patients, all operated and followed in the single institution Centre Antoine Lacassagne. Validated cut off values were 10 and 15 fmol/mg protein for both LBA-DCC and EIA, respectively and 10% of stained cells for IHC. During the years it was noted that the initial size of the tumor decreased and that the proportion of positive axillary nodes and negative ER tumors was different according to the ER method. ER negativity was 20, 13 and 10% in LBA-DCC, EIA, IHC, respectively. ER was a strong predictor of overall survival in the whole population (Mantel-Cox, p<0.00001); however when stratifying the analysis on ER method groups, ER was still a prognostic indicator in the EIA, LBA-DCC group but not in the IHC group (the follow-up was too short). It is important to keep these data in mind when conducting large retrospective studies evaluating prognostic markers in breast cancer patients.","inCitations":["be6cb717a9682b2ae7f7c70b9c89f275380904c6","4e6768f70dd2a7949fbfe9f26cc04a53872e0d3f","5be23eb45b108312f4464816825a38ae347af322","bcb575d3a0815f1ce7c11827a81ee8f18986b475","90f731797c6d157d4d1677fa8071396ae06a4625","0ed51142fcf732505fea0fecc3c87ee95e146955","4e1f539811578bb6d4e8f7ec3ce1182e4aee0df1"],"pdfUrls":["https://page-one.springer.com/pdf/preview/10.1007/s10549-005-9065-z"],"title":"Different clinical impact of estradiol receptor determination according to the analytical method: a study on 1940 breast cancer patients over a period of 16 consecutive years","doi":"10.1007/s10549-005-9065-z","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10549-005-9065-z","venue":"Breast Cancer Research and Treatment"}

At equilibrium the intracellular dimethylsulfoxide concentration is 70–85%, the l -xylose concentration about 40% of that in the medium. In anaerobically grown yeast, lacking intracellular membranous structures, the same equilibrium concentrations are reached as in normal yeast. 2. 2. Both l -xylose and dimethylsulfoxide are present inside the cells in an osmotically active form. 3. 3. The osmotic response of yeast cells in hypertonic NaCl solutions shows a deviation from ideal osmotic behavior. The deviation could be explained by increase of the number of intracellular particles in hypertonic salt solutions and by elasticity forces in the cell wall, causing some reduction of the cellular volume with a connected increase in the intracellular tonicity. 4. 4. With equilibrium dialysis on disintegrated cells, it could be shown that there exists no bound water or exclusion water with respect to l -xylose and dimethylsulfoxide in the yeast cell. 5. 5.

Recombination signal-binding protein Jκ (RBPJ) is a key transcription factor downstream of receptor activation in Notch signaling pathway. Here, we evaluated the effects of RBPJ inhibition on the growth of lung cancer cells. We found that a short hairpin interfering RNA (shRNA) for RBPJ efficiently inhibited RBPJ expression in lung cancer cells, resulting in a significant decrease in the cell growth. Further analyses showed that RBPJ inhibition altered the levels of its downstream targets, including p21, p27, CDK2, Hes1, Bcl-2, and SKP2, to prevent the cells from growing. Our data thus suggest that shRNA intervention of RBPJ expression could be a promising therapeutic approach for treating human lung cancer.","inCitations":["772ca119eba4a99d7387fc62306761cb0d3f415a","0eb2b8bf8090dc85d60d8f73ac17e6f95ad59647","520c2ba30ecebc013d7d32b051900793f77a37bf","6b18728f73abdbe3c30df06f0e914fad18d64eed","f764fe7c1aab088c7b3bba6c79512b678195af94","a871e546b81f60119e6522c5549494d494d799f5","71ee148ed43e6885ad7f2d6e4294c66a1b36ea1a","3da4119f86caefc0a61ac27946f8a370477098aa","2551afe0d810825c1de3e9e30894410a3660e8f1","8063634da54f451c638ded9011a708dc67a81334","c59a16aa764ae7c617582d6ec7df02ff3ef9f016","a2daef889c975c7dedee38eecaeba44d4c961db4","c3f9b8da0ae2f7ac5005e31143489b2b2c1033d0","4405f9dd6692bb275f34f3d9a1ef00b6d88ee5a7","7237fa5399749972804502eda0fc79f4207ec4ef","0f82f20742f18637f06e8df0fc3d91cc5149d0a8","680dab3769e5f2ff8586d301faf89b1d0d9d8c8e"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"RBPJ inhibition impairs the growth of lung cancer","doi":"10.1007/s13277-014-3015-5","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s13277-014-3015-5","venue":"Tumor Biology"}

Mutations in human DDP1 cause the Mohr-Tranebjaerg syndrome (MTS/DFN-1; OMIM #304700), which is one of the two known human diseases of the mitochondrial protein import machinery. We created a Tim23 knockout mouse from a gene trap embryonic stem cell clone. Homozygous Tim23 mice were not viable. Heterozygous F1 mutants showed a 50% reduction of Tim23 protein in Western blot, a neurological phenotype and a markedly reduced life span. Haploinsufficiency of the Tim23 mutation underlines the critical role of the mitochondrial import machinery for maintaining mitochondrial function.","inCitations":["f6d98fd63704f60bdc4b228577067c60ba6fa4bc","9520458608d9cf1b3adc1808127ee5fec37c648b","8d25066f1976f7b2dbc54256add2c7fcfdae7c0c","f38719491b4ae04aa57908db497ae81dd9f84369","934e2f81f11ace09dd1dd54339098f062aa5db58","036387ee00da26f2134287b9fd949a5ba4c8fd6c","f14a2a21f567d03f45cdf2e0801dd2d538acc9d7","08c1d6998b0c0feafa829eaf13822b03744432bd","22d687de2dd92a22b182d93afd493f8fa81be978","3a0737f0ffe4587ba431d2b6ea51db2b90416c02","d4a25001f59abc3a1806f3a62c4f02a3df3e51b9","3db8695ecaadcad66519c0388f74127c00e516ae","6bc8537f4c09228e9a435e744782b87bb8fa8a8a","95f1facb25a1f0d96ed8f8738ea0f0e264259218"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Neurological phenotype and reduced lifespan in heterozygous Tim23 knockout mice, the first mouse model of defective mitochondrial import.","doi":"10.1016/j.bbabio.2008.12.001","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbabio.2008.12.001","venue":"Biochimica et biophysica acta"}

Laws were called laws, the person in charge of foreign relations was called Foreign minister, the primacy of European law was expressly recognised and it was agreed that fundamental rights were to be made visible and operational in a legally binding form. Nevertheless, it was quite clear to everybody that the EU continued to be a supranational organisation and was not developed into a beast which could be qualified as a ‘super-state’, or to which could be attributed any kind of statehood.","inCitations":["8d13c47705fd8199b5819556978cf1d076770e89","56a370e8a50746f79f75511c552b7f4345b4d627","41f4d5692f34a0d508a87c8093e1dad6c24b6c80"],"pdfUrls":["http://idpbarcelona.net/docs/actividades/seminarioue/aida_torres.pdf","http://www.whi-berlin.eu/documents/whi-paper0708.pdf"],"title":"The Treaty of Lisbon and Fundamental Rights","doi":"10.1007/978-3-211-09429-7_10","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-211-09429-7_10","venue":""}

The available actions that may be taken are selection of the next relative target-platform orientation and the next sensor to be deployed. The target is modeled in terms of a set of states, each state representing a contiguous set of targetsensor orientations over which the scattering physics is relatively stationary. The sequence of states sampled at multiple targetsensor orientations may be modeled as a Markov process. The sensor only has access to the scattered fields, without knowledge of the particular state being sampled, and therefore the problem is modeled as apartially observableMarkov decision process (POMDP). The POMDP yields a policy, in which the belief state at any point is mapped to a corresponding action. The nonmyopic policy is compared to an approximate myopic approach, with example results presented for measured underwater acoustic scattering data.","inCitations":["c077882cd1d57f22afdde47ccc57f719d115b2b9","246229e2f61f20a6ec2f9429c98f147399e8c06e","3c26016f29764a242383fff75711af30602cd0a9","c47aedc0f3ee41c81c7a5dd25c9c80171dd49caa","8ef5e9a39f05b96b24038694b9b1c6a3d5018d10","8ea7985290c30e9d03b8e7c13f5697e67ce5af63","79e70b7255996bbe19e39d73b80c0fc10eb20ee7","ef17ce581425651ed0a0fa52bceace9cf43d80bc","6971427e8f616e5e33d24674fa47b7a2ac69c0df","bb546ebdbc0d36630c1b1ce7e5dca95c55d75afb"],"pdfUrls":["http://people.ee.duke.edu/~lcarin/Carin.pdf","https://grid.cs.gsu.edu/~sji/papers/POMDP_TSP.pdf"],"title":"Non-Myopic Multi-Aspect Sensing with Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Yet the examination of pleasure is under-researched, especially within health and health-related areas. We examine pleasure as both an innate drive and a socially constructed phenomenon. Using the development of religious ideas in western cultures, we identify four forms of pleasure: carnal pleasure, disciplined pleasure, ascetic pleasure and ecstatic pleasure. These pleasures dramatically affect the construction of social and cultural identities. Moreover, they influence approaches to our understandings of health in general and interventions to public health in particular. The pursuit of the study of pleasure opens up a number of worthwhile areas for cross-disciplinary discussion and study.","inCitations":["fc851298b7e5455a144de0b4a4c22daf21dbdcf3","3d3074a447f0379484cac865431b06a8f60158d7","8fe3ea3fa037aeed30b201c949a4c801b792ba9f","e1b9753c9ba1d9a392e3b26f732648c145fcb708","0cc9e1e2852ca6be3f6e9b532597ef2aab5efd12","fe9ad6834c28a597946dbea8fb4bc66a4c8b7d14","dcfade20acd61dc842ec739f78f98f73cc8fb278","3aa15ad16b75d8587c650ad1751a7f3531c050bb","0882ce36812bf61c6137be555a517d9196a6b874","e017078dd6841f487a61041586caa7e2d35773ba","f64f13b714a222bd1fab470a5d49e1339cda3d32","c3aaf3fbafb4f41cf02ad96e325fe783f135928a","5d2b7c7f705ff719a1179b20c0e177c2423fbc75","06f730f67a864a49a34aade80df1112e656a1332","f313327ca7a5a839c35628e621af278b5bf64645","d8b55b47524d25173621294d7a17ae86a3cdc90c","3f77b6298256ba9ebd60344bd72589afe473d9dd","668ae56cb5675c21be26b2349a9d50803fbe4b26","d32a376ec8dda15d21654f7da3790fced4bd6e27","46c77dc1b1e22c033b64cfed4ee6e60f4136cce1","dfb0c7efc603d30c837b95edc6c930b47f6d32b8","caba133d7876742816c2c85a4bcd31f0671cc4dd","0097ef23376569a0f8b16177d3b027c601f70c00","4d5d8db3da47e218baca02fc5d3f3624c2f62ef5","e40860065e1346de65e2a07342a01502df2bbf54","fe268d0b6ab50e189ab014e382f6b02628662704","0f287df026878a0ab55fa33579c180565b52c910","e504e3c15a765a1d438beac42151a5d82c16ae8e","bd3fb4e1cd6db4fc0a82b9f54e62c5cf7211b764","56495a64590bbb178f0b08ff927c34d1432a922f","4dd59999b30606b9ae37146de669f2b5c84af190","289ac765cae3674a72d698a1084aeec38d6e669d","41132f3a0c8910801fd5f97f1f67ddc2da04b2d2","4ff495b146fc2b20f1237fe712098f7f22925bd1","35d75c6cd54efd8d9de232b9be4ad5c09063ca62","22e715df583b41a2749cbee1485967ad434bb05f","91fdf0a55bb5faf4f849b3f6dac24372c8d617cb","77e85bf4b6f1488c1ba5884f35f7331474be0de5","644799e5cdba843806bfd1cf855201d0607278a6","76ae9f2fd08f66c021e08740f7e61ec6641c08fa","b4582b9cbe35cb85d94827845b9bc26fdbc58e4c","c58856b2e2cb03f7953e38960db7842077996a7b","51b2167b75f1ae05824efdb67c3cc02f566509f6","6a740064508c88346d24659f0dbb31e057c2d2cd","d051c9d388dd7f2a0c5f291b8f4d3bc876ad5f9d"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"In Pursuit of the Study of Pleasure: Implications for Health Research and Practice:","doi":"10.1177/1363459303007002873","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1177/1363459303007002873","venue":""}

The increase in COX2 gene expression of cultured chondrocytes in response to TNFa was counteracted by DHA (p<0.05) and oleic acid (p<0.05). MMP1 expression was also increased in response to TNFa and this effect was counteracted by oleic acid (p<0.05) and palmitic acid (p<0.05). GAG release by cartilage explants was decreased when cultured in oleic acid (p<0.05). Gene expression of MMP3, MMP13 and ADAMTS4 in cell cultures and NO production by cartilage explants did not significantly change in response to any fatty acid. Exposure of chondrocytes and explants to linoleic acid (n-6) in absence or presence of TNFa did not influence any of the parameters measured. Conclusions: DHA (n-3), oleic acid (n-9), and palmitic acid (saturated) are able to counteract some of the effects induced by TNFa in cartilage explants or chondrocyte cultures. This was already known for DHA, but reported for the first time for oleic acid and palmitic acid. Since fatty acids influence inflammation and degradation of cartilage, they can be regarded potential therapeutic targets in OA prevention and treatment. Figure1.

Nieuwenhuizen, R.E. Schutgens, G. Roosendaal, S.C. Mastbergen, D.H. Biesma, F.P. Lafeber. Univ. Med. Ctr. Utrecht, Utrecht, Netherlands Purpose: Osteoarthritis (OA) and Rheumatoid Arthrisis (RA) are characterized by degradation of the cartilage. Proteases of the coagulation cascade and the fibrinolytic system, such as thrombin and plasmin, are elevated in both plasma and synovial fluid of OA and RA patients and are able to induce cartilage degradation. Cross-talking between coagulation and inflammation is mediated by protease-activated-receptors (PARs), which are expressed at increased level in OA and RA cartilage. These receptors are activated through cleavage by serine proteases, such as thrombin and plasmin. RNA interference is a process inwhich genes can be silenced sequence-specific. This can be invoked by transfection of tissue/ cells with small interfering RNA (siRNA). Our aimwas to study whether the thrombinand plasmin-induced cartilage damage in human cartilage was PAR-dependent. Methods: Full-thickness OA human articular cartilage tissue was obtained during total knee surgery. Slices of cartilage were cut aseptically from the articular surface. Within 1 hour of dissection the slices were cut into square pieces, weighed aseptically (range, 5.0 to 15.0 mg) and each sample was individually put into culture. Cartilage was cultured for 4 days in the presence of different concentrations thrombin (10, 30, or 100nM), or plasmin (10, 30, or 100nM). In addition, cartilage was transfected with PAR1-4 small interfering RNA (600nM) or control siRNA (600nM), and cultured with thrombin (100nM) or plasmin (100nM). Cartilage matrix turnover, in terms of proteoglycan release, was determined at day 4. To investigate the silencing effect of the siRNA transfection, cartilage RNA was extracted and PAR1-4 mRNA expression was analyzed with RT-PCR. Results: Thrombin and plasmin increased proteoglycan release in human cartilage in a dose-dependent and statistically significant manner (500% for thrombin at 100nM; 217% for plasmin at 100nM). Thrombinand plasmin-induced proteoglycan release was statistically significant reduced with PAR1-4 siRNA (60% for thrombin at 100nM; 54% for plasmin at 100nM). Control siRNA failed to reduce thrombinand plasmin-induced proteoglycan release. Transfectionwith PAR1-4 siRNA resulted in complete suppression of PAR1-4 mRNA expression, whereas no effect of control siRNA on PAR1-4 mRNA expression was noted. Conclusions: These results demonstrate for the first time that thrombin and plasmin-induced proteoglycan release in human cartilage is PARdependent and offer promise for the use of siRNA as a new strategy for therapeutic intervention in OA and RA. 231 BONE SIALOPROTEIN : A KEY MEDIATOR OF THE ANGIOGENIC ACTIVITY OF HYPERTROPHIC OSTEOARTHRITIC CHONDROCYTES L. Pesesse , C. Sanchez , C. Baudouin , P. Msika , Y. Henrotin . Univ. of Liege, Liege, Belgium; 2 Laboratoires ExpanSci., IRD Direction, Epernon, France Purpose: Hypertrophic differentiation of chondrocytes in osteoarthritis (OA) is a pathological process leading to vascularization and mineralization of the cartilage. The pathogenesis of OA is thought to reiterate changes that occur during endochondral ossification in which angiogenesis is required to initiate chondrocyte hypertrophic differentiation. We previously demonstrated that Bone Sialoprotein (BSP) production is associated with chondrocyte hypertrophy and the severity of osteoarthritic lesions. In this work, we investigated the impact of hypertrophic differentiation on the chondrocytes capacity to promote vascularization. We also speculated that BSP is a key mediator of cartilage vascularization. Methods: In alginate beads, OA chondrocytes cultured in the presence of serum undergo hypertrophic differentiation in long-term culture. Using this model, we tested the effects of hypertrophic chondrocytes conditioned medium after 24 hours serum deprivation on the invasion and migration of endothelial cells using two different models : the real-time follow-up of the cells performed with the xCELLigence system (Roche) and high-end microscopic analysis of living endothelial cells in a wound healing assay. We also studied BSP gene expression (by RT-PCR) and production (by western blot) during chondrocyte hypertrophic differentiation. The effects of IL-1b (170 pg/ml) and TNFa (25 ng/ml) were tested on the synthesis of BSP by hypertrophic chondrocytes. These cytokines were added to the culture medium before (day 7) or after (day 21) hypertrophic phenotype was reached. Finally, the effect of increased concentration of recombinant BSP (25 ng/ml to 400 ng/ml) on the production of a proangiogenic factor, interleukin-8 (IL8) and an anti-angiogenic factor, thrombospondin-1 (TSP1) was studied by immunoassays. Results: Hypertrophic OA chondrocytes conditionned medium showed a higher stimulating effect on endothelial cells migration and invasion than serum-containing medium (positive control). We demonstrated that BSP gene expression and protein productionwere associated with markers of hypertrophy collagen type 10 (COL X), alkaline phosphatase (AP), nucleoside triphosphate pyrophosphohydrolase (NTPPPH) in OA but this association was not observed in normal chondrocyte cultures. IL-1b or TNFa in the culture medium decreased gene expression of BSP when added at day 7 or at day 21 (p<0.05).

To address the challenges, this paper presents a robust event-stream object tracking method based on correlation filter mechanism and convolutional neural network (CNN) representation. In the proposed method, rate coding is used to encode the event-stream object. Feature representations from hierarchical convolutional layers of a pre-trained CNN are used to represent the appearance of the rate encoded event-stream object. Results prove that the proposed method not only achieves good tracking performance in many complicated scenes with noise events, complex background textures, occlusion, and intersected trajectories, but also is robust to variable scale, variable pose, and non-rigid deformations. In addition, the correlation filter-based method has the advantage of high speed. The proposed approach will promote the potential applications of these event-based vision sensors in autonomous driving, robots and many other high-speed scenes.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.3389/fnbot.2019.00082"],"title":"Robust Event-Based Object Tracking Combining Correlation Filter and CNN Representation","doi":"10.3389/fnbot.2019.00082","sources":["Medline","DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.3389/fnbot.2019.00082","venue":"Front.

An extremely high abundance of helium (Y ~ 0.4) allows for a working hypothesis, but its origin is unclear. Peng & Nagai proposed that primordial helium sedimentation in dark halos over cosmic timescales may lead to extreme helium abundances in galaxy cluster centers. In this scenario, UV upturn should be restricted to brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) only. This is a clear and testable prediction. We present tests of this hypothesis using galaxy clusters from Yoon et al. that were detected by both the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and the Galaxy Evolution Explorer Medium Imaging Survey. Using a new UV classification scheme based on far-UV, near-UV, and optical photometry we found that only 5% of cluster elliptical galaxies show a UV upturn, while 27% and 68% are classified as \"recent star formation\" and \"UV-weak\" ellipticals, respectively. The data reveal a modest positive dependence of the UV upturn fraction on galaxy velocity dispersion, which is in agreement with the earlier findings of Burstein et al. and possibly with the helium sedimentation theory. However, we do not see any dependency on rank or luminosity of galaxies. Besides, BCGs do not show any marked difference in UV upturn fraction or strength, which is inconsistent with the prediction. We conclude that the aforementioned helium sedimentation theory and its inferred environmental effects are not supported by the available data.","inCitations":["ddd8e0e771b7a4867c4ce660b5e099bcbbec2836"],"pdfUrls":["https://arxiv.org/pdf/1107.0005v1.pdf"],"title":"The Ultraviolet Upturn in Elliptical Galaxies and Environmental Effects","doi":"10.1088/0067-0049/195/2/22","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1088/0067-0049%2F195%2F2%2F22","venue":""}

These arcs follow the traces of a series of confocal parabolas and are interpreted as arising from two-dimensional channelling effects associated with the excitation of waves propagating along the lattice planes perpendicular to the crystal surfaces. Investigations have been made on the behaviors of these arcs as a function of convergence angle, incident angle and azimuthal angle of the electron beam. These experiments, carried out on a Zeiss 912 transmission electron microscope operated at 120 kV with an Omega energy filter, show that the arcs are produced from the elastic scattering of primary electrons, rather than from the inelastic plasmon scattering or thermal diffuse scattering. The continuity of these arcs and their relative intensities provide evidence that there is no interference between the electrons channelling in adjacent lattice planes.","inCitations":["9970eeb7c336617c15cc749519ea5e1899a0d253"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Electron channelling effects at high incident angles in convergent beam reflection high energy electron diffraction","doi":"10.1016/0304-3991(94)90056-6","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/0304-3991%2894%2990056-6","venue":""}

However, the possibility of standardizing interruption levels on the sympathetic chain has not yet been evaluated. This study sought to evaluate the frequency of compensatory sweating and the recurrence and satisfaction rates after bilateral R4-R5 video-assisted thoracoscopic sympathicotomy in patients with primary focal hyperhidrosis with involvement of the axillary, palmar, or both regions. \nMethods: From November 2010 to February 2013, an observational prospective cohort study was conducted with 42 patients who underwent bilateral video-assisted thoracoscopic sympathicotomy. During the procedure, electrocautery was performed along the sympathetic chain at the levels R4-R5, and the nerve of Kuntz and the path between levels R4-R5 were also sectioned. \nResults: No cases in which the video-assisted thoracoscopy had to be converted to thoracotomy were observed. Compensatory sweating was observed in 47.6% of patients within the first six months after surgery, decreasing to 30.9% at the end of this period. Hyperhidrosis recurrence occurred in only two patients. In total, 24.1% of patients with associated plantar hyperhidrosis reported that the condition disappeared after surgery. The satisfaction rate was 89.7% in the immediate postoperative period. \nConclusions: The frequency of compensatory sweating, the recurrence rate of symptoms and the satisfaction rate after sectioning by cauterization with electrocautery at the R4-R5 levels were similar to those reported for other types of interruption and other levels studied. Moreover, the interruption level adopted also had beneficial effects on plantar hyperhidrosis.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Prospective Analysis of Patients with Axillary, Palmar and Axillary-Palmar Hyperhidrosis who Underwent Bilateral R4-R5 Video-Assisted Thoracoscopic Sympathicotomy","doi":"10.7438/1584-9341-11-1-3","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.7438/1584-9341-11-1-3","venue":""}

However, it is often challenging to implement oxidative reactions at scale due to the low activity and stability of the biocatalyst under industrial conditions. Consequently, it becomes critical to identify the bottlenecks for specific oxidation reactions as a first step in scale-up. Subsequently, we can identify where research the effort is required when developing a biocatalytic reaction for implementation in an industrial reaction, i.e., on biocatalyst development (e.g. improvement of expression levels), process development (e.g. improved oxygen supply, product removal strategies) or biocatalyst stabilization (e.g. through immobilization or directed evolution). This paper presents a systematic method to identify the bottleneck of a potential biocatalytic process using a monoamine oxidase to synthesize an intermediate in the manufacture of a drug for treating Hepatitis C (Telaprevir).","inCitations":["0a85108ed7ad950a6bd7f81559cbc3bd43cc7416","b91530d0907eb8a423e12b1cecf8ae3f179b4796","ee4029b6baa61871a7d75026cd379a0f77b2df59","6e11b2cc5b2e69200e266e845dc5febb07a284bc"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Process characterization of a monoamine oxidase","doi":"10.1016/j.molcatb.2014.04.009","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molcatb.2014.04.009","venue":""}

Incorporating these constraints in an analytically tractable manner continues to be longstanding open challenge. This is because the optimization problem that results from Signal to Interference plus Noise Ratio (SINR) maximization subject to these constraints is a hard non-convex problem. We develop a new analytical approach that involves solving a sequence of convex Quadratic Constrained Quadratic Programming (QCQP) problems, which we prove converges to a sub-optimal solution. We call the method Successive QCQP Refinement (SQR). We evaluate SQR against state of the art in its SINR performance for a practical scenario and show that it outperforms existing methods without incurring a significant computational burden.","inCitations":["7c60ef3c1c8ca34f28d22344ca8af56b132253dc","1b97bfd6a955e44c24afce321439dc1e34e7964f","08d15c14c01bcd6951fe5e582700619171edba7f","b79c1dc7b3dfdf36a081c2e0e38392e9dca1e390"],"pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1109/ACSSC.2015.7421087"],"title":"SQR: Successive QCQP refinement for MIMO radar waveform design under practical constraints","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.2015.7421087","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACSSC.2015.7421087","venue":"2015 49th Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers"}

To date, the focus of air modeling has been to establish the effects of process emissions after they leave the plant, or on the effect of exposures to employees over various time intervals, assuming particular concentrations. Most current techniques are not readily adaptable to assess potential emissions from process changes. The available techniques generally need empirical concentration data to perform the modeling. This paper will examine the strengths and weaknesses of various modeling techniques used for estimating process emissions. Building on this information, a framework will be developed to assist in predicting process emissions that does not rely on empirical data and would therefore be of use in process design. The analysis of a procedure to incorporate process changes, or design a new process, comprises many factors. Currently, many facilities are considering process changes driven by environmental and health regulations. Incorporating changes that improve the facilities’ environmental, health or safety performance can, if implemented properly, also benefit productivity. 1-3 By implementing a pollution prevention program to reduce waste emissions of all media, or the raw material usage, facilities can meet the goals specified by the regulations, with minimal impact on profitability and often actual improvement of the bottom line. Title V of the Clean Air Act and OSHA Permissible Exposure Limits (PEL) are drivers focused on air emissions. Effective modeling of process air emissions is extremely important if facilities are to meet the goals specified by these regulations. Determining applicability to Title V, which triggers the requirement to prepare a Part 70 permit application, requires a detailed assessment of the facility emissions. Applicability is based on the facility’s “potential to emit,” that is, the facility’s theoretical maximum emissions from all sources. Failure to accurately assess emissions can cast doubt","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://www.nmfrc.org/pdf/p0198i.pdf"],"title":"Alternatives in Air Emission Modeling for Characterization of Processes & Process Change","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Two regimes of rapid chilling were applied: treatment 1 (at –31°C in the first 3 h of chilling, and then at 2–4°C till 8 h post-mortem) and treatment 2 (at –31°C in the first 3 h of chilling, and then at 2–4°C till 24 h post-mortem). Microbiological sampling of pork carcasses was obtained by swabbing. Swab samples were analyzed for total aerobic count and for Enterobacteriaceae. Rapid chilling did not affect (P > 0.05) total aerobic counts on surface of pork carcasses. Chilling treatment 1 did not significantly decrease (P > 0.05) the Enterobacteriaceae count, while chilling treatment 2 highly significant decreased (P = 0.001) the Enterobacteriaceae count on the surface of pork carcasses. Based on the results found in this study, applied rapid chilling regime can reduce the number of carcasses positive for the presence of Enterobacteriaceae.","inCitations":["082bec4ac31281b39d2935386d7afeb2c6c2ecb4"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.rombio.eu/rbl6vol16/11%20Vladimir%20Tomovic.pdf"],"title":"Rapid chilling effect on the bacterial populations of pork carcasses","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

The policy focused on changing the fare structure basis, in particular switching from a zonal to a flat-fare scheme. The goal of the study is to determine how the policy affected the traveling behavior of different public transport user groups and what equity implications it brought. Altogether, these insights could be transformed into lessons for designing a more advanced evaluation approach and future policy-making.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://repository.tudelft.nl/islandora/object/uuid:10f4e699-f44e-4f5b-b9c3-0d910966f7a5/datastream/OBJ/download"],"title":"Evaluation of public transport fare policy using smartcard data: Travel patterns change and distributional effects in Stockholm County","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

vaccines and pharmaceutical drugs for pathogenic gram-negative bacteria. Previous studies of the impacts of the biomedical bleeding process on horseshoe crabs have primarily focused on mortality rates and sublethal impacts, using animals held in the laboratory. Therefore, the first goal of this project was to determine the effects of the bleeding process on horseshoe crab behavior once they are released back into their natural environment. In addition, previous studies have typically only investigated the impacts of the full bleeding procedure, or just hemolymph extraction, on horseshoe crab mortality and behavior. Therefore, my second objective was to determine the relative impacts of the three main stressors (aerial exposure, increased temperatures, and blood loss) on the locomotor activity and hemocyanin levels of horseshoe crabs. Finally, previous studies have demonstrated that horseshoe crabs held in captivity, even if they are not bled, experience a decline in hemocyanin levels. Therefore, the third objective of this study was to test a food supplement that might reduce these sustained decreases in hemocyanin levels, along with the associated behavioral impacts. We found that once horseshoe crabs were released back into their natural habitat there were some immediate differences between bled animals and controls. Bled animals appeared to mate significantly less than control animals within the first week post-release, with the largest differences between bled and control females. However, the only other significant difference we observed between 14 bled and 14 control animals was a tendency for bled animals to remain significantly deeper during the two-year study. Our laboratory studies revealed that the full bleeding procedure typically used commercially (i.e., all three stressors) had the largest impact on mortality, hemocyanin levels, overall activity, and expression of biological rhythms, followed by bleeding along with at least one of the other stressors. We also saw a seasonal trend in hemocyanin levels and a strong, significant relationship between hemocyanin levels and overall activity. Our data also revealed that animals with starting hemocyanin levels of 0.13 mg/mL or less were more likely to die or be impaired by the bleeding process. Therefore, it appears that an awareness of the overall health and hemocyanin levels in animals captured for bleeding might help reduce mortalities and other impacts if companies would avoid using these borderline animals. Another approach might be to use a food supplement to prevent sustained reductions in hemocyanin levels. Our last study showed that animals that were fed had an increase in their hemocyanin levels and overall activity, and maintained the same biological rhythms they had prior to being bled. Therefore, providing dietary supplements to horseshoe crabs either before or after bleeding them might be a logistically realistic way to improve physiological status and maintain a healthy population of this important species. In summary, we saw negative impacts from the biomedical bleeding procedure on the behavior and mortality of horseshoe crabs both in the laboratory in the field. Our data should provide insight into ways that biomedical facilities can modify the process in order to alleviate these issues. Moreover, these data indicate that one approach would be to develop a food supplement that would help animals maintain healthy hemocyanin levels. Given the importance of horseshoe crabs to coastal and estuarine ecosystems, and human health, it is crucial to determine a sustainable practice for bleeding these animals to create LAL.

A transcoder(350) converts the detailed information of the tag configured as the suppliable type according to obtained terminal specification.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"System and method for providing contents using rfid tags","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Berdasarkan hasil studi pendahuluan di SMA Plus Al-Hasan Banjarsari Kabupaten Ciamis, nilai rata-rata kemampuan pemecahan masalah peserta didik masih tergolong rendah. Salah satu alternatif yang dapat digunakan untuk meningkatkan kemampuan pemecahan masalah peserta didik adalah dengan menerapkan model pembelajaran ECIRR (Elicit, Confront, Identify, Resolve, Reinforce). Penelitian ini bertujuan untuk mengetahui keterlaksanaan pembelajaran menggunakan model pembelajaran ECIRR serta peningkatan kemampuan pemecahan masalah peserta didik pada materi fluida statis. Metode yang digunakan dalam penelitian ini adalah pre-experimental design dengan desain one-group pretest-posttest. Sampel pada penelitian ini yaitu kelas XI MIA 1 SMA Plus Al-Hasan Banjarsari Kabupaten Ciamis berjumlah 30 orang yang dipilih menggunakan teknik purposive random sampling. Hasil penelitian menunjukkan rata-rata aktivitas guru sebesar 84% dengan kategori sangat baik dan aktivitas peserta didik sebesar 76% dengan kategori baik. Terdapat peningkatan kemampuan pemecahan masalah peserta didik pada materi fluida statis dengan melihat indeks N-gain sebesar 0,75 yang berkategori tinggi. Hasil perhitungan dengan uji hipotesis menggunakan t-test: paired two sample for means dengan thitung > ttabel (37,03 > 2.042). Dengan demikian model pembelajaran ECIRR dapat dijadikan sebagai alternatif dalam meningkatkan kemampuan pemecahan masalah peserta didik pada materi fluida statis.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://journal.upgris.ac.id/index.php/JP2F/article/download/3543/2470"],"title":"Penerapan Model Pembelajaran ECIRR ( Elicit , Confront , Identify , Resolve , Reinforce ) untuk Meningkatkan Kemampuan","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

The levels of vertical shock accelerations at input points of isolators are as high as 200g or so, however, the peak acceleration loads of the platform isolated by shock isolators are low. The dynamic problems of this structure loaded by strong shock acceleration has not been researched by now, especially, this platform is connected by the hull and the forces are transmitted from frame of ship to it. This paper has demonstrated how to modelling shock responses and considered nonlinear behaviour of isolators at shock environments. A new variable acceleration Impulsive Response Function has been presented and applied to optimization of isolator arrangements.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"The Research of Modelling and Testing of Shock-isolated Ship Gas Turbines","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}
