CENSE is a software for assessing personal exposure in urban areas based on combined dose and exposure indicators theory. Characterization of personal exposure is of vital importance in urban areas, since citizens spend a substantial portion of their time in spaces where exposures to pollutants are often highly elevated. Furthermore, an urban space or microenvironment needs to be characterized according to its environmental quality, especially if it is densely populated or usually crowded. This space may be a closed environment (e.g. the interior of a car) as much as an open-air one (such as the saddle of a motoror bi-cycle, or even the pavement used by pedestrians). As individuals are exposed to mixtures of environmental health stressors that comprise several environmental exposures simultaneously there is also a need to holistically address combined exposures. Environmental exposures induce direct and indirect health responses to humans. Their effects may vary during lifetime and possibly depend on the presence of other stressors in a combined and/or a synergetic manner. Provided that environmental stressors are taken in combination, they possibly represent a more serious environmental hazard to public health. Environmental quality varies in time and space as the result of the combined action of different pollutants and ultimately impacts on humans. Consequently, there is a need to address co-exposure in a holistic way. Rather than viewing chemical and physical health stressors separately for decision making and environmental sustainability considerations, the possibility of an easy-to-comprehend co-exposure assessment is herein considered. The CENSE tool is developed for this reason, considering citizens’ activities in urban areas. CENSE has been fully developed in the programming environment of Delphi. The graphical users interface facilitates its tractable application. Studying of different scenarios is easy since the execution time required is negligible. The tool incorporates the co-exposure indicators’ theory and takes into account the potential relative intake of each chemical stressor by considering the physical activities of each citizen. The capabilities of the CENSE tool are demonstrated through its application for the case of Thessaloniki, Greece. The test case incorporates the local features into a well identified user/decision maker interface that takes into account the specific characteristics of the area considered.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://www.gnest.org/proceedings/cest2013/public_html/papers/0088.pdf"],"title":"A Software for Assessing Personal Exposure in Urban Areas Based on Combined Dose and Exposure Indicators","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

We previously have shown the transactivation of heterologous promoters by the carboxyl terminus of BRCA1. We now describe that BRCA1-mediated transactivation is enhanced by p300/CBP (CREB binding protein) and that this effect was suppressed by the adenovirus E1A oncoprotein. We show a physical association of BRCA1 with the transcriptional coactivators/acetyltransferases p300 and CBP. Endogenous as well as overexpressed BRCA1 and p300 were found to associate in a phosphorylation-independent manner. BRCA1 interacts with the cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) domain of p300/CBP via both its amino and carboxyl termini. Finally, full-length BRCA1 is shown to transcriptionally activate the Rous sarcoma virus-long terminal repeat promoter, which was further stimulated by p300. Immunocolocalization analyses suggest that BRCA1 and p300 associate in a cell cycle-dependent manner. Our results support a role for BRCA1 in transcription.","inCitations":["81213ea71eb3080d506da1d05a4b033a35dac8ba","e76ee700e9f3afe8b08b879d18c1ac9d29d55ea1","5c1521032561aeb8c45342da0476ca0662d57f83","8ce92fddc0ecb0c9011338ede2508d2eee2de183","c7ba5d22b21b407a5b02b5d9a03026fbd1368585","a7dd86c7e62aeb638a196a3c9e68e391a0f3fa33","6078898469f6a02dcf8c3b0f649d7ba48f1d01a0","4e932b3c926f1f9ab1bcfabee72753a3c6e7d205","a333f71373bd779baab9e09eefb071cefc3be0c3","1d8480016df12018c313c0150506dfe609e8a5e8","6e9d1c06f33280bcdf10a853f8091565b128ff91","72426c7b2f4a4a1017fd0e2e4263ba2ad782cb72","bb580d18b847234c0b4a771c9f216d6da7acb042","5730e9c988a9eb0bd534950ad56e30688eaca8d3","02fb828e683b55073a9db5fc9ef650dd4a24abc9","cfd9f545a0930e08c3459d6cbff519f6da4520ff","25a61c909f07a9ca914c7c1186feb97c7238e2f8","d2bc6a6c856bf1affe0cb2f33eb123bc96ca7516","682f9c4b677c0f0fc4ceb8a5d65a10d8416dee3c","a330ec81052b9d7d893a2157b2744e6b2f7b3ab0","14d49f2d9c409d0c86186b62036d931a1c8d7b9c","9c2028df356350d7c7f035b0411821d0a1d92256","3aead179fd8f3bc08321c233957321752fd56dfa","9c2088e848df831c43a22fe6922a629552cd47b4","b3bb08c3fa9807ed097233ea0929677e24d0e84c","07fbe716a54a20374a7998d9579ace0fb470de0b","910e6fdd17faf1a10c224e0b69e59640b1936e75","ab3ae31e379821ed049cc1c03ae183aaef73b4cc","060b0702d20591f1c5c90d9273a5c6f8dad9eddb","47850c0fcab458708f1de703a9eb97007242e3cb","bd92a5cdc1bae34f2f2b1e22b1bb7754a8cb484a","97487f87ffb0a4a11378905d5d518678f7314866","05675c88300c30ab96d8d33d3f7184cef33c7707","8f69f346f39d995e671a220b3fe4fdd287a5772e","3d8c6db67e13457f5195152f4d3fc4dcba3aa612","d00076423a629825aa99a9179e3895bafd166e71","e01fff5268beeb9ea12e5697aa7315284ea1a32f","293a7d0d07d7ef7214c4a55519752adc6fa2843e","9b35cba0ed49be678cb95e7511cec52dd2caf041","6924ed704592735dd1a8eae7e569183b85c6b413","012b6400ba33567eb5a377fa90969e91c0e4faf8","af95579a7e846864f7c292f908c6d9e075e43e4a","25206dd3ee68f773146049a0663d2576059e8c82","d443ac76e4e22e35244fe5e513e6dc70e3b4b365","a674ad08c9e255e4e3721420717d0ffdf4e5508e","c159f83957708396cd00981008d6be2af73b5b11","6868e06b92e905d8a54ec0785fde5c6b5f913be7","458e4aef5a48632aa73af06e1dc44d51da68f053","16072ab3c016bad0590f1b6891ecc86057da1c23","db52aaa42ed6c04bfe6cfb68add0d994d51e5caa","6055ab4d027fceac07c84dbf9f056fb4069dfc09","cda330b49d792352e8858a10951059b95ddbc70f","cb54c923fbddbf646c0172a0a463b7335a88d7f7","a541205a6dab6b54e3431eecc0f15b274ff5e860","831d648d39828cfcc86304ef2825e5d2c68670c3","4a47a670fb79c5fb70ac68557fc24d335b6e7d89","00777afbaf5b9dcba573a8254d4b449ccafa4f93","8ebab6c25cfffc58b9ed1791457dbccd765b4382","3ed6507e815e3367ce10e5bf0a8c80a80494d76a","5c01d74c1a40586ec3155b034ceec4ab088e0698","b9e7d9a18dcd2045060e16509715d515cbb21081","63585e7badeabcfb021cef29820ae4f99b287966","f771b985b1aef3dd80c36f9879ee6b151698ff35","f545021cf0e7144d916d50fdc4dab6403c8e79d2","fa9b4fd9b00b0d4c2cd4bbb7a7272d1c6a6e179e","dd0716ae2e62998465e6856669848264b65fc0ab","28b03d386368b2c4593f3dab831ca86260eeec0c","61f85dd26bcf319dda816307300afcfa32757a2a","0f0e5729d743e203b6cc5fbba91a5669fd9ad22a","f433b7cf422bfc6b54a93cd3b5828621568bb494","90aa15b1f1d3ee99a8fec1e091190fc4581b0d00","956024d06e785d787c7fe11056d5da16631ca41b","1e8dda7b7b9b2cd73946ed1e94dcc38ebf64ebc0","081c63991132fb46e6115ecce1890ab052a3b208","dd1e1886f7e1c14eb32496887da145dbe9862d59","2120b2f2485a1a30217225ff048097ea25db3c83","dfbc00e9bbc5cc31d3fbe3fd87626ac6444c9c40","2c7ed37748c7319465e31118b1aad16df1a6be27","45cdabc4fcfbb4cd4292eba50a13cc950b50054d","f711616e93fa96989e50af4b4b628405b1bc045a","505e4889878aa132ff3089cd020b44d036010fee","15371840bfc54db158c299179356226019b3ad67","5d0d70ddf525a0e30b26488c080b78d83a1d9c40","54c69be8daaa6df3da706eb23448ffb75c6f7dc5","28c6440300da7014b4b060889b2d1e1290516678","f814c716890f16842f1b8079ed06d0da470d2d97","c71b69785284ed4cbb5435b6f4706d9abd7dec23","b1ba712f78d0a15f06936fe8d0b17dc94cd8cade","a0e2a9d63be821473351b0df7443bf0ce303ff4d","1ba497b1909b5d7ea45435b2bdf97aa6fc91c69a","4226a321452a384640d97db0352d7a54e9d6f99f","1e64a6bb4f4c87035d7dec4f3f7bd663c58241a4","9a0693d983ffee12bfcdac3be1ecfccc4476e399","2e8721b0312c8048528165bf607f41c7dc3408b1","09571c0220b28f88874f2a5f7999b14036a185df","4250b974cc2ee3b7bd348cf8a5e6f482fe79eb70","96ad6e6c6a4fce520d692411d871bd7952364b4b","5c823c873f7a828efee8062d1526f3cd0189aab5","a6ff587f04b4337f169c4815e8ff931b10bddc17","c4e76bfd97c44f7d804e969456333b4734f128f0","c55d4a76f93472fa273e596f62e02592e9bae20d","7b829ba856df15d0a5f60b9e8b0c3bcf93884afb","4103f37a07dfaf125bdd9dad25515796a6f94830","46a66cc8cbcd814c51b70be207d578838b4e21f7","931ed79d496f0bc771731245e9511190bccaaa92"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"CBP/p300 interact with and function as transcriptional coactivators of BRCA1.","doi":"10.1073/pnas.97.3.1020","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.97.3.1020","venue":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America"}

Here, we employed multilocus DNA analyses to assess genetic variation and its correspondence to taxonomy within the Mealy Amazon (Amazona farinosa), a parrot species found in Central and South America. DNA sequence data from four mitochondrial regions and two nuclear introns were used to infer relationships among all five named subspecies in this species complex. Two reciprocally monophyletic groups with strong nodal support were found; one comprised of the two Central American subspecies guatemalae and virenticeps and one including all three South American subspecies farinosa,chapmani, and inornata. Molecular characters diagnosed distinct Central American and South American lineages, with an estimated divergence time of 1.75–2.70 million years ago as inferred from cytochrome-b (3.5–5.4 % corrected distance). Our data support recognizing Central American and South American Mealy Amazons as separate species worthy of independent conservation management. Furthermore, our results suggest recognition of two separate management units within the South American clade, although further study is required. These findings have important conservation implications as Central American A. farinosa are under increased pressure from habitat destruction and collection for the pet trade, yet are listed as of Least Concern due to their current classification as subspecies’ subsumed within the species complex.","inCitations":["f7a957af2d198fcdfd00d6169585b406f14b4a2b","4f31c91bee56304c21812218ef9c7927a2ae9420","07fefa71947f6d99a5d49cd60c4712e68b1ec518","5ac6c305aea5b0e758b4dd087d76ce25129e8a9c","e9ebba66b365c08e1520d5e22a029ff761381431","a73f0fd7f52d72e90ce39e3503a7e6ab28de4ef9","74c140018f3a0eacdb8670e0496e8c3358cc3ce5","6f4889129d30c261d715d5efaf589cee8cb37f0c","5436c1cb0efaede46f6c158138ee7f954c6bb1dc","3f4ead823668fa080bfe33eb86cf6ed8c7d8cfc9"],"pdfUrls":["http://biology-web.nmsu.edu/~twright/publications/Wenneretal2012ConservGenetics.pdf","https://evogentas.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/wenner-et-al-2012.pdf"],"title":"Cryptic species in a Neotropical parrot: genetic variation within the Amazona farinosa species complex and its conservation implications","doi":"10.1007/s10592-012-0364-8","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10592-012-0364-8","venue":"Conservation Genetics"}

The top quark is reconstructed from its decay products, the W boson and the b-quark, and its mass can be obtained by using the 4-vector sum of their final states. However, missing neutrinos and the poor jet energy resolution makes the mass measurement biased and imprecise, always requiring further calibration, and dominates the systematic uncertainties. Several new ideas to increase the mass resolution by using the kinematic constraints of the b quark decays using a charm quark meson were suggested and performed to overcome such systematic limits. In this study, we compare three methods, one using J/ψ, another using D0, and the other using D* meson, by extracting their sensitivities to the top-quark mass, as well as their statistical advantages.

The baseline risk profile was high in patients admitted to the coronary care unit and decreased progressively in patients admitted to the cardiology, internal medicine and emergency departments (P<.00001). The intensity of medical management was progressively lower in these departments, but not in parallel to their different baseline lower risk profile. Beta blockers were administered to 50%, 45%, 27% and 21% of the patients, respectively; an exercise test was performed in 34%, 44%, 35% and 12%; coronary angiography in 46%, 34%, 19% and 0%; and coronary revascularization in 22%, 12%, 9% and 0% (P<.00001). The 3-month incidence of mortality or myocardial infarction was 12.2%, 6.4%, 8.7% and 3.8%, respectively (P<.00001), differences that became nonsignificant after adjustment for risk profile on admission.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nPatients with non-ST elevation acute coronary syndrome admitted to the coronary care unit or cardiology department have a profile of higher risk on admission than patients admitted to the internal medicine department. Also, these patients more frequently receive pharmacological treatments and diagnostic and therapeutic procedures of proven efficacy but not in a manner that parallels their different risk profile on admission. However, these differences in the intensity of in-hospital management do not seem to lead to differences in the 3-month prognosis.","inCitations":["c4720808406e3f93d4ffcc2095723b64483288e8","7f64e8eb493d7bc4205d01be18f83beb4eac07b8"],"pdfUrls":["https://www.revespcardiol.org/index.php?p=revista&pii=13060498&tipo=pdf-simple","http://appswl.elsevier.es/watermark/ctl_servlet?_f=10&accion=L&anuncioPdf=ERROR_publi_pdf&fichero=255v57n04a13060498pdf001.pdf&lan=en&origen=cardio&pcontactid=&pident_articulo=13060498&pident_revista=255&pident_usuario=0&ty=31&web=www.revespcardiol.org"],"title":"[Differences in the management and prognosis of patients with non-ST segment elevation acute coronary syndrome according to the department of initial admission].","doi":"10.1016/S1885-5857(06)60151-5","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/S1885-5857%2806%2960151-5","venue":"Revista espanola de cardiologia"}

Thus, the aim of this work is to point out the impact of rural retirement in the decrease of population evasion, in the improvement of quality of life for the small agriculturist, and in the strengthening of local trade in the city of Tuneiras do Oeste-Pr. Therefore, to perform the investigation, it was used the dialectical and historical materialist method and it was made a theoretical survey, and also a survey of secondary statistical data, besides the application of questionnaires to ten rural retired in the city.

DTI is generally evaluated by the region of interest (ROI) methodology. In this study, we applied a statistical way using Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM) to assess normal aging by DTI and compared results of these two methods.\n\n\nMETHODS\nTen young and ten senior normal volunteers were examined. On SPM, tensor images were changed into normalized tensor images. They were compared between the two groups by t-test.\n\n\nRESULTS\nIn the senior group, fractional anisotropy (FA) values were higher on the basal ganglia, cingulated gyrus and other cortical gray matter, lower in the corona radiata, internal capsule, centrum semiovale and corpus callosum by using SPM. In the ROI method, the results were almost compatible except in the brain periphery.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAging changes on water diffusion anisotropy was clearly shown by SPM method which would be useful to evaluate change of water diffusion anisotropy without operator bias even in clinical setting instead of ROI measurement.","inCitations":["5bb4db3fa9f55c87c4e8953b8d3e50b71475b07a","fba084a32d21d92b2c299a813016fc03c2e65ac5","ee183b3f4036fc692fdceac2507161070e093fb0","01afa6c8411323c91524cdc6b1d68b4df11ef933","5b4afa34885629cdebace1b9e3387eab01c000cc","3b63988e8e898bef1584dd2dd16ba959b744a6e0","fdb15e965c4d0c7a667b37651f63aef10b376d7e","cb9e83f08df8b1ca2f4696ce0f426add49560ecf","a0dff8439c48fad601ab2d9e7b291176ae68483c","612e045ec8af4775e7ed71459d35519b14224312","89b20c1057829b35365bd973f1e953285cf60a64","7ffcd2c547eada9ce1a5a3a5c8b49a8348053dd1","7bcdee077d84d1957abacab1ecaee24c86c4e45e","23f6d592b840c33c91472269da2d9b732be61b5b","ed45a620433137bdb08911ccf93b4f767944d12f","35f12ac9f304e6192a8374b7b2e409b631cb6771","b3242307718d6cf050ac8424cd045b5f818f86ec","5477f1bdd85efa62fbb505ce82e7e0a4b2950ea9","a480221ac581d11ef18b529132d21b4e0f6d7192","2ebc538b1a22967e45bb4d08adaa59bf0b638989","502860a9bf42278d597d253d66edb335cd3bb920","46593ada258b25bcfb6ee2ff7e9c20b72491abb1","de68200d45324f77c5f2b69cd480176a191b2fa4"],"pdfUrls":["https://repo.lib.tokushima-u.ac.jp/files/public/11/110776/20170929151052121610/jmi_52_3-4_186.pdf"],"title":"Regional changes of fractional anisotropy with normal aging using statistical parametric mapping (SPM).","doi":"10.2152/jmi.52.186","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.2152/jmi.52.186","venue":"The journal of medical investigation : JMI"}

In this research, strategic analysis performs to establish logical relation that is based on the BSC assessment criterion. Therefore, BSC techniques are used to identify indicators. In this study, the level of performance of bank has been assessed and evaluated by using this model. The evaluated indicators which finally will be analyzed, has been received from IT BSC bank. After determining the factors of evaluation, the related questionnaires were given to the senior managers in research and development department and IT department of that purposed bank. Each of the experts was asked about the presence or absence of a direct relation. Data were collected from questionnaires then by using a simple average of the opinions; governing relations on main communicated were extracted and the numerical value of the information obtained from the questionnaire were determined by DEMATEL method and data analysis was conducted to determine the hierarchy of criteria and factors impact and effectiveness intensity by using DEMATEL method. In fact, the approach has been presented in this paper has been used DEMATEL technique to determine cause and effect relations and strategy map. Finally, the data and results obtained from this understandably structural model were analyzed. According to the obtained results, it has been identified that the most important factors affecting the other performances of bank is the reduction the vulnerability of information systems by enhancing the security of information systems.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://ashm-journal.com/test/vol2-5/31.pdf"],"title":"Business strategies for evaluating IT in banking based on the BSC approach","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Due to these anthropogenic pressures, microbiological water quality of the main rivers of the Scheldt drainage network is low as demonstrated by our recent monitoring survey. An evaluation of the sources of microbiological pollutions at the scale of the watershed showed that the release of treated urban wastewaters was the major cause of faecal contamination. The Zenne river, a small stream crossing the Brussels area where it receives the treated effluents of more than one million inhabitants, is a typical example of a river strongly impacted by wastewater release. Studies, as the present one, leading to understand the microbial contamination are important for both industrialized and developing countries where the low microbiological water quality is responsible for numerous waterborne diseases.","inCitations":["2150a610e40cbb25670a8668233b62c663c0c2ff","e869ef858dd80985ae9826cb689d0beae885b141","7804dbc5aae540882cde1a2ffddcb1c8954e89e4","25feb19985f4ddd27a63ac531de01c00e7e7cb17"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.leesu.u-pec.fr/yes/IMG/pdf/16-WWW-YES-France-Outtara-Presentation-2009-revised.pdf","https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00593095/document"],"title":"Microbiological water quality in rivers of the Scheldt drainage network (Belgium): impact of urban wastewater release","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Signaling proteins become concentrated in these microdomains mainly by saturated fatty acid modification, thus facilitating formation of protein complexes and activation of specific signaling pathways. High intake of saturated fatty acids promotes inflammation and insulin resistance, in part by disrupting insulin signaling pathway. Here we investigate whether lipid-induced toxicity in obesity correlates with altered composition of insulin signaling proteins in LRs in the brain. Our results showed that insulin receptor (IR) is highly concentrated in LRs fraction in comparison with soluble or postsynaptic density (PSD) fractions. Analysis of LRs domains from hippocampus of obese mouse showed a significant decrease of IR and its downstream signaling protein AKT, while in the PSD fraction we detected partial decrease of AKT and no changes in the IR concentration. No changes were shown in the soluble extract. In hypothalamus, genetic obesity also decreases interaction of AKT, but we did not detect changes in the IR distribution. However, in this structure genetic obesity increases recruitment of the IR negative regulator TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) into LRs and PSD fraction. No changes of AKT, IR and TBK1 were found in soluble fractions of obese in comparison with lean mice. In vitro studies showed that incubation with saturated palmitic acid but not with unsaturated docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) or palmitoleic acid decreases association of IR and AKT and increases TBK1 recruitment into LRs and PSD domains, emulating what happens in the obese mice. TBK1 recruitment to insoluble domains correlates with decreases of IR tyrosine phosphorylation and ser473 AKT phosphorylation, markers of insulin resistance. These data support the hypothesis that hyperlipidemia associated with genetic obesity alters targeting of TBK1 and insulin signaling proteins into insoluble LRs domains.","inCitations":["8a8e046797199b5304a9a0c954c7e3a38eeeb2f2","fed0cefe6f4428ff808e69bb570e402bcadc8f68","f9c5ba4dcec1eef7ca39bca8cb5f0990d9e72b48","9b1b9054261c2dc6b24f5f2bcd825ca393fdeb7a","ed6732fd82180b3f8c914124fd095742fe406e0f","081dbebdabe00f652d406a607db42fc36f781139","387c4541dafc8f5bf0c3f069d6837da3ee6d56ad","0f43bf6d172db78a3c2e006f609454c59f8ace17","d8e20fc93f200056aa4e5ad299aeeb8ea1fe0a07","c6c4ed29971e7c0a22a0d0cf812bdb8c96bc3ded"],"pdfUrls":["https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0197018614002289","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0197018614002289?dgcid=api_sd_search-api-endpoint"],"title":"Genetic obesity alters recruitment of TANK-binding kinase 1 and AKT into hypothalamic lipid rafts domains","doi":"10.1016/j.neuint.2014.11.002","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuint.2014.11.002","venue":"Neurochemistry International"}

The sound insulation between classrooms depends partly upon the direct path of sound propagation, which depends on the properties and dimensions of the partition between classrooms, and partly upon the flanking paths which involve the properties of the two facades and their thickness as well as on the specification and relative area of windows. Field investigations on the sound insulation between classrooms in different school buildings were carried out. Comparing the results of the airborne sound insulation with the recommended value, the minimum thickness of partitions and facades and the corresponding maximum percentage area of windows to the facade area were deduced.","inCitations":["dc1760631e785b4fbb61d2b8e368e7d33c98d506","8e56c38c555d32de335f2977f16a4cafa1679eea","da72c2b2e7a86b2bf2ba07fc1f120797fa58461e","2e36af3ea9b05df7bf86abf18579199f8f949885"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Field investigations of the sound insulation in school buildings","doi":"10.1016/0360-1323(83)90021-5","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/0360-1323%2883%2990021-5","venue":""}

The assessing of units evaluated so far, following the EIA and USGS methodology is underway but first results indicate technically recoverable resources of 1,000 billion m3 of gas and 500 million bbl of oil. They show a tangible potential for investors once a specific legal framework is in place. The geological challenges for evaluating this category of resources are rather important because of the lack of novel information resulting from modern exploration and the classification regime of older one. The political hurdles are related to incomplete regulations, absence of community co-involvement, and the lack of any policy promoting the development of unconventional resources.

Direct control of the RF fields during the beam pulses ensures constant output energy, independent of the beam current. These irradiators are designed for simple, push-button, reliable operation. The modular RF system supports the needs of either direct electron or photon conversion irradiations. The IMPELA I-10/50 prototype has a beam energy of 10 MeV and an average power of 50 kW. The RF system features a 1300-MHz, 2-MW peak, 150-kW average, modulated anode klystron amplifier with a maximum pulse length of 1 ms. A software-based control loop tracks the accelerator structure resonant frequency while a hardware loop controls the RF amplitude during the pulse. A circulator protects the klystron from reflected power and a crowbar protects the klystron from internal arcs.

Coleoptera of the Histeridae family feed on the larvae of synantropic diptera, enabling their use in the control of such flies. The objective of this work was to carry out a survey of the Histeridae species present at a poultry house situated in the city of Sao Joao da Boa Vista, state of Sao Paulo, Brazil, aiming to describe their seasonality and the possible associations between the adult specimens. Samples were collected from the poultry houses from January 2001 to December 2002, using two collection methods: soil traps and Berlese funnel. The following Histeridae species were encountered: Euspilostus modestus, Euspilostus spp., Carcinops troglodytes and Hololepta quadridentata. The number of specimens found for each species depended on the collecting method. In the case of the soil trap, E. modestus corresponded to 87.01% of the total number of collected individuals. On Berlese funnel, method C. troglodytes corresponded to 84.38% of the total number of collected beetles. The presence of E. modestus and H. quadridentata was significantly correlated to climatic variations, and positively especialy rainfall (P<0.05 and P<0.01 for E. modestus and H. quadridentata, respectively).","inCitations":["80e2525dd3eb0fdf1560ce83c0626caa579ea67e","8726c989f791c7f0d813c1beeb649cbf0c4ea1cf","26db46e09311fa6462ef10d5b44a213317383a26"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Abundância e sazonalidade de histerídeos (Coleoptera) associados ao esterco de granja aviária da Região Nordeste do Estado de São Paulo, Brasil","doi":"10.1590/S0085-56262006000400009","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1590/S0085-56262006000400009","venue":""}

Germ cells transition to meiosis, erase genomic imprints, and reactivate the X chromosome. It is unknown if these events all appear asynchronously, and how they relate to each other. Here we combine exome sequencing of human fetal and maternal tissues with single-cell RNA-sequencing of five donors. We reconstruct full parental haplotypes and quantify changes in parental allele-specific expression, genome-wide. First we distinguish primordial germ cells (PGC), pre-meiotic, and meiotic transcriptional stages. Next we demonstrate that germ cells from various stages monoallelically express imprinted genes and confirm this by methylation patterns. Finally, we show that roughly 30% of the PGCs are still reactivating their inactive X chromosome and that this is related to transcriptional stage rather than fetal age. Altogether, we uncover the complexity and cell-to-cell heterogeneity of transcriptional and epigenetic remodeling in female human germ cells.In mammalian female germ cells, parent-specific epigenetic marks are erased and the X chromosome reactivated before entry into meiosis. Here, by combining parental haplotype reconstruction with single-cell transcriptomics of human female embryonic germ cells, the authors demonstrate that epigenetic reprogramming occurs in a heterogeneous fashion and during a broad time window up to week 14.","inCitations":["88397e11b8670f894699274068f5ffadad19eb1d","74010c564a492c187391f10aa2d545cef2457374","887b036c2a80806be93adfa891e94fe0e87027ce","a0fd169025bbc6fb5b1dd14a13499ade3cc6cf51"],"pdfUrls":["https://biblio.ugent.be/publication/8615353/file/8617067.pdf"],"title":"Parental haplotype-specific single-cell transcriptomics reveal incomplete epigenetic reprogramming in human female germ cells","doi":"10.1038/s41467-018-04215-7","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-018-04215-7","venue":"Nature Communications"}

The classical form has become a minority. Currently, the most frequent forms of presentation are extradigestive with various manifestations, among others, reproductive disorders. The aim of our study is to assess the frequency of these disorders in CD and their evolution under gluten-free diet (GFD). Materials and methods: Descriptive retrospective study of 173 patients with CD followed in the department of diseases of the digestive tract \"Medecine C\" of the Ibn Sina Hospital in , over a period of 18 years. Result: In 173 patients with CD, 58 patients (28,9%) had reproductive disorders. There are 53 women and 5 men. The average age was 32,25 years. The diagnosis of CD is based on histology and serology. The Reproductive problems were never isolated but always associated with other digestive or extra-digestive signs at the time of diagnosis of CD. These disorders are represented by: delayed puberty in 11 patients (19%), secondary amenorrhea in 13 patients (22.4%), irregular menstrual in 12 patients (20.6%), absence of development of secondary sex characteristics in 8 patients (12.5%), spontaneous abortions in 7 patients (10.9%), menometrorrhagia in 4 patients (13.8%), primary sterility in 5 patients (8.6%), early menopause in 6 patients (10.3%), premature delivery in 3 patients (5%), primary amenorrhea in 2 patients (3.4%) and intrauterine fetal death in one case (1.7%). All our patients have had a GFD. 15 patients lost to follow-up, two patients died and 12 patients undergoing follow-up. The remaining 29 patients, the evolution of reproductive disorders under GFD was favorable in 26 patients (90%), with the normalization of cycles in 15 patients, resumption of cycles in 6 patients, development of secondary sex characteristics in 2 patients, fertility resumption in one case, initiation of cycles after primary amenorrhea in one case and delivery of a newborn at term after premature deliveries in one case. The evolution was unfavorable in 3 patients with the notion of miscarriage 4 years after the start of the GFD in one patient and the absence of cycle resumption in two patients. Conclusion: The reproductive disorders associated with CD are frequent and varied. In our study, these disorders responded very well under a GFD, conducted in 90% of patients. These disorders are thus reversible under this diet.","inCitations":["59f70304335a79c3b21a77338dc1ad5807d7eae1"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Evolution of Reproductive Disorders Related to Celiac Disease under Gluten-free Diet","doi":"10.12691/ijcd-5-2-8","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.12691/ijcd-5-2-8","venue":""}

A definite diagnosis is aimed at histology with initial exclusion of extraintestinal causes by laboratory examinations, diagnostic imaging and endoscopy. The study aimed to examine diagnostic parameters and FCEAI in chronic gastroenteropathies.\n\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nA retrospective case review of 147 cats with chronic enteropathies was performed. In all patients, the FCEAI was established and endoscopy performed including biopsies and duodenal cytology. Histopathologic reports were reviewed for the diagnosis of lymphoma and architectural changes (epithelial integrity, villi/gland atrophy, intestinal crypt atrophy, lymphangiectasia, epitheliotropism/infiltration of intraepithelial lymphocytes). A cytopathologic score (CS) and histopathologic score (HS) regarding lymphocytic intestinal infiltration were assigned. Statistical dependency analysis was used to determine correlations between the FCEAI, lymphoma, architectural changes, CS, HS, serum concentrations of cobalamin, folate and albumin.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe 147 cats consisted of predominately European Shorthair cats (n = 126), were mostly castrated (n = 127) and had a mean age of 9.8 (1-17) years. For the proven lymphoma group (12.2%; n = 18) and the non-lymphoma group a mean FCEAI of 7.3 (4-17) and 6.6 (2-13), respectively, was established. The FCEAI showed a low correlation with the CS (p = 0.010; R = 0.22) and intestinal villous atrophy (n = 121; p = 0.035; R = 0.19). Cats with a CS of 0 had a significant lower FCEAI score (p = 0.015) than cats with all other CSs. The histo- and cytopathologic scores were highly related (p < 0.001; R = 0.43). The gastric intraepithelial lymphocytic infiltration (n = 131) was significantly correlated to serum folate (p = 0.014; R = -0.56) and albumin (p = 0,048; R = -0.20).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe FCEAI showed only a few correlations. Not only the grade of inflammation, but also the histologic architectural changes are of importance.","inCitations":["c94c228dfbae44e18a0f690f358122d1b9cfdffc"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Correlation between the FCEAI and diagnostic parameters in chronic enteropathies in 147 cats (2006-2012).","doi":"10.15654/TPK-170089","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.15654/TPK-170089","venue":"Tierarztliche Praxis.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has become the most sensitive examination. It ensures optimal focusing of radiography, thereby increasing its effectiveness and reducing its complications. In one-third of the cases studied, MRI has shown pathological signals that were invisible at CT, making for a better adjustment of treatment and a more accurate diagnosis. As regards specificity, MRI does not seem to provide criteria that would enable a radiation lesion to be distinguished from a tumoral recurrence. However, we found that certain signs may contribute to the aetiological diagnosis: a perilesional high-intensity signal extending to the grey matter and/or the corpus callosum is in favour of a recurrent tumour; a high-intensity signal on T1- and T2-weighted sequences and a disproportionally moderate mass syndrome are in favour of a radionecrosis; a post-irradiation leucoencephalopathy sparing the grey matter and the corpus callosum is in favour of a remission. Injecting a gadolinium complex always gives a better distinction between oedema, tumour and necrosis, it may also improve MRI sensitivity and sensitivity in some cases, and it reduces the time taken by the examination. MRI is now the reference morphological examination; its specificity can be further increased by positron emission tomography and assays of polyamines in red blood cells.","inCitations":["5b7531f3ad1465035db041bcb2ff1e1aed80c455","464fade3b228129f173ec0b9c8eb58d186368596","c41ead0beef40071cffa3112a886e3c84770094b","fce9457cdb984b662ece8c54bc23b9750b36fdb7","03d005cda2babd2ef4c9e7b9caf8ace98655dd94","c5483acf2b6dd7838cddba645e69791250264f68","00719668e89f5cbab184e061f69a1a8675de77aa","899a3309075e96ff2d07de01447b70abe3a7285a","08f464e19c3c9d7c72bc01c94e1e2c5fd0a2e4e4","56acbfcc63487c1b14cde048cec8083d98f4107a","84120edf592d194a66facee11aca734f451aa9f1","a3f8d8bbdccf99e8d4a7d563887e84c07b9aa9f6","dddd64780ef81e5848b79c6ba9a326b71fdca96a","5a85cf0302e683a850d1339e4628161e7528066b","dd7df7f806ff4ac49477ee5f315864b39adf4b8c","0de9a8de52808d848e84f8abe8e983adb28bdb2a","73575c16787023d12e83bb0f4d47acb60ef5cc85","af3335014d287ba45ce4e0081127f153f8980004"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Imaging of irradiated brain tumours.

Where our model is best resolved, we interpret the Alpine Fault to be listric in nature, dipping steeply in the upper crust (50–60°) and flattening to 25–30° in the lower crust. The base of the seismogenic zone shallows from c. 15 km beneath the footwall and Alpine Fault to c. 6 km beneath the Southern Alps Main Divide, and then deepens to c. 15 km by c. 10 km further southeast. The shallow brittle–ductile transition overlies a broad low-velocity zone, which together likely result from the presence of fluids and elevated temperatures brought about by enhanced exhumation rate in this section of the Alpine Fault.","inCitations":["434e4b208f7a2ebac981968348cabe9c1ec05de2","8deebe3a50411de4457b2db0a014dfa7b00c777f","0a4f602b844abf0c0956d9ea00f1ac42fa15c4b7"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Microseismicity and P–wave tomography of the central Alpine Fault, New Zealand","doi":"10.1080/00288306.2016.1182561","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1080/00288306.2016.1182561","venue":""}

The vital datum is that Shakespeare’s work becomes the touchstone for the development of “taste” as our discipline emerged out of the study of rhetoric. This review has done scant justice to its subject, I’m afraid. Rhodes’s book is learned, historically capacious, thoughtful, concerned with challenging topics in several related subdisciplines. A broad survey of educational history coexists with brief but acute readings of Hamlet, Love’s Labor’s Lost, Measure for Measure, and The Tempest. Rhodes even speculates on the political affiliations of unrhymed iambic pentameter.

For those associated with community discharge, a Poisson multivariate model was used to determine whether length of stay differed by intensity.\n\n\nRESULTS\nHigh intensity therapy was associated with more community discharges in comparison to the remaining intensity groups (hazard ratio, .84, .68, and .433 for medium-high, medium-low, and low intensity groups, respectively). More hospitalizations and deaths were found as therapy intensity decreased. Only high intensity therapy was associated with a 2-day shorter length of stay (incident rate ratio, .95).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nHigh intensity therapy was associated with desirable discharge outcomes and may shorten SNF length of stay. Despite growing reimbursements to SNFs for rehabilitation services, there may be desirable benefits to beneficiaries who receive high intensity therapy.","inCitations":["0c20d2c3f79a27397bac971a2f0ee341a87d50d2","29ca6fab18f86ccefccfd60280a5b40e5dfe2afe","32107e131a419672ebf29026f65d6595a09aed20"],"pdfUrls":["http://isiarticles.com/bundles/Article/pre/pdf/157501.pdf"],"title":"Association Between Therapy Intensity and Discharge Outcomes in Aged Medicare Skilled Nursing Facilities Admissions.","doi":"10.1016/j.apmr.2017.07.012","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apmr.2017.07.012","venue":"Archives of physical medicine and rehabilitation"}
