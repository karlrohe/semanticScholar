Segmentation of images, for example, is subject to human labeling bias. Similarly, there are multiple possible pixel values that could plausibly complete occluded image regions. State-of-the art supervised learning methods are typically optimized to make a single test-time prediction for each query, failing to find other modes in the output space. Existing methods that allow for sampling often sacrifice speed or accuracy. We introduce a simple method for training a neural network, which enables diverse structured predictions to be made for each test-time query. For a single input, we learn to predict a range of possible answers. We compare favorably to methods that seek diversity through an ensemble of networks. Such stochastic multiple choice learning faces mode collapse, where one or more ensemble members fail to receive any training signal. Our best performing solution can be deployed for various tasks, and just involves small modifications to the existing single-mode architecture, loss function, and training regime. We demonstrate that our method results in quantitative improvements across three challenging tasks: 2D image completion, 3D volume estimation, and flow prediction.","inCitations":["8dae3a013d83a99e407313be2c9b7c3529cd2440","fd6e197b1f19db9db11bf99c2732fbc8bfb8018a","64d08969fe43a80172bb4151a45dc031d2119022","859ade723313caafdf24f7515cd648cf16df7bc1","cec1c425aee5ed41d0fd89e3096864c926789c4e","39d7613f13526852e2330a11686d17d94df41c33","2fa21cfd14f5c5d47347e98ae29a1dc02d32d555"],"pdfUrls":["http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/CVPR.2018.00587","http://cs.bath.ac.uk/~nc537/papers/cvpr18_diversenet.pdf","http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2018/papers/Firman_DiverseNet_When_One_CVPR_2018_paper.pdf"],"title":"DiverseNet: When One Right Answer is not Enough","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.2018.00587","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2018.00587","venue":"2018 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"}

Seven hundred and eleven patients with T3 or T4a colon cancer, 80 years of age or younger, underwent curative resection (open surgery in 512 and laparoscopic surgery in 199) at the four Jikei University hospitals between 2006 and 2012. Their risk factors for peritoneal dissemination after surgery were evaluated retrospectively. Number of lymph node metastases, postoperative liver metastases and postoperative peritoneal dissemination events in the T4a group were significantly greater than the number in the T3 group. Peritoneal dissemination after surgery developed in four patients (0.7%) in the T3 group and in six patients (5%) in the T4a group. Risk factors for peritoneal dissemination consisted of macroscopic type (P = 0.016), serosal invasion (P = 0.017) and number of lymph node metastases (P = 0.009) according to the Cox proportional hazards regression model. However, tumor diameter and surgical approach (laparoscopic vs open) were not significant factors for peritoneal dissemination. There were no significant differences between the postoperative relapse-free survival rates for each surgical approach within the T3 or T4a group. Because of comparable postoperative peritoneal dissemination in T3 and T4a colon cancer by the surgical approach (laparoscopic or open), laparoscopic surgery for patients with T4a colon cancer seems justified.","inCitations":["8719b94ad5f77c7d0907e3d939e1d88f1c34de0f"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Laparoscopic surgical challenge for T4a colon cancer","doi":"10.1002/ags3.12009","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1002/ags3.12009","venue":"Annals of gastroenterological surgery"}

During the follow-up period, 166 patients died. The 5- and 10- year survival rate was 76.3% ± 2.1% and 58.4% ± 3.2%, respectively. On Cox regression analysis, age (P < .001), diabetes (P = .014), left ventricular ejection fraction (P = .010), left atrial size (P = .038), the requirement for coronary bypass (P = .015), and cardiopulmonary bypass time (P < .001) emerged as significant and independent predictors of death. In addition, surgical ablation was protective against all-cause mortality (hazard ratio, 0.63; P = .033). The improved survival observed with surgical ablation was verified by propensity score adjustment models (hazard ratio, 0.64; 95% confidence interval, 0.30-0.99; P = .046). The choice of prosthetic type, however, affected neither survival (P = .79) nor event-free survival (P = .48).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nLong-term survival after valve replacement in older individuals with atrial fibrillation was affected by several preoperative characteristics and the performance of surgical ablation but not by the choice of prosthesis. These findings suggest that surgical atrial fibrillation ablation should always be considered for these patients, regardless of the prosthesis type used.","inCitations":["b2dae0c395f9284853f48c5a97ca39a1781a2ef2","1d4e7adea335d03403f2f86afca2bc03c4be9d19"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Valve replacement surgery for older individuals with preoperative atrial fibrillation: the effect of prosthetic valve choice and surgical ablation.","doi":"10.1016/j.jtcvs.2013.07.019","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtcvs.2013.07.019","venue":"The Journal of thoracic and cardiovascular surgery"}

In the arthrogryposis-renal dysfunctioncholestasis (ARC) syndrome, for example, mutations in the VPS33B gene lead to a dysregulation of vesicle fusion, including lysosomes and late stage endosomes (Gissen et al., 2004) (OMIM #208085). Similarly, the Chediak-Higashi syndrome (CHS), HermanskyPudlak syndrome (HPS) and Griscelli syndrome (GS) have been linked to a number of proteins involved in the formation, trafficking and fusion of lysosome and lysosome-related organelles [OMIM #214500 (CHS), #203300 (HPS), #214450 (GS1), #607624 (GS2), #609227 (GS3)]. These inherited human diseases are associated with hypopigmentation, prolonged bleeding and immunological defects. It has also been reported that affected individuals display visual defects, including photophobia, strabismus and nystagmus. Although mutations in several genes have been linked to these diseases, it has not yet been possible to identify the molecular defects in all cases. Lysosome-related organelles are cell type-specific organelles that share several physiological properties with lysosomes (Raposo and Marks, 2002). They include organelles, such as melanosomes in skin and RPE melanocytes, lamellar bodies in type II lung epithelial cells, dense granules in platelets and MHC class II compartments in antigenpresenting cells, and cytotoxic granules of lymphocytes. Tethering and docking of lysosomes and lysosome-related organelles depends on the HOPS complex (homotypic fusion and vacuole protein sorting complex). This complex interacts with both SNAREs and Ypt7p/Rab7 (Collins et al., 2005; Price et al., 2000a; Price et al., 2000b; Sato et al., 2000; Wurmser et al., 2000) and is required for SNARE complex assembly (Stroupe et al., 2006). Furthermore, the HOPS complex seems to be important for early-late endosome transition in the Rabconversion model in mammalian cells (Rink et al., 2005). The HOPS complex comprises the class C Vps protein Vam5p/Vps33p, the protein defective in ARC syndrome; the class C proteins Vam1p/Vps11p, Vam9p/Vps16p and Vam8p/Vps18p; and two class B Vps proteins, Vam6p/Vps39p and Vam2p/Vps41p (Rieder and Emr, 1997; Seals et al., 2000; Wurmser et al., 2000) (reviewed by Bowers and Stevens, 2005). Vam6p/Vps39p was shown to be required for vacuolar protein sorting in yeast. Yeast Vps39p-null mutants exhibit highly fragmented vacuolar morphogenesis and mutant cells accumulate numerous vesicular structures scattered throughout the cytoplasm (Nakamura et al., 1997). Similarly, overexpression studies in cultured HEK cells have implicated Vam6p in the clustering and fusion of lysosomes and late endosomes (Caplan et al., 2001) and blocking Vam6p function with antibodies suggests a possible role in sperm cells during their interactions with the zona pellucida in mice (Brahmaraju et al., 2004). We have identified a zebrafish mutant (leberknödel; lbk) that carries a mutation in the zebrafish homologue of Vam6p/Vps39p and displays phenotypes similar to those observed in humans suffering from ARC syndrome, CHS, HPS and GS. Our studies reveal multisystemic defects in lbk, including a hypopigmentation of skin melanocytes and the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). Moreover, lbk displays defects in internal organs (liver, intestine) and the innate The zebrafish mutant lbk/vam6 resembles human multisystemic disorders caused by aberrant trafficking of endosomal vesicles Helia B.

The antiferromagnetic gap is found by the MBJ potential and B3LYP hybrid functional in DFT without U and also for all functionals in DFT+U close to experimental values, while for other functionals without U metallic behavior was found. Furthermore, we obtained that close to the Fermi level the role of out of plane orbitals is enhanced in MBJ potential which is not the case for other used functionals.

Relationships for the bending strain induced in the pipeline segments intersecting at a network junction are presented. It is shown that the bending strain is a function of the peak ground velocity, the propagation velocity of the transverse seismic waves with respect to the ground surface, the flexural rigidity of the pipeline segments, and the lateral stiffness of the soil surrounding the pipeline. An example problem is presented to illustrate the procedures for determining these bending strains.","inCitations":["1f2e7f94642e60ed3fd4aa11843cf8ec2289785e"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Transverse Seismic Waves at Pipeline Junctions","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Thirty-eight healthy young women (mean age; 21.3, range; 19-27 years) were enrolled. Gustatory thresholds were estimated for four basic tastes: sweet (sucrose), salty (sodium chloride), sour (tartaric acid), and bitter (quinine hydrochloride) by a filter-paper disk method. Various concentrations at each taste were serially scored from disc number 1 (lowest) to number 5 (highest). The lowest concentration at which the quality of the taste was correctly identified was defined as the recognition threshold. The mean of three measurements for each test on three different days was calculated. We divided our participants into normal taste and hypogeusia groups based on the mean threshold disc numbers, <=3.5 and >3.5, respectively, according to previous literature using the same method. We also measured serum concentrations and dietary intakes of micronutrients including zinc, iron, copper, and selenium. The numbers of participants belonging to the hypogeusia group were 24 (63.2%) for sweet, 19 (50.0%) for sour, 17 (44.7%) for bitter, and 16 (42.1%) for salty taste. Although the hypogeusia group exhibited significantly lower serum iron concentrations, except for the salty taste, the other three micronutrients concentrations did not show any association with the four taste acuities. Dietary micronutrient intake did not show any association with the four taste acuities. This study indicates that in addition to zinc status, iron status should be considered in the study of taste acuity.","inCitations":["0e32d62ca57c7569b943c1c1bf63f115da94a7cd","8aec36416c0e55fb6d99d6d7bd25d0382b1099db","f26440512d13543c251ed3f574ede66bd022b9b6","fbbf096c639c0b6990f88cb8dafe80f09d814481","cfb5d7e3ab45362688f6515b09cc39950d096f94","10f5792f4e22dd5b03284c2d829aa85499ac48fb"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.apjcn.org/update/pdf/2012/3/406-410/406.pdf"],"title":"Evaluation of taste acuity by the filter-paper disc in Japanese young women: the relationship with micronutrients status.","doi":"10.6133/apjcn.2012.21.3.12","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.6133/apjcn.2012.21.3.12","venue":"Asia Pacific journal of clinical nutrition"}

Males responded to long daylengths (> 12 h light/day) by rapid testicular development and an increase in testosterone levels reaching 65.8 +/- 1.5 ng/ml (n = 12) after 3 wk of inductive photoperiod. Levels were maintained unchanged until 14 wk of exposure to long photoperiod, when spontaneous gonadal regression was observed. Under short daylengths, intact males exhibited regressed gonadal function with low plasma concentrations of testosterone: 5.4 +/- 1 ng/ml. To investigate the effect of olfactory bulb deprivation on gonadal responses to photoperiod, 12 males were bulbectomized (BX) during exposure to either long (n = 8, BX1) or short (n = 4, BX2) daylengths. In both groups of BX males, responses to long or short daylengths were maintained. However, the timing and the amplitude of gonadal responses to photoperiod were modified; BX males underwent a significant delay in testis development and also had reduced testosterone levels (53.3 +/- 2.3 ng/ml and 37.3 +/- 0.9 ng/ml for BX1 and BX2 groups, respectively). Moreover, BX males did not exhibit spontaneous gonadal regression after 14 wk of exposure to long daylengths, indicating that the photorefractory state did not appear, at least under our experimental conditions. In this primate, olfactory bulbs exert an important effect on the neuroendocrinological control of reproductive responsiveness to photoperiod.","inCitations":["bac07624a8e2257c0040d8e256f0c5eee86689d1","1b411b99c19728bbdda4b7ccfd97ce4eb0794979","573f483f5cfa435afdab357963ec8f78054f8365","cf6d50fe4c379004b43cc0029824b76fffeef551","65d25fdca5adc9b069e82944a6a93dbe3c781771","8b4fa6bf0b06f371658e0d61c3c3829a5f4ed20f","20cf8eb933a339a37024d35b392e3e5ae0d951dd"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Removal of the olfactory bulbs modifies the gonadal responses to photoperiod in the lesser mouse lemur (Microcebus murinus).","doi":"10.1095/biolreprod49.1.58","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1095/biolreprod49.1.58","venue":"Biology of reproduction"}

The second question is whether the General Assembly itself may take enforcement-like action. Again it is clear that the General Assembly cannot order enforcement action. But you are all aware of the issue as to whether an Assembly recommendation may form the basis for such action by Member States. The United Nations action in Korea was in response to a Security Council \"recommendation\" rather than a \"de cision\" and the Uniting For Peace Resolution was originally intended, and initially applied, to enable a similar action in response to General Assembly recommendations. It was contended that while primary re sponsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security is vested in the Security Council, a residual authority must lie with the General Assembly when the Security Council is unable to take action. Subsequently of course, the Uniting For Peace Resolution has been used for peace-keeping operations undertaken with the consent not only of participating states but also of the state or states directly concerned. Even these consensual operations are the subject of challenge and contro versy. However, the General Assembly continues to adopt at each session by large majorities resolutions calling on states to apply economic mea sures similar to those described in Article 41 and in resolutions on Southern Rhodesia has called on the United Kingdom, as the administering authority, to take all necessary measures \"including in particular the use of force.'' I have not attempted to draw conclusions, but merely to sketch the background and pose a few illustrative problems. I would suggest, how ever, that questions of implementation and enforcement of decisions of international organizations are central to the larger question of organizing our international community for survival in this nuclear age. I would also submit that the problems are more a dearth of will than of ways. As has been said so frequently of sanctions under the League, it was not so much that they were tried and found wanting, but that they were found difficult and not tried at all. One may wonder how different the world might be today if the United Nations had grappled successfully with these problems in the first days of its creation. Fortunately, it is not yet too late.","inCitations":["b3feb912dcfad092c800b0da0ffbe880bce8cd8a"],"pdfUrls":["https://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1665&context=fss_papers&httpsredir=1&referer=","https://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1666&context=fss_papers"],"title":"The Enforcement of International Judgments","doi":"10.1017/S0272503700014889","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1017/S0272503700014889","venue":""}

The as cast microstructures of the alloy consists of the α-Mg, lamellar eutectic Mg2Ca and bulky Mg-Al-Sr phase. After annealing at 400°C, lamellar eutectic tended to be spheroidised and the continuous interphase network breaks up gradually, meanwhile, C14-Mg2Ca completely transforms to C15-Al2Ca. These results in obvious decrease of creep property.

Myeloma association guidelines outline the symptoms that should trigger investigation. Acute admissions for back pain alone do not form part of this. We aimed to establish the number of emergency back pain admissions, >55, in our unit over two years. We wished to identify all patients who had protein electrophoresis and/or urinary Bence Jones proteins taken, the number of positive results and diagnoses of myeloma. From our database all patients >55 admitted with back pain in 2009 and 2010 were identified. Using the electronic laboratory reporting system we recorded FBC/ESR/Electrophoresis/Urinary Bence-Jones Proteins. There were 7682 admissions from January 2009–December 2010. 87 were for back pain (1.4%). 55 patients were aged >55 years. Within this group – 22 had protein electrophoresis and 23 had Bence-Jones Proteins. All were negative. 36 patients had an ESR taken, 9 were elevated. None were subsequently found to have haematological malignancy. 53 patients had an FBC taken (5 were anaemic, 8 had leucocytosis and 3 had thrombocytopenia). 20 patients had a vertebral fracture (36.4%). There were no documented cases of myeloma. The Information & Statistics Division of NHS Scotland published figures that demonstrate in 2006–2010, in patients > 55, there were 716 new cases of myeloma in the West of Scotland. Extrapolating this to our unit, on average, we would expect 24 new cases / year in this age group from all presentations. Performing myeloma screens on all back pains does not fulfil recognised screening criteria. We propose myeloma screens are not performed routinely in patients >55 admitted with back pain. It would be reasonable to do so where there is evidence of bone marrow failure, or plasmocytoma on Xray, associated with non-mechanical back pain.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"The Role of Myeloma Screening in Low Back Pain Admissions Aged >55","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Therefore, non-contrast enhanced cardiac computed tomography has been established as the de facto standard method for clinical risk assessment and contrast enhanced computed tomography has proven to be a reliable, non-invasive alternative to traditional coronary angiography. However, calcium scores determined on contrast enhanced data cannot be easily related to the scores determined on non-contrast enhanced data. Hence, an increased number of studies are being performed in order to evaluate the clinical value of calcium scoring on contrast enhanced computed tomography coronary angiography images. While the clinical results with respect to the diagnostic value are promising, the high image contrast variability caused by the contrast agent leads to an increased manual effort in order to accurately segment calcified lesions in the data. Moreover, manual calcium scoring on contrast enhanced computed tomography scans is subject to strong intra- and inter-observer variability.In this paper, we present a novel approach to the fully automatic segmentation and quantification of calcified lesions in coronary computed tomography angiograms. The method includes a robust threshold determination algorithm based on a histogram calculated from an automatically generated vessel tree. Thereby, lesions can be accurately segmented and calcium scores can be determined without user interaction. Validation against manual scores obtained by a radiologist showed a very high correlation, which demonstrates the clinical value of the presented method.","inCitations":["31349735e65345e7953ed3404879231e5e316967","4490792b673bd3b7aead9095777ad611a99f0d64","f4ec4cb0a76095711a5a23298a7d9f7f25a5d16d","76b242542647b20e60a5b0d853a774605c3740e3"],"pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1007/s00450-010-0131-3"],"title":"Automatic detection and quantification of coronary calcium on 3D CT angiography data","doi":"10.1007/s00450-010-0131-3","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00450-010-0131-3","venue":"Computer Science - Research and Development"}

The epidemiology of corneal blindness is complicated and encompasses a wide variety of infectious and inflammatory eye diseses that cause corneal scarring, which ultimately leads to functional blindness. In addition, the prevalence of corneal disease varies from country to country and even from one population to another. While cataract is responsible for nearly 20 million of the 45 million blind people in the world, the next major cause is trachoma which blinds 4.9 million individuals, mainly as a result of corneal scarring and vascularization. Ocular trauma and corneal ulceration are significant causes of corneal blindness that are often underreported but may be responsible for 1.5-2.0 million new cases of monocular blindness every year. Causes of childhood blindness (about 1.5 million worldwide with 5 million visually disabled) include xerophthalmia (350,000 cases annually), ophthalmia neonatorum, and less frequently seen ocular diseases such as herpes simplex virus infections and vernal keratoconjunctivitis. Even though the control of onchocerciasis and leprosy are public health success stories, these diseases are still significant causes of blindness--affecting a quarter of a million individuals each. Traditional eye medicines have also been implicated as a major risk factor in the current epidemic of corneal ulceration in developing countries.

More specifically, it analyses the way in which an episode of Vera Brittain’s life, the loss of her fiance during World War I, is rewritten in her autobiographical texts – diary, correspondence and memoir. The attempt at coming to terms with the terrible loss, at understanding and interpreting its circumstances, at sharing it with others, changes when rewritten for another audience in another situation of communication. The exploration of the means through which a new version is worked out – quotation, copying, rephrasing, reframing, addition of details, change of point of view, polyphony, etc. – throws light not only on the rhetoric of rewriting, but also on the experience of mourning in its relation to the 1914–18 ‘war culture’. By showing how mourning as a cultural phenomenon is differently constructed in variable verbal contexts, rhetorical analysis aspires to complement ...","inCitations":["ab951f1617c02ddb997e623fe3e16f25020937c8"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"A rhetorical approach to rewriting: genre and Vera Brittain's experience of mourning","doi":"10.3167/147335303782369321","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.3167/147335303782369321","venue":""}

In the past, greater emphasis was placed on analysing their stability behaviours using finite element method or approximate formulae. This work conducted experimental investigation into the stability behaviour of cable-stiffened single-layer latticed shells. Three experimental models, including one ordinary single-layer spherical latticed shell and two different types of cable-stiffened single-layer spherical latticed shells under three different types of load distributions, were investigated in this study. Corresponding numerical analyses were conducted to investigate the stability behaviour of the latticed shells as well. Both the experimental study and the numerical analyses indicate that the load-carrying capacity of single-layer latticed shell has been significantly improved by the introduction of the cable-stiffened system. The numerical results also show that the joint stiffness has remarkable effect on the stability of ordinary single-layer latticed shell, whereas the effect on corresponding cable-stiffened single-layer latticed shells is limited.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Experimental and numerical analysis of cable-stiffened single-layer spherical latticed shells","doi":"10.1177/1369433216630120","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1177/1369433216630120","venue":""}

Francis Bitter Magnet Laboratory for application to superconducting magnets of NMR and MRI. The technique is particularly appropriate for “dry” magnets that do not rely on liquid cryogen, e.g., liquid helium (LHe), as their primary cooling sources.

According to North American Electric Reliability (NERC) standards, all generators in North America with capacities larger than 10 MVA are required to validate their models every five years. Validation is quite costly and can significantly affect the revenue of generator owners, because the traditional staged testing requires generators to be taken offline. Over the past few years, validating and calibrating parameters using online measurements including phasor measurement units (PMUs) and digital fault recorders (DFRs) has been proven to be a cost-effective approach. In this paper, an innovative open-source tool suite is presented for validating power plant models. The tool suit includes a Power Plant Model Validation (PPMV) tool to check model performance, trajectory sensitivity analysis tool for assessing the effect of parameter variation, and an ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) based algorithm tool for parameter calibration. In this paper, the architectural design of the tool suite is described; in addition, the detailed procedures to run the tool suite are presented. Results of tests on a realistic hydro power plant using PMU measurements for 12 different events are documented. The calibrated parameters of the generator, exciter, governor and PSS models demonstrate much better performance than the original models for all the events considered and show the robustness of the proposed calibration algorithm.","inCitations":["917d80274b45d47f3e175bc8f69e3566d3813abd","02eeb65aa8b9665bbfacc10846089786405497f6","4056f1bec4c09c186a5e56360c41cbce9b55d507","4831452ca24f6df277c0c3a8fe2f61abc05ab572","2a691812901c92af86fa96cc9fa383f5ab1054e4","8e9313f386ff8fab61b8434d16fc75a4baef292d","558db94157258fbd684bc2a9c75a2118f74ca1cf","da6e879f9279803bd2fb06f9b2f723e65ff99307","d57a84f223cfdac7761e6023a7ded263ccd83a1e","6f477a8585259e378deca7a983681082e6ad45cb","857e5a8b4ac4b925f02b8cc98737cb7b41952afd","a941f5d4c42cd212842c1d026c01c0e8904dde2a"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"An innovative software tool suite for power plant model validation and parameter calibration using PMU measurements","doi":"10.1109/pesgm.2017.8274654","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/pesgm.2017.8274654","venue":"2017 IEEE Power & Energy Society General Meeting"}

Causes for poor performance\nwere found both in sales forecasts, that were used to generate the MPS and subsequently\ncomponent demand, and in the MRP systems of the customers. Inaccuracies in demand\nforecasts were found to mainly be dealt with through buffers of materials and finished\ncomponents at the supplier. Improved forecasting accuracy is expected to allow suppliers to\nlower their inventory levels, resulting in cost savings across the entire supply chain.

For Seyfert galaxies, the AGN unification model provides a simple and well-established explanation of the type 1/type 2 dichotomy through orientation-based effects. The generalization of this unification model to the higher luminosity AGNs that quasars are remains a key question. The recent detection of type 2 radio-quiet quasars seems to support such an extension. We propose a further test of this scenario. Methods. On the basis of a compilation of quasar host-galaxy position angles consisting of previously published data and of new measurements performed using HST Archive images, we investigate the possible existence of a correlation between the linear polarization position angle and the host-galaxy/extended emission position angle of quasars. Results. We find that the orientation of the rest-frame UV/blue extended emission is correlated to the direction of the quasar polarization. For type 1 quasars, the polarization is aligned with the extended UV/blue emission, while these two quantities are perpendicular in type 2 objects. This result is independent of the quasar radio loudness. We interpret this (anti-)alignment effect in terms of scattering in a two-component polar+equatorial model that applies to both type 1 and type 2 objects. Moreover, the orientation of the polarization –and then of the UV/blue scattered light– does not appear correlated to the major axis of the stellar component of the host-galaxy measured from near-IR images.","inCitations":["a9bda5c47c0919d8cee719070007bd11c06fc30c","7e0fb76a314ddd67473a0c049d6e4c84cd27171c","f3a9d13aa858a7213611dbdc5fa64b50856e2071"],"pdfUrls":["https://orbi.uliege.be/bitstream/2268/5160/1/artbenAA.pdf","https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/pdf/2008/05/aa7986-07.pdf","http://arxiv.org/pdf/0710.4048v1.pdf","https://arxiv.org/pdf/0710.4048v1.pdf"],"title":"Evidence of a type 1/type 2 dichotomy in the correlation between quasar optical polarization and host-galaxy/extended emission position angles ,","doi":"10.1051/0004-6361:20077986","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1051/0004-6361%3A20077986","venue":""}

The molecular functions of NDPKs remain ill defined. We studied ndk-1, the sole Caenorhabditis elegans ortholog of group I NDPKs, and focused on its role in Ras/MAP kinase (MAPK)-mediated signaling events during development. ndk-1 inactivation affects vulval cell fate specification through the Ras/MAPK cascade. ndk-1 mutant worms show severe attenuation of activated, diphosphorylated MAPK in somatic tissues, indicative of compromised Ras/MAPK signaling. Using the C. elegans vulval induction system we performed a genetic epistasis analysis, and found that NDK-1 acts downstream of LET-60/Ras but upstream of MPK-1/MAPK, at the level of the kinase suppressors of Ras (KSR-1/2). KSR proteins act as scaffolds facilitating Ras signaling events by tethering signaling components, and we show that NDK-1 binds to KSR-2. Our study provides the first in vivo evidence for a functional NDPK/KSR interaction, revealing that NM23 controls differentiation by modulating the level of activation of Ras/MAPK signaling. These results may help to better understand how dysregulated Nm23 in humans can lead to tumorigenesis (manuscript submitted to PNAS). We also found that NDK-1 influences the processes of DTC migration and apoptotic engulfment through rearrangement of the cytoskeleton. These data contribute to understand the role of NDPK/Nm23 in cell migration and apoptosis.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"A humán metasztázis inhibitor nm23 géncsalád C. elegans ortológjainak genetikai analízise = A genetic characterisation of the human metastasis inhibitor nm23 orthologues in C. elegans","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Apoptosis has emerged as the fundamental mechanism of cell loss in most, if not all, genetic disorders and injury states, and has also resulted in a fundamental change in our understanding of the molecular basis of cancer. At the molecular level, the evolving description of mitochondrial dysfunction and caspase activation as central elements of apoptosis have transpired to challenge our underlying assumptions of cellular function. Of the many breakthrough discoveries over the preceding decade, the discovery and characterization of the caspases represents a milestone in our understanding of cellular processes. Consequently, the control of caspase activity now holds tremendous therapeutic potential and is under intense investigation in academic and pharmaceutical company laboratories worldwide.","inCitations":["cd29accb3f6029704d1cf07745e8f19b011efab8","698be60cf01c505a42194b67a3340b6e790e47db","cc0c84c85c92c5e2182cada823aef6b6f7fbae66","08dfc219b428492879b63367d524bda10a6a6efa","5ed0eaa9e53ef03801060a9e97536c90da848189"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Inhibitors of Apoptosis Proteins","doi":"10.1007/978-1-59259-361-3_3","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-59259-361-3_3","venue":""}

The discrete wavelet transform is used to decompose the error signal into different frequency components at various scales. The wavelet transformed coefficients of different scales, which represent many underlying phenomena such as process dynamics, measurement noise, and effects of external disturbances, are scaled by its respective gain and then added together to generate the control signal. The performance of this newly devised wavelet controller is evaluated by simulation results as well as by experimental results. The complete vector control scheme incorporating the wavelet based PID controller is successfully implemented in real-time using the ds1102 digital signal processor board for the laboratory 1-hp IPM motor. In order to prove the superiority of the proposed controller over the conventional controllers a comparison between the proposed and the conventional proportional-integral (PI) controller based systems is made at different dynamic operating conditions.","inCitations":["d9534f20be3c5dcc898f7845936199231eddcfed","6c5caaaad6f5ccb4e350b2c9016bd2c19b68286e","ea51e18268e5d904baa374a52f616cc08f371160","5274000b6b05b4e94aebc462b4eb681794327838","6522cecbb1fbf6511084a3d34dbbd9c486be62d3","5aa2c097ca880e63a45cebe1e4392472cb69191f","b4ae68f556fb2c276d1e0972a7425fb67ab9bfe6","3b77381c252ac5d5ea6537b67c62b0b501c40ad1","6407bd46e82a23a5d2ab862b5b804dce523a3078","9bbddb1a420d2e35c4fb4d92fbef60fe51584a4b","d41eafaf63fc2f52bf09b09bd6cba3faa20d2616","27f378363a6d4a41da79cab19ca3b9fe5597c5ed","9861385e9756cae279ddbf1c9ebb45ee9c92017c","d182f984eb8f7f53f8b80c32361c841ddb354aa1","e1e604f411674c93a9d88c7484bcdfb7b4a8af7a","6c4336006ff2a65937d176689cf0c26aa5829e58","a13d1d10e0abf769271caa7e275ffd3a7f7f70f0","c349c8e4e8355c5dc31b7e5b59d332b86a0eca67","9c63f4b4a8482eee67c4011a88ed0d38811f3e41","ea7085dc82ba3e1c900104cd88467274da0edee9","83182c7245b492031c3e11e8326800388c31467a","9f032d98af66a12e4653943a1bb08f1f0827fc0c","2ff5ba07d8d26d5e5dfb97cc077396d7fd19c0b3","70ea02ebdfd682f206c5eb04dd02fd55a959d1ca","c500f78b4e54b5d3db46cb524daa82aae907b199","307edd18da89a885168b7255aa1141c3ff850d9f","1932173186724c8748d4abe701f59341f5c28697","08c3e2f1ac55d93ceb3ad1affa4797bfb521c70a","06d425f9d41f4ca5b31d773b46bb035992ad035b"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Implementation of a New Wavelet Controller for Interior Permanent Magnet Motor Drives","doi":"10.1109/TIA.2008.2006317","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIA.2008.2006317","venue":"2007 IEEE Industry Applications Annual Meeting"}

opinion in genetics & development","paperAbstract":"Deciphering the molecular basis of how modern human phenotypes have evolved is one of the most fascinating challenges in biology. Here, we will focus on the roles of gene regulatory factors (GRFs), in particular transcription factors (TFs) and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) during human evolution. We will present examples of TFs and lncRNAs that have changed or show signs of positive selection in humans compared to chimpanzees, in modern humans compared to archaic humans, or within modern human populations. On the basis of current knowledge about the functions of these GRF genes, we speculate that they have been involved in speciation as well as in shaping phenotypes such as brain functions, skeletal morphology, and metabolic processes.","inCitations":["8b7ffa8779b373f8a1ca0f9e5b83becd8f44015f","66de67f9e370350eeeca48259ee92eab5db5664c","3e30f26ff77926b943c7caca6c8f13af523b43fc","df062cdbd0292336fde78c8a2ed70cbd94da9fb0","81e56aa9bf599bdef8c27c33bf06152b88d8b7d9","386290d5c6d159e6a85df12ee0d36256a3f8ac08","5e905769cfc94cdd16d4c47ca2b9b675826e1d21","1c8ab6346b47ba86737ae6c0c42cc4154b1e271f","49778d89cf4d3e7bd3ef5ffcef4c2f30d2f6a57d","f4f6af95fcc7ca8a676bc821dcb48126b87aaa1a","1edda9c75a4aaad91e9d06e8bffa995e85502033"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.qucosa.de/fileadmin/data/qucosa/documents/21174/FinalDocumentThesis_21_09_16.pdf"],"title":"The role of gene regulatory factors in the evolutionary history of humans.","doi":"10.1016/j.gde.2014.08.007","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gde.2014.08.007","venue":"Current opinion in genetics & development"}

We reviewed patients treated with methotrexate, compared to salpingectomy and sal- pingostomy between 1990 to 1995 and 2000 to 2003. For 1990 - 1995 there were 21 conservative surgical treatments (5.3% ectopic pregnancies). The ratio of ectopic to normal deliveries was 1:24. Medical treat- ment was done for 19 pregnancies (3.4% of ectopic pregnancies) for 2000 to 2003. During the period there was an ectopic rate of 1:16.8 births. Patients treated medically were similar to those treated sur- gically except that none reportedly having rebound tenderness and only 1/18 having an ultrasound scan showing a foetal heart and none with a gestational sac > 4 cm. In the medically treated group the success rate was 68% while in the surgically treated groups success was 100%. There was no significant differ- ence in the parameters in the conservative surgical and medically treated groups.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://file.scirp.org/pdf/OJOG20110100002_24061630.pdf"],"title":"Conservative treatment of unruptured ectopic pregnancy in Jamaica","doi":"10.4236/ojog.2011.11002","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.4236/ojog.2011.11002","venue":""}
