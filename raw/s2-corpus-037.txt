By \"thinking\" we meant the kind of reasoning, symbol-manipulating, rule-following, theory-based procedures, etc. that we are consciously aware of as we face novel problems. Our primary goal was to argue that the belief held by most researchers designing expert systems at that time — that experts use reasoning and rules — was misguided. Our argument was phenomenological, meaning based on careful observation of both novice and expert naturalistic behavior. In chapter 6 on Managerial Art and Management Science, we applauded the construction of O.R. models of structured domains such as inventory control or queueing phenomena and of novel situations, but we questioned the advisability of developing models of unstructured situations such as business managerial or public policy issues that are based on the interrogation of experts about what they considered the important facts describing the situation (state variables), the rules by which they would change over time given decisions (dynamics), and a measure of quality of the resulting sequence of events (criterion). We also questioned the use in familiar types of situations of decision analysis requiring that experts furnish probabilities of events and utilities of skeletally described outcomes. We could, however, offer no convincing refutation of the belief prevalent in artificial intelligence research and implicitly held in operations research that, while experienced experts in familiar types of situations make intuitive decisions rapidly and effortlessly, they must be doing so by unconscious thinking, presumably based on shortcuts and rule compilations acquired during their experience. With trepidation we offered the conjecture that the intuitive brain may store a large repertoire of remembered situations that had been successfully handled in the past, and may somehow access one similar to the current situation and then use that information to produce its decisions. By 1988, when a paperback version of our book was published, we had learned enough about neural networks to renounce our separately remembered situation (i) view in favor of synaptic-based pattern discrimination and association, but we in no way anticipated the neuroscientific events described below.

This study evaluated the protective effect of C. odontophyllum leaf aqueous extract on the damaged liver in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats. A total of 30 male Spraque-Dawley rats (150-250g) were randomly divided into three groups: control group, diabetic without treatment and diabetic treated with 300 mg/kg aqueous extract once a day for 28 days. The diabetic condition was induced by intravenous injection of 65 mg/kg streptozotocin (STZ). The blood was collected to assess the biochemical changes and the oxidative stress marker whereas the liver section was examined for morphological changes. Result showed that the level of blood aspartate transaminase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT), total bilirubin, gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) in STZ-induced rats treated with C. odontophyllum were significantly reduced (p<0.05) compared to STZ group. Oxidative stress test showed lower level of malondealdehid (MDA) and protein carbonyl but significantly (p<0.05) higher activity of GSH, SOD and GPx compared to untreated diabetic group. Abnormal cells were not detected from the histological observation. These findings demonstrated that the aqueous extract of C. odontophyllum has the potential to provide protective effect against liver damage in diabetic rat.","inCitations":["7fa53132a2bb25f371d4de7e8156d38dccffdfca"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.wwhnetworks.com/journal/index.php/lsmb/article/download/5/5"],"title":"Protective effect of aqueous extracts from Canarium odontophyllum Miq. leaf on liver in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats","doi":"10.28916/lsmb.2.1.2018.5","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.28916/lsmb.2.1.2018.5","venue":""}

New energy vehicle is playing an increasingly important role in the fast-growing automotive industry. Permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) in new energy vehicle, especially electric vehicle in a wide range of applications. Rotor eccentricity faults are one of the common faults of PMSM. Based on the analysis of structure and rotor eccentric fault forms, the main influence of rotor eccentricity on PMSM is analyzed. The rotor eccentricity causes air gap magnetic density to change non-uniformly, resulting in an unbalanced magnetic pull. It further causes motor failures such as vibration, noise, increased losses, and mechanical damage.

By firstly expressing core axioms in natural language that describe the spatial conditions of Cage's Silent Piece, its' 1952 premiere as , the technique of shakkei, and an exemplar manifestation of shakkei at the garden Adachi Teien (Japan), I construct an ontology that enables the fundamental assumptions of Whittington's conjecture to be explicated through conceptual graphs John Sowa [1984. Conceptual Structures: Information Processing in Mind and Machine. Reading, MA: Addison-Wesley]. From the ontology, I create a number of graphs and derive first-order logic formulas that are then used for inference and further reasoning. I conclude by providing a formalism of Whittington's conjecture via a conceptual graph rule that accounts for both auditory and visual conditions that generate shakkei in the cited examples of the premiere of the Silent Piece as and the garden of Adachi Teien.","inCitations":["f0c6b0debe6d4712f2255222da1334f0da8973e5"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"John Cage's Silent Piece and the Japanese gardening technique of shakkei: Formalizing Whittington's conjecture through conceptual graphs","doi":"10.1080/17459737.2019.1605412","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1080/17459737.2019.1605412","venue":""}

It is found that the same stiffness matrix is derived by using the integral equation no matter what the rigid body mode and the complementary solutions are superimposed in the fundamental solution. For the Laplace problem with a circular domain, the circulant was employed to derive the stiffness analytically in the discrete system. In deriving the static stiffness, the degenerate scale problem occurs when the singular influence matrix can not be inverted. The Fredholm alternative theorem and the SVD updating technique are employed to study the degenerate scale problem mathematically and numerically. The direct treatment in the matrix level is achieved to deal with the degenerate scale problems instead of using a modified fundamental solution. The addition of a rigid body term in the fundamental solution is found to shift the zero singular value for the singular matrix without disturbing the stiffness.","inCitations":["b2c47363c191305e092d43bc480ef72316314d97","4f842c18fe02cd9dfeccc9f93edbd379ce3f2422","485177fb23fc0b9a6b8d82b28da5fc6969353d21","0baddb5bb63ada39e5635ee71853f3e6686b172a","a9b8f2dcf88f5d919af9933b36763f2460b94f5e","9a919275b5b82b0fac9ec17c56c8eb9478957728","c3a244d7e5bacbc9e1d0a011c83da3a0b002bc10"],"pdfUrls":["http://msvlab.hre.ntou.edu.tw/paper/cs/cas.pdf"],"title":"Rigid body mode and spurious mode in the dual boundary element formulation for the Laplace problems","doi":"10.1016/S0045-7949(03)00013-0","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/S0045-7949%2803%2900013-0","venue":""}

These derivatives were characterized by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), diffuse-reflectance spectroscopy, luminescence spectroscopy and magnetic studies. TGA studies show that the thermal stability of these complexes decreases in the order 2 > 3 ≈ 4 > 1. An optical band-gap in the range 1.90–2.15 eV in the diffuse-reflectance spectra of 1–4 indicate their potential use as semiconductors, 3 and 4 being the most promising because of their low band gap values. Compared to the precursors [Tb(DMSO)8]I3 and [Tb(DMF)8]I3, the high energy transitions in the excitation spectra of 1, 2 and 4 are quenched by a process that is best attributed to the autoionization of the carriers in the material.

The amino group of MHD in the electronic ground state S0 is twisted relative to the benzonitrile moiety, as deduced from quantum chemical calculations supported by experiments.

These studies estimate the parameters in a target population based on representative samples, and can be qualitative or quantitative, descriptive or comparative, and observational or experimental. Parameters of interest include levels of disease and associations between risk factors and disease outcomes. Concept maps are useful for showing causal paths between risk factors, disease outcomes, and intervening variables (confounders) that could distort the association. The statistical methods can be classified by the type and role of the data, and are subject to both inaccuracy or lack of statistical power (due to sampling variability) and bias (due to faulty measurement, differential selection of subjects, or confounding). Matching of subjects can improve accuracy. Mantel–Haenszel methods can reduce confounding bias. Meta-analysis is used to combine results from different studies. Statistical models include linear, logistic, and Poisson regression, and the proportional hazards model for handling censored data. \n \n \nKeywords: \n \nbiostatistics; \nclinical trials; \ncohort analysis; \ndemography; \nepidemics; \nFramingham; \nlongitudinal data analysis; \nlogistic regression; \nMantel–Haenszel statistic; \nmatched pairs; \nmedical diagnosis; \nmedicine; \nPoisson regression; \nproportional hazards model; \nCox's; Prospective Studies; \nretrospective studies; \nrelative risk; \nselection bias; \nsurvival analysis","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Epidemiological Statistics—II","doi":"10.1002/0471667196.ess6019.pub2","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1002/0471667196.ess6019.pub2","venue":""}

In this study postprandial glycaemic and insulinaemic responses were evaluated in subjects with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) who had a meal containing sourdough bread leavened with lactobacilli, in comparison to a reference meal containing bread leavened with baker yeast. Sixteen IGT subjects (age range 52–75, average BMI 29.9 ± 4.2 kg/m²) were randomly given a meal containing sourdough bread (A) and a meal containing the reference bread (B) in two separate occasions at the beginning of the study and after 7 days. Sourdough bread was leavened for 8 h using a starter containing autochthonous Saccharomyces cerevisiae and several bacilli able to produce a significant amount of d-and l-lactic acid, whereas the reference bread was leavened for 2 h with commercial baker yeast containing Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Plasma glucose and insulin levels were measured at time 0, 30, 60, 120, and 180 min. In IGT subjects sourdough bread induced a significantly lower plasma glucose response at 30 minutes (p = 0.048) and a smaller incremental area under curve (AUC) Δ 0–30 and Δ 0–60 min (p = 0.020 and 0.018 respectively) in comparison to the bread leavened with baker yeast. Plasma insulin response to this type of bread showed lower values at 30 min (p = 0.045) and a smaller AUC Δ 0–30 min (p = 0.018). This study shows that in subjects with IGT glycaemic and insulinaemic responses after the consumption of sourdough bread are lower than after the bread leavened with baker yeast. This effect is likely due to the lactic acid produced during dough leavening as well as the reduced availability of simple carbohydrates. Thus, sourdough bread may potentially be of benefit in subjects with impaired glucose metabolism.","inCitations":["34b547450bdff2c2b1d50f8e02401397a6e4fec1","409abbc72f9b502f65a69ff55c3abcc7efc4bd09","f6adf651dbd4057fff669e24dc5be36649c93f20","c3179fa3cc09ab40a1d004484fa6a6e893170e39","526b5c05a0e190e7ff1bd5e8cff5ee20fc54cac8","76195dd7ecaf088909e5c2b01943145e0b627bf4","60d6c725669456d198d84dcb98183559eca1a132","8ba51df433a60d5c03753912e0c0b6bc9fc1517f","436bfbe229c99c3082043da7ccb6874ae0acefb0","dac954902f657e4423a0dbccd807b4ff70e9a5f3","7671fe5f53be800b2ec58bbfe23643ba4c25045f","22ee1815790d2690ab9fe812b867cc90a2386cb5","e478a3f27656c1c87ec8251b42b4653a85df050a","33192bb8d5e849c8f4b93063b0af9cb2e07dbc97","f9302c936e374000f5d8c6d0d693d2da8d87e1cf","a33f7d08ffff041f3ebcb03e7e26981252a75810","a6b05537e6ff1fd5f1ae8773387f38df563e1bc8","75c2d3228ed387c714ce50335dba58093e04fbd2","a8f954817a17af133db76bcb75b4ef445d75e48c","b93e63a7b51f7d5b2dca20bb21e4047bdab08491","c48482a72f424a66a2dd7e0f555d696c233eb24c","1f50bd86bb502233cef8e6384b1cf5ac7a6d6180"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Sourdough-leavened bread improves postprandial glucose and insulin plasma levels in subjects with impaired glucose tolerance","doi":"10.1007/s00592-008-0029-8","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00592-008-0029-8","venue":"Acta Diabetologica"}

However, little is known about the potential moderators in this regard. \nOne of the most important moderators affecting the headaches is Alexithymia. \nObjective The present study investigated the moderating role of Alexithymia on the effect of Mindfulness- \nBased Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) on pain intensity in patients with primary headache. \nMethods A clinical trial was conducted in 2017 and 2018 at Imam Hossein Hospital of Tehran City, Iran. \nUsing judgment sampling method, of 94 inpatients with chronic headache, 85 were selected and randomly \nassigned into the two groups of MBCT (43 patients) and control (42 patients). The Numerical \nRating Scale (NRS) of Pain Self-Efficacy Questionnaire (PSEQ) and Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS) were \napplied to collect data. The obtained data were analyzed by Independent Samples t-test and Chi-squared \ntest; longitudinal data were analyzed using linear mixed model analysis. \nFindings Statistically significant time×group interactions were found for pain intensity (P<0.001), selfefficacy \n(P<0.001), and catastrophizing (P<0.001). The obtained results indicated a significant reduction \nin pain, pain catastrophizing and increased self-efficacy. \nConclusion MBCT is a potentially efficacious approach for individuals with headache. Alexithymia may \nhave clinically relevant factors for identifying the patients who may benefit most from MBCT as a pain \nintervention.","inCitations":["56c967ee199ada7bef8f275694090b854d56b99e"],"pdfUrls":["http://journal.qums.ac.ir/article-1-2708-en.pdf"],"title":"Efficacy of Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy on Headache Considering the Moderating Role of Alexithymia: A Randomized Controlled Trial","doi":"10.32598/JQUMS.22.6.150","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.32598/JQUMS.22.6.150","venue":""}

According to the current view, the phylogenetically earliest known belemnites have been reported from the lowermost Jurassic (Hettangian) of northern Europe. The earliest belemnites are characterized by low diversity and small-sized rostra. Their distribution has until recently been assumed to be restricted to northern Europe until the Pliensbachian. Early belemnites (the Sinobelemnitidae and the Belemnitina) are now also known from the Late Triassic of China and the Hettangian–Sinemurian of Japan, and therefore from the eastern Tethys and western Paleo-Pacific oceans. It has been suggested that the distribution of belemnites became more widespread and expanded to the Southern Hemisphere for the first time in the Toarcian. Here we re-describe a Sinemurian belemnite from South Tibet, which was located at the Gondwana margin at that time. The specimen is characterized by a long rostrum with one deep and long alveolar groove with a splitting surface, whose position cannot be determined as being either dorsal or ventral. This morphological feature allows an assignment of the re-described rostrum to either the Sinobelemnitidae or the Pachybelemnopseina. The Sinemurian belemnite from Tibet represents the earliest firm record of the Belemnitida from the Southern Hemisphere, suggesting that the wide distribution and diversification of this order was established much earlier than previously thought.","inCitations":["a92b1cbc3623b0ef34218efdc53af5c9c4b3e2c4","e391e49f6145d0ea852188853ad23b33805dcabe","0301a1303b9be9c902a7e76e710152b1e884cd39"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.ibayasuhiro.com/Publications_files/Iba_et_al_2015_GR_Tibet.pdf"],"title":"Early Jurassic belemnites from the Gondwana margin of the Southern Hemisphere —Sinemurian record from South Tibet","doi":"10.1016/j.gr.2014.06.007","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gr.2014.06.007","venue":""}

Based on the 71 samples’ hydrochemical data of major ions expressed as meq/L, ground waters are classified into four types: (1) Ca-HCO3 type ; (2) SO4-rich Ca-HCO3 type (0.28 100mg/L). Ca-HCO3 type waters predominate over the research area and are closely related to the bedrock geology in this area composed of calcareous strata such as limestone and several types of marls. SO4-rich Ca-HCO3 type waters of eight samples are scatted in the northern part and southwestern part of the research area, and are formed by the contamination of Ca-SO4 component originated from gypsum included in the calcareous strata. Mg-rich HCO3 type waters of eight samples are limitedly distributed in the northernmost part, behind the head of landslide, eastern part and southeastern part, in front of the landslide, of the research area and are influenced by dolomite or Mg-rich limestone as the source of solute. Cl-rich type waters are scattered in village in the northern part and western part of the research area, and the possible source of Cl is anthropogenic impact. Here we pay attention to the origin of Mg-rich HCO3 type waters, because there is no dolomite or Mg-rich limestone as the source of solute in this area. On the other hand, the massive dolomite is distributed in more than 1000 m north away from the Kostanjek area and also underlies in more than 200 m depth beneath the Kostanjek landslide mass. Actually, Mg-rich HCO3 type waters are found in a stream near the Kostanjek area flowing from the massive dolomite and also discharged from fissures in a tunnel bored through the landslide mass. Considering sample locations of each Mg-rich HCO3 type ground waters, these waters are derived from the deepest aquifer in the landslide mass and are probably one of the key factors on the occurrence of landslide. More detail behaviors of ground waters should be explained by additional geochemical data set such as dissolved minor constituents and environmental isotope ratios of 2H/1H, 18O/16O and 87Sr/86Sr in the near future.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Hydrochemical characteristics of groundwater from the Kostanjek Landslide in Croatia","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

One of the well characterized motifs maps to a loop within the third hypervariable region (V3) of the exterior envelope glycoprotein gp120 at amino acid positions 308-331 and is referred to as the principal neutralizing determinant (PND). The sequence of this V3 loop raises the question of the immunogenicity and the degree of diversity of the antibody response to the PND. We show here that this neutralization-related motif is highly immunogenic in HIV-positive subjects and in experimentally immunized primates and rodents submitted to various anti-HIV immunization regimens. In probing the diversity of the antibody response to PNDs corresponding to 11 HIV sequence-divergent isolates in serum samples of 101 HIV-positive individuals we found that human antibodies exhibit binding affinity to up to nine PND synthetic peptides. This antibody binding was in all cases tested inhibitable by the homologous PND synthetic peptide. We additionally demonstrate that this antibody cross-reactivity towards sequence-divergent PNDs is detectable in the sera of mice and chimpanzees experimentally immunized against a single HIV-1 isolate. Finally, we noticed that there is a hierarchy of reactivity among the various PNDs wherein the synthetic peptide corresponding to the MN isolate was generally the most prominently recognized by antibodies of human, non-human primate, and rodent origins. Based on these findings and on features of the sequences analyzed we suggest that, despite its overall sequence variability, the PND encompasses conserved amino acid positions or epitopes that are the targets of antibodies recognizing sequence-divergent isolates. We also propose that the high positive charge density of the most frequently recognized PNDs and the high antigenicity value of some of their residues are critical to the broad immunoreactivity of this neutralization-related motif.","inCitations":["389eb79c65ba02fe978a9ad7b6b57dd9e7f21583","7c309156c5871d68c35ccad8a7c54c6b5411214c","bfd12fa5c41f2130e75ff5c7b1a81eb3f4de47a7","9a190224c62b8988259facac306ab37e7b63b5b4","5678f2e8dc1710c96b5f4e5ae8d6ddae9c5e6580","ebf428331bc086a0adb01e8a746bd60208cf23fe","1d0527d198fb7dc16ac0f96e7657e0193e5e992d"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Antibodies of HIV-1 positive subjects and experimentally immunized primates and rodents bind to sequence divergent regions of the third variable domain (V3) of gp120.","doi":"10.1093/intimm/4.2.283","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1093/intimm%2F4.2.283","venue":"International immunology"}

The effects of sulfuric acid aerosols were examined to determine acute mortality, changes in respiratory function and morphology, response mechanisms, differences in individual sensitivity and changes in airway response to bronchoconstrictors. An aerosol generator for another sulfur-containing pollutant, ammonium bisulfite, was developed for use in animal exposures. Also, lung lesions which simulate human emphysema were produced by intratracheal elastase instillation to investigate a potential impaired animal model for sulfur pollutant exposures. Pulmonary mechanics, lung morphology, and histamine sensitivity data all suggest that the guinea pig reacts to sulfuric acid aerosols with a nearly all-or-none airway constrictive response. Results also indicate that the concentration at which this response occurs is affected by aerosol size, exposure profile and individual animal sensitivity. No acute pulmonary function changes were noted at concentrations below 15 mg/m/sup 3/. The reason for these differences is unknown.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Pulmonary effects of acid sulfate inhalation in the guinea pig","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

It may well be, as Dr. Blakley points out, that benign paroxysmal positional vertigo will resolve spontaneously, as it has been described commonly as an intermittent disorder. Nevertheless, these patients are terrified by their vertigo, and if they can be made symptom free within 1 to 2 days of a benign procedure, such as that described by Dr. Epley, I believe that it is improper to withhold this treatment awaiting some type of spontaneous resolution, only for the problem to recur months to years later. Dr. Epley has had difficulty in getting his data published in the literature, and in my opinion, this has been to the detriment of the patient with this disorder. I want to lend myvoice to the support of Dr. Epley for his insight into this disorder and the development of a unique procedure, which in my hands, has been characteristically successful in the treatment of these patients.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Author's Reply","doi":"10.1177/019459989411100532","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1177/019459989411100532","venue":""}

Methods: Twenty-two semi-elite RL players and 24 physically active but untrained men completed a maximal oxygen consumption test (VO2 max test) on a treadmill and electronic arm ergometer in a randomized order. Percent body fat was calculated from the sum of six skinfolds. Results: Lower and upper body absolute (P=0.03 and P=0.02 respectively) but not relative VO2 max was higher in the RL group compared to the control group. Upper body peak power (P=0.001), ventilation (P=0.05) and lactate concentration (P=0.03) were higher in the RL group compared to the control group. Maximum heart rate was lower during arm ergometry for both groups (P ≤ 0.001) compared to predicted and treadmill values. Conclusions: The results show that while semi-elite RL players have above average lower body aerobic capacity their upper body aerobic capacity is not well developed and similar to untrained men. Coaches and players need to implement separate and dedicated training programs to enhance the development of the upper body aerobic system in RL players. Upper body training should be based on maximal heart rate values achieved during upper body maximal testing.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"The Upper and Lower Body Aerobic Fitness of Semi-elite Rugby League","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Anticonvulsant drugs like the anticoagulants, antihypertensives and antidiabetics are used within a rigid sphere of patient stabilization. Drug-drug interactions therefore exert a special hazard in such cases. Whatever the mechanism, the toxic effects from therapy with phenytoin are greatly increased among patients concurrently receiving ticrynafen therapy. Schedules of dosage for phenytoin and warfarin should be appropriately adjusted to compensate for this clinically important interaction of drugs.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"BCG'osis 1","doi":"10.1177/014107688107400215","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1177/014107688107400215","venue":""}

Electrical responses to extracellularly applied acetylcholine (ACh) and to intracellularly introduced substances were studied in isolated short and tall hair cells from the chick cochlear organ by a whole-cell voltage clamp technique using a patch electrode. These cells were isolated without using proteolytic enzymes. 2. Short hair cells generated a transient outward current at -50 mV in normal saline in response to puff-applied 100 microM-ACh, when the patch electrode was filled with a 160 mM-K+ and 100 microM-EGTA-based intracellular medium. The amplitude was 317.1 +/- 97.1 pA (n = 32). When ACh was applied ionophoretically, the outward current was generated with a delay of about 10 ms. 3. The amplitude of ACh-induced current was dose dependent with a KD of 19 microM and a Hill coefficient of 1.6 when measured at -50 mV. 4. The ACh (100 microM)-induced current was suppressed by 1 microM-atropine. ACh-induced current was generated in a Ca(2+)-free extracellular medium; however, the second ACh puff in the Ca(2+)-free medium generated a much reduced response. ACh-induced current was suppressed reversibly by 100 microM-quinine. 5. Intracellular injections of guanosine-5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (GTP gamma S), inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) or Ca2+ (1 microM) via the patch pipette activated outward currents at -50 mV. 6. When the internal medium with strong Ca(2+)-buffering capacity (5 mM-EGTA) was used, the ACh-induced current was reduced to 39.3 +/- 6.8 pA (n = 4) at -50 mV (12.3% of the response in the low-EGTA medium). 7. The reversal potential of the ACh-induced current was -85.7 +/- 4.2 mV (n = 3) in normal saline containing 5 mM-K+. The reversal potential was dependent on the extracellular K+ concentration ([K+]o) and was shifted 57 mV by a 10-fold increase in [K+]o at room temperature (20-25 degrees C). 8. These results (points 4-7) indicate that ACh induces a K+ conductance by releasing Ca2+ intracellularly, probably by activating the pathway of muscarine receptor, G-protein and IP3. 9. Channel activities were recorded using cell-attached patch electrodes. Channel activities were rarely observed when ACh was applied to the extra-patch membrane, while robust channel activities were observed when ACh was included in the patch pipette medium. It is therefore suggested that Ca(2+)-activated K+ channels exist in the membrane in close vicinity to muscarinic receptor molecules and intracellular Ca2+ release sites.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","inCitations":["958fce60206f9cb29ad5893c0cc643b20054720d","987c32799293cd1a4af3d861f12b708dc37de68f","416da317f377dd6d28347f85afa20642faec60b9","daf4ebfa6e87b1e877ddbbf77b5793692c2ebb0f","bf2e00f379caec95f799b9f12ad96bdd4e9f0703","7f09b3fc99fd9f96ee883e885d79f81df544d89f","6f0e9bd40648fa9abdb469b2903bb83962ba1a4c","ee7040fa5185c1f2f5e01e92c82e56e64621d897","c917d0584cfa709dba8b26719385ffd34824d329","f6c9744f433d0a784de4eac0646a9d59657ac2a2","0361da03625bf7eff1791ecf51e5434124fa7588","ce502cf408c8cbc6bbfe0647f1c9852e2e09c5b9","3d93fa33f1492c63a0d0b6fcb014bbcbd0ed9527","5e0c71aed186e0cbdf56cff0f94dff696668a165","62ffee662f7d32a2656dc7c9d125e230c5b1628f","a1a0b277c38aaf20563067c022c4be3ce2ac7f57","860446a4cf8e9aded0353a211f5447d4ba01a041","6595635b26912156484bc331a810b313a9b389cd","531c5a1906caea682df271352d4609bd45f8ba38","1cd20ba288e83ff0994ba58b65bb110896132342","af9ec58696d90cc29adf5f132c8ea5565bde6078","c98027848b0e707cb8a741eec61866934733ce56"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Muscarinic receptor hyperpolarizes cochlear hair cells of chick by activating Ca(2+)-activated K+ channels.","doi":"10.1113/jphysiol.1991.sp018814","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1113/jphysiol.1991.sp018814","venue":"The Journal of physiology"}

Client and caregiver perspectives on recovery play a significant role in shaping these models and interventions. Hence, the aim of this study was to understand how clients with schizophrenia and their caregivers perceive recovery and to examine the differences between male and female clients with schizophrenia.\n\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nA total of 100 clients with schizophrenia and 80 caregivers of clients with schizophrenia were included in the study after written informed consent. A semi-structured proforma was used to collect the sociodemographic profile and illness variables. A questionnaire was developed to assess the indicators of recovery from mental illness and was administered to study participants. Descriptive statistics including frequency and percentages were used along with the chi-square test for analysis.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe most common indicators of recovery for the clients with schizophrenia were absence of symptoms (88%), no relapse (70%) and going back to work (70%), while for the caregivers were absence of symptoms (100%), becoming independent (92.5%) and no relapse (91%). Indicators of recovery were similar between male and female clients with schizophrenia except for the need to stop medication as an indicator of recovery observed significantly more in females (p = .006). Most clients used internal validation of indicators to assess their recovery (79%).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nResults indicate that clients and caregivers from India perceive recovery as being symptom free, able to go back to work and being independent. Clients with schizophrenia use internal validation to assess recovery. Gender does not play a role in the perceptions toward recovery in schizophrenia. These results will help in developing models of recovery for severe mental illness in Indian context leading to tailored interventions.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"What constitutes recovery in schizophrenia?

(i) Two polypeptides with molecular masses of approximately 500 kDa copurify with [3H]ryanodine binding. (ii) Both polypeptides are associated with oligomeric proteins similar in size to the mammalian skeletal muscle foot protein. (iii) The polypeptides are shown to be unique by limited proteolysis. (iv) By using isoform-specific antibodies, the polypeptides are shown to be subunits of different [3H]ryanodine-binding proteins. Using immunolabeling techniques, we have localized these proteins in chicken breast muscle by both light and electron microscopy. (v) From immunofluorescent light microscopy of longitudinal sections, it was determined that both ryanodine-binding protein isoforms exhibit identical repetitive punctate distributions near the Z-lines. (vi) In serial cross-sections both proteins have similar distributions in the same fibers. (vii) Both proteins were found to be associated with the terminal cisternae of the sarcoplasmic reticulum by immunoelectron microscopy. Based on their localization to the triadic junction, their large size and their ability to bind [3H]ryanodine, these proteins are identified as foot proteins. In conclusion, two distinct homo-oligomeric foot proteins coexist in avian fast twitch skeletal muscle. We have termed these proteins, alpha and beta foot proteins.","inCitations":["f59b87f6eafbbd38ff4bdad1891625dcba478711","460cf7b2799305a9fc3c2ddc0da613cb34f3fe6c","5aa491925f4cbc198a5c58f21af5a0a5134a89aa","c0b03076598e6780eb9a3ed22cc54b0be7127139","7cb2bba8c27c49137b8f0dd3180afe15d2d76178","cddba37a0e96eaec67daf1b43519ab5c7cee9c7c","218cc933da708e48b40f95b2b8f4da96c7f0debe","347f0f4b3a16b2862be869dd3404166b35ae7404","082ee9683b2c8ca46d3a4155071fdcd928702a82","5e0d681156981273520dc90dd10a9c182d2573a5","a492c58de30b3c47af12a3ed7f991f0f0376296e","8d6c1bec8bcb6cc191d58434c0c55d4a27b31a54","0c567ad24a7814052d35b5b5efbf2708366c3688","15395e1f644cdb73ba31b8ee2ac681304a949de8","2d78f3ceaa0b2402e9d2fc6234e9e41b67ab1f44","743f266a490c1d9a2ce06394a487d9f920b9ba74","648b08897046f6be5e05082c4322e92122728c60","e83df5c69031ae9c809afe55c336c243a0ab3f64","5e17d304699d93c216f3b0d3e0253970c568c9c9","df0473c0ceee8cfbbd851b9052744039d8d82393","8eba4cddfd8e1731824b2e0abb36a4f1c13f437b","18124bb7b5e95a0d758e69652ebdabc0d94a372a","af4cfd8c42cf9b645bc819fa908261b341534b54","0a49e7a5dda560f9af6e0a938133653540d458c0","675c6ae23e35fcf2b908dd474e2b349e4faacf49","10d72aea792dcc8283d61bf1efb8c42ed77355b7","079f3c308820e797ec6c6ff47f27e04b9815c2c3","9c348ed633ec23a85e85a284b8dd641ef495a6d8","2edef19b1c37aa9a5d1af8fe8bd2281de7841999","bb21a3b25d92cfa3e08a28dc9dfb98ffbbc2cdf3","fb0c8ba92985d0934227ce460dc4c2bec4e1a9f8","3a224fda3a486e959bd54e47c0195c2888cbe5e0","d8955a394f1215b01d1f71ff56683b62464a1761","ee36b5d28724c2ba693b511e86d18d7875a0f757","e9234f9a2b467329c09922e77e54335dfab12204","fc7db628d891f983066c783e09aac14575c13a7b","0d847ae252623cb00daa1e8c68c637cf715c535d","7399351b957d3900c9cc5dc0fc44b43dd2bf726d","deabf68bdbc1a2ea70b8261550cbd0805c176c32","96c531e8966652c97ba54726e4cbf671309a4b1d","78485a93645cf8f13cb183bbb5f786e0b5dc6f81","ea6af82b44964889c4d2e69876da633ef7344276","db4e5c99766851d8949c61f592ff3f048e166830","e2c52072001e958296d7369ff2aa6768f78cb423","577ef7c03595e8063369c7828ac637ca0066f9f2","d424c0e1afc466c358a786abdb47b8b2704c7185","0a066344f87d2d1c01ab4b889a0904f26d240f64","ffaf12ce47ea6952a451ff99e9ee26c0a19f7730","cde5c3f2b4aebdc9a21df4268495ce06f6955abd","48486ea7636f4be71ce129b574b72c1b12c64fc3","2d8048b5dbe9f330207513ae56a150d393adfd09","2d0a31a618134c65cc3348a89cd772c6811b606b","10d87276210fb04e7d9e178f1829ebcaf0e337ec","40828a474754c1f59e31dfcbc5c61d809173716f","0243c6ee3fef8f561c07496ac9f601ad7f756d44","2c53a6d1605a91062b87d4c43d707d023d08be38","1e6b7a7dc520260b951202283f074eef0a1712fa","5b0f1ce621c76ad09167f0bc1dbd033c65dcade9","f100aa99b6d73f71b516acd8d63ae709094a0b00","34c03a6ae50113de96c28693ae7bb33f1275767a","5d232446ba4a7b18e80e6f9f73e54ce16106a803","348404b9fa486c48984ad25393c54e24be24c3f3","e3f1d4565c9e6648283a3ee5516a5cc7b254b83d","2e179f5203742488e91b340422e05707639efbfd","08bfb236afa8423f098ceb49bea07f9efa049fcd","331518b08720caa67297f5ef2d22b67bf8c2c5e7","2b3036fc4d9a9fc5c6a9c22655e649cb227e1f1e","ec874ef7b0639f72066b11c6cf667245981a9fb8","3cf1df226bc9d141028cca0d053a8b9790d91c95","1fa6b2eb11b14cac592575ae191f8d9309b2ac40","8c0383f267e228fe701bd35de97fa14b555a8441","acfe227622b858324a5ae47216d7053bf55ae9b6","337f7d1df5cc0dd56bfffd9032f25394ea10a3c9","f1ff53dd7e2d55db8ae8a7223164b0d9f64cdecb","0caff8aeb40b523c85352fd988437e148038b451","7535b3e11966925ebf7e9834c402a43e60dda800","85e4863ae0b696c9dd45a8c2ce5efb37f029d3b4"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Identification and localization of two triad junctional foot protein isoforms in mature avian fast twitch skeletal muscle.","doi":"","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"The Journal of biological chemistry"}

It is assumed that the temperature and concentration of soluble trace gases in the atmosphere varies in a vertical direction. The rate of scavenging of soluble trace gases by falling rain droplets is determined by solving heat and mass transfer equations. In the analysis we accounted for the accumulation of the absorbate in the bulk of the falling rain droplet. The problem is solved in the approximation of a thin concentration and temperature boundary layers in the droplet and in the surrounding air. We assumed that the bulk of a droplet, beyond the diffusion boundary layer, is completely mixed and concentration of the absorbate and temperature are homogeneous and time-dependent in the bulk. By combining the generalized similarity transformation method with Duhamel’s theorem, the system of transient conjugate equations of convective diffusion and energy conservation for absorbate transport in liquid and gaseous phases with time-dependent boundary conditions is reduced to a system of linear convolution Volterra integral equations of the second kind which is solved numerically. Calculations are performed using available experimental data on nocturnal temperature profiles in the atmosphere. It is shown than if concentration of a trace gas in the atmosphere is homogeneous and temperature in the atmosphere increases with altitude, droplet absorbs gas during all the period of its fall. Neglecting temperature inhomogenity in the atmosphere described by nocturnal temperature inversion leads to essential underestimation of the trace gas concentration in a droplet on the ground.Copyright © 2010 by ASME","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Scavenging of Soluble Gaseous Pollutants by Rain Droplets in the Atmosphere With Nocturnal Temperature Profile","doi":"10.1115/IHTC14-22472","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1115/IHTC14-22472","venue":""}

However, higher demands on the quality of patient care and rising malpractice costs have made it increasingly risky to train on patients. Minimally invasive surgery, in particular, has made it more difficult for an instructor to demonstrate the required manual skills. It has been recognized that, similar to flight simulators for pilots, virtual reality (VR) based surgical simulators promise a safer and more comprehensive way to train manual skills of medical personnel in general and surgeons in particular. One of the major challenges in the development of VR-based surgical trainers is the real-time and realistic simulation of interactions between surgical instruments and biological tissues. It involves multi-disciplinary research areas including soft tissue mechanical behavior, tool-tissue contact mechanics, computer haptics, computer graphics and robotics integrated into VR-based training systems. The research described in this paper addresses the problem of characterizing soft tissue properties for medical virtual environments. A system to measure in vivo mechanical properties of soft tissues was designed, and eleven sets of animal experiments were performed to measure in vivo and in vitro biomechanical properties of porcine intra-abdominal organs. Viscoelastic tissue parameters were then extracted by matching finite element model predictions with the empirical data. Finally, the tissue parameters were combined with geometric organ models segmented from the Visible Human Dataset and integrated into a minimally invasive surgical simulation system consisting of haptic interface devices and a graphic display.","inCitations":["e3fc1b0fa7e2d7152e7e5e5ca343daa83974e2b8","24b66fdb2305bb6f0cdef808ef1795809bad3d68","7568ffcda002b9d71f7b2446a7dae5aceec77dc0","05482950905c06b362ca4ed09c5b0681c393e6fa"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Virtual Environments for Medical Training","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

The transition in [Fe(3ppH)3] [CF3SO3]2.2H2O is continuous and centred above room temperature while that in the anhydrous triflate salt is discontinuous and is centred below room temperature. The latter transition occurs via a thermal hysteresis loop of width 12 K, Tc↓ and Tc↑ being 229 and 241 K, respectively. The displacement of the transition to lower temperature in the anhydrous salt is believed to be associated with the loss of hydrogen bonding involving the uncoordinated pyrazole >NH group and solvate water. In [Fe(3tpH)2(3tp)] [ClO4].2H2O and [Fe(3tpH)2(3tp)] [BF4].2H2O (3tp is the deprotonated ligand) continuous transitions are observed, centred below room temperature. In these instances the displacement is consistent with the intrinsically weaker field of the bidentate system containing two five-membered heterocycles. Structural data were obtained for [Fe(3ppH)3][CF3SO3]2.2H2O, [Fe(3tpH)3] [BF4]2.1·5H2O and [Ni(3tpH)3] [BF4]2.2(3tpH). The average metal–nitrogen distances in the complexes are 1·97, 2·18 and 2·09 A, severally. The large difference in the distances for the two iron complexes arises from the different ground states: a singlet for the 3ppH complex and a quintet for the 3tpH complex. In all three salts there is extensive hydrogen bonding involving the pyrazole >NH groups, the anions and the solvate molecules.

We adopt a disaggregated approach by separating cargo handling services provided by stevedoring firms from other port services offered to the ships by different agents. The results obtained from a sample of 19 ports from 1990-1998 show that the technical inefficiency led to an average cost increase of 7% and that allocative inefficiency resulted in labor overuse, inducing an average cost increase of 8%, such that the estimated average cost inefficiency was 15%. A detailed analysis show that large ports - with specialized terminals and a majority of privately-owned cranes - exhibit the largest efficiency indices, while the specific cargo mix handled does not help to explain the differences among ports. We conclude that the reforms contributed to increase the three types of efficiency and that new reforms could be appropriate to improve further the stevedoring operations.","inCitations":["0710aad1f40073ee5e8ec732a42d48b7eaca8c71"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"The Economic Efficiency in Stevedoring Determinants Industry","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Cependant, a notre connaissance, l’existence d’un ligament intermetacarpien dorsal unissant les tetes metacarpiennes des doigts longs n’a ete que tres peu rapporte. Nous avons etudie les dimensions, insertions, rapports anatomiques et l’action biomecanique de cette structure fibreuse dorsale unissant les quatre dernieres tetes metacarpiennes. Materiel et methode Cinquante mains intactes ont ete dissequees soit 150 commissures des doigts longs. A la face dorsale, une structure fibreuse a ete exposee apres excision du tissu cellulaire sous cutanee et ouverture du fascia dorsal superficiel. A la face palmaire, le ligament transverse profond de la paume a ensuite ete mis en evidence.

Elle s’insere sur le tubercule lateral de chaque tete metacarpienne des doigts longs adjacente. Son bord proximal est dans le meme plan et separe par un espace du fascia dorsal profond de la main, son bord distal est libre.

Whereas the first mechanism was favored by these authors on the basis of ISEE measurements, GEOS data, which are obtained when the magnetosphere is contracted, seem to show that the second one may be more important, at least during disturbed conditions. The special relationship which exists between the proton resonant energy and the frequency of right-handed electromagnetic waves leads to a preferential diffusion of protons of a few keV. The ability of electromagnetic waves to evacuate the energy dissipated during the generation of turbulence is also discussed.","inCitations":["6b6d406a35b1d57bb7e6701e63b77b9674e3ebec","2454472baa627be3b533c99b3d855a78c87938d6","2c563294df109e308b01f4e30a5ed80e5ef47cc3","ef53b1fda0f3a45678b16386f94427deca863f70","82a5065b53293e87e969885c605f2e76bd8e49bf","54cfad050692154cd7fe661be4f8484056824dd6"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Magnetic turbulence and diffusion processes in the magnetopause boundary layer","doi":"10.1029/GL010i008p00769","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1029/GL010i008p00769","venue":""}

However, our previous results show that polyethylene glycol-coated Ag-NPs strongly bind to Hb and effect on the secondary and tertiary structures of BHb. Thus, a suitable surface coating and modification of surface charge would increase the NPs safety and reduce adverse biological responses.","inCitations":["f3e712f0ade5c334834cc4a66feb6682d881cf38","157c3fd2c63d0b209b77974b00f6fadf9643f7ff"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Differential propensity of citrate- and polyethylene glycol-coated silver nanoparticles to bovine hemoglobin","doi":"10.1177/0748233713483193","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1177/0748233713483193","venue":"Toxicology and industrial health"}

This report describes the continued development of the site (version 4), and in particular the expansion of factor VIII (FVIII) structure-related features. Access to the mutation database itself, both for searching the listings and for submission of new mutations, is via custom-designed forms: more powerful Boolean searches of the point mutations in the database are also available. During 1997 a total of 22 novel missense mutations were reported, increasing the total number of unique variants now described to 252 (238 in exonic sequences and 14 at intronic splice junctions). Currently, a total of 586 individual reports with associated phenotypic data are available for searching by any category including phenotype. The FVIII structure section now includes a download of a FVIII A domain homology model in Protein Data Bank format and a multiple alignment of the FVIII amino-acid sequencies from four species (human, murine, porcine and canine) in addition to the virtual reality simulations, secondary structural data and FVIII animation already available. Finally, to aid navigation across this site, a clickable roadmap of the main features provides easy access to the page desired. Our intention is that continued development and updating of the site shall provide workers in the fields of molecular and structural biology with a one-stop resource site to facilitate FVIII research and education.

It is found that while the speeds of the propagating modes are isotropic, the attenuations are not, implying that purely macroscopic experiments can in principle distinguish quasicrystals from crystals, glasses, or conventional incommensurate systems. The coefficient of the anisotropy is, regrettably, quite small. The complete spectrum consists of three diffusive phasons, two pairs of transverse and one pair of longitudinal sound modes, a vacancy diffusion mode, a heat diffusion mode, and, in a material with n atomic species, n-1 additional particle diffusion modes. The diffusion times of the vacancy and phason modes are expected to be comparable and very long. It is shown that propagating phasons, even at short wavelength, are an unlikely prospect. The static, equilibrium elastic properties are also anisotropic, but are approached very slowly, and in many situations, the elastic response is isotropic on experimentally accessible time scales. Our results also imply that nonlinear fluctuation corrections to the linearized hydrodynamics presented here are finite as q and \\ensuremath{\\omega}\\ensuremath{\\rightarrow}0, i.e., there is no breakdown of conventional hydrodynamics in icosahedral quasicrystals.","inCitations":["0bab5b19c1112656683d59635d0aa2d3bbf397e0","32064e57dd172e02b911fef04b4682ec6f1f2618","0282c78b3c72f490739677483cd25c8cb87904de","7165f4c64f13abc489e0f38e07c5296d01f60969","86ab0eceb2069cb12af415020a39572d5db9516b","f795f5fd43ebc84e154b1df45d00295211f1c391","cc44d46f28b3db1567fd4d394131d770210dc20f","b4611806803a34fc8580569a6af1ced6cb2e2847","d610e3a8938ad3da30e65176230aa73315819bc4","09f02eb544196027c88fd92cf3e2da40928f3fd5","73bb1cff3ffc8cbabc688d1496acef84741a1e57","0da7f3327fd0b94969a3edca66066288911aa422","149a79296b9262dd93db4eddce61eb3d8d7d449a","545c72c89bc98d12ba8d759c8373d00546c894bd","2a160a7a18f9ff3b11bea33083cd3185029b8d69","c93b524b074f8ed27d663e0a7095806dd96593c7","efbfff013a4b2c88a66390c75183deef879c3a95","35d896e8d553cd5b2b5e7a3de7123e57b1470d5d","514ed8172bac2d4474c6292cf80776129f73f1bb","747cf9d7490e7e9750ca916f4f873bb79210eebf","4bafb76a11eaeae4bce7dde764e3056aa13940ad","01a06a0e385e5cd8de12edda0873cfe0d0bd633f","593ad6fa398027d3c828f5935513911743a62fb6","f655a0269e63ce021c3c7fde0d9d86b30f101d86","603b5e5c0eb9a0a0ff27a73b551755550dea2676","5ca6844e030d3b94e13a38d08e11c3c5001fcb56","be6337bb6d502c414ac93fd65c88d20d26892340","08b45197afc2a7ea2f4e9cc5a036cbdd261c2b06","269e56c42b645c31c6ec5a4e00413f2d89a56481","d61305ddb49323c4936f83285a87228f34b48a70","8749a7c9c8fd895e46072b5485275f744abb7545","63e5b37526be4b4ae23a96a80322b179f93e3238","d9578f1ec5059745f2089125772c0cdd8baae699","a74dc738e0d618cbae9499a30209ef9700ca85f8","2956a230304b4fb67972ee81fbd15b73e881edc5","db4b57b1a855ea4a46ef5234a062ccaf598c94a1","1893d59ad12f808fcb5814a8f6f2d23fc76aa1ea","9c6e787568a9e98f9967257b1efd44765504b163","c4e1a775016e7a4788af2d8e1452925eccb75a50"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Hydrodynamics of icosahedral quasicrystals.","doi":"10.1103/PhysRevB.32.7444","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.32.7444","venue":"Physical review.

However, little is known regarding its cellular mechanisms of action. This receptor has been recently cloned, sequenced, and stably transfected into BALB 3T3 fibroblasts, permitting detailed study of the pharmacology and coupled biological activities of this receptor. In the present study, we compare the ability of transfected receptors to alter cell function with that of receptors natively expressed in small numbers by the rat glioblastoma cell line C6. NMB inhibited binding of 125I-[D-Tyro]NMB with high affinity in transfected cells (Ki = 3.08 +/- 0.14 nM) and in C6 cells (Ki = 1.90 +/- 1.10 nM), whereas the bombesin-related agonists gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP) and [D-Phe6, D-Ala11, Leu14]bombesin(6-16) (GRP analogue) had 100- and 300-fold lower affinities, respectively, for NMB receptors in either cell type. For both cell systems, maximal binding was observed between 5 and 15 min at 22 degrees. Both cell types internalized NMB at similar rates, with > 70% of bound ligand being internalized by 60 min at 22 degrees. The nonhydrolyzable guanosine analogue guanosine 5'-(beta,gamma-imido)triphosphate was equipotent in causing a decrease in binding of 125I-[D-Tyro]NMB due to decreased receptor affinity in both cell types, without a change in receptor number, demonstrating that the NMB receptor remained coupled to a guanine nucleotide-binding protein in both native and transfected cells. In both cell systems, NMB increased inositol monophosphate, inositol bisphosphate, and inositol trisphosphate in a time-dependent fashion. Inositol phosphates were increased in a dose-dependent fashion, with similar half-maximal values being obtained for NMB in both cell types (transfected, 1.01 +/- 0.09 nM; C6, 2.09 +/- 0.15 nM) and for the GRP analogue (transfected, 1855 +/- 140 nM; C6, 2129 +/- 250 nM). NMB mobilized intracellular Ca2+ in both cell systems, and the dose-response curves were superimposible (EC50 for transfected, 0.10 +/- 0.08 nM; C6, 0.11 +/- 0.02 nM). These data demonstrate that activation of the receptor for NMB stimulates phospholipase C and increases intracellular Ca2+. These results also demonstrate that transfected and native NMB receptors behave similarly, suggesting that the transfected cell line will be useful in future studies investigating ligand-receptor interactions, as well as in molecular biological studies of the structure-function relationship of the receptor.","inCitations":["4ce36fa09533c3648f1efed647e28f55498be124","733d21c274b8464d39c64e7a640766d6705b88ec","0900357fc6cbe497713311567dd965290d5a43b5","b32fca4523c9461313b4b0cb72dfb99990c87714","2c09961d00757ffb64659f901133210881e2f970","f887dc2651417c8b6eb2faa863c12c3e08ea1b1b","09253e70eaf9a3d40c44ab519a031065741b5a5f","d86a92fb0798c0324954ef667f04dddedba9ae5a","1cc34b3974c352779a8e1664645650f8712ffca7","3f90b2b590522a6ba7c5ed509d0926334aeb73df","ebf49715493ac444719fc2efe4adcf5e18428e45","68f618c4bf4d8d33d19f1b5fa99c1528eb3de0c4","20d7e9267be95d9bb7264dd0aa47cc9875c5b848","7129ba82afcc64daea8925d866a5264adac2c4c0","edaeade33b1bea3a87d37a12bb8f89fd331a997b","59d53cd70da8fe13390c312113f8e26275581a29","ab689fddd4aa3f14bbf5622d47287f182a4f00e9","f6efd2330b85cd01bde00ac0a18634ff2f4c9655","76b651f0c9051db78621731987ef769747261871","c6ada78bacbcae0f53632ba701ce0a724da8f63d"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Neuromedin B receptors retain functional expression when transfected into BALB 3T3 fibroblasts: analysis of binding, kinetics, stoichiometry, modulation by guanine nucleotide-binding proteins, and signal transduction and comparison with natively expressed receptors.","doi":"","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"Molecular pharmacology"}
