One type of such syntactic dependencies is filler-gap dependencies. In contrast, the Generalized Slowing Hypothesis claims that SLI children have a domain-general deficit affecting processing speed and capacity.\n\n\nAIMS\nTo test contrasting accounts of SLI we investigate processing of syntactic (filler-gap) dependencies in wh-questions.\n\n\nMETHODS & PROCEDURES\nFourteen 10;2-17;2 G-SLI children, 14 age-matched and 17 vocabulary-matched controls were studied using the cross-modal picture-priming paradigm.\n\n\nOUTCOMES & RESULTS\nG-SLI children's processing speed was significantly slower than the age controls, but not younger vocabulary controls. The G-SLI children and vocabulary controls did not differ on memory span. However, the typically developing and G-SLI children showed a qualitatively different processing pattern. The age and vocabulary controls showed priming at the gap, indicating that they process wh-questions through syntactic filler-gap dependencies. In contrast, G-SLI children showed priming only at the verb.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe findings indicate that G-SLI children fail to establish reliably a syntactic filler-gap dependency and instead interpret wh-questions via lexical-thematic information. These data challenge the Generalized Slowing Hypothesis account, but support the CGC hypothesis, according to which G-SLI children have a particular deficit in the computational system affecting syntactic dependencies involving 'movement'. As effective remediation often depends on aetiological insight, the discovery of the nature of the syntactic deficit, along side a possible compensatory use of semantics to facilitate sentence processing, can be used to direct therapy. However, the therapeutic strategy to be used, and whether such similar strengths and weaknesses within the language system are found in other SLI subgroups are empirical issues that warrant further research.","inCitations":["e4131b66082abb2b65d30ca7f64c82507415c261","37fb7cde1209c66ebb483a0e7ef34befaa071192","0c462bf47f9f5b8cf2abdc7b7569d260ba6622c3","8bc1394353675c585db86716a6388d1844afea74","d5465f7479a6e6b15904b09bb37432761bca880a","3fc68ad1cf0ff5daa83fd5ea393c0f17b27a1a5c","9768d272010f1c3b0e9f783f3c5435bc7ba9fcd0","c163ee58270b42dba760ff635522ceb1acdcead4","17eb0423bfbc5f32386c35d623a778d84e911a24","c3732aee3196427575252d8f316359b1b615625f","779a0f8f6229555d5df198d630a57ade4ce91a19","99b1fc41fe25957379624fcea5e844302b488aa2","81c10917233842f47c7d10a3fa3b994228d14818","7e3483123363b2fc76c0a2f6387be4674fcd9071","3151e95cf542b146aa7defdd6fa3596a34fa6749","31afc5850f8fccf3f7dfb0bd531744a3a5b1e36b","e1d7af74cbc21ee1717d0740b8dce70e0c6781b5","5ddd3e895786d03458e873dc00c704e85c48ba30","7b4f11960c2b979771621001f9a684679ef20cf3","ecdbf03eaf694d1a20ba32c967cbe108dc10136b","1100a56a24c82798a779279f1a728cc82a53ba3b","6e9e693cb814ddd5ce34d9a78ceb7c56254bfde2","e537f3d0afde7ed6dcc68d990a82ca42a52555cd","d48753840128cd1cd806935404ec7c0aa91a280d","706e860bf8b316eb847a4a5e1b8aec95d172f5a2","29b317233c7780976dbad5e3c3035cbc234ed17c","98f679e350f68ff0edca690d04382bbf754fc4a5","1e15fbc447426278e9e01ee05d7d78462de97830","e382c085980f52ee9e79632a3ac0360eb3b33a9c","217bb4da4d88167cc424ec1bc15336c0884c136e","fef0dfefaea60eead88c7ec0f10429f5455a88ac","f201b7d849fefb9705fdee688e515ad5707aa01b","7e94e9aec527c34381e95a23996ffcfaf4f0ad42","2bb3fec7e97e6cf4a8f5f8d797efbc8bc18fa2cf","98324d9d9687651afa7f39f2a43e5348db5c2ac3","f3b4d1e1faf9f6f38a5c89378bd748d3dec7e491","20297ca22493c2a5802058cc20820eb4db3a01cf","546a63dc79ab15064176f9951724b64179465827","c661cc066b054b3b24aadcc6b81933090896d089","19ece27089252db6f17e4eef8d452f3ac4e6e56d","648b2d3f09d1df2f93290800fdbb22ba2e419ab4","db700c906f5ad21eb01e150c721536329ed70dc7","cee0adb148f3700b76a173321ea0ffc5efac95fc","a3ac374339d090fcf592079c9d276dee3119a699","5f170a7a69ebca6334efb8a70d6a22df40a20057","3a708f8e9c0bd442d133867089d7072d7ddc488c"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.personal.reading.ac.uk/~lls05tm/papers/Marinis&vanderLely2007.pdf","http://scholar.harvard.edu/vanderlely/files/2007_marinis__vdl__ijldc.pdf"],"title":"On-line processing of wh-questions in children with G-SLI and typically developing children.","doi":"10.1080/13682820601058190","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1080/13682820601058190","venue":"International journal of language & communication disorders"}

ABSTRACT 1, 25‐dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1, 25 (OH)2 D3) and mechanical stimuli in physiological environment contributes greatly to osteoporosis pathogenesis. Wide investigations have been conducted on how 1, 25‐dihydroxyvitamin D3 and mechanical stimuli separately impact osteoblasts. This study reports the collective influences of 1, 25‐dihydroxyvitamin D3 and flow shear stress (FSS) on biological functions of osteoblasts. 1, 25 (OH)2 D3 were prepared in various kinds of concentrations (0, 1, 10, 100nmmol/L), while physiological fluid shear stress (12dynes/cm2) was produced by using a parallel‐plate fluid flow system. 1, 25 (OH)2 D3 affects the responses of ROBs to FSS, including the inhibition of NO release and cell proliferation as well as the promotion of PGE2 release and cell differentiation. These findings provide a possible mechanism by which 1, 25(OH)2 D3 influences osteoblasts’ responses to FSS, thus most probably providing guidance for the selection of 1, 25(OH)2 D3 concentration and mechanical loading in order to produce functional bone tissues in vitro.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2017/06/05/146159.full.pdf","https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0039128X17302143","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0039128X17302143?dgcid=api_sd_search-api-endpoint"],"title":"The collective influence of 1, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 with physiological fluid shear stress on osteoblasts","doi":"10.1016/j.steroids.2017.11.004","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.steroids.2017.11.004","venue":"Steroids"}

Technology has revolutionized our understanding of body composition abnormalities, clinical prognostication, and disease follow-up, but translation to bedside is limited, especially in terms of cost effectiveness. Computed tomography gained increased attention in cancer and sarcopenia studies, for instance. Other methods also have interesting features and applications, including bedside ultrasonography, bioelectrical impedance analysis, and dual x-ray absorptiometry. Compelling evidence indicates these methods can be used to accurately and precisely measure skeletal muscle mass, adipose tissue, and edema; diagnose malnutrition-related diseases; and aid in determining prognoses. To apply this technology properly, it is important to understand the advantages and disadvantages of each technique in specific situations of interest. This review introduces concepts and reference studies published in the scientific literature about these techniques and describes important limitations and considerations necessary to incorporate these methods into clinical practice.","inCitations":["744bda1182728b8b56bcde0cc82076c6d46d243e","25f1671d440777379efd1d1fb0343a55382c7a0c","9e23b62e78e10a757468b745bd2a86c844af13ad","43f6e2680e6789fc4961b84a32affab194f42d8f"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Current technologies in body composition assessment: advantages and disadvantages.","doi":"10.1016/j.nut.2018.11.028","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nut.2018.11.028","venue":"Nutrition"}

It is meaningful to go through the list of his major artwork, however, the most significance of his artwork is an expression of his subtle mind shown in the face and pose of woman as well as an expression of female fragrance and the texture of female body. His later artwork from Hujinsogakujuttai 《婦人相?十?》 Hujinnsogakujuppon(婦人相?十品) to kasenkoinobu 《歌撰?之部》 Hokkokugosikizumi 《北?五色墨》composes the genealogy of the ‘Large neck picture of beautiful woman(美人大首?)’. The genealogy was held back after Hokkokugosikizumi 《北?五色墨》 yet it was succeeded by Hujinsogakujittai 《婦人相?拾?》(大判十枚?) in 1801 during the Kyouwa period. However, the series of his successive artwork of the ‘Large neck picture’ during the Kyouwa period were criticized by the lack of depth because of excessive lucidity. One of the reason that the ‘Large neck picture’ of Utamaro during the Kansei period is most highlighted today derives from the resulting effect by close-up of woman\"s face in his artwork. On each page of the Assortment consisted of 5 to 10 pages, significantly different and unique women\"s inner beauty is well expressed, which could not be thought previously. Later, the genealogy the ‘Large neck picture’ of Utamaro was ended, however, the ‘Large neck picture’ introduced the new form which was most unique and innovative at that time. His artwork of the ‘Large neck picture’ added a new chapter in the genre painting of beautiful woman and it was considered most advanced before the introduction of photography.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"관정기 기타가와 우타마로의 오쿠비에에 관한 일고찰","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Substantial variation in bandgap noise is observed which is demonstrated to be largely uncorrelated to bandgap trim voltage.

This study evaluates the protein–ligand interaction for iomazenil and flumazenil in rats by comparing feq and favail. Repeated measurements of blood–brain barrier permeability for two benzodiazepine antagonists were performed in 44 rats by the double-indicator technique. Cerebral blood flow was measured by intracarotid Xe-injection. The apparent permeability–surface product (PSapp) was measured while CBF or bolus composition was changed. Comparison of PSapp obtained in the absence and presence of 5% albumin in the injectate yielded favail, whereas feq was measured by equilibrium dialysis. Iomazenil and flumazenil favail was 62% and 82%, respectively, whereas feq was significantly lower, 42% and 61%. The PSapp for iomazenil and flumazenil increased significantly by 89% and 161% after relative CBF increases of 259% and 201%, respectively. The results demonstrate that application of feq in neuroreceptor studies underestimates the plasma input function to the brain. Model simulations render possible that the differences between favail and feq as well as the effect of CBF on PSapp can be caused by capillary heterogeneity.","inCitations":["bbf7bf0ae2fbb1ad5721248047e989b300bef44c","878fd79a5e88f007536fc7a2e203e7a2ca430bdc","0c91222507655448c5ed5e7e21d8edb84b9c416b"],"pdfUrls":["http://jcb.sagepub.com/content/19/9/948.full.pdf"],"title":"Blood—Brain Barrier Transport and Protein Binding of Flumazenil and Iomazenil in the Rat: Implications for Neuroreceptor Studies","doi":"10.1097/00004647-199909000-00002","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1097/00004647-199909000-00002","venue":"Journal of cerebral blood flow and metabolism : official journal of the International Society of Cerebral Blood Flow and Metabolism"}

There are, however, few works focusing on wireless network coding over fading channels, which is an important characteristic of many real wireless channels and may result in performance degradation. To investigate the fading channel's impact on network coding, based on the constant transmission power scheme and the channel inversion-transmission scheme, we analyze network throughput over Rayleigh fading channels. It is shown that, when the difference between average channel gains over two broadcasting channels is very large, the throughput of network coding greatly decreases, and the advantage of network coding almost disappears. To address this issue and to maximize the throughput of network coding over fading channels, we formulate the fading compensation for network coding as optimization problems and present the optimal transmission data rate and transmission power level of the relay node. Furthermore, to consider the realization problem of network coding over fading channels, including unbalanced traffic load and asynchronization of packet arrivals, we present two opportunistic optimal network coding (OONC) schemes. Performance evaluation has shown that the proposed opportunistic schemes perform well in various scenarios.","inCitations":["3b1ec3b68d4c944e834af4d17ce09bda0bd3cd39","3d0c78def79c44757bcd767e589e7e131cb98d8e","1fc4a4e1207c4c4ebf57a4198002b0881fb57111","0665b4b7ae9c8b4f23238dd69ee063dac297899e","f713b9eb90f3106c8dc06a9f96f7c515e42ea0d7","6078910529807e80ce0f5b68e5b590fa1d1c6cd3","1cc74eb5910ddc88b870cdf9a74c48f1ca417120","0db4b67700220948964790ce1ed35a8baea13acd","cd904351ec997a6faa054d5a850d3bee8b9e17ab","41737b4be51d75cc02bb5d3971264546cb9dd274","9d3614a044c48c52fba3538b75d4b741f9b4e1bb","ea6d17ad65e1eb99857ba823f1079b5525cfe914","7aed17ee90951529e34a6a69baf8060fac2ccf7e","462af61f62df9d9d884478a48a5ee8f2a57fc7be","c45e7a70b8d5efd3b0416720ddef3abb89bc2ef1","5e978b9648081eeb9ef7e3914b0327700c7b99e5","039393b1e4b811bdd1eaa205dcdeef0bfc36ab47","0aa61b86a1a5c6e4b17718387c0496565191f1d9","31494cc7b6b81893aaf0c5e1825e383bb56f3f9a","a9ce33064c59eeeaf24036697626d78ae74bec80","b9878f0756f7b1594e24937f7d534076c733dce0","6d3d499693d8ca87fbf143bacec98ace579ca99e","aed63fe9aa685e398a68dc36a0b0e40169834b45","0f34c873c0f6880d0880f3074df0087f23ffbcaa","5eb79ff79bf1681338baf0aa93a0df362f945d18","74193e7ed82e506d2195a3e9bc3576a21d87ff25","057337f0d5cb765a55ea59eb96890f78bcc67d34","bbb24999bce17d89431b9c26703895f85b752575","dca681e332a776b9a224a4947b64f64345d209e9","1d7809606e2e0cce06632bea7bf3e9543337dc5d","31fd64923be3b1fe035a0564baca70073ef79655","50ed1d320d90682629b9faff27560c801e82d177","c3ce978457f55642bf8931c815721b80d2262a3c","039c866e2d4d09f099ce420ab397085306cde049","77fdebc26351642dc81d2f6f10fcd17b0ad24a55","dbe2717501a791d2edd0aa9e3f8c76b41141fbf4","1de6c1c529609ac7957a2d5071352d93576b9ecc"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.researchgate.net/profile/Pingyi_Fan/publication/224148524_Network_Coding_for_Two-Way_Relaying_Networks_Over_Rayleigh_Fading_Channels/links/00b495195d94ebdbe4000000.pdf","https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Pingyi_Fan/publication/224148524_Network_Coding_for_Two-Way_Relaying_Networks_Over_Rayleigh_Fading_Channels/links/00b495195d94ebdbe4000000.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2010.2053947"],"title":"Network Coding for Two-Way Relaying Networks Over Rayleigh Fading Channels","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2010.2053947","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2010.2053947","venue":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology"}

A huge decrease in their saturation magnetization M M (5 K) under pressure was observed with an extreme value of pressure parameter d ln  M M (5 K)/d P  = −56 × 10 −3  GPa −1 in the case of the Ni 39 Co 11 Mn 34 Ga 16 alloy. The Curie temperature T C A increases under pressure in all the studied alloys. Almost identical values of d T C A /d P  = +4.7 ÷ +5.9 K GPa −1 point to a normalized steepness of a dependence of exchange interactions on interatomic distances. The values of paramagnetic effective moments, m eff , are identical in both structural phases of the alloys and they lie in a narrow interval from 4.6 μ B to 5.7 μ B . Furthermore, the Co-doped alloys show a very strong pressure dependence on the structural critical temperature T M – A , with values of d T M – A /d P up to +34 K GPa −1 , the highest reported values for the Ni–Mn-based Heusler alloys. The results are discussed in light of the fundamental magnetic interactions in the Heusler alloys and from the point of view of a further exploration of their multifunctional applications.","inCitations":["f9a01b0bd026ed46ce1837a51ac99dc524208f53"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Extraordinary magnetic and structural properties of the off-stoichiometric and the Co-doped Ni2MnGa Heusler alloys under high pressure","doi":"10.1016/j.actamat.2014.06.011","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.actamat.2014.06.011","venue":""}

The strict periodicity or long-range order of the atomic arrangement—the basic assumption in solid state theory—is lost in these materials. The noncrystalline state influences mainly the electronic transport properties. Liquid metals are best suited for the investigation of the noncrystalline state because of their well-defined atomic distribution and because of the good reproducibility of the experimental results. However, many experimental difficulties, such as those associated with the application of high temperatures and the effect of corrosion, are encountered in their study. This chapter summarizes the experimental situation of the electronic and magnetic properties of liquid normal, transition, and rare earth metals and their alloys. The experimental data are compared with the results of recent theories which give a possible understanding. But the main aim of this chapter is to make the results known to a larger community and to initiate critical remarks regarding the often very simple models that have been employed. Furthermore, it would be desirable to attain new explanations and detailed comparisons with the explanations of the same effects in the solid state. Throughout this chapter the differences and similarities between the solid and liquid state are emphasized. The section on liquid normal metals is a summary of well-established experimental data and theoretical explanations.","inCitations":["b7eaa20464856e8b12e2e812e90644d8a8d62bf7","463f9bde82ad8db5f788e5915b42a5c629afb756","7b61d8e713e7f5e141ed9e884ac911d50671ce52"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Electronic Properties of Liquid Metals and Alloys","doi":"10.1016/S0081-1947(08)60426-9","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/S0081-1947%2808%2960426-9","venue":""}

Yet, southern Africa has often been regarded to have relatively few psychoactive plant species of cultural importance with little research conducted on the region's potential psychoactive flora. However, in the last decade, renewed interest has occurred in the study of psychoactive plants from southern Africa. Recent anthropological studies have demonstrated the significance of psychoactive plant medicines in the initiation process of southern African traditional healers and in treating mental illness, while numerous ethnopharmacological studies have screened southern African plants for psychotropic activity, with promising new findings and research directions resulting. Yet, despite this great progress, the indigenous cultural (ritual) uses of psychoactive plants by the indigenous people of southern Africa remains a neglected area of ethnobotanical research. Aspects identified as requiring further study include: the indigenous cultural understandings of mental illness and psychoactive plants, the role of psychoactive plants in the spiritual practices of southern African traditional healers, the influence of various psychoactive plant species used in traditional formulas and the folklore and mythology relating to indigenous psychoactive plants. Thus, much is still to be learnt and documented from the southern African traditional healers regarding their worldview and their botanical, diagnostic, methodological and healing knowledge that can provide insights into the treatment of mental illness and the actions of psychoactive plants.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Psychoactive Plants: A Neglected Area of Ethnobotanical Research in Southern Africa (Review)","doi":"10.31901/24566772.2014/08.02.07","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.31901/24566772.2014%2F08.02.07","venue":""}

Microphotographs of composite fracture surfaces bring evidence that particles of Cloisite 25A are much better dispersed in the rPET matrix than those of Cloisite Naþ. Moreover, WAXS measurements indicate that the lamellar periodicity of Cloisite 25A is increased in the composites, which evidences intercalation of rPET between silicate layers (lamellae) of the clay. In the case of Cloisite Naþ, a very small thickening of lamellae due to mixing with rPET indicates only minute intercalation. Uniaxial tensile tests show that both clays increase the modulus of the rPET composites; more effective Cloisite 25A accounts for a 30% increase at loading of 5 wt%. Yield strength remains practically unaffected by the used fractions of the clays while tensile strength slightly decreases with the clay content; in parallel, strain at break dramatically drops. Tensile compliance of the composites is virtually independent of applied stress up to 26 MPa. Essential part of the compliance corresponds to the elastic time-independent component, while the viscoelastic component is low corresponding only to a few percent of the compliance even at relatively high stresses. The compliance of the composites is only slightly lower than that of the neat rPET, the reinforcing effect of Cloisite 25A being somewhat stronger. Both clays have beneficial effect on the dimensional stability of the composites since—in contrast to the neat rPET—the creep rate does not rise at long creep periods. q 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Unfortunately, its low extent in altitude requires a high resolution calibration and limits the number of images available in the Cassini dataset. However, we show that it is possible to extract on each profile the local maximum of intensity of this layer and confirm its stability at 500 ± 8 km during the 2005–2007 period for all latitudes lower than 45°N. Using the fractal aggregate scattering model of Tomasko et al. (2008) and a single scattering radiative transfer model, it is possible to derive the optical properties required to explain the observations made at different phase angles. Our results indicates that the aerosols have at least ten monomers of 60 nm radius, while the typical tangential column number density is about 2 · 1010 agg m − 2 . Moreover, we demonstrate that these properties are constant within the error bars in the southern hemisphere of Titan over the observed time period. In the northern hemisphere, the size of the aerosols tends to decrease relatively to the southern hemisphere and is associated with a higher tangential opacity. However, the lower number of observations available in this region due to the orbital constraints is a limiting factor in the accuracy of these results. Assuming a fixed homogeneous content we notice that the tangential opacity can fluctuate up to a factor 3 among the observations at the equator. These variations could be linked with short scale temporal and/or longitudinal events changing the local density of the layer.","inCitations":["0638a3fb5396de498413c30a96fcfcc719e3c340","a42eb51df61fb04f93ea953ab2f255b5382f603f"],"pdfUrls":["https://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.00842v1.pdf"],"title":"Aerosols optical properties in Titan’s detached haze layer before the equinox","doi":"10.1016/j.icarus.2017.03.026","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.icarus.2017.03.026","venue":""}

We were not able to show reversible formation of malic acid with oxaloacetic acid and reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate, nor of oxaloacetic acid with pyruvic acid and CO(2).","inCitations":["280a5927c718d4a1bd2b74ca288efcf2ec5c3576"],"pdfUrls":["http://jb.asm.org/content/89/4/1051.full.pdf"],"title":"Preliminary Enzymatic Events in Asparagine-dependent Denitrification by Pseudomonas Perfectomarinus.","doi":"10.1128/jb.89.4.1051-1054.1965","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1128/jb.89.4.1051-1054.1965","venue":"Journal of bacteriology"}

Microsoft Excel spreadsheets with Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) software is, arguably, the most commonly employed general purpose tool for MC simulation. Despite the popularity of the Excel in many industries and educational institutions, it has been repeatedly criticized for its flaws and often described as questionable, if not completely unsuitable, for statistical problems. The purpose of this study is to assess suitability of the Excel (specifically its 2010 and 2013 versions) with VBA programming as a tool for MC simulation. The results of the study indicate that Microsoft Excel (versions 2010 and 2013) is a strong Monte Carlo simulation application offering a solid framework of core simulation components including spreadsheets for data input and output, VBA development environment and summary statistics functions. This framework should be complemented with an external high-quality pseudo-random number generator added as a VBA module. A large and diverse category of Excel incidental simulation components that includes statistical distributions, linear and non-linear regression and other statistical, engineering and business functions require execution of due diligence to determine their suitability for a specific MC project.","inCitations":["7ce5e58430f7fcab8f5948c53c0dbb58238bd9b4","40affcefc0cbe32f7f85590bcadee8fe32881b83"],"pdfUrls":["https://arxiv.org/pdf/1503.08376v1.pdf","https://epublications.bond.edu.au/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1179&context=ejsie&httpsredir=1&referer=","http://arxiv.org/pdf/1503.08376v1.pdf","http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.08376"],"title":"Assessing Excel VBA Suitability for Monte Carlo Simulation","doi":"","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"ArXiv"}

Two ruptures were due to gunshot wounds and 58 were secondary to a pelvic fracture. There were 58 repairs done by the perineal approach and 5 required an abdominal perineal approach.\n\n\nRESULTS\nSurgical complications included 2 (3%) rectal injuries, 3 (5%) repeat strictures that required reoperation and 20 (32%) repeat strictures that required dilation or visual internal urethrotomy. By 1 year after surgery all patients had a patent urethra and did not require further treatment. At 1 year 43 (72%) patients voided normally, 5 (8.3%) were areflexic and performed self-catheterization, 5 (8.3%) had urge incontinence and 5 (8.3%) had mild stress incontinence requiring no treatment. Moderate stress incontinence responded to imipramine in 1 case and collagen injection in 1. Of the patients who were potent preoperatively 31 (52%) remained potent postoperatively. Of the 29 (48%) patients who were impotent preoperatively and immediately postoperatively 9 regained potency at 1 year.

When educational and behavioral intervention failed in reducing such behaviors, pharmacological management would be necessary. We presented here a clinical vignette of treatment of inappropriate sexual behaviors in an adolescent boy with autistic disorder. We further made a review of the literature on its pharmacological management. Our review revealed very limited documentation with only some cases studies that have reported successful treatment by several medications. More controlled studies are needed.","inCitations":["ac91955964a1a0a2f5cd1f91cd5ab0a4399ec9a8","3e657b7f4e13db5d2d416c5b1cec8988700be13a"],"pdfUrls":["https://projet.chu-besancon.fr/pmb/PMB_Ecoles/opac_css/doc_num.php?explnum_id=1425"],"title":"Pharmacological management of inappropriate sexual behaviors in youth with autism spectrum disorder: A case study and review of the literature","doi":"10.1016/j.neurenf.2016.03.005","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neurenf.2016.03.005","venue":""}

Abstract: The Role of Islamic Treatment Method “Cupping Therapy” to Decrease Blood Glucose Levels . Cupping therapy has long been used by most Muslims and it has occupied as prominent position among therapeutic approaches.The proof of medical modern research lately have been supports expediency therapy which recommended by the prophet. Nowdays,many medical experts who know the benefits of cupping therapy in treating diseases. Diabetes melitus is a disease that is directly related to blood glucose levels. According to the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) in 2013, there were 382 million people suffer from diabetes melitus worldwide and Indonesia as seventh ranks in the world. This study aims to determine the effect of cupping therapy on blood glucose levels in patients of Klinik Sehat dr. Abdurrahmân Medan in 2014. The Study used pre-experimental method with one group pre-test and post-test without a control group and sample took by randomization with a sample of 32 people. Based on the Wilcoxon test with a = 0.05 obtained  p-value = 0.021 that means there were a significant differences in mean blood glucose levels before and after cupping therapy (p-value < a).

Like traditional IDS games, originally introduced by economists and risk-assessment experts Heal and Kunreuther about a decade ago, generalized IDS games model agents' voluntary investment decisions when facing potential direct risk and transfer-risk exposure from other agents. A distinct feature of generalized IDS games, however, is that full investment can reduce transfer risk. As a result, depending on the transfer-risk reduction level, generalized IDS games may exhibit strategic complementarity (SC) or strategic substitutability (SS). We consider three variants of generalized IDS games in which players exhibit only SC, only SS, and both SC+SS. We show that determining whether there is a pure-strategy Nash equilibrium (PSNE) in SC+SS-type games is NP-complete, while computing a single PSNE in SC-type games takes worst-case polynomial time. As for the problem of computing all mixed-strategy Nash equilibria (MSNE) efficiently, we produce a partial characterization. Whenever each agent in the game is indiscriminate in terms of the transfer-risk exposure to the other agents, a case that Kearns and Ortiz originally studied in the context of traditional IDS games in their NIPS 2003 paper, we can compute all MSNE that satisfy some ordering constraints in polynomial time in all three game variants. Yet, there is a computational barrier in the general (transfer) case: we show that the computational problem is as hard as the Pure-Nash-Extension problem, also originally introduced by Kearns and Ortiz, and that it is NP-complete for all three variants. Finally, we experimentally examine and discuss the practical impact that the additional protection from transfer risk allowed in generalized IDS games has on MSNE by solving several randomly-generated instances of SC+SS-type games with graph structures taken from several real-world datasets.","inCitations":["7e2b083688d720c80e5e8e9076efc84ea78eafe4","49c1e45ce781406d14190dde478b4af1305366fc","4ceb07e4414064f8e847d4b7e1f9fcea5befa07e"],"pdfUrls":["http://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~hauchan/Hi!_files/Chan_Ortiz_NIPS14_Sup_Final_1.pdf","http://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~hauchan/Hi!_files/Chan_Ortiz_NIPS14_Final_1.pdf","http://papers.nips.cc/paper/5585-computing-nash-equilibria-in-generalized-interdependent-security-games.pdf","http://machinelearning.wustl.edu/mlpapers/paper_files/NIPS2014_5585.pdf","https://cse.unl.edu/~hchan/Chan_Ortiz_NIPS14_Final.pdf","http://papers.nips.cc/paper/5585-computing-nash-equilibria-in-generalized-interdependent-security-games","http://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~hauchan/Hi!_files/Chan_Ortiz_NIPS14_Final.pdf","https://cse.unl.edu/~hchan/Chan_Ortiz_NIPS14_Sup_Final.pdf","http://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~hauchan/Hi!_files/Chan_Ortiz_NIPS14_Sup_Final.pdf"],"title":"Computing Nash Equilibria in Generalized Interdependent Security Games","doi":"","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"NIPS"}

Comparison of the results showed that 87.3% strains were recognised as L. monocytogenes with both tests and expressed haemolytic activity. The PCR enabled to classify 3 strains of uncertain biochemical identification. Two non-haemolytic strains were confirmed to be L. monocytogenes with both tests. In the case of the third non-haemolytic isolate, the results of both tests were contradictory. None of the analysed strains remained unidentified.

The tactics of volleyball are generally divided into two types, one is personal tactics and the other is collective tactics. The so-called personal tactics are the players’ adjustments in the match according to the situation of the match and the opponent. The so-called collective technology is the mutual cooperation among members to complete planned and purposeful tactical changes. Personal tactics and collective tactics are complementary, and promote each other, thus ensuring the victory of the match. Team members should use tactics based on the basic situation of the team first, and then change the tactics according to the situation of the other team members. Therefore, improving tactical awareness is not only the need of volleyball development, but also the development of an excellent volleyball team, which shows that the cultivation of tactical awareness of the second setter is particularly important.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://webofproceedings.org/proceedings_series/ESSP/ICEM%202019/ICEM19168.pdf"],"title":"Study on the Awareness Cultivation and Training Methods of the Volleyball Setters ’ Tactics","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Goldman At last, a Michael Crichton novel you can put down, a vilification of science that does not make compelling reading. Next is a veritable catalogue of what could go wrong with biotechnology. This is what would happen if every patent attorney and judge had a prefrontal lobotomy (done the humane way using RNA interference, of course), in case the bioethicists hadn’t warned you already. Crichton tries to address every aspect of the biotechnology craze at once, giving the book too many simultaneous plotlines to follow. The result is no single story you really want to stick with to the end. The book is certainly entertaining at times. There is a smart-beaked African grey parrot named Gerard, rather self-centred and with a British accent. In exile because he imitated his owner’s husband in a liaison with another woman in the house, Gerard manages to help a chimpanzee with a raspy voice and bad grammar rescue an ordinary little kid from being abducted for his liver. Meanwhile, a cocaineaddicted good-for-nothing thirty-something finally snorts a concoction that turns his life around: an experimental virus containing a human ‘maturity gene’. The transgenic orangutan who curses in Dutch could use a whiff of that stuff as well. Body parts and eggs are traded like commodities, and genetically engineered fish display illuminated advertising billboards on their sides. I admit that Crichton had me going with the Tyrannosaurus rex in Jurassic Park, but somehow that was a bit more believable, and had a lot more suspense. One story line concerns BioGen’s ownership of Frank Burnet’s cell line, which produces a cancer-fighting compound. BioGen gets a legal judgement that says they own Burnet’s cells, wherever those cells happen to be. When BioGen’s own lines are contaminated, and Burnet himself has disappeared, the company employs bounty hunters to collect the ‘property’ from Burnet’s daughter and grandson. Dave, the genetically enhanced chimpanzee, effects a rescue. The Burnet family’s attorney challenges the property decision. After an exasperating hearing, a judge finally hands down a reasonable decision — this is the first time that Next seems like anything other than an unabashed condemnation of biotechnology. Human cells, the judge says, are different from other forms of property, as one might still be attached to them, especially when they are in an unwilling body. Crichton uses extant biotechnology company names, such as BioGen and BioRad, even if he does capitalize them differently and change the trademarks. Even California senator Dianne Feinstein plays a part. Craig Venter seems to have escaped, but there’s a spiritual and influential scientist at the National Institutes of Health associated with the thrill-seeking gene. And a prominent divorce attorney to the stars discovers the value of genetic testing — for everything — in determining whether or not a parent is a good candidate for child custody. As in his previous novel, State of Fear (HarperCollins, 2004), Crichton pleads his case clearly and succinctly in an author’s note at the end of the book. He lists five points, which I take up in turn. First, Crichton contends that we should “stop patenting genes” because vague claims render it impossible to do useful research and paralyse scientific progress. Although this idea has been bandied about, there are powerful contrary arguments. Patent protection actually encourages the publication of results, and requires a full description of an invention so that it can be used by others. Patent enforcement typically does not occur until a competitor is ready to market a commercial product, at which time a user licence can be negotiated; basic research is not excluded. Crichton’s claim that a patent on ‘noses’ would exact a licence fee from perfume manufacturers is too broad an interpretation; a patent on a gene clearly does not even extend to a drug that inhibits the activity of the product of that gene. We do, however, have a problem if patents are granted too broadly and on too little information, relying strictly on enforcement actions to ascertain validity. His next claim is that we should “establish clear guidelines for the use of human tissues”. In Next, and in a commentary in The Wall Street Journal on 15 December 2006, Crichton describes a case in which a court upheld the right of Washington University to keep possession of prostate-cancer tissues donated by patients of William Catalona when he moved to Northwestern University. The ruling was astounding in that it ignored the wishes of 6,000 patients who had expressly consented to the move, thereby asserting that patients had no control over the tissues once they had left the body. This apparently contradicted the patient consent forms, which said that patients could withdraw from the study at any time, and The big screen: the film Gattaca portrayed a future in which opportunities are dictated by genetic tests.

A bulk of contraceptives on the market today is women oriented. Probably, many providers assume that women have the greatest stake and interest as far as family planning is concerned. Worst still, there is a misconception that men are indifferent or even stand in opposition to family planning. The consequences of this long neglect of developing acceptable and reliable male contraceptives in poor developing countries has been lack of or less participation of males in family planning. Recently, it has come apparent that neglecting men in matters of family planning is a losing strategy with adverse consequences for both men and women. As Africa is grappling with rapid population growth, it is now recognized that giving attention to females only can not solve the problem.","inCitations":["386aab613b885ca6122b8c18774c8a795d9e5bfe","6463d90566737789fe43c33f17b4e22689c28448"],"pdfUrls":["http://journals.sfu.ca/africanem/index.php/ajtcam/article/download/1306/848","http://www.bioline.org.br/pdf?tc11066"],"title":"Complementary and alternative medicines: the herbal male contraceptives.","doi":"10.4314/ajtcam.v8i5S.3","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.4314/ajtcam.v8i5S.3","venue":"African journal of traditional, complementary, and alternative medicines : AJTCAM"}

The baseline controller is designed using dynamic inversion approach that exploits the time scale separation principle. The design works well if the model is perfectly known. However, the quadrotor system can have uncertainty in parameters. To tackle this, a neuro-adaptive controller is augmented with the baseline controller. The approach uses a single layer neural network to learn unknown dynamics and an adaptive law is employed to ensure that the quadrotor behave in the desired manner. A Lyapunov approach is used to show that the approximated dynamics remains bounded.","inCitations":["1c0a5c1bb6d02d48bdfd65baef5aa92c4fa90a23","73aab95c1b9c00ada92f854a57c0e483674d4786","96f2c2e57fd1256c35d26054174a4599f23bb4e7","6fb6fcd7251251667854058f933b7a2075c7502e"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Neuro-adaptive Augmented Dynamic Inversion Controller for Quadrotors","doi":"10.1016/j.ifacol.2016.03.070","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ifacol.2016.03.070","venue":""}

Several recommendations exist for preservation metadata reflecting the purposes and major preoccupations of the organizations that proposed each one. Digital resources are either digital surrogates of non-digital objects, or original digital objects. In either case we may assume that, if a digital resource is selected for preservation, it can be considered as a cultural object that belongs to some collection, has a certain value and must be appropriately preserved, used and documented. In other words, although the digital nature of the resource induces specific requirements in terms of preservation policies and techniques, basic commonalities can be traced with other cultural objects at the functional level. Based on this premise, the work reported here aims at harmonizing the information structures supporting digital preservation with those for documenting nondigital cultural objects. The approach taken is to develop a conceptual model for preservation metadata that complies with a standard ontology for cultural documentation, namely CIDOC CRM. The perils faced by digital resources are related either to physical causes or to technological evolution. Correspondingly a number of preservation strategies have been developed and a preservation life cycle, independent of preservation strategy, has been identified. Furthermore, several proposals for preservation metadata have been made, five of which, appearing to be the most interesting and influential, namely the Dublin Core Metadata Element Set, the Open Archival Information System (OAIS), the Curl Exemplars Digital Archives (CEDARS) model, the Pittsburgh Project and the National Library of Australia (NLA) proposal, we analyze in order to understand their differences and to draw upon for our own model. Our model is derived from the CIDOC CRM taking into account the above metadata sets. It is intended to capture the kinds of events occurring in the digital preservation life cycle, the kinds of objects involved and the relationships among those. Thus it could be considered as an application ontology for digital preservation derived from CIDOC CRM. It includes a minimal set of concepts appropriately inter-related and specialized. The resulting model yields a metadata set that displays significant overlap with the selected pre-existing ones. Its merit lies in the inference capability stemming from the explicit semantic structure, as well as in the integration with the domain of cultural documentation.","inCitations":["5fbbaa8a1222b8d7e1dd0095bbf9d28c6339bd03","2b0616f8520add78f6cbd6a287feabc8fdeafd05","ecf1eca9273da392ddaa1a7ca8e211150497d623","4d9a9192c7de9233f661534d6a77b17643496b5e"],"pdfUrls":["https://ils.unc.edu/digccurr2007/papers/constantopoulos_paper_6-4.pdf"],"title":"1 An ontological model for digital preservation","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Plasmids pRC12 and pRC18 share a region with high DNA identity (> 83% identity between RepA, a Type II toxin-antitoxin system and a tyrosine integrase genes) and are stably maintained in their natural host L. curvatus CRL 705. Both plasmids are low copy number and belong to the theta-type replicating group. While pRC12 is a pUCL287-like plasmid that possesses iterons and the repA and repB genes for replication, pRC18 harbors a 168 amino acid replication protein affiliated to RepB, which was named RepB'. Plasmid pRC18 also possesses a pUCL287-like repA gene but it was disrupted by an 11 kb insertion element that contains RepB', several transposases/IS elements, and the lactocin Lac705 operon. An Escherichia coli / Lactobacillus shuttle vector, named plasmid p3B1, carrying the pRC18 replicon (i.e. repB' and replication origin), a chloramphenicol resistance gene and a pBluescript backbone, was constructed and used to define the host range of RepB'. Chloramphenicol-resistant transformants were obtained after electroporation of Lactobacillus plantarum CRL 691, Lactobacillus sakei 23K and a plasmid-cured derivative of L. curvatus CRL 705, but not of L. curvatus DSM 20019 or Lactococcus lactis NZ9000. Depending on the host, transformation efficiency ranged from 102 to 107 per μg of DNA; in the new hosts, the plasmid was relatively stable as 29-53% of recombinants kept it after cell growth for 100 generations in the absence of selective pressure. Plasmid p3B1 could therefore be used for cloning and functional studies in several Lactobacillus species.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Nucleotide sequence and analysis of pRC12 and pRC18, two theta-replicating plasmids harbored by Lactobacillus curvatus CRL 705","doi":"10.1371/journal.pone.0230857","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0230857","venue":"PloS one"}
