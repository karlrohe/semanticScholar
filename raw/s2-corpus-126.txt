A strong genetic component is involved in the pathogenesis of CD with virtually all individuals that develop the disease carrying HLA-DQ alleles that encode specific HLA-DQ2 or HLA-DQ8 heterodimers. Consumption of cereals rich in gluten triggers a chronic intestinal inflammation in genetically susceptible individuals leading to the development of CD. Emerging evidence has implicated a central role for IL-15 in the orchestration and perpetuation of inflammation and tissue destruction in CD. Therefore, IL-15 represents an attractive target for development of new therapies for CD. Transgenic mice that express human IL-15 specifically in enterocytes (T3(b)-hIL-15 Tg mice) develop villous atrophy and severe duodeno-jejunal inflammation with massive accumulation of NK-like CD8(+) lymphocytes in the affected mucosa. We used these mice to demonstrate that blockade of IL-15 signaling with an antibody (TM-beta1) that binds to murine IL-2/IL-15Rbeta (CD122) leads to a reversal of the autoimmune intestinal damage. The present study, along with work of others, provides the rationale to explore IL-15 blockade as a test of the hypothesis that uncontrolled expression of IL-15 is critical in the pathogenesis and maintenance of refractory CD.","inCitations":["e61a221d98eef2534b5f0bbe2d82e2848bfba027","24e9b66a431cda7a97bf39620d80896f08acc215","78433f3eea9e9c639c9dee86648719e0a8c19dfa","40e0388fe1ea91e61b0c34f42adaa5944e9d7f6e","747f11dc8567139052da52af0828f619a82bac94","8df11b7e52f70588546d42a7f9b5289234de9ff6","5e0f68c3c8040c3efc857501f36802879d7c5662","52c3667e5299670c2ad3e39e1ff037988970b8f6","4df36a1500c5f8cc5bc6616353cff006e142ab6c","7516cd214de1c8b0db5f27f77638cf0a5aeee420","0612ae1dacb6b412cb8c793bbb1d1c3fe12b0ca3","3f88713422bdb505e888242750d25bffed2b51ec","514f01c8325c8b22d6ab0f58f350f59f807a5f35","e24ed3e25faeef5784c309f1062ca0f6248e3fbf","01dc361cfe4771c2d2f67428905d6ac0de2feeff","d898930ce51430e066ae86ed2e300b6ad03f7d68","0863fbfd09931e28828466d811fafce838cf189e","53544b568a13c26b2edb0cc930aeaa34dd8fcee3","1bd947e29c81723b7a4a2fe69fd1dc81442789d3","ef99125a6b5eb4050a44677720425b8df9bec07a","30217ea810564c1391ea38e99888da258e63185d","6ddcc47d8bf93232b1aa0d9536007cb348462872","9e5e1e40b997b8c6b6bf7b6de363f8f8ecd16949","da7f2a95acd3f82fdbf2fb3e5580df7f07dacb84","b6252a4316c5fef46cf72d16aff080dcf3697b5e","dade4be407a09765bc00215cc1fac22b2db4fce0","439c1406e3a114b2e5c6c5a4a41d085542cecd22","ec447bc6d7366658f82686728ceb2a21473f7714","e228935fd27428fb4d0a4d850666df162d6b9fc6","ceca1ac9806d2cd825729a299134e46b5f8b2e0b","bc22a6a2dc15bf16fa44be0e48e48de0e6d19041","7fc7256260b6a5d0d72881e8e617911895c11013","813b148ececc490e6482c50d7f3bcecd919e5b05","a974dc508f36e52b92862739ba976515a5da29bd","7d481d1fc91c3bb7c4606582ed72a72de23b3d53","faf7b05df21c8a58ffbda07d1c75b31f0d023005","ac6ca87c7e62e03fb98e59753fa5865181dfcb24","68ea5d4fce250588875b2f68f353541f59347ede","34a081b0fd1ac74a6be35561d55adde7956b8890","de1e4bcd3c42ac9c6692706410061b38458f154b","4e124d1836639318e4f98b5f3e1553c932539954","8db17f96b1c59838d9318f13b17226cee21e2c1c","7f5d25feac9eb8d1bbde7634fd7c0f607a581e54","d3c262f7fd93ebb62b8e8cb061f3067f4d1b4553","975867540995c2c99fe2144f12dfbaa4a49e0de6","e50d5d35e1dc35d4f7b9b08ee2d7b5972e6103ac","cbada5e09e542dfc2b21af4ae2cbac78f28b2f93","8d01dda2290329a34af8deea8291c0b744db5995","9c5366ffda3c4f0fa85f99f719f6705a2aeb807c","02b3164e402141f6193ff43ec3735c0237ed1e61","7bb6edfcc8edc355ec16f4fc67f9ef78d4f4892d","3d5646f22b11d553b39d1bc1061b270ca18b0253","252dcc194993f09b290997e482f4aafb956525ed","1d22132edfec51996c049e29261f6bca9be9481e","1d842c1e45cbb81ab6a41255e5dba7a5f05bb4c3","e17bca72d5125641065c5f9ba0fd74b8a4ef25b4","09d72345ad48864f41f20a608873554ef6b3c86c","e885d28836ac5700a0459245f03585dc5c7fe29d","fceb9513414b049f86c0e7b252a5fcc31d415402","83c57c2c47f4b9e0f85020f9bb8bbfd09010eb15","1ebe24ee8167614c6076f8086f500d77c1e1ad55","4b6bcdd95160b6cdf92e479261baf0cfdbff38ce","bb9320e561acacb99e3dfcf0322bf26590e24663","00d460b6b096a57fd99f141701a46368a3adaa2d"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.pnas.org/content/106/37/15849.full.pdf"],"title":"Antibody-mediated blockade of IL-15 reverses the autoimmune intestinal damage in transgenic mice that overexpress IL-15 in enterocytes.","doi":"10.1073/pnas.0908834106","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0908834106","venue":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America"}

This variability is of clinical relevance when the magnitude is substantial and the therapeutic index for a particular agent, such as the aminoglycosides, is narrow. Age-related differences in drug disposition for children are accommodated empirically by adjusting adult doses to pediatric doses based on body size. However, this approach does not consider the maturational effects on hepatic function, renal function, and body composition in children. Clinical pharmacology information for commonly used antibiotics is provided as a basis for making informed decisions among agents with similar antimicrobial activity. The pharmacokinetic characteristics of absorption, distribution, and elimination are discussed for the various antimicrobial classes, including the β-lactams, aminoglycosides, and macrolide antibiotics.","inCitations":["caa9d1af3fcf55131d3b7bf9b5737f43d6f7023e","d10ea979a573d07210ec2425525271436fba7377"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Pharmacokinetics of antimicrobial therapy","doi":"10.1016/S1045-1870(98)80016-2","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/S1045-1870%2898%2980016-2","venue":""}

Short trips contribute disproportionately to emissions because of cold starts. An analysis is conducted of short-trip behavior across the US using the 1995 Nationwide Personal Transportation Survey. The data is used to develop likely scenarios of mode conversions for short trips, which are then applied to estimate emission savings using MOBILE6 cold start and running emission factors for volatile organic compounds, nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide, and carbon dioxide. The results suggest that reducing short auto trips would modestly reduce mobile source air pollution, but emission reductions are high compared to most federally-funded surface transportation interventions aimed at improving air quality. Enhanced the community pedestrian environment to encourage short trip mode conversion also produces co-benefits such as increased physical activity and subsequent reductions in chronic diseases.","inCitations":["49c1f79d82d5bf6d6cba3eff5937ce2e65e6edb3","f825033634326cc826db211219ba3a51a777c7eb","49b7847c033b2c9a0ea87d3619dfbc52d4b56406","5596b4c5a85453baa134714f58030afc5f96cc80","674a6535b081c2a6e553b6cdaf371a8543628e30","c55a5674ee6889f233f4310e0d357c3fd9e6c467","547cde6079bb54f058c707b1a2fa07e9793af6ef","6f6e9953726245b361fc14d97c4836e9d3fc2a76","5940c487d538b265eaca422748f84b811638b708","a5e7270a33d832ec291ceab11e4f0e91c6747122","928570d54b524d7a061c52a0acc29f7594803c85","75f318dabe5ec36fcea093fb3f1a24faa148ef7b","2f354c56bce64ed4d423af73fe32e8e99514d880","83f22f94efe5cdfd0d518f551a46a47430847612","07d7c9be6442a81e40e5e381e17d5924d114519f","03d9db0b0385297980644cf1ce419fecda8318d7","d116755d3ae4701de297ba820c246df073369cde","e1d39179577ad1e327d93ad4ddf8499765ef0a39","a4e94667613dfaf52025047a73d6bb0b6df11b79","b4619fd3bdf7cc359670f23fe494685838c3bd68"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Short trips: An opportunity for reducing mobile-source emissions?","doi":"10.1016/j.trd.2010.04.012","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.trd.2010.04.012","venue":""}

Elle est caracterisee par des acces recidivants de fievre, serites, myalgies et arthrites. L’association avec une spondyloarthrite est rare. La complication a long terme la plus frequente de la maladie periodique est l’amylose systemique progressive de type AA. Le traitement par la colchicine est efficace pour reduire la frequence des crises et prevenir le developpement de l’amylose. Neanmoins, on estime que 5 % des patients resistent a la colchicine. Nous rapportons ici l’observation d’un homme âge de 39 ans, ayant des antecedents d’arthrites, d’arthralgies et de sacro-iliite au cours de l’evolution d’une malade periodique. Il etait homozygote pour la mutation M694I du gene MEFV. Il developpa une myosite focale du quadriceps droit confirmee par IRM, electromyographie et histologie. Il souffrait de frequentes arthralgies malgre la colchicine, puis l’etanercept ou l’adalimumab, alterant sa qualite de vie. Il fut traite avec succes par anakinra, un antagoniste du recepteur a l’IL-1, avec une amelioration spectaculaire des symptomes articulaires et musculaires. A notre connaissance, notre cas constitue le premier associant une maladie periodique, une spondyloarthrite et une myosite, repondant au traitement par anakinra.

To date, most studies looking at culvert usage have been restricted to the dry season. This seasonal bias has limited our understanding of how different species respond to culverts and, consequently, our ability to find effective ways to promote the use of culverts as aids to species movement. The main goal of this study was to examine the role of highway culverts for mesocarnivores throughout the year. We addressed (1) the seasonality of culvert use, (2) the relative importance of culvert structure, highway features, and surrounding landscape on culvert use, (3) the influence of the water depth and cover on culvert use, and (4) the effect of culvert structure on individual behavior. Fifteen culverts were monitored along 2 highways in southern Portugal using video-surveillance cameras and marble dust for 10 consecutive days per season. We used generalized linear mixed models to determine which factors most affected the culvert use and behavior by mesocarnivores. Our results highlight the effect of seasonality and water on culvert use. Culvert use was positively related with species activity throughout the year. All species (except otters (Lutra lutra)) were less likely to use culverts that contained water more than 3 cm deep or covering more than 70 % of the culvert base. Based on our results, future surveys and culvert retrofit design should address (1) the importance of seasonality in the interpretation of results and (2) the complementarity of culvert-specific features (water, ledges, and naturalization).","inCitations":["2b7c16294cbea17a4f5602d97fca41304d4924e4","aaa6aa11bb167e7f340421503cb5151105ca90e5","2c50f9f5c1f3c9ee5713de9cdcb938a20dc7b175","b7be2dd16a7cf5dc8a942753aa57aac1bdf06feb","ee5d9733e41d7cdf899bab2eb990bb098f60813c","e18f51e8dd8eff609a87c223eebec75c3f257e18","fc74eaa7f2a44dc4e16ce2869692db86adc6729c","565f750a9c0ee73fee4f0a5093bce6f0475e8460","b338d089544497b9b1a4014deb7398fcdfe3372a","8d5da098c27842902432eceea22cd1d0cfe18784","f50c5dc688a17a5e703dcd664ff238445d641d5a","8d30a9a24ae75c5cdd86cad29b01acaff7da86a1"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.cesam.ua.pt/files/Serronha%202012.pdf","http://digital.csic.es/bitstream/10261/80408/1/10.1007-s10661-012-3020-3.pdf"],"title":"Towards effective culvert design: monitoring seasonal use and behavior by Mediterranean mesocarnivores","doi":"10.1007/s10661-012-3020-3","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10661-012-3020-3","venue":"Environmental Monitoring and Assessment"}

In order to do this, thirteen wells and five work stations on outcrops of the Interior Mountain Belt were analyzed to study the regional and vertical variations in the geochemical characteristics of the organic matter. It is possible to detect significant differences in quality and quantity of the organic matter which could corroborate the regional development of two organic facies from North to South in the Maturin Subbasin. The northern organic facies show excellent characteristics as source rock. The study of vertical distribution of organic matter was carried out in a well of northern part of the Monagas state, which represents the southern organic facies. It shows an irregular input of continental organic matter, thermally immature. Besides the organic matter content was low (around 1.5%) without depth tendencies. These sediments are clastic and bioclastic in contrast with carbonates and pelagic shales of the Guayuta Group in the Interior Mountain Belt. The outcrop samples studied show a high total organic content (2-6%) despite the high maturity determined on kerogen. The systematic study of thismore » geochemical parameter show pseudocyclic relationships with a general tendency to increase toward the bottom of the section. V, Ni, and S determinations could indicate that anoxic conditions were developing toward the North where the marine organic matter was sedimenting. The results of this study are in agreement with paleogeographic model of sedimentation during middle and late Cretaceous, with sources of sediments from South and a progressive depth of the basin toward the North.« less","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Heterogeneity of the organic matter in the Guayuta group, Eastern Venezuelan Basin","doi":"10.1306/D9CB6961-1715-11D7-8645000102C1865D","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1306/D9CB6961-1715-11D7-8645000102C1865D","venue":""}

Upon application of the new approach for clustering of the Iris dataset, processing time was reduced by three iterations over the use of Euclidean distance. Improvement in accuracy was also observed with 50% and 78% improvement over the use of Euclidean and Manhattan distances respectively.

We look at certain vine copula specifications and examine how the density of the block-maxima behaves for different block-sizes. Additionally, a real data example from hydrology is considered. In extreme-value theory for multivariate normal distributions, a certain scaling of each variable and the correlation matrix is necessary to obtain a non-trivial limiting distribution when the block-size goes to infinity. This scaling is applied to different three-dimensional vine copula specifications.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://mediatum.ub.tum.de/download/1380574/1380574.pdf"],"title":"A P ] 1 1 A pr 2 01 5 Block-Maxima of Vines","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Ethanol depressed the relaxation induced by acetylcholine and inhibited the increase in the content of intravascular cyclic GMP induced by acetylcholine, but not that induced by sodium nitroprusside or calcimycin. Ethanol also inhibited the acetylcholine-induced relaxation resistant to nitro-L-arginine. These results suggest that ethanol can inhibit the cyclic GMP-dependent relaxation mediated by endothelium-derived relaxing factor. Furthermore, ethanol seems to depress the cyclic GMP-independent relaxation mechanism.","inCitations":["45b494f982aa56b15771b334ec617d684008665d","d4a34e998cbfee92bd9eacb846d903b076089b20","ec6063ee23b01c190ea97b7ab398dac159ddbd0e","353b1cfb4c63fdbbfabf2094ebd74f762698c026","9805c5f91eaafeeac281122f94627c1b2f7f3ac3"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Mechanism of inhibitory action of ethanol on endothelium-dependent relaxation in rat aorta.","doi":"10.1016/0014-2999(93)90883-J","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/0014-2999%2893%2990883-J","venue":"European journal of pharmacology"}

This field is a significant discovery in Brazos, Grimes, and Madison Counties, Texas. Structure plays only a minor role in oil entrapment. The sand was deposited in a structural and topographic low demonstrated by comparing maximum pay sand thickness with a computer trend surface residual thick derived from Austin to Buda isopach map. Sand migration southward down the East Texas trough was deflected westward by the Angelina-Caldwell flexure and caught in a sag at the Kurten field locality. The higher Madisonville nose to the northeast has essentially no sand at the crest. Structural elevation at Madisonville and on the Angelina flexure only serves to limit sand deposition.

Atmospheric turbulence causes random fluctuations in the irradiance of the received optical laser beam, commonly referred to as scintillation. This paper investigates the use of multiple lasers and multiple apertures to mitigate the effects of scintillation. In particular, the FSO multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channel with Q-ary pulse position modulation (QPPM) and transmit repetition under the assumption of non-ideal photodetection is analyzed in terms of its uncoded bit error rate (BER) and ergodic channel capacity. This analysis is based, in part, on the use of irradiance fluctuation samples that were obtained from a laser range experiment that was conducted in the presence of moderate turbulence conditions. Expressions are derived for the log-likelihood ratio (LLR) of a received bit, uncoded BER and ergodic capacity. Using these results it is shown that large gains are possible with the use of MIMO combined with strong coding techniques.","inCitations":["56cc403a338814d4cfbc324195391bf5a8b2b1fa","2e16ff162f3ee90443c9f38dbcacdff6c9c9f29e","0e1c8a0b77aef310c20fb9e40c66a44c01d53af5","104376c265de2e7db588b498c7d24159058da90a","c25d4c20d11036ca875d017c6326bfed1d0b949d","5da0871fc7dd20ddc8a23f4e3a39a6c2229f4201","ccce259bea47e2002e9b567c7316cf920d7eafeb","bdf82ce82e4756ea0344264f0e86ae59ef7a3704","17c52a13c57a80484f7d8231e8b4af9e33f6b526","1c8d9127cadb35e23a4457e522514cc6b140b739","8bad97fcbdc7d424399351e639200cbb9c0eb16d","3158b4925a8296dfdbe939586b39978d6ba90978","aafb4a25031221f0cf1321416f5ff4c72b5be217","bece41d32a96344690cec20c5e0f7d0a35ccb7c1","9b44fc4f7afb9fbe81275f81cd03527bcff19ae7","d4f3dc91b7d62a26e5ad4c42bb7fb43dc9ed801e","21782e6894fa21e299f32c66654e4e809ca63ad0","fc8073531cf2d9a0caa3d3d8ce55992e2863ec44","0131f0c455972906813cc6be05784e06150828ce","5d7ccdc01c78cc3930b007f1708eb4f5c1974285","dc58eb8495e1d839090f84ca0942cda12b704692","d78bdea86c6a3feb89b25bdabb107217600142c5","1065b48c1b08a1c418725b7e776e28b5cd39a7e8","c5d607b3daec6fec934a07245ed82fc9cfcb66b9","72df443ff2e572f22caa7e3b89fdf0511f881556","02536d617f56879f34a4ab878cc6d47158126663","cbd81e2122d458535af74883cb23c5d7b35b5566","305ac6fbf3e2ca74208940bd98d0f28cb4d37c54","b2509152a02f43f4e84fed252bdf89ccd546ef11","dfcf8c337dfbaf1b5f85fc983ead483e0f43e7af","a8c3baf347ac8b57fe62a28bf269194f0f3d18aa","11f50db222801e940fb9cab89c953d2d511ae760","be42a85e695fa74867feda53e71c593e5d665d4e","b42d475a77db9553570b16aea10888931e70ec5c","94e2c17d5621d8cfa08dd4117a5c1c2fd60823bd","a58c0174219172f48c2d92b870eed7f4f4bf537f","9c6d88ee2adc72768a986b01804b3a51a19cc4b5","c4ff669542522f93a34fb4f721fc8eaab8b48947","f29711bd49a554aec527be78b48224a0b7d5f29a","1db877ef4c8a0f06a2bb3166d39df41e08766543","d74572db9ecb18af96da74e2313f53a38e6b02b7","2ff3b6c3ddd640df0f5986d70ab1307fea0b65ad","6fd83a30471dc2c2974fe8f1bd3e0189708a9439","789923978645c0c7f2a655c7a30faf7b2da548ae","0ff772cee642a400d910a9aa1802f33c5d2924ac","959af9c622a79e202bed13c962b2b38c6fb03778","35b2eb2397448321d786a47509ac159a3df73826","4b429c87fd24ce5b2e4a7d5a6ec0585d4d2e6d4c","328b0ba58044adb02737617d550c935043a122b3","41798f3166d4c3b5d170c6498ddba21114759e40","547d29b47c8fc0c533717238130b2b5345b0527e","5363203aa84e9480c8b909524e52da1a22ad4a2b","323009214eb77be73b37f2c9a6d74e992037f483","84df74fd6cd059fc772957dcbab46f485453acf0","6c2443ee5ec3b1a1b34768c282368ab7db734696","820398303448c3b103808002e0ccf2c1c0b5fa45","0f7ffa5bdfadcbaa95697f1ecf8d082acf496f42","b1460f5f81e6c274118e4ae367e87009571d954c","ddb7d1d7bbb5d9dd14a389763f209d9f53d2d44e","f7e9ba6dabb96668d9b39fa8ba8186fbd45abaea","a035b14e01fa05796cd0b199ba0d42b471214033","e67234dd63e7f452d6ceb5732992ef0ba0417aa7"],"pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2008.061002","http://search.ror.unisa.edu.au/record/UNISA_ALMA51109088180001831/media/digital/open/9915911297601831/12143277370001831/13143274670001831/pdf"],"title":"The Gaussian free space optical MIMO channel with Q-ary pulse position modulation","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2008.061002","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2008.061002","venue":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications"}

Due to lack of proper therapeutic target treatment options are restricted and relies primarily on chemotherapeutic modality for treatment of patients. Despite significant early regression of the disease in response to chemotherapy, complete cure is not assured with development of resistant tumors which is difficult to manage clinically. In the last decades, the regulation and contribution of microRNAs in tumorigenesis including breast cancers have been well-documented. Thus, here it is hypothesized that by identifying the microRNAs responsible for chemoresistance in TNBC and targeting the microRNAs along with chemotherapeutic approaches might exert an improved response. To accomplish this, an in vivo screening has to be performed by transfecting tumor cell line with lentiviral pool of library expressing microRNAs. Following treatment of primary tumors in mice and growth of relapsed tumors, microRNA profile has to be analyzed by qRT-PCR and sequencing to detect the microRNAs contributing to the chemoresistance which can be targeted by anti-microRNA strategies.","inCitations":["622b597e642df5c30bdc6ac7828d30bc8db4d9fa","6380f9152788d44204a125958902d88c6656cfe9","df97b3ba03e5e2eb31fe48d6f18b33ab342fe01f","7a04fa07cc414dc34b73fb77a3903c65841db0b6"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Identification and targeting of microRNAs modulating acquired chemotherapy resistance in Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC): A better strategy to combat chemoresistance.","doi":"10.1016/j.mehy.2016.09.004","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mehy.2016.09.004","venue":"Medical hypotheses"}

For this, the precise overall normalization of the 4-point function is determined through factorization. The resulting contributions to D 4 R 4 match exactly, thus providing an indirect check of SL ( 2 , Z ) duality. The two-loop heterotic low energy term D 2 F 4 is evaluated in string perturbation theory; its form is closely related to the D 4 R 4 term in type II, although its significance to duality is an open issue.","inCitations":["1bea9d4a6c8d4c244ec298fc7d1fa2d71504e23f","cd480f3545b72972dd72b0eb6d98aba755a39d3c","e6b95dc80f98b356447796dc9d03f304cc1f1369","f239db10a2eb579817cfd92976652780503aa637","bd461d91955df2c71da6655ea456466f3a83d528","a7c0ac646fe3f02a61bc9ef6806896daca20f7a2","f1180dfdff179d3b5572d2804dc3f5d84d83f3e8","f55f013c51d0c643c2d673e52117969910359220","f2b7953a642d86aa7b20ff3b2338d105462f9f67","541184f14c105d3ce65cf468494b226e27bfb9ff","4a2e1ce6ec7248113b8c321adb9670400ff6ec62","d4c320c818dd5b8f792e8c649d7d48eeadcd95cd","b0e244f1b1257478f428e6ee24fae81ebc370429","88a425995f585785e2561ece55b8cbeaecd1eb1f","91c8c66e4c29838afa8fc3851f6b26e96dd7f9b1","482c8123188ec0c9710552d75bae09872e99e551","eb94a2b37312f08ed362e079361de957566a39a8","147284e3355040271d2fe8647880f8ea1d1e235c","97da921d14e65277cb233b44f05a08e0014b6d51","c6f56dfea6444081acfb3971be83ee8c0a4bdf8d","cce51f87c2b939525e52b23570289ddd49e361e8","0462e4d7686027ee2278da4971686076822b5457","0aa28cf07800b654b4fb73c8e71d9aaccdcbc05e","f9fe5b5c8bdb67f6e7f6cdb6aa16846161ce4c70","097fede0e11edcd5775446b3f4b9e7c06e22bf6a","c2dcd3e46e7d9caa4fe067aee490a31d4bc5ed7f","184d6cdf7216b0eadd7955f9541996062d2d7dcc","e2d5e18848688f513f52b4b899dd4a532974b2f4","59a67f17060cf39f456d9ef106b6780c5174f228","0620e77335022ebc1dd30072ba7722bd7008455d","eef49614382527ee17fcd724d1a7d0fac35003e9","38c784c50e96df2bf88f710d94dc3ea699aab147","620273c7f6c2c1d9a72ba36d5b476e48729b75f4","8cc150d45e29746d100441f6a03d72f33c0281a2","f6207c9adaf3ec8509c366b82e1073eea81468db","fec43cb4186d463c38521b1daab367a5a21b50ea","0e962dd294491e771d5aac2c542a2fc4032d9c6c","c495674d986e479c816e3bd3b88452c0963145fe","c032271cd286683b4cbf3dfc427b469ce02865bc","fb3d2987db943688d2034abec8057fe863208e72","7b3fc1d2617a5d8a8d7a8557a3bcc21a67c7d499","687350664ee69f3c6b499a7c9545fd51e7bd1d9b","0d07394415b375190cab95523aeb9a049eaac89b","7a68d5f49adde298cff7fe88027b932730a14c2e","6e6597f26e4bf8d816d9a430d31500f9fb781c99","b62a8505c90db3b79e00c8a2c8614782c8ff8e3c","8251e9ccee94ac92cb12d071240caa5c3814ce8d","73c98321350ad1662da52544c72c5db449979a3d","cd089a2c9cb77957fcc4a4d7048ea91246738b5d","7b77a24c6ef0fb2dc980aae9985a55124930652b","84f4f98fe895f43de45ceb92f0fd705ec1531519","897285121cf1e9b97f0381e8ce90c5273ff9881d","5d8659b4c523a1158323f8c5d5b29701c65cf1e0","ff1671ad6cb306587cd07b4e6465120302202c3c","592051c7b085381226ac75bd752562ab7dbd4c63","e67293d05cd6307cb420a957d6f951c519b1518f","467d0da3871e3516ec433c2e7a4a51eb672cefed","36413dfd4d0515eed6eef7218f5ce679e926ac50","1043fb6c603937d14f8118211c182ca60fedc9e2","7948e5f202547a34658bb6eae4312fac3eecc168","f161a9ee6db0b22c79c92b12d56142e43c4e2372","cb8ff003397591ed2137977105099d2dc4e908ec","a00d1eda43121800b1ab299cb3a1ebe9b08fa4eb","7abc4d9eee83303e8894297aad2efd42617f4c90","74e8c4c698bb27160e84846e7ad55bd368da4c90","ca12ca8027d34dd3a492b0905963109dc365d3e6","5302bcdb659eb490cb2ccacad1e2a89573671da4","c597cd54cb410a918e8c790b4482fdc1246302b3","ee451eb340c3244c21c8fca9ca9e8de21fed7efd","8ba2eb5011a399cab44c8577ae0f801690746d61","d4360681e17c642e8f560ecb7b907e30ad40a40f","7ea1a7c906e54ba4d047efa7a024580a62f612da"],"pdfUrls":["http://arxiv.org/pdf/hep-th/0503180v1.pdf","https://arxiv.org/pdf/hep-th/0503180v1.pdf"],"title":"Two-loop superstrings and S-duality","doi":"10.1016/j.nuclphysb.2005.06.010","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nuclphysb.2005.06.010","venue":""}

CASE SUMMARY: A 66-year-old kidney transplant recipient with a history significant for hypertension, moderate mitral valve insufficiency, and decreased left ventricular function developed ventricular tachycardia posttransplant and was eventually treated with amiodarone. Maintenance immunosuppression included prednisone, azathioprine, and CsA. CsA concentrations before amiodarone initiation were stable (range 100–150 ng/mL). After amiodarone initiation, the CsA concentration increased more than twofold. Following CsA dosage reduction, concentrations returned to the desired range. The patient did not experience any toxicity with the increased concentration of CsA. DISCUSSION: The possible mechanisms of an interaction between CsA and amiodarone are reviewed. Reports of this interaction in heart transplant recipients are also reviewed. Changes in protein binding, changes in metabolism, or both may explain the interaction. Both CsA and amiodarone are protein bound and metabolized by the cytochrome P-450 enzyme system. CONCLUSIONS: It is likely that there is an interaction between CsA and amiodarone. The exact mechanism of this interaction has not been fully determined. When CsA is administered concurrently with amiodarone, CsA concentrations should be monitored closely and the CsA dosage should be adjusted as necessary.","inCitations":["183bf02be272daf6f5c436e5ebeaf543869f1e28","65d0084e34dcb65413dcf130ffb94401b35fb726","b79f81571a0b1fa410a18d625c132e6470071ce6","0d84eecd573e7b1ff0047d44196bbb66cd74d933","73889908bb6d58b024b0ed93917d705979414e88","a42f8f6b220ef42c073c4ddad3a0cb3014fecb55","9d084d29857f13520cda340b42fd04813366dbc1","9457da7b0ebb146a31ff82d3bf19cecf321fda4e","6e86368d102c3697fd53b169a8aa58801cc8fee5","cf12e551641e5ecacf28999bc4851e1e134154e1","c986af0e936f0c8f3ef74a0f84850f2dd2c68019","d6512c978b98270b071a92c7160b24f66a0eec89"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Cyclosporine-Amiodarone Interaction","doi":"10.1177/106002809302700506","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1177/106002809302700506","venue":"The Annals of pharmacotherapy"}

In the present work, the buckling analysis of laminated tapered composite beams is conducted using a higher order finite element formulation. In tapered laminates, the material and geometric discontinuities at ply drop-off locations lead to significant discontinuities in stress distributions. Higher order formulation ensures the continuity of the stress distribution through the thickness of a laminate as well as across the element interfaces, which is very important for the analysis of tapered laminates. In addition, higher order finite element formulation requires lesser number of elements in order to achieve reasonably accurate results in buckling analysis. The stiffness coefficients of the tapered laminated beam are determined in the present work based on the stress and strain transformations and the classical laminate theory. A detailed parametric study on various types of tapered composite beams is conducted.","inCitations":["49887b62c4524166d83ee636c450021a88e4e0ff","7cfcb910a240b4cc5ac739b862267365fdc75475","3d6cc8aca1161171534de2830782f4834859ef92"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Buckling Analysis of Tapered Composite Beams using a Higher Order Finite Element Formulation","doi":"10.1177/0731684409352124","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1177/0731684409352124","venue":""}

This process evaluation explored the delivery of a community based walking intervention for adults with intellectual disabilities.MethodsWalk Well was a single-blind cluster randomised controlled trial of a 12-week physical activity consultation-led walking intervention. 102 participants were randomised to the Walk Well intervention or a waiting list control group. Participants in the intervention group received three physical activity consultations with a walking advisor at baseline, 6 & 12-weeks. They were encouraged to use a pedometer to set goals and monitor their daily step count. Primary outcome was change in daily step count at 12-weeks. Process evaluation measures included qualitative interviews with key stakeholders (n = 6) and quantifiable data collected as part of the intervention. Additional process data were extracted from a sub-set of qualitative interviews with participants and carers (n = 20). Data were analysed for process information related to context, recruitment and retention, reach, implementation, and fidelity.ResultsWalk Well was not effective in significantly increasing levels of physical activity. The process evaluation did, however, highlight several important areas for consideration in future studies, including: a successful recruitment and retention strategy reaching a representative sample of adults with intellectual disabilities in the community; feasible and (for most) enjoyable methods of engaging adults with intellectual disabilities in activities to support behaviour change; potential need for greater intervention duration and frequency of contact; advantages and disadvantages of using pedometers as a behaviour change tool; the need for strategies which engage carers in supporting participants; and the complex issue of ‘freedom of choice’ in relation to lifestyle behaviours and study participation.ConclusionsWalking interventions for adults with intellectual disabilities can be feasibly delivered in the community in relation to reach, recruitment, retention and intervention fidelity. More intensive intervention methods need to be explored as well as strategies to engage and motivate carers in their support of participants.Trial registrationCurrent Controlled Trials ISRCTN50494254 (3rd April 2012).","inCitations":["b74fd09b1819c2e4b966a97f995417b779c4fb7b","ed3a7798b8b16d8b51eb13a71aeff4a4b2ff5c2e","88ce83a20800c821f5bedf963de5c2d38e062457","4aa2cb61d4c49cad2f9eac76173518fdee05794c","bbf53d977820994153d7afe7e5b23971e2d5c19a","a59a8a7776d16c89b0018e11861e3e2ed22b630f","97a3a40b21ae5ac000801ee2e95c911bac55df05","49f4d87f54c3febb7692eabd6875914c36b4d4d6","d85fe5c2fc07146de262fa068cbfc153c7c6da19","91c374ae4d47611df94712508f72f8e95fec147f"],"pdfUrls":["https://www.research.ed.ac.uk/portal/files/26644255/Process_evaluation_of_the_Walk_Well_study.pdf","https://pure.strath.ac.uk/ws/portalfiles/portal/53431014/Matthews_etal_2016_process_evaluation_of_the_Walk_Well_study.pdf","https://strathprints.strath.ac.uk/56892/1/Matthews_etal_2016_process_evaluation_of_the_Walk_Well_study.pdf","http://eprints.gla.ac.uk/108955/1/108955.pdf"],"title":"Process evaluation of the Walk Well study: a cluster-randomised controlled trial of a community based walking programme for adults with intellectual disabilities","doi":"10.1186/s12889-016-3179-6","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-016-3179-6","venue":"BMC Public Health"}

Obvious examples include mountain goats (Oreamnos americanus) and peregrine falcons (Falco peregrinus) that generally occupy precipitous terrain for at least part of the year. In contrast, pronghorn (Antilocapra americana) and greater prairie-chicken (Tympanuchus cupido) occupy level to gently rolling terrain. Kramer (1972) suggested that terrain ruggedness may be 1 means by which mule (Odocoileus hemionus) and white-tailed deer (0. virginianus) partition habitats in areas where the 2 species are sympatric. There may be a threshold of ruggedness beyond which the habitat becomes increasingly less suitable for a particular taxon. Therefore, quantification of ruggedness may be important when evaluating habitat quality or use. Previously (Russo 1965, Wood et al. 1970, Snow 1972), where ruggedness has been implicated as a key component of an animal's habitat, investigators have qualified it as \"precipitous,\" \"mountainous,\" or \"rugged.\" Although descriptive, such assessments preclude statistical treatments of data because the amount of ruggedness among locations is not quantified. Koerth (1981) attempted to quantify habitat ruggedness for mule deer by measuring average degree of slope occupied by individual animals. This approach provides an assessment only at individual sites, however, and does not describe the overall terrain of an area. Geomorphologists have attempted to index the ruggedness of drainage basins by (1) calculating total relief (maximum minus minimum elevation) (Schumm 1956); (2) calculating a dimensionless \"ruggedness number\" (HD) that is the product of total relief (H) and drainage density (D), or total length of all streams per unit of area (Melton 1957); or (3) conducting a hypsometric analysis that shows the relationship between horizontal cross-sectional drainage basin area and elevation (Strahler 1952). However, these methods similarly fail to quantify the myriad of slopes, draws, peaks, aspects, and elevation changes that collectively comprise \"rugged terrain.\" There appears to be no method presently available that provides an objective quantification of this complex habitat characteristic. The objective of this investigation was to develop a method to quantify topographic ruggedness as a feature of an animal's habitat.","inCitations":["87bad95724141ffa1bc3edc3e602cb72486d4b5b","313d1447d80e65a7838bf9a078f160314c3ad5a3","150ee5d99877d8d4bf0e9514492b21eb0b7d6b4b","a5a9dc4450b8603e306e395070d2b92f33131a1f","f7f8632e78e6a75e532d5809891740a215fcfc92","219fbb56d32aa4f1f8f28144f852b3d09f2506da","53b2fdddf2b0cf5925fbde92d14cb958ddb864c0","3249568784b16898cf20e9d6373e12ab35c8701d","5864e79b11b24ea7cfce00b1718a3e5d398ab478","338ad97d13553d156e3612bdbcf0e0063353d98a","c3c3fb969d649d22a08e957f40b3f4f74195a4c7","dffcb2a2cbc3531b14696e9d8c1d389c22f17ddc","5584d7d891d0c3e13d6de7119bae0310eea76bc4","eb359c3ba5c3fcc01dd80bda41c0e9c46d2da20d","879fa22aa498e1cb2d9d3ce35d02b6a4d9d32cbb","6f4559efc6a027105403f89e979d2278b63f9901","60d7cca90b359d1eb2f71f19231b658d5a82ac5e","06a9451eae944bcd2c4f787cc11dd7367d2f4bd9","36bfb74688f7ecb6bfffd43e9605c80d3a6367de","00d17de2d17b0ec708d73964c94fe732633c1272","e09afd233f61c5b24439087afe1912856072c12e","8dd143f98e071e6dfac5a2f9d69ce9cd05d69ab2","fce8ced572b7fe85597d07c8424a105f6f2b021e","3ad2952772a852c84af4ba8f755f2d295a1ffafb","b5840763d7bbab1a43e1bfd15c625925f0404788","1224e36c0367afa3832efdeb1f2f2fe597143f11","ed0a600ce43f1223a48ee1c7ecdbd0569a70e8bd"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"A Technique for Assessing Land Surface Ruggedness","doi":"10.2307/3808184","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.2307/3808184","venue":""}

It also deals with definitions of these skills, the sub skills or components of each skill, and ways pertaining to the learning and teaching of the skills. One of the key principles of communicative pedagogy is to teach skills in an integrated manner. Assumptions of teaching and learning inherent in ELT class room are introduced so that a mind set or focus, necessary for the study of the principles of methodology is encouraged. It makes us know about basic issues in the field of English language teaching to improve teaching practices, rather than an orientation to the discussion of academic issues for the academic purposes. The paper introduces us to the activity of theorizing about the classroom. This means the principles of language teaching are arrived through analysis will be made by the learner through his own teaching practice but much of the analysis will be made on the basis of conclusions arrived by the theorists in the field. This is nothing but involving the behaviors of the participants of the teaching-learning process in the curriculum.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://www.iosrjournals.org/iosr-jhss/papers/Vol19-issue9/Version-8/B019981012.pdf"],"title":"Aspects of English Language Teaching","doi":"10.9790/0837-19981012","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.9790/0837-19981012","venue":""}

Understanding the sequence of steps that is involved in establishing synapses during development might also help to understand mechanisms that cause changes in synapses during learning and memory. For practical reasons, most of our current knowledge of synapse development is derived from studies of the vertebrate neuromuscular junction (NMJ). Several lines of evidence strongly suggest that motor axons release the molecule agrin to induce the formation of the postsynaptic apparatus in muscle fibers. Recent advances implicate proteins such as dystroglycan, MuSK, and rapsyn in the transduction of agrin signals. Recently, additional functions of agrin have been discovered, including the upregulation of gene transcription in myonuclei and the control of presynaptic differentiation. Agrin therefore appears to play a unique role in controlling synaptic differentiation on both sides of the NMJ.","inCitations":["47e8d5ce485833eee30f7146ea0c9b8dde714020","06fed02944894ac9939f19bf34640a2dbc64a79b","87344079c7f194ccef869c66a329edef9eb60ec6","499c0e2be6377a0f90cf146c238c486d6c38582f","83b9e1ff130a6dc055f50d9050cd9d2fbd98f3b0","d2769cf906e88d59e03441e1ce25a85ba7a5d030","8fcfa6fdd8337f535fb5bb0bb444613c640533e7","fb35316ac9768f99bcfee051cbb416da98ec45f3","de83eedd890befd1426cdba6f2860fdd77913a8d","c8b3a9005f5aa9565827b4866b73fb47270305dc","1c08d3f2b92a51a886652af5700cc8b60799a440","01aeb180047e34af6692d162d90d1fd698973b93","bee7f6be1aeaaf34bcdb3ef037966aee60a89a5f","ef1445e169daa7ed839817d98497d32eb6fde684","31950d3ecc404508832d589b10976e13bf6368d7","9ff81d86c9d8864b4523d481cc3acc2f33415431","3e1b2931365b24fd3afaeb61309230995f2020b9","8b6021bbd9d5ff1181a4874bc916382be713542f","51ac66171e291f4635e35cd4a95aea2c61468329","b4f29a887cee56360d095522bcfc8c8b2203c280","628a6e72b80fa7e13f03eb7d1ed9aed80c9bf928","e02840844369c0ffbeec4f343f1b5370f543abc8","8232021c9fa693baec190f4fc7f4d294e1877ebd","c2831393b99725d1385da3939cf3e6b3311e26ec","1156595b482479380e559f6dd252500f2882142b","28e91887e4cd81e59c426cebdcc27cb97bccb243","7f17e47128c28afae5f8e4a38f029fdb615eaa15","3d9474d52be196a855e94016a8d3bb4bf7d10d7b","96926271ccc4857e4027742585b913cb5cd48c1b","60cdbb735413816915c5d4cad144b08307ff5533","c5c8ab7a8baf0dbeff7238e19a0e02b2b7399f4b","7282a875368d2048454c2c49608569a5a911ee96","5022a470c7051d97a64ed82e2c0ceccc54917ed2","18610e3d7606470afda968613c1d7472fa3e7b52","3fbeb4af69eba462ecdf6b21299081fac1a04796","9234dc44c786434fa8be3f6ab651b4bf7c59d842","4e66d4b539052d9c17426e7838c53e1b2f9ce32e","fdf3daa6186378912797aeb045d0265f3b38e75e","8a2d953755aa7f9d457717a0ae4edc7cedc5bab2","9b37d9aca0169e3d88d88de242572e57bb097d30","e279de7330bdc345b2ee5b47c260be753d86c9e4","a1131e43a1efbcdee7adcf6fe63a8792f82f4806","97fd90c37e780a9f88f74e763eb71b2949c05509","25676ae0ec67e7e689361ae06e9fdca1ee2230d9","40115cb6f795917e983c11d5485a4e71bd34fd34","7dc7dd2b42b2095d6b10fb777df041555ec73c0e","b5391ccc5aaddd3c028932077b731b8854253c9a","1b9521c94818b57f520372c998ad3db936c5170a","a7fbf6bd910d77523074d360848e28fe5e0cd71f","cfcdbf6942724b7e25ab5ac3cd6e1ff4c3a24fbc","29a1691de349665d53e75b9fd87c75f2e039223d","57802977a7232efd64d0fb8b745f23d53d08381d","08ea775180f5cf32c8797f458e4dd66569658b95","429d2a760c97738a106528ba3a48439c57c5bc44","a343c070b6143877e2fb03e84405f3a06112ad0a","dfd40241cc436521490ae80d842d75e0c24ba4fe","b811f8c88798a1334937ecdf705aefe76c0d5e01","937612bbfbefcde9e3cf9a395345779a87b3cb47","44eeb32537222b27d9ff4757e7fc8cc186fe5c3b","837f6bbd809e5f771da6ecf962958ceea8a73c18","696faf8016f2db83602d5ede04b4e330f563ce47","d2a69b820c2a4194110057df342c7a1bcc86affa","0992817577498861480244e03ce01de0ce292750","38aa9bd59c80f380432af98bd05ded33beb7e15f","0d0778d5b4c2456e92ea44cf45aa84c92cc034a3","678c84284415d3719abe42a5c4951060dd8a9c32","3e7230d48b7d0fb1edc91d49386a179b2f9fdfb0","427b5e070e88b79285300ad6a158fed3fe372fa8","59c6b8c9400846634a4ecd7e802f83a07f62765a","72f44e10bff4311cf6fdca22ab3865b3731ae740","a6b4d6758cfcb989b4e614802bebc77c17a74a71","d175f268dbd0601474c94e6348bae612d4593780","b99cae50b9c04ba28fed5c820ec3bbfea780713d","7bf371455e73c026cef9c1cba0369913960f0e38","87eaed10a97d6bde05db91ee1a17afe65813523d","750cb24ca7b08f333113c54a7a51cbfd6d927f61","acbff8c98e3b7f1bedfce852a0b819f1e04d470e","2ce6da47e7430c2c089b18f483715a95c8081890","b10f4dc8d933eddf5b4d4663f2f5679aaf5ac227","ed39094a6782ce9c9a06e6858a998bc6e4394aaf","391fb70d7b95ed0b4219690ef628c455e383b295","ade1b8582582b7c68cab205cbb68eb5eee337b2f","a3eafb7d465b90cda8903462ebea7b842935449a","68457b3b61739ca230a4c34b2bc1a514f3d6d688"],"pdfUrls":["https://www.neurobiologie.uni-osnabrueck.de/Teaching/Files/Lecture-Functional_Neuroanatomy/Literature_and_supplementary_material/03-muscle/Ruegg-Bixby,1998.pdf","https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166223697011545","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166223697011545?dgcid=api_sd_search-api-endpoint"],"title":"Agrin orchestrates synaptic differentiation at the vertebrate neuromuscular junction","doi":"10.1016/S0166-2236(97)01154-5","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/S0166-2236%2897%2901154-5","venue":"Trends in Neurosciences"}

However, this advantage comes at a price, and females are also more likely to develop auto-inflammatory disorders, the extreme example being systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), which is 10 times more frequent in females. While there is direct evidence of a role for the additional female X chromosome in these genderspecific responses (as seen with XXY males, who have the same frequency of SLE occurrence as females), a detailed understanding of how the additional female X chromosome controls immunity remains elusive. In a recent essay, Pinheiro et al. introduced the concept that in addition to X-chromosomeencoded immune genes, microRNAs (miRNAs) could also be at play in the control of sex-based differences in immunity [1]. This hypothesis, which relies on the observation that 10% of all miRNAs are present on the X chromosome, implies that some miRNAs present on the X chromosome exacerbate immune responses. Relying on the inducible depletion of all miRNAs in mouse macrophages, we have recently made the observation that the overall effect of miRNAs is to positively control inflammation in response to various pathogen-associated molecules [2]. Although counterintuitive, given the repressive action of miRNAs on protein translation, we hypothesised that a subset of miRNAs potentiates inflammatory responses through the control of repressors of NF-kB signalling, one of the critical promoters of inflammation. We identified a set of known repressors of NF-kB signalling that were predicted to be co-regulated by miRNAs from the miR-17 92 cluster, which comprises miR-19b and miR-18a, among others. Our experiments demonstrated that miR-19 has the strongest effect on the modulation of NF-kB signalling, through its coordinate control of several genes, including A20/Tnfaip3 [2]. In addition, increased intracellular levels of miR-19 exacerbate the production of pro-inflammatory interleukins 8 and 6 by primary fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), indicating an important role for miR19 in RA. Such a link between the miR-17 92 cluster of miRNAs and RA was recently independently confirmed by Trenkmann et al., who demonstrated that the miR-17 92 cluster of miRNAs is induced by the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-a in RA FLS [3]. These authors confirmed our observation that miR-18, similarly to miR-19, controls the expression of A20/Tnfaip3 [2], and demonstrated that miR-18 contributes to a positive feedback loop, exacerbating NF-kB-driven inflammation in RA FLS [3]. Of note, RA is two to three times more prevalent in females than males. miR-18 and miR-19 are encoded on chromosome 13 within the miR-17 92 cluster. In addition, they both have paralogs encoded within the miR-106a 363 cluster of miRNAs on chromosome X. While the role of the additional copies of miR-19 and miR-18 on chromosome X remains poorly defined, it is nonetheless apparent from mice lacking miR106a 363 that these copies are not essential to development [4]. However, these copies directly contribute to the overall miR-18 and miR-19 intracellular concentration, as evidenced experimentally: X-chromosome-encoded miR-19b represents at least 5% of all miR-19b molecules present in cancerous B cells [5]. Further studies are clearly required to assess the contribution of X-chromosome-encoded miR-19 and miR-18 to the function of these miRNAs in the modulation of inflammation. Nevertheless, our findings and those of Trenkmann et al. suggest that the hypothesis of Pinheiro et al. does have credible support, and that these two miRNAs potentially play a role in sex-based differences in immunity.","inCitations":["720de7faf720ad6879c27be1fd30d254c6d6d520","9b9cdb02320f2adec77019d11663f44c8925b8b1","2d1730de878efa26b35b344df7a8c3f04c77c987"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"X-chromosome-encoded microRNA-19 and -18 are possible modulators of female immunity.","doi":"10.1002/bies.201300047","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1002/bies.201300047","venue":"BioEssays : news and reviews in molecular, cellular and developmental biology"}

Combined with geological and mineralogical methods, the characteristies of occurrence of gold in the large scale sulfide mineralization in this region were fully investigated. The results show that gold distributes in both chalcopyrite and pyrite as submicroscopic inclusions (less than 1 µm). Au is positively correlated with As, Fe, S, Cu, Zn and Ti. The condition of gold transformation in thermal fluid system controlling deposition of Au in the region is probably the oxidation potential of the red sedimentary rocks of shale and fine grain sandstone which may be crucial as a geochemical barrier to the reducing fluid.

Most malicious botnets have the ability to be rented out to a broad range of potential customers, with each customer having an attack agenda different from the other. The result is a botnet that is under the control of multiple botmasters, each of which implement their own attacks and transactions at different times in the botnet. In order to fight botnets, details about their structure, users, and their users motives need to be discovered. Since current botnets require the information about the initial bootstrapping of a bot to a botnet, the monitoring of botnets are possible. Botnet monitoring is used to discover the details of a botnet, but current botnet monitoring projects mainly identify the magnitude of the botnet problem and tend to overt some fundamental problems, such as the diversified sources of the attacks. To understand the use of botnets in more detail, the botmasters that command the botnets need to be studied. In this thesis we focus on identifying the threat of botnets based on each individual botmaster. We present a multi-layered analysis framework which identifies the transactions of each botmaster and then we correlate the transactions with the physical evolution of the botnet. With these characteristics we discover what role each botmaster plays in the overall botnet operation. We demonstrate our results in our system: MasterBlaster, which discovers the level of interaction between each botmaster and the botnet. Our system has been evaluated in real network traces. Our results show that investigating the roles of each botmaster in a botnet should be essential and demonstrates its potential benefit for identifying and conducting additional research on analyzing botmaster interactions. We believe our work will pave the way for more fine-grained analysis of botnets which will lead to better protection capabilities and more rapid attribution of cyber crimes committed using botnets.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Development of a multi-layered botmaster based analysis framework","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

The EPS system has a state space order by 6x6 with one of the motor outputs to be controlled by a Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller and uses the MATLAB application as a simulation of the EPS system. The simulation is carried out in two stages, namely the simulation of an EPS system without controlling and simulating an EPS system using a PID controller. The results show , that the position controller on EPS with the PID control method reaches the desired position with the parameter value Kp = 500, Ki = 500 and Kd = 200 while the input step is 1.
