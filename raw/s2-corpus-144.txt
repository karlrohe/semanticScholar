Acute exposure to catnip increased stereotyped behavior and susceptibility to seizures, did not interfere with haloperidol-induced catalepsy, and decreased sleeping time after sodium pentobarbital administration. Long-term exposure induced tolerance to stereotypic behavior, catalepsy and sleeping time, and increased the susceptibility to seizures induced by picrotoxin and strychnine.

The present study aimed to determine whether liver transplantation (LT) may prevent/cure DM in patients with cirrhosis and whether the degree of glucose tolerance prior to transplantation is associated with the onset of DM after transplantation. Seventy-three patients who received a living donor LT at Nagasaki University Hospital (Nagasaki, Japan) between November 2005 and December 2012 were recruited. Among them, patients were considered diabetic if they had been prescribed diabetes medications or had impaired glucose tolerance, as evidenced by an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). Patients were followed up until December 31, 2013 to evaluate glucose tolerance. Patients who had developed DM 2 years after transplantation were found to be older and the incidence of diabetes prior to transplantation (n=73) was higher than in those who did not. Multivariate analysis revealed that DM requiring treatment prior to transplantation was the only independent factor for DM developed at 2 years after transplantation. OGTT results showed that in patients with poor insulin sensitivity indices prior to transplantation (n=45), improvements were seen at 2 years after transplantation, while β-cell function and insulinogenic index had decreased, which may have been the cause of DM after transplantation. In conclusion, the pre-operative β-cell function determined by an OGTT may be a useful predictive tool for the recurrence of DM after LT.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://www.spandidos-publications.com/10.3892/br.2016.788/download"],"title":"β-cell function prior to liver transplantation contributes to post-operative diabetes.","doi":"10.3892/br.2016.788","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.3892/br.2016.788","venue":"Biomedical reports"}

It is shown that oligonucleotides with uninterrupted runs of guanine residues at the 3'-end, e.g., d(T15G12), form multistranded structures stabilized by guanine-guanine interactions. The chemical and physical properties of these complexes differ from those of the complexes formed by oligonucleotides with telomere-like sequences, e.g., d(T15G4T2G4). In methylation protection and methylation interference experiments, we found all the guanines in complexes formed by d(T15G15) and d(T15G12) to be accessible to methylation. Furthermore, the methylated monomers retain the ability to polymerize. This contrasts with the inaccessibility of the guanines in d(T15G4T2G4) to methylation and the inability of the methylated monomer to form supramolecular structures. The stoichiometry of the complexes arising from the two types of oligonucleotides also differs. The complexes formed by d(T15G15) consist of consecutive integer numbers of DNA strands, whereas complexes formed by telomere-like oligonucleotides contain 1, 2, 4, or multiples of four strands. Magnesium ions favor formation of high molecular weight complexes by d(T15G15) and d(T15G12), but not by d(T15G4T2G4). The d(T15G15) and d(T15G12) complexes have very high thermal stability compared with telomeric complexes. However, at low temperatures, the thymine bases within the telomeric motif, TTGGGGTTGGGG, appear to allow for the formation of stable high-molecular weight species with a longer nonguanine portion.","inCitations":["c299a30e3e7f0191ee94b53ec13a98a5b77b0173","680b3830bdc8948e683acecfa1308d73dad7f864","4d9808a876ddc67f52cdba881f8d7c4ce2be15f0","4e6dbadcffca97062fa80024e9a07ee751b6521e","9ed5a123061c4be24fb5c7db7e9c161afaaab741","d2a76884ddeaa732c113da574a6007d874be07f6","7e91eeda1769e53a9a16d1499100f4ed6eed8fe3","236d06285574db0dcc3a5dab1f0500ebf9debb0d","a54020be5bf4a8e8aced9f2a0dbea04ecdc787c6"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Unusual behavior exhibited by multistranded guanine-rich DNA complexes.","doi":"10.1002/(SICI)1097-0282(199805)45:6<427::AID-BIP2>3.0.CO;2-R","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1002/%28SICI%291097-0282%28199805%2945%3A6%3C427%3A%3AAID-BIP2%3E3.0.CO%3B2-R","venue":"Biopolymers"}

Here we describe a methylated CpG tandems amplification and sequencing (MCTA-Seq) method that can detect thousands of hypermethylated CpG islands simultaneously in ccfDNA. This highly sensitive technique can work with genomic DNA as little as 7.5 pg, which is equivalent to 2.5 copies of the haploid genome. We have analyzed a cohort of tissue and plasma samples (n = 151) of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients and control subjects, identifying dozens of high-performance markers in blood for detecting small HCC (≤ 3 cm). Among these markers, 4 (RGS10, ST8SIA6, RUNX2 and VIM) are mostly specific for cancer detection, while the other 15, classified as a novel set, are already hypermethylated in the normal liver tissues. Two corresponding classifiers have been established, combination of which achieves a sensitivity of 94% with a specificity of 89% for the plasma samples from HCC patients (n = 36) and control subjects including cirrhosis patients (n = 17) and normal individuals (n = 38). Notably, all 15 alpha-fetoprotein-negative HCC patients were successfully identified. Comparison between matched plasma and tissue samples indicates that both the cancer and noncancerous tissues contribute to elevation of the methylation markers in plasma. MCTA-Seq will facilitate the development of ccfDNA methylation biomarkers and contribute to the improvement of cancer detection in a clinical setting.","inCitations":["1b0f7bede858b96e44e57945feae5122ca8213f8"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Genome-scale detection of hypermethylated CpG islands in circulating cell-free DNA of hepatocellular carcinoma patients","doi":"10.1038/cr.2015.126","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1038/cr.2015.126","venue":"Cell Research"}

Then it is proved that local decision and local fusion rules should also be N-P tests in order to obtain global optimization. The computational method of the thresholds is presented for the case where the constant alarm false rate processors are used in each sensor. Finally some calculation examples are given, which demonstrate that the performance of the optimal distributed detection approaches to the one of central detection under unconstrained communication bandwidth. The results given in this paper are of important significance for the point or small area multisensor defense system.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"The analysis and design of distributed detection based on star configurations","doi":"10.1109/NAECON.1998.710175","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NAECON.1998.710175","venue":"Proceedings of the IEEE 1998 National Aerospace and Electronics Conference.

Ainsi, plusieurs etudes ont ete menees au cours des annees 70 et 80 pour introduire la technologie micro-onde (MO) et reduire la pollution, mais peu d’entre elles ont abouti a un developpement industriel. Depuis une dizaine d’annees maintenant on constate un regain d’interet pour la technologie MO. Le but de ces travaux est d’etudier dans un premier temps la faisabilite de l’utilisation d’un procede mixte chauffage conventionnel / MO pour l’ennoblissement et de mettre au point un pilote de laboratoire. Le dispositif a ete concu et optimise en s’appuyant sur l’ennoblissement a differentes etapes de differentes matieres textiles. Dans un second temps, nous avons essaye de comprendre plus precisement les effets des MO sur la teinture du polyester. L’utilisation des MO pour les traitements d’ennoblissement permet de diminuer les temps et les temperatures de traitement ainsi que de limiter fortement l’ajout de PAT. Avec les micro-ondes, les cinetiques de teinture et de diffusion du colorant dans la fibre sont accelerees. Les essais montrent que les MO agissent particulierement sur l’eau et les colorants, la fibre polyester etant peu polaire. Des hypotheses sont formulees pour expliquer les effets. Ainsi les MO compenseraient rapidement le refroidissement provoque par l’evaporation de l’eau et la sublimation des colorants, permettant d’augmenter ainsi les vitesses de teintures. On constate une diminution de l’energie d’activation de la diffusion du colorant dans la fibre : Des effets specifiques des micro-ondes seraient egalement mis en jeu.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Utilisation des micro-ondes dans l'ennoblissement textile","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

In the paper, a scheme is designed to enhance the signal by a “time-shift & accumulation” operation. Meanwhile, clutters from different sources are non-uniformly time-shifted. As a consequence, the Signal-to-Clutter Ratio (SCR) is increased. The distribution of the accumulation of clutter and noise from different sources would approach Gaussian according to the Central Limit Theorem (CLT). Then the problem of target detection in an unknown environment becomes target detection under Gaussian clutter and noise. Since the targets concerned are symmetric objects, the signals from the symmetrically placed receiver pairs are examined. In addition, results from measurement in a realistic indoor environment are provided.","inCitations":["682d5f5e1fd3879479d1368ed15cdbbb473426ff","5175645e0fc415c377ad539adb79118e0f586850"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Stationary symmetric object detection in unknown indoor environments","doi":"10.1109/LAPC.2011.6114106","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LAPC.2011.6114106","venue":"2011 Loughborough Antennas & Propagation Conference"}

Because coordination is persistent, the model can generate large, long-lasting unemployment crises. When unemployment is high, aggregate demand is low and firms are more likely to coordinate on low job creation. As a result, unemployment persists and job creation remains durably low.

It is due the fact that this environment has characteristics that defy most of the techniques available, such as texture less objects that in some case are too large and in others are very small. This work proposes the combination of established techniques for 3D reconstruction and tracking, as well as a calibration routine, that is suitable for this type of scenario. This complete tracking system was evaluated in the ISMAR Tracking Competition, a contest that simulates industrial scenarios and is promoted to test state of the art trackers. The system presented good results in the competition and a discussion regarding its performance is lodged, aiming to introduce an analysis that could help others during the development of their own tracking system for industrial scenario.","inCitations":["399ed64bd0b12165b7c92ebf2102db7d0e16e284","4185284f2ae86f16da64f08b66dbb69ec3d29d83"],"pdfUrls":["http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/SVR.2013.15","https://www.computer.org/csdl/proceedings/svr/2013/5001/00/06655767.pdf"],"title":"3D Tracking in Industrial Scenarios: A Case Study at the ISMAR Tracking Competition","doi":"10.1109/SVR.2013.15","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SVR.2013.15","venue":"2013 XV Symposium on Virtual and Augmented Reality"}

Traditional 3-D reconstruction algorithms are challenged. Owing to its powerful capacity in solving nonlinearity problems, the sphere-shaped support vector machines (SSSVMs) is applied in the 3-D reconstruction. Selecting parameters for SSSVM and the kernel function, however, is a complicated issue. Appropriate parameters can make the model more flexible and help to obtain more accurate data description. In this study, immune algorithm (IA) is used in searching for the optimal parameters. Immune SSSVM (ISSSVM) is proposed to reconstruct the 3-D encephalic tissues in MR images. As shown by the experiment of this study, each encephalic tissue can be reconstructed efficiently, and satisfied accuracy and visual effect can be obtained.","inCitations":["e00113410761a929cd6d07de9cf164aaa94ec5eb","94f180a61aff788b0382bed7e4b09920e830b181","4e295c684ccaf90c7858cfdc5e6789cd09ac101e","d391997aa50d39dae02ed9164555a469c9fe5d2e"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"3-D Reconstruction of Encephalic Tissue in MR Images Using Immune Sphere-Shaped SVMs","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics"}

Experiments were designed to conform closely to the requirements of the theoretical analysis. Residual resistance measurements, loading rate effects, and effect of matrix property variations were examined in detail. Quasi-static experimental methods and related analysis were developed to determine the complete set of electro-mechanical constants for the foils of interest. The phenomenological model developed earlier was extended to include strain-hardening in a consistent manner. The model predictions, using the appropriate material constants, agreed very well with the shock wave measurements. Using the analytic model a good understanding of ytterbium stress transducers was achieved.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Determining and Modeling the Response of Ytterbium Piezoresistance Transducers.","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Por lo tanto, en esta investigación se realizaron ensayos de retracción libre, ensayo de retracción restringida y adicionalmente ensayos para caracterización en estado fresco y en estado endurecido. Los HAR se prepararon con una relación agua/ligante (a/l) 0.25; y las adiciones de fibra ocurrieron en contenidos de 0,20%; 0,25% y 0,30% del volumen de hormigón. Como resultados se obtuvo la disminución de la deformación hasta un 50% en comparación con la muestra de referencia en el ensayo de retracción autógena libre. Cuando se restringía, se pudo observar que, al añadir fibra, el hormigón tenía menos deformación causada por la retracción, pero no hubo diferencias significativas entre las mezclas en cuanto al tiempo requerido para la fisuración. En cuanto a las propiedades mecánicas, los valores de resistencia a la compresión y módulo de elasticidad de las mezclas con microfibras disminuyeron hasta 7 días. Fue visto que, un alto contenido de fibra daba lugar a un aumento en el contenido de aire incorporado en la mezcla, lo que resulta en una disminución de las propiedades mecánicas de los hormigones de alto rendimiento reforzado con fibras (HARRF). Para las mezclas estudiadas, se concluyó que la incorporación de fibra ayudó a la reducción de la deformación debida a la retracción.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://riunet.upv.es/bitstream/handle/10251/101213/6300-20369-1-PB.pdf?isAllowed=y&sequence=1"],"title":"Uso de microfibras de vidrio para el control de la retracción autógena en compuesto cementicio","doi":"10.4995/hac2018.2018.6300","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.4995/hac2018.2018.6300","venue":""}

Disease simulation can be motivated, among other things, by illegal purposes, to escape from civil duties or prison sentences, for example, or to exploit specific situations in order to receive a range of benefits. In such cases, the simulator is fully aware of his or her actions and intentions. Diagnoses, Interventions and Outcomes: We report the case of a 42-year-old woman who, for 3 consecutive years, showed religious stigmata on the forehead and on the dorsal surface of hands and feet immediately before Easter. Lesions showed an acute onset, manifested as erosions and ulcerations, and healed a few days after Easter. Stigmata were immediately made public and every year faithful and curious people went in procession to the house of the patient, offering different kinds of gifts. After intervention of the police authority in the early days of the third episode, the patient and her family repented of their actions.

The effects were assessed from germination and seedlings growth rates. The bacterial indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) production and ACC deaminase activity were also determined. Both strains are able to produce the IAA and showed ACC deaminase activity in various amounts. The strains accelerated seeds germination, seedling emergence and development. The beneficial effect on those processes was visible when seeds were soaked for 1 h in bacterial suspension and, especially, when the bacteria were present during Micro-Cel E conditioning. The main effect observed upon inoculation of seeds during priming was increased growth of lateral roots and more complex architecture of the branching root system. Treating seeds with A. rhizogenes simultaneously with Micro-Cel E priming as a carrier is a promising method of enhancing grass germination and seedlings growth, particularly by improving the root system development.","inCitations":["0454f9658f6c167a0f8d51fb60cfb3731aa5d1d9","469280a10eb089283eed8eef1af8a8d60e0bcddf"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Enhancement of Festuca rubra L. germination and seedling growth by seed treatment with pathogenic Agrobacterium rhizogenes","doi":"10.1007/s11738-014-1692-8","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11738-014-1692-8","venue":"Acta Physiologiae Plantarum"}

Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) detects environmental information with sensors in remote settings. One problem facing WSNs is the inability to resupply power to these energy-constrained devices due to their remoteness. Therefore to extend a WSN's effectiveness, the lifetime of the network must be increased by making them as energy efficient as possible. An energy-efficient medium access control (MAC) can boost a WSN's lifetime. This paper focuses on a protocol stack solution that deals with MAC layer, that minimizes the energy consumption and delay required to transmit packets across the network. It is based on Sensor Medium Access Control (S-MAC) called Adaptive SMAC protocol designed for sensor networks. It enables low duty cycle operation in a multi-hop network and common sleep schedules to reduce control overhead and enable traffic adaptive wakeup. To reduce control overhead and latency, introduces coordinated sleeping among neighboring nodes. It is a contention based protocol based on CSMA/CAmechanism. This protocol is simulated in NS-2 and performance evaluated using various topologies under various traffic conditions. In addition with this we tried to improve the energy efficiency of Adaptive SMAC with the help of a new design calledAdaptive Cross MAC protocol","inCitations":["2c6aa5fdfa64e452ed6b5a5f40810ab41a5d3508","1d301d76103be01f6c1d8385541fc4c05d5ac240","c0b966642fa9fd2c7f868f6f9b0a17b15847583e","87ab39840355ca0392f213ab1d794890fc9aa873","0cfa7f2b500d0b29d2c58e7f262081f659254aa1","acd9a80a3a943fe0c89c8d1c2768e4fe29d93b78","fe40ef6d3860a5cc87f64a617e9955c2cb186413","d1dbacd3b1d09a4af77ddda1d222c03e85bbc50b","d5164373b6daa3cb1708616ad1fe61b7e586a2bd","978c6c655b92aa044e3b1a652c394d51ae97df1f","12b1d527b609f6dc73033e4b24b9c52065511d68","15d2b96e0a64c7b27d706555e5eb9d6f967ea9c3","ec8c9ed14d99f2a857d32cb60799666331a4f500","9216aeb844762f7ff548b31f1bc4ac61ee1f0cf2","f0c3a2d912c39352010684db9bd4427666382748","f693afd7d1ab155a37dfb0e31568ecbf978b9834","ec49f27960a68c435a8fe65ccb6dae2d81a6a743","b3ab534966f02618815b44a61f23cdd59a41b5f5","b3af8f30a2fc19ff85b7caa67589fc63b732d015","b235634bddcb381aed5303070a468003c41296a7","c621aa1112a44f9cad0aeeb540c390857003c9c4","1113cdca659e8db9079e0e6ad422bbc930c2149d"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"An Adaptive Energy Efficient Mac Protocol for Wireless Sensor Networks","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Such a Tyr-protein kinase (36 kDa), as distinct from the Ser/Thre-protein kinases (casein kinase S and TS), appears to display a broader site specificity than does the previously described human erythrocyte P-Tyr-protein phosphatase, dephosphorylating band 3 protein. That is, it is able to phosphorylate not only the highly acidic copolymer poly(Glu-Tyr) but also angiotensin II, lacking an acidic amino acid sequence around the target Tyr residue. Moreover, the phosphorylation of these two substrates exhibits a different pH dependence and a different response to NaCl and 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate. These results suggest that in intact erythrocytes the cytosolic Tyr-protein kinase might phosphorylate band 3 not only on Tyr-8, surrounded by several acidic side-chains (as demonstrated preferentially to occur in isolated ghosts), but also on other Tyr residues surrounded by other amino acid sequences.","inCitations":["ce0a58558a011a98dbaaecb5a91a6cab9b3b5bf7","db3a8cfbe1c7232f5d587cea4c770c9d18adb521","19274c468a8b5fdbeb18d1e816f86156d387fce3","378964144371b34f16cb31a33db6d1d42516e0ee"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Partial purification and characterization of cytosolic Tyr-protein kinase(s) from human erythrocytes.","doi":"10.1111/j.1432-1033.1988.tb14243.x","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1432-1033.1988.tb14243.x","venue":"European journal of biochemistry"}

In this brief, we focus on the maximum likelihood detection (MLD) scheme that detects SM signals with low computational complexity. By reformulating the MLD problem, we obtain a new mathematical expression as the MLD solution. To avoid the numerically unstable division operation, we apply the Givens rotation to realize this new expression and obtain a low-complexity MLD algorithm. We also propose a coordinate rotation digital computer-based hardware architecture to detect SM signals with 64-quaternary amplitude modulated (QAM) symbols over the correlated channel with eight transmit antennas and four receive antennas. The VLSI implementation results under the TSMC 90-nm CMOS technology reveal that our division-free architecture requires 70.5K gates and provides detection throughput 432.68 Mb/s, while operating at frequency 384.6 MHz. Our design is the first hardware architecture to achieve the exact MLD performance and is easily modified to detect SM signals with arbitrary ${M}$ -ary QAM symbols and arbitrary numbers of transmit and receive antennas.","inCitations":["eade000d4c2c92774a2b6a913d18e2063fe9b0c3"],"pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSII.2019.2896350"],"title":"A Low-Complexity Maximum Likelihood Detector for the Spatially Modulated Signals: Algorithm and Hardware Implementation","doi":"10.1109/TCSII.2019.2896350","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSII.2019.2896350","venue":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs"}

The TMF cycle consists of two loadings each with a 100 h long hold-time. A simple crystallographic creep model, based on Norton’s creep law, has been developed and used in conjunction with a crystal plasticity model. The model takes anisotropy and tension/compression asymmetry into account, where the anisotropic behaviour is based on the crystallographic stress state. The values of the creep parameters in the anisotropic expression were determined by inverse modelling of the conducted TMF experiments, a parameter optimisation were performed. The developed model predicts the stress relaxation seen in the TMF experiments with good correlation.","inCitations":["65b08b53ed35a5f5cb9aaacdcaf82f09cd36fdef","75e68ebb5c412963ac3a8ce582e22202effd62b5","2c9e02fd3a8104ae5ddf31f4f128ee28eea8ffd5"],"pdfUrls":["http://liu.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:728485/FULLTEXT01.pdf"],"title":"Modelling of thermomechanical fatigue stress relaxation in a single-crystal nickel-base superalloy","doi":"10.1016/j.commatsci.2014.04.009","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.commatsci.2014.04.009","venue":""}

The experiment was designed as a full factorial (3 factors; N fertilisation rates, soil acidification, and plants), with three replicates. The more acidic irrigation (pH 3) significantly reduced nitrification potential and N2O fluxes, methane oxidation and CO2 release. We concluded that the reduction in soil N2O release by severe acid deposition is partly due to reduction in nitrification potential. The highest N2O fluxes were observed in the combination of fertilised planted and less acidic pH treatment. N fertilisation (90 kg N ha−1 y−1 with NH4NO3) increased soil N2O release by a factor of 8 and decreased CH4 oxidation by 60–80%.

Four sub-groups were described: 1) patients with a severe sepsis, 2) patients with an acute local or regional infection, 3) persistent or recurrent effusion without specific context, 4) patients who underwent a transplantation treated with cyclosporin A. Even when the clinico-pathological context did not suggest a classical extra-medullary haematopoiesis, it was not exceptional to identify immature haematopoietic cells. This hypothesis is supported by published data, which suggests that a local inflammatory state could help mesothelial cells to constitute a favourable environment for division and maturation of circulating haematopoietic progenitor cells.","inCitations":["a6ea084958af7c5842dbc9bab4e3a09818ad225a"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Intra-serous haematopoiesis.","doi":"","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"In vivo"}

Teicoplanin has double the activity of vancomycin against many Gram-positive bacteria, but allergic reactions and toxicity appear to be infrequent. A single daily dose is sufficient to maintain therapeutic levels, which is an advantage in conditions requiring long-term treatment. Of the 31 episodes treated, 16 were associated with infective endocarditis, 11 with Hickman catheter infection, two with bone and joint infection, and two with infection of other indwelling prosthetic devices. Staphylococcus epidermidis was isolated in 18 infections, of which seven treatment courses were unsuccessful. One death occurred from an uncontrolled infection, three deaths from underlying disease (one of which had relapsed twice), and one after withdrawal of treatment following febrile reaction. Eleven episodes were cured. Six episodes of Staphylococcus aureus septicaemia were treated, of which two failed to respond, two relapsed, one improved and one was cured. The remaining seven episodes were caused by streptococci (including Streptococcus faecalis), and in all of them cure was achieved despite the lack of consistent serum bactericidal activity in vitro.","inCitations":["316b42558d0e725aad2d2f21410e6e8d063abf82","9dce145c2056c7eb96b57bac25ce8a3979458879"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Use of a glycopeptide antibiotic, teicoplanin, in the treatment of septicaemia caused by gram-positive bacteria.","doi":"","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"International journal of clinical pharmacology research"}

Studies were carried out in Kilimanjaro Region, northern Tanzania to investigate the regional demand for dairy produce and the marketing system. Demand proved to be buoyant, with an average LME consumption of 142 kg/person/year and an income elasticity of demand of 0.9 in the urban areas, and 45 kg/person/year and 1.1 for the rural areas. The main products taken were fresh and sour milk. More than half the milk was consumed in the rural areas. Demand was forecast to grow from 1990 to 2000 at 5%/year. The marketing system consisted of competing multiple channels involving a parastatal, cooperatives and private traders. There was ample evidence that the system was efficient, with producers obtaining as much as 78% of the final milk price. The main policy concern was the adequate upkeep of rural feeder roads during the rains. Public intervention in marketing was not necessary for successful development of a regional dairy industry in this case.","inCitations":["ce609ac083a59ee62af473f529662e9a567e0883","a2bbdde7dd66f9bc3965f7c0ef45e21e2b2bde27","bb50be18639b074839584a58385d068095c26b5c","92a2c90007f8b18a5009c09ca4b4f1bb3f83e07a","1289cc3059562a3f5c40fb8456e25a34db1be9eb","83fbc76a7d390b231e605f9bc847f1ad5593f7ba","4ade0a7c7cd1953916f1a7e3cf0a20a0571e2d58","f0c66c92a0742706c7097712534ed59bdbc2a1e8","e3397b77232a0a388118e3dc35d26e324b4df300","8720bd8e725ff46dbfe1ba5e202645d73173e35e","ed4c29b10f75d1ae9975fe366dfc98965f056740","4606723deed6cc8517ef0b73da84537740c91ab2","93dbaca98b6e78774e14f64b1d5549c36852c31d","99ee102bf794d5ad52c6d11082d16941ad74b7f1","aaef833a37bb7c3656cd1c8a33d265e01755940f","02fd633781b64c6413ef213e431c7952534e5fc1","47eac105adeae56e0fe554e8e02afc9cd28cd718","903e44ca8602cc514f0655b00044c57e8b5e2f5f"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Dairy products demand and marketing in Kilimanjaro Region, Tanzania","doi":"10.1016/0306-9192(96)00003-6","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/0306-9192%2896%2900003-6","venue":""}

PCR-based methods have revolutionized this field due to the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity that are achievable in a rapid way. In this study, a compound molecular detection system, consisting of a duplex PCR assay, was developed for the specific identification of Burkholderia pseudomallei and differentiation from other Burkholderia species. For accurate identification of B. pseudomallei, we deciphered and adopted a novel gene termed putative fimbrial chaperone (fimC). d-beta hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase (bdha), reported previously by our group for sequence-based differentiation of B. pseudomallei from other Burkholderia species, was employed as a genus-specific target. Enforcement of an internal amplification control in the PCR format ruled out possible false negative results in the assay. Thus, the developed PCR assay was highly specific (100%) in its detection features, and a clear detection sensitivity of 10 pg/μl for purified gDNA and 3 × 103 CFU/ml for B. pseudomallei spiked urine was recorded. Successful identification of B. pseudomallei from an experimental mouse model at both the genus and species level revealed the accurate diagnostic efficiency of the duplex PCR method.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Evaluation of fimC and bdha based duplex PCR for specific identification and differentiation of Burkholderia pseudomallei from near-neighbor Burkholderia species.","doi":"10.1016/j.ijmm.2017.11.007","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijmm.2017.11.007","venue":"International journal of medical microbiology : IJMM"}

Robotics","paperAbstract":"The hallmark of modern robotics is the ability to directly fuse the platform’s perception with its motoric ability—the concept often referred to as “active perception.” Nevertheless, we find that action and perception are often kept in separated spaces, which is a consequence of traditional vision being frame based and only existing in the moment and motion being a continuous entity. This bridge is crossed by the dynamic vision sensor (DVS), a neuromorphic camera that can see the motion. We propose a method of encoding actions and perceptions together into a single space that is meaningful, semantically informed, and consistent by using hyperdimensional binary vectors (HBVs). We used DVS for visual perception and showed that the visual component can be bound with the system velocity to enable dynamic world perception, which creates an opportunity for real-time navigation and obstacle avoidance. Actions performed by an agent are directly bound to the perceptions experienced to form its own “memory.” Furthermore, because HBVs can encode entire histories of actions and perceptions—from atomic to arbitrary sequences—as constant-sized vectors, autoassociative memory was combined with deep learning paradigms for controls. We demonstrate these properties on a quadcopter drone ego-motion inference task and the MVSEC (multivehicle stereo event camera) dataset.","inCitations":["283349d89960e4888f7f4b4fad84e4a61775c303","073dbb811b072c5fe2b667e3224b5d592ca6ffbc","aa0e566f81b8d36b45ba6193579e5adb6300d435","20f06172011bbf9e99ddbb8247ea7bfcd1bff838","0e6f09f708a8c774a3057eac5002fdca44e53882","e37959e561641d25b05847e8a175a5c3416aa398"],"pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1126/scirobotics.aaw6736","http://users.umiacs.umd.edu/~fer/postscript/eaaw6736.full.pdf"],"title":"Learning sensorimotor control with neuromorphic sensors: Toward hyperdimensional active perception","doi":"10.1126/scirobotics.aaw6736","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1126/scirobotics.aaw6736","venue":"Sci.

The clusters geometry was set according to that observed for Mn$^{II}$(TCNE)$_{1/2}$(I$_3$)$_{1/2}$ and M$^{II}$(TCNE)(C$_4$(CN)$_8$)$_{1/2}$ (M = Fe, Mn) with the [TCNE]$^{-.}$. For the Mn$^{II}$(TCNE)$_{1/2}$(I$_3$)$_{1/2}$ two cluster types are considered: one with the geometry corresponding to [TCNE]$^{-.}$ in the two-dimensional layer, and another connecting the layers. For M$^{II}$(TCNE)(C$_4$(CN)$_8$)$_{1/2}$ only the layer position of the [TCNE]$^{-.}$ is considered. In all cases the LUMO (singly filled in the material) is predominantly concentrated on the ethylenic C-C bond and is antibonding. The J value for the Mn$^{II}$(TCNE)$_{1/2}$(I$_3$)$_{1/2}$ layer is at least as twice as strong as one for the similar geometry for M$^{II}$(TCNE)(C$_4$(CN)$_8$)$_{1/2}$. The correct order of magnitude of the calculated exchange parameters, as compared with those extracted from experimentsindicates the general validity of this approach. However, the direct comparison of these J values with the critical temperatures is not possible since these latter heavily depend on details of the interlayer coupling not available through the EHCF procedure. In order to get more information on the geometry dependence of the exchange parameters, the dependence on the tilt angle of the TCNE with respect to the plane formed by the metal ions and four equatorial NCMe groups was investigated. In all cases, a remarkably strong dependence, having different trends depending on the number of electrons in the d-shells of respective transition metal ions was observed.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://arxiv.org/pdf/1112.1362v1.pdf"],"title":"Exchange Parameters in the TCNE-based Magnets as Estimated with use of the Effective Hamiltonian Crystal Field Method","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

One such population, the neurons of the basilar pontine nuclei, expresses high levels of Nfi proteins, and the pontine nuclei are greatly reduced in mice lacking a functional Nfib gene. Pontine neurons, along with other precerebellar neurons that populate the hindbrain, arise from precursors in the lower rhombic lip and migrate anteroventrally to reach their final location. Using immunohistochemistry, we find that NFI-B expression is specific for mossy fiber populations of the precerebellar system. Analysis of the Nfib(-/-) hindbrain indicates that the development of the basilar pontine nuclei is delayed, with pontine neurons migrating 1-2 days later than in control animals, and that significantly fewer pontine neurons are produced. While the mossy fiber nuclei of the caudal medulla do form, they also exhibit a developmental delay. Nfia and Nfix null mice exhibit no apparent pontine phenotype, implying specificity in the action of NFI family members. Collectively, these data demonstrate that Nfib plays an important role in the generation of precerebellar mossy fiber neurons, and may do so at least in part by regulating neurogenesis.","inCitations":["46ce69d64ee6929c9da3aaad9303e5e27d173640","004f6b02c2eac281e1a53825b5b2bc8101440427","db7741edde37664246032ee19d4d95f1245873fd","ec63f2b83ca700715b314023bd4489abbdb29565","ec753778b9b5f62fd9c16077189e2015bb0ce8bc","1393177cb8adc7375b41290e8acd80cfd8fc757d","c41206e0d0d44efe749b5eab5af05a764b4f75ef","bc4c04a8e2ccd28b3ec5fe156732f8d96da26b83","84ad4f9a01b1ecda672684292ab5f02d7c7e0e1f","3f02ec059d604b818b25d2b63beb6ab422581fa1","3b814e6375c499bdd5bb1b001e448f25c8c45ea6","a35380bc974d054977857b63a23535bdbac3482b","d13986b38ebed3aeed6494603d1729206fd16a97"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.acsu.buffalo.edu/~rgron/Kumbasar09.pdf"],"title":"Absence of the transcription factor Nfib delays the formation of the basilar pontine and other mossy fiber nuclei.","doi":"10.1002/cne.21943","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1002/cne.21943","venue":"The Journal of comparative neurology"}

The practice of striving to publish in high-impact journals is based on the assumption that high-quality research papers are associated with high impact factor (IF) journals. However, this assumption is not always fulfilled. This is because the IF of a journal was originally developed by librarians to rank journals; it was not designed as a marker of the quality of the research papers published in the journal.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://journals.assaf.org.za/sajsm/article/download/512/389"],"title":"Evaluating the quality of science in exercise and sports medicine","doi":"10.7196/SAJSM.509","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.7196/SAJSM.509","venue":""}

It is widely recognized that malnutrition compromises the immune function, resulting in higher risk of infection. However, very few studies have investigated the relationship between malaria, malnutrition and specific immunity. In the present study, the anti-Plasmodium falciparum IgG antibody (Ab) response was evaluated in children according to the type of malnutrition.MethodsAnthropometric assessment and blood sample collection were carried out during a cross-sectional survey including rural Senegalese preschool children. This cross-sectional survey was conducted in July 2003 at the onset of the rainy season. Malnutrition was defined as stunting (height-for-age <-2 z-scores) or wasting (weight-for-height <-2 z-scores). The analysis was performed on all malnourished children in July (n = 161, either stunted, n = 142 or wasted, n = 19), pair-matched to well-nourished controls. The IgG Ab response to P. falciparum whole extracts (schizont antigens) was assessed by ELISA in sera of the included children.ResultsBoth the prevalence of anti-malarial immune responders and specific IgG Ab levels were significantly lower in malnourished children than in controls. Depending on the type of malnutrition, wasted children and stunted children presented a lower specific IgG Ab response than their respective controls, but this difference was significant only in stunted children (P = 0.026). This down-regulation of the specific Ab response seemed to be explained by severely stunted children (HAZ ≤ -2.5) compared to their controls (P = 0.03), while no significant difference was observed in mildly stunted children (-2.5 < HAZ <-2.0). The influence of child malnutrition on the specific anti-P. falciparum Ab response appeared to be independent of the intensity of infection.ConclusionChild malnutrition, and particularly stunting, may down-regulate the anti-P. falciparum Ab response, both in terms of prevalence of immune responders and specific IgG Ab levels. This study provides further evidence for the influence of malnutrition on the specific anti-malarial immune response and points to the importance of taking into account child malnutrition in malaria epidemiological studies and vaccine trials.","inCitations":["8ba642f1db442a103cc06109a17b245a9cb62e14","193c4ee2d243c4d5e79dcddc844474442d854401","d566799354802800915b422924f966efa8eca1b1","7f16008af9c4dea3ce712ac080099fd2cf122322","fe106b381f701510cefd042a56caf401cafdb32f","cdff84551c8df946916cbc02b4d300ab98331402","0a5c76e4c8aadb285d29fbb002d04fc288fcc055","8516501095841835b8084830d0347954743b8cfc","1a5ace5b3177b2be34484280453e96db5e8eee9a","9afc303ba1e38441f1344e4c06580a2290359e4f","13894f429afefb3979e7ad0dc833eb83780131cf","0b4444a2d7f4d7315b9ba101ab5f001ef7edb048","3028008743fbf92e37d70b013a9293d8b9687155","cce9f232a3148cc2cdbc5c03323230a56c7732ec","412d922a3ee78bf284d3055a38d262e76d4f6aae","a1d967ed4b22e77e22e71808d9114e8db11245e5","77cd5fab2265c2d4e140678740c3198e7d75cd9c","ea2521f1004d20b1b60c2899de38130637d19db3","21ce4f771ce80a411af37f8208a0c52f825f57a0","60b61ba8a5b88f9c102767ccc963076107f48229","4a189e95bf1dc2fa5a2e90cde77545da927a5fe2","df3ae5c0a7f6bac2b0778e56f8b703e846c2f07b","0cf6d0a15afdedabfdf2050e1ac3fdd661d00393","5f4e35f219eb5acd07f1bd5fc775d25943336085","f9bb56fb70bc8c0d5ef9b46fba16ea479e91f5dc","8c648740bd358460c35f3bf213e46fafd928cebf","fda91914daf443c584eba5ab6023309538546347","e564a2c76a9bd4d31ddffe83d58ca18117a532bb","a41c4f05d0a1298defb203388186d0653e1bd4ee","ba8da6de116fc751450bc150efb999a97b09dd1e","02fd7dceac85b31f7118fe022ff77a87379e304c","a3c6d2ea5747f5ea4ae2e5726327b92b295cf271","1e3ea187224818c2024915c999f37cf4bc012859","9d9c620044c9c3c38bee5ef8e1a0abc47e59a3aa","872d2f0a92f1ee55e8906f9a3f60e8ffba37bd03","dbac900f7fdac6a7792fc7eba7c1cfdb9941a956","e0b26290db77577f55a94fe54ba7f75b7eb99232","fab4b3a594c05c22a0128f8ea03590c816b2b1da","dc50a1d29524eb7d66c5a3dbdf16aef92b1853a4","94b63ab90b4b4d2ca4a4ec497b39ec9a06e83d28","1b4758d3f6214cf00f215ecb4dd44154e98c26df","151f3045fb5c95b9d22cb4cb41715a4b1e91eb91","7cfe0032bbd1ba85bf8a142c2fe4e1ab48d04030","e5444f608226f29cbe6c8e91cdf57fcb9f01208d","366e85ef96293dbf3e771671797c61e55ab84f46","94eb1935984493da96da96a6bae4a941336b48c4","daba28653102c533bd5623382238b17111fc83dc","17b3128ea00f7f46b2869827678acd6e78577051","dd7dc1d3eb520690e24d7222547058cd15a5198e","067811215e2e69471101d2e2995f14754f1383eb","e725921ea78f7dfd1607460f8e8a6fffc8db9eb3","f61e18216b9aec091ba1ba27051b61317707a6b7","99436f3d607559cf9585df86e8e223fb03083c8a","c15e4e89168a619073d18fd6572ed78b66fa2618","1a0546c5f3cfcc498c0a945eb0744f1da24d7371"],"pdfUrls":["http://horizon.documentation.ird.fr/exl-doc/pleins_textes/divers14-06/010047194.pdf","http://download-redirector.springer.com/redirect?contentType=pdf&ddsId=art:10.1186/1475-2875-8-116&originUrl=http://malariajournal.biomedcentral.com/article/10.1186/1475-2875-8-116"],"title":"Impact of child malnutrition on the specific anti-Plasmodium falciparum antibody response","doi":"10.1186/1475-2875-8-116","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1475-2875-8-116","venue":"Malaria Journal"}

During last decade, there have been impressive endeavors to design efficient authentication protocols which can provide secure and anonymous communication for end-users. In this research, we formally analyze a recently improved authentication protocol which is proposed for RFID tags consistent with EPC Class 1 Generation 2 standard. Our analysis show that however the authors have tried to improve the original protocol and make it secure against various active and passive attacks, but still their improved version has some serious drawbacks which make it vulnerable to traceability and forward traceability privacy attacks. Our attacks are mounted in the Ouafi and Phan's RFID formal privacy model which is an extended version of Juels and Weis's well-known privacy model. Finally, we modify the structure of analyzed protocol and propose a revised version which prevents all discovered attacks.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"An AKARI-based Secure Communication Scheme for EPC Tags","doi":"10.1109/rtuwo.2017.8228535","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/rtuwo.2017.8228535","venue":"2017 Advances in Wireless and Optical Communications (RTUWO)"}

mediators.","inCitations":["19bd5f48cebe71a33076be8abe8cb2aa8178dc17","ea86d05d3d6912d8bd8f296cec9d2f6c6e00f8e5","2e7b9b99042156e61c2bd9c532b8b37768c34a24","b608e048643ae16ad7d094a63bc6cca5aeeb804f","7dec9cc23e143bc2a833caeeb595c6f2d9630200","291bdd3b9fa7c52e10d33431924e8e6818660d8a","dbe4b49f09e119e1aecb5c77905dd0bd1f0f5f43","4ae39c84624e85629183aba58ba30634e57958dd","a7c8ca0fa2f05a7439c68e479bafe1588fcae1f1","7171086a1c7ce3e7c9b7a8789f788172fab30b76","b9f86952e9242cb2aeca5a87bed3e05cc17ee157","293edc12524a996ba79302586b02b430eab5a562","0c97970d4f669ed15c593a8642771968fe0c0fba","c5b4ebece93723af9ee1908a460b1ce36a03b72f","ce7ba0ff62f856488c521bf70af44fa24dce7f73","4745d66ddf2880d40bedb9f3f47ab331519ccb13","ed4af0b7e8d4a3b26b8e772b368fe82df5880705","fc0597fc4a7a4f48ef86efbfe0359af7f5028462","ed7c139a6f4ea5503d7d2ae31798a86125e77d22","81c1fa4d09ab588157b6bb16646b8e6dd42dd0aa","151a955653e035525f2d17b11cafc7d33e47bbfe","975bdc60c488e155a9176a44c412d1698eb60ac9","38c57890bd1c8cc3fd7042df0413ce444bcad32b","db3d3a74f1fc46ac8df2a9a70641185e5e16a349","7fe1c28fde4b61d41086b078b6baa45913791794","832b6bd14ae86499b464014f02d26408fdc455be","8b9b16fdbc6f51e4940fd7b2c141f28611847c65","0c587bd219acce158875172f09f293ed53af2367","01bcfa36662394a12100f3bb8e0bfa3c4ccb82ac","1ebf5d4dd63db614822d5655c0f9ace64f0804fb","3367e2a359f2bbe0454f64dda40128460d40db67","fe9671066eaa7098ac41733524ca273681308622","ac19a6d7218b2dd5711b229878855616884e7ce6","c8d7f4b1a9119e0bde3b5d897a0c701381433766","932fab31ba15c64d372bcaf6051be081e890143d","0e15d2fbc71a5050996a1ee60d1c43132e8f7f1c","412e7ccd0bb7bb86c9a2449e38f434f3296405d2","801e7ef9bec5a7562c5e862ba845d5d814b4b8b3","94d9615911cad493e4f63bb79dc5284850814d42","1fa00bc6a373ceb72189b6f9535c9b6ceac50005","25c787b2b157e72fef8c27535f75708b265297ae","4d1d71ab7d1a1399bd58e16107c961c71f9a5543","7f9bac9dbc20fdab7a1bd31fb6338029dd4a95e6","f8f8dfd0a234ee84121cf25b2ef8a98ed0147ef1","88c8e55f0e9f8bfb2de3d1906cad4fbbc9c9b077","37107f4392759ef11c33edda5618d3ca7eb5d9fa","d687a714c61d24afb72687dfe69c92096c230640","c0b6ce66dc3e8e107b0b3c4d411a87b40613c075","f3b85ec7111f1d5e48ee25d8c251f20c20e7f50d","22ac5fefb75ee4ee77b03a5c983b7647e5d1e042","562b0e1470411ed163ebaa18d5f3f4e3895e20e0","0d114bd33d0891a54de56d96d887df4fb98ce454","3ee267f94dccebcb863a711aec4e0caddda0bf61","fb00603058ad1c274c40f06495309f44d5cef9d7","51005eadb9262e22ae2c7720b6dafe9feffa93c0","29aa548d1cd869e084cdee62a9c144707a783038","21d40b3f62b8d01d1a25e8aed7614237fed721b1","5ba158d622985859346fdab9136b46660fe56d30","0984bbb26f4e752870a1949bfb0057f3307dfedd","f94629a56eaf8c5733e88e4361b51ed6693520a4","477bd7fe347e8d5c5a52b38e21e0c7fcfbfc2dd2","24bef2f75f1e379b58e86b43b39c625d7d8b65cd","26de192b4a89fc5385be27d43ea63cc83d85e94a","1b707849011ef98cd82750adf55944ebb0ac5922","1d8a55ed3ac95a7c754426d41d8be73f4b03d213","f07d21b1ecfa18ab26426f9d3dfea2c2702fc89e","5568585b5920ac4eca000f38b4dc4217c5f24c39","dd091a224b80c83239cdd58999dc683b7bcef133","b186679b0dd3dd43924eaee2d6b714f773de2016","cfbcc745e6ad5de174bc295d106efcd532bebb49","84cc0c23ed52a2dc5ef4b484f202fc9d24f45858","8d64b8974cd75e46b4d675705e177dd69da00289","1fca80c4418514a77adc56aace55daf60cfe9153","6c628d83ffa3af8cb0e7ef192d82a6eceb3c10eb","c10012e0e39af6b4d9afcc7f6ed32caa6c606f4d","50a1268c1623b9ae41ee571f78c1f1d2135868e8","fdee7d2172244d8f6ad6eea319e0e1f1abe8ab3a","507909df42eb4dd9bdcec7908443061ed8ae0551","7a84287bc48a9a2ae3c52a71affbbb22b5a8aa23","3c61a0f513484aa8c5fc96f1799198eb7c870fc1","56eb96e225dba276060fa574d63fbac806236f5e","3d7150109c6f5826556a45fda3a2dff886c86642","138cbfd327e500a4b16da390582b905a6d2c62f9","efc969e8c931f43c5e3f500aac0d940a86e66419","46e79bfa89a1b86d1b51a4272351fce4a3dca89f","43f4373f2d448b16dca18cebbca4a059594f0b57","e611c542a1e489118007898b1667e1ec5aa4e157","9339d6b96462e2d0eff935eddb755bdd04eef3eb","eb70c933cb293e68946174dbcce383f9f54d5339","8cd8b53cceb7cdfb7b7df0d69901d632da4f5336","0f10ba4d0f44aaeb6690dc6829134525acaea7a6","9b9cbd07aaee8babde264aac20c3a412d0d440a9","97f559ce67e5c0f7ae123ff3002fdc479bad3084","0aa2dd50d8d2cd2f9c21b9f1321fb03bc55ea0bb","214d52dc56764b2c05b075a1fba7412e027a0243","644543af384947a7566f49459022e5592120fd3a","7c44801f76d848472c47b383f738e472d83f0bca","02fb52d1aec9dcfc8136aec53f2a80e71b3c8569","9d0a250faeacfa49b28d81e77448a935399cfae1","a574224eb750d2e9e44bfef465530cfff9e9aeb7","2c8af23f352d905d5f647ff4f412f251fc98e430","25ec043b08930eb186fbdc9394159bd8b3339060","502b42b08a773459f8c45b3bfd39cf4210814f95","f100d0152ff4ab6339e26307687aa9dbd1bd835d","45d72063bd00e8231dc121411921ed1d713f5acc","10b756cb1695e2a486ad373db49b05aa38c7f097","af0631aa778c3aa7fb5b868dc6525a5989d1c3cd","d16b06a872a9637d549a9d2dccecff5e9be98115","2a0d423e0ca45ce69dad1b5d4d5f47016c630507","8570401c0a3546b279187566233671b2760fc512","53c00a02a281682ba33c62bd89d3a46defdc9199","56d9c86b9c67ccc1663bf1862143549c0de5e0ad","fe0540953d9417cc094cc9bdce82ffc5d613574f","95903ac661cdc7fce93a5d5b5419d5d673347d9d","0832ca61df5127a91429430bd54be0d9b80c5860","30f6f0d88725f15529993f67d72

To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, the results of the ECBO-based designs have been compared with those of eight other nature-inspired metaheuristic optimisation algorithms. Parametric and non-parametric statistical hypothesis tests are conducted to validate the consistency of the performance of the ECBO-based DIs and DDs. Simulation results demonstrate that ECBO-based designs achieve the least absolute magnitude error and demonstrate a competitive group delay response of the designed DIs and DDs of different orders as compared with the designs based on the competing algorithms. The proposed DIs and DDs also outperform those of the design approaches published in literature and achieve the best responses in terms of the maximum absolute magnitude error over a wide frequency range.","inCitations":["604842de2a836a6ccfa7818aaad35933bc1ac4d2","d889aa4893b94791d5153870cd64d38e69b62b16","395c88e526472fd064078a93d45ba35f76a2a83e","f7d715f08ca6ee76d1d2a0b4df0ee3b802f9cf17","f67fa897b09ee32ec97499e38c397dcbcd5890fc","f12cf4e82e23c3721969efc4d84bd62add29a41b"],"pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1504/IJBIC.2017.10004357"],"title":"Enhanced colliding bodies optimisation-based optimal design of wideband digital integrators and differentiators","doi":"10.1504/IJBIC.2017.10004357","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1504/IJBIC.2017.10004357","venue":"IJBIC"}

Similar taxes, known as sin taxes, generally have three specific goals: 1) to lower consumption of the offending substance or activity; 2) to minimize the black market; and 3) to generate government revenues. We find that on the whole, caloric sweetened beverage taxes fail to meet each of the criteria for effective sin taxes. They neither meaningfully lower consumption of caloric sweeteners generally, nor do they provide for a healthier alternative. They are straightforward to geographically circumvent, and there are many carve outs which are not taxed, dampening the impact they could have on the consumption of caloric sweeteners. Although these taxes are potentially a significant source of tax revenue, such collections are largely and disproportionately borne by the poor. Instead, we propose enacting a broad policy on a national level consisting of three components: 1) removing government support for caloric sweeteners, 2) levying a federal excise tax on caloric sweeteners at the producer level, and 3) investing in research, implementation of significant subsidies, and development and transmission of explicit government advice in favor of foods that are irrefutably beneficial for the vast majority of human beings.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Caloric Sweetened Beverage Taxes: A Toothless Solution?","doi":"10.1515/ev-2017-0009","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1515/ev-2017-0009","venue":""}

This series includes one sporadic case who had previously been reported in this journal under the diagnosis of \"rigid spine syndrome\" in 1977. Time of observation ranged from three to ten years. Detailed cardiological assessment was performed in all patients, skeletal muscle biopsies were obtained from 9 out of 10 and cardiac muscle biopsies from 2 out of 10 patients. One patient showed evidence of cardiomyopathy in the absence of clinically apparent neuromuscular disease and one sibling of another EDMD patient reportedly had a similar combination of symptoms which, to our knowledge, has not yet been reported. Cardiac involvement was found to consist of four independent, albeit often combined features: 1) impairment of impulse generating cells; 2) conduction defects with atrial preponderance; 3) increased atrial and ventricular heterotopia; and 4) functional impairment of ventricular myocardium. Ventricular involvement as apparent from ventricular heterotopia, abnormal enddiastolic diameter, decrease of contractility and/or morphological evidence of ventricular myocardial disease was found in 7 out of 10 patients and confirmed by myocardial histopathology in two EDMD patients. In one myocardial biopsy extensive accumulations of intermediate filaments were observed, a rare finding, which has not been linked to EDMD before. Skeletal muscle biopsies showed evidence of myopathy throughout but several equivocal features such as fibre type grouping in EDMD and fibre type disproportion in EDMDP were also observed. The variability of clinical manifestation of both cardiac and neuromuscular disease encompassed a broader spectrum than apparent from the literature. The consequences for the inherent differential diagnosis are discussed.","inCitations":["3c3825a503ec03511aaed691801f6e4e888603db","d83318dddb9bd376f7bdede7a695f4f9b531d627","b9a45586152442c4668d4356da65743d4c51c73f","3f34a9aa84d54f042bd240520069e6942fd58b4b","ff54260e14ef83889ff7a21a78cceef8bea6d4c6","d2dc7e8b54f5e32cccec5abbbd2ac3aa13851779","b88da3cfeed4b43e0ce8e49c2530fc4443408b82","579c319990f08a2c24657f7a33052e70867f661f","b943ee6953d6beb85acc72257acd95a1a8f2df02","472d828f1871b798a6ed3803f95bc4afb49b4f46","112dd47c5ca3bd0ac2967233085a3ae517110e55","e1aa4a5f003a0dbcfed2a63148a24588dadf9c26","a05520a09eb296b91a2608ebb4f6d38d9644e662","ce8a550fb74c31dc377a2ba867c76ca61163c364","c316416436c5a30c22507cd24e5b3423ca221e9f","717020bcc520f1eb93c2ce3c8ce1c301a00b455f","8df1491e1263b861cb242f408aa5716898fefc1c","d6c67a0ae4216eebda9e77c219221aca31ea4e1f","b3a9d954eeb62b03703ee389ba3355058405d8ff","a7ddbf6dda42d71660f30e967777b4763498b197","f14d2937c8e87033ca4cb296f3ff1f8f101b45fa","275af38bea8599e4b4a2c81a60870d55da13b1ce","fde2738c7b4466ae40bf9e7462692110b9dbd885","e02588691e6adca4387e6175f2fcabe5bb6ee1df","1b94ea9cf7111f291262735bf5c00eb35207f6ba","93925155d29f26e8892430745c90d664e4febd9c","56f3192aa56ed98293ea4a738327cd0c2f451af2","bcc4e1337b0830a13fd75dbf5061d9c9bfae33aa","0ecf897ca098203b23e32b851be26554556a4a33","56d4994b848a91ec841adc1e8fc6c3e3546a8129","e88d02ae9bd911919bd11aa2bed66030ee039093"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy: disease spectrum and differential diagnosis.","doi":"10.1055/s-2008-1052404","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1055/s-2008-1052404","venue":"Neuropediatrics"}

However, firms operating in multiple markets may choose minimal adaptation to local market trends in favor of introducing proprietary value propositions that satisfy customers’ latent needs (Ghauri, Elg, Tarnovskaya, & Wang, 2011; Harris & Cai, 2002). Scholars have suggested that such firms are “market driving” (Jaworski, Kohli, & Sahay, 2000). This paper investigates how firms can be market driving in foreign markets. Findings suggest that market driving firms tend to possess certain capabilities in order to reconcile conflicting demands in the local markets and company strategies at the global level. Using network, knowledge transfer, branding and market orientation literature, the present study provides evidence on the capabilities that global firms possess in order to drive markets. Based on a survey of 110 international companies, this study shows that strong capabilities in configuration, networking, knowledge transfer and internal branding can lead to market driving behaviors. This study is the first to carry out a systematic investigation of market driving behavior in international firms.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://kclpure.kcl.ac.uk/portal/files/63762325/JBR_paper_Pre_print.pdf"],"title":"1 Market Driving Strategies : Beyond Localization","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Little is known about how such proteins interact functionally and biochemically with each other. Here, we focus on the Y-box transcription factor ZONAB (zonula occludens 1-associated nucleic-acid-binding protein)/DbpA (DNA-binding protein A) and the Rho GTPase activator guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF)-H1/Lbc's first cousin, which are two tight-junction-associated signalling proteins that regulate proliferation. Our data show that the two proteins interact and that ZONAB activity is Rho-dependent. Overexpression of GEF-H1 induces accumulation of ZONAB in the nucleus and activates transcription. Microtubule-affinity regulating kinase/partition-defective-1, another type of GEF-H1-associated signalling protein, remains in the cytoplasm and partially co-localizes with the exchange factor. GEF-H1 and ZONAB are required for expression of endogenous cyclin D1, a crucial RhoA signalling target gene, and GEF-H1-stimulated cyclin D1 promoter activity requires ZONAB. Our data thus indicate that GEF-H1 and ZONAB form a signalling module that mediates Rho-regulated cyclin D1 promoter activation and expression.","inCitations":["e166227f8dcdb056d38a3e9d6577601d3d101dbc","5cb70470add0e30309c6a1536a69583e673fab3d","e80cf34738b1846b836dc1dd4679b60ae381060f","089a8deeff5b01e0896c1c1dceefe76ff5371da6","c5388e82bba8071f8587a9645a56662f4b674418","d6823575a7217e3787a205f38d5349b08dd852c4","1b797d201c7c5ad22decfc78abc36361fddbcac9","ad98cfc8d1f906ee4b1a673bd2b2f2a60ef7a062","f937fb74d2658c6f28da7fa56f672717c6fcc8a8","0f159d23d3b922c3c69b41ec34b0e3040a217f14","34ec09f25e3eaad9e8c7aa96ffc8dcb9aa4bfb9a","c09bfd80f6f1584d84cda2a028b2040d75e44bb1","abf85eda820c877d76baa735e6405ca59cf74d08","435220074e6686eba219fa8631cfef1e1b33eee5","0114e1f67532a3baf763be93960cd9f1b2ea6a4a","f1a7f7f415a1bd4ea373d8168b5be5f9f8732298","b3a794abc0377f0df3cf58084b1fba4ab8980340","23485f6985d8bb840481dc117e5f1c64313ef7e9","2181bdf215d9ebdf56930448e7660cec7ce04ded","57ef8199ec81cff17965869bd8b34ad313024f29","bb37e23e2161c934ee73912fd739b8bc4b89cc86","ccb4cb24d08c85d3e04f137764f267c925725cd4","ec2ac23ac50642e8b22dafcc62477abe414f55f7","527d31136165ad26c356fb430c45d2a0bcd76e55","6074b767433154ebcf029497b3783c42e5163fd7","f9971a76e69111865b105388fed0ce2b505e2262"],"pdfUrls":["http://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/20145/1/20145.pdf","http://embor.embopress.org/content/embor/10/10/1125.full.pdf","http://embor.embopress.org/content/embor/10/10/1125/DC1/embed/inline-supplementary-material-1.pdf?download=true","http://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/pmc/69/c5/embor2009182.PMC2738780.pdf","https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/pmc/oa_pdf/69/c5/embor2009182.PMC2738780.pdf"],"title":"The Y-box factor ZONAB/DbpA associates with GEF-H1/Lfc and mediates Rho-stimulated transcription","doi":"10.1038/embor.2009.182","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1038/embor.2009.182","venue":"EMBO reports"}

Fletcher","ids":["47265605"]}],"journalName":"Mutation research","paperAbstract":"Some organisms are extremely resistant to radiation and must be able to repair double-strand breaks in their DNA accurately. The only known mechanism suitable for this is to use an intact homologous double helix as a template and to splice across the break by recombination. The model advanced here proposes that death is caused by destructive lesions, mainly double-strand breaks, in all the inter-repairable copies so close together that recombination repair cannot function. Death is related to the exponential of dose r where r is the number of copies of the genome. A graph of ln(-ln survival) against ln dose is used to produce a linear dose—survival relationship, the slope of which gives the number of inter-repairable copies of te genome(=number of hits per lethal event). In Ustilago maydis it seems that unless all the chromatids are to broken within a few thousand base pairs all ds breaks are repaired. The size of this critical target is similar to the size of a geme. Meiotic pairing in fungi starts outside the genes, and it is therefore suggested that specific pairing sites between genes define the ends of the targets. The model also describes the radiation-induced death of Micrococcus radiodurans and Saccharomyces cerevisiae . Cultured mammalian cells also show a linear ln(-ln survival)/ln dose relationship with a slope of 1.5 showing that both 1st and 2nd order killing occurred. Sublethal radiation induces recombination in heterozygous diploid U. maydis proportional to the square of the dose. This may be explained as a direct result of repair recombination between homologous chromosomes when both chromatids of one are broken in the same target, giving 2-hit kinetics. Sister-chromatid repair is preferred. Polyploid yeast can only use pairs of chromosomes for repair, showing that chromosome pairing is required for recombination repair, and mitotic pairing is restricted to bivalents in the same way that meiotic pairing is. This mitotic pairing may explain the ability of some fungi to undergo meiotic recombination without the synaptonemal complex which characterises meiosis in higher eukaryotes.","inCitations":["241218d7f57c4ac853f9e5cf4b654d7758c3ccf9"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Resistance to radiation, recombination repair of DNA and chromosome organisation.","doi":"10.1016/0027-5107(81)90178-0","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/0027-5107%2881%2990178-0","venue":"Mutation research"}
