Some of these children have nearly normal vision, some are totally blind, but the majority fall into a broad range between these two points. Children are said to have ‘low vision’ or ‘partial sight’ when they have: (a) a corrected visual acuity in the better eye of <6/18 to ‘perception of light’ (or a visual field of less than 10 degrees); and (b) the ability to use their residual vision to orientate themselves or to perform tasks.1 They are identified at eye clinics, school screening programmes, community based rehabilitation (CBR) programmes or special schools for the visually impaired. \n \nThe education, employment prospects, independence and quality of life of a child with low vision can all be improved by enhancing vision. Optical devices (spectacles, magnifiers and telescopes) play a key role in achieving this. Studies carried out in East Africa,2 South America3 and West Africa4 indicate that approximately half of children who have low vision show an improvement in distance and/or near visual acuity with the help of spectacles, a magnifier or both. The majority of magnifiers are prescribed for children who have a visual acuity in the better eye of <6/60 to 1/60.3,4","inCitations":["eaa758e0b3f4383e40e07782eea6839d356277ee","13a9c6ec30a42d7411e942f11381a7cc29ee0b52","ec5c10acf31ec81ef7430f99386a9a1f9bcf6688","024416b39705ad5c6abeeb4a45bd5b2ae936e35f","c17dc975f0cb0e15ff9f40da9b2f2e902cced8d3","448ec5fa18e0725f6713cf8aa988a52a71bc9ce8","a439b0068a411100aa8b797e76eed8c96c876cc8","821d7c18dd9712424f294d76562fa34ed19af0e5","5b2e6d0eb61cde2115dd147155648a00b8ccbb3e","e7e0bfb3f9dd5f167dbbf37bed61b3100b5af328"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Optical services for visually impaired children.","doi":"","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"Community eye health"}

Investigations on thermal convective instabilities occurring in the spherical gap flow under terrestrial conditions are of basic importance, especially for the understanding of symmetry-breaking bifurcations during the transition to chaos. Microgravity experiments on thermal convection with a simulated central force field are important for the understanding of large-scale geophysical motions such as the convective transport phenomena in the Earth's liquid outer core. More than one diagnostic tool is needed to examine and characterize the different flow types. Flow visualization, Wollaston shearing interferometry and laser Doppler velocimetry should be available for space experiments. This report summarizes concurrent theoretical, numerical and experimental studies for the preparation of a Get Away Special (Shuttle) experiment as well as a Space Station experiment inside the Fluid Science Laboratory. The special experimental device for investigations of supercritical and turbulent thermal convection in spherical shells under a central force field with respect to geophysical simulations is called an electrohydrodynamic container. A central symmetric force field similar to the gravity field acting on planets can be produced using the effect of the dielectrophoretic force field by applying a high-voltage potential difference to the inner and outer sphere.","inCitations":["2dc5ec1c6ec3dab90e4510d5d31217dd4b8a6db3","0c4993c31ef54db9f632c6ba16efcb7bc0cfbd1e"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Estimates on diagnostic methods for investigations of thermal convection between spherical shells in space","doi":"10.1088/0957-0233/10/10/306","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1088/0957-0233%2F10%2F10%2F306","venue":""}

During a long time, organizations have been implementing lean practices to achieve their goals with maximum efficiency and efficacy. To reach higher levels of quality and flexibility, and also reduce costs, the deployment of lean production practices presents the individuals as a fundamental part to achieve and sustain continuous improvement. Despite all the operational benefits provided by lean practices, some researchers state that their adoption might increase physical and psychological demands on employees, as the search for maximum productivity through cost reduction can, usually, neglect human needs. Thus, the present research aims at comparing physical and psychological demands in productive areas with different levels of lean implementation. The paper presents a comparison between the lean implementation level of two production cells from an optical manufacturer, and the ergonomics analytical assessment of both cells by the Renault method. The results point that cells with higher levels of lean implementation are more likely to present lower levels of both physical and psychological demands.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://www.nexos.ufsc.br/index.php/lean/article/download/2121/pdf"],"title":"A study about the relationship between lean implementation and psychophysical demands in productive areas","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Pelajaran seni musik bisa diberikan \ndalam bentuk teori maupun praktik. Pada SMP yang menggunakan kurikulum \ntingkat satuan pendidikan (KTSP) terdapat kompetensi dasar menyajikan karya \nseni musik tradisional Nusantara secara perseorangan dan berkelompok di kelas \natau di sekolah yang harus dicapai oleh siswa salah satunya yaitu di kelas VIII C. \nUntuk mencapai kompetensi dasar ini, di SMPN 22 Semarang pelaksanaan \npembelajaranya cukup unik. Sebab, siswa diajarkan untuk dapat mengekspresikan \ndiri dengan memainkan alat musik gamelan jawa. Seperti yang peneliti ketahui \nbahwa pada penelitian-penelitian yang telah dilakukan sebelumnya tentang \nansambel kebanyakan dilaksanakan dengan menggunakan alat musik modern \nseperti pianika, recorder maupun gitar. Untuk itu, peneliti tertarik untuk \nmengetahui bagaimana proses pembelajaran ansambel musik gamelan jawa yang \ndilaksanakan di kelas VIII C SMPN 22 Semarang dan mengetahui bagaimana \ntanggapan siswa mengenai faktor-faktor yang mempengaruhi hasil belajar \nansambel musik pada siswa kelas VIII C SMPN 22 Semarang. \nPenelitian ini menggunakan jenis kualitatif deskriptif dengan analisis data \nmenggunakan teknik kuantitatif dan kualitatif (mix methods). Teknik \npengumpulan data menggunakan teknik wawancara, studi dokumen, observasi, \ndan teknik angket. \nHasil penelitian menunjukkan bahwa guru seni musik dalam \nmelaksanakan pembelajaran ansambel musik menggunakan tiga tahapyaitu \nperencanaan, pelaksanaan, dan evaluasi. Pada tahap perencanaan guru \nmempersiapkan perangkat mengajar berupa silabus dan rencana pelaksanaan \npembelajaran (RPP). Tahap pelaksanaan guru melaksanakan tiga kegiatan berupa \nkegiatan pendahuluan, kegiatan inti dan kegiatan akhir. Pada tahap evaluasi \ndilaksanakan dalam bentuk tes unjuk kerja. Adapun dalam pembelajaran ansambel \nmusik gamelan jawa, faktor-faktor yang mempengaruhi proses dan hasil belajar \nansambel musik gamelan jawa mendapat tanggapan positif dan negatif dari siswa. \nTangggapan positif siswa diantaranya yaitu perhatian guru terhadap siswa, \nhubungan guru dengan siswa, bakat siswa, minat siswa, perhatian siswa, disiplin \nsekolah, media masa, bentuk kehidupan masyarakat, keadaan ekonomi keluarga, \nstandar kurikulum, alat pelajaran, kesehatan siswa, cara orang tua mendidik, dan \npengertian orang tua. Sedangkan faktor-faktor yang mendapat tanggapan negatif \ndari siswa yaitu perhatian guru dalam memberikan tugas, keadaan gedung, motif \nsiswa, dan standar pelajaran di atas ukuran. \nHarapanya pembelajaran seni musik lebih direncanakan lagi secara matang \nagar pelaksanaannya bisa berjalan sesuai dengan perencanaan yang telah dibuat.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Pembelajaran Ansambel Musik Di Smpn 22 Semarang","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Individuals rely on IT support to reduce clerical loads and enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of their work as well. When they work in teams, they also require self-confidence and the need for cognition to promote their individual creativity. Data were derived from the members of a large system integration company in South Korea (N = 256, 50 teams). As the study considered variables at both the team and individual levels, we adopted a multilevel analysis approach. We found that individual self-confidence, which indicates the degree of perceived possibility of success at a task, and the need for cognition, the intrinsic motivation to engage in and enjoy thinking, affected individual creativity significantly. Further, the degree of IT support, the team-level variable, had a significant effect on individual creativity. The degree of IT support did not have a significant effect on the relationship between self-confidence and individual creativity, but did have a moderating effect that weakened the relationship between the need for cognition and individual creativity. These findings have implications for theories of members’ creativity in organizations.","inCitations":["4e79640d6b76cf0a9bd0c3ad9f2430f7b69b09d9","1d5f0b80398eeb1b4abda14cf9b78c4552e8da31"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Exploring the Role of Self-Confidence, Need-for-Cognition, and the Degree of IT Support on Individual Creativity: Multilevel Analysis Approach","doi":"10.1007/s12144-016-9445-z","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s12144-016-9445-z","venue":""}

Due to the domain shift between images and videos, directly applying the image-based face detectors onto videos usually gives unsatisfactory performance. In this paper, we introduce the BoxFlow – a new unsupervised detector adaptation method that can effectively adapt a face detector pre-trained on static images to videos. BoxFlow unsupervisedly adapts face detectors through fully exploiting the motion contexts across video frames. In particular, BoxFlow introduces three novel components: (1) generalized heat map representation of face locations with augmented shape flexibility; (2) motion based temporal contextual regularization among adjacent frames for unsupervised face detection refinement; (3) a self-paced learning strategy that adapts face detectors from easy data samples to challenging ones progressively. With these key components, we develop a systematic unsupervised face detector adaptation framework to help face detectors adapt to various deployed environments. Extensive experiments on the IDA dataset clearly demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method. Without utilizing any annotation, the BoxFlow achieves about 10%-20% performance gain in terms of Average Precision than directly applying image-based face detectors.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/FG.2017.46"],"title":"BoxFlow: Unsupervised Face Detector Adaptation from Images to Videos","doi":"10.1109/FG.2017.46","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FG.2017.46","venue":"2017 12th IEEE International Conference on Automatic Face & Gesture Recognition (FG 2017)"}

Fifty female Sprege-Dawley rats aged 3 months were randomly divided into ovariectomized (OVX) and sham operated (Sham) groups, euthanized after 4, 8, 12, 16 and 20 weeks respectively. The bone mineral density (BMD) of left femur was measured. The right femur distal metaphysical cancellous bone was fixed in 10% formalin to observe the changes of the bone marrow pathology. The function of hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) was evaluated by colony forming assay. The level of granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) was measured by the enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The results showed that the BMD of femur in OVX 4 week group not decreased significantly as compared with the Sham 4 group, but the volume of adipose tissue significantly increased. The BMD of femur in OVX 8, 12, 16 and 20 weeks decreased significantly as compared with the corresponding Sham groups (P < 0.05). Meanwhile, the volume of hematopoietic tissue decreased and volume of adipose tissue increased, the megakaryocyte number decreased, the number of osteoclasts and mast cells increased in bone marrow section, as compared with sham operated group (P < 0.05). After rats were ovariectomized for 16 weeks, the GM-CSF level was significantly lower than that of Sham group. After rats were ovariectomized for 12 weeks, the GM-CSF level was obviously lower than that of Sham group (P < 0.05). It is concluded that the bone marrow hematopoiesis function also decreases when the BMD of ovariectomized rats reduces.

This case also provides evidence for the suggestion that this syndrome may coexist with upper airway resistance syndrome, although the exact nature of their relationship must still be better established.","inCitations":["fb53b325e00c2d62a0f4e155f91de870032af759"],"pdfUrls":["https://static-content.springer.com/openpeerreview/art:10.1186%2F1752-1947-6-241/13256_2011_2198_ReviewerReport_V2_R3.pdf","http://download-redirector.springer.com/redirect?contentType=pdf&ddsId=art:10.1186/1752-1947-6-241&originUrl=http://jmedicalcasereports.biomedcentral.com/article/10.1186/1752-1947-6-241","https://static-content.springer.com/openpeerreview/art:10.1186%2F1752-1947-6-241/13256_2011_2198_ReviewerReport_V1_R3.pdf","https://static-content.springer.com/openpeerreview/art:10.1186%2F1752-1947-6-241/13256_2011_2198_AuthorComment_V2.pdf","https://static-content.springer.com/openpeerreview/art:10.1186%2F1752-1947-6-241/13256_2011_2198_AuthorComment_V3.pdf","https://archive-ouverte.unige.ch/files/downloads/0/0/0/2/4/3/3/2/unige_24332_attachment01.pdf","https://static-content.springer.com/openpeerreview/art:10.1186%2F1752-1947-6-241/13256_2011_2198_ReviewerReport_V2_R2.pdf","https://static-content.springer.com/openpeerreview/art:10.1186%2F1752-1947-6-241/13256_2011_2198_ReviewerReport_V2_R1.pdf","http://archive-ouverte.unige.ch/files/downloads/0/0/0/2/4/3/3/2/unige_24332_attachment01.pdf","https://static-content.springer.com/openpeerreview/art:10.1186%2F1752-1947-6-241/13256_2011_2198_ReviewerReport_V1_R1.pdf"],"title":"Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome after surgical correction of an aortic coarctation: a case report","doi":"10.1186/1752-1947-6-241","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1752-1947-6-241","venue":"Journal of Medical Case Reports"}

Nevertheless, the presence of endocannabinoid receptors in structures of the eye responsible for formation and outflow of aqueous humor is an explanation for effectiveness of these compounds, when administered in topical form.

Preincubation of PMN with piroxicam (50 μM) before stimulation with the chemotactic peptide f-met-leu-phe (FMLP) inhibited each of these responses. In addition, binding of 3 H-FMLP was significantly reduced in the presence of piroxicam. In contrast, when either concanavalin A (Con A) or phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) were used as stimuli in the presence of piroxicam, aggregation and secretion of lysozyme proceeded normally, whereas O 2 • generation and CTC fluorescence decrements were significantly inhibited. The binding of 3 H-Con A was unaffected by piroxicam. Since secretion and aggregation could be dissociated from the CTC-fluorescence response, it is unlikely that an event monitored by decrements in CTC fluorescence is necessary for stimulus-secretion coupling.","inCitations":["b3b2dce681e2de6db0b3180fb9801e2fb2fda0a7","8d595b798f45dd35b7199d6b2bc954afe7a9ced5","d6587ffe0a00a08fb2469edfdea833098cea0a37","ffa6e95653b2e972ea3e2bfbcdf86c290c117c05","2ad1abe158e295a6c9aea8386f2191b6ec4c93d9","4447ae43ecd52a38502b3543236b9330ecef693f","923d0b1b7f0bc852ebfc1f431811805a79f23b06"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Dissociation by piroxicam of degranulation and superoxide anion generation from decrements in chlortetracycline fluorescence of activated human neutrophils.","doi":"10.1016/0006-291X(82)91966-0","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/0006-291X%2882%2991966-0","venue":"Biochemical and biophysical research communications"}

The expression of ptxR itself, which occurs from two promoters (P1 and P2), is not completely understood. We have recently demonstrated that the ptxR upstream region contains potential binding sites for multiple regulators, including the virulence factor regulator Vfr. In this study, we identified within the ptxR upstream region, a 25 bp sequence to which Vfr specifically binds. The sequence is located 20-44 (32.5) bp 5' of the ptxR P2 promoter, and overlaps a potential binding site for the iron-starvation sigma factor PvdS. We also show that, throughout the growth cycle, deletion of vfr reduces ptxR expression from the P2 promoter in the P. aeruginosa strain PAO1 by four- to eightfold, but does not affect ptxR expression from P1. Further, loss of Vfr eliminates the PtxR-induced enhancement in the synthesis of exotoxin A and the metalloproteinase LasB. Our results suggest that Vfr modulates toxA and lasB expression in PAO1 through PtxR. A model defining the relationships between these different genes is presented.","inCitations":["b9dee2793400eff3f5c8554060d84d392080e505","2911d48cb6cc6d754a6e851bbde1eeb7d632be47","e8e33f1d93827f36a854cbe7e894d3c03d048464","43373068aaea9f4de895bc700663be324bbe0016","3d8b6741b964d1e960e3fa1d173039fe81f5fd3a","d6208a5f3b6f5ae5e590f80937d4c215e44a2f83","259ef85cb963e24d899b7cb7f324735733533b22","d5ab2285db34022bad04feb7e5d624b5186a87e6","9741de9c034cb100bc632fa307a1f1de125b67f3","b03edf1d7ad40e5670541f9483af73cf275828fb","d1d25670fcb41126420c3329139b4d4cde00e84d","b78d125d8bf5d22e2a2372a1606d586e026ed899","bb4373b61628b7779fd252c93200cdf95c0100c6","8f09e0e09726218d03674f969d2c83f585d4de41","61af2de9205731a1425e13035194a70e25d46e83","6324944e796b7296e2ca2899a4bee207e6f6f2fe","8662a0242cc1d2d70033dc66fc7cc128c7cb75a2","d5c005d4efaadd4e13c192431511ccd66eff1c07"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.microbiologyresearch.org/docserver/fulltext/micro/154/2/431.pdf?accname=guest&checksum=BD1CFE48BEBF989192864E13EFE39A6D&expires=1544953240&id=id"],"title":"Regulation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa ptxR by Vfr.","doi":"10.1099/mic.0.2007/011577-0","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1099/mic.0.2007%2F011577-0","venue":"Microbiology"}

Les resultats de la chirurgie (nombre de cervicotomies blanches et inadequates, nombre de glandes cervicales manquees) ont ete compares dans deux groupes de patients atteints d'hyperparathyroidie primaire.

Automatic left ventricular (LV) segmentation remains however challenging particularly in the presence of artifacts and for images with low contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR). It is thus crucial to give segmentation tools prior information on the LV shape in order to fill in the gaps when image content is low.

We prepended a P- and S-phase picking algorithm to achieve complete automation, and we discuss the common pitfalls for such attempts regarding both algorithms. To test the measurement schemes, a dataset of accelerograms from South Icelandic earthquakes is used on which all parameters have been determined manually as well. The proposed program facilitates automatic creation of κ-value databases from input record databases, which might be used in regional hazard analyses and to better constrain earthquake source parameter inversions.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://icesd.hi.is/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/AID_52.pdf"],"title":"Towards an Automated Kappa Measurement Procedure","doi":"10.1007/978-3-319-78187-7_4","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-78187-7_4","venue":""}

Створити сорти пшениці м’якої ярої за використання вітчизняних та іноземних сортів, носіїв пшенично-житньої транслокації (ПЖТ). Методи. Польові, лабораторні, статистичні. Результати. Перспективним напрямом селекції, що дає змогу суттєво поліпшити генофонд пшениці м’якої ярої, є створення сортів із ПЖТ 1АL.1RS. Представлено опис багаторічних селекційних досліджень, проведених у Миронівському інституті пшениці імені В. М. Ремесла НААН України (МІП), щодо одержання сортів пшениці м’якої з ПЖТ 1АL.1RS. Як вихідний селекційний матеріал використовували сорти й лінії вітчизняної та іноземної селекції, зокрема сорт ‘ТАМ 107’ (США) із ПЖТ 1АL.1RS. У процесі виконання наукової селекційної програми створено сорти пшениці м’якої озимої ‘Експромт’ (1АL.1RS), м’якої ярої ‘Струна миронівська’ (1АL.1RS) та ‘МІП Соломія’ (1АL.1RS). Сорти ‘Струна миронівська’ та ‘МІП Соломія’, згідно з результатами аналізу спектра запасних білків, містять у своїх геномах ПЖТ 1АL.1RS. ‘МІП Соломія’ успадкував її від сорту пшениці м’якої ярої ‘Струна миронівська’. Новий сорт пшениці м’якої ярої ‘МІП Соломія’ характеризується високою врожайністю, адаптивністю, стійкістю проти борошнистої роси, фузаріозу колоса, твердої сажки, високими показниками якості зерна. Висновки. Шляхом багаторічних простих парних схрещувань іноземних сортів та вітчизняного селекційного матеріалу з використанням методу педігрі створено сорти пшениці м’якої з ПЖТ 1АL.1RS. Сорт пшениці м’якої ярої ‘МІП Соломія’, переданий у 2017 р. до Державного сортовипробування, характеризується високою врожайністю, стійкістю до вилягання, низьким відсотком ураженості грибними хворобами, стійкістю проти твердої сажки, адаптивністю. Наявність пшенично-житньої транслокації в сортів ярої пшениці миронівської селекції ‘Струна миронівська’ та ‘МІП Соломія’ підтверджено за допомогою аналізу спектра запасних білків за електрофорезу в поліакріламідному гелі.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Creation of bread spring wheat breeding material with wheat-rye translocations","doi":"10.21498/2518-1017.15.1.2019.162477","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.21498/2518-1017.15.1.2019.162477","venue":""}

Poor freezability ejaculates (PFE) are known to present lower resistance than good freezability ejaculates (GFE) to cryopreservation procedures. So far, no study has evaluated whether the ability of GSH to counteract the cryopreservation-induced injuries depends on ejaculate freezability (i.e. GFE vs. PFE). For this reason, thirty boar ejaculates were divided into three equal volume fractions and cryopreserved with or without GSH at a final concentration of either 2 or 5mM in freezing media. Before and after freeze-thawing, sperm quality was evaluated through analysis of viability, motility, integrity of outer acrosome membrane, ROS levels, integrity of nucleoprotein structure, and DNA fragmentation. Ejaculates were classified into two groups (GFE or PFE) according to their post-thaw sperm motility and viability assessments in negative control (GSH 0mM), after running cluster analyses. Values of each sperm parameter were then compared between treatments (GSH 0mM, GSH 2mM, GSH 5mM) and freezability groups (GFE, PFE). In the case of GFE, GSH significantly improved boar sperm cryotolerance, without differences between 2 and 5mM. In contrast, PFE freezability was significantly increased when supplemented with 5mM GSH, but not when supplemented with 2mM GSH. In conclusion, PFE need a higher concentration of GSH than GFE to improve their cryotolerance.","inCitations":["08fd8e48d2671f424535aafb83aeab6a118e9bc9","a7df61ae1f92d44ed8b0bd68bc38115039654741","a79395bb52b432aca51585f9e4ac1156864670b9","44a138671da763a4644ab6636b959377c69c13bf","cfd2c4880902668ad8f8a411596d9ab2b249c8f2","cc26ce5bc55f6748536fdb92fa9736bcb4e07e33","a10fe73a9bff6aaf9670db5955c62a60f8090326","ee0e8e9b84db77f436a94678ef42dc9a172926e2","9a76f74bb520e705cc3ad6890e9ee10bc64dd031","846e475b4324f9e12d07a6b78f1ba8d2ee704064","2d4e820912103363e50baf080631e495cd0042d4","295bda091766a1ce9e5cbb169f4dd79d525c88cb","a179e4c8428b7c24d31408131408a7966ca59eb5","5d176f3a5cb6f838fffde0e0eaa8975d593c0c1d","43878c6007d6a564153a75774e22c2c49441a8e5","467711bb1786751039e291a1868549d0051b8f07","dbdb830d99576587f9f0e355d426bc5aca35c5f9","b577404935b155ba1f4f98fd336f6f269569e8bc","e8190b0d6694a3b20d4b292d7a5610bdb484537d","5a688ad6f382758afa39699458ef93d676e5cf62","f8129b0e223538f81e7c41887986c1e7150568b6","27786086a944027528866d898168b27297be5e57"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"The improving effect of reduced glutathione on boar sperm cryotolerance is related with the intrinsic ejaculate freezability.","doi":"10.1016/j.cryobiol.2014.02.004","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cryobiol.2014.02.004","venue":"Cryobiology"}

From these measurements and published data for the ultraviolet and infrared outside the region of measurement a bolometric geometrical albedo of 0.28 was obtained. With an adopted bolometric phase integral of 1.6 the bolometric Bond albedo is then found to be 0.45, corresponding to a temperature of equilibrium with absorbed sunlight of 105°K. If the difference between this temperature and the radiometric temperature of 128°K is due to heat from the interior the mantle is probably melted. Rough calculations suggest that even with convective cooling the initial contraction energy could explain the present radiometric temperature. Radioactivity, meteor bombardment, tidal friction, and magnetic field decay do not appear to be feasible alternative energy sources for the radiometric temperature. A simple interpretation of the radiometric temperature is that Jupiter is radiating only absorbed sunlight with a temperature of 145°K and emissivity of 0.27.","inCitations":["72ea0bb23463415a8064ad694ac4ebd8d254abcf","cff73b94c9d855bff409307556bbeb00fe15076e","9ec4afe2eec0f6336e658acc1e03ea7d7b62a070","177b840fd2ff920ff3f8bc68d9ff6c74617da2ee"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Spectrophotometry of Jupiter's 3400–10000 Å spectrum and a bolometric albedo for Jupiter","doi":"10.1016/0019-1035(65)90040-0","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/0019-1035%2865%2990040-0","venue":""}

After a routine quarantine period, all four were placed in an outdoor exhibit on the southern side of the birdhouse. The enclosure was shared with a pair of Crested seriemas. Exhibit dimen-. sions were roughly 1 Om wide x 3m deep x Sm high. Plant material used was entirely evergreen shrubs, and ample perching was provided by suspending heavy vines across heart cedar snags buried in the ground. The front of the exhibit was covered with 1 \" x 2\" welded wire fabric. Through a doorway at one end, access was provided to a \"winter quarters\" room measuring approximately 3m x 2m x Sm. This room was heated by electric cables buried in the concrete floor and perching consisted simply of two heavy dowels. Diet for the toucans consisted of diced fresh fruit. soaked raisins, and grapes coated with insectile mix and topped with bits of Zupreme Bird of Prey diet. The toucans and seriemas coexisted well, showing very little interaction. No breeding behavior or pair bonding was noted in the toucans for the rest of 1974. In the spring of l 97S the seriemas did show an inclination to nest, and a platform was provided in the winter quarters room. By chance, a discarded \"grandfather clock\" type nest box was used to raise the platform off of the floor some 2 meters. The seriemas did in fact build a nest on this platform and subsequently laid a series of infertile eggs during the summer of 1975. The toucans still showed no breeding behavior until late October of 1975, when some aggression was noted towards one individual. By l November it was obvious that three of the four birds were openly antagonistic towards the fourth, and this bird was permanently removed from the exhibit. In December 1975 a Palmetto log (sabol palmetto) was mounted on the wall of the main exhibit opposite the winter quarters room door. An entrance hole was chiseled through the hardouter crust, but the pulpy interior of the log was left intact. During the winter of 1976 the three remaining toucans continued to interact on an apparently equal basis. On 15 March one individual was seen excavating the nest Jog, and for the next several days all three toucans were observed daily working at the entrance. On the basis of mandible size it appeared now that we had one female and two males. By the end of March a true pair bond began to evolve between the female and the Alpha male. These two assumed all the excavation chores and defended the nest log area whenever the Beta male approached. Outside of the immediate nest area the Beta male was rarely attacked, and actually was involved in mutual preening with both of the pair. By 8 April the log had been excavated to the point that either bird could fit its entire body into the opening and disappear completely from view. Now an unexpected behavior began to occur-the female was repeatedly seen entering and emerging from the grandfather clock nest box. At the same time excavation of the log continued and on 20 April both the Alpha male and the female showed aggression towards the keeper servicing the exhibit. On 30 April pieces of egg shell were found on the main exhibit floor, but at this time the source was indefinite because the seriemas were once again nesting. On 4 May a broken egg was found inside the grandfather clock nest box, thus confirming our suspicions that the female toucan was in fact producing the eggs.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Breeding Toco Toucans","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

We studied computationally C adsorption on Pd nanoclusters using an all-electron scalar relativistic density functional method. The metal particles under investigation, Pd(55), Pd(79), Pd(85), Pd(116), Pd(140), and Pd(146), were chosen as fragments of bulk Pd in the form of three-dimensional octahedral or cuboctahedral crystallites, exposing (111) and (100) facets as well as edge sites. These cluster models are shown to yield size-converged adsorption energies. We examined which surface sites of these clusters are preferentially occupied by adsorbed C. According to calculations, surface C atoms form strongly adsorbed carbide species (with adsorption energies of more than 600 kJ mol(-1)) bearing a significant negative charge. Surface sites allowing high, fourfold coordination of carbon are overall favored. To avoid effects of adsorbate-adsorbate interaction in the cluster models for carbon species in the vicinity of cluster edges, we reduced the local symmetry of selected adsorption complexes on the nanoclusters by lowering the global symmetry of the nanocluster models from point group O(h) to D(4h). On (111) facets, threefold hollow sites in the center are energetically preferred; adsorbed C is calculated to be slightly less stable when displaced to the facet borders.","inCitations":["ebbf472aaafc44adf30e69de479f17944a72b857"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Adsorption of carbon on Pd clusters of nanometer size: a first-principles theoretical study.","doi":"10.1063/1.1888385","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1063/1.1888385","venue":"The Journal of chemical physics"}

Our treatment explains why the most effective way of achieving the economically desirable aim, to make the longest polymers at the highest possible temperatures, is by maximizing the product a.D, so as to increase the TK, preferably by the use of polar solvents and initiators with large anions. The choice of such combinations by several investigators, but for other, vaguer, reasons, is given here a theoretical basis. Our argument is illustrated by Literature examples and is presented in the form of a new diagram (the Plesch-Austin plot) which shows the TK as a function of a.D for several systems. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Sin embargo, una ingesta excesiva produce determinadas patologias, como fluorosis dental y esqueletica, incluso reducciones de las capacidades cognitivas en la poblacion infantil. El objetivo de esta tesis doctoral es la evaluacion de los contenidos de fluoruro en los alimentos, su bioaccesibilidad y su absorcion por el epitelio intestinal, asi como los efectos que este elemento puede ejercer a su paso por el tracto intestinal. Se ha desarrollado una metodologia rapida para el analisis del fluoruro presente en alimentos basada en una digestion acida asistida por microondas y posterior deteccion mediante potenciometria. Esta metodologia presenta ventajas respecto a la fusion alcalina, metodo mas empleado para el analisis de fluoruro. La aplicacion de esta tecnica a muestras de un estudio de Dieta Total de la Comunidad Valenciana ha generado datos sobre concentraciones e ingestas de este elemento y ha puesto de manifiesto que los productos pesqueros y el arroz son los alimentos que realizan un mayor aporte del elemento. Esta situacion varia en poblaciones que presentan problemas de contaminacion en las aguas de consumo. Para estas comunidades, se ha evidenciado que las pastas y leguminosas aportan cantidades muy importantes de fluoruro a la dieta, similares a las de los productos pesqueros. Esto es consecuencia del proceso de cocinado con aguas con altos contenidos de fluoruro. Para una aproximacion mas realista a la estimacion del riesgo se ha analizado la cantidad de fluoruro solubilizada desde los alimentos durante la digestion gastrointestinal (bioaccesibilidad), evidenciandose que este parametro oscila entre 38-103%. La consideracion de la bioaccesibilidad reduce la exposicion al elemento respecto a los calculos en base a los contenidos del producto. Adicionalmente, se ha puesto de manifiesto que la solubilizacion gastrointestinal de fluoruro esta especialmente influenciada por el pH de la etapa gastrica y la concentracion de sales biliares de la etapa intestinal, asi como por la presencia de cationes en el proceso digestivo. El estudio de los mecanismos de absorcion intestinal de fluoruro han indicado que la via paracelular es la mayoritaria en la absorcion y secrecion de este compuesto. Asimismo, se ha evidenciado la participacion de transportadores transcelulares dependientes de pH, incluso la intervencion de mecanismos implicados en el transporte de cloruros. La elevada contribucion de la ruta paracelular ha puesto de manifiesto que el empleo de celulas Caco-2, modelo ampliamente utilizado para los estudios de biodisponibilidad, puede no ser la aproximacion mas idonea para el fluoruro. De hecho el uso de co-cultivos celulares de Caco-2 con HT29-MTX, ha mostrado resultados de permeabilidad mas proximos a los reportados in vivo. Adicionalmente, se ha evidenciado que la exposicion a fluoruro afecta al epitelio intestinal, alterando los procesos de diferenciacion celular y permeabilidad y generando una respuesta proinflamatoria. Los resultados obtenidos en la presente tesis contribuyen a incrementar el escaso conocimiento sobre la presencia de fluoruro en los alimentos y los procesos que permiten su llegada a la circulacion sistemica.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://riunet.upv.es/bitstream/handle/10251/27667/Tesis%20Doctoral%20Rene%20Rocha%20Barrasa%20v.%202.pdf;jsessionid=05FE5BD2BF7F603CD6D508041C5D5C59?sequence=1"],"title":"Fluoruro en alimentos: contenidos, bioaccesibilidad y absorción por el epitelio intestinal.","doi":"10.4995/Thesis/10251/27667","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.4995/Thesis%2F10251%2F27667","venue":""}

As a geographer, I was pleased to see that a work that was adequately illustrated with maps of two kinds: scanned, historic maps (fi ve of them) gleaned from Lass’s archival research (which were intriguing to look at, but off ered little to no additional content clarity and were diffi cult to read due to the book’s lack of color and page size), and simple line maps (ten of them) created with the help of cartographers from Minnesota State University, Mankato. Th e simplicity of these maps was their greatest attribute (the maps themselves being one of the greatest attributes of the book) helping readers visualize the proposed boundaries which Lass describes over many pages of text— those based on measurements of latitude or longitude, rivers unknown to most readers, or previously adopted state/national boundaries. As something to hold in your hand and read, what might be this book’s greatest asset is its ability to transport the reader back in time, back to the meeting rooms where government offi cials, wouldbe politicians, and even citizens stumped for one border option versus another, all while quoting the actual words spoken over a century ago— that is what makes this book a true pageturner for those with interests in historical border legacies.

The problem has been shown to be decidable but the cost is prohibitive, namely non-primitive recursive. We propose here to give up completeness. Our contribution is a new algorithm for TSO reachability: it uses the standard SC semantics and introduces the TSO semantics lazily and only where needed. At the heart of our algorithm is an iterative refinement of the program of interest. If the program's goal state is SC-reachable, we are done. If the goal state is not SC-reachable, this may be due to the fact that SC underapproximates TSO. We employ a second algorithm that determines TSO computations which are infeasible under SC, and hence likely to lead to new states. We enrich the program to emulate, under SC, these TSO computations. Altogether, this yields an iterative under-approximation that we prove sound and complete for bug hunting, i.e., a semi-decision procedure halting for positive cases of reachability.We have implemented the procedure as an extension to the tool Trencher [1] and compared it to the Memorax [2] and CBMC [14] model checkers.","inCitations":["5854ea23a1d1d054fb9510bf1bf8d24c3e5a7c3c","1f6718d33e62b7d168e32eaa727a8e13d35c746c","b7ea3d9c957d41b4f1163eb2c8c8c5dee3531cfb","7dea1e7128712282d8245e0245b695c3ef394972","20ed9039517ce062a8d20c310cee3b6528c63bca","494e3a8d7d3c18d367835fa05671286f0dabe4c7","d17707f3870b5aeabac9194fda583471a33c0712","ec324044818d2307ce3a2443e73fb48f10719627","b1e7f61bfb424af10041dbb5ee96f24370f71154","addcd5bd733f61e74b1b2f9d4fdb2ca104857f9c","a3e055e1033db1bf3442b6f808e2055f5ebb140d","4341ebc984fd461841ff84fba58780fee5392bc5","3f464e732b32eae9248c90bde628e57de565b16a"],"pdfUrls":["https://arxiv.org/pdf/1501.02683v1.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-662-46675-9_18","http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.02683","http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1501.02683"],"title":"Lazy TSO Reachability","doi":"10.1007/978-3-662-46675-9_18","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-662-46675-9_18","venue":"FASE"}

The voltage tunability of the 340 nm and 440 nm thick PZT thin films was ~34% and 5% for the 140 nm thick PZT film at 120 kV/cm and 4 GHz. The acoustic parameters of the PZT thin films under DC bias voltages were determined using a one-dimensional acoustic wave resonator model. For the PZT films of thicknesses 340 nm and 440 nm, the acoustic resonance frequency shift was about 15 MHz and the electromechanical coupling coefficient was ~10% at an electric field of 160 kV/cm. The large dielectric constant and high tunability suggest that the characterized PZT thin films may be suitable for radio frequency (RF) applications such as high-density RF MIM capacitors and other tunable devices.","inCitations":["f0a3bd66df43a72914e36f3c00bcbce924787898","e2e25262de2d6bd8e3482b2c25cbc2c4bec28469","746d5534e1b6ac6a7128d39696beb49f2121c01c"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Characterization of dielectric and acoustic properties of CSD PZT thin films at high frequencies","doi":"10.1007/s10832-011-9677-0","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10832-011-9677-0","venue":"Journal of Electroceramics"}

One of the fundamental issues in ABS is to increase the execution speed. In this paper, we identify two common modules that widely exist in ABS applications, namely, the agent management module and the agent interaction module. Improving the efficiency of these two common modules can significantly speed up the ABS execution in general. GPU architecture, programming model, and memory hierarchy are studied. Effective strategies on GPU are proposed when we design the two modules. The first contribution of this work is to propose an AgentPool data structure to handle agent creation and deletion on GPU. The second contribution is an efficient agent interaction module, which is designed by carefully utilizing the GPU memory hierarchy. To demonstrate effectiveness and generality, the proposed strategies are applied to a range of ABS applications, including game-of-life, flocking boids, prey-and-predator, and the social force-based crowd simulation. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed strategies achieve better performance than the commonly used CPU and GPU ABS framework, namely, Mason and FLAME, for ABS applications using continuous space.

However, the effect of PTPA on left ventricular (LV) function and volume remains unknown. Aims and Objectives: To evaluate whether PTPA improves biventricular cardiac functions as measured by cardiac MR (CMR). Methods: We enrolled 26 patients with inoperable CTEPH who underwent PTPA after optimal medication (female, 77.8%, median age, 62.3 years). We evaluated clinical status, pulmonary hemodynamics and CMR findings before and after the treatment. Results: No patient died during the treatment or a follow-up period. PTPA markedly improved WHO functional class (III/IV, 77.7 to 0%, P 5 , P 2 , P=0.04). Furthermore, CMR showed improvement of RV ejection fraction (39.5 to 51.0%, P 2 , P=0.03) and end-systolic volume index (68 to 42ml/m 2 , P=0.02) and increase in LVEDV index (64 to 76 ml/m 2 , P=0.004) and LVCI (2.4 to 2.8L/min/m 2 , P=0.001).

The results seem to confirm the first hypothesis. Other relationships between sighting dominance and stability of image emerged. There was a positive correlation between sighting dominance and perceptual stability in binocular vision.

Experimental results are presented for Kerosene (EXXOL D80) and tap water at room temperature. Two different measurement techniques (a high frequency impedance probe and a gamma densitometer system) were applied for measuring the volume fraction distribution across the tube and to obtain tomographic results for phase distribution. The use of the gamma densitometer system to obtain the tomographic results in liquid-liquid co-current flow is believed to be the first in this field. These methods are more precise than other techniques such as visualization and help to distinguish certain differences in flow patterns for different superficial velocities and liquid fractions. The two sets of measurements were compared and it was concluded that the gamma densitometer system was a more reliable method to measure the volume fraction. Two important phenomena in liquid-liquid flow were observed; a) Oil encapsulation by water at low mixture velocity, b) Droplets concentrated at the center of the pipe in the dispersed flow regime. Some possible explanations are given regarding these phenomena.","inCitations":["518eecc3a459f8d75458f4a62aa3511076feb5c0","5eb4914374ad25ca2d4faf97caf99ff87178f6f1","991d1bf5615b2d6ada376b1a11724cc4ba454340","fb3bf7198ff010242c7007cb2f59456852bf04f1","b93114d207dd195502c805e6597ff0552454ea16"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Spatial Distribution of Oil and Water in Horizontal Pipe Flow","doi":"10.2118/56524-MS","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.2118/56524-MS","venue":""}

Conceptual ideas underlying general relativity are explained and its physical ramifications summarized in general terms, without recourse to advanced mathematics. This theory is perhaps the most sublime creation of the human mind. Nonetheless, it has become increasingly clear that it too has serious limitations which can be overcome only through another dramatic revision of our notions of space and time.

Over 15 % of the nation’s children experience neurodevelopmental disabilities or special health care needs and estimates suggest 1 in every 68 children is diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder. Across the Unites States critical shortages of qualified MCH professionals exist, particularly in poor and rural areas. A continued investment in training interdisciplinary leaders is critical. The MCH Leadership Competencies provide an effective foundation for leadership training through identification of requisite knowledge, skills, and dispositions required of MCH leaders. This paper describes a three-step process, which began in 2010 and included utilizing the MCH Leadership Competencies as a tool to reflect on, develop, and evaluate the NH LEND leadership curriculum. Curriculum development was further supported through participation in a multi-state learning collaborative. Through a series of intentional decisions, the curriculum design of NH LEND utilized the competencies and evidence-based principles of instruction to engage trainees in the development of specific MCH content knowledge and leadership skills. The LEND network specifically, and MCH leadership programs more broadly, may benefit from the intentional use of the MCH competencies to assist in curriculum development and program evaluation, and as a means to support trainees in identifying specific leadership goals and evaluating their leadership skill development.","inCitations":["230d7df31b9f3fb3073a1f30cf8d3e7fec7695ae","76c212a6405f9e480232a8727de33f93e7a5e938","7afaeba21592cd54200158cd521e1f0f7d97bd86","33f4827a9f2a157d696f341f582d791e96b6c50a"],"pdfUrls":["https://works.bepress.com/betsy_humphreys/5/download/"],"title":"Transforming LEND Leadership Training Curriculum through the Maternal and Child Health Leadership Competencies","doi":"10.1007/s10995-014-1587-8","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10995-014-1587-8","venue":"Maternal and Child Health Journal"}

Catatonia seems more frequently associated to mood disorders as well as general medical conditions. It is sometimes difficult to associate formally a medical etiology to this syndrome. But we found, in the literature, three groups of associated general medical conditions: neurological disorders, drug induced and toxic induced conditions, metabolic conditions. We present a prospective study of 12 clinical cases of catatonia due to general medical conditions we realized in the Consultation-Liaison Psychiatry Department of the University Hospital of LILLE (France) during a period of 5 months. We find coherent data with the literature. However, our results suggest that if medical conditions precipitate the catatonia syndrome, they are rarely its only etiology. We think that if somatic factors are co-morbid with psychiatric conditions they do not necessarily predominate as the target of treatment. The treatment of the catatonia must be a priority and remain symptomatic, to allow in parallel the specific treatment for the somatic disorder or the psychiatric disorder.","inCitations":["649c0fcbd3b5068e4cf897aaac2caf5612eed419","b98cd761f60ab2874494f50fb5cf4e0000153d81","0f15d5ee7e5725ce58975bb3dc5f0d5f5f242c71","cb368cf3c9e353a42cc96665298a0b8a3393eb69","5bdd1c42bcd4a59b49cabd6df396506d9de56737","52881c8aa8e9ae9667617f1c2066e4afa357cd21","95a23df97e2bd15e88470b03061f5779d78fabe2","fbadf6a484bb70a4b3acd4721cd2bd6a19643ea1","ccefa0698d4c277dbe805c17384bd31b057e92dd","1e3e8035ad9f5377f746901939f3e6ba9c9a7936","540042fd73b9a070f5f102ff1ca4c5daefad55aa","9990dac055ea67008ded40f3573eef03dd490277","ce89ae04b38c3a11260dc7d124178ccf94303dce","ff345c72fe441ee68c4f4b50d6d7d54b4e2bd01c","92020a717e5880bfd5af17d48f09c35a3f37c1cd","0365fbdd01c9c83b8d25ba885ca83d0ae3d2e07e","df308320846370b55bab78904083c0a3d380e32e","8e187be6016b009c0517be11d5d594e58894c23a","421a839c898fb0000c2e15c960e4aa02a0b5c97b","670dbccfdf6c05048801f8bb8313038fc56b9391","580004a5f7662861a27d6f5da0edec463aeeb5eb","967d37e9754f21a76b51e5d0d46523c643e3fe58","ba1bd208cb889a7e1ed4e00d89524ded79aad5ee","39615febcc8609f2421fe90b0ccde82f099acd95"],"pdfUrls":["https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0278584607001376","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0278584607001376?dgcid=api_sd_search-api-endpoint"],"title":"Catatonia and consultation-liaison psychiatry study of 12 cases","doi":"10.1016/j.pnpbp.2007.04.006","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pnpbp.2007.04.006","venue":"Progress in Neuro-Psychopharmacology and Biological Psychiatry"}

A irrigacao publica no semiarido brasileiro tem gerado como subproduto a degradacao dos solos por sais, formando um passivo ambiental, cuja responsabilidade legal da reversao e do poder publico. Para quantificar a extensao e o custo da reversao do dano ambiental, inicialmente, aplicou-se um questionario aos agricultores irrigantes para analisar o significado que eles dao aos problemas relacionados com a irrigacao, com a agua de irrigacao e com a degradacao dos solos. Posteriormente, utilizou-se um sensor de inducao eletromagnetica para medir a condutividade eletrica no solo, estimando-se o total de sais soluveis em sua solucao. Os valores da condutividade eletrica aferidos pelo sensor nortearam a coleta de amostras de solo para fins de analise fisica e quimica, procedendo-se a identificacao das areas degradadas por sais. Com a definicao da extensao dos danos ambientais, levantaram-se os valores de produtividade das principais culturas e o valor bruto da producao agricola, para aferir os custos da reversao do passivo ambiental. Os resultados demonstraram uma hipossuficiencia financeira e tecnica dos agricultores irrigantes; que a degradacao ambiental por sais atinge 67,27% da area do perimetro irrigado. Conclui-se que, em decorrencia dos aspectos de solidariedade, a responsabilidade civil objetiva na reparacao do dano ambiental provocado pela irrigacao e do poder publico.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Avaliação do passivo ambiental de solos degradados por sais no perímetro irrigado Curu Pentecoste, Ceará","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}
