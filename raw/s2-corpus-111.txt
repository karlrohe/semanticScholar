We did comparative assessments using conventional radioimmunotherapy targeting CD20, CD22, and HLA-DR on human Ramos, Raji, and FL-18 lymphoma xenografts in athymic mice to assess the potential for improving the efficacy of radioimmunotherapy by targeting other NHL cell surface antigens. Results of biodistribution studies showed significant differences in tumor localization consistent with variable antigenic expression on the different lymphoma cell lines. Interestingly, the radioimmunoconjugate that yielded the best tumor-to-normal organ ratios differed in each tumor model. We also explored administering all three (111)In-1,4,7,10-tetra-azacylododecane N,N',N'',N'''-tetraacetic acid antibodies in combination, but discovered, surprisingly, that this approach did not augment the localization of radioactivity to tumors compared with the administration of the best single radiolabeled Ab alone. These data suggest that conventional radioimmunotherapy using anti-CD20, anti-HLA-DR, or anti-CD22 Abs is effective when used singly and provides targeted uptake of radiolabel into the tumor that is dependent on the levels of antigen expression. Improvements in tumor-to-normal organ ratios of radioactivity cannot be achieved using directly labeled Abs in combination but may be afforded by novel pretargeting methods.","inCitations":["1f654c9c5150b3b76b4ebe4e8fb6982dc94d0a4b","6a1d6b4cea35a21c1c691239f35c867ea523bb0b","aae378e74d9a6c1bceff66a34a097e30a2d7b794","e189fccf4611b71979f87c73ab265789b648cb34","d2867600d2172e319bb4fb39afc909a38135b1d9","376f3d1ffaf71034d0a50e5cb40b9e5bba7a9484","2ff6f16d403c4cee454cc99f79a43253deac55cb","c69a6150d8f3d2a4a259a919d93412c9b092daaa","fa7c1a3704ba74a60533624e0cbcc41618ae29b6","dc56be376a8c8ca04703f00c210e55b0db3a5af8","d0cb7054773a92e2be30a5af50affc3f48ecbc6d","d31b385b9c456046a9e89e7594258bf7a1a1a2b0","8010fb0a3715d01b5dd31e5be0463a9ef6372f46","b2e929e69c4cf91b07b8cbb77fc834a36e954ec8","db96366000e6579810f77649dd3503e610dd171b","9ace8292ab80a0c8c633facea1061fc24162568d","cfc03e7e6e9d4509cc91fd076446d8450b1f89f9","d0347fd93556b1f5238d9906f2298397c872b2ea","1e505898a2ca74f2a29b2493ff3cc9ee73c8e97e"],"pdfUrls":["http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/canres/67/12/5921.full.pdf"],"title":"Evaluation of CD20, CD22, and HLA-DR targeting for radioimmunotherapy of B-cell lymphomas.","doi":"10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-07-0080","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-07-0080","venue":"Cancer research"}

AF causes lowered growth rate, stress, and increased mortality in the poultry, especially for broiler industries. The aims of this study are to determine the effects of Sauropus androgynus (L.) Merr. leaf powder (SAP) in the chickens fed a diet naturally contaminated with AF. A total of 108 chickens are divided into 6 group: group I fed with basal diet (AF not detectable); group II fed with basal diet (AF not detectable) + 5% SAP; group III with AF (>1 ppb <50 ppb); group IV with AF (>1 ppb <50 ppb) + 5% SAP; group V with AF (>51 ppb <100 ppb) + 5% SAP; group VI with AF (>101 ppb <150 ppb) + 5% SAP. The data of the body weight, feed intake and efficiency, the relative weight of liver, kidney, spleen, bursa of Fabricius (BF), histopathology, haematological profile, haemagglutination inhibition (HI) titer, AF residue, and immunohistochemistry are collected on days 7, 14, and 21. All the data were analysed using SPSS 16. The supplementation of 5% SAP in the chickens fed a diet naturally contaminated with AF showed the potential effects of the body weight performance, haematological profile protection, increase in the cellular and humoral immune responses, reduction of AF residue in the organ, protection of liver, kidney, spleen, and BF histopathology, and increase in the immune-expression of CD4+/CD8+ lymphocytes ratio (P < 0.05). It shows that 5% SAP can be used as the alternative herbal supplementation to depress the impacts of aflatoxicosis in the broiler chickens.","inCitations":["ed445332b991a53e1b29608237bcbb71f3c872d7","6974bbc6c8c96ea459c775b17ee1e1e0defcd619"],"pdfUrls":["http://downloads.hindawi.com/journals/jt/2018/2069073.pdf"],"title":"The Role of Sauropus androgynus (L.)

Range prediction solutions are available to address anxiety but most of them have limited functionalities. In this paper we propose a new, “Accurate Range” and “Energy-efficient Route” (ARER) selection mobile software solution which is based on smartphone platform. The proposed solution provides several attractive features. The first and prime feature is estimation of the most accurate driving range considering those real time factors that were never considered in the prior art such as geographical terrain of the driving route (Elevation and Depression), real time alert implemented on the road (i.e. the road flood clogged or blocked due to catastrophe - such information would be received through PLAN (Personal Localized Alerting Network), a new public safety system that FCC and FEMA are working on currently that will enable government officials to send emergency text alerts, such as tornados, floods, terrorisms, to specific affected geographic areas through cell towers in near future), Real Time Wind Speed (tailwind and headwind), real time weight in the EV (onboard Passengers and Cargo), and real time traffic (including not only on road vehicles, but also STOP signs, advisory road signs, and probability of encountering red traffic lights, etc.), comparing with available battery energy. The second key feature that leverages on the first one is proposing the alternate route(s) that may not be essentially shorter but the most energy efficient (e.g. the route with depression instead of elevation and at the same time not flood clogged or blocked, the route with favorable wind direction at that instant and location, the route with lesser traffic congestion, fewer stop signs and fewer red traffic light etc.). The third feature is to evaluate the service relevance and suggest the point of service; offering similar services, that fall on the most energy efficient route (e.g. if the EV Driver searched for Rite-Aid Pharmacy, the software may also suggest the WalGreens or Wall Mart, or Target, or Shoprite, because of service relevance/similar service offering and occurrence on the most energy efficient route from the EV Driver's current location). The fourth feature is that it keeps the history of the roads traversed and uses the log data for future optimization. Lastly the fifth feature is that it produces a visual 360-degree real time range display, and calculates the estimated energy cost of completing a chosen rout. The software to make prototype for the work is under development.","inCitations":["f24eeeda8bda63547cce1feecc20e3b5da5adbcd","0d48cab808b69466f3325163d6c9c354e0b8c824","1df849a3c228eb51b6dcfefe3ee52ee2957b1b97","46baac1e0f338597d0ee4e81b62bf3a7f805b3df","1e9db2b11f557329a27138a9d5339dd1a170ce08"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Smartphone-based accurate range and energy efficient route selection for electric vehicle","doi":"10.1109/IEVC.2012.6183293","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEVC.2012.6183293","venue":"2012 IEEE International Electric Vehicle Conference"}

The basic immunological mechanisms operative in GVHD are largely similar in these three species and in human patients, although the patterns of GVHD in the three animal species show differences. The predictive value for clinical GVHD of the results obtained in the different animals species is analysed for the three main variables: namely, histocompatibility, T cell numbers in the graft and the intestinal microflora. Rhesus monkeys score highest as regards clinical relevance for the first two variables. With regards to the unravelling of detailed mechanisms of the influence of the microflora, none of the three animal species is likely to provide the information needed for identification of the bacterial species involved in the induction of GVHD in human patients.","inCitations":["53ca4826251bd3c59aa9d9b7ff593b5269aaec52","ddb26b441ca77dfcfe2d043a05c57c9f2d3fb737","1a90adcad53db1c71864d0f710e65a46c98bcf59","2b7a2a3ed60f056c71ee8bd25f43452fde714118","3494d8c7113ff0466a9c3f669b062b67903c6f7e","c1056d16946e9be74207e036ec28bda44f829587","e4737dac11b66a86d13a4b04f2a755e8f2de11cc","e387abcd780d02aedf8ed09af708b30d7360a98a"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Biology of acute and chronic graft-versus-host reactions: predictive value of studies in experimental animals.","doi":"","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"Bone marrow transplantation"}

In this paper we generalise previously obtained results in three directions. Firstly, we allow for the presence of non-linear portfolios. Secondly, based on the concept of correlation order (Dhaene and Goovaerts, 1996) we proceed with discussing the links between dependence structures, capital allocation and pricing, as well as dropping a restrictive assumption on the continuity of probability distributions. Finally, we generalise the capital allocation methodology to a dynamic setting and conclude with a numerical example.","inCitations":["ec0f3c815b61206e1211f4b3aa268dd703d37993","4140b0397e619ed87d0d348f6747ac6da76b1742","945fe7fd1e3b94cdf7a0552207149088ba054953","1d92f633eb50c1df765c2dbd20a9ae0f1914c43b","f6972e4a810835a2b5834177f1bc4bde10937a9e","00d3d30343d968461fe7e7dfd9b66d7b5b659032","e164c271ad1a5c2c05a1295520580e38b50a2e49","d3e4e390075275693190f971ebae01fbea1311f4","6516c99ce206bfa245d3d763f0274f3d8d15e8f3","866fb6fc82a61db17edf2ede049f676487b28211","14537a65f778b781b2b3b0dd456b863ccb9b2467","a2f285d6652a4a802bb36cc59233d38ee1c34329","d12b3455953860916b64f8e3e4d26cbc3d410839","73f28d1181880f16ff449fe18c615b142ad762ba","3a577ef5d1ff87eae1389589f5c20b89627d30fb","2c42f342eea8ef257006fc18acc3d8dbdf913f50","42f1f6f62f744bfe7542660cfa0b5947764817b6","ba9d6645047044bdb7cae169742cc1f51b906946","7e3f468188377abd2a9fc98ebb0bade0bd7aa5a1","e258f4a31cae14082136959f51b2139f0838ae0a","2ac6f6087c6e68f10de57c51c4d616012330e83d","59694d503aab6b6691ba51d4da68b90aa073c760","7df716ee62d27a59c63b3fe2d5ce650421d17fdf","0f1c085af3f345df31f145a02ac6effc1cbf6ac6","52d873bee5eba599670e0c586aa278080cecefed","0529bc6f2b1e9e789483c1e208446bbd8245a871","19244433722d8480cfea60b556853a95b89d9875","dd18a12fdd4f56401f01579a372e8a00e1043042","de93830d9f052ab73a408f85369ef8e9946cde4b","9b38dc861da1a8d8fd3fe0bd1524718cf27fc2e1","145d1e2d392533fcf5447367ddb0c98095f2c64d","f968e0ebc9705371ba8bff37b9b3b718da66a046","9b4ca58268f24af22d0ec908b013623bd14f9a9d","68651a9a1a8f854e0ba8c95c0b89cc9be85c67f6","f0be0767dcc5e2117aeac5c57da957de70b73c6e","6bf991c0dd56145b17f9995a3b4f4f73dad22de8","1351390d06fcb7459ea7b974c52b256d4a4abbbf"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Dynamic capital allocation with distortion risk measures","doi":"10.1016/j.insmatheco.2003.09.005","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.insmatheco.2003.09.005","venue":""}

However, the maintenance of its long-term results has been little studied in the literature. Objective: To assess the maintenance of the results of extended cervicoplasty in the long-term. Methods: Twenty-three patients with severe tissue sagging underwent extended cervicoplasty, having been followed up for five years. The postoperative results in the first and fifth year were evaluated by 8 plastic surgeons. The analysis of the results was performed using the McNemar and paired t-student tests. Results: In the first year, 12 (52.2%) patients had the outcome rated as very good, 9 (39.1%) as moderate and 2 (8.7%) as poor. In the fifth year, 9 (39.1%) had the outcome classified as very good, 11 (47.8%) as moderate and 3 (13.1%) as poor. None of the patients had the outcome rated as excellent or bad in any of the analyzed periods.

The protein possesses several functional domains including a unique bioactive 40-41 amino acid sequence at the extracellular terminus. Synthetic versions of this teneurin C-terminal-associated peptide (TCAP) can modulate cyclic AMP accumulation, cell proliferation and teneurin mRNA levels in vitro. Furthermore, i.c.v. injections of TCAP-1 into rat brain induce major changes in acoustic startle response behavior 3 weeks after administration, suggesting that the peptide may act to alter interneuron communication via changes in neurite and axon outgrowth. Synthetic mouse/rat TCAP-1 was used to treat cultured immortalized mouse hypothalamic cells, to determine if TCAP-1 could directly regulate neurite and axon growth. TCAP-1-treated cells showed a significant increase in the length of neurites accompanied by a marked increase in beta-tubulin transcription and translation as determined by real-time PCR and Western blot analysis, respectively. Changes in alpha-actinin-4 transcription and beta-actin protein expression were also noted. Immunofluorescence confocal microscopy using beta-tubulin antiserum showed enhanced resolution of beta-tubulin cytoskeletal elements throughout the cell. In order to determine if the effects of TCAP-1 could be reproduced in primary neuronal cultures, primary cultures of E18 rat hippocampal cells were treated with 100 nM TCAP-1. The TCAP-1-treated hippocampal cultures showed a significant increase in both the number of cells, dendritic branching and the presence of large and fasciculated beta-tubulin immunoreactive axons. These data suggest that TCAP acts, in part, as a functional region of the teneurins to regulate neurite and axonal growth of neurons.","inCitations":["a5cc37d70f0c46a89e0841bf7d4e0b723777f5e3","40271ffc23008be0c38bb6c9c73b465653fcbeb5","333ca5063b55b224eb22daf30eaaa65efc6e51f5","96013bd0b79c1c05844381e55a7ea4256b33d755","93fb50d6410a667dd68dd330a2f08755af8e9c50","143ce8d4b91ecc830ddb72a88010b056c05b94f2","4f33f6319d966b0594457e8b2a52079defcee290","55cccfebe7fdbdd2a867a1cedf53c1f9a4cd3df0","5b379f6d7ea12f1f5018cacf34d1c21b9df06751","80f7028900db0cc2ba705f71d1c90420878475c6","6bf86601be44062b16291c1fc6e61787f2dc2b0c","ac4a90ccdba3be14bb9bc63ac1934408a61cbce9","3c400edc17c1857f45457e7c4e2d4030b52c70f5","1e78655c7810d105dcdf49fa1b32d1d5589da8c4","ecd0e938def0dc5d861a002fa3e181852af4e6ed","13b48a6fc0d309dec8ce94ad4990478eaf3818ed","9d252e55dc56bc9848f2d52d20d2b2ce292b15cc","62f763cadc3847eee87241a71045a29324b4196e","1ba6c42e88a33b057e4b1f4afed2052fcb47cc67","dac7c7036a8ed650879490dd715b028846923764","a1eac1c04547de92307382ea503c74fe4c909164","71a90866b5d949cef4c1e0919c8ea7530f81f411","8cf6adec034cc82f221636ab0241feb3ed39827b","40b4b5eafec0b991310f2df2d0664dc8ebd9f432","fd48e4bc01b3302af515228e8115970b1085320b","c6761fc27ef773d74d68b4acef77aa8a8d5fc433","2cd4e788059bfebd2f95953b4cc26c8b04af34f2","9c19413a39e6c3b487c47c2d51e0b160392cb771","7e1c305879bfb7c1241fe841bbc1fcce4cb9b44b","0596aba70027e4ae0285e90cec737d4b5dd58782"],"pdfUrls":["https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0306452206013157","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306452206013157?dgcid=api_sd_search-api-endpoint"],"title":"Regulation of neurite growth in immortalized mouse hypothalamic neurons and rat hippocampal primary cultures by teneurin C-terminal-associated peptide-1","doi":"10.1016/j.neuroscience.2006.09.062","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroscience.2006.09.062","venue":"Neuroscience"}

Weniger dramatisch und bisher weniger eindeutig verläuft die Rechtsfortbildung im Innenrecht der Personengesellschaften. Die hierauf bezogene Rechtsprechung kommt vergleichsweise unauffällig daher. Mit dem „Otto“-Urteil vom 15.

It was established that a peak in the photoelectron spectra observed at an energy above the valence band top of ferroelectric Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 in ion-etched samples was due to oxygen vacancies. A method for evaluating the oxygen vacancies concentration in the material from the comparison of experimental and theoretical photoelectron spectra of the valence band is proposed. It is found that oxygen polyvacancies are not formed in ferroelectric Hf0.5Zr0.5O2: an energy-favorable spatial arrangement of several oxygen vacancies in the crystal corresponds to the configuration formed by noninteracting vacancies distant from each other. The oxygen vacancies in five charged states were simulated. The electron levels in the bandgap caused by charged oxygen vacancies indicate that any type of oxygen vacancies in ferroelectric Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 can capture both electrons and holes, i.e. can act as an amphoteric localization center for charge carriers.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Electronic structure of stoichiometric and oxygen-deficient ferroelectric Hf0.5Zr0.5O2.","doi":"10.1088/1361-6528/aaacb1","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1088/1361-6528%2Faaacb1","venue":"Nanotechnology"}

We test whether firm-level corporate governance provisions matter in an emerging market setting characterised by weak legal enforcement and inadequate external discipline by the market for corporate control. Our results cast doubt on the notion that a higher ratio of non-executive members is associated with lower earnings management. We find that the effect of board independence on earnings management practices is contingent on the levels of ownership held by executive directors and large shareholders, as well as the composition of audit committee. In addition, the results are consistent with the view that high-quality auditors are effective in reducing earnings management.

Сеченова РОСЗДРАВА, кафедра клинической фармакологии и пропедевтики внутренних болезней лечебного факультета, г. Москва В проведенном исследовании оценивалась эффективность комбинированной антигипертензивной терапии эналаприлом, валсартаном, алискиреном и индапамидом. Максимальная эффективность наблюдалась в группе пациентов, получавших валсартан 160 мг или алискирен 300 мг и индапамид 1,5 мг. Ключевые слова: артериальная гипертония, валсартан, эналаприл, алискирен Результаты исследований последних десятилетий свидетельствуют о большом значении повышения активности ренин-ангиотензин-альдостероновой системы (РААС) в формировании и прогрессировании артериальной гипертензии (АГ) и повреждению органов-мишеней, развитию нефропатии, ремоделирования сердца и сосудов. В настоящее время препараты, влияющие на звенья РААС, такие как ингибиторы ангиотензинпревращающего фермента, блокаторы рецепторов ангиотензина, бетаадреноблокаторы, диуретики, занимают важное место в терапии АГ. В настоящее время прошел клинические исследования и зарегистрирован во многих странах мира, в том числе и в РФ, первый селективный ингибитор ренина, обладающий выраженной активностью – алискирен (торговое название Расилез, Новартис Фарма). Целью исследования было изучение терапевтической эффективности применения эналапила, валсартана, алискирена и индапамида у пациентов с АГ II-III степенью. Материалы и методы. В исследование были включены 62 пациента (24 женщины и 38 мужчин) в возрасте от 45 до 70 лет с АГ II-III степени. Пациентам назначался эналаприл в дозе 20 мг в сутки или валсартан в дозе 160 мг в сутки или алискирен в дозе 300 мг в сутки в комбинации с пролонгированной формой индапамида 1,5 мг. Время наблюдения составило 16 недель. Показатели гипотензивной эффективности и безопасности оценивались клинически, а также по данным офисного измерения и суточного мониторирования АД. Результаты и их обсуждение. В группе пациентов, получавших эналаприл 20 мг и индапамид 1,5 мг через 16 недель было отмечено снижение САД на 14,6+1,2 мм рт.ст., в группе, получавших валсартан 160 мг и индапамид 1,5 мг было отмечено снижение САД на 17,5+1,6 мм рт.ст., в группе пациентов, получавших 300 мг алискирена и 1,5 мг индапамида снижение САД составило 18,0+1,7 мм рт.ст. (р<0,05). В группе пациентов, получавших эналаприл 20 мг и индапамид 1,5 мг через 16 недель снижение ДАД составило 8,2+0,8 мм рт.ст., в группе пациентов, получавших валсартан 160 мг и индапамид 1,5 мг было отмечено снижение ДАД на 8,9+0,6 мм рт.ст., у пациентов, получавших 300 мг алискирена и 1,5 мг индапамида снижение ДАД составило 10,1+1,0 мм рт.ст. (р<0,05). Все пациенты положительно оценивали переносимость терапии. Серьезных побочных эффектов отмечено не было. Вывод: Терапия алискиреном в дозе 300 мг оказывала гипотензивный эффект, сопоставимый с эффектом валсартана в дозе 160 мг, но была более эффективной, чем терапия эналаприлом у больных АГ II-IIIстепени. Следовательно, в качестве антигипертензивной терапии у пациентов с АГ II-III степени наиболее целесообразно использовать комбинированную терапию на основе валсартана или алискирена. ЛИТЕРАТУРА 1.

In elucidating the corresponding images in his autobiographical and philosophical works, the book attends especially to the hidden and intimate dimensions of the self. As a psychoanalytic thinker, Rousseau propounds the internal retrieval of instincts as the psychological basis of his democratic republic. As a philosopher of intimacy, he stresses the importance of intimate relations and private sentiments in building community bonds. Themes of .instinct. and .intimacy. are explicated through considering his simultaneous reflection and transcendence of three psycho-cultural dichotomies: masculine and feminine, separation and oneness, and good and evil. In keeping with Rousseau's insistence on the unity of his person and his philosophy, these larger dichotomies are illuminated by uncovering the personal origins of his philosophy through his autobiographies. By analysing how the totality of his psyche imprints on his philosophy, this study traces the role of his powerful, primordial vision in establishing his deep political engagement, individualism, and democratic commitment.","inCitations":["976f2f120c50d078104657f3b4d22958adda2de8","2c9fb8ea81f333ad638fbc31b02668ac32229a18","790887c2b9aaaf5539b9fb83a62d3a781531b36f"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Instinct and Intimacy: Political Philosophy and Autobiography in Rousseau","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Concentrations above 5 × 10−5M capillarol stimulated the root growth of rice (Oryza sativa L. cv. Tanginbozu and cv. Nihonbare) seedlings to about 180% of the control value at 5 × 10−4M. Capillarol had no promotive and hardly any inhibitory effect on the growth of the second leaf sheath. Capillarol promoted the root growth also in seedlings of lettuce (Lactuca sativa L. cv. Grand Rapids) to ca 150% of the control value at 5 × 10−4M. The free acid form of capillarol (capillaric acid) was about as effective as capillarol. Para-hydroxy- but not m-methoxy- substituted cinnamic acid, phenylpyruvic acid, phenylacetic acid and amino-hydrocinnamic acid could stimulate root growth, but p-hydroxybenzoic acid was inactive. It is concluded that the important structural requirements for high root growth-promoting activity of phenolic compounds are the hydroxyl group substitution at the C-4 position of the benzene ring, and the propanoic or propenoic acid side chain at the C-1 position. A possible mode of the action of capillarol on root growth-promoting activity is also discussed.","inCitations":["700ad1f13eced654f8a8f2473ece7b3c1afcbf95","9f4078acb9a32d08488c011d99e1339c1a4b3715","977af14e4d6d7d916810c8b8af86d2e5f6adfab1","fdfd986accbf63f77b0723dacd56163ee00f40bb"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Promotive effect of capillarol and related compounds on root growth","doi":"10.1111/j.1399-3054.1989.tb05450.x","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1399-3054.1989.tb05450.x","venue":""}

Tel: (886)2-87927374, Fax: (886)287927217, E-mail: wshuang@ndmctsgh.edu.tw Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common malignancies worldwide, particularly with a relatively higher incidence rate of more than 20 to 150 per 100,000 per year in certain Asian and African areas [1]. Despite that numerous etiological factors or cofactors for HCC have been proposed; three common predisposing factors are largely established and well recognized: hepatitis B carrier, hepatitis C carrier and alcohol consumption. Their attributing fractions vary in different areas and, for example, hepatitis B virus causes approximate 60% of HCC in Asian area but in west countries hepatitis C virus seems to play a more important part to cause HCC [2]. The clinical presentations of HCC, whatever the etiology, are similar and mainly result from invasiveness of tumor itself and its concomitant or consequential problems of derangement in hepatic function. Different from most malignancies, tissue biopsy is rarely required for diagnosis based on evidence revealing a high risk of tumor spreading along the needle tract, rendering the potentially operable HCC not necessarily subjected to biopsy for tissue proof prior to surgical intervention [3]. Instead, the diagnostic work-ups could rely on imaging studies and, partly, serum assay, in addition to physical examination and detailed history taking [4,5]. For example, if the lesion is identified in a single imaging modality with the presence of a serum fetoprotein (AFP) level 400 ng/ml is considered diagnostic of HCC in the setting of cirrhosis. For imaging studies of HCC, there are three aims: differentiation of HCC from non-cancerous tissues, staging of HCC and surveillance of patients with known HCC. Conventional radiographic studies include ultrasound (US), computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are usually adopted, but sometimes with limited usefulness because of their anatomy-based and/or regionally cross-section approach. It is particularly true when the hepatic lesions are not “typical” HCC or too small to define their characteristics. As novel diagnostic modality such as positron emission tomography (PET) of whole body has been successfully utilized to detect a variety of malignancies, there is a hope to use PET imaging to augment the diagnostic role of imaging in HCC.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://www.snm.org.tw/revista2006/2006-08/journal9409/pdf/v19n1/AnnNuclMedSci06-19-1(Shen-1).pdf"],"title":"Current Status of Imaging Diagnosis for Hepatocellular Carcinoma: From Anatomical to Molecular Approach","doi":"10.6332/ANMS.1901.001","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.6332/ANMS.1901.001","venue":""}

In patients with head and neck (H&N) cancer, SPTs principally occur in the H&N region, lungs or esophagus. Therefore, patient follow-up after cancer treatment is important in order to detect recurrence, metastasis and new primary tumors. However, no standard guidelines on lifelong follow-up imaging are available. Herein, we report a patient who presented with three metachronous primary tumors-squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the tongue, SCC of the lip and type A thymoma. The third tumor was incidentally detected during follow-up using contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) 9 years following resection of the second tumor. To the best of our knowledge, this specific combination of metachronous tumors has not yet been reported. Based on the literature review, we observed that thymoma occurs following H&N cancer treatment. Therefore, to ensure that the presence of subsequent thymomas is not overlooked, we suggest regular lifelong follow-up using contrast-enhanced CT in patients who had previously been diagnosed with H&N cancer. The literature review revealed that thymomas occur in patients with H&N cancer and should be detected at the earliest convenience.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://www.spandidos-publications.com/ol/18/3/2777/download"],"title":"Thymoma appearing 9 years after the resection of squamous cell carcinoma of the lip: A case report of triple primary tumors and literature review","doi":"10.3892/ol.2019.10675","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.3892/ol.2019.10675","venue":"Oncology letters"}

Association mapping identifies quantitative trait loci (QTL) based on the strength of linkage disequilibrium (LD) between markers and functional polymorphisms across a set of diverse germplasms. In this study, we used association mapping to detect QTL and genome-wide simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers linked to seed coat colour and oil content in a population of 217 oilseed rape (Brassica napus L.) accessions. We corrected for the population structure of B. napus using 389 genome-wide SSR markers. In total, 25 and 11 SSR markers linked to seed coat colour and oil content were detected, respectively, and these two sets of markers were in different linkage groups. Nine of these markers for seed coat colour spanned the major QTL regio...","inCitations":["012e7ba56cbad72edf02fb778f138167d2e1a93f","b8c417d7e1809e9a0eff684abf28764bdc54c2f9","af3ff371b8b6575833eadcae5df6a7063fab0048","d62df0b39787259b5c4279e89bf6b05eefec2553"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Identification of QTL for seed coat colour and oil content in Brassica napus by association mapping using SSR markers","doi":"10.4141/cjps2013-411","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.4141/cjps2013-411","venue":""}

Such information is applicable both to furthering our understanding of fundamental biology and to developing new diagnostic and treatment approaches for diseases. However, novel mathematical methods are needed for extracting biological knowledge from high-dimensional, complex and noisy data sources. In this thesis, I develop and apply three novel computational approaches for this task. The common theme of these approaches is that they seek to discover meaningful groups of genes, which confer robustness to noise and compress complex information into interpretable models. I first present the GRAM algorithm, which fuses information from genome-wide expression and in vivo transcription factor-DNA binding data to discover regulatory networks of gene modules. I use the GRAM algorithm to discover regulatory networks in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, including rich media, rapamycin, and cell-cycle module networks. I use functional annotation databases, independent biological experiments and DNA-motif information to validate the discovered networks, and to show that they yield new biological insights. Second, I present GeneProgram, a framework based on Hierarchical Dirichlet Processes, which uses large compendia of mammalian expression data to simultaneously organize genes into overlapping programs and tissues into groups to produce maps of expression programs. I demonstrate that GeneProgram outperforms several popular analysis methods, and using mouse and human expression data, show that it automatically constructs a comprehensive, body-wide map of inter-species expression programs. Finally, I present an extension of GeneProgram that models temporal dynamics. I apply the algorithm to a compendium of short time-series gene expression experiments in which human cells were exposed to various infectious agents. I show that discovered expression programs exhibit temporal pattern usage differences corresponding to classes of host cells and infectious agents, and describe several programs that implicate surprising signaling pathways and receptor types in human responses to infection.

We also outline how we can extend our analysis to handle measure phrases that do not co-occur with of-phrases by treating these measure phrases as anaphoric, an analysis that can adapt to the anaphoric constructions in classifier languages. Such an analysis does not only come closer to the intuition of native speakers but also have an appeal from the perspective of the universality of languages.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://web.stanford.edu/group/cslipublications/cslipublications/HPSG/2008/tam-sato.pdf"],"title":"An Analysis of Pseudopartitives and Measure Phrases that Say No to Extra Rules","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

A 21-year-old male patient was admitted to our hospital with fatigue, weight loss, and abdominal pain for 4 months. Physical examination, complete blood count, andbiochemical parameters were unremarkable. Dynamic contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen was performed. A heterogeneous well-defined hyperdense nodular lesion 3 cm in diameter was detected during the arterial phase. The detected lesion was seen as isodense with the spleen parenchyma during the portal venous and late venous phases. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed an isointense-hypointense nodular lesion on T1- and T2-weighted images. Intraabdominal LAM or splenomegaly was not detected. Microscopically, it was composed of angiomatoid nodules separated by central stellate fibrous stroma and fibrous septa. The contrast enhancement pattern was described as centrally hypovascular, radially progressive centripetal vascular contrast enhancement, called a spoke-wheel pattern in previously reported cases.

We hypothesized that submaximal effort does not produce a linear torque-velocity relationship because replicating a submaximal isotonic contraction requires an enormous amount of proprioceptive feedback and the nervous system may not be able to accurately replicate both force and speed of contraction. If this hypothesis is true, the torque-velocity test of the BTE-Primus would be an effective method for assessing sincerity of effort. The purpose of this study was to examine if differences exist in the linear torque-velocity relationship between maximal and submaximal grip strength effort. Due to the fact that a test is not valid unless it is reliable, an additional purpose was to calculate the test-retest reliability of velocity during isotonic contraction using the torque-velocity test of the BTE-Primus' grip tool. Participants included 32 healthy, right-hand dominant (16 male, 16 female) persons, aged 20-50 years (mean age 25+/-8.0), with no history of upper-extremity injury. The subjects participated in two days of grip-strength testing (approximately two weeks apart) and were instructed to exert maximal effort with both hands on one day, and to feign injury with one hand on the other day. Each day included two sessions of testing, which consisted of performing the \"torque-velocity test\" on the BTE-Primus grip attachment (#162). We randomly assigned the feigning hand (dominant vs. nondominant) and the effort (maximal vs. submaximal). The test administrator was blinded to the level of effort. On each day, four isotonic grip-strength tests were performed at loads of 20%, 30%, 40%, and 50% of isometric test scores. Three repeated isotonic grip strength trials were performed at each load and the average was plotted. One plot was generated for the maximal effort and another for the submaximal efforts. Average torque was plotted against the average velocity at each of the four loads and for each level of effort (maximal vs. submaximal). The linear relationship of the torque-velocity curve was examined by performing regression analysis, calculating the intercept, slope, correlation coefficient (r), and the coefficient of determination (r(2)) for each curve. Paired t-tests were used to compare the intercept, slope, and r(2) between maximal and submaximal efforts. Bonferroni correction set the alpha level at 0.0167. Sensitivity and specificity values were calculated for linearity (r(2)) and a Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) curve was constructed to obtain the optimal sensitivity and specificity combination. In addition, test-retest reliability was determined for velocity of maximal isotonic effort using Intraclass Correlation Coefficient. Significant differences between maximal and submaximal efforts were found for the intercept (t=5.069; p<0.001) and for linearity as expressed by r(2) (t=5.414; p<0.001). Mean r(2) was 0.89 for maximal effort and 0.53 for submaximal effort. The slopes of maximal and submaximal efforts were not significantly different (t=0.14; p=0.888). The ROC curve revealed the optimal combination of sensitivity (0.69) and specificity (0.72) values. Test-retest reliability of maximal isotonic grip effort for velocity was r=0.843. The differences in intercepts suggested that velocity was greater during maximal effort. Greater r(2) values indicated greater linearity for maximal efforts than submaximal efforts. These findings suggest that the torque-velocity test of the BTE-Primus can distinguish between maximal and submaximal efforts during grip-strength testing. However, the test misclassified 31% of submaximal effort and 28% of maximal error, for a total error of 59%.

Clinical signs included tachypnea, dyspnea, cyanosis, lack of lung sounds on auscultation of the dorsal aspect of the thorax, fever, tachycardia, signs of depression or anxiousness, and cough. Radiography and ultrasonography were useful to definitively diagnose pneumothorax. Pneumothorax was bilateral in 47.5% (19/40) and unilateral in 42.5% (17/40) of horses; designation of unilateral versus bilateral was not recorded in the remaining 4 horses. Horses with pneumothorax secondary to pleuropneumonia more commonly had unilateral pneumothorax (64.7% for unilateral vs 29.4% for bilateral; not specified for 1 horse). Horses with pneumothorax secondary to pleuropneumonia were less likely to survive than horses with pneumothorax secondary to other causes (35.3 vs 69.6% survived, respectively).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE\nPleuropneumonia is an important cause of pneumothorax in horses. Classic clinical signs of pneumothorax may not be evident. Radiography, ultrasonography, or both may be required for diagnosis. Prognosis for survival is better for horses with pneumothorax not associated with pleuropneumonia.","inCitations":["a3505a264d800ca7dd8058083cbf0ec4219de928","6fa9ec5bde0deeabbea373d1995ce69d556e8f52","6ff899ccf991554ecc7dbf0fc6c509c2256df14d","b46fa21b25be1da4262adf091ab1a35856c17084","75e73fc95fe3b1d05f68181256d3982b85994167","aadaa5d01020a8bbf7a32f78b981c913685945c1","ccadd1b5ec1ca3f19a89e976bb272e560fa0ca34","45527c8285f0c64931c178b248afb45e3002adcc","7d9a6535ff2c24c6a339e546d0fb6172c79e3819","f7da9ec754028505c2a4f491df5ef6f8d9518fd7","0c90cb81befdf068c1abe9fe63604739cb72d6ea"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Pneumothorax in horses: 40 cases (1980-1997).","doi":"10.2460/javma.2000.216.1955","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.2460/javma.2000.216.1955","venue":"Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association"}

Undergraduate students (N=117) enrolled in upper division exercise and sport science courses recruited participants. Participants in the cognitive-behavioral intervention condition received weekly mentoring from students on strategies to foster self-regulation, whereas those in a minimal intervention control condition (i.e., pedometer and self-monitoring) did not. All volunteers wore a pedometer for 6 weeks, maintained a step-count log, and completed physical activity and barrier self-efficacy measures pre- and postintervention. Repeated measures analysis of variance revealed that intervention condition participants increased their steps more so than those in the control condition, F(5, 570) = 10.1, p < .0001, starting at Week 3, with effect sizes in the moderate range. Intervention condition participants also reported increased physical activity self-efficacy, whereas those in the control condition did not, F(1, 77) = 5.6, p < .03, Cohen d = .47. There were no significant changes in barrier self-efficacy for either group. Overall, these findings suggest a student-led cognitive-behavioral pedometer intervention results in more favorable changes in step counts and physical activity self-efficacy than simply wearing a pedometer and self-monitoring step counts.","inCitations":["ba1dda6e1be085a3a82b06dd95131a6899fccfc5","76286c2964ced68188457c55aca9feae5dd3f801","f79e009efe8413266bf05d57fc5b3978f3eab1e9","1fa0cb84a5e6b46c5344208dfb5d9ab44f0838f6","8b899b37f7ac10800452d343465804ddb36be62d","fa01bfd9c445798ca626f7a7142f87f547766cf8","210aa4a2db5039766030cef66fcadcf17ceeb11f","310b1a962b69b768617f7bd22dbd8a915d7a705e","120218fefc4e4a85643491b06bdf9841a47a13f3","c4cb41ace328867a8a52808b81b7ad7c31fcaefd","e34fbd6f7a849b7def3b1898a2352024f5dd33b3"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"The impact of a student-led pedometer intervention incorporating cognitive-behavioral strategies on step count and self-efficacy.","doi":"10.1080/02701367.2010.10599631","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1080/02701367.2010.10599631","venue":"Research quarterly for exercise and sport"}

Practical piping of power plants often have a steam flow, and moreover, the steam state can be not only dry steam but also wet steam. From our previous experiments, higher acoustical damping was confirmed under low-pressure wet steam than that under low-pressure dry steam, which is considered to be caused by the existing liquid phase in a wet steam. Moreover, the effects of the liquid phase on the pressure fluctuation was considered to be small at a high pressure since the maximum amplitude under wet steam increased with increasing the static pressure. In this paper, we investigated the combined effects of the static pressure and steam wetness on the pressure fluctuation. We conducted experiments on acoustic resonance in a single side branch under wet steam flow with the static pressure and steam wetness as parameters to extract and evaluate the dominant factors affecting the mechanism of acoustical damping under a wet steam flow.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://fiv2018.com/ocs/index.php/fiv2018/fivcan/paper/viewFile/147/5"],"title":"Experimental Investigation of Effects of Static Pressure and Steam Wetness on Acoustic Resonance Amplitude in a Closed Side Branch","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Here, we report a retrospective review of the experience with implantation of BCNU wafers in our institutions and our findings regarding the risk factors for the AEs.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe reviewed the records of patients with malignant glioma who were implanted with BCNU wafers between April 2013 and September 2014. Their AEs were examined clinically and radiologically and evaluated according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) grading. For investigating the association between risk factors and incidence of AEs, histological diagnosis, extent of resection, and period of BCNU wafers implantation surgery were selected as possible risk factors.\n\n\nRESULTS\nTwenty-one patients were included in this investigation. There were no associations among incidence of AEs and histological diagnosis or extent of tumor resection. However, regarding the period of BCNU wafers implantation, additional resection for newly diagnosed tumors and resection for recurrent tumors tended to increase the rate and severity of AEs, especially cerebral edema, compared to primary resection.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nIn cases of BCNU wafers implantation, the incidence and degree of AEs might increase if additional resection for newly diagnosed tumors or resection for recurrent tumors is performed. Our investigation revealed that AEs associated with implantation of BCNU wafers tend to occur in the repeated glioma surgery.","inCitations":["6f9f10f510075a7611709b28e9864b6d15420032"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"[Risk Factors for Adverse Events after Implantation of BCNU Wafers in High-grade Gliomas].","doi":"10.11477/mf.1436203084","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.11477/mf.1436203084","venue":"No shinkei geka.

The thyroid gland is the only significant source of thyroxin (T4) while most of the biologically more active triiodothyronine (T3) is produced extra-thyroidally. Disorders of the thyroid gland can be categorized into those associated with underproduction of thyroid hormones (hypothyroidism, such as Hashimoto's thyroiditis) and those associated with an overproduction of thyroid hormones (hyperthyroidism, such as Grave's disease). Recent studies have associated thyroid dysfunction with reproductive disorders including infertility and pregnancy loss.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Thyroid Function and Reproduction","doi":"10.1016/B978-0-12-801238-3.64521-X","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-801238-3.64521-X","venue":""}

The braze joints are characterised by scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, micro-hardness measurement. With increasing brazing temperature from 980 to 1040°C, the approximate width of the braze layer decreases from 350 to 80 µm and hardness reduces from 600 to 410 VHN. However, not much difference is found in microstructure and hardness between braze joints produced at 1020 and 1040°C. With increasing brazing temperature, morphology and volume fraction of intermetallics formed in the braze layer change, thereby reducing the hardness variation between the braze layer and the base metal.","inCitations":["7ce61149aaba61c9de47cbf0384cdf4ec7a74e58"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Effect of brazing temperature on the microstructure of martensitic–austenitic steel joints","doi":"10.1080/02670836.2017.1292205","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1080/02670836.2017.1292205","venue":""}

No CO2 or other greenhouse gases emissions are produced in this route and carbon is obtained as a solid co-product at the end of the reaction ( CH 4 ⇆ C + 2 H 2 ). This process can be thermally or catalytically conducted and recent studies have demonstrated that the carbon obtained in the reaction can also show catalytic activity. In this work, thermal and autocatalytic decomposition of methane were studied and compared with the steam reforming with and without CO2 capture and storage from an environmental point of view, using life cycle assessment (LCA) tools. As well, different energetic scenarios were included in the study. The selected functional unit was 1 Nm3 of hydrogen and the LCA was focused on material and raw materials acquisition and manufacturing stages. The assessment was carried out with SimaPro 7.1 software by using Eco-indicator 95 method. Results showed that autocatalytic decomposition is the most environmental-friendly process for hydrogen production since presented the lowest total environmental impact and CO2 emissions. Also, steam reforming with CO2 capture and storage led to lower CO2 emissions but higher total environmental impact than conventional steam reforming.","inCitations":["9ca96e5a277e47398d0d71285faf8e7d77bcfef7","1efed5d936824ad7ab3a64fee5e74303017b9b33","db352517876c9cc09ab84ac5a432176b6f6f3c7c","9aeec2e047b0d7a4cf320257f42458f6ceeab306","21b962651f953626474d461ad68d6f0c38745402","1a631075f8a08a2355d2b6624bee942a33aa2385","922a39f1165e44ede35211a56148fd16a11801f3","360d41dbcab6b93c452fba8d63d47ee6a6ef7124","04c0d3b83d6903d1e0831ea17fd45db70578d5cc","629e5525cfe9e4c56f91beac08122ca5f8b28845","c801d0750479734272fad23343e8d704ffe9b848","3eb733a698361da9df5db2964ae048904ebc8695","3d80720498e25b6316c7cf0a6145978c34cbd480","0b758d3190a51eb1dfa7d6d318bfddff519045c5","a6f6d5dade6d536d4dc7702f578b376bd607509c","0b2564321d03144b2eb874061281f49fd8e474eb","bdaf5f0c45d857efa6dccad8709958534d27ac97","5584c5c0a85fe740c2bcc673f2b025980efc9449","783d3efbe8e9ce6262a1bca9a3f6f6fc88765eea","1bcd9802541b393000bc59353f0c4c4d532874f5","0f891e4adef3e9d6bcde1ac59b4f532c1a82f0c0","7f1d421bcb87280904302d13c82fbd1ebe460272","d05d507c7d7c154867fe9fdd5ff11b04b1dabef9","096635f638a73107aa728c94e3e977c3e519e3bd","5ed38de9f42d198f28f84d196ef051bfeccbf869","f2f463312d6e3e6068fdac7876d386f797507835","10c820feb93aa3df1063ee4ce6de5549a18b7e10","4901a629c2c9f32c5ae716911a59c397ab4f0dd7","05b7a21f9784b0417bd3e9d7daf493dcc38f8a2c","fc758277a55c378b5eddd28a0732695d8476eea5"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Life cycle assessment of processes for hydrogen production.
