Children were observed throughout 1 day; all foods offered and consumed were weighed, and food-related behaviors noted. Children ate frequently, at least 2 meals and an average of 7.4 +/- 2.6 snacks daily. Children had access to 2029 +/- 575 kcal (8493 +/- 2407 kJ) yet only consumed 1528 +/- 343 kcal (6396 +/- 1436 kJ) daily; thus food availability was not restricting intake. A higher proportion of snacks than meals (85 per cent vs. 71 per cent) was consumed. Children requested foods frequently (x = 9.2 +/- 4.3) and 76 per cent of requests were fulfilled. Neither amount of accessible food nor amount consumed differed by age, gender, or socioeconomic status. The importance of the child's role in determining food intake, and of snacking to overall food consumption, was demonstrated.","inCitations":["d9c480f1f3079351639068fdeae8a74c0df8e4b7","3eb2135eaf711a958d68639a0032aa54ebe27970","3e38d16c58610f751fcc348ad71d9488ce32d757","087b5557e8248fe903319f5dad31c72557e923d4","6b2f6eeceb16ce0ce14d06de58bc0caad7c8334f","dd9545e804714b89138501bdf6287a8d6af30149","1229b72f8bf7db031fe998c97d785293e12dc95d","b74aaeb24b6b094a32cf24f08e16e262790e39f5","c475d8122e53f6cb412e53b0b4e14194c18c1895","942efab03c674baddba727000962189602dcb8d7","9afe2d7b7b7476698a8644268f1ee0124c2d10af","6a4c6265461c827a467899038a6e2496de69e6c1","f9c0a91f3a43bed524193dd5a4093fdbf44d6195"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Self-regulation of food intake among rural Mexican preschool children.","doi":"","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"European journal of clinical nutrition"}

Methods An epidemiological investigation was carried out for each case of diagnosis - confirmed case of 2009 influenza A ( H1N1) in pregnant women and women at child - bearing age. Their epidemiological features were described and analyzed,including temporal,geographical and occupational distribution of the cases. Logistic regression analysis was used to explore related factors for deaths in pregnant woman caused by influenza A (H1N1). Results During 2009 ～ 2010,a total of 81 reported cases of 2009 influenza A (H1N1) occurred among pregnant women in Beijing,25 (30. 9% ) severe cases and six deaths who all were migrant laborers from other provinces and regions,with a case-fatality of 6. 2 percent. Proportion of severe cases and case - fatality of influenza A (H1N) in pregnant women were higher than those in child - bearing age women ( χ2 = 88. 2,P 0. 001 and χ2 = 9. 6,P 0. 005 ). Results of multivariate logistic regression revealed that time interval between onset and initiating medication,and body mass index (BMI) were risk factors for death caused by influenza A ( H1N1) in pregnant women. Conclusion Diagnosis-confirmed influenza A ( H1N1) cases in pregnant women seems to be at risk to complicate with respiratory failure and infectious toxic shock,and they have higher risk to develop severe cases and lead to death than child-bearing age women do. Pregnant women in migrant laborers are key target population in its prevention and control.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Epidemiological features of pandemic influenza A (H1N1) in pregnant women during 2009 to 2010","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

The highest caribou count was 258 in June 1987. The proportion of newborn calves observed during the May calving period ranged from 0 to 28% (mean=10%) whereas it ranged from 4 to 17% (mean=13%) in October. Caribou inhabited mostly coniferous forest from October through April and open habitat from May through September. Male caribou occupied fewer habitat types, travelled less distance, and remained at lower elevations than female caribou.

Proportions of case detection and treatment initiation were compared using the Pearson Chi square test and median time delays using the Mood's Median test.\n\n\nRESULTS\nA total of 975 individuals at risk of drug-resistant TB were registered in the pre-intervention year and 1,442 in the post-intervention year. After Xpert introduction, TB positivity rate increased by 15%, while rifampicin resistance rate reduced by 23% among TB positive cases and by 9% among all tested. Second-line TB treatment initiation rate among rifampicin resistant patients increased by 19%. Time from client registration to diagnosis was reduced by 74 days to a median of a single day (IQR 0-4) and time from diagnosis to treatment start was reduced by 27 days to a median of 15 days (IQR 7-51). All findings were significant with p<0.001.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nCompared to solid and liquid culture and drug-susceptibility testing, Xpert detected more TB and less rifampicin resistance, increased second-line treatment initiation rates and shortened time to diagnosis and treatment. This test holds promise to improve rapid case finding and management of drug-resistant TB patients in Indonesia.","inCitations":["5c35306b84b57ad6721f760c97c1e78e30c139e5","b8d1b456306a31bf30d257e6f013d5933bbaa897","4c87281217c646edb6a6c0cbe23e10697dc44c3f","3f23f35083e68740579641390ed4b254a5267572","f7b429e4ca64c1fdc8b8ed7cfc8c450d2ad43fcd","ae9ebfb41304bb36073bec10a3933da48126e474","33993143ee400ec9b2baab2d7b7e635dbf40263d","f77f4cb13697a628ae3e1611dbe507733bfcd578","225759f0cecbc0fca71f73b4eee4eb2cdc2fbdb3","d743d68ed9cb36e3569218c460f35c883923746d","25774bd4486bb8b294c835e39f7f86f2aeae41ea","b50d3d361cd59db077e725ee8b070fd1e8c20353","90d5493e9e53209de31e41d6d5a45d13a220f08f","33ed932c8a6de2b768e007ac5127c8f201047657","36e0da4584059fb72e6636a2b5bf134b4f78edc1","76a2697d98d7805652b1a2efe6b24cce1a30b717","6f9e0d836d12f9e99f08b751cbc1c758a95e83d8","439ff0344ad40247737ce166d3d8bcb8c2c24f4e","f1270a1dbd4dd14d70319d75d63b2c06e286eea2","35479314f8137f74190554fc8a3c9d77205d4b1d","2d67b7af1160ec19fcf1b488fd3c608d7ecc69bd","c2112eef99a16d9dd2a3739014a3fbfb8a3751cc","9d747c35f41b535b72343fd0342de88f7433d1b7","97bacc3ef1ae18687152c58daba7865db3d776fc","6f1f5ddf99dc5eb8983cf64b466bd9101a5bbbfb","ab194d3460e2c9ba1db6f188e4513acdb9300cdc","5e20fd22b95cffb7e2e33571a070dc4372da58f3"],"pdfUrls":["http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0123536&type=printable"],"title":"Effects of Introducing Xpert MTB/RIF on Diagnosis and Treatment of Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis Patients in Indonesia: A Pre-Post Intervention Study","doi":"10.1371/journal.pone.0123536","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0123536","venue":"PloS one"}

The first is caused by the strengthening effect of C and N and the low stacking fault energy leading to intense cold work hardening and e.g. increased resistance to fatigue, which implies a high resistance to cavitation erosion. Corrosion resistance is provided by the elements chromium and molybdenum. Usual manufacturing consists of casting, often followed by hot working. An alternative approach uses pre-alloyed, gas-atomized powders, which can be compacted either by hot isostatic pressing or supersolidus liquid phase sintering. The latter provides the possibility of adapting the nitrogen content via sintering atmosphere. This results in fully dense materials exhibiting comparable mechanical properties like the cast and hot worked alloys. In this study, high interstitial CrMnCN steels with different nitrogen contents were tested in an ultrasonic vibratory cavitation rig and analyzed by electrochemical polarization measurements using different electrolytes. The results indicate positive influences of increasing nitrogen content on both cavitation erosion and corrosion resistance. A comparison with cast and hot worked alloys is included.","inCitations":["2edd37323857fba3f375d0d3f38acb83de9af56b","31119520d4e81ac569061cbff66c1e6f6d123741","48a71944c01361b4422aedb8d18ca961211c25ac","f4e8380427fdc627d2be3d57b74dac000e8dcc6b"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Influence of conventional and powder-metallurgical manufacturing on the cavitation erosion and corrosion of high interstitial CrMnCN austenitic stainless steels","doi":"10.1016/j.wear.2016.04.017","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.wear.2016.04.017","venue":""}

The obese patients have differences in body composition, drug distribution, and metabolism. Sugammadex at T 2 recovery in a dose of 2 mg kg(-1) of real body weight (RBW) can completely reverse the NMB block; in our study we investigated the safety and efficacy of Sugammadex dose based on their ideal body weight (IBW). Methods. 40 patients of both sexes undergoing laparoscopic bariatric surgery were enrolled divided into 2 groups according to the dose of Sugammadex: the first received a dose of 2 mg kg(-1) of IBW and the second received a dose of 2 mg kg(-1) of RBW. Both were anesthetized with doses calculated according to the IBW: fentanyl 2  μ g kg(-1), propofol 3 mg kg(-1), rocuronium 0,6 mg kg(-1), oxygen, air, and desflurane (6-8%). Maintenance doses of rocuronium were 1/4 of the intubation dose. Sugammadex was administrated at T 2 recovery. Results. The durations of intubation and maintenance doses of rocuronium were similar in both groups. In IBW group, the T 4/T 1 value of 0.9 was reached in 151 ± 44 seconds and in 121 ± 55 seconds in RBW group (P = 0.07). Discussion. Recovery times to T 4/T 1 of 0.9 are surprisingly similar in both groups without observing any postoperative residual curarization. Conclusion. Sugammadex doses calculated according to the IBW are certainly safe for a rapid recovery and absence of PORC.","inCitations":["3287458163f91b9a7c3ab2afeadf71e8e1e04e55","7fd9c97d98beb6ee7dee07c1d187af28a1dea3b5","f6f2a3358fe297f80edf905f0e79b7d71f583578","4a05d8b34e33a9d088941f15123ef7c577829151","1d9743ad8a3cc43ccde281f98a72d324460cedcd","c17ca8b9e017f0094dcc9b1ee474aba24921faa5","0fa8263498051ae9456ad1ee08aecc51bd7ea411","48ad5bfc445ea28e494e53777a995a7c3d79f084","4c7f6ec0a175aefe30e22f345f0e9a988ac9dc33","76e80c7315cc04e30f2f8cbf016a37a8d4cfd3c9","d29840f884ee9b0f401222fff08edbecc5937e2f","7419f0b4a0f412b992ab7cf2ffbabc438c40084d","4be99c479f1288ba8965b7f00e1fab7c3ea1a0af","db865a807736d73f71e047c1db5f958cf801653f"],"pdfUrls":["http://downloads.hindawi.com/journals/arp/2013/389782.pdf"],"title":"Sugammadex and Ideal Body Weight in Bariatric Surgery","doi":"10.1155/2013/389782","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1155/2013%2F389782","venue":"Anesthesiology research and practice"}

More than other medicinal plant preparations, bioactive components of H. perforatum are often found to vary by a factor of two compared to concentrations reported on labels for the prepared drug. Variability is attributable to environmental condition fluctuations to which the plants were exposed during growth and development. Daily light integral control has been shown to produce predictable, consistent biomass gain in other crops, but has not been related yet to secondary metabolite production in H. perforatum. This project focused on production of three important secondary metabolites, hypericin, pseudohypericin and hyperforin, from plants grown in floating hydroponic systems in controlled environments with the light integral held at 8.6, 13 or 20 mol m-2 d-1 and an average light intensity of 340 µmol m-2 s-1 (at 25C, 16 hour photoperiod). Plant growth data and metabolite concentrations (determined by HPLC), from seedling stage to 108 day old plants, are presented. An exponential model for biomass estimation per square meter of growing space is presented, valid between the integrals of 8.6 and 20 mol m-2 d-1, a photosynthetic period of 16 hours, 25C constant air temperature and ambient CO2 concentration.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Impact of differing light integrals at a constant light intensity: effects on biomass and production of secondary metabolites by Hypericum perforatum","doi":"10.13031/2013.24198","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.13031/2013.24198","venue":""}

The N-terminal GTP-binding domains of tubulin and FtsZ are virtually identical in structure, as expected from the substantial sequence identity.

A surprising finding is that the N-terminal GTP-binding domain is structurally homologous to that of Ras and other G proteins, despite the completely different GTP-binding sequence motifs. This article discusses these findings and the molecular mechanisms that can now be addressed with the atomic structures.","inCitations":["2b10b834eec5c0195313eba6b4269281c2df249a","c6239c51fd54d308c6852e4bf9d9117874be6ccf","aaa3fb5ad9375e87881e54b18eb09a32e9aba1a7","0310b0cdc4526ab3b9ed6eb79daa94cdd994bef4","ab0ec54a3d926f41fdb69f6f556574e44f29fe3e","da72295cd8ec08b907418bfaceb1ca9645b4aeec","241620d83db4f9b1c0400415243903b0ffe5fff2","ebc9d9b511c57894c6d850d6dd3e7ee25ea78b48","294733767fd89eadd1dad2255d9e566954c88dc2","cf9c2b94d22d47f963860702c4df7de8960643dc","6433d006af61cd561e57578e022af8f993f6e10c","dfa380d9d1f94bd12597fed4ac97ce10a579c933","0b4d2eacd7e82943ba3268b2cd695036abc30309","137584a37128bc9f03787e9f1f300a1e5efbda76","a681b6d5fa5a76f502915184a28c419bd764622f","91af0c7ad0b99132d0d9e8fe500a61d73e974e2f","00b4321759063fd36c39dc13c3a2cba2c4e2865c","b4652c342e712e6d000bbc62511b797499f84c3b","0396a67d471e7fe148bc87682a169dec579e9389","3a32da5368162cc2a1481bcc6ff785c19493b242","01e909e8668711b0d485819fdb1279bacd54d3ca","07e9f95284f176555d93d5be4722d0956a882bec","a359568581355290edd2a3a6670d71ded7e4a481","657252957abe15b368334d8a2de7457b31fb4081","537cc731d4ff80957d086cf61809e8e8818a2c7a","115bd03776ac70613e0a4ecda7b7b6e9eeac1595","ae477b8606f77dfa1cb19342f50946c3733125e5","9f867a2c008b0d18af3de1b349189a855ae3e080","f3189a882abf1a67258cb41a96a08f70d9419a06","9f6c7f5292dd47041748a744a80e3c2d5b0ac4f8","07880b3ac42ab2c9204cee2d8ad34b1e0cb1037a","6f886aa086931af873bbb87f5d9ee863c036bedc","33073797ff10b645a2accfecad021e36f7ea6d97","c3c013b581089ac10340806987eea1d6618498db","b0f7b00e07899fa7e65e0a3065a583fbb1e10285","d87e904a8a53d9638e164d9078f671971629437b","66e2fee78b4714e9b142f097fbee0b186097aad6","b0dd0a790616671bf2665c1440ff02997e5b78e1","c8259a395e25fc3b9cb5d81d8fc9320b7ad11c05"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Atomic structures of tubulin and FtsZ.","doi":"10.1016/S0962-8924(98)01237-9","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/S0962-8924%2898%2901237-9","venue":"Trends in cell biology"}

Poplavljenih je bilo 124 obcin v Posavju, na Dolenjskem, v Zasavju, Ljubljani ter na severu in jugu Primorske. Poplavljenih je bilo vec kot 7000 objektov, tudi stevilna podjetja, približno 30.000 hektarjev kmetijskih povrsin, poskodovanih je bilo 70 mostov, stevilne ceste in druga infrastruktura ter telekomunikacijsko omrežje. Pri odpravljanju posledic poplav je bilo aktivnih 10.000 resevalcev. Civilna zascita, gasilci in ostali resevalci niso imeli dovolj sredstev na razpolago, zato so bile aktivirane tudi enote Slovenske vojske. Ta se je dejavno vkljucila v odpravo posledic poplav 18. 9. 2010 in sodelovala vse do 27. 9. 2010, ko ni bilo vec potreb za njeno pomoc. Pripadniki in pripadnice slovenske vojske so sodelovali z ostalimi resevalci in si prizadevali hitro in ucinkovito pomagati ljudem, ter odpraviti posledice poplav. Slovenska vojska je na ogroženih obmocjih delovala tudi z razlicnimi motornimi vozili in vozili za dekontaminacijo terena. V 10 dneh sodelovanja so pripadniki Slovenske vojske ocistili in odpeljali vec ton materiala. Ves cas delovanja so vojaki ravnali po nacrtu Vihra. Ta opredeljuje delovanje SV pri zasciti in resevanju ob naravnih in drugih nesrecah, s ciljem nacrtnega, pravocasnega, kvalitetnega in racionalnega delovanja enot SV.

Many fast block-matching algorithms reduce the computational complexity of motion estimation by carefully designing the search patterns with different shapes or sizes which have significant impact on the search speed and distortion performance. However, the search speed and the distortion performance conflict often with each other for these methods. In this paper, given a block in the current frame, we first apply a fast approximate method based on edge alignment to obtain a good initial motion vector as well as a tight initial bound of distortion measure. Then, considering the edge orientation of the block, a modified hexagon search is used to fine tune the motion vector in low computational complexity. The proposed algorithm also pays attentions to the characteristics of multiple reference frames and multiple block sizes in H.264/AVC. Computer simulation results show that the proposed method gives good performance and spans a new way to design a cost-effective real-time video coding system.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Predictive search pattern selection based on edge alignment for fast motion estimation","doi":"10.1109/ISPACS.2009.4806744","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISPACS.2009.4806744","venue":"2008 International Symposium on Intelligent Signal Processing and Communications Systems"}

Especially, four managerial dismissal requirements which were established and legislated following judicial precedents are criticised as hindering the enhancement of the flexibility in labour markets and being an obstacle to new hiring, mainly youth employment in the light of 'Law and Economics'. (2) Managerial dismissal which was legally admitted to Korea has brought a far-reaching and considerable influence to the national economy and society. In this regards, \"the Social Safety Net\" should be enlarged to support the living stability and promote reemployment of the unemployed as an ex-post-facto relief step. As regards the scope of managerial dismissal, a strict limitation can infringe employers' freedom of economic activity. Temporarily, it can contribute to the employment stability of the employed, but in the long run, deprive more workers of employment opportunities. In, the other hand, excessive extension of the scope can result in infringement of workers' rights to labour and life. Companies might get to seek more profit while employees should suffer unstable employment. (3) It would be difficult to mark the balancing point between employers' freedom of economic activity and workers' rights to labour and life when devising legislation with the view of deregulation. (4) Difficulty in harmonising 'Justice', the objective of law, and 'Efficiency', that of economics, explains the limits of legislation of deregulation laws. We live in the world where individualism is prevalent and it is also expected to spread over future society. It should be also considered that a rough-and-ready legislation inconsistent with reality of the market mechanism aggravates illegal and unlawful markets and with loss of effective obligation of contracts, it brings into disorder in labour markets of regular and irregular workers. (5) This paper focuses on the limits that criticism of defects in dismissal-related policies does not have enough persuasiveness to deny theoretical and practical aspects of the dismissal system, through sub chapters about 'the system of dismissal and increasing the flexibility of labour markets(Ⅱ)', 'the system of dismissal and policy abuse(Ⅲ)', 'justification of the dismissal system(Ⅳ)', and 'prospects of society(Ⅴ)'. (6) Confrontation in discussion comes from different opinions on our society and this paper simply suggested herein new perspectives about this discussion. The dismissal system, which requires further examination to overcome the limits and find an alternative to this system will be left for the subject of future studies.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"고용과 관계된 법과 정책에 대한 소고","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

These are Smart Transportation, Smart Governance, Smart Economy, Smart Environment, Smart Health, Smart Industry, Smart Security, and Smart Life. There are dozens of intelligent systems in each category. The correct operation of these systems is as important as their security. For example, if any infiltration or intrusion into an intelligent system such as smart intersections, smart roads, crowd management, city noise mapping, smart energy, natural gas and water supply systems, early warning systems, the city may be in great danger. Natural disasters can be experienced as well as fatal consequences that affect human life. Therefore, the rulers of the smart city should always be on the alert and ensure the cyber security of the smart city. Cyber refers to electronic environments such as computer, server, device, hardware, software, protocol, algorithm, process, policy, process, laboratory, system. Cyber security is a set of methods, policies, concepts, and guidelines, risk management approaches, activities, trainings, best practice experiences and technologies used to protect the information assets of institutions, organizations and users. Intelligent strategies against cyber-attacks should be developed as the city environment created by smart systems has become very attractive for data thieves. Otherwise, a smart city can bring people closer to bad situations rather than bring people closer to technology. In this study, Cyber Security in Smart cities will be explained. The current literature review will reveal the latest trends in these two areas. The study is considered to be beneficial for smart cities technology developers.","inCitations":["1c42964729962d7838417d3fef790bdac2f7280d","c6bd79f573e785e5822d16cf8c388e0b1419ee03"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Cyber Security for Smart Cities","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

The results with permanent paraffin sections were compared with those of FSE.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAmong the twenty cases, 15 (75%) had the same results in frozen and permanent sections of cone biopsy specimens. Among the other 5 patients, 2 had high grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia in frozen sections and 2 showed a lower grade while only one case was found in which the FSE result was CIN3 while the permanent section showed invasive carcinoma which was of clinical importance and considered as significant. Paired sample t-testing showed no significant difference in the results of the two groups of frozen and permanent sections (P=0.716, CI=95%).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nFrozen section evaluation of cervical cone biopsy specimens in patients with a diagnosis of CIN 3 is accurate, efficient and cost-effective. Because of the great importance of missing even one case, further research is highly recommended on this controversial subject.","inCitations":["cad97ba13f51c194cd882b6058e46c6578fd776b"],"pdfUrls":["http://apjcpcontrol.net/paper_file/issue_abs/Volume11_No3/731%20Malihe%20Hasanzadeh.pdf"],"title":"Role of frozen sections in the evaluation of moderate to severe dysplasia during uterine cervix conization.","doi":"","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP"}

Effectiveness of analgesia was also compared. Methods: Two groups of patients for IHR were included in the randomized, double-blind study. An epidural catheter was placed in the surgical wound, tunneled subcutaneously and connected to a balloon-pump containing either 0.25% bupivacaine (B) or 0.25% ropivacaine (R). Postoperatively, the patient self-administered the LA into the wound. Administration could be repeated after 20 min. If moderate to severe pain still persisted, rescue medication (piritramid) was given intravenously. The variables recorded in both groups were: visual analogue scale (VAS), pain scores at rest and with movement, number of applications, wound healing, patients’ satisfaction. Results: During the first 24 hr, median number of LA applications in 26 B patients was 4 (range 1–6) and in 25 R patients 3 (range 1–5). Both groups showed low VAS pain scores: less than 2 at rest, less than 4 with movement. Eighty percent of patients of each group would choose this type of analgesia again. Two patients from B Group and three from R Group needed rescue medication. No wound infection was observed. There were no statistically significant differences between the groups. Conclusion: Self-administration of the LA solution via a catheter in the surgical wound is an effective method of pain relief after IHR with little side-effects.

Associated export of sinking organic matter leads to oxygen consumption at depth, and thereby helps to maintain the tropical OMZs. Biogeochemical feedback processes between nutrient-rich OMZ waters and biological production in the upwelling regions and their net impact on the evolution of the OMZs depend on the strengths of the flow pathways connecting OMZs and the upper ocean, because even though water has to be isolated below the mixed layer for some time in order for OMZs to develop, it has to be brought up to the surface mixed layer eventually in order to exchange properties with the atmosphere. \n \nHere, we investigate the connections between OMZs and the surface mixed layer, and their sensitivity to global warming with a coupled ocean–atmosphere general circulation model by analyzing the fate of simulated floats released in the OMZs. We find that under present-day climate conditions, on decadal time scales a much larger portion of the model's OMZ waters reaches the surface ocean in the Pacific than in the Atlantic Ocean: within 20 years, 75% in the Pacific and 38% in the Atlantic. When atmospheric CO2 is doubled, the fraction of modeled OMZ waters reaching the upwelling in the same time decreases by about 25% in both oceans. As a consequence, feedback between biogeochemical processes in OMZs and in the surface ocean is likely to be weakened in the future.","inCitations":["e3be3eef9da91aacfc6a0e67e7ec96f172685975","325f7323403240cba73285a62ba08d51f9068e9c","3e785eb1dedb681158427d41b410db59bb327e6d","daa209363a14ec7da6416578b5073d5cf8065820","a86559b130edc3d69efac160931ba24254fb70dd","5bc2cbe2cb0e37ffc982c9e6db7c82fc87d6b495"],"pdfUrls":["http://eprints.uni-kiel.de/12418/1/1748-9326_6_4_045001.pdf"],"title":"Simulated reduction in upwelling of tropical oxygen minimum waters in a warmer climate","doi":"10.1088/1748-9326/6/4/045001","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326%2F6%2F4%2F045001","venue":""}

Two of those major challenges are selective activation of muscles and fatigue management. This review discusses how electrode arrays improve the efficiency and selectivity of functional electrical stimulation (FES) applied via transcutaneous electrodes. In this paper we review the principles and achievements during the last decade on techniques for artificial motor unit recruitment to improve the selective activation of muscles. We review the key factors affecting the outcome of muscle force production via multi-pad transcutaneous electrical stimulation and discuss how stimulation parameters can be set to optimize external activation of body segments.

Methylglyoxal (MG), a key intermediate of glucose metabolism, is elevated in AD brains and modifies Aβ42, increasing misfolding and leading to the accumulation of senile plaques. Liraglutide, an analog of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), is neurotrophic and neuroprotective. However, whether liraglutide can protect against AD-like memory-related deficits and tau hyperphosphorylation caused by MG in vivo is not known. Here, we report that MG induces tau hyperphosphorylation and causes ultrastructural hippocampal damage and cognitive impairment in C57BL/6J mice. Liraglutide reduced these effects via activation of the protein kinase B and glycogen synthase kinase-3β pathways. Our data reveal that liraglutide may alleviate AD-like cognitive impairment by decreasing the phosphorylation of tau.","inCitations":["fff7517bd386a3bba29b3ed93edc695e85264b8d","d8e1c3f87b49d366f0c19501c1c32c1ee7145656","b554b90fc6a46098dc6b76f93ca23ae1a8e734ab","7ad5560596bdadecedfcf0cf67f468c4cbdf2c0c","c478e322bbde818bcb5eef4c16e8f6fb9d2f208a","21cbf2817884552dee2646ddd07bab75571ec0f9"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.ajtr.org/files/ajtr0036499.pdf"],"title":"Subcutaneous liraglutide ameliorates methylglyoxal-induced Alzheimer-like tau pathology and cognitive impairment by modulating tau hyperphosphorylation and glycogen synthase kinase-3β.","doi":"","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"American journal of translational research"}

Against this background the automatic flow and water level control of barrages is a sophisticated control task due to the non-linear behavior of the process and the multi-purpose use of the impoundment. The paper describes the use of Model-Based Design (MBD) as a method to design and simulate controller algorithms on the basis of unsteady flow simulations and by using graphical modeling tools. A MBD approach allows the designer an early verification and validation of the controller. In addition, special cases in operation can be analyzed and the impact on the impoundment can be assessed. The workflow is presented from requirements to implementation at barrages at the federal waterways. Moreover it is shown, that the automation of chains of barrages creates new demands and requires a coordinated flow management and control in order to ensure a moderate discharge to optimize the hydropower and to provide sufficient water depth for navigation.","inCitations":["039e79b50688ef03f344eb9b9da6b782538373af"],"pdfUrls":["https://izw.baw.de/e-medien/river-flow-2010/PDF/C1/C1_01.pdf"],"title":"Automated operation of chains of barrages-Development of controller algorithms with the use of model-based design","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

For metal nanocrystals, the shape not only determines their physicochemical properties but also their technological relevance for catalytic, plasmonic, photonic, and electronic applications. In particular, heterogeneous catalysis is a fi eld that can benefi t tremendously from the availability of metal nanocrystals with well-controlled shapes, which may serve to signifi cantly increase reaction effi ciency while decreasing material cost. This article provides a brief overview of our recent progress in generating shape-controlled nanocrystals with enhanced catalytic activity toward oxygen reduction and formic acid oxidation, two reactions that are crucial for the successful commercialization of fuel cell technology. The impact on other industrially important reactions will be discussed as well. We hope that this article provides a roadmap for further development of metal nanocrystal-based catalysts with enhanced performance through shape-controlled synthesis.","inCitations":["c8ea6ef66d2593954aa3fed00c773c59af0153df"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Shape-controlled metal nanocrystals for catalytic applications","doi":"10.1557/mrs.2014.167","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1557/mrs.2014.167","venue":""}

The aim of the 20-year follow-up study was to determine the incidence and natural history of diabetes. Outcomes in terms of morbidity and mortality at follow-up were determined in over 97% of the original population. Ninety-four subjects had been identified and treated for diabetes since the first survey, including 17 subjects identified as having a fasting plasma glucose > or = 7.8 mmol l-1 at follow-up. The incidence of diabetes for the total population was 2.2 1000-1 year-1 (95% confidence interval 1.8, 2.6). The risk factors identified at first survey were corrected for age, cut-off at the 95 centile and entered into a log linear model. Those which strongly predicted development of diabetes in the total population were fasting blood glucose (odds ratio (OR) (with 95% confidence intervals) = 2.3 (1.5, 3.5)) and body mass index (OR = 2.2 (1.5, 3.3)) in men, and fasting blood glucose (OR = 2.6 (1.7, 4.1)) and fasting serum triglyceride (OR = 2.8 (1.8, 4.4)) in women. A logit model has enabled the calculation of the probability of developing diabetes 20 years later. It was the characteristics of becoming older such as obesity, hypertriglyceridaemia, and raised fasting blood glucose, rather than age itself, which were associated with the development of diabetes.","inCitations":["9ef078ee33274e247526022d019c92ecabf0f128","86ec89f2c5c32c2367b989e8f31fd37d4061382e","ffd7dcde8aed71641b5ec8c2b7d6750dfe929762","a4c5a0fad3b059dddefe6fc54b5905ce9a52cffd","89a4add0780af062f8171f1a49f20fb26f8cb6ae","992349a59e22fab4d7a0e79e0bd00293d4439d20","3f48db2094dd7940e3899ece945d2da938c507d6","e8592660ee358724be8ea587b0155e0f1689f554","3b0da370374e6e89b39462e0806199a1f8e56d10","7e627a3e0a1b766eee9933298cde7531c14865cc","22d4972681c3162065734a583f2239e0324db532"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"The incidence of diabetes mellitus in an English community: a 20-year follow-up of the Whickham Survey.","doi":"10.1002/(SICI)1096-9136(199608)13:8<741::AID-DIA173>3.0.CO;2-4","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1002/%28SICI%291096-9136%28199608%2913%3A8%3C741%3A%3AAID-DIA173%3E3.0.CO%3B2-4","venue":"Diabetic medicine : a journal of the British Diabetic Association"}

Tamoxifen is the only drug approved for the chemoprevention of estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer. However, to date, no treatment exists for the chemoprevention of estrogen receptor-negative breast cancer. NSAID use is associated with a reduced risk of breast cancer. However, the biological mechanisms underlying the effect of NSAID on breast cancer are not well defined. NSAIDs inhibit cyclooxygenases, thus preventing the formation of prostaglandins, prostacyclin, and thromboxane. NSAIDs also exert other biological effects, including generation of reactive oxygen species and inhibition of nuclear factor-κB-mediated signals. This review synthesizes the evidence on the COX-2-independent mechanisms of action of aspirin, salicylates, and other NSAIDs on breast cancer.","inCitations":["78b2ea89217134f6bf28ecc0f770fa983b535373","b57b15e5055701808368a09b95369dc6b8220c76","4567cd48617027f3dc1cdf5ceefcce76ddbc1693","b554b55ec0269dc256c076add0b07d7fc8b667a9","bd4a012e22dc4d1af469912b5297e7c072fad23e","417e200c1171afc52fd69ea8f31686455f17549e","3008a29560b800fe7fbd25ca9c04a3c281ffb858","d076cb47e0096fcfc5a396e02ad036023c454c23","bb589a02742d6eb45efcba8c454530f5da99fd62","a5c2d0f1f77431cbd78a11231b082d95b3f67404","b09d45be29112830658f8093e3b15184d813dcfc","a12c056f4c973a0e95cd0c1610434fbc782f242d","811a6d17d0647af17f3f588c5fb176fb2f1dce72","082efd7f34d46841e2996e6f3872471e83d5a2d7","c71f30c6d2d5268a2edd2dde70803eba54e349e5"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Aspirin and NSAIDs for breast cancer chemoprevention.","doi":"10.1097/CEJ.0000000000000098","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1097/CEJ.0000000000000098","venue":"European journal of cancer prevention : the official journal of the European Cancer Prevention Organisation"}

In the course of a four-year sampling, a total of 52 species of spiders were caught from 19 collecting sites and 9 geogra- phical regions. They belong to the following families: Scytodidae (1), Segestriidae (1), Dysderidae (8), Nesticidae (1), Anapidae (1), Theridiidae (1), Linyphiidae (20), Agelenidae (3), Cybaeidae (1), Dictynidae (2), Amaurobiidae (2), Liocranidae (3), Corinnidae (1), Zodariidae (1), Gnaphosidae (5), and Salticidae (1). The family Anapidae, with the species Zangherella relicta (Kratochvil, 1935) is recorded from three sites in the Pirin and Slavyanka mountains, and this represents the first record of the family, genus and species in Bulgaria. In spite of the active investigations of the epigean and cave spiders in these regions over the years Z. relicta was not found and it seems it occurs only in deeper subterranean habitats and nowhere else. Comparative study of almost topotypic specimens of Z. relicta from Montenegro with those collected from Bulgaria showed no variation in the shape of palp and female vulvae. Until the true identity of Z. apuliae (Caporiacco, 1949) from Italy is revealed, it remains unclear whether Z. relicta and Z. apuliae are conspecific, as it remains unclear whether the older records of Z. apuliae from the Balkan Peninsula refer to this species or to Z. relicta. Pelecopsis mengei (Simon, 1884) (Linyphiidae) and Scotolathys simplex Simon, 1884 (Dictynidae) are also reported from Bulgaria for the first time, the latter being also new to FYR of Macedonia. A faunistic overview of the spiders found in these underground environments is made, along with remarks on the distribution and ecology of some rare and interesting species.

It will attempt to do so utilizing two main categories: (1) psycho-social development and (2) socio-cultural types and archetypes. Psycho-social development refers to the meaning and telos of the young man’s “maleness” and “masculinity.” It is the self-perceived direction of his sexuality explored within the frameworks of physiology and post-modern implications of his development. Socio-cultural types and archetypes refer to the established male roles and masculine identity markers as well as the human energy that operates in the daily life of college men today. The article concludes with a portrait of the young man’s overall perception of the public sphere, how he is placed within a social and political mindset and imagination regarding maleness and masculinity today.","inCitations":["6dd4d9365a20aeca4f19b007b19a8c8b54ccb02b"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Hermeneutical Portrait of Today’s 18–22 Year Old Young Adult Male","doi":"10.1007/s11089-009-0259-x","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11089-009-0259-x","venue":""}

We investigated the feasibility of IA tirofiban as an adjuvant after unsuccessful IA recanalization with urokinase (UK) for acute ischemic stroke.MethodsWe retrospectively analyzed all 16 consecutive patients (11 men and five women; mean age, 61.3 years; range, 36–85 years) who were treated with IA tirofiban after isolated IA thrombolysis with UK or bridging therapy with systemic recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA; 0.6 mg/Kg) and IA UK for acute ischemic stroke. Outcome measures included angiographic recanalization (thrombolysis in cerebral infarction, TICI), symptomatic and asymptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), mortality, and functional independence at 3 months (modified Rankin Scale, 0–2).ResultsAmong the 16 patients treated with IA tirofiban as an adjuvant, 10 patients had conventional dose (<25 ug/kg, bolus) and six patients had high dose (≥25 ug/kg, bolus) of IA tirofiban after unsuccessful IA thrombolysis whether systemic rt-PA used or not. Successful angiographic recanalization (TICI grade 2b or 3) was achieved in 13 patients (13/16) and a functional independence at 3 months in eight patients (8/16). Three months after therapy, three patients had died. There were two patients of symptomatic ICH and four asymptomatic ICH.ConclusionConventional dose of IA tirofiban as an adjuvant during IA thrombolysis for acute ischemic stroke seems feasible. However, further dose escalation studies should be performed regarding the IA use of tirofiban for acute ischemic stroke.","inCitations":["43e6037af50fbdc8a2fa8a2df63a74f7db557e52","1fb0024a1c270290b015e85a80e8baa264fcdced","f686ea1a1af75979173c482ff4a243b45ff2881f","4aa49c5421ad7c16c9312040e7d2c53032c34ae6","4c937fc9bd569b725b88c580b3bce2af01c5b6f4","d70d7acf9df7d2124d65afb538c1d842ca00c69f","c07895a536ba8da885935136a8776d6e11932e9d","4a04a8db50d4e88d5f828f26103467dfbd9c4bce","8850ed698d0051de228d26d2d079c52582f0d0ea","725f43fc144d9dd9d15a30a95d19feae2f1540c7","f7361590dae5adaf7b05032e0d986a72d6673bbb","d6f538818b04f422af275a7a26c2c47c0415482a","0d9431816df5ba9e995bd62432d2970521e576b1","29d9bf2c54eaf92381d39ca4f2a6b27afc4cba04"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Intra-arterial adjuvant tirofiban after unsuccessful intra-arterial thrombolysis of acute ischemic stroke: preliminary experience in 16 patients","doi":"10.1007/s00234-011-0939-y","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00234-011-0939-y","venue":"Neuroradiology"}

The simulation is based on a three-dimensional finite element analysis technique in conjunction with structural mechanics codes and with the acoustic analysis methods. The composite material behavior is assessed at the various composite scales, i.e., the laminate/ply/fiber and matrix constituents, via a nonlinear material characterization model. Sample cases exhibiting nonlinear geometric, material, loading, and environmental behavior of aircraft engine fan blades are presented. Results for deformed shape, vibration frequencies, mode shapes, and acoustic noise emitted from the fan blade are discussed for their coupled effect in hot and humid environments. Results such as acoustic noise for coupled composite-mechanics/heat transfer/structural/vibration/acoustic analyses demonstrate the effectiveness of coupled multidisciplinary computational simulation and the various advantages of composite materials compared to metals.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://watermark.silverchair.com/v005t14a001-92-gt-006.pdf?token=AQECAHi208BE49Ooan9kkhW_Ercy7Dm3ZL_9Cf3qfKAc485ysgAAAfwwggH4BgkqhkiG9w0BBwagggHpMIIB5QIBADCCAd4GCSqGSIb3DQEHATAeBglghkgBZQMEAS4wEQQMlAeETupnQ8QpW4dQAgEQgIIBr9mMIYURWxxUOMPjLONMvdPUIJ07eFeRc4SjGsza1m62c4yAAqR4RBRbyJdx7E97zEuaZJa4aUJhp_wcmIJczXJ5Bmw5YQKfZRN-yiOPXOO95rs7lz_TUMN8QEyV8pcoRmnZQcy2z6Tvz9jyouaBuBR4svjq4XObQ46p5fbqV6XHJI4oEzD7xqFCYQs0VF-6qiQEszFosLK3DagdA3bKrxXDYrI0BA55CFmfHW8DVE45BgcDBjaIxLAoUheH64c-Wr43MVWN5LPuUkhDd9vwdRHxuentuDWeWBCo6u-WijI7uUtHhXU4jaLE30Cs5HRP1sj0ix3FMFnRsWb9fzSgREUaunyw1Zexy36iy-d8OtDpgjjwHHNUBCyyVr0ULEn7SSjzbtlVEqj4t7rQSwCOs8HsvpMGF-K0wax7o18P4Pr_YEYxvcci7BZ99eiUWItCXK4Gkao0wOQJYh-h6M4CtsWXmAzCmSSn_-kxrSuAt6djOwGiF3HPitjhvhLhd-eAxeDRa3V8kvH1WrVXHKXqIuaC6Jpot97Wi1-YN2iZfdCPrbbWh8qO9vYZgrlNVRCe"],"title":"Coupled multidisciplinary simulation of composite engine structures in propulsion environment","doi":"10.1115/1.2906709","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1115/1.2906709","venue":""}

Understanding the impact of different reputation mechanism design parameters on the resulting market efficiency has thus emerged as a question of theoretical and practical interest. Along these lines, this note studies the impact of the frequency of reputation profile updates on cooperation and efficiency. The principal finding is that, in trading settings with pure moral hazard and noisy ratings, if the per-period profit margin of cooperating sellers is sufficiently high, a mechanism that does not publish every single rating it receives but rather only updates a trader's public reputation profile every k transactions with a summary statistic of a trader's most recent k ratings can induce higher average levels of cooperation and market efficiency than a mechanism that publishes all ratings as soon as they are posted. This paper derives expressions for calculating the optimal profile updating interval k, discusses the implications of this finding for existing systems, such as eBay, and proposes alternative reputation mechanism architectures that attain higher maximum efficiency than the, currently popular, reputation mechanisms that publish summaries of a trader's recent ratings.","inCitations":["4ba69ce84d5668b672721c57f1c13bc6bb043fb5","014b7b2af9c2f4434c37155424084af153799908","f1995228f88886825f57e7bbff3956eea1e322a5","1e168e8b881d8dfebeab7fc3bb7426fd6f766ad4","a79a405326c5e6d4990a5f3e58cf7f0c7c769fb8","6d5763bba9ca99a6ca8c936e749265bf1be7467e","33e83222fc84d04e27865ffaf21006ec899b1286","74c5f6c3417cf25381fbf800cd276140cf0119ec","55d2f7be86c538ef02dff57e135ca12d0b14239e","e350ea7113b6097fee7432fecfa8e8f4eed952b7","210ed6553d4a9f2bf258e9521c66695abaa42420","a1dad118a47f1e596df7289ca4d151eb07398d3d","cfae5a3c24dd8ab0fca353b36be29e46ea96311c","7daa346991f43e485a42d72b67bf8faa42c8d038","208dc01bb5bfc4ab27fd77459042d9f524683607","a36914878ae7a037a90a34bc5849cee28ae3001e","5d7d066530f323465432e68c334ffa263e3448f4","0e50b7b086f7a15a306ec233af1f175b44494c11","cf9e2692456529aa1166db05fd6bfac8e5ffab1c","37fc35f600818a465b4022ab275b2ddaf469eff6","0d6e6b613617e54e7d7e8f30c41087e17ca984a9","7a5c42cf29c095388e8e38ea3efe9fe3c5969bbd","82beaa4dea1c90199da46d486ca8c85d476c05ad","695c7afbafcdb75fbb8321b08a9a49223a1a6ab2","a5119ae609429f773035b2c62164c0a44993749c","500f2264fd9c0775f7fb3706125a2eced2d48711","7967f96f4d60e93c06471e8c6ebbbb15347ef709","49724abfbc69fafafbd2ba3c26d6a903db6f50bb","5eed853f1ce084445bea8d24f5e1429b3cb68891","d74c66b7bae9ea253bd8454abdb38e83afa40e35","27c3b6da932ca953e37abdce012adbe620c0c5da","12f3cbdd93ef47b36594fa567106c5bc0c6ff0f7","76c3be1cf1f1020fe60da9394e09a21023ebd420","1bef5af6fd73f9575d4784bb0f04090cc556b6a3","3a065292cbb901eae3595aae9c8d59fba76fe404","38f6d767eb25fe295c0608bdd5aa97d71b41e9de","863958c8ea4f0874ca7f0f6fee2cf18a14fc0eb6","7f8a27a0abc57235d8526ef1e90e6c282842dda9","65ad023b7a8cb377e858cfd7d81cf096e2ff9bce","d1d5dcb82307d3f6ab0f03c7d69d96e5636730db","0c5d478a3fd215ec05c41d57364a17dfc43a0fd6","69da3bb04fd9be97842887420d762756525402ca","05ccee9cfe7b9b8757ac4656ed4ae4bcc63e5a64","e4cdd00bff19b9152c3ceed85e70882c197bed43","5790ad2024e028556ec9db207cbc5ae3263906f8","ae2a2d9773651d5424b45deda03f28ba89048e92","71b440304571e65705eb0e2a0c93f7ab3c9e015a","f13c3a935723a4b93d8954d7eb0828a68b2ca450","6935b013157787f9c3db18cfd10de50a0af4dc33","a7f5b4f181899166545d92999f2807bae1a05f08","d1a67200537893a88e6e96cae9757e8113ebcbcd","353e9847c7b8bb9280141321ac8fca0e9d09c662","59f436f9e2d9ffc394568add768b546ea1c16f0c","5a8dc1df37b71464fee39b29cff7986769a9c9e2","44f409739583292408cdb612dc10efff0a1f5c77","7260c1af1639155c3961e01649b6f050b8987bab","7e71f4d7fab00e7fdcaed414fef6ff57c4eb9a5b","cff1784ef88c4fab64a08f31a31da467a3ca6f37","803a6ce4f67317ee17f89c3624e6d31339b999ec","af184970541e3162a9affcf8ad49f70e7bc8e552","cc06118ff767c04a62ffa96963416a89c476128b","7403fcddf1b3eac2ffb001bbdc536a5088f24b50","38f9c1c10800f0dd4ab1513879b15025eaed2006","7a15f6f96fb0cfbb6a5df1658d5dd39d1c39bb2f","14d482123b6932c0f2c5ef8e49f767d40c70fff7","37d92f8aa992e3c66b2f9aa4d346ae15b2fd2300","2f5604c89c08f0f5c144f1d82ede786b31220bb0","2e8ae874ef65681978339b8ee395533d1b67969e","ee0c2876f1d84a5db0c817b1c21e84ccfb9070ba","4b0e7c4af77ebfe23309e4ce465a3ff20418a994","c4abba288099d7e50efd77a7bccab16d8d922b75","0553524dcf43cc6a95c424bcc7472fbdd76d366d","428d1fe1ded8b20c3e98d107fe5febbe14c3b560","105f64c72ec14828572c733fd65816b9882a6a52","ac52aebfe1c1a986a8f30a9725780e8ae0dcf914","6e92ac7ed94ce08614784086edb317933a68e3c8","ee209e6a6f1b498adea83dedac203ad18e2c157c","a205680ef0ced5d269cd19af25ed4c5157de647a","6f6eafdfe7148e317391df6e5f5c992b61e6014f","6bc43dda6a683505d8b59e494b55a1d84f732d23","9103d17ddc8bc3a37850048192d25520874f49dd","5adcb818f99749d2bc8a219c5a5f65631876b07d","f67e4344b977e3fa4582b7bb71f7b8457035bcf2","cc3403c8fbcf149aa3d14fe5b78c8a3b630a3e98","c3e67f44375c6921c6bcb9d242a980173d081eba","c611ed9ee92e7cca8fe117a57946820fd08f4125","f164a16cdd305be2661fd297c514f7f29d85c1cc","ee2bbc70e08a5e10e7b3a3bef39afda86c8904e5","9fb40c68b211879eb3ef03f32693a3c00d08914b","612d0e15689a1ebf9867efae55db4e59b3dec0c9","07ac4275b83abdf09ae04790e930d9d763f1164b","0a3c1166c1ae620697717bba6bcc78a97e0c61dd","3689f381b76e7338776754cf81b85116d531c819","403d42c842386d2b0360b5106a8df91202604c10","138d662fb184302dc7b4a26a41432116ffa40353","9d368bd868970f96d18e7d1898ea0e82ea4d8c1f","ca0dc4123c90a93f48b56ff953f38b167725fa9e","eaf9f766abaf0c11202d201afde33d184840c90f","1503e891b9ab835f316a3d4a3f522bff59e1c542","faaf0b351194b4cc150775b495a327c84696ca0e","8e69c19aea986cac308979cff74cca9248d58dfc","c27f87725429b912faa693e8a4d133ac1c7a20de","bd95aef674963b3aabfb9b09138baf242282eadc","88483acd5042603d2fd3976e91683b0d10fd2e25","118da2656529b492a6f279018bb7d9381b00ced0","311fdaaa84c1dcfc563556226a13ce96122484e8","14caaaae07f93e95878bd35da31b9832044fe726","9346ec5fe718973b739201b30d93168ba972657b"],"pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1287/isre.1060.0092","http://www.rhsmith.umd.edu/faculty/cdell/papers/howoften.pdf"],"title":"How

These changes are made to ensure the survival of firms, exploit opportunities created by difficulties facing other firms, or take advantage of temporary falls in the opportunity cost of initiating and carrying out changes. This line of argument suggests that we should expect to see firms making major changes in their investments in human capital, and in their industrial relations practices. Our results are only partially consistent with this view. What seems to be clear from the data generated by our surveys is that firms are not reluctant to make changes in their bargaining strategies and industrial relations systems. This should be no surprise. Unlike investments in plant and equipment, these changes do not require much cash, and the opportunity cost of making them is much lower in recessions than in booms. However, the observed changes in union recognition have not occurred primarily in firms that were severely affected by the recession. Increases in pay decentralization and reorganization of work-force arrangements were no more likely to be initiated by distressed firms than by firms only moderately affected by the recession. It follows, then, that the retreat of UK unionism observed during the 1990–3 recession was, in the main, a continuation of existing secular trends. The mild acceleration in the pace of change revealed by our survey may be cyclical, but the trend is unlikely to be reversed as recovery gathers pace.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Did the Retreat of UK Trade Unionism Accelerate during the 1990–1993 Recession?","doi":"10.1111/j.1467-8543.1995.tb00420.x","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-8543.1995.tb00420.x","venue":""}

Among the most prevalent effects of diabetes is atherosclerosis, which in turn is driven in part by inflammation. Both insulin and Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNFα) increase the presence of Vascular Cellular Adhesion Molecule-1 (VCAM-1) expression. The aim of this study is to determine the effects of downregulating Extracellular signal-Regulated Kinase-2 (ERK2) and Akt on insulin and TNFa-stimulated VCAM-1 expression.MethodsHere we begin to define the relationships between ERK2 and Akt regulation of insulin and TNFα-stimulated VCAM-1 expression in Rat Arterial Endothelial Cells (RAEC) by transfecting RAEC with ERK2 and Akt RNA interference (RNAi) and then treating these cells with insulin (10 nM) or TNFα (10 ng/mL) alone or in combination.ResultsWestern blot analyses, flow cytometry and confocal microscopy were used to determine changes in VCAM-1 expression within the above-stated parameters. Cells transfected with ERK2 or Akt RNAi plasmids increased insulin and TNFα-stimulated VCAM-1 total protein expression significantly (P < 0.05) greater than that seen in mock transfected cells and expressed cell surface VCAM-1 greater than that seen in mock transfected cells as indicated by flow cytometry and confocal microscopy. Nevertheless, the decrease of both kinases did not increase insulin or TNFα-stimulated VCAM-1 expression above that seen when one or the other RNAi was present.ConclusionsTaken together, our results demonstrate that ERK2 and Akt may be negative regulators of insulin and TNF-α stimulated VCAM-1 and that their loss or down regulation might upregulate VCAM-1 expression and contribute to vascular disease.","inCitations":["30dbdebf3fc17bf05a1fababaf29c2c8261ca629","5537ef9c64cad971f9d363dd23b6f654c2f05b56","df459be5ae05936dfc8f445e99f9ab561b25e490"],"pdfUrls":["https://journal-inflammation.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s12950-016-0115-6?site=journal-inflammation.biomedcentral.com"],"title":"ERK2 and Akt are negative regulators of insulin and Tumor Necrosis Factor-α stimulated VCAM-1 expression in rat aorta endothelial cells","doi":"10.1186/s12950-016-0115-6","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12950-016-0115-6","venue":"Journal of Inflammation"}

Sjögren's syndrome is also an autoimmune disease characterized by the destruction of the lacrimal and salivary glands that leads to keratoconjunctivitis sicca and xerostomia. But it is a very rare case that a patient with Sjögren's syndrome developed IDDM. We present a case of a 65-year old woman with Sjögren's syndrome who developed diabetic ketoacidosis due to IDDM. Recent studies have revealed that there was molecular mimicry between glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) and coxsackievirus. Furthermore, some reports have shown that sialadenitis was represented in IDDM model mice. This case shows the possibility that a causal relationship between IDDM and Sjögren's syndrome may exist.","inCitations":["e54104ad1f4ac5d8059748f2e875b83aa47db3bb","b6b58af2d3b381984a838ba48cebda9d5841203b","64da15d70334b24bac6e82b148dacaac758494b6"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"[A case of an old woman with Sjögren's syndrome associated with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus].","doi":"","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"Ryumachi.

Together with the Greek version of STAI scale, the patients also completed the anxiety subscale from the Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale (HAD).\n\n\nOBSERVATIONS\nFactor analysis yielded a three-factor solution, explaining 47.143% of the variance. Cronbach alpha for three scales was between 0.729 and 0.852. Inter-scale correlations were moderate-to-high and ranged from 0.282 to 0.563 (p < 0.0005, p < 0.005). The assessment of the relationships among the Greek STAI scales and HAD-Anxiety showed statistically significant correlations between them (r ranged between 0.428 and 0.596, p < 0.0005). The test/retest reliability of scale (Pearson's 'r'), showed that the coefficient agreement ranged between 0.85 and 0.90 (p < 0.0005). Univariate analysis revealed significant correlations between female gender, metastasis, performance status, chemotherapy, mild opioids and low education level with increased anxiety.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThese results support that the Greek version of STAI is an instrument with satisfactory psychometric properties, and is a valid research tool for Greek cancer patients.","inCitations":["be25ef4f16d046b35f11dc994af458f297c19567","a3bc6cea4260e4b321b6ee206ce4d05aa8de0752","b672224853c04659407cf3ab32a11c19c0d3f070","0e20354f2e5a6eb3473d61d3e739d605b0f71ae3","e9e61a9c90345f520da08791dc9b44bed2305381","1cbdae93f7b5993fc241619d8911f19ea55ec82b","b1293d70f14235100954432fa98052ba296d383d"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"The psychometric properties of the Greek version of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory in cancer patients receiving palliative care.","doi":"10.1080/08870440802340172","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1080/08870440802340172","venue":"Psychology & health"}

We show that the macroscopic behaviour of the interface can be described, to leading order in [Copf ], in terms of well-defined continuum quantities, even though the complicated fluid motion in the neighbourhood of the contact line cannot. The key is that contact-angle hysteresis makes it possible to isolate the viscous stress singularity at the contact line, since for a sufficiently slowly moving fluid—fluid interface all the movement of the contact line occurs in a time much shorter than the macroscopic timescale. The effective ‘slip length’ for the macroscopic description is shown to be velocity dependent and equal to a [Copf ] −1 , where a is the wavelength of the roughness on the solid surface. Finally, we consider surfaces with two-dimensional random roughness, and argue that they too would exhibit velocity dependent ‘slip lengths’, though the velocity dependence would be stronger in this case. These results combined with earlier work (Jansons 1985) explain why observed ‘slip lengths’ can be much larger than roughness dimensions, and why the degree of ‘stick-slip’ decreases with increasing speed.","inCitations":["e08688a08ef8c833f4fbf26a5ed45910268b3598","44e02a8e56288a71fbe32a47ca2aae213a71687f","ebc6bf29aed458c292c91a371d6bbb9d76159753","2a308435769964d7bf53eb2862bdef56bfa155b3","b2b65ad9b3d54b270bc971a99cba93c7587b005a","f12ae5f24bc2150c0e35bd9e862c09177dc68c3a"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Moving contact lines at non-zero capillary number","doi":"10.1017/S0022112086002860","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1017/S0022112086002860","venue":""}

Con el control de lazo abierto, los sistemas de impresion (generalmente de gama baja) son susceptibles a factores que no se miden ni corrigen, tales como fallas en los accesorios mecanicos, atascos en el sistema de movimiento, perdida de pasos en los motores y perturbaciones externas, que pueden causar desplazamiento de capas, produciendo piezas defectuosas. \nEl trabajo reportado fue desarrollado bajo la metodologia de diseno concurrente, e ilustra la investigacion y resultados en la implementacion del sistema de posicionamiento de lazo cerrado de la boquilla de extrusion y de la plataforma de construccion de la impresora UAO 3DP, construida con tecnologia por extrusion de filamento, bajo estandares Open-Source. Esto se realiza utilizando el microcontrolador ATmega 2560 que lee senales enviadas desde la placa controladora de la impresora -correspondiente a las posiciones deseadas-, y las compara con las senales procedentes de tres encoders opticos lineales ubicados en los ejes x, y y z de la impresora, que proporcionan la posicion relativa actual del cabezal y la plataforma de impresion. \nDurante el proceso se disena una prueba estandar con el fin de realizar comparaciones del proceso de impresion en lazo abierto y cerrado. Los resultados demuestran la capacidad del sistema para monitorear la posicion relativa deseada y actual del cabezal y la plataforma de construccion durante el proceso de impresion, ademas asegura su correcto posicionamiento ante posibles perturbaciones corrigiendo la desviacion de la trayectoria deseada mediante una estrategia que calcula el error entre los datos recibidos y genera una accion de control que contrarresta el efecto de perturbaciones de manera independiente en cada eje, lo que se refleja en la desviacion maxima de 0,5mm en la geometria impresa en una capa ante la perturbacion establecida en la prueba disenada. \nMonitorear continuamente los movimientos durante todo el proceso de impresion garantiza un posicionamiento mas preciso frente a posibles perturbaciones, lo que significa un importante ahorro de tiempo, material y dinero.

The method was applied for stable isotope analysis of HCHs in possible food webs from soil to plants, and to animals. Isotope compositions of HCHs in cow/buffalo milk and dung, wild animal livers and seal blubber were obtained and compared to the sources of HCHs. The magnitude of isotope enrichment demonstrated the potential of CSIA for analyzing reactive transport processes of HCHs in the food web.

The score of depressive symptoms among girls (1.777 ± 0.550) was higher than boys (1.647 ± 0.512). The regression model-including demographic, psychological, and social factors-explained 38.3% of depressive symptoms among boys and 27.9% among girls. Body image satisfaction was the most powerful factor related to depressive symptoms in both boys and girls. Gender-differentiated factors identified in this study such as demographic, psychological, and social factors need to be studied while planning gender-tailored intervention programs to help relieve depressive symptoms among multicultural adolescents.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Factors Related to Depressive Symptoms Among Multicultural Adolescents in Korea.","doi":"10.1177/1059840520906591","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1177/1059840520906591","venue":"The Journal of school nursing : the official publication of the National Association of School Nurses"}

Dyson focussed on the knowledge of mechanics as an essential tool with which to distinguish between important and unimportant, correct and incorrect, cause and effect, possible and impossible (Dyson. 1978, 12). From his principal concept Dyson was ahead of most biomechanists of his time, who often reduced the human body to the simple CM-model dealing with sport skills, because he added to the mechanical laws other ones (e. g. biological laws) which also play an important part in the analysis and optimization f human motion . This paper, as a tribute to the applied research of Geoffrey Dyson and the general concept of applied research in sports biomechanics. will discuss biomechanical concepts to identify and explain limiting factors of jumping in different sports on the background of their usefulness for coaching and performance optimization. Before dealing with the different approaches the great variety of jumps in sports will be structured and organized. As criteria for this purpose the different surfaces (non-elastics vs elastic) the different initial mechanical conditions (with or without angular momentum. large or small amount of CM's velocity), and the geometry of take-off (one-leg take-off or double support take-off) are chosen. From the biomechanical concepts concerning jumping events the CM-strategy, the segmental contribution of linear and angular momenta concept, and the energy transfer through segments purpose are controversially discussed and applied to the different categories of jumping. As far as the practical validation of such models and concepts is concerned this should be explained by the example of a longitudinal study of the take-off for a double backward somersault in floor gymnastics. In this project it could be shown that the prognosed influence of initial angular and linear momenta prior to take-off is finally confirmed. Thus the used model proved valid, and could help to understand the importance of pre-take-off activity, but it can not explain the general take-off mechanism. For this purpose the energy transfer concept seems to be the state of the art and will be explained in the different jumping categories. Distinct differences of strategy for take-off from rigid and from elastic surfaces could be discovered. The energy transfer concept can contribute to a fundamental understanding of lower extremity function and the influence of the arms and the lead leg in jumping. The major advantage of this segmental procedure in comparison e. g. to a CM's-concept is considerable, and it provides a chance of bridging the gap between the theoretical sciences and the application of their results to the practical training process. And this has always been one of the principal objectives of the late Geoffrey Dyson.","inCitations":["e848e98ce78f930b87e5de49383b69fae87ed40b","c1f5f0b29fdec502cd057b1d04c3ad1af4c3a514"],"pdfUrls":["https://ojs.ub.uni-konstanz.de/cpa/article/download/2436/2288"],"title":"Biomechanical Considerations on Jumping in Sports an Approach to a Fundamental Understanding","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

GWAS loci are also enriched in expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs), thus suggesting that most risk variants alter gene expression. However, because causal variants are difficult to identify, and cis-eQTLs occur frequently, it remains challenging to identify specific instances of disease-relevant changes to gene regulation. Here, we used a novel joint likelihood framework with higher resolution than that of previous methods to identify loci where autoimmune-disease risk and an eQTL are driven by a single shared genetic effect. Using eQTLs from three major immune subpopulations, we found shared effects in only ∼25% of the loci examined. Thus, we show that a fraction of gene-regulatory changes suggest strong mechanistic hypotheses for disease risk, but we conclude that most risk mechanisms are not likely to involve changes in basal gene expression.","inCitations":["00e859984a7fbbecd88df6ce81803d33a147db36","01da92be2979bbe0542ca5bc5e75a4698ddf98bb","7f3e385b80caf0c5bca1aee0ba7d4282449c9a48","b8570bb220b772e974cbc8256baf7bf2127393b7","efba0bfdebb7965b087460de4abecbadfbc284af","b71ccfddb5d5c4a9a831d5d792e49c628c5c2f38","003a3ff4b5adf544423b1249512615025a5d0667","ad6fcbc88ab159396157362dcb25d4e63b43a854","5d9977e01b5467958c0adb3c865db94be3db28db","9f949384ef1e579a7c131fd095721e8352f1e2b2","a08690c73aefd99eab4f592925eddcee3dc708fa","5ef8cdcc00b36c1261be02d035c0ae239a1e9c52","1c1e2ee66caa446e870b8c9dbb24d0d0ce4ce661","4e9ec09bc93bf2c5b393a0187676163e567b4a10","53841beb1071615b93814f2047cc4d190384145f","f7006e9a6baf16193a2762d4e2343611e863aa24","9705d7f62ab71cab781f813a94584a0698ac8029","50ece9e17ab2d3a966c7bed480a8a3fe29a12fca","1239b88111a5f1c20622d58406fb15bf02c31947","af7487dd62385f43f657da3c08d7165b19a46c59","95fd390ca50f34ade3af5298773025b8eadfb369","72374ec8df43f567b42a307e739bf919cf50c4d9","5574ce4f2e48d8f8d53b92abf64a74d92ae4c80e","ec0b1c7e1ec9c4e6262e953ca4e75cb241bcb853","08da9dd639d0981a9470e9ab42e01374430bc8a6","08c8383033e73b5aa7bee3306e4e91cbd16ae672","eee871891747ca2e62ea7e696992552f9ac208a3","ceb597a1b015c3cb3457444a5d112bfd1408b476","bab55bb8d64ad0e6f6f3320860f8808503d80c34","28e2a40e8863ccd08bc8336a91df11a892d4ea02","f99026a53f82699714c8431873ba294b23f0d3c6","3c07cb824410ca2068543826ee6f2b98bb27966b","974cce12a3ebb7ed3fe8292768e7ec7fc78c0207","ca12afe7a33cfcd6f4a43656453ad7a3b0c881a6","b4c0f23551061782e45278ba1aec9bb328dd6f3d","d4281605daf472acfa68a357b3765fb3f2f522c6","035fe108b2cd1427782eab274efecc2a9b957b89","f701792ec2c728280fbdb90f7b790c82cf0ea1a7","18173733589d29abde2c30900dfea6ec5ca5e1d2","79b7c839a0b445734710914a6f08b6512bcba802","7a14af0da06acf264ac0b6da8bcdfbef309dc06e","cf032d463faca2eaa5e7cbc72ee06b0d24f49f17","360b07440833370b1409fa63e22e0d45169d97ec","4f23666e3b21b3ceba7aba27253699d580de89db","d73314211fb11adf1ed7b71af01e1416ba2d4113","c96e04c7a85be6b80594134da97fd3e69c25176d","f9636c5b3b8d5b2769f240681b944d7a5598ecb6","6c8f803f736a11ca9b04cdca46651b8942d57cac","9578f7eee2215c9f7865a80a3a874b3645f18c05","8a22cea2ba8ce3772a650d4d3e62ebb783cd3e1e","90bc9cfe54b708fc4d0ceee8921ee112f60942bc","0aedc8226f1684f9fcbce2179f5dbab93a58ed51","23bbcd433e4e3414f502628fc245ad572fff3846","5c5c960fe4232ff543a519c602ffd52c5c6667c8","f815dba2fa07f452ee47ff313ba6f684b43564d4","4b279de39e3511f02749cef43ed39ee5305937f9","bab87b8f8162f145d6fa77e090026e9c756ed6de","44b1eaf62937ff79ecb5f865f2a92ac5f5257620","dc22442d59a68a8b3d92fe80741e3dad866e7c94","3b251126ddc7f6fe3e235fd9239b8ef17d107ee9","67402a13a158dc0842ec62ed0ad7383b4f38de3e","125d27da849ffe6052454a76f97677367970e7f4","aa2fbefdc6a868ffa19cf9e736b0b16b569baf5b","d949964b625cecaace3e92c20b7f1e9f8b0b9231","4d7efd299069b3b77d483d67ea2590e82a98a2c8","697ce6a5158c018dce57ba9e211e57279bfe471a","f6faad8bc9daefaa51f16aca0870a8556cb43976","b0635eb94159c3143891c9e0b115dafbf6c503d4","4f475bc681b9a99446a9ae9fb16dec1f0d523616"],"pdfUrls":["https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/34375208/5374036.pdf?sequence=1"],"title":"Limited statistical evidence for shared genetic effects of eQTLs and autoimmune disease-associated loci in three major immune cell types","doi":"10.1038/ng.3795","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1038/ng.3795","venue":"Nature Genetics"}

The Galileo orbit takes the spacecraft through the heart of the outer radiation belt, while the low levels of geomagnetic shielding throughout the orbit expose the spacecraft to intermittent intense fluxes of protons during solar energetic particle events. In the Galileo constellation, two environmental monitoring units (EMUs) are currently flying in two different orbital planes. These units monitor the radiation environment and provide critical information related to hazards for the host spacecraft and its payload. In this paper, we present the results from the analysis of the surface charge collecting plates and the proton telescope sensors. The performed numerical calibration of the EMU sensors and the application of novel unfolding and in-flight cross-calibration techniques allow the calculation of high-quality proton and electron differential fluxes. The creation of a high-quality, long-term EMU electron flux data set, is a step forward toward the improved characterization of medium earth orbit (MEO) environment through the update of the existing or the development of new radiation environment models.","inCitations":["086827514b45a6af78fab65571443c240de61fd4"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Data Exploitation of New Galileo Environmental Monitoring Units","doi":"10.1109/TNS.2019.2915686","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNS.2019.2915686","venue":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science"}

In many countries across the continent, military rulers and leaders of one-party states begrudgingly allowed multi-party elections for the first time in decades. Ghana was emblematic of this \"third wave\" of democratization in Africa. (1) In the spring of 1992, a new constitution was approved by popular referendum, which led Flight Lieutenant J.J. Rawlings and his Provisional National Defense Council (PNDC) to remove the ban on party politics and prepare for elections by the end of the year. Opposition parties gained recognition and were permitted to open offices and hold rallies. Furthermore, official restrictions on the media were relaxed, and the state-run monopoly on information was overrun with new radio stations and newspapers. The early optimism about \"the winds of democracy\" blowing across Africa has been tempered by events on the ground, however. (2) With devastating election violence in Kenya in 2008, and returns to authoritarian rule by coup and constitutional manipulation in Cote d'Ivoire, Mali, Nigeria, and elsewhere, many scholars have understandably turned their attention away from studying the conditions for democratic transition toward analyzing the factors that support democratic consolidation. (3) At this point in time, Ghana is often held up as a model of democratic consolidation. Indeed, the Obama administration intended to communicate precisely this message with Ghana chosen as the President's first head-of-state visit in Africa in July 2009. (4) Observers have noted that while the initial elections were imperfect, Ghana has now completed six multi-party elections and two peaceful transfers of power to the opposition, even remaining calm in the context of a razor-thin victory for the opposition in December 2008 and protracted court battles over results in December 2012. (5) While many political scientists have focused on explaining the dynamics of party politics and voting behavior at the national level during these highly contested electoral periods, this paper shifts the lens to explore how Ghanaians think about participating in politics on an everyday basis at the local level. (6) In particular, do they conceptualize their role as citizens or clients? Hence, this paper explores the meaning and everyday practice of democracy on the ground to ordinary people in Ghana outside of and between heated national elections. In particular, the paper examines a critical turning point in the late 1990s, immediately prior to the first alternation of power to the opposition, to see how Ghanaians thought about participation in politics before the political system had become a more consolidated democracy and widely considered a model of success on the continent. The paper intentionally does not focus on the most recent empirical data on political behavior from Ghana, as its objective is to make a broader, conceptual point: it is crucial for scholars to study how concepts of political participation--whether they be based on notions of clientelism or citizenship, or both--have been constituted by Ghanaians over time at the local level. Indeed, while the democratic governance of Ghanaian politics in 2014 may not be representative of the continent as a whole, the political period highlighted in this paper from the late 1990s is more typical of the hybrid regimes experienced by many Africans today. The paper begins by comparing the literatures on citizenship and clientelism to see how scholars conceptualize the key differences between the two. Then, the paper analyzes the sub-national variations in public opinion within Ghana from the Afrobarometer Project survey in 1999 and 2008.
