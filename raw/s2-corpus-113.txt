The American University of Nigeria's (AUN's) restaurant has a barrier to duplication of data in the computer files within the business processes which causes discrepancies, that results to waste of storage space on the existing system due to non-database application used, it is difficult to collect customer's weekly or monthly transactions because data could not be shared easily within the business processes. Although, the most commonly use of system in restaurant business is the point-of sale system (POS) terminals. Hence, in this paper the researchers have developed a Data Driver Transaction processing system (DD- TPS) for the AUN's restaurant with integrated modules for POS, payroll management, credit card and inventory control.

Using a prospective cohort (n=104,375), we aimed to (1) determine characteristics of affected children, (2) describe effects on health insurance coverage and access to needed health care, and (3) model the causal relationship between this new policy, known determinants of health care access, and receipt of needed health care.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe identified a stratified random sample of children shortly after the DRA was implemented and used state records and surveys to compare three groups: children denied Medicaid for inability to document citizenship, children denied for other reasons, and children accepted for coverage. To combat survey nonresponse, we used Medicaid records to identify differences between responders and nonrespondents and created survey weights to account for these differences. Weighted simple and multivariable logistic regression described the complete, originally identified population.\n\n\nRESULTS\nChildren denied Medicaid for inability to document citizenship were likely to be US citizens, were medically and socially more vulnerable than their peers, and went on to have gaps in health insurance coverage and unmet health care needs. The DRA led to persistent loss of insurance coverage, which decreased access to needed health care. Having a usual source of care was an effect modifier in this relationship.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nOur findings demonstrate the negative consequences of the DRA and support the use of automated methods of citizenship verification allowed under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.","inCitations":["0d306117f18f4a35cd12d4b1358d70880752bc87"],"pdfUrls":["https://pdxscholar.library.pdx.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1002&context=soc_fac&httpsredir=1&referer=","https://pdxscholar.library.pdx.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1002&context=soc_fac"],"title":"Citizenship documentation requirement for Medicaid eligibility: effects on Oregon children.","doi":"","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"Family medicine"}

Significant right-hand asymmetry was found for gestures which depict or represent (motor primary movements,p less than .01) but not for nonrepresentational speech primacy movements. In general, field-independents had greater right-hand asymmetry than field-dependents for object-focused movements, whereas field-dependents showed more left-hand asymmetry of self-touching.

Apraxia is a major feature of the corticobasal syndrome associated with nonlevodopa-responsive, typically asymmetric parkinsonism. Mild apraxia may also be seen in Parkinson’s disease, at least in later stages of the disease. Furthermore, patients with Alzheimer’s disease or posterior cortical atrophy are prone to develop apraxia during their disease course. However, apraxia may be difficult to dissect from other motor (e.g., dystonia and bradykinesia in corticobasal syndrome) or cognitive (e.g., dysexecutive or semantic memory deficits in Alzheimer’s disease) dysfunction. Therefore, the ecological significance of apraxia in neurodegenerative disorders may not always be obvious. Although treatment protocols for apraxia have been developed in stroke, there is little information on the management of apraxia in neurodegenerative disorders.

These spreaders take advantage of the anisotropic thermal properties of natural graphite. Natural graphite exhibits a high thermal conductivity in the plane of the sheet combined with a much lower thermal conductivity through the thickness of the sheet. As a result, a natural graphite sheet can function as both a heat spreader and an insulator and can be used to eliminate localized hot spots in electronic components. In some cases, a natural graphite heat spreader can replace a conventional thermal management system consisting of a heat sink and cooling fan. This paper examines the properties of natural graphite heat spreaders and the application of these spreaders to thermal management problems in laptop computers. The thermal and mechanical properties of natural graphite heat spreaders are presented along with a discussion of how those properties are measured. The use of a natural graphite heat spreader to reduce the touch temperature in a laptop computer is presented. Both experimental techniques and numerical models are used to examine performance of the heat spreader in this application.","inCitations":["f73201a1ab60f800d18187b47e99d3eb912bd404"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.graftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Thermal-Performance-of-Natural-Graphite-Heat-Spreaders.pdf"],"title":"California USA Interpack 2005-73073 THERMAL PERFORMANCE OF NATURAL GRAPHITE HEAT SPREADERS","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

A previous long-term study covering ascending brown trout (Salmo trutta L.) through the fishway at Hunderfossen dam concluded that the fishway inflicted stabilizing selection towards mediumsized trout. But the hydropower regulation has created at least three other major obstacles for migration that could influence selection regimes. A three-year mark (n=316) and recapture (n=92) study was thus performed to more specifically address efficiency and selectivity of the fishway. The overall efficiency of the fishway was 29 % and varied between years from 21 to 39 %. The individual delay varied between 6 and 77 days. The experiment did not yield support for stabilizing selection favouring medium-sized trout. However, there was a lower probability of trout with body lengths smaller than 60 cm to enter the fishway compared to larger trout. Gender, origin or degree of secondary sexual characters influenced neither the probability of observing recaptures in the fishway nor the obser ved delay. Several other factors driving the previously reported stabilizing selection are highlighted by addressing a wider spatial scale covering a range of migratory obstacles where size selection may apply. The effect of ontogenetic body size development and iteroparity on selection patterns is discussed, and it is concluded that stabilizing body size selection caused by a semi-passable and size selective obstacle seems less likely to occur with equal strength among iteroparous compared to semelparous fish species.","inCitations":["b267acfacefa39210d6c82956a48b5b0f83f2442"],"pdfUrls":["https://brage.nina.no/nina-xmlui/bitstream/handle/11250/2631718/MusethEfficiencyVann2019pdf.pdf?isAllowed=y&sequence=1"],"title":"Efficiency of a fishway on brown Trout (Salmo trutta) spawning populations","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

The parametric instability is investigated, and the growth rate is obtained. In the kinetic regime, the growth rate for the parallel decay instability increases with the heavy ion content, but the growth rate for the reverse decay is independent of the latter since the perpendicular wavelength is much larger than the ion gyroradius. It decreases with the heavy ion content when the perpendicular wavelength is of the order of the ion gyroradius. It is also found that in the short perpendicular wavelength limit, the growth rate is only weakly affected by the heavy ions. On the other hand, in the inertial regime, for both parallel and reverse decay cases, the growth rate decreases as the number of heavy ions becomes large.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Nonlinear interaction and parametric instability of kinetic Alfvén waves in multicomponent plasmas","doi":"10.1063/1.4796054","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1063/1.4796054","venue":""}

I track this development from inception. I specifically examine how the central Bank of Japan (BOJ) is proceeding now to withdraw Japan from the zero interest rate policy. Specifically covered are the last two years in which central bank policy changed from quantitative easing to interest rate targeting. I present evidence to show how Japan's zero interest rate policy and the evolution of Yen carry trade activity coincided with a reduction in risk premiums throughout the world. I also show how the withdrawal of the Yen carry trade had a temporary impact on those risk premiums in May and June of 2006 and January and February of 2007. Estimates of the size of financial markets impacts are included.

A new intraurethral self-retaining device (ISRD) was made of medical grade silicone and it was inspired by similar catheters that use sliding disks to adjust or fix tubes used to drain the bladder. Patients were randomized into two groups (experimental group [GI]-ISRD vs control group [GII]-CIC). The evaluation was performed at the time of enrollment and 6 months after treatment. Intervention was initiated from the antisepsis of the perineal region and subsequent introduction of the device through the external urethral meatus. The primary outcome was quality of life (QOL). Urinary tract infections (UTIs) episodes, data on urodynamic parameters, adverse effects and number of diapers per day.\n\n\nRESULTS\nA total of 177 subjects were analyzed. We found a significant improvement on QOL analysis in the ISRD group (P < .01).

It addresses issues associated with resolving the procedural and administrative problems involved in selecting a panel of experts, in eliciting informed judgments about the degree of technological advance on relevant projects, and in designing a survey questionnaire for measuring those judgments. Three methods of multivariate analysis are described for quantifying and analyzing group judgment data collected from a panel of experts. Those of the methods that are known in earlier literature include multidimensional scaling of individual differences, and subjective probability procedures, including the Bayesian approach. A new procedure, which was developed specifically for this application, involves the use of simultaneous equation system models in which the response (dependent) variables are categorical and unordered.

It has been suggested that increasing systemic flow also may improve splanchnic blood flow in septic patients. The aim of this study was to compare the effects of three commonly used inotropic agents, dopamine, dobutamine, and dopexamine, on systemic (cardiac index), regional (superior mesenteric artery), and local (micro-circulatory) blood flow during septic shock in pigs.\n\n\nMETHODS\nEight pigs were intravenously anesthetized, mechanically ventilated, and exposed to sepsis induced by fecal peritonitis. Cardiac index was measured with thermodilution, superior mesenteric artery flow was measured with ultrasound transit time flowmetry, and microcirculatory blood flow was continuously measured with a six-channel laser Doppler flowmetry in the gastric, jejunal, and colon mucosa as well as in the kidney, pancreas, and jejunal muscularis. Each animal received, in a random-order, crossover design, the three test drugs, one at a time: 5 and 10 microg x kg(-1) x min(-1) dopamine, 5 and 10 microg x kg(-1) x min(-1) dobutamine, and 1 and 2 microg x kg(-1) x min(-1) dopexamine. Administration of each drug at each dose continued for 30 min and was followed by a 40- to 60-min recovery period. A new baseline was taken before the next drug was administered.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAll three drugs significantly increased cardiac index; dopamine by 18%, dobutamine by 48%, and dopexamine by 35%, compared with baseline (P < 0.001 for each). At the same time, superior mesenteric artery flow increased by 33% (P < 0.01) with dopamine and 13% (P < 0.01) with dopexamine, whereas it did not change with dobutamine. Microcirculatory blood flow did not change significantly in any of the organs studied with any of the drugs tested.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nAll the inotropic agents markedly increased cardiac output in this sepsis model. However, increased systemic flow did not reach the microcirculation in the gastrointestinal tract.

The quality of statistical segmentation and registration methods is directly related to the quality of this initial shape fitting, yet the subject is largely overlooked or described in an ad hoc way. This article presents a set of general principles to guide such training. Our novel method is to jointly estimate both the best geometric model for any given image and the shape distribution for the entire population of training images by iteratively relaxing purely geometric constraints in favor of the converging shape probabilities as the fitted objects converge to their target segmentations. The geometric constraints are carefully crafted both to obtain legal, nonself-interpenetrating shapes and to impose the model-to-model correspondences required for useful statistical analysis. The paper closes with example applications of the method to synthetic and real patient CT image sets, including same patient male pelvis and head and neck images, and cross patient kidney and brain images. Finally, we outline how this shape training serves as the basis for our approach to IGRT/ART.","inCitations":["6e8a19049696aac57e898ca05d13aea454c1f11d","819c1362e5fc2b987ed9159f0d1ca74e7a34d0e6","5916484f823dc847a2a0999aae720dfbfdd1f9cb","47cb3edeb5a0d3062bd87d3abdef3fd3ec634412","576b23111e3116ea1d633bfcaa67eb5c0d39d247","9d0dcee75e7ef2f6dca50cfed5f7e2033ae139d1","452c9130dbf7aa0ffd7399fda5907ba4109f2723","ebb157b0fad857439626326c0c9361a194263c72","feffd3a68f3661c1852331ae4f5e8cf3317bd3bd","0f63b4532de1cf8a240a6d7218293f575f6e2ac8","c38cacd5c1bcd6ffccdd3032e1015c1daa29c019","0c4bc47eed6bba0f850ad072d686fd7403c5bdf7","d4392a71702bdafae9e97bb963986b5b3b801dd3","f5bae3db9acc77f425eebb5547c2c980f7052584","ff246911437865a8e1e77532bc85b10b070d2e6d","75bedb585fb30975fecdf6a30c54d70d746d65ae","79da9c45a2d9f98920f4255a5d53426d9ee86d26","734595ef7e0e00c026c2c936c99718db8f011ff2","ed39f3b99f0e692494a6179cf84520097aca6131"],"pdfUrls":["http://midag.cs.unc.edu/pubs/papers/merck.shape.training.1207.pdf","http://www.sci.utah.edu/publications/merck08/Merck_MedPhy2008.pdf","http://www.cs.unc.edu/Research/MIDAG/pubs/papers/merck.shape.training.1207.pdf"],"title":"Training models of anatomic shape variability.","doi":"10.1118/1.2940188","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1118/1.2940188","venue":"Medical physics"}

Findings/Conclusions are: Industrial mobilization does not represent a viable component of national security. (1) The multiplicity of statutory requirements, authorities, and prohibitions is overwhelming, causing serious ambiguity regarding the sufficiency of existing authority and generating confusion regarding responsibilities. This seriously decrements our ability to plan and, if required, manage an industrial mobilization. (2) Current organizations do not have clearly defined responsibilities, are not adequately resourced, and do not have the ability to transition from peacetime planning to wartime execution. (3) No clearly defined mobilization plan or comprehensive planning process exists. Recommendations are: (1) Creation of omnibus legislation--or, at a minimum, improved cross indexing of existing mobilization authority--would assure the sufficiency of mobilization authority, improve the assignment of responsibility, and facilitate the transition, from peacetime planning to wartime execution.

Because mice do not replace teeth, here we used Sorex araneus, the common shrew, as a model to investigate the loss of tooth replacement. Historically, shrews have been reported to initiate the development of several, milk or deciduous teeth but these soon become rudimentary and only the replacement teeth erupt. Shrews thus offer a living example of a derived mammalian pattern where the deciduous tooth development is being suppressed. Based on histological and gene expression analyses of serial sections, we suggest that S. araneus has discernible tooth replacement only in the premolar 4 (P4) position. Both generations of teeth express Shh in the enamel knot and in the inner enamel epithelium. Nevertheless, the deciduous P4 (dP4) is reduced in size during embryogenesis and is eventually lost without becoming functional. Analysis of growth shows that P4 replaces the dP4 in a \"double-wedge\" pattern indicative of competitive replacement where the suppression of the deciduous tooth coincides with the initiation of its replacement. Because activator-inhibitor mechanisms have been implicated in adjacent mouse molars and in transgenic mice with continuous tooth budding, we suggest that evolutionary suppression of deciduous teeth may involve early activation of replacement teeth, which in turn begin to suppress their deciduous predecessors.","inCitations":["d9a9902ddb7a5161d885009b26dfbe413d1acf13","9a89dec7fef3dee2b085eb42f729ceaf9661c317","ca687aa1256b9ff03b047b2c4f916fc766902e91","f65646ed00e3312da11c44d3968d3e7c2e460936","a0aa8cebe8a9f2738cb00b211e841d7d11d70513","26564beaabbfd0c6d8eed7b11e1db063ad21af87","20ff9eefe3864d2b6431eb55c2c104170d1e6992","545fa52fcee5cb0cb33346d7612b6f90ccbee1f5","36393f519e05df91b8ce59f5a16aee4e7b0d34e4","a1b524170bededd2f9bc716393441dd1daf4dc13","bed16cac2872c6012306653e970f835fed80a331","89fa932db4a6f1d92d4275052306362f84cc8e3f","6036c1148160258949acc404da4c9bd54c7854e6","a581fb2ecf852e168209e0372eae46acb4f2cd0d","be74574c5381478a1190628270bd4c94a9c264e9","f591cd8402c6351a7185335c68f77d96dbcc15e2","8bdb08220ebe530fedddc6fab265d904fdf267d1","bcdb396317609c4222cba844d9c8a24ca20a105c","b2c578d7d13cbdca786dc8a1cab56b7c03811cfd","ccb65caa195fa9e808c48138526363f92c3140bc"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.biocenter.helsinki.fi/bi/evodevo/pdf/Jarvinen_ED08.pdf"],"title":"The taming of the shrew milk teeth.","doi":"10.1111/j.1525-142X.2008.00258.x","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1525-142X.2008.00258.x","venue":"Evolution & development"}

Similarly, the \"classical\" model of genetic population structure, which assumed widespread homozygosity of \"wild-type\" alleles, was refuted by research on viability and phenotypic characters, indicating the existence of much genic polymorphism in populations (76). In 1966 the concept of a high level of polymorphism as the normal condition in populations was convincingly established by direct measurements in Drosophila (42) and humans (25). The. acquisition by evolutionary geneticists of electrophoretic and other techniques for demonstrating allelic variation at loci encoding polypeptides permits a new and extensive examination of variation in populations and of genetic differences between races and species. This review of allozymic variation in vertebrates deals with 1. genic variation in populations; 2. local genetic heterogeneity; 3. geographic variation in allele frequencies; 4. genetic similarity among populations and species; and 5. systematic applications of molecular population data.","inCitations":["27e650cb92c1a5dd92cc779f1df8a835971183a1","b0f341f26ffb8d8fe60174714a59eb0f90cd4700","b84cb55cd84fd2b147a21cefda29b8fd5fa68352","d7b9c755a77483b224b67b977f0eef2b3f068fa8","2cb98d50de8583d9180151f47fe0deac87cb5b77","d029eeb9708d4f0ec30d1c388629aa51deabd7c5","c377d11c35df3564839785af39d5888ecf77ce73","078fb290199ac6dfcd00962568dc38657aa29036"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Genetic Variation *4053 among Vertebrate Species","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

In the first stage, the pressure and the velocity by the friction loss in the cavity are calculated by the pressures at the openings of the double skin, which are given by the wind tunnel result for the normal single skin building. Then, velocity pressure is calculated by the velocity.

The Aphen-CdS NCs were dispersed in polymeric monomers to prepare a series of transparent luminescent nanocomposites with excellent thermal stability via in-situ bulk polymerization. The fluorescent properties of the Aphen-CdS NCs were well retained in the polymer matrix. It was found that when the methacrylic acid (MAA) and glycidyl methacrylate (GMA) as the comonomers were introduced into the polymer matrix, the emission peaks of the resultant nanocomposites had a blue shift and the fluorescent intensities also increased due to the interaction between NCs and the polymer matrices.

The combined expanded uncertainty of the density, ρ, pressure, P, temperature, T, and concentration, x, measurements at the 95% confidence level with a coverage factor of k = 2 is estimated to be 0.15%, (0.02 to 0.05) %, 10 mK, and 0.01 mole %, respectively. The critical curve data (TC − x), (PC − x), and (ρC − x), were extracted from the measured PρTx data. The extracted critical curve and direct measured P − x data along the critical isochore-isotherm were used to estimate the value of the Krichevskii parameter for the mixture when 1-propanol is solvent at the critical state. The measured PρTx data were used to calculate excess and partial molar volumes of n-hexane near the critical point of pure 1-propanol.

Methods: We performed a cohort analysis of the 172 subjects who developed pancreatic cancer between 1985 and 1997 (median 10.2 years follow-up) among the 29,048 male smokers, 50–69 years old, who had complete baseline data and participated in the Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-Carotene Cancer Prevention (ATBC) Study. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate multivariable adjusted hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Results: We observed positive associations between pancreatic cancer risk and self-reported history of diabetes mellitus (HR = 2.02, 95% CI 1.17–3.50) and bronchial asthma (HR = 2.16, 95% CI 1.17–3.98). Men having combined occupational and leisure activity greater than at sedentary levels had reduced risk for the cancer; for example those with moderate/heavy activity in both settings showed a HR of 0.42 (95% CI 0.22–0.83). There were no significant associations with other self-reported illnesses, total or HDL (high-density lipoprotein) cholesterol, height, weight, or body mass index. Conclusions: Our data suggest that diabetes mellitus and bronchial asthma predict the subsequent risk of developing pancreatic cancer in male smokers, and that greater physical activity may reduce the risk.","inCitations":["093923ed72ecbad88a29620e8d3073935f71eb93","26abc559ad0fac5885ac8bf86d33d3cd3a317831","c89b24db3b4fc4dc285f3c4262478b406d6bebe1","152530fc02a64aa3fc04bffd9be761823ef5a0e5","023ffa873e4d286f0da1d5436bcd6672c637c633","12be667bb0fd763f5fb69db0b735c551c7e6c86e","6762a808ec7415ac1c20f8c6d5db9cc387822c25","3a3dc250f8e0f3913d1699e661ac5ed284fbaf96","8efb259e6169295b16f1cdeb70e4012dab392791","01e60b81d5bfedd19d689b3d010bec4228c72ecc","205fd3e15b2322b6bf24759e86d89d3c49cba356","5fbb45324de622f49837612d3f7c56b5ce1cf366","f6089f7738435c873ab19a9b4e688bd7260edbc0","1897dfc135ee30a8da58768163dfebd274a87c45","096a2531e19018f9aa2b0cf221d550c8126ef9ea","fe05c02170ce02a2cd066245da31b67ea39b6795","8b62fac0ffba6f0eb24a64f6ddb250024d13a497","9950eea3bd23d309c4584d199539e82e6264f68b","8d334c961d55b6cfe19a9b6bd17840502a8d7e0d","97f99156ebb891a5d4a27e8b178f7bb54680c95c","602949e31322cb6b4a111acb317a4e2612f036cb","5a410318c26eef4d15a4fe490ad8b26265395fac","3d93557dc7360594dc7e70eddf9a157bd637ef74","4165851c786911abc4042f535db43c0f015ec2fd","4fd7d8dab049fbaf19c2cf972bba2a1b7723090d","c009390dd1ea5fcbd82004b77469c272940aa1e0","ce261486feeae9de7ea71a9b39ab664f111c0b6a","1a5073626868439e7d5ab7573e15a4751e288231","3c0cc123ab143c127c91cd7c1830f762e69765e7","2f41a74554a0d3c78311bf2f5aaac1b98ce93b28","ce6fe3cc9fb651efb7e1f25b1f748344caf60674","3e2b8993e588612334383ccf90dcd1368037174d","8fe4ab61b855a38091bcc0d55c874d858ccf87ca","34c464eb13e862ea610559f6500e4b79f64eef58","7fa1cac614ae677aec17227b19e579b792f3252c","1cd63396a10f9a944dfed5ba587fa3382d369990","3971a1943c10b1af00a282bbace235db2d4f30b3","9476e2c0be51ca6e67882a378fc18bce3144372e","4ac6e1b2733a4c53e83afa53c75272a60b819b87","65364a99d0d22b5ee3ce2baac4bf53e9582532b2","1bc6d86cf8926479e224374d7c222d672c50f77a","0f76ac030824b610b3dc9af766c32f3cb71f1b53","e97d0b2b989423ce54f4c0643b62c157f7acf8e9","d07db83471b6ec16336ac27a61ee1bfd3ecf907d","ca700cedd46231fcfb448454bd8ad4447b010d99","54329541e54dae74975b1490900cde66199d066b","3c0b8a44d14c7907d0254040b04853d1cbd5cdcb","3a44a944362e2a90e9b18c580537a4ff66c69b7d","b75fe651b09a5cc6b76719ff5d92328d8d101e50","27e61dd4307321de128cad1b7815c3a2c3ab412d","7a63b3481dfb46e98f3a0d60902e80621d466f11","3512147e7f16175cb93c60bee31fb978c4692273","745aee14663b4a23d0b27ba860e42e47a76354c1","a9ea96dfb3a6ef8cf34b493f91a71771e10e49f6","6ffbbc1a3482fb12e733820a9c742709f4ad460a","88a98a1314a7dd84649cc1bba183fff4554ee31c","e2190a7ca4d017b0bfd8079e2b492291d6fc6c40","3a7702d8570b04f7e4cb273417cc055b964975b7","da1ea2c308d01d5f0ea610ecfc5bd5096fd1067f","a07b057582fc81f2e3651843a827ecf692f9769c","b76e744f3f044e1bb8cece753880dc8e9e55c6f6","1718d7f51ee59c1662c7d0ee5cb1bad0aa21cdfe","f1ec6d39bdf685e832fba821cc128b70d3e9fd36","7b3208b394cfcd94d5a281b880689452733959d4","9e5cd93fa19e2f724faeafffd74c118a61e4d657","25d654721333ef079d39f524f77075e8a269b0a6","d4132b3bc70debf63c306ae3752e9528021a3627","25ebd489bf37fee6f1d2bc25cb5a0222202aa4ac","cd6da7a5d570c146aef94dff7e8b6343444a9345","69f55e0e564fb5a332952b9b334cd664ef383819","e887172f4de5be5ae8304c42c7220f3a673df399","e7154fa5e71d9dc218df1832b02b6f4c7bdb0831","5184d2c2602badfed605fd4042226a91acc4b974","888e7fd2ad2878ccac4578991736d87389aa6396","75f3070441085c0b69b7b5a2201f9f0d84af218a","194bbab837d951dbd84f8534b265a6ef896bfa28","1db8a3aabf7555a69b351e582b50060832c00cf8","6d42569a9838eb4ecccb33150c53c57279217d39","8904ad0f8b33b5e07aa284ae5cef82f0d889699e","7d9922158af4ee7abd9647a2d4c783d67cbf9ee7","6195e0539e4dc92ce8cc433b9c756e942c5a8301","bd9e7533d72cdc2c5d2e62af1e870af1d97121f3","eee00ce467fa9a874b51863e4d687466e96f70b6","9f2d17a068f30b236ead5f6bfd0cdda10155695a","45aa18f57e596442def0d45012ec6ab91eb9c0f9","62b6b2f1b637d6dfa5c4fa39ef33570ce1030c83","c15a6063e1970aa3836ce22ad2842b6546888d65","c5604b23b6d8379da762f83d81d0790efe628d71","4d84661b8a11c2230dbe1cc8fe2e5d979bbf2766"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"A prospective study of medical conditions, anthropometry, physical activity, and pancreatic cancer in male smokers (Finland)","doi":"10.1023/A:1015729615148","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1023/A%3A1015729615148","venue":"Cancer Causes & Control"}

All have common elements but not all of them contribute to the delivery of sustainable living. Here we consider the business models of sustainability in living labs (SusLabs). Specifically we review four active living laboratories that are part of the SusLab North West Europe network. We show that the business cases are different for at least two reasons. One is that each SusLab project has a specific focus even though all are seeking to develop energy efficient innovative products, services or systems. Examples of focus include demonstration projects, knowledge generation through research and business to business development. The other is that each came about for different reasons which might include significant public or private sponsorship, or through academia-business co-creation, and this too is reflected in the business case. We also show that the business cases are not static, but may evolve over time as opportunities are created and as partners develop a clearer understanding of the potential of each SusLab. We propose that, based on a common definition of a SusLab, theoretical considerations and societal needs, as well as insights from the cases, it should be possible to build a business case for a SusLab which draws on knowledge rather than learning-by-doing.","inCitations":["b179b73bd99e65d804f31cb922eb02a2b2083cde","4b56ca0e1fe5f2a510dbe71fd61c9a42ed4018c9","d6777742c22f31800a71350e77bec4013162efc9","c7e457ab3bfdc141741ecccbcc6c8d29db801066","be5158be7a740179a0829bb0e6a5971a0f122c43"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Business Models for Sustainability in Living Labs","doi":"10.1007/978-3-319-33527-8_30","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-33527-8_30","venue":""}

Symmetric matrices are in many ways much simpler to deal with than general matrices. First, as we noted previously, it is not generally true that the roots of the characteristic equation of a matrix are necessarily real numbers, even if the matrix has only real entries. However, if A is a symmetric matrix with real entries, then the roots of its characteristic equation are all real. Example 1. The characteristic equations of 0 1 1 0 and 0 −1 1 0 are λ 2 − 1 = 0 and λ 2 + 1 = 0 respectively. Notice the dramatic effect of a simple change of sign. The reason for the reality of the roots (for a real symmetric matrix) is a bit subtle, and we will come back to it later sections. The second important property of real symmetric matrices is that they are always diagonalizable, that is, there is always a basis for R n consisting of eigenvectors for the matrix.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://www.math.northwestern.edu/~len/LinAlg/chap3.pdf"],"title":"Applications 1.

Human studies indicate that the T cell mediated adaptive immune function including formation of antigen specific antibodies is facilitated by sleep. Along this line, here we aimed to dissociate the effect of sleep and circadian rhythm on circulating interleukin-7 (IL-7) and interleukin-15 (IL-15). These cytokines play a key role in the homeostatic regulation of naïve and memory T cell numbers and are critical for the differentiation of memory T cells. Serum IL-7 concentration and expression of membrane-bound IL-15 (mIL-15) on CD14(+) monocytes were measured in 18 men on two occasions: once during a regular 24-h sleep-wake cycle and another time during a 24-h period of continuous wakefulness. During sleep and especially during late sleep serum IL-7 concentrations were distinctly increased as compared to wakefulness (p<0.05). mIL-15 density on monocytes remained unchanged by sleep. The sleep-dependent increase in IL-7 concentration was associated with increased REM sleep, but did not correlate with concentrations of GH, cortisol or norepinephrine during sleep. The findings concur with the notion of a supportive influence of sleep on T cell function related to formation of T cell memory.","inCitations":["00f1c4b5776ecde5c764ae6cc3016a0267eac99a","25b7a5e334f428f12d7aa581c73b4ca5ba97d4bf","000421b4021ce261dcc6d6402ce0c94910df1c52","cdf22247b0daea4eb3bbad7e3561cb663614b9d9","dfaf85e13051f49b75d01673fa65297c39966a48","c8457969ccd51f1972f51cfefbc796b3573e5a86","05c90795ab8d8ef51f50f4488281fbf12d4b8ed3","cb78e104815417b89194a0faa3372e063a1fc0b4","60d1ca4237c0d7b60f9fd2fda448f79815466810","27cfe90c040a516d407cf4f88dfc9f2ce7b49e8d","8faaa1a3875431fe35344f81512c864e7a3b874d","5922715b9568d488d48a131960b0d3203aeb5b99","c201cff713db94cd98fcd1fb1aea2b00e0299307","21ec6614cd574ae6eda904735d1c708c42d0d419","32826f41b395f9bf992431988f7b9bcd640cc5b8","e434ac52339c1d9f978dbf8d4edfeaa3ca009dc0","61d8f1927495fd7dc9214d8d6a613a569d9959f8","4fb27a94fe60a0f3f1b957c2b0caa9cf8ebd6f24","394df747e7944ec160af176e70194c8ac6b2e84e","0b34a386d4b80b3d5634402c25bce127b879a930","4096630d177735d6b3ec4349c9c836f68c610eaf","bf489c6e00aee7aeb647865afdd233ea45f6625a","640e3aac13f37b84e8fd553f6b12764002a52706","619309be7be1565ade49a21c4ac2e3aa7d7002b4"],"pdfUrls":["https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0889159107000888","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0889159107000888?dgcid=api_sd_search-api-endpoint"],"title":"Sleep enhances serum interleukin-7 concentrations in humans","doi":"10.1016/j.bbi.2007.04.004","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2007.04.004","venue":"Brain, Behavior, and Immunity"}

As a significant result of the laboratory investigation, the contact area in fracture plane was found to be virtually independent of scale. By combining this characteristic with the self-affine fractal nature of fracture surfaces, a novel method for predicting fracture aperture distributions beyond laboratory scale is developed. Validity of this method is revealed through reproduction of the results of laboratory investigation and the maximum aperture-fracture length relations, which are reported in the literature, for natural fractures. The present study finally predicts conceivable scale dependencies of fluid flows through joints (fractures without shear displacement) and faults (fractures with shear displacement). Both joint and fault aperture distributions are characterized by a scale-independent contact area, a scale-dependent geometric mean, and a scale-independent geometric standard deviation of aperture. The contact areas for joints and faults are approximately 60% and 40%. Changes in the geometric means of joint and fault apertures (µm), em, joint and em, fault, with fracture length (m), l, are approximated by em, joint = 1 × 102 l0.1 and em, fault = 1 × 103 l0.7, whereas the geometric standard deviations of both joint and fault apertures are approximately 3. Fluid flows through both joints and faults are characterized by formations of preferential flow paths (i.e., channeling flows) with scale-independent flow areas of approximately 10%, whereas the joint and fault permeabilities (m2), kjoint and kfault, are scale dependent and are approximated as kjoint = 1 × 10−12 l0.2 and kfault = 1 × 10−8 l1.1.","inCitations":["7a0844784cd6e9c6edaaeea6fdf3a05af248a700","855214322894b21f974c706c28b5c8cf3790ed09","470e83e167bba5110001f8f854befc10e97f87cb","180d7a87a4525b922cacbad9c25d4034484d0229","2a797a483a3dae61d8bbe5f284e609590d422615","28ea24b19aa51645331db6434b04fb1296e83ed6","536ae3a23705d17fe12b392309021bd25bd2a7cf","5b8e5a0ba11add1d78e2feb253634043ae2937f3","bc47a1e9723853062827170945d82efa7de05de7","f231525a7da24a7984ab1d34d9da52c140677cf0","8710c514d26a8dda7185da54dc863ed4d4f06eaa","7bfdeaec690b8644df7a5c6220a49963657419cc","5d8f89a439471e01da9bd4ecb4b10ead54715675","f286acdd744c0e95f151f6c56a182daf82def55c","2327e1c6305a96457a34835a243636dae2732c4a"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Beyond‐laboratory‐scale prediction for channeling flows through subsurface rock fractures with heterogeneous aperture distributions revealed by laboratory evaluation","doi":"10.1002/2014JB011555","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1002/2014JB011555","venue":""}

In should be noted that the similar interaction also occurs due to the background quadratic atomic (lattice) nonlinearity which is intrinsic to the homogeneous intact material. The corresponding analysis [2] shows that the background level of the modulation components arising due to this inevitable background nonlinearity is not negligibly small. The level of these background modulation sidelobes hence determines the threshold level of the modulation. This threshold level should be significantly exceeded in order to unambiguously attribute the observed modulation to the presence of the damage. For the comparison with the estimates [2], in this work, we use the data obtained in the course of nonlinear-modulation experiments [3] on the nonlinear-modulation detection of cracks in axles and discs of railway wheel pairs. Figure 1 shows the examples of the modulation spectra of the ultrasonic probe wave observed in the experiments [3] for the reference defectless axles and disc. The estimations made in [2] indicate that the level of the modulation sidelobes Ω ± ω due to the influence of the background atomic nonlinearity is expected in the range –(60..80) dB, which agree well with the actual observation results","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Detection of Crack-like Defects by Nonlinear-modulation Methods : Comparison of Conventional and Cascade-modulation Interactions","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

This preference was not shown in mating patterns observed in natural choruses, but is when females are phonotactically orienting in small choruses in an experimental enclosure. With an increase in chorus size, the mating pattern shifts from size-based, non-random (with some evidence of size-assortative) mating to random mating. This is the first time that frequency-based mate-choice by female anurans has been associated with chorus size, and hence with the sonic complexity of the acoustic environment.","inCitations":["ea815a8bd2b6979f80297dc25c70c1355b4fa4d2","f6fb6003d2741f1a814721a83024df9fb1bce549","92c52d15d5cc2576be38f6637011c76f425875f1","13f998e4600ff15ad0922333bdaf92e22663099b","ef3ef2f5df34e12f4eb5f5b74c4e0184a0e214ef","b253e9fb2f8c881209ffa3f8e2537ec9d9899099","260f4b06bebf7a74daec98597db828bb85dd20c4","767a1fa457931187af44b486708a211cd9e977c9","bf31f0f6254cb1f2f3267454bcaf761607ba6452","c6b8e8a12b65ead03fbfc207c7085354147f9baa","21e1cbb6a8f7c475893dcb7b009595c282879e82","6d8b069491bd80d5e8bee0862a0c6b011a2e8c3b","1a9f5b0d88bfde2ab0fc79f43d7e25bf7e1250d1","cac422549512aecd4d3eb4243ea8b10b0f39680b","d5d35f8de2e356df4ec9962a8cfc7f5a37f660f9","2db5cee444f76c749716ed099fc5dc8eb359568a","919bd00eb3d8c663ae54d43b725b0a662c559388","dccaae05482e2edf5e14140f9af041512496d377","3eec3dd829945dd7f48e66cea5736bd1730059bf","e7391af1b2f1421a1adf28e72586046c36c75fff","0ce917be0954aa33a7256a0e3cdacddfe6ecb691","bc9876e2a5e128565cdcd571305ea6972f60a83b","f3914297799e6b1ddfcd741986879277a0d6b29e"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Mate Choice Occurs Only in Small Choruses of Painted Reed Frogs Hyperolius Marmoratus","doi":"10.1080/09524622.1989.9753113","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1080/09524622.1989.9753113","venue":""}

We demonstrate how contemporary models of auditory perception and cognition, in particular the Dynamic Attending Theory proposed by Jones and Boltz (1989), incorporate several of his ideas and experimental findings. This theory models how listeners are able to follow complex auditory sequences in real time by extracting temporal regularities from what they have already heard and by using this information to create expectations about what will happen in the future. Future events that correspond to these expectations are processed preferentially. We provide new experimental evidence in favor of two predictions that derive from this theory about how these abilities are acquired. First, we demonstrate that younger children focus spontaneously on faster occurring events than older children or adults. Second, we show that older children become increasingly able to focus on events occurring at rates further from their spontaneous referent level.

Nanoparticles belong to the materials in the field of civil engineering which have a high surface area to provide high chemical reactivity. Some researchers have employed nanoparticles into cementitious materials based on ordinary Portland cement to modify the properties of this system. They have important advantages for the hydration and microstructure of cement paste to increase the rate of hydration and the amount of formed CSH gel. The aim of this work is to investigate the influence of NF on the fire resistance of OPC pastes. The NF was synthesized by thermal decomposition of basic ferric acetate fired at 275, 600 and 800 °C. The crystal size of the prepared NF as previously determined was 14.6, 16.98 and 18.68 nm, respectively. OPC admixed with 1 wt% NF prepared at 275 °C gives the higher fire resistance than those admixed with 2 or 3 wt%. It shows the higher bulk density, compressive strength and lower porosity up to 450 °C than the blank OPC. As the firing temperature of NF increases the fire resistance diminishes.","inCitations":["6954892306f38138784da256793784dca8d34e5b","27944423de4b6bfa1f38c1824046c9b850dba818","daf468902e62ff7cf5dc27d726114afb605b389e","caca71e25a4a7b87e4c0720f213e500ab12ebc08","0d4a6b64ff66f9abe051a315b22ade13c1dd0e4d","09fd8bfcd2c2ce45465d691ecbc1b9a0fa20bbf5","811f207691674a7b9526250d69dfa9fb19cfa522"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Thermal durability of OPC pastes admixed with nano iron oxide","doi":"10.1016/j.hbrcj.2014.04.002","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.hbrcj.2014.04.002","venue":""}

These conditions involve shock-processing a high-density air test gas followed by its unsteady expansion into a low-pressure acceleration tube. This relatively slow shock-processing requires the driver to supply high pressure gas for a significantly greater duration than normally required for superorbital flow conditions. One technique to extend the duration is to operate a tuned free-piston driver. For X2, this involves the use of a very light piston at high speeds so that, following diaphragm rupture, the piston displacement substitutes for vented driver gas, thus maintaining driver pressure much longer. However, this presents challenges in terms of higher piston loading and also safely stopping the piston. This article discusses the tuned driver concept, the design of a very lightweight but highly stressed piston, and details the successful development of a new set of tuned free-piston driver conditions for X2.","inCitations":["6f0c6fcaa136f56e807937c6750ab30d2c5f9ce3","5c56963b38558c1e87ae1efab0c8535b72e65387"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Free-piston driver optimisation for simulation of high Mach number scramjet flow conditions","doi":"10.1007/s00193-011-0336-9","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00193-011-0336-9","venue":""}

SAP1-1 differs from SAP1-2 based on a few nucleotide substitutions, but the sizes of their full-length cDNAs are identical. The deduced amino acid sequences of SAP1-1 and SAP1-2 were 98% similar and contain the same C-terminal amino acid motif “GYGA” like that of PTAP1-2 from Populus trichocarpa. The expression patterns of SAP1 in various parts of the male reproductive buds of S. discolor implicate this gene in the formation of the inflorescence meristems, bracts, and floral meristems. To characterize the functions of SAP1, we assessed Arabidopsis thaliana transformed with 35S∷SAP1-1. A total of 52 transgenic T1 lines were obtained, and a 3:1 segregation ratio was obtained in the T2 generation of each line. In the T3 generation, five homozygous transgenic lines were obtained, which were used for further analysis. Screening of transgenic lines was greatly facilitated by the detection of GFP expression starting with germinating seeds. Phenotypes of the homozygous transgenic lines included early flowering, conversion of inflorescence branches to solitary flowers, formation of terminal flowers, and formation of flowers with greater number of petals, stamens, and pistils. Northern analysis showed similar expression levels in all five lines. This study provides the first functional analysis of an APETALA1 (AP1)/SQUAMOSA (SQUA) homolog from a dioecious species and suggests that SAP1 is a homolog of the AP1/SQUA gene.","inCitations":["7b5d939e8a4fd5de330d3d083cfe578a173e0da0","75f1410be6a451105698e1c4c4576e421630eb08","dc3c1ada73656c093aa85042766ff456ae699436","9ba43f7af1da2b867352f4103b6597e95f3e35c9","31b8172af16e78eb75d88df01aceaf70ccaccfcd","7446fc707172cfdf0f47a06d00b3fc6a3df2d14f","963949aa2c8ffc7262775bb4e265dee399dde6c8","8ab13c153eed8eab3c465207ed80d37de9a3debe","7f10e2096a53c91ab205ab16c58b3d0eb31b1609","ed64fc4f264a5468822168931f67aa23cf0d945d","830a2bcb9d1c511fac23acde38bf2085f35ce5ca","9838b2d3793137702fc0c181fbef959d8aa0f94f","09207a701049c60113af4d19b2b05af2d16406d8","35e2d0ae7b54dec813e9b71bf28daa99712f1a83","5c5125b7c7f4fee09cea42e62ffa93bb502e62c9","10184b2642bc4c87f215d33d7aa62ef5ebf683c0","ebdc0347d882f67bad6e9867076ff0bce107c038"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.esf.edu/efb/faculty/documents/FernandoandZhang2006.pdf"],"title":"Constitutive expression of the SAP1 gene from willow (Salix discolor) causes early flowering in Arabidopsis thaliana","doi":"10.1007/s00427-005-0026-7","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00427-005-0026-7","venue":"Development Genes and Evolution"}

Bilateral transection of the lumbar sympathetic chains abolishes all dilatation in some animals and greatly reduces dilatations in all animals. When the sympathetic tone lost by chain transection is restored by preganglionic stimulation, the residual hindlimb dilatation still present after chain section is often increased, and a component of dilatation appears de novo in the hindlimb of many animals. This dilatation was blocked by spinal anesthesia. It is concluded that: (1) the peripheral dilatation produced in the hindlimb of the dog by intravenously administered catecholamines is almost entirely reflex in origin; (2) blockade of ganglionic transmission by intravenously injected adrenergic amines does not contribute significantly to the production of reflex dilatation; (3) the residual dilatation remaining after transection o...","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Significance of catecholamine-induced ganglionic blockade and of reflex inhibition of adrenergic discharge at a peripheral locus as mechanisms producing reflex vasodilatation.","doi":"10.1139/y71-093","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1139/y71-093","venue":"Canadian journal of physiology and pharmacology"}

Health insurance estimates for low-income populations are analyzed.\n\n\nSTUDY DESIGN\nTo assess a method for making estimates for uninsured low-income persons, survey estimates of low-income children are compared with modeled estimates. Inferences can be drawn from this comparison and the method is extended to account for demographic groups.\n\n\nDATA COLLECTION\nData for 2001-2002 CPS ASEC were self-tabulated for low-income children aged 0-17. A special tabulation of the CPS ASEC was used to categorize the numbers of uninsured by age, race, sex, and Hispanic origin by low income at the state level. This special tabulation was the underlying data for the model. Principal Findings. The modeled estimates reduce the variance and margin of error substantially compared with the survey estimates.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThese health insurance estimates are credible and increase the precision for the low-income uninsured population.

It is obvious for such applications that the used films should have a good contact with the substrate underneath, be well adhering and be mechanically resistant. Therefore, cavitation experiments according to the ASTM G32-92 standard were now used to study the adhesion and wear resistance of CVD-grown aluminium oxide films. It is shown that amorphous alumina films (0.75 μm thick) which are grown in a hot wall reactor on steel are enduring the cavitation erosion better than the clean and uncovered steel, and are thus very promising for technical applications. After 30 min cavitation, no damages are observed on the coated samples by SEM while uncoated steel is clearly damaged. After 180 min, the mass loss of the specimen caused by cavitation erosion is more than 7 times lower than the one of coated steel.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Wear properties of MOCVD-grown aluminium oxide films studied by cavitation erosion experiments","doi":"10.1016/j.surfcoat.2007.04.092","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.surfcoat.2007.04.092","venue":""}

Till now, the effects by secondary rays have been little addressed in real-time/interactive DOF rendering, because secondary rays have less coherence than primary rays, making them very difficult to handle. We propose novel measures to cluster secondary rays, and take a virtual viewpoint to construct a layered image-based representation for the objects that would be intersected by a cluster of secondary rays respectively. Therefore, we can exploit coherence of secondary rays in the clusters to speed up tracing secondary rays in DOF rendering. Results show that we can interactively achieve DOF rendering effects with reflections or refractions on a commodity graphics card.","inCitations":["4177d1974469d5afbca09d31c3e3974a221efbfc","55908f7922af06a22018c39fbcecb0b16622af3f"],"pdfUrls":["http://lcs.ios.ac.cn/~guofu/files/dof/dof.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11390-013-1350-4"],"title":"Interactive Depth-of-Field Rendering with Secondary Rays","doi":"10.1007/s11390-013-1350-4","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11390-013-1350-4","venue":"Journal of Computer Science and Technology"}

Therefore, detecting the symptoms of cardiac disease as early as possible is important for increasing the patient’s survival. In this study, a compact and effective architecture for detecting atrial fibrillation (AFib) and myocardial ischemia is proposed. We developed a portable device using this architecture, which allows real-time electrocardiogram (ECG) signal acquisition and analysis for cardiac diseases.MethodsA noisy ECG signal was preprocessed by an analog front-end consisting of analog filters and amplifiers before it was converted into digital data. The analog front-end was minimized to reduce the size of the device and power consumption by implementing some of its functions with digital filters realized in software. With the ECG data, we detected QRS complexes based on wavelet analysis and feature extraction for morphological shape and regularity using an ARM processor. A classifier for cardiac disease was constructed based on features extracted from a training dataset using support vector machines. The classifier then categorized the ECG data into normal beats, AFib, and myocardial ischemia.ResultsA portable ECG device was implemented, and successfully acquired and processed ECG signals. The performance of this device was also verified by comparing the processed ECG data with high-quality ECG data from a public cardiac database. Because of reduced computational complexity, the ARM processor was able to process up to a thousand samples per second, and this allowed real-time acquisition and diagnosis of heart disease. Experimental results for detection of heart disease showed that the device classified AFib and ischemia with a sensitivity of 95.1% and a specificity of 95.9%.ConclusionsCurrent home care and telemedicine systems have a separate device and diagnostic service system, which results in additional time and cost. Our proposed portable ECG device provides captured ECG data and suspected waveform to identify sporadic and chronic events of heart diseases. This device has been built and evaluated for high quality of signals, low computational complexity, and accurate detection.","inCitations":["2284761bd03b25909dbe130672ffdb89ef9532e6","a4ac1964cce8b1cfdb616a2973bd36165167d247","87b82de7c83908884c803f17d89d0961917d224c","46a65fff4657b5dbe14c15d2ce0d1bbf866addb5","4abb1c28834c072a1919be378f927b9788b77289","8b4ea67993eb31fc657c8e1ac0cf3915140e1ad4","7d39fa6cb2678681a7ed9d101787d92cfc320e55","c89ef4247970cadae570ce8717285789a5f0c40f","08dbeaeddf78b647c965d9dd600c6bd27f930f9c","7878c8dfa8a77899f789f446b25c455b818b35cf","08c209da63b68499f367bfb5a011c19786ae6962","c5209ca560d241fe890b6d210c4192fc8835ef08","48fa98badcd2036d87cd2951a3e6c2be32a6cb42","0110f0fc07efc97f36c28c150555f84e4cf18a22","d6202bd315fcb46b062a5db3dfa9414c12f1cd56","dc899e4782312aa4fbbf8e63b54b22f7435f04f7","602fb937d02e4fac31f30bca291d7ed096181fe1","e11d46f8167f0e2d3257d6a89891efe1b58ab6c0","7e24d7edf311874b13c022d9c89ff56347b94de0","83e8ee3484aaf4e4feee602fb85108dfb0239c7b","495e17e872e0de2fc1eaaf6b01e83806d82475b3","29b5e95316b9dcf9c0250ba85e4e15f373adb7b7"],"pdfUrls":["http://download-redirector.springer.com/redirect?contentType=pdf&ddsId=art:10.1186/1475-925X-13-160&originUrl=http://biomedical-engineering-online.biomedcentral.com/article/10.1186/1475-925X-13-160","http://www.biomedical-engineering-online.com/content/pdf/1475-925X-13-160.pdf"],"title":"Implementation of a portable device for real-time ECG signal analysis","doi":"10.1186/1475-925X-13-160","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1475-925X-13-160","venue":"Biomedical engineering online"}

The morphology and chemical structure of PPy-PAN nanofiber yarn was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), which indicated that the PPy as the shell layer was homogeneously and uniformly polymerized on the surface of PAN nanofiber. The effects of different concentration of doping acid on the responses of PPy-PAN nanofiber yarn sensor were investigated. The electrical responses of the gas sensor based on the PPy-PAN nanofiber yarn to ammonia were investigated at room temperature. The nanoyarn sensor composed of uniaxially aligned PPy-PAN nanofibers with a one-dimensional structure exhibited a transient response, and the response time was less than 1 s. The excellent sensing properties mentioned above give rise to good potential application prospects in the field of ammonia sensor.","inCitations":["d21ae77c70b251c4a5e6f2b8af21c69959bdac9c","6725ca6fd347e7179b132a48a25cfa32667fe2fd","739eb2a6e0a4c5c1dc3e42d6c660ef297891b772","68628f6888c758aa909018f7637e817276fecbec","d3871ea3ee303445eee0dc40d069621d10623521"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.mdpi.com/2079-4991/6/7/121/pdf"],"title":"A Fast Response Ammonia Sensor Based on Coaxial PPy–PAN Nanofiber Yarn","doi":"10.3390/nano6070121","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.3390/nano6070121","venue":"Nanomaterials"}
