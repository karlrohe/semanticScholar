In the no-wind case, the flow is driven only by a prescribed steady northward flow of 0.8 Sv through Bering Strait. The resulting steady state circulation consists of a broad northeasterly flow, basically following the topography, with a few areas of intensified currents. About half of the inflow travels northwest through Hope Valley, while the other half turns somewhat toward the northeast along the Alaskan coast. The flow through Hope Valley is intensified as it passes through Herald Canyon, but much of this flow escapes the canyon to move eastward, joining the flow in the broad valley between Herald and Hanna Shoals, another area of slightly intensified currents. There is a confluence of nearly all of the flow along the Alaskan coast west of Pt. Barrow to create a very strong and narrow coastal jet that follows the shelf topography eastward onto the Beaufort shelf. Thus in this no-wind case, nearly all of the Pacific Water entering the Chukchi Sea eventually ends up flowing eastward along the narrow Beaufort shelf, with no discernable flow across the shelf edge toward the interior Canada Basin. Travel times for water parcels to move from Bering Strait to Pt. Barrow vary tremendously according to the path taken; e.g., less than 6 months along the Alaskan coast, but about 30 months along the westernmost path through Herald Canyon. This flow field is relatively insensitive to idealized wind-forcing when the winds are from the south, west or north, in which cases the shelf transports tend to be intensified. However, strong northeasterly to easterly winds are able to completely reverse the flows along the Beaufort shelf and the Alaskan coast, and force most of the throughflow in a more northerly direction across the Chukchi Sea shelf edge, potentially supplying the surface waters of the interior Canada Basin with Pacific Water. The entire shelf circulation reacts promptly to changing wind conditions, with a response time of ∼2–3 days. The intense coastal jet between Icy Cape and Pt. Barrow implies that dense water formed here from winter coastal polynyas may be quickly swept away along the coast. In contrast, there is a relatively quiet nearshore region to the west, between Cape Lisburne and Icy Cape, where dense water may accumulate much longer and continue to become denser before it is carried across the shelf.","inCitations":["4f77b7c46ee733a84b4395db6737f82b73fcd907","7357973e204a14ad1e9b395c93fc6fc767f26733","d93ae302500c3a9f340bc1bd900e9bfcd9a90fda","81ac468788708e17c7e74e879d5f99be35625ec9","ff59b88b8bdb95ae887286cea8552bae1ca3113b","ff3a214b727874d4575fb9c2d5f6e68762e18fb2","87d5dc74a2e2c85e968c9e71b4ad26987b8b8097","392d5919ca89992880bd41452b8667ded16a682c","159312fb2c84cf4a8a4636ef97cd6fe35388ad19","a5cdde85ede985d4f64ebb072eb2b30db5595eb4","6ec9f86abf338317f1eb59a6a31b22e1b8f6b615","0e0239ea4c16a600c7d4b08bce9b58711dbe0bb2","2ef75f364f4c1dd74e6c746e27ebe8a161c7b36f","35db3b16f81a622bdf7d3fa49ff1e064cd1bc28d","e08f9f098466b0149b3737fd402702fcb21a2669","130a811def33378838bc264411e9e3a712f8dcf0","7410724ed61f3e9ca50862dd21950b8c423c8b17","7c86108e1b2a51db360cb2a91a481a3db4d60826","e73649a3f7d6dba34f9d56605531a7b74f323a2e","016abd203baefeb33a025c66bf28a818b19fb1b0","9875c71f4a4ff797f01dbb36c69b2a76e4759c4b","a2310861a916c7b121b722417b276cb3367bfa87","36778f2a073b07fbf2f6e43fa5ad6789b26ccf3f","013d610aadf827f14fa12961fdc8219b6b903748","cecb660f092e8b6803ed0c4d9c57cb0c881228af","e4459e55fd1f27a25dbc2e8eca34ba98d0839e55","ff9c8a7b03ff790f028148158747f60fddd8aff0","e8e473a34ff6768e4c697f8f14f2fa739ed63e2b","daa4940059dddf8a9b01d10297dec25784178543","e11d9faaeee8a2a2e20d18bd6a37ff30920895dd","0edfe04e5395355fb4da129461d91df86d946190","7b44fb76808e6bc5d18ef416b8fa524d6ab5e9e6","f0ff85dae3f73935f3c2d387cc25c7ffd2f115ec","e0e6ff8f007b2173385e85499a804f6e09bf9046","e843c245c7a8a2c2a01af6165bbda2aa47de0fd5","a8e430b64ff6642a3791c37b49ccaa097ecd7df1","49823aab4defa748c1b9e0481bf76759c459258b","04e9cb18062ac8d6d04b94b064dc1bd559c5b725","92282e99920814ac433636b99b465caa4a7dc209","33f47c33f79fb0ff0bb8f76375da26283aa22bde","41624a21c01c491a8643725c7b513467eff4bce3","69bab870e3188b56eb352398e3193f10c7de927e","3e165760c04ce6ff6b1252aa3198033874166f64","856da9de0093b9adeb76662cb393d63b19aae998","3ebfaa07f1a9f70a461a4009caaf42ae96840464","e48a37929314d1ecd1af21d8a7042a86ad0da7e9","e7d69a4c457eed1a8b43a4cea1b86f63bca857b1","89b22f60c3319f4a56cca8e28bc44bea0d948ed5","29d4c941709b2130f98891db0c6634096311b519","097e3f63ff7f5c9be75460b129314241ad7b2fe1","87da811b1b1bd4ccfd3cb086ed29cea2b6cbf6ca","d38dcd5919c29b85991bde84b18260d3e1202002","911fc2af4a7ce49400e5c023f047e3dba2e77f5b","f1b2ac0315a1419d1931784e1aef9ddb21214e77","2f44eddeaef946734d5747d2adc68d59bf3db7bd","5d2e79c972d4b4032fc5ea21ca4e2d80168cef50","a520802f30cb914a5d5f7b10406d26bac1cf7cd0","115b80d31d13405d0bbe3d1437f442825022adef","411557e9d27c5781fd9ddd4a718f122c2178172b","39b09f3d3189cf0076c31b879192ac77e5582d79","65c60bbddcd572e40ccc15ab8fa445dd2c6bd8e0","5fc462de8f0218f181d7061c102ca3b640226d1b"],"pdfUrls":["https://darchive.mblwhoilibrary.org/bitstream/handle/1912/3758/2003JC001962.pdf;jsessionid=BC64F9CABF216B7F927EDAB510D39727?sequence=1"],"title":"Pathways of Pacific water across the Chukchi Sea: A numerical model study","doi":"10.1029/2003JC001962","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1029/2003JC001962","venue":""}

It is believed that the only regulated step of the iron metabolism cycle occurs during absorption in the small intestine. Once this system becomes overwhelmed due to either local or widespread iron levels, then iron can be absorbed very quickly by a passive concentration-dependent mechanism. This excess iron is initially stored in the liver but later can be found in the pancreas, heart and joints. Excess iron is not expected to deposit in the gastric mucosa. This gastric deposition has been found in association with hemochromatosis, oral iron medications, alcohol abuse, blood transfusions, hepatic cirrhosis and spontaneous portacaval shunt with esophageal varices. The precise mechanism of this iron deposition in gastric epithelial and stromal cells is still not well understood; thus, identification of iron in gastric mucosa raises many questions. On histology, the pattern of deposition is variable, and recognition of the pattern is often useful to choose the appropriate workup for the patient and to diagnose and possibly treat the cause of iron overload. In this article, we have described a well-referenced review of this rare clinical entity with different histological patterns, diagnostic tests and the clinical significance of the different patterns of iron deposition.","inCitations":["4fbd23b310a34b2a796e86a50104df8d97172a20","ea490dc271e8674de6d49dc54878fa9f6cd64b70","eb44b6c11df4b4884ded0d04d79c3e55813fce73"],"pdfUrls":["https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/pmc/oa_pdf/d4/34/10.1177_2050312116632109.PMC4778084.pdf"],"title":"Gastric siderosis: An under-recognized and rare clinical entity","doi":"10.1177/2050312116632109","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1177/2050312116632109","venue":"SAGE open medicine"}

Such distortion is often determined using an expensive coordinate measuring system (e.g., Leica LMS2020 optical metrology system) which may not be readily available. We describe a simple and inexpensive technique for measuring field distortion using readily available instruments. The essence of the technique is to build up a pattern using multiple exposures with different portions of the field overlapped in the complete pattern, so that the resulting linewidth or pitch variation across the field gives the difference between the field distortion and a shifted field distortion. We can then reconstruct the field distortion by measuring the linewidth/pitch. We have applied this technique to two optical steppers, and have shown that the reconstructed field disto...","inCitations":["a5c4477654348354839959c3dc893ca76491507a","4b35e46c4b2d1392ce62509b06f2dc9353a84b18"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Field distortion characterization using linewidth or pitch measurement","doi":"10.1116/1.588276","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1116/1.588276","venue":""}

Aquatic Sciences, 71 (3), 356–370] for the Drôme River Basin (France). It tests the capacity of the functional sector concept (Petts, G.E. and Amoros, C., 1996. Fluvial hydrosystems. Springer) when used to assess the risks of environmental changes. The application of this concept is illustrated by examples focusing on the potential impacts of sediment replenishment on functional sector diversity used as a proxy of habitat diversity, and on trout distribution at a network scale. We used remote sensing and Geographic Information System (GIS) methods to produce original data. A cluster analysis performed on the components of a principal component analysis established a functional sector typology based on channel planform parameters. We calculated an index of present and 1948 functional sector diversity for the entire channel network to highlight past evolutions. A sensitivity analysis was then performed to predict changes in functional sector diversity resulting from defined options of sediment reintroduction through planned forest removal. A similar procedure was developed to evaluate likely changes in brown trout distribution resulting from the impacts of the actions on canopy cover and summer water temperature. The methodological procedure is described, as well as the different assumptions made to move from a theoretical framework to a more practical one.

Although defects in this genetic cascade lead to human disorders of sex development (DSD), only a dozen DSD genes have been identified, and causes of 46,XX DSD (XX maleness) other than SRY translocation are almost completely unknown. Here, we show that transgenic expression of Sox10, a close relative of Sox9, in gonads of XX mice resulted in development of testes and male physiology. The degree of sex reversal correlated with levels of Sox10 expression in different transgenic lines. Sox10 was expressed at low levels in primordial gonads of both sexes during normal mouse development, becoming male-specific during testis differentiation. SOX10 protein was able to activate transcriptional targets of SOX9, explaining at a mechanistic level its ability to direct male development. Because over-expression of SOX10 alone is able to mimic the XX DSD phenotypes associated with duplication of human chromosome 22q13, and given that human SOX10 maps to 22q13.1, our results functionally implicate SOX10 in the etiology of these DSDs.","inCitations":["dcfc52ea96596bcd5041727d0dcf39821a190c05","2595d517f8436746f7dc2292dbee45b1b26c37d8","657e96f9d230ae3271917dc7b5d300215056e31d","41418b7369434ee4f122439a40b5107f776d6f70","140e55a1d74ae0d287a02e78d8e260c6b6c4ae06","d5ada822e3d0c95b9bf0fab63ad5fea396704d98","caf99e1822dfb458c56a80c39fbc94f1e743f563","6ce20be7ba0edb987da3a00aee41c2352c260eec","8897b1a344d7161a4f045f48f57e80e58a97ef83","b939e011800682103fef8b66f79108e28fb7714d","34aa3019322a3b680428a302341a1a2baacf975a","f32154062880e5e8fc14cfe7a6750c832fecd71b","0a9ee0cfbb82091ee485c79d00b1f7d0c8005289","04748ba2d37e77f34712217798ce8322ffef9f96","3ac6191b9e5018b4bec39fcb05fe28b110d60a92","61f89230be3a10be1aca2227aa8a6d9fab7ac0d9","15e0509b2a6a77bcf9f199d8dccfc76a4c91a2dc","501e98fed5b40e9d17734c1070cab83f7c63379d","64593cd664ac9aa205c35eafc8e60a1b9aa0bc25","b606e4a2875fe92e1542096f045983907b4858df","d0496c1e565a38684d5f88df2208fe79aaa231ac","0a909bcf754669f63c97047b3cf4152af3b3606c","5a94806f55d89a2c8b2605580ebc67bf937a4955","4cbdd7f0b676d69cf0c24de53e59f6cdbeadb1a4","678c890caa55d15ce02f0dbd67b2a2e6867dc356","2beb8e33062863c55e178b20a5253f4fe7bb09a8","b7e9dd813954fc27eb30f0f2027633ef5e62d72f","974dc54e371787438e528f9d1c2a7079759ae96a","3860ee65052aebecc48a85a79a36221160458b30","22d2f6999d92875c0b1b9b2cab747417dcfd5e89","3fecaa3d9a8c149a4f7224165ee19ae014f49ade","0b7c51052cc2d2450c9fa80751096f4fff051f5f","032aa91f7ae4fa7207dfbcead246d349269cba48","ee37aff2e04f6c4a664a675ea794d2fcfa7e3902","b4223399c5f873f32a5a6cba1291ebd399ca2b1a","7077906389bb1b0c38872640210a807888e3ed45","48b21ca29bb885b4056539e0fb5475d8252951ed","26d03eb7b6b641089d3a6fd14b12aaa07afb3caf","c9412661e498feb15792b79fc0ffc367fba91e9e","d0b5503d69b46533dcafecbcb5954fa6ed1ab15c","e75531d8442663a3dbd6b0113ff063e442dfc3ab","b1a501e7a3f80a88f30eb3c20906ac6797683377","5cff4286b072927f85720365a03a53102f0e3092","2c5d5ead2bc40faf729e8a7e37944a2675b5fb1c","34e30591638b004b8f3cab255596154f9f6a52d8","4e554c2acf9af82df181a3b8d08221e15b0911c5","f1284f875fe041752b4f8e2c2b0d14af72a7e68e","949445be50ecb38b53e51ca6b65294b87a97cd4b","e28359a0d01f421c20aedafaa6a5efcb3b57a6d3","245c5fb8489ba0e4bda5bd4fe25fd697f5a9d513","69eac633ad3c0cb1cabc4fce7fbea388432c328c","75465c189febf7b5d0d43d7a59e4385c2d2269a5","137c19596b9a780447bd4c4ba7f233c1a74d66db","8c09344d69818dbd1632a46d27ce2b3f9ca93165","81fc61431f6a96cc4410ae7824ef07056d993452","4071168b4861b7f1bb33a44cffb19296f4b9cf61","cd2305d04f467f1d20028fdcc0f20f45f7156bfe","edac3e02388cecfbb82d9e2937a51df633c95839","e6dadf3bc824cccaf1ac0c70b0160b48aaf12cb6","4e9c68bbd2ef35983e4b18997dea69290e0d13e3","7dfdf4bf139bbb7688c4fb84ff17a138daaee8e5","e921828b1e600f1636790afe2e356219818c4de1","2ad057426c3dc57c7250dda59603d21fbb4305e4","634253624ccd32048950bcd11efad9fbec52a0a1","4277963a0477889e4d2f193f80dede1516c8ab52","9d2494a13c975d0bd65dbdbdaa30682902c90ac1","cbfa7214e3ed77560a546d35c4dd6d5d370cec23","004ce824c2e907eb472c73fcf8c37baa6113d447","f714c4a283801a1e46303a86238e6309efdaa188"],"pdfUrls":["https://oup.silverchair-cdn.com/oup/backfile/Content_public/Journal/hmg/19/3/10.1093/hmg/ddp520/2/ddp520.pdf?Expires=1492570202&Key-Pair-Id=APKAIUCZBIA4LVPAVW3Q&Signature=d-3ilXs4RJjnro9DCa0kV9i0QjmBT2MIQczWS2stopjmgOYCe-mEb4anKRgSRB0-jTH9O4HEQtZbtEHUQGlFJ27dHIfi4ZugltKcLHuzRELl731UpcIxOPhLqrh6pI5eGjhFOgjutX5~j~PyaLvyiYIUGuQ4RMmh-3RJwTVJrjlxsfQsd98w1mnB90aBDJtoFWjGTczvr6KJGayZ7HZd1~l3BZk41HBGv5DtfxllmT8~mxdhiZy~puSBD-gmBuUrPYL6Ox8s0PG9DOao2-XlGc~zBE4Qcxer3uOyiIXWZII1wOZI2JxRs-fqPdPatxnPNNUW5uAwRqvUQ8h6eEnz3w__"],"title":"Sox10 gain-of-function causes XX sex reversal in mice: implications for human 22q-linked disorders of sex development.","doi":"10.1093/hmg/ddp520","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1093/hmg%2Fddp520","venue":"Human molecular genetics"}

Insiden luka bakar di seluruh dunia pada tahun 2004 diperkirakan 1,1 per 100.000 penduduk. Dan hampir separuh terjadi di wilayah Asia Tenggara. Skin graft digunakan dalam berbagai situasi klinis termasuk rekonstruksi luka bakar. ). Patogen yang paling umum yang menyebabkan kegagalan graft adalah coagulase positive staphylococcus, Pseudomonas dan beta-haemolytic Streptococcus. Oleh karena itu, peneliti perlu meneliti hubungan koloni Pseudomonas aeruginosa dengan tingkat keberhasilan skin graft pada pasien luka bakar di RSUP H. Adam Malik Medan. \n \nMetode: Penelitian ini merupakan penelitian descriptive analitik dengan desain penelitian crossectional, dilakukan di Departemen Ilmu Bedah Plastik RSUP H. Adam Malik Medan selama periode Februari sampai Juni 2014. Populasi dalam penelitian ini adalah seluruh penderita luka bakaryang dirawat di RSUP H. Adam Malik Medan pada kurun waktu Februari sampai Juni 2014 yang dilakukan skin graft \n \nHasil: Dari 22 kasus luka bakar dijumpai persentase take skin graft > 80% pada 16 pasien (72.7%), persentase take skin graft antara 50-80% pada 5 pasien (22.7%), dan persentase take skin graft 80% pada luka bakar dengan Pseudomonas aeroginosa dijumpai pada 3/7 kasus (42,86%) yang lebih sedikit pada luka bakar non Pseudomonas aeroginosa yaitu pada 13/15 kasus (86,67%). Take <80% pada penderita luka bakar dengan Pseudomonas aeroginosa ( 4/7 = 57.14% ) lebih banyak dari pada luka bakar dengan non Pseudomonas aeroginosa ( 2/15 = 13,33% ). Namun perbedaan ini secara statistik hampir bermakna (p=0,073) \n \n Kesimpulan: Tingkat keberhasilan skin graft sebesar >80% pada luka bakar dengan Pseudomonas aeroginosa dijumpai pada 3/7 kasus (42,86%) yang lebih sedikit pada luka bakar non Pseudomonas aeroginosa yaitu pada 13/15 kasus (86,67%).

Improving the company's brand, which in some cases comprises 80% of corporate value, is of the utmost importance. Another new way to strengthen a company's position on the market is the Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) approach. Investors are not concerned only with a company's profits, but with it having an overall positive impact on society. On the other hand, new attitudes to marketing are the way to meet the needs of aware and sensible customers. For this group of clients low price is no longer the most important factor - just as significant is quality of many aspects of company operations - especially management quality and the quantifiable impact a company has on society and nature. This article attempts to answer the question of whether employing aspects of CSR yields certain advantages, such as increased company value. It also asks whether investors should take into account that the company operates according to the principles of CSR. In order to answer this question, we calculated TMAI ratios (a taxonomic measure of investment attractiveness) for indexes of listed companies included in the RESPECT Index portfolio.","inCitations":["5cfc1befeaa498582dd36dbc810e927f437eec90"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Odpowiedzialny biznes jako nowy kierunek w marketingu przedsiębiorstw","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

This study sought to determine the factors associated with healthcare workers’ good TB infection control practices in primary health care facilities in the Free State Province, South Africa.MethodsA cross-sectional self-administered survey among nurses (n = 202) and facility-based community healthcare workers (n = 34) as well as facility observations were undertaken at all 41 primary health care facilities in a selected district of the Free State Province.ResultsThe majority of respondents were female (n = 200; 87.7 %) and the average age was 44.19 years (standard deviation ±10.82). Good levels of knowledge were recorded, with 42.8 % (n = 101) having an average score (i.e. 65–79 %) and 31.8 % (n = 75) a good score (i.e. ≥ 80 %). Most respondents (n = 189; 80.4 %) had positive attitudes towards TB infection control practices (i.e. ≥ 80 %). While good TB infection control practices were reported by 72.9 % (n = 161) of the respondents (i.e. ≥75 %), observations revealed this to not necessarily be the case. For every unit increase in attitudes, good practices increased 1.090 times (CI:1.016–1.169). Respondents with high levels of knowledge (≥80 %) were 4.029 (CI: 1.550–10.469) times more likely to have good practices when compared to respondents with poor levels of knowledge (<65 %). The study did not find TB/HIV-related training to be a predictor of good practices.ConclusionsPositive attitudes and good levels of knowledge regarding TB infection control were the main factors associated with good infection control practices. Although many respondents reported good infection control practices - which was somewhat countered by the observations - there are areas that require attention, particularly those related to administrative controls and the use of personal protective equipment.","inCitations":["c00804cd2b87cd73e8a3914d43d5396c4abe8ade","14e269f3240da0f9a4129bc1606abc1f54b46662","d837895b4d7dcc4b46067d73828951b4a0330a60","be06b61819e098ac5070ac42fad5b4e9bd9d1f74","5aa9dfcf4a9c9cd07f0235b19d5a8f3565cbb35b","6ca59eea0605dec8358eb386d14f8be4602d9bae","b0910e23a40df5053774d9de21ff3a2973044cfc","9beb4dd1a16e13a1947343dd0641d7712eacf81d","aa3effeffb13cfb99b53965483f6e1f042da2efb","3c6aa04d59915bbd98a7f6d0e7ffd864de579789","ca108957d5fcdc59930661a2a08fdf27ae28e3dc","5705e4389ee28f343a5e97a86bd8a533836e4eef","e62ee972e8703a2219ff79a1af1c7559402394b4","f47ca4e3d11d1d43324a200dbb5895ef3cae820a","f2ec025a43dcc07d4cab8bb35cc0874e46566824"],"pdfUrls":["https://bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s12879-016-1984-2"],"title":"Factors associated with good TB infection control practices among primary healthcare workers in the Free State Province, South Africa","doi":"10.1186/s12879-016-1984-2","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12879-016-1984-2","venue":"BMC Infectious Diseases"}

Large SSAs have been observed in hadronic reactions for decades [1, 2]. In general, such single-spin asymmetries require a correlation of a particle spin direction and the orientation of the production or scattering plane. In hadronic processes, such correlations can provide a window to the physics of initial and final state interactions at the parton level. Recently, significant SSAs were reported in semi-inclusive DIS (SIDIS) by the HERMES collaboration at HERA [3, 4] for a longitudinally polarized target, the SMC collaboration at CERN for a transversely polarized target [5], and the CLAS collaboration at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (JLab)[6] with a polarized beam.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Spin and Azimuthal Asymmetries in DIS","doi":"10.1007/978-94-010-0165-6_9","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-94-010-0165-6_9","venue":""}

This paper is reported improvement of the array microphone directivity, realizing a narrow beam with a low order of the filter using a two‐dimensional frequency domain design. Using four microphones, a second‐order pressure‐gradient microphone is formed. The spacing of the microphones is set for high sensitivity and broad bandwidth in the operating frequency range. These microphone units are placed along a line and are cascaded to a two‐dimensional fan filter so that the load is distributed.

For many years wings were considered a low-value product; therefore, shelf life of wings was not a major concern. Due to changes in consumer attitudes and increases in the fast-food market, wings are now a valuable commodity. Because wings have a shorter shelf life than most other raw poultry products, acceptable intervention to decrease the population of associated spoilage organisms and human enteropathogens are needed. Safe2O Poultry Wash was evaluated as a postchill treatment to reduce microbial contamination and increase shelf life. Ninety-six carcasses were obtained from a local processor prior to final wash. On arrival at the research facility all carcasses were inoculated with 1 mL of a culture with 103 cfu/mL Listeria monocytogenes. After a 30-min attachment time, carcasses were subjected to a 4-s in-out final wash, hung for 3 min, and chilled in ice-water for 45 min. After the chilling, wings were removed by hand with a knife, pooled together, and subjected to a hand spray (4 mL/wing) with deionized water or Safe2O Poultry Wash.

So the use of heuristic and expert procedures is considered to be necessary. In the suggested model of the University (institute, faculty, department) rating, the fragments of the models used by the Ministry of Education of Russia, the Association for Technical Universities of Russia, the Independent Accreditation Center, the advanced technical universities of Russia, as well as long-term developments of the Tomsk Polytechnic University in quality control of the University activities and its departments, modern tendencies and priorities of the universities developments, are accepted as the basic ones. 55 indices have been determined. Numerical values of indices are normalized on the maximum value achieved in the objects under consideration that provides a commensurability of indices by their essential spread in various objects. The data convolution by sections and subsections is carried out linearly taking into account their importance. The value of the index is determined by an expert method taking into account its relative importance within the limits of each section (subsection). The numerical value of each rating index is determined by its relation to the \"base\". The \"base\" is determined as the on-budget salary fund of the University (institute, faculty, department) staff, providing educational process, and the on-budget salary fund of the staff carrying out state budgetary research. The software for the collective interactive remote input of the indices, as well as for the centralized calculation and operative analysis of the universities rating has been developed. The server Apache, the database server MySQL, and the scripting language PHP have been used for the above work to be carried out.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Web-technology of university's evaluation rating","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":"7th Korea-Russia International Symposium on Science and Technology, Proceedings KORUS 2003.

The object of the study was to determine the safety and efficacy of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging performed after the administration of gadolinium diethylenetriamine-pentaacetic acid (Gd-DTPA) in evaluating residual or recurrent tumor. Precontrast T1-weighted, intermediate, and T2-weighted images were obtained at a field strength of 1.5 T. Gd-DTPA was then injected intravenously in a dose of 0.1 mmol per kilogram of body weight. T1-weighted images were obtained within 5 minutes after the injection, intermediate and T2-weighted images were obtained 10 minutes after the injection, and T1-weighted images were obtained approximately 20 minutes after the injection. None of the patients experienced allergic reactions or other side effects. Physical examination findings and laboratory values were unchanged after the Gd-DTPA-enhanced examination. In six patients, contrast-enhanced images depicted tumor not suspected on nonenhanced images. In four other patients, enhanced images provided better definition of the tumor core. The images of one patient with a brain stem tumor showed no evidence of enhancement. Pre- and postcontrast images of three previously treated patients showed no evidence of tumor. Gd-DTPA appears to be a safe and effective contrast agent for MR imaging and provides a more accurate method of imaging in the follow-up of brain tumors in pediatric patients.","inCitations":["9b1038e57cc61cd2d6ac7a19face7fd68ff9d44a","74d3dde3a3e6a2f0897af1f8a2e8e3c5b918d374","380a37366a22bc89fe4672fdcfb6c5b5d8fe9a73","3765d94996a85be12b23d3d275cd2063ed7b2c08","2a6ea114e6f61782f6418cf047279cd6898d2094","d10005bb7780a63d9a226bed11607823a2aa046d","4a27945d1230eb35b981f81d57468cac44ad5949","f706810d3b328e568a40915d66d8409093e35e91","69509aab554cdb9241172e542dc5ac6b1c3065b1","cf6614992fa882c3d64144334c0e93fa2444287d","6cddecb8887c7f2e3a857ef4d64f836df32f4622","43cffb44025bc16dbbcd845dbdd4e101d81c18cc","1aa3029fdd73f4d1155f34c09eb59d77f0ff6e56","70f4db36b407cdcd1f20126b5c6a5c40ff2ba3ba","5203822c1a3114be71e9ff78f32d1f346186b212","dc0e04659b150305eac7f4a2216bae410418901f","38c2a0c95e408ecd554e14568aa34a1477d85cfe","43bc30c266eed97fe7508a9e98d788307cd2474f","77a6f73cd5d330bfe3f64094546b7c61336a2c2e","b7f307187026f03d5920f75a29056a80c6687972"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Gd-DTPA-enhanced MR imaging in pediatric patients after brain tumor resection.","doi":"10.1148/radiology.169.1.3420247","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1148/radiology.169.1.3420247","venue":"Radiology"}

In this review, we briefly examine the sensory information used by place cells to anchor their firing fields in space and show that, among the various sensory cues that can influence place cell activity, visual and motion-related cues are the most relevant. We then explore the contribution of several cortical areas to the generation of the place cell signal with an emphasis on the role of the visual cortex and parietal cortex. Finally, we address the functional significance of place cell activity and demonstrate the existence of a clear relationship between place cell positional activity and spatial navigation performance. We conclude that place cells, together with head direction cells, provide information useful for spatially guided movements, and thus provide a unique model of how spatial information is encoded in the brain.","inCitations":["0f5a3225fccbdf80a1eb8c840ab62e22ea73c208","ba09cd0070f91ea123d626bcd0184a6e7a4d9a0c","1baeaa776c4f1cf17e690a73f8b38b8064c0e794","6186e01c24b67f7bac30df5bf0f3de7a22ff325d","12f731bf96c8709082d247364a436c2727d6e1d1","4db2e242537cce0b794f40a6aef8e24c042a4422","1f9e4f271e6ab96dcf72c3e1bca4005ae77917e3","fa060c924a6b97548c075e938f88612838085674","9b61e76821e3cdc48ee5e8ed16fb6428af5eb0cd","cd9d189af4c7e2481982b3ed3ba4a08fad15c26e","a31395500b9315577ca817f11ff36134420c00c0","7b927afc9cdf88668388d4932df0399c945fce7a","3676be4579eea550673f27accbe2ed6af03f3893","195892bfa6ac325933e3da44698cbec0852b79a0","5e34a43c96cfe14ff8492185af6d1bd587060a18","101c260abd202f26e2a251180f078896b7c44a41","c8f69a8a7e829ac2019614a42e9d0d9490252bdc","4ccd778e6ba66260413503b50b1e05938cc9d3dc","20a641e32bf7e63a1660e44833b2a4963d5d429f","1c472216703f74572826a768446d54e9de0c0029","c3e92c68f16ad7fbcba71af7aa828ef6e48d4a72","366f0c998b5a1a5ac1820dd4c7c4270977616648"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.utdallas.edu/~tres/spatial/Poucet1.pdf","https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0928425704000270","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0928425704000270?dgcid=api_sd_search-api-endpoint"],"title":"Place cells, neocortex and spatial navigation: a short review","doi":"10.1016/j.jphysparis.2004.01.011","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jphysparis.2004.01.011","venue":"Journal of Physiology-Paris"}

The flood peak immediately below the dam was estimated to be approximately 500,000 cfs. About 450 people were killed by the surge of water which swept 52 mi downstream to the ocean. A mile and a half downstream from the dam a powerhouse was torn away down to the generator floor by a water wave estimated to be more than 125 ft high (Fig. 1). The state commission that investigated this failure concluded that the foundation of the dam left very much to be desired. A portion of the rock was of such inferior strength that a specimen quickly disintegrated when immersed in water. It does not take much courage in retrospect to suggest that a dam of this type should not have been placed upon this kind of foundation. Knowledge has improved since 1928, but the problems in building dams have not diminished. Good dam sites are hard to find in California. It has become necessary to devise means to construct safe dams on poor foundations.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Supervision of Safety of California Dams","doi":"10.1002/j.1551-8833.1966.tb01665.x","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1002/j.1551-8833.1966.tb01665.x","venue":""}

To obtain a material sensitive to radiation, specific sol-gel syntheses based on an organically modified alkoxide containing an epoxy ring, 3-glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane (GPTMS), have been developed. The synthesis and the patternability of hybrid materials have been obtained controlling the inorganic crosslinking degree and with an almost total absence of organic polymerization. Two examples of directly patternable hybrid films, called GB and GGe, have been synthesized using acidic (GGe) and basic (GB) conditions and obtaining different compositions. After electron beam lithography (EBL) or x-ray synchrotron radiation lithography (XRL) the polymerization of the organic component of the sol-gel film occurs, generating a hardening of the structure after post-exposure baking. The exposed polymerized material becomes insoluble, determining a negative resist-like behaviour of the film: the lithographic process of nanopatterning results from the dissolution of the unexposed areas in proper solvents (developers). Spatial resolution of the order of 200 nm is reported and a contrast of 2.2 is achieved. The novelty of this work is that epoxy based materials, which have enhanced thermomechanical stability with respect to the more usual acrylic based resins, are directly nanopatterned for the first time by electron beam (EB) and/or x-ray beam radiation exposure without the aid of catalysts for polymerization. In contrast to common resists that are sacrificial layers of the fabrication process, direct patternable sol-gel hybrids constitute the final material of the devices. In fact, an example of doping with a light emitting dye is reported together with the achievement of directly patterned structures by EBL and XRL.","inCitations":["f1400f3160d79a90a8966d0955f054021f3f2780","447a1512d9e5aef86afc2d7fccc780df728431ac","8c7b9bc08b8181147fd03b938e5980eab79648b9"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Design of hybrid sol-gel films for direct x-ray and electron beam nanopatterning.","doi":"10.1088/0957-4484/19/17/175306","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1088/0957-4484%2F19%2F17%2F175306","venue":"Nanotechnology"}

How alternative P–V relations modify transmitral flow (Doppler E-wave) velocity contours has not been explored. The linear force–length term of a previously validated lumped parameter transmitral flow model was replaced by a logarithmic, exponential, or power law term for E-wave prediction. Model-based image processing (MBIP) was used for model-predicted flow vs. clinical E-wave comparison using root-mean-square-error (RSME) as an index of goodness-of-fit. RMSE of fits to ≈100 cm/s amplitude E-waves for linear, logarithmic, power law, and exponential relations were indistinguishable [RMSE: 4.1 ± 1.2%, 4.9 ± 1.4%, 5.1 ± 2.0%, and 5.3 ± 1.6% (mean ± SD), respectively]. We conclude that the linear force–length relation is suitable for E-wave based quantitative diastolic function assessment with the added benefit of closed form solutions to the “inverse problem” of diastole. Conversely, it is not possible to distinguish whether a ventricle obeys a linear, power law, exponential, or logarithmic P–V relation by MBIP of E-waves.","inCitations":["36173deb0603fc5a27a55bd54b0329bc176fef00","2492d38f79c4ffda200fd22ae93c92b715c819d6"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Can Analysis of Transmitral Flow-Velocity Contours Differentiate Between Alternative Diastolic Pressure–Volume Relations?","doi":"10.1023/A:1020981303354","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1023/A%3A1020981303354","venue":""}

It consists of a cylindrical acrylic cell filled with two immiscible liquids (degassed water and silicone oil) and a concave ultrasound transducer. The focal point of the transducer is located on the oil-water interface, which functions as a lens. An acoustic standing wave was generated in the axial direction of the lens and the variation of the shape of the oil-water interface was observed by optical coherence tomography (OCT). The lens profile can be rapidly changed by varying the acoustic radiation force from the transducer. The kinematic viscosity of silicone oil was optimized to minimize the response times of the lens. Response times of 40 and 80 ms when switching ultrasonic radiation on and off were obtained with a kinematic viscosity of 200 cSt. The path of the laser beam transmitted through the lens was calculated by ray-tracing simulations based on the experimental results obtained by OCT. The transmitted laser beam could be focused by applying an input voltage. The liquid lens could be operated as a variable-focus lens by varying the input voltage.","inCitations":["69407329c0b5b41786f69d7e5b249aeac9dddf57"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Liquid lens using an acoustic radiation force","doi":"10.1109/ultsym.2010.5935605","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ultsym.2010.5935605","venue":"2010 IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium"}

While there is consensus that greater biodiversity increases the functioning of ecosystems, the extent to which biodiversity buffers ecosystem productivity in response to changes in resource availability remains unclear. We use data from 16 grassland experiments across North America and Europe that manipulated plant species richness and one of two essential resources—soil nutrients or water—to assess the direction and strength of the interaction between plant diversity and resource alteration on above-ground productivity and net biodiversity, complementarity, and selection effects. Despite strong increases in productivity with nutrient addition and decreases in productivity with drought, we found that resource alterations did not alter biodiversity–ecosystem functioning relationships. Our results suggest that these relationships are largely determined by increases in complementarity effects along plant species richness gradients. Although nutrient addition reduced complementarity effects at high diversity, this appears to be due to high biomass in monocultures under nutrient enrichment. Our results indicate that diversity and the complementarity of species are important regulators of grassland ecosystem productivity, regardless of changes in other drivers of ecosystem function.","inCitations":["4153562f4b236ddf87c66a723c88695ce4afe55a","6c28f83ea6de1a390ede9f98f588ffee75500e0d","b279399a87af0397e432c692ca055e2bad77c05f","8028ad830010390ab5daf2abdd792a17f745fd59","ab3b1a68adc0aa841ca3449ac95c4e78c7dd4865","9e48bae6579b82c9495404e0edd704b89d7c35d0","66888bafb7a652b339fe792f7fb70c92a30a660b","778d5f01e9f62e4b6885328e1c00db658109cc79","3c6567f7f81629427fe1e13e9b535cff61880320","8985401a8cdb818e1b590762561edbfbc19b2522","01b9c8387cc071afc517b8eaa6cdea9db68513fb","37d93a35ef9c74b1b7c9c304d56ea7441d2b4048","1cd2329d0795cc04b7a12d530b8a27949aa7f6de","1b9f2db54c005c509528bc3ac2cd037f71d911e3","e0646f3bf598f7b2648c622a868ea8f290366a66","6a2e067dcc5ad8bd20d175e01dd329d376c3dba2","15539c16c20656aa4e76eaa756d84a74cd034114","74ff40e5d527b864e6d5b20541a534575a5bb41d","ffbc856eef006e111bb97f0d3700199ab93fd50d","7962c6468d49f8512a78f4a77a20d87c024842af","8851f4e5bab62482e658fec70c2e3f9cd41e5bf8","5a8d0b6910deb46ea917d1cd53e41b0d0dcbc85e","15e7f428589f95cab365db397a8ae38f1306e2ec","c5bb79b44fd8ae9fba19d81ba2f0adc64edb5491","f54d876c7c18090cf728bcbe27db5f9fa1d15425","6dd8329a24125c980d3e06ed043f1155f9069fa0","51e4853312ff86d6d3ad251d241e2b23ed270b90","4e393f04264932a6cf226621fdada75fa044263b","07b94aeba9b814881bc5f19fc4a3512b4c0bf576","a6aed29e26d1d41c0fbe488a61d5b8a8fe067cb0","72366c30acd04d8a6af32e6ac3e1d60681f4b08e","ebff4729026f00b60644a1f3d3829ca0999ec012"],"pdfUrls":["http://cedarcreek.umn.edu/biblio/fulltext/Craven-etal_rstb_2016.pdf","https://conservancy.umn.edu/bitstream/handle/11299/184572/Craven%20et%20al%202016.pdf?isAllowed=y&sequence=1","https://boris.unibe.ch/82037/1/PhiloTRoySocB_371_20150277.pdf","https://lib.dr.iastate.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1246&context=eeob_ag_pubs","http://boris.unibe.ch/82037/1/PhiloTRoySocB_371_20150277.pdf"],"title":"Plant diversity effects on grassland productivity are robust to both nutrient enrichment and drought","doi":"10.1098/rstb.2015.0277","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1098/rstb.2015.0277","venue":"Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences"}

High-density mapping of the FHB resistance quantitative trait loci (QTL), evaluation of their co-localization with plant height and maturity QTL and the interaction among the identified QTL are the objectives of this study. Two doubled haploid (DH) populations, one developed from crosses between Triticum turgidum ssp. durum lines DT707 and DT696 and the other between T. turgidum ssp. durum cv. Strongfield and T. turgidum ssp. carthlicum cv. Blackbird were genotyped using the 90K Infinium iSelect chip and evaluated phenotypically at multiple field FHB nurseries over years. A moderate broad-sense heritability indicated a genotype-by-environment interaction for the expression of FHB resistance in both populations. Resistance QTL were identified for the DT707 × DT696 population on chromosomes 1B, 2B, 5A (two loci) and 7A and for the Strongfield × Blackbird population on chromosomes 1A, 2A, 2B, 3A, 6A, 6B and 7B with the QTL on chromosome 1A and those on chromosome 5A being more consistently expressed over environments. FHB resistance co-located with plant height and maturity QTL on chromosome 5A and with a maturity QTL on chromosome 7A for the DT707 × DT696 population. Resistance also co-located with plant height QTL on chromosomes 2A and 3A and with maturity QTL on chromosomes 1A and 7B for the Strongfield × Blackbird population. Additive × additive interactions were identified, for example between the two FHB resistance QTL on chromosome 5A for the DT707 × DT696 population and the FHB resistance QTL on chromosomes 1A and 7B for the Strongfield × Blackbird population. Application of the Single Nucleotide Polymorphic (SNP) markers associated with FHB resistance QTL identified in this study will accelerate combining genes from the two populations.","inCitations":["d56af3f2deeb12ff65ee27e5ada98adfaf9a55f4","d76c78de1fb05c043036b88baf98b81275e9e9d6","df68830bef84f2d30d2af75fa95525e6350ae6bc"],"pdfUrls":["https://lib.dr.iastate.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1596&context=agron_pubs"],"title":"High density genetic mapping of Fusarium head blight resistance QTL in tetraploid wheat","doi":"10.1371/journal.pone.0204362","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0204362","venue":"PloS one"}

The adsorption characteristics of illite slit pores varying in diameters were simulated using a Monte Carlo method. The results reveal that the pore volume and the specific surface area of the shale are primarily supplied by pore diameters measuring less than 2 nm. Illite is one of the primary components of the clay mineralogy within the shale that forms parallel or nearly-parallel plate pores. For pore sizes ranging from 0.5 nm to 0.9 nm (at conditions of 303.15 K and 8 MPa), the methane molecules are affected by van der Waals and electrostatic forces that leads to a large excess in the adsorption capacity of methane. Once the pore size becomes less than 0.9 nm, the methane adsorption becomes primarily affected by van der Waals forces. At the said size, the excess adsorption capacity of methane initially decreases, after which it remains constant with an increase in the pore size. The free gas content surges with the growing pore diameters. The average equivalent adsorption heat reflects that the adsorption of methane onto illite is characterized by physical adsorption. During the adsorption process, when the pore size is between 0.5 nm and 1.2 nm, the average equivalent adsorption heat decreases rapidly with an increase in the pore diameter. In pore size that exceeds 1.2 nm, the adsorption intensity between the methane molecules and the illite slit becomes stable. In this case, the average adsorption heat is measured to be 6.72 kJ/mol. Meanwhile, the monolayer of methane is adsorbed onto the pore wall and the local density of methane exhibits the characteristics evident of that of a single peak when the pore size is between 0.5 nm and 0.8 nm. The adsorption mode changes from single-layer adsorption to double-layer adsorption when the pore size is between 0.8 nm and 1.2 nm. In addition, the local density curve changes from unimodal to bimodal. In pores sized larger than 1.2 nm, the free volume of methane adsorption can be larger, wherein the local density curve is bimodal.","inCitations":["1da7fe4e13834ba9d79cb4dddbefbdf70a649651"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Molecular simulation of methane adsorption within illite minerals in the Longmaxi Formation shale based on a grand canonical Monte Carlo method and the pore size distribution in southeastern Chongqing, China","doi":"10.1016/j.jnggs.2019.04.003","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jnggs.2019.04.003","venue":""}

The dose-rate of the system using a rigid aluminum sample holder was determined by Fricke dosimetry to equal 6639 rad/min. For benzene irradiations, air-saturated aqueous solutions of benzene were prepared using doubly distilled water with initial benzene concentrations of approximately 12 mM. Aliquots of 5,000 mL of the 12 mM benzene solution were irradiated using rigid aluminum sample holders. After irradiation, each solution was subjected to reverse-phase HPLC analysis using water/methanol mobile phases. Retention times were used for the qualitative determination of radiolysis products. For quantitation, standard solutions of each radiolysis product were injected using proper column conditions. At present, product concentration versus time, or peak area versus time graphs have been prepared for benzene and for a total of 25 radiolysis products, eight of which have been identified. Typical radiolysis products include compounds such as phenol, phenylphenols, biphenyl, and terphenyls.

The example cases were analysed using assessment for learning (AfL) strategies: a running record of one child’s reading was examined while the other child’s writing was assessed applying frameworks of writing and spelling development on a writing analysis chart. The analyses suggest the influence of each child’s dominant home language and the colloquial variety of English on their learning to read and write the English of school. The study also implies a misalignment between the children’s language and that expected by the materials and tasks used; due to this, the inbuilt scaffolding of the materials did not appear to provide the children with language support. The paper argues that this kind of detailed scrutiny of individual language use, through the application of AfL techniques and contrastive linguistics, provides rich, diagnostic information about the literacy development of individual children and has yet broader implications for pedagogy. The analyses suggest that the deployment of guided pedagogies in teaching young children would enable the effective use of diagnostic information from AfL procedures and the application of contextually appropriate cross-linguistic instructional strategies. Introduction Singapore is a multilingual society with an Englishmedium education system. For many children, English is a non-dominant home language, but right from the start of their education in primary school, students must learn English and in English. The policy of bilingualism (Zulkifli, 2009) requires that all children learn English in Singapore, aiming for a standard which is ‘internationally acceptable’ (Ministry of Education (MOE), 2009a, p. 7). Children learn one other language in school known as the Mother Tongue, chosen usually from Mandarin Chinese, Malay, or Tamil. Children’s linguistic experience at home and with friends in school may be a mix of these languages and others, as well as a variety of English, such as Singapore Colloquial English (SCE) or Singapore Standard English (SSE) (Gupta, 1994). The linguistic and educational context means that teaching the subject English in Singapore does not fit neatly into any of the sub disciplines of English pedagogical theorising. It is neither a Content and Language Integrated Learning (CLIL) situation, nor typical language immersion, nor an example of sheltered instruction. English teachers teach English as a mainstream subject to classes of children who are bior multilingual to varying degrees in different languages, including English. In Singaporean society and the workplace, English and/or other languages may be spoken; as a result, children’s exposure to English outside school also varies. There is, therefore, little published guidance for teachers that is exactly relevant to this educational environment. Two major texts used in teacher preparation programmes, are Tompkins (2013) and Winch, Ross Johnston, March, Ljungdahl and Holliday (2010). Naturally, each one deals with the context of origin; the former is written for the American context and the latter for the Australian one. Both texts very usefully and comprehensively cover children’s language","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://www.alea.edu.au/documents/item/1931"],"title":"Telling Cases of Bilingual Children's Reading and Writing for English-Medium School: Implications for Pedagogy","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Most active 13 is metabolically stable in in vitro metabolism studies. In vivo studies on tetraoxanes with a C(4' ') methyl group afforded compound 15, which cured 4/5 mice at 600 and 200 mg.kg-1.day-1, and 2/5 mice at 50 mg.kg-1.day-1, showing no toxic effects. Tetraoxane 19 was an extremely active antiproliferative with LC50 of 17 nM and maximum tolerated dose of 400 mg/kg. In Fe(II)-induced scission of tetraoxane antimalarials only RO* radicals were detected by EPR experiments. This finding and the indication of Fe(IV)=O species led us to propose that RO* radicals are probably capable of inducing the parasite's death. Our results suggest that C radicals are possibly not the only lethal species derived from peroxide prodrug antimalarials, as currently believed.","inCitations":["489446c6c4b6d25c30c568d7dd0ab6ad7b27544c","1b809f624b4f501f4304ec86e8180e5aa66303fb","6029d593343433d7ed870fa2dbe2e1ee2f4417cd","ca484fc3a7ef619315f16ec121ebd18d00897dfd","c158c9e2ec0358cc430d63bdbc536713b4619017","4baec1921df74cb9c55fdf48300dc1cb8ab38f77","7ede4f9c95f66c71bce918e7ce893d8aa4307f9f","db5e49cbf4bdb7e792324b11c9e32701dd6e8dbd","86be8e8f6a5f5d616a2525b5c30f2c0eadd9e49a","5b94d223eb9de9cbc70b3f482c7f1f51bdd58f14","a2964937b338d014f86b16c7f6850b44932e05d5","5613976f620e8af3f9d29919f655c20a43e7e470","b4b647593ff0e1b1d7657341c27ebceedcd40d6d","407ab2c74619ebffc20ab3bd9f6badf5f311c7f8","e58c34205ac01c3c67ef1db94737000a8bde6817"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Tetraoxane antimalarials and their reaction with Fe(II).","doi":"10.1021/jm050966r","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1021/jm050966r","venue":"Journal of medicinal chemistry"}

The SiC Index for five years was 6.70 in Sobradinho and 7.60 in Tavares, for 12 years was 2.80 and 4.90 respectively. The need for treatment prevailing in the two cities both for 5 years to 12 years was as remineralization. Conclusions: The two cities did not meet the WHO’s goal for the year 2010 to five years. For 12 years the city of Sobradinho is very close to achieving it. The treatment needs were little complex for the two municipalities. It was found that there is need for collective and individual preventive and early diagnosis aimed at pre-school since the first permanent molars were responsible for a considerable percentage of the composition of DMFT at age 12.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://seer.upf.br/index.php/rfo/article/download/3784/3004"],"title":"Prevalência de cárie dentária em dois municípios do Rio Grande do Sul, Brasil, no ano de 2010 Prevalence of dental caries in two municipalities of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, in year of 2010","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

We tested this assumption. We measured the growth, over one year, of seedlings of Aspidosperma carapanauba (shade tolerator) and Dinizia excelsa (light demander) transplanted into understory (high aboveground competition; 1% incoming photosynthetic photon flux density [PPFD]) and single treefall gap areas (lower aboveground competition; 6% PPFD in centers of gaps) without and with trenches cut around plots (high and low belowground competition). Over the wetter six months, location in gaps significantly increased relative height growth rates by 320% and 570%, and relative leaf production rates by 190% and 280%, while trenching significantly increased height by 330% and 520%, and leaf production by 170% and 260%, for Aspidosperma and Dinizia, respectively, with significant interactions between treatments. Trenching approximately doubled height growth in the understory. Leaf loss rates were unaffected by either treatment but were 3.7 times higher in Dinizia compared with Aspidosperma. Aspidosperma could persist in the understory, as leaf production and loss were balanced at 0.60% PPFD, whereas Dinizia could not, as it required 2.4% PPFD. Reducing either aboveground competition or belowground competition allowed Dinizia to persist as leaf production was increased above unchanging leaf loss rates. Gap and trenching treatments both significantly reduced mortality rates in Dinizia. Location in gaps significantly reduced mortality rates in Aspidosperma. Both species significantly increased allocation to leaves and significantly decreased allocation to roots in response to trenching. The increased growth in the wet season caused by trenching, and increased foliar nitrogen and phosphorus amount, showed that both species were probably competing with adult trees for nutrients as well as PAR. We deduced that phosphorus did not limit growth; however, we could not deduce which nutrient did limit growth. Given that 60–70% of the world's tropical rain forests occur on low-fertility oxisols, intense adult–juvenile competition both aboveground and belowground may be the norm, not the exception.","inCitations":["4d45771206fc4311d38210633721e47a008b54aa","a5d412ad1393ac5a57035afe0e829f6aa01e5304","cfc6984a281749e041543659ca95b94b934297e1","c2ee46a34f044f8581c1454168c74e7fa68204b8","fe54072f70b5f40ff9b599f90d46c6b3f6975fb9","67cd0234d55bd95ffc9f28d0261181feede6a594","1c6de341073a9f131f2369cc7630dcc08ad7095a","7a978c10bbb9d707781ce80708f13aaafea0765e","0c728a828766f81d9fdd7d073be5f49e2e7e78d9","1e65208af8dceca3724f10cec9ab2042204bdfda","11718ea070746dc0cc9dc5ec09ace0e2c9c5b8de","7245eb0892680c6127152e533bc83180609a71da","81f13997181dd5de939cfa513f393f71267df80a","84742f15945d0be5fadd06ed043d2eac80063227","33296f0cec489e0d824f5e93a51c0a246a26d398","f1b957b9e298669ede1323938155e566378889f7","2bac6d1fc0d88d066922fb1c05341da872d8a6b6","9926761c6f93cdda310a8533543f6eb2762d9471","06ddcec477d2edaa8d9811e41f06b8374e3184d1","dd2611ecada8fcee53184ad17ff4fdb5587cc264","00642d6ae4c6ce00ec8f99c1e90fdd3c1bc13d82","aa753cb07d95358ec34f02ec31bbcd2c48baa9de","b50afde1924dda1fb7ec927e59f97418807d6f16","d1b379ccb381ebbe2c77e747859b7f7e293e8cda","442be1316a00709faec0b2307e820ede5523de51","ddbe77e454a822ea1b283f4d96e43c11eb94cdb6","ba06d625e636b54a7216301f7ada657ff7cbcff9","1c904cc5178b86a63fe7e139150ddd616bb6e293","f13b1712766a2aa23fb89ca32ed1cf622b27dbb7","2d619cbf4b07f4cea2ed11898ab00c4be42797c5","95335a96158ab438a0a6ed6f1e04c43e111868ec","4dc783dd9b86dd7302f0235014920630419f1a1e","2553d4c65f5a6ae36ce5c1e8ca61404128105c0d","9d17ccc222b57caa091b9bc0a61b5d121163e27d","e8411cfbdb02794fc5d1ab8437bcfd6b71b884ee","18a62dd96d6e49475bced626cdc61e1f4f99bc65","492d7704123a8a5b27f373a6da36baa5994630f2","e7a2819d97ad7bcfc5536b824abea6cefd9bab7d","936d573c567f999a9b5c103cce9658b992063242","187aa2cfaa6fe51d3602ad83f98ef25e52de64e0","72e6efd55f1725af9a2a41699e7e5f40a77a017d","9a83800e16fc7420c2880fb51a1d40d86cd3a8ce","022b4638af87643f2ce41b980091a836f6ecfb82","d5ae5e9e14b0bf7ff8c00a77b235bdee8fc5efb1","ea63ff4695361bec5b8bf5a6625a3806d00f4738","0fb419f77ef4d6bf6ebd2b7c82b2f4e1ecdd2648","feeba4729cc492d227ac7b56fb10704285804ed1","6ef142b6f9ea5cc8034aa3391dc30f65d6757de9","cff0fb9ec8c72a12e16f36dc7c2e3580b9bad192","caf5cf05f9ac78fe4959ca1598c6c232a811475c","75eb89c7bd0e15c8631d95414f0e67e495495908","9125fe0bb4b3709439e887716fef623625ff0707","557c810d4724db8f4b5c8755e69d0b0070247493","01335f3651585f1674459b17bc87d38813b786b1","5fc8d96032796e3372825454f8d197a05a8d2e18","7505785d4e344409370e321213c3a2bb103c3dee","6a7a5655c6dc77985a6d748603b2466369c816f8","dc8450b1e3eb44ef423d6ae45b675785836da6e9","cce91c29180e701f3d34ac7e507ecadf36012246","0f819d3d9790807fa813b3a3d46e1fade1f7f09b","861bb779cb3681dc6b515885cca5061e489d5beb","a4a0a236e12487db65c8cd7f43e345db9a3847b7","8b55e71c7836280e9c1616a4de69f4d64a1fe6e2","cdcd997fb53d32094712d0d81b0f4dc47fb64610","f646ec826712a0ad9cb82b089ae5d0b42772b009","bce68a1df4ae12a524138c68f0167831c106835c","e0fc1bde80c22ea4dd2863ef6e5fbdef2a3046ac","8c8ef7f61c0bb82cedd7f66f04ba420c52e17b3c","2a3a1461f33ae3d306cbfaf4497cb95c15763f8c","5f5e7e278f2a4ec1e855908aa71269b7ecdfa3db","eb7bd7a59cb4426b288bfeb4f174d7cff1bb95c8","71e6a3edd169cfd7ae4a7e2dfd4ab328d98614bf","f1a6e24d1777fecaeb106ae5919c79cd5600f809","6b34d312c5b269b50ef965de3a02c1319c0eb49d","67394554d4ed41d014b3ccf15d13e097ce60751a","244883b33c63ac5e5b65141c42e634ff394a3eef","298621409a461ba399ea35e49a6bc6b6b40f273d"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Effects of Above- and Belowground Competition on Growth and Survival of Rain Forest Tree Seedlings","doi":"10.1890/0012-9658(2000)081[2525:EOAABC]2.0.CO;2","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1890/0012-9658%282000%29081%5B2525%3AEOAABC%5D2.0.CO%3B2","venue":""}

He had a previous history of AMP-kinase disease associated with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and complete heart block, and a pre-existing dual chamber pacemaker. He also had a mechanical tricuspid valve replacement and mitral valve replacement, for severe tricuspid regurgitation from right ventricle (RV) lead-induced injury to the tricuspid valve and a fibroblastoma on the mitral valve. His pre-existing RV lead was maintained between the prosthetic valve annulus and the native annulus. Inability to place an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) in the RV due to the presence of a mechanical tricuspid valve replacement represented a rare but challenging clinical scenario. Surgical epicardial lead placement or the use of a subcutaneous ICD (S-ICD) were possible alternatives. Traditional ICD lead placement was favored because of the broad QRS from RV pacing meaning that use of the S-ICD was not possible due to failure of the electrocardiogram to lie within the bounds of the screening template, and the perceived high risk of repeat thoracotomy. We describe the technique for ICD lead placement in a mid-lateral cardiac venous branch of the coronary sinus with the ability to deliver anti-tachycardia pacing and cardiac resynchronization. To our knowledge this is the first report of an ICD in the mid-lateral cardiac vein, with cardiac resynchronization. <Learning objective: This case describes the technique for implantable cardioverter-defibrillator placement in the coronary sinus with biventricular pacing in a patient with a mechanical tricuspid and pre-existing right ventricular endocardial lead. This technique represents a viable alternative to repeat thoracotomy and surgical lead placement, where the risks of complication, prolonged hospital stay and lead failure are high. It also offers the ability to deliver anti-tachycardia pacing and cardiac resynchronization.>.","inCitations":["3fb7f1cc937b5ae8f686377ec906ea7a4a9c1562","3e29512997cfbe1ecbfe7ed979d95e06f2aeb3f2"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Biventricular pacing and coronary sinus ICD lead implantation in a patient with a mechanical tricuspid valve replacement.","doi":"10.1016/j.jccase.2015.08.004","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jccase.2015.08.004","venue":"Journal of cardiology cases"}
