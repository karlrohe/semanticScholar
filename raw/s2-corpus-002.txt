Recent observations of differential mortality in tag control studies suggest that fish instrumented with UCTs may be selectively targeted by marine mammal predators, thereby skewing valuable survivorship data. In order to better understand the ability of pinnipeds to detect UCT outputs, behavioral high-frequency hearing thresholds were obtained from a trained harbor seal (Phoca vitulina) and a trained California sea lion (Zalophus californianus). Thresholds were measured for extended (500 ms) and brief (10 ms) 69 kHz narrowband stimuli, as well as for a stimulus recorded directly from a Vemco V16-3H UCT, which consisted of eight 10 ms, 69 kHz pure-tone pulses. Detection thresholds for the harbor seal were as expected based on existing audiometric data for this species, while the California sea lion was much more sensitive than predicted. Given measured detection thresholds of 113 dB re 1 μPa and 124 dB re 1 μPa, respectively, both species are likely able to detect acoustic outputs of the Vemco V16-3H under water from distances exceeding 200 m in typical natural conditions, suggesting that these species are capable of using UCTs to detect free-ranging fish.","inCitations":["9c705ccd910352c13e89b4b5267f9ce9ea92e002","28f153d195aabe8df5c00054943c36a2eb7e3e16","7a40cf2dc872ffacde57d8c66f942f0a99654198","91c4cf8dba70c2b084a32192489d7b2eb4c858af","222b909271c4818b191e5fc623876bf84faa67f9","05541804fdf209899087715f486e5687b3879291","7fba127b75d8d0ddf069777dec7bb043e8765833","2f2f9ba6395eb502b64979b05eb5e7fd9675bf8b","5b6c7ab0677135be05b0ce5f473adf5bd93d610f","6cd22ca7287dd130f66bcb24d9c4fca21e67acb4","ae81c61aeda06c0aed0a74b43838172cdb909392"],"pdfUrls":["https://pinnipedlab.ucsc.edu/publications/pub_160_2014.pdf","http://pinnipedlab.ucsc.edu/publications/pub_160_2014.pdf"],"title":"Auditory detection of ultrasonic coded transmitters by seals and sea lions.","doi":"10.1121/1.4868371","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1121/1.4868371","venue":"The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America"}

This dynamic period of arc evolution is studied using a diffuse column arc model for the behavior of individual cathode spot jets burning in parallel with a high-current arc column. The model calculates a critical arc voltage, which is largely a function of the contact gap and only weakly dependent on the AMF strength. Experimental observations of the transition mode show that when the arc voltage exceeds the critical voltage, the arc is in one of two modes. The first mode consists of a central column with few or no cathode spots outside the column, and the second involves the appearance of some cathode spots outside the column. When the arc voltage drops below the critical voltage, the arc converts into a high-current diffuse mode for alternating currents ranging from 5-28 kA rms and axial magnetic field strengths from 2.5-7.5 mT/kA. Further modeling work shows that the fraction of current flowing through the column decreases with time during the transition mode.","inCitations":["3cad36218af55df03b71f64c95ff123d158f5c38","754c34613d8205ff07e334ba132613a05a8e9814"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Transition mode of the vacuum arc in an axial magnetic field: comparison of experimental results and theory","doi":"10.1109/tps.2005.856505","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/tps.2005.856505","venue":"IEEE Transactions on Plasma Science"}

Depending on the underlying surface albedo, the aerosol type, amount, shape, size and vertical distribution, the aerosol radiative forcing both at the top of the atmosphere (TOA) and the surface can either be negative or positive. This uncertainty in the sign of aerosol radiative forcing coupled with the uncertainty in its magnitude leads to large uncertainties in determining the climate change due to the aerosol-radiation interactions. An effort to understand how aerosol particles over bright surfaces impact the regional radiation budget and hence the climate was made by the dedicated UAE^2 (Unified Aerosol Experiment & United Arab Emirates) field experiment conducted over the Arabian Gulf region. Recent data shows that this region is one of the largest confluences of aerosol types in the world. The exceedingly complex meteorology, large amount of emissions, natural dust episodes and transport of smoke from the Indian subcontinent makes it a unique laboratory. The Indian Ocean basin provides a yet another unique laboratory to study aerosols over dark background. In the present study the aerosol radiative forcing over the Arabian Gulf region for the UAE^2 time period ( August 8 October 2, 2004) and over the Indian Ocean basin (Bay of Bengal and Arabian Sea) for the entire year of 2003 has been compared in order to understand the aerosol forcing over different backgrounds and its climatic implications. The suite of ground based observations over UAE^2 region coupled with observations from CERES (Clouds and Earth's Radiant Energy System), MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) and MISR(Multi-angle Imaging Spectroradiometer) satellite sensors over the two study regions, provides unique insights to our basic understanding of the aerosol-radiation interaction. Comparison of satellite based aerosol optical thickness (AOT) observations against extensive collocated measurements made over the Indian Ocean during several ship cruises in 2003 and ground based observations over Arabian Gulf will be presented. Seasonal variation of AOT and radiative forcing both at the TOA and at the surface will be discussed. The transport of aerosols to and from the Indian subcontinent will be investigated. This study is unique in that it uses a combination of a large number of ground and collocated multisensor observations to derive the required information.","inCitations":["abda8a0ef3a348e5cb5eec4ff54bed1cdfe58f93"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.atmos.uah.edu/~sundar/papers/conf/2006/falguni-ams-abstract.pdf"],"title":"Comparison of Aerosol Radiative Forcing Over Arabian Gulf and Tropical Indian Ocean : A Multi-Sensor Study","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Because of the limited energy of sensor nodes, many WSNs work in a low duty cycle mode to effectively extend their network lifetime. However, low duty cycling also decreases transmission efficiency and makes data gathering more challenging. By exploiting the redundancy of in real sensing data, we propose a novel and distributed approach for data gathering in wireless sensor networks, employing the compressed sensing theory. Instead of selecting a fixed sink, all data can be retrieved from an arbitrary node within the network. Moreover, we use sequential observations to dynamically fit the sparsity of various data sets. With extensive simulations, we show that our approach is efficient with tunable accuracy in different node duty cycles.","inCitations":["748bacb9e5436d29d5d72fe9d639987586fadffa"],"pdfUrls":["http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/PCCC.2014.7017113"],"title":"Distributed compressive data gathering in low duty cycled wireless sensor networks","doi":"10.1109/PCCC.2014.7017113","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PCCC.2014.7017113","venue":"2014 IEEE 33rd International Performance Computing and Communications Conference (IPCCC)"}

These equivalences are in turn used to simplify analysis and synthesis for these models. In system theory, a similar notion is also of interest in order to develop modular analysis and design tools for purely continuous or hybrid control systems. In this paper, we introduce two notions of bisimulation for nonlinear systems. We present a differential-algebraic characterization of these notions and show that bisimilar systems of different dimensions are obtained by factoring out certain invariant distributions. Furthermore, we also show that all bisimilar systems of different dimension are of this form. Comments Copyright 2002 IEEE.

Thus, understanding connector deterioration used in high mileage vehicles is important when developing vehicle connectors. In this study, used connectors were collected from used vehicles, and investigated for deterioration and possible deterioration factors. In addition, the investigation results were comparatively evaluated with the results of a fretting corrosion*1 bench test in order to determine the number of fretting cycles that is equivalent to the actual vehicle mileage.

An average yield of 600 cells per islet was obtained, 84% of the cells being beta-cells. Cells were incubated with radioactive chromium as a marker of cell viability. Optimal labelling of 1--2 cpm per cell was obtained by incubating 10(5) cells with 10(6) cpm of [51]Cr for 90 min. When islet cells were incubated with streptozotocin, this drug induced [51]Cr-release after a lag time of 2--4 hours. Furthermore, a positive correlation between streptozotocin concentrations and [51]Cr-release was found. This assay of cytotoxicity was highly reproducible and might be applicable in the study of other beta-cell damaging agents or autoimmune phenomena in the pathogenesis of diabetes.","inCitations":["6ac2ff297bcc982a988349528b4a2455f36520cd","97d06be42f8835d852259d4fdb936429b40f3296"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Direct streptozotocin toxicity on dispersed mouse islet cells determined by [51]Cr-release.","doi":"","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"Medical biology"}

Here, however, this optimistic vision is challenged by placing Argentina within a new metanarrative of global divergence during the long nineteenth century. A massive terms-of-trade boom – the extent of which has not previously been appreciated – had profoundly uneven impacts across the periphery. Where land was abundant, frontiers could expand, leading to dramatic extensive (that is, aggregate) growth. An expanding frontier then had a safety-valve effect on labour markets, so capitalists responded to high wages by mechanising production, which raised labour productivity and, consequently, per capita incomes. In the land-scarce periphery, by contrast, deindustrialisation led to increasing quantities of labour receiving diminishing returns by being applied to limited land resources. Similarly, Argentina’s own century-long terms-of-trade boom allowed the Littoral to prosper but made the more densely populated interior stagnate. The presence of the poor interior then prevented the country from developing the kind of white-egalitarian democracy that had allowed the prosperous European offshoots to make the transition to rapid intensive (that is, per capita) growth. Most importantly, Argentina’s political backwardness ensured that landownership remained concentrated, which muted the safety-valve effect of the expanding frontier, so capitalists did not make the same investments in laboursaving technologies. The new metanarrative of global divergence thus leads to a far more pessimistic revision of Argentina at the beginning of the twentieth century – a revision that is verified through a comparative assessment of its living standards that shows them to have been considerably below the levels of Northern Europe and the European offshoots. Argentina’s ‘golden age’ is therefore a myth.","inCitations":["31882cfff861a468b7d7cdd354d6dd6c2c7e174f","8595952ad8eeeebd4ef03fe41a2cdee22738277d","bd5dbaaff3bc59ebb39f4aa5d671f951e724049f"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.joefrancis.info/pdfs/Francis_PhD_diss.pdf","http://etheses.lse.ac.uk/918/1/Francis_Terms-of-trade-rise-of-Argentina-19thC.pdf"],"title":"The terms of trade and the rise of Argentina in the long nineteenth century","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

The distributions of the errors were examined to ensure that the higher accuracy was significant clinically as well.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe (MAEs, RMSEs) were smaller for PCI of (0.5106 diopter (D), 0.6037D) than for IUB of (0.7000D, 0.8062D). The higher accuracy was principally contributedfrom negative errors, i.e., myopia. The MAEs and RMSEs for (IUB, PCI)'s negative errors were (0.7955D, 0.5185D) and (0.8562D, 0.5853D). Their differences were significant. The 72.34% of PCI errors fell within a clinically accepted range of ± 0.50D, whereas 50% of IUB errors did.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nPCI's higher accuracy was significant statistically and clinically, meaning that lens implantation based on PCI's assignments could improve postoperative outcomes over those based on IUB's assignments.","inCitations":["435fa62aaa7b157cb38b9cb42876f292b2bb68ef"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Comparison of Accuracy in Intraocular Lens Power Calculation by Measuring Axial Length with Immersion Ultrasound Biometry and Partial Coherence Interferometry.","doi":"","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"Journal of the Medical Association of Thailand = Chotmaihet thangphaet"}

This electrode showed good catalytic effect on oxidation of amino acid tyrosine (Tyr) in voltammetric studies. It can improve the anodic peak current of Tyr significantly and also decrease the oxidation overpotential of this amino acid. The peak current increased by two times and the overpotential is decreased more than 110 mV. The enhancing of oxidation signal of Tyr at modified electrode is related to the improving the electron transfer rate at these nanoparticles and increasing the active surface area of the modified electrode by the nanoparticles. This electrode was used as an electrochemical sensor for the measurement of Tyr by differential pulse voltammetry. The anodic peak current was linearly related to Tyr concentration in the range from 0.8 μM to 300.0 μM and the detection limit was calculated as 0.15 μM (S/N = 3). The presence of ascorbic acid, dopamine, glucose and a number of ions could not affect the Tyr measurement. Finally, the proposed sensor was successfully used for measurement of Tyr in real samples.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://www.analchemres.org/article_85016_5450daf609715999c6c8641806b68aee.pdf"],"title":"Electroanalysis of Amino Acid Tyrosine by an Electrochemical Sensor Modified by Strontium Ferrite Nanostructure","doi":"10.22036/abcr.2019.149787.1258","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.22036/abcr.2019.149787.1258","venue":""}

For me, that is the most intriguing, frustrating, and perplexing question at the heart of any meaningful Shakespearean authorship debate, because it incorporates all the other important questions at a tangible, material, historical, textual level. If we could answer it with any assurance, we would answer so many other questions at the same time. We would understand the nature of the dramatist's relationship with his fellow actors; why he chose not to put his own plays into print; whether he wrote only for performance, or at least in part with a view to being read. There is even a good chance that we could lay to rest, once and for all, the infuriating drone of those who persist in doubting that William Shakespeare of Stratford-upon-Avon was the only begetter, more or less, of the plays accorded by modern scholarship to the dramatist of that name. Even among literary scholars it is often not appreciated how unique is this multiplicity of Shakespearean texts, and to those outside the field it can be a source of wonder. A professor of mechanics was once pretty much gobsmacked to discover that the phrase \"an enginer hoist with his own petard\" is not in the First Folio text of Hamlet, indeed that \"Hamlet is, or was, not one clear item but an indefinite thing which is in parts of uncertain authenticity.\" (1) Those of us who are less surprised at this would nevertheless do well to try to retain something of that sense of amazement at what is in fact a unique phenomenon. The very fact that there are multiple versions of the plays--and not least of some of his finest plays, among the greatest plays in the language, including Hamlet, Othello, and Lear--is an utterly distinctive defining characteristic of Shakespeare as an \"author.\" Analogies are sometimes drawn with the endless manuscript variants we find in the texts of such as Sidney and Donne, which were circulated for coterie consumption. But that will not answer for dramatic texts produced by a professional playwright. Among comparable contemporaries, only Jonson has left a trail of early and later versions of most of the plays reprinted in his 1616 Works. But in his case the certainty of Jonson's own hand in all stages of composition, and an apparent purpose--to impose himself on readers as a contemporary classic--leaves little mystery about the fact of revision, and makes it easy for us (at times, perhaps too easy) to discern Jonson's own sense of himself as an author. Or at least such a sense of himself as he wanted to make public. But we have no such pre-scripted narrative of the multiple Shakespeare texts. Nor can we draw analogies with such as Marlowe, Greene, Heywood, or Dekker, none of whom left us with such bibliographic profusion. Shakespeare is unique and sui generis in this, as in so much else. The fact is that we do not know why there are multiple versions of Shakespeare's plays, or what the relationships between the various versions are. But, in the absence of that knowledge, scholars and mystics of all complexions--especially editors and bibliographers-have imagined the answers for themselves, and have in the process invented a Shakespearean \"author\" (or rather, a string of Shakespearean \"authors\") to suit themselves. So the New Bibliographers--McKerrow, Greg, and others--invented tales of textual piracy to explain the baddest of the \"bad\" quartos, and of adaptations for down-at-heal provincial touring to explain somewhat less bad (but still sadly sullied) versions of the plays. Such scholars were implicitly tied to a romantic or Arnoldian view of the \"author\" as a genius, whose words were therefore sacred, and it was their job to sift the authentic word of the master from all contaminating dross, whether it derived from the work of pirates or even the professional ministrations of Shakespeare's fellow actors. Tales of \"foul papers,\" of scribal fair copies, and of playhouse prompt copies grew up alongside those of \"bad\" quartos, to help discriminate the sacred text from lesser witnesses (though few of these mythic beasts have survived to provide us with anything as unsportsmanlike as actual evidence). …","inCitations":["b551ead228e26b781f15424647b114a18824ec96"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Not One Clear Item but an Indefinite Thing Which Is in Parts of Uncertain Authenticity","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Currently numerous organizations are engaged in spreading awareness about breast cancer but the credit of visibilizing it appertains to the feminist movements of the 1960s and 1970s. Breast cancer attracted generous literary representations from 1970s and was widely believed to be the product of the feminist movement. Taking these cues, the present paper seeks to investigate the following: a) how did feminism as a socio-political movement influence and alter the breast cancer discourse? b) did feminism facilitate the sick person to confront the disease or did it merely add to the dilemma of the disease? Further, the essay also aims to delineate a specific historical trajectory of the breast cancer narratives in relation to the feminist movements.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"From Diaries to Virtual Narratives: Breast Cancer and Feminism","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

of performance. This problem is known to be NP-hard, and is particularly challenging if the chip dimensions are fixed. Fixed-outline floorplanning is becoming increasingly important as a tool to design flows in the hierarchical design of Application Specific Integrated Circuits and System-On-Chip. Therefore, it has recently received much attention. A two-stage convex optimization methodology is proposed to solve the fixedoutline floorplanning problem. It is a global optimization problem for wirelength minimization. In the first stage, an attractor-repeller convex optimization model provides the relative positions of the modules on the floorplan. The second stage places and sizes the modules using convex optimization. Given the relative positions of the modules from the first stage, a Voronoi diagram and Delaunay triangulation method is used to obtain a planar graph and hence a relative position matrix connecting the two stages. An efficient method for generating sparse relative position matrices and an interchange-free algorithm for local improvement of the floorplan are also presented. Experimental results on the standard benchmarks MCNC and GSRC demonstrate that we obtain significant improvements on the best results in the literature. Overlapfree and deadspace-free floorplans are achieved in a fixed outline and floorplans with any specified percentage of whitespace can be produced. Most important, our method provides a greater improvement as the number of modules increases. A very important feature of our methodology is that not only do the dimensions of the floorplans in our experiments comply with the original ones provided in the GSRC benchmark, but also zero-deadspace floorplans can be obtained. Thus, our approach is able to guarantee complete area utilization in a fixed-outline situation. Our method is also applicable to area minimization in classical floorplanning. iii Acknowledgements Firstly, I would like to sincerely and deeply acknowledge my academic advisors, Prof. Anthony Vannelli and Prof. Miguel F.

The study area is Khon Kaen City which consists of 5 municipalities, Khon Kaen,Sila, Mueang Kao, Ban Ped and Phra Lab. 407 persons are interviewed. Among these respondents,195 use bicycles, and 212 do not. The study indicates that most people usually use bicycle for traveling within 4-6 km. from their houses. The main purpose of biking are traveling to store in a village, markets, public park. Two main reasons of using bicycle for Khon Kaen residents are a short route to destination and exercising. However, because of the weather is not suitable for cycling, road conditions, traffic congestion, and high speed of vehicles on main roads, people feel unsafe to bike on the street. Besides the longer travel time of biking when compare with other modes of traveling, people in Khon Kaen City hardly use bicycles.","inCitations":["c0f8614ed5a5223900884c09953c92f1bcc5feb0"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"การศึกษาพฤติกรรมเดินทางของผู้ใช้จักรยาน เพื่อหาแนวทางสนับสนุนให้เลือกใช้จักรยานในเขตเมืองขอนแก่น An - Investigation of Cycling Behavior for Bike Use Policy in Khon Kaen City","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

When I read it as a graduate student fifteen years ago, I was amazed by how well it described what I was seeing in history classrooms on the Thai-Myanmar border, where I had been working with refugees from Myanmar’s long-running civil war. The military regime’s textbooks marginalised ethnic minorities and cast the majority Burmans as national heroes, which fueled conflict. Yet I hoped that teachers from different ethnic groups could come together to create a new curriculum that would foment reconciliation. I was not the only one to see the two faces of education in this setting; other scholars (Oh and Van der Stouwe, 2008) also applied Bush and Saltarelli’s (2000) theory to the schooling of refugees from Myanmar. Reading Compare, I find that this binary characterisation of education in conflict is common. Alan Smith (2005) outlined the possibility for education to ‘exacerbate or ameliorate’ (373) conflict. Lynn Davies (2005) investigated how schools can perpetuate or mitigate conflict. Fontana (2016) examined the two hypotheses that religious education could lead to social cohesion or worsen existing divisions. Most recently, Dunlop and King (2019) found that while peace agreements in Africa treat education ‘as a positive social good,’ most fail to acknowledge that ‘education was a direct or indirect cause of the violence’ (16). It is not the urge to sensationalise that draws us to the extremes of education; each of these scholars engaged rigorously and enriched our understanding of the range of educational possibilities. As valuable as these analyses are, they may contribute to an either/or mentality that leaves us with an undertheorised middle ground. I have become interested in education’s third face: neither the bad sort that perpetuates war nor the good sort that delivers social transformation, but the sort that may be more common in conflict or post-conflict situations: well-intentioned if theoretically muddled; passably executed; somewhat problematic; and having mixed effects on society. If education has a happy face and a sad, mad face, it also has a ‘meh’ face. While this so-so education lacks the shock value of truly bad education or the inspiring promise of great education, everyday mediocrity may be where the work of reform can be done most effectively. Some scholars have drawn attention to the nuances of education’s role in conflict.

The prevalence rate of strabismus was higher in grade 7 students than grade 1 students with borderline significance (2.44%vs1.50%, p=0.07), but was similar by gender (2.16% in boys vs 1.68% in girls, p=0.36).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe prevalence of amblyopia and strabismus in Chinese Hani school children are both lower than that previously reported for Chinese Han children in China and for many other racial/ethnic populations from non-China studies. Refractive error is the major cause for amblyopia and intermittent exotropia is the primary strabismus type.","inCitations":["6d4f5fbad41ba44f1a0fbb8793e6bb709b8beee8","8b1f6538422c615000488ba8fba1f3951261f24c","17f8731efc97caf1074b0dba67554cddf60db2e2"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Prevalence of amblyopia and strabismus in Hani school children in rural southwest China: a cross-sectional study","doi":"10.1136/bmjopen-2018-025441","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2018-025441","venue":"BMJ open"}

It is unknown if reciprocal interactions between CD72 and CD5 exert an autocrine growth-promoting or -inhibiting effect. CD5+ (n = 13) and CD5- (n = 9) B cell malignancies were cultured with the anti-CD72 mAb WL225. For comparison, five other anti-CD72 mAbs were tested. Only CD5+ B cell malignancies proliferated upon CD72 activation (9 out of 13 cases). A strong suppressive effect of IL-4 on the anti-CD72-induced [3H]thymidine incorporation, partially caused by downmodulation of the CD72 expression, was seen. Stimulation of the CD5 antigen by L cells transfected with human CD72 (LhCD72) and the anti-CD5 mAb 1C12 exerted no (n = 9) or a minor effect (2 out of 8 cases), respectively. Finally, the results of CD72 stimulation were compared with CD40 stimulation, as this \"CD40 system\" is an effective method for stimulating B cell malignancies.

They should be used at the lowest level at which the desired technological effect is achieved in a specific food category and at amounts not exceeding the maximums set by European Commission Regulation No. 1129/2011. In order to be able to evaluate whether these emulsifiers are used correctly but also to evaluate whether the commercial additive formulations comply with legislation, a quantitative GC-FID method was developed. An internal standard (nonadecanoyl-1-lactylate) was synthesized in-house and pure ester standards were isolated from commercial additive formulations. The method showed a limit of detection of 0.04 and a limit of quantification of 0.12 mg esters ml−1. The commercial additive formulations analysed proved to be complex mixtures of free lactic and fatty acids together with only 50–60% esters. Besides SLs important amounts of palmitoyl-lactylates were present. Different food matrices (with low- and high-fat contents) were spiked with commercial SL formulations and recoveries ranged between 85% and 109%. Determination of SLs in commercial foods (such as bakery and bread) indicated that pre-treatment with amylase was essential to determine accurately the SL content due to the interaction of SL with the amylose.

Symptoms of poisoning are characterized by acute cholinergic crisis caused by inhibition of acetylcholinesterase. A 75-year-old male patient ingested 20ml of an OPP solution containing 10% methamidophos in suicidal intent. In the course of poisoning typical clinical symptoms of cholinergic crisis (miosis, bradycardia, hypotension, hypersalivation and impairment of neurologic status) were evident. Butyryl (plasma) cholinesterase (BChE) and red blood cell acetylcholinesterase (RBC-AChE) revealed decreased activities, thus specific treatment with the enzyme reactivator obidoxime was started. Inhibitory activity of the patient's plasma indicated significant amounts of persisting methamidophos in the circulation and was still found on day 4 after ingestion. Due to missing spontaneous breathing on day 6, obidoxime was administered again. Afterwards a significant increase of RBC-AChE activity was found. The patient was extubated on day 10 and a restitution ad integrum was achieved. In conclusion, obidoxime is a potent reactivator of OPP-inhibited AChE. A repetitive and prolonged administration of obidoxime should be considered in cases of severe methamidophos poisoning and should be tailored with an advanced analytical biomonitoring.","inCitations":["7ee41a8e1f9c1dc3fa9726d142c5cce6ac8d8b84","aea7bf6077fcabad72de4d66bcd2ee723708f052"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Repetitive obidoxime treatment induced increase of red blood cell acetylcholinesterase activity even in a late phase of a severe methamidophos poisoning: A case report.","doi":"10.1016/j.toxlet.2015.07.010","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.toxlet.2015.07.010","venue":"Toxicology letters"}
