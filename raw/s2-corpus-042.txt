In samples deuterated from a plasma excited at 13.56MHz, the incorporated deuterium concentration is saturated at 6×1018cm−3 throughout the entire 1.2μm epi-ZnO thickness at 250°C. This deuterium is stable against reverse bias application at 25°C for 24h. By sharp contrast, deuterium incorporated from exposure to D2 gas at 100°C can be entirely removed by reverse (negative) bias application in a diode structure using a Pt contact on the n-type ZnO. These results are consistent with the state of the deuterium in the ZnO being a function of both the concentration and the flux during incorporation. At low concentrations, the deuterium is likely to be in a positively charged atomic form or bound in defects that are readily dissociated by an electric field, while at higher concentrations the deuterium may be in neutral states such as D2 or OH complexes.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Incorporation and drift of hydrogen at low temperatures in ZnO","doi":"10.1063/1.2711201","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1063/1.2711201","venue":""}

This includes excess medical costs of approximately $8.7 billion and lost productivity costs of $4.2 billion. On average, the cost of health care for a person with diabetes is more than five times as much as the cost for those without diabetes—$13,000 vs. $2,500. In response, the New York State Health Foundation (NYSHealth) launched a $35 million, five-year Diabetes Campaign in 2008 to reverse the diabetes epidemic.

This program focuses on a detailed phenomenological analysis of human physiology and signatures with the subsequent identification and characterization of potential observables--particularly in the context of urban environments. For this current effort, several electro-optical sensing modalities have been evaluated for use as a component in an unattended sensor suite designed to detect personnel. These modalities include active sensors (e.g., vibrometry) and passive sensors (e.g., multi-spectral, thermal). Within the urban environment, illumination conditions can vary widely and change dynamically during the course of a day. This paper will discuss those issues and present a computational approach to computing the radiative exchange environment and the corresponding thermal signatures of personnel in these environments. Consideration will also be given to the impact of these variations on thermal signatures of clutter objects.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Thermal signatures of personnel in urban environments","doi":"10.1117/12.784970","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1117/12.784970","venue":"SPIE Defense + Commercial Sensing"}

Patients underwent pH-impedance monitoring and recording of lung sounds (WHolter®). Results: The median number of cough events associated with weakly acid reflux in the group of patients with positive impedance monitoring was significantly higher than the median of cough associated with weakly acid and non-acid reflux in the group of patients with negative impedance monitoring (p = 0.003). The median number of events of wheezing ≥5% associated with an episode of acid reflux was significantly higher (p = 0.008) in the group of patients with positive 24-hr pH monitoring than those with negative 24-hr pH monitoring.

The paleomagnetic poles of most of the seamounts in our study area generally cluster around the Pacific Apparent Polar Wander Path (APWP). However, those that deviate significantly from the APWP are located south of the fracture zone. The seamounts in our study area can also be divided into two groups on the basis of complexity of the observed magnetic field anomaly. In general, simple conical seamounts exhibit a dipole-like field anomaly pattern with a paired anomaly low and high, and can be explained to a large extent by a uniformly magnetized source. On the other hand, those with complex morphology are larger in size, show multiple magnetic lows and highs and lie very close to or within the fracture zones, suggesting that they were formed by multi-stage volcanism.","inCitations":["3653c6fbb631d08bab434819c6cd62bda6a948ec","50c28388f8be85679cf953ef2b82be6bf974aefb","c76bb3cca7be812aeb886b187a520c35c58d8f44"],"pdfUrls":["https://earth-planets-space.springeropen.com/track/pdf/10.1186/BF03351769","http://www.terrapub.co.jp/journals/EPS/pdf/2003/5506/55060355.pdf"],"title":"Paleomagnetic investigation of seamounts in the vicinity of Ogasawara Fracture Zone northwest of the Marshall Islands, western Pacific","doi":"10.1186/BF03351769","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1186/BF03351769","venue":""}

It is not known if pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators in ARDS induced by i-I/R can be controlled by low-level laser therapy (LLLT). This study was designed to evaluate the effect of LLLT on tracheal cholinergic reactivity dysfunction and the release of inflammatory mediators from the lung after i-I/R. Anesthetized rats were subjected to superior mesenteric artery occlusion (45 min) and killed after clamp release and preestablished periods of intestinal reperfusion (30 min, 2 or 4 h). The LLLT (660 nm, 7.5 J/cm2) was carried out by irradiating the rats on the skin over the right upper bronchus for 15 and 30 min after initiating reperfusion and then euthanizing them 30 min, 2, or 4 h later. Lung edema was measured by the Evans blue extravasation technique, and pulmonary neutrophils were determined by myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity. Pulmonary tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-10 (IL-10), intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), and isoform of NO synthase (iNOS) mRNA expression were analyzed by real-time PCR. TNF-α, IL-10, and iNOS proteins in the lung were measured by the enzyme-linked immunoassay technique. LLLT (660 nm, 7.5 J/cm2) restored the tracheal hyperresponsiveness and hyporesponsiveness in all the periods after intestinal reperfusion. Although LLLT reduced edema and MPO activity, it did not do so in all the postreperfusion periods. It was also observed with the ICAM-1 expression. In addition to reducing both TNF-α and iNOS, LLLT increased IL-10 in the lungs of animals subjected to i-I/R. The results indicate that LLLT can control the lung's inflammatory response and the airway reactivity dysfunction by simultaneously reducing both TNF-α and iNOS.","inCitations":["128e84e28e9c41ac293b4728a4c581f25722165f","270f2915348021fc2b18620913abf4c4ef2f5623","50c84656d55b53a0ae0790e4d2c31536ab4d0ad0","1f4d90cbe5fdba4db64e9d958232352d8913df6c","8fc9997399c96ba9627d2536e39896390e246aa0","b779b40d3c6d39352b8f2fe5cea9cf42b0739814","7b88b1cc12375e7b21a123d11e0cdfa21304226e","1b1e2abaab3a947bf0643111b4e0047f2ebc34f7","8d62032cbb38836fa7ca198fd96175b549a89857","61c521366169970ebba8b18574eed02eb641c5f0","0e2c58909b41c235da6655b0a482b434383d733e","6cdea6a8af3d1b47b0c5f6bf613bbd45bdf5ade9","4cae745a112ab4e0285a241419c8ba326865f4d5","3dc36a0e63569f24b0a03c73d06200f9e1bf6655"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Suppressive effect of low-level laser therapy on tracheal hyperresponsiveness and lung inflammation in rat subjected to intestinal ischemia and reperfusion","doi":"10.1007/s10103-012-1088-1","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10103-012-1088-1","venue":"Lasers in Medical Science"}

Although PET is considered to be the technique of choice, both isotopes and stress echocardiography have demonstrated their usefulness in clinical practice. While the former has high sensitivity, the latter has better specificity. The differences in results between these two techniques may be due to the fact that they each evaluate different aspects: isotopes detect the presence of viable cells, whereas echocardiography assesses the contractility reserve of hibernating myocardium. If by viability we mean improvement in contractility, stress echocardiography should be considered the technique of choice. Although this technique is considered to be partially limited by image quality and inter-observer variability, recent technological advances should overcome these problems.

One hundred fifty pregnant women (79 never-smokers and 71 antenatal quitters) from two obstetrics and gynecology clinics were recruited in Japan. Subjects' prepregnancy nutritional status was indicated by their body mass index (BMI). In the first trimester, their dietary profiles were assessed by the Brief Diet-History Questionnaire (BDHQ) and pregnancy outcomes were screened by biomarker tests. Generalized linear regression was used to examine the differences of energy-adjusted dietary intakes and biomarker results between the two smoking groups, with adjustment of maternal age, BMI, gestation week, and parity. The results showed that antenatal quitters were more likely to have a prepregnancy underweight status than never-smokers. During the first trimester, antenatal quitters had significantly higher intakes of unsaturated fatty acids and antioxidants (vegetable lipids and isoflavone), and lower intakes of total cholesterol than never-smokers. Moreover, antenatal quitters had a significantly higher level of serum homocysteine (6.36 nmol/mL vs 4.88 nmol/mL) than never-smokers. In conclusion, antenatal quitters are more likely to have a poor nutritional status before pregnancy than never-smokers. Quitting smoking before pregnancy and having a good nutritional profile during the trimester may not sufficiently reverse the adverse effects of former smoking behaviors on pregnancy outcomes.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Nutritional Epidemiology of Antenatal Smoking Cessation Among Japanese Women.","doi":"10.1080/01635581.2016.1152381","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1080/01635581.2016.1152381","venue":"Nutrition and cancer"}

By giving this foundation a distinct name, it was hoped that CDHNF (and ultimately the membership of NASPGHAN) would benefit from a wider donor base and thus an increased potential for fundraising. To ensure a strong link between NASPGHAN and CDHNF, the CDHNF Board was structured to include the president, past president, and secretary-treasurer of NASPGHAN plus a minimum of 4 additional NASPGHAN members at large. In an attempt to ensure a diverse representation, there were also 3 board positions created for lay members.","inCitations":["9d20333d12507bbc1b1f8c1bb81e7e784e297345"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Children's Digestive Health and Nutrition Foundation: building on the past, a foundation for the future.","doi":"10.1097/MPG.0b013e3181cc7ea4","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1097/MPG.0b013e3181cc7ea4","venue":"Journal of pediatric gastroenterology and nutrition"}

The phytochemical composition was assessed as well by means of gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and high performance thin layer chromatography (HPTLC). The antioxidant properties were assessed using the DPPH and β-carotene bleaching test. The ability of extracts to protect against lipid peroxidation was also examined in rat-liver microsomal membranes. All the samples showed a preservation of antioxidant activity up to 60 min. A significant inhibitory activity on the production of the pro-inflammatory mediator nitric oxide was induced in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells by the dichloromethane fraction of C. album extract, with an IC50 value equal to 81.7 ± 0.9 μg/mL. The same sample showed also a concentration-dependent anti-denaturation effect on heat-treated bovine serum albumin (IC50 = 975.6 ± 5.5 μg/mL), even if the best in vitro anti-arthritic activity was observed for the dichloromethane fraction of S. officinale extract, with an IC50 value of 680.9 ± 13.2 μg/mL.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://res.mdpi.com/d_attachment/plants/plants-08-00505/article_deploy/plants-08-00505.pdf"],"title":"Chenopodium album L. and Sisymbrium officinale (L.)

This chapter is focused on the biological and pathological role(s) of sirtuins in health and neurodegeneration. In the central nervous system, sirtuins are broadly expressed as full-length proteins and as alternatively spliced isoforms. The chapter summarizes available data on cellular and tissue distribution of sirtuin family members in order to contextualize sirtuin biology. Sirtuins influence multiple biological pathways and are known as master regulators of metabolism. The putative role(s) of sirtuin members as modulators of aging is of particular interest and is also discussed. We then provide a summary of sirtuin functions and regulatory mechanisms, untangled in broad studies in vitro and in vivo experimental model systems. Furthermore, we discuss the experimental evidences on the biological and therapeutic roles of sirtuins in major age-associated neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, Huntington’s disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. We also summarize the advances in the development of sirtuin-based therapeutics for the treatment of these neurodegenerative conditions. Lastly, we conclude the chapter with our view on future perspectives of sirtuin research in the context of the brain.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Sirtuins in brain and neurodegenerative disease","doi":"10.1016/B978-0-12-813499-3.00013-7","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-813499-3.00013-7","venue":""}

The data presented were collected primarily in 1975 and 1976 for a project which was funded by the British Overseas Development Ministry and the University of Leeds. This included a study of 5 case study areas in different provinces believed to be representative of the Andean region of Ecuador. These areas were characterized by a high level of emigration over the last 2 decades. Questionnaires were completed at interviews with a 20% sample of the occupied houses in the different parishes of the case study areas in 1975-1976. The questionnaires were designed to identify patterns of migration in the highlands the characteristics of those who did and did not migrate and any impact that these may have had on local farming. Analysis of both census and survey data reveals that the average years of school experience of the population of Ecuador diminishes as size and social and political importance of settlement decreases. This is exemplified by data for the province of Loja which contrasts the educational experience of the whole province with that of 1 canton within it and 1 of the parishes within the canton. These data are representative of the general patterns of education in Ecuador as a whole. In the example the educational level of people in the canton is greater than in the parish and less than in the province at every stage of education but the difference increases sharply at secondary and tertiary levels. A survey of attitudes toward education in the parish showed that parents saw education as a means for improving their childrens opportunity for obtaining nonagricultural employment. Recent migrants from the case study areas have traveled mostly to urban centers. The marked differences which exist between educational opportunities and aspirations in central and peripheral locations in the parishes and which are reflected in different degrees of migration to distinct destinations are a result of the dependence of the periphery on the center for the provision of services particularly education. In addition the periphery depends on the center for the feeling of social and economic inferiority which is a powerful encouragement to emigration. The unequal nature of the relationship between vvillage and rural hinterland is believed to be ingrained in society and some rural people simply move to areas where such rural-urban interaction is less observable or irrelevant (large cities). People in the parish centers feeling their inferiority to canton capitals or regional centers migrate to larger urban centers occupying a superior position in the urban hierarchy.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Dependency migration and education at a community level in highland Ecuador","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Meanwhile BP neural network has been applied in many fields. But traditional BP neural network has some faults, such as bad convergence rate and low learning rate aiming at huge date sets, poor generalization, poor ability of error weight update and batch learning. Aiming at these faults, some improved methods are proposed to solve these problems, one of methods is BP neural network based on Kalman Filter which can solve before-mentioned faults partly. But present methods of BP neural network based on Kalman Filter can not do batch processing and study multi-sample conditions. Improved BP neural network based on Kalman Filter is proposed depending on present BP neural network based on Kalman Filter. The idea of new method includes two steps, firstly we obtain the update of estimation weight, secondly we use the obtained results to mend the Kalman Gain for new update of time and measurement, at the some time the new algorithm can adopt batch processing to learning neural network. Experiments show the new algorithm can solve high-dimensional, large computation problem, keeping robustness and improving the learning efficiency.","inCitations":["9a535e0ac81269a8eb5e2af6bea24e1cc6ed7fa3"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"A Kind Improved Model of Information Fusion","doi":"10.1109/ISBIM.2008.143","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISBIM.2008.143","venue":"2008 International Seminar on Business and Information Management"}

A thyroid ultrasound examination was performed with number and size of nodules being recorded. Metabolic parameters including body mass index (BMI), blood pressure (BP), triglycerides (TG), total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c), fasting glucose (FG), and uric acid (UA) were also examined. Our study revealed that approximately 30.7% of men and 39.9% of women in Northwest China had TN, about half of which were multi-nodularity and a quarter of their TN larger than 1 cm. The prevalence of TN increased with aging and increasing BMI, and metabolic disorders, which also related to the increased incident of multi-nodularity and larger TN. Serum UA appeared to be a protective factor for TN in men older than 30 years, but a risk factor in both men younger than 30 years and women older than 30 years. This phenomenon needs to be further investigated.","inCitations":["31642b13fe97682be2686295b0af955053115186","4e74f61f566e569477f4ce4483d61c8962b09452","a0fd4c1f98d20cb18bc88ec911ffb3b64917f64e","1619fda11ccb06b968ba89b0051877f3b76b1e9d","08e7030e9120c194d91896f7883a231db363c283","682942c77c8f22c9df0adf46f5b20255406833ee"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.oncotarget.com/index.php?journal=oncotarget&op=download&page=article&path%5B%5D=14720&path%5B%5D=46998"],"title":"The prevalence of thyroid nodules in northwest China and its correlation with metabolic parameters and uric acid","doi":"10.18632/oncotarget.14720","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.18632/oncotarget.14720","venue":"Oncotarget"}

In the present paper, we give a much simpler expression of the Laplace transform of the joint distribution, and we also show, using Complex Analysis techniques, that both Laplace transforms can be extended to the complex plane.

New technologies and systems, however, often fail to live up to promised potential due to organizational resistance. The research problem of this monograph is to consider if current Navy culture (specifically the sub-culture of the Surface Warfare community) is compatible with NCW technologies and concepts. The research method for this monograph consists of using an historical case study as a point of reference and then draws parallels to contemporary Navy transformation. The historical case study used is the installation of radar onboard surface combatants in the Pacific at the beginning of the Second World War. The monograph demonstrates that the actions of U.S. Navy surface commanders during early engagement with Japanese Naval forces were consistent with existing culture despite the fact that such actions were counterproductive to the effective employment of radar. As a result, Navy surface forces suffered significant defeats, despite having a decisive technological advantage over the Japanese forces. Regarding contemporary Navy transformation, elements of Navy culture were identified that will potentially hinder the effective integration of Network Centric Warfare systems and concepts.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Hollow Promises: The Problem of Culture and the Integration of New Technology into the Navy","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Adhesion performances of these samples on porcine skin were evaluated by performing a T-peel test. Analysis of the HEC/TAPE-gelatin interface showed that the HEC cross-linking agent formulation, adhesive thickness, and presence of surface ridges showed significant three-way interaction effects, and these parameters were modeled using orthogonal polynomials and optimized via response surface methodology (RSM). The adhesion on the HEC-TAPE-gelatin interface was also investigated further using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), where it had been observed that greater adhesion occurred with a decrease in cross-linking density, thinner adhesive layer, and the presence of ridges. Lastly, disk diffusion testing indicated greater antimicrobial activity (mean inhibition zone = 12 mm) against S. aureus and P. aeruginosa in contrast to commercial hydrogel dressings (mean inhibition zone = 7.5 mm), while MTT assay on human lymphocytes resulted to a 98% cell survival rate. Based on these results, it was concluded that it is feasible to use HEC hydrogel with TAPE-gelatin adhesive for manufacturing self-adhesive wound dressing products.","inCitations":["5863db49cf8a379d920e14d48e290f5364263daf"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Development of a Self-Adhesive Cellulosic Hydrogel Wound Dressing","doi":"10.4028/www.scientific.net/KEM.801.15","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.4028/www.scientific.net%2FKEM.801.15","venue":""}

We analyzed 51 eyes, which were obtained from an eye bank, from 40 donors with different stages of AMD and compared them with 40 age-matched control eyes. The eyes were processed for light microscopy, and the degree of calcification of Bruch's membrane, fragmentation of Bruch's membrane, the number of different types of drusen, and the presence of basal laminar (linear) deposit were assessed in the macular and extramacular regions. In the macular area, a statistically significant difference was observed for the degree of calcification (P=.02) and fragmentation (P=.03) of Bruch's membrane in eyes with exudative AMD (1.6 and 5 per eye, respectively) compared with eyes with nonexudative AMD (0.8 and 1 per eye, respectively) and control eyes (0.8 and 0 per eye, respectively). Eyes with AMD displayed notably softer, more confluent, and larger drusen and basal laminar (linear) deposit in the macular area compared with control eyes. Calcification and fragmentation of Bruch's membrane, soft, confluent, and large drusen, and basal laminar (linear) deposit but not hard drusen correlate with the histological presence of AMD. The degree of calcification and fragmentation of Bruch's membrane is greater in eyes with exudative compared with nonexudative AMD.","inCitations":["4388b72d081505cb066e8bcd0cf264e31e1305e9","79163aea24f5c5ec1ca9cb9e5cbc97a6ca3920d0","52690f675cea739f621ed15119b67a5a1d3ea1ad","b1e464f46b5e14971e596a4f50f79bac8a626a16","937c8907905c2f118c91aa3f2164bce8ca81f510","08fcdc18f0b138a65c7aa7c99e39a4d71698cd4c","feb5c7aa5777a2f824e81c8c39ebd8096a799bbc","c397c76294f5187608b0845c3e4e0260046dc256","1e0bd0787bdc14880b7ddfb21e46034e6322293d","2741100249258e3d93d1a00c04bf36325adc6326","7609f6b731ccaae389f674193c5eb72bedd9e507","8f7d286cb77c7e7d965dfaea78aba3b7d2ed0d2c","cb3f765a7476dff7c813d1de5e49f16f440fa63f","9304d6066982e8d4f5a059d967a7836af4a261fa","1fcdfc9fcca02bcaae43055079bcb3bef64e2398","c81e2e7b3d46efab6157639b8797c3e132ca6298","4b1c7d8ebf6256960a7bc2186d4bc2e836c98682","3afacd024a12b0edbf6ebb1a8d3d1a07ced4c37c","168689faa7966659c1f0091d0ac88fa1e29212dd","d721acf240cda8b5ca496a1d7cd3fef711357846","f192005c43a6807b95dccaf9a3a0ffffa39ca68c","e0fd9e0c25be15b6923dea864207a3b04dab6c6c","ff1dcc2cc46dcaaa167799ef2da638e6f7c52e62","bbe4f1f34314279c3d8996e3749a97594c526124","944d388154009910623fcee3ba48b35b366843b2","df7e4bd436e8e7541d1fba06764f56939b2a9b02","ad3cf9d3be58bf5cc29ca905c7e656c3180a3fd8","c2d7b7cc926d6eee313bfa607ac30935d1ba714c","73192be17a2181597ff0b8a374d2d28aafd4d1d2","7f22bea4f6eb0c6c64a427403bfe02bbecb1ba04","34031a593c331c1d9bd0d20fb7dfff5c9ad3523a","f2d0b8f9c5694a604858450c350ec17e6eb568a3","ab49d9b7a92efb4879d253102f4f921a6048c51c","b31b929c5bd17092f7c9b1eab29bfcdc08ad89ac","b4494ad3ca9040c646a1561ddd987bfb6fd72ed2","059e86327841c9f32ec41d7b67a089deb6cd5d13","919c22dad83022b28e9873ce40c91b9627323ada","d7740df91a1e572b00a5ace3e9cdd7d6dc8e3d48","7353721f300a4da42024cc710973503ec4388a9d","91359ac15ea1730390fb4cba4f4a0eccbcf9b5e5","9b8a90e4c1c6ec8efd4e7ea742c0eaf7a88146a5","29148ec641f157f18ac80d1981e2b33cb7462191","60f89e8f78356f496ba0450bce5db90d99a33d1d","8fc502f3fea3863c4700e2a487c03d6b9e86fd9c","a1eba8754a0355c16f13515d976665735b0b120d","58492e27e045472a2e02e09f40bc1c018f7a5966","09c5c2e874cd27666eb6aeafdef060131f3ba48b","2432457136a1301760b30bcefd45d8fe0fb36a4f","9f3e848beefb273b13f332afb1f7836506f48b53","43b10d866bfef6804352d62b0e44b0e146f69d77","86c7ce18534b155a26d769486e8350945900b0e8","6120ddd03e8d7770c3933cadee7cd2956f955ca7","54116d7cdfdb3dd1d3f1b697e2d6a08a5869d8e2","ffb433b9d12f92d4f94464bc63fcd7ac0fbf2168","e1a85d1ebce75c9396b6435360d59993bf25759f","ff1b5008beaf39a2119f9cc133ed23990255e636","f88bd8b8b71d9552be0d10bd5fef0ad52aa0b791","9e482ba37350e36667acf543d80cf75eb8f77281","f0f9b81ae690b3d65a4302026ea2d2e2722c5f98","e6d642f3270b6af021e2eee06a89dbc19b5a77c6","2400074381112f4796e3e29b6c5a3386ef4f5015","7ac8eda8ab4d8d7a6ff5c698799acaf11a7b6faf","68adc98a674b9ab860f6a5365f6eacb4aa8082f5","2dd724cfab7bae6892e197370c18063b69f6e250","a89d68f6fcbdd69ee8af5856e857ecd74b93e4dc","8b6173f67ed9512bd8e3d83f812fc7ceec488ef3","b17ba56ebc127fdd924db22579c6b51db8e977b7","5056bc2cb408f2eb9bb470e537d750d420241574","83972e56da0cf0fa2394cb9fae75a839ae5a09fa","bee0ccc2d83be8030805f8e6c50514046f5a416a","8236be78237213c988fa7f78d39a7355e76ad600","6b83bc959c1181fcd611656003f8008db29782ac","e5130a331dca8e77dcd46959e14c5ff5b4fc498d","bd3f382e985acade08d8d602750bc6da69d0877f","4d969f4e40e83aa9da6ce4c9397fa1f537d13ff3","4366c89f1c439241c9d089b0a199956ac8104d57","dec1cd82868710fd02eaa22d16b6df841b3ec87b","d0b3e2ab10a2249a7e91a3f9fb7aadb20279f47a","3cc7f128a829e04f8f870a8891922178c8355a84","9383aec8d4b38734699345b1884036fbe4f21dea","a501865c6757c247e2b7fdf1f759d2cf0fead9e9"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Characteristics of Drusen and Bruch's Membrane in Postmortem Eyes With Age-Related Macular Degeneration","doi":"10.1001/archopht.1997.01100150269022","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1001/archopht.1997.01100150269022","venue":""}

This study sought to assess the support provided by Integrated Child and Youth Development Project to orphans in Mumbuni Location and reveal how orphanhood is conceptualized in the community as well as bring to light the orphans’ specific needs and the community’s response. The study employed a combination of qualitative field -based methods of data collection which included in -depth interviews, observations, focus group discussions and review of existing reports. Collected data confirmed that there was increased number of orphans in the location who were mostly cared for by grandmothers. It revealed that the dynamics associated with HIV and AIDS have led to a shifting definition of an orphan to align with the reality of the pandemic. Orphans in the location face multiple problems and challenges which if not addressed could limit their academic achievement and prospect for employment in adulthood. The study suggests that the community can meet orphans’ needs with minimum external assistance if well mobilized to do so.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://www.ijirr.com/sites/default/files/issues-pdf/0247.pdf"],"title":"ASSESSMENT OF SUPPORT PROVIDED TO ORPHANS IN THE CONTEXT OF HIV and AIDS BY INTEGRATED CHILD AND YOUTH DEVELOPMENT PROJECT IN MUMBUNI LOCATION, MACHAKOS DISTRICT, KENYA","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Echeandia and subg. Mscavea, are recognized based on time of flower opening, tepal shape, flower color, and habitat differences. Fifteen species are proposed. One, E. texensis, is based on four collections made near Brownsville, Texas, and is surely rare, possibly extirpated. The recognition of five species clarifies the distributional range of E. reflexa, a common species of eastern Mexico. Seven species are endemic to Guerrero and adjacent areas of Michoacin, Mexico, Morelos, and/ or Oaxaca. A key to the species of subgenus Mscavea and white-flowered species of subgenus Echeandia is provided. Echeandia, as described by Ortega (1800: 135, tab. 18), included New World species with connate anthers and scaled filaments. These traits effectively separated Echeandia and Old World Anthericum, which had free anthers and smooth or papillate filaments. With few exceptions, New World species with free anthers were included in Anthericum for the next 180 years. However, during that time, species with smooth filaments were included in Echeandia (see Weatherby, 1910), and species with scaled filaments were described in Anthericum (Baker, 1876; Greenman, 1898). Thus, for the past century or more, New World Anthericum and Echeandia were separated simply on the nature of their anthers, and the unique traits they shared were ignored. Because most New World species described in Anthericum and Echeandia share traits that are unique in Anthericaceae, including a corm and scaled filaments, they are now included in Echeandia (see Cruden, 1987, 1994), which, with 78 described species, is the second largest genus in Anthericaceae (see Chase et al., 1996; Dahlgren et al., 1985: 186). Excluded from Echeandia are approximately 20 white-flowered South American species with smooth filaments and free anthers that probably constitute an undescribed genus. Within Echeandia there are two distinct lineages, and each includes species with free anthers and others with connate anthers. The two lineages share at least two synapomorphies. First, all Echeandia have a corm that produces new storage roots and inflorescences yearly. Other Anthericaceae are rhizomatous, and only the terminal segment produces leaves and inflorescences. There is no evidence that a segment produces inflorescences in successiv years. Second, most genera in Anthericaceae s. str. have smooth and/or papillate filaments, e.g., Chlorophytum s.1. (Kativu & Nordal, 1993) and Hagenbachia (Cruden, 1987), whereas most Echeandia (63/78) have scaled filaments and those with smooth filaments occur in derived groups. In addition, anthers adapted for pollination by vibratory bees occur in both lineages and are unique in Anthericaceae s. str. In the white-flowered lineage the anthers in 21 of 25 species are connate and form a cone, and in the other 4 species the individual anthers are adapted for buzz pollination (see below). In the yellow-flowered lineage, 19 of 53 species have anther cones and in 4 additional species the individual anthers are adapted for buzz pollination. The filaments of all these species are inserted dorsally within a basipetally opening pocket, which effectively holds the anther on the same axis as the filament and probably provides the structural stability needed to support a bee while it vibrates an anther or anther cone. It is possible that connate anthers constitute a parallel apomorphy. In other Echeandia and most other Anthericaceae, the anthers are free, usually versatile, dorsifixed, and dehisce laterally. In most Chlorophytum, however, the filaments are inserted more or less basally in a deep pit, which restricts the movement of the anthers. Finally, relative to Echeandia's putative ancestor, both lineages combine a mixture of primitive and derived traits. Based on other Anthericaceae, that ancestor had white flowers, which probably opened relatively early in the morning, broadly elliptical tepals, smooth filaments, and versatile anthers that dehisced laterally. Thus, yellow flowers are apomorphic in one lineage, as are narrowly elliptical inner tepals and late opening flowers in the other. Thus, the available data are consistent with a common ancestor diverging into two lineages, which are formally recognized below as subgenera. NovoN 9: 325-338. 1999.

A myeloperoxidase (MPO) ELISA was also used in parallel. We studied 48 patients with strictly defined vasculitic syndromes in the initial active phase of their disease. The 3 methods confirmed the high (> 90%) sensitivity and specificity of anti-PR-3 for patients with Wegener's granulomatosis (WG). Similarly, a high (86%) sensitivity of MPO-ELISA was found in microscopic polyarteritis as defined. Using alpha-ELISA, we could not improve the detection rate of anti-PR-3 obtained by IF-cANCA-pattern reading. Moreover, a small proportion (< 15%) of biopsy-proven WG patients had anti-MPO antibodies detected by IF, usually as pANCA but also, even if rarely, as bona fide cANCA (< 5%). Thus, IF would seem to be the most reliable screening method and alpha-ELISA should be used for confirmation. On the other hand, because MPO-ELISA detected twice as many anti-MPO positive sera as did pANCA pattern reading by IF, we suggest that in the clinical context of a vasculitis, MPO-ELISA should also be used as a screening test. Although IP is not designed for routine clinical use, it should be required when reporting the presence of anti-PR-3 in vasculitis-like diseases that are fertile grounds for false positive reactions.","inCitations":["48931700c666e67fb2445f3052411afceffbc0ae","4af444f69b87d7759ac377d7bd547c91496827ff"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Detection of anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies by immunoprecipitation.","doi":"","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"Clinical and investigative medicine.

This algorithm first retrieves sea-ice concentration for each scene from the satellite-sensed surface temperature. Then, data from multiple satellite overpasses within one day are combined to a map of the sea-ice concentration. The remaining gaps are finally filled in by a scheme considering the brightness temperatures in the gap areas. The results are compared to operational sea-ice concentration products based on SSM/I (special sensor microwave imager) and good agreement is found when averaging MODIS-based data to the same resolution.","inCitations":["7f1e420587740b60cc11b2146b27cc3ac9ce54b6","514830a7bc72aa32829039a86a213a1e823817b8","e5fe0e8bf71702d1b3088f9b1defd512aaf6901e","32195542bb3dfe86e37ea36eeeacff0b53ea159b","0ccf7283df721cf751264a36d7bd442f8cc0acac","e2aadc2132d60fc1d69c7a6a30ac9eb0f164ddf1","7e22f5ea6cd8f5b40a43ddc5ea99b935e86492dc","3f4fd65925bbaf8ac504cb2a23ab13f3c49b88df","e2b326bffd0e6798db09e3bb9fe4dd6f92ab7928","dd97ded88e0ed262018e893ba323610a96e71bec","6d5680fa0565603fdde5ee218f7903519f2598b3","700df112968991567dd32ee69996a2a108f5467c","aa37194d7c11dfcd18e28c1fbbc852b9b7abc4d7","4259af8c9d8a0636a563720d64f07d88a0488e33","973c23f1e7a79cd9165ada12c078485e4b73aa8a","fadeaf501729e7dd5d73b701b42dc56b895d1ada","f195534066b28a5ed7e8e38d864ff702ec966805","a645c65381a6f3d843f1c2361b88039818bea51b","09b58c60e29ed2660aa61bd1ef08ea3857ea410c","34185253356eb42179c641e46a4ab8bc7e2c55d6","3cf54cd2136b071f3c30883e5dc6e03e489333c9","6fc1112eb1e9d6d5bf99799726c9d65ac9012d59","393e8fadbc4830a203ddb0ba269d2327a7fc3a68"],"pdfUrls":["https://www.cosis.net/abstracts/EGU05/08027/EGU05-J-08027.pdf"],"title":"High‐resolution maps of the sea‐ice concentration from MODIS satellite data","doi":"10.1029/2004GL020808","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1029/2004GL020808","venue":""}

These redox systems were chosen to study the defect site induced by electrochemical desorption and its effect on the charge transfer processes.

A transcript profiling study based on maize unigene-microarrays was conducted to identify genes associated with SCMV resistance in the near-isogenic line (NIL) pair F7 + (SCMV resistant) and F7 (susceptible). Altogether, 497 differentially expressed genes were identified in 4 comparisons addressing constitutive genetic differences, inducible genetic differences, compatible reaction, and incompatible reaction. Compared to a suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH) approach on the same materials, expression patterns of microarray-ESTs and SSH-ESTs were consistent for the same comparisons despite technical discrepancies. Pathogen-induced transcripts were underrepresented on the unigene-microarray, consequently fewer microarray-ESTs (45.8%) were classified into pathogenesis-related categories than SSH-ESTs (60.5%). Moreover, fewer microarray-ESTs (4) co-segregated with Scmv QTL than SSH-ESTs (18). However, our results demonstrate that the microarray experiments complement the SSH-macroarray studies. Good candidate genes (CGs) associated with SCMV resistance can be chosen from three classes: (i) positional CGs co-localized with major Scmv QTL, (ii) functional CGs exhibiting the homology to pathogenesis-related genes, or (iii) differentially expressed ESTs showing consistent expression pattern in both approaches.","inCitations":["527bce2fb5558927755e2c5fa6cd3998ba313b11","45cd8e6bd5a21ace273de2564f517652ac795101","0202f094156e983a23b31bc1d116c9cf41f18c54","8170c59b0af4ce89d6e8f6d10fbf00c2b2563e15","2c4eb6ac05a5e8c3bc2b0f962e95e523713f8e6e","1959f7c7cac216427aadd1b36c4fbf4279b35896","29ecd0ea4f761cc297d00a7ab21dd960b7cb02be","5a28a52d9cdd6097745c52423a556502d7b8599b","2ca2b362f4ed798bfe32f1f375dd4a8f58774d21","ea5a0f5a69063d0b5334d74954f1409f9d1ea31d","39bf73a5f3aebe0e7c6a7bb07e2a637904e873d9","2286f57e65da65211c97a77f14721aaf7be3e74b","1ac85babc290dceba3a6835b8d07533a0cd3f321"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Comparison of transcript profiles between near-isogenic maize lines in association with SCMV resistance based on unigene-microarrays","doi":"10.1016/j.plantsci.2005.08.016","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.plantsci.2005.08.016","venue":""}

Dans tous les cas, l'OPCC etait convaincue que la region des Grands Lacs Africains, comme d'autres regions en conflits de guerre, est en droit d'esperer a la fin de la guerre qui la secoue et au retour a une situation qui permettra une vie paisible. Toutefois, un tel reve ne peut devenir realite que dans la mesure ou l'on se preoccupe, des maintenant, de preparer l'apres-guerre. Les experiences du passe, tirees de plusieurs conflits a travers le monde, indiquent que la preparation a l'apres-guerre est gage d'une paix reelle et surtout durable ; c'est l'ensemencement aujourd'hui pour le futur des germes d'une societe resolument tournee vers la paix et evacuee de toute forme d'ideologie adepte de la resolution non pacifique des conflits ; c'est aussi poser les bases d'une societe aspirant a une vie harmonieuse. Se preoccuper de l'apres-guerre, c'est donc prevoir pour mieux prevenir. Nous citerons ici le secretaire general de l'Organisation des Nations Unies, monsieur Kofi A. Annan qui, dans un rapport publie l'annee derniere, ecrivit : « II est presque universellement reconnu qu'il est preferable de prevenir que de guerir et que les strategies de prevention doivent s'attaquer aux racines des conflits et non seulement aux actes de violence qui en sont les symptomes »(Annan, 2000 : 51)","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"L'après-guerre en Afrique des Grands Lacs : des stratégies pour une paix réelle et durable","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}
