Although considered nutrients on the one hand, nitrogen inputs exceeding the critical load that can be absorbed by an ecosystem act as pollutants. This chapter outlines the effects of N deposition to forest ecosystems and discusses recent progress that has been made to more accurately quantify dry deposition, which at many a forest location in Europe is larger than wet and occult deposition. To quantify the effects of N deposition on tree growth, a good measure for net ecosystem production (NEP) is needed. Eddy covariance (EC) flux measurements are one established way to quantify NEP. While EC flux measurements are costly and remain restricted in their application to a few suitable locations, dendrometer measurements with high temporal resolution show a similar seasonal and annual signal to NEP. Such measurements are becoming increasingly important to quantify ecosystem biomass accumulation, which can be related to N deposition rates. The policy relevance of such activities emerges from the UNECE's Gothenburg protocol to abate acidification, eutrophication and ground-level ozone, but also the quantification of natural sinks under the Kyoto protocol profits from such measurements.","inCitations":["e47320aaec9382d81c46342151eae47766389912","a8af08353c53c32213123d7cb646e4f945d87d88"],"pdfUrls":["http://homepage.usys.ethz.ch/eugsterw/publications/pdf/Eugster-Haeni-COST-Book-FINAL.pdf"],"title":"Chapter 3 – Nutrients or Pollutants?

One may sug- gest adding a few more prerequisites such as (v) absorption in water and proteins, (vi) a spot size smaller then the thickness of the zona pellucida (ZP), and (vii) precision of the entire unit. !n a previous study (12) we have discussed the influence of various physical parameters on the ex- pected effects during gamete manipulations (i.e., cutting geometry, ablation beam size, pulse repe- tition rate and duration, and laser fluence, i.e., en- ergy per unit area). It is the intent of this column to discuss some aspects related to the above- mentioned prerequisites in order to take full advan- tage of the laser as light scalpels. Lasers, (an acronym for Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation) are electromag- netic waves with unique properties. The beam is collimated, monochromatic, and coherent. Prog- ress in physics and laser technology in recent years has resulted in the introduction of many lasers for biomedical studies. Although lasers differ from each other by the wavelengths, which are in the visible range (red, green, or blue), ultraviolet (UV), or in the infrared (IR) range (Fig. l a), effects may also vary as a result of different application modes as will be discussed later. INTRODUCTION A brief literature search on the key words micro- manipulation (MM) and male factor infertility may highlight the controversy regarding this issue. It has recently been suggested (1) that so inconsistent are the reported results that at present it is pertinent to ask does microsurgical assisted fertilization (MAF) work at all ? The controversies are related mainly to patient selection needed for establishing prognostic criteria and the method of choice (2,3). Gamete manipulations require special equipment and expertise, while the preparation of disposable microneedles for MAF is time-consuming and, thus, expensive (4). In an attempt to increase accuracy and simplic- ity, it has been suggested that the laser might offer several advantages. Since its first introduction for gamete manipulation in 1989 (5) several studies addressed basic questions on its potential role and discussed various methods (6-10). It is beyond the scope of this article to assess the important issues of effectiveness and safety of the laser for gamete manipulations. Several studies and clinical obser- vations are being performed throughout the world and it will take some time until the controversies regarding the future role of MAF will be answered. However, in view of the increasing interest in lasers for gamete MM, some guidelines are needed. Strohmer and Feichtinger have recently presented in abstract form some biophysical criteria for laser MM (11).

The aim of this work was to study the sunflower storage protein transport pathway and identified component of the sorting machinery. Immature sunflower seeds were analyzed by subcellular fractionation (using percoll and sucrose gradients) and electron microscopy. The vesicles isolated with percoll, have precursors of 11S globulins, α-TIP, δ-TIP, BiP, and two proteins that have homology to the pumpkin vacuolar sorting receptor PV72. Sucrose isolated vesicles have the same composition than percoll ones, except for the lack of BiP and the presence of only one protein that has reactivity with pea VSR BP80. Electronic micrographies of developing seeds show that the formation of electron dense aggregates starts in the endoplasmic reticulum, and that these aggregates are very abundant in the trans-Golgi apparatus, where release of dense vesicles happens. These vesicles contain a homolog of PV72 in their membranes. Storage proteins are also detected in multivesicular bodies whose membranes have reactivity with PV72 serum. All these results indicated that sunflower storage proteins are transported to protein storage vacuoles by a Golgi dependent pathway in a process in which homologous of PV72 are involved.","inCitations":["742586f5a2d545495a50694d291cb45d95f928ae","85bd24801212685f823b7f77676010fd6a5e917e"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.ejbiotechnology.info/index.php/ejbiotechnology/article/viewFile/v9n3-21/315","http://www.ejbiotechnology.cl/content/vol9/issue3/full/21/21.pdf"],"title":"Sunflower storage proteins are transported in dense vesicles that contain proteins homologous to the pumpkin vacuolar sorting receptor PV 72","doi":"10.4067/S0717-34582006000300029","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.4067/S0717-34582006000300029","venue":""}

Based on the internal model principle, the proposed control scheme plugs a reference signal generator into the stable conventional feedback closed-loop system to accomplish zero error tracking of the dc or ac reference input. The design of the unified zero error tracking controller is systematically developed and the stability analysis of overall control system is discussed. Three examples of the proposed controlled CVCF converters, such as CVCF PWM inverter, boost-type PWM rectifier, and dc-dc PWM buck converter are studied to testify the validity of the proposed approach. Simulation and experimental results demonstrate satisfactory performance of the proposed unified robust zero error tracking controller even under parameter uncertainties and load disturbances.","inCitations":["797951ee77e3f1087458eb4a1eece30841c6d4f3","4ee485841da2471370d5c8a82f68faecb654c8c0","93b299b8859aafb8accf6cee3f80d9793fd032ac","09fdbb208bc009dd26e7202133a900efb1dbd63e","b1e4a99169cbb62b32ca218acf931da42243b970","4777c9a2f1e552d450ed37430cfa7cb2c17547e5","33ef5b6b837a18643ff153a48fb850ab4bc6f538","f035d9c8fd737514b7b85892a7a9dba2c6a6a94c","b4714c6badf8323f002a0691ed639739f32d605f","29bf7f34d8c04915cfcceeae8af06398eef44db2","a4083f45b6a9a3ff1efac7e287c8fb1420b7d07f","48d0e66a77a0c5c65784279e91ec6a9724442b14","cacde007f86daa103396610e75c4efa4c0c6d3e4","419d0dfec240b4868796cba15f950f1590c0549f","380a2d6d7fb7a8419e09ae1a32f7fe3f1f0703b2","8a117f92777d6d92225618fb6479b3f53f650872","2f94bb94431d91431544aa0022b2b92bf874aefa","310ac1b26701a0fa85bc581ef89377a3f6c80b49","186ad51340a606eea2e669ed125129252b542180","d4821beabeab29b4975a9bab985448e3596667e0","ccb563384705d7ed8aaea58d6a294c43f96d27ac","e5e93b1a04288117f3a8f6b83c2a7d9d171e349b","6e291b3809a150371b9e8ae8400d189e81fdaa77","68eadea09eba786ffa77512851602afe922dbbc4","2c9c8f4e2977fcb98a99f34aa2e7560b99ca3c29","1cf627ffc81c20677bca060dd8fa1fb7af907b44"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.ntu.edu.sg/home/edwwang/jnlpapers/00995664.pdf","https://www.ntu.edu.sg/home/edwwang/jnlpapers/00995664.pdf"],"title":"Unified robust zero-error tracking control of CVCF PWM converters","doi":"10.1109/81.995664","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/81.995664","venue":""}

This order also exists among coexisting sulfides in natural deposits. The isotopic composition of pyrite at hydrothermal temperatures is estimated to be very close to that of gaseous hydrogen sulfide. The isotopic property of aqueous sulfide ions is determined by the relative concentrations of the three species H2S, HS-, and S2-, all of which have different reduced partition function ratios. Therefore, the pH of hydrothermal solution is as important a parameter as the temperature in determining the isotopic ratio of a sulfide mineral. δS* of pyrite, for instance, in isotopic equilibrium with a solution at 500°K having a δS of 0.0‰, would be +5.0‰ at pH 9.5, +2.0‰ at pH 8.0, and 0.0‰ at pH 4.0. Some natural examples are discussed which may indicate a change with time in the pH as well as in the isotopic raito of hydrothermal solutions during mineralization. The isotopic exchange reaction between sulfide and sulfate is also discussed.","inCitations":["64024a0405e96ba0f067609b7ac94c83a555531d","d38876dbaf876dad98aaf9c29c7bfb901bdf4d91","89d965c7acd4fc43c9476ec36337534812feaef4","07539862ac37cebca0ce08a6328554b43ea2c2f7","0b822805721c33a8dd6ef76dc0f3f6578bb55e0a","ac6e88052591759399b77e3279b2f58e231bdf82","3afdd968ffed4153077f5716671f77aa4b7520c6","64a72c03b860f21b39905c29769eb180214df826","1ccc8fde12f466703c5607771f0e13ec13d07bf6","824c0663aec617170049c811ed8c51b67616bcfe","5b4068f6bcf841de86cadd053f4eb075bbd210e8","7411f55e616b711dfcaaa776314148ec4456b126","340f0ae30db8395d99babe745d20607a5ad3eee1","a81ad3b82b2c38b8569fbe5aa30a091bf0006de8","df6da50826328e378ae8cd3906b7cd052ff287c1","11aa7c7017b5f9a2f69393b438e46373c2bf9b40","b7b8e540de69329cbb974829707c9637fb2cc212","0202a0f8fe3e1fb5183d7ea516bff902f6022f6a","9a2438fd4011431f84f1d63038e50f15d8ca1d46","65d3ee4f4548b609cbbde7e578a16a0b26d33cb3","bf6ef68fc44e5641fff15cf08b628ae933e22458","7a54149bafacd091e1cdef5c9cadcb66e0acd0d8","d14079745d905805fdbd1122e43e6771ca0b2aea","1edc6ce6d16ff64e2c562b6fc8575c8842d1f830","8f012ffadb34df56ea3c546a995aae0130005844","830bc16e4ed05bbeb9ce4bfcbeef5058ae402a49","ab9b8d00b7eacfb7e17a118fec2e463a4daa6497","5cf1fa28122ec2c514a8c832599b733c22f18a2d","64653eccb2d2b67c7462ad4b77791d6d393a0116","2f5c81d71a526de0d15b6ced758a51521a8c70c3","2cf8d864ba0866f25fba0d4ec6e38f1747db9b6f","6494a6bb9bc4197774a82c7aae3d9ca45d76f2ac","5605b504a998430e79bbf8a46ff3e697d7bb2dd7","f5514b607abc2fc3d2d0a6e0036ecad14f5793a0","e35268391029c214bed6ebbd51dee2f12e716fbd","aa00afdbbc35de42e37ccd5a6cb77cc7459f6b0d","c59a3dc42b965903e0c029ed8bc51d55115eddbd","cfff29850a534cc493ef3c9e3916537266be0fb5","d27b9573f646b2e6081a1fa74267d50e7f2a247b","78f2e58ecfff96f3edba705bdcd2766cd907cd3e","54d87712ab914976eab0d934669149b98b2a14c4","8b43010a612c1ab2c99d15a14a16e00be6f6ec3e","de47cc881df05629002559cfefe34c20133d1816","b869d269bcf6cc45efc8c49f18a3086242d370d0","7e43991d7c283ecc62fe6e286580231d47e6c094","4c3573cabdad116a60e7dff1503efa73ef92ea29"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Isotopic properties of sulfur compounds in hydrothermal processes","doi":"10.2343/geochemj.2.29","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.2343/geochemj.2.29","venue":""}

Difference spectra between the parent states P566 and P507 were obtained in 1H2O and 2H2O for the first time. The spectra are generally characterised by large changes in the range between 1710 and 1590 cm(-1) and by a strong difference band around 1270 cm(-1). In order to study the influence on the PVB chromophore upon aggregation, spectra of the alpha-subunit and the (alphabeta)3 trimer are compared, showing distinct differences which may be of relevance for the chromophore-protein and protein-protein interactions. The difference spectra demonstrate many similarities to the spectra recently obtained for the Pr --> meta-Rc transition of phytochrome [Foerstendorf et al. (1996) Biochemistry 35, 10793-10799]. In particular, a band around 1710 cm(-1), which was tentatively assigned to the C = O stretch of ring D is also observed in the spectra of PEC. It strongly supports this identification and the deduced molecular interpretation on the protonation state of the chromophore.","inCitations":["1272fb1e81f6459faf3bd42615f059675caee900","38dac0053d20c380eb849000a87bb46614e5be7d"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Z,E isomerization of the alpha-84 phycoviolobilin chromophore of phycoerythrocyanin from Mastigocladus laminosus investigated by Fourier-transform infrared difference spectroscopy.","doi":"10.1016/S0014-5793(96)01521-9","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/S0014-5793%2896%2901521-9","venue":"FEBS letters"}

Cerebrospinal fluid protein concentrations decreased and IQ scores and overall levels of functioning improved gradually over 1 year. Regional cerebral blood flow (CBF) changes were analyzed longitudinally for 1 year using single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). Autoradiography method and region of interest (ROI) analyses were used for quantitative CBF assessment and 3D stereotactic surface projections (3D-SSP) analyses were used for qualitative CBF pattern assessment. 3D-SSP could not reveal remarkable CBF pattern changes through the courses. The ROI analyses showed remarkable CBF decreases in all brain regions 1 month after the treatment, which recovered to normal levels 1 year after the treatment. These results suggest that remarkable decreases of quantitative CBF counts reflect the disappearance of encephalitis, while their gradual recovery reflects the gradual improvement of cerebral functional activity. As Treponema pallidum infection affects whole brain and CBF changes globally, quantitative CBF assessment may be more efficient than qualitative CBF pattern analyses for the purpose of understanding the pathophysiology of general paresis.","inCitations":["7834d77b5d26f1ce335b8cd19196269e62f32e8b","66ed344fda690d74dfb108fd790e1784cf186494"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Cerebral blood flow changes in general paresis following penicillin treatment: a longitudinal single photon emission computed tomography study.","doi":"10.1046/j.1440-1819.2002.00930.x","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1440-1819.2002.00930.x","venue":"Psychiatry and clinical neurosciences"}

In the framework of these robust mandates, peacekeepers’ main responsibilities are to protect civilians and support the local central government in regaining full control over its territory. These robust mandates raise some issues regarding their compatibility with the principles at the basis of peacekeeping operations and their likely impact on jus post bellum. Furthermore, these mandates’ contribution to the achievement of a just peace is questionable. After briefly outlining the evolution of peacekeeping, this chapter explores the compatibility of robust mandates with jus post bellum principles and the pros and cons of robust mandates to reach a just and stable post-conflict arrangement, using the missions currently operating in the Democratic Republic of Congo, in Mali, and in South Sudan as case studies.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Robust Peacekeeping Mandates and Jus Post Bellum","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Given the different medical backgrounds and presentation skills there is often a limit to the verbal description of the radiographs. The aim of this study is to determine the feasibility and benefits of concurrently using picture messaging of X-rays to enhance communication between ED and Orthopaedic Registrars to optimise patient care. The X-rays of 40 patients referred to orthopaedics OPD or admitted from the ED were photographed and retrospectively reviewed on a mobile phone screen (240 × 320) by an orthopaedic registrar along with a printout of the patient history and verbal description of the x-ray as interpreted by the ED staff. No further information was provided to the registrar. A questionnaire was completed to subjectively and objectively evaluate the therapeutic benefit of the image review. Patient(tm)s management was compared to management plans after image review and differences were attributed to the visual inspection of the x-rays on the mobile phone. Concurrent to the retrospective review, the ED is currently trialling this with a Sony-Erickson K750i. After hours orthopaedic cases are sent via MMS to the registrar prior to consultation. In the emergency department, 10% of patients who presented with a fracture were reviewed in person by an orthopaedics registrar and none were admitted straight from ED whilst two were admitted following review at the OPD. X-rays of 40 patients were reviewed in this study. Twenty-seven patients presented with a fracture and four with islocations. When the clinical data was reviewed alongside images of x-rays by an orthopaedic registrar, a difference in management plans were observed in 25% of cases and 7.5% where surgical intervention would yield a better result. Twenty-six of the twenty-seven fractures and four dislocations were successfully visualised on the MMS. In 18 cases, picture messaging provided additional information compared to verbal report alone. The limiting factor in picture messaging was the resolution and size of the radiograph. Ease of operation and portability was found to be satisfactory by both ED and Orthopaedic staff. Equipping the ED with the phone has enhanced communication with the orthopaedics department and increased the potential for optimising patient care. This will be formally assessed through questionnaires after 12 months trial of the phone. Picture messaging is an inexpensive way of utilising technical advancements to improve patient care. Consistent with current literature, the quality of images was not sufficient as a diagnostic tool but rather a screening tool. Picture messaging is valuable practically and educationally and enhances the consultation and teaching process whilst encompassing medical staff who have limited skills in radiological description.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Use of Photo Imaging with Mobile Phones to Transfer X-ray Images between Ed Staff and Orthopaedic Registrars","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

The equation is first order in the propagation coordinate and is valid for arbitrarily short pulse durations. Solutions of the first-order wave equation are found to be in excellent agreement with solutions of the scalar wave equation. Furthermore, the polarization response of a field-ionizing medium is derived from semiclassical considerations. The polarization reveals, in agreement with experiments, a previously unrecognized contribution that is shown to significantly affect the absorption loss in the presence of ionization.","inCitations":["2c2bf68378e7ad615ed92c5349c8b0988250c310","577186385f25e6b461cef8cb6a7b14dc954f7885","a890221497ff7872380481b21fd9968e042b8482","16a60a30ea7785e825916620b6617f49e5080457","d64bdcd1f40e0ed24563c50cf5212bdd8247dbdc","cedfeb5394d3555dd4a0a6f34555831bb2a95f93","fc3a80e62b2613fc0e9d78955572f449584a1783","2a09303e8f550e34cb1368aebf3f30f2057e746f","adaf830000c3c4b945f0f7d17318dcac9d1b7731","7049d52bfabc6d81633907e8e84f3098a9abeadd","9c9c7f260ec5bfe08873e4cde0f4fd43a104e881","01bed978ab2adf775ecfc9f2eb3072ec707faedc","3e2706a27de3564c571c0199af6343870aa7dcc4","13cd0efa226b6b3f8160715566cf7ad63a87309c","5458dccc426bbea83ceefaa51ee82ab2092173ac","d599ac2ccc106e8c65a5b75936676ad26403a871","609fce621a08ff45310fd56ea370ab9734072802","9eb1b7f2eb970eda24f3aa044df0caf12dd3567e","8381aeb9421d4bf051e991feafa792d0bbf17242","ee96f725ea70feec60c1dfcf972fb090012bf698","f550338d08bab087b2f966278c5a6a35e1fcb241","167c3f458abdd3db24421f1ccd20ec21c84536b9","181bc35fef92074d3ff9f8404af286955c5320b0","8a9fc9888976d0423ebc649d98317fa95c1b11c1","abf3356bb24daedab8c6c2508b20091280405e8e","8c1c48b7972ae557d06a2fdc47b60d5b0ec06be5","558336618eb1ff19d287c3dd82b33f950d7f585e","7ce33897908cfdbe1d099386444a1b822e44e614","c58be814b1c3f1c7aa6d00590f8abf649a0e2eb6","b7cb60671782ff2adcc4d7ebc5e0a3942bb05eef","053229af9821d43c8f2933f85cd74013986b6814","56aa6068461d678fee49a169fef07dfa408a6376","b6f93283f210b8817dce2bf3899e852a222c3a99","9acca7039acd9371e056947a10f566b6d0af0a14","d3a4c33a596cf4cb6726dc54e29429b920c9a3be","c017be094c11f9eb3e9a31eee33309f25fc07614","aadc472675d393d9fbed1b6de2f7fc2b6a9c5f97","b38e4433dafa2f203e82d6e959293f4d9b866777","9626c70fb53b6fb402be2e2b5910331ba189bc09","82933777b783754a6bafa9416fd07408cffb7b65","e254ccac3795016b6efe1561a2c47609b840782c","c01ee665202a5ff9ea79e3d15b1d6c214809bcb6","635e36073300692fbb4b8f53e89f2fd7e5b6a48f","ecae499cd6fedb271b5b90aacf8d952457cdcd97","529f7a5b741f288f871498e2048968aa4fa5c9fc","6877b8c48f337e5961a3b874b8fad241ea47d114","0d51a46295c5014f1df196d2a7034b3e339ee371","1a43ada841b342782c15e882e9c06eeb60660a5a","a576e4d29dae2de084563d8833b1ac63dbc20454","c3b5a984183cd9026af197f1135edc81fff71538","21e081235e54731ea9812707da5797bdd813c7ba","439c980bb7e619bd51520d65bc53538edb6f814e","119eb5095f3c31b64715b74f5dc3945cc2511087"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Light Propagation in Field-ionizing Media : Extreme Nonlinear Optics","doi":"10.1103/PhysRevLett.83.2930","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.83.2930","venue":""}

Aims: To study psychosocial risk factors and clinical profile associated with attempted suicide in young adult and adolescent patients in conflict zone-Kashmir. Material and Method: It was a hospital-based study in which 200 young adults and adolescent patients who were admitted following unsuccessful suicide attempts to the emergency and referred to Department of Psychiatry, Govt. Medical College, Srinagar, Jammu and Kashmir, India. Selected patients were subjected to Mini International Neuropsychiatric interview (MINI) and International Personality Disorder Examination (IPDE) for evaluation of symptoms and diagnosis. Subjects of age less than 15 years and more than 34 years have been excluded. Results: Majority of the suicide attempters 65% were < 24 years of age with adolescent over represented in the sample (Mean = 21.24 ± 4.66), females were 58%, low socioeconomic status (86%), oral agents (most common method) was used by 84%, 64% had expressed suicidal or death wishes before act and 72% made an impulsive attempt. Eighty-two percent of the suicide attempters were suffering from some psychiatric illness at that time. Out of which 40% had mood disorder with predominance of major depressive disorder, 15% had personality disorders, and 9% had posttraumatic stress disorder. Conclusion: Knowledge of clinical phenomenology may assist in identification and early intervention of youth who are at high risk.

Firstly, we identify the boundary representations of the tensor algebra inside the Toeplitz algebra, also known as its non-commutative Choquet boundary. As an application, we provide examples of C*-envelopes that are not *-isomorphic to either the Toeplitz algebra or the Cuntz–Pimsner algebra. This characterization required a new proof for the fact that the Cuntz–Pimsner algebra associated to P is isomorphic to $$C({\\mathbb {T}}, M_d({\\mathbb {C}}))$$C(T,Md(C)), filling a gap in a previous paper. We then proceed to classify the C*-envelopes of tensor algebras of stochastic matrices up to *-isomorphism and stable isomorphism, in terms of the underlying matrices. This is accomplished by determining the K-theory of these C*-algebras and by combining this information with results due to Paschke and Salinas in extension theory. This classification is applied to provide a clearer picture of the various C*-envelopes that can land between the Toeplitz and the Cuntz–Pimsner algebras.","inCitations":["37ca8f0441c2fc979194c0d415f65417e5ad30b0","1bfb8d994b9ce55e1382588c8b8cccecb4226b9a","86eb759e22d6c4d2092a667700e9428ee49c2e07","4ddfef5bd3d7ffea94f73ac3f3cdb2daec34f1f0"],"pdfUrls":["https://arxiv.org/pdf/1605.03543v2.pdf"],"title":"C*-Envelopes of Tensor Algebras Arising from Stochastic Matrices","doi":"10.1007/s00020-017-2382-x","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00020-017-2382-x","venue":""}

Focusing on a sample of firms rated by Standard & Poor's (S&P), we show that the profitability of dispersion-based trading strategies concentrates in a small number of the worst-rated firms and is significant only during periods of deteriorating credit conditions. In such periods, the negative dispersion-return relation emerges as low-rated firms experience substantial price drop along with considerable increase in forecast dispersion. Moreover, even for this small universe of worst-rated firms, the dispersion-return relation is non-existent when either the dispersion measure or return is adjusted by credit risk. The results are robust to previously proposed explanations for the dispersion effect such as short-sale constraints and leverage.","inCitations":["6320f46a0124a1fb08edf03cfea0374a9acfdb8b","40bc551a7f0b0ed816faff64bec3af8d9e2d93a3","20f2d08f500af525a7c093d71c4852cb9a7b1232","3298a59ccbb90e617700f3a4e10d453a48db0225","fbb534b4da151e41a8691486623b16e1c0273f06","ebcf2c66537477eab67abbe44c9eb733702145cd","3cc3c0dbf6e6d1c8ac20112ea53e4f913725eed7","1596faec44c6fe5d23347d31bbc1d45f30cf94aa","b694509c0b4fbf19158ef9fe18f0327d09ae3fb3","3fca9b5d39dabd690e37947d42f574c83b3af081","cd94eb1bcf955f20fc472dc7283860027691894d","7c0582e669cf39fa0a11edf687acb4d984370a9c","5b89350f49a943ef1f025167a6bcdc3304c2b60d","861c1753c5a678fb0c2902b66ea0250ad76df3eb","f414766cf7e1f8f7a5420892d8a71458c4510613","e7aa908e59ce98a1c2edba8ab4ea58fd39444322","886964424d4084448c8f1632f91975d6ed65b18d","130014200904d54837a705ee6d3bb24e85bb8553","d61b2738b48cd856800fa265d02b92667291c49a","a2d3b21fe6b8cc8114a2ff24be06e595748ff339","f69c654e1433f974e1847cda0e122deff50a422d","8272550a35381be587d03dcf32eb133d1accf443","cf3bbdce7f7b39152e006c73782a8861231f81be","b5f915017ef77f52bec91b6a868905bff27fd3ee","d71e0eac4898acedcccbf0abc33cdb11ab95d809","d8d9bf5c8188ccd4aa7f430a75b8a2f1798fb42c","c3c51f60cef43f68a48abde9eb91860818063a2f","7aa04fdedfd80be156168171f8524546a81e2162","f246ba9f48cd53d3a7f5b298060e5f722ae3dcb2","138d098e9b42496e535786009b86d422a6086c7f","9fdc37137016dc712dc2900df93c84b3b705e88f","080179d80cab2139b9b13bd52c269ce95966da72","d2d0225ea2fe3818f47f25288128879991a28ba5","c1db9e2ba0da7d82b1a0f7ec4dc896c4872f7e15","362fe1286e0104cf4ef55976f7dc592e083c07b7","aef1c44165855d38b4e4f9f9a20f5e530d171bdc","86cf0230233ae17e60702997f91b1a431f9e873d","16b78247da35019845ab1b5ed45d6459270f5beb"],"pdfUrls":["http://pluto.huji.ac.il/~davramov/dispersion_JFE.pdf","http://web-docs.stern.nyu.edu/salomon/docs/conferences/Jostova_CFEA.pdf","http://web-docs.stern.nyu.edu/salomon/docs/conferences/avramov%20et%20al.pdf","http://69.175.2.130/~finman/Prague/Papers/dispersion_acjp_FMAE.pdf"],"title":"Dispersion in Analysts' Earnings Forecasts and Credit Rating","doi":"10.1016/j.jfineco.2008.02.005","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jfineco.2008.02.005","venue":""}

The formation of arrays of particles on Si substrates covered by Si 3 N 4 layer was studied by high-resolution scanning electron microscopy and particle arrays on carbon coated copper grids by transmission electron microscopy. The crystalline structure of Co particles and its temperature evolution were analyzed by X-ray diffraction in situ in He gas and ex situ in UHV up to 700 °C. Two-dimensional (2-D) arrays of particles were formed by different types of preparation. The most regular ordering was obtained with the application of magnetic field perpendicular to the substrate surface, where 2-D hexagonal ordered arrays with length and width both between 200 and 500 nm were observed. In external magnetic field also three-dimensional arrays of nanoparticles–columns were formed. In the as-deposited state the nanoparticles show a poorly developed fcc crystalline structure. Most significant structural changes appear in the temperature range 400–450 °C where a well-developed fcc Co phase forms.","inCitations":["fc6fbd7a70c337a5c64f36a998721027f14240b7"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Structure and self-assembling of Co nanoparticles","doi":"10.1016/j.msec.2005.12.001","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.msec.2005.12.001","venue":""}

In affirming, the Seventh Circuit declined to judge the law by the strict standard set for poll taxes in Harper v. Virginia Bd. of Elections, 383 U.

Groups of male or female mice received 0, 0.1 and 0.4% phloxine in the diet starting at 6 wk of age for a maximum of 90 wk. Survivals of mice were more than 85% at 64 wk after the start of phloxine administration. Their body weights reached maximum at 48 wk and both male and female mice given 0.1 and 0.4% phloxine weighed significantly more than their respective controls. Tumours developed in 13 organs, the greatest incidence in males being of liver tumours (67.3%), followed by lung tumours (10.9%), lymphomas (9.7%), altered foci of liver (8.4%) and hepatic haemangioma (7.8%). In females, hepatic tumours (11.5%) had the greatest incidence followed by lymphomas (10.8%), pulmonary tumours (8.2%) and hepatic haemangioma (3.2%). In males, the incidence of altered foci and haemangioma in the liver was 19 and 14%, respectively, in the control groups, whereas only 2% occurred in the group given 0.4% phloxine (P < 0.05). It is concluded that average body weights increased significantly in female mice of groups given 0.1 or 0.4% phloxine, compared with body weights of the female controls, and that altered liver foci were significantly reduced in male mice given 0.4% phloxine.

The results replicate earlier findings to the effect that bias indexes correlate within memory type (implicit and explicit memory, respectively) but not within word category across memory type, suggesting that explicit and implicit memory bias represent two separate forms of emotional processing. Neither explicit nor implicit memory bias, however, was found to be associated with trait anxiety, or with repressive coping style—although an earlier finding of a negative association between anger/irritability and implicit memory bias was partly replicated. On the other hand, repressive coping style was found to be more associated with explicit than implicit memory performance in general (i.e. independently of the valence of words), which suggests the hypothesis that repressors, as compared with high and low trait-anxious individuals, have a general tendency to process information more at an explicit than an implicit level.","inCitations":["7eb8b4b677de4b583060b15836a3d03c34d29d7b","034821053bd16d8c8ef2400e88777b45648e9485","dd0a55c57029064e250ec2f5bb0470897e1d0c47","2520352a121885c5fecbc9ec9cafb18e5daabbab","bb6b3b6cb46fe9972e8a807cd53198eade2201b8","b57b5d7638a69a55b86edf0c019fab254918ec8b","43e46d803fa84073830988ff5fb94791ac739378","a2b35d14e8277387a360f7fa900f842e064fb844","390bd64908d3bae4a042277c89c01cc4b4642137","838a167db36c71d35a3786e17a5b7e788732dacd"],"pdfUrls":["http://isiarticles.com/bundles/Article/pre/pdf/32364.pdf"],"title":"Explicit and implicit memory, trait anxiety, and repressive coping style","doi":"10.1016/S0191-8869(01)00009-5","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/S0191-8869%2801%2900009-5","venue":""}

Methods: Structural equation modeling was employed to test a home- and community-based services model based on Andersen’s Health Behavioral Model. Data from 5,294 elders in a nationally representative dataset, the Second Longitudinal Study of Aging, were included for analysis. Results: Two significant supportive factors for older adults to remain in communities were use of paid instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) personal care services and awareness of unmet needs. Discussion: Our findings suggest the importance of encouraging older adults to acknowledge their unmet needs and to seek community-based support services early, rather than wait until they have developed more serious needs, such as difficulties in activities of daily living (ADL).","inCitations":["ebb1b2b712c3ebfedee7ccf90c0624327d5d4a6c","d82c54822ef85b2aea71a95110442cb1dbef3fbe","046aa9dabc5e2a0bcb3f9a35214850ae4b6bac1b","05ae681bfabda3537131a8cd1668370367ffe946","00bf0985b9e34622e2738aed9f449ed13f38c63d","d0259bafccde79cd1691f288287bc4ef6658566b","f0d87ed962a12135b63d8b2b8fd896bb80ef4818","1cf8b3fe22121266f9919c9f2f25d19607f32c70","bbb2d30aeac94d7dccafd42c4c7db75aff1d6647","fe37f19ea060428ad2d25f05342b6a7e75d98141","b1f15753b7bb0264a3286b024e82e2412c58290f","78b3377edf62d4b442de4cc36dae96717b50bc1c","5611fb382b8da9f0c588b3fa5b5d6f5f8f7ac432","b5422bff58041772ea9cfc489e35b592d74c27c1","fcfc51174e1027e12682e6843c1a9e5b61aea751","5fa3f9b06f7dd8bb54ac2bd4ea89b478eb646c2c","45fab8557cb0ac1861c3ab4d25f627423766f7e5","d3a84595a4df5c2a9eaee8b7d5d8b280a20b1892","37b18db839e6328c94dab2b95771aa77974e8f78","5fb6194d5802d5779c9df57ef50643cd27471b15","3da3d87c86180a203fb8d047cfbd0d0ba7fc38b8","28059d0571554cb38a4fb9fa2d48b9f5f30a65af","85b0bb35f67e921f8277198719432f2a875e00ff","5cea159c0791bee809f80251cbd3a32aa29d3176","6bf8a608857f90ef458894b1487ef1474578b8fa","cdda193c6f79a07a7e59b27eff48bbf7119c106b","214ef1785cbce0ba68a4ff62d7ff1d120a8dd047","e13a9c69d81f9b3a01abcdc543123388a3caa59a","1e6f67d2eb4c0a96a909c38bcd22ba15e2177e50","6cf28c78ac1f58affc0f2247484638a76dd0e2bb","2b4a12b39169aaba500d28df6646ff3809eb92a3","0f10108332d1a815a28aaa7e806abb38828d75c0","f82eb88050f10043631f60e4487913b27c68e898"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Understanding Factors That Influence Success of Home- and Community-Based Services in Keeping Older Adults in Community Settings","doi":"10.1177/0898264309356593","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1177/0898264309356593","venue":"Journal of aging and health"}

The results indicate that the frequency of record-breaking high temperature in the first decade of the 21st century is the highest in the three decades from the 1980s to the 2000s, implying a distinct warming trend. Meanwhile, frequencies of record-breaking low temperature in the 1990s and the beginning of the 21st century are also significant. In particular, the RBEs of low temperature occurred over most of China in the 1990s but concentrated in northern China during the 2000s. To understand why the record low temperatures in northern China are repeatedly broken in the 2000s, the related East Asian Winter Monsoon (EAWM) variability is investigated. The empirical orthogonal function analysis of surface air temperature reveals that the northern mode of the EAWM variability, which is highly associated with the Arctic Oscillation (AO) activities at both interdecadal and interannual timescales, has been intensifying since late 1990s. Corresponding to the intensification of the northern mode of the EAWM variability and the negative phase of AO in the 2000s, the Siberian High and East Asian trough intensify while the polar-front jet stream strengthens and the subtropical westerly jet stream abnormally shifts northward. As a result, anomalously strong cold air masses, originated from Siberia, intrude into East Asia but are blocked by the enhanced northward subtropical westerly jet and cannot reach low-latitude area. Therefore, the extremely strong cold air masses are amassed in mid-high latitudes of East Asia, resulting in RBEs of low temperature in this area.","inCitations":["7f5414fe920c5590ae51cadfd5ddceccd6aa48b7","7ca8622ceb9095987cf189fe7ce89a710bda0fb6"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Changes in the frequencies of record‐breaking temperature events in China and its association with East Asian Winter Monsoon variability","doi":"10.1002/2013JD020965","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1002/2013JD020965","venue":""}

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of SP on stress hormone levels, pain, physiological parameters and length of stay in NBs. Methods NBs were randomly allocated into two groups: intervention (3 days SP sessions, n=13) and control (3 days sham sessions, n=12). Results In the SP group, respiratory frequency (RF) was found significantly lower (p<0.05), and reduction of heart rate and length of stay were observed, without statistical differences. While in the control, there was higher tendency of cortisol levels (p=0.05).

This study is organized around the delay-free transformation and the successive approximation method. First by proposing a discrete variable transformation, the discrete-time system with input and control delays and the quadratic performance index are transformed into equivalent delay-free ones. According to the optimal control theory, the tracking control problem is transformed into a two-point boundary value problem. Then by using the successive approximation design method we solve the two-point boundary value problem and the optimal tracking control (OTC) law is obtained from Riccati and Stein equations. The existent and uniqueness of the optimal control law is proved. Finally, the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approaches are validated by numerical examples.","inCitations":["4bf4fb32bd09ae6be2169c80f13807d69569b374","27317f72ca7a4e5dd4bd1a16a556f80dd713350e"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Optimal output tracking control for discrete-time systems with state and control delays","doi":"10.1109/CCDC.2017.7979457","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCDC.2017.7979457","venue":"2017 29th Chinese Control And Decision Conference (CCDC)"}

It seeks to understand how characteristics of family farms shift as a function of property size, arguing that as production intensifies, properties move closer to a HOT state. In this state, resources are committed to maintaining robustness against expected disturbances, such as shifts in yields or crop prices, making property more vulnerable to other unexpected disturbances, such as shifts in input prices or availability. The shifts in production, labor, and costs that occur across scale in the Ji-Parana River Basin in Rondonia were measured using a survey instrument on a sample of farmers in the basin. Study results show decreasing production intensity with increasing property size in the sample, coupled with decreasing contracted and family labor use intensity, as well as decreased income diversification and off-farm labor. Farms smaller than 60 ha in the sample differed markedly in production and cost structure from those that were larger. For these smaller properties, meeting the requirements of Rondonia’s new environmental licensing program (LAPRO) may lead to an increase in the sale of land parcels to cover debts and a speeding up of land consolidation in the region.","inCitations":["2f268f0684f115563e2bbc05f30a86fd3c7be830","58603b1e913d7e8f7d4bc9d384bf753b9d639384","507ca4dbaf84ba57ece416440d4ba9abe3bee187"],"pdfUrls":["https://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol16/iss2/art7/ES-2011-4098.pdf"],"title":"Highly Optimized Tolerant (HOT) Farms in Rondônia: Productivity and Farm Size, and Implications for Environmental Licensing","doi":"10.5751/ES-04098-160207","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.5751/ES-04098-160207","venue":""}

In the first two steps, incoming messages are classified based on the white /black lists and are identified as “legitimate SMS” and “spam SMS”. If the number of incoming message is not in those lists, the message is examined according to their meaning and morphological features. The success rate of k-Nearest Neighbor and Naive Bayes algorithms is about 96%.

The goal of the path planning is to find a minimum-flight-time closed tour of the UAV visiting all executable areas of given remote sensing and communication tasks; in order to incorporate the nonlinear vehicle dynamics, this problem is regarded as a dynamically-constrained traveling salesman problem with neighborhoods. To obtain a close-to-optimal solution for the path planning in a tractable manner, a sampling-based roadmap algorithm that embeds an optimal control-based path generation process is proposed. The algorithm improves the computational efficiency by reducing numerical computations required for optimizing inefficient local paths, and by extracting additional information from a roadmap of a fixed number of samples. Comparative numerical simulations validate the efficiency of the presented algorithm in reducing computation time and improving the solution quality compared to previous roadmap-based planning methods.","inCitations":["4db2f84239905d88236b04b4a8549e130a0d4e01","d6a2edb751fefe8d9a2422d2d0d93e5f550e8d3b","0f8c29bf4337e4cd6e5375a92f6136e603dd6651","7125887dda67655f329ceacf80f5f4b399e632be","43f64435ddaaea80230a8a81fca5af0ea121295a","325a5d3405f11e8229a81834ae562c3ec87d9f0b","2a107396db3026b782429ee13b24082c8815f8b1"],"pdfUrls":["http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.06008","https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.06008v1.pdf"],"title":"Optimal control-based UAV path planning with dynamically-constrained TSP with neighborhoods","doi":"10.23919/iccas.2017.8204468","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.23919/iccas.2017.8204468","venue":"2017 17th International Conference on Control, Automation and Systems (ICCAS)"}

They inscribe in their texts similarities or differences or both to extant international (and national) texts and sources. This is how literary meaning is produced, this is how status is implicitly but effectively ascribed to works, authors, and literatures, and thus resulting in (inter)cultural work including the enriching of a national literature. From a comprehensive perspective, this is how the history of literature -which differs from, but is not unrelated to, the history of literary life -is being made: Not intra-nationally nor in the context of an indiscriminate internationality but within configured sets of more or less closely connected literatures that change throughout time. In order to outline the internationalist making of American literatures and to compare typically American configurations of interliterary processes, Frank presents a number of such interliterary configurations.

High swelling occurred at above pH 5.5 through chain relaxation. It was observed that swelling in VAC/MAA was lower than VAC/AA copolymers. The lower swelling in VAC/MAA copolymer is due to the presence of hydrophobic methyl group and higher pKa value of this copolymer.","inCitations":["f5435359616e81ad9a542ae90dd73cf02602f51b","10d01c3b2ba21ee7c65acfff83f79e99391d83a0","effa82b0b532b220f936d44414994d009bad414b","eacfb045389b0815039c0e51c6311879dc9861a1","f3dfa79c1d89ec0762011b9fdbf5a1e0c069699d"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Swelling behaviour of pH-sensitive crosslinked poly(vinyl acetate co-acrylic acid) hydrogels for site specific drug delivery.","doi":"","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"Pakistan journal of pharmaceutical sciences"}

Typically, 4.3-5.2 GBq of [(18)F]DPA-C5yne, ready-to-use, chemically and radiochemically pure (> 95%), was obtained with specific radioactivities ranging from 55 to 110 GBq/µmol within 50-60 min, starting from a 30 GBq [(18)F]fluoride batch (14-17%). LogP and LogD of [(18)F]DPA-C5yne were measured using the shake-flask method and values of 2.39 and 2.51 were found, respectively. Autoradiography studies performed on slices of ((R,S)-α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolopropionique (AMPA)-lesioned rat brains showed a high target-to-background ratio (1.9 ± 0.3). Selectivity and specificity of the binding for the translocator protein was demonstrated using DPA-C5yne (unlabelled), PK11195 and Flumazenil (central benzodiazepine receptor ligand) as competitors. Furthermore, DPA-C5yne proved to be stable in plasma at 37°C for at least 90 min.","inCitations":["518794cffa5095d39fecfc9c203aea0bade6fa06","6cec479da0b96c4c6bb556c71f39e21a3ba6cb2d","6c903fe6d7b88e29abf94834cfe467924691d029","a38463c0b360563e4ccae2437f67d42a983a033e"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"[18F]DPA-C5yne, a novel fluorine-18-labelled analogue of DPA-714: radiosynthesis and preliminary evaluation as a radiotracer for imaging neuroinflammation with PET.","doi":"10.1002/jlcr.3199","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1002/jlcr.3199","venue":"Journal of labelled compounds & radiopharmaceuticals"}

During signalosome assembly, members of the growth factor receptor–bound protein 2 (Grb2) family of cytosolic adaptor proteins bind cooperatively to LAT through interactions with its phosphorylated tyrosine (pTyr) residues. We demonstrated the Src homology 2 (SH2) domain–mediated dimerization of the Grb2 family member, Grb2-related adaptor downstream of Shc (Gads). Gads dimerization was mediated by an SH2 domain interface, which is distinct from the pTyr binding pocket and which promoted cooperative, preferential binding of paired Gads to LAT. This SH2 domain–intrinsic mechanism of cooperativity, which we quantified by mathematical modeling, enabled Gads to discriminate between dually and singly phosphorylated LAT molecules. Mutational inactivation of the dimerization interface reduced cooperativity and abrogated Gads signaling in T cells and mast cells. The dimerization-dependent, cooperative binding of Gads to LAT may increase antigen receptor sensitivity by reducing signalosome formation at incompletely phosphorylated LAT molecules, thereby prioritizing the formation of complete signalosomes.","inCitations":["3ae2ed20adb6debcdb02cfe7b549b9bca30f3f11","2026498c4cebf02eda1674eeebaccc62164986f5","9cfe807c7e1ace2231393b7f54a6d7562a0d07fa","0d16e44e5dbd5068ecb437e5d0f071c90492d00f"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Dimerization of the adaptor Gads facilitates antigen receptor signaling by promoting the cooperative binding of Gads to the adaptor LAT","doi":"10.1126/scisignal.aal1482","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1126/scisignal.aal1482","venue":"Science Signaling"}

However, both mammalian hibernators and fetuses are able to temporarily \"switch-off\" Kleiber's rule as an adaptation to limited food or oxygen supply. Further exceptions to the usual metabolic size relationship are observed in newborn mammals. For instance, neonatal mouse hearts exhibit slower calorimetric \"dying curves\" under conditions of ischemia, although their aerobic tissue metabolic rates are higher than in adult samples. This is apparently due to a transient reduction of metabolic rate back to the former feto-maternal level. A continuing deviation from metabolic size allometry is found in newborn marsupials (Monodelphis domestica) where the \"inappropriately\" low specific metabolic rate is a precondition of efficient growth and tissue aerobiosis in spite of extreme immaturity. Obviously, adaptive suppression of elevated metabolism in organisms of small size results in a dramatic improvement of oxygen supply.

The value of clean air was determined, using Contingent Evaluation Method from the viewpoint of 100 workers (50 workers in each workplace) as case group, and 100 administrative personnel as control group. The results demonstrated that, the average payments by workers are 77500 and 16700 Rials per person monthly in the case and control groups respectively. The workers were exposed to 3 options as: discount in payment of insurance premium and tax, causing an increase in partnership monthly payment in the case group: 39% and 55% respectively, and in the control group equivalent to 20% and 36% respectively. It is worth mentioning that, to pay loan to the workers did not indicate any significant difference between case and control groups partnerships.","inCitations":["41e303e6f19146cee13a4aa02c2e46689a5ecf3c"],"pdfUrls":["https://www.sid.ir/FileServer/JE/86320023414.pdf","https://www.tums.ac.ir/1394/05/17/Golbabaei%20IJPH%202002.pdf-shahtaheri-2015-08-08-12-33.pdf","http://ijph.tums.ac.ir/index.php/ijph/article/download/1979/1960"],"title":"Evaluation of Clean Air from Viewpoint of Tile Industry Personnel","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

The structural and magnetic properties of granular films prepared by using different annealing recipes have been investigated by x-ray diffraction, superconducting quantum interference device magnetometry, and transmission electron microscopy. Large spherical hexagonal MnAs nanocrystals are obtained when using rapid thermal annealing. Small tetrahedral zincblende Mn(Ga)As clusters result when annealing under MBE conditions. In both cases, the matrix develops a small tensile strain of similar value. The contribution from diffuse scattering to the diffraction from the granular layers is pronounced only for films with hexagonal clusters. Strong ferromagnetic behavior is observed only in films with hexagonal clusters.","inCitations":["c93fd808becbbedf06c6a2d98618e7302b2483c1","646fa51770b7d43d05f4b207c36ff09e3ad4771b","97fd866c0b1d317b128e2195676f5dccb5b57927","ca6fc666bef3cf954828a9f044d4892b4952a85b","9fe40435a713e6e04db1bff497e86c207d07f5fe","8796d53f8d59bf55942c4b7009c6e2ef5fe5537d","20b05ab2fbcf9560c51b7b2b253ef9135c10d6d2","d3c0076ef3db8a78ff57125b242dea7b511c4d5f","281fe8b5985a2a35b54cc8929a4910658ba77b8e","5e8a6bbbbbd54f6390b4203070bbec75ba860aea","6f14790e87e2b68f6eb7bb64144264cdac6bd458","1c6b39c0751e78b34411e8a10a31695337e227a0","8087ec4288857e757b78c7210b81557da3938c63","285b2f29536615d01e327768683429d3ebc928bf","683d739907230129fff10b79fec7ce62537ab3e6","cd8abfd4ab0d41ec0dc19e24bbb3892461c35d7f"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Correlation of structure and magnetism in GaAs with embedded Mn(Ga)As magnetic nanoclusters","doi":"10.1063/1.1506402","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1063/1.1506402","venue":""}

However, most researchers have observed a significant increase in NOx emissions with biodiesel when compared to petrodiesel. The exact cause of this increase is still unclear; however, researchers believe that the fuel properties have been shown to effect the emissions of NOx. The present work reviews the effect of fuel properties and composition on NOx emissions from biodiesel fuelled engines. The paper is organised in three sections. The first section deals with the NOx formation mechanisms. In the following section, the reasons for increased NOx emissions of biodiesel fuel are discussed. After this, the influence of composition and fuel properties on NOx emissions from biodiesel fuelled engines has been reviewed. Finally, some general conclusions concerning this problem are summarised and further researches are pointed out.","inCitations":["0c06ce4dbe1ef9531514105e3cf491ac96eda528","7f60ab15db212c1706837c5ed518f7b628e316e5","6f05247285ff417722406410db4b86e82ada38f3","9a0a4b5103ff286a67f8536fa33cd597b0b2e776","5a31d6eda53e3eb8c51163fe3e419e6771c46ff8","f2ee007cda4202862eccf6e02580910ff1a857de","635e62f41380a23257e3f7fccd4a803ab5397418","a5698a222d25df7bcc97e9776dd979d7b29eaf40","3bc98e673f9d4e390f9aaa9616f4d001636fef52","94dbbb65924eed9208366acece55177bda764482","c74d083cdaec166c064ee4e87850d54de71626cf","c5715ba82614247938156983fded44beeded1b1e","16a53e99041977979efdd59d658fbd9fb489d7c6","22255b82016d5ab66bcedee19d8fed8c84d0af80","c892f458b112057652f4cde5b670e8be38c36828","824f796867ece81b4a8958a71562b8550a1daada","4b0acabc6434aa9b136309ee256bf2694d3eac3e","d865dabe2b71ffbd287c2a023fea2d8e40790a2a","0aaa848a1b2004e36897c999a81f3536201efad3","6ad87f7d4afc864bb69871327a299c2e5e979391","a4827fb4ee3ea0f40294ea19b45775ce237bfa0c","277f68042f37051bb4f017b2ea160680930fe4df","d4f1851ddbb627d7e7adbb89321a984193223fbf","41fc97415ffd84542c8e0dd8f01c8e783c1897d7","b41fbefeeea3973511caba6ffd8a1c20af8c1016","f59d6e0201a146047cb2857c011ea3bff05b6a90","3ae75085e7d77b3c28e458cfd24897cdfab6fdbd","a32a163044d18fd637ff250e380397976b4d462e","7337a0fc5a6a6bb816427a0ae7aae28987436cc0","415887105828b2a30949fe1a1081c087998cfe89","3dcd1adea09c9355220cf7f03a7bfe7b17293eaf","8d8cd9bd271f3755ff203a1669088b6c65677436","a3e2e8164dd5c1311a7eaf10c964f10b930ac6c5","f5228ade4df7137de717fd097b9e4939ab3119dc","c032f34af4c69a1f3d12a9558b83239e50f4b343","063a7e03d7d7f4fbc62433ea292706a92765f986","3c17776239eef0a20260d883f3e58f3f55f39614","4487b14d9a3a763d04717e3a5cbcb514bb72986e","b99200101e9ca6ce1d8578f6c9884cb18147a84e"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Influence of fuel properties and composition on NOx emissions from biodiesel powered diesel engines: A review","doi":"10.1016/j.rser.2012.03.056","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rser.2012.03.056","venue":""}
