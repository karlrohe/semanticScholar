Protein-rich cells can be cultured simultaneous to nitrogen removal. For the first time, efficient nitrogen source range, kinetics of nitrogen removal and biomass accumulation of PSB bioconversion technology were studied. Results are that efficient nitrogen range is 3–8000 mg·L−1, which covers most wastewaters. Biokinetics was fit to Michaelis–Menten model, Monod model and inhibition models including Haldane, Edwards, and Aiba models. The data were best fitted by Aiba model, with an R2 of 0.97. Vmax, Km, and Ki of nitrogen degradation were 0.065 d−1, 1344 mg·L−1, and 6525 mg·L−1, respectively, and μmax, Ks, and Ki of biomass accumulation were 5.88 d−1, 883 mg·L−1, and 1521 mg·L−1, respectively. PSB bioconversion technology is more suitable than others for high nitrogen wastewater treatment.","inCitations":["bcc09d2bdc39fc848701490648883b3242e7ca11","4c2f4cd2ae70296afe677e3fc2c14aaa7fa6ceea"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Bioconversion of wastewater by photosynthetic bacteria: Nitrogen source range, fundamental kinetics of nitrogen removal, and biomass accumulation","doi":"10.1016/j.biteb.2018.08.012","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biteb.2018.08.012","venue":""}

Ustilago may disinfects primordia of all aerial organs of maize (Zea mays L.) and results in the formation of large plant tumours. Previously, we have found that U. maydis infection of seedling leaves, adult leaves and tassels causes organ-specific transcriptional changes in both the pathogen and the host. Of particular interest, U. may disgenes encoding secreted proteins are differentially expressed depending on the colonized maize organ. Therefore, we hypothesized that the fungus secretes virulence-related proteins (effectors)that act in an organ-specific manner. Here, we present the identification and functional characterization of 20 presumptive organ-specific U. maydis effector genes. Ustilago maydis deletion strains for these genes were generated and tested for infectivity of maize seedling leaves and tassels. This approach identified 11 effector genes required for the full virulence of U. maydis. In nine cases, virulence was only affected in one of the tested plant organs. These results demonstrate that individual fungal effector proteins contribute to fungal virulence in an organ-specific manner.","inCitations":["ae651a0dec1f75a1c6aad76a9e56f83dda57ede8","7a22edf840cc1e92214f319d20e241b0c43405d9","394b3f3dd87df726f10e5f01ecc268a21898ffc0","5afeab47fccc5ec28bbab527b593b9930d6addf7","1d7b7e90beb876576e2780e4c94c3b6b2bed0e39","4b87acc80ac32a50dcd6b419e39debab590f3e42","df65e9ae2d4af9ea1dfbf0ca53c2703020e9c361","4f1f0e66564c419f898cc9356d4b260791d9657e","5cf3d0c532f8bfcec8c76048a01c833269d0089f","d776086111beb8a725db1b71c1ec4b1ac7b912a7","5025eefe5e8325ac3febfe8dab9b3a4c65c8df1b","da3707667999782b3eb3b53f9f0e1e79050b1fdc","3bf300f0e5092bb318d7e3a36b6e46612d45b6a5","f2788a764ee5ceb6d8e8665b7fe5ffddd211bd0e","4425d05fbaa8669546956dfc729d97f770cc3121","467cf43451dd3d7b5e7877f06ff5549d2f2f8971","c2ed46a9d39f99919a9969dfeb395fc9e226384e","bcbe8fe735d9ba3bc362680efb7ba012a57fa8ee","1723f76c778a0245c924ac8da748fa490db7ebc7","18f0b72718df9e46c32ea2e9d79d40d9e4982e7c","8e85f4f29fbfc99a9e23746088d8449036c46f42","aba82c8370df9770a0d698577de980ab9d6b708a","d48f267eae88d2c0ef35ca2c61e170520d3969f4","cfd32cb930ce1728e86e2d1b898ef63ce330c267","5d5ccc043b23716707ac1052f9a390f1a2aaab68","bc48d271d92974ba0cb5be090a22681d197e1efd","cdee704b10c89af14d32cb77a46dbb8811cfb332","7233202401854e8ea9ec22a0e62930059b708d24"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Virulence of the maize smut Ustilago maydis is shaped by organ-specific effectors.","doi":"10.1111/mpp.12133","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1111/mpp.12133","venue":"Molecular plant pathology"}

As is known, the obstruction for a Hermitian operator to be selfadjoint or to have selfadjoint extensions is measured by a pair of deficiency indices, and associated deficiency spaces; but in practical problems, the direct computation of these indices can be difficult. Instead, in this paper we identify additional structures that throw light on the problem. We will attack the problem of computing deficiency spaces for a single Hermitian operator with dense domain in a Hilbert space which occurs in a duality relation with a second Hermitian operator, often in the same Hilbert space.","inCitations":["c494621fd0e55588b68557cb700113b33a1710c1"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Unbounded Hermitian operators and relative reproducing kernel Hilbert space","doi":"10.2478/s11533-010-0021-8","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.2478/s11533-010-0021-8","venue":""}

Methods: We identified 161 surgically treated PIP joint fractures between 2004 and 2015 at 2 academic medical systems. Demographic, injury, radiographic, and treatment data that might be associated with reoperation were collected. Bivariate analysis was performed. Factors identified during bivariate analysis with a P < .10 were entered into a multivariable logistic regression analysis. Results: Of the 161 fingers, 25 underwent revision surgery. Open fracture was independently associated with revision surgery. The most common indication for reoperation was joint stiffness (35%). In a subanalysis of 111 closed fractures, no factors were associated with revision surgery. Conclusions: Soft tissue injury is a major factor in reoperation after PIP joint fracture dislocation. Specific attention should be paid to persistent subluxation because this may predispose to early arthrosis.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Reoperation After Operative Fixation of Proximal Interphalangeal Joint Fractures.","doi":"10.1177/1558944719858429","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1177/1558944719858429","venue":"Hand"}

Most of them are benign and do not recur when totally removed by surgery. It is very important to distinguish between schwannoma and primary benign neurofibroma. Neurofibromas are lesions having the possibility for malignant transformation and recurrence. A case of schwannoma in the nasal cavity is reported, and the diagnostic and therapeutic procedures, as well as recommendations from the literature, are described. The histological and immunohistochemical features are discussed in detail to draw a distinction between schwannoma and neurofibroma. In cases of intranasal and paranasal lesions, the existence of a schwannoma must be considered. Differentiating between schwannoma and neurofibroma is important for estimating the risk of malignant transformation and recurrence.","inCitations":["23eb023183a3cc4adfdf03a8128ebdf4765cecb9","4b0c3a843f9728862f82f528cd022084bccbe761"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"[Schwannoma of the nasal cavity: a case report].","doi":"10.1007/s00106-007-1612-y","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00106-007-1612-y","venue":"HNO"}

After a topical application of CBBF on the skin lesions, the dermatitis score, epidermal thickness, mast cell number, and interleukin (IL)-4 and interferon (IFN)-γ, as well as the levels of histamine and immunoglobulin E (IgE) in the serum, were measured. Moreover, effect of CBBF on histamine release was examined using RBL-2H3 under stimulation with 2,4-dinitrophenylated bovine serum albumin (DNP-BSA).\n\n\nRESULTS\nCBBF inhibited atopic dermatitis symptoms and signs in the DNFB-treated NC/Nga mice. The suppressive activity of topically applied CBBF may be due to the dose-dependent blockade of a series of immunopathological events, including the release of histamine, the production of IgE, and the secretion of IL-4 and IFN-γ. However, this extract did not directly suppress the degranulation process, assessed by measuring β-hexosaminidase release.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nOur results suggest that CBBF can be applied as an effective herbal remedy to treat atopic dermatitis.","inCitations":["334e740ae33c0b7d24a3113d27781c5165ddf56e","892d308b6786777aba7418a2c38be58b77d398e9","8a44a826bab911223735ac378f368ebf10752afa","5d5c5fc141c83534616b0ea5f9911081d8f06821","f335100fa77599c21545263fcd4055d0fef0643d","db4f28cb811a9ae3af3504537639636fa69da761","29beeaaed6c0a126f2175b15e2dab5c6f00f528c","e9e3328bd4e95c671cda32e6a1a6544d320b6ced","25775c378f7d50229ed37071c1c38c297d6f7438","62f6e8ffcc8c26c255030be1ddcb1a0835bcdb0e","947753ddff866392da187f0f0c3d653908f9a517","ad39dd36676fbe922ac3192a5be7cfb57ea60333","dd5b8be96b7b5e9241e33b85985b4162fb822723","f4b76346e854f91bd8603532a82d8fa1aebb2693","4a668c9c950e51ebf873cf633d56cc973ca0792f","63fb8e16af4dfd9c93fbdec7ed297f0384c0ba01"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.goldencordyceps.com/res/download/cordyceps%20bassiana%20-%20atopic%20dermatitis%20(journal%20of%20ethnopharmacology).pdf"],"title":"Inhibition of 2,4-dinitrofluorobenzene-induced atopic dermatitis by topical application of the butanol extract of Cordyceps bassiana in NC/Nga mice.","doi":"10.1016/j.jep.2010.12.012","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2010.12.012","venue":"Journal of ethnopharmacology"}

Intensive intermolecular steady-state nuclear Overhauser effects (NOEs) were observed by 1D and 2D NMR methods between the hydrogen atoms of the chlorophenyl group of indomethacin and the hydrogen atoms of the alkyl chains of lecithin. Only weak interactions were found between indomethacin protons and head group protons of lecithin. NOE growth rates showed that the distance between the chlorophenyl groups of indomethacin and the alkyl chains of lecithin must be of the same order as some intramolecular distances in lecithin. It was concluded that these chlorophenyl groups are able to penetrate into the lecithin bilayer of vesicle walls.","inCitations":["20a6a13d7ce4d795e2d470e1951691f726f7618a","b3c845f1a0339671c6cbd4b8736553a27ad88dd6","3dd4b0cf9d315e74a846eb35b0315399f68f825f","1259e918d929e732369d96f495a99bbb2410d9ba","577c631c75a99794d83bd9246899efa447461dda","249f8ba3d0a9648cf6c53c640c87c87bb3251686","a1d8794911a6024dd43d34b0902291b9201d6931","724c9ce87e3290a272900b9de08ef850dbef15c6","5b0c50f719eb54178bf01198d99cae6a2e619c93","7d049ef59fd09ee155b8cb364a0586e39738bbb7","f38e911aae8bead008dd9e4a3ecd9df54f0c5451","aee7a4a29f2202576cae6812bf707e7ba9e22fa0","3fa17da256faac68e516a1a3755cef2e8e78807d","7fecedebb9330a762c22f6cbf9c9db78100a5f2d","d45a75de28b6c1918f0176c7ec0a08796705516e","5dc040d8abece7746ea7b62bd4f6c52293a334f6","c9be841e4714ab5cbcaa086b5385cc20fbda0acb","8a516806292dc921c87f12e893285a5e13676c5a","ac2fe22e6a761ec8bfa39d78fa24d84c688f1a3f","b1136382f43aec56a964d3779619a996eacad23f","efdd35a130e24e2e5f32c1765e0d8e6156210747","c016ff3cc4208fca6d9d0df7fb06266c9ff765eb"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"The Interactions of Phospholipid-vesicles with Some Anti-inflammatory Agents","doi":"10.1016/0021-9797(88)90013-6","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/0021-9797%2888%2990013-6","venue":""}

GRUBER May 2012 Advisor: Dr. Gongkang Fu Major: Civil Engineering Degree: Doctor or Philosophy The prescriptive design of the most widely used residential building code in the United States, the IRC, allows the use of partially restrained wood shear walls to resist wind and seismic loads. Wind load is the most common controlling lateral design load for these structures. In contrast, the complimenting building code, the IBC, requires either a restraining dead load or a mechanical hold down device to resist overturning. To prescribe a safe structure, it is important to know the effect of partial restraint on the overturning resistance of wood shear walls constructed in accordance with the IRC and equally important whether the partially restrained wood shear walls provide the same level of reliability as fully restrained wood shear walls for wind load. This is the focus of this research. Twenty five Monotonic tests were conducted of 4’ x 8’ wood shear walls with five varying restraining methods (wall types). There were five sets of five wall types. One of the sets had only an anchor bolt, three sets had different dead loads with one anchor bolt, and one set had a mechanical hold down. The results of the test program were used to determine the partial restraint effect, create a nonlinear finite element model,","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://digitalcommons.wayne.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1441&context=oa_dissertations"],"title":"Reliability and effect of partially restrained wood shear walls","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Its activity is regulated by a positive feedback loop whereby its terminal enzymatic product, H3K27me3, is specifically recognized and bound by an aromatic cage present in its EED subunit. The ensuing allosteric activation of the complex stimulates H3K27me3 deposition on chromatin. Here, we report a step-wise feedback mechanism entailing key residues within distinctive interfacing motifs of EZH2 or EED that are found mutated in cancers and/or Weaver syndrome. PRC2 harboring these EZH2 or EED mutants manifest little activity in vivo but, unexpectedly, exhibited similar chromatin association as wild-type PRC2, indicating an uncoupling of PRC2 activity and recruitment. With genetic and chemical tools, we further demonstrated that targeting allosteric activation overrode the gain-of-function effect of EZH2Y646X oncogenic mutations. These results revealed critical implications to the regulation and biology of PRC2 and a novel vulnerability in tackling PRC2-addicted cancers.","inCitations":["d15c9dedb5891eca43ed024cd875efc9b9540003","1a5719ca94b6a56ae9983e0d7cd3dc0e46b27ec1","45820922e03a16d02d604624a1d9816b06bf256d","03da72d4b99e3aee7afbd97eccfafbf37b736ab2","4dbaadd9d5d1ecf8671b33887f454041dd293af4","cb46a05c707f6250a844a8ce82476eb1a07a664a","927973a323613022b7084c9823ae5f52fb287ff8","e1cc770f6d6815c4b8ba713b9d0d5c0dee334bcd","e54ab89819ccdd265431f5bb294ccf4f0a90b23a","22d58808a2ee5dac0cf840dffc142af48b55200d","e360fc8f3a279480f8ad3a90a6b529ca5b6ca027"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Allosteric activation dictates PRC2 activity independent of its recruitment to chromatin","doi":"10.1101/206383","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1101/206383","venue":""}

We reviewed available literature and museum voucher specimens to provide a more accurate range description, and we discuss recent collections in south Florida. Longnose Gar has not been previously reported in natural habitats south of Lake Okeechobee. Instead, records south of the lake are from canals, and most are recent (since 2000), including our own southernmost 2011 record. No records from Everglades natural habitats have been collected. Previous studies have shown native range expansions in anthropogenically disturbed landscapes. We suggest that the Longnose Gar is expanding its range southward in Florida using canals as dispersal vectors and/or suitable habitat.","inCitations":["c99c004c057b182ed2e978699ff67e3c5a03c476","f5e11e11b7f5f18341850e7db21c8f9d48676107"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Canals as Vectors for Fish Movement: Potential Southward Range Expansion of Lepisosteus osseus L.

The question is whether the risk premium factor aects bond prices. Equivalently, we may ask whether the factor is spanned by the crosssection of term structure. This paper nds that the factor is almost but not completely hidden from term structure. Particularly, Treasury bill yields are shown to have unique information about the risk premium factor, which is missing from Treasury bonds. Moreover, the factor is found to be visualized as a wedge shape on Treasury bill yields. The factor predicts a decrease in the level factor of term structure, but survey forecasts do not seem to be aware of its existence. The risk premium factor also predicts negative economic growth meanwhile the slope factor predicts positive growth. This implies that the risk premium and slope factors have qualitatively dierent information.

The system can photograph an inner alimentary canal to obtain infrared image information, and a capsule endoscope is controllable, so gastrointestinal endoscopy is controllable; medical workers are provided with a basis for instant, repeated and extensive detection of suspicious focuses at the same time; and the system can photograph the inner alimentary canal to obtain the infrared image information and therefore obtains accurate position information and supplies correct information for subsequent surgeries.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Active infrared wireless capsule endoscopy system","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Local recurrence was determined radiographically and confirmed either pathologically or clinically.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAt a median followup of 40 months, 6 patients (7.7%) have recurred locally, with a median interval of 22 months (range 8 to 62 months) from the time of resection. Three patients did not undergo additional operative treatment and died of disease progression. Three patients underwent additional resection and are alive without evidence of disease. The estimated 5-year local recurrence-free survival for all patients with noninvasive IPMN is 87%. One of 50 patients (2%) with margins negative for IPMN recurred versus 4 of 23 patients (17%) with margins positive for IPMN (p=0.02).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nPatients who have undergone resection for noninvasive IPMN require indefinite surveillance because local recurrences may be identified several years from the initial operation and be resected while still noninvasive. Although the risk of local recurrence appears to increase in the setting of positive margins, the majority of patients with positive margins have not developed local recurrence. Negative margins should be the goal of the operation when achievable with partial pancreatectomy, but the risk of local recurrence is not high enough to mandate total pancreatectomy for microscopic positive margins.","inCitations":["3d6756c1f6cb20115400ca212de4afa345d47305","2cf35bf562c9d3f6609443b89d23b3965c76a868","d0dc679cc20a883737d00734c092c283af26c05e","fa919c4bee5afbfd7d7c1e24f0f8244cf3c66f79","adc5dcac0d6ef9990f7c8467bcff2189d2fdc496","0a08341b0e57059a438263311571bea28132b231","5930c7aeb75974bab9473f0f55e8ac954a59296e","38e52e29a3e0282945f8f9c629efa294517cab54","4946acb13e2e1a0c588a4076a6866b4e04385241","f3a3dcf38d96760795961b5dc6c5d1e653197a30","1b45acb123e9e8fa420a8d535e9416fc861d5d07","51eb0efd6f43f5d876b29d5335194438a1bbd29e","3177aae865d39a392c216d810d6fe1d4e9110851","5d5c009fb46798fdb59345cba93407b0355b7459","4d9a743fce7a8df207a6d3f690fdeab41d3da8e2","61f823138d80abae737064774e6ee096879e0a55","21ad375371b1117aa53b432241df802a619d4f08","99fd2a474d386d1174c9957690f37045a0dd5afd","96cc300c1b88254b652baff5898ab6907b7edbfe","cd251a08141e2fec66c0d631fbe9cc20afbe55df","4f38e784e30757fbc64f74dca554ab2876f3e058","69ac62b91f4e8e20be78f0869966c636b330cfd9","5d0294554c308c95820965739d85bef52629a4b4","452278e06c6bd7df3e7ccb2de6d0196014d70570","a9e5193d9e7dfffc1a7a7fd053922ed82df2da27","5318d9f332b24fa692e4160839d14e1c8c979e88","1b550d7fe7ef1ec8bca6082de9a4e78b1220cc49","7d03f584ac7e9de81a289bf9680286cf0bf8e2bf","f578cca1718f500072930b3a4a8d5fb7afb1d680","0859c819d16c04d3a3c0f4d9887eeebf61d82486","ccaaab6f0cb01e7d2f1bdf67df9f167148876a1a","cf5122f43d3176fd53501808d1fa906345a7d9d6","f80b9b4e467e7931a1ef3f150a70876f06d0d35b","88072b8988207974cf9ad5b4e30cab2392b3f34b","585188569b5b066955bbfd7b6c65de2f8d9427e7","df796c01c7687189380bae6f6e9a032162fd7837","76c3681a5add05e47272369d7b4cb247446dbd08","85e96ed2c4761637feda2e024d37dd7645ea3447","b3d4faa7f551e3934e43835c570691c51ab86fe0","e511c7b70e0cdd238f1eaf96a80754bcbf02c299","8e1a13e7c71ce142bced5783a11a6743262d2029","538ce767716f26578a932eb210ef587a3e900a4a","6cc057d70c4a2b0ff111323d37d660041dca24bf","42d16c857369448b28c5a2436116b29c83cdd6cf","87c99a87de2f4d5a962cd920f294b96e150fa441","d40264d8b8cd33f198b9b2313386ec027cf2df3a","1e87d224e5c52e853b6ce26d82f710416302d7fc","0ffdc14d63d1450a4e31071fbca82b19c416c3e5","7569b0372c8bd507bae1113bc09012bd40714e14","2e2ed6f128e64e75ac1e945829911205a1da765d","c110eb81cf758f15b56c076c5a08506677e21b1b","e38aa23129fd0916ca902cb14af71a5ad6665aa2","0a7d994b6e61bc4778dc66e0ab5547478094b038","533f19f21014a4ebf0be36eed739d2fa91c9e30d","457f1b55d6dc4bea5c681cdb9212806cde6b72c7","3f9beae9899fb3b596c12c165d551fa20aac9177","8bd218d891d2d34bc78e646ab0f5c7ad650616d1","a35b6f5e23fabd168a1b9fd86e2d3ec6f6348abb","e0139c147bdeb61822dd57d56a9aea08270e4587","51ea6980269ebd606ed73eb6d7935e92b845db35","e9141c86949948355e35f1d5a491e76ce890faea","def7b6b7866439135aa6c3aaa05864773dbe2c3f","60933f647be503f710ba2e2a34ee1052b5ca4555","71ffd4ece595522ba47f8e138e33c236668c9868","424c47322037aac0384f28c53525a37441b57881","c64c3a577fe4f6b5de352add4f4608b1bc78ed26","e2167c4b71af3fd31811ffbef83c0bfb325f6064","1557080c431379da7ae2dfc1ed3ee8c94b53c4ec","a614b9040a32380cbfde902493da8acb4c11f283","80f41c567fbc7687874d45ab1252764b99e7e0d6","37a7b71988a2aa5d88ffb72455ae39167537b60a","92a22ae3826c53e4eef4e130cdde71588583348d","54d4c018df7b3834a321eb75e1fb8171ba90d949","41edb11c3792acfbdf03910c2bc7bc0d1024bc0a","5e259343f4d064864bbdcc3839816791600e7adf","2d10cf30b335b8c226764590c5f0855969aca6dd","fc67b03dcce44604b7a509b14910aa915769049a","4ef407de2fe8b8a336558839647263f49850ffe9","890490d494df60848604b0355e668360a9d6cc45","10efb745e0b765d9af2cbb86b6ed807cb493a8b4"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Fate of the remnant pancreas after resection of noninvasive intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm.","doi":"10.1016/j.jamcollsurg.2006.12.040","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jamcollsurg.2006.12.040","venue":"Journal of the American College of Surgeons"}

These jets have major implications for the east coast of the AP, a region of rapid climatic warming and where two large sections of ice shelf have collapsed in recent years. \n \nDuring three foehn events across the AP, leeside warming and drying is seen in new aircraft observations and simulated well by the Met Office Unified Model (MetUM) at ∼1.5 km grid spacing. In case A, weak southwesterly flow and an elevated upwind inversion characterise a highly nonlinear flow regime with upwind flow blocking. In case C strong northwesterly winds characterise a relatively linear case with little upwind flow blocking. Case B resides somewhere between the two in flow regime linearity. \n \nThe foehn jets – apparent in aircraft observations where available and MetUM simulations of all three cases – are mesoscale features (up to 60 km in width) originating from the mouths of leeside inlets. Through back trajectory analysis they are identified as a type of gap flow. In cases A and B the jets are distinct, being strongly accelerated relative to the background flow, and confined to low levels above the Larsen C Ice Shelf. They resemble the ‘shallow foehn’ of the Alps. Case C resembles a case of ‘deep foehn’, with the jets less distinct. The foehn jets are considerably cooler and moister relative to adjacent regions of calmer foehn air. This is due to a dampened foehn effect in the jet regions: in case A the jets have lower upwind source regions, and in the more linear case C there is less diabatic warming and precipitation along jet trajectories due to the reduced orographic uplift across the mountain passes.","inCitations":["a667f9d421c7a6bb42bb65bd1f4b89fa5e7fecb2","94bb07184ba0aa00132386850cf869308deeff3d","17f6a5d9bb75f51969e446fd04aa602a804200ad","2b10df1bd1d7d6c5c20b0c14733b89fc9c1de65e","b798054e020324391418d44c7339e335f20b22c4","9f90156d995256375198a36897c7bbb74bc4f16a","f824d50a118c3b35ed0fc81540b9b002aac24d36","66d6804677eda5f0fe9349ccc112c787e25688cd","8b9cc3981632b8dc55550cead1e3e776d9d0da78","b8980d1ef156d6e47d1fd6df24e8271dc85cfa6b","626cf89cee819516c7efd69d5e3f562c603867ea","e063daac6290c69efe27951622af3712840a3156","c79b4854bfe50d571f4f48619e09d880ee8b6a44","7fda3c6b14c0f6786439574167b54dd7182c37c8","b8591773aa193289e67f55e407e96eb098b6550e","f0bc3cbec30a3cab87ad16dd2f4b04d6e96a4738","0622da1abedad1b345a420dea924c0d8c9cf41f7","e8ad16878e2572f0ff858ce13e96997b0ee160f2","ba2eab2464818544ce1950a3cb88628c70153693","b08f445955bdb59fb7d822d8da021a693ae7cb27","dab18800c3c4e37985b1f405a3c3649d166003fe","b95abe738da02c32fcb5c500298f3c17fb8cf882","c501473697d3b4c0bd7eeb275df98ad8db0298a4","109e6db050f338655459522e276a7d6a75e93ddb","02749980fd24de2aa72673d72ea3b32530d14134","5f8d864e83b375370d547300e93284712ac1a956","b2a657330f121094d9e4b5abf4c4439e05fb617e","4f2ad5a899be0d93a7dd00212b567dd2a55a82f6","230eece76f4d6cdb6f02508d4d087961d3bcae99","592d6245cf76ba73d7869d4096c7e0aa7050b734","29c39226f33c41aeb30830ab4f12a2a39d89837e","f36d62e4945361b86a09e1bc087fbeba318d8142","e587906bd49e7e743fc2ca307b6724fdb9d195a1","ad5986ebf3155ebb778d05b218a308b1973722c5","9335e9f8b656b1069e769caeba3d97c4ea0bd892","ca813c953085588cbe47144e9023a660b279513b"],"pdfUrls":["http://centaur.reading.ac.uk/36998/1/Elvidge_et_al-2014-Quarterly_Journal_of_the_Royal_Meteorological_Society.pdf","https://ueaeprints.uea.ac.uk/49033/1/elvidge_etal_foehn_jets_qj2382_QJRMS_2015.pdf"],"title":"Foehn jets over the Larsen C Ice Shelf, Antarctica","doi":"10.1002/qj.2382","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1002/qj.2382","venue":""}

Parents who answered the questions had children in classes ranging from kindergarten to grade 12. NVivo 11 was used for the initial analysis of the dataset, and several themes were identified. After the initial analysis, the data were categorized into major themes to condense the themes. Thirty-eight (73%) of the respondents indicated that their children ate school lunch, 14 (27%) indicated that they prepared lunch for their children to eat at school, and 39 (75%), mostly from non-industrialized countries, indicated that their children ate their home-country staple foods for dinner and on non-school days.

This paper studies the feasibility of using low-grade heat for thermal desalination via a hybrid absorption heat pump system, in which ammonia–water is the working fluid. A thermodynamic model was proposed to simulate the operation for freshwater production of 5000 T/day using multiple effect distillation (MED) technology. Results from the evaluation showed that the performance and waste-water usage are affected by operating pressures and temperatures. Based on Net Present Value evaluation, the economic profitability could be achieved at recommended operating conditions of absorption pressure (  30 °C) at a generation pressure 5 bar. A case study is presented in which water at 90 °C, discharged from process industry in the Sheffield region, is used for generating 20,000 T/day of freshwater. The system proposed consisted of four-stage sequential heat pumps with different operating configurations. These served as individual MED stages. The coefficients of performance were evaluated to be 3–11. According to the specific power consumption, the proposed system is a competitive technology compared with reverse-osmosis technology. Economic profitability could be achieved in 3 years.","inCitations":["879f9b3fec39f4b36456d453ef760e89fa97aed1","a37737ab2da83a5d9d686e532e1e82359bb14d65","46291eae0291cf2a4fb9c1b3eafd8dce1ddcdf4e","6ab0978e32faeddc959507f14cf0348f8db268aa","f4c8e61236391ab0371035e1ef75b363180bde03","dd642933b79ce700943731eb41143436244dd902"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Techno-economic feasibility of absorption heat pumps using wastewater as the heating source for desalination","doi":"10.1016/j.desal.2011.07.049","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.desal.2011.07.049","venue":""}

Bolstered by the Volstead Act, this amendment made Prohibition law: alcohol could no longer be produced, imported, transported, or sold. This bizarre episode is often humorously recalled, frequently satirized, and usually condemned. The more interesting questions, however, are how and why Prohibition came about, how Prohibition worked (and failed to work), and how Prohibition gave way to strict governmental regulation of alcohol.

Carotid baroreflex stimulus-response relations shifted up the response (R-R interval) axis and to the right on the stimulus (pressure) axis (determined as the carotid distending pressure at saturation) within 90-120 s (time between measurements) during the first 10 min. The shifts in position of the reflex relation were sustained throughout the infusion. The position of operational point pressure, relative to carotid distending pressure at saturation, was unchanged throughout the infusion period. These data suggest that human carotid baroreceptor reflex relations change within minutes to retain beat-to-beat pressure regulation as the prevailing pressure increases.","inCitations":["0a0d4e9f70f03e9d85f39ba18d28a61228e5eff3","962303370d547fc2c2310f6934e16e23d4d062a2","29f3bc3c816d452a5072aa9092e2b6582941c64f"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Rapid adaptation of vagal baroreflexes in humans.","doi":"10.1016/0165-1838(94)90068-X","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/0165-1838%2894%2990068-X","venue":"Journal of the autonomic nervous system"}

The proposed protocols effectively use a dual-quantum channel between the communicating entities and, when combined with the proposed selection of the basis, improve the efficiency of the key distribution process as well as deter Eve. With the use of an initialization vector, one of the proposed protocols does not necessitate information exchange about the bases between Alice and Bob, and further eliminates the requirement of the availability of a two-way conventional channel. Simultaneously, it allows the detection of the presence of Eve in real time and proposes several effective defense mechanisms to frustrate Eve's attack.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Fast convergent and secure key distribution protocols using a dual-quantum channel","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

F., Baudic, S., Cesaro, P., Peschanski, M., & Bachoud-Lvi, A. C. (2005). The role of the striatum in rule application. The model of Huntington's disease at early stage. Brain, 128, 11551167; Ullman, M. T., Corkin, S., Coppola, M., Hickok, G., Growdon, J. H., Koroshetz, W. J., & Pinker, S. (1997). A neural dissociation within language: Evidence that the mental dictionary is part of declarative memory, and that grammatical rules are processed by the procedural system. Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience, 9, 266276]. Yet, such impairment was documented only with explicit conjugation tasks in the production domain. Little is known about whether it generalizes to other language modalities such as perception and whether it refers to implicit language processing or rather to intentional rule operations through executive functions. We investigated these issues by assessing perceptive processing of conjugated verb forms in a model of striatal dysfunction, namely, in Huntington's Disease (HD) at early stages. Rule application and lexical processes were evaluated in an explicit task (acceptability judgments on verb and nonword forms) and in an implicit task (lexical decision on frequency-manipulated verb forms). HD patients were also assessed in executive functions, and striatal atrophy was evaluated with magnetic resonance imaging (bicaudate ratio). Results from both tasks showed that HD patients were selectively impaired for rule application but lexical abilities were spared. Bicaudate ratios correlated with rule scores on both tasks, whereas executive parameters only correlated with scores on the explicit task. We argue that the striatum has a core function in linguistic rule application generalizing to perceptive aspects of morphological operations and pertaining to implicit language processes. In addition, we suggest that the striatum may enclose computational circuits that underpin explicit manipulation of regularities.","inCitations":["0fa29e0b4b24f32f35f4a08582f319f3a4139ce5","b716a1ccb7b862d075cb8b30ebc27a779a4277cb","5f1b10554b81053368faa23483274ee8acfe2f3b","c4018ca04b085663fe664f575ad5b07a6a2982a7","5cb23fe297dc1614f452def82546ac9716c11a27","8808249285fc566483bf71dfb9daa9510a57c6af","7dfac94593f20630cdb42e7455921b2e99394e7e","11c775818d95c311ac49f11f05c98a313f696d82","a61840fda7404cabe4f78bd104570bd7df001cf5","cb4d291f06c239eab578f59e404f2c13d229bfa7","0000c4dab0ae7b1cf56582bac2a26037720e8a21","6a4b8725b996954dd4e8036149eb79e3c36e78d3","f91f48b6ecfe69d5f99608fb17cc9906c43dab6c","f71710aef535e9efb403cbe11cb01a21bcde3e6e","a0ed65ad979a1538df55b873895da02df8c745e0","2699784ccb074607ac5765bb97b5707e5d58a78e","7e14e898db61b1c55a1a1efd97e27c642b103e76","4be971e9f2d53a348e0ab92c0ecdd0f98edc6e88","94d2b32bd1e921ef65c7fecc1939e41e808b52eb","e4c0167b6606ea40d01ebfa8bb71113cea8423a4","6511ed33a36333457184066b6af14096dc6b6636","0d7e9221f6bf49130c28399acff8973c6fd4a352","eb9f7b8ea4ab87055e37bb5f46c2123a656e4600","f9dca96edb6871e98b38204e04bd97b78933fd0b","99cf0f82a597f34e4bf38393adeb4d289cc4fe9a","a2ea1e9b6222eff45c61384ad238e51207da629b","acba303e9f1885234982523d55013d42d1fae9db","ce028480b606873bd9a9c1f693bfbe65185850b9","8b51f1db6366ae59cb8f05b1954d7d5c77e70804","135c776668ea643f3b01ff226d76ef6a52bc7c95","bdf1ee05c79e13a5542fb0531880c207e16bd207","2a06983d510aeb87130134ab5688cc5882383ac1","9e9cbd5eceec123ca9a6f122bf729c0501f12044","70997c7fe537515c9bebce5f175595b39a3ed6d6","88373e60b3b0a63546c61f291701a0551fe82988","8542a235b3308a16ac78b155fd90db5eb06e3b3a","bfade2539c2481890c2ea77579d3c2e57ea62f66","68ab9cf2db2c7069726aed1861a85a50f953881d","1b8b91961ad152e954f0a15a10ab718da5a83088"],"pdfUrls":["http://sapience.dec.ens.fr/braware/publi/Teichmann-et-al_JOCN_2006.pdf","http://www.lscp.net/persons/dupoux/papers/Teichmann_DKB_2006_Striatum_and_rules_word_perception_inHD.JournCognNeur.pdf","https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q45302585","http://www.lscp.net/persons/sidk/publi/Teichmann-et-al_JOCN_2006.pdf"],"title":"The Role of the Striatum in Processing Language Rules: Evidence from Word Perception in Huntington's Disease","doi":"10.1162/jocn.2006.18.9.1555","sources":["Medline","DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1162/jocn.2006.18.9.1555","venue":"Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience"}

The results demonstrated that, under in vitro conditions, daptomycin and ceftaroline exhibited comparable activity relative to each other and greater activity than vancomycin, telavancin, oritavancin, dalbavancin, or tigecycline. This was true when assessed using established biofilms formed by the USA300 methicillin-resistant strain LAC and the USA200 methicillin-sensitive strain UAMS-1. Oxacillin exhibited greater activity against UAMS-1 than LAC, as would be expected, since LAC is an MRSA strain. However, the activity of oxacillin was less than that of daptomycin and ceftaroline even against UAMS-1. Among the lipoglycopeptides, telavancin exhibited the greatest overall activity. Specifically, telavancin exhibited greater activity than oritavancin or dalbavancin when tested against biofilms formed by LAC and was the only lipoglycopeptide capable of reducing the number of viable bacteria below the limit of detection. With biofilms formed by UAMS-1, telavancin and dalbavancin exhibited comparable activity relative to each other and greater activity than oritavancin. Importantly, ceftaroline was the only antibiotic that exhibited greater activity than vancomycin when tested in vivo in a murine model of catheter-associated biofilm formation. These results emphasize the need to consider antibiotics other than vancomycin, most notably, ceftaroline, for the treatment of biofilm-associated S. aureus infections, including by the matrix-based antibiotic delivery methods often employed for local antibiotic delivery in the treatment of these infections.","inCitations":["45eb6266834c508b7896799f8ccb07050ac09dc2","bdb43bf459cbe1ff99f43668937c54334aaefcb8","2d7c3657109fcb5a7ab4754e31a691c16ec3e180","230d6787b05c5b73cff47ee26e7187d27194c576","c4775d224fa8af0ba76a1083e8026866a881e80d","e79fcfa31d30a57a83e18ece5b992bdc156dfe80","3f8ef80d84ffb3623e18fbfbc72c66613ec9e831","6bb8107105e7117b75cf8c00956ea2444687ad00"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Evaluation of Antibiotics Active against Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus Based on Activity in an Established Biofilm.","doi":"10.1128/AAC.01251-16","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1128/AAC.01251-16","venue":"Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy"}

In patients with achalasia, it's known that gastric emptying time is delayed. In this study we aimed to evaluate the difference between the gastric emptying time before and after pneumatic balloon dilatation. Nine achalasia patients (7 female, mean age 51.5 +/- 13.1, range 36-71 year) that were diagnosed as clinically, radiologically and manometrically were enrolled into the study. In all patients, before and after pneumatic dilatation, gastric emptying time was measured with radionuclide method after eating a solid meal. In severely effected patients labeled egg was passed to stomach by a nasogastric tube. One hour after observing initial gastric activity, irradiation was detected dynamically. Radionuclide emptying time before (T1/2) dilatation was a mean of 301.9 +/- 64.7, and after dilatation 221.7 +/- 370.8 minute (p=0.018). As a result, elongation in gastric emptying time in patients with achalasia significantly decreases after effective pneumatic balloon dilatation.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"The effect of pneumatic balloon dilatation on gastric emptying in patients with achalasia.","doi":"","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"Hepato-gastroenterology"}

Four samples of stoichiometry FeSb1.84Te0.16 were prepared by a hot press method at temperatures of 200, 400, 500, and 600 oC. Te-doping enhances the dimensionless figure of merit (ZT) on FeSb2 via two mechanisms. First, a semiconductor to metal transition is induced, which enhances the value of the power factor at low-temperatures. Second, the thermal conductivity, which was already reduced in nanostructured FeSb2 samples, is further reduced by increased point defect scattering through the n type substitution of Sb site by Te atom. The combined effect results in a ZT = 0.022 at 100 K, an increase of 62% over the ZT value for the optimized Te-doped single crystal sample. Hall coefficient and electrical resistivity measurements reveal a decreased mobility and increased concentration of the carriers in the doped sample.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://arxiv.org/pdf/1303.3869v1.pdf"],"title":"Enhancing the Figure of Merit in Te-doped FeSb2 through nanostructuring","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

For eight patients, four non-growing and four growing, the pre- and post-treatment scans were superimposed. Fast voxel-based superimposition was performed, with registration at the anterior cranial base. This superimposition process took 10-15s. The fit of the cranial base superimposition was verified by qualitative visualization of the semi-transparent axial, sagittal, and coronal cross-sectional slices of all corresponding anatomical structures. Virtual 3D surface models of the skull were generated via threshold segmentation, and superimposition errors in the reoriented models and the results of treatment for the treated cases were evaluated by 3D surface distances on colour-coded maps. The superimposition error of the spatial reorientation and for growing and non-growing patients was <0.5mm, which is acceptable and clinically insignificant. The voxel-based superimposition method evaluated was reproducible in different clinical conditions, rapid, and applicable for research and clinical practice.","inCitations":["7b7a3c1a804b9800922fd62b5d1d3fd8bdbc16eb","f1eddd3441fec833fb1ac45eb31bbd457655cf22","cf60943e6fead394dc07b99db49b781e348f5bb3","cf2aa112ddb245195a935f0517ef9d010960b9b7","37f4284aca749da3fdaa179fae365474a174468c","26f8bec4e1b1a26c16bc5f43e77f42fb65395efa","707397f3b792cbf9feeb8e2f6ff3c690abcf5eaa","476d75b01dd8d62873a3e06346056c68ca7d0dfd","cddf7bd78e11d69086cbcd1d2a46d6ee2304e791","5a7d21fa200fd5856fa72979836a11992ed99f77","2d9bbf4097e8c9f724b53347e68a1a63dce7078d","d0e80c4f85b4657b0de602de21107de93df1b124","5d1538660f2e5d48ffb4aa32f280f306d027a938","a784c64024727af3dfaa817275cc8a3bedb09fc1","b73bdd66480bf859cd5be1450aa3abd6c15fa635","5d38384ec1ced30041639fadbdfbf7bba4caee83","9b2c1983469905217a7a2376b8f55eb714608941","181a194059d4301e6d0ef65aceffd3d5cd6fef53","a2ef3d3695f755aad9fded93da4952de1b37c791"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Fast three-dimensional superimposition of cone beam computed tomography for orthopaedics and orthognathic surgery evaluation.","doi":"10.1016/j.ijom.2015.04.001","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijom.2015.04.001","venue":"International journal of oral and maxillofacial surgery"}

Montgomery’s novel Anne of Green Gables has dominated Canadian children’s literature. In Canada, Anne is instantly recognizable in any medium; two red braids and a straw hat are usually enough to trigger the identification. As a national figure, she has been reincarnated in many different forms. But beyond the red hair, Anne is a character whose fictional life is firmly rooted in a particular space and time. Nineteenth-century Avonlea is the ground to Anne’s figure, and she is most clearly seen in this specific context. In this article, I will undertake three related activities. Firstly, I will explore some versions of Anne of Green Gables , drawing on the original novel and a number of contemporary reworkings, investigating the Anne of Green Gables universe in terms of different artistic renderings of time and space (using Bakhtin’s concept of the chronotope), and interrogating what happens to that universe as it is commercially expanded and exploited. Secondly, I will draw on a new novel, Christopher Paul Curtis’s Elijah of Buxton , a book entirely unconnected to the oeuvre of L.M. Montgomery yet profoundly related to important questions of national story, myth, and core identity. I will re-read Anne of Green Gables in the light of this challenging Canadian narrative, set in the same period, though in a very different social (and narrative) community. Thirdly (and simultaneously), I will introduce an element often missing in critical essays: the personal reader.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Anne of Green Gables, Elijah of Buxton, and Margaret of Newfoundland","doi":"10.7939/R3R49GP64","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.7939/R3R49GP64","venue":""}

Loss of GALE in humans results in a variant form of the metabolic disorder, galactosemia. Loss of GALE in yeast results in galactose-dependent growth arrest. Although the role of GALE in galactose metabolism has been recognized for decades, the precise relationship between GALE activity and galactose sensitivity has remained unclear. Here we have explored this relationship by asking the following. 1) Is GALE rate-limiting for galactose metabolism in yeast? 2) What is the relationship between GALE activity and galactose-dependent growth arrest in yeast? 3) What is the relationship between GALE activity and the abnormal accumulation of galactose metabolites in yeast? To answer these questions we engineered a strain of yeast in which GALE was doxycycline-repressible and studied these cells under conditions of intermediate GALE expression. Our results demonstrated a smooth linear relationship between galactose metabolism and GALE activity over a range from 0 to approximately 5% but a steep threshold relationship between growth rate in galactose and GALE activity over the same range. The relationship between abnormal accumulation of metabolites and GALE activity was also linear over the range from 0 to approximately 5%, suggesting that if the abnormal accumulation of metabolites underlies galactose-dependent growth-arrest in GALE-impaired yeast, either the impact of individual metabolites must be synergistic and/or the threshold of sensitivity must be very steep. Together these data reveal important points of similarity and contrast between the roles of GALE and galactose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase in galactose metabolism in yeast and provide a framework for future studies in mammalian systems.","inCitations":["3fc6014131101b551f13328c7e15e8e81138fb73","a35860ced980d7769992378ec926b672c186c75e","5e25e35bf1447c750d3cb0be34d4429583f1d218","4e2b62c9bed2f4c0cb2d9540179c65c66c03cf4a","97e283e5d4a38df34c7959a002ee07dc5f179e88","41ba27bb6e0fefced33e678112120310f487ed33","6da9809dd32441b0a43ec50f4c7be77af1711c08","60f316331c315978a14c19694f53015997b92d2a","35e62df1d5acedb596894d84fb59a680bacd8337","4e1235a0b5b9708121c725a58041425b68f9522c","c60512d9b8dfc6aa1d72b1514a09aa7edcbd2c75","5bbdbd24a81ab5c3715d9b901d227ce840d37720"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Relationship between UDP-galactose 4'-epimerase activity and galactose sensitivity in yeast.","doi":"10.1074/jbc.M600778200","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M600778200","venue":"The Journal of biological chemistry"}

Areas of the two human implants ingrown with fibrous tissue were characterized radiographically by a radiopaque line surrounding, but separated from, the implant surface. Resorptive bone modeling was observed with both implant types, particularly proximally. New bone formation and hypertrophy typically occur at regions of proximity to or contact with the endosteal cortex and, in the case of proximally porous coated implants, at the junction of the porous and smooth implant surfaces. The smooth-surfaced distal region of proximally coated implants is typically surrounded by a thin shell of bone that is separated from the implant surface. Overall, resorptive and formative bony change appears more exaggerated in the canine, but the radiographic and histologic pictures of canine and human implants bear resemblances.","inCitations":["85f82f4dc8282eccbe3623b7929825ef69444916","2684322b46300fcefa0a9b0ed6f58992a185e070","d0764c043f00ee44748cd40f8c521bc7a4c77b30","2607ef4caa8866770d75f6ce507b9e93bdea9efe"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Histological Comparison of Biological Fixation and Bone Modeling with Canine and Human Porous-Coated Hip Prostheses","doi":"10.1520/STP25231S","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1520/STP25231S","venue":""}

The aims of this thesis were to use a variety of analytical techniques to analyse both primary and blended amine solvents from pilot plants in the UK and North West Europe. The results from the analyses were correlated in an effort to present a comprehensive overview of solvent behaviour at this scale. \nThe analytical methods used were Gas Chromatography Mass Spectroscopy (GC-MS), Gas Chromatography Flame Ionisation Detection (GC-FID), Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectroscopy (ICPMS), Ion Chromatography (IC), and 13C Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. The corrosive effects of the solvents were investigated using electrochemical testing. \nThe data from GC-MS and GC-FID was correlated in order to quantify the major degradation products found in amine solvents. ICPMS was used to quantify the metals in the solvents and was correlated with IC data. The use of 13C NMR spectroscopy had previously been used to monitor the speciation of amines in solvent systems, but had not been correlated to any other data. This work used 13C NMR spectroscopy to quantify the amine species in the solvent and correlated this data to GC-MS results. From the electrochemical testing it was shown that corrosion only increases when oxygen is present in the system but is negligible at low temperatures (40°C). The use of continuous cationic exchange resins to remove metals was shown to be an effective method of mitigating degradation in primary amine solvents. It was also shown that 13C NMR spectroscopy can be used for the rapid analysis of the extent of degradation and can be used in conjunction with other analytical methods to monitor amine degradation.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Characterisation of degraded solvents from the amine scrubbing process","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Thermoelectric power, conductivity, Hall and magnetic susceptibility measurements have been made on five single crystals of compositions ranging from NiS-NiS1.02 in the temperature range 82-300 K. The results suggest that below TN the Ni 3d states are essentially localized or form a narrow band. The predominant mechanism of conduction is by holes in a wide band. The discontinuity in conductivity at TN is most likely due primarily to a change in mobility. Impurity band conduction occurs at low temperatures. The susceptibility curves have a markedly different shape from that normally expected for an antiferromagnet. This results from the first order character of the phase transition at TN.","inCitations":["02da825eb05cdeed82c67206c95ca849b6653c3e"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Metal-semiconductor transition in single crystal hexagonal nickel sulphide","doi":"10.1088/0022-3719/4/5/010","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1088/0022-3719%2F4%2F5%2F010","venue":""}

To investigate the metadynamic recrystallization behavior, a range of inter-pass delay times (5–60 s) was employed. These tests simulated flat rolling to investigate how softening behaviors respond to controlled parameters, such as deformation temperature, strain rate, and delay times. These data allowed the parameters for the hot rolling process to be optimized. The dynamic softening at each pass and the effect of metadynamic recrystallization on flow properties and microstructural evolution were analyzed in detail. An offset yield strength of 0.2% was employed to calculate the softening fraction undergoing metadynamic recrystallization. A kinetic model was developed to describe the metadynamic recrystallization behaviors of the hot-deformed 5754 aluminum alloy. Furthermore, the time constant for 50% recrystallization was expressed as functions related to the temperature and the strain rate. The experimental and calculated results were found to be in close agreement, which verified the developed model.","inCitations":["809f73847c8475be760c20e8a36af3e97fadb2a6","d948a08770e1c9ab1ed1d2dcda6746a87fa3a3fd"],"pdfUrls":["https://res.mdpi.com/metals/metals-07-00107/article_deploy/metals-07-00107-v2.pdf?attachment=1&filename=","http://www.mdpi.com/2075-4701/7/4/107/pdf","https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/201703.0126/v1/download"],"title":"An Investigation on the Softening Mechanism of 5754 Aluminum Alloy during Multistage Hot Deformation","doi":"10.3390/met7040107","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.3390/met7040107","venue":""}

In the study by Groenendijk et al [1], the authors performed targeted sequencing of pretreatment tumors from a cohort of patients with muscle-invasive and metastatic urothelial carcinoma (including N2–3 and M1 disease) treated with a variety of platinum-based regimens, including both cisplatin and carboplatin. They reported an association between ERBB2 mutational status and neoadjuvant chemotherapy response. The findings in this heterogeneous cohort are provocative and deserve additional exploration, including validation in an independent cohort and investigation into the potential mechanism by which ERBB2 mutations contribute to chemosensitivity. However, in contrast to Van Allen et al [2], Groenendijk et al broadly conclude from their data that ERCC2 mutations are not associated with ‘‘platinum’’ sensitivity [1]. In their extreme-response cohort, germline and tumor sequencing identified eight patients with somatic ERCC2 mutations. Two of these patients were described as nonresponders, and the authors were able to show the presence of the mutation in the residual tumor (Fig. 1 of Groenendijk et al [1]). However, the authors do not mention that these two nonresponding patients received carboplatinrather than cisplatin-based therapy (Supplementary Table 4 of Groenendijk et al [1]). In contrast, the other six ERCC2mutant patients with complete responses were all treated with cisplatin-based combinations. The use of neoadjuvant carboplatin-based chemotherapy is not a standard approach (reviewed by Apolo et al [3]). Multiple studies suggest that carboplatin is an inferior agent in urothelial carcinoma, and in vitro evidence shows that the potency differs dramatically between cisplatin and carboplatin [4,5]. Although the two patients who received carboplatin-based treatment were described as nonresponders, in fact, all six patients with ERCC2 mutations in the extreme-response cohort treated with cisplatin-based combinations had a pathologic complete response. When restricting the extreme-response cohort to cisplatin-treated patients (matching patients in the study by Van Allen [2]), the presence of somatic ERCC2 mutations are statistically enriched in complete responders (6 of 16 responders and 0 of 14 nonresponders, excluding 2 carboplatin-treated patients; p = 0.0185, Fisher exact test). Four other patients with somatic ERCC2 mutations treated with cisplatin-based combinations showed partial responses to cisplatin-based chemotherapy, although no detailed treatment was provided regarding clinical factors. The use of neoadjuvant complete responders in Van Allen et al [2] to identify mediators of cisplatin sensitivity does not imply that complete response is the expected outcome in all cases with somatic ERCC2 mutation but rather that ERCC2 mutation should, in principle, significantly enrich for response overall, which is what was observed in both data sets. Based on the data presented by Groenendijk et al [1], we conclude that these results actually support the hypothesis that somatic ERCC2 mutations enrich for response to neoadjuvant cisplatin-based chemotherapy.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Re: Floris H.

DNA sequence analysis of delta-globin gene identified two \"novel\" mutations in the coding regions of the gene; the cd11 (GTC-->GGC) resulting in the substitution of valine for glycine (:HbA2-Pylos) and the cd85(TTT-->TCT) resulting in the substitution of phenylalanine for serine (:HbA2-Etolia).

Oswald","ids":["71941623"]}],"journalName":"","paperAbstract":"Feedback control of photosynthesis by carbon metabolites has long been recognised but the underlying cellular mechanisms that regulate this process remain unclear. As part of this thesis project it was demonstrated that in an Arabidopsis cell culture a block in photosynthetic electron flux prevents the increase in transcript levels of chlorophyll a/b binding protein (CAB) and the small subunit of Rubisco (RBCS) that typically occurs when intracellular sugar levels are depleted. In contrast, the expression of the nitrate reductase (NR) gene, which is induced by sugars, was not changed. These findings were confirmed in planta using Arabidopsis carrying the firefly luciferase reporter gene (LUC) fused to the plastocyanin (PC) and CAB2 photosynthetic gene promoters. Transcription from both promoters increased upon carbohydrate deprivation. Blocking photosynthetic electron transport with 3-(3',4'-dichlorophenyl)-1,1'-dimethylurea (DCMU) prevented this increase in transcription. This work led to the conclusion that plastid derived redox signalling can over-ride the sugar regulated expression of nuclear encoded photosynthetic genes. In the sugar response mutant sun6 (sucrose uncoupled) PC-LUC transcription actually increased in response to exogenous sucrose rather than decreasing as in the wild type. Interestingly, plastid derived redox signals do not influence this defective pattern of sugar regulated gene expression in the sun6 mutant. A model, which invokes a positive inducer originating from the photosynthetic electron transport chain, was proposed to explain the nature of the plastid-derived signal. Previous studies in algal systems have shown that light and temperature are critical regulators of plastid redox state. When the redox state of the photosynthetic electron transport chain in the Arabidopsis culture was altered by changing temperature and light conditions differential effects were observed in carbon starved and carbon supplied cells. These results confirm that various environmental parameters can affect the plastid redox state and consequently nuclear gene expression in higher plants. Over the last few years a growing number of plant 14-3-3 binding proteins, including DNA binding proteins and key proteins of carbon metabolism, have been identified. The binding of these proteins to 14-3-3 proteins affects their phosphorylation state and consequently cellular activity. Sugar deprivation has recently been shown to have a dramatic effect on 14-3-3 binding protein abundance in the same cell culture that was used in this thesis work. However, the plastid redox signal as identified in this thesis work did not result in an altered regulation of 14-3-3 binding proteins by sugars, providing evidence that at least this proposed part of the sugar signalling pathway is not regulated by the redox state of the plastid.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://theses.gla.ac.uk/72686/1/10646960.pdf"],"title":"Plastid redox state and sugars as interactive regulators of nuclear photosynthetic gene expression","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Strength of treated fiber decreased by only 1.17%, because only surfacial nitrile groups of acrylic fibers were hydrolyzed by E.coli BL21(DE3)/pET-Nit.","inCitations":["cc385e0e212c0f4f40a4673aec58c9a380a129e3","b02247b56708965b8da4efbf3585d75af5aae1a3"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Surface Modification of Acrylonitrile Fibers and Membrane by Nitrilase from Escherichia Coli BL21 (DE3)/pET-Nit","doi":"10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMR.175-176.651","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.4028/www.scientific.net%2FAMR.175-176.651","venue":""}

Angiogenesis involving extensive endothelial cell migration is a critical component of vessel formation in the embryonic testis but vasculogenic mechanisms appear to play a prominent role in ovarian vascularisation. Vasculature has a strong influence on the formation of ovarian structures, and the early developmental processes of ovigerous cord formation, primordial follicle assembly and follicle activation are all initiated in regions of the ovary that are in close association with the highly vascular medulla. The principal angiogenic factor, vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA), has an important role in both endothelial cell differentiation and vascular pattern development. Expression of VEGFA has been localised to ovigerous cords and follicles in developing ovaries and an increased expression of pro-angiogenic Vegfa isoform mRNA in relation to anti-angiogenic isoform mRNA occurs at the same time-point as the peak of primordial follicle assembly in perinatal rats. Elucidation of specific genes that affect vascular development within the ovary may be critical for determining not only the normal mechanisms of ovarian morphogenesis, but also for understanding certain ovarian reproductive disorders.","inCitations":["1fdfce47d7f2384c9a92303893340bb035134044","65303e25580ffa757b392061fd78983496f85bf5","16336577642f336318e4940426fe06ee9ce6c389","83469d4f5ee8d0227504c8a4fafdf55e81cb13ba","938abb88b972398d0e5bc3e4ee97b69dba3e4acb","9df5adc8d4c7d60778978e7cfd7c5fe9d6bc7a96","7aaad975f238b5b400b721e9f1e1fbfb03f3abfa","54f8851fe04a84b004104aecdc44e9b642d4eab8","64e08933be1411fdc119bf70ae15d723695b6180"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Vascular contributions to early ovarian development: potential roles of VEGFA isoforms.","doi":"10.1071/RD12134","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1071/RD12134","venue":"Reproduction, fertility, and development"}

Being able to image coherent spin-wave transport is crucial for developing interference-based spin-wave devices. We introduce a platform for probing coherent spin waves based on magnetic resonance imaging with electron spins in diamond. Focusing on a thin-film magnetic insulator, we quantify spin-wave amplitudes, visualize the dispersion, and demonstrate time-domain measurements of spin-wave packets. We use our platform to study spin-wave interference, revealing uni-directional, autofocused spin-wave patterns with frequencycontrolled numerical apertures. A theoretical analysis explains the patterns in terms of chiral spinwave excitation and stray-field coupling to the sensor spins. These results pave the way for probing spin waves in atomically thin magnets, even when embedded between opaque materials. 1 ar X iv :2 00 4. 07 74 6v 1 [ co nd -m at .m es -h al l] 1 6 A pr 2 02 0 Introduction Over the last few decades, the desire to understand and control spin transport, and to use it in information technology, has invigorated the field of spintronics. A central goal of the field is to provide information processing based on the spin of the electron instead of its charge, and thereby avoid the heating associated with charge currents. As heating is currently the main obstacle for increasing computational speed, spin-based information processing may provide the next transformative change in information technology. Promising signal carriers for low-dissipation information transport are spin waves [1, 2] the collective spin excitations of magnetic materials. Spin waves exist even in electrically insulating magnets, where they are able to propagate inherently free of the dissipative motion of charge. They can have nanometer wavelengths and gigahertz frequencies well suited for chip-scale device technologies and interference-based spin-wave logic circuits [2]. Consequently, a growing research field focuses on spin-wave devices such as interconnects, interferometers, transistors, amplifiers, and spin-torque oscillators [3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. Being able to image coherent spin waves in thin-film magnets is crucial for developing spinwave device technology. In recent years, several advanced techniques for imaging coherent spin waves have been developed, such as time-resolved scanning transmission x-ray microscopy (TRSTXM) [8], Brillouin light scattering (BLS) [9], and Kerr microscopy [10], which rely on a spindependent optical response of a magnetic material. Here we introduce a new method, based on phase-sensitive magnetic resonance imaging of the microwave magnetic fields generated by a spin wave using electronic sensor spins in a diamond chip (Fig. 1A). This approach combines an ability to detect low magnetic fields with a sensitivity to their chirality, making it well suited for spin-wave imaging in magnetic thin films. We use this approach to study spin-wave transport in a thin-film magnetic insulator, revealing uni-directional excitation of spin waves that autofocus, interfere, and produce magnetic stray fields with a chirality that matches that of the natural precession of the sensor spins. We perform a theoretical analysis of the chiral spin-wave excitation and stray-field coupling to the sensor spins and show that it accurately describes the observed spatial spin-wave maps. We detect the magnetic fields generated by spin waves using electron spins associated with nitrogen-vacancy (NV) lattice defects in diamond [11]. These spins can be initialized and read out optically, and manipulated with high fidelity via microwave excitation. Over the last decade, NV magnetometry has emerged as a powerful platform for probing static and dynamic magnetic phenomena in condensed matter systems [12]. Key is an NV-sample distance tunable between 10-1000 nm that is well matched with the length scales of spin textures such as magnetic domain walls, cycloids, vortices, and skyrmions [13, 14, 15], as well as those of dynamic phenomena such as spin waves [16, 17, 18, 19, 20]. Recent experiments demonstrated that NV magnetometry has the sensitivity required for imaging the static magnetization of monolayer van-der-Waals magnets [21]. Here, we develop NV-based magnetic resonance imaging into a platform for studying coherent spin waves via the gigahertz magnetic fields they generate. Results Our imaging platform consists of a diamond chip hosting a dense layer of shallowly implanted NV spins. We position this chip onto a thin film of yttrium iron garnet (YIG) a ferrimagnetic","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.07746v1.pdf"],"title":"Magnetic resonance imaging of spin-wave transport and interference in a magnetic insulator","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

It is therefore essential to design an algorithm capable of reliable robot’s position calculation and, at the same time, suitable for implementation in embedded devices. This contribution describes a modified point-to-point Scan Matching algorithm based on cross-correlation, which was first introduced in our previous study. The newly developed algorithm running in a single thread is implemented in C language and decreases the computational complexity, i.e. time needed for calculation of the robot’s position, by as much as 20% compared to the original solution implemented in C#. LiDAR sensor was used to test the algorithm.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Scan Matching Cross-Correlation-Based Localization Algorithm: Embedded Systems Implementation Perspective","doi":"10.1016/j.ifacol.2018.07.135","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ifacol.2018.07.135","venue":""}

Measuring changes of stable isotope ratios (e.g. (13)C/(12)C, (2)H/(1)H, (15)N/(14)N) in individual organic compounds by compound-specific isotope analysis (CSIA) makes it possible to identify degradation pathways without the explicit need to quantify pollutant concentration dynamics. The so-called isotope fractionation observed in an organic pollutant is related to isotope effects of (bio)chemical reactions and enables one to characterize pollutant degradation even if multiple processes take place simultaneously. Here, we illustrate some principles of CSIA using benzotriazole, a frequently observed aquatic micropollutant, as example. We show subsequently how the combined C and N isotope fractionation analysis of nitroaromatic compounds reveals kinetics and mechanisms of reductive and oxidative reactions as well as their (bio)degradation pathways in the environment.","inCitations":["8ec5b0bc15a9563712ddbf2b79009ba48c203757","913ee895f67c979e03b0d746a14a9bd1fadeb7bb","5e679704067afee71f7552fa2cddcc927220bec9"],"pdfUrls":["https://www.dora.lib4ri.ch/eawag/islandora/object/eawag:8025/datastream/PDF/view"],"title":"Isotope Effects as New Proxies for Organic Pollutant Transformation.","doi":"10.2533/chimia.2014.788","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.2533/chimia.2014.788","venue":"Chimia"}

In source detection and localization problems, similar incoherent broadband MFP techniques have been shown to be inferior to coherent MFP techniques. Coherent MFP exploits source spectrum information when this is available, yielding more robust detection and localization results. This experience suggests that there is potential to improve geoacoustic inversion by MFP using a coherent algorithm. This work assesses that potential through a comparison of inversion results from incoherent and coherent methods, evaluating performance and cost.
