Due to the restrictive geometry of the transition state, diffusion of Ne and Ar is energy-activated at room temperature, but the diffusion of He is limited by entropy. The small mass of He suggests that a quantum TST must be employed. Path integral Monte Carlo is used to perform the relevant sampling, and quantum and classical diffusivities are compared. Comparison reveals a competition between tunneling and diffraction of the quantum mechanical He atom. A pairwise centroid pseudopotential is developed for the guest−host atom pair, and the effective potential energy and TST rate are compared with that of direct quantum TST.","inCitations":["1971ffa64e559962e9a984f70de6eccd06259a4d"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Classical And Quantum Transition State Theory For The Diffusion Of Helium In Silica Sodalite","doi":"10.1021/jp9620678","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1021/jp9620678","venue":""}

Mentoring is a ‘‘voluntary, intense, committed, extended, dynamic, interactive, supportive, trusting relationship between two people, one experienced, and the other a newcomer, characterized by mutuality.’’ In the workplace, however, mentors are not easily identified; this is especially true for clinician-scientists who lead a ‘‘double-life.’’ Although there is little empirical evidence in support of its efficacy, most of the literature supports the mentoring process.

However, users of these portals often get access to data only through limited, pre-defined queries based on a strict set of criteria and event trajectories. Desirable capabilities, such as spatial-temporal analysis, efficient satellite data retrieval, and ad-hoc queries on trajectory data, are not available in these information systems and data archives. In this paper, we describe our current work on and progress in the development of a sophisticated moving objects database infrastructure designed primarily to allow ad-hoc querying of dynamic atmospheric events (e.g., hurricanes and storm systems) and the efficient retrieval of satellite (e.g, QuikSCAT, TRMM) measurements. In particular, we describe our progress in the integration of tropical cyclone event data and satellite measurements from different sources into a single moving objects database system for scientific users to perform ad-hoc queries and sophisticated spatiotemporal analysis. Moreover, we describe how a user can remotely connect her personal analysis software to the database system to perform flexible querying on tropical cyclone best track data and retrieve the associated satellite measurements. Finally, we show how complex objects like hurricane trajectories and massive satellite sensor trajectories with measurements can be effectively stored and handled in a database context using our novel iBLOB (Intelligent Binary Large Objects) concept and data structure.","inCitations":["1d26d7a05c3bde97804167f7a583f680d8450d81","f0df9e8c9cf7b18d6923c3e67b4fed5be17e00c8","3f9d414adb4d5e1a5d646e8c063fb5893f269ae4"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.cise.ufl.edu/~mschneid/Research/papers/SHACLV11ESTF.pdf","https://esto.gsfc.nasa.gov/conferences/estf2011/presentations/Schneider_ESTF2011.pdf"],"title":"A Moving Objects Database Infrastructure for Hurricane Research : Data Integration and Complex Object Management","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Homozygozity for UGT1A1*28 increases the risk for severe neutropenia, the most common dose-limiting toxicity (DLT). However, its occurrence remains fairly unpredictable. We are conducting a phase I dose-escalation study in advanced solid tumor patients where dosing is given according to the UGT1A1*28 genotype (Innocenti, ASCO 2007). In the context of this study, we aimed to evaluate whether the occurrence of neutropenia might be due to hitherto undiscovered drug-drug interactions. Methods: Patients (n=33, 26 males) were treated with 700-850 mg (flat dosing) of q3w irinotecan. DLT at cycle 1 was defined as grade (G)4 neutropenia lasting ≥4 days, G≥3 neutropenia on a scheduled treatment day, G≥3 febrile neutropenia, G4 anemia or thrombocytopenia, or G≥3 nonhematological toxicity. Patient charts were reviewed to obtain concurrent medications. Pharmacokinetic analysis of irinotecan and SN-38 was performed at cycle 1.

To study surface phenomena the ultimate and variable (in the range of 1–5 ML) surface sensitivity is needed. Here we discuss possibilities to improve surface sensitivity of XPH by the example of Bi2Se3 (1 1 1) surface where different coordinations of the same kind of atoms are present in different layers. To reach ultimate surface sensitivity we used both lower electron kinetic energy and partial analysis of hologram related to grazing angle photoemission. Using calculations of diffraction patterns based on EDAC code and reverse reconstruction of the real space within SPEA-MEM formalism we evaluate the contribution of each atomic layer into diffraction pattern and found that the surface relaxation could be directly visualised at the kinetic energy less than 100 eV, whereas the contribution of the second quintuple layer can be vanished at 200 eV or below. The same effect can be achieved by partial analysis of hologram at grazing detection angles more than 55° to the surface normal. This approach enables broader practical applications of the XPH to various materials in applied surface science.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Enhanced surface sensitivity of X-ray photoelectron holography through the example of Bi2Te3(1 1 1) surface","doi":"10.1016/j.apsusc.2019.144531","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apsusc.2019.144531","venue":""}

Although molecular mass has long been determined with atomic precision, a direct and precise determination of molecular charge remains an outstanding challenge. Here we report high-precision (<1e) measurements of the electrical charge of molecules such as nucleic acids, and globular and disordered proteins in solution. The measurement is based on parallel external field-free trapping of single macromolecules, permits the estimation of a dielectric coefficient of the molecular interior and can be performed in real time. Further, we demonstrate the direct detection of single amino acid substitution and chemical modifications in proteins. As the electrical charge of a macromolecule strongly depends on its three-dimensional conformation, this kind of high-precision electrometry offers an approach to probe the structure, fluctuations and interactions of a single molecule in solution.","inCitations":["3d6997c57b993e3eb98193ed7ffd4ceb7c168517","a5b1cea1722337fc6b5f90fe8636ca6ce8fb9c61","4ab8344666cf0627c7acaf1888511bd8459bbe2a","051ba960fd2bb0d4a55f78bdc20f53d87acef3cb","d7645da98c4c7be7222966c04316d7b0a197afa2","263cd499bb7c543bd7d43f01fe4d8b30dbe40e83","3eca0e6612b70609d4b8991603ff4a077a4a66a1","def145639fa5690d1cd8dcdee25ea405bdaf481b","bc530043280eafe882b321f27fa9493bc7c1abd1"],"pdfUrls":["https://www.bioc.uzh.ch/schuler/assets/ruggeri17krishnan.pdf"],"title":"Single-molecule electrometry.","doi":"10.1038/nnano.2017.26","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1038/nnano.2017.26","venue":"Nature nanotechnology"}

Zhu continues the tradition of the Northern Song, and even though the thinkers of the Northern Song are the wellspring for the next six hundred years of Song-Ming learning, they are extremely hard to understand. The chapters on Zhu Xi in Major Schools of Song and Yuan Confucians were poorly done as well, not because his writings are hard to distinguish. Zhu Xi was not wrong to say that the metaphysical reality of the way is reason that makes the cosmos what it is and that reason is unitary. Mencius uses compassion as his example, and this compassion belongs to mind, but this mind is not material, not physical. In the Southern Song, the first person to digest the Northern Song learning was Hu Wufeng.

The objective of this cross-sectional study was to compare the relative importance of various determinants of CCU among sexually experienced undergraduates in mainland China so as to assess and subsequently to suggest ways to eliminate inequities in its use. From September 10, 2018, to January 9, 2019, an anonymous self-administered online questionnaire was voluntarily completed by 12,750 participants distributed across 30 provinces in mainland China (except for Tibet). The present analysis was restricted to 2054 sexually experienced undergraduates. Pearson’s chi-square test and Logistic regression models were chosen to analyze the factors associated with CCU. The overall rate of CCU was 61.3% [95% confidence interval (CI) = 59.2–63.4%]. CCU was inequitably distributed since enabling factors exerted greater effects than predisposing and need variables. Compared with heterosexual men, heterosexual women [adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 0.78, 95% confidence interval (CI):0.64–0.96)], non-heterosexuals men (AOR = 0.64, 95% CI:0.45–0.92) and women (AOR = 0.68, 95% CI:0.47–0.99) were less prone to using condoms consistently. Those with more resources [i.e., higher levels of self- efficacy for condom use (AOR = 2.86, 95% CI:2.35–3.49) and being knowledgeable of the national AIDS policy (AOR = 1.50, 95% CI:1.23–1.82)], and those with lower need for condoms [i.e., late initiation of sexual activity (AOR = 1.34, 95% CI:1.09–1.64) and single sexual partner (AOR = 1.68,95% CI:1.21–2.33)] were more likely to be consistent condom users. In order to increase consistency of condom use and simultaneously reduce the remaining inequities, a comprehensive intervention measure should be taken to target heterosexual women, non-heterosexual men and women, and those with higher need for condoms, improve their condom use self- efficacy and raise their awareness of the national AIDS policy.","inCitations":["e28fac410b937dbfd11ecdf1115ece330e237776","a7a428fd8d04014cd248b46a1dc40eea31949303"],"pdfUrls":["https://static-content.springer.com/openpeerreview/art:10.1186%2Fs12889-019-7435-4/12889_2019_7435_AuthorComment_V2.pdf","https://static-content.springer.com/openpeerreview/art:10.1186%2Fs12889-019-7435-4/12889_2019_7435_AuthorComment_V1.pdf","https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s12889-019-7435-4"],"title":"Inequities in consistent condom use among sexually experienced undergraduates in mainland China: implications for planning interventions","doi":"10.1186/s12889-019-7435-4","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-019-7435-4","venue":"BMC Public Health"}

Methods One hundred randomly selected male workers exposed to manganese were compared with 100 male referents (matched for age) from similar process industries in a cross-sectional design. Results The geometric mean of the exposed workers' urinary manganese concentration was 0.9 (range 0.1126.3) nmol/mmol creatinine (Cr) versus 0.4 (range 0.1-13.1) nmol/mmol Cr for the referents. The mean duration of exposure to manganese was 20.0 (range 2. 1 4-1 .0) years. The geometric mean of the prolactin serum concentration was higher for the exposed subjects than for the referents (229 versus 197 mIE/1, P=0.06). Serum prolactin was associated with current exposure to \"soluble inhalable manganese\", duration of exposure, and smoking habits. The subjects with the longest duration of exposure to manganese or the highest current exposure to \"soluble inhalable manganese\" had a statistically significantly higher serum prolactin concentration than the referents. The smokers had a lower serum prolactin concentration than the nonsmokers. The concentrations of the measured immunologie markers were similar in the groups. Conclusions The study indicates that manganese exposure can increase the serum prolactin concentration. Both duration and current level of exposure are related to the slight increase, which also appears to be modified by current smoking habits. The serum prolactin concentrations were generally within the reference limits of the laboratory and thus not suitable as an exposure marker at these exposure levels.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Endocrine and immunologie markers in manganese alloy production","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

The results obtained by the instrument are whether the participant has a safe or insecure attachment. The result of the study showed signs of insecure attachment in three out of six adolescents. The conclusion is that adolescents who show symptoms of sleep problems may have an insecure attachment. It is a knowledge that can be used in the treatment of adolescents in primary care, in psychiatric and psychotherapeutic treatment. The knowledge can also be used in child health care to work at an early stage with focusing on the attachment between children and parents or other caregivers.

We used ferrets, in which one lobe of lung was perfused with venous blood at constant flow rate in vivo and isolated lungs perfused with blood at constant flow in both ferrets and normal and chronically hypoxic (three weeks in 10% O2) rats. Almitrine caused constriction of the relaxed vessels of normoxic lung. During hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction, when pulmonary artery pressure (Ppa) was raised, almitrine had a dual action; it caused further constriction followed by dilatation over a wide dose range (0.7-118 micrograms X kg-1 in ferrets). Similar effects were seen in normal and chronically hypoxic rats; the latter have narrowed muscularized arterioles like patients with chronic obstructive airways disease. Almitrine caused a larger rise in Ppa in normoxic than hypoxic rat lungs (7.9 instead of 1.7 mmHg; p less than 0.001) and dilatation followed constriction in the latter. Verapamil reduced both the constrictor action of almitrine and hypoxic vasoconstriction and there was a strong correlation between the effect of the two stimuli before and after verapamil (r = 0.9). Attempts to identify a substance which might cause the dilator action of almitrine were unsuccessful.","inCitations":["5a26390bc9019f7f8ad11383c77566e82e79c069","b0f50cb215fad75db15ba4f1930be6e0e52c5aeb","31efc18e09397b6d6e83967735e372f49dfa1936","28017b14fdaed34faa57ce4e26e1421d9b985f44","c79655b84a7964e6d898dd5edde20f6897f15a26","4d56213c5211a6f151b8b83afa94164f1287f7e2","0dec28a6aa9f33efa98b19e34befdbde17ea3c26","db0326eaeb016cd99927462cacceb4db612c6c22","c9d4c5301deb5ad893165b7f2cfbefca6ff1085f","d265987439a047c1f2d4a0da4d8d9d19bf1554da","85a7cf0169d9d731abaeaeac08ae31ef9875a738"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Action of almitrine on the pulmonary vasculature in ferrets and rats.","doi":"","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"Bulletin europeen de physiopathologie respiratoire"}

Methods The levels of TAC, SOD, GSH Px and NO in serum, brain, heart, liver and kidney were measured by biochemical methods. The expressions of IL 6 and iNOS mRNA in blood and organs were detected by RT PCR(18 months rats as aged group and 2 months rats as control group). Results The levels of TAC, SOD, GSH Px in serum and organs were significantly lower in the aged group than those in the control group. The production of NO and the [xxk1] expressions of IL 6, iNOS mRNA were higher than those in the control group. The higher expressions of IL 6, iNOS mRNA were negatively correlated with the levels of TAC in the aged group. Conclusion The TAC level is significantly lower in the aged rats, which is correlated with the higher expression of IL 6, iNOS mRNA. It has been demonstrated that there are high oxygen stress and inflammatory response in old rats, which may cause the autodamage of the tissues. It also implies that antioxidant therapy will enhance the level of TAC and downregulate the oxygen stress and inflammatory response.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Correlative study of total antioxidant capacity with IL-6 and iNOS mRNA expressions in aged rats","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Tanning industry in India stands among the five top exports oriented industries. The unplanned growth of the leather industry, inadequate knowledge and inexperience in environment pollution management has caused several pollution problems which are yet to be solved at the desired level. In the present study a sincere attempt is made to cover all the important aspects relating to environmental pollution problems associated with this industry. In the present study, results have demonstrated that mostly all the stages of leather processing, individually and collectively have an impact on the environment.

Post-natally acquired CMV is a less common cause of disease and mortality, and only in preterm infants or immunocompromised children. Here we sought to describe CMV as a direct or secondary contributor to childhood mortality in Australia.\n\n\nMETHOD\nWe searched national mortality data sets between1999 and 2011 for cases <15 years with CMV recorded as an underlying or contributing cause of death.\n\n\nRESULTS\nEighty-three CMV-associated deaths in children <15 years were identified (0.2 cases per 100 000 <15 years; 95% confidence interval 0.16-0.24). Childhood deaths associated with CMV were evenly distributed between males and females, and the majority (n = 57; 68%) occurred in children less than 12 months of age, with 22 cases <1 month of age. Over the 13-year study period, the mortality rate remained stable and CMV resulted in an estimated age-adjusted 5925 years of potential life lost.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nCMV makes a small but important contribution to childhood mortality in Australia. Most CMV-related deaths occurred in infants <12 months of age. These infant deaths may be an indirect marker of the burden of severe intrauterine CMV disease given the natural history of this infection.","inCitations":["9b8c404e2a42401584f2cc427859ba0b1f8ae20d","7117440f798e67e7bc6cea1d5971b9a4b14fb2b1","1d2cf82085b4089b91124bada2ded199d44308e3","1457e35b06d9c30f6f48fa5774b004b7483fb2c2"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Cytomegalovirus-related childhood mortality in Australia 1999-2011.","doi":"10.1111/jpc.12896","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1111/jpc.12896","venue":"Journal of paediatrics and child health"}

The dark-red, tubular flowers of these irises are nectarless but provide protective shelters (i.e. a non-nutritive form of reward) primarily to male solitary bees (Apidae, Eucerini) that pollinate the flowers while looking for a shelter. An earlier study on orchids suggested that species pollinated predominantly by male solitary bees produce significantly larger amounts and larger numbers of different n-alkenes (unsaturated cuticular hydrocarbons). Whether or not this also applies to the Oncocyclus irises and whether pollinators are attracted by specific colours or scents of these flowers is unknown.\n\n\nMETHODS\nUsing Iris atropurpurea, recording of pollinator preferences for shelters with different spatial parameters was combined with analyses of floral colours (by spectrophotometry) and scents (by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry) to test the hypotheses that (a) pollinators significantly prefer floral tunnels facing the rising sun (floral heat-reward hypothesis), and that (b) flowers pollinated predominantly by male solitary bees produce significantly larger amounts and larger numbers of unsaturated cuticular hydrocarbons (n-alkenes) in their floral scent (preadaptation to sexual-deception hypothesis).\n\n\nKEY RESULTS\nMale bees do not significantly prefer shelters facing the rising sun or with the presence of high absolute/relative amounts and numbers of n-alkenes in the floral scent.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe results suggest that the flowers of I. atropurpurea probably evolved by pollinator-mediated selection acting primarily on floral colours to mimic large achromatic ('bee-black') protective shelters used preferentially by male solitary bees, and that pollinator visits are presumably not the result of an odour-based sexual stimulation or motivated by an increased morning floral heat reward in tunnels facing the rising sun.","inCitations":["69394ae00e6b9dd2adb048bc3ddc88e2cdbf673e","ef3e5f3a92d9e386e34fc1a8986238bea1af58d6","6a6bdcbb8c2657ddd4187474a4d8309386dcec48","ec45c5193504ca791a05df6696031c94b6406c5d","53ae10e9d0b7805cde3ca8a74a2390cad78cd87a","c835b3ee21f500b19bad434c3f195443de573ab3","1123a483184eff66b1203a972b00df286a114bb5","b218c6a10938c3ebd7a0d90db08d625cf474eb80","5fb699ffab8886e7d5443b4aba664b899043de99","52d78157859d4f10d00991be07dcf6dd444c92ac","cf398b7d336c591ab7157d7b56c00d21aae89cda","3f8e878848f45f4f0a8daf53719ad8e93e404834","10898e3650b3cbbdd448e0139f34025b7d7d26d6","f5869b910ed8a2c56aeecd3347f6c1afc783f583","de29010ee4c1ca32ab97ad997bb43a65b41dffe5"],"pdfUrls":["https://dipot.ulb.ac.be/dspace/bitstream/2013/167923/1/Vereecken_et_al._2013_Pollination_Iris.pdf"],"title":"A pollinators' eye view of a shelter mimicry system.","doi":"10.1093/aob/mct081","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1093/aob%2Fmct081","venue":"Annals of botany"}

We use a simple approximate description of flow in the ionosphere based on an analogy with two dimensional incompressible flow. A non-linear calculation is given which shows that although to first order a travelling vortex may carry no net momentum, the net momentum in the direction of travel is proportional to the square of the flow amplitude. The result shows that transport in the ionosphere of both momentum and magnetic flux is independent of the mechanism by which the vortex pattern is generated at high altitude.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Aspects in common of high latitude ionospheric vortex motions","doi":"10.1016/0273-1177(93)90328-9","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/0273-1177%2893%2990328-9","venue":""}

Exercise stress echocardiography (ESE) is an important, non-invasive tool for the detection of ischemia in adults but has been rarely used in children. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the feasibility and utility of ESE in excluding ANG-detected epicardial CAD at our center, where ESE has been implemented since 2007.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe conducted a retrospective review of all pediatric cardiac transplant recipients at our institution who had undergone ESE and ANG between January 2007 and December 2010, and with testing performed < 12 months apart. ESE results were compared against ANG.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe study cohort comprised 47 cardiac transplant recipients. One patient's ESE images were inadequate for interpretation. Of the remaining 46 patients, ESE had a sensitivity of 88.9% (95% confidence limits [CL], 51.8%, 99.7%), a specificity of 91.9% (95% CL, 71.8%, 98.3%), and a negative predictive value of 97% (95% CL, 85.1%, 99.1%) for the ANG-detected CAD.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThis large, single-center study showed ESE was feasible and had a high specificity and excellent negative predictive value in excluding epicardial CAD in pediatric cardiac transplant recipients. Future prospective, large-scale studies are needed to confirm these findings and help identify a subset of children for whom a negative ESE could decrease the frequency of routine ANG.","inCitations":["f61f6755fb216617eb58faa6ed9ea6c9d2f2135f","a1156374b2269ed616c6fcb175e5c6945d14dc56","07f3dd721762751da70a39406b3b703683d9cfe0","81350379b9aebc96ac1c384c4b4949ad677f5fcf","2137144b7d59889d2ebb5677aa939a9a9b187f33","efed42604ccbe502ede6907d2d979951f2e0eb0e","8939d1f266e9a028c995be8c730819a07d5d3d1e","d101f1fac13ed571403d2022f5603acacced1f17","2ef51ae12281c1d758632458848f8e806c1595ce","8f2eb1bad3539141accb042d18572eb33bdc71cd","cf3ab0b62ccccf35cf859613c2546d41b250e950","60baaf58b8431d83091ee759cfbe18c5a78c90b1","6ac287fa2e09c0834f3fd033b6c5c87ac536e80f"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Utility of exercise stress echocardiography in pediatric cardiac transplant recipients: a single-center experience.","doi":"10.1016/j.healun.2011.12.014","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.healun.2011.12.014","venue":"The Journal of heart and lung transplantation : the official publication of the International Society for Heart Transplantation"}

L'etude de ces modeles experimentaux - Neuropathie Aigue Experimentale chez le rat Lewis et Neuropathie Experimentale Chronique du lapin - a fourni des informations tres utiles sur leurs mecanismes dysimmunitaires. Les rats Lewis immunises avec de la myeline ou avec P2 et P0 associes a de l'adjuvant de Freund presentent des paralysies transitoires. Les aspects histopathologiques sont tres similaires a ceux observes au cours de syndrome de Guillain-Barre et sont caracterises par une reaction inflammatoire lymphocytaire interstielle, ainsi qu'une demyelinisation segmentaire peri-veineuse associee a des macrophages. L'intensite des symptomes cliniques et des lesions pathologiques sont fonction de la dose de l'antigene utilise lors de l'immunisation. La preuve du mecanisme dysimmmunitaire de type cellulaire est prouve chez le rat Lewis ; en effet, on a pu realiser un transfert passif de cette neuropathie experimentale, en injectant chez un autre animal des lymphocytes sensibilises aux proteines P2 et P0. Des facteurs humoraux jouent aussi tres probablement un role dans cette demyelinisation. Ces deux mecanismes pourraient donc intervenir de facon synergique, a la rupture de la barriere endotheliale par des lymphocytes actives, ce qui permettrait aux anticorps antimyeliniques d'acceder a l'espace endoneural. Les lapins, immunises par une seule dose mais importante de myeline, developpent une neuropathie sensitivo-motrice demyelinisante chronique soit progressive, soit a rechutes. Les aspects cliniques, electrophysiologiques et pathologiques ressemblent beaucoup a ceux de la PIDC. Les titres des anticorps IgM et IgG anti-Gal C evoluent de facon parallele aux symptomes cliniques ; ces anticorps possedent une activite demyelinisante. Les mecanismes dysimmunitaires de type cellulaire ne sont pas encore bien caracterises dans ce modele. Ces deux formes de neuropathie experimentale dysimmunitaire peuvent etre tres utiles pour l'etude de traitements nouveaux et specifiques proposes aux patients atteints de neuropathie consideree aussi comme autoimmune.","inCitations":["3f49459617943cce76d101dba992533e0388adc8","145f6ca4e0b664a9331a79466d3ca6068c281073","7a26eb544fbe91be504541eefadc12820daa97f3","d6fc368f1ea8c5c36fbe600a8258b3a4140ee6d2","bbd5c6201821dd4ed418918f1f27f4bcf87f4515","cb5a3c523952d43cb618d3d864ba48a324bd3f67","24753b95dc428d7c1964a919f910f64bcfeade4d","d844d8ebff754bfc0feead41eb36727d3b6b5ec5","5f3b1f5bfd4097225a8dbc4027d7acedbf5a8e3c","6596397a9e74107b373ae0165f8b813dcec2498c"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Experimental allergic neuritis (EAN) as a model for the immune-mediated demyelinating neuropathies.","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

In the present work, the penial glands of this species have been histologically and histochemically analysed, and four types of secretory cells are distinguished. The openings of the penial glands into the intrabulbar and intrapapillar sperm ducts, designated here as intrapenial ducts, allow for the distinction between three histologically differentiated regions. The most proximal region possibly corresponds to the bulbar cavity of other freshwater triclads whereas the median and distal portions correspond to the ejaculatory duct. The proximal region of the intrapenial ducts receives mainly the openings of a secretory cell type (type I) that produces a proteinaceous secretion. A second type of secretory cell (type II) that secretes neutral mucopolyssacharides opens into the median region of the intrapenial ducts. The distal portion of the ducts receives two types of secretory cells (types III and IV) which secret glycoprotein and glycosaminoglycans, respectively. Types III and IV open also directly into the male atrium through the epithelium of the penis papilla. A comparison with the results presented here and those of other authors for species of Girardia is provided and the importance of the study of the penial glands for taxonomic characterisation of freshwater triclads is emphasised.","inCitations":["33f4a8e3132bc6409ef6dba6a7c790d57dfda67a","129704e4ce97abc9f9bd0fee6b480a8038cace0a"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.scielo.br/pdf/bjb/v62n3/12092.pdf"],"title":"Histological and histochemical aspects of the penial glands of Girardia biapertura Sluys, 1997 (Platyhelminthes, Tricladida, Paludicola).","doi":"10.1590/S1519-69842002000300019","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1590/S1519-69842002000300019","venue":"Brazilian journal of biology = Revista brasleira de biologia"}

In this study, we examined a pattern of 7B2 mRNA expression in the mouse and rat pituitary gland. When [35S]-labeled antisense cRNA probes were used for in situ hybridization, 7B2 mRNA transcripts were detected within virtually all endocrine cells of the anterior lobe (gonadotrophs, thyrotrophs, corticotrophs, somatotrophs and lactotrophs) and of the intermediate lobe (melanotrophs). The posterior lobe was negative. By immunocytochemistry, 7B2 accumulation was observed within melanotrophs in the intermediate lobe and within gonadotrophs and thyrotrophs in the anterior lobe. The question of 7B2 production in other pituitary cells, such as corticotrophs, somatotrophs and lactotrophs, was studied under culture conditions. The corticotroph AtT-20 and somatrotroph GH3 cell lines both expressed 7B2 mRNA and contained 7B2 protein detectable by radioimmunoassay. However, this protein could not be visualized by immunocytochemistry. Thus, it is possible that 7B2 is produced in all hormone-synthesizing cells of the pituitary gland, being stored only within some of them and rapidly exported after synthesis from others.","inCitations":["26466fd0989242d82db047db611e5b7a77c39386","943eb8d6c5888f079dae5b4966c5e29234c40e8e","16b3c5ff801b25ded2043e4f3a220a54012e04c8","4768f9d46d64c9780392bff2c498c615146354c7","27a693950641140ef97796a8782c5d50f905b3d0"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Expression of neuroendocrine secretory protein 7B2 mRNA in the mouse and rat pituitary gland.","doi":"10.1159/000126517","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1159/000126517","venue":"Neuroendocrinology"}

Several classes of hydrocarbons are highly reactive hydrocarbons; one is the alkenes, the subject of \"The Mechanisms of the Atmospheric Oxidation of the Alkenes\" (Calvert, et al., OUP, 2000). This book, the second in a series of comprehensive studies of these compounds, will review and evaluate existing literature on the mechanisms of the aromatic hydrocarbons, which have a particularly high potential for ozone generation. The focus of the text will be on problem solving and clarifying uncertain aspects of the chemistry of these compounds.","inCitations":["df00db18555793a043088be4863af0ecf6912a63","83be0536619ac99dd687e11ca02ad44d26821809","ac945b9bcdb9fb10fa120cb1b9fb191b355b90e1","9614f31a65df402a9cbb9f26573c07c01334676a","eccb284ce2d9ca0be7e768a74ba0425bb1b5bb52","77e6060945e15cb0fa6b079b50ca0fb75039d4d3","3c839eec6b45db10896714e923c099e012c89cf6","55b6cc222593da5fea1a03305e2518680ea69894","52498b1891289cb853ced0be7f302c6f800174bb","c241dc37c93ab0daaaf9c8fd55a866942993bb69","d2534bea65cc20e24bd4953c0c13024617337731","4fbec5afe466af0f4244ff3b4b9af289ef93111b","ece9e86778534df3245c9914ffa238b34189a165","fccdf178bdc26dd3b0284f0fcffc658782f2c396","07a42882446d16889a5fa3017c397f7839cefbf8","c84ed58a82927f5de91b514209c96103ef2ec1c9","649bffb29d01d87cb2bfd641ce74623cef0a507e","77f5eb3a41a1a81bf33dcd031fe8501c679ad484","03e3ad2fdb717420d3cea3401d1cb40c06d035d3","d0ec4f317efee6ccf7b0cddd8bafd14445724542","f977345d8e36e791c0755b6194eb427f05810bb5","0c11e0200d92f32a708032808a14da261845d56d","633b45322d8b797f9dd3248038a01a170b50c866","8cf46189d7544c0ee074b3ed0c4cc2ecc7803c46","700ec08a10b829d858a7ba98c152053ddf2af216","7022dfd239eb5f1fb4b719ab2a9d7fea79da841f","0455ce38eb98e0205cbdce2d44e657ae47145d5d","c04c10c614089c80b763edd78044f0d5e0495829","cc2aa7b6409d75e10cb17c1f78441c50ec87a252","905bead1b34c57739574afe7d6c6dcbd7658b4b8","95b40fde2e12dec8b0d420bd24769166e27fd536","21660ee99045a52b98faffddfb30501f57cd251f","bee2ef0a162d52be1ff2a8f8455f7744524aeda8","bca67a716a0e81c48fcea384b39102f070674162","c192a2a56a80a594c7ecbfaee7bdf3627489d7f4","640711fb6e46b4b04c57891758686115d781b3f1","d2d1e7a6b9329bdb550e2e5c34eaa3856b24d287","000f138539905acb168f227982d5d6b4f0f4b19a","5436e1ccfce91d5024723de0a75679faf35e84df","53a4b2c228b2e9e0c2605f4a0d03da1cd25c55eb","6baef746274b82f99a132550d3544b44fe4209e5","b2c100a0d67b9b802cc571bd1883021aa9a41cb1","1624dda3609f8528247acc61fe24851ca747b774","dba395db3667724c49680b5ec443d9e2f70a268e","bb2b94cf16b8127cf106af73e129ac5e8f1447d0","eaa8b14225965ce0df12f74d443fc83ef9e609da","21f61665214ef9fcab60b32f3a2a20d89ac31904","499fc0f7225bf1116a0690dd7d832a7ada5e064b","b0842240d26b573a1ed395765d89962179f5e525","ae7f02f8d30155d9d7e8a822d64acd29bfa12266","5a9c018cb4a4bd072af52eeea313cc18794062b5","3423ff21801b91950230469b95a472f08366305d","6c8a6fc80202a8f19df0f2de2a73f0d942b4c98d","d595ef540b9d36f2ded7788daee31fcfcb390819","9555bf3decde5a34e42925d795443796baab0cac","cc81889a2f73b65f92f78a2f03af6f2f897ad0d1","d18924aef97d0f8013f3d054bfacdacd9b199178","6144193df6a661151c5d170f590829df1dd13909","0dc17098ffefbf1659b5753ded3d697cdf81718d","8f8b21d43a131b962d5d7b1df7be290bae8c860a","cb84ceaf1ac6173e47f1fc644219777b329cc079","81e61b16edcbb16066069260f778f9862fc04eab","6a9c6bf61601d1307e5261ac0bce284f951b6e06","1b47c4e475fcf73c793edadf1cf0736240d43e86","d1fc2e14c27344b5f57ed9194ac40362d785a4ce","e4749ab646979edb5c1914eb08614b7b82dd9772","85efe33f1ef2c1a7f6d5f87fa9899df122d26080","0208cfdedbd69e1d052bdd1378fc230a8dcadb2b","305ae75db430b085825e48f9ace896c0686d9be4","26815a24bcb8ea4de5f41ab465cd0aa47bc787d5","44f3c786d4927a4ebca018d00165c9839c9626fc","edc421d6b663edd17f2ca7f048e19fd7fa537537","634ae7fe5ac5d0a352be9a5bf55ac42b46d3ad01","0404378cac5003f3e599466cd1fa5f211a84d0e7","e78abbca3bc77563cbd0331b4740b6c9da819f59","e1e101114d453b20926c64a68b724ea4d6e212ff","60dcd23b1ce7ce6761b7468c711eb888f2b1cf2c","87a4a77ef9ab85e5cd87f4f16db92cd39bb32755","879402522345976afac19060a9c17d6d7c07016a","0e7c1ee8916f788aa8d205c9392636eb080b7c50","0bcbc1eb88ca067d96cc57f1ab2ee5150afb2dc9","8749c8bf671533bb56c2f6f9bf223fd01c2b96e4","7fdf32c905ab51b87046aa87567d5d7bee396cb7","9f2eb05e431b8f3fb835b72270b11def63c5d700","82acfd61d8f93b8de42352bf5f8b8ee0043a27b4","dddb2a21d27219b1fb3292ec07b02059816b2dcf","b36844a468408c03311813a3fd85e8f4aefa0de6","4cfc7ab62d7116979eca340f64693964c0716d2f","ac60a7b85d5f9d20f5ec0bb023dc843557dbf70c","f828b53a2fd961e74172c483cdc5e759dbea20a7","95047a6b5d7e65c0892594ebe6784ddbacf7c1b4","47dd6ef43076fd1fbed958309b78b44cc334b40a","637a6bb19592ed7e28c8df04f0a6b13d9bf7f27e","ea1a3505ed33792503de2c7f3f748c807e9cac96","2ceaee2001e4910aad20aa8ec53f0f42d5fa2357","1d8f24a5a75bb70e989a436a042289ad577e0798","b0948624286eeef878c8afe4113aa8ac489739a9","4e0e8709b939a5afec3ff8c3352d91f0bc501fb4","4c2ab3c4bdc851d6235806d65006556950711801","c6a70260f972163d6c7c2fe2c33a253e2b7e469c","1e5d5e21d186fb4a532349b3e4de83dabe02cafe","b9ab18d373de0191504d7ebebb7ef15f33a85548","d985ac7a61a52784a75b862d353358866676ca51","a5452d972fd2c7b364f586e93e1125f9f55565e8","ab8bb26f68942c4cdfca881639e2c795f9ededb5","4ed8ac8caabea33fce3fbad2e1a0b34f7d4ee8a0","97915cf4d6071ae25521df72641c0dd5a327f93e","17308693a08e7b2d29d9a6f939b1945bb27344e9","470a7db4c1160f09328b15ce5a6c9199a0a55d62","923de007be4d3d3b119325ea6e965524097c226e","c86d473a84aee7ab4de268934afec980d530feee","7037361aa6eb3e0aefdc1e6c65922e2592c06fc8","56fb8746299e9f18fb3c71dc5005c623842a57be","96ce0eba042fa743c4051614c0cdc5bd2f6bf2e6","651db3d87838f5fad8b412160e0f080105edf860","ff8b535055158ed8bd09e5af7c8

These NRT TCO3 retrievals (V1.0.0) have been included in the data assimilation system of 15 the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS), and tests to monitor the data and to carry out first assimilation experiments with them have been performed for the period 26 November 2017 to 3 May 2018. TROPOMI was still in its commissioning phase until 24 April 2018. Nevertheless, the results show that, even at this early stage, the TROPOMI TCO3 data generally agree well with the CAMS analysis over large parts of the Globe and also with TCO3 retrievals from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) and the Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment-2 (GOME-2) that are routinely assimilated by 20 CAMS. However, the TCO3 NRT data from TROPOMI show some retrieval anomalies at high latitudes, at low solar elevations and over snow/ice (e.g. Antarctica) where the differences with the CAMS analysis and the other datasets are larger. These differences come mainly from the surface albedo climatology that is used in the NRT TROPOMI TCO3 retrieval. This climatology has a coarser horizontal resolution than the TROPOMI TCO3 data which leads to problems in areas where there are large changes in reflectivity from pixel to pixel, e.g. pixels covered by snow/ice or not. 25 The assimilation of TROPOMI TCO3 has been tested in the CAMS system for data between 600N and 600S and for solar elevations less than 100 and is found to have only little impact on the ozone analysis, because the CAMS analysis is already well constrained by several other ozone retrievals that are routinely assimilated. Variational bias correction is applied to the TROPOMI NRT TCO3 data and successfully corrects for the biases seen in the data.

However, as is well known, traditional lens-based optical microscopes suffer from the low imaging resolution λ/2 due to the diffraction limit. To overcome this obstacle, multiple innovative methods have been proposed during the past few decades, such as photoactivatable localization microcopy (PALM), stimulated emission depletion (STEM), surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) based microscopy, and negative-index metamaterials based microscopy. However, the above methods are either florescence based, or can be only operated in a narrow spectral bandwidth. Here we propose to further push forward the pioneering work of Wang, which uses microspheres to achieve a nanoscope with λ/8-λ/14 imaging resolution. To be specific, we present the schematic of our proposed transmission mode microsphere nanoscope in Fig. 1. The targets under measurement are attached to the bottom side of a thin glass layer, whose upside is illuminated by a white-light source. Microspheres that are put on the top of a gold nanowire array collect the scattering information of the target. If the distance between a point on the surface of the target and the incident point on the surface of the microsphere is smaller than the penetration depth of the evanescent field and meanwhile the scattering angle of a beam from the scatter point fulfills the output propagation condition, the microspheres can collect more information of the target than the traditional microscope. The output propagation beam from the microsphere then couples into the gold nanowire array. The aligned metallic nanowires embedded in dielectric bulk possess strongly anisotropic optical properties with negative permittivity along the nanowire axis and positive permittivity in the transverse plane, which can be used to achieve broadband all-angle negative refraction and superlens imaging. Therefore the gold nanowire array plays the role of a second amplifier and a supplementary collector for collecting the scattering beams that are not collected by the microspheres. In this composite array, the guided mode does not effectively penetrate the gold nanowires and thus most of the energy propagates in the host dielectric medium in between the nanowires, so that the influence of the losses in the gold wires is negligible. The output beam of the array is then picked up by a conventional objective lens and the final image of the target is captured by a charge coupled device (CCD). Simulations will be performed to validate the effectiveness of the proposed configuration.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Super-resolution imaging using microspheres supported by a gold nanowire array in transmission mode","doi":"10.1109/PIERS.2016.7734232","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIERS.2016.7734232","venue":"2016 Progress in Electromagnetic Research Symposium (PIERS)"}

The method is exceptionally well suited for field studies, as it is fast, cheap, easy to apply, and almost species-specific. The identification of A. lusitanicus was enabled by four characteristic, stable esterase electromorphs. The profile clearly differed from the band patterns of the digestive enzymes of the carabid beetles, from esterases of other potential prey species and even from the enzymes of early developmental stages of the slug. To test the heaviest stained isoenzyme for its decay under controlled conditions, three carabid species were fed on a fixed amount of slug hepatopancreas. In Carabus cancellatus and Pterostichus melanarius the enzyme lost 35% of its activity after 16 h, fitting a logarithmic curve, whereas in Carabus granulatus the same decay status was already reached after 8 h following a linear regression. Both, the similarities and differences between beetle species might be due to their mode of extra- versus intraintestinal digestion and the amount of hepatopancreas fed. The temperature during digestion was also influential, as the regression slopes of esterase activity between the two temperature regimes tested in C. granulatus were significantly different. The volume of crop contents decreased during digestion in both Carabus species, corresponding to the decline in esterase. In contrast, the crop volume of P. melanarius reached its maximum almost 4 h after ingestion. This was interpreted as an effect of its mode of ingestion and time-elapsed enzyme production.","inCitations":["530619e08519fd8f5dc06b0661443af7bf17a173","4b5d38a8e3820fca6d642493e92e7693634e1704","55aa02d7e579461b1add72b3c42c9ca934e4dba8","180b9fa5190f57f2937c8c904baf6ac9271c2252","adbe46e6453f443dfca6b5ed026172163ef9c581","fe1e3f1e221df9777ccb487016fc578d9618555c","7b67d2195b902b87c4415ddd65be3d24ad4c49a1","89ac0206e7064a38cf885f5a357299acd2fd5973","b088e7c77d4409d55ec7c6fff9151b07de1544de"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Isoelectric focusing as a tool to evaluate carabid beetles as predatory agents of the pest slug Arion lusitanicus","doi":"10.1016/S0038-0717(02)00077-9","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/S0038-0717%2802%2900077-9","venue":""}

Ser133 phosphorylation, in turn, promotes recruitment of the coactivator CREB binding protein and its paralog p300, histone acetyltransferases (HATs) that have been proposed to mediate target gene activation, in part, by destabilizing promoter bound nucleosomes and thereby allowing assembly of the transcriptional apparatus. Here we show that although histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors potentiate target gene activation via cAMP, they do not stimulate transcription over the early burst phase, during which CREB phosphorylation and CBP/p300 recruitment are maximal. Rather, HDAC inhibitors augment CREB activity during the late attenuation phase by prolonging CREB phosphorylation on chromosomal but, remarkably, not on extrachromosomal templates. In reconstitution studies, assembly of periodic nucleosomal arrays on a cAMP-responsive promoter template potently inhibited CREB phosphorylation by PKA, and acetylation of these template-bound nucleosomes by p300 partially rescued CREB phosphorylation by PKA. Our results suggest a novel regulatory mechanism by which cellular HATs and HDACs modulate the phosphorylation status of nuclear activators in response to cellular signals.","inCitations":["7e1dd79ced28f96b0d145c7073891305c57b9b0f","2d002efe24b5e253403981ae130e8637fa5433e0","4448aee603562a3c99ae43c2337d6b0f32ddc2f8","f0e2cd228b7f018b77a04fdc2c33bacdba7b545f","54fddc0fe3fd3193925361f942c42c9b87207505","a7f0f66424ad23a244053311535969daa309ae5e","0aaa79ecf39b1b6296a91cc47ccbcfc58831e43e","63b25f54449db5857100ae0fe49bc8641505f9b7","da48d2a23cf53e5be5ed0685f40e2f8817749bd2","32025106d25fa10ca198ce0e64e668a7db2d14ab","90001c9994c1941f4bf52d28b475661bd2656c9f","e1c6c9b297b384580b7421d308505f4a21c91c48","2a6b9f527bfd6e7a9182898866257553b01190d5","118e63aef75c39696fc3762f806d68e883d984ea","769df1c8dc70a48a49fc0df6b13ba6e850af7956","bbb2bcfc7873ea5f9fb1467edcbaa4ea1ec7b06e","4eb098afd7a6992e7a85aeafae9e4278027fa725","57759c24b6b41117b8ddb2a392f3ec9d64e4d61c","57eef65d1fe490b57501602499c49fa1a05b1491","f8b12cc5db357090a1ce25ae188127555d756936","61df2c6f527ac95b6205e4b4ebbdd9a82d2aebad","fc9e0be18743d43e85c63d90545d620979ef410c","8edb5f39e4f8c38ea9eb6cda80d867c9be78b280","bde9f6db9cd01f1588d74e4bf39c55e4f0462dda","8d40f890ab5276367930b28cbeba336a1c4ef210","799d9015710f078e8dad5db29c703593d4230798","76a893ddfbfa6a7f88cff834b1a70ad7cde2b209","b22f9534dc7069e13774d52973cd73b85502b9a2","9dcc67cc2789f1165d99585654329a9d5794cc9e","17850a1da7fc88dce1e637a12f8cd47d52ba85ea","882eb5d80d4d192e9358c0261f188fc0f57b699c","53d7936e349fa1dd8e7365185f06db06272c2ba6","b5175ef54e6dcaa55b65eb4ded31923b51ba0bed","7101b7591d7c7633a084e96fd22fc435a782b462","fb46e2aaf93b11721b4822c8072f1e3532c35f06","5d0d70ddf525a0e30b26488c080b78d83a1d9c40","172ab1e20d3485dbf0347c2300113b286c2b7d22","5213bbdc1ff6ac216cc49142e87e627567bdff5c","e051d901d8258b9a06261e22311aa16d804f5c0e","15f8c710bffdd8122ed639b8414b401afca58c2c","3bc73cfb37661893957021ca8f87000203e84321","96a8af40fc4236c7c03ae6d68b7bec12d7657f75","df6e3c4db45c4b18a90e918acf75c0577065ec75","7298be544913a38328bc6fc90338e41b580ddaa4","417befb84302defdaa53a0e58950656d902ea02c","e90c2b8a6f9e87c1ec4c472d82fbe896c0111bb5","3504402352d12113e01be8baa79ec3f4bfe140c2","ff7e1d9cf7e755b5a48d642794ee12da6a0e9f31","b74ae7a1c57c7726103e15e09d6f041ce0f63449"],"pdfUrls":["http://mcb.asm.org/content/20/5/1596.full.pdf"],"title":"The phosphorylation status of a cyclic AMP-responsive activator is modulated via a chromatin-dependent mechanism.","doi":"10.1128/MCB.20.5.1596-1603.2000","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1128/MCB.20.5.1596-1603.2000","venue":"Molecular and cellular biology"}

In children, outpatient urological procedures are among the most common surgeries performed, but data are lacking to guide appropriate postoperative opioid prescribing. The aim of this study was to compare the amount of prescribed opioid medication to the amount taken for acute pain after minor pediatric urological surgery and to determine the disposition of excess opioid. In addition, we explored whether distinct patient characteristics and procedure type influenced opioid prescribing and consumption.\n\n\nMETHODS\nOf the 139 families of pediatric patients enrolled, 115 were interviewed within 48 hours and/or 10-14 days of discharge to determine the amount of opioid prescribed and consumed, duration of treatment, and disposition of unconsumed opioid.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe most common procedures performed were circumcision (n = 58) and orchiopexy (n = 40). Most patients (98%) were male, and 77% were <8 years of age. All opioid prescriptions were for oxycodone dosed every 4 hours as needed (PRN). Median number of doses prescribed was 30 (interquartile range [IQR], 23-31; n = 138) for both respondents who reported doses remaining (IQR, 29-31; n = 83) and those who did not (IQR, 22-32; n = 55). Among those reporting doses remaining, median number of doses consumed was 4.2 (IQR, 0-14). Multivariable linear regression showed no significant association between doses consumed and patient age, type of procedure, discharge pain score, or use of adjuvant analgesics. Median duration of opioid therapy was 2 days (IQR, 0-5; n = 83) with each additional day of opioid use corresponding to an average increase in consumption of 2.3 doses (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.8-2.8). An estimated 75% (95% CI, 69%-81%) of opioid dispensed was not consumed, and 86% (72/83) of patients took ≤18 doses. Forty-four of 65 (68%) families reported receiving no disposal instructions for leftover opioid, and only 7 families disposed of leftover medication.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nFor minor pediatric urological surgeries in young boys, a 3-day supply (18 doses) of opioid was sufficient to adequately treat acute postoperative pain in most patients. Adjusting opioid dispensing to align with consumption and better educating patients and families on opioid disposal can be used to potentially decrease availability of leftover opioids in homes and communities.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Physicians Prescribe More Opioid Than Needed to Treat Pain in Children After Outpatient Urological Procedures: An Observational Cohort Study.","doi":"10.1213/ANE.0000000000004392","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1213/ANE.0000000000004392","venue":"Anesthesia and analgesia"}

On nondenaturing (native) gels, in vitro translated, 35S-labeled Gγ subunits traveled primarily according to their pI and apparently were not associated with other proteins. In contrast, in vitro translated, 35S-labeled Gβ subunits traveled at a high apparent molecular mass (∼700 kDa) and co-migrated with the chaperonin CCT complex (also called TRiC). Different FLAG-Gβ isoforms coprecipitated CCT/TRiC to a variable extent, and this correlated with the ability of the different Gβ subunits to efficiently form dimers with Gγ. When translated Gγ was added to translated Gβ, a new band of low apparent molecular mass (∼50 kDa) was observed, which was labeled by either 35S-labeled Gβ or Gγ, indicating that it is a dimer. Formation of the Gβγ dimer was ATP-dependent and inhibited by either adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate) or aluminum fluoride in the presence of Mg2+. This inhibition led to increased association of Gβ with CCT/TRiC. Although Gγ did not bind CCT/TRiC, addition of Gγ to previously synthesized Gβ caused its release from the CCT/TRiC complex. We conclude that the chaperonin CCT/TRiC complex binds to and folds Gβ subunits and that CCT/TRiC mediates Gβγ dimer formation by an ATP-dependent reaction.","inCitations":["f4b313c1c860bc7b47211bccaa91854b9c08e3f7","cb0e0ee273733494c494cacda40c4aa69d5cad58","7840965901784f025ca0c51679642d2e8ad2f47c","46fc9c2343be47ac5a9ac44bb6016580c7b0f929","d197d8d04c8b2d4ef29396b7816e1c9948d70d71","e07a215bf96031c732e34413475a9f449b80ac9b","033e4e5df03cb1d0e5dab68ed6d82037c762de53","dbb2d71d5d673b290cd69d933920207b16202662","f232cd0b0018a81d923eed74e2e1e2cbf238399f","867eaede86c597deec3e8164d44bf859b705e371","f63fdf4f53a9b318cbd8fdb5a53229b19764fa22","5642fe63b8859ddfb31afa2306f5a42e2bb6cc24","b19a6bd2095e10fd14bb52c3649eb9fe7bf53001","0a5b29a3677dac6cd13e7877be994c147a534974"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Role of the Chaperonin CCT/TRiC Complex in G Protein βγ-Dimer Assembly","doi":"10.1074/jbc.M602409200","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M602409200","venue":""}

With the introduction of the distributed generations, more and more unbalanced infrastructures can be connected to the grid, creating unbalanced systems. It will be desirable to have effective analytical methods and modeling techniques for unbalanced systems. This paper proposes a new approach to analyzing unbalanced systems by demonstrating a decoupled analytical technique for resolving the unbalanced system into the balanced positive-, negative- and zero-sequence system components in the circuit level. The proposed method decomposes the unbalanced admittance of the system into independent admittance bases (IAB) each of which belongs to one of the positive-, negative-or zero-sequence system component to ease subsequent analyses.","inCitations":["9c08860817ec1839095036b7257c24d9deebaa72","3c13f1aafb8ecd5054f68074a40237d56c752ce3"],"pdfUrls":["https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q58215920"],"title":"A set of independent admittance bases for decoupled analysis of unbalanced three-phase systems","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2013.6571882","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2013.6571882","venue":"2013 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS2013)"}

The model is based on the concept of biblical stewardship and includes the stewardship of earning income as well as the stewardship of spending money. The article concludes with a set of contrasting statements which highlight how biblical perspectives radically change the way believers should understand and practice personal finance.","inCitations":["15bf95f86d976001accccc45a071353e7110ff90","635c3d88e86fad16044ad389820c89e5a6bec382","82110b73334254dd7d711684b6fdfe080c31c79c","6b86e9e3cc126b6bc5bf84c3f87a3a72007d7b99","fb4365652668d09fab45a78d82fdf0213e72a03b"],"pdfUrls":["https://cbfa-cbar.org/index.php/cbar/article/download/54/54"],"title":"A Biblical Model for Teaching Personal Finance","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}
