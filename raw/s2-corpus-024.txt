In Korea, a total 450 freshwater zooplankton species have been reported (85 species of cladocera, ca. 230 species of rotifera since 1939, and 138 species of copepoda), and they cover 10% of total zooplankton species list. In the present paper, we provide recent species list of zooplankton found in Korea and their taxonomic keys. Over periods of 45 years, there are 25 published papers for zooplankton biota in lentic ecosystems in Korean Journal of Ecology and Environment (KJEE). The ecology of zooplankton communities in rivers has focused on the mechanisms involved in regulating their abundance, diversity and spatio-temporal patterns of genus Bosmina and rotifers (genus Brachionus and Keratella) that are most frequently found from Korea. On the other hand, the studies on zooplankton in wetland has focused on Alona, Chydorus and Ceriodaphnia with special emphasis on their relationships with aquatic macrophytes. Even though studies on the freshwater ecosystem in Korea have a long history, a few of studies on zooplankton biota were conducted at rice paddy, Dumbeong and wetlands. During the last two decades, experimental advances in freshwater zooplankton ecology and understanding of structure and function of this biota were made from a series of articles mainly in journal of KJEE. For future studies, quantitative, experimental and interdisciplinary approaches would be key words to understand zooplankton ecology and their roles in aquatic ecosystems under changing environments, and we have suggested necessary zooplankton research fields and future directions.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"한국하천호수학회를 통해 본 국내 담수 동물플랑크톤 연구의 역사와 현재, 미래의 연구 동향","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

It is shown that mean life span, as it is measured in most experiments, is a poor estimate of the potential life span of a Drosophila strain. However, the analysis of four extensive studies of Drosophila melanogaster life span strongly suggests that the potential (or maximal) life span is consistently higher for females than it is for males. That analysis also shows that, vis-à-vis the controlled or uncontrolled variations of the environment, the males have a broader norm of reaction or, in other words, a smaller homeostasis than the females. A model, mainly based on these two results, allows us to explain how the mean life span of males is so often higher than that of females.","inCitations":["01427370b403555fb1f881806644e4e00f6847b9","54e87ee912aeca9c7ceb407b2b2c32e96503db64","cba8e65673e204251ec5367ea4422bc737b17659","e29a73553eb4cd3bd993af700eabd89c502a8557","3e1c5410738386f9656eb0aa131eaa02751ab4db","a56fade931f342cb13a8db82fa3065607e8bdcb7","69bd0b3f2bd94f2d9ef4bf2c45be9ee86c7c5eb6","c6eb5a71f22b328cf0c818067830824bc2a7e815","65a0410a615caa0090681bbccf12b0d2bca9efc3","1de7e7220394eacdab4473f307e0f8884cb817b4","c1d1f36adabc87070abdfb104d15ea27e1ea54f9","86949997d6b040b308aa4d694a9d2000470bc95e","c1111e85c4b06586c8761bdea6bb2ba818891166","db1bb09ad74799ea5579011c66080225b3e30ac2","703ff6bb0aac9c09113a19c55649a814350073aa","ddbe7148042dd65786d7ebbbd100c9ade6b65208","8512165c6da66edc1198b09670cbcccff7ca1f21"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Does the female life span exceed that of the male?

The harmonic distiton of the output wave decreases, approaching zero as the number of voltage levels increases. Calculations are done for reference current generation of DVSI using ISCT to operate DVSI in grid sharing and grid injected modes . These works make the DVSI scheme a promising alternative for microgrid supplying weak loads.

La presence d’un diverticule ileal (de Meckel) temoigne de la non resorption complete du sommet de l’anse intestinale primitive.

Subjective locomotion scoring is unreliable for detecting mild cases of lameness in dairy herds. Undetected lameness can progress to a more serious and painful state with unfavourable prognosis. The aim of this study was to conduct an investigation on the use of a pressure plate for early detection of lameness in dairy heifers compared to a subjective visual scoring system. Seven heifers deemed sound, on the basis of a visual scoring system, were walked through a chute where a pressure plate was disguised on the floor. Claws were then inspected during trimming and revealed no lesions (n=3) and hairy heel warts on at least one hind claw (n=4). Peak vertical force (PVF) and right-left hind limb PVF symmetry were calculated. Sound heifers demonstrated significantly higher PVF and better right-left hind limb symmetry than those with hairy heel warts. Using a pressure plate, gait abnormalities from foot lesions that were undiagnosed using a subjective lameness scoring system, were detected. Early detection of lameness is vital to reduce dairy industry losses and to improve animal welfare.","inCitations":["0196bd1dc13cd681a1f78375c2f930c48cd32c97","50446a49944e073f2cfe98eaf5946eac7ad42eba","2160ae22838baa44e8e986fed8a1b976c22a5732","73b1f3a55dbb9f705fb1db00335e903f71251007","5d297007b078c3697e0884126357ed6945b45ba6","3847d0a9262dd6dc089b0a2b4d63be05c1e1aae8","ac4851ea38213beea49bdfa8c40e813b6b22fd6f","9709312109ee9a5c1e1586c9dde398bdba842045"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Early detection of lameness in heifers with hairy heel warts using a pressure plate","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

When the results of the new models and QFT are combined, formu-lae for e and as(q) are derived in terms of only h and c. The modeling method appliesto both the electromagnetic and color forces. Evaluation of the action integral of poten-tial field fluctuation for each interaction potential yields _ h/2 for both electromagneticand color fluctuations, in agreement with QFT. Thus each model is a quantized semi-classical representation for such virtual antiparticle pairs, to good approximation. Thiswork reduces the number of arbitrary parameters of the Standard Model by two from 18to 16. These are remarkable, unexpected results from a basically classical method.Keywords: virtual, antiparticle, positron, QED, QCD","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Virtual Antiparticle Pairs, the Unit of Charge e and the QCD Coupling as","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

The performance is improved to allow the development of more powerful and smaller circuits. This paper describes simple ALU but contains the essentials functions. It is a reconfigurable ALU based on double-gate carbon nanotube field effect transistor (DG-CNTFETs). This transistor has an interesting property, it can switch from p- to n- type behavior and vice-versa dynamically. This opens the opportunity for building novel and complex functions in fine-grain reconfigurable logic inaccessible to MOSFETs and reaching a good performance levels. In literature there are several problems related to signal quality. In this paper, we will propose a new solution that allows us to improve the quality of the output signal without affecting the number of transistors used. This improves the overall performance of ALU. We will show the improvement in signal level and quality. First, an overview of carbon nanotube field-effect transistor (CNTFET) and state of the art Reconfigurable ALU based on DG-CNTFET is given. Then an explication of signal integrity issues of the actual Reconfigurable DG-CNTFET cell is done. After we will present and explain the proposed solution. The solution is first applied on the cnt_9T circuit then will show its effect on the ALU. Finally, a performance comparison is made.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"New Optimized Reconfigurable ALU Design Based on DG-CNTFET Nanotechnology","doi":"10.11591/ijres.v7.i3.pp189-196","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.11591/ijres.v7.i3.pp189-196","venue":""}

Eighty-four patients received concurrent chemoradiation [RT (+) group], primarily 5-flourouracil based (70%). Thirty-two patients received chemotherapy alone [RT (-) group], the majority gemcitabine based (78%). Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were calculated from date of diagnosis to date of first recurrence and to date of death or last follow-up, respectively. Univariate statistical analysis was used to determine significant prognostic factors for overall survival.\n\n\nRESULTS\nMedian patient age was 67 years. Sixty patients were female (52%). Median follow-up was 11 months (range, 1.6-59.4 months). The RT (+) group received a median radiation dose of 50.4 Gy, was more likely to present with ECOG 0-1 performance status, and experienced less grade 3-4 toxicity. PFS was 10.9 versus 9.1 months (P=0.748) and median survival was 12.5 versus 9.1 months (P=0.998) for the RT (+) and RT (-) groups respectively (P=0.748). On univariate analysis, patients who experienced grade 3-4 toxicity had worse overall survival than those who did not (P=0.02).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nOptimal management for LAPC continues to evolve. Patients who developed treatment-related grade 3-4 toxicity have a poorer prognosis. Survival rates were not statistically significant between chemotherapy and chemoradiotherapy groups.","inCitations":["dd9cc74abd1468c93ca0ba821c201a8633a00527","e5940d00fccff67fa08c15a5bcdabb93cf15d3a5","8919b594909c14d0a37f0f20f923f10d760d27f4","babdaedbfaee1723343c6a7486091d3c1c469d46","dcb6b1bed5666becf255900d6493f06051484cf6","9cbabf44a2287e6ffdcf06e1598bd79a0bd7fdef","9b72638af2c70246c515eeb87c02519bd1e45e1f","6f29dbca2483e0df96ca7ea994aaf24d15b0f55f","6cbe5f5026358e3543dba7cef1ea05ebfd35f3ef","681fded0179b7646addca0dcc3bb788b366a4ebf","0762282ca8017f848b8dbe4d3eba53c4d998eb0e","0054af92dea5e4d613c75d6018865d0ea32e22fe","736bf3d13b41df24b6f5c4f42c9455cfd5215077","48acbb1e5139930132dd2cf1854503be0fb0c40a","94b00c9a476a4c208abee9a4dd210204aae777f5","5d85265fa5a3a298ca342d43f6d00f0a5105062b","ea9365f5a9fa5005fb4bdad0fd0d12dcd748b4c2","daad42de04569fc8889f74c6019c6a535c3560ff","720d7951dc87e0b05ef01bea7ffce472f306cfaf","6914d02eab1c0e7274a351be157f1d0e40ed6fe9","9d9524707e301886c7ffd2e0c226c965857072fe","f0fc6768181f9f2ae1cc884a15a847bf875f7fab","534e6d9857166115ddb19e82f1e773cfbf3fb570","eaa0a380903281e61564e5e2ca038a3567804f10","a0f9b44b00fd61c8ae66a47c29228704e60394fb","143af360c09ebae00fd185123aa6df5823bc8fc0","70517b9996bea8105ffae0b3de978b1b10fe6e89","30dfbc251515964ed3f39721f7f5c78a254850bf","5098b7ceab501ac7251fa18158571bfa5f84527b","25ce15518a26b49163f4ab1e1a273c5b92fcc45f","e8c5511567dd7bbd8d022232838952bbfa0c6bcb","a48ca6661d503fd84f8e713461beb5b76cf8f50a"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Treatment of locally advanced unresectable pancreatic cancer: a 10-year experience.","doi":"10.3978/j.issn.2078-6891.2012.029","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.3978/j.issn.2078-6891.2012.029","venue":"Journal of gastrointestinal oncology"}

Nous rapportons un cas de syndrome d'Eagle de decouverte fortuite chez une patiente de 62ans, sans antecedent particulier, admise aux urgences pour une fracture de l'arcade zygomatique droite a la suite d'une chute. La tomodensitometrie(TDM) maxillo-faciale avec reconstruction 3D a objective deux processus osseux bilateraux s'etendant de l'apophyse styloide en direction de la petite corne de l'os hyoide temoignant d'une ossification du ligament stylo-hyoidien, ce qui a permis de poser le diagnostic de syndrome d'Eagle. Le syndrome d'Eagle ou syndrome de l'apophyse styloide longue a ete decrit pour la premiere fois par Eagle en 1937. Sa frequence est estimee a 4% de la population generale, et seulement 4% de ses ossifications sont symptomatiques. Les signes fonctionnels sont variables, Eagle a distingue trois groupes, le premier est celui du syndrome classique associant des cervicalgies, otalgie et une gene pharyngee, le deuxieme caracterise par des douleurs le long de la carotide externe et le troisieme asymptomatique. La palpation des fossettes tonsillaires permet de suspecter le diagnostic. Les radiographies standards le confirment generalement, mais c'est surtout la TDM qui permet de bien explorer le ligament calcifie et ses rapports. Le traitement est chirurgical, base sur l'exerese du processus calcifie et la liberation des structures vasculo-nerveuses comprimees.

To test it, GPs were divided into three subgroups on the basis of an attitude questionnaire. The General Health Questionnaire (GHQ) and the Present State Examination (PSE) were used as criteria. No differences in sensitivity to psychiatric illness were observed using either scale. Results of factor analysis with the subscales of the GP attitude questionnaire and the indices 'bias' and 'accuracy' were similar to those reported by GOLDBERG and associates. 'New' patients were defined as patients in whom the GP had not identified a mental health problem (MHP) in the past year. 'Old' patients were defined as 'not new'. GPs tended to under-identify MHPs in 'new' and over-identify them in 'old' patients. Recognition of psychiatric illness was better in 'old' than in 'new' patients. In 'new' patients, recognition depended on psychiatric diagnosis. Among 'old' patients, older people and people (especially women) with low education predominated. In their assessments GPs used information not contained in the GHQ.","inCitations":["8027711e6026cec94f8e9eeec42cc27747f3d98e","f66ba94fb81988f7ee5866c839fc5808b263c845","90b7663d3330d211f2cbfbe2e5f57f21030a1735","976c056d2be053ea6c9d12bb7798928b5d0403aa"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"General practitioners' characteristics and the assessment of psychiatric illness.","doi":"10.1016/0022-3956(89)90004-6","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/0022-3956%2889%2990004-6","venue":"Journal of psychiatric research"}

Segmental vitiligo (SV) is a subtype of vitiligo refractory to treatment. Objective: We studied safety and efficacy of 308-nm monochromatic excimer light (MEL) in combination with 0.1% tacrolimus ointment for the treatment of SV. Methods: Fifty patients with SV were enrolled. MEL was given on alternate dates in combination with topical tacrolimus. Clinical photographs were taken once a month. Two independent dermatologists analyzed and graded the results. Results: Five patients were lost to follow-up. Concerning overall treatment success, 77.8 percent of patients demonstrated at least 75-percent repigmentation. More specifically, 35.6 percent of patients showed complete (100%) repigmentation (Grade 5), whereas 42.2 percent of patients showed more than 75-percent repigmentation (Grade 4). Conclusion: Combination therapy with topical 0.1% tacrolimus and a 308-nm excimer lamp appears to be efficacious with a good safety profile. The duration of disease was a statistically significant factor inversely correlated with treatment success rate. The site of vitiligo also plays a significant part in the outcome, as facial lesions responded best to the treatment.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Safety and Efficacy of the Combination of 308-nm Monochromatic Excimer Light and Topical 0.1% Tacrolimus Ointment in Segmental Vitiligo: An Open-label Study.","doi":"","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"The Journal of clinical and aesthetic dermatology"}

The aim of this study was to examine reward reactivity in female twins with EDs and compare it with a twin control group. A sample of 112 twins [n = 51 met lifetime DSM-IV ED criteria (anorexia nervosa n = 26; bulimic disorders n = 24), n = 19 unaffected cotwins and n = 42 control twins] was administered measures assessing reward reactivity, including the Game of Dice Task, the Behavioural Inhibition/Activation (BIS/BAS) Scales and the Appetitive Motivation Scale (AMS). Within pair, correlations for monozygotic and dizygotic twins were calculated and generalised estimating equations compared probands with non-ED cotwins and controls. The BAS and the AMS were reduced in EDs and negatively associated with restrictive symptoms. In addition, monozygotic twins pairs demonstrated significant within pair similarity for the BAS and AMS. Conversely, there was less evidence to support the BIS or risky decision-making as measured by the Game of Dice Task as an endophenotype in EDs.

Monochromatic excitation leads to a strong anisotropic response arising from the interference of numerous underlying multiphoton pathways. The interference can be controlled through the polarization content of the input radiation. This anisotropic response is subnatural, quite unlike the anisotropy arising from spontaneous-emission–assisted optical pumping. Its sensitivity to external influences such as magnetic field suggests its utility in magnetometry. Specifically, we discover the presence of an elemental closed loop involving series of absorption and emission cycles that is central to the total response, and is universal to all atomic configurations. However, as not all atomic configurations support such anisotropy, we present a general classification of atomic transitions that exhibit anisotropic nonlinear response through quantum interference.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Anisotropic nonlinear optics based on quantum interference","doi":"10.1209/0295-5075/120/33001","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1209/0295-5075%2F120%2F33001","venue":""}

However, they only react to predefined wordings and do not actually grasp the user's intent. To overcome this limitation, a system must grasp the topics the user is talking about. Therefore, we apply unsupervised multi-topic labeling to spoken utterances. Although topic labeling is a well-studied task on textual documents, its potential for spoken input is almost unexplored. Our approach for topic labeling is tailored to spoken utterances; it copes with short and ungrammatical input. The approach is two-tiered. First, we disambiguate word senses. We utilize Wikipedia as pre-labeled corpus to train a naïve-bayes classifier. Second, we build topic graphs based on DBpedia relations. We use two strategies to determine central terms in the graphs, i.e. the shared topics. One focuses on the dominant senses in the utterance and the other covers as many distinct senses as possible. Our approach creates multiple distinct topics per utterance and ranks results. The evaluation shows that the approach is feasible; the word sense disambiguation achieves a recall of 0.799.

Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) may be a new marker to evaluate endothelial dysfunction (ED), which is a potential target in treating HT. The aim of the present study was to compare the effects of Telmisartan/HCT with Losartan/HCT on serum HGF and ED in hypertensive patients. Hypertensive patients were randomly divided into a Telmisartan/HCT (group T) or Losartan/HCT group (group L) and received one tablet of either drug per day for 8 weeks. Serum HGF, nitric oxide (NO), plasma von Willebrand factor (vWF), and endothelin (ET) were measured before treatment and after 8 weeks of treatment. Twenty healthy subjects were selected as controls (control group). HGF, vWF, ET, and the ET/NO ratio were higher, and NO was lower in hypertensive patients than those in the control group (all P < 0.01). After treatment for 8 weeks, HGF, vWF and ET decreased, and NO increased significantly in both groups (all P < 0.01). The reductions in BP and HGF and increase in NO (DeltaNO) were not significantly different between the two groups (all P > 0.05), but the reductions in vWF and ET (DeltaET) and DeltaET/DeltaNO ratio were more obvious in group T than in group L (all P < 0.01). There was no significant correlation between the changes in most of the measured parameters and the extent of BP reduction in either group. Both Telmisartan/HCT and Losartan/HCT could decrease serum HGF and improve ED, which was independent of the antihypertensive effects. However, the improvement in ED may be superior with Telmisartan/HCT than Losartan/HCT when the BP-lowering effects are the same.","inCitations":["7121d13d341ffebd58b6666a4e46e93f662b24cd","a44668c350089ad36f1df01d33bc4b9ebd60042b","6bbc2c0058dfb4f4c1b0478172a8e2e33e0e02ef","f4d174fb394230ef1db1bded47a7a2de93b925c5","ab599013c2dc4bf6c713d66f23138ad89786f91b","2b855028d9275ca28833253b5bcc29caf977c119","4bcb1dde682d54385817b52b6e973ca8136313e0","d52188eee22b9ff272c5cfabc5f7212f4f3e87de","0178c95cf55da7c96a8fd41fb2e86a400d7d10b3","4a97a8a67e8034f4c3d52fe3996b1cbd556f2891","d89f3df2a165f0f97250777ce92619223651d485","b52c3658e10c9945765b01599a7e38f24333b887","5932961fd194c661630cf3d2dcf788eb66eef180","af3900c71c040778696ab83a04849e6b96619fea","761f07d473d6418b4dd647b697b7f7a1e5131c28"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Fixed-dose telmisartan/hydrochlorothiazide in comparison with losartan/hydrochlorothiazide in decreasing serum hepatocyte growth factor and improving endothelial dysfunction in hypertensive patients.","doi":"10.1536/ihj.51.252","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1536/ihj.51.252","venue":"International heart journal"}

The motivation, from an audio signal processing perspective, is as follows. Many audio related target responses can be well-modelled by a combination of distributed decaying exponential components, which is by definition what a Kautz filter does, but in an orthonormalized form, providing many favorable properties. The most essential part is then how to choose the Kautz filter poles, to which we propose a new effective and well-behaving iterative method. Utilizing an intermediate warping procedure, desired frequency resolution allocation is incorporated to the choosing of poles - the target signal is warped prior to the pole optimization and then the produced poles are mapped back to the original frequency domain using inverse warping.","inCitations":["6dd5de45308d3bc9600691236202ff700a7a413c","0daac88794ca6bb2691b623f451e9fc0bbbffbdf","727660cb60868324627b23654877901d869a2f45","96b9618946e41ff1f33b15eaf279c767a470a2ef","a3c817a9bd8b84e1ff1c03bed4f7306455b00948","6239b3380cc4bae0ce6bc43981f2340311c5dd25","c48059234def193c7e698f3dd680a0c9d9dee01f"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.acoustics.hut.fi/research/cat/dsp/papers/euspos.pdf","http://legacy.spa.aalto.fi/research/cat/dsp/papers/euspos.pdf","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7072192/"],"title":"An audio motivated hybrid of warping and Kautz filter techniques","doi":"","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"2002 11th European Signal Processing Conference"}

The outer layer represents the recommendations. A bedside practitioner responsible for immediate decision making and trusting guidelines process will focus on the recommendations. This group of users may find the tables of abbreviated recommendations−the essence of the guidelines condensed to 7 pages−especially useful. The next layer represents the rationales for the recommendations, illuminating the logic—the evidence and the thought—underlying each recommendation. For those who want a more in-depth understanding of how the recommendations were built, the rationales are a great resource. Moreover, the rationales help cement the recommendations for the busy practitioner: insight into the biologic plausibility and reasoning enable timely recall. The rationales also represent a foundation for educating healthcare practitioners on the recognition and treatment of sepsis. The deepest layer, the core of the onion, houses the evidentiary tables. The tables compile and organize the existing data in a manner that provides insight into the reasoning behind each recommendation (magnitude of benefit or harm and the quality of evidence).

The Pinochet case was the first case that put this issue in the limelight of international attention. Since then, the question has been put to several domestic and international courts, and has engaged the minds of scholars and politicians around the world. This book examines the tension between international immunity rules, international human rights law, and international criminal law. The progressive development of a normative system of international human rights law and international criminal law without the simultaneous development of international institutional enforcement mechanisms had brought the question of the role of national courts in the application of these norms to the fore and has made the question as to the relation between immunity rules and human rights and international criminal law an immediate one. The tension between the centuries old immunity rules and the relatively recent developments in international human rights law and international criminal law presents itself in two distinct forms. In the first place it can be questioned whether immunity rules as such are compatible with certain fundamental rights of individuals under international law such as the rights of access to court, the right to a remedy, or the right to effective protection. Secondly, it can be questioned whether immunity rules apply unabridged in proceedings concerning grave human rights abuses. In its examination of these two questions this book sets out to clearly distinguish the different scope and nature of the rule of state immunity, the rule of functional immunity and the personal immunity of diplomatic agents and heads of state. While strong arguments against certain applications of immunity rules can be derived from international human rights law and international criminal law, this book argues that an unqualified attack on immunity rules risks casting a shadow over all human rights based arguments.","inCitations":["d5bcd3214893c103a18efd89d9c711dd9a0987d3","892b7ef69fef536a438b606f006ad8a98a698b2c","626c9c2fa6bae29d361985bb3eb7af3676c7b197","657a2f3be7ff0334964396af0c6d55846486015a","080f3b449af6b00726eeeee8e5ea13214ff05a91","ab111b1a1ffc7c2821251857046bf7bea7a62763","b8050b769014ac5c1c12641aa1978ef234e805dc","a561696150ba72bf50689bc6640a8834e9888ec6","53be80bc865faca9cc2c1d92a28d7e00d96efd03","33e5e0ed51f637fd447d3172468a5e66c5fecd5e","eef329d8684170cf396cebec701822b50a3e461b","ff24eec8755e15dc749d11237e2a8c63d14e5be5","12c410bdd4879248ca035fec4a8cd5ba58d4752e","db07069140d0a46db68833636ddf28eefa0b1fe1","5b82ff1f1693aee10f1795f8827e8432efbd2b29"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"The immunity of states and their officials in international criminal law and international human rights law","doi":"10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199232475.001.0001","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1093/acprof%3Aoso%2F9780199232475.001.0001","venue":""}

Calibration registers are used to reduce the error of the most significant bits conversion due to the usage of a smaller capacitor array.

Slbo, a Drosophila homolog of C/EBP (CCAAT/enhancer binding protein), was shown to be unstabilized by tribbles. Here, we identified TRB3 as a tribbles ortholog in humans, which associated with CHOP to suppress the CHOP-dependent transactivation. TRB3 is induced by various forms endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress later than CHOP. Tunicamycin treatment enhanced the TRB3 promoter activity, while dominant-negative forms of CHOP suppressed the tunicamycin-induced activation. In addition, the tunicamycin response region in the TRB3 promoter contains amino-acid response elements overlapping the CHOP-binding site, and CHOP and ATF4 cooperated to activate this promoter activity. Knockdown of endogenous ATF4 or CHOP expression dramatically repressed tunicamycin-induced TRB3 induction. Furthermore, knockdown of TRB3 expression decreased ER stress-dependent cell death. These results indicate that TRB3 is a novel target of CHOP/ATF4 and downregulates its own induction by repression of CHOP/ATF4 functions, and that it is involved in CHOP-dependent cell death during ER

The work presented here provides evidence of learned visual discriminations of complex visual patterns in the blowfly, Phoenicia sericata. A learning and memory assay was developed to determine the pattern-orientation discrimination ability of blowflies. Individual flies were trained to discriminate between pairs of visual patterns that differed in the orientation of their composite lines. During training and subsequent testing trials flies exhibited a preference for the previously-rewarded visual stimulus. Flies learned to discriminate between horizontal and vertical gratings, +45° and -45° gratings, and vertical and +5° gratings. Among four possible underlying mechanisms used to discriminate between these sets of patterns, hypothetical orientation-selective neurons are imiquely capable of discriminating between all sets of discriminated pattems. One previous theory of insect vision suggests that in order for an insect to recognize previously learned visual images, the insect must align the current retinal input with the region of the retina with which the pattem was first viewed and learned (Wehner, 1981; Dill et al., 1993). To address this theory of retinotopic matching, a detailed analysis was made of fly behavior during the discrimination process. Both the spatial structure of the approaches to the visual cues and the range of body orientations used by individual flies demonstrated that Phoenicia approaches the visual cue from an unique 16 vantage point from trial to trial and, therefore, retinotopic matching is not necessary for the recognition of pattern orientation by blowflies. To test for the existence of orientation-selective neurons in Phaenicia, the lobula neuropil was impaled for intracellular recording. Two neurons exhibited directional motion preferences indicative of a possible role in the detection of expanding, oblique edges during approach to visual cues. Two additional neurons with combined responses to both directional motion and the orientation of the stimulus were recorded. These data support the hypothesis that the dipteran lobula processes information regarding the orientation of visual stimuli. 17 CHAPTER ONE INTRODUCTION Overview and Significance Neuroethological approaches to animal behavior have proved successful in describing nervous system flmction at a variety of levels in many animals (modulation of neuronal oscillators and subsequent changes in social signals in electric fish: Kawasaki and Heiligenberg, 1989; sound localization in owls: Volman and Konishi, 1990; C-start evasive response of fishes: Eaton et al., 1991). Often the approach provides a model system in which broad principles of nervous systems function can be optimally addressed (the role of sensory experience in multimodal maps: Knudsen, 1991; steroid hormone effects on behavior: Weeks and Levine, 1995). This approach often lends itself to a wider understanding of animal behavior and evolution of nervous systems because overriding principles are gleaned from questions that are driven by a desire to understand a particular organism, its behavior, and the underlying mechanisms residing within the nervous system. Fly visual behavior has been examined extensively for many decades. Many investigators have been attracted to the study of fly visual systems by observations that flies are extremely fast and acrobatic fliers. The visual processing underlying such fast, dynamic movements occurs in one of the most beautiful and well-described anatomical structures, the optic lobes (Strausfeld, 1970, 1976) and is specialized with respect to the naturally-occurring types of visual inputs a fly experiences as it flies through the world 18 (Krapp and Hengstenberg, 1996; O'Carroll et al., 1996). In particular, a combination of behavioral, anatomical, and electrophysiological analyses have provided a wealth of information on how visual systems can process inputs and generate appropriate motor outputs, including details of the system from the first sensory receptors (Jarvilehto and Settler, 1973) to the descending neurons, motor neurons, and muscles controlling behavior (Strausfeld et al., 1987; Gronenberg and Strausfeld, 1990; Gronenberg et al., 1995; Gilbert et al., 1995). From these neuroethological approaches basic neurobiological principles, such as the relevancy of action potential timing in information processing (du Ruyter Van Steveninck and Bialek, 1995), the influence of locomotive behaviors on the evolution of visual neuronal morphology (Buschbeck and Strausfeld, 1996, 1997), and the requisite of a correlation-type detector for directional motion processing (Reichart, 1961; Borst and Egelhaaf, 1989), have been revealed. Much study has been devoted to revealing principles of motion processing in the fly visual system (reviews: Egelhaaf et al., 1988; Borst and Egelhaaf, 1989). Little information, however, is available regarding the processing of other types of visual inputs, including color, orientation, and textiu-e.

Entomologists in the past need to manually collect moth samples, take digital photos, identify the species, and archive into different categories. This process is time-consuming and requires a lot of human labors. As modern technologies in computer vision and machine learning advance, new algorithms have been developed in recognizing objects in digital images based on their visual attributes. The methods can also be applied to the entomology domain for recognizing biological identities. The Lepidoptera (moths and butterflies) in general can be identified and classified by their body morphological features; wing visual patterns that can be obtained using various image processing approaches in automated diagnostic systems. In this chapter, we describe a system for automated moth species identification and retrieval. The core of the system is a probabilistic model that infers semantically related visual (SRV) attributes from low-level visual features of the moth images in the training set, where moth wings are segmented into information-rich patches from which the local features are extracted, and the SRV attributes are provided by human experts as ground-truth. For the testing images in the database, an automated identification process is evoked to translate the detected salient regions of low-level visual features on the moth wings into meaningful semantic SRV attributes. We further propose a novel network analysis-based approach to explore and utilize the co-occurrence patterns of SRV attributes as contextual cues to improve individual attribute detection accuracy. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is evaluated in automated moth identification and attribute-based image retrieval. In addition, a novel image descriptor called SRV attribute signature is introduced to record the visual and semantic properties of an image and is used to compare image similarity. Experiments are performed on an existing entomology database to illustrate the capabilities of our proposed system.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Identification and Retrieval of Moth Images Based on Wing Patterns","doi":"10.1007/978-3-319-23724-4_19","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-23724-4_19","venue":""}

XICS is able to determine plasma flow profiles by measuring the Doppler shift of x-ray line emission from highly charged impurity species. A novel design is described that uses an x-ray tube with a cadmium anode placed in front of the diffracting spherically bent crystal. This arrangement provides calibration lines over the full detector extent for both the Ar16+ and Ar17+/Fe24+ spectrometer channels. This calibration system can provide a relative wavelength accuracy of 3 × 10-7 Å across the full spatial extent of the detector, which corresponds to 50 m/s in the W7-X system. An absolute wavelength calibration of 1 × 10-5 Å is expected, corresponding to 1 km/s, based on the current known accuracy of the calibration wavelength and the achievable measurement of the absolute positioning of the hardware. This calibration system can be used to independently calibrate XICS systems on both stellarators and tokamaks, without the need for special plasma conditions often used for calibration, such as locked modes on tokamaks. Experimental and simulated results are shown along with expected results, and the complete design of the calibration hardware that is to be installed in the W7-X XICS system.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://pure.mpg.de/rest/items/item_3009542_3/component/file_3010532/content","https://fusion.gat.com/conference/event/80/contributions/397/contribution.pdf"],"title":"In situ wavelength calibration system for the X-ray Imaging Crystal Spectrometer (XICS) on W7-X.","doi":"10.1063/1.5038809","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1063/1.5038809","venue":"The Review of scientific instruments"}

To define the role of TNF-alpha on leukocyte populations during CPB, pigs (n = 6) were pretreated with 20 mg TNF-alpha monoclonal murine antibody before normothermic CPB (2 hr) in a blinded prospective randomized study with saline used as a control (n = 6). The leukocyte response to CPB was measured at 10, 30, 60, and 120 min during CPB and at 60 and 120 min after CPB. Repeated measures analysis of variance was performed and the null hypothesis was discarded at the 5% level. The control group displayed the typical leukocyte profile associated with CPB: and initial leukopenia (36% reduction) followed by leukocytosis (11% increase, P = 0.0001). The initial leukopenia was due to a fall in both polymorphonuclear neutrophils (33% reduced, P < 0.05) and monocytes (37% reduced, P < 0.05). In the TNF-alpha monoclonal murine antibody group the total leukocyte profile did not change significantly from baseline, (8.7% reduction to a 16% increase, P = 0.24) nor were there significant changes in populations including neutrophils and lymphocytes. In the treatment group the initial reduction in monocytes was prevented and total circulating monocytes increased during bypass. The experimental data suggest that TNF-alpha may play an important role in the early alterations in leukocyte populations associated with CPB, and TNF-alpha monoclonal murine antibody pretreatment ameliorates the leukocyte response.","inCitations":["7fcdaaf6b416a4fb236cc862ad22a7741202307e","d0b0cc1cd7fd635c1d536d8100a4bf99a6437706","7f73b71e3b8114b15fd03476840a72a586b5b55c","d5fececbde188642af32988840be120d3cc96566"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Tumor necrosis factor monoclonal antibody prevents alterations in leukocyte populations during cardiopulmonary bypass.","doi":"10.1097/00002480-199407000-00060","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1097/00002480-199407000-00060","venue":"ASAIO journal"}

En este trabajo se estudia como afecta una textura simulada a las tolerancias visuales supra-umbrales y a la medida de color. Se ha utilizado un monitor CRT color para presentar las muestras con textura simulada. La textura esta formada por una distribucion de puntos aleatorios sobre las muestras. Se ha estudiado la influencia del grosor de estos puntos, de la superficie de la muestra ocupada por la textura, y de las coordenadas de color de los puntos de la textura.

A polycarboxylate superplasticizer was used to improve the dispersion of GO flakes in the cement. The mechanical strength of graphene-cement nanocomposites containing 0.1–2 wt% GO and 0.5 wt% superplasticizer was measured and compared with that of cement prepared without GO. We found that the tensile strength of the cement mortar increased with GO content, reaching 1.5%, a 48% increase in tensile strength. Ultra high-resolution field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) used to observe the fracture surface of samples containing 1.5 wt% GO indicated that the nano GO flakes were well dispersed in the matrix, and no aggregates were observed. FE-SEM observation also revealed good bonding between the GO surfaces and the surrounding cement matrix. In addition, XRD diffraction data showed growth of the calcium silicate hydrates (C-S-H) gels in GO cement mortar compared with the normal cement mortar. Growths of the calcium silicate hydrates (C-S-H) gels causes reduce in permeability and consequently improvement in durability of the cement composite.","inCitations":["f9a41814585b203df0be43f7a8c03cc377b683df"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.ijte.ir/article_7874_5f41230ce5b2ff38d0c250597c30aec5.pdf"],"title":"The Influence of Graphene Oxide on Mechanical Properties and Durability Increase of Concrete Pavement","doi":"10.22119/ijte.2014.7874","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.22119/ijte.2014.7874","venue":""}

There is, instead, a straw-man caricature most economists absorb through a form of academic osmosis but which is never specifically taught, not even as part of a course in the history of economics. The paper outlines the crucial features that differentiate modern macroeconomics from classical theory, with the emphasis on what an economist would have understood as The General Theory was being published. Based on the differences outlined, a model of classical economic theory is presented which explains how pre-Keynesian economists understood the operation of the economy, the causes of recession and why a public-spending stimulus was universally rejected by mainstream economists before 1936. The classical model presented is an amalgam of the final edition of John Stuart Mill’s 1848 Principles of Political Economy published in his lifetime and Henry Clay’s influential 1916 Economics: an Introduction for the General Reader, a text which was itself built from the economics of Mill.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Classical Economics Explained: Understanding Economic Theory Before Keynes","doi":"10.2139/ssrn.2854634","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.2854634","venue":""}

This problem is closely related to the mathematical problem of searching for an adversary on a graph. Prior methods in the literature treat multi-agent search as either a worst-case problem (i.e. clear an environment of an adversarial evader with potentially infinite speed), or an average-case problem (i.e. minimize average capture time given a model of the target’s motion). Both of these problems have been shown to be NP-hard, and optimal solutions typically scale exponentially in the number of searchers. We propose treating search as a resource allocation problem, which leads to a scalable anytime algorithm for generating schedules that clear the environment of a worst-case adversarial target and have good average-case performance considering a non-adversarial motion model. Our algorithm yields theoretically bounded average-case performance and allows for online and decentralized operation, making it applicable to real-world search tasks. We validate our proposed algorithm through a large number of experiments in simulation and with a team of robot and human searchers in an office building.","inCitations":["fd250572a60c649fc1711bc84b7fcef8ec6b38d1","2149459526d6382daa335bd5f7558daef7a6770e","8e7a716f579125153035b7980c73987ece439e90","916e8e75434e67626fd0fb1c875d4aa5a74ec194","548bc97315a71d1f500487bb5983a25674389e36","0df4c317bf1647cc1789b1f03c4cf0574b7a38e7","49408cfc908fdb9508a50d9326027c7026360869","bd34a7eebab0b8bb926f1208308828c7944b2c20","fec6dabcd55aa606eb9cb355a1c590d9c2544c7e","d912e3aff5ac1baaf1d56fdace81c97c4cbeb405","83eebd5f5bc235b735b87d22763de475c1bb9461","a60c906bed04d2153dadfd2735957ad1f9406467","b6e487b67f8439e38a98242bcb2e7e0d9ae42a8f","4243fa4211aacf6e1175beed084167e67a27d8e7","a3630039be002e30d3ae5170098edf164aa079f9","61647d40b4dda17ee087a90914086161408a0836","fff9906aa347fb9d36ca7d1cea38f3489134eb52","18cf0d76a7a04aff12fcd256ecff79930be0e15f","bd2a6ada944700510b05063e7dc745a090634144","ae134a748f1154cb0d34b13d158a679887f68ee1","1420b4b0ee55a872769b8aa8163c61fb0515eb98","161fd28bb200a692c2202c983e0a3ed31e7f86a0","641b6f1373432e59e9f82ea09917adbabf1e6f11","2670768f10d535b3ad7d7dd0fd5937863e6aa2bc","44a084ffb1d7197c81623ed53d821ec44c842a05"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.ri.cmu.edu/pub_files/2010/7/HollingerIJRR10.pdf","https://users.auth.gr/kehagiat/Papers/journal/2010IJRR.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1177/0278364910369949","http://repository.cmu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1940&context=robotics","http://users.auth.gr/users/7/8/007287/public_html/KehPub/journal/2010IJRR.pdf","http://users.auth.gr/~kehagiat/kehPub/journal/2010IJRR.pdf"],"title":"Improving the Efficiency of Clearing with Multi-agent Teams","doi":"10.1177/0278364910369949","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1177/0278364910369949","venue":"I.
