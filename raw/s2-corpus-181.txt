As a starting point, it assumes that understanding people’s behaviour related to climate change (mitigation and adaptation) is crucial for successfully dealing with the future challenges. Climate change-related behaviour includes voting, support for climate lobbyists, individual consumption, adapting new technology, and taking adaptive actions. A framework model is presented that assumes the following psychological processes to be relevant for people’s climate related behaviour (1) experiencing climate change, (2) developing an understanding for climate change, (3) building up knowledge about climate change, (4) emotionally reacting to climate change, (5) the perception of risk, (6) making behavioural decisions, and (7) evaluating behavioural outcomes. Based on psychological theory and empirical findings, it is argued that climate change possesses certain features that make it hard for laypeople to develop an understanding, build correct knowledge, and react emotionally. Furthermore, explanations are presented for why the risk of climate change has a rather low perception among laypeople, and what possible factors there are that interfere with individual mitigation and adaptation. Finally, based on the presented findings, suggestions for climate policy are made.","inCitations":["12592f7730103c911bde60f8bf95f30987ae6a92","b7d184b22e3b2d0c71c024abb4dd09504b466359","fff6ace1dd60480dce0f7b3ba995fbebd1ba4283","a80f6b7f528121428ffbfc84197cc4f030b8ab0e","926b379e3a74f49eb4a74ff2110e0edcd5082e2f","aad002d023b2ae1c3db36260e095731fd2b8321f","cbbca4a50cd0d4b166722d74cc5ce57debaa9290"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Towards a Psychology of Climate Change","doi":"10.1007/978-3-642-14776-0_11","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-14776-0_11","venue":""}

However, frameworks are complex and hard to master, and it remains an open problem to find a cost-effective solution for documenting them. This paper presents the case-based approach of FrameDoc to framework documentation and reuse. By means of explicit knowledge representation and CBR, FrameDoc assists a novel user of the framework in the process of building new applications, by maintaining a case base of previous framework instantiations where relevant past cases can be retrieved and reused. The approach proposes both a methodology for framework documentation, and a tool that helps the user when reusing a framework through the knowledge represented in the documentation.","inCitations":["81ce35805ab7c3935446ae099e99abf0d396c3eb","008a6736c73b6ed8c26d504d27065bac3aa75ea1"],"pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-540-27799-6_26"],"title":"Developing Active Help for Framework Instantiation Through Case-Based Reasoning","doi":"10.1007/978-3-540-27799-6_26","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-540-27799-6_26","venue":"ICSR"}

Challenge tests are considered to be the diagnostic gold standard. The aim of this study was to identify subgroups of patients with very low risk for reactions who could be safely tested using a more rapid and simple procedure.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA total of 580 consecutively referred adult patients with a history of non-serious cutaneous allergic reactions to penicillin, but with no IgE, were challenged with therapeutic doses of penicillin V (phenoxymethylpenicillin), penicillin G (benzylpenicillin), or both.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOnly 14 of 580 patients had a positive challenge test. In 11 of the 14, a reaction to challenge occurred within 2 hours, and none were anaphylactic. The year of the original reaction was known for 555 patients; a positive challenge was seen in only 0.4% of those with an original reaction >15 years before challenge, but in 4.6% of those with a more recent original reaction (P=0.001). Onset of a reaction within the first day of the original exposure was a predictive factor for a positive challenge (P=0.001) in patients challenged within 15 years of the original reaction.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAmong suspected penicillin-allergic patients with non-severe skin reactions and no detectable specific IgE, the subgroup of patients who originally reacted more than 15 years previously had very low risk for reacting to a challenge. The risk was higher in patients with a more recent original reaction, especially if the symptoms had occurred within the first day of exposure.","inCitations":["6112fe9725eab033fd90663ec06240f12814e22a","9890e8f0c1fcec0e38a5c48712425c182dee1a03","4772d3c3ed61c587aa5dde48d03fb8548bee4e32"],"pdfUrls":["https://synapse.koreamed.org/Synapse/Data/PDFData/0166AAIR/aair-3-118.pdf","http://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/pmc/8e/85/aair-3-118.PMC3062790.pdf","ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/pmc/8e/85/Allergy_Asthma_Immunol_Res_2011_Apr_14_3(2)_118-122.tar.gz"],"title":"Challenge Test Results in Patients With Suspected Penicillin Allergy, but No Specific IgE","doi":"10.4168/aair.2011.3.2.118","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.4168/aair.2011.3.2.118","venue":"Allergy, asthma & immunology research"}

Methods: 49 patients with thromboangitis obliterans resulting in CLI were treated with a composition of concentrated bone marrow nucleated cells. A total of 240 mL of aspirate was processed using a point of care centrifuge (Harvest Technologies, Plymouth, MA) to yield 40 mL of treating volume. The patients were divided equally into two treatment groups. Group 1 received forty 1 mL direct intramuscular injections in the ischemic regions below the knee and Group 2 received twenty 1 mL direct intramuscular injections below the knee and an intra-arterial infusion of 20 mL down the SFA into the lower leg. An evaluation of these patients was conducted at 12 and 26 weeks. Results: All patients enrolled were men with the following demographics: mean age 44.9, all smokers. There were six adverse events in each treatment group. None were considered to be related to the biologic treatment. No patients died. Limb salvage was 87.5% and all major endpoints showed statistically significant improvement over baseline: Quality of Life assessment (Rand-36 questionnaire) p 0.0009; perception of pain p 0.0001; TcPO2 and ABI measurement p 0.0001 & p 0.0003 respectively. There was 100% reduction in pain medications. Mean number of nucleated cells delivered 3.63x10. The delivery method showed no statistical difference. Conclusions: Based on these results, this bone marrow composition may be considered safe and has shown potential to reduce amputation rates. This study has also shown that both the methods of delivery are equally effective and safe.","inCitations":["16a9cfcf1145759f3b48c8d7c3fb05446b0841f3"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"SS2.

Although the technique is often promoted for the molecular information it delivers in a label free and cost effective fashion, other advantages can emerge compared to the gold standard analytical tools such as liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry. The present study demonstrates how ATR-IR measurements enable accurate quantitative analysis of an active cosmetic ingredient such as Omegalight® encapsulated in a complex alginate based nano-capsule. The study demonstrates how precise concentrations can be obtained without the requirement for fastidious extraction and separation protocols prior to ATR-IR analysis. However, data mining remains a crucial aspect with particular emphasis on the preprocessing of the data that will be subjected to Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR) analysis. Therefore, different pre-processing methods have been evaluated to investigate the relationship between corrections applied and PLSR outcomes (i.e. precision, ratio of performance to deviation (RPD) and accuracy of the analysis). Ultimately, it has been found that, against all expectations, some of the preprocessing methods do not necessarily lead to improvements in the end result, while Extended Multiplicative Scattering Correction (EMSC) is the only one which delivers satisfying results, as defined by a Root Mean Square Error (RMSEV) of 0.07% (w/w) and a RPD greater than 30 when performing analysis over the range 0.4-8.2% (w/w).

Between September 2006 and June 2010, 29 consecutive adult patients with hematological malignancies were treated with UCBT, Thirteen of them were advanced-stage disease and 11 of them were high risk or refractory disease. All patients received four fractionated 12 Gy TBI, total dose 12 g/m 2 cytarabine and total dose 120 mg/kg cyclophosphamide as myeloablative conditioning. The median age was 21 years; the median weight was 57 kg. Double or multiple UCB grafts were used for 17 patients, while single UCB graft for 12 patients. the median number of nucleated cells was 3.83×10 7 /kg and 5.25×10 7 /kg. All patients were given a combination of cyclosporine A (CsA) and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) for graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis. All patients obtained engraftment. Median time to neutrophil≥0.5×10 9 /L was 20 days (range 14–37) and platelet engraftment in 25 patients (≥20×10 9 /L) was 35 days (range 25–49). Chimerism was assessed by PCR analysis of short tandem repeat (STR) sequences on whole blood or bone marrow weekly in cases who were fully donor chimeric from 7 days to 21 days after transplantation. 16 cases developed acute GVHD, more than grade II in three cases. Six of twenty-four patients who survived more than 100 days developed limited chronic GVHD.17 cases were alive and in hematologic remission at a median follow-up of 504 days (range 49 ~ 1245). The probability of over survival at 3 years was 58.6%. Five cases relapsed. Nine of twelve cases died of transplant related complications and infection. These results suggest that UCBT after TBI-based myeloablative conditioning could be safely and effectively used for adult patients with hematologic malignancies.

As part of ongoing post hoc analyses of potential mechanisms for this finding, we explored whether on-treatment A1C itself had an independent relationship with mortality.\n\n\nRESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS\nParticipants with type 2 diabetes (n = 10,251 with mean age 62 years, median duration of diabetes 10 years, and median A1C 8.1%) were randomly assigned to treatment strategies targeting either A1C <6.0% (intensive) or A1C 7.0-7.9% (standard). Data obtained during 3.4 (median) years of follow-up before cessation of intensive treatment were analyzed using several multivariable models.\n\n\nRESULTS\nVarious characteristics of the participants and the study sites at baseline had significant associations with the risk of mortality. Before and after adjustment for these covariates, a higher average on-treatment A1C was a stronger predictor of mortality than the A1C for the last interval of follow-up or the decrease of A1C in the first year. Higher average A1C was associated with greater risk of death. The risk of death with the intensive strategy increased approximately linearly from 6-9% A1C and appeared to be greater with the intensive than with the standard strategy only when average A1C was

By linking internal layers within individual flight-lines at crossover points, it is possible to identify spatiallycontinuouslayersthatareinterpretedas isochronoussurfaces. Severalof thesur- vey lines pass over the GRIP core site, and this allows us to use the published GRIPage^ depth relationship to accurately date these surfaces. Two layers, with ages of 3891 and 6956years BP, have been traced over a large part of North Greenland. Accurately dated and spatially continuous isochrones are valuable for both assimilation within, and verifi- cation of, numerical models. Forexample, comparison of isochronous surfaces from a nu- merical simulation with those layers observed in RES data can be used to inform the choice of parameters (e.g. rheology) and climate history usedto force a numerical model. To demonstrate the potential of the RES data, two layers for North Greenlandwere used to determine palaeo-accumulation rates.The inversion from layer depthto accumulation rate requires a three-dimensional velocity field.This velocity field is constructed by com- biningatwo-dimensionalbalance-velocity fieldwithanassumedverticalstructureforthe horizontal velocity. The isochronous-layer derived accumulation rates were compared with the Bales and others (2001) rates. A larger east^west gradient was found across the central ice divide for the derived accumulation rate, suggesting a trend in the Holocene accumulation rates for this region.The layers were also compared with isochronous sur- faces derived from simulations of a three-dimensional thermodynamic ice-sheet model. Using the isochronous-layer derived accumulation rates to force the model improved the matchbetween modelled and observed layers.","inCitations":["8fc7ea29eda8e742306945aa068b74531c3a8cc4","07a230806032c15cb3f52a9d7a44ff7a3bd48dbd","d631d2ae8e35699c1b75ae6ea66fd9ae2cf02dd7","6eb3c80c4cdc929c5f032d62cd773a2914bf6830","a72015e9899a19315591b346d77ba547abfd7639","3461086d591649d87cdc405880969c635b9f0f0e","b3843492a9612421fea64688b6e0db61e5d3251a","2eb64f0eecba52ad10dee0f9d9c6f22c36881b85","1742e25f39081b5e3e286c584d67c9562398fcf5","2c8de5bf4fe1500849753b7717ba7aef9f1f51da","fbaa84f44d7c6a1c2c991e80ef0cfd765dc3aeb1"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.ggy.bris.ac.uk/personal/TonyPayne/pdfs/baldwin_etal_ag_2003.pdf"],"title":"Using internal layers from the Greenland ice sheet, identified from radio-echo sounding data, with numerical models","doi":"10.3189/172756403781815438","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.3189/172756403781815438","venue":""}

The study consisted of a convenience sample of college-aged students in various types of romantic relationships (i.e. dating, long distance, engaged, and casual or “friends with benefits”). Our hypothesis stated that men with high verbal emotional expression would experience higher relationship satisfaction; however, our analysis of the survey responses of the participants (n=103) indicated that this was not the case, as men who reported high verbal emotional expression also reported lower relationship satisfaction. The findings also revealed: generally, males have a more positive perspective of their own intimacy in relationships while women have a more negative perception of their own intimacy and under the category of emotional expressivity, men self-reported higher for verbal and nonverbal affection while women self-reported higher for supportiveness.","inCitations":["64f4c73339e1f4abbe668c56f8057433807c7ba1","329ede3aa018a34ff86298ff8605991027cfaefe"],"pdfUrls":["https://digitalcommons.pepperdine.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1040&context=pjcr"],"title":"Gender Differences in Intimacy, Emotional Expressivity, and Relationship Satisfaction","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Additionally, it is often unexpected, especially in children, and can injure important nervous structures of the craniocervical region. Over the years, a broad spectrum of algorithms, innovative technologies and therapeutic options have been developed to reduce the incidence of hemorrhages and improve therapy. Nowadays, close cooperation with an hemostaseologist, anesthesiologist and interventional radiologist is necessary for finding the best strategies for the management of bleeding disorders and vascular lesions. This interdisciplinary dialog, combined with an intimate knowledge of the specific otolaryngological techniques, is the precondition for finding an adequate therapy and fulfilling the increasing medico-judicial and economic requirements. We present an overview of the actual and proved concepts for the management of hemorrhage in order to enable the reader to optimize treatment, to increase safety and comfort for the bleeding patient, and to fulfill the medico-judicial and economic requirements.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Prevention and therapy of hemorrhage in the HNO region.

Attention is paid to the identification of cable hybrid modes due to system asymmetry, which gives rise to an avoidance phenomenon in the natural frequency spectrum, and to the investigation of some typical 3-D nonlinear dynamics involving the simultaneous parametric/external excitation due to a harmonically time-varying support movement. Large-amplitude out-of-plane/in-plane multi-modal interactions due to non-planar/planar internal resonances are experimentally observed and complemented by space-time numerical simulation of the associated, geometrically nonlinear, partial-differential equations of parametrically-forced cable motion. Overall, the experimental and num erical results highlight the fundamental linear/nonlinear dynamic characteristics of inclined cables, and the crucial role played by the asymmetry induced by cable inclination, in addition to the significant effects of cable sag and dynamic extensibility.","inCitations":["cf044b44705633f773a631cb491edf60cf261b15","ad0ca6571070bd1837d3fdd3db138f6bf22098e2","6e0387f19df335c719764414c27d94b9080b20ca","1b4515327056867f6c69e82ffa7f7c56ee7c1126","45100c2b93090a02c551289be30c240d564f5592","65128a79086862dfd933257f2e0637597a8b215a","b02bc3cc846d0158c44cfbdc289cb93ddb081cfe","6b2f1edbec59a6d07f2188b690e068312b3530ef"],"pdfUrls":["https://strathprints.strath.ac.uk/18551/1/strathprints018551.pdf"],"title":"Experimental and numerical studies of inclined cables: free and parametrically-forced vibrations","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Cloning experiments demonstrated that the Os-J tumor is heterogeneous with regard to the production of experimental pulmonary metastases. Immunization-challenge studies in syngeneic mice and comparisons of tumor growth in normal or nude mice established that the slow growing Os-J tumor is poorly immunogenic.In vitro studies demonstrated that the Os-J tumor is highly susceptible to macrophages-mediated lysis. This may explain the slow growth of the tumor in normal recipients with an intact mononuclear phagocyte system, as compared with the more rapid emergence of tumors in macrophage-suppressed mice. However, spontaneous metastases of the Os-J tumor were not observed either in normal or macrophage-suppressed mice. Although a high macrophage infiltration of neoplasms could slow tumor growth, this was not associated with the immunogenicity of the neoplasm and did not appear to limit the spontaneous metastasis of this essentially benign neoplasm.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Relationship of macrophage content, immunogenicity, and metastatic potential of a murine osteosarcoma of recent origin","doi":"10.1007/BF01758954","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/BF01758954","venue":"Clinical & Experimental Metastasis"}

Therefore, we must take sever consequences e.g. pollution of aquatic environment, water scarcity, causing depletion of fossil resources, degradation of agricultural land, intensive energy use, high cost and spread of water-borne disease . Unfortunately, Agenda 21 failed to promote waste reuse and recycling methods related to sanitation, although water and fertile land are core subjects of survival of the future generation ( Otterpohl et al., 1999 ).

Therefore, increased levels of IL-5 in the bone marrow is associated with increased eosinophil numbers in blood. In addition, IL-5 increases the sensitivity ofeosinophils towards other stimuli and delays their cell death. In contrast to other cytokines, IL-5 acts on a limited number of cells only. In fact, high-affinity IL-5 receptors are exclusively expressed by eosinophils and basophils, but no other human cells. Therefore, neutralization of IL-5 appears to be an obvious approach to treat eosinophilic disorders, since no major side effects due to effects on other cells are expected. Results from animal experiments suggested that anti-IL-5 antibodies may have anti-asthmatic activities.

Recent biological research reveals that secretory proteins (SPs) are considered paramount antigenic agent in developing drugs and vaccines for the treatment of TB. Owing to its biological importance, traditional experimental approaches are used for identification of secretory proteins in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB). However, these methods for predicting SPs are costly, slow and challenging due to the abundance of the unknown sequence generated in the post-genomic era. Therefore, it is high precision by incorporating unbiased evolutionary profile and discrete feature spaces with various machine learning algorithms including support vector machine, k-nearest neighbour, probabilistic neural network, and generalised regression neural network. Also, imbalance issue occurs in SPs training dataset which causes classification error, to tackle this dilemma a very well-known resampling technique synthetic minority oversampling technique was adopted. The presented method, achieved satisfactory outcomes in term of accuracy (ACC) 97.0%, sensitivity (Sen) 99.24%, specificity (Spe) 92.53% and Mathews correlation coefficient (MCC) 0.932 using jackknife test. It is demonstrated that the new model remarkably outperformed the existing state-of-the-art approaches.

Endogenous and exogenous cannabinoids mediate their effects through activation of specific cannabinoid receptors. This modulatory homoeostatic system operates in the regulation of brain function and also in the periphery. The cannabinoid system has been shown to be involved in regulating the immune system. Studies examining the effect of cannabinoid-based drugs on immunity have shown that many cellular and cytokine mechanisms are modulated by these agents, thus raising the hypothesis that these compounds may be of value in the management of chronic inflammatory diseases. The special properties of endocannabinoids as neurotransmitters, their pleiotropic effects and the impact on immune function show that the endocannabinoid system represents a revolving plate of neural and immune interactions. In this paper, we outline current information on immune effects of cannabinoids in health and disease.","inCitations":["2fd6bca8d0551a946aa8c153a220d072fc188657","7692faa54f0a51b45e71294177347afae4abe3d3","7985c4e1fb06c7fd38fcce102445b6ca25308438","fed97a2bfad0506dd6755a5c06a8ce41d368df09","956d1eb31dc2563183abed84a23a83cc5f3c6984","48e2e2a184ef1ec520a4f3537809e2eab7e5c073","716b1e48934f8f0b82bfc9f28ba216425c691055","fcaa4152471b62c2f4ba550bb76abe720b1ae3ac"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"The endocannabinoid system: a revolving plate in neuro-immune interaction in health and disease","doi":"10.1007/s00726-012-1252-8","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00726-012-1252-8","venue":"Amino Acids"}

The selection of the duration of the CPI, also known as the coherent processing time window length (CPTWL), is critical because it should be short enough to limit the blurring caused by the 3-D rotational motion and long enough to ensure that the desired cross-range resolution is obtained. This paper proposes an algorithm, referred to as the motion-aided CPTWL selector (MACS) algorithm, which selects suitable CPTWLs for ISAR imaging of cooperative sea vessels. The suggested CPTWLs may be used to obtain motion-compensated ISAR images that have the desired medium cross-range resolution and limited blurring due to 3-D rotational motion. The proposed algorithm is applied to measured motion data of three different classes of sea vessels: a yacht, a fishing trawler, and a survey vessel. Results show that longer CPTWLs are needed for larger vessels in order to obtain ISAR images with the desired cross-range resolution. The effectiveness of the CPTWLs, suggested by the MACS algorithm, is shown using measured radar data. The suggested CPTWLs may also be used to select an effective initial CPTWL for Martorella/Berizzi's optimum imaging selection algorithm when it is applied to measured radar data of small vessels. Lastly, the proposed technique offers significant computational savings for radar cross section measurement applications where a few high-quality ISAR images are desired from long radar recordings.","inCitations":["07302ba661aaa4735dd81748589acb5dde595015","1a75259978e83ad8c9be6bc6a6e844d9920c83c5","20ee88c14fba301c9bc3fa9ad7642f716c2bccff","f2a42c047f171db1b60e371da136937eecad28ae","e285054050af97e555f8694ed401fefae11139e5","22e61c8f23f054fe5818051c5e8e9192835fee96","9986fb9df8877290072a8bb42f12829b5aff7605","46f8c2ff5ef99eac6266415632bcf991b1b0fad6","0afee771b5c6746c190a9c6040a08faf6e0413a3","1c4af510e7ed62cffcce11fd9d41b36646e1e65f","f0d58d0ac2caea8d5c9b1c1a2c7f63c967e2e01c","400a94e517b46a4d262bfbeb74d7695892492170","5b1d853c118a11e932726166d6b78e32c63de3f3","7338a986e8ff035cbd14b6926285ccfb68d1c9fc"],"pdfUrls":["http://researchspace.csir.co.za/dspace/bitstream/handle/10204/3613/abdul%20gaffar_d1_2009.pdf;jsessionid=1E508ED96A2F2F414C7185E5B04F2526?sequence=1","https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2009.2019729","http://www.researchgate.net/profile/W_Nel/publication/224501870_Selecting_Suitable_Coherent_Processing_Time_Window_Lengths_for_Ground-Based_ISAR_Imaging_of_Cooperative_Sea_Vessels/links/00b7d52ce53d6f2a92000000.pdf"],"title":"Selecting Suitable Coherent Processing Time Window Lengths for Ground-Based ISAR Imaging of Cooperative Sea Vessels","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2009.2019729","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2009.2019729","venue":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing"}

Pregnancies with multiple gestations and major fetal anomalies were excluded. The primary outcome was a composite of maternal and neonatal morbidity and was estimated to be 50% in superobese women based on institutional data. A sample size of 338 women determined the study period and was selected to show a 30% difference in the incidence of the primary outcome between the two groups. Multivariate logistic regression adjusted for potential confounders.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThere were 344 women with BMIs of 50 or greater who met eligibility criteria, of whom 201 (58%) labored and 143 (42%) underwent planned cesarean delivery. Women who labored were younger, more likely to be nulliparous, and less likely to have pre-existing diabetes. Among women who labored, 45% underwent a cesarean delivery, most commonly for labor arrest (61%) or nonreassuring fetal status (28%). Composite maternal and neonatal morbidity was reduced among women who labored even after adjusting for age, parity, pre-existing diabetes, and prior cesarean delivery (adjusted odds ratio 0.42, 95% CI 0.24-0.75). In the subgroup of women (n=234) who underwent a cesarean delivery, whether planned (n=143) or after labor (n=91), there were no differences in maternal and neonatal morbidity except that severe maternal morbidity was increased in women (n=12) who labored (8.8% compared with 2.1%, relative risk 4.2, 95% CI 1.14-15.4).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nDespite high rates of cesarean delivery in women with superobesity, labor is associated with lower composite maternal and neonatal morbidity. Severe maternal morbidity may be higher in women who require a cesarean delivery after labor.","inCitations":["c4f5e8795b0f9c13251d2957b2b08f455aa29d7e"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Trial of Labor Compared With Cesarean Delivery in Superobese Women.","doi":"10.1097/AOG.0000000000002257","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1097/AOG.0000000000002257","venue":"Obstetrics and gynecology"}

A number of studies show that severe burns cause infertility from poor sperm production. The pathways leading to such infertility are not well understood, and it is not known how the severity of injury affects this post-burn infertility (PBI). We evaluated the relationship between sperm parameters and indices of burn severity, such as burn surface area and depth in 19 adults. Total sperm counts ranged from 0 to 160 million/ml, with a mean of 19.58+/-7.52 million/ml. About 60% of the subjects had total counts of 20 million/ml or less, falling into the clinically oligospermic range. We found only a weak correlation between infertility and both burn depth and burn surface area. There was, however, a fairly strong positive correlation between infertility and length of time between injury and participation in the study. The correlation coefficient was 0.560. Our findings suggest that PBI is progressive and not predicted by TBSA. Any measures to control it should be started early and be applied to burn patients across a wide range of clinical severity.","inCitations":["f6836b1f2c05098e0fd68cb954f32c9eb24ab0db","b5624c798370b946cbdc5de49d2fe8fdc42367f0","f3cfd63fa95e69ac762b7d0e9ab10decde1097e4","00d26c89f17ca287d353c37d4fa5e77ebbe1f673","d288ffa4587ae0ce2e7ac4a75c4ffb2eb0ddb067","38a4687dc17f5ed674dc0a4ad33da4a7c94cb8d0"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Burn severity and post-burn infertility in men.","doi":"10.1016/j.burns.2009.05.003","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.burns.2009.05.003","venue":"Burns : journal of the International Society for Burn Injuries"}

This suggests that studying human cognition may be a good way to develop better learning algorithms, as well as providing basic insights into how the human mind works. However, in order for ideas to flow easily from cognitive science to computer science and vice versa, we need a common framework for describing human and machine learning. I will summarize recent work exploring the hypothesis that probabilistic models of cognition, which view learning as a form of statistical inference, provide such a framework, including results that illustrate how novel ideas from statistics can inform cognitive science. Specifically, I will talk about how probabilistic models can be used to identify the assumptions of learners, learn at different levels of abstraction, and link the inductive biases of individuals to cultural universals.","inCitations":["621f899dba1a3beed8751b548342c6bac9b3209e","8dd0cc3fd2d8d1bf2d8bf20acc9631c386e7b4b8","3a3b4c3b6f1e8fc9f2680a75b77415e698d29dc4"],"pdfUrls":["http://cocosci.berkeley.edu/tom/papers/probmods.pdf","http://www.isca-speech.org/archive/interspeech_2009/i09_0009.html","https://cocosci.berkeley.edu/tom/papers/probmods.pdf","http://www.isca-speech.org/archive/archive_papers/interspeech_2009/papers/i09_0009.pdf"],"title":"Connecting human and machine learning via probabilistic models of cognition","doi":"","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"INTERSPEECH"}

Our approach is based on the hypothesis that predictive ke parameters can be obtained by estimating them from a strongly vortical flow, specifically, flow over a square cylinder. In this study, we estimate three ke parameters, C%CE%BC, Ce2 and Ce1 by fitting 2D RANS simulations to experimental data. We use polynomial surrogates of 2D RANS for this purpose. We conduct an ensemble of 2D RANS runs using samples of (C%CE%BC;Ce2;Ce1) and regress Reynolds stresses to the samples using a simple polynomial. We then use this surrogate of the 2D RANS model to infer a joint distribution for the ke parameters by solving a Bayesian inverse problem, conditioned on the experimental data. The calibrated (C%CE%BC;Ce2;Ce1) distribution is used to seed an ensemble of 3D jet-in-crossflow simulations. We compare the ensemble's predictions of the flowfield, at two planes, to PIV measurements and estimate the predictive skill of the calibrated 3D RANS model. We also compare it against 3D RANS predictions using the nominal (uncalibrated) values of (C%CE%BC;Ce2;Ce1), and find that calibration delivers a significant improvement to the predictive skill of the 3D RANS model. Wemore » repeat the calibration using surrogate models based on kriging and find that the calibration, based on these more accurate models, is not much better that those obtained with simple polynomial surrogates. We discuss the reasons for this rather surprising outcome.« less","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://prod-ng.sandia.gov/techlib-noauth/access-control.cgi/2013/138158.pdf","https://cfwebprod.sandia.gov/cfdocs/CompResearch/docs/sand2013-8158.pdf","https://www.sandia.gov/~jairay/Presentations/sand2014-4783C.pdf","https://www.sandia.gov/~jairay/Presentations/sand2014-2429C.pdf"],"title":"Tuning a RANS k-e model for jet-in-crossflow simulations.","doi":"10.2172/1096265","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.2172/1096265","venue":""}

The deficiencies of relying on an extemporaneous model for health policy development are described. Preferably, an evidentiary model, based on the evaluation of clinical research and incorporating professional and public attention to underlying normative issues, should define the standard of care. Appropriate procedural mechanisms should be established at both state and federal levels to prevent the unnecessary confusion, expense, and personal or social harms likely to result from a completely unrestrained application of developing genetic technologies or continuing ad hoc responses to rapid increases in genetic diagnostic capabilities. A broadly constituted national advisory commission on the ethical, legal, and social implications of the Human Genome Project would provide an important locus for national decision making and may offer an efficient mechanism for implementing the evidentiary model, promoting public involvement at a time when social policy decisions must be made to restructure the health care system to be more sensitive to issues of access, allocation, and costs.","inCitations":["1eefc719934d45d37ab4fef8182275896367ec3a","7584b1e252d621386f03db89a546852700c8104d","80e19d84840b4e6adc4e611b0bf4088e98ef7379","9bd4a29da0a3a199b0b87f430d33ac5eb1f48c83","c571534998d913addbced0072cb80ac8313dfd88","d54b16435f7d6e315de883e39b220bafb0286188","fa9c5f2ab9ac7f02971289caca5c5adfd33ac9a2","186fd204549622f4234a96ada2544f39eb738b1f","a6ef769667276858d2f8e87f1345dc940d248ee8","6e58e995ab4d9187b9070ea814e954d077e5854b","23c069bf7498dc262f837e4facd3a6853729ab67","1eea115dd90beea6687ea9b4855c1e5aba9ef3e8","ea967081eebe16d86713913aa0f1806a620bc86a","94c18727285b5127a8a85a9df28d34b5b89131a6","3ab6484177f191c1e34bbaf93f9df94e2064f1e9","fe19606dfafd369a670e6ba44a85ce851c054efb","a7e5a72374ca7224bd90e1f5e8259cab21d3dc81","0a03c01bedf3f6a502039f69d2a2a3687a59ad34","74553f64192bcb6bb524317ee786df0d289a0ac8","8403ef53dde0bcc282b7e108a11de461f92a5f32","b0c614eacb8b340128c93b1ef8e5a2295957a118","94feb8e49f1af9603ca7e3fbb5cd462db21d3076","47a27f05ec287628dc105428592670900dc63807","85419e114b599992f3b4e33f623da971dc84a522","c05ff49221ab812fe7da3e0d48ede1ba12466b97","e2e618d7accc4a8cbef215d09a2cf75ca9463865","ea83743302e194555b00f428d8bc8da71c628d0f","905de57c272aa83e2cfe6f6bf6341d8c1ab07cd6","47f3c9c12eaf734698f8886369cfab361f69c50d","76f243a76cbafee2998362fd7974f48a56486e7a","29eb1eacb8977541cdb80721200732e6ce39db07","57290c2a05b50f1c8468b5665ea8393f94d41c46","48dd99cf997d79247e5ae6cde0f45e3b24026170"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"National policy development for the clinical application of genetic diagnostic technologies.

Data included demographic variables, cluster headache onset and duration, mean attack frequency, mean attack intensity, and pain disability index measures pre- and through 12-mo postsurgery.\n\n\nRESULTS\nSeven of the 9 cases (77.8%) showed immediate improvement. Improvement was delayed by 1 mo in 1 patient, after which the surgical effects of pain relief were maintained throughout the follow-up period. One patient (11.1%) did not improve after surgery. One year after VN, patients' mean attack frequency, mean attack intensity, and pain disability index decreased by 54.5%, 52.9%, and 56.4%, respectively. No patient experienced treatment-related side effects or complications.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nVN is an effective treatment method for CCH patients. Precise Vidian nerve identification and maximal preservation of the sphenopalatine ganglion may achieve good surgical outcomes and dramatically improve quality of life among patients, without significant adverse events.","inCitations":["c1c296deb89e7f3292f52f47501d8ea67f812679","8d9df1ef5e6aa76953f2bad6f5ef6b7afea67d56"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Vidian Neurectomy for Management of Chronic Cluster Headache.","doi":"10.1093/neuros/nyy136","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1093/neuros%2Fnyy136","venue":"Neurosurgery"}

The structural and formal description of business processes is introduced using IDEF3 and an extended AON (activity on node) graph. The analytic model of business process assignment optimization is developed for the resource allocation and activity arrangement optimization at the minimal cost.

Our study of Vegfa conditional knockout (CKO) mice provides new in-vivo evidence for two important functions of VEGFA in bone formation. First, VEGFA plays a significant role in both early and late stages of cartilage vascularization, since Vegfa CKO mice showed delayed invasion of blood vessels into primary ossification centers and delayed removal of terminal hypertrophic chondrocytes. Second, VEGFA is crucial for chondrocyte survival, since massive cell death was seen in joint and epiphyseal regions of Vegfa CKO endochondral bones. Chondrocytes in these regions were found to upregulate expression of Vegfa in wild-type mice at the time when massive cell death occurred in the Vegfa CKO mice. The expression of the VEGFA receptors Npr1 and Npr2 in epiphyseal chondrocytes and lack of blood vessel reduction in the vicinity of the cartilaginous elements in the Vegfa CKO mice raise the possibility that the observed cell death is the result of a direct involvement of VEGFA in chondrocyte survival. Interestingly, the extensive cell death seen in Vegfa CKO null bones had a striking similarity to the cell death phenotype observed when hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (Hif1a) expression was abolished in developing cartilage. This similarity of cell death phenotypes and the deficient VEGFA production in Hif1a null epiphyseal chondrocytes demonstrate that HIF1 alpha and VEGFA are components of a key pathway to support

There were significant differences between the amount of DM, NDF, ADF, Ash contents and DM degradability and also between the amount of degradability parameters of DM, NDF and ADF including rapid degradable portion(a), slow degradable portion (b), constant rate of degradability (c)and effective degradability (ED)in different phenological stages (P<0.01). The results showed that with herb maturity ruminal digestibility of dry matter and degradability parameters of DM, NDF and ADF were significant decreased and DM, NDF and ADF values increased significant (P<0.01). The Highest and lowest amount “a” and “b” parameters of DM were obtained at vegetative stage and seed ripening respectively.

In young women (age <or= 30 years) with family history alone, the incidence of glucose intolerance is similar to that in the low risk pregnant population (12.5% and 6.3% for 8.0 mmol/L and 9.0 mmol/L cut-off for two hour value of 75 g oral glucose tolerance test, respectively). In women aged above 30 years, the incidence of glucose intolerance raised by three fold (35.2% and 22.0% for 8.0 mmol/L and 9.0 mmol/L cut-off, respectively).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe risk of glucose intolerance in young women with positive family history is similar to that in the background pregnant population. Standard oral glucose tolerance test may not be necessary in this group of women if selective screening policy is adopted.","inCitations":["bf3c254105263bd49e0d0840b36cadb88a4160f3","627def468ac8b922d1d88b4068dd0dfd7e121b68","20b00956c39e41c6ec74ccfb3c9105927dd9d12e","2d99593a0656ff3f89f896c577140d34a662fd04"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Diabetic family history is an isolated risk factor for gestational diabetes after 30 years of age.","doi":"10.1034/j.1600-0412.2002.810205.x","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1034/j.1600-0412.2002.810205.x","venue":"Acta obstetricia et gynecologica Scandinavica"}

It is based on a combination of a chemometric data interpretation and a calculation of the minimum standard deviation(STDEV) of experiments. The more favourable concentration range of linear calibration could be obtained by iteration. This condition links the lower limit of analysis(LLA) to an upper limit of analysis(ULA), and thus completes the statistically appropriate extension of the calibration line. In addition, a minimumSTDEVofmeasurementwas expressed in terms of STDEVÂÂs on slope(SiÂi) and on intercept(SiÂ¢) and the calculation was performed by using amodified version of the lawof propagation of errors(LPE). Themethod was validated on experiments of gas chromatography(GC), liquid chromatography(LC), electrochemistry, flow-injection analysis(FIA), atomic emission spectrometry(AES), flame atomic absorption spectrometry (FAAS) and inductively-coupled-plasmamass-spectrometry(ICP-MS). The comparison of theory with experiments suggests that an appropriate concentration range of calibration was obtained by iteration when the intercept decreased to a value below a factor of two of the corresponding standard deviation. The proposed method is uncomplicated and facilitates the determination of the concentration range of calibration and the LLA in one working operation.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Evaluation of the linear calibration in terms of uncertainties","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}
