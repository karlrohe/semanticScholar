Four key insect pests of cowpea � the cowpea aphid,Aphis craccivoraKoch, flower bud thrips, Megalurothrips sjostedti Tryb, legume pod borer, Maruca vitrataFab and coreid bugs were studied. At Asaba, the trials took place in th e Teaching and Research farm of the Agronomy Department, Asaba campus, Delta State University while at Abraka, on a plot of land 50 metres to Campus 2, Delta State University, Abraka. The experiments consisted of five treatments �1, 2 and 3% soap concentr ations, cypermethrin (as check) and a control, all organised into a randomised complete block design (RCBD) with three replications. The results indicated that more insect pests occurred at Asaba than Abraka. Three percent (3%) soap concentration significa ntly (P<0.05) reduced A. craccivoracolonies and slightly prevented M. sjostedtidamage. The present study provides the information that (i) grain yield was high at both locations (ii) yields were significantly (P<0.05 ) higher at Abraka (1102.40kgha -1 ) compared to Asaba (599.40kgha -1 ) and (iii) native soap is an effective insecticide for managing cowpea insect pests. The adoption of native soap in cowpea cultivation by farmers should be encouraged since it readily breaks down, safe and environmentally frien dly.","inCitations":["b8c0510478b8b9e4c10c1f20290371648b4472fc"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Insecticidal Activity of Native Soap on Cowpea ( Vigna Unguiculata (l) Walp) Insect Pests in Asaba and Abraka, Delta State, Nigeria","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

In this paper, we continue a research agenda focusing on testing this premise. We present a study of the context characteristics in a sample of 2006 and 2009 PISA science items and how these characteristics as well as student performance may be related to the cognitive demands of the items. The study was guided by two research questions: (1) What are the cognitive demands of the sampled PISA contextualized items and what is the students’ performance linked to these items? (2) Are the items’ cognitive demands associated with certain characteristics of the contexts of the items that proved to be linked to students’ performance? Using 52 released and secured PISA science items, we captured information about three context dimensions of items (i.e., level of abstraction, resources, and nature of the context) and the cognitive demands of the items. A multinomial logistic regression with cognitive demand as the outcome variable, context characteristics as the predictors, and percent of correct responses as the covariant indicated that certain context characteristics are linked to the cognitive demands of items. For example, we found that items in which contexts involve only concrete ideas were associated with items with low cognitive demands; these items are unlikely to require content knowledge to be responded. We also found that the type of resource (e.g., tables, graphs) was associated with the cognitive demands of the items: schematic representations seem to be linked to items tapping procedural knowledge rather than to items tapping declarative or schematic knowledge. We concluded that further research is needed to better understand the influence that context characteristics have on the cognitive processes in which students are asked to engage and in their performance.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://repositorio.unican.es/xmlui/bitstream/handle/10902/10168/SmartphoneProcesosEnse%C3%B1anza.pdf?isAllowed=y&sequence=3","https://ojs.uv.es/index.php/RELIEVE/article/download/9672/11926"],"title":"Revista ELectrónica de Investigación y EValuación Educativa","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Longitudinal research shows a high level of stability of antisocial behaviour. The present study aims to evaluate an early intervention project to reduce antisocial behavioural problems in at-risk children (4 – 7 years). Parent Management Training (PMT) was chosen because it was evaluated as a promising intervention in previous research. The training is based on social learning principles and teaches parents to manage their child's behaviour through behaviour modification. Parents were randomly assigned to two conditions: an intervention condition (PMT; n = 34) and a waiting list condition (WL; n = 30). The PMT consists of 11 sessions spread over a 6-month period. Parents were trained in groups of 8 – 10 parents. A multi-method multi-informant methodology was designed to evaluate the programme. Measures were assessed before and after treatment and at 1-year follow-up. Both short- and long-term results revealed positive effects of the intervention with respect to the child's behaviour. In addition, parental stress reduced, whereas parental skills and mother – child interactions improved. However, no time by group interaction effects were found. Implementations and limitations of early intervention and prevention of antisocial behaviour are discussed.","inCitations":["2fe3d0fa41b3bdc746a98d5a2138e48b5bb25730","e2d1e73ef311692367265c36e59699d611a82a2d","14f432f388babf4138527e4d37537ea0da8278c5","279c8a643182141a0665d64c19a9608e8d9b5032","23249dcb33138944f0d4ba2161867e6675bb24be","ae3b1e5f161b5f437eb66f9f8d7b14c6f9558e4f","8192ce8ba21db63dc704015e49c40a2638d23b88","92d7b0a78bec7a2d881565408cb76c3f50d189f8"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Prevention of antisocial behaviour: Evaluation of an early intervention programme","doi":"10.1080/17405620601033194","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1080/17405620601033194","venue":""}

The study of Eastern Greek ceramics from Olbia made it possible to date its foundation to 620/610-590 BC. Yet it is well-known that the temporary emporion of Borysthenes was founded in the third quarter of the 7th century BC, about thirty years earlier than the city of Boristhenes. Observing the dynamics of the development of Olbia and Borysthenes one can see that both the city areas, their necropoleis and the surrounding territory developped simultaneously in both cases, the process resulting in the appearance of the Polis of Olbia which included the sea emporion Borysthenes. The same pattern seems to have worked in the case of the Istrian polis consisting of two towns, Istria and Orgame (Argamum), founded in about the same order. Development of poleis including two settlements founded very closely in time is also to be seen at the end of the archaic period, if one comes to think of Niconium and Orphiussa/Tyras in the Low Dniester Area or Kerkinitis and the Pre-Chesonesus settlement in Western Taurica. This could be a model of developing a new community realized in the North-Western Black See area.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"O Греческой Колонизации Северо-западного Причерноморья (новая Модель?)","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

It has traumatic and non-traumatic etiologies. The triad may be found among a vast spectrum of natural diseases. Optic nerve sheath hemorrhage in infants is typically detected at autopsy. It is a nonspecific finding that can be found in traumatic and non-traumatic etiologies. Neither the triad nor the ONSH are pathognomonic for an abusive head injury. Opposite to the triad, the spectrum of non-traumatic etiologies of ONSH is limited. In infants ONSH rarely occurs in spontaneous subarachnoidal hemorrhage or in infectious conditions. Our results show that the clinical significance of the optic nerve sheath hemorrhage in the forensic work-up of fatal cases of alleged abusive head injury is its limited differential diagnosis. Only after careful differential diagnosis ONSH may contribute to the diagnosis of AHT. However, the main limitation of our study is the sampling bias, as the eyes are usually removed when abusive head trauma is suspected.","inCitations":["b916b8a4bee753dfcb28071b0498e8bcdc4dd6e7","41c30a85c5e20437f2b899d5f62515598a89b868"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"The optic nerve sheath hemorrhage is a non-specific finding in cases of suspected child abuse.","doi":"10.1016/j.jflm.2015.08.009","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jflm.2015.08.009","venue":"Journal of forensic and legal medicine"}

A number of studies have shown that near-peers are effective teachers in preclinical courses such as anatomy and physical examination. We hypothesized that near-peers could also be effective teachers in a clinical clerkship. We report on a pilot study in which near-peers participated in a training session and then taught a brief problem-focused skills curriculum to third-year students during a required ambulatory medicine rotation. The clerkship students assigned high ratings to the near-peer teachers, both on an absolute scale and relative to faculty. The results suggest that including near-peers as teachers in a clinical clerkship may be appropriate and that this concept deserves further investigation.","inCitations":["e1f4090380f945e2807281b6bdf4be259e653aad","764b3a5a9a268afe51b42691274b6bf6a39fd5d1","dabc59dc707d27660ff89449809c8ffae79d1cbb","5ad9d8a3f091568baa54b64d3b059a2eb80f1a25","8c2fb0b41c5be7229dd1f394eb50aabc0ed6d3e1","1ed4226ae86f51b26cc254e6b58068656836ed18","e0f797af23abd3cf3f1845dc03d6700b470a9887","5815b31d2c53acbfc3d1204c8a4729476d31d289","0156052579808fe217d38d7089902b68fb4f3876","831676f30cf989fe4731b2d55dd58e06c660d437","7c8e0d52bc0434a61c0b25c96f7ffc658352e380","b06762385f804c074fedcca0dd4cdb4019ed79ce","c17da247c542fcd3133456451058c00699ce7db5","f026cdf3292897189307903b90876e39aa4decf9"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Near-Peer Teaching in a Required Third-Year Clerkship","doi":"","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"The Yale journal of biology and medicine"}

The authors address the hypothesis that shunting of the microcirculation occurs after superior mesenteric artery occlusion (SMAO) and reperfusion, and explore functional consequences.\n\n\nMETHODS\nSpontaneously breathing animals (rats) (n = 30) underwent SMAO for 0 (controls), 30 (SMAO_30) or 60 min (SMAO_60) followed by reperfusion (4 h) with normal saline. Leukocyte-endothelial interactions in mesenteric venules were quantified in an exteriorized ileal loop using intravital microscopy. Abdominal blood flow was recorded continuously, and arterial blood gases were analyzed at intervals. The above groups were matched by comparable groups with continuous superior mesenteric artery blood flow measurements and without exteriorizing an ileal loop (controls*, SMAO_30*, SMAO_60*).\n\n\nRESULTS\nAdherent leukocytes increased shortly after reperfusion in ischemia groups, and plateaued in these groups. Centerline velocity in the recorded venules was significantly reduced after reperfusion down to low-flow/no-flow in SMAO_60 as compared to SMAO_30 and controls, whereas perfusion of the SMA and ileal vessels persisted. The microcirculatory changes in SMAO_60 were accompanied by progressive metabolic acidosis, substantially larger volumes of intravenous fluids needed to support arterial blood pressure and significantly reduced survival (30%). SMA blood flow increased in relation to abdominal blood flow after reperfusion in SMAO_60*, and remained constant in SMAO_30* and controls*. Survival was 80% in SMAO_60*.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nShunting of the microcirculation can be observed after SMAO for 60 min and reperfusion, and contributes significantly to the pathology of mesenteric ischemia and poor outcome.","inCitations":["e1dc65d06d8666e437002c563ed6095742ee129c","ad7c162a50b6ea13bc045a96116c692bb03affc1","651370f9cb6305da8c47c9c42e097619d714ad33","941c2a7ef7fe17fa16f0a222cdb06ec68c6a1e3b","b3bbf798e4c7149e7d825302e3f3328ab294e896","4118d79b4fbbc4045d2419f4d6ad12ba97773c25"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.nc-patho.fb04.uni-mainz.de/Lauterbach2006Microcirculation.pdf","http://www.uni-mainz.de/FB/Medizin/nc-patho/Lauterbach2006Microcirculation.pdf"],"title":"Shunting of the microcirculation after mesenteric ischemia and reperfusion is a function of ischemia time and increases mortality.","doi":"10.1080/10739680600746032","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1080/10739680600746032","venue":"Microcirculation"}

It proposes a quantitative projection of domestic water demand, combined with an original estimation of the economic benefit of water at large scale. The general method consists of building economic demand functions taking into account the impact of the level of equipment, proxied by economic development. The cost and the price of water are assumed to grow with economic development. \n \nThe methodology was applied to the Mediterranean region, at the 2060 horizon. Our results show the evolution of water demand and value, measured by surplus, over time. As long as GDP per capita and water price remain low, demand per capita increases along with economic development, and surplus per capita increases with demand.

Gilchrest","ids":["5246807"]}],"journalName":"The Journal of investigative dermatology","paperAbstract":"Tanning is commonly understood as increased melanization of the epidermis observed in skin following UV exposure. It is further understood to represent a host response that protects against future UV-induced damage. Although best studied in humans, tanning can also be observed in other mammals and even in more primitive animals such as sharks. The molecular basis of tanning was poorly understood well into the 1990s, although UV irradiation of murine melanoma cells had been shown to increase the number of cell surface receptors to a-melanocyte–stimulating hormone (a-MSH) and to increase the melanogenic response to a-MSH via increased protein levels and activity of tyrosinase, the rate-limiting enzyme in melanin synthesis (Bolognia et al., 1989; Chakraborty et al., 1991). However, the initiating molecular events were unknown. Identification of the responsible molecules ultimately evolved from studies of the UV action spectrum for critical events in human skin, as well as from a philosophical appreciation of tanning as a genome protective response. In the 1980s, investigators at Harvard’s Wellman Laboratories exposed normal skin of volunteers to a wide range of light doses using narrow band sources across the UV spectrum and observed them for several days to determine the lowest dose at each wavelength capable of producing a delayed tan (Parrish et al., 1982). In other experiments, they used the same approach to define the action spectrum for induction of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs), the most common form of DNA damage following UV exposure (Freeman et al., 1989). The spectra were virtually superimposable, peaking at B300 nm, suggesting a cause-and-effect relationship between the immediate DNA damage and subsequent increased production and dispersion of epidermal melanin. Eller et al. (1996) first documented that agents acting exclusively on DNA, such as DNA restriction enzymes, stimulate melanin production in cultured pigment cells, at least in part by increasing a-MSH binding and the melanogenic response to a-MSH. Although this did not exclude a role for UV-mediated membrane effects, it did directly implicate UV-mediated DNA damage in the tanning response. Similarly, accelerating DNA damage repair by providing UV-irradiated pigment cells with T4 endonuclease V, the bacterial enzyme that catalyzes the first step in CPD resolution, also enhanced the melanization response (Gilchrest et al., 1993). By the 1990s, DNA damage responses were recognized to be largely mediated by the transcription factor and tumor suppressor protein p53, also termed the ‘‘guardian of the genome’’ (Lane, 1992), and two groups independently asked whether p53 was involved in mediating the tanning response. Using p53 null osteosarcoma cells transfected with wild-type p53, Nylander et al. (2000) showed that p53 activation increased read-out from a transfected tyrosinase promoter linked to a reporter gene, implying that p53 could directly or indirectly stimulate tyrosinase transcription. This link between p53 and tanning was expanded and refined using both human melanoma cells and a mouse model. Compared with a p53-null parental melanoma line and to the same line transfected with an empty vector, melanoma cells transfected with wildtype p53 increased their tyrosinase mRNA levels progressively over 72 hours following p53 activation (Khlgatian et al., 1999; Khlgatian et al., 2002). Confirming an earlier report (Kichina et al., 1996), these studies also showed an inverse relationship between total p53 protein (inactive) and tyrosinase levels. The requirement for p53 activation to increase tyrosinase protein level and epidermal melanin content in vivo was confirmed by documenting the tanning ability of wild type versus p53 knockout mice (Khlgatian et al., 2002). The question remained whether p53 directly increased tyrosinase transcription, as no p53 consensus sequence had been identified in its promoter region. The key observation that the UV action spectrum for tanning is virtually identical to that for CPD production, had suggested that thymidine dinucleotide (abbreviated ‘‘TT’’), the obligate substrate for the majority of CPDs, might itself serve as a molecular signal for increased melanogenesis (tanning).

Indeed, TT increased mRNA and protein expression of tyrosinase as well as melanin content of cultured human and murine pigment cells and of intact guinea pig skin-containing melanocytes in the interfollicular epidermis, in a time frame similar to that observed after UV irradiation (Eller et al., 1994).

Screening and identification of hyperaccumulators for possible phytoremediation of Cr6+ from these contaminated sites has gained utmost importance in recent years. A pot culture experiment was conducted to observe the possible phytotoxic effects of Cr6+ in an agroforestry species, i.e. Sesbania sesban L., commonly known as sesban. Cr6+ showed significant growth retardation in 21 days old sesban seedlings, which includes 80% inhibition in seed germination at 10,000 ppm, 59.6% germination index. At 300 ppm, 67% of seedling survival was noted after 7 days of seedling exposure. A significant variation in root and shoot length of seedlings supplemented with different concentrations of Cr6+ was noticed. Shoot phytotoxicity was amplified from 6% to 31% with elevated supply of Cr6+ from 10 ppm to 300 ppm. An increased supply of chromium showed gradual decrease in chlorophyll content of seedlings. Root and leaf catalase activities were considerably increased in sesban seedlings treated with 10 ppm of Cr6+, which gradually declined with the increasing supply. Root and leaf peroxidase activities were significantly increased with increasing concentration of Cr6+. Chromium bioaccumulation was more in roots than leaves and stems. Roots showed nearly more than 10 times higher chromium bioaccumulation than stems. The results of the present study reveal the phytoremediation mechanisms developed by sesban seedlings to combat Cr6+ induced various physiological stresses under field condition.","inCitations":["007cd69ffe2c5ed33fa91f8fea790be5b9cfc711","126d659e4362dc17494a87ce8b427d348de0aa81"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Hexavalent Chromium Induced Toxicological, Physiological and Biochemical Alterations in Sesbania sesban L.

Caution is required since there are hypotheses that are reasonably supported by data that suggest that high intracellular calcium concentrations stimulate mitochondria to respond faster, to respire faster and that these in turn raise calcium concentration further and that eventually because of raised intracellular calcium concentration, the cell dies a hypoxic death. That really raises a kind of caution in that any inotropic intervention in all probability will deal at some phase in its action by raising intracellular calcium concentrations and that indeed one would have to more seriously consider the possibility that inotropic intervention may in fact be deleterious especially if some cells are marginal. If one is measuring hemodynamic effects grossly in the entire circulatory system, these marginal cells in fact might be injured quite significantly and lead to a real undetected deleterious effect. I would like to discuss what kinds of things one might accept from an inotropic intervention.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Evaluation of Inotropic Therapy","doi":"10.1007/978-1-4613-3819-2_19","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4613-3819-2_19","venue":""}

A possible control mechanism for the process became apparent with the discovery of the piezoelectric effect in bone2. In theory this effect could translate an environmental stimulus into a biologically recognizable signal controlling growth or resorptive processes. It has been recognized that the action of the piezoelectric signal may be to alter the chemistry of pertinent macromolecules such as collagen, or to influence cellular activity directly3. Of the two possibilities, evidence tends to rule out the importance of the former and we consider here only the latter4.","inCitations":["18e6fa88bb876acd000948ff3a50053dc10b8f56","e78ea6716592704314b744207f438640c2ccd831","844794a3d30e463ceaac9362c42a91745967a1f1","020b3ed377fdd4a27a509e7410429ce47424ba2d","abcc4ea34e87869324dbfe80bd2e1dd5b25d2fcc","3db0c4941d72510384ba768522e3432289235863","b9bc6c55a1eb0f4f67a5dd56e4b1b8bcf0aae962","48cc2b9e999b5de1cd54c0204784275121bb3bc8","b24813adbe931da9a12757b2b9372c514cd0d6b8","86524bc89ae08e5a82c5981c84a51b7ba464a3ae","832044cb5b1ad2027e881d040693c6b6519bfbe0","265082334d3a479db02d3f2dfca4420c9a2fa17e","5a46154436d012af0528aa60edeffa0e34d62853","45e1c946bf618ca4fad6e78ce09e9d959ea4c743","7afd7854bda1fc1e55f4b39674bfd6b115a0d2a6","10e208bf518161472c2ca27e0e3e2201a6e24d12","f2332d25763781a2babf03568168f8f14426c084","41d1bf6d2c519959dbf416b07e401a74501ba690","6e34a54a064f8cc67a5028bc225735dedee552b1","4cba54abad0e450c3c172b8bc62825dec98404b7","83e09e0bd3e275e1f20f48ad8d70ee1f3d2138b3","01b24062cb178f36354eecb0c3a35b0d084372c4","9bcbf47c5800f891a6aec0403a26d341d77fc816","f70b0ccffb6b9c1bad0b5f87ce09f7bdff3a18e7","9b0d48bbb2afa6a2ef848f8075efa57e09074079","360531138258b8cecef5132faf6c4308cd723dd5","f66a6fde70eb408eea887c581e79da6c69db9151","2185daf74309f702276db43ed5164884c7f40ebe","42aa1658cd6ed20e67724548ff09feb288068fad","550943e44983e2acd9b316bc27f3a800ebace701","c86a612d7adb13468980e456ddd1664540f3ad4f","93a95b10dfa65ffed502e46d86e894c8977d850d","9518f5f158157927d592071f86dd5f70a8903efc","d07cd5725c334b24c4f4d764b2eca8dcbc5fc294","1d439959bbada29908c0f8b375b0c0fff99693ef","ae8c2ad45f52d3f81c84c9359b069bca07463211","966aea2024516906c6db1185580c75215415aaa5","0beb4bb6d9ed6fd4718d731ebb30b7914d8f3948","a72f60d72bbb34fdcb05a7a831c324650e53245e","4307aef4400336712ee2f39763f5d79e82057113","b8c2ff95b3a3f57775ae5c25f3d840f4f7bbe9ee","fe8bb3563c178381f281f6d144636ecb4fee6c27","0448a0a48e09427dcbf7d1a6a1dda35f7a19b188","8b1a8adc21361994f334987bdecab900fd91bb13","5fd0d27ea74d9c49383fd8b1c51053a75cdc6224","6a2282250d8153d72ea81ed8837ce11ba8392513","fe3463faed5c36f8375fa8512f57092737ba270f","68b9d3efee727e0affd60703c741965756f07c62","48cae5490edcab37a7aa49d834a3a9dfd57ca787","2982eb384f4decdc09162c3f313bed508370bf10","27082cb4d0330f6af6cb202f6b4c2ad84bf268b4","4bb324a51cecdeef0c444f4031933fe460d6e877","e032dc8b79dbd8e3695812976f01abc0099d42f1","33c5f4f83de2ac54c4cf02a2aeadd27bcbe255b0"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Piezoelectric Effect and Growth Control in Bone","doi":"10.1038/228473a0","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1038/228473a0","venue":"Nature"}

We evaluate the possibilities of machine learning as a clinical decision support to determine the suitability to corneal refractive surgery. A machine learning architecture was built with the aim of identifying candidates combining the large multi-instrument data from patients and clinical decisions of highly experienced experts. Five heterogeneous algorithms were used to predict candidates for surgery. Subsequently, an ensemble classifier was developed to improve the performance. Training (10,561 subjects) and internal validation (2640 subjects) were conducted using subjects who had visited between 2016 and 2017. External validation (5279 subjects) was performed using subjects who had visited in 2018. The best model, i.e., the ensemble classifier, had a high prediction performance with the area under the receiver operating characteristic curves of 0.983 (95% CI, 0.977–0.987) and 0.972 (95% CI, 0.967–0.976) when tested in the internal and external validation set, respectively. The machine learning models were statistically superior to classic methods including the percentage of tissue ablated and the Randleman ectatic score. Our model was able to correctly reclassify a patient with postoperative ectasia as an ectasia-risk group. Machine learning algorithms using a wide range of preoperative information achieved a comparable performance to screen candidates for corneal refractive surgery. An automated machine learning analysis of preoperative data can provide a safe and reliable clinical decision for refractive surgery.","inCitations":["06d254c8cc1b4e94dc00325f34297f9385717393","e31629f7a281ee420dbb12e32356ec895295c705","7d135043395f1b60ff443cb5974de760cf73c9e2"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Adopting machine learning to automatically identify candidate patients for corneal refractive surgery","doi":"10.1038/s41746-019-0135-8","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41746-019-0135-8","venue":"npj Digital Medicine"}

Several large reviews have reported that excessive GWG is associated with an increase in BW. However recent large, well-designed, randomized controlled trials studying interventions aimed at reducing GWG have all consistently failed to show a reduction in BW despite achieving a reduction in GWG. The aim of this longitudinal prospective study was to examine the relationship between GWG and birth weight in women where GWG and Body Mass Index (BMI) were measured accurately in a strictly standardized way.MethodsWomen were enrolled at their convenience before 18 weeks gestation. Height and weight were measured accurately at the first antenatal visit and BMI calculated. Maternal weight was measured again after 37 weeks gestation. The weight of the baby was measured at birth. Relationships were tested using linear regression analysis, chi-squared tests and t-tests as appropriate.ResultsOf the 522 women studied, the mean BMI was 25.3 kg/m2 and 15.7% were obese. The mean BW at term was 3576 g (2160–5120) and 2.7% (n = 14) weighed ≥4500 g. The mean GWG overall was 12.3 kg (4.6 to 28.4) and GWG decreased as BMI increased. The mean GWG was less in obese women, at 8.7 kg (− 4.6 to 23.4), compared to non-obese,13.0 kg (0.6–28.4) (p < 0.001). Mean BW in obese women was 3630 g vs 3565 g in non-obese (p = 0.27). The total GWG correlated positively with BW (p < 0.001). When BW was subtracted from total GWG, GWG no longer correlated with BW (p = 0.12).ConclusionsThe positive correlation between GWG in pregnancy and BW can be accounted for by the contribution of fetal weight to GWG antenatally without a contribution from increased maternal adiposity. There was a wide range of BW irrespective of the degree of GWG and obese women had a lower GWG than non-obese women. These findings help explain why Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) designed to reduce GWG have failed to decrease BW and suggest there is no causative link between excessive GWG and increased BW.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s12884-018-1843-9"],"title":"Is birth weight the major confounding factor in the study of gestational weight gain?: an observational cohort study","doi":"10.1186/s12884-018-1843-9","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12884-018-1843-9","venue":"BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth"}

The present paper is concerned with the different syntactic constructions in which the first participant in verbal action has the FSP function of rheme. In context-independent sentences this configuration is primarily found in sentences realizing the presentation scale (in Firbas's terminology, cf. 1992: 66-69, 109-110, 134-140), i.e. in sentences with verbs of existence or appearance which present a phenomenon on the scene. There being only one participant in verbal action, it is syntactically construed as the subject. However, expression of this semantic content is not confined to just one realization form in English, which raises the question to what extent the variant realization forms of the presentation scale are interchangeable or differentiated, and, in the latter case, in which respects. The following discussion is based on an analysis of three samples of contemporary fiction (see Sources), each providing 500 clauses taken from continuous text, i.e. a total of 1 500 clauses. To obtain a textually homogeneous sample, attention was paid only to the authors' monologue, i.e. direct speech was excluded on account of the differences between monologue and dialogue on the one hand, and the different role of intonation in speech and writing on the other. In written language the role of intonation as an indicator of FSP is of minor importance insofar as in this medium intonation largely constitutes a concomitant feature of an FSP structure primarily indicated by other means, viz contextual boundness, syntactico-semantic structure and linear arrangement (Firbas 1992: 10-11,115, Sgall et al. 1986: 3.10-3.13). The frequency of occurrence of the presentation scale appears to be relatively low: 88 instances within the total of 1 500 clauses, i.e. 5.09%. In the following discussion the relative frequency of occurrence of the different realization forms of the presentation scale is considered within the subset of the 88 instances of the presentation scale. 1.1 The most frequent realization of the presentation scale is the existential construction (39 instances, 43.3%), followed by rhematic subject in preverbal position (28 instances, 3l.7%), inversion with postverbal placement of the subject (12 instances, 13.6%), and the configuration of a semantically adverbial","inCitations":["b2c39a1eb9b0dc24c804134a156ac1480bdb601f","4bf27a2205631ece5bf9cc73530f0bdb8a525ba2","21c45d955bc3148782785e2b48f85f293e954aa5","e15b74c90a957113932a5978ad6a3e8f13c477f9","e588f1c0b61090ba4051c84a475e0a8f1ae80952","2f837f2217d16212c1f20e07644495beaaef6779","8ad95a97e1667038dacb34f7c83ef73c74e2fd43"],"pdfUrls":["http://emsa.ff.cuni.cz/system/files/Syntactic%20Forms%20of%20the%20Presentation%20Scale%20and%20their%20Differentiation_Duskova.pdf"],"title":"Syntactic Forms of the Presentation Scale and Their Differentiation","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Postoperative RAAS status had not been evaluated in previous studies, although aldosterone levels have been shown to be suppressed during medical therapy with pasireotide and cabergoline. Materials and Methods: This was a prospective, single-center study. Patients with CD, aged between 15–75 years, undergoing curative pituitary surgery were recruited. An 8 am and 11 pm cortisol and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) were measured at baseline. An 8 am cortisol was measured 6 weeks after surgery to demonstrate remission. Plasma-renin activity and plasma-aldosterone concentration were measured at baseline and 6 weeks after curative surgery. Results: A total of 14 patients (11 female, 3 male) were recruited initially, of these 8 patients completed the study. The plasma-renin activity was not suppressed at baseline and did not rise significantly after surgery (P = 0.717). However, plasma-aldosterone concentration was in the low-normal range at baseline and had risen significantly 6 weeks after surgery (P = 0.013). No difference was noted in subgroups with or without hypertension. Conclusion: Curative pituitary surgery leads to normalization of plasma-aldosterone concentration in patients with CD just 6 weeks after surgery. Hence, mineralocorticoid replacement may not prove beneficial in alleviating the “SWS” in postsurgical CD patients who have achieved remission.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Demystifying “Steroid Withdrawal” During Remission in Cushing's Disease: Is Mineralocorticoid Replacement the Answer?","doi":"10.4103/ijem.IJEM_260_19","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.4103/ijem.IJEM_260_19","venue":"Indian journal of endocrinology and metabolism"}

Numerical simulation indicates that there are remarkable influences on optical properties of 1D photonic crystal resulted by structure perturbation, especially for PBG location and DOM at band edge. Generally, both PBG shifting and shrinking occurs due to disruptive periodicity. In specific case, especially along with perturbation coefficient increasing, it is found that PBG is extended obviously and the higher DOM at the band edge also can be obtained. According to this, some conclusions had been drawn which are significant to developing omnidirectional reflectors, band edge lasers and other devices based 1D photonic crystals.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"The effect of structure perturbation on PBG of one-dimensional photonic crystals","doi":"10.1117/12.695204","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1117/12.695204","venue":"SPIE Micro + Nano Materials, Devices, and Applications"}

Despite the progressive improvement of the success rate, the clinical indication to the islet allotransplantation remains limited to selected patients affected by brittle type 1 diabetes mellitus. The burden of the immunosuppression therapy still represents the main critical issue but other areas might be subject to further improvements, such as the islet production, islet engraftment and long-term function.  Several strategies have been proposed to increase the success rate of pancreas digestion and islet purification or to facilitate islet engraftment by reducing islet hypoxia and the inflammatory reaction occurring in the site of transplantation. The co-transplantation of progenitors of beta cell together with the islets has expected to contribute to prolong graft function. Clinical trials are expected soon. Scientific advances, as well as economical efforts, are required to make this procedure a real therapeutical option for patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Islet transplantation 30 years after the first transplants.","doi":"10.26355/eurrev_201803_14494","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.26355/eurrev_201803_14494","venue":"European review for medical and pharmacological sciences"}

For the remedial measures of preventing different types of cancers, one of the research domains that have gained substantial importance in medical science is the development of new metallo-drugs and their investigations as potential anticancer drug agents by using various analytical techniques. Since metal-based complexes show weak absorption bands, electrochemical methods are considered more feasible and preferable over spectroscopic methods for easy characterization. Due to closer resemblance of electrochemical and biological processes, cyclic voltammetry among different electrochemical methods is considered the most versatile for the study of in-vitro metal-based drug–DNA interactions in terms of changes in the redox activities. Current potential data of a metal complex leads to determine binding kinetics in terms of binding constant and binding site size that involve determining the binding mode of drug with DNA, i.e., electrostatic interactions, intercalation, or minor-major groove binding. Binding parameters and modes of interactions, further, help to develop the mechanism of action of drug with the DNA. In this review, we emphasize on cyclic voltammetric DNA binding studies on some metal complexes that have been carried out in the last three decades for the investigation of their anticancer potentials.","inCitations":["d18dbba2995ea77e734487f87398d32a5c73285b","c99bdebf163177ec0b5ca0fd178fc4195e5113c5"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Cyclic Voltammetric DNA Binding Investigations on Some Anticancer Potential Metal Complexes: a Review","doi":"10.1007/s12010-018-2818-z","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s12010-018-2818-z","venue":"Applied Biochemistry and Biotechnology"}

Inappropriate use is a burden on healthcare costs and increases the risk of ED overcrowding. The aim of this study was to explore socioeconomic and geographical determinants of inappropriate ED use in France.\n\n\nMETHOD\nThe French Emergency Survey was a nationwide cross-sectional survey conducted on June 11 2013, simultaneously in all EDs in France and covered characteristics of patients, EDs and counties. The survey included 48 711 patient questionnaires and 734 ED questionnaires. We focused on adult patients (≥15 years old). The appropriateness of the ED visit was assessed by three measures: caring physician appreciation of appropriateness (numeric scale), caring physician appreciation of whether or not the patient could have been managed by a general practitioner and ED resource utilisation. Descriptive statistics and multilevel logistic regression were used to examine determinants of inappropriate ED use, estimating adjusted ORs and 95% CIs.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAmong the 29 407 patients in our sample, depending on the measuring method, 13.5% to 27.4% ED visits were considered inappropriate. Regardless of the measure method used, likelihood of inappropriate use decreased with older age and distance from home to the ED >10 km. Not having a private supplementary health insurance, having universal supplementary health coverage and symptoms being several days old increased the likelihood of inappropriate use. Likelihood of inappropriate use was not associated with county medical density.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nInappropriate ED use appeared associated with socioeconomic vulnerability (such as not having supplementary health coverage or having universal coverage) but not with geographical characteristics. It makes us question the appropriateness of the concept of inappropriate ED use as it does not consider the distress experienced by the patient, and segments of society seem to have few other choices to access healthcare than the ED.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Factors associated with inappropriate use of emergency departments: findings from a cross-sectional national study in France.","doi":"10.1136/bmjqs-2019-009396","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjqs-2019-009396","venue":"BMJ quality & safety"}

Finally, we show bit error rate simulations for BICM systems with LLR quantization using a rate 1/2 low-density parity-check code.","inCitations":["39a3fb0fe04c531124b37f9b7133ca06af9510aa","291f7dc3462b7c15896b1b896f359ccfc788a80a","87e9c215aea52ca440033ebdaab2658b3b92c081","b786df8a4465716e4042335559a37bf67a20558a","fe21c20179f6526b68680027e3b30c48d0792b09","64a94790ddafaa7b6f6654fd878b0a8a0509052f","e89d3026d79ab24966e189f166a1da154f982ac0","a07a3ded65496b2e4a6ebb3c1c67817af5be1c83","3212e7bec7a2a9a7607a7a12503a42d1ebe2025e","abf2f71a12c28896886f2a0769606986c53958cb","cef81ed4c8c4e74bc83e21354c04d0699f5189d4","91c18597c29117de131aa0136232afd4a5379e64","067b2ccd18f282585b88a332c37a23107889fba1","cd3922f311ed7c668b5d9d0b540a9d98986dc63e","3713b1838c21a28af66d2c083a1d90660f40d2f0","398f1e81a5dfb7c22c9b29124de90c3f10983316","b2671c8394e6e06fad8e00f85cfcef58df31766b","13b9bc6c00f7e7d3c6dbff7afa3342b35ca9a21b","1e0265376791cf66cf92c1881ffd721c53ccc386","4ba9f585648c1ffd11fb6b350f21c1f56855e0d3","7e68c13292fddf814bb507229c66c870c99da2fe","9ca8dfabd16931086b60cec26782514e50e63060","dd146e945933abbec490bc650c81ad5bfa387cab","6f2f242ed2112d0fdcc851af9e0a7385ebd15de0","d2df0bbe98124bb2ed769315841fcad835dbf115","7dc358a78762bbfe988f26d6919f8936c1138636","07cf16027103c5ca075b8218d8ec10cce85ed0bc","527678df88a4fcad9c6e0704c02a18ffb9928823","8f0289d0d38ddb6e52759e4f45bcd9909ecd3b46","643f62b3dbfe70d73aa618da5cf40bf903a3edb0","abadcae7d887cbc67dafa1e0874ffd4bd0d4610b","ec49f3c766f7f3a1cc2bbabc0b5edbef4cdbfe42","f9b46fccb68af44f0211d35f83557ffa22558e90","de3e6cc5d864a73528e5ac09f5ed8e36efff460d","6d52ed0ced53beebc526cfdfc4d91eb550d96759","b2b3e56d6d4c86af6c5019c6efa0f2a22f930ca0"],"pdfUrls":["https://arxiv.org/pdf/0905.0606v1.pdf","http://arxiv.org/abs/0905.0606","http://arxiv.org/pdf/0905.0606v1.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2009.5206049","http://publik.tuwien.ac.at/files/PubDat_175245.pdf","https://publik.tuwien.ac.at/files/PubDat_175245.pdf"],"title":"Quantization for soft-output demodulators in bit-interleaved coded modulation systems","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2009.5206049","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2009.5206049","venue":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory"}

In 18 rabbit right atrial preparations, the sinus node effective refractory period (SNERP) was measured at multiple basic pacing cycle lengths. In 14 experiments SNERP was measured at basic pacing cycle lengths of 400, 350 and 300 ms. The mean SNERP (+/- standard deviation) prolonged from 168 +/- 31 ms at 400 ms to 181 +/- 37 ms at 350 ms to 196 +/- 40 ms at 400 ms (p less than 0.001). To rule out the possibility that rapid stimulation might release acetylcholine and thus prolong refractoriness, 4 more experiments were conducted in the presence of atropine (2 X 10(-6) M), and similar results were obtained. The spatial orientation of refractoriness was examined in 7 experiments. At the same premature interval, shorter basic pacing cycle lengths resulted in block of the premature impulse at a greater distance from the sinus node. Therefore, in sinus node tissue refractoriness increases with shortening of basic pacing cycle length, a response similar to that of the atrioventricular node.","inCitations":["c5533b21b631e565150e1666b788b021754065d9","a2125ae1360718f9aa13a66469749487ab031476"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Effect of basic pacing cycle length on sinus node refractoriness in the rabbit.","doi":"10.1016/0002-9149(85)90586-7","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/0002-9149%2885%2990586-7","venue":"The American journal of cardiology"}

The nucleotides adenosine triphosphate (ATP), adenosine diphosphate, uridine triphosphate and uridine diphosphate evoked an increase in intracellular calcium and the activation of a potassium current. The sensitivity of these responses to the antagonists suramin, PPADS, MRS 2179 and Cibacron blue suggest the presence of at least three functional P2Y receptor subtypes, most probably P2Y(2), P2Y(4) and P2Y(6). ATP also activated P2X receptors, giving rise to a rapidly activating cation conductance. This response was insensitive to the antagonists suramin and Cibacron blue, was potentiated by Zn(2+) and inhibited by acidification suggesting involvement of P2X(4) receptors. In low divalent cation solution, responses to ATP became larger, and dibenzoyl-ATP became more potent than ATP, indicating the presence of P2X(7) receptors. Immunofluorescence, flow cytometry, Western blots and RT-PCR show that P2X(4) and P2X(7) receptors are the most prominent in both macrophage types, while the expression of the other P2X subunits is variable and sometimes weak or undetectable. These techniques also demonstrated the presence of mRNA for P2Y(1), P2Y(2), P2Y(4) and P2Y(6) receptors along with protein expression for the three subtypes we investigated, namely, P2Y(1), P2Y(2) and P2Y(4).","inCitations":["5ac25a8df1d09fa291819eab1ebeb1d9df2a1b4e","35f4f9631335bc5016efe7d860ff8425bb34c2b0","231f280abdc960d238c9760a712b557ce67642b8","efd60eafc37bc3aff50cebd83aed94b0a19ec0d9","2c5621b303fef25d742c3e17256dd3cea92b0bd8","a2fe1a23e5a02d28ab17f74d3ce0f665027b782c","751e1c5bad0784af32076d7125b1c37610a8f986","df232bb8a84c8f6207726b1784d83f7916917a90","cf91d0dd7de85ded633631b805020636fb97e259","4c4c17c6489d8279e33222aa43f0d7e4c56e5785","3f17b341bd3655108c2a4285f8819aaa83f55c10","9d23f6c4efc1c1bad709d4475f9b66cb9d261f65","86670e7949034fee11254320fa4f7704f9ada0c2","e47bd84ce1cb5a28d5aabbc13add93cb664c5c39","06f3883c01de96cb7f39d29afee71bcf4fa53d19","0aca80792e8133e4ae5440d5d3556455fb11a103","113a3ec31fda1bca701bd129a03a2e90276f5acd","3a81cbcd6660f2c47ef54df77a5ed536ef98a043","6efee7e3d7e14ab73e502096c57ba8b59ba8b3df","28ce25bd70833fe35e1568df31a34c326bb875f9","c63438f63b1b50ac5e6b9220f6aa57d130dd40fb","05c75f7f4a549f72a29421fb3eb688233e0d115e","e54c5efc73f0f37d2b36f8166e3666dab5c83aa2","03223f46bf885a2db90bd1fb0a7a20f76c948925","e9367b7042d475eab06b16883898cb4bfb46e6a0","f8b0092550861f137cb119b361764b0fc8cb4bd0","0f17eda9390be4a8aed7e91a43c8f913ead4a673","5317c340906ca0036375c311eb0dbb23630cb72b","19a310b97567c11e9ad509a66ed2f5f25aa05f8b","71e859edf49f61b63e75db900dd75510b794fb99","70441b2f7d0356984667362954e3f83e60e537a5","3202e070c27bd4eed1ba76176a1ae7fa29b31a68","95b451857ca51a24e3fc5ef775a4ee7fbd0de63e","ba4697d740a7311aca2955e40cd5fbd32cbdcda9","70a803a7a0caaa9f6309c80485a822a632b21f09","3814dcccfc6dd8c67a0518805ae440630c7957be","ac28dce261782d27bf337bb609bb137588ab3764","cc5df51a5a4a90664738fef9d943231a2ac6e956","12a5d0e405b0b2cd3ef43b5253cdd2d43513b1ba","bf4bb664f1d9403dd77a76359a36eb7d9d478dea","405943578385d85338c4a290e4b9ac859c7cacd6","93574a5b39b377827c1cba4139e07efb1fdc9256","09f2a904fbe5a861eb137db4a8130a84dbfeac88","1d480ee16f6f15e4572a9c17f8f9270cf510f803"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.ucl.ac.uk/ani/GB's%20PDF%20file%20copies/CV1288.pdf"],"title":"Multiple P2X and P2Y receptor subtypes in mouse J774, spleen and peritoneal macrophages.","doi":"10.1016/j.bcp.2004.11.012","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bcp.2004.11.012","venue":"Biochemical pharmacology"}

Spontaneous prototrophic revertants were isolated from most of the mutant lines. In some revertants, the enzyme regained the heat resistance of the wild type completely or partially. In other revertants, the enzyme was overproduced, but its heat-sensitive nature was unaltered.

The lower explosion concentration limits of nano-aluminum powders with sizes of 35, 75, and 100 nm are found to be 5, 10, and 10 g/m3, respectively, while the lower explosion concentration limit of ordinary aluminum powders is about 50 g/m3.","inCitations":["5823a738a0154d532c0532396d319ba7967b0772","5cd8e2a56db3034c718b05ac800d235711f32268","a75b484e795c4181672b71086283483c5f606dfd"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Experimental investigation on explosion characteristics of nano-aluminum powder—air mixtures","doi":"10.1007/s10573-010-0089-2","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10573-010-0089-2","venue":""}

Executive summary","paperAbstract":"Authors' conclusions This study demonstrates how pharmacogenomics can be used to individualize medication regimens, and how a clinical trial can be constructed to evaluate the impact of a pharmacogenomics-based treatment approach. This study is also notable in that it addresses a common, real-life clinical problem, and uses commercially available technology for pharmacogenomics-based decision-making. The optimal clinical trial for evaluating the utility of a pharmacogenomicsbased H. pylori treatment regimen would isolate the impact of treatment changes made as a result of genetic status. Ideally, such a trial would be done in the U.S. in a population with rates of CYP2C19 polymorphisms approximating that of the general U.S. population. Also, the ideal trial would use an approach to diagnosing H. pylori that reflects usual care in the U.S. and would use a standard treatment regimen recommended for U.S. patients.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://www.crd.york.ac.uk/crdweb/PrintPDF.php?AccessionNumber=32010000214&Copyright=Health+Technology+Assessment+(HTA)+database%3Cbr+/%3ECopyright+%26copy%3B+2019+BlueCross+BlueShield+Association+(BCBS)%3Cbr+/%3E","http://www.crd.york.ac.uk/crdweb/PrintPDF.php?AccessionNumber=32010000214&Copyright=Health+Technology+Assessment+(HTA)+database%3Cbr+/%3ECopyright+%26copy%3B+2014+BlueCross+BlueShield+Association+(BCBS)%3Cbr+/%3E"],"title":"Pharmacogenomics-based treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection.","doi":"","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"Technology Evaluation Center Assessment Program.
