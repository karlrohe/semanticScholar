In the context of an antisense strategy based on the double bond configuration, all-trans AEA (t-AEA) was synthesized in high yield starting from all-trans methyl arachidonate and ethanolamine in the presence of KCN. t-AEA was assayed on rabbit platelet aggregation, obtaining effect only at high concentrations (>10(-4) M) after an also concentration-dependent lag phase. At lower concentrations it inhibited PAF-induced rabbit platelet aggregation with an IC(50)=4.6 x 10(-6) M. In contrast to anandamide, the activation of platelets was not due to the conversion of t-AEA to trans arachidonic acid, as ascertained by negative results with FAAH inhibitors. However, t-AEA was found to be a substrate for fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH), the enzyme that cleaves anandamide and regulates in vivo the magnitude and duration of the signaling induced by this lipid messenger.","inCitations":["a10d370cf8066369ead4f8c6ee4790c748de4eed","ea965935fc75ca149409685c73569cafcfc8deae"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Synthesis of all-trans anandamide: a substrate for fatty acid amide hydrolase with dual effects on rabbit platelet activation.","doi":"10.1016/j.bmc.2008.08.054","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bmc.2008.08.054","venue":"Bioorganic & medicinal chemistry"}

It is formed by an oligosaccharide core covalently linked to Lipid A, which consists of a diglucosamine backbone carrying two diphosphorylethanolamine in 1 and 4’ positions and hexa-acyl substituents. There is a straight relationship between Lipid A structure and its inflammatory activity. It ́s known that the removal of acyl chains and the hydrolysis of diphosphoryl-ethanolamine esters reduce drastically its inflammatory activity. Due to its high toxicity a safe protocol of kinetic detoxification is required, which involves a pyrogenic monitoring and LOS characterization.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://www.arca.fiocruz.br/bitstream/icict/28598/2/III%20SACT%20_%20V6.pdf"],"title":"Characterization of native and deacylated Lipid A from lipooligosaccharide of Neisseria meningitidis Serogroup B","doi":"10.35259/isi.sact.2015_28598","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.35259/isi.sact.2015_28598","venue":""}

Each teenager was swabbed three times with an interval of 2 months between the examinations. The 901 recovered N. meningitidis strains were characterized using serological (serogrouping, serotyping/serosubtyping) and molecular methods (PCR, PFGE) each. The results of the study demonstrate an overall average carrier rate of 18.8% for the three collection periods. There were, however, significant differences between the carrier rates within a given school and of different towns and counties. Of all isolates, 60.6% were not serogroupable. Serogroup B dominated (12.3%), followed by serogroup Y (9.0%) and serogroup C (3.6%). After PCR-based serogrouping of not serogroupable strains the percentages for serogroups enhanced to 18.8% for B, 10.8% for Y and 4.1% for C. Serotyping led to 305 different phenotypes with the most common being 29E:NT:P1.2,5 followed by Y:14:NST. In the 6 study towns the number of different N. meningitidis clones (PFGE types) isolated, varied between 30 and 87. In Wenden, where a prolonged outbreak had taken place, serogroup C (14.8%) was predominant. Only in this town C:2a isolates were found, all belonging to the ST-11/ET-37 complex and 12/13 matched identically to the ET-15 clone. Of the colonized teenagers, 26.7% were carriers over at least 23 weeks, 22.6% with the same strain, 36.0% were carrier for at least 15 weeks. Over all three collection periods 36.7% of the adolescents acquired a new strain. The highest acquisition rate was related to PFGE type 12.","inCitations":["1d336fd96f26bc183eb03e25beae9ce5943338a5","4be8f006242677f9d8ecfad9dbbc1b8a357642c0","b88e93dd4af85ab7ddf1a9c39a90a2de66047968","6db602b2641b96e3d12c2c545529abca93b9bb48","d49466b83bb42ee0ef399f24e0b4c5522da4e630","254ff2ebf117591078544f7be382f2762b31bbb0","96ca2948966cc79a27b19b945b158b56dc6ecb38","61c817a4490d9e29ce6e2e21ff8fcfc4dbf5a714","b0641c9329b3c7dd8b04b311c77b4d8fbd157184","de0d97ff802f990ae111796252c7482d871c337c","bbe6f551962d2ab3ac84c3f07a74b596639044d8","f14b163382f869803ae4f369aed3b7fa8d377b56","f7ce694322b5ccf41ecfe567397e5d385434d769","65901a40aac8f65cd0a969ddb402a1019c05d084","3fcd897102d761f5581f69bdf1dc82291d29f7a9","121d11b5d1095c40a1a0448ba0b01de2d2b4605c","5ac0d8a9708e928540e42aa4529f0f9d7ed316b7","b5070b154ee6832be7e99b439cd7a55e6a15ea69","6e2c4ee241504ef838a60832f596e1b95cc21e09","16269247896a24e85f73e2cfa10695d7ee9acebe","aed27d4e7275e2dc9d8fac1a7dffd46237422e92"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Longitudinal study of meningococcal carrier rates in teenagers.","doi":"10.1016/j.ijheh.2007.05.006","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijheh.2007.05.006","venue":"International journal of hygiene and environmental health"}

Yet, how loss of CFTR affects electrolyte transport remains uncertain. CFTR⁻(/)⁻ pigs spontaneously develop lung disease resembling human CF. At birth, their airways exhibit a bacterial host defense defect, but are not inflamed. Therefore, we studied ion transport in newborn nasal and tracheal/bronchial epithelia in tissues, cultures, and in vivo. CFTR⁻(/)⁻ epithelia showed markedly reduced Cl⁻ and HCO₃⁻ transport. However, in contrast to a widely held view, lack of CFTR did not increase transepithelial Na(+) or liquid absorption or reduce periciliary liquid depth. Like human CF, CFTR⁻(/)⁻ pigs showed increased amiloride-sensitive voltage and current, but lack of apical Cl⁻ conductance caused the change, not increased Na(+) transport. These results indicate that CFTR provides the predominant transcellular pathway for Cl⁻ and HCO₃⁻ in porcine airway epithelia, and reduced anion permeability may initiate CF airway disease.","inCitations":["1698beda8298e69dc26903d48cb12c832a98c77c","5cbfcd2a6c32d7329d188addc40c52bb8784ac0e","775c1597b654ba76df9c32e12234ed5c18d82467","d918dfd1b5fca74390d0a96ecfbe0d738d0720f7","13994aa4090d14098ee62bb02142f32510fd8c7b","021fa2c1228174c7676485c9f4e27d5da6ea8777","71a2dcf73868c9bf7ffd394dfceb35bad1ca6a72","0f29e06702ea9be926ea69df8cb6a05f776a76c6","71328bc2e7e731c7e42814ad68ce0288283f1509","d5729c1890208c91472a176a532ac633874e6a24","1f610ce6ac08ac9660f39f4e28375ce2c0c3b7f5","b1cd38e79e8c7626e528a46b61a2bbf9cda47f47","62784c4acf6cee6a2af1a029a1bf12d4f639ce6d","efe12cc601763df6d4b169c566ae92427206c96c","a22bf4d827a9cde201603ac47dc7d078993cf28c","c227c7f4506844ced75d8113d6d248a4ddeac76e","4836149ba33d8423cd1356ee2c7a40bb72cf5a9b","ee24385dba2c3e12510040e7ff99fb42095123cc","44f10a516bee515aa47d8acc20c588f1a242e127","b4bdcccfa056cc1559a0dbbe217874c91ada6c91","6d4edb5cfbb8d21349511b1829829b92cbc7fc00","815c8507bfa2d7c1547d00e996391887a0f801af","55c6ffd86a605a712302a46661590d0cbfcd7de5","c0625c25343a85d598a948510e7cc950e06dc3a3","b43ad77cc7dd5536732368a70feacebd278ee7b5","6e3aafbf33ab83431c2217bf0df71e30d5906b22","3d02bf0adebaf574350b8e158c99e92e9907bbc7","43abdbdbbfee011d9b71263d24f9ee32741cfb17","f8c814d38dfbf8e40496654f8b08657a619ff8f3","bb9883b6bf22013f92cae54a6ec1aa20ceb3fe54","ad57c25d755ef12d9929dabe01dfc118418bad7f","d64fd421194ed94709cbe5098338ddd012c728d3","463401877e7b998dc2e9af8ceb4afa20219fa1e4","b70911d10ccb8b37e2ad5609673e3878cc66d7fa","52fa021cee77742c5c2568a22422307550a5bd14","b9b67d288d2e5752aa64144cbb8c7418b75e463b","f98286b4c50ec17773115dd6787803b50abf788e","82c958dcc7bdbef110cf11840aa2d7e39d04a259","fc5cfaa39b88054458cbb16f2628e3181ed46496","259fc42d6d27be7f2b93c8da24daa1dafd5ba9bc","ba41ae54e7010ecd16dae14188a38950d170738a","d55b6caa3fdc42ab377676662f9e5fafa9102a2d","a4b8bee253650421a5fff13e40e54d9bb0326fb9","a6d195becac2198cc1ca3c34d928ad3a3fbebf18","47b0cdf196614801ef545fe9da114026a50947d4","0a33b660e6b52904377d6851731044e275248b92","b91e5fecb755baaa76049d36b31b625dea55ebbe","9a13ccd6be3536af404c25e748c34eac997c5d16","5861efb719872553905f2d159423b0fbaab51b6e","c6492442e05a67c550e7f363f89ff2cb03407075","e622f5138fef1ab5cb0fe820f6dd93f43a3c25d3","8cae6932cf23ceba896e8c9172b76ea2607343a0","81cea608508a4323c9f415002dab145e423f7976","dee91da38278cb1b4809dca4d571d6ae21070fd3","f37e4ba1d196a81cebb49dc05588a20a69025206","a19f8259e2e1ca95a80761f4d01e4d24ff8ce887","8f33c9c3a81ff7fcb3abbf051c8abab211329677","c7e79fdadba3f4f110943203b648e839581536df","b2b344804950f35b33c8518a68a87ab189117659","b6a3e4f116f2ada6e509d9b33313c6a40e51e861","f999659fb2a2e14873d2875aa7ac04777398f160","0635e45fdacc812556c91fa81dcfe01fb4542a2f","386c72a23c505f099f3a6b24085f83e0351fe141","eaa434bc52e38fe12fea67b0a501a10a923c57d4","8facaa96146d5c258d5f7ee21822bf81b934e4df","42771b6f040e593b0aefea35fcd3447ae9305f95","c0216719aa76fb60199d732fa83ce3a6bdd60454","612b206473f6f7f03b6575484cfce217b8278545","732f1ca39cd04fc5826c6b54c3b651915d46cedf","f8bbda08edac7e4f9c77e75bbe8340d896033fda","e873529338800e045b4af34d4f44052c0433dd91","18589c57ce08a3b0d0c7e89311c8ae7d50fe8894","a9073f555cae4472c937c5c065e7d0b02cace99a","327f72c19fe413aa6e57713d38d3a361998a4294","9cdfdb35b73768d570a9143f857289d4b4fb702a","4ece14252e941b7c1d66f421f64dad0304fe1e31","97bfa4fa2aecc83cbc4453d893a7a057aec20904","4ed32972b2004d8ce8aca13e12330c9217064057","56f176c570a2d3de64c6baa8da597f9663f6e543","2bb217330038b414a9cad76af5c73b038ae01ffc","e4f5811cdd6880844a3d18a318c08565da414c74","052a9865797149ce62d001a2eb0cd37322a9e8f7","675614f311c12e092718f24346379e7a95e3a813","32a7286746240584656a3f40e48217b70b1e47ec","e3355d6d6c6fedba09d6b9fbcf4b0205a43bf91b","d1e840e04647cb9a8b7cb4aa4221a81657c6845e","069b973fc6f0ec333e9e00c8b7d1a4b704291b2c","d753f522fc28bcbf6dc527ecf3110a5aefcb8a4b","08ec8fa4c590479ba55ef2d259729b4fa3cd00ad","3c6b86b029a8303615179307441ab12667c4285a","8c5ff63c21c9ffd69f3c75ba43fea89aa8bfc4e2","d1261f6c29ab6023ba0958e14ba4aa640aca6b44","adc949278a1ea69ffc95874267c909dffd787e66","c5dd882d600a243dd29ebb740b6404529ea0e85a","7593ea5179119721dd92e6c3d2ca3bdabdc5ed5a","1dea2323bbeb9348dbb99572ebb2492c6406b6b3","916d6b9bb1d4eb0bc7d878789c4c7bc4317b838d","2a4839baed900bc8e62799d5a8e8755af2c4f0e3","e01a75128fe0ddff13a3c6e987c8e7b600d6d75f","da9227b6d3c646bc9b9ccdbb174b8f27fc563c73","5bac00cd169dfee8596d513ed6799d916968ab50","f9a77ca5ea65d55b7aea9a1e239d8f89d37839e4","1a7e4bba42fdafc0fd7d41ccab7f2dcfcd449ff7","966c2c2745941e19d4fcd6d15e95725289463edf","30069268187348f7c16f67d370fb6d5071407735","c06b6ad49c20f52ef375b3e551bc539e18a560bc","e8bf3f7646774d281d212f37f20c460d63422657","43aaaf935c7666bd8e7c782b1ca94ef060976a2d","e147ba33baf0dfa8b58c936e698f2ac32f546dd0","cb01925f1fc9324060d0e097a12e4f98d34f5753","2d84376f64c4b9af72479352eddf944610df28df","415edef8b6ab35593748e0360a4c95001b016005","9440f2d26dc6515b0cc76656472d5f1e1187c3bb","0711d5f0871dcae7823b73091eeb2912d85f0af8","848443f2e62cf507c5d98092a4a0e0d12aee0bc0","f53cd5b909a8c5be75b4e1523422f

Synthetic HDL-like phospholipid nanodiscs are a relatively new model of nanoparticles that present a promising carrier for drug delivery and membrane protein investigations. Nanodiscs are soluble nanoscale phospholipid bilayers that are produced based on the self-assembly of phospholipids, membrane scaffold proteins (MSP) and an embedded peptide/protein of interest. To determine the effect of conjugating a protein with a probe, the model protein bovine serum albumin (BSA) with or without FITC conjugation was attached onto 100% 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-choline (POPC) nanodiscs. The generated discs were analyzed by Fast Protein Liquid Chromatography (FPLC), dynamic light scattering (DLS), and UV-VIS spectroscopy. Empty, BSA- and FITC-BSA-Nanodiscs exhibited different size, charge and elution characteristics as well as different release profiles. Thus, conjugation of proteins to be adsorbed onto nanodiscs surfaces with fluorophores can affect the physical and release properties of nanodiscs, thereby potentially impacting their biophysical, delivery and imaging applications.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Albumin-bound nanodiscs as delivery vehicle candidates: Development and characterization.","doi":"10.1016/j.bpc.2019.106178","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bpc.2019.106178","venue":"Biophysical chemistry"}

However, when the cutaneous surgical defect cannot be sutured, repair by skin graft or skin flap can be either immediate or delayed. The aim of the present study is to evaluate the value of delayed repair. A six-month retrospective study was designed between November 1997 and April 1998, on a total of 367 resections of skin carcinomas and/or premalignant lesions. Two parameters were recorded: management of the skin defect, and the histological results. Out of the 367 resections, there were 275 resections with suture, 42 resections with skin graft, 11 resections with skin flap, and 39 resections without wound closure. In 41 cases further re-excisions were performed because the tumors were incompletely excised. Incompletely excised tumors were found in 6% of sutures, 9% of skin flaps, 24% of skin grafts, and 36% of delayed repairs. The high rate of incomplete surgical resections supports two-step surgery without wound closure when the defect cannot be sutured. This attitude is reinforced by the difficulty of the re-excision when a skin graft or a skin flap has been previously performed.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"[Evaluation of a two-stage surgical strategy for the treatment of skin carcinomas.

The results could add to the aetiological discussion about TMD mainly as being part of chronic WAD pain or not.The subjects were referred patients with chronic WAD at a specialized rehabilitation centre where they were diagnosed using a standardized classification of WAD diagnosing that resulted in approximately 20% WAD grade 2 and 80% WAD grade 3. In Studies I and II, a total 136 individuals with chronic WAD were found to have a significantly higher prevalence of pain associated with TMD compared to a control group of 66 general dental patients. The symptoms debuted approximately six months after the whiplash injury and were most often provoked by stress. In Study III, the effect of a therapeutic jaw exercise (TJE) program on TMD was studied over six months in patients with chronic WAD and TMD, randomized to TJE (25 subjects) or not (30 subjects). TJE had no effect on TMD. In Study IV, patients with chronic WAD and TMD were found to have a mainly myogenous origin of TMD pain. Five months of stabilisation appliance therapy (SAT) equally resulted in an almost complete perceived reduction of jaw pain and frontal headache in patients with chronic WAD and TMD (n=14) and TMD patients without WAD (n=10). In the long-term, TMD was significantly lower in patients with chronic WAD who were treated compared to patients with chronic WAD and TMD who were not treated (n=9).TMD in patients with chronic WAD grades 2 or 3 may be the same kind of musculoskeletal disorder as in TMD patients without WAD, and not primarily part of the WAD pain. A functional TMD examination as well as assessment of perceived stress can be recommended as part of the standardized screening procedure for patients with chronic WAD grades 2 and 3. Patients with symptoms and signs of TMD could be recommended SAT. Patients with symptoms of frontal headache alone should also be considered as candidates for SAT.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Stabilization appliance therapy has an equally extensive alleviating effect on jaw pain and frontal headache in patients with myogenous temporomandibular disorders (TMD), with or without chronic whiplash-associated disorders (WAD) grades 2 and 3","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

The installed costs of a number of paired metal hydride concentrating solar thermal storage systems were assessed. These comprised of magnesium-based (MgH2, Mg2FeH6, NaMgH3, NaMgH2F) high-temperature metal hydrides (HTMH) for solar thermal storage and Ti1.2Mn1.8H3.0 as the low-temperature metal hydride (LTMH) for hydrogen storage. A factored method approach was used for a 200 MWel power plant operating at a plant capacity factor (PCF) of 50% with 7 hours of thermal storage capacity at full-load. In addition, the hydrogen desorption properties of NaMgH2F have been measured for the first time. It has a practical hydrogen capacity of 2.5 wt% (2.95 wt% theoretical) and desorbs hydrogen in a single-step process above 478 °C and in a two-step process below 478 °C. In both cases the final decomposition products are NaMgF3, Na and Mg. Only the single-step desorption is suitable for concentrating solar thermal storage applications and has an enthalpy of 96.8 kJ mol−1 H2 at the midpoint of the hydrogen desorption plateau. The techno-economic model showed that the cost of the LTMH, Ti1.2Mn1.8H3.0, is the most significant component of the system and that its cost can be reduced by increasing the operating temperature and enthalpy of hydrogen absorption in the HTMH that, in turn, reduces the quantity of hydrogen required in the system for an equivalent electrical output. The result is that, despite the fact that the theoretical thermal storage capacity of NaMgH2F (1416 kJ kg−1) is substantially lower than the theoretical values for MgH2 (2814 kJ kg−1), Mg2FeH6 (2090 kJ kg−1) and NaMgH3 (1721 kJ kg−1), its higher enthalpy and operating temperature leads to the lowest installed cost of the systems considered. A further decrease in cost could be achieved by utilizing metal hydrides with yet higher enthalpies and operating temperatures or by finding a lower cost option for the LTMH.","inCitations":["2e5fcd37d1646e158c0f75b766d786c6e2cd00c2","e0236d9006f20caf1cdce8d98f5cc3d8c5643079","551a06603ea139d6d2fd1882f444ee4412b105bb","aee213c5208e763bba309c9fee541275aa053b2c","a8f5184b618e3f0c3759186c4649494586ab9213","545c700d93bc3c934877a84f482e70b4f8dc7908","65572a7ae9889e6a569b59cf9b7cc9832823a913","65ef211194e37bebd36dbd846ebc259dec3fcc34"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Hydriding characteristics of NaMgH2F with preliminary technical and cost evaluation of magnesium-based metal hydride materials for concentrating solar power thermal storage","doi":"10.1039/C4RA01682C","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1039/C4RA01682C","venue":""}

In the event that interpolation of a grid of points is required, we recently proposed a method (referred to here as the SVD method[11]) for creating a function of two variables which interpolates the points. While there are many other procedures in the literature for interpolating and approximating 3-D data sets [9, 13, 14], the SVD method is straightforward and very easy to program. The process of interpolating a matrix we call skinning the matrix; we speak of creating a skin of the matrix. Sometimes a mesh or grid of interlocking functions (which we call a curve mesh) may be considered for interpolation. Curve mesh interpolation, in which this grid of interlocking functions is interpolated by a single function of two variables, has been carried out in various ways ([3, 4, 5, 16]). We use a variant of the SVD method, based on the fact that the intersections of this grid of functions create a matrix (a node matrix). We simultaneously fit this matrix and the mesh which connects them. As might be expected, we speak of a skin of a mesh. This method works for arbitrary curve meshes. We begin with the simple case of a square, invertible node-matrix meshes, and extend the technique to square, non-invertible meshes, and rectangular meshes. We present here two examples from the literature for comparison with another recent approach[3], as well as a famous example from a paper by Franke [6].","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://ceadserv1.nku.edu/longa/papers/idea/idea.pdf","http://ceadserv1.nku.edu/longa/papers/idea/idea.1.pdf"],"title":"Matrix and Curve Mesh Interpolation","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

The kinetic energy distribution study shows that at a small primary fluence ∼1015 Cs+ ions/cm2, the dielectric breakdown voltage of the PVC film is reached, i.e. the minimum voltage that causes a portion of an insulator to become electrically conductive. XPS study indicates that the conducting phase created in the PVC film after energetic Cs+ bombardment consists of graphitized carbon and metallic cesium clusters. After the dielectric breakdown of the film, the positive charge, previously accumulated on the surface, is neutralized through the conductive regions, which are created in the insulating film.

The first hypothesis states that recall is higher when mood at test matches mood at input than when it does not match. The second hypothesis states that people learn more about events that match their mood state. Both hypotheses are consistent with the network model of mood and memory proposed by Bower and his colleagues. Our study was conducted to test the cited hypotheses with normal subjects (instead of highly hypnotizable subjects as in the studies by Bower et al.) and with a comparatively mild mood-induction technique. Another aim was to test different predictions from the two hypotheses.We experimentally varied mood (happy vs. sad), both at learning and at recall by using the Velten technique. Additionally, the emotional content (pleasant vs. neutral vs. unpleasant) of the text to be learned was manipulated.The empirical evidence with some restrictions favored the mood-state-dependent hypothesis and disagreed with the mood-congruity hypothesis. Possible explanations for the failure to obtain a mood-congruity effect are offered, and the results are discussed with reference to a network model of mood and memory.","inCitations":["11888baa1c32e4aede8fedbcaf14be1a5876b212","697996eb9d27c7022b84a928ebc601c82fa7f373","7bdc10735cce6db76f041c936ed0eaa5380e9502","d31d4131d5f4f41fa39ef721daa6fbc16e1ef7d3","1b44604f37ef765d552f172c61085b3c1e4e1b90","a2a4e3b92d8e32395483319deb7be9f0ebe7e68e","3750ffea4498cbd9ad5b5ee42cfebf060b76ca2d","b7875cf4de093b334dc47e7be76b5a53d1d8f9a3","b30833750276c81551afe6acd0f4927dc16db7de","2b886c1298f625bd2ac03f685139e5797b300ebe","c900e3e9b243538dbd1ccc82955e9d2f3602c940","8577719ba4b542a92512c833e994ff8edf7db4cf","cb5e51add713e929aa51153b6bba595038ebbc2c","9fe327c88a3b0f523b66701afb8469581d60a0ba"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Effects of mood on memory: Experimental tests of a mood-state-dependent retrieval hypothesis and of a mood-congruity hypothesis","doi":"10.1007/BF00309069","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/BF00309069","venue":""}

Phase 1 required firms to reduce their sulfur dioxide emissions. Enacting procedures to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions (using lower sulfur content coal or other fuel sources) could lead to higher cost, and impact the substitution between fuel and non-fuel inputs. Using a 1992-2000 panel of 34 U.S. electric utilities, empirical results indicate that the procedures electric utilities enacted to comply with Phase 1 contributed to small increases in both marginal cost and total cost. Firms having to comply with Phase 1 were more willing, than firms not subject to Phase 1, to substitute from fuel to non-fuel (labor, capital) inputs following an increase in the price of fuel. Utilities subject to Phase 1 that had a fuel clause were more willing, than Phase 1 firms without a fuel clause, to substitute from non-fuel inputs to fuel when the price of the non-fuel input increased.","inCitations":["abe09e35415836cfae7635eda90c29f8ea31c907"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"The impacts of the Clean Air Act on production cost, and the substitution between inputs in the electric utility industry ☆","doi":"10.1016/j.eneco.2013.08.021","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eneco.2013.08.021","venue":""}

SAVE is a state-of-the-art tool intended for use during system design and configuration. SAVE has a high level user friendly interface and is capable of solving much larger models (tens of thousands of states) than existing availability and reliability modeling packages. The system to be modeled is specified at the block diagram level. Parameters specifying failure rates, repair rates, operational and repair dependencies, common-mode failure occurrences, and use of spare components in hot-standby mode may be defined for each component being modeled. Evaluation criteria are given which specify the conditions under which the system is considered to be operational. A continuous time Markov chain model is automatically constructed and solved and user specified measures, namely, steady state availability, interval availability, reliability and the mean time to failure are computed. In addition, the sensitivities (derivatives) of steady state availability with respect to user specified input parameters are computed to aid in improving system availability. 1. Introducrion System availability is becoming an increasingly important factor in evaluating the behavior of commercial computer systems. This is due to the increased dependence of enterprises on continuously operating computer systems and to the emphasis on fault tolerant designs. Thus we expect quantitative evaluation of availability to be of increasing interest to computer system manufacturers. Most of the modeling work in fault-tolerant computing has focused on models of mission oriented systems with high reliability requirements such as space computers, avionics systems, wind-tunnel systems and ballistic missile defense computers. The modeling of continuously operating systems with high availability requirements such as telephone switching systems, general purpose computer systems, transaction processing systems (e.g., airline reservation systems) and communication network computers has received less attention. In this paper we describe a modeling package called the System Availability Estimator (SAVE), written in standard FORTRAN 77, which can be used to construct and solve models of both types of computer systems.","inCitations":["f440249ef5395096747fb2dde100f170edcc1f64","c578c08296715bfa4646a0bcd76200d74c61728d","c7f287c6c7ab576f1c85c4196c835f28a24fdc45","e9aaab2d1d649ddc2ee36ebd47a9f7f5d871f20a","32ca378626ec18c63977d4e46685b6d38cd02fe0","e481c839cb06b868e6d13042f08bca96afa14ed1","cd2a692613391c6bab68cac2ea386a11d435d0f0","612245c1f76afa4de897db1cf8d0ed1a742ad9e0","be330104dabc14a02eddabf06e8e9d3227de95a7","9de0c56055a56115ccb82977897fa622c7407c54","3620a86e4e51ad5281b37f81e2969a30cd8b5444","a72f8d746853e8032cc7c1ee32c1327ab68a53eb","c05049231998f1f10f099fbd0ea68a5753122ba7","100e1d7213202730a6298a9d7b8da99290884474","bb52085b3a93572e652b76968fddae148658e8ed","f9d6512ac86d5e018f82c8b54b7da9dc2ca8af0e","365d41527c9209cfb1dea720e7312ef2b1754da9","72e94727041516403dcedf245c2bd53f00b58258","968a97110eae396413a2d7a989b7981293a8045b","c132a7912fa977f0d4b04083263e539ec40112ad","a9bce570df3c0f7ca5dc507a14fe084662289fd0","b0bd7bb8451039de14cd1dc7d9fb9d7ad0b1e485","696bf17fbb5b696d113f9ea1e453405e58ec71ba","0c309d9e0dbfd257d071567598d9fe467205e39e","a891f2a2d3f537bd65bc3422f6ad1ebb8a3d1209","9e6a7f4dbdd92c0535216dd6557b05d04e8f5174","f4bf29cd0957aa993cfbe4aaa7c3b8065074abc8","420a2b1f111e023d9c8c9d5b21e36a84dc133739","9c5ded83c971fe9f4bc30d0bc443929a5ed57621","c46131d01a25adb51a3a068703e56406ea62ae84","02c4ef04834a3b9024f55457e1cd2345b2392f4f","0d4130ec87c7d9285d2ca189fec629d7be7b4bb5","0c5a0341d4f951bd16bd9802e96b74631e6a92ee","e3f318c345ee6344539136abc83b83a48c216d2d","907a3e3af83577abf1196f2c9612aaead0e875c7","cb2d3a8184dbb75110908238e42071c5f3d15915","b25f6bf23a27c3212497c5b21f5bc265fc239763","44da8db36ed59eaf4946c2430df3df67cf1f5a78","56e4b435379a73722c10935731e84a10db105625","006d85604e13c0d390bca9bef47e9dea696f2e23","d1b04790b0231b904006800deca9e3ea49fc4153","e6d58b872309a1d3777340918a100b4a95c9fcc9","7875c8483262a05d44098842cc154edb4f5c7171","d01c8c500351765280b2a5a5187430b9957f151b","0eab31a084ffd97aead25440781c910b1ac477ad","cd19aee3dd17e9e082c4c6c8ecb45075a45e79ef","ea84f168fe458d125fe10ab6fe03ce49a831417f","8ad3c340f8449ee7a83efd67d83f4f4b95f507db","0153c977ca3d7cc1a604b058270420d501279484","c01685ad64db016c3ff245f7394d48210e9f77dc","8245ea59113c3597903bef30ac86972c9c49f493","944160a2b8f2a73ff17c1278b0a9011aa7e09e7f","588d3e0735640a8c2902bafba50fe9cdee32a0c6","9dbf2cf850ccfb1422f3629960caede69ea4e612","146c229aa910943ad4b24ea06eb4087818c28a9b","3f701d0e93e06b96d2e56e71c9d01765fb98445c","c4d5f95ff4cdade71ebc2522cd5ea0f18a090cd0","93b69386f22bfdfc2522d1b41037693bf9e023d0"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"The System Availability Estimator","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

KNFF was derived from the same procedure which is used for deriving NAL-NL1. KNFF consider the long-term average speech spectrum of Korean instead of English because the frequency characteristic of Korean is different from that of English. New insertion gains of KNFF were derived using the SII (speech intelligibility index) program provided by ANSI. In addition, the insertion gains were modified to maximize the intelligibility of high frequency words. To verify effect of the new fitting gain, we performed speech discrimination test (SDT) and preference test using the hearing loss simulator from NOISH. In the SDT, a word set as test material consists of 50 1-syllable word generally used in hearing clinic. As a result of the test, in case of moderate hearing loss with severe loss on high frequency, the SDT scores of KNFF was more improved about 3.2% than NAL-NLl and about 6% in case of the sever hearing loss. Finally we have obtained the result that it was the effective way to increase gain of mid-high frequency bands and to decrease gain of low frequency bands in order to maximize speech intelligibility of Korean.","inCitations":["51f7b66781d90ad9bfe1aff942439b940d382643"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"A Study of Korean Non-linear Fitting Formula based on NAL-NL1 for Digital Hearing Aids","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Its isolated compounds exert biological activities; however, its synergistic effects are unknown. The involvement of phenolic acids (caffeic - Caf, dihydrocinnamic - Cin and p-coumaric - Cou) alone or in combination was investigated in the action of propolis in human monocytes.\n\n\nMETHODS\nCell viability was analysed by MTT assay; TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-10 production by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA); cell markers expression by flow cytometry; colony-forming units were counted to assess the microbicidal activity; and H2 O2 production was analysed by colorimetric assay.\n\n\nKEY FINDINGS\nTreatments did not affect monocytes viability. Propolis and combinations containing Caf enhanced TNF-α production by resting cells. Propolis, Cin, Cou and Caf + Cin stimulated IL-6 production. All treatments upregulated IL-10. In LPS-stimulated cells, treatments downregulated IL-6 and maintained TNF-α and IL-10 production. A lower TLR-2 expression was seen than propolis. Caf + Cin enhanced TLR-4 expression. Propolis, Caf and Caf + Cin stimulated H2 O2 production, whereas propolis, Cin, Cou, and Caf + Cin + Cou induced a higher fungicidal activity. Cin and Cin + Cou increased the bactericidal activity of human monocytes.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nPropolis activated human monocytes, and acids were involved differently in propolis activity.","inCitations":["027a21a588c6ce51aff0b455b7d422b62edb6838","5c3dddd58ec5374d5022d84686f2c139d18e06c0","52450839a85479d2fddba0f8721835f4644cfe2e","334f1e8927e29c0d5dc8610db65dadab66af088c"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Phenolic compounds alone or in combination may be involved in propolis effects on human monocytes.","doi":"10.1111/jphp.12660","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1111/jphp.12660","venue":"The Journal of pharmacy and pharmacology"}

This study explores effective heat transport in granular materials during cyclic fluid flow. Controlled particle-scale experiments, complementary analyses and numerical simulations help us identify the governing variables and ensuing time scales. We show that fluid-grain heat transfer leads to effective heat transport along the granular medium during cyclic fluid flow. At the macro-scale, the process resembles diffusion where the effective diffusion coefficient is proportional to the square of the fluid invasion length in each cycle and inversely proportional to the cycle period.

The thermal resistance network in the model has also been established, mainly to understand the next level details in this thermal model by analyzing the correlation between the air flow and the thermal resistance at each junction, and also to understand the effect of the air flow with respect to the total thermal resistance. The thermal analytic model that built has proven to be healthy and it requires 200 iterations to achieve steady state with the reasonable temperature output, and there is no convergence issue in which the continuity, momentum and energy graphs showed the healthy trend, it achieved 10-7 for continuity, energy and momentum equations. it shows that when the air flow reduces the overall thermal resistance increases, in other word, reducing the air flow will increase the thermal resistance","inCitations":["06a2fc5a44593801e236b941cc97ec116725c224"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"An Analytical Convergence Study of the Forced Air Cooling in Electronic Packaging","doi":"10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMM.819.34","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.4028/www.scientific.net%2FAMM.819.34","venue":""}

Rates of tobacco treatment delivery in primary care settings, however, remain sub-optimal. This paper reports on rationale, design, and protocol for a matched-paired, cluster-randomized controlled trial to compare the incremental effectiveness of performance coaching on physician delivery of smoking cessation assistance when delivered as part of a practice-level intervention for smoking cessation (the Ottawa Model for Smoking Cessation; OMSC). Outcome measures included frequency of provider smoking cessation treatment delivery, patient quit attempts, and 7-day point prevalence abstinence measured at 6 months, and changes in provider attitudes and beliefs related to smoking cessation treatment delivery. Primary care clinics were randomly assigned, using a matched paired design, to one of two treatment conditions: OMSC Group or OMSC+Performance Coaching Group. All practices were supported with implementing the OMSC. Half of the practices also received a 1.5 hour, skills-based, coaching session to address barriers encountered in the delivery of smoking cessation treatments and individualized performance feedback reports. All providers, and a cross sectional sample of patients from their practices, were surveyed before and after the implementation of the intervention. Multi-level modeling was used to compare intervention groups. If shown to be effective, the study will lead to an improved understanding of how to best assist clinicians to enhance the delivery of smoking cessation practice and will provide evidence to guide the design of smoking cessation interventions in primary care.\n\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION\nclinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT01603524.","inCitations":["332569087a06c76845e310f45b55bead905bdb00","c4afb39bdd637e1d61fe6e841191218da7a3c4f0","27912641240fd08496401bcbaec7e57ade4709fb","877f748d710578bd67d4fe0b672478022e33aab1"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Effectiveness of performance coaching for enhancing rates of smoking cessation treatment delivery by primary care providers: Study protocol for a cluster randomized controlled trial.","doi":"10.1016/j.cct.2015.08.013","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cct.2015.08.013","venue":"Contemporary clinical trials"}

Il est caracterise par la presence d’une population clonale de LT CD4+, presentant un noyau cerebriforme atypique, dans la peau, les ganglions lymphatiques et le sang peripherique. Apres un bilan clinique, le diagnostic de cette pathologie est confirme par l’analyse immunohistochimique d'une biopsie cutanee. Neanmoins, la cytomorphologie des cellules de Sezary circulantes n’est pas uniquement associee au SS. Notre laboratoire a identifie CD158k comme marqueur membranaire specifique des cellules de Sezary. Ce recepteur offre un interet dans le diagnostic du SS et dans le suivi de l’evolution de la pathologie. Ainsi, nos resultats montrent qu’un immuno-marquage CD3+ CD158k+, analyse en cytometrie en flux, est une technique specifique et sensible de detection de la cellule de Sezary par rapport a la cytomorphologie. Alors que dans plus de 30% des cas le SS passe inapercu durant l’examen cytomorphologique, une analyse en cytometrie en flux permet la mise en evidence de cellules tumorales residuelles. La presence systematique de CD158k a la surface des cellules de Sezary nous a conduit a rechercher l’expression d’autres KIRs. Sur les lymphocytes tumoraux circulants d’un patient ainsi que sur la lignee cellulaire correspondante, l’expression des formes activatrices et inhibitrices des recepteurs CD158a/h et CD158b/j est detectee. A la difference des lymphocytes NK et T CD8+, le recepteur presentant une fonction inhibitrice (KIR-L) ne l’emporte pas sur celui ayant une fonction activatrice (KIR-S) dans la cellule de Sezary. En fait, les KIR-L, a l’exception de CD158k, sont trouves non fonctionnels dans la cellule tumorale. Ainsi, l’engagement des formes activatrices CD158h ou CD158j permet une regulation positive de la voie de signalisation CD3-dependante de JNK et de la proliferation tumorale. Une etude fonctionnelle de la population T CD4+ KIR+, equivalent normal de la cellule de Sezary, a aussi ete realisee. Nous avons mis en evidence une expression preferentielle de la forme activatrice ou inhibitrice des recepteurs KIR homologues, selon le donneur. D’autre part, les KIRs activateurs ou inhibiteurs, exprimes a la surface des LT CD4+, jouent un role de co-recepteur vis-a-vis du TCR. Ainsi, une regulation positive ou negative de la proliferation et de la voie de signalisation CD3-dependante de ERK est observee en fonction du type de recepteur co-engage. Il est bien etabli que les KIR-S s’associent a la molecule adaptatrice KARAP/DAP12 pour la transduction d’un signal d’activation. Dans les cellules T CD4+ saines et tumorales, la proteine recrutee par ces recepteurs est encore non identifiee. Notre etude sur la population T CD4+ CD158j+ de sujets sains montre l’implication de la proteine HS1 dans la signalisation mise en place par le recepteur KIR activateur. La realisation de ce travail a permis de mieux comprendre les mecanismes mis en place a partir des KIRs dans les cellules T CD4+. Ce travail ouvre de nouvelles perspectives concernant le role de ces recepteurs dans les mecanismes permettant l'expansion tumorale des cellules de Sezary","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Caractérisation fonctionnelle des récepteurs NK à la surface des lymphocytes T CD4+ tumoraux et normaux","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Moreover, we have recently shown impaired IL-23-induced IL-17A production and STAT-3 phosphorylation in Th17 cells generated in vitro from healthy individuals heterozygous for the protective A allele (GA). However, the biological effect of this variant has not been determined in homozygous carriers of the protective A allele (AA), nor in psoriatic patients. Here we expand our functional investigation of the IL23R Arg381Gln gene variant to include AA homozygous individuals. By using isolated memory CD4+ T cells, we found attenuated IL-23-induced Th17 response in heterozygous individuals. Moreover, we found that AA homozygous individuals were strikingly unresponsive to IL-23, with minimal or no IL-17A and IL-17F production and failure of human memory Th17 cell survival/expansion. Finally, IL-23-induced Th17 response was also attenuated in age- and sex-matched GA versus GG psoriatic patients undergoing systemic treatment. Taken together, our data provide evidence for an allele-dosage effect for IL-23R Gln381 and indicate that common gene alleles associated with complex diseases might have biological effects of considerable magnitude in homozygous carriers.","inCitations":["665ce161904c3420a88ac54d661130fb66c42f60","4db7068b8ae9eefa28b027e8d5419249df20a73c","f335a527e2122a2c614b06e40bbfbfa586b9c6e7","bc9e5a6d8601f8696cb3b78dbcb063e7c69ebd0c","ef661699ab402ed89612a7d00002a6d625abe581","a27f47699fec446569d7add40739f41985d91cf4","4afe4b89f6f42cc01cc9dfb3bed2c729f0b49e26","dc70118c2ca30811b75f15ad8780480df4f65581","025cc72367cad9d19f1cb2fdff815a1ca8a2f1b5","adc7ad5a564abfd68e174dec8d125cde61003496","569c125910b74263528bef40e89e34d92fbab7f7","b46b21f7a050d93dcb8800b9582305b1ad4416a1","a9ebab1764b95a3ff17cfd1fe8cce73eff692942","cf69ae728e9bff33cc173cea96e7eaa84fe807e4","78f38d2331b3852b49bdaf35c19a517b8e740d8e","f2a9724d5ee73afa6f6fb09439dfdc9173845863","3066eff2186641d1dcc17ba8e70266fc83073ccc","8bccacad6af126a4fadee61da01963b51d216395","2e034863fe6ba545e17f4d08b5a2a1ddeeb43ee0","baab90da2850eee1d840b6ad1bc14984698872da","edea985a7443b1f89e29329f894d8d55f08132d4","49cb226aa92d7d80ff8065a84ac9d5cb71d8d347","fd9b37bf2706d3c74857403d3501644e0d8c562f","4ffb28449c6eafe72767b33df3a0ec5956645cff","7c44b4822a48844277c5753826c3b01e2dee0275","109667bcbc86eea404639bb2097ce54a6f876bf9","5311f42e1116bf33cc973fa976f856f8407d2a75","0dd6625a843f43311d580b009c7c6595a96af737","827ae2863a690c24303e6bde3007e8db4006f0fa"],"pdfUrls":["http://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/pmc/97/98/jid2013170a.PMC3778837.pdf"],"title":"The IL23R A/Gln381 Allele Promotes IL-23 Unresponsiveness in Human Memory T-Helper 17 Cells and Impairs Th17 Responses in Psoriasis Patients","doi":"10.1038/jid.2013.170","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1038/jid.2013.170","venue":"The Journal of investigative dermatology"}

We propose a classification-based approach for entity identification. We apply multiple classification techniques drawn from statistical pattern recognition, machine learning, and artificial neural network to determine whether two records from different data sources correspond to the same real-world entity. We conduct experiments to evaluate the performance of different techniques. In this paper, we review several widely used classification techniques and attribute-matching functions and report some empirical results to demonstrate the utility of our approach.","inCitations":["587b3933de9333d26b916fa2963167f6dbf83e59"],"pdfUrls":["https://aisel.aisnet.org/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1381&context=amcis2002&httpsredir=1&referer="],"title":"Applying Classification Techniques in Semanticintegration of Heterogeneous Data Sources","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Here, we investigated the roles of DF, Hertwig's epithelial root sheath (HERS), and pulp cells in the cementum and during alveolar bone formation. We cultured these cells; trans- planted them alone or in combination into immunocom- promised mice; and observed their effects at 6 and 12 weeks. Histological and immunohistochemical results revealed that DF cells formed cementum-like tissues with immunoreactivity to cementum-derived attached protein, bone sialoprotein, type I collagen, and alkaline phospha- tase. In addition, HERS cells played a role in the induction and maturation of cementum-like tissues formed by DF cells. In contrast, implants of DF cells in the presence of pulp cells led to the formation of bone-like tissues. Interestingly, in the presence of both HERS and pulp cells, DF cells formed both cementum-like and bone-like tissues. We demonstrated that while HERS cells are able to induce DF cell differentiation into cementoblasts and promote cementum formation, pulp cells could direct DF cell dif- ferentiation into osteoblasts and enhance alveolar bone formation. These results suggest that the combined use of DF, HERS, and pulp cells could direct DF cell differenti- ation into cementoblasts and/or osteoblasts in vivo, thus providing a novel strategy for the successful repair and regeneration of diseased periodontal tissue.","inCitations":["4c04fb311215096605a2a6c0f7d0dea652071c31","9fa4a57cfdae5c2dcd0829b75cd20e922b4f7916","16ba51e02f1c253595a6c648dbcb275a93544dfb","e561163b214c5cbf5ffa1a710ec378cb7f54d163","3dda221471d37d3c35ddcfbde135f14bbf0a0a2b","ab996c4defd19b3df75609262168c2ae030c3f0f","7b83fae3f19fa2cee2f390478082d2764fc16f55","f0193f6e87c1b722d249ae0a2d5b95503f31cf0e","cd09a0ae8c3c4fb25397e5c102406690faacb660","2e9c45023be22eda581aa86427c8c461b8897cd0","8497ee5f1347dfac164d0bd7c5d01f61e9e55516","36291b3f055b0907645d25a41afa27245e63c1a0","085f8f22dc8ea67f1a1075668b4e906de27c6f11","7327333cf4d828d93869166dc97f8dcf81869046","bf2663e4c3ce774921847a15b2ddc8aa2a1f133f","7fceeeea3b427c31e72306a90dbd3c76804c6518","69cb22991083a4c05c24f4969965af7dd7ebbdf9","5929804d14c8e914460882be1d95df3b065427af","74816ab175b24833bc4f844436147cd6fbaa0dfe"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Directing the differentiation of human dental follicle cells into cementoblasts and/or osteoblasts by a combination of HERS and pulp cells","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

In this activity, students are in the process of \ncomprehending the content of the text given by the teacher. In the process, the \nstudents perform some tasks given, such as finding main ideas and supporting \ndetails of the content of the texts being read. When the students can not get \nsomething from what they read, they will not get the knowledge that is a part of \nlearning. \nThe objective of this research is to find out students’ reading comprehension \nachievement between the students who are taught through Graphic Organizers \nTechnique and those who are taught through Translation Technique. \nThe researcher applied true experiment pretest posttest group design (Hatch and \nFarhady, 1982:22). The researcher selected two classes, one as experimental class \none and the other one as the experimental class two. Simple random probability \nsampling is used to select the samples. The samples are the first grade of SMA N \n5 Bandar Lampung. The writer used objective reading test in form of multiple \nchoice that was administrated in both pretest and posttest. Independent group ttest was used to analyze the data and hypothesis testing was proved by comparing \nthe means score of posttest of both classes through SPSS version 13.0 at the level \nof significance of 0.05. \nThe result showed that there is a significant difference of students’ reading \ncomprehension achievement between students who are taught by using graphic \norganizers technique and those who are taught by using translation technique. The \nsignificant increase of students’ achievement in the experimental class I (graphic \norganizers class) is (p<0.05, p=0.000) with the increase of mean in pretest and \nposttest is 17.59 points.

The SSP, GP1, and GP2 subunits of the trimeric glycoprotein complex noncovalently interact to stud the surface of virions and initiate arenavirus infectivity. Nascent glycoprotein production undergoes two proteolytic cleavage events: first within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to cleave SSP from the remaining precursor GP1/2 (glycoprotein complex [GPC]) glycoprotein and second within the Golgi stacks by the cellular SKI-1/S1P for GP1/2 processing to yield GP1 and GP2 subunits. Cleaved SSP is not degraded but retained as an essential glycoprotein subunit. Here, we defined functions of the 58-amino-acid lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) SSP in regard to glycoprotein complex processing and maturation. Using molecular biology techniques, confocal microscopy, and flow cytometry, we detected SSP at the plasma membrane of transfected cells. Further, we identified a sorting signal (FLLL) near the carboxyl terminus of SSP that is required for glycoprotein maturation and trafficking. In the absence of SSP, the glycoprotein accumulated within the ER and was unable to undergo processing by SKI-1/S1P. Mutation of this highly conserved FLLL motif showed impaired glycoprotein processing and secretory pathway trafficking, as well as defective surface expression and pH-dependent membrane fusion. Immunoprecipitation of SSP confirmed an interaction between the signal peptide and the GP2 subunit; however, mutations within this FLLL motif disrupted the association of the GP1 subunit with the remaining glycoprotein complex.\n\n\nIMPORTANCE\nSeveral members of the Arenaviridae family are neglected human pathogens capable of causing illness ranging from a nondescript flu-like syndrome to fulminant hemorrhagic fever. Infections by arenaviruses are mediated by attachment of the virus glycoprotein to receptors on host cells and virion internalization by fusion within an acidified endosome. SSP plays a critical role in the fusion of the virus with the host cell membrane. Within infected cells, the retained glycoprotein SSP plays a neglected yet essential role in glycoprotein biosynthesis. Without this 6-kDa polypeptide, the glycoprotein precursor is retained within the endoplasmic reticulum, and trafficking to the plasma membrane where SSP, GP1, and GP2 localize for glycoprotein assembly into infectious virions is inhibited. To investigate SSP contributions to glycoprotein maturation and function, we created an SSP-tagged glycoprotein to directly detect and manipulate this subunit. This resource will aid future studies to identify host factors that mediate glycoprotein maturation.","inCitations":["1fce0d1e151d447cb1f376f46c6d15154e32aff9","134b67152cf3deaeb5027cb43d6e410c625c3b42","43440b21d2c41bb86eb68097becaea539cf1f5a6","aeb70d60d544777345a499da8288ebf661738dce","6aa3f66ce4a704e80f69dd7b3a247c1cc6ba3e43","b42a8e21331e6c644e07866696004f52179f4194","527388334cf7a21ee67517790ec831023cc549cd","b1f87275a0184e41e8ff3aa26784b07b0c5fa0c9","10505e3357c100334a775ab5d1ef64fb8579333a","f802e74854981ae5d08b98596f98923e37799bdb"],"pdfUrls":["https://mbio.asm.org/content/5/6/e02063-14.full.pdf","https://cloudfront.escholarship.org/dist/prd/content/qt09x247p0/qt09x247p0.pdf?t=olsrvx","http://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/pmc/a5/ad/mBio.02063-14.PMC4217180.pdf"],"title":"Arenavirus Stable Signal Peptide Is the Keystone Subunit for Glycoprotein Complex Organization","doi":"10.1128/mbio.02063-14","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.02063-14","venue":"mBio"}

Two approaches are adopted. First, a network structure where existence of equilibrium is guaranteed and shown. Then, an example where no solution of pure Nash equilibrium is exhibited.

In order to identify these conformational changes, we have probed the sequence of steps from EP(3Na+ in) to EP + 3Na+ out with three fluorescent probes (IAF: 5-iodoacetamidofluorescein; BIPM: N-[p-(2-benzimidazolyl)phenyl]maleimide; and RH421) and the sensitivity of their fluorescence change to oligomycin and divalent cations (Ca2+ and Mn2+). The magnitude (% delta F) and rate constant (k(obs)) of ATP-induced fluorescence changes were measured on a fluorescence stopped-flow apparatus, and yielded the following results. (a) With RH421, k(obs) and % delta F varied with [Na+] (maximal k(obs) = 100 s-1, K1/2 = 6 mM; % delta Fmax = 6%, K1/2 = 1 mM); these values are comparable to those previously reported using IAF-labeled enzyme (Pratap, P.R., Robinson, J.D. and Steinberg, M.I. (1991) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 1069, 288-298). (b) With BIPM-labeled enzyme k(obs) did not vary with [Na+] over the range tested, and was twice as high as the maximum k(obs) for RH421. (c) Treatment with oligomycin reduced k(obs) for all three probes to about the same level (approximately 1-2 s-1) while % delta Fmax was largely unaffected. (d) Replacing Mg2+ with Ca2+ had similar effects to treatment with oligomycin. (e) RH421 fluorescence change was completely abolished in the presence of oligomycin and Ca2+. (f) Replacing Mg2+ with Mn2+ decreased IAF fluorescence, i.e., put the enzyme in an E2-like form, reduced k(obs), and rendered oligomycin less effective in reducing k(obs). From these results, we conclude: (a) the release of the second/third Na+ is the rate-limiting step for the conformational change measured by IAF and charge transfer measured with RH421; (b) BIPM indicates an earlier step, either the deocclusion of Na+ and/or the release of the first Na+; (c) oligomycin blocks Na+ deocclusion, and this step is sensitive to the divalent cation used to activate enzyme phosphorylation; and (d) Ca2+ slows the step reported by IAF as well. These experiments indicate that a simple model with two conformations (E1 and E2) is insufficient to explain transient kinetic data.","inCitations":["2988cb52681d0a46e308f3918d7db41833cd0c4c","deec5331757dcb6be3b92e75a42af0cd50eb9e62","a26050c520a5266a59307d4ac76d3b7965f72fe0","3c9a1e89bbb4a8c6ab9c93d4f22738774bc631ef","bd233048947004292d326eb4d65867fe306e3e95","9825c4612e931da7e2fce10cc6639cf6e5cc2e71","6ccd21e4437cdc3230cc97de7d6c8e323f4f7494","ca8535b5da39fb592c441f8e85d0cbd4969ac37a","32375700b49d270cc2361690290d1f81c3ece1f8","7d27d4462ece0eae3bae0f170f9b0b7fd826fbb3","eec6610f6147a594618595b90a27afc58b87a239"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Rapid kinetic analyses of the Na+/K(+)-ATPase distinguish among different criteria for conformational change.","doi":"10.1016/0005-2736(93)90075-B","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/0005-2736%2893%2990075-B","venue":"Biochimica et biophysica acta"}

We previously reported that high expression of somatostatin receptor type-2 (sst2) mRNA is associated to increased overall and event free survival. Several genetic abnormalities are detected in neuroblastomas, frequently involving balanced and/or unbalanced gain on the long arm on chromosome 17, the same region containing sst2 gene.\n\n\nMETHODS\nIn this study we detected balanced and/or unbalanced 17q gain in 50 neuroblastomas. Since two polymorphisms in sst2 promoter (-57 C>G and -83 A>G) were previously described as responsible for an in vitro reduction of sst2 mRNA expression, promoter sequencing was also performed in the same samples. The results were compared to sst2 mRNA expression, measured by real-time RT-PCR.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe frequency of 17q gain (14/50 neuroblastomas) was significantly associated to sst2 mRNA over-expression (Fischer's exact test: p=0.0012). The sst2 expression was significant higher both in balance and unbalance 17q amplifications (ANOVA: p=0.04). Conversely, we found a reduction of sst2 mRNA in neuroblastomas with -57 C>G promoter polymorphism (ANOVA: p=0.03).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nWe highlighted that 17q gain and promoter polymorphisms can play a role into the regulation of sst2 expression in neuroblastomas.","inCitations":["1938b02581fa21b794e41d9dd87073b82f5c6519","522aa07d255c64d5236e95fd405b1b1ec8a20ff9"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Influence of 17q gain and promoter polymorphisms on mRNA expression of somatostatin receptor type 2 in neuroblastoma.","doi":"10.1016/j.cca.2007.07.007","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cca.2007.07.007","venue":"Clinica chimica acta; international journal of clinical chemistry"}

The paper attempts to explain theoretically the variance in the proportion of expatriates used across these United States subsidiaries, drawing on the resource dependence theory. Previous research suggests that when liabilities of foreignness are high, and when there is a need to develop organizational forms that insure reliable resource flows to coordinate activities, then Japanese multinational corporations will substitute expatriates for local personnel. Data on 3,119 corporate establishments are derived from the section on the United States of Kaigai Shinshutsu Kigyo Soran [List of Japanese-Owned Firms Abroad] (Toyokeizai 1995), seeing Japanese expatriates as agents who engage in transactions of necessary resources with surrounding corporations and with the parent companies.","inCitations":["c7a465c4b5831ab5a97a552f7a6ceee1a7a0d368","6f4b6c28ae8054aa8782980cfff180c4f84c76d5","b2089bf616b1fe5f1ae85c143dbe14269649ce69","51b58b80c51d74d7779da7a0d74152b1c4cc1315","ab8a80de3a4b967145752c41be07681cdf7f1a21","a4621ba582748c488914154d2f62eef84ebd581a","28f55ecacbdbeeabada003d9bf59a8f603387197","98f053c34abce144e253bbb7dea2ad6cb629b5fb","ba6aa8e4d9e8fc117855f8278fd94fbcaffb8b71","f4fa2dc139af1cd924749eae2ca88126e53de2b7","1cdfb6b153ff0cffe8923144d32336c919c96c0e","50855bc17553b05ca56e2bbd375e35f544f18e43","18ca0f681a451cc19e5c140f9c2d3d4a1c2424a3"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Liability of Foreignness and the Uses of Expatriates in Japanese Multinational Corporations in the United States","doi":"10.1111/j.1475-682X.2000.tb00898.x","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1475-682X.2000.tb00898.x","venue":""}

The relationship between LDL-C reduction and rates of elevated liver enzymes, rhabdomyolysis, and cancer per 100,000 person-years was assessed using weighted univariate regression.\n\n\nRESULTS\nIn 23 statin treatment arms with 309,506 person-years of follow-up, there was no significant relationship between percent LDL-C lowering and rates of elevated liver enzymes (R2 <0.001, p = 0.91) or rhabdomyolysis (R2 = 0.05, p = 0.16). Similar results were obtained when absolute LDL-C reduction or achieved LDL-C levels were considered. In contrast, for any 10% LDL-C reduction, rates of elevated liver enzymes increased significantly with higher statin doses. Additional analyses demonstrated a significant inverse association between cancer incidence and achieved LDL-C levels (R2 = 0.43, p = 0.009), whereas no such association was demonstrated with percent LDL-C reduction (R2 = 0.09, p = 0.92) or absolute LDL-C reduction (R2 = 0.05, p = 0.23).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nRisk of statin-associated elevated liver enzymes or rhabdomyolysis is not related to the magnitude of LDL-C lowering. However, the risk of cancer is significantly associated with lower achieved LDL-C levels. These findings suggest that drug- and dose-specific effects are more important determinants of liver and muscle toxicity than magnitude of LDL-C lowering. Furthermore, the cardiovascular benefits of low achieved levels of LDL-C may in part be offset by an increased risk of
