This paper proposes a novel voltage regulation framework in distribution systems through the general types of Soft Open Points (SOPs) and reactive powers of DG inverters. By using the linearized DistFlow equations, we establish a biconvex problem that minimizes voltage deviation via a well-coordinated scheme for SOPs and DGs. The coordination of different types of power electronic devices can be simultaneously modelled into this problem which can be efficiently solved by alternative convex search algorithm. The proposed approach is validated by numerical simulations on modified IEEE 15-bus system, IEEE 33-bus system, and IEEE 69-bus system with different types of power electronic compensators.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"A general coordinated voltage regulation method in distribution networks with soft open points","doi":"10.1016/j.ijepes.2019.105571","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijepes.2019.105571","venue":""}

During those years, the price for commercial scholarly published books exceeded the SRP for university presses in the humanities, the social sciences, and in the scientific, technical, and medical categories, and commercial presses annually released more than three times the number of scholarly books than university presses did in these major book categories. Were these new title output and pricing trends between 1989 and 2011 also evident in 2012–14? What pricing and marketing theories and practices did commercial scholarly publishers use to enable them to charge higher SRPs than university presses?

Little attention, however, has been paid to quality control methods for this formulation. Hence, a rapid and sensitive analytical technique is urgently needed for the evaluation of LiuweiDihuang preparations to assess its quality and pharmacological functionality. In this study, an ultra high performance liquid chromatography dual-wavelength method was developed to simultaneously determine 11 constituents in LiuweiDihuang preparations. This robust approach provided a fast and comprehensive quantitative determination of the major bioactive markers within LiuweiDihuang preparations. To distinguish four dosage forms of LiuweiDihuang preparations, a random forest technique was applied on the spectrometric fingerprint data obtained. This combination approach of chromatographic techniques and data analyses might serve as a rapid and efficient tool to ensure the quality of LiuweiDihuang preparations and other Chinese medicinal formulations and can support quality control and scientific research into the pharmacological potential for these formulations.","inCitations":["aa993857722f042407d6b0fa8e002dd64306c728","8e31738351d5dda3b870663e4d7b705c00ad9e73","6383eca0d7df1cb27039c40b6b463e1496d34d3f","2a52268f6e0370f19a1cf019a48664a440883892","7cb5b64528d56a7428ee841b0439deb98edf7adb","0ece8fb66dea09167d15d70476b03a529aaf1f21","03d8005bf70a40e5f4ceaaec03ee15bab38ab8cf"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Quantitative and qualitative determination of LiuweiDihuang preparations by ultra high performance liquid chromatography in dual-wavelength fingerprinting mode and random forest.","doi":"10.1002/jssc.201500560","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1002/jssc.201500560","venue":"Journal of separation science"}

Estrogen receptors are much less of a lock-and-key interaction than highly specific ones. The ER is nonspecific enough to permit binding with a diverse array of chemical structures. There are three primary ER binding subpockets, each with different requirements for hydrogen bonding.\n\n\nRESULTS\nMore than 900 compounds approved as of FCM components were evaluated for their potential to bind on ER. All evaluated chemicals were subcategorized to five groups with respect to the binding potential to ER: very strong, strong, moderate, weak binder, and no binder to ER. In total 46 compounds were characterized as potential disturbers of estrogen receptor.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nAmong the group of selected chemicals, compounds with high and even very high affinity to the ER binding subpockets were found. These compounds may act as gene activators and cause adverse effects in the organism, particularly during pregnancy and breast-feeding. It should be considered to carry out further in vitro or in vivo tests to confirm their potential to disturb the regulation of physiological processes in humans by abnormal ER signaling and subsequently remove these chemicals from the list of approved food contact materials.","inCitations":["f9ff8a9572fb1e3c317e566a050b4064b95eeccc","7a22c966f0c4ceab7b01d48bfe4c4f21927b7199"],"pdfUrls":["https://cejph.szu.cz/pdfs/cjp/2016/03/13.pdf","http://apps.szu.cz/svi/cejph/archiv/2016-3-13-full.pdf"],"title":"Estrogen Receptor Binding Affinity of Food Contact Material Components Estimated by QSAR.","doi":"10.21101/cejph.a4813","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.21101/cejph.a4813","venue":"Central European journal of public health"}

Schwannoma-derived growth factor (SDGF) and amphiregulin (AR) are members of this family. SDGF has high sequence homology to AR, and is known to be not only a potent mitogen for astrocytes and fibroblasts but also a neurotrophic factor. We previously confirmed that the synthetic EGF-like peptides SDGF(38-80) and AR(44-84), corresponding to the EGF-like domain of mouse SDGF and human AR, respectively, formed similar disulfide bond patterns to that of EGF. In the present study, we further investigated the biological actions of these two EGF-like peptides on several cultured cell lines. We found that SDGF(38-80) and AR(44-84) have weak mitogenic activity in NIH/3T3 cells and weak binding affinity to the EGF receptor on the surface of A431 cells compared with EGF. However, SDGF(38-80) and EGF induced short neurite outgrowth in PC12 h cells, a subclone of PC12 cells, at 100 nM. In addition, a significant increase in acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity induced by SDGF(38-80) was observed at a concentration similar range to that of EGF, which is known as a differentiation marker of these cells. The effect of AR(44-84) in PC12 h cells was weaker than those of SDGF(38-80) and EGF, but the AChE activity was significantly increased by the addition of 100 nM AR(44-84), which did not stimulate NIH/3T3 cell growth. These results also suggest that SDGF(38-80) and AR(44-84) may be effective for neuronal differentiation rather than proliferation.","inCitations":["6b23546aae4b970fa1e10cb6dc484fec8b9e8f4d","bd79df230709660acadaf39fa4d448d637109307","e8306fad96baab06bf23fb5841d918f638a1970a","e978a04ef7ea0cee9ebcb8e590a0d6595e5e8c40"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Biological actions of the epidermal growth factors-like domain peptides of mouse schwannoma-derived growth factor and human amphiregulin.","doi":"10.1034/j.1399-3011.1999.00004.x","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1034/j.1399-3011.1999.00004.x","venue":"The journal of peptide research : official journal of the American Peptide Society"}

The optimized geometries show that the two doping iridium atoms can affect the structure of the host cluster. Compared with the pure Aun+2 clusters, the lowest energy AunIr2 (n=1 - 7) clusters favour higher spin multiplicity except for Au7Ir2. Furthermore, the calculated binding energies, fragmentation energies, second-order difference energies, and the highest occupied-lowest unoccupied energy gaps indicate that the stability of AunIr2 is enhanced. Natural population analysis reveals that the charges transfer from the Aun frames to the iridium atoms for Au3;4;6;7Ir2 clusters. In addition, charges and magnetic moments of 6s, 5d, and 6p states for the iridium atoms in AunIr2 (n = 1 - 7) clusters are also analyzed and compared.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://www.znaturforsch.com/s67a/s67a0729.pdf"],"title":"Structural and Electronic Properties of Stable AunIr2 (n = 1 – 7) Clusters: Comparison with Pure Gold Clusters","doi":"10.5560/zna.2012-0086","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.5560/zna.2012-0086","venue":""}

Photosensitive retinal ganglion cells send unconscious information about environmental illumination to non-visual brain centres including the human body's master biological clock in the suprachiasmatic nuclei. This information permits human physiology to be optimised and aligned with geophysical day-night cycles using neural and hormonal messengers including melatonin. Age-related transmittance spectra of crystalline lenses and photopic pupil diameter are used with the spectral sensitivity of melatonin suppression and the transmittance spectra of intraocular lenses (IOLs) to analyse how ageing and IOL chromophores affect circadian photoreception.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAgeing increases crystalline lens light absorption and decreases pupil area resulting in progressive loss of circadian photoreception. A 10-year-old child has circadian photoreception 10-fold greater than a 95-year-old phakic adult. A 45-year-old adult retains only half the circadian photoreception of early youth. Pseudophakia improves circadian photoreception at all ages, particularly with UV-only blocking IOLs which transmit blue wavelengths optimal for non-visual photoreception.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nNon-visual retinal ganglion photoreceptor responses to bright, properly timed light exposures help assure effective circadian photoentrainment and optimal diurnal physiological processes. Circadian photoreception can persist in visually blind individuals if retinal ganglion cell photoreceptors and their suprachiasmatic connections are intact. Retinal illumination decreases with ageing due to pupillary miosis and reduced crystalline lens light transmission especially of short wavelengths. Inadequate environmental light and/or ganglion photoreception can cause circadian disruption, increasing the risk of insomnia, depression, numerous systemic disorders and possibly early mortality. Artificial lighting is dimmer and less blue-weighted than natural daylight, contributing to age-related losses in unconscious circadian photoreception. Optimal intraocular lens design should consider the spectral requirements of both conscious and unconscious retinal photoreception.","inCitations":["fa1261ba98f20d1ad8eb6d1c7ef5e8e6a7456914","b1f68390366657cff1d0c8d71b6266d6bc477804","bd90e5521fd138e29a08b84b70d331237b8a5546","5ffa393043a5041ec604497ea1832871ea4b13aa","f9e07a36bebcd033ecaa8c63d146fa48649fc041","c9d1cede5fb395db6aa55fcf31221e445836ad3a","e8a7907a115ec2ebec6b540cdf99afe6d53241c1","648b31637a16ccceab9c092595d352dbe31951f5","4017dbb3151884e1811a6b03b286867cf1737675","48f94195b8e0ef7d65196ea163e230e159e016a5","ba5f23184563546aa7cdfe430f83004ef6820bbc","14636adccc8fd84bbcdb4979a453bfaae28c480f","c6b76c3801a5df94c005d6125711e4b7e3d9d1bf","2fe7d20107f81423e9c0129bc41a886ce85b1e12","310de1af253be297a5afd311f000171cfac2ba02","d573ccc1559255ceee2ba889f3566e1afe657341","30dd98a27bac6554099e5f777db239c2fd94c74a","01362ee9a4bf17fdb4100eedea741201b3e089d8","316e9c5b0265e2670d12972fdcefe6260a473eee","32a1c8b3cc926efab9ba2a51fdc17e0d4b8abb9c","e4de6cd390dbf163fbe13680e57ea1d7115ca5e8","4b52ad8d9aafabdac59642449d3fd9b35e792a07","1552c00f9cb8366d95db875dbe0aa1dbb6b5b5d9","2699d8cfb2fc4d64f60756735a25b4c0bf3a9798","ac9dec53f13c8151b2ef9bb753110510354004bb","fb6735e0a6aa54c4ddb3ce4c3e2381e2e5011ac5","fdfc2c0477cb174e206b57681b0e4931406f2576","23f6dbc2b3e97c509c02b6a7f5155e36c34e3bd1","36bf76d1304911ff5363f638a1238ffbc01be89c","018f954a9928db1c57b698f3774816a88de90ffa","bdd4995463bfef2a5195a50edbfe7eee3f875638","144a650bf7a6121407d9f5ed6e0ffcbce860b510","087f2b807414abddd714bf0190414f7e025086b9","7296c153a0b66fdd3111d90dfd957b570cdbe51c","8bfe8e7d5bd9da9c66926490f4b48c1b4752e4b8","28d62d3a7e21b404347e37b0c8027f1d1269e475","7d0606b9a220e57bbfea9f8f7349c5f026a720ff","0039bc39b4357b7aae8176fe562bbecf14aca32d","a88ea4fd3f79f1bca6d8f0166ca7aae4c68024c4","6a41169bf1d0c0a7ad6baf6f32813ecfa34c96d1","94522f8ef0490186e68fcd5ad3ddddbe567844d8","49d7fea7d2774cf419c894bb673f3bb2ca0ab28e","5bfff136a77d5cf66ba6920c87c33a14eff77171","bf0d2fe1a30f5788ab00cec4a9c0213cbeb16e3b","afb3917e7ff91e015f621c6185fe39e58de92a68","a587cfae791841f4397e6198616fd2d60d750e54","e2cbb252666a26d867f896b3e0857719a41f48ab","ba15876d564be4ba5042a5f0b11c468f241d0ea4","19e6c43252fd95d408df3e38e15cea457a63b269","ef291dce5807ef15c95cba72fd55921bc2609576","2114a15f669ba2821c2262803271fa2338ca8de3","15c9bbb3556c8757b887d63f3d19eac8d27a4c75","be66933a8e1fdede1754fe22cac90aefc79c66d7","e983af4e5661af399f36e6038182e923907a7fcc","620a9f9c99cf5af238006b13095410b3edcf1f3b","2c03c4614f9a357c2a57e8e181e4a92a74692b5b","96ee4f7e6a708464aaec5fb3afbdf7840dfea123","02f3385fa3c1b270165a0243a0afac1de78b8016","4e4994b4f26caf0c0f4a7f23d5fb0a2625585fa1","2240818d9a2a5c9dcacd1b60688e4857019d1d11","9b0b0e2b9c8081e1f8a46d3c5162f76dc2d311e3","78064bae270e970649bc882a9c6272ccfcdbe05a","b83bf4a1e957ba2b58feb47066bfa047547d98c3","58d46166fe89f31c0649ffadfb3d40a31c0b4623","34d806bd2fbdfeb48d797126fbfb02379f417198","522e9c6c1f74ad06c1197ffdb7c6fc3d05e893c9","b2cddfaff11e210909079f2da68df27f6cb3b0ac","5ad6ab09b0d351ea1b32b16029390720bc538726","db26ec6309af3e4c454afeafba8135eedd5a0a4a","a37a4198d3605fa46d8b9c41f4f934a1a7252954","f2bf6d2e6042cc216cc0b04ff09f6c979fd667bc","48afc32b88a2eb45c2b09a3878aea83d0433a9e0","61b0f1e9c91933255ff45c388a06faaec563cf2e","1c6caed8fb611b09a7a952e023950478cf4f1772","d933c3e4cce2a818a85ce9eb0dc65bcbed47fac0","1b14672f902d146ba0f455a29433c44bffb7df8d","ae6e3fe1ff09cfa15f4ef3e4970bfd7d22518b3a","492030e04c58a7af285403705041c438d62079e7","776495381a95209e5ae86cee8df508e2bfe3b071","c4e34ef4e1cba4ad05a4387cc7a0ab6467d5f1d0","bd9696657fe4604955ce53af3ae33ea2a34061eb","9b1645c63dd3dc2da61c8d7cfecd370b08c84399","d062c01d4f5186d4cae7d6ff84a04a47e17b51f0","b7daf596c765886c835e531de8219321ec913458","0cd23db9571d7433a48fe12ad616ea2e45df4ee8","f76ead04cef48374a4af9d689a2dd6c08eb3936e","3dac5cf474338adf3bb5ad9436ce8dc491fdc736","768e9e00ddcf04936ea9f1a7a11d9d0c57a9bfb1","412fb79cf9e9b99c1986536dc136839dd0714015","48f96265ca05b9c9dc796e9439ef38da0e1e9871","8ca0510d7c9aed1bff3248b6d9f1db51c0f45f69","8b40cabe0540fe53bb30a20684e4a139c535a783","4fd33781924ffc53948a04a77941edac106ca9ce","d56479adc19951efa3a0094d95193bc78b305f2b","974b4bd886bc46d0b6f15a18a8f6bd9af3574b62","7f68577975477a68944a6becf37d6d4a10dbbf17","9a5745e3dd429256787996f2e1ec30a66b07803b","a9a803dd57831e6c492c1a657ac938b178d068ba","cdd0d81e41103052ded30ee6ff5a77135d3fc59a","738ec80c3bc0c9541f52f9b11d92203664e4a271","5b264dc47860114ff463ae1c293c8b5be8bcfd00","3386e5f57e293f9d3bc0b5dd80e27f0cbb0c8d64","3be45044b4833d7caf2b1c26af934ac7bdd27d10","04087d1df6b9c7e32687a604d38edc00cc023403","80fa3b44500dae25727c317185686f18cf3cc06d","934f09d919e81fd1753f7e6dde041e0ece0d41e2","06545ffec504db30c702fb48f232f2c686ad8786","4c92d93a672700d872b86e5c4c730c268e317e98","312a0682fcb07aebcd216f08a7d70d03150e559c","90ad6ca2645b3e9783cbec263d3d6ee0d4ec7eb1","7f1a4efe855d3b4cff431376212e5c9fa5eae5bd","860da7b99cfd05a381a3bd9478b8b68819b9048f","b2ebffa3252b66339c5cb2cb9266143938f4c38f","63e19a33f9b3236ffbb3f1727ad04d9c66f9a812","2c89526d06bf13983f54526da7dd77a50836ae73","5918db7ee62dd33f7f65d0

We examine the accuracy of popular recognizers for gestures produced by people with and without visual impairments, and we show that the user-independent accuracy of $P, the best recognizer among those evaluated, is small for people with low vision (83.8%), despite $P being very effective for gestures produced by people without visual impairments (95.9%). By carefully analyzing the gesture articulations produced by people with low vision, we inform key algorithmic revisions for the P recognizer, which we call P+. We show significant accuracy improvements of $P+ for gestures produced by people with low vision, from 83.8% to 94.7% on average and up to 98.2%, and 3x faster execution times compared to P.","inCitations":["144463fe0c4782604c8a2a9a5f7fa9b2e1c52de0","0461d754f94c3a7fd20a4cd27d8c602e14c9c6d4","1c310384ea313df76b611a97d44c316c9a100efe","b0be57560f3221f5f7e7def783ea3adeb41108ec","ca32b565a6992fffedc6ac72d96063e87c44416f","16688d259935d1f2ed90e6ba3e9a251f5194c01d","4742d31415f15b132db8690ceac52b325f27b0c8","bbbbf26edcceed2fcc8de98a1fe8cc3233608790","37fe445294e9ce6740109a203fe5aa301b6294e4","850e4a47ac6137db280a910c4112d5587e64e89e","d553e6cce99a1a71a066df3ce40317e13ee8551b"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.eed.usv.ro/mintviz/publications/CHI2017_1.pdf","https://depts.washington.edu/madlab/proj/dollar/chi-17.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/3025453.3025941"],"title":"Improving Gesture Recognition Accuracy on Touch Screens for Users with Low Vision","doi":"10.1145/3025453.3025941","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1145/3025453.3025941","venue":"CHI '17"}

Glucose and maltose did not stimulate proliferation of petunia shoots. Either the lack of carbon source or its high concentration (50 g · dm) was completely ineffective in rooting induction for both cvs. ‘Prism White’ and ‘Prism Rose’. In ‘Prism White’ the highest mean values for microshoot number together with the highest number of new shoots per one explant was obtained on the medium containing 30 g · dm of fructose. Considering ‘Prism Rose’, the more favorable sugar source and concentration for shoot length was obtained on medium with 30 g · dm of sucrose. The highest number of adventitious roots produced per shoot of petunia ‘Prism White’ was obtained on medium supplemented with 40 g · dm of glucose and for petunia ‘Prism Rose’ – 30 g · dm sucrose and maltose.

It has been shown that the justification of public support for energy investments in the social housing stock is an attempt to counteract climate changes, reduce energy poverty among low-income households as well as to promote local workplaces and economic development in a given area. The cohesion policy of the European Union may actively contribute to strengthening its dynamics and ensure a leverage effect which in turn will lead to the use of other, additional sources of finance. In accordance with the guidelines of the European Commission, the housing stock has been qualified to be subject to support from structural funds in the new financial perspective until 2020, especially in terms of thermomodernisation and promotion of renewable sources of energy, integrated actions aiming at developing urban areas and combating exclusion by providing access to dwellings to marginalised communities and offering high quality, affordable social services.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Combating energy poverty in the social housing stock","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Diurnal rock-turning surveys were conducted in southern WV during the summer and fall of 2006 to assess the species' population status in this area and to examine the relationship between stream physico-chemical characteristics and site occupancy. Survey results suggest that Eastern Hellbender populations are rare in southern WV, with Eastern Hellbender present at only ≈15% of all sites surveyed and only ≈20% of sites where they have been documented historically. Logistic regression models showed that presence of increased gravel substrate and specific conductivity reduced the probability of site occupancy by Eastern Hellbenders. It is not clear why a higher proportion of gravel substrate negatively affected site occupancy, because gravel should benefit Eastern Hellbender populations by providing larval habitat and habitat for prey species. The effect of specific conductivity may indicate a negative impact of watershed disturbance on populations. This explanation is supported by a principal component analysis of habitat characteristics followed by logistic regression, which demonstrated that sites with habitat characteristics indicative of more degraded sites (e.g., higher specific conductivity) decreased the probability of a site being occupied by Eastern Hellbenders. The results of our study suggest that Eastern Hellbender populations may be severely threatened in southern WV and that site occupancy by Eastern Hellbenders is related to both the physical nature of stream substrate and to water quality characteristics. Furthermore, this study indicates a need for research investigating the potential for human land-use to adversely affect Eastern Hellbenders.","inCitations":["5a1419e921650e1ba31a833170c9f125b0dab38e","b27ac4788714184e4eae2851c89d9f5754bb4fd1","52f337dca7a600be719c13479a5fb7ad29540cd1","ffab1cf12b4bd3bfa5a6aa6ca650c45c23c47e6d","045c5cf4cc02486bd8377f2faea46d1cfc569ded"],"pdfUrls":["https://ag.purdue.edu/fnr/discover/HerpetologyLab/Documents/Keitzer_SiteOccupancy.pdf"],"title":"Stream Characteristics Associated with Site Occupancy by the Eastern Hellbender, Cryptobranchus alleganiensis alleganiensis, in Southern West Virginia","doi":"10.1656/045.020.0418","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1656/045.020.0418","venue":""}

The spectrum of the extended emission was obtained with a high signal-to-noise ratio in a spatially-resolved manner using the X-ray Imaging Spectrometer (XIS). We established that the contamination by unresolved point sources, the Galactic Ridge X-ray emission, the cosmic X-ray background, and the local hot bubble emission is negligible in the background-subtracted XIS spectrum of the diffuse emission. Half a dozen of emission lines were resolved clearly for the first time, including K lines of highly ionized O, Ne, and Mg as well as L series complex of Fe at 0.5--1.5 keV. Based on the diagnosis of these lines, we obtained the following results: (1) the extended emission is an optically-thin thermal plasma represented well by a single temperature of 3.0 +/- 0.4 MK, (2) the abundances of elements with emission lines in the diffuse spectrum are 0.1--0.3 solar, while those of bright discrete sources are 0.3--1.5 solar, (3) the metal abundances relative to each other in the diffuse emission are consistent with solar except for a Ne enhancement of a factor of 2, (4) both the plasma temperature and the chemical composition of the diffuse emission show no spatial variation across the studied spatial scale of about 5 pc.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://arxiv.org/pdf/0707.4074v1.pdf","https://arxiv.org/pdf/0707.4074v2.pdf"],"title":"Suzaku Spectroscopy of Extended X-Ray Emission in M17","doi":"10.1093/pasj/60.sp1.S85","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1093/pasj%2F60.sp1.S85","venue":""}

Two cases are identified corresponding to the value of the average Mach number $\\overline{M}$ across the upstream boundary layer approaching the compression ramp. The flow is referred to as supercritical for $\\overline > 1$ and subcritical for $\\overline{M} . The interaction is described by triple-deck theory, and numerical results are given for both cases for various ramp angles and levels of wall cooling. The effect of wall cooling on the absolute instability described recently by Cassel, Ruban & Walker (1995) for an uncooled wall is of particular interest; a stabilizing effect is observed for supercritical boundary layers, but a strong destabilizing influence occurs in the subcritical case. Wall cooling also influences the location and size of the separated region. For supercritical flow, progressive wall cooling reduces the size of the recirculating-flow region, the separation point moves downstream, and upstream influence is diminished. In contrast for the subcritical case downstream influence is reduced with increased cooling. In either situation, a sufficient level of wall cooling eliminates separation altogether for the ramp angles considered. The present numerical results closely confirm the strong wall cooling theory of Kerimbekov, Ruban & Walker (1994).","inCitations":["85124ea478712e37f20d8e7e38ced0fc4bcd80cf","7087cf59e331d82900bf114e230bc668b49f8fdd"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"The influence of wall cooling on hypersonic boundary-layer separation and stability","doi":"10.1017/S0022112096007690","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1017/S0022112096007690","venue":""}

The objective of this study was to investigate whether an external quality assessment scheme (EQAS) designed for office laboratories could improve the quality of SMBG measurements.\n\n\nMETHODS\nFrom October 2001 through March 2004, we conducted 6 glucose surveys for diabetes patients and coordinated them with an EQAS for office laboratories. Patients received 2 control samples by post twice a year. They measured each control sample in duplicate in accordance with written instructions, returned the results, and received an assessment of their analytical performance. Participants who got a poor evaluation were followed up by phone and were offered guidance.\n\n\nRESULTS\nParticipating in an EQA program over a period of 3 years decreased the percentage of poor results among diabetes patients significantly, from 11.2% to 1.9% in the first and last surveys, respectively. Between-participant CVs improved from 5.5% to 3.7% and were comparable to results from office laboratories. It was difficult to sort out factors contributing to quality improvement.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nImplementing a traditional EQAS among diabetes patients may improve the analytical quality of SMBG and could be convenient for motivated patients. Further evaluation of the clinical usefulness of implementing such a program is needed, however, and costs as well as limitations of current EQAS for glucose in general should be taken into account.","inCitations":["2d96546165ecac65c363a53eab6f24463933d469","91282d45c67c73cb08ab857008902276f20e0b12","1359cbc4b539c93774dbc36bf33d50887e8983c7","6843b0bc287554534031c80716235ef27c94aa51","f16cf6a739a2611e3c5ddee5ef1a6173073c1d07","69051ebae95d7b34180472399896cb3f63338d33","8af5f273b9b4822d28ccde780fd1fbdac47aab38","fd35f0f52edca9e02aa0d7f5aa8afab5b0f2e5d3","c4c87717421c2fc0a7148297f420c6933d7d63d7","c5e8b2eb46afad287f1d2d608bdcb9697642c95c","768438f264a9eefaf72b7277bc844c5a70d75be3","703a3f30de88352f7ad202b92de38d1003e14130","bd598eb2a5ce4c07d70035a377e97deab131c93b","a999421871606974a0efb6b6a766a1af9b587340"],"pdfUrls":["http://clinchem.aaccjnls.org/content/clinchem/early/2006/05/11/clinchem.2006.068114.full.pdf"],"title":"Results and feasibility of an external quality assessment scheme for self-monitoring of blood glucose.","doi":"10.1373/clinchem.2006.068114","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1373/clinchem.2006.068114","venue":"Clinical chemistry"}

The present study used an immunohistochemical double-labeling approach to determine whether intracisternally injected L-proline in freely moving rats, which increases blood pressure, activates hypothalamic vasopressin-expressing neurons and ventral medullary tyrosine-hydroxylase- (TH-) containing neurons. Following injection of L-proline, the number of activated hypothalamic neurons that coexpressed vasopressin and c-Fos was much greater in the supraoptic nucleus (SON) than in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of rats with increased blood pressure. The number of activated TH-containing neurons was significantly greater following L-proline treatment than following control injections of artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF). These results clearly demonstrate that intracisternally injected L-proline activates hypothalamic supraoptic, but not paraventricular, vasopressin-expressing neurons and medullary TH-containing (A1/C1) neurons in freely moving rats.","inCitations":["b734d0c8b2371e52e0e28b61e93cbb751a9e3ca5","666040acffd03f4622f6e43189eea46b51fc0e3a","aea6561894b289f975839acdeaf784e4eaaf875d","06aa5a828b23fc9a11bc394ce6cd38160201ef13"],"pdfUrls":["http://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/pmc/ce/8a/JAA2011-230613.PMC3268034.pdf","ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/pmc/ce/8a/J_Amino_Acids_2011_Oct_16_2011_230613.tar.gz","http://downloads.hindawi.com/archive/2011/230613.pdf"],"title":"Intracisternally Injected L-Proline Activates Hypothalamic Supraoptic, but Not Paraventricular, Vasopressin-Expressing Neurons in Conscious Rats","doi":"10.4061/2011/230613","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.4061/2011%2F230613","venue":"Journal of amino acids"}

Photoluminescence was excited in the first electron transition band of pyrene and the above photoconductive polymers. It is found that, at concentrations of 0.05–0.50 mol l−1, pyrene is effective in quenching the fluorescence of PMPS, PEPC, and PVK but has only a slight effect on the photoemission efficiency of geminate electron-hole pairs. As a result, the phosphorescence of pyrene in photoconductive polymers is excited both by the intersystem crossing from the first excited singlet state (S1 ⇝ T1) and by the capture of triplet excitons created in the recombination of charge pairs. In addition, in PEPC and PVK, the phosphorescence of pyrene is excited by recombination of a captured hole with an electron. For this reason, the ratio of the quantum yields of phosphorescence and fluorescence of pyrene in photoconductive polymers is much larger than that in PS, wherein the T1 state of pyrene is populated by intersystem crossing S1 ⇝ T1 only.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Excitation of phosphorescence of pyrene implanted into a photoconductive polymer","doi":"10.1134/S1063783407050149","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1134/S1063783407050149","venue":""}

The ICP reactor is driven by a single turn radio-frequency current coil at 13.56 MHz. Robot assisted optical emission tomography was used in order to obtain radial profiles of emission at different distances from the coil thus giving effectively a three dimensional distribution of the net excitation rate as well as the number density of excited states. Under some conditions azimuthal symmetry of the discharge is broken mostly at higher pressures and higher powers. We have covered a range of pressures between 15 and 500 mTorr and powers between 50 W and 400 W. The conditions for producing a uniform distribution of excited atoms as a representative of active species, are discussed.","inCitations":["20fed41c3f15f67a83fe247f751b75efa4bc9143","50a364b38bfa7b283655b6d859c1ae6d2d5ad26b","ae4abd9a136fd2a9be9d5733cb645b091b891fbb","c9178ee99980b02300c25f75749d97bb53a0200a","0e19afed1c3319cacea072f07ce22a3e68f0b5e1","48bf8c334a99d5c9c403d9d05a526283033bf275","912c1ed73b182e166f4d3461cbcbafbece3f689b","9c21c7853cebdc2aea3237f514267801b2f2ed2e","d3d8e6e5def08ff24f28f072b94ad866f8657823","4dfd2c9526969ea6cc19a80d193f7340e60695d3"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Three dimensional optical emission tomography of an inductively coupled plasma","doi":"10.1143/JJAP.36.4605","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1143/JJAP.36.4605","venue":""}

This paper builds a real options model that provides a microeconomic analytical framework with the Least Squares Monte Carlo (LSM) method to assess the investment choices of a typical solar panel producer in China facing trade and domestic supply- and demand-side policy uncertainties. It builds a baseline scenario and three policy scenarios with decreasing anti-dumping and countervailing charges, constant feed-in tariff (FIT) level and reduced investment cost. A typical producer will have to make an investment decision on building a new production line in five years based on a decision impact analysis within 20 years. The result shows an immediate investment decision for all scenarios. The producer will have higher return from investment in building a solar power plant with a constant FIT. Export is the optimal choice in other scenarios where investment return is lower. After sensitivity analysis, the paper concludes and can be used as a toolkit for solar panel producers and a reference for policy makers to evaluate the impact of policy uncertainties.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Policy uncertainties: What investment choice for solar panel producers?","doi":"10.1016/j.eneco.2018.11.022","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eneco.2018.11.022","venue":""}

From the conducted research, it was found that the consolidation processes and microstructural characteristics—grain growth inhibitors, grain size of the starting WC powders and η-phase—influenced the electrochemical corrosion resistance. η-phase enhanced the formation of a passive layer on the samples’ surfaces, thereby reducing the tendency of the sample dissolution and increasing the stability of oxides forming therewith a passive layer on the sample surface.","inCitations":["164be857265b6f6025fca688d962140c8e42bf45"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Electrochemical Corrosion Behavior of Near-Nano and Nanostructured WC-Co Cemented Carbides","doi":"10.3390/met7030069","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.3390/met7030069","venue":""}

The extent to which health insurance can mitigate the effects of the social determinants of health on cancer care is unknown. METHODS: This study linked the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results registries to US Census data to study patients diagnosed with the 4 leading causes of cancer deaths between 2007 and 2011. A county‐level social determinant score was developed with 5 measures of wealth, education, and employment. Patients were stratified into quintiles, with the lowest quintile representing the most disadvantaged communities. Logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate associations and cancer‐specific survival. RESULTS: A total of 364,507 patients aged 18 to 64 years were identified (134,105 with breast cancer, 106,914 with prostate cancer, 62,606 with lung cancer, and 60,882 with colorectal cancer). Overall, patients from the most disadvantaged communities (median household income, $42,885; patients below the poverty level, 22%; patients completing college, 17%) were more likely to present with distant disease (odds ratio, 1.6; P < .001) and were less likely to receive cancer‐directed surgery (odds ratio, 0.8; P < .001) than the least disadvantaged communities (median income, $78,249; patients below the poverty level, 9%; patients completing college, 42%). The differences persisted across quintiles regardless of the insurance status. The effect of having insurance on cancer‐specific survival was more pronounced in disadvantaged communities (relative benefit at 3 years, 40% vs 31%). However, it did not fully mitigate the effect of social determinants on mortality (hazard ratio, 0.75 vs 0.68; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Cancer patients from disadvantaged communities benefit most from health insurance, and there is a reduction in disparities in outcome. However, the gap produced by social determinants of health cannot be bridged by insurance alone. &NA; Individuals from disadvantaged communities are among the millions of uninsured Americans gaining insurance under the Affordable Care Act. This study examines whether health insurance and better access to care can mitigate the effects of the social determinants of health on cancer care for the leading 4 causes of cancer deaths in the United States.","inCitations":["06c68631954e5d1debabcf190ca78d666878e78b","c9195ac140c820059396476e7a5e5df3fe91aa6a","c78b3e5a110aa60ebfb7aeec53a3b0658792cd1d","07d4e45b7d80f5c356823eb4d94dd475aa5c8c72","535a40df8b2d765874db9dff4b6e6beafa7dd989","43132ebfc167a795349c1ce4e612b9a04d8a9544","d349c694ccd2506f21c511be92e60bb7502a2c7c","1a7cab72d406d2d00b687df8f83adc0b43ec3183","e305baa0277738a0ea353786f1e8c15bb79c3942","c838a5c4bbabd2d79e2b28b2cea8d768ba9e8037","29ca8fddb05b8deb23799c8efe6c10aebff8e585","9776fc9ffbe325d0d35f01aa3e8e9b7f0e3b42ce","51ba9600d8db9c118d87b37fb29efda11ae7d9d3","a80eb9b813bc80fab1c44b23f0019ba2b8f67a9f","357c0bb285d5b588e114372691431b15f1fa521b","574ae7e8bacac280916212db01d52154dec0fc9f","74c998569afb3d32279a33a7b1f5e1fed2825dcd","3cae44554a078d1631eaeb1daf9436c95bce64f0","8da1d3298d07f345a51af7c30858413969b8a963","ba2358653ee864b73bc8efc25bd5f03bd53d22af","45585814ba1fe23a2d53ff51e4eb4ef283b43cf6","1aae87c5d44cdb6f8ba34164080f39a457eee789","a2c1f551bd1bdff37170614ce9d83869d75d5f45","095fa4f3ef38014c956739e17471fe7ba0d21c14","d37e857105bb660094be852e4ecae94d2fb128c6","4cf8ae2d9b7f1be9a23c19f23c6301c9bcebdbc2"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"The Impact of Health Insurance on Cancer Care in Disadvantaged Communities","doi":"10.1002/cncr.30431","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1002/cncr.30431","venue":"Cancer"}

A qualitative study was carried out using focus group discussions. Five sessions were held among 42 participants (30 mothers and 12 caregivers). Results indicated that 80% of participants used CP to bring up their children; 70 % did not know the meaning, predisposing factors, and manifestations of child abuse, and more than 50 % did not know the complications resulting from CP and the ways of preventing. Their attitude toward CP was that the use of CP was sometimes necessary to bring up their children while their information about predisposing factors and complications of child abuse might be minimal. The findings have been used in providing an educational package with the topics of parenting skills in order to decrease child abuse that has been resulted by parents.","inCitations":["fa51485f69ed77bbf65f096fc633cf4bc6ad8504","3460ee760791138055d38afa73b17104c469754e","6d9b4bd3594f8d1983923d55c9bb466824c3e1b2","9c3dfb354cd847ffa32e07658a9cd5bb061e63d1","a408431f0f9de901b9a3dda3124db6c79d016793","46d316fe53f349f227ec9387689fd9f09204b005","db6f6b8673883dbb6d9ce9cfc451b1f86f0a9801","450a53ee8ea49048693c72fbc9dd809ffc2a683d","86a91ee9d680276336fc97d07ff3e2d6923c9056","7d113b9edbe16ef9219e614452e351935e078852"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Mothers’ Attitudes Toward Corporal Punishment of Children in Qazvin-Iran","doi":"10.1007/s10896-009-9279-7","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10896-009-9279-7","venue":"Journal of Family Violence"}

Our patient population differed significantly from those of previous studies as no patients received antimicrobial or CSF prophylaxis before randomization and all were solid tumor patients. When the diagnosis of FN was established, patients were started on intravenous meropenem 1 g every 8 hours and randomly assigned to receive G-CSF (5 microg/kg body weight per day subcutaneously) or not. Twenty-eight patients with 30 FN episodes received G-CSF and 25 patients with 30 FN episodes did not receive G-CSF according to randomization. The time to resolution of fever, recovery of neutrophil count over 1000/mm3, duration of hospitalization, need for erythrocyte and platelet transfusion and mortality rate were similar in both study groups. Side effects of therapy were mild. These results provide preliminary evidence that G-CSF administration, in addition to effective antibiotic therapy as treatment of febrile neutropenic patients with solid tumor, does not help improve infection-related morbidity and mortality.","inCitations":["a1f47d75f23fe6c8a13d4e9909918a597124c459","58fe48b1a858db7bc50be5c6f07b90c2c654c96c","c139fba08b80f765c19c9f385c27264abdd025eb"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Meropenem +/- granulocyte colony stimulating factor in the treatment of febrile neutropenic patients with cancer: prospective randomized study.","doi":"10.1179/joc.2004.16.3.288","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1179/joc.2004.16.3.288","venue":"Journal of chemotherapy"}

The resulting thiol-penicillin-binding protein 3 was expressed under the control of the lacUV5 promoter in a high copy number plasmid. Constitutive expression of the thiol-enzyme (but not of the wild-type enzyme) was lethal, and the plasmid could only be maintained in E. coli strains that carried the lacIq mutation. Induction of the expression of the thiol-enzyme resulted in inhibition of cell division and the growth of the bacteria into very long filamentous cells. The inhibition of septation was probably due to interference of the function of the wild-type penicillin-binding protein 3 in cell division by the enzymatically inactive thiol-enzyme, and this implies that penicillin-binding protein 3 acts as part of a complex in vivo. We were unable to detect any acylation of the thiol-enzyme by penicillin, but it is not yet clear if this was because the thioester was not formed at an appreciable rate, or if it was formed but was too unstable to be detected by a modified penicillin-binding protein assay.","inCitations":["b783c5926a91f5e2d960d4697e924050398531a3","95681c957d14a0dc0d04dc2f8a829133c0bbdff8","3c8cdc7b3304ac38cbca297412697178b58b968c","1e1f4fe21cda7a80f1fa29a5e51a41460aa51e57","4aa5571440bf4c835731aef86196b86fb84ef2b0","585cc988b9d15dd5cc239165ee7cd20b8adb59da","4561edcd65cdfe8a8446eefb26ecc8d4244b564b","25ede12f95e554e6e90d1568b576347c7d6299d3","3cd83f1987f32a0a9d251f99a125326e1241143d","0726ad91d61a05947685e8b7e0733f95e88d40e2"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Production of thiol-penicillin-binding protein 3 of Escherichia coli using a two primer method of site-directed mutagenesis.","doi":"10.1002/j.1460-2075.1985.tb02340.x","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1002/j.1460-2075.1985.tb02340.x","venue":"The EMBO journal"}

CHDF is capable of eliminating small molecules from blood, but whether trypsin can be eliminated by CHDF is not clear. In this study, elimination of trypsin-like enzyme activity (TLE) and cationic trypsin-like immunoreactivity (TLI) using low-volume CHDF was examined at the first CHDF session in eight patients with severe acute pancreatitis. CHDF was performed with a polysulfone hemofilter (membrane area, 0.7 m2) and nafamostat mesilate, a protease inhibitor and anticoagulant, at a blood flow rate of 100 ml/min and a filtration and dialysis flow rate of 10 ml/min each. Before beginning CHDF, plasma TLE was 3.41 +/- 2.86 nmol/(ml.min), and TLI was 5,900 +/- 9,008 ng/ml. The average plasma clearances of TLE and TLI achieved by the circuit during the 12-hour therapy were 56.7 +/- 4.9 ml/min and 8.0 +/- 7.2 ml/min, respectively. The average plasma clearance of TLI into the waste fluid was 2.4 +/- 1.6 ml/min whereas TLE was below the measurable sensitivity. The plasma concentration of TLE and TLI remained unchanged. These results indicate that low-volume CHDF using nafamostat mesilate as an anticoagulant can increase trypsin plasma clearance. However, low-volume CHDF is not effective to eliminate the plasma trypsin concentration.","inCitations":["aec95f77c2a671e0555a62db80c74fbb9314d95b","70c0e03fee3ca912decd970083b29a34c6b193d8","c251dc895c8b5a5a9a146862bc84eb4ebfba5216"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Low-volume continuous hemodiafiltration with nafamostat mesilate increases trypsin clearance without decreasing plasma trypsin concentration in severe acute pancreatitis.","doi":"10.1097/MAT.0b013e3180310473","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1097/MAT.0b013e3180310473","venue":"ASAIO journal"}
