Unser Beitrag untersucht anhand unterschiedlichen Materials diesen Zusammenhang von Wohlfahrt und Religion. Vergleichend nehmen wir dafür zwei Länder in den Fokus, in denen Armut historisch gesehen einen unterschiedlichen Stellenwert hatte und Armenfürsorge mithilfe religiöser Semantiken verschieden begründet wurde: Großbritannien und Irland. Anhand eines dreistufigen, qualitativ angelegten Vergleichs zeigen wir, dass a) die jeweiligen nationalen Wohlfahrtstraditionen und -regime einen Kontext darstellen, innerhalb dessen b) religiöse Dachorganisationen Prinzipien für Essensspenden formulieren, die wiederum c) in lokal organisierten Foodbanks von MitarbeiterInnen, Freiwilligen und NutzerInnen angeeignet, umgedeutet und um eigene Vorstellungen erweitert werden. So tragen wir zum breiteren Diskurs um die semantischen Hintergründe verschiedener Wohlfahrtsregime bei und zeigen zudem, dass und wie religiöse Vorstellungen auf den unterschiedlichen Ebenen organisierte Fürsorge anleiten.AbstractPoor relief dates far back in history where it was organised und supported by religious institutions and notions. Consulting various data, our paper examines this nexus of welfare and religion. Therefore, we compare two countries where poverty was historically of differing importance and poor relief grounded in different religious ideas: Great Britain and the Republic of Ireland. Drawing a three-stage comparison that follows a qualitative design, we show that a) each national welfare tradition and –regime constitutes a larger context in which b) religious umbrella organisations formulate their principles for food provision which again c) are appropriated, reinterpreted and complemented by staff, volunteers and users in local foodbanks. Our analyses contribute to a larger discourse about semantic backdrops of different welfare regimes and demonstrate that and how religious ideas guide notions of organised welfare on various levels.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Religion im Wohlfahrtsstaat: Konzeptionen und Begründungen von Lebensmittelhilfe für Bedürftige in Großbritannien und Irland","doi":"10.1007/s41682-018-0014-1","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s41682-018-0014-1","venue":""}

This study compares the performance of polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells with different preparation methods for the membrane and composite of PWA-silica-SO3H particles. The optimum composition of PWA-silica-SO3H is determined on the basis of the mechanical properties, the behavior of water in the membrane, and the level of proton conductivity. The mechanical properties of the sol-gel composite membranes were improved with the introduction of PWA-silica-SO3H particles. The sol-gel composite membrane has higher levels of proton conductivity than the in situ composite membrane and pure SPAES membrane. An increase in the silica content of the PWA-silica sol-gel particles increases the proton conductivity because the inorganic component and the incorporation of PWA lead to a high concentration of hydroxyl groups. These properties make composite membranes potential candidates for direct methanol fuel cell applications.\n","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Properties of SPAES/phosphotungsticacid/sulfonated silica composite membranes prepared by the In situ and sol-gel process","doi":"10.1007/s13233-012-0159-2","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s13233-012-0159-2","venue":"Macromolecular Research"}

Our results demonstrate a limited number of large sites and numerous smaller sites of FGFR1 in the nuclear interior. The larger sites showed virtually complete colocalization (>90%) with splicing factor rich nuclear speckles while the smaller sites showed very limited overlap (<20%). Similar results were found for several other proliferating cell lines grown in culture. An in situ transcription assay was used to determine colocalization with transcription sites by incorporating 5-bromouridine triphosphate (BrUTP) followed by dual staining for BrUTP and FGFR1. These results combined with those from using an antibody against the large subunit of RNA polymerase II suggest a significant degree of colocalization (26-38%) over both the large and small sites. No colocalization was detected with sites of DNA replication. The spatial arrangements of FGFR1 sites and colocalization with nuclear speckles were maintained following extraction for nuclear matrix. Moreover, immunoblots indicated a significant enrichment of FGFR1 in the nuclear matrix fraction. Our findings suggest an involvement of a nuclear matrix bound FGFR1 in transcriptional and RNA processing events in the cell nucleus. We further propose that nuclear speckles, aside from a role in transcriptional/RNA processing events, may serve as fundamental regulatory factories for the integration of diverse signaling and regulatory factors that impact transcription and cellular regulation.","inCitations":["e208d0bec49e069ea270bb33eb049634f8b01623","4da0a01066cecb9945761c74906290c9ffc013f2","c6adb73b59ccc0851c59ae408d36c230b71d7ef5","c5134b30b493539c18e9384b7e056ebda207040b","7eb48d9481e218abe35d5bc20b5802578babc057","2f23ccded2f845e1e1d30ca472c0837a87d94688","a56f91bbb498d2b4edadaba79f51387bdead3c2f","1b97d03dee4b187d6a264b42ad9ce0f7598ca6f5","f04ea681eb7ff45fd32a8474fb8dae6eeb594865","acc064036fb055bf3d426df5b704efb1e2ed3c47","2d1151beae8b68c56e4debef6b599b54229662c7","277aa7edb7aaa208bfd7771646deb2c9c7bf170a","8b7ba61980799a6b30baaf13e9f13e58b0cfc17b"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Nuclear matrix bound fibroblast growth factor receptor is associated with splicing factor rich and transcriptionally active nuclear speckles.","doi":"10.1002/jcb.10672","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1002/jcb.10672","venue":"Journal of cellular biochemistry"}

Over the past two decades a rising prevalence of cannabis use in the Australian population has led to proposals for the decriminalization of the personal use of cannabis. Three states and territories have removed criminal penalties for personal use while criminal penalties are rarely imposed in the remaining states. Libertarian arguments for legalization of cannabis use have attracted a great deal of media interest but very little public and political support. Other arguments in favour of decriminalization have attracted more support. One has been the utilitarian argument that prohibition has failed to deter cannabis use and the social costs of its continuation outweigh any benefits that it produces. Another has been the argument from hypocrisy that cannabis is less harmful than alcohol and so, on the grounds of consistency, if alcohol is legally available then so should cannabis. To date public opinion has not favoured legalization, although support for the decriminalization of personal cannabis use has increased. In the long term, the outcome of the debate may depend more upon trends in cannabis use and social attitudes among young adults than upon the persuasiveness of the arguments for a relaxation of the prohibition of cannabis.","inCitations":["8158eb3c27d2ca89c703ad1a986da6bd7650e691","3c3f1b299c6c9b62854ca77f4b2d994264669338","c7acf94f0eb94eb9b5d73ed868a59d8867059672","1a0e481f5fd3e5b5d9c628b63c0d0c379cab6c9d","2576c26cc62c5e7205c902216545e72886c75228","03aafe0041dfa4297b0054e22127b8fa4e6b4186","5dbfcb1aa286f4cd4aff7bf305a6a2ff04eafd9e","80a1757dee9b0dc09e6165db97fc0861e25e4b41","6cdd8fd886e6254ae86c083ba00f2c703c53febb"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"The recent Australian debate about the prohibition on cannabis use.","doi":"10.1111/j.1360-0443.1997.tb03668.x","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1360-0443.1997.tb03668.x","venue":"Addiction"}

Bain & Edg., the causal agent of zonate leaf spot of Sorghum spp., is adaptively tolerant of hydrogen cyanide. Associated with adaptation to hydrogen cyanide is the appearance of formamide hydro-lyase. The enzyme is induced by hydrogen cyanide and converts hydrogen cyanide to formamide, a compound which is relatively non-toxic, Formamide hydro-lyase from G. sorghi has characteristics of a high molecular weight enzyme, is stable to storage at 4 °C, has optimal activity in the range of pH 7 to 9, and has a k m of approximately 30 m m -hydrogen cyanide. Sorghum tissue infected with G. sorghi has formamide hydro-lyase activity whereas healthy sorghum does not. Formamide hydro-lyase from infected tissue had properties similar to that produced by G. sorghi in vitro .","inCitations":["8565ebcde4c5a7483adff97efb2552459c935eec","fbf04342552bbe75f2039d58894832946658a9cc","6250d0012e7b2506a415d8eb2b6ed8589a031092","a58a739e9c4f70684ece7bdb35aa250156e201dc","e72aa94ad5d522406c25a645f03016029efd02e2","a0ad6faa8187504b99f002c51ff556315b397956","3ed04348b12ea35f094a6d7f43760dd326072a9b","5311da1c0f9e7fec0834c8843a44a79447f86ac9","f0a9136eb32b8d939a70241497de8b15dbc0781f","ed0f7c14793a0387c028292ce98fecb89cf899a3","f9feb08a2bbeb0fd99891a311dd702238818217c","2cc3e79cf606892e90a19ba4c5f14852a4a5723e","8b7a4697129c912252e80a45ae381f2d1386e1cb"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Hydrogen cyanide detoxification by Gloeocercospora sorghi","doi":"10.1016/0048-4059(75)90056-9","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/0048-4059%2875%2990056-9","venue":""}

In this work, a simple method is reported for obtaining ultralow-density transparent porous beads with a diameter of several millimeters. In the method, a boehmite nanofiber dispersion (BNF sol) is dripped directly into liquid nitrogen and the beads are vacuum-dried. Normally, porous materials obtained via freeze drying exhibit strong light scattering due to structural nonuniformity and are not transparent. However, using dilute BNF as a skeleton structure suppressed the inhomogeneity due to aggregation during the dispersion medium crystallization. The lowest bulk density of the cryogel was 1.1 mg cm−3, and the visible light transmittance reached 90 %. By dispersing functional materials into the BNF sol before freezing, composite materials were obtained. The facile method can be expected to develop the field of functional porous materials.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Facile Fabrication of Ultralow‐Density Transparent Boehmite Nanofiber Cryogel Beads and Their Application to a Nanoglue","doi":"10.1002/cnma.201600360","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1002/cnma.201600360","venue":""}

All these insects and acarids were reported in some or all of the following states viz. Khartoum, Gezira, River Nile, Northern, White Nile, Kassala, Gadarif, Red Sea, Blue Nile, North Kordofan and South Darfur. The biology of these insects was studied in Sudan such as the life history of T. castaneum, T. granarium and E. cautella. However, the susceptibility studies of some Sudanese wheat cultivars revealed that Dibera variety is more resistant to T. granarium, T. castaneum, R. dominica and S. oryzae than Nilein variety. Another study followed reported Dibera as the most susceptible to T. granarium descended by Nilein then Vee/ PJN112 whereas condor was not attacked and found free from damage. The host range of these insects is rather broad i.e. almost all the mentioned pests of wheat grain attack sorghum grain and some of them attack other members of the family graminae (e.g. rice, millet, maize, etc...), leguminous crops (e. g. soybean, fababean, groundnuts, lentil, etc...), they also attack sesame, tamarind, sunflower, water melon seeds and dates. The control of these store product insects (SPI) includes a variety of methods that include proper harvest time and selection of high quality tolerant varieties as prerequisites for a hygienic wheat produce. However, some preventive measures of control include using hygienic stores, good inspection of the sacks before being stored and fumigation by methyl bromide and phosphine. However, the fumigation can be a curative treatment but should not be more than twice, to avoid residues beyond the tolerance level, and a third fumigation should be undertaken when absolutely necessary. The neem derivatives were found very potent in controlling SPI and this beside the advantage of being organic. Some studies determined the susceptibility of some SPI to other botanical insecticides that include cucurbit extracts to T. castaneum, garlic oil on T. castaneum and R. dominica. Other studies include the susceptibility of fenitrothion, primiphos – methyl, chlorpyrifos – methyl, deltamethrin and malathion on T. castaneum and R. dominica. However, the loss assessment due to infestation of wheat grains is a function of storage time and any infestation reduces the market value markedly. This review of the works on SPI of wheat in Sudan stimulates further studies on sound control methods (including IPM strategies), study of the biology of unstudied species and the susceptibility of the wheat varieties to SPI should be included as a prerequisite before passing them. Frequent questionnaires should be designed to pinpoint the deficiencies in the control program(s). However, the role of the government should be activated in private stores, silos and grain markets","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://blue-ap.org/j/List/1/iss/volume%202%20(2014)/issue%2007/5.pdf"],"title":"Store Insect Pests and Mites of Wheat in Sudan, a Prespective Review","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Information was obtained from medical records and was transferred to a survey questionnaire to present personal, fracture, treatment and complication variables.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe study population consisted of 96 patients. Their mean age was 6.8 years. The cases were predominantly among males, comprising closed fractures on the right side, in the middle third with a single line. Regarding fracture etiology, traffic accidents predominated overall in the sample. Most of the patients (74 to 77.1%) presented femoral fractures as their only injury. Conservative treatment predominated in the group younger than six years of age, and surgical treatment in the group aged 6 to 14 years and 11 months. The complications observed until bone union were: discrepancy, infection and movement limitation. The mean time taken for consolidation was 9.6 ± 2.4 weeks, varying with age.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe features of these fractures were similar to those described in the literature and the treatment used showed good results. The Joana de Gusmão Children's Hospital has used the treatment proposed in the literature for pediatric femoral shaft fractures.","inCitations":["fb7c8f9373ef4b9a8e670f65b5012c1a344a6dcf","c084dd65a6c1fe30c16b68fd0dceaf41aadff70a","d340388704c1ff39d86b6b845e1019a8389d6c32"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.rbo.org.br/exportar-pdf/1431?nome=47_2_ing/original_article_46_50.pdf","https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/pmc/oa_pdf/17/12/main.PMC4799381.pdf","http://www.scielo.br/pdf/rbort/v47n2/en_v47n2a07.pdf"],"title":"Epidemiological Study of Children Diaphyseal Femoral Fractures","doi":"10.1016/S2255-4971(15)30084-7","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/S2255-4971%2815%2930084-7","venue":"Revista brasileira de ortopedia"}

The species, Japetella diaphana, Abralia redfieldi, Histioteuthis corona, Leachia atlantica, and Onychoteuthis banksii were collected in three geographic areas in the GoM (east, south and southeast of the Macondo wellhead). Results indicate a shift in the composition of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in the tissue of all cephalopods after 2010, with a more petrogenic source in 2011 that weathered and mixed with other sources in 2015–2016. Overall, PAH concentrations, as well as lipid content, were lower in 2011 relative to 2010 and 2015–2016, suggesting secondary effects to oil-residues exposure from the DWHOS. Collectively, PAHs in the tissues of deep-sea cephalopods indicate an episodic exposure to petrogenic PAHs that occurred between 2010 (pre-spill) and 2011, and continued through 2015–2016.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Temporal Variability of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons in Deep-Sea Cephalopods of the Northern Gulf of Mexico","doi":"10.3389/fmars.2020.00054","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2020.00054","venue":"Frontiers in Marine Science"}

Although the causative factors underlying the development of cerebral vasospasm are poorly understood, oxidative stress contributes to disease progression. In the present study, curcumin (150 or 300 mg/kg) protected against the development of cerebral vasospasm and limited secondary cerebral infarction after SAH in mice. The protective effect of curcumin was associated with a significant attenuation of inflammatory gene expression and lipid peroxidation within the cerebral cortex and the middle cerebral artery. Despite the ability of curcumin to limit the development of cerebral vasospasm and secondary infarction, behavioral outcome was not improved, indicating a dissociation between cerebral vasospasm and neurologic outcome. Together, these data indicate a novel role for curcumin as a possible adjunct therapy after SAH, both to prevent the development of cerebral vasospasm and to reduce oxidative brain injury after secondary infarction.","inCitations":["ad22dd40725365a336eaa6042dee9385edf8a86f","de6d4a6497b2f4d58836f3847d516d00ff01624b","39dc2b714b32fcf25a08417223354fd727ae72af","9e2c80b0515b28916fbe21135a34e96ff6d95572","46b7be9b6a576d117b0b5362cfa346dc71afcb83","d529d44e419e12913425cc4d03ffeeb054387371","826f354bc49a4286789a9b3d3b4be533c96c3a6a","f80072991e5e5d345638be1077b5970e82789f02","dc4a3ef444228b7217dca42c6a975f1763f3c406","9aa79b0c2601195a3727a1f04783c0863ba9195f","14e2af5fb00cf27b5f89f53272841b73ea123e11","c634f04b934b9c687b3bbc476c7c798b0cf2d71c","001996299a9308856b898fa38457e25758f56deb","a97b41b9363ccdd9d32a19a0bc66906a40fe8804","f38180d686ea9868eecd5b8ad7f67885a367b033","8445f36242df146f374eef5f57eed8b947f7d06d","93f362432ece5683cef9d24f297eee9797a2a50a","6bf7a5f1b762e0aa80b6aa3bc85f14f0d9077814","b7fbe43e4bae5dd530dcc7a4970c4499ad0900ce","3ebc5fe747a580f474287bc749a05ccb754ccb9d","c5f30a1fbfe0eb5785aba05ad4149fba68a3674d","874ceff071d51abc425af51ac2e50d0807e0e9d1","0bca3360f2a8929b8cad5eaef0d0f3318287b63a","56e2a64fdef55a18b963555f685fd62a0337f7a7","0ee55b517b53ee645e66c693c34a885213f26321","2bdd4e5f87e7f62f5560abdc9a4f3c8ec869c760","fa731a3ce75c416bedd3356766171e7b600cd048","f24970b44ac01bbf43e5823733e6e8bbef362a69","2ffabafd4b6a00f94a45bbd473bb6eb0d1e46d9c","403798b113fb20f5924c96b8b818cc9ea4a25b9b","97d79123dce265f637a4cb447e29c68b5000ddb9","a55391c7ede91020e52e4dd4f67211a48279484e","f6913dbeb0ab1a07ea7345cfcab64b1228e77f39"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Curcumin attenuates vascular inflammation and cerebral vasospasm after subarachnoid hemorrhage in mice.","doi":"10.1089/ars.2008.2056","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1089/ars.2008.2056","venue":"Antioxidants & redox signaling"}

Conventional methods use Conditional Random Field (CRF) that recognizes the class of each region using the features extracted from the local regions and the class co-occurrence between the adjoining regions. However, there is a problem that CRF tends to fall into the local optimal recognition result because it uses only local features and the relation. To solve this problem, we propose a method that recognizes generic objects by incorporating Bag of Features (BoF) as the global feature into CRF. As a result of the experiment to the image dataset of 21 classes, the proposal method has improved the recognition rate by 6.5%.","inCitations":["ed7627a6680a6dc3a0eac9ed8f0e3070dd6c94b7","103c1571ee93c10e6c7d2cb29a94d3c1aceb027e","654258e32afe9bba3ec0a4ccbb60e0e942709356","03ad74fcb9031836fa8f68c61b297103530a5565","a57907e6ca95f18668b3fa83360c89d7e438e138"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.me.cs.scitec.kobe-u.ac.jp/publications/papers/2009/MITA2009_okumura.pdf","http://www.me.cs.scitec.kobe-u.ac.jp/publications/papers/2009/OS4-2.pdf","http://www.me.cs.scitec.kobe-u.ac.jp/~takigu/pdf/2009/MITA2009_okumura.pdf"],"title":"Generic Object Recognition using CRF by Incorporating BoF as Global Features","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

One eye of each patient was treated with interface flushing after dry extraction of the lenticule. Flushing was performed with 1.0 cc balanced salt solution using a single-use 27-gauge cannula. The uncorrected distance visual acuity (UDVA) at 1 day, 1 week, and 3 months; the CDVA at 3 months; and postoperative differences at the slitlamp examination were recorded. Statistical analyses were performed with logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution values using paired t tests.

One day postoperatively, the mean UDVA was 0.81 in the non-flush group and 0.83 in the flush group (P = .110).

Presently, little is known regarding these injuries or the long-term outcomes of their repair.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe performed a retrospective review of patients undergoing colorectal surgery between 2003 and 2013 who experienced iatrogenic GU injuries requiring surgical repair. GU repair failures were defined as development of urine leak, urinary fistula, or anastomotic stricture requiring secondary GU intervention. Possible risk factors associated with repair failures were examined and included age, American Society of Anesthesiology score, comorbidities, type of colorectal surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOf 42,570 colorectal surgeries performed, 75 GU injuries were identified (0.18%). Mean age was 57.5 years (range, 22-91), and median follow-up was 19.5 months (range, 1-128). Fifty-nine (59/75, 79%) patients required a single GU repair whereas 16 of 75 (21%) patients experienced repair failure requiring additional GU intervention. The most common GU injuries were cystotomy (26/75, 35%), incomplete ureteral transection (22/75, 29%), complete proximal and distal ureteral injuries (13/75, 17%; 11/75, 15%), urethral injury (2/75, 3%), and injury to a pre-existing ileal conduit (1/75, 1). Twenty-seven patients (36%) had prior radiation and 35 patients (47%) had prior chemotherapy. Preoperative radiation and chemotherapy were both associated with failure of the GU repair (P = .003; P = .013). Delayed repair of the GU injury was also associated with repair failure (P = .001).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nIatrogenic GU injuries during colorectal surgery are rare, affecting only 0.18% of colorectal procedures. Preoperative external beam radiation therapy/chemotherapy and delayed GU repair are associated with worse outcomes of repairs of these injuries.","inCitations":["58641d7688e02e54737e2ec0ac67379657191a8a","f8edfe9495f895d18cae6842b46dcb1bb35ccb76","7af2e92bbc5c71cf6f8e4187712d3aaa32021edd","a72d20dd4c7c96c8d2b82991d917072ce56cf630","c2e2e78091066d2b6c6b160e6bd1aef4956a957e","22e721a8ef606847f29b73afbc8c1b2acf5afad6","78c8dffbd4a0af3e7a1012fd4e0c1b82553cb8cf","d0169fe28e457d0dc98b193fe73e841c07b9b8d4","aea869b6180b84abc1e24f4e313dc7583953c7d5","4109d5f4ecf1023e553e8c92cc13253f6fda6b5d"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Outcomes of Iatrogenic Genitourinary Injuries During Colorectal Surgery.","doi":"10.1016/j.urology.2015.06.065","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.urology.2015.06.065","venue":"Urology"}

Peneliti telah memilih kelas A sebagai kelompok eksperimen/coba dan kelas B sebagai kelompok pengendali/kontrol yang sejajar dalam prestasi. Analisis data menggunakan compare means paired sample t-test dan independent sample t-test dengan variabel kontrol kondisi psikologis mahasiswa. \nHasil penelitian diperoleh: (1) Hasil uji paired sample t-test diperoleh nilai t hitung sebesar -18.499 signifikansi dua arah pada 0,000. Hal tersebut menunjukkan ada perbedaan yang signifikan antara nilai pre-test dengan nilai post-test mahasiswa kelas A (kelas eksperimen); (2) Penggunaan pembelajaran dengan media visual lebih efektif dibandingkan dengan metode ceramah tanpa media visual dalam meningkatkan prestasi belajar mahasiswa pada mata kuliah kewirausahaan di jurusan Pendidikan Ekonomi FE UNY. Dari hasil uji independent t-test ditunjukkan oleh nilai t hitung sebesar 4,104 > t tabel sebesar 2,660 dan signifikansi sebesar 0,000, sehigga dapat disimpulkan terdapat perbedaan yang signifikan antara nilai post-test mahasiswa kelas eksperimen (Kelas A) dengan nilai post-test mahasiswa kelas pengendali (Kelas B); (3) Kondisi psikologis mahasiswa yang bertipe visual, kemampuan pemahaman materi kewirausahaan akan lebih baik jika proses pembelajarannya menggunakan media visual. Hasil uji independent t-test kelas A (kelas eksperimen) diperoleh nilai post-test rata-rata dari kelompok audio/konvensional sebesar 7,500 dan nilai post-test rata-rata dari kelompok visual sebesar 8,474. Hasil pengujian diperoleh t hitung sebesar | -3,166| > t tabel sebesar 2,032; maka dapat disimpulkan bahwa terdapat perbedaan yang signifikan antara nilai post-test mahasiswa kelompok audio/konvensional dengan nilai post-test mahasiswa kelompok visual; (4) Kondisi psikologis mahasiswa yang bertipe audio/konvensional, kemampuan pemahaman materi kewirausahaan akan lebih baik jika proses pembelajarannya menggunakan audio/konvensional. Hasil uji independent t-test kelas B (kelas pengendali) diperoleh nilai post-test rata-rata dari kelompok audio/konvensional sebesar 7,412 dan nilai post-test rata-rata dari kelompok visual sebesar 6,444.

The SDS is an instrument which measures the solar diameter at different orientations with respect to the solar polar axis. Fitting straight lines through two fixed-angle data sets with time as the independent variable yields slopes of (7.1 +/ - 1.5) x 10 exp -3 and (6.7 +/- 1.6) x 10 exp -3/mas s, consistent with the value of 6.47 x 10 exp -3/mas s expected from the earth's approach to the sun due to the orbital motion toward perihelion. Upon the instrument's rotation on its axis a sinusoidal component of the diameter measurement was observed in each rotation cycle, with a variable amplitude of about 150 mas. The present result is epsilon of (5.6 +/- 6.3) x 10 exp -6, about 30 deg offset from the polar-equator position. The absolute diameter obtained by means of the FFT definition is found to be 1919.269 +/- 0.240 arcsec or 1919.131 +/- 0.240 arcsec, depending on the orientation mode of the measurement.","inCitations":["4f05b3c79f38129e76ef28310bd20c6bc64c1eb2","ccf0c377fc853e11144dca1522ec25b8b7735491","5f7c3c9fca72b46de95fc2fa57b2c8aed9bfe7ad","51ee30c9bf0f7dd97978ac13606cc702ab05d21d"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Preliminary results of a balloon flight of the solar disk sextant","doi":"10.1086/171221","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1086/171221","venue":""}

The hypothermic effects of monohalogenated derivatives of CBN were comparable to that of CBN, whereas the effects of dihalogenated derivatives of CBN except for the fluorinated derivative were attenuated. In the interaction with pentobarbital, two monochlorinated derivatives exhibited a significant prolongation of sleeping time, although other derivatives did not significantly affect the sleeping time. The cataleptogenic effects of monofluoro- and 4-bromo-CBN were stronger than that of CBN. 4-Bromo-CBN exhibited a significant prolongation of seizure latency induced by pentylenetetrazol. These data suggest that halogenation of CBN modifies the pharmacological profile of the cannabinoid.","inCitations":["63ee1f2a9a8fed7c557634d5d4ceb89d31b04c99","e65644f7aa1bf18830327c6aa6afe1c954d406d3","56af41303c92e97fc5fd0a224162cfd34f76c62d"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Synthesis and pharmacological effects in mice of halogenated cannabinol derivatives.","doi":"10.1248/cpb.43.335","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1248/cpb.43.335","venue":"Chemical & pharmaceutical bulletin"}

The diet of G. humeralis consisted primarily of invertebrates, and differed significantly between sexes in the rainy season, when there was also a significant intersexual difference in perch use (males perched higher). Reproductive activity was also more intense during the rainy season. Intersexual diet divergence may be a result of differential perch use, which appears related to intense reproductive activity in the rainy season. By using higher perches, males should increase their chance to find mates as suggested in other lizard species.","inCitations":["a413025fae88f44d4fb5c727b280b768a3519164","daf20c85cca2ac45c86f2eb7f6b6f1759720fd8b","5af3ee1eb977cd177898ec37455e4847f04603c7","622656fc94ab590e0f0075dab1885dee75476fb2","36721757c20f56e2d7f6c14500573fb2d459834c","4eb2408e897dd8d1950813ed61817920e5f8101c","edd2565e29de40e3d334e29f6fd7cbe0d337c5a6","c1ba505014876b1a4bda38b97ff5401ce969b48b","7dd1a14a5acde9271564f1b5fbfeec02e415a7af","0692d17fae3ab023888c6ac29e03440497279d66","6610718acfc6b0c19c6581e49e53ec12b8cc52c5","59e29418f55bc905aaec05537d2746b411bf155e","0b59d855482a1130755004491918c3eacc1c10c6","4e107941d0348e9accc9370cffacff8fecdffe8b"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Seasonality in Diet, Perch Use, and Reproduction of the Gecko Gonatodes humeralis from Eastern Brazilian Amazon","doi":"10.1670/0022-1511(2003)037[0433:SIDPUA]2.0.CO;2","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1670/0022-1511%282003%29037%5B0433%3ASIDPUA%5D2.0.CO%3B2","venue":""}

Each user is assumed to be requesting a variable bit rate (VBR) MPEG2 encoded media stream. The scheduling scheme maximizes the number of streams that can be served concurrently. The quality of service is guaranteed in terms of the fraction of the frames that may be dropped for a user. When a new request arrives, the admission control algorithm estimates the fraction of frames that may have to be dropped for the users assuming that the new request is accepted. If the fraction of frames is more than the drop rate committed to the users, the request is rejected, otherwise it is accepted. Our scheme is much more simpler than the schemes suggested in the literature and results in better utilization of the resources, and at the same time provides guaranteed QoS to the users requesting predictive service. Extensive simulations have been conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of this scheduling scheme.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"A novel scheduling scheme for serving VBR-encoded multimedia streams","doi":"10.1109/CCECE.1998.682776","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCECE.1998.682776","venue":"Conference Proceedings.

While some areas of the lower canopy are more heavily colonised than others, the aphids are equally likely to be found at any height. Aggregation does not appear to involve gregariousness between aphids, but is influenced by nymphal “inertia”. The smallest instars tend to feed next to the bud at the shoot tip, in contrast to the apterae which feed mostly on second year twigs. The restricted distribution of the small instars cannot be explained by an inability to reach the phloem vessels in certain parts of the twigs. Nevertheless, the pattern of distribution amongst the shoots is strongly associated with variations in phloem depth between shoots, the aphids tending to be more abundant in regions where the shoots are thinner and the phloem is nearer the surface. \n \n \n \nZusammenfassung \n \nVerbreitung der Grosen Kiefernblattlaus Cinara pinea (Mordv.) im Kronenbereich von Pinus sylvestris L. \n \n \n \nIn den Kiefernkronen versammeln sich C. pinea nur an Zweigen mit Nadeln aus diesem und dem vorigen Jahr.

Die begrenzte Verbreitung der Junglarven ist nicht mit einer Unfahigkeit, das Phloem in verschiedenen Tiefen zu erreichen, zu erklaren. Doch ist das Verbreitungsmuster an den Trieben korreliert mit der Variation der Phloemtiefe, wobei die Blattlause dazu neigten, sich in solchen Regionen anzusammeln, wo die Triebe dunn sind und damit das Phloem oberflachlich liegt.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"The distribution of the large pine aphid, Cinara pinea (Mordv.) within the canopy of Scots pine, Pinus sylvestris L.","doi":"10.1111/j.1439-0418.1985.tb01997.x","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0418.1985.tb01997.x","venue":""}

Though often seen to occur together, the bulk electromechanical and electrowetting effects are distinct and can be expected to occur independently under proper conditions. A derivation using the methods of lumped parameter electromechanics demonstrates that the net force on a liquid mass situated between two parallel, coated electrodes can be determined with no reference to the actual shape of the meniscus. By the very nature of its derivation, this electrostatic force cannot be localized as to where it acts on the liquid.

Cabe entao a escola cumprir seu papel de formadora de cidadaos conscientes, contribuir ao desenvolvimento de cidadaos criticos e atuantes no que se refere ao assunto, nao de uma realidade distante, mas de algo real e concreto que ocorre diariamente bem proximo de seus alunos. A educacao para o ambiente deveria incluir como objetivo, ao se estudar a contaminacao de um rio, por exemplo, a tomada de decisoes e opcoes para diminuir essa contaminacao tanto no âmbito pessoal, o que posso e devo fazer enquanto cidadao, como tambem de uma maneira coletiva, estar atento e acompanhar as decisoes das instituicoes responsaveis. A Educacao Ambiental e o principal instrumento que possibilita o resgate ou a elaboracao de valores fundamentais do cidadao, proporcionando uma relacao mais solidaria e cooperativa dos seres humanos entre si e com o ambiente. Em resumo, a principal funcao do trabalho com o tema Meio Ambiente e contribuir para a formacao de cidadaos conscientes, aptos a decidir e a atuar na realidade socioambiental de modo comprometido com a vida, com o bem-estar de cada um e da sociedade local e global. Para isso, e necessario que, mais do que informacoes e conceitos, a escola se proponha a trabalhar com atitudes, com formacao de valores, com o ensino e a aprendizagem de habilidades e procedimentos. Esse e um grande desafio a educacao e mais especialmente aos professores de todas as areas, pois deverao integrar o tema Meio Ambiente com todas as areas trabalhadas.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Como Educar E Se Educar Para Se Ter Um Ambiente Saudável","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

The increasing gap in the water supply-demand in Karachi has meant that communities especially the urban poor have had to rely on alternate suppliers i.e. informal PWV to meet their water needs. It is estimated that 60% of the piped consumers in Karachi also supplement their water needs from PWV due to interrupted official. PWV are often viewed as temporary rent seekers taking advantage of unreliable public services so as to exploit customers with overpriced low quality water supply. Both governments and international agencies often ignore PWV as they reflect a failure on part of the government to supply clean piped water to its citizens. However, PWV role should not be ignored as they fill a critical market gap of ensuring water access to communities that otherwise are underserved. Often operating in competitive environments, PWV buy (and illegally extract) bulk water from local water utilities and supply through tankers, kiosks and carts mostly to urban poor in localities that do not have piped connections. Only recently are these PWV being increasingly recognized as providing complimentary services. They are seen as \"gap fillers\" in countries with high coverage areas and low service quality and are pioneering operations in areas where there is no public service. Global statistics, unfortunately, do not recognize the contributions of PWV towards the targets of Millennium Development Goals (MDG), yet PWV are the difference between water and no water in many urban communities. Using the specific case study of Karachi, Pakistan, this paper explores the wider debate that PWV contribute (at least in spirit if not statistically) towards achieving the MDG.","inCitations":["8e1d67cf408da5a938773f4c8c50979cdf51ae34"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Can Private Water Vendors Help Meet the Millennium Development Goals? - A Study of Karachi City Urban Water Market","doi":"10.2139/ssrn.2401582","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.2401582","venue":""}

The microstructural evolution was studied in as-cast, solutionized and aged conditions. The oxidation studies were carried out at 900 °C in air for various time intervals up to 200 hrs and the type of oxide layer formed have been characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD). The composition and phase analysis in all the three alloys were studied out electron probe micro analysis (EPMA). Finally the strength and oxidation behaviour were correlated with both the composition and microstructure.","inCitations":["423e90cf8dd976e60369a535909b3550a9f2c158","7d1bad4d2f17c842e44422107083bce3aa214805"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"The Effect of Nb addition on microstructure, oxidation behavior and strength of some γ-TiAl alloys","doi":"10.1016/j.matpr.2017.12.141","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.matpr.2017.12.141","venue":""}

in cancer. They are involved in chromatin remodeling, as well as transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation, through a variety of chromatin-based mechanisms and via cross-talk with other RNA species. lncRNAs can function as decoys, scaffolds, and enhancer RNAs. This review summarizes the characteristics of lncRNAs, including their roles, functions, and working mechanisms, describes methods for identifying and annotating lncRNAs, and discusses future opportunities for lncRNA-based therapies using antisense

However, the wear resistance of titanium alloys is not high. For this reason it is important to increase the service life of parts made of various titanium alloys that operate under conditions of abrasion and erosion wear. This paper concerns the possibility of using ion nitriding of (α + β) titanium alloys at low temperatures corresponding to the aging temperature range (500 – 650°C). Regimes for treating titanium alloys that provide strengthened layers of the requisite thickness and quality are suggested in order to increase their abrasion and erosion wear resistance while preserving the mechanical characteristics.","inCitations":["574fa4f4a1b36521a5f659cfa6cbdc09408d5ca2","70fe9a2f143151a3edbc4d230728d6c7fd2baf53","1c53e3bb0823a958a8d2e6df09e4969e1b04cd8b","4b2cbd13cc1bf68ff680b2cd346029fc2cf47bca"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Ion nitriding of aging (α + β) titanium alloys","doi":"10.1007/BF01397023","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/BF01397023","venue":""}

Lower levels of peer acceptance predicted increases in social anxiety. Social anxiety predicted decreases in relationship support for males and increases in peer victimization for females. Collectively our findings suggest that peers seem to play a significant role for adolescent mental health and social anxiety seems to interfere with healthy peer relations. Importantly, developmental pathways for social anxiety seem to differ for adolescent females and males.","inCitations":["4d0a3418bcee240bb35de73d53a02f52b1db5fbf","c9e3cfa7cfc257528f1e13d14b35c18843b714f6","64b76eb1fd604a7c33960ba124be4e6877415373","cc4bbc351c8b3a34d154dca3f27774242f80fe62","b7236cba5ab660fdf4c6cbb3f76b5a873b23826e","aa9a52ef7899f26abeaa882f2f08e01dd8bc437a","070445fc577494d166fe3b9c6b29b07ac696fce9","6dc6e7a6d1c6698ae966e9bc228e8d197be102dd","8a2e52c1fa86e6fa470ae5f59e7b7225a69be02c","504bc5f0b8b2078724cbe8bc2a8977c2b4be6584","f206fcc7be0d2846eb40cffba1857b7b4d48da7a","aabe066168dc353fcc92b4c5a412ca2c442de22f","3741edfc4e6bf61e7f8092dc0206963704139b11","2b5c051a813fa2f077263178dafcce860d5f2281","c4e46d404dedd15314fcce382fc646acd94486a3","d5c1ff0d4b76fecd3e6ba8c2498002d782bd7d1c","946ba16b42c8d0138bbfbbdc6e7dbc58503097f9","c42b9eaa5413fd547baf279d0d27fd63d3670a47","c8de745a4babb5e771a65ba6a6986fe81f640c3c","4561a24ecd6590274084286064599f46a5fc52e6","9e0caa492ffe46c7e099d0d043163da9887fd2ad","640da505e5ce3ad524f2337d6dcd101c51a42de7","96b8b16aea8d7becf868a418d8bea8605f9d48d2","12c5e66ceb0dcfa72ad13cb37ab6b0f087ea51fd","8de57d974ccca24ba2cd25c439c0fc7b4910e9b5","ebed2710ef06526fccd49ec70daefb86603fd0a7","725b4e0b581885fcd74abc6412d0abcd4c698566","7962da0b5a72f2acdeb5f1b1972c1aae3dc95741","9699a819795fd8719e36b0076684dda820e36d37","3d109715472f2641d14b6bbf13e20c437e521572","2eb1fcddd72a488748787d0bb8fc428b16c0aaaf","1887506e3a6a27d7fa25187c12f5198268d1e4c2","caf1d0300c3e6294122d74d5e8951f8b88510053"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Prospective links between social anxiety and adolescent peer relations.","doi":"10.1016/j.adolescence.2012.04.008","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.adolescence.2012.04.008","venue":"Journal of adolescence"}

The evacuations in both situations are compared to explore their differences. Some typical behaviors such as following behavior, helping behavior and finding the dependent during evacuation under limited visibility are observed from the experimental video. The reduced visibility hinders pedestrian movement and prolongs evacuation process. As a result, pedestrians need more time to evacuate from the supermarket under limited visibility. However, a similar point is that pedestrians prefer to select the closest exit and minimize their movement distances in both situations. A multi-grid model considering these typical behaviors is proposed to simulate pedestrian evacuation under both conditions and simulation results agree well with the experiment results. Finally simulations with and without obstacles inside are compared to study the effect of obstacles on evacuation time. The study is helpful to understand pedestrian behavior and develop efficient evacuation strategy to guide pedestrian evacuation under limited visibility.","inCitations":["c2d7693df09578263bcc42111bb7725ca020d93b"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Experimental and modeling study on evacuation under good and limited visibility in a supermarket","doi":"10.1016/j.firesaf.2018.10.003","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.firesaf.2018.10.003","venue":""}

Spatial resolution in PCT can be improved by using finer scintillation crystal array elements. Several groups are developing arrays with <2 mm crystal pixels for ultra-high resolution small animal PET systems. The challenge with finer crystals is extracting sufficient light to maintain a high detection signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), especially if the crystals are kept relatively long for good detection efficiency. Assuming the resulting light signals are sufficiently above noise, the finer crystals may be resolved in a flood histogram. However, the reduced detection SNR means lower count sensitivity since more pulses are now below a given threshold, and a loss in energy resolution, which can result in image contrast degradation. We propose scintillation detector concepts that use new avalanche photodiode (APD) arrays in novel readout configurations that promote very high light collection efficiency. These concepts exploit the high compactness of semiconductor photodetector arrays for tightly packed crystal readout schemes that are unavailable to PMTs. The schemes proposed have the potential to significantly improve detection SNR for ultra-high resolution PET. With a I mm wide LSO crystal coupled to a prototype APD array we obtained 13.7% energy resolution at 511 keV in a nonoptimized measurement. Flood irradiation measurements with a 1 mm thick LSO crystal sheet coupled to the array prototype indicate that /spl les/1 mm intrinsic spatial resolution is available to the design with high spatial linearity out to the crystal edge.","inCitations":["53933faf11b041019f941552247ad306be171fb1","9bb5e5e5ffacc964314f4cfbf46d810fc2091ef8","cf4f05a0047c6ac6def1325f3d3988770335ed85","6b84d9ac548937b2481a2fab242541e3d24871c2"],"pdfUrls":["http://miil.stanford.edu/publications/files/93_PUB.pdf"],"title":"Initial studies of a new detector design for ultra-high resolution positron emission tomography","doi":"10.1109/NSSMIC.2002.1239661","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NSSMIC.2002.1239661","venue":"2002 IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium Conference Record"}

Moreover, there is a correlation between the π plasmon energy and the relative intensity of the π plasmon peak to the elastic peak. Thus, the decrease of the π plasmon energy was explained by a crystallite size effect such as a decrease in π electron density. This REELS technique was applied to estimate the chemical state in carbon films obtained by thermal chemical vapor deposition (CVD).
