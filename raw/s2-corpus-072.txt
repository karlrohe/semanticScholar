These may be a consequence of insecurity of attachment, reduced self-confidence, and peer -relationship conflicts during their developmental stages. Developmental cognitive neuroscience has revealed significant associations between specific brain lesions and particular cognitive dysfunctions. Thus, identifying the biological deficits underlying such cognitive dysfunction may provide new insights into therapeutic prospects for the management of those symptoms in children. Recent advances in noninvasive neuroimaging techniques, and especially functional near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), have contributed significant findings to the field of developmental cognitive neuroscience in pediatrics. We present here a comprehensive review of functional NIRS studies of children who have developed normally and of children with psychosomatic and behavioral disorders.","inCitations":["d2bd6c63672a229c16bf5af094e37b1195556ac0","4d8316a7a9f07bcfffaed9b8e62fab384bccf029","1a2323b6088ad81ef1b029ac6ce305acfb904671","80cc394a980eb9020630ee2d655df29a809a9297","5a5e36c4c969f91f9fe15b6f5876f062571d4465","2b714f605edcf65a021dfdf0af7a6d7bb92d5318","06053b0c1635afb6d3b54c04a459703e50708be2"],"pdfUrls":["ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/pmc/ce/2d/Biopsychosoc_Med_2012_Mar_20_6_7.tar.gz","http://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/pmc/ce/2d/1751-0759-6-7.PMC3337812.pdf","http://bpsmedicine.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/1751-0759-6-7?site=bpsmedicine.biomedcentral.com"],"title":"Functional near-infrared spectroscopy studies in children","doi":"10.1186/1751-0759-6-7","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1751-0759-6-7","venue":"BioPsychoSocial Medicine"}

Automatic speech recognition focuses on interpreting the audio signals, although the video can provide information that is complementary to the audio. Exploiting the visual information, however, has proven challenging. On one hand, researchers have reported that the mapping between phonemes and visemes (visual units) is one-to-many because there are phonemes which are visually similar and indistinguishable between them. On the other hand, it is known that some people are very good lip-readers (e.g: deaf people). We study the limit of visual only speech recognition in controlled conditions. With this goal, we designed a new database in which the speakers are aware of being read and aim to facilitate lip-reading. In the literature, there are discrepancies on whether hearing-impaired people are better lip-readers than normal-hearing people. Then, we analyze if there are differences between the lip-reading abilities of 9 hearing-impaired and 15 normal-hearing people. Finally, human abilities are compared with the performance of a visual automatic speech recognition system. In our tests, hearing-impaired participants outperformed the normal-hearing participants but without reaching statistical significance. Human observers were able to decode 44% of the spoken message. In contrast, the visual only automatic system achieved 20% of word recognition rate. However, if we repeat the comparison in terms of phonemes both obtained very similar recognition rates, just above 50%. This suggests that the gap between human lip-reading and automatic speech-reading might be more related to the use of context than to the ability to interpret mouth appearance.","inCitations":["0f00888455aedcec112ae975b2cc3fff467fa21c","08b75f2df56b0ddf1fa054931d4b20027fe6f791","2757b3e903425091f7e3fa0dc03e5fa632c6bf32","ff0810f0b3ac90a06e36a7a6ffd19b7b42be60a5","8ac69ed7dd2d046c20140a5bbb8cbe41bdff7670"],"pdfUrls":["https://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.08028v1.pdf","http://fsukno.atspace.eu/papers/Fernandez_FG2017.pdf","http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/FG.2017.34","http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.08028","https://repositori.upf.edu/bitstream/handle/10230/32726/Fernandez_CAFGR2017_towa.pdf?isAllowed=y&sequence=1"],"title":"Towards Estimating the Upper Bound of Visual-Speech Recognition: The Visual Lip-Reading Feasibility Database","doi":"10.1109/FG.2017.34","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FG.2017.34","venue":"2017 12th IEEE International Conference on Automatic Face & Gesture Recognition (FG 2017)"}

Some inorganic selenium compounds have also been shown to be mutagenic and pro-oxidant: however, very little is known about their effects on human reproduction. Between 1972 and 1988, a few thousand residents in the municipality of Reggio Emilia, northern Italy, were accidentally exposed to drinking water with unusually high levels of inorganic selenium (selenate), range 7-9 microg/l, through a local public water supply system. We found no deleterious effect on overall body weight and length of newborns and stillborns delivered by 18 women previously exposed to high-selenium tapwater. Rates of spontaneous abortions, however, were increased slightly (RR = 1.73; 95% CI = 0.62-4.80), compared with rates among unexposed women from the same municipality. From 1980 through 1988 the prevalence of congenital malformations at birth among the exposed population was similar to that expected, but estimates were imprecise owing to small numbers. Results do not suggest marked effects on human reproduction from chronic exposure to selenate in drinking water at < 10 microg/l.","inCitations":["b7a794f99113d1dc8b09da248f74ec6c7948a583","0e4d4551c0d730f3afc7eea22a96fb9a780e9b4a","64a9877c81446804287de065e174b1efdd4eb985","7580c0710a8726baf6f061f098c1efe17335dbf7","16cba25f5205e91d6b10da781a9173eb5cd920c9","7c388e0feaa916c72e261274d703f6bbf16f470f","5898313291a4a097ade4247f3af094b4acd05de4","8675001fcb6b557b4be88a169d1f53d423866dc3","2ae3d2cc36d13f82ede4bf1862ca31356d4bab1f","598093e762cee5620da9838663bd530f689d5bd2","aaa8a7174e8cf7aba0a5e1035d2b47c473e03494","a545f98b79038812d7b735a04fed1e618c62561d","c8d5fd8db08ae6ca285431d6fc753528ac74f847","a2d9fecbd551d0ab5cd85eb2431fcf60d944716a","be45ca6c0cbf6471efd757633fb313dc09f578d2"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Reproductive outcomes in a population exposed long-term to inorganic selenium via drinking water.","doi":"10.1016/S0048-9697(99)00419-2","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/S0048-9697%2899%2900419-2","venue":"The Science of the total environment"}

We aim not just to include writings in feminist international relations, but also to feature multi-disciplinary scholarship pertaining to global gender relations. The section is usually made up of a combination of several distinct elements: Rethinking the Canon, Feminist Classics/Many Voices, review essays and book reviews. ‚ÄòRethinking the Canon‚Äô gives space for an individual to reflect on one text that they feel ought to be essential reading for feminists working on global issues, but which is likely to be marginalized by existing disciplinary boundaries: they are invited to bring the text to our attention and to explain why it is essential reading. ‚ÄòFeminist Classics/Many Voices‚Äô, by contrast, includes several short appraisals of a book already widely considered a classic for feminists working on global issues. Reviewers draw on their distinct disciplinary, geographical and personal locations to offer diverse readings of the classic text. Review essays survey several texts on a single theme, aiming either to explore a recent debate that has generated a range of new publications or to survey the best of the literature covering a more established area of research. The book reviews provide brief introductions to, and evaluations of, as broad a range of new publications as space allows.

Optical microscope and scanning electron microscope were employed for the microstructure observation, and X-ray diffraction, electron probe micro-analyzer, and transmission electron microscope were used for phase determination. It was found that the grain size increased and the volume fractions of initial M6C carbides decreased along with the increase in solution treatment temperature. When tested at 650¬†¬∞C/320¬†MPa, the stress rupture lives decreased with the increase in solution treatment temperature, but the stress rupture lives increased slightly at first and then decreased for the samples solution heat treated at 1220¬†¬∞C when tested at 700¬†¬∞C/240¬†MPa. The elongations showed the descendent trends under these two conditions. The stress rupture life and elongation for the aged samples all showed a noticeable improvement at 650¬†¬∞C/320¬†MPa, but there was no noticeable improvement at 700¬†¬∞C/240¬†MPa. The reasons can be attributed to the grain size, test conditions, and the initial and secondary carbides.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Effect of Heat Treatment on Microstructure and Stress Rupture Properties of a Ni‚ÄìMo‚ÄìCr‚ÄìFe Base Corrosion-Resistant Superalloy","doi":"10.1007/s40195-018-0837-y","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s40195-018-0837-y","venue":"Acta Metallurgica Sinica (English Letters)"}

Pain is a signal of a physical injury that would be otherwise ignored by the individual, a form of ignorance that would ultimately have mortal consequences. Crile believed that pain has a second purpose, that has important implications for how psychiatry now understands the emotions, specifically fear and anxiety. In essence, he suggested that fear is the memory of pain, and its adaptive advantage is that it enables individuals to anticipate and avoid injury. Fear-as-memory could be acquired either through individual experience (learned fear) or through species experience (instinctive fear). Among other things, this conception of pain and fear explained why surgical shock (from physical injury) and nervous shock (induced by fear or fright) appeared, at times, to provoke a similar physiologic response--a phenomenon first commented on by the British surgeon, Herbert Page. With this simple grammar, injury-pain-fear, Page and Crile laid the foundations for the modern concept of psychogenic trauma, extending the old idea of \"trauma,\" meaning a wound or physical injury, to include psychological experiences and processes. The modern conception was completed by Freud, by connecting one more emotional state, anxiety. If fear is not simply a memory of pain but a memory that is bound to stimuli in the here-and-now, then anxiety is memory set loose. Put in other words, anxiety is the capacity to imagine pain and not merely to recollect pain. From the time of Beyond the Pleasure Principle (1919), anxiety took on a life of its own, so to speak, no longer part of the constellation of emotions and experiences identified by Page and Crile. Without an external object toward which to direct itself, fear becomes anxiety--a state of nervous anticipation of the unknown, of what is hidden in the shadows or penumbra of awareness. Anxiety is not a vector directed toward a threatening object or event in the environment but is situated in the person's own bodily experience, the workings of the mind, the Cartesian theater of self-representation. As an experience and event located entirely within the psyche, to be mastered by asserting a strong ego, reflections on anxiety became one of the self-constituting experiences of the Western concept of the person. In contemporary psychiatry, the constellation of injury, pain, fear, anxiety, memory, and imagination would seem to live on mainly in the context of traumatogenic anxiety and PTSD.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","inCitations":["09d465a7909ba47969e1efd5447a3e301de4dd8f","a5eacdb724aa979c46b20e46a3604926bd6bc8d0","61bd3c84a42a14cd4067823609a34a52877a1e7b","b0b08fbf100cd010cd93db927ab140d8c62192d8","bdba77a9968d3edc2d5ec85de6755a82b107ed37","6adf9bc998844a02e26be9b8fe0bfc0cee0e55d2","ff395ed20ca4cbd2f9b16e308dae9ae25a33363e","5d63e5de76932eca3c8088c49d3fb5cc71818845","4841198ccf5286c0649e8e38ff02e92f31874783","4e6c62ce3affc8b75cad3854715e6c584c680141","ea8e174803d8aaa9355544e3b2ff835e75dac159","0805581719aa88471fdf873ec9fbd25729e9486c","44bd55e3ca3a1c2f1592bcfd70678b69eb28945b","1b5c7d427e86cac229bc2269d3b429ad380b4024","adc36910fd0df2586b1c8b3d88746a78ba083ab2","3a55720c23960178fd8e4fb589b1496bb0fbd28c","b0b0bbc9a84a7bb45fc83fc91c563d5098d06ca8","ed94eb8c7a4e8f4a9c43ce1644754790417bf235","6e82a301e98c29a1be605adb602a09be9ea800cb","3885cf17c46394b516121cca46303ffa287d0e29","d7d972e6e501bacaf381638ba5c98e4eb9ffc142","bce3af7916233b519a67a44bea5366f2f1bc3eea","53026a51a224826b8612ddba89c999cf1877bd5e","2412feb9dd4d805bfb57572dbad7ebdcc87c07a9","c52925edb96afe4a51e8fcc2e576c200f713a829","750e18b143ba8b9e808f0a69b1b91d59e68bb805","0e6d9dda79b198b4b97167284498e7931a2fb799","33276038a4101b1cf452f9d09c03bf4ff1ae749b","e475241b04fdb81b7c586302be818917cd2a61dd","66af2e57d743c01dab0ee8937d088451e3683b3d","e270f5bed284c2bd33ed17c50dca544a08a55c2e","6455ac75b0ce7449fd103633e0565070b5c5d29b","aa15e98c182c7bcb56179579e536964a14e8e05b","a2ce561cc3c00560172b40dafe820e80be6062a1"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"The cultural context of anxiety disorders.","doi":"10.1016/S0193-953X(18)30037-6","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/S0193-953X%2818%2930037-6","venue":"The Psychiatric clinics of North America"}

Experiments were conducted to assess the kinetics of drying in the temperature range of 30-100¬∞C. The drying rate was found to increase significantly with increasing temperature. The drying rate was compared with various exponential time decay models and the model parameters were evaluated. The approximate diffusion and logarithmic models were found to match the experimental data very closely with the maximum Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) less than 0.02. Considering fewer differences in the model evaluation factors and friendly use, logarithmic model was recommended for modelling canola drying. The experimental data were also modelled using Fick's diffusion equation, the effective diffusivity coefficients having been found to be from 3 . 76 x 10 -11 m 2 /s to 8.46 x 10 -11 m 2 /s in the range of experimental data covered in the present study. For the process, the activation energy was calculated to be 11.03 kJ/mol assuming an Arrhenius type temperature reliance.","inCitations":["d1cbf18724800bd2cb9b10b3813254d444de6eed","b60f522e958a0dd1eb4f28a4260186cd16622f35","b63ce48a8b283fabd98013e1c086860d22bc1099","7d57f617347298be702cfe5e8799aedf62ed24cd","19ac5a8a4da89711f4cfc4827c3fbaab0da0f7ff","9a5ba58e7b884a797558304215f3e2c8c8e41482","62eb9daa512579fdd3767a643daf44fb45c37505","297b223114bb52fb357929af1a53b793574c2873","0c08ff3a40f650a214172bb823c6114412996f11"],"pdfUrls":["https://www.agriculturejournals.cz/publicFiles/31821.pdf"],"title":"Modelling the drying kinetics of canola in fluidised bed dryer.","doi":"10.17221/256/2009-cjfs","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.17221/256%2F2009-cjfs","venue":""}

CEUS was performed on 109 masses in 85 IDC cases before resection. Based on the immunohistochemical staining on the antigen Ki-67, the masses were divided into negative group, weakly positive group, positive group, and strong-positive group. Significant statistical differences were noticed in time to peak, arrive intensity, and peak intensity in the positive groups compared with the negative group. Compared with the positive groups, the negative group showed significant statistical differences in arrive intensity and peak intensity. The antigen Ki-67 was positively correlated with arrived intensity, intensity changes, and rising curve's slope. In contrast, it was negatively correlated with arrived time, time to peak, and continuous time. The hemodynamic parameters of CEUS were correlated with the expression of antigen Ki-67. On this basis, Ki-67 is an effective supplement to the diagnosis of IDC.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Correlation between Ki-67 Expression and Hemodynamics of Contrast-Enhanced Ultrasound in Patients with Breast Infiltrative Ductal Carcinoma.","doi":"","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"The American surgeon"}

Rudd explores means to increase research impacts through techniques such as big-question exercises and exercises to determine best practices. As an additional means to increase the impact and policy relevance of conservation research, we suggest researchers embed themselves in the daily working environment of other communities, such as government offices, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) or disparate scientific fields, to learn about the constraints and opportunities that influence conservation work in these communities. In his thorough treatment of research impacts, Rudd presents the benefits and shortcomings of two frameworks for understanding and improving research impacts on policy in theory and in practice. Following Beyer (1997) and Amara et al. (2004), his first framework classifies research impacts as conceptual (policy makers are sensitized to new issues and change their beliefs), instrumental (policy decisions are affected directly by results of scientific research), and symbolic (results of scientific research are used to support established policy positions). In his second framework, which he bases on Shaxson (2009), Rudd classifies research issues into 4 domains according to the extent that scientific knowledge is fully developed and the policy issue is clearly articulated: domainofuncertainty(lowscientificknowledge,lowpolicy articulation), domain of evidence (low scientific knowledge, high policy articulation), domain of partisanship (high scientific knowledge, low policy articulation), and domain of best practices (high scientific knowledge, high","inCitations":["6056a4abe5f81a31b4d4f644730ec036873cdb7b","664935a38e93092f1d8ab6d37063e1594e4bae55","cc548c65fbf5162018cb5af4767c52a33d9c967f","8a1233eb68389b881928a1a3e88749e0f45196a4","7f0b5effe6ea92088b620bab05f925ca5a778346","fa6220c883d7881adb0bb3011ded64f00e81e49f","97e7fa96016f092137dba11fe6f01207b43801bf","f31f8cf35eb329b7bf01cf21b6b35a49acbb173b","8a3816e941ce8f3c04c7c24a0130f231c9af0dfc","b1bd8cd517e8bfc667e3b16a17d452252895b944","6063053cc246fbc9da2f7f25920de1fec9c4d113"],"pdfUrls":["https://cspo.org/legacy/library/1301291038F71639511HF_lib_12Jenkinsconbio.pdf","http://maxwelllab.weebly.com/uploads/9/6/2/0/96205508/jenkins_et_al_2012_conbio.pdf"],"title":"Increasing conservation impact and policy relevance of research through embedded experiences.","doi":"10.1111/j.1523-1739.2012.01878.x","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1523-1739.2012.01878.x","venue":"Conservation biology : the journal of the Society for Conservation Biology"}

This limitation can be overcome by using electric power available on the spacecraft (e.g., from solar arrays, nuclear reactors or beamed energy sources such as laser light or microwave energy transmitted to the spacecraft) and coupling it with a working fluid or gas. Specific impulses up to 10,000 seconds can be achieved, reducing propellant consumption significantly. In fact, mass savings are so dramatic that electric propulsion thrusters are one of today‚Äôs enabling technologies in spacecraft technology. They enable much smaller satellites and therefore less expensive launch vehicles, bigger telecommunication satellites and new types of interplanetary missions.","inCitations":["9ef6d06a4a9a0d1a1b99f0857dcf4d9907b6ecf5"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Electric Propulsion Systems","doi":"10.1007/978-3-7091-0547-4_6","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-7091-0547-4_6","venue":""}

The idea behind the well known technique of translation memories is to economise effort by re-use of previously translated fragments. This could be adapted to other text processing domains, in particular to the field of man-machine dialogue. Simulation of correct human behaviour could be based on memorising the dialogue fragment or, more adequately, the results of its processing. The mechanism of extraction from the memory should be triggered by the same element which had earlier triggered the memorisation mechanism. Each case of making such use of Dialogue Processing Memory may be stored for possible future use with a memory refreshment/oblivion mechanism.","inCitations":["d4d5f0700b61100d40d8dbd44fa702a8faa50585"],"pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1007/11558637_20"],"title":"Dialogue Processing Memory for Incident Solving in Man-Machine Dialogue","doi":"10.1007/11558637_20","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/11558637_20","venue":"IMTCI"}

In this paper we suggest a new corrected least squares estimator, where the bias correction is based on approximating the finite sample bias by a lower bound. This estimator is computationally very simple. It is compared with previously proposed corrected least squares estimators, where the correction aims at removing the asymptotic bias or the exact finite sample bias. For each type of corrected least squares estimators we consider the theoretical form, which depends on an unknown parameter, as well as various feasible forms. An analytical comparison of the theoretical estimators is complemented by a Monte Carlo study evaluating the performance of the feasible estimators. The new estimator proposed in this paper proves to be superior with respect to the mean squared error.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"An application of approximate finite sample results to parameter estimation in a linear errors‚Äêin‚Äêvariables model","doi":"10.1111/j.1467-9574.1991.tb01297.x","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-9574.1991.tb01297.x","venue":""}

The references lists from the included articles were also searched.\n\n\nSTUDY SELECTION\nStudies retrieved during the literature search were reviewed by 2 reviewers independently. Suitable articles were identified by applying inclusion criteria.\n\n\nDATA EXTRACTION\nData regarding participants and the frequency, intensity, duration, and type of dance form used were extracted. The effect that each dance program had on defined outcomes and the feasibility of each program were also reviewed.\n\n\nDATA SYNTHESIS\nThirteen articles were identified. The quality of studies varied, and methodological limitations were evident in some. The evidence evaluated suggests that two 1-hour dance classes per week over 10 to 13 weeks may have beneficial effects on endurance, motor impairment, and balance.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nDance may be helpful for some people with PD. This article provides preliminary information to aid clinicians when implementing dance programs for people with PD. Higher-quality multicenter studies are needed to determine the effect of other dance genres and the optimal therapy volume and intensity.","inCitations":["6e1a2afd4ab5f8868bde47c2f239964dd5e7b8d8","add6498d359c67f1a8d2d9552444678d722b9a32","81ba565b3a7f29e0cde3124d25097ab0f5a1b118","59428cc18d25eb1524cc5170ce1c587a46f48b05","b469cf73a4c5d30395dc7d75054ad28fc4cb79bb","3fea5c0596bce95d155eee92b792620927481cfe","a1f8c0c41850eaca7bf9020e1e0e4092c7568b4e","980b0d4daed0aefaa78ba7cf99fe562a19bcca78","9f8d8250316160475de00e454fe8cdf5ba63af8c","05b555d8bb4ed29557c6aebfb99f14aeda6a0728","a2cf84826b49e8a6d45be79fb1d879a3f14ce5a9","602aeefa91a9af1c51e7e9d8a47f8f2ddd314e9a","cfd60d91396d14062445e3ba1975b0decd076a0a","3a9178ef248496bf4fc9230547d4dd28d3234711","ed0d4c4a94604778905ef48ca720509bb706e6a9","5de060fe41c6677dd499d5fff44b500860d434e2","81576f5da2d314322580ef767088dec6a187acd2","34ab07404cce757f0bcb7ed92da65ea047802fb6","92d2a2cc48a08afd37028c5a4bffc87b9ee3978c","2fd1c76a6f818250d2e6bf575d22bb8b5d311e4e","24b251d1695dc69d89c1b0a1db15bf36effb5cfc","03f36136168c2a11823f50678409334b47392af1","2530fb3342f8bdd26c530a8c5efe63e6020fd779","9104231d41433b31970e4956ecc2edd9898679af","cfed46233aba9ebf7573ed7bd6b00fd362ba855a","089187f41b04645abf2d56f94b3c90374acffaba","0ae6f812d8a72a95cafbc8e2cb9673ff7a52f0b3","1675917bc77d62835de24df4d5f5cdc852fabf53","939f7672d775d7c534468ea4016732e8765e6d72","09b4274bbcf1809cf698865a2fb8dd907ece4511","52843c9dba5fdb06b66452a5633ada746bae03a4","39ea27d55a191e3db6349adb7780ee4ce44c03c3","48c54acaa8b72177a2eef6b5796fa7dc7c8f2842","acbdcdf601d8dd63bae88e6c15ee2d2bf756374f","b115c99cae51bd4dbef74e5efa5b3f47385948df","9ff60a1e99fb0f69431cfe82ca44ef7872344462","99d57aecb3e0708fa486061c6a54557bd9772e68","28b0a4a11a2949fa68ba9ea087a9df8bbcc4023d","a3ec334513a71417fa327c87be91407689fb8f98","dd28e2ccd70ef3f5954b55a899d54145e95fbfc5","facdc46a45c2c5ab5ffcb2b4af44f4fa4d5d1578","07dfbf8d2436613e1f0cebf4fd1b16913d4e7ca0"],"pdfUrls":["https://ulir.ul.ie/bitstream/handle/10344/4401/Shanahan_2015_dance.pdf;jsessionid=8120A03D9E0B17854DEDFDE42C1D030A?sequence=2"],"title":"Dance for people with Parkinson disease: what is the evidence telling us?","doi":"10.1016/j.apmr.2014.08.017","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apmr.2014.08.017","venue":"Archives of physical medicine and rehabilitation"}

The instruments included the Endress + Hauser Promass 63M Coriolis meter for measuring density, the Lasentec M600P for measuring particle size distribution, and a prototype ultrasonic monitor that was developed by Argonne National Laboratory for measuring suspended solids concentration. In addition, the power consumption of the recirculation pump was monitored to determine whether this parameter could be used as a tool for in-line slurry monitoring. The Promass 63M and the M600P were also evaluated as potential indicators of suspended solids concentration. In order to use the Promass 63M as a suspended solids monitor, the densities of the fluid phase and the dry solid particle phase must be known. In addition, the fluid phase density and the dry solids density must remain constant, as any change will affect the correlation between the slurry density and the suspended solids concentration. For the M600P, the particle size distribution would need to remain relatively constant. These instruments were demonstrated and tested at the Gunite and Associated Tanks Remediation Project at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory. The testing of the instruments was conducted in parallel with the testing of a Pulsair mixing system, which was used to mix the contents of the selected tank. A total of six tests were performed. A submersible pump was positioned at two depths, while the Pulsair system was operated at three mixing rates.","inCitations":["a0f7ee498350acb1c7728e8864498beffb498cad","3801b031ee51cd8e741c8b5940ecf7535eedc437","f765e2dcf6a1efe33e522e922aef6f15c2792037","41c18ad80187f951f4d499017addb6b4f4ef587f"],"pdfUrls":["https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc793727/m2/1/high_res_d/9380.pdf"],"title":"Testing of In-Line Slurry Monitors and Pulsair Mixers with Radioactive Slurries","doi":"10.2172/9380","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.2172/9380","venue":""}

Plasma oxalate in hemodialysis patients, 442 +/- 41 micrograms/100 mL (mean +/- SE), and peritoneal patients, 394 +/- 115 micrograms/100 mL, were significantly higher than that in normal subjects, 11 +/- 1 microgram/100 mL (P less than 0.001). Average daily oxalate removal in subjects on hemodialysis, based on dialysis losses and urinary excretion, 35 +/- 3 mg/24 h, was significantly greater than urinary excretion of normal subjects, 26 +/- 1 (P less than 0.01). Oxalate removal from peritoneal dialysis patients, 28 +/- 2 mg/24 h, was not significantly different from that of hemodialysis patients or urinary excretion of normal subjects. Plasma ascorbate and B6 status were not correlated with plasma oxalate. A positive correlation between B6 deficiency and oxalate removal rate was not found. Plasma oxalate was correlated with time on dialysis (all patients) (P = 0.02). In a separate study of 15 hemodialysis patients followed over 2.3 +/- 0.2 yr, both plasma oxalate and oxalate removal rate significantly increased, P less than 0.001 and 0.05, respectively. It was concluded that oxalate removal rate is increased in hemodialysis patients and that the increased total body oxalate burden in these patients is not due to decreased removal. Although the increase may result from increased oxalate synthesis or gastrointestinal absorption, B6 deficiency and increased plasma ascorbate do not play a role.","inCitations":["f7d8c0288e74f6660407935b865dcca00ef8c767","d712ab52bbf51a8de648c4dc02b50118c503ba66","8286b1b30ce7184e72a57ed50a461864b319f3bf","7bd89f7711f81abac3277f76c08182eeecd71193","eb00d6c93aa2727706eea7c62289b18c4c02c8b4","b48bf19f4532e433df7ab5ae6f44fe9f1982dd73","98b8b3339c5a3fc7b519025514835cc158d658ed","155a52219f3516bbe0e9f983633fae5dcb051694","58cfa9c02690167af7028ff9e1cbe677b5d9cd59","4daf2f0a521e53fc2467a68939a92042608c8943","a69f55659564547d4a987fea368f453d2f969385","aadc2e55817583294d92cc8dae1e8f9c7c799e3a","219c122532afbf13a5f9fc6e6e4e4b648105c6f7","9ad24348cbdddf1fc64967d60c27dba677a47d16","c28cf151588b5276dc8b48f7e7746bea731c93c6","17c4e5a39dbe35a88111837652edd04a3c2b8b6c","0bc97a25159212217092ed5464968ef355a94bf3","db01a3f515e142d0f570058a8be88d6f7d6939de"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Plasma oxalate levels rise in hemodialysis patients despite increased oxalate removal.","doi":"","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"Journal of the American Society of Nephrology : JASN"}

Chronic diarrhea can occur as a result of protein-losing P ortal hypertension in neonates and infants has enumerable causes. The treatment is frustrating with dismal results in many instances. Arterioportal fistulas (APFs) are a rare cause of portal hypertension. Successful catheter closure is possible when the anatomy is suitable. Here we present an arterioportal fistula in a 40-day-old infant successfully closed by catheter intervention. A 40-day-old female infant presented with progressive abdominal distension since 20 days of life. Child was born by normal delivery with weight of 3.5 kg. Antenatal and immediate postnatal period was uneventful. Since day 20 of life parents noticed progressive abdominal distension, irritability, and reduced feeding. The baby had diarrhea with weight loss. There was no melena or hematochezia. On examination the baby weighed 3.5 kg, with a pulse of 110 beats/min and normal volume. Abdomen was tense, grossly distended with prominent veins on anterior abdominal wall (Fig. 1A). There was significant hepatosplenomegaly with ascites. There was no bruit over the abdomen. Other systems were normal. The liver function tests and hemogram were within normal limits (Table 1). Abdominal ultrasound with Doppler showed dilated right portal vein measuring 13 mm with portal hypertension. There was reversal of flow with an arterial pattern. A large artery was directly opening into the aneurysmally dilated portal vein. Computed tomograpgy angiogram of the abdomen revealed a large vessel arising from aorta and directly joining the right portal vein (Fig. 1B). A diagnosis of solitary large arterioportal fistula was made. Child was taken for conventional angiogram. Heparin (100 U/kg) was administered and the fistula imaged with contrast injection into the descending aorta just above the renal artery. Retrograde filling of left and main portal vein was seen (Fig. 1C/Video S1, http://links.lww.com/MPG/A190) (Video S1: Angiographic demonstration of arterioportal fistula). There was narrowing at the arteriovenous junction of the fistula. Hepatic vein wedge pressure measured was 13 mmHg. An Amplatzer Duct Occluder II (AGA Medical Corporation, North Plymouth, MN) measuring 5/4 mm was chosen. This device has a waist with retention skirts on either side to prevent embolization.

Research Design: People with a wide range of chronic conditions attending self-management courses (N=1,341 individuals) were administered the generic Health Education Impact Questionnaire (HEI-Q). Data were collected before the first session (baseline) and at the end of courses (follow-up) resulting in 842 complete responses. The median (interquartile range) age was 64 (54 to 73) years and most participants were female (75%). Outcomes were categorized as Substantial improvement (Effect Size, ES ‚â• 0.5), Minimal/No change (ES -0.49 to 0.49) and Substantial decline (ES ‚â§ -0.5). Results: On average, one third of participants reported substantial benefits after attending a self-management course. Proportions of participants reporting substantial benefits ranged from 49% in Skill and technique acquisition to 27% in Health service navigation. Stratification by gender, age and education showed that younger participants were more likely to benefit, particularly young women. No further subgroup differences were observed. Conclusions: Given that the health of people with chronic diseases tends to decline, this evaluation is reassuring in that about one third of participants coming from a wide range of backgrounds receive substantial improvements in their self-management skills.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Who benefits most from participating in chronic disease self-management programs?","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

The algorithms are based on a fault model that considers the effect of DVS on transient fault rate. ? The design of offline components enables the online components to save energy using slack due to uncertainties in fault occurrences. ? The algorithms are validated both under simulation environments and on a reallife hard real-time testbed. This paper investigates fault tolerance and dynamic voltage scaling (DVS) in hard real-time systems. The authors present quasi-static task scheduling algorithms that consist of offline components and online components. The offline components are designed the way they enable the online components to achieve energy savings by using the dynamic slack due to variations in task execution times and uncertainties in fault occurrences. The proposed schemes utilize a fault model that considers the effects of voltage scaling on transient fault rate. Simulation results based on real-life task sets and processor data sheets show that the proposed scheduling schemes achieve energy savings of up to 50% over the state-of-art low-energy offline scheduling techniques and incur negligible runtime overheads. A hard real-time real-life test bed has been developed allowing the validation of the proposed algorithms.","inCitations":["ec00c41377e61d560bbe6d5cad5e116ef7c2f3c1","10fa76b6b06da99a9754a8a465b5a31ade3781d3","923ede19b7938cbbd8e0b6b358921f0f3a349999","3d4accc081211cc4e715c78cfc0e6061b89bd205","e20099d8570060b00d5853142d7f782632b7b05b","e1160e3e7923f3fedb8005e4b76121a24be67efc","e66001a5112709245fa198be61b3baff2374ba42","120098ce77b3753019bdddbe9cd16e1289e3879b","323a055b60a0cf5753919fad6444d1e124e1abdd","f77cb240cc5c5fde8fdfe580d88e8975d7c84ce2","4cc170e5c6f6eb7d977ebf5662030c0d329b00ea","24172fbe826ccf04098a9029c6baa3e03f17b637","6ffff8e3c11449b92bda0ec0d65af23634a2ccf7","33964d984fa411b807e9bf8ac25e638f29b9129e","97a5f425b9f367928945dcbaa697960e3051cfe1","f405e8a447a700b4c017e52fdf91045ffd9928bc","1d25857d0484a3f994e63793c9afc4e5a0c9dfb5","b60bbe679016d9368e5f0f801c0a866bd9ec8837","56d3f734eb18ed2b01c9f757718f1a8c94cdc766"],"pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jss.2012.01.020"],"title":"Quasi-static fault-tolerant scheduling schemes for energy-efficient hard real-time systems","doi":"10.1016/j.jss.2012.01.020","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jss.2012.01.020","venue":"J.

Mixed-signal components, digital-to-analog and analogto- digital converters, are used to compress the tester channels and then to expand the test at the circuit under test. The method allows greater bandwidth efficiency than the existing SerDes alternative. However, the MVL signal can be sensitive to noise and nonlinearity errors.

Oil and gas deposits support this view: gas/oil ratios and methane concentrations tend to increase with depth above 150¬∞C. Although oil cracking is suggested and receives wide support, laboratory pyrolysis does not give products resembling natural gas. Moreover, it is doubtful that the light hydrocarbons in wet gas (C 2 Óó∏C 4 ) could decompose over geologic time to dry gas (> 95% methane) without catalytic assistance. We now report the catalytic decomposition of crude oil to a gas indistinguishable from natural gas. Like natural gas in deep basins, it becomes progressively enriched in methane: initially 80% (wet gas) to a final composition of 100% methane (dry gas). To our knowledge, the reaction is unprecedented and unexpectedly robust (conversion of oil to gas is 100% in days, 175¬∞C) with significant implications regarding the stability of petroleum in sedimentary basins. The existence or nonexistence of oil in the deep subsurface may not depend on the thermal stability of hydrocarbons as currently thought. The critical factor could be the presence of transition metal catalysts which destabilize hydrocarbons and promote their decomposition to natural gas.","inCitations":["ac15a7579690eb44b8bff9fa9ac5c51bdc09c841","c30827a917e580b44dcdf5c792d7019ff320a14c","bac5bdeeaee35dceca4d606d64910afad33c3e33","075380d2c7bc3d7aba7e3ab7be3f906af52a0512","e906c8c1987187624411f82cbbb08ba7e83aa3ce","5f12400b3bd1314cdcb2a093637c094f5bc79e20","ce3042b8113786ad995bf442e9f8d64862a44e35","31d5aa0f73b36be5a33369a932df23b148782815","80038d82c0deacb7df9edd604d7dada41aed56a9","4b525c94d257cebec60c99f84c5ac2dd041eb9dd","520a619827a88a88a988c8a4359ac41091e1db83","2253bb87fb3ac501a4b51ee8612486888780dffc","8fd8c2deda34360df35d6461b7c2d554e79c4ab8","7371cbc29d51d73497a1302b2f4a031b9848d48e","cc1bf6a27a04c524915e16d8bf5a827b48349ea9","bc1beacc064e1a81a8347be43fac4b111e222d52"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"The catalytic decomposition of petroleum into natural gas","doi":"10.1016/S0016-7037(97)00310-4","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/S0016-7037%2897%2900310-4","venue":""}

The observer is based on least-squares optimization, and exploits a piecewise- bilinear representation of the back-emf (speed voltage) func- tion. By smoothly switching from an observer-based closed-loop control to an open-loop control at low velocity, observer ill- conditioning is avoided and reliable operation is achieved under all operating conditions. The new scheme delivers performance comparable to sensor-based closed-loop control, yet requires only a moderate amount of on-line computation. Experimental results provide evidence of the viability and performance of the new scheme.","inCitations":["4c45929324577955689e1c37ba6da3034a404d96","eec87553d75531e13891992ffbf235581dd12115"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Sensorless Velocity Control of Permanent-Magnet","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

The formation, evolution and total or partial destruction of Neogene sedimentary basins were highly controlled by the geodynamic situations and the positions of the basins in the Betic Cordillera. It is impossible to reconstruct the geometry of basins formed during the Early and Middle Miocene, concurrently with the westward drift of the Internal Zones, because in many cases only small outcrops remain. The basins formed on the mobile substratum (the Internal Zones) are characterized by a sedimentary infill made up of synorogenic deposits, which were intensely deformed towards the end of the Middle Miocene, and which were heavily eroded before the beginning of the Late Miocene. In the External Zones, deposition mainly took place in the North Betic Strait, an area across which there was wide communication between the Atlantic and the Mediterranean, which received huge olistostromic masses in its more mobile sector (the foredeep basin), and which evolved differently in its eastern and western sectors. The palaeogeography of the Cordillera changed radically at the beginning of the Late Miocene, when the westward drift of the Internal Zones ceased. During this time the North Betic Strait disappeared and, in what had been its northwestern half approximately, the Guadalquivir Basin became individualized.

Acrylamide was selected as the functional monomer and N,N-methylenebisacrylamide as the crosslinking agent. The copolymerization process was confined to the surface of the PVC beads grafted with diethyldithiocarbamate iniferter initiator in the presence of lysozyme. After extraction of lysozyme from the shell of the PVC-MIP beads, the latter were then used as artificial receptors for the rebinding of lysozyme. The sequential steps of the modification of PVC beads were monitored by XPS, infrared and Raman spectroscopies. The imprinting step was found to be essential as the PVC-MIP beads could recognize lysozyme but not the non-imprinted beads (PVC-NIP). The binding properties of PVC-MIP beads were determined using UV spectroscopy from adsorption isotherms of lysozyme, cytochrome, and myoglobin. The imprinted beads were found to be highly selective toward lysozyme over the competitive proteins. This work shows the interest of photoiniferter as an efficient mean for the design of molecularly imprinted polymer beads for rapid, selective removal of proteins. ¬© 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J.

Viruses in the family Hypoviridae associated with reduced virulence (hypovirulence) of the chestnut blight fungus, Cryphonectria parasitica, have held a prominent place in this research. This has been due in part to the severity of the chestnut blight epidemics in North America and Europe and early reports of hypovirulence-mediated mitigation of disease in European forests and successful application for control of chestnut blight in chestnut orchards. A more recent contributing factor has been the development of a hypovirus/C. parasitica experimental system that has overcome many of the challenges associated with mycovirus research, stemming primarily from the exclusive intracellular lifestyle shared by all mycoviruses. This chapter will focus on hypovirus molecular biology with an emphasis on the development of the hypovirus/C. parasitica experimental system and its contributions to fundamental and practical advances in mycovirology and the broader understanding of virus-host interactions and fungal pathogenesis.","inCitations":["f3890f83c55ddaf1044887330fd95ddc5ba6b9af","b34375947a4ffbf56972b3b23efcdb6cbacdb498","282ec86be5405fc78e765d60c167a0e398c0da08","d82482ef3d635cfd113c914dee3ed38bdfdd1b69","021284e9ace3616e3bdce749a7b1fac296331a62","a28782f6d5edfdf355dedc274573d4f9a147d8b0","afe4c0c5589c96e01af62f8b5bcaf7e3aad8f310","6ccf88a4b73a5ddc8f957387d069b97c6ac67abc","be9c27cfcb31e67da46b87ff896cf6b974b2bbb4","1a2df0731c6bb949bb1c1e06b099135ade00bbc2","ae7e3dc643544f9b3e8ad24d6d61249a2aec5955","3ea098f5cb44c654a49857530b0d58caac5a7b32","53437a40b93a2168d33861cde7ddd86b07eb004f","5f3a50bda162ff242aabb435382133b129b75717","787238ba9205cb90f53828811f7f24fe0bb96e70","abaf3b96150f9b6cb9a65e0650d7ffc2ed63dac0","7401358f4c9da58fec8b610365b03d37148922da","98814722818bafafd203bb010fa55bfaa7498279","f51c611dd9812a8aa1653b84bd046297a6b4f7b4","a059f760c70bcc69c50463056d0e583a5f84748e","a210b53a1ce5270a590cc9a00beba908b5e091b5","8e8355e63b038543b21df7e46588936266854be0","773f5eeab1af4b8bef635eb4753481872283b6cd","1bf564daa626f581fc7d5636861129885bef70b3","142dd17646676815e1eec928477e274e9662f33e","b099609550c6724d44982089de71833ce84a22c1","9677a5c87c8e965fde1c0e2bd5f094fc74a2c7da","8fd736a1747ebb1a01fe02d9fbcd2feba5f443df","ec3c4b562bdf83ccfd12381bdf7a3912a5216168","b7a7ac0c1facb6bc2e998ae0d658cfabdcbe1328","820a59a72d1d05a645408a78b37bbece0c1b50e7","cdc74da0f736b1fb7e4bd2928d06c7fd52cdeee4","d29116fc3ef9e573984367bd84325b77e6b23c02"],"pdfUrls":["https://www.ibbr.umd.edu/printpdf/19813"],"title":"Hypovirus molecular biology: from Koch's postulates to host self-recognition genes that restrict virus transmission.","doi":"10.1016/B978-0-12-394315-6.00005-2","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-394315-6.00005-2","venue":"Advances in virus research"}

Using interfacial tensiometry, we probe the effective acidic and basic response of nonpolar surfactant solutions to contact with a variety of polar reference liquids. The measured interfacial tensions are used as experimental coefficients in a set of equations borrowed from the thermodynamic \"surface energy component model\" of van Oss, Chaudhury, and Good (vOCG), but used here in a more heuristic fashion and with a revised interpretation of the parameters extracted to describe the dispersive, acidic, and basic character of the sample. We test the proposed characterization method using alkane solutions of purified polyisobutylene succinimide (PIBS) surfactants with systematic structural variations, and observe that the inferred parameter values are consistent with, and sensitive to, subtle differences in the surfactant chemistry. This suggests the possibility to compare different surfactant solutions semiquantitatively with regard to their acidic and basic character. In a further illustration of the proposed analysis, we characterize a solution of commercial PIBS surfactant in hexane, and find that the parameters obtained by the proposed method correctly predict the solution interfacial tension with a polar liquid not included among the chosen reference liquids.","inCitations":["71038a4878513aac3965f09ad428f1a11afdf13c","f99ba6123ff0939bc5312664f85c5d446c9f2506"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Characterizing the acid/base behavior of oil-soluble surfactants at the interface of nonpolar solvents with a polar phase.","doi":"10.1021/jp510748q","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1021/jp510748q","venue":"The journal of physical chemistry.

Plates with smaller pores are better impregnated with nickel nitrate solution and exhibit superior electrical characteristics. This phenomenon is attributed to the effects of pore size on the corrosion behavior of the plates in the nickel nitrate solution.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://page-one.springer.com/pdf/preview/10.1007/BF00774076"],"title":"Influence of porosity on the properties of sintered carbonyl nickel electrodes","doi":"10.1007/BF00774076","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/BF00774076","venue":""}

For example, searching for forensic evidence or signs of hidden threats (what we call hard-to-find targets). Here, we examine how search accuracy for hard-to-find targets is influenced by search behaviour. Participants searched for coins set amongst a 5m x 15m (defined as x and y axes respectively) piece of grassland. The grassland contained natural distractors of leaves and flowers and was not manicured. Coins were visually detectable from standing height. There was no time limit to the task and participants were instructed to search until they were confident they had completed their search. On average, participants detected 45% (SD=23%) of the targets and took 7:23 (SD=4:44) minutes to complete their search. Participants' movement over space and time was recorded as a series of time-stamped x, y coordinates using a Total Station theodolite. To quantify their search behaviour, the x- and y-coordinates of participants' physical locations as they searched the grassland were converted into the frequency domain using a Fourier transform. Decreases in dominant frequencies, a measure of the time before turning during search, resulted in increased response accuracy as well as increased search times. Furthermore, decreases in the number of iterations, defined by the total search time divided by the dominant frequency, also resulted in increased accuracy and search times. Comparing distance between the two most dominant frequency peaks provided a measure of consistency of movement over time. This measure showed that more variable search was associated with slower search times but no improvement in accuracy. Throughout our analyses, these results were true for the y-axis but not the x-axis. At least with respect to the present task, accurate search for hard-to-find targets is dependent on conducting search at a slow consistent speed where changes in direction are minimised.
