On our theory, objects are bundles of property instances, where those properties give the nature or essence of that object. We call the theory essential bundle theory. Property possession is not analysed as bundle-membership, as in traditional bundle theories, since accidental properties are not included in the object’s bundle. We have a different story to tell about accidental property possession. This move reaps many benefits. Essential bundle theory delivers a simple theory of the essential properties of material objects; an explanation of how object coincidence can arise; an actual-world ground for modal differences between coincident objects; a simple story about intrinsic properties; and a plausible account of certain ubiquitous cases of causal overdetermination.","inCitations":["152cf07c8c7e6fab9ed18645d6f8baaee9964a91","ec31ae963f4f7a6d221c665c52ca342a06e1fc15","474d1c4c222d2585780584b4ab9b613d25508577","b73146a81fa92765715fe39772ca51994aed56a1"],"pdfUrls":["http://eprints.nottingham.ac.uk/47265/1/Essential%20Bundle%20Theory.pdf","https://nottingham-repository.worktribe.com/OutputFile/1034067"],"title":"Material objects and essential bundle theory","doi":"10.1007/s11098-017-0990-6","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11098-017-0990-6","venue":""}

We studied ant–flower–pollinator interactions in a lowland rainforest in Borneo. Frequency and duration of pollinator visits were compared between flowers attended by ants and flowers from which ants were excluded. In all four plant species studied, the activity of ants decreased the rate and/or duration of the pollinators’ floral visits. For this and other reasons it is expected that plants repel ants from flowers during anthesis. We tested this prediction for a different set of plant species in which we observed the behaviour of Dolichoderus thoracicus ants when encountering flowers. In eight out of 18 plant species studied, ants showed a significantly higher rejection rate when they encountered flowers than when they encountered controls. Our results are thus consistent with the hypothesis that ants may negatively affect plant fitness by reduced intensity of pollinator visits and that ants are repelled from flowers of many tropical plant species, although this repellence is clearly not ubiquitous.","inCitations":["b5ca0fef7d443d9d9b730071d146ea624cc6030e","cc7601c7de01a0cfea5ebae744dae2aa08ff9822","b8600858c5e5f3041ab4dd963cc239e05007ac85","eb621d96fb30751772a529c97e63dadd1f273405","c662250f450d655b8537df5b47f2ede103f344dc","d7beca11efb2c60b23a86b1af4ea793b0c3c5916","4c1076272f411ea55ada5115791356511bdbfba7","6befc8741046dea6d4d77dfa20592d3a837847a1","f76ff395bed21018f099365de8e29710a1766796","194468ba998f252b1acbd3866f8324adb6745c8e","cc426a02a667503351e4e2ea3409e6cdb680b084","5c618885f78bbaffba7f7836d5f427118ab286f6","c1f08decde6b501937d627853ac22ff279108505","472bc9505195884157a2e81fdcf346ba5476ea99","df7654041ac042604c52edbad4a9120ea2ebc8b1","a50a4948579c8c578382d4a7798aae186dffe9d8","b55bce25b889cf179e82f83ab9ce90a41aeefd69","33dd26db07f2bb365893cb20ed020457fdc45927","94fc8df1c2f5424eb8409e7316e6fec8619b64ff","ea7ff606b0f64e9710c71dca680a9cbf6b2a54ee","3ee6f69542f99b1a7f462d0ef837ce657c2cc184","994d44a20cf842425ea42423038cd4525918203a","d5bf5affa562ca935cf271ff0bbb94668c1252bf","980b25fbafa002da828d9d7a4cfa66cef6186a71","b1ab08242aebea7d400b2cc385b6680d52a5670e","7980f615a3f019ab4f50fbe0beabc4a9997766e4","1cab64ed7c78e99622120a9836660f7477330a5d","2a99b497958bd3ebf05876e55cb93703bd582691","b19dc25e9ad4d5c504351ce3ad534d026f403a62","bf2a4ac29de557c04c5bdabd793ce07f88343210","d947bf095fc59c9776faf068acd001a208fa6ab1","7b60c2ddb5360a3a913481b5b8389d8947823708","a0cc3902cb16f1f4c002a7005871c6f7ed93785f","cef8b873e77029f19eed88fbcde4780bb30de779","1c8be413a373020bd17faeab2193377aa0ee6cdc","186a38811c5dba9b5c40caf8bd65b533cd577e66","51d05f24a998be1ad774193f81231257b896cc1a","6ac543e92c67f051846f7d147ea8ee8c3990edb3","d22c0c44eb406c9d5466d25d43bd2aab6f443224"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Interaction between flowers, ants and pollinators: additional evidence for floral repellence against ants","doi":"10.1007/s11284-006-0306-3","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11284-006-0306-3","venue":"Ecological Research"}

With the advent of quantum computer and reversible logic, design and implementation of all devices has received more attention. BCD digit adder is the basic unit of the more precise decimal computer arithmetic. The research objective is to increase speed of operation for addition of BCD numbers while minimizing the power dissipation by using reversible gates. This paper proposes one new reversible logic gate MAS. The MAS gate can be used as full adder and also reduces the number of garbage outputs. It can also be used as \"Copying Circuit\" to increase fan-out because fan-out is not allowed in reversible circuits. This paper also proposes a novel reversible design of 2 digit BCD full adder. The simulation result of 2 digit BCD adder on ModelSim are also included.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://www.ijser.org/researchpaper/A-Novel-Design-and-Simulation-of-2-Digit-BCD-Adders-Using-Reversible-Gates.pdf"],"title":"A Novel Design and Simulation of 2 Digit BCD Adders Using Reversible Gates","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

The identification of water bodies were obtained by processing images at a monthly intervals captured by Sentinel-1A during 2015 having kappa indices and overall accuracy higher than 0.9. The chapter describes the seasonal variability of these water bodies, and at the same time, the relationship with human settlements located in their neighborhood. To do this, a proximity analysis was carried out to emphasize the importance of spatialtemporal studies of superficial water bodies, linked to an urban and a rural area. This information is useful to investigate changes in the ecosystem, as well as risks to human settlements, and as a contribution for a comprehensive management of hydric resources.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://api.intechopen.com/chapter/pdf-download/57557"],"title":"Sentinel-1 Satellite Data as a Tool for Monitoring Inundation Areas near Urban Areas in the Mexican Tropical Wet","doi":"10.5772/intechopen.71395","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.5772/intechopen.71395","venue":""}

Although DNA topoisomerases, which catalyze the strand passing of DNA segments through one another, make the unlinking problem solvable in principle, it remains difficult to complete the process that enables the separation of the sister duplexes. A few different mechanisms were developed by nature to solve the problem. Some of the mechanisms are very intuitive while the others, like topology simplification by type II DNA topoisomerases and DNA supercoiling, are not so evident. A computer simulation and analysis of linked sister plasmids formed in Escherichia coli cells with suppressed topoisomerase IV suggests an insight into the latter mechanism.","inCitations":["481ec693f142164869caaa29e72b89e591bc2452","3ec9a44d708ef550da5ee1dfc794332ac4101963","c77564e14ff2a6ab310e146ef85759c04d381e0f","ddd0d28240ed340e1caaa8f99733a6f567a6ccb9"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"DNA supercoiling helps to unlink sister duplexes after replication.","doi":"10.1002/bies.200900143","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1002/bies.200900143","venue":"BioEssays : news and reviews in molecular, cellular and developmental biology"}

The relationships among paraoxon concentration in water and target organs, AChE inhibition, and carboxylesterase (CaE) detoxification of paraoxon were characterized quantitatively by development of a PBPK-PD model. The PKPD model structure consisted of brain, heart, liver, kidney, and remainder of the body, which were interconnected by blood circulation. The paraoxon tissue/blood partition coefficients were: plasma/water, 1.46; liver/plasma, 5.89; brain/plasma, 3.90; heart/plasma, 2.91; kidney/plasma, 0.45; and blood/plasma, 0.91. Turnover of AChE was characterized from a dose-response study, in which its zero-order synthesis rate and first-order degradation rate constant were determined in several tissues; for brain they were 7.67 pmol/min and 7.31 x 10(-5) hr(-1). The uptake and depuration clearances of paraoxon (Cl(u) = 0.651 and Cl(d) = 0.468 ml min(-1) g body wt(-1)) were determined using a compartmental model. During continuous water exposure to paraoxon, AChE activity in the tissues declined to new steady state values that were maintained by the synthesis of new AChE. CaE was shown by simulation to be an important pathway for detoxification of paraoxon.","inCitations":["a07c0d1a75ff8cea96e4dd348602b6d5f7b65c84","04f7ad7686a1d938a76abd1f50e66383090b3db8","0fe9024100921e71486dac7c5b780030c351261d","adda951d68f8922a390ded854f00bebb7c7c5f95","ece9cd6728dcd2f6f312bd11c40075919089fd6a","a9d6b40b4e2f7573499c61127d0455e28abe2db3","f20bf2229381fc104f3915b8d50a3d4436445a5d","8439adb63f3cf9eeaaf6a0a0f0550e698c388cde","6aac0a04a624e5b76f748d5cee41a498a6171594","bddfe319ba8cdfe2a99059f77a07d09427f1adaf","e6f4d27ce3803fdb971b75dee4f02fd0887d40df","857d2a736b1cb4b003a2281fb55bf0a042e5fe2a","16de526e741ee3d6e77e6f0453b0b8226be0ff27","8c551ae4a54c54f204bf9cbc3bad62d89dce0e50","a34d4bc764e2eb155f1fde78bf07444b1c00d910","785a48242f98304b10211d1639d44cd8e309b936","415ea0d8f00717d42713ce7c78f08b4036f1d10e","7358465de3d98a9687b285f0a6bf51c91273157e","d4c72900d02047c81c88e6c53027255997b20352","796fb25a0bd7786881f85d83610974578c1f8052","dfe739a3f3c369774c792b61922c262c80a6159c","6bdfabb63cfcc9d8e1acf30c6d6fa9c310a0c3db","b5eb447a2390f1112b47488a6bd09ff37782cd8e","8a09ba119607dc0d2e381663e86fccf5ccee584d"],"pdfUrls":["https://etd.ohiolink.edu/!etd.send_file?accession=osu1487858417983294&disposition=attachment"],"title":"A physiologically based pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic model for paraoxon in rainbow trout.","doi":"10.1006/taap.1997.8168","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1006/taap.1997.8168","venue":"Toxicology and applied pharmacology"}

Access to finance is in turn influenced by variables in both the enterprise's internal and external environment. It is held that SMEs are unable to access external finance because they are not investment ready. They lack the necessary information and knowledge of their businesses to approach finance providers or to be successful in accessing funds if they do. Face-to-face interviews using structured questionnaire were conducted to collect primary data from 407 SMEs operating in the trading sector in 3 provinces- Bangkok, Chiang-Mai and Khon-Kan. Results of the structural equation modelling (SEM) reveal that quality of financial information has significant positive effect on performance and on owner-managers' perception of their ability to access external capital. A significant positive effect of their perception of ability to access capital on performance was also found.","inCitations":["ead96ed8580d1d8611c872dbfbba0e25d78f908a","276e91f2c40ab58fd5bb79f421219d7c1511027e","a51a94e3cec3e5ecf5f073fceb26f294be68cdfc","59efb995709de5f3a92e6592ff1ae9a1639bd648","764f09dfc99583386752699027a90f14e6371fe2","d61409c94cb1713d1cffd74c70a27cce1bffae4b","a603053c7b7b5a15995378ebbe93395caab99af9","91d12c2e300f4df74b6438b510b8143c12b42921","f4eaefaa198918e684b5c2ba98307e4016e8f3c1","db8e542c67435d2abe5c580770d2a3d5dbdcdf10","0a70a47d13892ff11b11320b27197de76e1b5406","50aada26481934188302b72fd48b287c50aa2940","4280cf1fb17202045bf2955f4fb44e45f3c114ec","c9930a9219dd4ebbadd10dcb2c5ba3fc896533e2","04ad9b7837e4805ec999f487faebacb54b172f32","050d8751047d5a8778486e6bfe4a3dbe5e9b6f7d","bc5faf939556aebbc9c3b80933610c4e403ade70","2239440a739d6c62faa626dd27bbe10f0158e693","866e05281332d8b9d335fb2ce1a883afb4bb8c30","d6c226a8bba45fdbea2e1ff7187485940fa30d4b","35d4c0ddd65606b363bd72cf2e6330943a77128e","9123d341581147a7f279b0f4719b213c96c9276c","f461c583317ef90560da83808e0e71775b62b3db","5731e13066a4a229fda12e19ac9bae6a06faff43","e89016cddbf142be1c06507bec9217e1c03e045c"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"The Effect of Financial Information Quality on Ability to Access External Funds and Performance of Smes in Thailand","doi":"10.1142/S0218495806000143","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1142/S0218495806000143","venue":""}

Despite appropriate treatment, the outcome may still be unsatisfactory if the patient has residual stiffness and discomfort at the elbow. Because it is critical to the outcome of all treatment methods, early range of motion should be emphasized. When operative treatment is indicated, a procedure that allows early range of motion should be chosen. If stable fixation cannot be achieved, it is often better to proceed with radial head excision. Currently, the use of a radial head prosthesis is best limited to complex fractures with associated longitudinal instability and possibly in younger patients with high functional demands. The role of arthroscopy in managing these fractures has yet to be defined. Caution is emphasized with particular regard to neurologic injury.","inCitations":["78cf453ff8b86b1c1d9a06e5aacd84ff94cdb1ec","7628518ed9a44b20c61b9973e9d1edce7a4002e5","9da698e6374368453d156c512ead71219067642e","2777bce4dba1e5b5f76a8b14e2eea9fc8fb0985b"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Radial Head Fractures","doi":"10.1007/0-387-21533-6_20","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/0-387-21533-6_20","venue":""}

Yet, despite its importance, little consensus exists as to the meaning of territorial control or the appropriate way to measure it. In order to improve our understanding of this critical concept, I propose a method of measuring territorial control using expert surveys. I use a partial credit item response model and a test-linking procedure to measure territorial control as a latent trait of a community. That trait is then reflected in answers that military or civilian raters provide on a bank of security related questions. I apply the method to an expert survey from the Vietnam War called the Hamlet Evaluation System that provided monthly ratings of over 12,000 individual communities. I show that this method provides a valid and effective means for gauging relative control in an ongoing civil war. Based on those ratings, I find that the United States and the government of South Vietnam were largely successful in securing the rural countryside in the period between 1969 and 1971.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://dataspace.princeton.edu/jspui/bitstream/88435/dsp017w62f826v/1/Douglass_princeton_0181D_10383.pdf"],"title":"Why Not Divide and Conquer?

Accordingly, we isolated intestinal sub-epithelial myofibroblasts (ISEMFs) from colonic lamina propria of rat. The isolated cells were cultured and characterized by phase contrast, immunofluorescent and RT-PCR analysis. The harvested cells expressed the specific markers such as -SMA, vimentin and were negative for desmin expression. Finally, we did trans-well migration assay to know the difficulties or convenience of this isolated cell culture experiment. The isolated rat ISEMFs grow well in culture media and easy to culture for the research purposes. Therefore, the primary ISEMF might be a useful alternative in vitro tool for bioresearch study.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Isolation and Characterization of Intestinal Sub-epithelial Myofibroblast in Rat: An in vitro Tool for Bioresearch System","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Il poursuit un triple objectif. Primo, examiner la pertinence des conceptions de la litterature ascetique (Jean Climaque en particulier) sur le caractere pluridimensionnel de l’orgueil et de l’humilite: rapport a soi, aux autres, et a Dieu. Secundo, examiner si la valorisation religieuse de l’humilite se traduit effectivement dans les attitudes et comportements des croyants par une modestie et une humilite plus grande. Tertio, proposer des pistes qui permettent d’envisager sereinement le combat spirituel contre l’orgueil de maniere a eviter les vicissitudes qui lui sont inherentes ou associees: narcissisme cache, deresponsabilisation, culpabilisme excessif, fausse humilite et compensation par un altruisme egoiste.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Orgueil, humilité et leurs vicissitudes: Une approche psychologique","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

However, there has been minimal empirical or theoretical research that has examined interactions that occur between medical residents and other healthcare professionals in the discharge process. This study provides insight into the social processes that shape and characterize such interactions.ObjectiveTo explore factors that shape interactions between medical residents and other healthcare professionals in relation to patient discharge, and to examine the opportunities for negotiations about discharge between these professional groups.DesignA qualitative ethnographic approach using observations, interviews and documentary analysis.Participants and settingHealthcare professionals working in a GIM unit in Canada.ApproachSixty-five hours of observations were undertaken in a range of settings (e.g. interprofessional rounds, medical and nursing rounds, nursing station) in the unit over a 17-month period. A maximum variation sampling approach was used to identify healthcare professionals working in the unit. Twenty-three interviews were completed, recorded and transcribed verbatim. A directed content approach using theories of medical dominance and negotiated order was used to analyze the data.Key resultsThe organization of clinical work in combination with clinical teaching influenced interprofessional interactions and the quality of discharge in this GIM unit. While organizational activities (orientation and rounds) and individual activities (e.g. role modeling, teaching) supported negotiations between medical residents and other healthcare professionals around discharge, participants had varied perspectives about their effectiveness.ConclusionsThis study illuminates social factors and processes that require attention in order to address challenges with interprofessional collaboration and discharge in GIM. These findings have implications for medical education, workplace learning, patient safety and quality improvement.","inCitations":["8e7088f2ebe280fe1ac85c55a7d11e8767ce2daa","8a9608001d05322616791d84b644c7ca273e1cb6","51ace8505c1682cac2bac6a27e82711a00a52726","e84de578a839ce29951fbd38ec23432f8340ab23","ac7939bf8d38e9367399c42575f03a40fc7e8009","1d4b16fc60f45ddfd6ed5d459aaa92bc504b84b7","95c495ba0be77966459a03ee7b532872df94fa8a"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Medical Residents and Interprofessional Interactions in Discharge: An Ethnographic Exploration of Factors That Affect Negotiation","doi":"10.1007/s11606-015-3306-6","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11606-015-3306-6","venue":"Journal of General Internal Medicine"}

Concerning to the higher void ratio of carpet fibers, at first stages it may be expected that an increase in fiber content of the reinforced soil would result in an increase in permeability of the mixture. However, the present article demonstrates that fiber inclusion will decrease the permeability of sand-fiber composite. A series of constant head permeability tests have been carried out to show the effects and consequently, a new system of phase relationships was introduced to calculate the dry mass for the sand portion of the composite. Monte Carlo simulation technique adopted with finite element theory was employed to back calculate the hydraulic conductivity of individual porous fibers from the laboratory test results. It was observed that the permeability coefficient of the porous fibers are orders of magnitude less than the skeletal sand portion due to the fine sand particle entrapment and also the fiber volume change characteristics.","inCitations":["049c3fbcd442a7247e924275a7cf208bc4514366","2e2780b872ab51fc762f5d32a76acea4c0f5a730"],"pdfUrls":["http://ijce.iust.ac.ir/files/site1/user_files_6k93w6/eng/jamshidi_reza-A-10-562-2-81ee1b9.pdf"],"title":"Investigation on the effect of carpet fiber inclusion on hydraulic conductivity of clean sand using laboratory and random finite element analyses","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Therefore, the fifth seismically active period beginning in 1988 in China's continent might not end yet, there could be some stronger earthquakes with M≥7.0 occurring in the future.","inCitations":["e465aaba9edf30db0efc508f302b6feef0604ed0"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"B value of the seismically active and quiescent periods and research of seismicty tendency in china's continent","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

In pineal glands of adult spontaneously hypertensive rats (Okamoto strain), dopamine levels increased 34%, adrenaline concentrations increased 152% and noradrenaline levels decreased by 26%, when compared with Wistar-Kyoto normotensive controls. 2. These results are consistent with the hypothesis of an increased uptake of peripheral adrenaline resulting in increased release of noradrenaline from pineal sympathetic nerves in hypertensive rats. 3. The activity of pineal N-acetyltransferase was increased fourfold in hypertensive rats, indicating increased stimulation of pineal beta-adrenoreceptors. 4. Methylation of pineal membrane phospholipids was also increased (100-320%) in hypertensive rats. 5.

In vitro shoot multiplication was achieved by culture on Murashige and Skoog medium supplemented with 2 mg L−1 6-benzyladenine and 0.2 mg L−1 naphthalene acetic acid. Continuous shoot proliferation was observed up to the seventh subculture cycle on this medium. A production cycle of 1 yr was completed when rooting and acclimatization times were included in the subculture cycle. In vitro, slow-growth storage was efficiently used for mid-term conservation of elite clones when the sucrose concentration of the medium was 120 g L−1, which enabled 100% survival from cultures stored for 4 mo without any subculture or medium addition. After 4 mo of in vitro storage, cultures transferred to the standard medium exhibited 100% regeneration, and the shoots were morphologically identical. These shoots were rooted in a medium supplemented with 2 mg L−1 indole-3-butyric acid. Rooted plantlets were transferred to the field and showed 95% survival after acclimatization. This is the first report of in vitro conservation via slow-growth storage of this important medicinal plant.","inCitations":["7a78d5547140a7b7bc5d38632e485c5b7f627a3e","adb91b1ad613f087a1e48fddd4c46ee156f30c00"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"In vitro slow-growth storage of Chlorophytum borivilianum Sant. et Fernand: a critically endangered herb","doi":"10.1007/s11627-016-9756-7","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11627-016-9756-7","venue":"In Vitro Cellular & Developmental Biology - Plant"}

Esto incluye tecnologias mas limpias, productos y servicios que reducen el riesgo ambiental y minimizan la contaminacion y el uso de los recursos\". Sin embargo, al analizar las empresas \"ambientales\" de Colombia, Chile y Mexico, se observa que en general no operan bajo esta definicion. Las empresas por si mismas tienden a auto clasificarse dentro o fuera de este mercado. Los bienes y servicios ambientales no se encuentran claramente especificados en los registros de importaciones y exportaciones de los paises, debido a que no existen codigos armonizados para una amplia gama de bienes y servicios ambientales. De hecho existen diferentes clasificaciones en el mundo desarrollado que se encuentran en proceso de unificacion, lo que dificulta cualquier analisis y crea controversias. Este estudio se enmarca en la linea de identificacion de oportunidades en el sector ambiental de America Latina y el Caribe cuyo objetivo es contribuir al desarrollo de un sector economico que pueda asegurar los beneficios de las oportunidades de un mercado de bienes y servicios ambientales en expansion, y satisfacer una demanda creciente en el sector de proteccion ambiental, particularmente a traves de alianzas o joint ventures. Se analizan experiencias de colaboracion o alianzas entre Pyme al nivel internacional, particularmente relevantes y exitosas, que sirvan de modelo a ser replicado en paises latinoamericanos. Tambien se procede a una identificacion de industrias proveedoras de bienes y servicios ambientales internacionales mas idoneas para formar alianzas (\"partnerships\" o \"joint ventures\") con Pyme latinoamericanas.

El estudio identifico que los esquemas de alianzas \"publico-privadas\" mas exitosos, de acuerdo al logro de objetivos, cumplimiento de productos comprometidos, y cumplimiento de metas, a traves de indicadores cualitativos y/o cuantitativos, fueron: el Programa Alianzas de Negocio UNIDO y ECOPROFIT. Sin embargo, se observa en general falta de objetivos claros y de una evaluacion de resultados economicos, tanto en el nivel de las empresas como del pais y la organizacion promotora de la alianza. La consideracion de las alianzas como un proceso en el tiempo, en el que interactuan diferentes actores que obtienen logros y aprenden de fracasos se pierde.

These animations are useful to give a face to multimedia applications such as virtual operators in dialog systems. Our eye animation system consists of two parts: eye control unit and rendering engine, which synthesizes eye animations by combining 3D and image-based models. The designed eye control unit is based on eye movement physiology and the statistical analysis of recorded human subjects. As already analyzed in previous publications, eye movements vary while listening and talking. We focus on the latter and are the first to design a new model which fully automatically couples eye blinks and movements with phonetic and prosodic information extracted from spoken language. We extended the already known simple gaze model by refining mutual gaze to better model human eye movements. Furthermore, we improved the eye movement models by considering head tilts, torsion, and eyelid movements. Mainly due to our integrated blink and gaze model and to the control of eye movements based on spoken language, subjective tests indicate that participants are not able to distinguish between real eye motions and our animations, which has not been achieved before.","inCitations":["3723842b5c3c14333907a4bfe5d2d64c22efee30","63d5fd1e162732cbd47564498fa11bbc9a144862","5efdf48ca56b78e34dc2f2f0ce107a25793d3fc2","f3808cc5872a46730a1b0b5925cda75cb48ff9ad","e3344c370f88fc5a7b7ee9e3408e23e3f5f5e8b5","6eeb7ee170fbf5e8d93f53731d2c1d6805d371db","2139c62658455713c378adf65241c6cab2051c11","0aadc83dab2c9013d4065fa06417bc514042b339","2ea19a1b18e29d9fd5bec1ff5e123d181c607bbe","a2d5b89ce74580a56354edc98ddb4f3f4b305f2a","561fd7646722feb68ba4775c82fbcc598e621801","3b141bf6b5a76bc66c10c3ec95245baeb9b8d93c","57306a047afdd1096d37a878ed71716e57fae93f","5872c5770016729ba6e7ea5b9e5e7cb982db6906","f1ef8b6b5fc64a0387be4514c45a15a7f02bb306"],"pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1007/s00371-009-0401-x","https://www.tnt.uni-hannover.de/papers/data/819/819_1.pdf","https://page-one.springer.com/pdf/preview/10.1007/s00371-009-0401-x","https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Kang_Liu8/publication/220067892_Video-realistic_image-based_eye_animation_via_statistically_driven_state_machines/links/00b4952b9d78c0a79b000000.pdf","http://www.researchgate.net/profile/Kang_Liu8/publication/220067892_Video-realistic_image-based_eye_animation_via_statistically_driven_state_machines/links/00b4952b9d78c0a79b000000.pdf","http://www.tnt.uni-hannover.de/papers/data/819/819_1.pdf"],"title":"Video-realistic image-based eye animation via statistically driven state machines","doi":"10.1007/s00371-009-0401-x","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00371-009-0401-x","venue":"The Visual Computer"}

This research aims to determine the interdependence of brand management and partner relationship development in marketing channels and their influence on brand performance. Therefore, BCR model was constructed. Research into the influence of marketing channel relationships on the business success of supplier operations was especially emphasised. An empirical research was conducted using a sample of 121 managers from Serbia and Montenegro. The results of quantitative analysis confirmed that three independent variables of the BCR model (brand management commitment, marketing channel relationships, and brand myopia) had a statistically significant impact on brand performance. It was also proved that companies, which adopted and implemented marketing channel relationships at a higher level than their competitors, achieved better financial results from their operations. The implications for managers of supplying and retail companies were especially emphasised and discussed.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Do partner relations in marketing channels make a difference in brand management implementation?: Evidence from Serbia and Montenegro","doi":"10.5937/ekopre1506306B","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.5937/ekopre1506306B","venue":""}

However, most studies on this topic have focused on schooling and paid limited attention to the mechanisms through which cognitive and noncognitive skills influence wages. This paper uses data from adults in seven low- and middle-income countries that participated in the STEP Skills Measurement Survey to conduct a comparative analysis of gender wage gaps. The paper uses schooling and skills measures, including reading proficiency and complexity of on-the-job computer tasks to proxy cognitive skills, and personality and behavioral measures to proxy for noncognitive skills in wage decompositions. The analysis finds that years of school explain most of the gender wage gap. The findings also suggest that cognitive and noncognitive skills affect men’s and women’s earnings in different ways, and that the effects of these skills vary across the wage distribution and between countries.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/479671478193527141/pdf/WPS7878.pdf"],"title":"Do cognitive and noncognitive skills explain the gender wage gap in middle-income countries ? an analysis using STEP data","doi":"10.1596/1813-9450-7878","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1596/1813-9450-7878","venue":""}

Planiranje, projektiranje te izvedba zastite iznimno je važan, ali ne i dovoljan korak u procesu poboljsanja stanja bucnosti u okolisu. Za uvid u pravo stanje bucnosti i valorizaciju provedenih mjera zastite potrebno je izvrsiti snimanje stvarnog stanja mjerenjima na terenu nakon sto je prometnica pustena u promet. Misljenje je strucnjaka koji se bave ovom problematikom da je optimalno kao relevantan podatak za ocjenu stanja bucnosti u okolisu uzeti stanje pet godina poslije pustanja prometnice u promet. Osim toga, kontinuirano treba pratiti i stanje na vec postojecim prometnicama. Kako i koliko cesto prikupljati podatke, kako donositi odluke o vrsti zastite nije jednostavan postupak. Za to je potreban sustav upravljanja jer kratkorocno gledajuci ostvarene ustede u provedbi zastite rezultirat ce u buducnosti znacajnim povecanjem troskova prije svega vezanim za zdravstvenu zastitu stanovnistva ali u konacnici i negativnim posljedicama za gospodarstvo.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Road Traffic Noise Management","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library Database from the beginning to June 30, 2017 were searched. IVT efficacy was measured by favorable outcome (modified Rankin Scale scores of 0–1) at 3 months, and safety measured by mortality within 3 months and symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (SICH). Pooled estimates were conducted using fixed- or random-effects model depending on heterogeneity. For SICH, studies were pooled separately according to different definitions. Twelve studies involving 7,905 participants were included. No association was found between alteplase dose and favorable outcome (OR = 0.94, 95% CI 0.78–1.14, P = 0.5; heterogeneity: Phetero = 0.01, I2 = 57.3%) and mortality (OR = 0.87, 95% CI 0.74–1.02, P = 0.08; Phetero = 0.83, I2 = 0) using random- and fixed-effects models, respectively. Low dose alteplase was associated with lower SICH as defined by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke study (OR = 0.79, 95% CI 0.64–0.99, P = 0.04; Phetero = 0.57, I2 = 0) using fixed-effects model. Subgroup and sensitivity analysis could change the results significantly. Current limited evidence was insufficient to support the speculation that low dose alteplase was comparable to standard dose in thrombolytic efficacy and safety in Asian stroke patients.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Efficacy and safety of low dose alteplase for intravenous thrombolysis in Asian stroke patients: a meta-analysis","doi":"10.1038/s41598-017-16355-9","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-017-16355-9","venue":"Scientific Reports"}
