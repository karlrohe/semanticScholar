The strong brine produced by the membrane desalination process is effectively processed by microwave and oxidation treatment in cooperation with the synergistic effect of multistage filtering, therefore, the recycling rate of the strong brine is greatly improved; and the entire recovery rate is improved to 90%. Compared with other domestic processes, the method disclosed by the invention has the advantages of advanced process, small occupied floor, good effect, low operating cost, low energy consumption and the like, and has highly integrated automatic control and low labor intensity. The method is flexible in process selection, and can flexibly combine the process routes based upon water quality. Thus, the effects of energy conservation and emission reduction are achieved; the social and environmental benefits are obvious; the environmental risk of an enterprise is greatly reduced, and parameters collected by the device in operation have practical significance on treatment of the membrane desalination process for the strong brine.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Method for processing and recycling strong brine by membrane desalination process","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Data is loaded into a client cache based on queries, which are used to form predicates describing the cache contents. A subsequent query at the client may be satisfied in its local cache if we can determine that the query result is entirely contained in the cache. This issue is called 'cache completeness'. On the other hand, 'cache currency deals with the effect of updates at the central database on the client caches. We examine various performance and optimization issues involved in addressing the questions of cache currency and completeness using predicate descriptions. Expected benefits of our approach over commonly used object 1D-based caching include lower query response times, reduced message traffic, higher server throughput, and better scalability.<<ETX>>","inCitations":["89fb6a1516079760e5d67ccd3443704e0168f4c9","e837d20f9b5df8c19b5f826ccbd8e3cf1b02be33","0112d07faff32acbd6194ef054f1bacc082932b6","7bbe190768196232e9d48bcbdd807dba6f359ec3","d7ced62908561b4528b09b02898104723afab414","d92a37535829c3becc8bd4421125d44aefd8637f","c1fa47435f0a87edcc81380de01c8884ca3fc1f8","4745e544da1d6968424ccf26ab1d0cbe5ed6dd24","8c670896dd87c890806ff9a1d37c5cb847c7a9ee","d6ba407d2470e6f8d4fb6649ff503295b46cbc4d","c173c736537fdf8d2e26b19a9b573187c652e6be","24c91d831bb3a40de12aadf877f910cbbf2d861d","3fb23a7eb2d069e76c57443fa1b6675329b81276","395bd393e29cb3ea2a1d7bcc9e5e50c3d84e4b11"],"pdfUrls":["http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/PDIS.1994.331711"],"title":"A predicate-based caching scheme for client-server database architectures","doi":"10.1109/PDIS.1994.331711","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PDIS.1994.331711","venue":"Proceedings of 3rd International Conference on Parallel and Distributed Information Systems"}

Two applications of 10ppm or 20ppmCPPU plus 100ppm GA3 to whole panicles from the full bloom stage caused abnormal fruit growth and no fruit set could be obtained. When the same treatments were applied from the end of the flowering time, fruit growth was not appreciably affected and the TSS contents of the fruits decreased. Spraying of 10ppm CPPU plus 100ppm GA3 to panicles twice and 4 times from the end of the physiological fruit drop stage promoted fruit growth. The effect was more pronounced with 4 applications than with 2 applications. Total yield per tree increased because of the increase in the average weight of both seeded and seedless fruits and the number of harvested seedless fruits increased with 4 applications. The ratio of bigger-seeded fruits weighing of more than 400g was about 60% of that of the total number of harvested fruits with 4 applications, followed by nearly 45% with 2 applications and about 25% in the control. Spraying the solution 4 times increased the ratio of seedless fruits weighing more than 200g but did not produce any seedless fruits weighing more than 400g. More frequent applications of the solution to panicles tended to delay the fruit maturity as well as to decrease the sugar content in ripened fruits. These results indicate that the combined application of 10ppm CPPU plus 100ppm GA3 from the early stage of fruit growth, which promoted fruit enlargement, has a potential to increase the commercial value of 'Irwin•f mango fruits, but at the same time the treatment may decrease the quality of ripened fruit.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/jsta1957/46/4/46_4_224/_pdf/-char/en"],"title":"Effect of Combined Application of CPPU and GA3 on the Growth of 'Irwin•f Mango Fruits","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Ribosomal salt-wash fractions prepared from interferon-treated human cells contained a protein kinase that catalyzed the [gamma-(32)P]ATP-mediated phosphorylation of the 38,000-dalton subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF-2alpha); this kinase activity was significantly enhanced in interferon-treated as compared to untreated cells. The tryptic [(32)P]phosphopeptide pattern obtained for eIF-2alpha phosphorylated by the interferon-mediated human kinase was indistinguishable from the pattern obtained for eIF-2alpha phosphorylated by the hemin-regulated rabbit reticulocyte kinase when analyzed by thin-layer chromatography with three different solvent systems and by high-voltage electrophoresis. O-[(32)P]Phosphoserine was liberated by partial acid hydrolysis from eIF-2alpha phosphorylated by either the human or the rabbit kinase. In addition to the phosphorylation of eIF-2alpha, interferon treatment of human cells enhanced the phosphorylation of two additional ribosome-associated proteins designated P(1) and P(f). The major phosphoester linkage observed for the human, as well as murine, phosphoprotein P(1) was O-phosphoserine. The interferon-mediated phosphorylation of both eIF-2alpha and protein P(1) was dependent upon the presence of RNA with double-stranded character; P(f) phosphorylation was not affected by double-stranded RNA. These results suggest that the interferon-mediated ribosome-associated human protein kinase catalyzes the phosphorylation of eIF-2alpha in a site-specific manner that is apparently identical with the reaction catalyzed by the hemin-regulated rabbit reticulocyte kinase; hence, the phosphorylation of eIF-2 may play a role in regulating the initiation of translation in interferon-treated cells.","inCitations":["b07229c01f934d30ca257f8085d7e63a43412c83","0607acaa510d35d51a0775056a15f30b73803f2f","06e2b5a7ceaf3a290136a315a3f67433b043917d","77379c66b5d3299388586737ab62be87aaefe691","9584843c2fcdf66f2232443693aabbb750e8eb3f","0d63a982705fa7df5a1722d01de7000731deb6df","00b6a996533d6610c5dc46c567d180ceb735376d","3650d40ba1f0758d47f7d339f5e128557d142829","e373b4ba2d8f6529982fb03c1b9ddc60eda9d8a9","a67136045abcf93e9f985898f2cb673a0e0721de","4fff0c34d70fca971e64596c5a5d622e1851a172","0a5f21e34a131170ce5a882c4a7452a309e7fd00","16be38f52af6087d319ca3d5a49715b0e40431cc","69d309380b5769a641e241451ee7f2292488e580","ce6107f8d0613cd6e382f58722c3b347f242c973","8ddd02d521636ff3cbdcff36b13723651343466f","96f4ef44f2cb7b98cb96defde0ba26d4cc5cb22c","e86bcd3ad90c2e2239eec02dd50b74d7698cfc49","2977dd06eaf6c41ca60520d72cab0a872a18629c","7ad34db6038337ca4a8c752e1b12970d2a870c8e","b10f31080ef713c7fed7f7eb7d8ab0be685b3e4b","4575a79b994b35d6fa58c46f2eecaf0f49dea169","dc450a4c69e97082cda4478e390dd4a859798d4f","86027bd93c1f55cc795b48ccf75f4563e7b4b5fc","69d46454868b07adbe78eda70bc69ba099b1b3b8","7ad3cedd8e056ae7bc7fb6835fa09e612440db9d","c601e3934a2fa914aaaa657dda8f4f65f6526a4f","a55c70efca20cf25ee3399f31901315231841609","0378e4c07e453e6e6bbef3f54a6e644da696b1eb","bf27cbf8e1e9fa75b0ab615abfb58e3680fbce0f","d9aa4a303ecd415ba9339ebba32a84d3d86bb4b9"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.pnas.org/content/76/2/600.full.pdf"],"title":"Mechanism of interferon action: phosphorylation of protein synthesis initiation factor eIF-2 in interferon-treated human cells by a ribosome-associated kinase processing site specificity similar to hemin-regulated rabbit reticulocyte kinase.","doi":"10.1073/pnas.76.2.600","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.76.2.600","venue":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America"}

M. manginii와 \nP. decipiens에서 발견된 자외선 흡수물질의 양은 약 1.2 정도의 비율을 보였는데 이러한 정량적 차이가 자외선 민감성에 기여한 것으로 사료된다. 본 연구에서는 또한 계절별 그리고 채집 수심별로 자외선 흡수물질의 정량적 차이를 발견할 수 있었는데 태양광선이 풍부한 여름철에 그리고 고광량이 도달되는 수심 얕은 곳에 서식하는 개체가 더욱 많은 양의 자외선 흡수물질을 함유한 것으로 나타났다.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"중파자외선에 대한 남극산 해조류의 광합성 및 자외선 흡수물질 형성 반응","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Resulting degradation products were fractionated by gel filtration and characterized by SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis.

This is because disciplinary studies of IL have focused mainly on people's conceptions of IL, not on their lived teaching and learning practices. Introducing university assignments as a contextual construct for disciplinary studies of IL, this study demonstrates how students' and educators' conceptions and experiences of real university assignments and their constructive participation in conceptualization of IL helped to uncover the actual nature of information need in the discipline of geographic information science/systems (GIS) and to gain a better understanding of the concept of, and requirements for, determining information need in this discipline. Adopting an embedded case study design and a participatory approach for fieldwork, the data were mainly gathered from 27 semistructured interviews focused on GIS students' and educators' lived experiences of university assignments and their reflections on various aspects of IL in a master's degree GIS program jointly delivered by universities in the UK and USA. Each learning and teaching experience was treated as a unit of analysis. GIS assignments were found to be geospatial, technology mediated, subject free, and unique in requirements. Each characteristic uncovered a new facet for the concept of information need in GIS. Findings indicate that unless students have understood the multi-faceted nature of information need, they may fail to distinguish the various ways in which gaps may be addressed when dealing with GIS assignments. The context-to-concept approach proposed in this study can be of value to both IL researchers and practitioners who seek deeper insights into the nature of IL, especially those interested in the customization of generic models of IL to the actual needs of university programs.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://ojs.letras.up.pt/index.php/paginasaeb/article/download/2838/2595","https://irandoc.ac.ir/sites/fa/files/attach/article/actuality-determining-information-need-geographic-information-systems-and-science-gis.pdf","https://daneshyari.com/article/preview/1099163.pdf","https://maryamnazari.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/DIN-in-GIS-Final-paper.pdf"],"title":"The actuality of determining information need in geographic information systems and science (GIS): A context-to-concept approach","doi":"10.1016/j.lisr.2016.04.005","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.lisr.2016.04.005","venue":""}

The conditions of the spin waves nonreciprocity are: (i) breaking of the mirror symmetry of an array with respect to its plane, and (ii) complex structure of the array lattice. These conditions can be satisfied, e.g., if an array consists of at least two groups of strips (dots) having different thicknesses (heights). The largest nonreciprocity can be achieved if the static magnetic state of an array is antiferromagnetic, and the difference in the strip thicknesses is about two times. A significant dependence of the spin wave nonreciprocity on the static magnetic state of a strip array allows one to create magnonic crystals with reconfigurable nonreciprocal properties.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Nonreciprocal Spin Waves in a Magnonic Crystal with In-Plane Static Magnetization","doi":"10.1142/S2010324716400130","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1142/S2010324716400130","venue":""}

The previous installment in the discussion appeared in the June/July 2014 issue of the Notices and included articles by Keith Devlin of Stanford University and Andrew Odlyzko of the University of Minnesota. Those articles were preceded by an introduction that describes how the discussion came about and provides a list of previous Notices pieces on this topic, as well as citations to articles that have appeared in other publications. Since then, additional coverage has appeared in the media. On June 7, 2014, the BBC aired a radio story, “Are science and spying connected?”, by Gordon Corera. On June 5, 2014, Forbes online magazine published an article, “Mathematicians Urge Colleagues to Refuse to Work for The NSA”, by Kashmir Hill. Both the BBC broadcast and the Forbes article featured interviews with mathematicians, and the latter mentioned the Notices discussion. Other material has appeared on the Web. For example, on May 14, 2014, the International Association for Cryptologic Research issued a statement about mass surveillance: http://www.iacr.org/ misc/statement-May2014.html. Earlier, in January 2014, “An Open Letter from US Researchers in Cryptography and Information Security” appeared on the Web; see http://masssurveillance. info. Since November 2013, Tom Leinster of the University of Edinburgh has moderated a discussion of these issues, with a focus on Britain’s GCHQ (Government Communications Headquarters), in n-Category Cafe blog (http://golem.ph.utexas. edu/category/). As we have collaborated on organizing this discussion, we had the impression that mathematicians are hesitant to voice their opinions on this topic. We hope to hear further opinions on this important topic in the future. Unsolicited articles are welcome. Inquiries and submissions may be sent to notices-snowden@ams.org.

Postreinforcement pause values and the number of responses in successive intervals were not systematically related. The direction of change of these variables from one pair of intervals to the next revealed periodicities in that the direction of change varied more than would be expected by chance. A response prevention technique used to manipulate the length of time spent responding in an interval had little effect on the postreinforcement pause value of the next interval except when only a single response was permitted in an interval. This procedure tended to reduce the postreinforcement pause value of the next interval to an abnormally low level.","inCitations":["e1674df516cf819f506cda271557ed8686cfc6f7","e5439511be4a8bd0712d8db4466f8134648c1545"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Periodicities within a fixed-interval session.","doi":"10.1901/jeab.1979.31-345","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1901/jeab.1979.31-345","venue":"Journal of the experimental analysis of behavior"}

With regard to the clinical relevance of subcicatricial fat grafting, the actual changes after the procedure need to be understood and microscopically evaluated. Methods: Eight patients with alcohol burns, with an average time after burn of 12 months (10-14 months), who underwent subcicatricial fat grafting associated with rigotomy were selected. Skin biopsies were performed in before and 14 weeks after operation. The following issues were assessed: 1) esthetic-functional improvement of the scar, by using the Vancouver scar scale; 2) quantitative and qualitative analyses of cicatricial collagen; 3) immunohistochemical analysis of scar vascularization with anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) antibody. Results: When comparing the preand post-fat grafting period, a significant estheticfunctional improvement and, microscopically, a redefinition of the boundaries of the papillary and reticular dermis were observed, as well as quantitative reduction and reorganization of collagen, in addition to the decrease of the vascularization of the tissue through immunohistochemical analysis. Conclusion: The basic principle of the whole physiological healing process is to reestablish local homeostasis, that is, excessively intensified steps that lead to severe clinical changes. When subcicatricial fat grafting associated with rigotomy was performed, qualitative and quantitative improvements of the tissue were verified in this study. Thus, it becomes evident that this procedure can complement the treatment of cicatricial pathologies. ■ ABSTRACT","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://www.rbcp.org.br/export-pdf/1768/en_v31n3a15.pdf"],"title":"Subcicatricial fat grafting associated with rigotomy: a clinical and microstructural analysis","doi":"10.5935/2177-1235.2016rbcp0063","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.5935/2177-1235.2016rbcp0063","venue":""}

The performance of the system is evaluated using four measures: rates of slave and master actuators efforts as well as distances travelled by the slave end-effector and the haptic implement. Results indicate that when the haptic device moves within regions with higher isotropy index, the performance improves. In order to further enhance the performance, the master site is augmented by a clutch that is found helpful to increase the hand-controller dexterity.","inCitations":["47037a8ff349a69f5b5054ae1e6d5e119c4e3857","ea61f9b6bd0726fad5631049d0ca8cf78a47b8ef","355d461fd4da4b463356b858ff5cd7147aeb4052","49d5c8241a4c50e7c0639bf24bef6552cb5e55c4","1e9944c9773136f26c5c6e128c01a06321f432f2"],"pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-662-44196-1_21"],"title":"Performance Evaluation of a Surgical Telerobotic System Using Kinematic Indices of the Master Hand-Controller","doi":"10.1007/978-3-662-44196-1_21","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-662-44196-1_21","venue":"EuroHaptics"}

Defining a distribution in the case of deterministic functions is straightforward, based on measures of sublevel sets. However, the fields we consider are the sum of a deterministic component (nonrandom multidimensional function) and an i.i.d. random field; an attempt to extend the same notion to the stochastic case immediately raises some fundamental difficulties. We show that by “uniformly sampling” such random fields the difficulties may be avoided and a sample distribution may be compatibly defined and determined. Not surprisingly, the obtained result resembles the known fact that the probability distribution of the sum of two independent random variables is the convolution of their distributions. Finally, we apply the results to derive a solution to the problem of deformation estimation of one- and multidimensional signals in the presence of measurement noise.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://www.ee.bgu.ac.il/~guycohen/kcf.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2010.2103770","http://www.ee.bgu.ac.il/~francos/shahar_it.pdf","http://www.wisdom.weizmann.ac.il/~shaharko/projects/SampleDistribution.pdf","https://services.math.duke.edu/~shaharko/projects/SampleDistribution.pdf"],"title":"Strongly Consistent Estimation of the Sample Distribution of Noisy Continuous-Parameter Fields","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2010.2103770","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2010.2103770","venue":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory"}

Each sensor reports daily snowpack, temperature, and precipitation data to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. • Almost one-half of the inhabitants of the Northwest have access to cable television, with 1.5 million ' homes in 809 communities receiving cable. • The Western Library Network, a computer · system which catalogs over 3.5 million items housed in northwest libraries, supports 210 online users who make 700,000 database inquiries each month. The database adds 400,000 new titles each year. • At least 73 daily newspapers are published in the Northwest, along with over 270 periodicals scattered through the five states. We take most of these systems for granted, though we rely on them both directly and indirectly every day. Market research, political polls, environmental ~mpact statements, public hearings on local issues, the Freedom of Information Act, the pleth?ra of popular and scholarly periodicals, the videotape and compact disk booms are part of our economy and are vehicles for the information which shapes our economic decisions. · Yet we continue to lack a vocabulary or set of measuring tools to analyze this component of our economy. \"What's the difference between intellectual assets and labor assets? To date, economic theory has made little effort to distinguish between intellectual services and physical labor services ... \" Forrest Woody Horton asks us to \"treat information as a real economic good,\" to recognize that we have left an era of lab~r as a fundamental economic good, and of capital as a fundamental economic good, and are entering one where intellectual skill becomes the critical . ~ommodity and force in shaping productivity. ·What is the Northwest's \"capacity to produce and distribute knowledge-that is, to develop · its huma~ resource?\" Are we focusing public and expert attention on developing the region's intellectual and human resources? How would we begin to sketch an analysis of the Northwest's particular strengths and weaknesses? !he . ~egion c~ntains a number of great umversihes and pnvate enterprises with hundreds of thousands of skilled \"knowledge workers.\" We have seen that over half of the northwest'$ Page 8 RAIN Fall/Winter 1986 workers are in the information \"business,\" and must marvel at the sheer quantity of experience, wisdom, and value that represents. With only 3.5% of the nation's population, the Northwest shelters 5.5% of its.software firms (but only 2.6% of its computer and chip makers). We need to recognize the measurable economic importance of the region's intellectual resource. Thousands of northwesterners sell their expertise outside of the region: planners in Saudi ~rabia, agronomists in Nigeria, language teachers m Japan, teachers in California, authors in New '! o~k. How much of the world is craving knowledge m J.ust the areas of our region's greatest strengths; agriculture, forestry, energy extraction, and participatory government! As the recent Information Highways volume :evealed, the Northwest has developed a sound mfrastructure for the transmission of print, digital, and other information media. Microwave networks sat~llite links, transportation networks, and th~ basic soundness of our telephone systems provide the basis for a limitless array of information transactions. At the same time, much of our potential to develop an \"information economy\" remains unf~l~illed. Washington State University lacks suf~icient fu~ds to complete the on:.line cataloging of its very important library; the Montana Health Sciences Net~ork recent~y lost funding for a simple 1-800 phone lme to permit Montanans access to basic h~alth care information; the Idaho Regional ~ibrary Network lost its funding in July 1985. In a time of scarce resources, public agencies have ~lected .to place a lower priority on various mformahon services: education, libraries, and the communications infrastructure. The Northwest's corporate sector has also failed to respond to the basic economic tr~nds of the day. At the same time, some institutions are discovering that they can market their information products on the commercial market: Columbia Information Systems sells access to its on-line database of consu?'er behavior to banks throughout Oregon and Washington; the National Oceanic and ~tmosp~eric Administration sells a variety of mformahon services including satellite data oceanographic measures, climatological data, and many publications; Kaiser-Permanente Health Research Foundation sells access to its database of subscriber health data. When the region was settled by Europeans, at the dawn of the communications age, few people completed secondary school, and a handful attended college. A century later, over 75% of northwesterners complete high school (compared with only 66% of the U.S. as a whole) and almost 20% achieve college degrees (compared with 16% nationally). As the level of individual education increased, the ability of the average citizen to learn outsid~ of the academic institution began to grow, and the past twenty years has seen a tremendous surge in continuing and self-education by books, periodicals, \"in-service\" training, videotapes, and night classes. Most of us recognize that we have entered an era of what William Paisley calls learning work, when \"learning and working should not be separate but rather intertwined activities in both childhood and adulthood.\" As learning and working become one and the same, we will adjust our understanding of the northwest economy to recognize the importance of the information sector. Public policy considerations will incorporate an analysis of the contribution of each policy to the region's information industry. Support for basic education, for universities and training centers, and for economic sectors that depend upon knowledge processing and intellectual skills will increase. We can adopt the information age and make it our own, tailor it to our ·own culture and regional traditions, and build our economic future on the great foundation of valuable information resources we already possess. ti Fall/Winter 1986 RAIN Page 9 COMMUNICATING WITH A LASER Electronic publishing may revolutionize the business of nonprofit organizations STEVE JOHNSON & BETTY DURHAM Until recently the ability of the small computer as a word processor, no matter how sophisticated the software, has been limited by the quality of printers. Most personal computer users have been forceq to choose between speed and quality. Less expensive, but high speed, printers using a dot matrix process are great workhorses for businesses that crank out reams of financial statements. For higher quality work, more expensive and slower daisy wheel (also called letter-quality) printers, which imitate the impact printing wheel of electronic typewriters, have been available. Over the last several years the distance between the two types of printers has narrowed. Dot matrix printers have increased the quality of print (often at the loss of some speed), and daisy-wheel printers have increased their output speed. Then two years ago a new type of printer appeared, the laser printer. The laser printer, while not as fast as a dot matrix printer, is faster than a letter-quality printer, and offers a quality of type unsurpassed by any other printers for · desktop computers, and in fact challenges the domain of professional typesetting. Hewlett Packard was the first company on the market with a laser printer. Their product, the Lascrjet printer, selling more than any other, has proven itself to be a quiet (fewer moving parts, no impact devices) alternative to the· daisy wheel printer. Steve Johnson is editor of RAIN and manages CUE 's desktop publishing service. Betty Durham is a free lance graphic designer and desktop publishing trainer at CUE. Page 10 RAIN Fall/Winter 1986 But it is Apple's Laserwriter printer that initiated the desktop publishing revolution. The Laserwriter was the first programmable las~r printer. Postscript, a page-description language developed by Adobe Inc. in California, helps the Laserwriter reproduce full pages of text and graphics at 300 dots per square inch, over four times the resolution of the HP Laserjet. Pof?tscript allows the Laserwriter to treat characters as graphic clements. The instructions provided to the Laserwriter are made mathematical formulas responsible for precise shaping of characters. The size of the type is limited only by the size of the paper. The Laserwriter comes with 1/1.5 megabytes of R.AM and a half megabyte of ROM, that stores a library of fonts that can be reproduced in different sizes and styles using Postscript. And, most important, Apple already had the Macintosh, a computer whose potential as an electronic publishing tool was realized with the introduction of the Laserwriter. When first introduced, the Macintosh was thought of as a cute computer-a term one would never apply to an IBM computer. With a weird device to replace curser keys, called a mouse, the use of pictures (icons) instead of command keys, the Macintosh seemed to have no particular niche. It seemed too expensive to penetrate the home computer market, and too cute for the more serious business world. The Macintosh has several key features that make it a good electronic publishing tool. The high resolution of the Macintosh screen makes it possible to view and work with both text and graphics. It is easy to use. The mouse has more dexterity than the standard curser keys. When the Mac was first sold the only bonified printer for it was Apple'","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://pdxscholar.library.pdx.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1096&context=rain_japt"],"title":"RAIN: Journal of the Center for Urban Education","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

The structural, chemical, and transport properties of the composites are studied. Some Yb2O3 particles with microsize locate at the grain boundaries of matrix and others distribute within YbyCo4Sb12 grains as nanoscale inclusions. The combination of the “rattling” of Yb ions inside the voids of CoSb3 and the phonon scattering of the oxide defects results in a remarkable reduction in the lattice thermal conductivity. The thermoelectric performance of the composites is significantly improved, and the maximum figures of merit reach 1.3 for the Yb0.25Co4Sb12∕Yb2O3 and 1.2 for the Yb0.21Co4Sb12∕Yb2O3 composites at 850K.","inCitations":["bc98205c585e1c37b9eb49e803aeb415e44cc37e","cc46665701c48ba557604c795eb72c0e44d5f2ac","48a53f451dfb6d471de2a4d22453d10099f90692","1d5ce85bc2bc9281907f86b28c794e04d4333073","8dae6b3397e91c2eb0ecf3c43391b2b66d9624bd","a065edb2be1f11f65b8912d4341732d3c4b752d8","db6d641e958e534d6a127971cc55fb894e6a96bc","702fbf3eb1986b42bba879d3023e5cf5e06efd72","fb8043f2425f5e0033b2a0ffb5dfb9d2f3c625f7","bc9f40647a916bce65bd4cecc8ad4b8fe552b170","690149172b347dffd95c1d54ecb6a008f736d6dc","997174396bf268c165aa1dce0353e22667504a64","22717c3cec65b90305fbc068a19df499f2f1f199"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Synthesis of YbyCo4Sb12∕Yb2O3 composites and their thermoelectric properties","doi":"10.1063/1.2345249","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1063/1.2345249","venue":""}
