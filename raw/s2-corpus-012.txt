Thus far, the capacity for non-genetic adaptation of such euryplastic animals has only been tested at different levels of constant temperatures. If exposed to both constant (8°, 14° or 20°C) and fluctuating (daily fluctuation: 8°↔20°C) temperatures, the tested individuals reveal significant differences in heat resistance which become apparent within 12 h. G. salinus and I. balthica exhibit reasonable (meaningful) heat resistance, i.e., a positive correlation between the degree of heat resistance and the level of adaptation temperature (AT). Following a shift in AT (8° → 20°C or 20° → 8°C) the degree of resistance changes rather fast. This leads, under fluctuating temperature conditions, to diurnal changes in the degree of heat resistance. I. balthica also shows an endogenous diurnal periodicity of its heat resistance. In G. salinus, long-term exposure (2 to 4 weeks) to fluctuating temperatures [duration of temperature change: 2 h (Δ/2 h)] produces, during the day, a mean resistance value which coincides with the value obtained for AT 14°C-controls. This fact results from temperature-independent adaptation speeds (same after decrease and increase of AT). However, fast temperature change (ΔT/1 h) during exposure to fluctuating temperatures leads to a significant augmentation of heat resistance, presumably due to additional stress; such fast temperature changes are less well tolerated than slow fluctuations (ΔT/2 h). In I. balthica, low ATs are less efficient in terms of heat resistance than high ATs (great difference between AT=14° and 20 °C; small difference between AT=8° and 14 °C). In males, lowering of AT from 20° to 8 °C results, within the first 12 h, to faster loss of heat resistance than is the case for gain in heat resistance after AT increase from 8° to 20 °C. However, after prolonged exposure to the new ATs, completion of readaptation is temperature-independent. Under conditions of fluctuating temperatures (ΔT/2 h) resistance increases beyond the mean value (AT=14 °C). Further increase in resistance can be obtained through fast temperature changes (ΔT/1 h). In G. salinus, which occupies habitats with more extensive temperature fluctuations, the responses studied are less pronounced than in I. balthica.Zusammenfassung1.An zwei im Brackwasser lebenden Crustaceen, Gammarus salinusSpooner und Idotea balthicaPallas, wird die Abhängigkeit der Hitzeresistenz von konstanten (8°, 14° und 20 °C) und tagesperiodisch schwankenden Vorbehandlungstemperaturen (8°↔20 °C) untersucht.2.Geschlecht und Größe der Versuchstiere beeinflussen das Resistenzverhalten. Beide Arten zeigen neben einer sinnvollen Hitzeadaptation nach einem langfristigen Aufenthalt bei konstanten Temperaturen (mit der Adaptationstemperatur [AT] ansteigende Hitzeresistenz) eine schnell verlaufende Resistenzänderung nach einem AT-Wechsel (8°→20 °C bzw. 20°→8 °C). Dies führt bei inkonstanter Temperaturvorbehandlung zu tagesrhythmischen mit der Temperatur schwankenden Resistenzwerten. Bei I. balthica kommt eine endogene Tagesperiodizität der Hitzeresistenz hinzu.3.Nach einem langfristigen Aufenthalt (2 bis 4 Wochen) bei inkonstanten Temperaturen (Dauer des Temperaturwechsels: 2 Std [ΔT/2 h]) zeigt G. salinus während des Tages einen mittleren Wert für die Hitzeresistenz (der mit dem Wert für die AT=14 °C-Kontrollen übereinstimmt); dieser läßt sich auf eine nachgewiesene Temperaturunabhängigkeit der Adaptationsprozesse (gleiche Änderungsgeschwindigkeit der Resistenz nach Senkung wie Erhöhung der AT) zurückführen. Ein schneller Temperaturwechsel (ΔT/1 h) während der inkonstanten Vorbehandlung führt dagegen zu einer signifikanten Steigerung der Hitzeresistenz wahrscheinlich auf Grund hinzukommender Stresseffekte und wird von G. salinus schlechter vertragen als ein langsamer Wechsel von ΔT/2 h.4.Bei I. balthica sind niedrige ATs weniger wirksam für das Ausmaß der Hitzeresistenz als hohe (großer Resistenzunterschied zwischen AT=14° und 20°, ein geringer zwischen AT=8° und 14 °C). Eine Senkung der AT (20°→8 °C) führt in den ersten 12 Std bei ♂♂ zu einem schnelleren Verlust an Hitzeresistenz als im umgekehrten Falle zu einem Gewinn (nach längerem Aufenthalt in neuen ATs erweist sich das Ende der Umadaptation hingegen als im üblichen Sinn temperaturabhängig). Bei inkonstanter Vorbehandlung (ΔT/2 h) steigt die Resistenz über den mittleren Wert (AT=14 °C) hinaus an. Ein weiterer Anstieg der Resistenz läßt sich durch einen schnellen Temperaturwechsel (ΔT/1 h) erzielen. Daß eine Verdoppelung des Temperaturwechsels eine signifikante Erhöhung der Hitzeresistenz zur Folge hat, macht ebenfalls die Beteiligung von Stresseffekten wahrscheinlich, die von der Resistenzadaptation zu trennen sind.5.Bei G. salinus, der in Biotopen mit größeren Temperaturschwankungen lebt als I. balthica, sind die Reaktionen weniger stark ausgeprägt.","inCitations":["58bf8e3e51b564545bb924d6bf57c5172ce3438b","94c76652961a116c262640660daaa7ee31429349","ea4d9c4811d7adfb12034eab63a5927dc0883236"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Der einfluß einer Vorbehandlung mit konstanten und wechselnden Temperaturen auf die Hitzeresistenz von Gammarus salinus und Idotea balthica","doi":"10.1007/BF00347434","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/BF00347434","venue":""}

However, the temporal scale of inference was limited (22 months), which may inadequately represent fish movements and home range size at the lifetime (i.e., ≥50 years) scale. Therefore, we used otolith microchemistry to examine the long-term movements of alligator gar (n = 59; total length range 1152 to 2420 mm, age range 4 to 60 years) between the lower Trinity River and Trinity-Galveston Bay system. Strontium:calcium (Sr:Ca) concentrations were measured along laser-ablated transects from the otolith core (i.e., time at hatch) to the edge (i.e., time at capture) for fish collected throughout the system, documenting movements between the river (freshwater) and bay (saltwater). We identified two residence contingents among fish in the lower Trinity River that differed in prevalence across the system. Multiple logistic regression indicated that river residence, in which fish remained in the river over their entire lifetimes, was most common at the upstream end of the study reach (63% of fish). In contrast, transience, in which fish moved between the river and bay, was prevalent nearest the river mouth (82% of fish). Although our inferences from the otolith data suggest a somewhat greater degree of homogenization across the system than was captured via telemetry, our results generally suggest localized management of alligator gar in the lower Trinity River could be appropriate.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://www.seafwa.org/Documents%20and%20Settings/46/Site%20Documents/2019%20Journal/J6_07%20Daugherty%20et%20al%2051-57.pdf"],"title":"A Tale of Two Timescales : Using Otolith Microchemistry to Improve Our Understanding of Alligator Gar Movement in the Lower Trinity River , Texas","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

The highest concentrations ofplutonium were found in the marine sediments under the location where theplane crashed. The distribution of plutonium in the marine sediment is veryinhomogeneous and associated with hot particles with activities found up to1500 Bq 239,240Pu. Sediment samples collected in Wolstenholme Fjord northof the accident site showed plutonium concentrations, which illustrate theredistribution of plutonium after the accident. Seawater and seaweed samplesshowed increased concentrations of plutonium in Bylot Sound. The increasedconcentrations are due to resuspension of plutonium-containing particles fromthe seabed and transport further away from the area. Plutonium concentrationsin seawater, seaweed and benthic animals in Bylot Sound were low but clearlyabove background levels. All soil samples collected from Narssarssuk showedaccident plutonium with levels above background. Plutonium was very inhomo-geneously distributed and associated with particles in the surface layers. Hotparticles were found in soil with activities up to 150 Bq 239,240Pu. Varioustechniques were applied in studying and characterising hot particles, mainlythose found in sediments during earlier expeditions. These techniques includedelectron microscopy (SEM-EDX/WDX), secondary ion mass spectrometry(SIMS), and various synchrotron radiation induced techniques including microX-ray fluorescence spectrometry (SR-μ-XRF), micro X-ray fluorescencetomography and micro X-ray absorption near-edge structure spectrometry (SR-μ-XANES). The techniques proved successful in assessing the source of theparticles and their environmental behaviour. Overall, it can be concluded that plutonium in the marine environment at Thule presents an insignificant risk toman. Most plutonium remains in the seabed under Bylot Sound far from manunder relatively stable conditions and concentrations of plutonium in seawaterand animals are low. However, the plutonium contamination of surface soil atNarssarssuk could constitute a small risk to humans visiting the location ifradioactive particles are resuspended in the air so that they might be inhaled.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://orbit.dtu.dk/en/publications/thule-expedition-2003--studies-on-radioactive-contamination-and-particles(b1ca14f8-0a29-43cb-9c40-fbae58ce1e3f).pdf?nofollow=true&rendering=mla","http://orbit.dtu.dk/en/publications/thule-expedition-2003--studies-on-radioactive-contamination-and-particles(b1ca14f8-0a29-43cb-9c40-fbae58ce1e3f).pdf?nofollow=true&rendering=author","http://orbit.dtu.dk/en/publications/thule-expedition-2003--studies-on-radioactive-contamination-and-particles(b1ca14f8-0a29-43cb-9c40-fbae58ce1e3f).pdf?nofollow=true&rendering=vancouver","http://orbit.dtu.dk/en/publications/thule-expedition-2003--studies-on-radioactive-contamination-and-particles(b1ca14f8-0a29-43cb-9c40-fbae58ce1e3f).pdf?nofollow=true&rendering=apa","http://orbit.dtu.dk/en/publications/thule-expedition-2003--studies-on-radioactive-contamination-and-particles(b1ca14f8-0a29-43cb-9c40-fbae58ce1e3f).pdf?nofollow=true&rendering=harvard","http://orbit.dtu.dk/en/publications/thule-expedition-2003--studies-on-radioactive-contamination-and-particles(b1ca14f8-0a29-43cb-9c40-fbae58ce1e3f).pdf?nofollow=true&rendering=short","http://orbit.dtu.dk/en/publications/thule-expedition-2003--studies-on-radioactive-contamination-and-particles(b1ca14f8-0a29-43cb-9c40-fbae58ce1e3f).pdf?nofollow=true&rendering=standard","http://orbit.dtu.dk/en/publications/thule-expedition-2003--studies-on-radioactive-contamination-and-particles(b1ca14f8-0a29-43cb-9c40-fbae58ce1e3f).pdf?nofollow=true&rendering=cbe"],"title":"Thule Expedition 2003 - Studies on Radioactive Contamination and Particles","doi":"10.1007/978-90-481-2949-2_5","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-90-481-2949-2_5","venue":""}

Little is known about mechanisms of sudden death and the role of implantable cardioverter defibrillators.\n\n\nMETHODS AND RESULTS\nWe conducted a multicenter cohort study in patients with transposition of the great arteries to determine actuarial rates of implantable cardioverter defibrillator shocks, identify risk factors, assess underlying arrhythmias, and characterize complications. Overall, 37 patients (age, 28.0+/-7.6 years; 89.2% male) were enrolled from 7 sites. Implantable cardioverter defibrillators were implanted for primary prevention in 23 (62.1%) patients and secondary prevention in 14 patients (37.8%). Annual rates of appropriate shocks were 0.5% and 6.0% in primary and secondary prevention, respectively (P=0.0366). Independent predictors were a secondary prevention indication (hazard ratio, 18.0; P=0.0341) and lack of beta-blockers (hazard ratio, 16.7; P=0.0301). In patients with appropriate shocks, intracardiac electrograms documented supraventricular tachycardia preceding or coexisting with ventricular tachycardia in 50%. No patient with inducible ventricular tachycardia received an appropriate shock in comparison with 37.5% of noninducible patients (P=0.0429). Inappropriate shocks occurred in 6.6% per year, more so in patients of lesser weight (hazard ratio, 0.91 per kg; P=0.0168). Additionally, 14 patients (37.8%) experienced complications: 5 (13.5%) acute, 1 (2.7%) late generator related, and 12 (32.4%) late lead related.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn patients with transposition of the great arteries, high rates of appropriate shocks are noted in secondary but not primary prevention. Supraventricular arrhythmias may be implicated in the etiology of ventricular tachyarrhythmias; beta-blockers seem protective, and inducible ventricular tachycardia does not seem to predict future events. Inappropriate shocks and late lead-related complications are common.","inCitations":["b7beccb04637948bb6a6152006f75a91db4acfc0","f31028bd740e1cd47f23c238a2c8d2bb5bf0280f","070fe79e4baace2362944dd7c097961628698f92","53293e79e07c7415b3b1d613f1ff95b654990488","6465cbb28f9ad190b9c2853c54c924fba66e550f","0756d8125d153f22a21cd0a54214f4e9eb95f3fb","66252be7f62486d280c69b9ae750df3a68b52962","e198580567dfa89dbdaca64effc8c189ea4d9c1e","104818917b90df03d788a4f76c3dd840c3613cb9","3dfff8d946dfe92d3ed25abe1fe3e2f5e624fbd5","a2ffe87664141f2572267f8b0650e6d8982f828d","1985df98d0322c7ab1e409b21597a79b4614522c","2d109184b34292a1d1dd0b1cb5eb34393d5e7480","b6670fb0ecc36fc1c3ee9fe32b0ee59b91b5b081","946d4d20db1c3d9b5ab2819c9bc26e4aaf17526e","1d3f28447aa7044689904297844755ca45c4e738","5613db307f7dd29e06c2b4680e7fa6545f4be900","5a6c15c9666e76801f891bb3aa32e787c5056aa0","ead0d334569b810053da4660be3c79ccad4be281","f89dd3ff98d1911ffa28d58c2b6bce5a026bb8a2","3a051f96aa1094862d116ebca4564e588e4410a8","6e547a5cb90106d3dadfe18eb7e0c14e502464fd","133873decf16eac8c111bc47385b3eba4d32b86f","ed914f69baaf40d8beb99c60842cc3d68fc573d9","e072fc42c9355988c12f90784a0902f92f76d16f","aa817faab47f968abf34d85d26590d4d3e55d726","b44e8c9ed9741ebeffa53728e13294185bdb3c13","116bc1f166f8a5d12dbd86f4538fb0c3a94f3111","d4b656cb01e18a652adeb01bfb6dc4fa5f55e0fa","4ffc14403b804fd5a82c491f349b12dd77b7754c","35fe19882febe852bea39e03d5eeea95382c446c","f49efb19522ead8b54448b2ef1ca4b4fd42f39f0","748995d17423624d01f09fc390adadeeff071334","a43bcb854bc987ae31e078acceba518c14a135b6","e763c686bd0dd536394d5815069eac3b6276345b","2a0815f679b166c7ed9805e0220327b912434e90","0aecf578d9c3a5200cddc368cc71137c760f24e7","850fd6ae76db57bba821a9cb8556f3bfafb2b8fa","98963be3b02939523c6b69ed944625a1d34284b7","87f4c103e8354e5d598fe59279a054d7c6edf481","799a04b74d0e51d85636fa1fa56b25a3f24b3283","a044bd3dc94d3cdb5f8e34cdc8808b0ed26fa2f7","a233311b3b1403263275e5906162fb1c60cc2ea7","c62e5b22c889eb1019d02f0c637d665f05ac8074","0f5f0a73cfc4355da6b6e9ba228dd6d43fe2623a","bddba0a2bd693ee1b699746c3094897aceb7cb0a","fbdccf1852a45b59eee54bbe3a3adce4fe7ef77b","c718cf4a6214e389a718092d295ae9877c0c0f42","d1bbbb2b1fd35cf1437353b77be8574b570c0793","8e4028c894967cfdc042cf94060af47c8a798e39","ec2b39f1a4d827a205fbb327f6c36ccb141afc24","00385285262220dd9f41efd284f9643f609e664b","d35870851dbe9d05063ebbfb006055c732ec8274","94341c9285d2dc456727aa9f64bfed6c98bdd106","b8ffebaa1e0aa29e57ddee5df45071f4bf578494","5c0f6a270ae3405a4a3c9826176038a6652afa87","965108339851b6f092bf1fed93a0c2def52fa08f","b9fd746524cf571bfea3794901c844ab42b1fc26","19df754205fe5f0595ea538026f2df89ae21262c","b199d04812b18cc58e4fb417992baf3780f7a337","3e8b064bf3adcc81fd9cd7533a3416dcf6cad776","02f5350e9f35845a85a585c62105f98fb505935a","107e949bbffe10750468d13b02663b5bb03b6666","2e1fa99144f77a986286acbbc07ceb72251dd4d3","25c0e5365ebbc76f6f84454be213c1b6df1cdac7","478b08377ae8e7193208eb6ddf77f67a3363afcd","10263fbe05d4304ae9a233123d4a91bfd13ba212","5081d8d4192281a3af7558b5bd47e5013351ebc3","631e688ecb3d14f39517f1ceb579097ab33d00d1","bc1d7cab9398ba072bc181abb745a80f23ede17a","854824e64285807f2266abf221dee3be48282112","7a57fb284b4934a23a02ee1d2b85f2a1a52d41bf","6f68cc71593a9846c2f18a6a99dadd00fa3a064c","a9f33bd3328a7bb3519084161f2620358346d60f","dd98982f896005a18500b366549af734675f9ad1","6695b660639e7b697e4c77e6dd94c7e291ba3b52","5c9aa932cf07878f07b879de085079e3f6cbfa8d","6fd773e57fff9a04d449b0eabb823251f44636a4","c7d5db55949c69952ced39ae9ef44eb5122c98a2","c6da97a245a056a05ca67556197acefdc39e7a30","aa1a2d5854dc1101cea744137ea5de3a906e2ccf","98b249e515146544d9665b49b0d2baebcac5a191","da4f4894dd023925966fd5050fee1112cb223d02","bfb58f63530ec60990dd8699a48b2855ade94c52","a58e7208a60c749bf3e84691d0d315199e558842","2a894d7cd3fae116ba879ac12e7142dc193e9b96","92326417676d2fe06663389b6b2e769216b1099b","140188b80743f8925159104255540b5e8e575327","30b8bffc197bbce8d20fb213972e0442f30b80fa","ac30246582c88c3114a80be3442e9e7a61d4b7f3","edd32ca61899c21a701fcd365dbf8234cf4f2d49","fca61ec431ca689e6c047b520a7a68bd2ae69165","0a1d49c3a29f9402df0ea2d70341d2776c268ed6","5793d4d887e69b2715c5746d5f24f7c799bdbbc1","b181a9a66770d4abe22009f5219188e49a51d09f","1602124921cb2b35b88acf7d3d13e43af7275b97","8a64fe8dedf6885d5810bb6d31c6b41ae8098953"],"pdfUrls":["http://circep.ahajournals.org/content/circae/1/4/250.full.pdf","http://circep.ahajournals.org/content/circae/1/4/250.full.pdf?download=true"],"title":"Sudden death and defibrillators in transposition of the great arteries with intra-atrial baffles: a multicenter study.","doi":"10.1161/CIRCEP.108.776120","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1161/CIRCEP.108.776120","venue":"Circulation.

Results of specific phlorizin binding were correlated with measurements of maximal transport capacity, carrier affinity, villus height, and enterocyte birth rate determined by the metaphase arrest technique. Animals diabetic for 14 days (acute) and 60 days (chronic) were compared with age-matched controls. In the jejunum, adaptation occurred only in chronically diabetic rats and consisted of a 10-fold increase in the density of phlorizin binding sites in the upper villus region (i.e., that portion normally transporting glucose), while in the ileum, adaptation occurred both in acute and chronically diabetic rats and consisted of 1) a 3-fold increase in density of phlorizin binding sites in the upper villus region of acutely diabetic rats and 2) an increased density in the upper villus region as well as the recruitment of phlorizin binding sites in the mid to lower villus region (i.e., that portion not normally transporting glucose) of chronically diabetic rats. Enhancement of glucose Vmax and villus length accompanied changes in binding, whereas enterocyte birth rates were similar in each group.","inCitations":["8727c1d44d7a981a921443c120b930e328ffd502","4b053527e250836ba78ca13d0090c35634638242","c8d30c8d6426fa4888dad2732e2dfedf9e304474","61c507561c1a2a8d14bf699646979887f908e8ef","657dc8a4fe09b6984cd87660a8de03da85d8b4f3","b96e5a5c8ca24b6ae46c790c7f2480d3fd433441","2ac76fb7d0a4bb38dd7be2930fb593f7708fe22f","a45c01fbdba6abe2f772f6965cc1d46e4ff4e450","8eaa7a27d53932b2b03542fda86ca1d6f0a795c6","e15107955a21847ff8141ed78879270b290ddc38","3d5b84572598b349518013dce0fbc4214121dc3b","a971cc564c0a52062ae189221e40cb5b45a8e988","75c2fedb10a21b5cc8f60459bebca0d1603b5ec9","58774d7ec2987d9059d80c7ce64c4b723dfe7f24","97dfafb2d216797d42d2e920702639152ac8700a","a6a4edf3d980e1b17381bee787217947f8f1b994","e4083013e83a05cdf013f66492bc4edde9321157","3f5b792681db317f3d2ed36e73e73c8f70d07a76","80663569f1b3884e29e50203d537d0e74e869b7d","f82c07895cd569ac377f2455984abe4eaf153a92","83feb55c48fed1189183a54f2f092fe20617e788","9d9768591fe9eac109ef230ce691ebf54f1417db","c89a385fa61ecfa6f4bae521c264a6fae235df1e","891cb1b0d8d0cb1409fcc8788ad87134c3ce5e7d","aea8ca4ed9acd99170c92e1f58589c4f2a4174cb","466620afbfa6b2bf48802ef00e1335a602add551","ef0f467f7b0dfa1d84df749684b8df1622b8b0a7","0a265c6f7224fdc878073ccdbc2240fd374b2ded","faf454ea1cacab529506c533413a8b788ee8e5fb","a5a2acc5f1b2dabbf3f29a992f3f8d892db7dd17","13fb1ec96a53efdbddf3e52ad0b31c273a578aaf","cf62f4b03c4f26acde0ff81743c779c66db43f7d"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Altered glucose carrier expression: mechanism of intestinal adaptation during streptozocin-induced diabetes in rats.","doi":"10.1152/ajpgi.1991.261.4.G585","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1152/ajpgi.1991.261.4.G585","venue":"The American journal of physiology"}

Recent discovery of atomic-layer superconductors and self-assembly of magnetic molecules on solid surfaces should allow one to create a new two-dimensional (2D) hybrid superconducting system, but its possibility has never been fully investigated so far. Here we report the fabrication of highly ordered 2D hybrid superconductors based on indium atomic layers on silicon surfaces and magnetic metal-phthalocyanines (MPc) and clarify their detailed structural, superconducting and magnetic properties. Our primary findings include a substantial controllability of the superconducting transition temperatures (Tc) through substitution of central metal ions (M = Cu, Fe, Mn) of the molecules. This is attributed to charge transfers between the magnetic molecules and the superconducting layers and to different degrees of exchange coupling between them, which originates from anisotropic distributions of the relevant d-orbitals. The present study opens a route for designing and creating exotic 2D superconductors with an atomic-scale precision.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://arxiv.org/pdf/1608.06688v1.pdf"],"title":"Two-dimensional atomic layer-molecule hybrid superconductors with controllable exchange coupling","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

This policy has faced many objections within the society due to the fact that the students are promoted from one class to another without having acquired the competences proposed in the curricular plan. The main objective of this study was to analyze the tension and challenges of the evaluation in learning cycles in BE in Mozambique. The methodology used was based on bibliographic and documental survey. The research concluded that the necessary conditions for the implementation of the progression politics in the learning cycles in Mozambique were not created. Therefore, it is necessary to improve aspects such as policy dissemination, schools functioning conditions and teachers’ education, so that formative assessment can be applied effectively. Keywords: Basic Education.

The conveyor and V-block of specific structure were designed with photoelectric switch detection function to realize self-adaptive tool delivery. Besides,a kind of gripper was developed that made the different tool axes stand in the same position after grasping,which ensured that all of the different tool ends could quickly locate to laser marking area. Moreover,using the rapid moving of gripper,a photoelectric switch was adopted auxiliary focus to improve the speed and precision of focusing. Under the support of the three key technologies above,the whole design of project was completed. The test results of prototype prove that the self-adaptive laser marking technology increases the marking efficiency of more than four times compared with that of the traditional way and ensures the marking quality reliably.

Epigenetic modifications including DNA methylation are now accepted as being responsible for a wide variety of human diseases including cancer and autoimmune disorders. Although technical advances to study methylation have evolved, the success ultimately depends on the quality of the sample being used. While the isolation of gDNA is relatively simple, most clinical samples are formalin-fixed and paraffin embedded (FFPE) and it is well known that this process introduces crosslinks in the DNA that can irreversibly modify the sample. How formalin fixation and degradation affect our ability to detect methylation is still fairly unknown. \n \nThe Nucleic Acids Research Group (NARG) study evaluates how fixation and degradation affects the detection of DNA methylation using several analysis methods. Mouse breast cancer tissue was used to generate gDNA from matched source tissues that are both flash-frozen and formalin-fixed paraffin embedded. The resulting gDNA will be assayed using conventional methylation detection methods including methylation sensitive restriction digest coupled with qPCR, methylated CpG island capture coupled to microarrays or next gen sequencing. Results discussing differential methylation detection are presented.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"NARG 2011–12 Study: Evaluating DNA Methylation Profiles Across Degraded Samples.","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Incentives, along with coercion and persuasion, are among the ways in which some people get others to do what they want them to do. This paper analyzes incentives as a form of power in order to develop criteria for distinguishing legitimate from illegitimate uses of them. Whereas an economic approach focuses on voluntariness as the sole criterion in judging incentives, this political approach yields three standards: purpose, voluntariness, and effect on the character of the parties involved. The paper explores issues that arise in applying these standards. Framing the problem of incentives as a problem of power reveals the ethical issues with greater depth and complexity than placing incentives in an economic frame of reference.","inCitations":["6961291eaa04d073055fe3bc2870a359f8f10e43","1b4ebb96cecb1dc1c24e1e00a8b9333ee08c5741","1f636e8957b90ba75e71928805ed31f9ab73b023","807206e65fd50761ac72bc2e641f51a649b51327","92c68be7cbf0207e6e5ba215a17b9202f9587d04","49e410f9ca1525388adaa6875d50aab9b072cfcb","e337a47a8114a4cd0f55d3f3868072446ec122df","4f553747f5af3eec43faccb0a0ce6ff2a45ed701","398ff92cb4b5abc38466b014e69ddce9c3c9df58","0a78af6c7c746f5918c5dedd4783c9e2cf07a5b0","8d2d9c6ff1d42cd7ab4b233b209a2b0333be71cf","064fc557edb0adf4a46b1d090149656a598b8928","b964d8a72813673707ba13c0a7872390e5e09572","6eb36fd94bb83ca39dd10cef8dcedc7cffadd74e","aa21a1465c01af31058a4de44225983c37d71abd","ce056c0af6c25b88a4d02b69437f7ff15788c447","5dabd3a868746bce629215bba53bb8e63875091d","6687daea0701d0aa523709687f6ab67eb56876fc","89271b7ec10394be311e31bd9d61f828eba144dd","028a35beb2a4d0fd2ffa1e168b4d1f582a90eac1"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Ethics and Incentives: A Political Approach","doi":"10.1017/S0003055406061983","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1017/S0003055406061983","venue":""}

Because concentric left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy is a strong marker of the severity of hypertension, the influence of LV geometry on the age-associated decline in renal function was assessed in 195 normotensive subjects and 645 patients with never-treated essential hypertension with an average duration of 30 mo. According to LV mass and relative wall thickness, hypertensive patients were divided into normal LV (NL, 48%), concentric remodeling (CR, 19%), and concentric (CH, 22%) and eccentric (EH, 11%) hypertrophy. GFR and effective renal plasma flow (ERPF) were estimated by isotopic clearance technique. GFR and ERPF were inversely correlated with age in normotensive and hypertensive subjects, and no marked influence of the BP level or the presence of LV hypertrophy was detected. However, the slope of the regression line of GFR versus age was accentuated (P < 0.01) in patients with CH or CR (slope values of -0.95 +/- 0.11, -0.86 +/- 0.14 ml/min per yr, respectively) when compared with patients with EH or NL (slope values of -0.58 +/- 0.16 and -0.58 +/- 0.08 ml/min per yr, respectively). No such results were obtained when creatinine clearance was considered. Urinary albumin excretion was higher in patients with concentric or eccentric LV hypertrophy than in patients with concentric LV remodeling or normal LV. These results demonstrate that in never-treated essential hypertension, the age-associated decline in GFR is markedly influenced by the concentric pattern of LV response to hypertension rather than the level of BP and/or the presence of LV hypertrophy.","inCitations":["dd88d21e89bd943ccca6f5aef2c22c711f0a2687","139b46a84b60ec5df33b0fea5b5c62d8e4227843","7dddca2c6e586a25d2757ffbb65e0c29a9147f8f","32bd2fb012a916c341351019ed3a0027ad8fba82","881a60e322260c4c63eba6ce44faded81164fd8b","12daca3196c135f234edd2b202636a37f84a4ffb","19dc993e44b7b933f4e326f7211ef67c31d34c79","3f5a5322ea423db78be5cb18a7fa2346b1f84126","8fc14f4b6378180cc40caa6f43375df876319d56","622a213a86c5eb6f33083b92faf57a1be3563799","770eabf17645f97377ea76428a592cf23d60bba4","50786395ce4520f327da6e44f06bd39bd2465b24","5b441fefb780e244e7152602b17c8c319fbc9ee8","58822219a6ed8f7f4af15a707c32309c2c3b4998","d86d5c40a6a712ab8b791c21e4e85eaa50583421","ea4e65f8b163d033cf6df287569b504ae559cd9f","0bcb53ee4986f162c8d0fb64c718e4f8431f1e23","b8c20de31e6cce21685116baab0613dc58f97a06","5a3cc96086c51e756859a59818670d615270224d","e825e33765c9d4c8dba31c6aae7ff76ed8377316","21ecaed40c7fc9922dbea97499e98b6bc8bb3f29","a3271fd2121b5743e96f9e3054d3d884211136c6"],"pdfUrls":["http://jasn.asnjournals.org/content/14/4/881.full.pdf"],"title":"Left ventricular remodeling and renal function in never-treated essential hypertension.","doi":"10.1097/01.ASN.0000057855.93268.9F","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1097/01.ASN.0000057855.93268.9F","venue":"Journal of the American Society of Nephrology : JASN"}

In the most straightforward calculation, the bare ionic species (the tert-butoxy anion and the hydronium cation) are placed in cavities surrounded by a dielectric continuum, using a dielectric constant corresponding to the state point. A second method is first to solvate these ions with a small number of explicit water molecules and then surround this cluster with the dielectric. This is the cluster-continuum approach. We discuss the advantages and disadvantages of these two schemes and we also discuss various ways in which the second method can be implemented. No method showed quantitative agreement with all available experimental results but the first, straightforward method was the most successful in predicting the correct trends.

The action of alpha and beta radiations was studied by crushing glass globules containing radium emanation in doses of 4 to 10 millicuries directly under solution of 2% Mercurochrome in water and immediately stoppering tightly the 10 cc. vials of the solution. The effect of gamma rays was studied by placing vials of Mercurochrome solution in juxtaposition to large quantities of radium. The irradiations of solid Mercurochrome crystals was performed in the same way. The pharmacological and bacteriological properties of the solid crystals after irradiation were studied by making a 2% solution of the same. Bacteriological studies were made in the following manner: Cultures of B. typhosus were used; the method of studying germicidal action was the so-called Hygenic Laboratory method. The temperature of medication was 20°; the proportion of culture and disinfectant used for making dilutions were 0.1 cc. in 5 cc. Subculture medium was also that of the Hygenic Laboratory method. Quantity used in each tube was 10 cc. Temperature of the incubator was 37°. Various dilutions of the drugs were employed. Time of exposure of the culture to the action of the disinfectant was in one series of experiments 5 minutes and in a second, 15 minutes. Control experiments with unradiated Mercurochrome solutions from exactly the same stock were made in exactly the same way. It was found that when solutions treated with the alpha and beta radiations were examined within 24 to 48 hours, there was a slightly increased bactericidal activity shown after 5 minutes exposure to the disinfectant. This increased bactericidal property of the solution, however, disappears after a few days.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Effect of Radium on Pharmacological Properties of Mercurochrome.","doi":"10.3181/00379727-25-3824","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.3181/00379727-25-3824","venue":""}

Fluorescence intensity ratio (FIR) via thermally-coupled energy levels (TCELs) of one certain lanthanide ion is most adopted method to measure temperature. However, there is an inevitable dilemma in this method that large energy gap (EG) of TCELs is required for gaining highly relative sensitivity (Sr) while small EG is needed for achieving highly absolute sensitivity (Sa). Meanwhile, the EG of TCELs cannot exceed a certain value for achieving thermal equilibrium. To solve this issue, in this work, a new strategy based on synergistic luminescence from Ce3+ and Tb3+ codoped in SrAl2Si2O8 (SASO) has proposed for obtaining highly sensitivity over a wide temperature range. FIR of Ce3+ to Tb3+ in this self-referencing and dual-emitting phosphor shows remarkable contrary temperature dependence and has well fitted linear relationship, owing to resonance energy transfer (ET) from Ce3+ to Tb3+. Meanwhile, the emitting color of the phosphor is gradually shifted from blue to green with temperature, which means it is also potential candidate as colorimetric luminescent thermometer. These results could provide useful inspiration for designing stable and highly sensitive optical thermometer based on ET induced by synergistic luminescence.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Thermometer of stable SrAl2Si2O8: Ce3+, Tb3+ based on synergistic luminescence","doi":"10.1016/j.jlumin.2019.116807","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jlumin.2019.116807","venue":""}

Acyl-containing lipid extracts, transmethylated in the presence of a reference penta-decaenoic acid (15:0), yielded fatty acid methyl esters which were analysed by gas chromatography. Mean (± SEM) fatty acid content in samples of pig oocytes (161 ± 18 µg per 1000 oocytes) was greater than that in cattle (6 3±6µ g; P < 0.01) and sheep oocytes (8 9±7µ g; P < 0.05). Of 24 fatty acids detected, palmitic (16:0; 25‐35%, w/w), stearic (18:0; 14‐16%) and oleic (18:1n-9; 22‐26%) acids were most prominent in all three species. Saturated fatty acids (mean = 45‐55%, w/w) were more abundant than mono- (27‐34%) or polyunsaturates (11‐21%). Fatty acids of the n-6 series, notably linoleic (18:2n-6; 5‐8%, w/w) and arachidonic acid (20:4n-6; 1‐3%), were the most abundant polyunsaturates. Phospholipid consistently accounted for a quarter of all fatty acids in the three species, but ruminant oocytes had a lower complement of polyunsaturates (14‐19%, w/w) in this fraction than pig oocytes (34%, w/w) which, for example, had a three- to fourfold greater linoleic acid content. An estimated 74 ng of fatty acid was sequestered in the triglyceride fraction of individual pig oocytes compared with 23‐25 ng in ruminant oocytes (P < 0.01). It is concluded that the greater fatty acid content of pig oocytes is primarily due to more abundant triglyceride reserves. Furthermore, this speciesspecific difference, and that in respect of polyunsaturated fatty acid reserves, may underlie the contrasting chilling, culture and cryopreservation sensitivities of embryos derived from pig and ruminant (cattle, sheep) oocytes.","inCitations":["8238af080e4204206f4fd7607377f961af3ed422","0be9cc2452aa10244b3808509d80fd7fb01757e9","5f9d0ec410d465ae02592e25e1d6fb6b1d39878f","b7a58a0aa0cafe8f602397d0e625d87012898998","4450b34b18496f3768be74443d272b781e5f940c","75803d16b8d6013600e750b1721ced6620ccf875","848d62e126c2f92b87a832aa7e4b2e52159db5b8","770b2a80c9b2202e99a871de87d2928418ac93dc","9d79690abdda12eaade61967e470f2ec9698e375","0d16538efb3af44244479edcd2cccecab8153b0c","b4db23b417f7617c99240a7f7264c1ef087f7db9","663d4c0bb012ee0283401bb4982af76f6f754346","ee3c94a6481ac170cde0370ba4810d10a4ee8375","6fdb40db33b9973063f627495a61a5afd418b980","2eccc1fd51f5c5d4d559aa561ed61bd994555661","9d2ac741f07824a4cfdce025d32d38de8b75f171","b8c4fce09957b843949891fe2eca64706e35591d","ce7f525e67315522885dce2dab683de2737aa3d4","c304984c96cb2f20b59247af01928c23907fd698","873b03187f990306b20c7aeabee1c2596c382662","03fca458deb25c844915cabfd483f769d315a4e9","aec23fa66b0c966aac2fad1c69b2cfe1ca52ccde","13de9e0b9bbea72ecaefaa8d49999512a941984f","b9220395a41a3f5a0d43e37a54ccafca2a288503","e67c91e14aa492f6bfddfe40bbe538d8d6b961d5","521259dd79b5757a19d0bff4906d96bea761f9b2","6dae61fbd1f7dddb647241dc679e21e2f5d366ad","a257c1ef2e27b29fe8fd8e91044fad649cb4ca91","6f2bce14689ee8ef30ee521c570d6b5642e0acd3","0a848b978d02ca2d91a05e5fad15cde66b99675b","a5123e78c8f405540939fd2177c2eca1dee27041","0c6c983961343a2714c47c0af9719b795c71ebd2","8f9b95e225a1fa742a38a833e0c6799574d7dc3f","7dc309d492815d068245645f87a3073a826d82b2","86c48557d2e62229007aeb1108e5cc9a267357f0","42762eca0bfb07b38ff8c372a3d25bea63c9c508","1da6f51af2856e31c7d0b2e0c1fe804a7eb9f8f6","566d60380ee567e7d84b56cd705d802acdc6a6f9","a0912957190f659e0187bf0ae433df41fdae315d","d14621b7e377284d9a805642914e05b6e8232983","c91d410a356f3935f09e70a7297cb76d367675fe","32cb8cee2bcbe3c77e82c06e2f04c884f550b5ff","f802f30b00a870d0046d6ef0474bb8fb3d66714a","1792fcf1d0fc302cf16a2fb72d650f67909ece1e","ddfd19d65b829966803d82728c63273896042ca5","c8e7fbedd2bd0a970263dfde84d05b3bc9058a36","05975be0634b7627921abb2b9c994e34ad902b3e","0a97f83ca52cfcba00f96d74a142257a1467c0be","aeb709ee5981fe0da7816218b56ff74cebf8fbe7","b872aca6af3a382c5468c090f1f6d0f72879964e","488177d573b4d043d2f731c3cdaccd8376e65909","2df6672736252d7d9cd3bef0b020d32dbce86711","b758e1a7c87f9f5e685cc26655619d0877cc76b4","2341c70dc4b88691a23552bc2bf2e8b9efa8226f","e0593bfdd817b9677dd6a02da37d037a1b98403e","6e74d41e7519c23a855d03b4c53db86a9f08a00d","82b41cfc4814ab1cbef256b318b4917872298da9","160c92bfb6138b890b9994e6df643d72fbe2ca01","9d95477f3f6695d2858ce41789e218cd854be706","419b38c6441c85b7ae16a886156d925ab982a9d1","9e62868bfdb8158ae9c7d533a2c355fafb412c80","906c2b3639001b9d25d5cc14bf8f841d69aa5b52","dd1da385f3f05897a21b78044e8ddd53f8ca235f","b3c1cfbb9f8f5ae72bc6c7a895b736ab12491c47","a6efcde5105dce22fe3de6ba725d9581dc0ad523","6df7111c2924c1c4b734e77e29f0984cad435c0b","7a2de78f3d1f50014e0d7bd3e0bbfbb3e16d3e80","cfc640cb394e11913a1304ab267d88669095862d","d3e7d3b071c28072c61925b7a69be32b1143a505","59c0c15142cd4b7cb002f3787e5422c7ff10ba36","c6fd9d307fec176561809d349b942d45480aae9c","3b1d52adf840ebeba2ee119fa02ccbfeaa4ff5e9","a8be3c5c206f2e1bc934ed2f458aa28ee48358be","5fde438a48cb143a02bca151d57f1a1fecdc6057","d7fd1b736944169c7cbe2fb4b69b25c63da3013a","3a8556f54be889c5638d26c0276aa5deec8737e5","d932d95c146dd17c6ba70fa62a4172b68002ea4e","1f1170c1f2239b63e2ec8c048453141506d090a5","744056ad87dc4d8232d5e1b02b27cebc02d205e2","14c64ff83eb4c84c3d2cdb039f79e2081a224829","89fa4cae579362a756626524239d151f134781c9","21092ac1906c9220bb9405e2cf335428918a30cd","0f9f0179fadba34cc59448bcffc6843c39fd191a","948140fd317bbe928b0a6a8d928f3803e381ecbd","aafaa5493bada12df7783d150a1aafa204066084","cacb99f4edee8a4f80c7fc6b50e39a0b12d147af","6ad61f2493375fe3ed587d6849664291c73c565e","49940eb1aad86dd0398694eb662d1c6a14bf79c4","4cc9cd9bdfab9467e8992c6ba8d57280b2b08571","14bd65e9f306e6e555ff428863f16ec3893c15e9","630c5a34a96e187ea83aa8496ce51c1832ba226d","af30899ff24d7fd3b17c49c7b0a7134ae904fb95","3d83df07a088c2faa20f9e187cec3221594ff88c","a4bf3f0ca358509f97268e78d3adb96871c3e49e","d3ab8addce6d4ec18933a04808ed4d152d24ced1","60f57410587364629f7d16beacd6ba7c1a83c263","75245692eb8744ff72f3fc337a826af0b1561b43","5e2fc709cf88333cfd61544b4ee2df41db3aacd8","dd8bca3ebf7f07201094afd7e171d9188f8b438f","d9b5d1ad5bea83d1c7ed91d8f0e323b30b3072ce","a403cfc91cb0dcfb67005b65f8494a7ac96ff671","e8e34ee20de688974a85fc7745822379afd8aed2","5110ee3fed8fdeb0b89612a56d8e4d89540ab410","be6c29d3d80b12fbef9e35fd7a34874092ce80c5","11bce6fa5bfb2ae9e883d76532f8bf9f902f4f6c","60521e1f48bf5d3f830dd1528273bd569ab1d726","d14886e7719fbd8a3ef6dcf5d3a9c46c25573437","330db3a3ebdfdce6fa53b81370efb3b193a78eb0","1ac3de2519cd82cc4a0dfeaf61d552c8bd255463","add925ac592a410c09e2b1aa6e5f369890a636c7","74e5d1d5d5dff1b296cce49b664716d78d89e7d1","e522e03f740d5d189e7212569a1c1444726bd8f6","854f99698b5aade1f128671c7e6a885d7a8c0aae","a054751e120ee2e9b033bad838c9a576eb929a70","e9c5b737fcbe7db0c5440d343fae24f3ea2e0189","49da63d099e7965e68008e8659308

The study utilizes partial weight bearing therapy (PWBT) followed by epidural spinal cord stimulation (ESCS) with the assumption that both treatments would be necessary to elicit a well organized, near effortless functional gait with a walker. Function is defined in terms of accomplishing task-specific activities in the home and community.Objectives: To demonstrate the feasibility and benefits of combined PWBT and ESCS therapies aimed at promoting functional gait in a wheelchair-dependent ASIA C SCI subject.Setting: The Clinical Neurobiology and Bioengineering Research Laboratories at Good Samaritan Regional Medical Center, Phoenix, Arizona, USA, and the Department of Bioengineering, Arizona State University, Tempe, Arizona, USA.Methods: The study began with the application of PWBT. The subject walked on the treadmill until a plateau in gait rhythm generation was reached. Subsequently, ESCS, applied to the lumbar enlargement, was utilized to facilitate PWBT and, later, over-ground walking for a standard distance of 15 m. Gait performance was analyzed by measuring average speed, stepping symmetry, sense of effort, physical work capacity, and whole body metabolic activity.Results: PWBT led to improved stereotypic stepping patterns associated with markedly reduced spasticity, but was insufficient for over-ground walking in terms of safety, energy cost, and fatigue. ESCS with PWBT generated immediate improvement in the subject's gait rhythm when appropriate stimulation parameters were used. When compared to the non-stimulated condition, over-ground walking with ESCS across a 15 m distance was featured by a reduction in time and energy cost of walking, sense of effort, and a feeling of ‘lightness’ in the legs. After a few months of training, performance in speed, endurance, and metabolic responses gradually converged with/without ESCS at this short distance, suggesting a learned response to these conditions. However, at longer distances (eg, 50–250 m), performance with ESCS was considerably superior. The subject was able to perform multiple functional tasks within the home and community with ESCS.Conclusion: We propose that ESCS augments the use-dependent plasticity created by PWBT and may be a valuable adjunct to post-SCI treadmill training in ASIA C subjects. We also conclude that ESCS elicits greater activation of an oxidative motor unit pool, thereby reducing the subject's sense of effort and energetic cost of walking.","inCitations":["4af766b6eda4673bae5016464df0a74920e8aaee","c543e96afeed715d4e665aacea7c9a11a5d03301","5c160a81acaf26ca34e2cab2950ea4c277abbcf1","85ca9a529d3e79ddf4194546ec42abee414d2f80","d2d3578b4039f2d0aa724324b9d200fed7c4567d","d43d4172b9d8135ffe7e19d3287c1fbf5fc81572","32b82688f75d4230ce867c4c4fa1b2811bfdf0ec","a75a79992bf5d1acfd3c8c025aa55bec2126fe25","00858ce110b070f4d8354512c86f16ca451bc312","5532115d8581be796d47eb53e75fb4325b2ed5a6","8998411aa59464516b905e8142fb786fce1b7a13","51a0c9bea047d2202ace263b6dd36ee4518e5a15","2c466566baaf6b69c5838a65c211278703c1d5ac","b59aadc569ba8f0677c21a6c8b23afe1f4ff6e8e","294637d1c918adb747abd0ce41fd7d4ac8e67aa9","039c210b02cd6151cc3165f2e25a825867c14c46","d98be02d06bec0c52000b5a2c1f2c61dab85a265","7b7c3a95821a68e07beb1feb4717c0e6b439e9f1","6c8488078ba46d4a5ab584e0bfd929af02a6038a","5e9d4aeae07864a3e7db70f91b1ab9681f2956a8","c633a29cdd0c50c98ec409fcdaee139c28808d1e","af45a7cfd7366b0ff87fac27872f18aa47eefd46","764d1b69baafae96213dc0e7fe9ec49f1909cc2f","e5d459acc65d1af22cb54709d336d66afa9537b2","6e831c84089992e08f03b039997ab6572cd51e95","221a6c12b9d69ee5885b896e90131e9378ad5461","c907ca82366aadc1318b351848d56787ff9b43d3","99cfd4d7db19556d03cc6c422d0aeb6063aa316a","2e5b44b9b75c230839c8f558d66a7a0ee2ff3418","f98250bad67ad0c8c74b99002108554d9b2312d3","2be1e7ba568e05e44df193ef006500eef59c4fb8","e7f367f00e2bf65988c17b095279fe0c2ffd09c1","a8a22b1711e43003f9bfe5121828a6235da3a618","d4289fa88ac8f7fbe33d5b2456f4c4deb41fa2bc","7d9c74fe020d271e866797b81505d7a1fe25d9d4","c080ad9ea737e5c8a73e4057c494b58ec9c6f20f","48ad3c41a267f305a3be2e9b29d610a7ea3198b4","f4168bfb4075066037ca16a0998572428a7682ad","20023ecdcde494e188f8853c922c4f466f035c95","54c57c35bf25fa6a40016bd03717bb919a900ec3","703e46d8fe2487c04e1e935f63193d3216984790","260b4513e22cbfd33cfee12d95f206fb0dccd420","5857186e23fc0a19d6a8085b6b468f510994c56f","1116ba334594ccd593580e71865a16bcd5fdcd6d","3fd751a5b23bdf05819c838c07919238637a3263","75b43ea3fe6970bcbb3399b9b32b06d536f5563d","398256903202a70bc179b034e80bb7b01f1b448b","ab09ad12d519d8cedc7d3b75503ca38e1e5b6e19","b6cd8b6cd1f8927631cacfe893cdb6042444d888","5cd834651b57d14cf0f74bff608bf8769afcbe9f","a74a5d6e84082d03465bc683c1e0a2ac6395854a","e91b0ebd82ff01b06e21d28c7fd633cdb1c4625b","4708291b81ac56204e510a21e259527d09de4e78","dfb2663dfb30263370ae25d87ce1cce5b19849f8","8c65c4b1b74eddd3dd6b1d7d303521a8c7d5806c","118537ad61728bf4fbef5245d58a216b046f4178","ea0d729258c8c3f71c2a36a9b07068eadc0bcaa7","2bfca3ecb3a3dcda4af2036f774e96249f0d3277","f3684c0763ce9ebe5cff9c2421beb6bd87837c6d","f09e329d994db739d0a5401305829b2feb38f8b4","94e3c0fb5aa250871f7d8089d1838900f8c2d35c","f9828c65fbe63a31e616edde3cef4b51bc26ac36","40a9786eea876cd01b3fa1119b9c5ba05c6e05db","4eec9d6de22e6fb4625befabae51c6eb8ed5124e","8e30f7c5c02e2db35447e4199badf1fe228dd448","3a7a2860aabe95e68ae84ebe141eae4c103d8f5b","44aefe795e89b51c7b10daeb7917ae8d125326a7","0c72019a5e728bc36a3107edbb7dd90118a6ef4f","a06bd10a537b4d532b95e6af399bf4dba8ac2695","9247006ccd7ace1ce41c4ed3bd65743c9634c59b","1760f07db9a2dcb10d10b7db5b6104646f675884","25345ed4663d26ef989d1fe0fa7212de0ed217f1","c21e4ffcb881fb2eb1908e49bbfb923ab6aeea9f","12a1cda31bbb26ccf63f456f06ae8661e6bab6e9","126996ba6bb118a1fb0da7990f746fb66aab9228","9a6a6b04bfed2ad6e11dbd5e01781a23f264c068"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Spinal cord stimulation facilitates functional walking in a chronic, incomplete spinal cord injured","doi":"10.1038/sj.sc.3101263","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1038/sj.sc.3101263","venue":"Spinal Cord"}

These findings highlight the strong role family plays in human capital development and occupational choice.

This review focuses on the use of artificial peptide strands to assemble inorganic complexes that are redox active. These approaches toward macromolecular assembly use varying oligoamide backbones and assembly motifs that grew from earlier reports of single oligolysine or proline chains containing pendant redox species that undergo photoinduced charge separation. Recently, peptide nucleic acid chains that form double-stranded duplexes analogous to DNA by hydrogen bonding of complementary base pairs have been modified to contain metal complexes. In these structures, hydrogen bonding and metal coordination combine to form crosslinks between the PNA strands. Finally, a family of structures is described that is based on an aminoethylglycine scaffold with pendant metal coordination sites, but without intervening nucleic acid base pairs. These structures form multimetallic complexes that are either single- or double-stranded, or that form hairpin loop structures. These motifs for using artificial peptide strands for self-assembly hold electron donors and acceptors in relative positions that provide structural connectivity and permit electron transfers between linked metal complexes. This is a new approach for creating polyfunctional redox architectures that could ultimately enable the construction of potentially large and complex molecular electronics devices.","inCitations":["b32104b04875381e7eae155c12f36fdc3b933794","04b6b60e8e7577db8d5590de55167cb8f4dc037b"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Directed self-assembly of inorganic redox complexes with artificial peptide scaffolds","doi":"10.1016/j.ccr.2010.02.018","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ccr.2010.02.018","venue":""}

Kink-jump and reptation dynamics are used to move polymer chains under a driving field where they deposit onto an impenetrable attractive wall. Effects of field (E), chain length (L(c)), and the substrate size (L) on the growing surfaces are studied. In low field, the interface width (W) shows a crossover from one power-law growth in time (W approximately t(beta(1))) to another (W approximately t(beta(2))), before reaching its asymptotic value (W(s)), with beta(1)( approximately 0.5+/-0.1)<beta(2)( approximately 0.6-1.0). For short chain lengths (L(c)=4), the saturated width (W(s)) is independent of the substrate length (L), while for long chain lengths, W(s) decays with L before becoming independent at large L. W(s) depends strongly on the magnitude of the field: for short chains, W(s) approximately E-delta with delta approximately 0.4, while for long chains, it varies nonmonotonically with E.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://aquila.usm.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=5313&context=fac_pubs&httpsredir=1&referer="],"title":"Characteristics of driven polymer surfaces: growth and roughness","doi":"10.1103/PhysRevE.61.1793","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevE.61.1793","venue":"Physical review.

This has opened a new field for LED applications, resulting in significant advantages over conventional light sources and creating some application challenges unique to LEDs. Conventional lighting methods provide little guidance for LED thermal problems since these usually involve a very high temperature source, such as a filament or an arc, and radiant heat transfer dissipates the thermal energy. LED junction temperatures are limited to much lower values and hence the heat transfer system cannot depend upon radiant energy transfer. This means the cooling methods for lighting now shift from primarily radiation to conduction and natural convection, and this paradigm shift lighting designers must recognize when moving to LEDs. In this paper, the development of a LED-based spot module heat sink in a free convective cooling system is discussed. The rationale for choosing a cylindrical tube, longitudinal fin (CTLF) heat sink is shown, as is the performance of five different configurations of the heat sink in various orientations. The requirement for using heat sinks in various orientations comes from lighting applications, where the light may be installed in various directions, such as vertical up, vertical down, horizontal, or at almost any other angle. Heat sink test results are plotted for Nussult number versus standard and modified channel Rayleigh number, showing a similar correlation to the parallel plate heat sinks investigated first by Elenbaas. A different correlation for the isolated-plate limit section is proposed for CTLF heat sinks, as well as a proposed area of operation on these Nu-Ra curves for orientation-insensitive heat sinks. Finally, explanations for the different levels of sensitivities observed in different areas of the Nu-Ra curves are offered.Copyright © 2003 by ASME","inCitations":["e8fc0d0015a9a78e7f5eedc0af6f36d2bb43cd35","523d656ca892ccbbed723f9e04866fb743471864","7a5bf27a950d553902d73f7547ca460bf467e267","343f683a466101dbc4d424583c98a48514dc50a4","8400515a3e6e186709b2b4eb7ed47fa8c22a754f","a7de8c3db235fb491fc7e83b547c8e428093e724","041171da2eec750f74b5e0c3bfc2f310fe4e4c69","f598ad8e8269ce769b80bcedb6d87186b439aa91","6b5d34031d260ca6d37d420dd986032aa73c52b8"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Understanding Longitudinal Fin Heat Sink Orientation Sensitivity for Light Emitting Diode (LED) Lighting Applications","doi":"10.1115/IPACK2003-35055","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1115/IPACK2003-35055","venue":""}

The radiative corrections to this process receive enhancement from the large Bloch-Nordsieck-Violating Sudakov logarithm, log(2Mχ/MW ). We resum the double logs and include single logs to fixed order using a formalism that combines nonrelativistic and soft-collinear effective field theories. For the wino case, we update an earlier exclusion adapting results of the HESS experiment. At the thermal relic mass of 3 TeV, LL′ corrections result in a ∼30% reduction in rate relative to LL. Nonetheless, single logs do not save the wino, and it is still excluded by an order of magnitude. Experimental cuts produce an endpoint region which, our results show, significantly effects the higgsino rate at its thermal-relic mass near 1 TeV and is deserving of further study.","inCitations":["21c2ed7aac26fd63fc9fdb11861dc095f5ac5549","53f736d79b04a99c1cb8b3bafe3667627d3fc3a8","787ccadc165b966bc2209bc2fcde9105e5b5fa17","09a580f6be7534490b79d4c63b0c657969461aee","334bd341154a863905449c414b9ba97f17af2005","f46747f66d4509a447bb8fa54a7ba2de4be41430","4734cbac6a5554d8f378ae9af210dcc7843a042f","fd5af85e8d7320fff6e93c699334a48945470c02","406b021f76d81d9262e9725ce0055c5492ee99ed","fc50a1d9d5aac21c582ee6164f4177cf9f0a195b","4e3118900a3bfbe8d1c831a3b0773ae0c2f6c69b","ac07079735ec6ca5c1d05f42d51010921fce0f21","18052555bbd6b01fd35b7eac41afda31e58f5b7a","6957732349e5f1af83106c892aec8fc649b4c07b"],"pdfUrls":["https://arxiv.org/pdf/1510.02470v1.pdf"],"title":"Semi-inclusive wino and higgsino annihilation to LL′","doi":"10.1007/JHEP03(2016)213","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/JHEP03%282016%29213","venue":""}

Loosely coupled component-based approaches have already been proved to provide a very flexible support to address heterogeneous and widely distributed environments, but at a cost of decrease in overall performance, due to the component layer. As such, this approach, suitable for coupled grid applications, might seem not to be directly applicable to develop non-embarrassingly parallel applications In this paper, we present extensions to the collective interfaces of the EU CoreGRID Grid Component Model (the GCM), to support advanced multi-point component interactions at different coupling levels. We also present the usage of these extensions on a component-based runtime that supports an SPMD API. This API is specified in the context of the DiscoGrid Project, which promotes a parallel SPMD programming approach with new concepts of advanced hierarchical and collective communications, specific for the development and execution of domain-decomposition scientific applications in grids. Experiments have shown that the introduced extensions can provide very flexible and scalable support to develop grid applications. The results obtained with DiscoGrid Runtime and the Poisson3D application are also very promising as they show that the combination of the hierarchical SPMD programming approach and the component-based Runtime can lead to high performance grid-aware scientific applications.","inCitations":["2c19b785fb9490991df88ec0698d7ec132f6b92b","16a6a145140cc6f4b8404844ca49be1b0f594bca","a2452e733c7c32bc5d1cb28da53a0abd37db4435","0ddddb2c7a1a6949c475eb0fbaeff3008239fa44"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"A GCM-based runtime support for parallel grid applications","doi":"10.1145/1456190.1456193","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1145/1456190.1456193","venue":"CBHPC '08"}

In this study,the effect of commonly used pharmaceutical compounds such as caffeine, ibuprofen, aspirin, and tetracycline has been investigated by the toxicity assay using Daphnia magna. The acute (48 h) and chronic (21 days) toxicity assays have been performed using Daphnia magna. The lethal concentrations of caffeine, ibuprofen, aspirin, and tetracycline with 50% mortality (LC50) have been determined as ∼445.3, 91.5, 310, and 90.8 mg/L, respectively. In the chronic toxicity test, low concentrations such as 1%, 2%, 10%, 20% LC50 of the pharmaceuticals were used to expose the organisms for 21 days. The effect of these pharmaceuticals on the molecular responses in the organisms has been studied from the gene expression level of five different biomarkers in Daphnia magna (Dhb, Vtg, Arnt, CYP4, and CYP314) after 48 h and 21 days exposure to the testing pharmaceuticals. The results show that five genes show different responsive patterns when Daphnia magna was under stressful conditions caused by caffeine, ibuprofen, aspirin, and tetracycline. During exposure to caffeine, only the response for the Dhb gene increased in the acute test, whereas all other genes, except Dhb gene, were down regulated in the chronic text. In contrast, in the acute and chronic toxicity test for ibuprofen, the responses for Arnt and CYP4 genes were reduced, respectively. Moreover, after 48 h exposure to aspirin, all other genes, except the Dhb gene, were down regulated. In the chronic test using tetracycline, five genes expression of D. magna were affected.","inCitations":["4cac57ddf056039761e04498fc12f310ceef036c","af23adc3b37916795863fffbf7414a4b68592824","54b5938f653b0934715962cdc84e489a88e04c50","972badc885655c04c62c2349ff044c55c37b8723","f7a750e3511a9fb4580f1c1a76fd38129d0316f4"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Acute and chronic toxicity assessment and the gene expression of Dhb, Vtg, Arnt, CYP4, and CYP314 in Daphnia magna exposed to pharmaceuticals","doi":"10.1007/s13273-015-0013-7","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s13273-015-0013-7","venue":"Molecular & Cellular Toxicology"}

Although chemotherapy has been widely used to treat patients with HCC, alternate modalities to specifically deliver therapeutic cargos to cancer cells have been sought in recent years due to the severe side effects of chemotherapy. In this respect, aptamer-based tumor targeted drug delivery has emerged as a promising approach to increase the efficacy of chemotherapy and reduce or eliminate drug toxicity. In this study, we developed a new HepG2-specific aptamer (HCA#3) by a procedure known as systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX) and exploited its role as a targeting ligand to deliver doxorubicin (Dox) to HepG2 cells in vitro. The selected 76-base nucleotide aptamer preferentially bound to HepG2 hepatocellular carcinoma cells but not to control cells. The aptamer HCA#3 was modified with paired CG repeats at the 5'-end to carry and deliver a high payload of intercalated Dox molecules at the CG sites. Four Dox molecules (mol/mol) were fully intercalated in each conjugate aptamer-Dox (ApDC) molecule. Biostability analysis showed that the ApDC molecules are stable in serum. Functional analysis showed that ApDC specifically targeted and released Dox within HepG2 cells but not in control cells, and treatment with HCA#3 ApDC induced HepG2 cell apoptosis but had minimal effect on control cells. Our study demonstrated that HCA#3 ApDC is a promising aptamer-targeted therapeutic that can specifically deliver and release a high doxorubicin payload in HCC cells.","inCitations":["6e5a0f9f641b81d177327af6893ee6488ffff86d","fa39d48d072026b498f19fd5fd460d0f786de67c"],"pdfUrls":["http://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/pmc/7d/62/pone.0147674.PMC4726709.pdf"],"title":"ssDNA Aptamer Specifically Targets and Selectively Delivers Cytotoxic Drug Doxorubicin to HepG2 Cells","doi":"10.1371/journal.pone.0147674","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0147674","venue":"PloS one"}
