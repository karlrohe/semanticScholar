Anaphylaxis is a clinical event occurring when mast cells and/or basophils are activated to secrete mediators with vasoactive, smooth muscle spasmogenic activities, often through a pathway involving allergen, IgE, and high-affinity IgE receptors on the surfaces of these cells, but sometimes through non-immunologic direct activators of these cells or because of genetic disorders that increase the activatability of these cells. Clinical and laboratory parameters are used to increase the precision with which anaphylaxis is diagnosed, and an increasing variety of interventions are designed to mitigate acute anaphylaxis or to prevent future episodes of anaphylaxis. However, unmet needs remain, particularly with better diagnostic tests and treatments of this condition, as well as a more complete understanding of what determines anaphylactic severity.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Anaphylaxis and Its Management","doi":"10.1007/978-3-319-30835-7_42","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-30835-7_42","venue":""}

Given the paucity of research in Canada, a study was undertaken to explore nurse executives' understanding of the key concepts and strategies associated with patient safety and quality improvement, and their engagement with patient safety and quality improvement in their hospitals and healthcare systems. This study used an exploratory qualitative design with a content analysis approach on 20 nurse executives working in hospitals in Ontario. Three key themes emerged from the narrative data set including: (1) being a strategic and system thinker while possessing the emotional intelligence to influence staff; (2) building credibility and relationships with point-of-care staff, board of directors, and leadership team and (3) creating a culture of safety and high reliability. Study findings can be useful in informing future learning opportunities for nurse executives and nurses leaders at all levels to enhance their quality and safety literacy.","inCitations":["ec4ec34f7f41cfb8feaab7bdac97dd539a13ca24"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Attributes and Actions Required to Advance Quality and Safety in Hospitals: Insights from Nurse Executives.","doi":"10.12927/cjnl.2018.25606","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.12927/cjnl.2018.25606","venue":"Nursing leadership"}

Selective fluorescence acquisition from SMC was guided by direct image visualization of the vessel walls. A maximal constricting concentration of AII (10(-8) M) caused similar abrupt and sustained increases in SMC [Ca2+]i in afferent arterioles (AA) at 80 mm Hg and efferent arterioles (EA) at 30 mm Hg. When lumen pressure was reduced to 0 mm Hg, 10(-8) M AII caused abrupt peak increases in SMC [Ca2+]i in 15 s in both AA and EA, which declined rapidly thereafter--patterns distinctly different from pressurized vessels (P < 0.02). With diltiazem (10(-5) M) in the bathing media, 10(-8) M AII caused an abrupt rise and decline in SMC [Ca2+]i in AA, but a sustained elevation in EA (P < 0.02). In low-Ca(2+)-EGTA media, there was an abrupt peak and rapid decline in SMC [Ca2+]i to 10(-8) M AII in AA and EA; the abrupt peaks were attenuated by the prior addition of dantrolene (5 x 10(-5) M) to the low-Ca(2+)-EGTA media. When half-maximal constricting (EC50) AII for AA (4 x 10(-11) M) was added, there was a slow, progressive increase in SMC [Ca2+]i that was distinctly different from the abrupt peak and decline with EC50 AII (5 x 10(-12) M) in EA. Collectively, these findings indicate that maximal AII stimulates both Ca2+ entry and storage mobilization in AA and EA; EC50 AII stimulates primarily Ca2+ entry in AA, but storage mobilization in EA. Lumen pressure modifies the AII SMC [Ca2+]i response profiles.","inCitations":["d98632ee44ae981d0c54cd4ce37d105749e6ef15","461d1c17ef89e00bb77d2a131cca80ff4db4b7c7","da1719148aec7132f965901a63de3698513cb622","c6855f3e268d2116c038c1f312d948780019fc41","01a7210f53432fcf8fdbada56bc48c78021f4799","977883294f34397e8bceea47bf7025fd1094a77b","56a59e2d028776ed59ff0297892605e48fde271b","29ca9ddf3eb082ff2e90c8f40dbf66d75c0534e2","3bf6134e9f1b483c28785c98f9e8681d1bbe31ea","c3bd8fff94bb9d9b6885aedde33947f74ca92be9","af7306860fd8d1dd5bf3a5cb226672fd911047d8","6aedff65c1f0f36306043e6de322965be40c8582","120345e9446bda0b72c44a6d0d6332c58427c8c5","d5745361bd82bc15a32dbf6f6e74bf6c1aafded4","9093faec756778c4e055f01eb68a0cfe94d1ce86","89563422c7578ae096fd000354327b16413cd146","d825d62afc08e504506c4797fefaf841daa0ae8f","525f104e7d3be7c5d90c3bc7d478ca4c030587f0","8c05e0c44a1d135b8b1ea862a5601ac75e418fc3","2c6dfac7054ab334588697645cb33a82029af5c1"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Angiotensin II-induced changes in smooth muscle calcium in rat renal arterioles.","doi":"","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"Journal of the American Society of Nephrology : JASN"}

inflammatory disease caused by multiple factors in early lactation or dry period. Genome wide association studies (GWAS) can provide a convenient and effective strategy for understanding the biological basis of mastitis and better prevention. 2b-RADseq is a high-throughput sequencing technique that offers a powerful method for genome-wide genetic marker development and genotyping. In this study, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the immune-regulated gene correlative with mastitis were screened and identified by two stage association analysis via GWAS-2b-RADseq in Chinese Holstein cows. We have screened 10,058 high quality SNPs from 7,957,920 tags and calculated their allele frequencies. Twenty-seven significant SNPs were co-labeled in two GWAS analysis models [Bayesian (P < 0.001) and Logistic regression (P < 0.01)], and only three SNPs (rs75762330, C > T, PIC = 0.2999; rs88640083, A > G, PIC = 0.1676; rs20438858, G > A, PIC = 0.3366) were annotated to immune-regulated genes (PTK2B, SYK, and TNFRSF21). Identified three SNPs are located in non-coding regions with low or moderate genetic polymorphisms. However, independent sample population validation (Case-control study) data showed that three important SNPs (rs75762330, P < 0.025, OR > 1; rs88640083, P < 0.005, OR > 1; rs20438858, P < 0.001, OR < 1) were significantly associated with clinical mastitis trait. Importantly, PTK2B and SYK expression was down-regulated in both peripheral blood leukocytes (PBLs) of clinical mastitis cows and in vitro LPS (E. coli)-stimulated bovine mammary epithelial cells, while TNFRSF21 was up-regulated. Under the same conditions, expression of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), AKT1, and pro-inflammatory factors (IL-1β and IL-8) were also up-regulated. Interestingly, network analysis indicated that PTK2B and SYK are co-expressed in innate immune signaling pathway of Chinese Holstein. Taken together, these results provided strong evidence for the study of SNPs in bovine mastitis, and revealed the role of SYK, PTK2B, and TNFRSF21 in bovine mastitis susceptibility/tolerance.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://fjfsdata01prod.blob.core.windows.net/articles/files/450729/pubmed-zip/.versions/2/.package-entries/fimmu-10-01579-r1/fimmu-10-01579.pdf?rscd=attachment%3B+filename*%3DUTF-8''fimmu-10-01579.pdf&se=2019-08-24T09:32:39Z&sig=01lxF9gGlVBm0dkfrxbOGmtP8PIJGJPXSASsZFSnKEE%3D&sp=r&sr=b&sv=2015-12-11"],"title":"Three Novel Players: PTK2B, SYK, and TNFRSF21 Were Identified to Be Involved in the Regulation of Bovine Mastitis Susceptibility via GWAS and Post-transcriptional Analysis","doi":"10.3389/fimmu.2019.01579","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2019.01579","venue":"Front.

A concern of many is the possible detrimental effects of whale‐watching boats on humpback whales; including the possibility of damage to their auditory system. To address this concern, the noise generated by five different types of whale‐watching boats was measured, two with outboard engines, two with inboard diesel engines, and a seagoing vessel, in the near shore waters of west Maui. The first series of measurements was conducted at the peak of the whale season, and the boat noises were partially masked by humpback whales’ chorusing (boat noises and whale chorus levels were on the same order of magnitude). A 1/3 octave band spectral analysis indicated whale chorus levels as high as 136 dB re: 1 μPa with no whales in sight. Throughout the day humpback whale chorusing noise was present at similar levels for miles along the same coastline.

Spontaneous variations in temperature of up to 97 K, downward drifts in temperature of as much as 40 K after peak temperature has been reached, and increases of up to 154 K as a result of reprocessing have been observed. These effects are generally much smaller with the heat-shield assemblies. The 60 K range of the heat-shield assemblies implies a variability of more than 4 to 1 in life and performance. The ranges of the older assemblies imply a variability of from 64 to 1 to more than 1000 to 1.

CD45RA is expressed on pre-B and B cells, and a transition from CD45RA to CD45RO defines differentiation towards plasma cells. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from patients with myeloma included a large subset of B-lineage cells (mean of 39% to 45%) that were CALLA+ and PCA-1+ in all patients studied, including newly diagnosed patients and patients undergoing chemotherapy. Southern blot analysis indicated the presence of monoclonal Ig rearrangements in PBMC and a substantial reduction in the germ-line bands consistent with the presence of a large monoclonal B-cell subset. Avoidance of purification methods involving depletion of adherent cells was essential for detection of the abnormal B cells. Phenotypically, this abnormal B-cell population corresponded to late B or early pre-plasma cells (20% to 80% of PBMC), as defined by the concomitant expression of low densities of CD19 and CD20, moderate densities of CALLA and PCA-1, and strong expression of CD45RO on all B cells, with weakly coexpressed CD45RA on a small proportion. Heterogeneity in the expression of CD45RA and CD45RO within the abnormal B-cell population from any given patient suggested multiple differentiation stages. Abnormal B cells similar to those in MM were also detected in MGUS, although as a lower proportion of PBMC (26%). Abnormal B cells from patients with MGUS expressed predominantly the CD45RO isoform, but had a lower proportion of CALLA+ and PCA-1+ cells than were found on B cells from MM. This work indicates that the large subset of circulating monoclonal B lymphocytes from myeloma patients are at a late stage in B-cell differentiation, continuously progressing towards the plasma cell stage.","inCitations":["a37334470a5076831961c9cbba8a591d54b2c86f","b32996811889c59a7ed48517ce85115d044d43ad","905f2f8087fbcc60feab8a7284cbfe3842056450","1262e5829080a5785b0202fb601b9c6eaebb8ea3","e902d94710bcf45db34463ed97ed3fdb38190c11","862857479fc891c2e2f0dac943b66893346aef6b","81facd80ab23d82f203dbd3e7c8d5bfd4cb63c5d","46460749243830c16230bd8f9c0adbb1fe8bcae5","935ee1e9e99640b537f0f3c0677f9ad1f05afef3","82f8ea833c48f5dc7f3b97a38abcb66683b64caf","bd51a15e15b62206807bf91c6acdc8dbd658ec1e","cfe97b826759b5a0d488ebf3656af1e92045c911","b456ec337c1b1bfe8b2e7c1a921bfbe8420076f2","ada78211044a61fed3ef749a7b175afeb9bcb4bd","cf60178d7c5beaa4d0589594140c7db6e2ce7833","6562c0ae8c2cd3abd6793e995643338c0397679a","e39374e8f62cac29ff3a9db429bd81c5079b4352","614e7d90663693e7b3e631940fe48ad29f3e1ddc","3714957d8e1b5194294450d564294a30429100f3","b5a906c4fa03053d0036e645bb7c3dc8b57f2df6","293d15bce2821289defef14dde407818bcca7c28","fba771cb13aa3ffe8abc46b8fa6230d8df286c17","d8a18ab162e00f79d4c39281dbe654e207023bfa","a4229d01b5c7637b29820e109389f99fe5d2db73","e237fe84372d30e716fcc6f88c37a2fbc85cf46a","285d89b1bb729c1ab09d6473b2ef306eb9d45dc2","7cd51d7e3eb73fe847e20c2244e50ed93f34e38b","9a0395602590a7b5d37165e7a7fcf062a7c4c94b","51aafe8d1c2070f9119f1b6d262a830ef48884d8","c1288a7e1a34b993049a19249de263726227dc11","126f561f5232002408b638cc1a0f3ba5cbc10af6","247605707e8b27cb07b941ff935b8319a3aa9865","ef2dfbf83ffa013905586fe8f6b2d3d51ae39889","aa29b5e20185a471d1d4aac89692bff6464df5f9","1a60f62b6942b6ab93ce1aabd3c9c44035990979","25c9e31cf132f85621c092dff8d651669933e49d","6901d9a8309a1ff1b4bdacb175c1b6380eba2be5","fb26e1c99ac9576b70ce627158009bb0fe4e6ecc","1619d2d909ef18b91bdeaf30eb7eb71b7115ee75","935f3005e4d306c8cb510bf901c07e60ae57fb19","9e7fb4e4d2eb4755cbcd7f54e6dcd60465cbf052","9d87859e02d186a724f621bb9a10af173d334088"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Selective expression of CD45 isoforms defines CALLA+ monoclonal B-lineage cells in peripheral blood from myeloma patients as late stage B cells.","doi":"10.1182/blood.v78.3.711.bloodjournal783711","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1182/blood.v78.3.711.bloodjournal783711","venue":"Blood"}

After working on both assignments for 10 minutes, significantly more students chose a new experimental assignment for homework. Individual analysis showed that 85% of the students preferred or chose the assignment associated with higher discrete task completion rates. In Experiment II, students completed both assignments. Results extended previous research by showing that even after expending more effort to complete the 20% more target items plus the additional interspersed items on the experimental assignments, significantly more students chose an experimental assignment for homework.

The color difference caused by sunshine exposure was minimized at an acetylation level of 20% weight gain (WG) with a rapid decline from 10% WG, even though the exposure time was prolonged. Weathering led to early disintegration and enlargement of bordered pits, extensive separation of the latewood tracheid walls in the middle lamella and checkings oriented along the microfibril angle of the S2 layer. These characteristic patterns of cell-wall erosion due to weathering were essentially the same in both untreated and acetylated wood. However, scanning electron microscope observations revealed that more extensive microscopic and macroscopic checks leading to distortion of the cell alignment appeared in untreated wood and wood which had been treated with a low-level of acetylation. For highly acetylated wood, severe intraand intercell wall erosion was limited, and the original cell alignment was retained. However, after long-term exposure to natural weathering, the surface celllayers of acetylated wood were defibrated separately and were attached to the unexposed cellular structure beneath them. This may explain the observation that acetylated wood has more severe surface-contamination than untreated wood, in which the new cell-layers appear successively because of the severe erosion of the exposed surfaces.","inCitations":["93db02c8168443d534ac0d26979c53a8e5d27c2b","2fea7459399a1d3526b12797b45d6d88ae5f8d36","3909835d9528b3ae8561dbe6dd66e594e2d261a6","bc8a154a43fc62175ef6da282cd6fcedf7a6ea17","ce2cb3630a4a9046d785d0871ec244d0f85f40a6","cb9350ae5d862384ff34522a0434643cb6cec969","cb5bdabc9df854ee5fc81af3df72259dff04a606","45ed6d1cca1fb33088e9395afe78e38c691cb017"],"pdfUrls":["https://repository.kulib.kyoto-u.ac.jp/dspace/bitstream/2433/53259/1/KJ00000017921.pdf"],"title":"Morphological Changes in Acetylated Wood Exposed to Weathering","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

It may occur in the early or late posttransplant period and can promote sometimes severe morbidity. We analyzed our data regarding HC in allogeneic HSCT patients in order to establish the efficacy of hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) therapy in severe HC and to document the main problems during its use.\n\n\nMETHODS\nBetween March 1993 and August 2006, 161 patients received allogeneic HSCT. Mesna, hyperhydration and forced diuresis were used as early HC prophylaxis of cyclophosphamide-induced HC. However, HC was diagnosed in 49 of the 161 recipients and 17 of them were considered as severe HC. We analyzed their data retrospectively.\n\n\nRESULTS\nForced diuresis with hyperhydration (up to 8 L/day) and transfusion support to maintain a platelet count above 30x109/L were sufficient in 10 of the 17 patients with severe HC. Alternative therapies used included intravesical irrigation with formalin and prostaglandin (PG)F2 alpha and HBO, and HBO appeared to be the most useful among them.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nWe conclude that HBO offers a noninvasive therapeutic alternative in the management of intractable HC in the HSCT setting.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://www.journalagent.com/tjh/pdfs/TJH_26_4_176_180.pdf"],"title":"Hyperbaric Oxygen: an important treatment modality in severe hemorrhagic cystitis after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.","doi":"","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"Turkish journal of haematology : official journal of Turkish Society of Haematology"}

Visit Chiesi at Stand D.30 MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 26TH 2011 identified (9.086 persons), as well as a control group matched for gender and sex (1.013 persons). The civil registration numbers have been linked to expenditure held within the Municipality of Helsingoer. The included expenses are Dansk Ambulant Grupperings System (DAGS, ambulatory visits), Diagnose relaterede grupper (DRG, hospitalizations), Sygesikringsudgifter (SSR, health insurance), Retirement home, Rent subsidy, Health visitor, Home help, Transfer income, different kinds of Aid, Supplementary fees. Subcohorts having more than one of the three examined Lifestile Diseases, fx COPD patients with comorbidities, were dealt with in a Shapleydistribution and a risk adjusted distribution. Subtracting the cost of the control group the additional consumption within one year per person with COPD were 11.678 EUR, with Diabetes 8.136 EUR and Cardiovascular diseases 6.017 EUR (2010 figures). The Government share of the expenditures was 50,6% and the Municipality share was 49,6%. The economic burden of COPD will be discussed in relation to the Municipality and the total public finances in Denmark, and the economic incitaments for prevention will be discussed in relation to the relative expenditures. This study was approved by The Danish Data Protecting Agency and The National Board of Health in Denmark. 1682 Cost-effectiveness of tiotropium versus salmeterol: A trial-based analysis followed by a model-based extrapolation Martine Hoogendoorn1, Maiwenn Al1, J.-Matthias Graf von der Schulenburg2, David Bowles3, Brigitta Monz4, Hendrik Schmidt4, Juliane Lungershausen4, Maureen Rutten-van Molken1. 1Institute for Medical Technology Assessment (iMTA), Erasmus University Rotterdam, Rotterdam, Netherlands; 2School of Economics and Management, Leibniz University Hanover, Hanover, Germany; 3Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Bielefeld, Bielefeld, Germany; 4Boehringer Ingelheim, Boehringer Ingelheim Pharma GmbH & Co KG, Ingelheim, Germany Background: The 1-year POET trial compared tiotropium to salmeterol regarding the effect on COPD exacerbations. Data from that trial informed this cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA). Aim: Performing a 1-year trial-based CEA of tiotropium versus salmeterol, followed by a 5-year model-based CEA, from the perspective of the German Social Health Insurance in 2010. Methods: The within-trial CEA included 7250 patients that had resource utilization recorded (COPD-related drug use and exacerbation-related healthcare use). The trial-based analysis was followed by a model-based analysis to synthesize the POET results with evidence from earlier studies, extrapolate results to 5-years, include costs of COPD maintenance treatment, and adapt to the severity distribution of COPD in the German population. Main endpoints were difference in costs, number of exacerbations, and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs; model only). Results: One-year costs were 1089 and 963 per patient treated with tiotropium and salmeterol, respectively; a difference of 126 Euro (95% uncertainty interval (UI): 55-195). The number of exacerbations avoided due to tiotropium was 0.064 (95% UI: 0.010-0.118). Tiotropium reduced exacerbation-related costs by 87 (95% UI: 19-157). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was 1961/exacerbation avoided. In the model-based analyses, the ICERs for a 1-year time horizon were 1690 and 9926 for the endpoints exacerbation avoided and QALY, respectively. Following the extension to 5 years, the latter ICER changed to 3488. Conclusion: Tiotropium reduced exacerbation-related costs, generating an incremental cost per QALY ratio that is considered cost-effective. 1683 Clinical and pharmacy-economical reasonability of the choice of fixed combination of fluticasone/salmeterol in the curing of bronchial asthma in the country with limited financing of the public health Dmitry Ruzanov1, Elena Davidovskaya2, Tatyana Baranovskaya2. 1Pulmonology & TB Department, Gomel State Medical University, Gomel, Belarus; 2Belarusian Academy of Post-Graduate Medical Education, Minsk, Belarus Aim: To estimate the real practice of prescription of preparations in curing BA, to analyze clinical and pharma-economical efficiency of conversion to the fixed combination of SALM/FP in curing BA. Method: The real practice of curing 266 patients with separated using of different preparations of basic therapy and short-rated broncholitics was retrospectively analyzed during the year (1st period) and the following year of their using of SALM/FP (2nd period). Results: It was managed to attain control (ACT) of 15,5% of patients in the real practice (1st period). System glucocorticoids were ambulatorially prescripted to 41 patient. On the average each patient used 15,6 inhaler SABA. The cost of treatment (ambulance, hospitalization, medicines, visits of the doctor, social payment) came to 1405 EUR per year. Controlled BA (at the end of the observation year) was recorded among 74,3% of patients during the 2nd period. The prescriptions of auxiliary medicines were cut by 6,4 times, the frequency of ambulance by 16,8 times, the duration of hospitalization by 11,7 times. On the average each patient used 0,78 of inhaler SABA. The cost of treatment came to 892 EUR per year. Typical errors of treatment have been analysed. Conclusion: The real clinical practice of curing BA in RB often differs from the recommendations of GINA 2009 and leads to the low level of control of BA (among 15,5%). The conversion to using fixed combination of SALM/FP enables to increase the percentage of patients with controlled asthma to 74,3% and cut the cost of treatment by 1,6 times. 286s Oral Presentation Elicium 1 08:30-10:30 Abstract printing supported by .

Data from randomised trials showed better adherence among patients receiving FDCs than among patients who did not (relative risk 1.10, 95%CI 0.98-1.22); these findings were consistent with data from observational cohorts (RR 1.17, 95% CI 1.07-1.28). There was also a tendency towards greater virological suppression among patients receiving FDCs in randomised trials (RR 1.04, 95%CI 0.99-1.10) and observational cohort studies (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.97-1.18). In all studies reporting patient preference, FDCs were preferred. The overall quality of the evidence was rated as low.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nFixed-dose combinations appear to offer multiple advantages for programmes and patients, particularly with respect to treatment adherence.","inCitations":["ec03111cf6ac838090a230ca682054b018576db4","ae90fe2fc0de5cb985eddb232a56ff4b77c9f240","d74e38cfe23305d7ccf06899164836d59da0bbb1","10604fc60b3883d92cb925b44fdb311df0e0d9f8","d08848962fc6a79628a3557443620ae6d66fb958","39485ce9540f799fe86e948cd94bc5153cd6c49f","d099bd871959f8948d8d4782834c9605444ca4dd","a9d9e738baf323b7b5c43ec6f3ee4dd60fbd9134","1943e4c31210d30d60e0e5f6aa51ef3966e30edb","c363711c17e44e4a516c52c82643167dc1332491","b2f8f70d6fbd248b9e2a2bf907e52fa75da7a86f","e5a06c14d5aaad72ecd963dc5cd448bb5811b4bb","164c467a41854f1a7869a1688e8ca8c983b742f0","843a0801579dbbccde56522919e311f4d80ed9b4","42bf838c898f22535dda6846cdea40af90ba380b","abcb0b50e24864ac21f354c404ce8c11b9eec060","5ec9081ccd2efac51d9c9005fe20ab4ffe82b30d","bc0a8ea4d280249756ffa39dc1d726cca5518b4e","f7269e5dbdff998dd756d48bbadaca5bb7eeb6e5","8c905472194905b660e58282cbb89d5bb930f7ca","9813ea1eb35ae9de6fa638509c57ccf79dd5061d","1648693c1d431043828ea2d0a3c2ab9cf574aa5e","4a3540f7f04413e57185e9137b073c499c23aba4","9605ed18e56b578cdc265922d2522a556a5162e5"],"pdfUrls":["https://archive-ouverte.unige.ch/files/downloads/0/0/0/7/4/4/0/2/unige_74402_attachment01.pdf"],"title":"Systematic review and meta-analysis: Patient and programme impact of fixed-dose combination antiretroviral therapy.","doi":"10.1111/tmi.12297","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1111/tmi.12297","venue":"Tropical medicine & international health : TM & IH"}

One hundred thirteen people with PD (age 66 +/- 95% CI 1.6 years) underwent clinical assessments and quantitative tests of sway, gait, strength, reaction time, and lower limb sensation. Participants were then followed up for 12 months to determine fall incidence. In the follow-up year, 51 participants (45%) fell one or more times whereas 62 participants (55%) did not fall. Multivariate analyses of routine clinical measures revealed that a fall in the past year, abnormal axial posture, cognitive impairment, and freezing of gait were independent risk factors for falls and predicted 38/51 fallers (75%) and 45/62 non-fallers (73%). A multivariate model combining clinical and physiological measures that elucidate the pathophysiology of falls identified abnormal posture, freezing of gait, frontal impairment, poor leaning balance, and leg weakness as independent risk factors. This model correctly classified 39/51 fallers (77%) and 51/62 non-fallers (82%). Patients with PD at risk of falls can be identified accurately with routine clinical assessments and quantitative physiological tests.

Hourly urban and rural air temperature observations are used to investigate the daily cycle of heat island growth, seasonal variations of nocturnal heat island intensity, and important controls on heat island magnitude. Urban rural differences in nocturnal cooling are analyzed and related to heat island dynamics. Seasonal variations of rural thermal admittance are estimated from soil properties, and the relationship between thermal admittance, cooling potential, and heat island magnitude is explored. The heat island of Vancouver is found to be most significant at night, with the daily cycle of heat island magnitude linked to urban rural differences in cooling/warming rates. Nocturnal heat island magnitude is shown to vary significantly from day-to-day, and seasonally, but the causes of these variations are not obvious. The inverse square root of wind speed and a measure of cloud amount and type are shown to be linearly related to heat island intensity on average, but cannot be used to predict heat island intensity on any particular occasion. Distinct seasonal variations in rural thermal admittance are observed, and although they are physically capable of producing significant seasonal variability of heat island magnitude, only a weak relationship between the two measures is found. It is concluded that while heat island magnitude behaves predictably on average, the magnitude of the urban rural temperature difference on any particular occasion is unpredictable as a result of other unknown influences, or random effects.","inCitations":["b2ed4b85cd05d424c84b1c2f150174b9866446ad","3fa2076234702a3caf1f570d1d7b02fbaa1400e1"],"pdfUrls":["https://open.library.ubc.ca/media/download/pdf/831/1.0086958/1"],"title":"Temporal dynamics of Vancouver’s urban heat island","doi":"10.14288/1.0086958","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.14288/1.0086958","venue":""}

Status overcomes the resentment that is typically produced by the use of power. We identify approaches to gaining status and power and discuss their use by leaders. Sixty years of cumulative research on power and status in groups indicates that developing effective leadership requires the sparing use of power.

Many older people will experience a delirium during hospitalisation. While prevention or prompt management of delirium is paramount to providing quality care, research suggest that health professionals regularly fail to differentiate between delirium and other cognitive changes in hospitalised patients. A total of 1209 patients were surveyed over the four audit days with 183 patients (15%) being identified as confused. 'Confusion\" was the most common descriptor used by nurses to describe cognitive and behavioural changes; in many cases it was the only term used. Many of these changes were indicative of delirium. Little use by any health professional of cognitive screening tools were found.Cognitive and behavioural changes are a common problem in hospitalised patients who are elderly. The use of the term confusion to describe a range of cognitive and behavioural changes is a barrier to accurate identification of delirum, which is often the first indicator of serious underlying illness.","inCitations":["e647151eed3cf0870d72fa1170457e098766203d","ac0670137f0f60babe4259e6e87b8c4a58bc7686","f588bbc132dd194ce8dd484f84a42623051881ff","fce04d374303ed827795a171d5217f86c2beb0ee","1f3c4ec6986ecabc2754e0e96a9f78277f2a7e3c","c3f6eea054cd7d03ef70e44dd45b4cf87995b523","3e3fe0cdccea47d641976e1da2dd570be0236fc4","c467692c447d5e6da37f57d071b342439328df51","8f3b0da8bcbd52555a12dd3732da4eb3d2ff82cb","bb3f5d4e592c6a8714bd854d4ed0d1ed79225801","7c74d3ca321b589d9161583d219704e6b9dd89f5","db2b9349313d001c297c76edde39b8f08f14d067"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.ajan.com.au/Vol26/26-1v2_Hare.pdf"],"title":"Nurses descriptions of changes in cognitive function in the acute care setting","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Conventional methods of treatment are chemotherapy and radiation, which were associated with toxicities and lack of specificity. Potential cell surface targets for treatment of B-cell NHL (B-NHL) include CD19, CD20, and CD22 which are highly expressed on malignant B-cells. The development of monoclonal antibody (mAb) therapy directed against CD20 had the most clinical impact in the treatment of B-NHL. Early clinical trials with rituximab (RTX), the first chimeric mAb against CD20, showed efficacy and minimal toxicities. RTX was later approved as first line in combination with CHOP chemotherapy for Diffuse Large B-NHL (DLBCL). The emergence of resistance to RTX prompted the development of the next-generation of mAbs targeting CD20 (e.g. obinituzumab, ofatumumab), and includes ublituximab (Ub), with higher complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) against malignant B-cells. Areas covered: Herein, we discuss clinical trials of Ub, highlighting efficacy, tolerability and an expert opinion on drug development in B-NHL. A pubmed search was conducted to evaluate all Ub clinical trials. Expert opinion: Ub demonstrated efficacy in patients with high-risk CLL and B-NHL in both first line, subsequent lines, and in rituximab refractory patients.","inCitations":["f365f403a4a77693575776acb69bd22bd84248b8","b7d462f0fb77630d834b21722f8956e3afe43883","2bb663cb91fd5a30de5e272293c8545ac4eba0dc","55abeee84797f4e03540006519ff8bd181795222","c363084a0f5cc62a79cfcf39339110bc7587853b"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Ublituximab for the treatment of CD20 positive B-cell malignancies.","doi":"10.1080/13543784.2018.1459560","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1080/13543784.2018.1459560","venue":"Expert opinion on investigational drugs"}

The specific sediment load is in the order of 1000 t/km2/yr in High Mountain to 8000 t/km2/yr in Siwalik. The huge amount of sediment coming every year during rainy season is causing serious problem in the operation of the plant, resulting in frequent flushing of the settling basin, wear and tear of the hydraulic structures and turbines. However, the sediment is being managed successfully by discharging through the gates and flushing operation. Its impact on the hydraulic structures and turbines has been managed through the proper maintenance using highly wearing resistant materials. Since, the run of river hydropower plants are being built in the sediment laden rivers, the desanding basin is normally provided to trap mostly sand size particles. However, the silt particles remain suspended in the flow with the concentration of 5000 ppm to 6000 ppm causing the wear and tear of the runner blades, wearing rings and other internal parts. The rate of erosion of runner blades and other internal parts is found high. The effect of the wear at the turbine was maintained by annual maintenance. Similarly, the bed load discharging through the gates during the rainy season is causing serious erosion in the concrete ogee surface and invert of the sluice channel. The monitoring of the erosion in the hydraulic turbines and hydraulic structures is done immediately after the monsoon season and then maintenance activity is started. The paper discusses about the silting problem, its remedial measures and sediment management at Marsyangdi Hydro Power Plant (69MW).","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"142.

Reactive oxygen species (ROS) play a key role in respond to biotic stress in plants. To study the involvement of ROS and the degree of cell death in the wheat roots following inoculation, ROS levels and microstructure of root cells were analyzed in two wheat cultivars that are susceptible (Huamai 8) and resistant (Shenmai 8) to powdery mildew fungus. At 18 d after powdery mildew fungus inoculation, only Huamai 8 displayed the leaf lesions, while root cell death occurred in both varieties. Huamai 8 had a high level of ROS accumulation, which is associated with increased root cell degradation, while in Shenmai 8, there was little ROS accumulation correlating with slight root cell degradation. The molecular study about the expression levels of ROS scavenging genes (MnSOD and CAT) in wheat roots showed that these genes expression decreased after the leaves of wheat was inoculated. The difference between Huamai 8 and Shenmai 8 on subcellular localization of H2O2 and O2– was corresponded with the different down-regulation of the genes encoding for superoxide dismutase and catalase in two wheat cultivars. These results suggested that ROS were involved in the process by which powdery mildew fungus induced cell death in wheat roots.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Reactive oxygen species are involved in cell death in wheat roots against powdery mildew","doi":"10.1016/s2095-3119(18)62092-1","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/s2095-3119%2818%2962092-1","venue":""}

This results in an unrestrained cell proliferation. Other genetic alterations are common in MCL cells such as SOX11 expression, mutations of ATM and/or TP53 genes, activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway and NOTCH receptors. These alterations lead to the deregulation of the apoptotic machinery and resistance to drugs. We observed that among a panel of MCL cell lines, REC1 cells were resistant towards genotoxic stress. We studied the molecular basis of this resistance.MethodsWe analyzed the cell response regarding apoptosis, senescence, cell cycle arrest, DNA damage response and finally the 26S proteasome activity following a genotoxic treatment that causes double strand DNA breaks.ResultsMCL cell lines displayed various sensitivity/resistance towards genotoxic stress and, in particular, REC1 cells did not enter apoptosis or senescence after an etoposide treatment. Moreover, the G2/M cell cycle checkpoint was deficient in REC1 cells. We observed that three main actors of apoptosis, senescence and cell cycle regulation (cyclin D1, MCL1 and CDC25A) failed to be degraded by the proteasome machinery in REC1 cells. We ruled out a default of the βTrCP E3-ubiquitine ligase but detected a lowered 26S proteasome activity in REC1 cells compared to other cell lines.ConclusionThe resistance of MCL cells to genotoxic stress correlates with a low 26S proteasome activity. This could represent a relevant biomarker for a subtype of MCL patients with a poor response to therapies and a high risk of relapse.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://static-content.springer.com/esm/art:10.1186%2Fs12885-017-3530-z/MediaObjects/12885_2017_3530_MOESM1_ESM.pdf","https://bmccancer.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s12885-017-3530-z"],"title":"A lowered 26S proteasome activity correlates with mantle lymphoma cell lines resistance to genotoxic stress","doi":"10.1186/s12885-017-3530-z","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12885-017-3530-z","venue":"BMC Cancer"}

In the May 2015 issue of this journal, Lisonkova and Joseph described a simulation study suggesting that bias from left truncation might explain the inverse association. The simulations were based on strong assumptions regarding the underlying mechanisms through which bias might occur. Methods: To examine the sensitivity of the previous authors’ conclusions to these assumptions, we constructed a new Monte Carlo simulation using published estimates to frame our data-generating parameters. We estimated the association between smoking and preeclampsia across a range of scenarios that incorporated abnormal placentation and early pregnancy loss. Results: Our results confirmed that the previous authors’ findings are highly dependent on assumptions regarding the strength of association between abnormal placentation and preeclampsia. Thus, the bias they described may be less pronounced than was suggested. Conclusions: Under empirically derived constraints of these critical assumptions, left truncation does not appear to fully explain the inverse association between smoking and preeclampsia. Furthermore, when considering processes in which left truncation may result from the exposure, it is important to precisely describe the target population and parameter of interest before assessing potential bias. We comment on the specification of a meaningful target population when assessing maternal smoking and preeclampsia as a public health issue. We describe considerations for defining a target population in studies of perinatal exposures when those exposures cause competing events (e.g., early pregnancy loss) for primary outcomes of interest.","inCitations":["f5c4d1d1c3ca778515ffb8d219efbc64cd7baf04","cd041c9de395f6beea24f3ff8547c991920f380b","ea28e1e82ba130adf9d4b390b4aff7a73f129ae7"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Left Truncation Bias to Explain the Protective Effect of Smoking on Preeclampsia: Potential, But How Plausible?","doi":"10.1097/EDE.0000000000000632","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1097/EDE.0000000000000632","venue":"Epidemiology"}

The purpose of this paper is to elucidate how men interpret the signals sent by women displaying luxury brands.,An interpretivist approach and phenomenological methods were applied, involving interviews with selected men in Hong Kong.,The men interviewed suggested that if a woman’s overall image matches that of the brands she displays and the situation, luxurious brands can amplify the woman’s beauty and perceived class status. However, if these factors clash, men react negatively and tend to view the woman as engaging in impression management and pretending to have high social status unjustifiably.,The sample for this phenomenological study was limited to Hong Kong men only. Culture must, almost by definition, influence men’s views toward women and branded products, so similar exploratory research in other cultures seems justified.,The findings suggest that marketers should offer “brand education” to help make their female consumers aware of the images their products are trying to establish, and what are the appropriate usage situations. Such consumer education would also reduce the risk of negative image transfer from the brand user to the brands.,The current understanding of female luxury brand signals is limited to female-vs-female intra-sexual competition. By examining how men interpret female luxury brand signals, this research addresses an important research gap.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"How men interpret women’s luxury brand signals","doi":"10.1108/JFMM-02-2018-0025","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1108/JFMM-02-2018-0025","venue":""}

Ethical concerns with such experiments are broadly classed into issues of suffering, the sanctity of life, individual ‘rights’, and conservation. The latter, involving manipulation of the animal's environment, is particularly important in field as distinct from laboratory experimentation. This paper seeks to stimulate debate about such ethical concerns amongst ethologists and behavioural ecologists. To do so, currently popular research methods in experimental field studies of behaviour are reviewed. Ethical concerns relevant to each methodology are then addressed.","inCitations":["e4ded01cb91850681c93419f2feed9cde16a7ac6","824f2f227ae405ecb5821ce4912a3f3afabf1d10","67dd845bb4e304eb91a24245a67f969afc06ba69","7b081e07bd06858cc5da20f9d94428db14d1c9fe","95fc33f385515c4b808c193e7645e942ae8426a5","b31d53ed76501c971a7eba2ea8ccdfa805e1645f","f718e3ac41009e46b1af8af05d093a836d4a6082","8c1d824fecf88f52fcf849319ac8be78cd3f7691","1dd793d2a86947d3b9986089feba4c510b29de20","a83d6728962685578512cdd4a6a0cc5e0900a725","adab416447529610cdcabbe9bb9f983ada1d56ca","67a1ccf1966abeb4d1ddbce71175046bc30e0aa1","52d474bc740a401cd5436c6dca9fd01c2efcff3b","4d6b00259e9f216ac59334feaf40efbe7a44027e","8c0c7b56b378289bc1856ae96adc2fe41dd1cfe1","cab921c9e408f09deba61832568e962f6e72a583","d9c0b8d2abdaaaf49106cebc3d33af307b06799b","c89b2e308d4605f8bbf0b6de2692c10601d0291f","cc3d8d06358bd36ea340b71ea18c0b739156aa2c","96787f222218d79b5e99af1a9f36ef417623022e","6ac60c163507de08d98ce10550cc104ab30a9d01","899b0f5fdcc69da3b4b6e466fdff7ef6bf538a7c","d44f386ecc73624e7586cfaa4af8780d3fbe6d53","3e6f812cc42f21d89571cc616af302b8087bac2c","be265f4cb7b2038993d81d99b2a686a8ee12aac1","e1b4bb272fd3bb969a31774051fc81c031974d1f","5e29d06c63477d122874d392abf68ecc83a1db9c","95d6db84ae6d9efd1ade7091d405c1490912fec3","70de98b2b28051507d7df25af54d41f7743aa570","1436faeeae4e822e736350af220c6273aa2f8e7d","1ccf5833da9c576816531cfaa6d7cdefea44959f","6890adfa3127be363a7c3b03925fbf22363f4489","84c954c4eb11ba39e31ff86771d0779fb559b2bf","236e403675bf863fa32d019ade1d1f0160fa92dd","bb31795dc71ea24ffb5e7c6945bfa7706ef1982b","40af2058865e64abffefbca3bbcb20fdabe59e2e","17fef56d1252995b98d55149d1f5b66d8cf260b1","34c7143a1c766073158d2163ec5b45551a86ae92","deb446b571db7bd680fcf0e717855a108449f22c","69f9d328f38eb3d296c2722ef1f1ed520df21acb","8c95dfe0865bc51b50a4824a22318f9b8a51aa91","2e28547b4a5053e4dbcaae78dea1c1b42ae80dfd","473424bd7daa9bf95ef17857c8f2521a8e2e4b92","5e25950b93b26b4c711260f63c616fde9a4114a9","79212d8d8e0fbddc8a27c98d55456b49049ff36c","fa9973cc517b6b7a29109abec649a53a237c6ee1","986621f5cb3f2b207593b542f3967ba022ff79ac","cd7cb11cfc9217be22b48b75f8ddbaaaef26dcdc","32f052c097eeec57163482260810f62683e0777d","53193d835dc4a545000a476a6acaa770ebc72835","624b8aee78d192f24bd8d96ca1fb86060234247c","db00108f5e96831a35fa7cf5719d39aaf69c41d8","288700c95f0479a933be9a3dc739ac1cc393f22f","4ea6a4d1036add8c99313391756ba3db86b76248"],"pdfUrls":["https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0003347205801538","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003347205801538?dgcid=api_sd_search-api-endpoint"],"title":"Field experiments in animal behaviour: methods and ethics","doi":"10.1016/S0003-3472(05)80153-8","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/S0003-3472%2805%2980153-8","venue":"Animal Behaviour"}

It is shown that performing independent component analysis on video sequences of natural scenes produces results with qualitatively similar spatiotemporal properties. Whereas the independent components of video resemble moving edges or bars, the independent component filters, i.e. the analogues of receptive fields, resemble moving sinusoids windowed by steady gaussian envelopes. Contrary to earlier ICA results on static images, which gave only filters at the finest possible spatial scale, the spatiotemporal analysis yields filters at a range of spatial and temporal scales. Filters centered at low spatial frequencies are generally tuned to faster movement than those at high spatial frequencies.","inCitations":["0188ea4ad60940c7be7f13901d45fff9a9ce1e53","48ff4fcb5c4d6113e6183d0dd1cab3f218b248ac","8ef13b0e721fffcaef0ecac5528efc95c37c80ea","8a2f90fa2e2a6653c4e5c0e0914ec60f07b44754","7c032d555a9d7096f7bb88441f10e33d3302d5be","c4c813c01f7157144fafb18fa37a783aa557a745","8942c8fb622ad4bec37723ebd732667b2caf9e0a","d02883734052ab509be921236b636c40bac3cb09","f9dacb86fe5e26f547d992c1b68e8239eae52a4d","f80b5a3c948c0a9e044e6fd6a33a429564726366","5849a0cd965800243701a2ed6eb3e753fc0b3825","6ec0cccf5ce6d3ab6ae79a82abd9161a67ce52ed","032bb6ea9b99b3adb9b7f0e45a62c9f37f9e1bc5","588f1313581e1beebfc5e01d9a872cca52153afd","413b2dfb7f726875a305b9547282d66e320b2abe","a2befc00ccced5759a8bc07fa35649dcbab4e02e","53b76738acc916983561eba12ec278b7d152e7a4","5d31414e74f934a8b9ac8be0652061791c7e2298","9326b704777daf8721723628acb07d042d7654e7","1d7bde60ef9956aaef929e42fd88c7d4dc5d71ff","4c8d735a5b5804429b0805cd173646be831096ee","9693600e3c4c444620eb0e4f8c1b756400a15e0c","b56f1ea5df4a7933fbca6f6f409d1f8135181cd6","0a34235bd38c3378c652043fbfbbe555328ba72f","578a58fe31e839b809de61f3a07f2e5ed49b1058","0dd289358b14f8176adb7b62bf2fb53ea62b3818","6fb675145ac262a00213d09ed2a52f26bff95a0b","338516d81a7a4fb94f41e8ae9c32acd0633d617c","4f335cb79ea5368992b8e2fcfe1dd63831bda4cb","63c68278418b69f60b4814fae8dd15b1b1854295","ac0913c60588333080629dad6723bf8c5636de3a","1ec9c420527ff40dda8f578bade637321f58062e","ba06decaa784655589ebe8109b3697cd7302abef","41c8770e21127edec5f560166b92c3f1ec86f39f","ceb22a926ef412f63a06d1382277347158407684","44c6c861bb1148fde2350c6397fbe5925fafc923","06f4ed152e1bd0082a2604a3d431914f81bed472","0c24155dfbdd6878aec419f26b71affd644918be","ea60c3eb35d6fd6316f7b4c0244f755f85be854b","6dd42b80a0d43a75918ffeca8d3de5810d70b9cc","10d64aa3a4be2a4a00ac82af8d0f109d9949e611","15942c8365c0cb6b6637e13054a3b180ad9a8ade","d086a103e7bff7a14e27685fb0dc88c3724c9e33","9d4648c9ce8f9d62b941b57615450f6f434a609a","bfeac1d71bde4fe60b01402bc337f11d6b540a5d","818ef40d226bddbdadde4fb2ffaaa2f939f24f6b","bba4c9d830410ea9afc2bae2babdaf28b1f6110c","33abe777f5d2eb31e8e843cad26731cf19b25043","175b1f16fd08a49dd95d5eca2c2ccd0291bdd7d5","a88ce260b9e976f7a1fab08812eb3dd57aa20f68","5aa5d1e9e67a104b724073d22c30bf972512197e","a15488466ee9d465e5caf739b4b035d2b8dda197","be1d25db9cfbe98ba2dc437826dea74ccd3fb10a","54fc77b3b3f8ed657437c4048fa6fffea6495b30","ea7e5ae3182833c49aaf0449202455201a05a009","71794484dd13b27dd586754c82f1eb8613b97c52","164b8826b9a30adf69630e634b308046b8cec619"],"pdfUrls":["ftp://ftp.keck.ucsf.edu/pub/ken/neuro262/ruderman-hateran.ps"],"title":"Independent Component Analysis of Natural Image Sequences Yields Spatiotemporal Filters Similar to Simple Cells in Primary Visual Cortex","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

I also accompanied co-workers on their home visits. Through my job, I became involved in the lives of dozens of families and hundreds of children. The Community District for which my unit was responsible was on the far eastern edge of Queens and contained African American and white neighborhoods. I rarely went to the white neighborhoods, but I became very familiar with the African American neighborhoods. I knew their streets. I knew their school officials. I knew their homes. I was surprised that almost none of the parents that I investigated had abused or neglected their children. I was involved with over a hundred cases, but only dealt with one case of real child neglect and one case of classic child abuse. During my time with the agency I saw several children taken from homes where they faced some level of very real danger. I also saw the agency steamroll many dozens of innocent families. They became involved in a system that was capricious, abusive, and which seemed to do more harm than good. The only help we offered the children was to place them in foster care; there seemed to be no intention of helping parents. Very quickly, it became clear to me that the “help” of foster care was no help at all. While I met some warm, caring foster parents, the vast majority of foster parents I met were obviously in it for the money. They were baby boarders.","inCitations":["98cbc1af3b138e8fe711fd774866c4173b580ed5","2e03665c411c9c4c13716e5471035001785a46a1","34606bc0c167aaf62e46815e298824ada14b609a"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.familieslink.co.uk/download/july07/Children_as_Chattel.pdf"],"title":"Children as Chattel: Invoking the Thirteenth Amendment to Reform Child Welfare","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Although the parotid gland is the most common site of involvement, other major salivary glands and the minor salivary glands-most commonly of the palate-also can be involved. The management of mucoepidermoid carcinoma depends on the grade of the tumor and the adequacy of resection. We present the case of a 56-year-old female presenting a painless progressive cheek mass over 2 months. Imaging and fine-needle aspiration cytology provided the diagnosis of Mucoepidermoid carcinoma. A superficial parotidectomy was done, and the histopathology revealed a predominantly cystic tumor with a bilayered epithelium of oncocytic and basal cells. Moderate nuclear pleomorphism with infiltration of atypical squamous cells in few glandular cysts was seen. Special staining revealed the presence of intracellular mucin. A diagnosis of Warthin-like variant of MEC was made, based on these findings. After the surgical procedures, the patient is disease-free at 8 months of follow-up. The Warthin-like variant is a rare variant of MEC with fewer than 10 cases described in the English literature. Various differential diagnoses include the malignant transformation of Wartin tumor (WT), squamous metaplasia of WT, and metastasis from a distant primary.

We aimed to examine the associations of adiposity with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and other chronic liver diseases in Chinese adults. The prospective China Kadoorie Biobank recruited 512,891 adults aged 30–79 years from 10 areas. During 10 years of follow-up, 7,386 incident liver disease cases were recorded among 503,991 participants without prior cancer or chronic liver disease at baseline. The mean body mass index (BMI) (SD) was 23.7 (3.3) kg/m2 and mean waist circumference (WC) 80.3 (9.8) cm, with 33% having BMI ≥25 kg/m2. Throughout the range examined (BMI 15–50) BMI showed a log-linear positive association with NAFLD (n = 1,298), with adjusted HR per 5 kg/m2 of 2.81 (95% CI 2.63–3.01), adjusting for regression dilution. There were also positive associations of percent body fat, WC, and waist-to-hip ratio with NAFLD, with HRs per 1-SD of 2.27 (2.14–2.41), 2.60 (2.44–2.76), and 1.84 (1.76–1.92). BMI was unrelated to viral hepatitis (n = 1,477), and had a U-shaped association with cirrhosis (n = 2,082) and an inverse association with liver cancer (n = 2,568), which disappeared after excluding the first 5 years of follow-up. Among Chinese adults, adiposity was a major risk factor for NAFLD but not other chronic liver diseases.","inCitations":["9e7a953b85cf48d498039672b7150390e9ac9842","5146a7efd78c7cc7304587c9761ee2298961d74b","626cda95b60ef3f956ba132bbfdf405942244381","fdefe4b0f0f1fda04c6e58dd72181c45552d1cb2"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Adiposity in relation to risks of fatty liver, cirrhosis and liver cancer: a prospective study of 0.5 million Chinese adults","doi":"10.1038/s41598-018-36460-7","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-018-36460-7","venue":"Scientific Reports"}

Earlier phylogenetic studies indicated that there are several species complexes within the genus and that thorough taxonomic revisions are needed. In this study, we aim at resolving the phylogeny and taxonomy of the M. brevirostris species complex distributed from the Middle East to the Arabian/Persian Gulf region and Pakistan. We sequenced three mitochondrial and three nuclear gene fragments, and in combination with species delimitation and species-tree estimation, we infer a time-calibrated phylogeny of the complex. The results of the genetic analyses support the presence of four clearly delimited species in the complex that diverged approximately between the middle Pliocene and the Pliocene/Pleistocene boundary. Species distribution models of the four species show that the areas of suitable habitat are geographically well delineated and nearly allopatric, and that most of the species have rather divergent environmental niches. Morphological characters also confirm the differences between the species, although sometimes minute. As a result of all these lines of evidence, we revise the taxonomy of the Mesalina brevirostris species complex. We designate a lectotype for Mesalina brevirostris Blanford, 1874; resurrect the available name Eremias bernoullii Schenkel, 1901 from the synonymy of M. brevirostris; elevate M. brevirostris microlepis (Angel, 1936) to species status; and describe Mesalina saudiarabica, a new species from Saudi Arabia.","inCitations":["8abb832ff9b07c3b43d834d10e6c3c540efedfb7","aed871224e42b5b988b5470acd5ba3693e74300e","e3bc5ac10110816ca6fa37d30a06446cb22301b1","85a53f9ba96692933b89d1c0e04578a96460007f","56b1324aed8f49880f75d930e7786228fa22fae3"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.vaclavgvozdik.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/2017-Smid_etal-Mesalina_brevirostris_phylo_ecological_diversification-w_Supp.pdf","http://www.lacerta.de/AS/Bibliografie/BIB_11151.pdf"],"title":"Cutting the Gordian Knot: Phylogenetic and ecological diversification of the Mesalina brevirostris species complex (Squamata, Lacertidae)","doi":"10.1111/zsc.12254","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1111/zsc.12254","venue":""}

In this regards, the Model-Driven Architecture (MDA) initiative of OMG is providing useful concepts and techniques. The MDA ultimate objective is that of improving quality and software maintainability by allowing for the reuse of models and mappings between models. It offers standards and techniques for model interoperability and for automating model transformations. Our goal in this paper is to address the role of model transformations in AOSE by discussing a practical example, with reference to the Tropos methodology. In particular, we will focus on the automatic transformation of a Tropos plan decomposition into a UML 2.0 activity diagram. We will show how to use the transformation technique to automate model mappings and describe how a CASE tool, based on a modular architecture, has been extended to automate models transformations.","inCitations":["1799b004edcd5949480b54d921cb017c58318994","3faa2763007d509974a9fffde683e3adfca71b56","f895b649c17a34e39e66c35158dae03d359adb01","1307a612950b05375996f972bebc8498945fa760","5eda7e00bda8e7681031d6e3dd95221f04dd9851","ffe90436f6dad25439d9c873dafe4fca6eb35b3b","26fb2d95f0ed29a9d728b4a4805216370abf7384","3025dbda8ab58ab19ff980a9c112989ef0192ffd","99272c9678ada7182a5df47a4ce765f2a7cb52f4","9b1dccde083300e5e967225b797c8bfc17031596","153dd577154f720d2f5281af800d6907cda3cfcc","4ffffbafeab6a207da96c2c69f9c605a5088e887","e53aa56fc4ec78c82f685ea25a46f64cd363d2d0","f26d6c2bd9df3081e9239ca98ed08a04d1b95312","e78cd57cafa0d1bd19a46ec21feb5b191b44dfdc","897b2d5339be197589e7a9fd044f61c1c5defadb","360f15e88893ffc02425b3673b90e260987f556e","2559163380c20d68a89bb0f9b75a6f2ac70ad311","3ea7e7db042115f28133a0ed79eb3af21058f32d","66445236620769ad94e6bd008d0404578a412567","d30ecdd730615357cc4cabac56738f21b4f7a408","c8a14e97e1ff2e3309db0d2bccf0635d29318151","cc28b5106193f688e964e6adf80459de11bba4d6","7132a79fcb545f30184556a849ae7596995457bc","f2144ad992a393cdfca4ca8ff90be42ccd9fb70f","d5ee6f475e5883bddd3233134284b269bec7f4ca","6a24549a7887454085cfa12162d590772e9ba24d","6838baa1073ef16998ee050a88175347a562f366","15668c8e4d5470d84e5e5d288141796648fa7925","0fe6bebe34f2555192bf272a697436339dc4fe8c","cc4a7593998f7686077c2c1aa832bb8c8c4b5b71","93ea83919e8ae79e321e6423e35d56b9871a3009","fb57dd463ddee7905364ab001668a2aba8889042","16f33737b151d6b595abb1965ed384866f5f2f0f","2001b58825bdf7d24224b9355339f0fc12e9aaf6","93fc500657361f3084ccad198955965172e0be8a","568806d02a5ab9208567f8dcaf87065db4e12959","a134222d4aba06ae693ec62bcbb8006288443e0f","0f5181bf776424c9617f2b5f94682faf6fb21deb","516e44b3d18eed7ee88a0f16cc3766c4d017d5ff","824275da0b1f2ad40da4992f596040d28b30bcfd"],"pdfUrls":["http://klase.fbk.eu/paper_firb_astro_klase/paper_2006/aose-perini-susi.pdf","http://www.agentgroup.unimo.it/aose05/papers/23.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1007/11752660_13","http://www.researchgate.net/profile/Anna_Perini/publication/221419093_Automating_Model_Transformations_in_Agent-Oriented_Modelling/links/02bfe50f955a18d24e000000.pdf","https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Anna_Perini/publication/221419093_Automating_Model_Transformations_in_Agent-Oriented_Modelling/links/02bfe50f955a18d24e000000.pdf"],"title":"Automating Model Transformations in Agent-Oriented Modelling","doi":"10.1007/11752660_13","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/11752660_13","venue":"AOSE"}

Individuals of most of these families regularly (but not always) retain flight-feathers for one or more annual cycles, until a subsequent prebasic molt. Retained flight feathers most often include the outer secondaries, although in some families or species, primaries, primary coverts and/or rectrices may also be retained. In certain families or species (group A) flight feathers are typically replaced during the first prebasic molt, juvenal feathers being retained until the second prebasic molt, whereas in others (group B) flight feathers are not typically replaced until the second prebasic molt, juvenal feathers being retained until the third prebasic molt. In both of these groups adult feathers can also be (but are not always) retained during subsequent prebasic molts. Four flight-feather patterns are thus found in non-molting birds: uniform juvenal, uniform adult, mixed adult and juvenal, and mixed replaced and retained adult feathers. Assuming that retained juvenal and adult feathers can be distinguished, many birds of group A (pigeons, doves, cuckoos, roadrunners and anis) can be reliably aged through at least their second year, and many birds of group B (nightjars, trogons and the larger kingfishers) can be aged though at least their third","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://www.birdpop.org/docs/pubs/Pyle_1995_Incomplete_FF_Molt_and_Age_in_NA_Non-Passerines.pdf"],"title":"Incomplete Flight Feather Molt and Age in Certain North American Non-passerines","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}
