Decomposition of [Zn(S2CNiBu2)2] in oleylamine gives high aspect ratio wurtzite nanowires, the average length of which was increased upon addition of thiuram disulfide to the decomposition mixture. To provide further insight into the decomposition process, X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) of [Zn(S2CNMe2)2] was performed in the solid-state, in non-coordinating xylene and in oleylamine. In the solid-state, dimeric [Zn(S2CNMe2)2]2 was characterised in accord with the single crystal X-ray structure, while in xylene this breaks down into tetrahedral monomers. In situ XAS in oleylamine (RNH2) shows that the coordination sphere is further modified, amine binding to give five-coordinate [Zn(S2CNMe2)2(RNH2)]. This species is stable to ca. 70 °C, above which amine dissociates and at ca. 90 °C decomposition occurs to generate ZnS. The relatively low temperature onset of nanoparticle formation is associated with amine-exchange leading to the in situ formation of [Zn(S2CNMe2)(S2CNHR)] which has a low temperature decomposition pathway. Combining these observations with the previous work of others allows us to propose a detailed mechanistic scheme for the overall process.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Understanding the role of zinc dithiocarbamate complexes as single source precursors to ZnS nanomaterials","doi":"10.1039/c9na00665f","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1039/c9na00665f","venue":""}

One possible explanation for this is that higher stocking rates can increase soil compaction. This can reduce soil porosity and surface infiltration rates and could increase the area covered by individual urine patches, due to greater dispersion following deposition. Increased urine spread would result in reduced urine-N deposition rate and potential for greater uptake of urine N by pasture. A plot trial was established on a ryegrass/white clover pasture on a Te Kowhai soil in the Waikato in late autumn 2017. Four treatments were applied: compacted or uncompacted, and with or without urine. Compaction was carried out using a roller to apply a pressure similar to that exerted by a 500 kg dairy cow. Two litres of artificial urine (35 C) was applied to the centre of a 1 m plot according to a standard cow height and time interval for each of the urine treatment plots. The area covered by the urine patches was measured using an infra-red camera and soil samples were collected to measure physical properties. Four pasture harvests were taken from the plots following treatment application and pasture dry matter and N content were measured. Before urine application, the compacted soil had significantly fewer pores in the greater than 30 micron range (commonly referred to as macroporosity) than the uncompacted soil and this was reflected in the approximately 40% greater area covered by the urine applied to the compacted plots. There was no significant difference in pasture N concentration between compaction treatments at any harvest but the urine treatments did produce significantly more dry matter than non-urine (control) treatments at the first two harvests (24%). At the first harvest the compacted control treatment produced less dry matter (15%) than the uncompacted control. However, the compacted urine treatment produced the same amount of dry matter as the uncompacted urine treatment at the same harvest. Recovery of urine-N in herbage was the same in the compacted and uncompacted plots over all harvests. Further research is needed to understand the potential effects on leaching of surplus urine-N through these soils as affected by the differences in urine-N deposition rate and soil physical properties associated with the soil compaction.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://flrc.massey.ac.nz/workshops/18/Manuscripts/Paper_Sprosen_2018.pdf"],"title":"Evaluation of the Effect of Soil Compaction on Urine Patch Area and Plant Recovery of Urine-nitrogen","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

In particular, that fact is worth attention that both poetesses use not only usual synonyms, but synonymical pairs either. The proximity of their works lies not only in morphological and grammatical aspects, but in semantic plane either, it refers to the cases when synonymical words coincide in their meanings. The usage of synonyms by the poetesses elevates an expressiveness of their creations, affords to avoid dullness of language; these two women-of-letters are singled out as bright stars in the firmament of contemporary poetry.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"О Некоторых Синонимах - Существительных В В Поэзии Фарзоны И М.

We estimated national ED utilization by uninsured patients and compared uninsured and insured ED patients in terms of demographics, diagnostic testing, disposition and final diagnoses.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe analyzed data from the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (2006-2009) stratified by insurance status. Demographic data, diagnoses, testing, and procedures performed in the ED were tabulated for each visit. Weighted percentages provided by National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey were used to estimate national rates for each variable, and multivariate models were constructed for predicting testing, procedures, and admission.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe 135085 ED visits represent 475 million patients visits, of which 78.9 million (16.6%) were uninsured. Compared with insured patients, uninsured patients were more often male (51.1% vs 44.3%) and younger (age 18-44 years, 66.2% vs 35.4%). Uninsured patients had lower rates of circulatory/cardiovascular (7.5% vs 4.1%) and respiratory diagnoses (14.6% vs 11.8%). Uninsured patients had fewer diagnostic tests and procedures and fewer hospital admissions than those with insurance. In our multivariate models, insurance status was predictive of testing and procedures but not hospital admission.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nUninsured patients account for approximately 20 million or 1 in 6 ED visits annually in the United States and have differences in demographics, diagnoses, and ED utilization patterns from those with insurance.","inCitations":["e7723ee48c145db96d3bbe893d27ab265c243046","43c650a93f486259e9c11b91f4570ba11fe604dd","b5397eb422cd348ad36dafd3d8b98616c3839d4b","5b13e92c26d480b1e8570ba9653cde8358f3a0fa","d88a061b3340b2aab887f737c07b657d31237eba","5e5fa65b75193c2842d9a8ce4cdfe3f48bd7456b","2380d4bf8c0ee3a2d71f6a24468c4f663c4827fa","3059fe38b9c344138e38849bd1bddccb99deb225","da498b3169318bac4b91bb3bbc6f6b7f9671c637","9bbfd3d3514f1aef6ceeb413cd2019cdf7a948b4","6d0c964bda426be1d47407b455fd1421b9e53c3d","40d154cc8c5b339abdd400b6d09d399bc372ec57","d9cf9b5fa53b7766ed4619c3d4cab8b1527b6860","7d68a4ef001f798a6fdbee4307f885fdcc8a2b8d","28f6e390b6f565f56455af3a463628e769a103ec"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Magnitude of national ED visits and resource utilization by the uninsured.","doi":"10.1016/j.ajem.2013.01.001","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajem.2013.01.001","venue":"The American journal of emergency medicine"}

For controlling drug delivery via oral administration, emodin (EMO) encapsulated micelles were loaded into sodium alginate hydrogel matrix to construct the pH-sensitive hydrogel/micelle composites. The optimized formulation of micelle that consists of 8.06% CaCl2, 1.71% chitosan and 26.52% β-GP was obtained by the combination of Box-Behnken experimental design and response surface methodology. The morphological analysis showed that the micelles exhibited a smaller diameter of about 80nm in aqueous solution, but dilated to 100-200nm in hydrogel owing to the formation of polyelectrolyte complexes. The physical characteristics in simulated digestive fluids were investigated, demonstrating that the ratio of hydrogel to micelle distinctly affected swelling, degradation and in vitro drug release behaviors. The hydrogel/micelle (1:1) exhibited a sustained-release profile, while hydrogel/micelle (3:1) exhibited a colon-specific profile. Their corresponding release mechanisms revealed that the release of drug from these two formulations followed a complex process, in which several mechanisms were involved or occurred simultaneously. These results demonstrated that the pH-sensitive hydrogel/micelle composites constructed with biocompatible materials can be a promising sustained-release or site-specific drug delivery system for instable or hydrophobic drugs.","inCitations":["a077eb88abac5638cd43d0ce742c60ceda6990ec","f559c09db76912810355d2a24d505cf2b2e3279c","799f122ef7fbaa92cdc563c7319932e0a2995726","acdf18fdaa9394e7200bf378bee0d4dca721bfb1","be313cd5f12963b461b0c5fb3414387d4d5e0128","147a9a054e516318464e627529784a6f0ca6dbb3","22b4fcfe2b4224569ba5945c72012fc1a205a7cb","bf393c7b1958936452615e3ab61bd0186191eb2f","e25548d5bc209d95c0981860fd6fe0db6b57782f","9ee9ee64a1267630f56de0b20b6a6ef4e871b255","e3b5016d8d877826abe04583902bf84d3b607911"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"A novel controlled drug delivery system based on alginate hydrogel/chitosan micelle composites.","doi":"10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2017.09.065","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2017.09.065","venue":"International journal of biological macromolecules"}

Materials and Methods: Mosquito allergens were extracted from Culex quinquefasciatus using two different methods, sonication and homogenization. Protein concentrations, protein profiles, and endotoxin levels in the extracts prepared by the two methods were determined. Results: The protein concentrations measured by Bradford (results in mg/mL) and Kjeldahl (results in Protein Nitrogen Units, PNU) assays in the extracts prepared by the sonication method were 0.92 0.08 mg/mL and 74700 4934 PNU, respectively. These results were significantly higher than those in the extracts prepared by the homogenization method (0.64 0.01 mg/mL and 41330 8231 PNU). The protein fingerprint showed more protein in the extracts prepared by sonication than in those prepared by homogenization. The endotoxin levels in the extracts from both methods were clinically acceptable, and there was no bacterial contamination. Conclusion: Sonication provides mosquito allergen extracts with higher quantities of proteins and better protein composition than homogenization. การเปรยบเทยบวธการสกดสารกอภมแพจากยงโดยวธ sonication และวธ homogenization วตถประสงค: เพอพฒนาวธการสกดสารกภมแพขจากยง โดยทำการเปรยบเทยบระหวางวธ sonication และ homogenization วสดและวธการ: ไดเตรยมนำยาสกดสารกอภมแพจากยง โดยใช 2 วธทแตกตางกน คอ วธ sonication และวธ homogenization จากนนวดปรมาณโปรตนในนำยาสกดโดยวธ Bradford assay (mg/mL) และวธ Kjeldahl method (PNU, Protien Nitrogen Unit) ซงเปนหนวยทใชกนอยางแพรหลายในทางคลนก ศกษาองคประกอบของโปรตนในนำยาสกดโดยการทำ gel eletrophoresis ตรวจวดปรมาณ endotoxin และการปนเปอนของเชอแบคทเรย ผลการศกษา: นำยาสกดสารกอภมแพจากยงทสกดโดยวธ sonication พบวาคาเฉลยปรมาณโปรตน เมอวดดวย Bradford assay (mg/mL) และวธ Kjeldahl method เทากบ 0.92 0.08 mg/mL และ 74700 4934 PNU ตามลำดบ ซงสงกวานำยาสกดทไดจากการสกดดวยวธ homogenization ทมคาเฉลยปรมาณโปรตน คอ 0.64 0.01 mg/mL และ 41330 8231 PNU ตามลำดบ นำยาทสกดดวยวธ sonication ใหองคประกอบโปรตนทหลากหลายกวา ในขณะทปรมาณ endotoxin ของนำยาสกดทไดจากทง 2 วธอยในมาตรฐานการใชงานทางคลก รวมถงไมมการปนเปอนเชอแบคทเรย สรป: นำยาสกดสารกอภมแพทไดจากวธ sonication สามารถสกดโปรตนกอภมแพไดปรมาณและองคประกอบทหลากหลายมากกวา เมอเปรยบเทยบกบการสกดโดยวธ homogenization อกทงยงลดปรมาณของสารเคมและเวลาทใชในการสกดอกดวย","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://www.tci-thaijo.org/index.php/ramajournal/article/download/80045/63844"],"title":"A Comparison between Sonication and Homogenization Methods for Extraction of Mosquito Allergens","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Both positive samplestested positive for the type B neurotoxin gene (bont/B). In parallel, heat-resistant spores of thermophilic bacteria that are likely to be associated with canned food spoilage after prolonged incubation at 55 °C were surveyed after specific enrichment. Prevalence varied between 1.6% for Moorella thermoacetica/thermoautotrophica in green bean samples and 8.6% for either Geobacillus stearothermophilus or Thermoanaerobacterium spp. in carrot samples. Vegetable preparation, e.g. washing and edge cutting, considerably reduced spore contamination levels. These data constitute the first wide examination of vegetables specifically cultivated for industrialpurposes for their contamination by spores of thermophilic bacterial species.","inCitations":["165d5b6dbde7597c3f090805751790d6f2bae646","ffb68d859f5d953459691f53025416f44809c680","30458d0f3c9b5cdb1fe265fef68fb99db46aab87","f6f52fe03c450aa9bbebb6f00348479568b3fd7f","2d851215cfbdffc3b8afff96091786e9a81db29a","d72f3e258d49289ebac6ec6bf804a4fc9377eee5","f081b7e0404b6df19d81c54d5823c2c68ecab39a","13b79855be9d036e9cfb661723b730fc4c702322","850db4cd841df91e32b3e5a0c4fbd94234bf7a0c","a4a87a3bfd4f3dad9049790bbca4dbd04af3a50f","dc1445d6ede12dc6ebd278a1a1121fe7b8adc00e","22ee0fb47a08dd04bd622ac5239f2461138b63db","e50bb37a663dfd3ec817df05afc335d76f0ce00b"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Prevalence of Clostridium botulinum and thermophilic heat-resistant spores in raw carrots and green beans used in French canning industry.","doi":"10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2012.02.009","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2012.02.009","venue":"International journal of food microbiology"}

These pathogens are transmitted from reservoirs to secondary hosts through the bite of arthropod vectors including lice and fleas. Once in the secondary host, the bacteria cause a variety of pathologies including cat-scratch disease, endocarditis, and myocarditis. Reservoirs of these bacteria are numerous and include several species of large mammals, mesocarnivores, and small mammals. Research on reservoirs of these bacteria has focused on western North America, Europe, and Asia, with little focus on the eastern and central United States. We assessed the prevalence of zoonotic Bartonella species among prairie-dwelling rodent species in the midwestern United States. Tissue samples (n = 700) were collected between 2015 and 2017 from five rodent species and screened for the presence of Bartonella DNA via PCR and sequencing of two loci using Bartonella-specific primers. Bartonella were prevalent among all five species, with 13-lined ground squirrels (Ictidomys tridecemlineatus) serving as a likely reservoir of the pathogen B. washoensis, and other rodents serving as reservoirs of the pathogens B. grahamii and B. vinsonii subsp. arupensis. These results demonstrate the value of studies of disease ecology in grassland systems, particularly in the context of habitat restoration and human–vector interactions.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Prevalence of zoonotic Bartonella among prairie rodents in Illinois","doi":"10.1093/jmammal/gyz164","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1093/jmammal%2Fgyz164","venue":"Journal of Mammalogy"}

Low frequency here means an interrogating acoustical wave frequency of less than half of the ‘half-wavelength resonance frequency' of the thin layer depending on the acoustical impedance ratio of the coating to the substrate. Equations for the frequency-shifts are derived and solved by the Newton iterative method and the Taylor expansion method, respectively, indicating satisfactory agreement within the range of interest of thickness ratio of the thin layer to the substrate for a polymer-aluminium structure.

Despite these efforts, there are few indicators of success: many consider PNG’s public service to be rife with corruption. However, narratives about these problems have excluded public servants’ perspectives: there is little empirical data about why public servants might support or resist corruption and poor governance. This paper draws on interviews with 136 public servants across four provinces – Eastern Highlands, Milne Bay, Madang and New Ireland – to provide insights into what PNG’s bureaucrats think about these issues. It finds that public servants are often ill-informed about the laws and rules guiding their roles, and are under enormous pressure to provide unofficial favours to businesses, politicians and kith and kin. Yet, some are able to resist these pressures better than others, with senior staff, men, and those in Milne Bay and Madang better placed to push back against and report corruption. Findings suggest that policies that aim to support and inform the less enfranchised (women and junior staff) are particularly important for addressing corruption in PNG. However, this paper argues that efforts to shift the status quo must take into account the contextually-specific relationships between bureaucrats, politicians and citizens, which vary across time and space.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Governance and Corruption in PNG’s Public Service: Insights From Four Subnational Administrations","doi":"10.2139/ssrn.3365319","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3365319","venue":""}

The present experiments investigated the effects of heptanol, a reversible gap junction inhibitor, on isolated Langendorff-perfused rabbit hearts. The introduction and withdrawal of heptanol inhibited both pressure generation and electrical conduction. These effects were completely reversible. Possible mechanisms for these findings were investigated through measurement of the concentration dependence of heptanol's effects upon conduction velocity and repolarization duration. Low concentrations of heptanol (less than 0.3 mM) caused small but significant increases in the delay between the stimulus (delivered to the basal septum) artefact and local activation of the left ventricle, as measured from bipolar electrogram (BEG) recordings. There was a steep increase in the latency between stimulus and left-ventricular activation at concentrations of heptanol above 0.3 mM. These findings are explicable by earlier reports of heptanol actions on gap junctions in vitro and modelling studies of the effects of reduced gap junction conductance on conduction velocity. Heptanol decreased repolarization duration, measured from the activation recovery interval (ARI) of BEGs, and monophasic action potential duration at 70% repolarization (MAPD70). Heptanol also reduced left-ventricular developed pressure (LVDP), and the maximum rates of contraction and relaxation of the left ventricle; these effects were concentration dependent and reversible. However, changes in ARIs, LVDP and the maximum rates of change of pressure lacked the steep response to 0.3–1.0 mM heptanol shown by the latency. These other effects are therefore likely to be mediated by cellular targets other than gap junctions. Perfusion of hearts with heptanol was also associated with a high incidence of arrhythmias. During premature stimulation protocols arrhythmias could be induced in hearts perfused with 0.1–0.3 mM heptanol but not at higher concentrations. This suggests that there is a critical range of slowed conduction that permits the development of re-entrant arrhythmias in the normal heart, although the effects of heptanol on repolarization duration may also contribute to its pro-arrhythmic activity.","inCitations":["25ad990ebe8ba64b812665fde56638b94c09c6a0","919ff87829ea5ec1408386f6c7ccac3630b0ff2b","a02fec26ad613da29ac95aabf75cafa87ab1e325","5d39f9350e211458f5fab2323be8d39b515135ee","535361bb117a1db7257bded6f30826250b6d74b3","ab7a866fcf911b216fc91bffa52bb4a83c3cd4ac","ab812a523770181b80e95ff4664b2fd6e2c4e89d","ad5e423817b7aae683ee8be3830d4c5e58efe985","98d55186450e2d446e073bb2e0c4f8d4f271b3e0","c853085e2599a29e0a8156fdc9c0c93cdfceb8f6","1a4a3bd06709537e67e56d01a05902ed925d54a7"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"The effect of heptanol on the electrical and contractile function of the isolated, perfused rabbit heart","doi":"10.1007/s004240000264","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s004240000264","venue":"Pflügers Archiv"}

Data were collected from neighboring J. osteosperma and A. tridentata plants in northern Colorado and included measurements of different size classes of J. osteosperma: short ( 3 m). Short J. osteosperma switched from utilizing shallow to primarily deep water sources across the growing season. Artemisia tridentata had root traits associated with faster root proliferation and resource acquisition (significantly greater specific root length and smaller root diameter, p   .1). Additionally, we found that short J. osteosperma individuals can quickly develop deep root systems, but there is little difference in belowground foraging between individuals of J. osteosperma and A. tridentata based on the depth of water uptake and root length density.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://mountainscholar.org/bitstream/handle/10217/176736/Chesus_colostate_0053N_13777.pdf?isAllowed=y&sequence=1"],"title":"Analyzing root traits to characterize juniper expansion into Rangelands","doi":"10.1016/j.jaridenv.2017.12.010","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaridenv.2017.12.010","venue":""}

The engine was powered with two fuels: Hydrogen (H2) as inducted fuel along with air and diesel/Biodiesel fuel (BDF) as injected fuel. Diesel and BDF were injected into the cylinder using common rail direct injection (CRDI) facility developed. Electronic control unit (ECU) was developed to inject the fuel at any required crank angle (CA) for any magnitude of duration. At 80% load, engine operation was associated with severe knocking without exhaust gas recirculation (EGR), however engine operated well only for EGR percentage about 50% and 54% with diesel and BDFs respectively. Beyond this EGR level, HCCI engine showed misfiring and unstable combustion. At this condition, maximum HFER possible was less than 8% in both diesel and biodiesel HCCI operations and misfiring occurred beyond HFER of 8%. The maximum brake thermal efficiency (BTE) of 31.5%, 30.6% and 30.2% were reported with diesel, honge biodiesel (BHO) and cotton seed biodiesel (BCO) respectively in diesel hydrogen HCCI (DHHCCI) and biodiesel hydrogen HCCI (BHHCCI) modes. At 80% load, HCCI engine powered with BDFs showed 65–67% lower smoke, and 98–99% lower NOx emissions with HFER of 7% and EGR of 54% as compared to conventional compression ignition (CI) mode. However this engine operation resulted in nearly 11 times higher HC emissions with HFER of 7% and EGR of 54%. Hence HCCI mode of engine operation could be a feasible technological option to minimize the pollution levels besides improving the fuel economy.","inCitations":["5f0088c7316f32be3ba9188086cef9375a2328e8","a85ecb231cf287eb3964ce755a83eb20a97d533d","de27b0178599ded4332e29c914ec155ef50e68ac"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Performance studies on homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI) engine powered with alternative fuels","doi":"10.1016/j.renene.2018.08.035","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2018.08.035","venue":""}

However, acquired resistance, due partially to secondary mutations limits their use. Here we report that NSCLC cells with acquired resistance to gefitinib or osimertinib (AZD9291) exhibit EMT features, with a decrease in E-cadherin, and increases in vimentin and stemness, without possessing any EGFR secondary mutations. Knockdown of E-cadherin in parental cells increased gefitinib resistance and stemness, while knockdown of vimentin in resistant cells resulted in opposite effects. Src activation and Hakai upregulation were found in gefitinib-resistant cells. Knockdown of Hakai elevated E-cadherin expression, attenuated stemness, and resensitized the cells to gefitinib. Clinical cancer specimens with acquired gefitinib resistance also showed a decrease in E-cadherin and an increase in Hakai expression. The dual HDAC and HMGR inhibitor JMF3086 inhibited the Src/Hakai and Hakai/E-cadherin interaction to reverse E-cadherin expression, and attenuated vimentin and stemness to restore gefitinib sensitivity. The EMT features of AZD9291-resistant H1975 cells were related to the upregulation of Zeb1. Both gefitinib and AZD9291 sensitivity was restored by JMF3086 through reversing EMT. Our study not only revealed a common mechanism of EMT in both gefitinib and AZD9291 resistance beyond EGFR mutations per se, but also provides a new strategy to overcome it.","inCitations":["6a287202f8fe5740658cb7292c50376308b92368","63273471fdb6c2bca0421f45e49b594324a08f95","4dc3e8d8eb525ec4760f7d9f419218a16e295d16","8f491f42a0b3d42cbbc7d4f0fa0acb593fa94eb4","3be6a5372a959dffa88b79866550f2a35386f320","2df145dfcc9aa22b40108c9b6152f758a278ea95","cb35f8cb0615745ab0cbfc7bca7d1d2da2df64d8","cf2d34dc3d1cd09ac2a189e0cd1132e82f8dc42d","c5ea1efba451f9b3b4f5d9d1dba08a9b65c9d27f","55b99a1804739ac762fff628da704bed389b6a61","ad6f7fe17a94762003598a4324186b95f61dffa8","33f45a546ca1186909eb65bd0cdfe90fb5a62e7f","da4254cbdfb999f287b597c7db1c2a030e3374a6","fd8140834b37d43b4cefe1b5abcab19b4aec3acf","412f5087df602aed6705203a67490049c19cd6b7","f90ae2b531e4ee22ba7f8c538399757d44793d76"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) beyond EGFR mutations per se is a common mechanism for acquired resistance to EGFR TKI","doi":"10.1038/s41388-018-0454-2","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41388-018-0454-2","venue":"Oncogene"}

Motivation and introduction In a recent papers [2–4] authors studied means obtained by a limiting iterative process of two means in a following way. Let M and N be two bivariate means and s , t real positive numbers. By bivariate mean we consider function F : R + × R + → R + such that min (s, t) ≤ F (s, t) ≤ max (s, t) . Then, we define iterative algorithm: M 0 (s, t) = s, N 0 (s, t) = t, M n (s, t) = M(M n −1 , N n −1 ) , N n (s, t) = N(M n −1 , N n −1 ) , n ≥ 1 . (1.1) If both of these sequences converge to the same limit, this common value is called the compound mean of s and t and is denoted by M N ( s , t ). This is also sometimes called the Gaussian product of means, in difference to the Archimedean product defined by the iterations M n = M(M n −1 , N n −1 ) , N n = N(M n , N n −1 ) . More details about this concept, existence and some properties of compound means can be found in [1, Ch. VI.3] . The well-known example of compound mean is arithmetic–geometric mean A G . This is an interesting mean obtained by the limiting process: A 0 = s, G 0 = t, A n = A n −1 + G n −1 , G n = √ A n −1 G n −1 , n ≥ 1 . (1.2) 2 ∗ Corresponding author.

Buri ́c, N. Elezovi ́c / Applied Mathematics and Computation 303 (2017) 48–54 49 This mean was studied a long ago by Gauss, but it is still research subject of many mathematicians. Namely, this method is used to construct efficient algorithms for computing classical constants, elementary transcendental functions and elliptic integrals. The problem with compound means is that they rarely have closed explicit form and it is not easy to prove relations and inequalities to other means. So it is useful to find another way of representing these means. The asymptotic expansion of the mean M ( s , t ) is a representation of mean in a form M(x + s, x + t) = x ∞ ∑ n =0 c n (s, t) x −n , x → ∞ , (1.3) where c n ( s , t ) are polynomials of the degree n in variables s and t . We consider homogeneous means, that is M(λs, λt) = λM(s, t) , in which case c n ( s , t ) are homogeneous polynomials. Treating homogeneous functions in asymptotic settings is quite common, as an example, asymptotic expansion of the tail of chaos of Gaussian random vectors is derived in a recent paper [12] . The technique of developing asymptotic expansions of means is presented in a series of recently published papers [5–10] . This new method is successfully used in the comparison of classical means and establishing various relations between means, see cited papers for details. In [4] , authors derived asymptotic expansion of the arithmetic–geometric mean and convergence and stationary properties of coefficients in this expansion were studied. Later, in [3] , this was generalised to the compound of any two power means. Recall that the arithmetic and geometric mean are special cases of the p th power mean M p defined by M p (s, t) = { ( s p + t p 2 ) 1 p , p = 0 , √ st , p = 0 . (1.4) In [3] , author derived and analysed asymptotic behaviour of the compound mean M p M q . This mean exists for all real p , q and is equal to some power mean M r if and only if p + q = 0 = r, that is, it is equal to geometric mean, see also [1, p. 414] . Fast convergence and stationary properties of this iterative process were proved. Main aim of this paper is to generalise this iterative process to arbitrary means M and N , that is, to present algorithms for computing coefficients in the asymptotic expansion of arbitrary compound mean M N . We will show that asymptotic representation of the compound mean can be easily obtained from the known asymptotic expansions of its components and once this representation is known, it can be used for comparison of means and also for numerical calculation in an efficient way. First, in the next section, we will obtain an algorithm for calculating coefficients in the asymptotic expansion of arbitrary composite mean of two means. Then, in the third chapter, we will apply this result to the iterative process (1.1) and analyse asymptotic behaviour of the arbitrary compound mean. We will show that the stationary and fast convergence properties hold in this general case. Finally, we will present some concrete examples and comparison of compound means in the last chapter. In the sequel, the following fundamental lemma for transformation of power of asymptotic series will be crucial. The coefficients of the new series depend on the power p and initial sequence ( a n ), it will be denoted here as P [ n , p , a ]. For proof and analysis in the context of formal power series, see [13, Theorem 1.6c] . We shall rather use it in the context of asymptotic series, see [5] for details. Lemma 1.1. Let a 0 = 0 and g ( x ) function with asymptotic expansion (as x → ∞ ): g(x ) ∼ ∞ ∑ n =0 a n x −n . Then for all real r it holds [ g(x )] r ∼ ∞ ∑ n =0 P [ n, r, a ] x −n , where P [0 , r, a ] = a r 0 and P [ n, r, a ] = 1 na 0 n ∑ k =1 [ k (1 + r) − n ] a k P [ n − k, r, a ] . (1.5) 2. Asymptotic expansion of the composite mean It is shown in [6,7] that better form of the coefficients in the asymptotic expansion of the mean (1.3) is obtained through variables α and β where t = α + β, s = α − β. (2.1) 50 T. Buri ́c, N. Elezovi ́c / Applied Mathematics and Computation 303 (2017) 48–54 In this case we have M(x + α − β, x + α + β) = x ∞ ∑ n =0 c n (α, β) x −n , and now we can take in (1.3) s = −β and t = β: M(x − β, x + β) = x ∞ ∑ n =0 c n (−β, β) x −n . (2.2) Since c n are homogeneous polynomials of degree n , it follows M(x − β, x + β) = x ∞ ∑ n =0 γn β n x −n , (2.3) for some constants ( γ n ). Let us start then with the asymptotic expansions of two given means M and N in the following form: M(x − t, x + t) = ∞ ∑ k =0 a k t k x −k +1 , N(x − t, x + t) = ∞ ∑ k =0 b k t k x −k +1 , (2.4) and let F denote arbitrary mean with the asymptotic expansion F (x − t, x + t) = ∞ ∑ k =0 γk t k x −k +1 . (2.5) We shall derive an algorithm for calculating coefficients in the asymptotic expansion of the composition H = F (M, N) . First, the arguments of the function F will be written in the form (x − t, x + t) for some choice of the variables x and t . Hence, for the first argument we should take the sum α = 1 2 (M + N) = ∞ ∑ k =0 c k t k x −k +1 , (2.6) where it holds c 0 = 1 and c k = 1 2 (a k + b k ) . (2.7) The second argument should be β = 1 2 (M − N) = t −z x −z ∞ ∑ k =0 d k t k x −k +1 . (2.8) Here z is the smallest number with the property d 0 = 0, where the sequence ( d k ) is defined by d k = 1 2 (a k + z − b k + z ) . (2.9) Since both means begin with the first term equal to x , it follows z ≥ 1. Now, we have H(x − t, x + t) = F (α − β, α + β) = ∞ ∑ k =0 γk β k α−k +1 = ∞ ∑ k =0 γk t −zk x −zk ( ∞ ∑ j=0 d j t j x − j+1 )k ( ∞ ∑ j=0 c j t j x − j+1 )−k +1 . Substituting asymptotic series into expansion of function F is justified by the properties of asymptotic series, for details see [11, p. 20] . Namely, it holds ( N ∑ j=0 d j t j x − j+1 + o(x −N+1 ) )k ( N ∑ j=0 c j t j x − j+1 + o(x −N+1 ) )−k +1 = N ∑ j=0 e j t j x − j+1 + o ( x (−N+1) k · x (−N+1)(−k +1) ) = N ∑ j=0 e j t j x − j+1 + o(x −N+1 ) , T. Buri ́c, N. Elezovi ́c / Applied Mathematics and Computation 303 (2017) 48–54 51 where new coefficients e j are obtained by formal substitution and a rearrangement of terms. Therefore, using Lemma 1.1 , we have H(x − t, x + t) = ∞ ∑ k =0 γk t −zk x −zk ( ∞ ∑ j=0 P [ j, k, d] t j x − j+1 )( ∞ ∑ j=0 P [ j, −k + 1 , c] t j x − j+1 ) = ∞ ∑ k =0 γk t −zk x −zk ∞ ∑ i =0 ( i ∑ j=0 P [ j, k, d] P [ i − j, −k + 1 , c] ) t i x −i +1 = ∞ ∑ n =0 ( n/z ∑ k =0 γk n −zk ∑ j=0 P [ j, k, d] P [ n − zk − j, −k + 1 , c] ) t n x −n +1 . We shall formulate this result in the following theorem. Theorem 2.1. Let M and N be given homogeneous means with asympotic expansions M(x − t, x + t) = ∞ ∑ k =0 a k t k x −k +1 , N(x − t, x + t) = ∞ ∑ k =0 b k t k x −k +1 , and let F be arbitrary homogeneous mean with expansion F (x − t, x + t) = ∞ ∑ k =0 γk t k x −k +1 . Then the composition H = F (M, N) has asymptotic expansion H(x − t, x + t) = ∞ ∑ n =0 h n t n x −n +1 , (2.10) where coefficients ( h n ) are calculated by h n = n/z ∑ k =0 γk n −zk ∑ j=0 P [ j, k, d] P [ n − zk − j, −k + 1 , c] . (2.11) Sequences ( c n ) and ( d n ) are defined by c n = 1 2 (a n + b n ) , d n = 1 2 (a n + z − b n + z ) , (2.12) where z is the smallest number such that d n = 0 . As a consequence of this theorem, we shall also give the following result for the symmetric means which are mostly studied when dealing with various means. In that case M(s, t) = M(t, s ) and in asymptotic expansion (2.2) it follows c 2 k +1 = 0 , hence we have M(x − β, x + β) = x ∞ ∑ k =0 γk β 2 k x −2 k . (2.13) Theorem 2.2. Let M and N be given homogeneous symmetric means with asymptotic expansions M(x − t, x + t) = ∞ ∑ k =0 a k t 2 k x −2 k +1 , N(x − t, x + t) = ∞ ∑ k =0 b k t 2 k x −2 k +1 , and let F be homogeneous symmetric mean with expansion F (x − t, x + t) = ∞ ∑ k =0 γk t 2 k x −2 k +1 . Then the composition H = F (M, N) has asymptotic expansion H(x − t, x + t) = ∞ ∑ n =0 h n t 2 n x −2 n +1 , (2.14) where coefficients ( h n ) are calculated by h n = n/ 2 z ∑ k =0 γk n −2 zk ∑ j=0 P [ j, 2 k, d] P [ n − 2 zk − j, −2 k + 1 , c] . (2.15) 52 T. Buri ́c, N. Elezovi ́c / Applied Mathematics and Computation 303 (2017) 48–54 Sequences ( c n ) and ( d n ) are defined by c n = 1 2 (a n + b n ) , d n = 1 2 (a n + z − b n + z ) , (2.16) where z is the smallest number such that d n = 0 . 3.

Under the scenario of global competitiveness and dictative customer centric markets Indian SME’s which are backbone to Indian GDP, especially, automobile industries are striving hard for survival. These industries are slow in adopting and practising performance and efficiency based derives. In this context, waste elimination derives related to man, material, machine and method have been studied for  providing a competitive advantage and adding  fuel in enriching the bottomline of Indian SME’s.Fifty companies were surveyed by questionnaire and personal contact. Main findings of this article comprises of highlighting the present status of understanding the essence of subject matter, assessing the inadequacy of initiative taken by various companies and evaluating the hurdles in implementing waste management.Furthermore, findings lead to conclusion that imbueding the culture of waste elimination as a building block, organisations not only create revenue but also create value for the customers and end-users. It has been suggested that involvement of top management to push waste elimination derives at multi-levels in organisation will act as a catalyst in recuperating competitiveness and pulling off substantial wealth creation. Use of Information technology will excel the speed of such derives.

This report presents the epidemiology of measles in Canada between 2002 and 2013 and its implications in sustaining measles elimination. Methods.  Cases included individuals reported to the Canadian Measles and Rubella Surveillance System with confirmed measles. Results.  In Canada, 1171 cases of measles were reported between 2002 and 2013 (incidence 0.29 cases per 100 000 population). The annual number of cases ranged from 6 to 752. The majority of cases were unvaccinated (63%) or had an unknown vaccination status (19%). The median age of cases was 14.4 years (range, <1 to 63 years) globally and 14 years when excluding the 2011 outbreak in Quebec where 68% of the 678 cases were 10 to 19 years old. With the exclusion of this outbreak, the incidence was highest in infants (1.0 per 100 000), lower but fairly similar between 1 and 19 years of age (0.2 to 0.4 per 100 000), and there was a substantial decline between 20 and 39 years of age (0.1 per 100 000). There was a significant trend towards a greater annual number of importations over the period. Although importations resulted in no transmission sustained for ≥12 months, 5 chains of transmission had >30 cases. The effective reproductive number between 2002 and 2013 was estimated at 0.86 (95% confidence interval, .81-.92). Conclusions.  Canada has maintained elimination between 2002 and 2013, but additional efforts are needed to reduce the proportion of unimmunized individuals and respond to importation events.","inCitations":["fbd126b3707e881ad816fc6b0aa9a3917badc13e","2b9f234cfd631a02b756876eabb64edb900893ca","bcdaf4544f8f0f515f410104987c41c6548e3f95","61ffe0ac22853bd3606664a755427b8608b34e55","d953756fd9aff908fb9f65a6e02ec79190b61d39"],"pdfUrls":["https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/pmc/oa_pdf/c6/ce/ofv048.PMC4473108.pdf","http://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/pmc/c6/ce/ofv048.PMC4473108.pdf"],"title":"Measles in Canada Between 2002 and 2013","doi":"10.1093/ofid/ofv048","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1093/ofid%2Fofv048","venue":"Open forum infectious diseases"}

In order to successfully perform such adaptation, it is crucial to first identify characteristics that influence an individual user's effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction with a particular information visualization type. In this paper, we present a study that focuses on investigating the impact of four user characteristics (perceptual speed, verbal working memory, visual working memory, and user expertise) on the effectiveness of two common data visualization techniques: bar graphs and radar graphs. Our results show that certain user characteristics do in fact have a significant effect on task efficiency, user preference, and ease of use. We conclude with a discussion of how our findings could be effectively used for an adaptive visualization system.","inCitations":["a2b55650e57c6d57cab0fdd7b7d649ec032915a9","ab72850fd15c2b666bc8f3d9337a208ee48c9bd8","7ff232dd8f61f9e4851b82e11bb70eb119c51e21","b5656a32f1386d0c58a3e1984f6226e89d9c3829","bb83ee5858b00e3f2cba0ed75ca1b9125ba5deda","27366f8d352971baddd3e2f6000d6d6fba80e017","01cfdba987d452092adb07c7e7e81f9ab893da84","a0eee0a43283681c7b83f90dfdc0237097d3163b","8d5c9d25fcf1ca9ded93fc074ca55418987dcb99","2496033e492604ba9145de0bc861a0a287d3f712","bd6f07a9f25be9460ce62e096063839eca73072e","79ff22ebc4685c1fa79141a6f532a934401fc405","fde7a38332e2d2b9d42a85aed870f735ed11320e","6d441b860c39e08d03ef1340b17753cb4580bd94","279d1176a3602dd6a58d9c4dcb15035e5e4f30bb","9b5e84bf221137ece08be3679e21b71c09be60c1","8c4ad17797dfb6b176bb730f7dc21eadc2501a75","817d00da7107f7c17c49cb9b22f34138486ade55","3c0b5ec7b40ed5e2ccec77ef2804a60689156bd0","3789b3acab85af2241e924f13b64d186784e1771","697797a10b65a96cf55e9159f42fd05b0a0a9f74","4337f10334493aa95a5989c72d7fba21982b451e","4ac08ebb9e07edf15b96822a5c8827de75bde925","e1465c4c9c3eb005147412c7b4ede93394ea646a","c3aaf89db0096cdff48b2ff8dc9e5824701d9258","82a1cd72318050b5934500c551ac5f5bdf4fdf50","4be0650cb19a3eefcbfa313344e7eea761d40109","e587a0f0a8338c81d9915e7e9b7eff5976348f69","f95bc88ffc6001cb805bf1dce41f9aa36853742c","a705e37db3506a5bf610af499a4ad7a0eb4f0c4f","aa56d5217d905c7c04aeb7ee0891262f3a13e97e","d05ed81874764f7c28400c26eccadc5daf466005","5e22940e3b86df9269e5f628673771f5adcc139c","9ad8cf525513e2b6d0a988cf9517bdd481b81225","091f55e39effde8b9d4ac00e3960768817cba0df","cacffc1eaf987cc02f84c36fe7d851662f2ffd4e","54e2d760133f22da3a37f363c1dbc2e19a4adeea","6b9f992f23d8dd48ada670b3306d977690e79c4f","36498511594cb86eda71496429f82e0dc7894af3","86c144c40b0baebddaaf313d1e5205992b243a97","5756477c9f7da0c0ad480aef74d9267ae0436a12","5960614f3e61185745acc22876c997985250291e","0a5ec309fbfa3d2e9a9ae084449cabbc6a11d3e6","6434372bdb568dcba8bc63bbb63f4911ff3a5084","3b92d1a28bbc522cd8b9d5db6a36ff3aa14d99dc","da9655f13a1296e142fe8484341b61330f7ea63f","e380ebedc2274642de7ab6321437282de305ed38","7292640831488b6c52ddc72be383dbae3d9e049c","618b97ccf1f803d6351b603a1f938a228cd366ad","0afdd70cfc367f299d8ef97f1aa5c1bf7db43192","2aa04233b3a7c8f5c9fbb213f201f5c6f97a3a57","d577865eaecc46872a12ce509558f6ce56081bd5","6763a04353b9616f4afee4a4e4f7482e49bfcfdd","5f846bc6a710f2fd067f47de0571aa452fe82261","d2dda8e7f6221bb1db1139aa7715d86c3a97b8f1","d34ad507bc7205d061d08ccde623bedc8d7b9d50","a0c6ff76f6d9b8a8df884ec94ab70dc6cff17aac","d97dbe53001dc075b221b5f29a21a6e8298d05db","3ba2d2df553137b9614f3d8ae5abb83afa19f83e","b1caef1dbd41c718881f086fc3014ceeba4b9974","d9052795ba9af834722f852368d39c31f77aea4b"],"pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-31454-4_23","http://monaharaty.com/drupal-6.14/files/webfm/Papers/adaptiveInfoVis-umap2012.pdf","http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~conati/my-papers/UMAP2012_CameraReady.pdf","http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~carenini/PAPERS/UMAP2012_v13_CameraReady.pdf","http://people.cs.ubc.ca/~carenini/PAPERS/UMAP2012_v13_CameraReady.pdf","http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~dtoker/publications/toker_umap2012.pdf"],"title":"Towards adaptive information visualization: on the influence of user characteristics","doi":"10.1007/978-3-642-31454-4_23","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-31454-4_23","venue":"UMAP"}

In this study we take advantage of High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) imagery as well as Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) derived DEMs of the Pathfinder landing site to study regional hillslopes at resolutions many times greater than previously available and compare them with Mars Pathfinder lander images. This site was thought to be modified by massive flooding 1.8–3.5 byr ago and although evidence of flood activity was not obvious at the finer scale of this study, possible lee deposits and terracing were seen in some of the features. Evidence of post flood processes of ice related creep, aeolian and dry mass wasting were observed at the site and have likely obscured flood related morphology present in these features. Regional slopes were found to vary with aspect and suggest processes intensities operating at different orientations, possibly related to the prevailing wind direction, as well as the origin of the ancient flood event.","inCitations":["c926fcb479bb3b42750114ac05f3d2667aa1bf6c","c46444ceb62cb25edaccecd8f10df63cb5808eac","a2da5a2162d6fc44a66df89c21d3c59ece12a9e1"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Slope morphology of hills at the Mars Pathfinder landing site","doi":"10.1016/j.icarus.2011.04.007","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.icarus.2011.04.007","venue":""}

A warning note is sounded about the current concern of I.M.C.O. with gas carriers and its proposals for a construction code for these ships. Mention is made of the Classification Societies' work in tank structure; its attitude towards dispensation of the secondary barrier and its concern with such important safety matters as free surface effects, membrane damage, temperature control and spilled liquid. The paper draws attention to the high safety record for this class of ship.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Some Aspects of the Classification of Low Temperature Gas Carriers","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}
