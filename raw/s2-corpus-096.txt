An argument is given that τ=1+d_{B}/2≈1.822 for backbone holes, where d_{B} is the backbone dimension. On the other hand, a model of simple holes within a percolation cluster yields τ=1+d_{f}/2=187/96≈1.948, where d_{f} is the fractal dimension of the cluster, and this value is consistent with the experimental results of gel collapse of Sheinman et al., which give τ=1.91(6). This suggests that the gel clusters are of the universality class of percolation cluster holes. Both models give a discontinuous maximum hole size at p_{c}, signifying explosive percolation behavior.","inCitations":["57e17792477cabd6ee44d8fc5676b399981152c1","29113f4aa1364a679e6a91992444e0c1257c05cb","a6652166f861424006f7b64496ba0f3855e4988f"],"pdfUrls":["https://www.condmatjclub.org/jccm-content/uploads/2016/12/JCCM_December_2016_01.pdf","https://arxiv.org/pdf/1605.03685v1.pdf"],"title":"No-Enclave Percolation Corresponds to Holes in the Cluster Backbone.","doi":"10.1103/PhysRevLett.117.185701","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.117.185701","venue":"Physical review letters"}

Recent studies have shown that applying uniform multi-bit retention registers (MBRRs) can reduce the storage size, and hence save more chip area and leakage power compared with single-bit retention registers. In this paper, a new problem formulation of power-gated circuit optimization with nonuniform MBRRs is studied for achieving even more storage saving and higher storage utilization. An ILP-based approach is proposed to effectively explore different combinations of nonuniform MBRR replacement. Experiment results show that the proposed approach can reduce 36% storage size, compared with the state-of-the-art uniform MBRR replacement, while achieving 100% storage utilization.","inCitations":["da1c5be7eed3b80a0b759c38fb83645b27fbb1fc","feaa045c4607f439a7d1d28e3ab04b8d0ec4bcca"],"pdfUrls":["http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3199781"],"title":"State retention for power gated design with non-uniform multi-bit retention latches","doi":"10.1109/ICCAD.2017.8203833","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCAD.2017.8203833","venue":"2017 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD)"}

Use of the proposed separation techniques prefiltration (PF), Ultrafiltration [UF], nanofiltration [NF], and reverse osmosis [RO]) produce byproducts that might include additional benefits. A pilot plant was developed in an olive mill operating in Achaia (Patras, Greece) during an olive harvesting season. Large volumes of OMW produced daily were treated systematically in a semibatch procedure to identify problems relevant to long-term behavior and reliability. The study showed that a fraction of pure water up to 75% can be recovered. Also fractions are isolated that contained concentrate nutritious and polyphenol content which can be further exploited in order to reduce the, indeed, high cost of the suggested treatment process. Finally, a feasibility-exploitation study was done to estimate if depreciation of the (indeed) expensive investment may occur in a short period of time. Together with the proposed method a synopis of commercially available techniques for the effective treatment of OMW is given. These techhnologies are based on biological, advanced oxidation, physicochemical and separation processes (composting, trickling filters, evaporation, oxidation, hydrolysis, co-digestion in a sewage treatment plant, production of solid fuels, etc).","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"New techniques in olive mill wastewater treatment (OMW)","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Here, we show that MYB30 expressed under the control of the strong phloem-specific SUC2 promoter accelerates flowering both in long and short days. Early flowering is mediated by elevated expression of flowering locus T (FT), which can be observed in the absence and presence of CONSTANS (CO), the main activator of FT. CO-independent activation by high MYB30 expression results in FT levels that remain below those observed in the wild-type plants, which show an additive CO-dependent activation. In contrast, twin sister of FT (TSF) is repressed in plants expressing high levels of MYB30 in the phloem. In transient assays, MYB30 and CO additively increase the activity of a reporter construct driven by a 1 kb FT promoter. Acceleration of flowering by MYB30 does not require the presence of salicylic acid and is independent of FLC. Taken together, increased levels of MYB30, which was reported to be induced in response to the perception of pathogens, can accelerate flowering and MYB30 may thus be a candidate to mediate cross-talk between gene networks involved in biotic stress perception and flowering time.","inCitations":["be990f21625178c61f9dce11bbcfa8d423f4e072","8797ba16d0c6d994de09a16f5c16d7e39180bc22","a243eada088d27143b6b27fa02cbc1bcc13d3fb0","a64f8f71d0caa411de82c50185b020098221cee7","34e3757cd0c40f51e402226caf8f2793fbe5df6d","1bffd35fd129a1901f7e442af34fd065e55dfcbe","88f1e6955567a8d095487d0b463bf4f5a76009da","ffca0d6e9439b0d420b6b1cefdc4cde06dc54f67","42d0fcf6ea57da001ae6bf84bd0d5eae358a868b","7ab229a86596690faeadc872718d8808f30f89da","ffdf6818462c3d4b5b01971a399d3194fc1cf4d2","c7127a58a1b50514497ed04702ae303da487528c","d896727cd5bef916543983dea8827b2cf6ddd128"],"pdfUrls":["http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0089799&type=printable","http://www.xtbg.ac.cn/xwzx/kydt/201406/P020140604388807409557.pdf"],"title":"Elevated Levels of MYB30 in the Phloem Accelerate Flowering in Arabidopsis through the Regulation of FLOWERING LOCUS T","doi":"10.1371/journal.pone.0089799","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0089799","venue":"PloS one"}

Regular monitoring methods can supply information about the number of vehicles in transit and thus the saturation of the streets, but they are usually expensive and intrusive with respect to the road. In recent years a new trend in traffic detection has arisen, considering the Wireless signals emitted by 'smart' on-board devices for counting and tracking vehicles. In this paper, two traffic monitoring methods are compared: detections using a regular Inductive Loop Detector on the road and an own Wireless Tracking System based on Bluetooth detection called Mobywit. The correlation between the day of the week and the hour with the traffic flow in a metropolitan busy street has been analysed. Assuming that our system is not able to defect all the vehicles, but just only subset of them, it is expected a causality between the results obtained using the two methods. This means, that the Bluetooth-based system can detect the same variations in the traffic flow that the regular loop detector, but having two main advantages: the tracking possibilities and a much lower cost.","inCitations":["c47800951fd1bda040e5b57b71c717ebe3b175e6","5ee90f3b044a2677eeee92c57c5411eaa8faeb66"],"pdfUrls":["http://digibug.ugr.es/bitstream/handle/10481/43097/Castillo_TrafficControlSystem.pdf;jsessionid=BF3D211F64A678E540D2D180B254BF88?sequence=1","https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-39595-1_5"],"title":"Comparing Wireless Traffic Tracking with Regular Traffic Control Systems for the Detection of Congestions in Streets","doi":"10.1007/978-3-319-39595-1_5","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-39595-1_5","venue":"Smart-CT"}

Comparing the curve with Haq's one (1988) both of them have the same tendency in long term and high order sea level change cycles before pliocene.But there are obvious differences in several aspects:a) the sea level cycles show rising tendency from Pliocene in the East China Sea Shelf Basin,while Hag’s curve indicates falling in the same period;b) the quantity and the frequency in sub cycles’ change are quite different;c) there is no response in the change directions and degrees of sub cycles;d) there exist three times large scale transgressions in the Haq’s eustatic curve from Oligocene to Middle Miocene,but there are very small transgressions in the East China Sea Shelf Basin at the same period.The further work is necessary to answer the questions.","inCitations":["4a939bdd5fba5420722ef2eb25f6da61fa90d5c2","3afe96b97abc940e27d341057aeb7529c013d273"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"The Tertiary Sea Level Changes in the East China Sea Shelf Basin","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

The data obtained were subjected to a T-test analysis. Results showed that nutrients intake, digested nutrient as well as nutrient digestibility of Bligon and Kejobong goats were not significantly different. However, Kejobong goats had EE and CP intake of 15.42% and 14.02%, digested DM, OM, and NFE of 16.29%, 15.71%, and 13.93% respectively, as well as NFE digestibility 4.37% higher than those Bligon goats (P< 0.05).

There have been a moderate number of studies surrounding the reasons why youth join gangs. However, few have emphasized the life path of gang members beginning from age 7 years through adolescence and what Erickson (1950) identified as industry versus inferiority and identity versus role confusion stages of psychosocial development. This paper contributes to the literature on gang recruitment and socialization by introducing the life path of gang members, providing a rationale as to why certain boys join gangs, and shows how developmental patterns are consistent with DSM-IV-TR categorical criteria of oppositional defiance disorder, conduct disorder, and antisocial disorder patterns of delinquent youth. \n \n   \n \n Key words: Peer group, intimidation, Gangs, young adults, society.","inCitations":["e77e8dff3f6e842b6d2c29eebe700107843cdc54","1ef001d18f4207f2d6951fc47808a5e6c46c6170","90e30ad07934a5dc5f475ceee2f0df6d37da1c7f","0c945b9b7f0177e967c86fa1aca90c8114fea0e0","330ecbf97ec31b86e6a76a2dfc467b7fac7d701b","d91533a219c3efefb3472e05e8086b6446dddfdb","4cb209d39f2a1de04d9364410443acff08a2cc4e"],"pdfUrls":["https://academicjournals.org/article/article1382351514_Taylor.pdf","http://sachajournals.com/documents/TAYLOR2012AJLC002.pdf"],"title":"Why American boys join street gangs","doi":"10.5897/IJSA12.073","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.5897/IJSA12.073","venue":""}

The power module consists of four components; a divide-by-40 clock divider, a frequency detector, a voltage ramp generator, and a voltage peak detector circuit. The power module provides a stable reference voltage equal to the power supply voltage of the targeted voltage domain in the device plane. SPICE simulations of the circuit indicate that power supply voltages of less than 1 V are successfully set and provided as a reference to an on-chip voltage regulator within 500 ns and with reference voltage variation of less than 1%. The power module is integrated with on-chip voltage regulators which require a precise voltage reference.

Men dedication to those tasks household diminishes when increasing the age. When the opportunity cost of the domestic working hours of the women increases, they diminish its dedication to the household. In the case of the men this variable is not significant to explain the amount of domestic tasks.

Obesity modifies some aspects of the cardiovascular system in order to preserve the body homoeostasis. Echocardiography to study ventricular function plays an important role in the evaluation of pathological re-modelling associated with left ventricular dysfunction. The aim of this study was to evaluate the left ventricle function and structure with conventional echocardiography and to analyse the longitudinal deformity of the left ventricle using myocardial-tracking signals in a group of severely obese adolescents. Methods and results We carried out a descriptive cross-sectional study. We describe the evaluation of the left ventricle using conventional bi-dimensional echocardiography and the myocardial-tracking signals in severely obese adolescents. There were 34 severely obese adolescents included in our study; 52% had a left ventricular ejection fraction<55%, the left ventricular end-diastolic diameter was increased in 70.5% of patients, and 32.3% had an increase in left ventricular mass. On average, 78.9% had abnormal values of left ventricle longitudinal deformations. The number of segments affected per patient was, on average, 5.8, with the anterior apical segment being the most commonly affected. There was a decrease in global longitudinal deformity in 79.4% of the cases.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nMore than half of this group of asymptomatic severely obese adolescents showed abnormalities in left ventricular structure and function evaluated using traditional echocardiographic methods, but 100% of the cases showed abnormalities in longitudinal deformation in at least one of the 17 left ventricle segments evaluated using myocardial-tracking signals.","inCitations":["487230b07aeeabdf45562cae6b0b29d971c0609b"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Evaluation of the left ventricle longitudinal deformity using myocardial-tracking signals in severely obese adolescents.","doi":"10.1017/S1047951115001298","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1017/S1047951115001298","venue":"Cardiology in the young"}

While several articles have reviewed the impact of pesticide exposures on human respiratory health in occupational settings, to the best of our knowledge, this article is the first one to review published studies on the association between pesticide exposures and human respiratory health in the general populations. In this article, we critically reviewed evidences up to date studying the associations between non-occupational pesticide exposures and respiratory health in general populations. This article also highlighted questions arising from these studies, including our recent analyses using the data from the Canadian Health Measures Survey (CHMS), for future research. We found few studies have addressed the impact of environmental pesticide exposures on respiratory health, especially on lung function, in general populations. In the studies using the data from CHMS Cycle 1, exposures to OP insecticides, pyrethroid insecticides, and the organochlorine pesticide DDT were associated with impaired lung function in the Canadian general population, but no significant associations were observed for the herbicide 2,4-D. Future research should focus on the potential age-specific and pesticide-specific effect on respiratory health in the general population, and repeated longitudinal study design is critical for assessing the temporal variations in pesticide exposures. Research findings from current studies of non-occupational pesticide exposures and their health impact in general population will help to improve the role of regulatory policies in mitigating pesticide-related public health problems, and thereafter providing greater benefit to the general population.","inCitations":["d775eab78e3faf8957fef44dca99f3fbf8149555","b9a8a4b4c3b6462fb58dc06d922794215dd7c0b2","0a54f5a9caab05e84861d0d748f39303532b362a","bc9ee93eb8921313c6c0a903b0ca02ffbac93fb2","d336896de5d4c54d5a6844699040056bdfdd678d","2c8b00adc9b8e3290dca7c410d68b6463a2845a0","71028d4f784b4e96a37cecf2eb8eca14be7198c5","409fcd38834f48183a2f1250a5a3ffcdb1876ed6","cb2b354fba09def751caef41c902c037842c3726","cb41a993c9b1781e5c5b7b01ada4c1648ca38269","08d492c53e6ec5851d7f4d83569ce9871c8fc98e","c6a0a5b62999f84a18d514e4162125412048f3a0","0703e1ecb8cc610942c17662483a25cc8ad44fbe","1ee13a0af368d30250fbf8bffa2b5ee4d8ae7f51","bed10319506d7f8e4069eb859543a1c3baf05dd3","af5c31abe16559b53047de04451854191ea3c95b","3b87b764624219250a6e31cc1e3578e34b96ee05"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.jesc.ac.cn/jesc_en/ch/reader/create_pdf.aspx?file_no=S1001074216313444&flag=1"],"title":"Pesticide exposures and respiratory health in general populations.","doi":"10.1016/j.jes.2016.11.012","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jes.2016.11.012","venue":"Journal of environmental sciences"}

This method is based on the well‐known solution consisting of two separate devices: a servocompensator, in fact an internal model of the exogenous dynamics, including the reference commands and disturbance signals; and a stabilizing compensator. The proof is made involving the servocompensator structure which is close to the one designed for step signals. The stabilizing compensator is assured by way of a linear quadratic optimal procedure. An antiwindup compensation is added to deal with the adverse effects caused by actuator saturation.","inCitations":["9815e335063468dbce98a8603b48b16511eaa710","65996b0ed11e7dfc713c66048486917677b597d0","c254d1a12addb97dc5ff382fc3811ba6a0c89cb2","12210a8ef75231205b43545b3068b3ec49a5f5ec","4ee26f6d3687388706617e82a0277711c5bc8510","d02fa7bc13a6a597a4909a3d1c62465e4f384d12","bb4b647728254fab61fa0031faf15d20d5aa1109","c6121959bc25cb6968f9ac3a07dafbb0b39ebcff","472e88758c2d32aee84bc516ef0a63c121582438","d95741cdd1ef757ba257d35e6738823f77e0df32","dcc8a9e1374d619080b4a19680fbfa982e2cb41c","02608d6213ac80c6c9a5781e4082317c3737730c"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"From robust control to antiwindup compensation of electrohydraulic servo actuators","doi":"10.1108/00022669810225287","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1108/00022669810225287","venue":""}

There are many attacker attacks on the MANET. In this paper we introduce avoid wormhole attack. . The wormhole attack is possible even if the attacker has not compromised any hosts, and even if all communication provides authenticity and confidentiality. In the wormhole attack, an attacker records packets (or bits) at one location in the network, tunnels them (possibly selectively) to another location, and retransmits them there into the network. Security in mobile ad hoc networks is difficult to achieve, because of the dynamic topologies, limited resources, the absence of a certification authority and the lack of a centralized monitoring point [1]. Most of the attacks in MANETs are routing protocol attacks. The wormhole effect is caused by attempts to draw all network traffic to malicious nodes that broadcast fake shortest path routing information. The wormhole nodes should be detected and detached as early as possible. Incremental Flexible Frequency Discretization (IFFD) is a recently proposed discretization approach for Naïve Bayes (NB). IFFD performs satisfactory by setting the minimal interval frequency for discretized intervals as a fixed number. In this paper, we first argue that this setting cannot guarantee that the selecting MinBinSize is on always optimal for all the different datasets. So the performance of Naïve Bayes is not good in terms of classification error. We thus proposed a sequential search method for NB: named Flexible IFFD. Experiments were conducted on 4 datasets from UCI machine learning repository and performance was compared between NB trained on the data discretized by FIFFD, IFFD, and PKID.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://www.ijsrd.com/articles/IJSRDV1I3054.pdf"],"title":"Survey on Wormhole Attack Detection Method in MANET","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

A, General physics","paperAbstract":"Particle transport and mixing in modulated traveling waves in a binary-fluid mixture heated from below is studied numerically. The fluid divides into three regions separated by KolmogorovArnol'd-Moser curves: a core region where particles are carried along with the wave (trapped), an outer region where particles are left behind by the wave (untrapped), and a separatrix layer between the two where particles chaotically alternate between being trapped and untrapped. The probability distributions for the lengths of individual trapped and untrapped events are sharply peaked at small times, have a power-law decay, and exhibit similar complex structure. The core and outer regions are responsible for long-range transport with no diffusion. The chaotic separatrix layer gives rise to long-range transport with enhanced mixing and anomalous diffusion, where, for long times (x'(t) ) — (x (t) )'-t', 1 & v & 2. Hydrodynamic waves are of fundamental importance in many branches of physics, and both linear and nonlinear waves have been extensively studied. Less well studied, however, are the mixing and transport properties of such waves, which require a Lagrangian description. As is well known, linear waves do not cause mass transport; nonlinearities are required to produce a nonvanishing Stokes drift. ' In addition, wave momentum or energy are transported if the waves break or dissipate. In the present paper we point out that quite simple waves may cause the fluid elements through which they pass to execute complex or chaotic motions leading to enhanced mixing and long-range transport. Such mixing occurs only in the coarse-grained sense, however, since fine mixing requires diffusion processes at the molecular level. These processes, which allow interchange of mass between neighboring fluid elements, are absent at the level of idealization represented by the equations of hydrodynamics. At this level the problem, may, therefore, be formulated in terms of fluid elements, hereafter referred to as \"particles, \" which retain their identity during motion. To make the above suggestion more concrete we focus on two-dimensional quasiperiodic waves in an incompressible fluid. Then the equations of motion for the particle trajectories can be written in the form of Hamilton's equations,","inCitations":["20621477d459da06747c49f4f0d26753ecbdee4a","cfea0b766607e6d6bf6923ee43a00e856ea584a1","bb8af60fa2d20abd559779dd18353ed5aac69461","1be260f1c72e5df3d9c5a43f050f13aa1f7dcf89","aa8f82e1f52cb4e70a0b2cad6a9f9313e95f359a","ac2b2b35b8a797f47b9e05dbcfbb22e5283963d7","9df738dbc83c004583b7523b45abe5500fb60276","2b2048834c4930f44d4442c0602937eb39438492","c9cbca3933bb992b2c239c856f412f2199a9a990","a8b58d2f2c13bae6a824c724e12e8a5879bd54c0","904db529b5446749bae9d8b258937d0de46809e6","e92119c5b61bf1c6acaf34b84c1053a800dda201","a108f0315a19a3d2f59b6c92f77d51619e609f2e","3b036278f6018ef1d41ba15a0dcf8bd49b7482a1","34b7e1d26dcad33cff4bd4668ae9611e6f61837a","4a21aac83851f1cb9af2b1834205eaf45645dd75","5414a87512c99b14990d431e0062f6b030504831","383a95811fdd9a2d8f1a24b12751f660affba261","38b4646a4cae9ebc0cf786d8ec8d96c104c2bd90","1482230396a1efadb995f3cf03e3f1a498f458c0","c14af3723af502716951a39fa115eadfcd68ee12","7f7ccde9a04603eb3ab1aa8f321419dfcec5d7f4"],"pdfUrls":["http://tardis.berkeley.edu/reprints/papers/WeKn_PRA40_1989.pdf"],"title":"Mass transport and mixing by modulated traveling waves.","doi":"10.1103/PhysRevA.40.2579","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevA.40.2579","venue":"Physical review.

Treatment with SEA increased the number of peripheral blood polymorphonuclear leukocytes significantly within 4 h, and these polymorphonuclear leukocytes exhibited a higher chemiluminescence response than those of the controls. Furthermore, a significant increase in spleen weight was also observed in mice treated with SEA, and histologically that increase was characterized by a proliferation of lymphoblast-like cells which were stained with antibody to mouse Thy-1 but not with antibody to mouse immunoglobulin G by indirect immunofluorescence. As expected from the above findings, the treatment of nude mice (nu/nu) with SEA failed to protect them against Escherichia coli infections, whereas treatment of heterozygous (nu/+) controls afforded such protection. This was in part supported by the fact that the chemiluminescence response of peripheral blood polymorphonuclear leukocytes was increased significantly by treatment with SEA in nu/+mice but not in nu/nu mice.","inCitations":["5639090ab1fbc3555879657f33ed94af2e22893d"],"pdfUrls":["http://iai.asm.org/content/47/3/767.full.pdf"],"title":"Stimulation by staphylococcal enterotoxin A of nonspecific resistance of mice to microbial infection.","doi":"10.1128/iai.47.3.767-773.1985","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1128/iai.47.3.767-773.1985","venue":"Infection and immunity"}

It has been assumed to be genetically distinct. A family is described in which the index case displayed these features. Motor nerve conduction velocity was substantially reduced. Another member displayed distal motor and sensory involvement in both upper and lower limbs and thus conformed to the clinical pattern of the hypertrophic form of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy type I). A third member was somewhat intermediate, with generalized upper limb and distal lower limb weakness. It is concluded that Davidenkow's syndrome is not genetically distinct and that it may occur as a phenotypic manifestation of type I hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy.ZusammenfassungDavidenkow's Syndrom wird als eine Erbkrankheit definiert, welche charakterisiert ist durch eine proximale Muskelschwäche und zunehmende motorische Behinderung der oberen Extremitäten mit distaler Schwäche der unteren, zugleich mit distalen Sensibilitätsstörungen aller vier Gliedmaßen. Es wurde angenommen, daß es sich genetisch um eine wohldefinierte eigene Erkrankung handelt. Es wird eine Familie beschrieben, in welcher der Propositus die oben erwähnten Merkmale aufwies. Die motorische Erregungsleitungsgeschwindigkeit war wesentlich verlangsamt. Ein anderes Glied der Sippe zeigte einen motorischen und sensiblen Befall aller vier Extremitäten und entsprach klinisch der hypertrophischen Form der Charcot-Marie-Toothschen Krankheit (hereditäre motorische und sensorische Neuropathie von Typ I). Ein drittes Glied der Sippe nahm eine intermediäre Stellung ein mit generalisierter Schwäche der oberen Extremitäten und einer distalen Schwäche der unteren. Es wird deshalb gefolgert, daß Davidenkow's Syndrom kein genetisch einheitliches Krankheitsbild ist und daß es als phänotypische Manifestation einer hereditären motorischen und sensorischen Neuropathie vom Typ I auftreten kann.","inCitations":["62a8b37cc95584d51bb8d25b11091353b98bfcd6","fe59649f5b818ab67e89d1fa1beb1d3a08c7bd8e","b2ecd678e2e9746bbfd080d8b1d92b4359366c77","94ccbe366287db014ccae7cb92b02b686a65e0ca","9d0efcbd7b6c9d5ae76c06eb164125219c5e13a3","27e9a3649d35db12e34f0af3bd96296d3006c17a"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Distal and scapuloperoneal distributions of muscle involvement occurring within a family with type I hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy","doi":"10.1007/BF00313203","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/BF00313203","venue":"Journal of Neurology"}

A constant intravenous infusion of the alpha1-adrenoceptor selective agonist phenylephrine (150 μg/min) was administered to produce a near maximal activation of both organs. Steady-state responses were attained about 15 minutes after starting the phenylephrine infusion. Administration of the alpha1-adrenoceptor selective antagonist prazosin produced a dose-dependent blockade of NM contractions without altering phenylephrine-induced mydriasis when given as pretreatment (1.0 mg/kg i.v.) or post-treatment (0.01-1.0 mg/kg i.V.). In contrast, post-treatment with the alpha1-adrenoceptor selective antagonist WB-4101 (0.1-1.0 mg/kg i.v.) or pretreatment with phenoxybenzamine (3.0 mg/kg i.v) blocked both the NM and pupillary responses.

PV is associated with a high risk of mesenteric and cerebral thrombosis. PV RBC adhesion to endothelial laminin is increased and mediated by phosphorylated erythroid Lu/BCAM. In the present work, we investigated the mechanism responsible for Lu/BCAM phosphorylation in the presence of JAK2V617F using HEL and BaF3 cell lines as well as RBCs from patients with PV. High levels of Rap1-GTP were found in HEL and BaF3 cells expressing JAK2V617F compared with BaF3 cells with wild-type JAK2. This finding was associated with increased Akt activity, Lu/BCAM phosphorylation, and cell adhesion to laminin that were inhibited by the dominant-negative Rap1S17N or by the specific Rap1 inhibitor GGTI-298. Surprisingly, knocking-down EpoR in HEL cells did not alter Akt activity or cell adhesion to laminin. Our findings reveal a novel EpoR-independent Rap1/Akt signaling pathway that is activated by JAK2V617F in circulating PV RBCs and responsible for Lu/BCAM activation. This new characteristic of JAK2V617F could play a critical role in initiating abnormal interactions among circulating and endothelial cells in patients with PV.","inCitations":["f2c63b845e7f0d64926eb6b111b8a41f74ad94f2","e346560ecc24a464c50b58f11750ee3d9c4a5ff1","6931a160afa6ee18e89068c3ddb18c669bbc1511","bd08503cb7e21c484fef991cf54893762e2e6a25","a7a706f0eb84f3e993f52e63c9f66d4466f2b7d3","161b241cea0f7cbdc5715503e30c7090703d249d","fc141509db74708bb4f77926d421510af614ef7e","93448f5dbefe33c18304e943e8d87dc8ab239733","e14e1393f6a4d733e9e72c1f41fed4fef1f1787c","c2027a5fa155a8fcd08fc942835532df1c987ead","df62cc24b6bc9d3e6236e3ba861b7b064d3faa3d","b42095c5422b98280b4091dc8614bbfb7e0f104e","068a564b628e524ed062b33503c2365186399a90","09126d9a4079a18f65ad9122ee8df0568658e3dd","038694b4b38ac5294267f5721eb0d179c3d29caf","70709a81e8e3279773d55580685aa2524019ff72","3fb354c43b860465c5482b49b194fde13a00be90","b9538f0980ed853fcd98bf737cbb5d42d979394e","55de6d40e48e8ae1c14a3d70484ddd663f8629ba","03437b23cfc20696d322f5f6315f3831e75456b1","714390fdbbad83afac7b87eb03d38a7c3646297b","89e499dffcf80e03ed0ee9b259f7efe1c3062fcc","ff5bab6b4365589fdedd9bbb1955b0028ace0832","246147b1fe20d00e7281a39cfd6f984b336286a0","e7ab7d79fcc6e798ccc3967c13a247e1fe5ef495","2c160f25e5cd6560f0d36b8a7d43ad293521cc2b","d0a85e11bf6933cbdc7ff36454aa8b80c38cf916","884e3ddd6dcea99250bcf6b7f7fe3a422e9bf688","7f1054e27426532602cd5639b1fa7311ad95f271","2749127d442e154dd2587868ea647a718e2c6268","757a2244d6d20c10953d4f832bc0f2f968306c02","750416722c120e39f71b469bf28f35316abab1a5","7b079333d2046ec97611a2c7a542330cb697bf17","2001ff1b0270f19a038a619aa44cb4652dc12e64","4360ba94890acba6fc5b9033cab5ff895b2be7fe","b57b728d9b85e68b8d7e5a2e4227a591153e02e9","00c883c90a42819d6ab8cdd0c6174dffbaf353e7"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.labex-grex.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Blood-2013-De-Grandis-658-65.pdf"],"title":"JAK2V617F activates Lu/BCAM-mediated red cell adhesion in polycythemia vera through an EpoR-independent Rap1/Akt pathway.","doi":"10.1182/blood-2012-07-440487","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1182/blood-2012-07-440487","venue":"Blood"}

His dissertation on the mission theology of the late Bishop Leslie Newbigin will be published shortly. This paper was part of an annual series of conferences on worldview questions, a dialogue between Christians and secularists. The good news of Jesus Christ is a message about the revelation and accomplishment of the goal of history-the restoration of the entire creation from sin. Thus, the Christian faith is not a religion that can be slotted into the private domain of human life. Rather it is a comprehensive worldview embodied by the Christian community. The Christian community has always had to embody the gospel of the kingdom in the context of a culture that holds other comprehensive beliefs. Three cultural contexts can be discerned in church history, all of which bring possibilities for and dangers to a faithful witness to the gospel. Sometimes the cultural setting is hostile to the Christian faith, as in the case of the early church and the church under Communism. While Christians may be limited in contributing to the cultural development of society, they must embody an alternative worldview that challenges the reigning public doctrine, even if it means suffering. Sometimes the cultural arrangement will favour the Christian church, giving it an established position. In this situation, Christians must use the position offered to shape the culture according to the light of the gospel, remaining critical of elements of culture out of keeping with the kingdom and modelling the gentle and uncoercive manner of Jesus the Servant-King. Sometimes Christians will find themselves in a culture that ignores the Christian faith and relegates it to the private realm. Then Christians must refuse to reduce the gospel to a private religious teaching, and seek ways to embody the truth of the gospel for public life. The church in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union has seen all three of these cultural contexts. The paper concludes with two comments for the church in Eastern Europe, Russia, Ukraine, and other countries of the former Soviet Union. First, there may be a parallel situation between the collapse of the Roman empire and the collapse of Communism. Both offer the opportunity for the Christian worldview to fill the vacuum created by the crumbling of the reigning cultural doctrine. Second, the growing presence of capitalistic liberalism threatens the gospel as public truth about human society and culture. The gospel and liberal, democratic capitalism offer two different stories about the world that demands a commitment in faith. Which worldview will provide a foundation for the future of Russia, Ukraine, and Eastern Europe? Will it be the rock of the gospel of Jesus Christ or the sand of a human hope for the future? 1Presented at the Man and Christian Worldview Conference in Simpferopol, Crimea, October 9-13, 2000, it appeared in Russian in the conference proceedings: \"Building for the Future: Worldview Foundations of Sand and Rock\", in Man and the Christian Worldview. Volume 5: Worldview and Lifestyle: What Are We Bequeathing to Our Children? [Russian], eds. George Carillet and Sergei Golovin. Simferopol, Ukraine: Crimean-American College Press. 2000. pp. 27-37. I offer this paper with the full awareness that it is shaped by my cultural setting which is so different from that of nations from Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. My own studies in worldview have been shaped in interaction with the cultural story that shapes the West. However, I take comfort in the conviction of Cyril and Methodius, apostles to the Slavs, that \"every nation has its own particular gifts and every people its legitimate calling within the family of the universal church\" (Obolensky 1994:215). This is also my conviction; all cultures have both insights and blind spots. Dialogue between different cultural traditions leads to mutual enrichment and correction. I hope that my insights on the Christian church, drawn from the Western setting, may offer some light for your situation. Two thousand years ago Jesus of Nazareth opened his public career with the startling announcement that the kingdom of God had arrived in history. To judge the significance and meaning of these words we must attempt to return to the first­ century Jewish context in which they were spoken. This was not an announcement about the beginning of a new religion to succeed Judaism or some new religious doctrine. Rather Jesus claimed that in him all of universal and world history found its meaning (Berkhof 1966). The Old Testament told a story that was not just about one small ethnic and religious group; rather it claimed to be a story about what the one Creator God was doing to restore the whole creation and all peoples from the devastating effects of human evil. God chose one nation, Israel, to be the channel through which He would restore the entire creation. The Old Testament looked forward to a time when one man from within Israel, a King, would appear and bring history to a close, judging evil and establishing a world-wide kingdom of justice, peace, and joy. This man would bring universal history to its end and consummation. Then God would rule over all of creation again as he had in the beginning; the kingdom of God would be restored. Jesus announced that he was that man hoped for by the Jewish people for thousands of years. He was the one through whom God would usher in His kingdom. Jesus announced the good news, the gospel, that now God was acting in him to bring an end to all the enemies of God and of the creation. Yet history did not end. Jesus appeared to be more of a Jewish rabbi than the one who would conquer evil and establish a worldwide kingdom. However, Jesus' message remained consistent. While the kingdom was already present in a provisional form in the healing power of God's Spirit, the final kingdom was not to be established immediately. There would be a delay before its final unveiling and the intervening time would give opportunity for this message to be communicated to all the peoples of the earth. All who believed the message would begin to experience the healing power of God that had entered history, and would enjoy a foretaste of the life of God's final kingdom. In the irony of God's purpose, the shameful crucifixion coupled with the resurrection became the central events in history. Jesus met and defeated death and the evil of the world by taking it all upon himself at the cross. His resurrection from the dead signalled the victory over death and evil as Jesus was the first one to victoriously enter into the life of the world to come. He poured out the Spirit to share this life with his followers. All those who follow him now begin to experience in foretaste the life of the world to come, and are called to live under the rule of God in the whole of their lives, words, and deeds. Jesus promised to return and complete his work. At that time every person will acknowledge that Jesus is not the founder of a new religion but King and Lord over all creation. Creation will be restored and all the evil and suffering that corrupts this world will be defeated. This brief summary shows that the good news, the Christian message is not simply some new religious teaching that can be incorporated into the reigning culture. Rather it is a message about the end of history, the culmination of universal history. It is a story about the restoration of all creation, all peoples, and all of human life, from the effects of human sin. All of human life can again be lived unto God. If the message of Jesus is true-and it can be rejected, of course-but if it is true, it is public truth. It has universal significance, and has implications for all of human life; it offers a comprehensive worldview. To use the words of the Russian theologian George Fedotov, Christian 'spirituality' (to use his term) cannot be \"confined to prayer but embraces the whole world-outlook\" (Fedotov 1988:7). The gospel has implications for politics, economics, education, media, business, family, indeed all of life. If the church is the people of God that has begun to share in the healing of Jesus' work, its task is to embody Christ's victory in every realm and station of life. From the beginning, the church that believed its own gospel was compelled to live in the midst of a culture that embodied other comprehensive beliefs about the world and another story about where history was going. In other words, the Christian worldview has always had to negotiate a faithful witness in the context of an alternative story about the world. It will be no different for the Christian community in the Ukraine or Russia or Eastern Europe in the future. But perhaps a brief look at history can be instructive. The small fledgling church of the first centuries in the Roman empire believed that Jesus had, in fact, made known and accomplished the end of universal history. Although small, and insignificant in both economic and political terms, they resolved to embody the universal claims of Christ in the face of the powerful and often hostile Roman empire. The name the early church chose to designate itself reveals the self­ understanding of that early Christian community. That self-designation is in Greek, ecclesia tou Theou, translated, the public assembly of God. The Roman empire had other words with which to label private religious communities-thiasos and heranos. Both of these words described a religious community organized for religious or cultic exercises (like prayer and worship) and were only interested in the personal and future spiritual salvation of its members2. Ecclesia was a word that described a public assembly to which all the citizens of the city were summ oned by the town clerk. It was a public gathering where citizens discussed and settled affairs that were important for the city's life.

Transportable radiation monitoring instruments could be used to measure photon radiation from radionuclides in the body for triaging individuals and assigning priorities to their bioassay samples for further assessments. Computer simulations and experimental measurements are required for these instruments to be used for assessing intakes of radionuclides. Count rates from calibrated sources of Co, Cs, and Am were measured on three instruments: a survey meter containing a 2.54 × 2.54-cm NaI(Tl) crystal, a thyroid probe using a 5.08 × 5.08-cm NaI(Tl) crystal, and a portal monitor incorporating two 3.81 × 7.62 × 182.9-cm polyvinyltoluene plastic scintillators. Computer models of the instruments and of the calibration sources were constructed, using engineering drawings and other data provided by the manufacturers. Count rates on the instruments were simulated using the Monte Carlo radiation transport code MCNPX. The computer simulations were within 16% of the measured count rates for all 20 measurements without using empirical radionuclide-dependent scaling factors, as reported by others. The weighted root-mean-square deviations (differences between measured and simulated count rates, added in quadrature and weighted by the variance of the difference) were 10.9% for the survey meter, 4.2% for the thyroid probe, and 0.9% for the portal monitor. These results validate earlier MCNPX models of these instruments that were used to develop calibration factors that enable these instruments to be used for assessing intakes and committed doses from several gamma-emitting radionuclides.","inCitations":["fb2faa78b8794a0f676310740ca8b833fb86f807","63ae5dc15c575a083f32a08eae211e602d9a2a05"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Use of Transportable Radiation Detection Instruments to Assess Internal Contamination From Intakes of Radionuclides Part I: Field Tests and Monte Carlo Simulations.","doi":"10.1097/HP.0000000000000496","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1097/HP.0000000000000496","venue":"Health physics"}

The American College of Surgeons Risk Calculator (ACSRC) was created based on data from the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program to predict the risk of surgical complications on a patient-specific level. Whether the ACSRC can accurately predict the risk of postoperative complications following palliative procedures in cancer patients is unknown. The purpose of this study was to determine if the ACSRC accurately predicted postoperative complication rates in this setting.\n\n\nSTUDY DESIGN\nA prospectively maintained, surgical oncology database of patient outcomes from 2011 to 2013 was queried. Data extracted included the following: demographics, comorbidities, site and stage of cancer, type of procedure, and post-operative complication rate and type. Risk assessment was performed for each patient using the ACSRC. Predicted outcomes were compared to actual outcomes for length of stay (LOS), complications, and death. Main outcome measures were differences in actual versus predicted outcomes.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThirty-two patients were included. Occurrence of any complication was significantly lower than predicted (31% vs. 59%, p < 0.05). The predicted LOS, however, was 2.9 days; significantly lower than 5.4 days (p < 0.05).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe ACSRC is a powerful tool for aid in surgical decision-making; however, in the case of palliative procedures for cancer patients, it overestimated the risk of postoperative complications and underestimated the LOS. Overestimation of post-operative complications could result in fewer patients being offered potentially beneficial palliative procedures.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Estimation of Risk in Cancer Patients Undergoing Palliative Procedures by the American College of Surgeons Risk Calculator.","doi":"10.1089/jpm.2015.0482","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1089/jpm.2015.0482","venue":"Journal of palliative medicine"}
