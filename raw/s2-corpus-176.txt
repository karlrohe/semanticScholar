It employs Anna Brozek’s methodology to identify philosophers’ influence on one another (distinctions between direct and indirect influence, active and passive contact, etc.); concepts of institutional and ideological conditions of this influence are also considered. The article establishes, first, that many Ukrainian academics had institutional bonds with Brentano’s students, especially Kazimierz Twardowski at the University of Lviv. Second, it identifies an ideological bond between Brentano and his hypothetical Ukrainian “academic grandsons.” Particularly, a comparative analysis of works on the history of philosophy of Brentano and the Ukrainian Ilarion Svientsits'kyi (1876-1956) reveals that the latter took over Brentano’s a posteriori constructive method . These results allow to draw a conclusion about the existence of Ukrainian Brentanism, that not only brings new arguments into the discussion about the tradition of and prospects for the development of analytic (scientific) philosophy on Ukrainian ground, but also opens new aspects of the modernization of Ukrainian society in general (from the end of the nineteenth century to the present day) .","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Franz Brentano’s Influence on Ukrainian Philosophy: A Methodological Introduction to Research","doi":"10.21226/ewjus478","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.21226/ewjus478","venue":""}

In the statistical files of the New York State Department of Mental Hygiene there are important facts concerning the hospital life of our patients but nothing at all relative to their life outside of the hospital after discharge, unless, perchance, they return for further treatment. In studying manic-depressive psychoses, especially, we feel the need of more complete data relative to the patients that recover from the first attack and do n I reappear on the hospital records. The brief study of the recurrence of attacks in manic-depressive psychoses presented herewith was made from the file of statistical cards of the department covering the period from October i, i9o9, to June 30, 1920. The manic-depressive file contains in order of identification number the first admission cards of all patients of this group admitted to the civil state hospitals during such period, together with the subsequent discharge, readmission and death cards relating to the same patients. All cards referring to the same patient are brought together in the file. The cards for the years mentioned give a statistical record of over 8ooo manic-depressive cases. The purpose of the study is to throw light on the prognosis of manic-depressive psychoses by answering as definitely as possible the following questions: i. To what extent do recurrent attacks occur in this form of mental disease? 2. To what extent does the recurrence of attacks differ in the several types? 3. How does the recurrence of attacks differ in the various age groups of first admissions?","inCitations":["e430cd10d2273a75eaeae79e879f21cfe22ad5c6","e15b9128dbc25d67a0aec3c781ebd61483765b07","3882497ead3cae3a39f09ca0a3d5ced0579d959e","a3625daa5680f7f950ccd324a20eecbeb9287a4a","2fa8894e4f97c4ec67fa77e248fc4aed9a6f8f6e","3c4e75f08cf4c6c54a1235ffc444cc12635e1ac3","9956f375ef33ea0f875c16916339ba7cda55217e","141f0703e484b9120b8950b3e1ee82a216993b84"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Recurrence of Attacks in Manic-depressive Psychoses","doi":"10.1176/ajp.88.3.567","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1176/ajp.88.3.567","venue":""}

It is found that PD 7098 has the minimum linear absorption over a greater part of the visible spectrum and the strongest nonlinear reverse saturable absorption. The attenuation coefficient of the 100-MW cm-2 laser radiation in the ethanol solution of this dye is K=14. The characteristics of a single-stage high-power-laser-radiation limiter consisting of two confocal lenses with a focal distance of 5.5 cm are optimised. The maximum values of attenuation coefficients measured in experiments are 420 (for the initial transmission T0≈50%) and 170 (T0≈70%). The singlet—singlet absorption cross sections of the dyes are estimated from experiments.

Two methods are proposed for the design, one of them analytical and the other graphical. The analytical one forces the condition that the compensator gives its maximum phase, phim at the gain crossover frequency, omega m The graphical one allows the use of a graphical criterion for the obtaining of the parameters of the FOLC. This criterion is based on the lead regions defined for the compensator in the complex plane, depending on the value of alpha.

Among the various modes of action proposed so far is the effect of the differential expression of HLA class II genes in different types of antigen-presenting cells on the Th1/Th2 balance. The aim of this study was to investigate the differential expression of genes encoded within the RA-associated HLA-DR4 superhaplotype and within the neutral DR7 and DR9 superhaplotypes.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThe promoters encoded within these 3 haplotypes were first analyzed for sequence polymorphisms. To test for functional consequences, we assumed that the binding of nuclear factors to the promoter elements was correlated with the transcription activity, and we used surface plasmon resonance technology. To that end, oligonucleotides representing the polymorphic regulatory sequences and nuclear extracts from a monocyte cell line and a B cell line were used.\n\n\nRESULTS\nWhile the promoters of the highly polymorphic HLA-DRB1*04, *07, and *09 alleles showed comparable binding of nuclear factors, differential binding was observed for the 2 promoters that drive the relatively nonpolymorphic DRB4 alleles in linkage disequilibrium with DRB1. Interestingly, analysis of RA patients positive for DR4, DR7, and DR9 revealed the segregation of radiographic progression with the stronger of the 2 DRB4 promoters, independent of the DRB1 allele. Moreover, DRB1*04 alleles in RA patients showed a reduced association with the DRB4 splice variant, completely preventing DRB4 expression.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nOur findings represent the first evidence of a correlation between the differential expression of HLA class II genes and both the susceptibility and the progression of RA.","inCitations":["fb47a672c854426304820d25b9c46f95bf36d656","21e158ee5102bae4b59421bb56fc6f0ae2c4467e","f51574ba471eee4260e650d0bcd26fb427db1a1f","7b465de55eae5d508fdab45e9d96805b44f5b79d","ba1f7a854581e9d91face648e80896cd87afc08d","37f0b08b76199400fd477f14ced7c9013e717725","48111e2b3a0994d78e231cf416c0d62e08a18047","2bdffbd5b6624dd9792800409684f3d466c020f3","833cdaeddcb3e3014d36ae2c9629276d931d55e7","ac93f4d381dad7ed0f328a270b65e7bda9434405","02bfa9153c4cf80f41e334be5eed36638e2315a8","6e67e60f3ae8de8587318ca677709b1e78415d3f","c14b724b2a70a78570aaddaedbb0254a59bad3ab"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Differential expression of HLA class II genes associated with disease susceptibility and progression in rheumatoid arthritis.","doi":"10.1002/art.11251","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1002/art.11251","venue":"Arthritis and rheumatism"}

Between January 2001 and December 2003, a retrospective study on all adult patients with documented TST results treated for tuberculosis (TB) in chest clinics of two government hospitals was conducted to determine the reliability of TST and factors affecting its interpretation. One hundred and three patients [mean age (SD): 43 (17); male: 67%] were eligible for data collection: 72% and 57% of patients had positive TST results based on cut-off points of 10mm and 15mm respectively. The only significant univariate association with TST results was the severity of co-morbidity. A patient with co-morbidity score of 3 defined as those with any cancer, end-stage renal or liver disease, or HIV disease, was more likely to have a negative TST results [10mm cut-off point: Odd Ratio (95% CI) 6.6 (1.82 to 24.35), p = 0.003; 15mm cut-off point: 4.8 (1.21 to 18.95), p = 0.012]. A TST reading of 10mm had a higher sensitivity than 15mm as the cut-off point in diagnosing TB infection. Considering all possible confounding factors like ethnicity, prior BCG vaccination and TB burden in the population, severity of co-morbidity remains strongly predictive of a negative TST. Caution should be exercised in interpreting TST in these patients.","inCitations":["1e4da2449bba4aef55433afdeaa954ca23203265","b755eeeed9189dc56c1b0cf454125707c47e37d3","831a7a4468b97b505832a7a0d95e155273e7e4c1"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.e-mjm.org/2005/v60n4/Tuberculosis.pdf"],"title":"Influence of co-morbidity in the interpretation of tuberculin skin reactivity in multi-ethnic adult patients with tuberculosis.","doi":"","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"The Medical journal of Malaysia"}

This triggers a cascade of inflammatory reactions, in which monocytes, macrophages, T lymphocytes, vascular smooth muscle cells actively participate. Particularly, atherosclerotic lesions have been seen to have increased expression of T helper-1 cells together with increased levels of the T helper-1 related pro-inflammatory cytokines. Along with pro-inflammatory cytokines, other molecular factors involved in atherosclerosis appearance, progression and complication include chemokines, growth factors, vasoactive substances, enzymes, apoptosis signals and many others. Many of these molecular factors are both involved as possible markers of the atherosclerotic disease activity and burden, but may also play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of the disease. In recent years, the discovery of progenitor cells of myeloid origin has offered the prospect of merging the most recent theories on the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis with the evolving concept of a role of these progenitor cells in the repair of the injured vessel wall and the neovascularisation of ischemic tissues. This review summarizes current knowledge about the biology of atherosclerosis with emphasis on the mechanisms of endothelial damage and repair and on the concept that the turnover and replacement of endothelial cells is a major determinant in the maintenance of vascular integrity.","inCitations":["164f2d35477493b4448256f27dbc86aee8f3a156","0570cdc9b1438de876be0dfa1f597bf30bd3bb9c","b6d5db1ae4f6ac9a05a00a153ba3d3240e85de8d","82e0afd5055e3ad6549bd57a59a3a54e4fdb041a","4e41594d42c5b3698de02321a253eccd58bfcc7b","62465786176d1d082cb914f0bb9020f7a951f840","605b9e08460899d4d273ca6f0a6c0d5969416ee5","d53f7eae1d133989e0d743f148befb41d0aa354c","a350cb962afa1e8e8a33f3fe8aa45eb7e661e6fc","1d2e30f2125825c9f2a62dbecae4396421ff6e74","41a97a1991d39075eecbd9e4d5b4039dfd2ff330"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Molecular biology of atherosclerosis.","doi":"","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"Clinical cases in mineral and bone metabolism : the official journal of the Italian Society of Osteoporosis, Mineral Metabolism, and Skeletal Diseases"}

All plastics used in thyristor valves should be subjected to fire tests. Tests should measure properties of the material. such as heat release rate, flame spread, and ease of ignition and self-quenching.

The corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA) was counting fingers in the right eye and light perception (LP) in the left eye. Slitlamp examination revealed diffuse, galaxy-like, golden-brown confluent deposits on the cornea, sclera, and conjunctiva of both eyes. The eyes were irrigated several times, followed by foreign-body removal and corneal repair. A penetrating keratoplasty was later performed in the right eye. After 1 year of follow-up, the patient was asymptomatic and the CDVA improved in the right eye but remained LP in the left eye due to macular scar formation secondary to severe tractional macular edema.

Better understanding of complex regulation and key molecules involved in glioma pathology are needed for designing new and effective treatment modalities. Activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK) pathway is known to be having a critical role in cell proliferation and differentiation during the invasion and metastasis of the tumor cells. In the present study, N-ethyl N-nitrosourea induced glioma rat model was used to understand the role of ERK1/2 and Akt pathways in the progression of tumor malignancy. Twenty-four glioma rat brains of early (P90) and progressive (P180) stages were used for histological and immunoblot analysis. Results have shown increased levels of activated ERK1/2, activated Akt or protein kinase B, Bcl-2 and pBad in the glioma rats. This study may indicate increased cell proliferation and angiogenesis, mediated through activation of both ERK and Akt pathways along with increased levels of pBad. Further, pAkt and Bcl-2 levels in the progressive stage glioma rats may indicate existence of sustained tumor cell survival signals. Moreover, enhanced pBad levels in tumor may indicate that there are anti-apoptotic mechanisms, further making the malignant cells resistant to apoptosis.","inCitations":["52b444c73ec8a80daae4a5ffa2c3a8f19b42d474","0eacb65481652c7ea6f151194e77af3f3e0db7e9","462f37041715859c4237fae5cec17c3fe4c2a04b","efeee970f4dd483288eb1ce7e51fd3913fff22ed","963c2286fab58ea440ef981855457d446fc9cdd6","24063df30002a0a0377d4413232327fcc514c245","970a9aa8f1f5c00679e9c88e320c9637b1ed51ef","e78beedda57861d5a83178ce3be264439d2a0516","cc3a8bb6c9a78c42e398167fe587bafabaaafbcd","1a7d231e05b945301a7a17a51822a74f62b6761a","7589795a61cc37ae234cbabd03d113b301c18244","c7c4811da2bd5fe438ccf4fca9b7e3be13c5ddd5","3b17732ab86df3637838f7e9241006c4488f84aa","fa3daad71024ee523cbc183570d51507d60c0d93"],"pdfUrls":["http://ugcfrp.ac.in/images/userfiles/14052-Neuro_chem_res.pdf"],"title":"pERK, pAkt and pBad: A Possible Role in Cell Proliferation and Sustained Cellular Survival During Tumorigenesis and Tumor Progression in ENU Induced Transplacental Glioma Rat Model","doi":"10.1007/s11064-006-9142-7","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11064-006-9142-7","venue":"Neurochemical Research"}

(Ginkgoaceae) originated from China, first introduced to Europe in the 18th century, it is now distributed all over the world. The leaves of Ginkgo biloba include a rich complex of active compounds responsible for various pharmacological properties. Ginkgo biloba extract improves blood circulation, protects against oxidative cell damage, blocks platelet aggregation that could be important for prevention of cardiovascular diseases. Therefore the fluid extract from Ginkgo biloba leaves was prepared and tested for it is effect on rat mitochondrial function. Our data showed that 0.5 microl/ml of GE (containing 0.57 ng/ml of rutin, 0.23 ng/ml of quercitrin, 0.105 ng/ml of hyperosid and 0.02 ng/ml of quercetin) had no effect on the State 2 respiration rate of mitochondria with all used substrates: pyruvate+malate, succinate and palmitoyl-L-carnitine. Further increase in GE concentration (2 and 4 microl/ml), increased the State 2 respiration rate with all respiratory substrates in a dose-dependent manner (by 35-116%). The State 3 respiration rate was not affected by GE. In order to identify which compounds of GE could be responsible for the observed effects, we measured the effect of pure flavonoids: rutin, quercetin, hyperosid and quercitrin on mitochondrial respiration. All flavonoids (except of hyperosid) at maximal used concentration, comparable/identical to that in GE, stimulated the State 2 respiration rate only by 8-20%, i.e. less effectively as compared to GE. Therefore, for the explanation of the GE-induced uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation, other biologically active compounds of GE have to be taken into account in future studies.","inCitations":["93c34029352cfe186bd3efc3ad59679fe18f84a7","c4bbb90445a226cbee0169c9af5e537c6bdb6bc8","9f069b89beb43069e6ea7e3c84786d2fcdbb606b","e1e32217826929cb609075e6decc9b2744b34ddc","5d5ae43654f4e71ead729976acc3db160762aa68","9d8c25083608bfc4a0eb2c238938be039273fbd7","7b5b9e7c4e4c53e9d14579be4add9477e17b7a5f","0eea26a47a2af66fdf5b3c1a5e04ebd09a164a26","bf0e3eb73aa2ae96a6f0a9bf2926cc377ecf9f04","cf84cbe41b047f06ceaadfcafa25c12913c957c2","1b0874ff0fd3ac33db48ab405d694daf423bff76","addddd405326070c3c2a638a00ca117a66272ea6","3e56368a54292dfcc50cb73e493114de5e7f7a76","534b927e1b38633c75abb144fabb55d9f5c95823","0e97a4154fe7d7c9ad7dc38e108fe06003d8c9e0","26c80adeda6c89def8ed4d1d1063e7cb9847c0cb","df03a5b7d98a594d0b28d54f19458ac9faec6e82"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Effect of Ginkgo biloba extract on the rat heart mitochondrial function.","doi":"10.1016/j.jep.2006.12.028","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2006.12.028","venue":"Journal of ethnopharmacology"}

The relationship between the glycemic variability and HbA1c level was assessed in these patients.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe mean amplitude of glycemic excursions (MAGE) in patients with HbA1c ≥7.0% was significantly higher than in patients with HbA1c <7.0% (4.33±1.67 vs. 3.48±1.46 mmol/L, p<0.001). A simple (Pearson's) correlation analysis indicated that the MAGE was significantly correlated with the HbA1c (r=0.229, p<0.001). Compared with the lowest quartile, the highest quartile of the MAGE was associated with a significantly increased risk of having a HbA1c ≥7.0% after multiple adjustments (p (for trend) <0.001).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe glycemic variability had a significant influence on the HbA1c level in elderly male patients with T2DM. The present data suggests that patients with higher glycemic variability might have higher HbA1c levels.","inCitations":["e13708ea525c1a3fa7a69c7d6357567930924fdf","ee5dcc895072830a6b84538997e73e9d2cd23991","91de1675b093c5bd19fcd2aa3ba04f1e65fc61e5","97c86268dbfb333015f2c75840cb5c791320cd2f","828d8d8bbca5dd32f42428beb98223650d1a3e7c","96d47798786ca9083edf7e3a7f75e34dab0077e3","6dba6f3ce3f1ff096cf33e352f5a80fd394c8bc0"],"pdfUrls":["https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/internalmedicine/51/22/51_51.8077/_pdf/-char/en"],"title":"Influence of glycemic variability on the HbA1c level in elderly male patients with type 2 diabetes.","doi":"10.2169/internalmedicine.51.8077","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.2169/internalmedicine.51.8077","venue":"Internal medicine"}

These limitations constrain the interaction vocabulary available to interactive surface systems. In our work, we extend the surface interaction space by using muscle sensing to provide complementary information about finger movement and posture. In this paper, we describe a novel system that combines muscle sensing with a multi-touch tabletop, and introduce a series of new interaction techniques enabled by this combination. We present observations from an initial system evaluation and discuss the limitations and challenges of utilizing muscle sensing for tabletop applications.","inCitations":["6c30879e2536a5630e348fb8c1a6f2039486c556","8ebd9dd650088d7bd593f3d98c2c02621ea1f377","b2f302c538d94f98f3b32da2a472dffa57021eac","b4d08ffec4bfea49082c4401e909a52e54d7b7db","33f9759a689b53862d508fd18f25c852776e4271","ad3dc327dccaabde7caa282251269424c10dc58d","b253c26d8728fb59f1fb3d3023a07e169a717681","d553e6cce99a1a71a066df3ce40317e13ee8551b","967710d4c6d2efc145c70acccc314a2c6d2ec595","ce1419b63822ce88efba2ff2e9b92033de7b64e7","e5cab15298023404cbe015852a5773770832230d","eb64c0e0717cee41e6dff1d83c1b131290402071","7a95b0ddca0749c0ccf5b4e7d5b20de1b6d3ae81","ab58774577016ce7fa69ff8646d478905d7dffe9","f6d0b7a88c490e02e6c105466679b89b2f6c7697","a213ca8076ad3c015c9a18eed40d797d739d9911","d933276882a35485622f218f4f36eb65c6776343","972c7655e1f4b7752c795e6c2ef2dc858e2ccae2","e15aa8994ccbd552bf5ff6c0de135726e29840e2","64808ab23783dfea387158629020542ef2ca9adf","8c2ea6debd2789eb9a082690a339c1b39d655616","d448808795abcf085769257b1fa131a0e2470cef","9912bcb128cd93ad07af85675ccd59791fc72c9d","539bbcfbec11d6f2a27221b964e2b859035034ec","ea0f73d440a378774f4766291ad795add0c2b6c4","63309bcaced304512320b086c53fbf4dce342068","61f0ca0ab7d1cf7bba9bca776f7ef78a6a634e4d","86e517c0994547957fac9ab016e5e3b997ac12eb","540aa8f392b871eaecf74f4e3ebb053e1c18019f","74c4ac4debb88aeca28dfa8b7c389cef3aaa737b","368fab463ef312ad4b7df5943d6bb7bd57babd8e","3e303a1c355a0e8f61beb1eb4cfb7524b6cf0f11","379585a383e5b8d16f5eeb3276f9935064b0b983","a0a1337cbf6629dddd5d9f812d496c18acdb1c92","19d3ad17037110e0fb2327f0ac1bb87083250ca9","167d7de20e21c1679d91b50fcb8317444be83ad6","5bc065402ba4ae6f6a96ac26e83e55001123548c","d88ce02ef49e28b68946cbf6cf4003e7f9bbecca","ec1179d247dc3f506b45387267418491be52e38f","8212eb22fa5ec6a73cb70d100c39779255b4ebac","b8c87be2d685c0f47c72a3a7c78128aaf48dc1c3","e7a078b1a09ee8a7ae9946fdc39c6b0e253520fb","26dbeea224bfcfea2ac29dca35176a1f2f5c60f0","da79e2abc4b3bb0a08680169bbcac5f1663ad8a6","1a0bdfa38671178907487f1dbc86badec8ea0fe0","236933c5fbbedd137c562226085228f327e08740","fd4cf84b74f5678912bc7f8c0fd8a21b8ad4b7bb","ac89f9afcf8dbd9903a37b1c8764983a744dac57","63f91d64d2151176505abca9ca33c40a2802618e","f33d7af3b578183f14b8410dde95a1902cbdf3a5","342d36c2debd4db32db27168a352ee2eb0292330","001f0d8c7ae8e56e32e9dbc4cbfc779b844ae156","a173e79efa2689137235b80eecb5574eac8d055a","8c8ff991cba2cca9b92263bb54dd3890a408af3e","cafe4e2d4c418ced29004cf6437120d3bff9b30a","6a2d794f9ce27a30eede8cf723620b431b50a9a1","a370777deb03ac55c05a135b9d701d7ef21ee5c2","ecd46171da10d421877ca5fc0b9737aa1ecf77fe","47792276fea59c1af052e0276866a800d29521bf","18d8e8d38abae3637ca885e0d88c2bb5267e5828","19751ffa9996e0a35fca4ef9d62debcded82dc95"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.techhouse.org/~dmorris/publications/EMG_Surface_Tabletop_2009.pdf","http://research.microsoft.com/cue/publications/EMG_Surface_Tabletop_2009.pdf","https://www.online.cs.washington.edu/sites/default/files/hci/papers/EMG_Surface_ITS_2009_CameraReady.pdf","http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/dan/emgsurface/emg_surface_tabletop_2009.pdf","http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/ssaponas/publications/EMG_Surface_ITS_2009_CameraReady.pdf","http://www.cs.washington.edu/sites/default/files/hci/papers/EMG_Surface_ITS_2009_CameraReady.pdf","http://research.microsoft.com/users/desney/publications/ITS2009-SurfaceEMG.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/1731903.1731924","https://www.cs.washington.edu/sites/default/files/hci/papers/EMG_Surface_ITS_2009_CameraReady.pdf","http://research.microsoft.com/users/dan/emgsurface/EMG_Surface_Tabletop_2009.pdf","http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/ssaponas/publications/EMG_Surface_ITS_2009_CameraReady.pdf","http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/desney/publications/ITS2009-SurfaceEMG.pdf","http://www.research.microsoft.com/~desney/publications/ITS2009-SurfaceEMG.pdf","http://dub.washington.edu/djangosite/media/papers/EMG_Surface_ITS_2009_CameraReady.pdf","http://www.cs.tufts.edu/~jacob/250pbi/EMG_Surface_Tabletop_2009.tan.pdf","http://research.microsoft.com/~desney/publications/ITS2009-SurfaceEMG.pdf","http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/redmond/groups/cue/publications/EMG_Surface_Tabletop_2009.pdf","http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/dan/emgsurface/EMG_Surface_Tabletop_2009.pdf","https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/EMG_Surface_Tabletop_2009.pdf","http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/desney/publications/its2009-surfaceemg.pdf"],"title":"Enhancing input on and above the interactive surface with muscle sensing","doi":"10.1145/1731903.1731924","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1145/1731903.1731924","venue":"ITS '09"}

Load–displacement curves obtained from a depth-sensing indentation instrument were used to evaluate the viscoelastic–plastic properties of these aromatic polyesters. The depths investigated lay within the micrometre scale. Hardness values derived from this technique have been compared with those obtained using a microindentation tester. The influence of particle morphology and unit cell symmetry on the mechanical properties of these materials was also investigated. The possible variation of hardness with the sintering pressure applied to the sample during preparation has been examined. The viscoelastoplastic properties of these new aromatic polyesters are discussed in the light of those previously reported for related aromatic homopolymers.","inCitations":["bd96bdfc8fce78005a74294654859ac97f77387b","5492a4ce92e3aff8e45ce273007e47cea77bc4c8"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Mechanical study of sintered aromatic polyesters as revealed by microindentation measurements","doi":"10.1023/A:1004643026386","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1023/A%3A1004643026386","venue":""}

In previous work, we considered discriminating rural and urban regions. However, a more detailed classification is required for many purposes. These fine classifications assist government agencies in many ways including urban planning, transportation management, and rescue operations. In a step toward the automation of the fine classification process, this paper explores graph theoretical measures over grayscale images. The graphs are constructed by assigning photometric straight-line segments to vertices, while graph edges encode their spatial relationships. We then introduce a set of measures based on various properties of the graph. These measures are nearly monotonic (positively correlated) with increasing structure (organization) in the image. Thus, increased cultural activity and land development are indicated by increases in these measures - without explicit extraction of road networks, buildings, residences, etc. These latter, time consuming (and still only partially automated) tasks can be restricted only to \"promising\" image regions, according to our measures. In some applications our measures may suffice. We present a theoretical basis for the measures followed by extensive experimental results in which the measures are first compared to manual evaluations of land development. We then present and test a method to focus on, and (pre)extract, suburban-style residential areas. These are of particular importance in many applications, and are especially difficult to extract. In this work, we consider commercial IKONOS data. These images are orthorectified to provide a fixed resolution of 1 meter per pixel on the ground. They are, therefore, metric in the sense that ground distance is fixed in scale to pixel distance. Our data set is large and diverse, including sea and coastline, rural, forest, residential, industrial, and urban areas.","inCitations":["5b5859e196cc3bbd4222428d07b94a37f178adea","f18130964db695d7730de1362ad34fc849a6ea54","852839e48c1db6996386a3264619355a0b180fc0","43c4955fa6bda84946bedf3460a7c8be5ebde4fb"],"pdfUrls":["http://vision.yeditepe.edu.tr/files/graphorg.pdf","http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/ICPR.2004.1334040"],"title":"A theoretical and experimental investigation of graph theoretical measures for land development in satellite imagery","doi":"10.1109/ICPR.2004.1334040","sources":["Medline","DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPR.2004.1334040","venue":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence"}

Writing from the perspective of the queer of color, this reflexive practice plays on the idea of the ethnographic researcher as an alien entity that invades a social setting, thereby calling attention to ethnography’s colonial history. I model this practice by sharing an ethnographic narrative from my research with a Ghanaian community in Houston, Texas. Rather than contain reflexivity to a methodological appendix or footnote, invading ethnography strategically interrupts the ethnographic narrative to illustrate how normative assumptions about gender and sexuality not only shape the organization of social spaces, but also inform ethnographic possibilities. In so doing, this article performs a decolonial option by destabilizing the powerful position of the narrator through an interruption of the ethnographic narrative.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Invading ethnography: A queer of color reflexive practice","doi":"10.1177/1466138117741502","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1177/1466138117741502","venue":""}

These sharks possessed a pavement dentition suited to a diet of hard-shelled macroinvertebrates (durophagy), leading several studies to variously describe Ptychodus as a batoid, a hybodont shark, or a selachimorph. Members of the Selachimorpha share one dental synapomorphy, a triple-layered enameloid (TLE) consisting of an outer shiny-layered enameloid (SLE) of randomly oriented hydroxyapatite crystallites, a middle layer of parallel-bundled enameloid (PBE), and an inner layer of tangled-bundled enameloid (TBE). Batoids and hybodonts both have teeth with single crystallite enameloid (SCE). We examined teeth from Ptychodus collected from the Lincoln Limestone of the Greenhorn Formation of Barton County, Kansas, and compared their enameloid ultrastructure with that of a Carboniferous hybodontiform and the Cretaceous lamniform shark Squalicorax curvatus Williston, 1900. Scanning electron microscopic examination of Ptychodus shows that crystallite bundling in the form of a TLE is evident in these teeth. The PBE is most apparent at transverse enameloid ridges of Ptychodus teeth. Columns of dentine penetrate into the tooth enameloid, and the crystallites near the dentine are randomly oriented. These observations bolster the argument that Ptychodus is a genus of highly specialized selachimorph shark, rather than a hybodont or batoid.","inCitations":["2ea0ee032a631f9d5f5398bcf841adde518d5609","c60554e67a256203edf2cf39d2838a9704b3e167","b8b3f08bf6630c4a0ba6dc8cd4ff37ca77743ed6","de4c5be769c9b19af087dcdd6287ccf6a31b9d5b","19b2768e4b649305b2751a51d597320f3fa01408"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Scanning electron microscope examination of the dental enameloid of the Cretaceous durophagous shark Ptychodus supports neoselachian classification","doi":"10.1017/jpa.2016.64","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1017/jpa.2016.64","venue":"Journal of Paleontology"}

Separate lines of research have identified the 5-lipoxygenase/leukotriene B(4) receptor pathway and the PPARgamma pathway as potential targets for prevention or treatment of this disease. LY293111 was originally designed as a potent leukotriene B(4) receptor antagonist for treatment of inflammatory conditions. LY293111 was also known to have inhibitory effects on 5-lipoxygenase, which is upstream of the production of leukotrienes. LY293111 was shown to have potent anticancer effects in pancreatic cancer and several other solid malignancies, where it caused cell cycle arrest and marked apoptosis. Subsequently, it came to light that LY293111 exhibited PPARgamma agonist activity in addition to its effects on the 5-lipoxygenase pathway. This raises the question of which of the two targets is of greatest importance with regard to the anticancer effects of this agent. The evidence to date is not conclusive, but suggests that the effects of LY293111 may be mediated by both LTB(4) receptors and PPARgamma.","inCitations":["4d66cc0301ba82735afa7a3410532b0e089ba84b","ca1d5b51b112c13e2940038e2bcb0634b0ddee83","cf66b9b6bdd6d3651b57644d934d705c605b3bc9","775b3c95ade9459a89d9b01c8feac288771b8d00","3ff47014e93a9bce6240cc66927678848f04914a","f426f80f45620f5fdb7da5021d5d841712779526","37f7b06531a3f29ca8e55ae7969c37dd7b91f176","75ef882a488484da839726f9b1b7cedc03e8bc42","8e3f88080e0a7f7683e068e14daa76fef35db86c"],"pdfUrls":["http://downloads.hindawi.com/journals/ppar/2008/827096.pdf","ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/pmc/cc/00/PPAR_Res_2008_Jan_27_2008_827096.tar.gz"],"title":"The Role of PPARγ Receptors and Leukotriene B4 Receptors in Mediating the Effects of LY293111 in Pancreatic Cancer","doi":"10.1155/2008/827096","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1155/2008%2F827096","venue":"PPAR research"}

The initial evaluation includes a careful history taking focused on risk factors for malignancy, a thorough physical examination, comparison of current chest films with previous ones, and CT scanning. Radiologic signs that suggest malignancy include lesion size greater than 2 cm in diameter, spiculated margins, lack of calcification, and change in size. Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery or thoracotomy is the next step for patients with a suspected malignant lesion. If the results of the initial evaluation are equivocal, positron emission tomography (PET) scanning is the preferred follow-up.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"The Solitary Lung Nodule","doi":"10.1016/b978-1-4160-6161-8.00014-x","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-1-4160-6161-8.00014-x","venue":""}

We constructed the cumulative species discovery curve for human viruses going back to 1901. We fitted a statistical model to these data; the shape of the curve strongly suggests that the process of virus discovery is far from complete. We generated a 95% credible interval for the pool of as yet undiscovered virus species of 38–562. We extrapolated the curve and generated an estimate of 10–40 new species to be discovered by 2020. Although we cannot predict the level of health threat that these new viruses will present, we conclude that novel virus species must be anticipated in public health planning. More systematic virus discovery programmes, covering both humans and potential animal reservoirs of human viruses, should be considered.","inCitations":["f4e6726fd4c271ec7646cb286c62a9b616d87b34","c67690249c217f220bef3fea005ebfa5d928bef9","7301f8f63dbe8741e500d9057627145007927e19","0c81666d45e796695ef6464e3473f585a591ef90","ce5b1df391feeb18d2eba54d1506a3928bc5a9cc","bd84b3e6fc372fcda2263ed1868602ac5854eaa5","f8fc63b7b28d1bc7c6a9a461bcb9cfb73c1586f0","e4531032389c3b16f49b0c815e89579ccd4538a4","282c87d2e2d605259169e41b1fd66015384d87cb","2640e2a4f9134981693e640153a32136bf0e0195","81bc4a1294fbfb60939181cab8dc2476d1a0daf7","b21adde0d48c177153c54d309055d0027af576b8","73eee0a2bef0ed2414da19d441283224da1988be","2b65de11d43ef6d2b2747b4507f4c4612640a219","de068bcbd97948c11c247ddcfada20239d622512","901dac612f927e78e188df9f6a23f210a3e97dc5","458c7a3834fe7990660f168617769e085f748850","d9c0e42bbfb10589ac90fb3c8b83613110a1d1cc","da5a6324dbddc1e262ef2f95be701460ff53a4b2","006c3ab84e397f2992f05a42025829b75ea1705a","e76c42a1c1f7ca56b5278cdcccd08a062a7a4a38","eafa4d1bd1e62bf88d6d2813002cfe6c33be8b95","d50b76ea02078bc3e34af6b8012cd092ba70e2e2","b540b7d8548c6deb8d30c76aa12fa9ce2643b288","ac0168c94cd402f807154042987aeee2f20e5daf","05a28607672458d47ba20c1092e4e5533a9b0dcb","ae7b6ef08f7d452c4bbadbd742001c79edf69bfd","11db61780a9968798d678e9ae1e4a6bfad327a89","b6aaa812b1328c197742f99a19de18480c709dbe","ab4a9c1c951ff50566a52e005671dd53a0003b30","fa2b700a1d8b22650d0cbb608436c5d855ec3d5c","f5ecd87f34985493e725aad05fd94a009b171e47","da47cadf1cef48d1fbcac6f6301899a970ccca7c","412f469e79dae7163f17ba126e522d84acdcb09a","fa890a9056e2ed7c0b1b96382fea5978cdd04fdb","03652bd9c132a52eeb1c8e5b1218393970e30b07","b5114a48582785f388bb7fade5ce5b4fb6bc802d","c65a36ee0af9a6fb837c88f35394db74f90704f4","6221bb8633128658bdc306051ca8fd296062cfb5","4230a09e0ec8e9000a75c6d9c79c59ee16cbc79f","ff2ac3737c6edf81ff29b8d72c3abc2b3df5b344","ae2dd9b11e934b9da7be360cf2b8acdb9718c5d9","081febf70cac4e23ee0158cdb55587071f69a2de","58798d2351863d000beb732e978cbb4e4640c857","c72ac62a2ee7d72e1e1e0b827850287e5823147f","ac7b6fb3644cc202c22cea7e5f8f7505f43aa4fe","2809062bba0968a79d5b532906965d58a9f1d72a","efcd018d285b433adf28d661bd36de5e66443136","636602111de47e754f0f12eecc889d0a4976b7a7","675a752acaa31ebdf1326da6943e1295678d45db","3eabfa97818a8bf799aee13ac071a97296cbab2a","09b444481a8d7f5fedd602f5d09c54761d6c4020","3b4ba63c6f8aeb0705d296344beb76babbbfd45f","69d2cd625c8db60049cc8c46977921216a2e94b6","3252d09041e83eb259e3f3377185fc04c22a3afc","1b66634eb4d771dff4d8f5ca8eb8c001ffe6a05e","eeccff1a37ce5062b7365c73d5dea1464cca250a","0e78935692851b0466f5a9234adb024e7735c8a3","8e3ec992e7550b0ecff85e271a23ccda0603b055","a927bf89829d338f660fafb9c1bf066f16da479c","df8cba010958a32a980484f9f846b511ce9afc9d","b95e3958a9ced4a11d8652a4f44613bdffa4ec0f","b2fcf6ff0bb9adc9cbe79fba867ac21e52ee7e74"],"pdfUrls":["http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/royprsb/275/1647/2111.full.pdf","http://www.research.ed.ac.uk/portal/files/9302047/Temporal_trends_in_the_discovery_of_human_viruses.pdf","https://www.scienceopen.com/document_file/61d4a701-d18d-4fc7-a74d-dbd34ff194d7/PubMedCentral/61d4a701-d18d-4fc7-a74d-dbd34ff194d7.pdf","http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/panels_ajax_tab/roysoc_tab_pdf/node:18391/1","ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/pmc/72/55/Proc_Biol_Sci_2008_Sep_22_275(1647)_2111-2115.tar.gz","http://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/pmc/72/55/rspb20080294.PMC2475551.pdf","https://www.research.ed.ac.uk/portal/files/9302047/Temporal_trends_in_the_discovery_of_human_viruses.pdf","http://www.homepages.ed.ac.uk/nsavill/Papers/virus.pdf"],"title":"Temporal trends in the discovery of human viruses","doi":"10.1098/rspb.2008.0294","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2008.0294","venue":"Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences"}

Products underpinned by nanotechnology have increased by nearly 516% between the years 2006 -2013. A large number of patents based on nanotechnology are in the sphere of personnel care products. On the other hand there are several safety issues that are gaining continuous attention. In the light of current knowledge, agencies like the Federal Drug Administration (US) and Directive of EU Regulation and International Cooperation on Cosmetic Regulation established laws for continuous testing and transparency in the research based on nanocosmetics.

The results showed that the PPKT program for EM students was not on target and needed to be stopped immediately or replaced with another program whose value was equivalent because: (1) Theoretically contextual, the PPKT was intended for students from study-based study programs so that it was not suitable for EM students ; (2) From the Input aspect, students face the constraints of planning, implementing and evaluating learning, the weak competency of supervisors because their educational background is not from an education degree, teaching staff lack competency; (3) Based on the Process aspect, the PPKT implementation is not appropriate expected especially in teaching and research activities because the supervisor and tutor are not able to carry out their duties and functions properly; and (4) From the Product aspect, PPKT has not been able to improve teaching competence, educational research, educational creation and innovation. The acquisition of a high final score does not reflect their competence because more assessment is based on the subjectivity of tutors and tutors. Based on the results of the study, it was suggested that the Head of the EM Department need to reformulate the vision, mission and competency standards of graduates who are more referring to the competence of education staff, encouraging faculty leaders to immediately issue a decision to terminate the PPKT program for EM students and replace it with other programs with the same weight as PPKT.

Hence, studies of LD detonations by laboratory experiments can contribute to the field of inertial confinement fusion [3] and/or supernova explosion [4], which are relevant to NCD detonations.

We estimated incidence rates based on the distribution of marital status of the female population of these seven areas as of 1980; adjustment for the prevalence of intact uteri in the estimated populationat-risk was performed using data from a survey of a representative sample of the United States population in 1982-1984. The incidence of uterine sarcoma was higher among never-married compared to ever-married women (rate ratio, 1.5; 95% confidence intervals, 1.3, 1.8). The associa tion with marital status was similar for each of the three major histolÃ3g ica! categories (leiomyosarcomas, malignant mixed mullerian tumors, and endometrial stromal sarcomas).

The main challenges involved in a deepwater project are the riser sizing, management of external pressure at maximum water depth with acceptable weight to keep low stress at riser-vessel interface, the riser/vessel dynamic interaction and riser installation. The most critical areas on the riser system are the top section, where most of the damage occurs, and the touch-down zone. While the second area can be addressed by effective riser design, the connection to the production facility is always required and it must be sufficiently strong to provide an appropriate fluid containment. A connector failure can lead to highly flammable fluid leakage, putting in danger the entire production vessel and the surrounding environment. Technological advancements are leading to new equipment layouts with more efficient materials selection. The top section and connector can be subjected to different kinds of loads and environment induced degradation.Applying the actual standards is sometimes difficult due to the fact that they generally are too conservative. With the objective of closing this gap, this paper provides an overview of the issues regarding different types of connectors in different working environments. The criteria for achieving an optimum connection selection depends on the type of riser utilized, riser configuration, metocean conditions, support vessel type, properties of fluid/chemicals transported inside the riser, life expectancy, maintenance and accessibility. Three main kinds of connection seals were analyzed, namely pure metallurgical (i.e. welding), pure mechanical (i.e. flange, threaded connections) and a combination thereof for line-end interface (i.e. metal-to-composite). All of the seals must provide retention of internal fluids and exclusion of external fluids and impurities. In an offshore environment, both of these characteristics must be achieved through the use of at least one metal-to-metal contact between mating interfaces and one static seal (i.e. metal rings).Copyright © 2013 by ASME","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Connectors for Production Risers","doi":"10.1115/OMAE2013-10899","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1115/OMAE2013-10899","venue":""}

The effects of the dead volume on the electrophoretic separation were simulated and evaluated by using a simulation software. A novel connecting PMMA electrophoresis chips to capillaries with the minimal dead volume was presented. A hole was drilled into the edge of the chip by using a 500 μm standard drill bit, then a home-made flattened drill bit was used to flatten the conical area, so a flattened-bottom hole was created, and a 375 μm-o.d. fused-silica capillary was inserted into the hole and fixed by using epoxy, which decreases the dead volume from 3.9 to 0.1 nL. The detecting point of the UV-absorption detection was put on the fused-silica capillary, so the electrophoresis on the PMMA chip could be directly detected by an UV-absorption detector. The electrophoretic analysis of vitamin B-2 was performed on the chip, and the number of theoretical plates was 73 000/m; the electrophoretic separation of three components of sulfamethoxazole, sulfadiazine and trimethoprim tablet was also preformed, resolutions among these three components were 4.5 and 1.9, the relative standard deviations for migration time were 1.0%, 1.4% and 1.0%, and relative standard deviations for peak height were 4.1%, 3.0%, 4.1%, respectively(n=5).","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Fabrication and Applications of PMMA Electrophoresis Chips Connected to Fused-silica Capillaries","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

In 2005, DOE and CNEN started a collaborative effort to evaluate measures that can strengthen the effectiveness of international safeguards at a natural uranium conversion plant (NUCP). The work was performed by DOE s Oak Ridge National Laboratory and CNEN. A generic model of a NUCP was developed and typical processing steps were defined. Advanced instrumentation and techniques for verification purposes were identified and investigated. The scope of the work was triggered by the International Atomic Energy Agency s 2003 revised policy concerning the starting point of safeguards at uranium conversion facilities. Prior to this policy only the final products of the uranium conversion plant were considered to be of composition and purity suitable for use in the nuclear fuel cycle and therefore, subject to the IAEA safeguards control. DOE and CNEN have explored options for implementing the IAEA policy, although Brazil understands that the new policy established by the IAEA is beyond the framework of the Quadripartite Agreement of which it is one of the parties, together with Argentina, the Brazilian-Argentine Agency for Accounting and Control of Nuclear Materials (ABACC) and the IAEA. Two technical papers on this subject were published at the 2005 and 2008 INMM Annual Meetings.","inCitations":["0eeb4912409f0bf686f48066b69d889b4c14d4ab"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Model of a Generic Natural Uranium Conversion Plant ?

Стандартные параметры качества жизни, клинические проявления и перенесенное лечение лейкемии, демографические показатели оценивали с помощью линейной регрессии для идентификации факторов, влияющих на качество жизни. Установили, что пациенты с кардиоваскулярными событиями отмечали значительно худшее психологическое функционирование, ухудшение общего здоровья и жизнеспособности, снижение качества жизни. Перенесенная химиотерапия также была связана с ухудшением качества жизни. Статистическая значимость данных различий была достигнута при использовании опросника QOL-CS. Это свидетельствует, что общее состояние здоровья, жизнеспособности у пациентов с регрессией хронической лимфоцитарной лейкемии существенно ухудшается после возникновения кардиоваскулярных событий.

Усі пацієнти отримали опитувальники QOL-CS; 119 (84%) із них відповіли на питання і були залучені в дослідження. Стандартні параметри якості життя, клінічні прояви і попереднє лікування лейкемії, демографічні показники оцінювали за допомогою лінійної регресії для ідентифікації факторів, що впливають на якість життя. Встановили, що пацієнти з кардіоваскулярними подіями відзначали суттєво гірше психологічне функціювання, погіршення загального здоров’я і життєздатності, зниження якості життя. Попередня хіміотерапія також була пов’язана з погіршенням якості життя. Статистична значущість цих відмінностей досягнута тільки при використанні опитувальника QOL-CS. Це свідчить, що загальний стан здоров’я, життєздатності у пацієнтів із регресією хронічної лімфоцитарної лейкемії суттєво погіршується після виникнення кардіоваскулярних подій.

We previously verified the safety and efficacy of S-1 plus intravenous (IV) and intraperitoneal (IP) paclitaxel (PTX) in phase I and II studies (Oncology 2009, Ann Oncol 2010). We hereby report the results of 100 patients treated with this regimen at the University of Tokyo Hospital.\n\n\nMETHODS\nGastric cancer patients with macroscopic peritoneal metastasis were implanted with peritoneal access ports, and received combination chemotherapy of S-1 plus IV and IP PTX. PTX was administered IV at 50 mg/m2 and IP at 20 mg/m2 on days 1 and 8. S-1 was administered at 80 mg/m2/day for 14 consecutive days, followed by 7 days rest. Radical gastrectomy was performed when macroscopic curative resection was made achievable after the chemotherapy. Efficacy and safety were evaluated in all the patients.\n\n\nRESULTS\nBetween February 2005 and January 2011, 100 patients with peritoneal metastasis were treated, including 80 with primary tumors, 10 after palliative gastrectomy, and 10 with peritoneal recurrence. The median number of courses was 8 (range 1-48). The median survival time (MST) was 22.6 months (95% CI, 17.9-28.9 months). The MSTs of subgroups were as follows: Metastasis to the adjacent peritoneum, 49.6 months (n=10); metastases to the distant peritoneum, 19.7 months (n=90): Ascites negative, 39.3 months (n=29); ascites positive, 19.0 months (n=71): With primary tumors, 20.6 months (n=80); after palliative gastrectomy, 49.6 months (n=10); with peritoneal recurrence, 22.6 months (n=10). Out of 80 patients with primary tumors, 37 patients underwent gastrectomy after response to chemotherapy, and had a MST of 34.9 months. The frequent grade 3/4 toxic effects included neutropenia (36%), leukopenia (20%) and anemia (8%). Infection and obstruction of peritoneal access device were observed in 7 and 6 patients, respectively. There were no treatment-related deaths.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nCombination chemotherapy of S-1 plus IV and IP PTX is well tolerated and active in gastric cancer patients with peritoneal metastasis.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"S-1 plus intravenous and intraperitoneal paclitaxel for gastric cancer with peritoneal metastasis: A report of 100 cases.","doi":"10.1200/jco.2011.29.15_suppl.e14670","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1200/jco.2011.29.15_suppl.e14670","venue":"Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology"}

The city’s medieval origin is particularly evident in La Peña, the early center of the site, which developed around a defensive castle in Santa Lucía hill. The town experienced its golden age in the Middle Ages, when Carlos III decided to build a new royal palace, a decision which prompted the beginning of a medieval urban expansion area. From the last years of sixteenth century and the following centuries, Tafalla grew beyond its walls, thanks to the monasteries built by the Capuchin monks and the Franciscan Conceptionists, the homes constructed by several families (such as the Mencos, Recart de Landívar, and Vega), and bullring promoted by the municipal authorities. All these allows the Camino Real to undergo a new and significant expansion phase. The final period of urban development in the old part of the city was in the nineteenth century with the building of Plaza Nueva and the arrival of the railway system in 1859.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://www.culturanavarra.es/uploads/files/01_%20Andueza%20RPV%20243_WEB.pdf"],"title":"Arquitectura civil y desarrollo urbanístico: el caso de Tafalla en el Antiguo Régimen","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

This method could provide a means for targeted delivery of therapeutic or diagnostic agents to the brain. Brains of rabbits were targeted with 20 s burst sonications (10 ms, repetition frequency, 1 Hz.) using a focused ultrasound transducer (frequency, 260 kHz; diameter, 10 cm; radius of curvature, 8 cm) in a clinical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner. The peak rarefactional pressure amplitude during the burst was varied between 0.2 and 0.9 MPa. Each sonication was performed 10 s after an intravenous injection of an ultrasound contrast agent (Optison/sup /spl reg//). The disruption of the BBB was evaluated by injecting MRI contrast agent (Magnevist/sup /spl reg//). The animals were sacrificed at different times between 4 h and 5 weeks, after which histology or electron microscopy evaluation was performed. The results demonstrated that low frequency ultrasound bursts could induce local, reversible disruption of the BBB without undesired long-term effects. Electron microscopy showed that a large particle (horseradish peroxidase; molecular weight 40 kDa) could be delivered through the BBB disruption. This frequency is desirable since it can be focused through the intact skull without significant distortion of the ultrasound beam.","inCitations":["a8e5273514921ad836f421f6b826cdc2add74e6d","09173d5851917d0dfd4c68e92d0efa300ac911c5"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Large volume blood-brain barrier disruption by low frequency focused ultrasound: a method for targeted drug delivery and molecular imaging","doi":"10.1109/ULTSYM.2004.1417930","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ULTSYM.2004.1417930","venue":"IEEE Ultrasonics Symposium, 2004"}

The analysis proceeds in two steps: For a given flow, (1) the network is reduced to a tandem of nodes by computing the arrival bounds of cross-traffic; (2) the flow is separated from the cross-traffic by subtracting cross-flows and concatenating nodes on its path. While the second step has seen much treatment, the first step has not at all. This is in sharp contrast to the fact that arrival bounding takes roughly 80% of the total analysis time and is equally crucial for the tightness of the bounds. Therefore, we turn our attention to this first SensorNC analysis step with the goal to boost the performance and applicability of the overall framework. The main technical contribution is a generalized version of the concatenation theorem within the SensorNC setting. This generalization is instrumental in simplifying and streamlining the cross-traffic arrival bound computations such that run times can be reduced by more than a factor of 5. Even more important, it enables a localization of the information necessary to execute the calculations at the node level, thus enabling a distribution of the SensorNC analysis within a self-modeling WSN.","inCitations":["d23530351a59c22262fe1d41f95da128b22cd1f6","739733f22a7c906b5615e2ecf84e9f13f8ba7333","c7705a087b4ea780e0ae7fad497577d049d0cdea","8c8fcae50bee61e53c7a7effced4b64558d8aa13","49ee0b984b07f0a2f4e2eebd777891e4a4a9aa4e","9db71937637ec844e09abbfe1694985d00b260ce","eec5152f2613df79748cda8ae8ec5b67f37932a6","d1bc7a41747e5cdae860c801c6e5964206358088","82a7e729e2d536fd9a1db3e56fb7ab89c8bb6364","b635f2d7599bb6a6a5730a5cbdb4e878e07620db","50be4ee90ed603ae151a3692ba1a0a0ce3fe87e0","8e9e69b9031f90518378c8dfc92900a077898f5b","a8e3eb4af9602b2f33cc98fdd274da9d3cb7b99c","5a190bd04e20c855720698e3ea862dbaab5ddeee","3f942fa77d13d0209c8c7b0c0697286de4f4f6b5","52c07e8abdcc6da6343a1a93f00d869df937a4cd","b1b9ed31e429cd70500399af59d881d2559a8e41","9ad0b90c8ff9d1b68c4aca1ab52c92bc57dbb7d3","70f3a9f6a90bdb6802ec4cdc9c148ea3dac264b7","041db439afddc4f991fcdc401089c0b6fa181ecb","dfc542aea5c3959387560bb902767f7d24aa0517","321cfe8ce7342d09fb173d04bdb5158345fd8ade","efdaf9bad6c3a9b19dd01ec4d7259caa748779a6"],"pdfUrls":["http://disco.informatik.uni-kl.de/discofiles/publicationsfiles/BS15.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1109/INFOCOM.2015.7218387","https://disco.cs.uni-kl.de/discofiles/publicationsfiles/BS15.pdf"],"title":"Boosting sensor network calculus by thoroughly bounding cross-traffic","doi":"10.1109/INFOCOM.2015.7218387","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFOCOM.2015.7218387","venue":"2015 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications (INFOCOM)"}

It provides valuable insight regarding the influence of demographic factors on the knowledge acquisition of coaches in a sub-group of the population (Spanish coaches) for which little is known. Participants were 675 coaches of different team and individual sports. Data were collected through the use of a standardized validated questionnaire. Results indicated that coaches in Spain subscribe to informal knowledge acquisition methods more than formal and non-formal ones. The sources of knowledge most used were an exchange of knowledge with other professionals, observation of other coaches, and previous athletic experience. The sources of knowledge least used were reading books or magazines, and conducting research. Additionally, it was found that coach demographics were associated with differences in the priority given to specific sources of knowledge.
