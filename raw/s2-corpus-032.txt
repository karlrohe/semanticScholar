Many of the alternative targeting pathways described are of primary importance. For example, without retrograde transport, both membrane material and targeting machinery accumulate at distal sites in the endomembrane system, preventing anterograde transport. Further, lysosome/vacuole delivery of degradative substrates by autophagic pathways is central to the role of this organelle as a primary site for intracellular degradation. Finally, targeting through the classical CPY pathway requires the ALP pathway for delivery of the vacuolar t-SNARE Vam3p. Analysis of these alternative targeting pathways provides a more complete understanding of eukaryotic cellular physiology.","inCitations":["bda9a02fd24a160eb030e7f41e5a49e5d95c901e","ccd34aff75d6f71af2ede8db9c677c8ad8219cea","4db9e10ac46bef4694216446e3f9de7bc58e4ee3","4ece288a373f6bc47630c5c6b4a154b5ade6b6dd","53ece0ece8c31152a1b2cd4c5760aae37de32dcc","e5fb970ab8a8b378bcdeb44670cd0e744a8d165b","c179bf85bf4d1902740dc946465f1906d4d0ccf6","5571c50dec47a2e8e2d90db4136697b36d3aca1a"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Alternative protein sorting pathways.","doi":"10.1016/S0074-7696(00)98005-7","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/S0074-7696%2800%2998005-7","venue":"International review of cytology"}

The little output in education does not give much hope for the expected national and individual development. It is this poor achievement in the subject that necessitated this present study which sought to examine the influence of cultural inhibitions and students’ academic achievement in Social Studies in Colleges of Education in Cross River State, Nigeria. To achieve the purpose of this study one hypothesis was formulated to direct the study. Literature review was done according to the variable under study. Ex-post facto research design was adopted for the study. A sample of seven hundred and fifty-three (753) students were randomly selected for the study. The selection was done through simple random sampling technique. The main instruments for data collection were the cultural inhibitions questionnaire (CIQ) and Social Studies Achievement Test (SOSAT) developed by the researchers. The instruments were subjected to face validation by experts in measurement and evaluation. The reliability estimate of the instruments were established through split half reliability method. The reliability co-efficient was corrected with Spearman Brown prophesy formular. Pearson product moment correlation analysis was the statistical technique adopted to test the hypothesis. The hypothesis was tested at .05 level of significance with 751 degree of freedom. The result of the analysis revealed that there is a significant positive relationship between cultural inhibitions and students’ academic achievement in Social Studies. Based on the findings of the study, it was recommended that cultural practices such as male child preference, male inheritance etc should be relaxed in order to give room for our girls to compete favourably in all aspect of life with their male counterpart in order to bring about the desired national development, since education is the bedrock of every viable society.","inCitations":["1cb1fdd1b69d1004ac20ccc17a3bb92817eb7d77"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Cultural Inhibitions and Students’ Academic Achievement in Social Studies in Colleges of Education in Cross River State, Nigeria","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

RMTI stellt eine Erweiterung zum RIP (Routing Information Protocol) dar, die das Konvergenzverhalten bei Netzwerkveranderungen, insb. bei Routingschleifen, verbessern soll. Dies geschieht durch Erkennen von Routingschleifen und Reduzieren des Count-to-infinity Problems. Um dieses gewunschte Verhalten nachweisen zu konnen, bedarf eine reichhaltige Evaluierung des RMTI- Algorithmus. Hierzu wurde in der gleichen Arbeitsgruppe die Client-/Server-Applikation XTPeer entwickelt. In Kombination mit anderen Software wie VNUML und Quagga Routing Suite lasst sich per XT-Peer der Algorithmus evaluieren. Die Applikation XTPeer generiert durch die Simulationen Daten. Diese konnen in Form von XML konforme SDF-Dateien exportiert werden. Diese konnen ohne weitere Auswertungen wieder in die XTPeer Applikation importiert werden. Die Evaluierung der Simulationen findet automatisiert nur an der aktuellen Simulation statt. Evaluierung uber mehrere Simulationen muss der Benutzer manuell berechnen. Um diese Evaluierungsarbeiten fur den Benutzer zu vereinfachen, verfolgt die vorliegende Diplomarbeit daher das Ziel, die XTPeer Applikation mit einem Auswertungsmodul zu erweitern. Die Auswertungen soll sich uber alle gespeicherten Simulationsdaten und nicht wie bisher nur uber die aktuell laufende Simulation erstrecken. Dies ermoglicht bessere statistisch verwertbare Aussagen.

Recently drained thermokarst lake provide an opportunity to study under-lake permafrost state with ground geophysical methods. This lake located on Kurungnakh island (composed of Yedoma ice complex deposits) in the Lena delta was studied with electrical resistivity tomography. Local low-resistivity anomaly in the central part of the lake was found during previous geophysical research. Main goal of this work is detection of residual thermal effect from a frozen under-lake talik in an electric field. Satellite images of different years show that the drainage has taken place about 30 years ago. The area of the lake was covered in 2016 by high-resolution aerial imagery (5 cm/pixel), then digital elevation model was built using photogrammetry. These data were used for geomorphological description of the alas (depression in permafrost after lake drainage). The alas depth reaches 8 m, its size is about 300 × 500 m. It was formed probably on the last stage of Holocene thermokarst activity and it is relatively shallow in comparison to other typical alases on the island. A number of baijarachs (as a result of polygonal ice wedges thawing) were observed on the alas bottom. A line of the steepest slope marks a coast line of the lake, which allows to estimate a volume of water, which was contained in it earlier. Electrical resistivity tomography was implemented on 8 parallel profiles of 235 m. Measurements were conducted with dipole-dipole array. Basing on 3-dimensional inversion results a 3-dimensional resistivity model of under-lake deposits up to 40 m deep was made. Relatively low resistivity area (16–25 kOhm·m in comparison to 50–100 kOhm·m) was registered at the depth of 15–35 m. It is probably linked to a temperature anomaly (–3...–5 °С in comparison with –8.5 °С average value of the region). Therefore the under lake talik was fully frozen but the rest of temperature anomaly is still observable. 3-dimensional finite-element modeling of talik propagation (500 years) and refreezing (30 years) was done in axisymmetric setting taking phase transition into account. Temperature anomaly up to 0 °С in its center at the depth of 35 m was obtained as a result of the modeling. It qualitatively confirms the interpretation of electrical resistivity tomography data on the residual temperature anomaly below the basin of the drained lake.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Электротомография Чаши Дренированного Термокарстового Озера На О.

Here, the question of which of the commonly preferred models-Langmuir and Freundlich-is better, is addressed using weighted least-squares, with weights obtained by variance function analysis of replicate data. Proper weighting in this case requires attention to a special problem-that the dependent variable S is not measured, rather is calculated from the measured equilibrium concentration C. The latter is commonly taken as the independent variable but is subject to experimental error, violating a fundamental least-squares assumption. This problem is handled through an effective variance treatment. When the data are fitted to the Langmuir, Freundlich, and Temkin isotherms, only the Freundlich model yields a statistically adequate chi(2) value, and then only when S is taken to include labile residual P (S(0)) estimated from isotope-exchange experiments. The Freundlich model also yields good estimates of S(0) when this is treated as an adjustable parameter rather than a known quantity-of relevance to studies in which S(0) is not measured. By contrast, neglect of weights and labile P can lead to a mistaken preference for the Langmuir model.","inCitations":["fb94e91f3335861cc403e0861b0e7d4307607b2c","5181f23cd8a3669e7073a23616ce6b81fb5bb054"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Least-squares analysis of phosphorus soil sorption data with weighting from variance function estimation: a statistical case for the Freundlich isotherm.","doi":"10.1021/es100535b","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1021/es100535b","venue":"Environmental science & technology"}

The open-loop suboptimal controller is designed to resemble the feedback integral controller with reference to its dynamical behaviour. Energetic efficiency is measured using the power loss coefficient. The Van der Pol model for the evolution of lift force on the cylinder is chosen as the reduced-order model for the development of an open-loop suboptimal controller. The parameter estimation of the low- dimensional model is carried out using the results from the continuum based Navier - Stokes simulations. It is shown that a subspace identification method can be used to model the relationship between the inputs to the reduced-order model and the inputs to the higher-order computational fluid dynamic model. The development of the suboptimal control is realised by means of solving suitably formulated optimal tracking and regulator problems using the Pontryagin’s minimum principle. The resultant controller is found to be energetically efficient and also successful in the control of vortex shedding.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Suboptimal control of circular cylinder wakes using Van der Pol oscillator","doi":"10.1016/j.compfluid.2018.10.011","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compfluid.2018.10.011","venue":""}

ALEKS is an online version of math curriculum ranging from elementary to higher level calculus classes and is readily available to schools and colleges throughout the world. In this study, I used the curriculum for Foundations Level Math students in year one in college. The stu- dent's overall satisfaction was measured using questionnaires. After a brief investigation of stu- dent autonomy within the Arabic culture, a discussion will follow regarding learner awareness and self-evaluation and the overall success of this tool for this particular population of students. The dilemma over whether this is merely another tool for the traditional classroom or if understanding is truly enhanced using this pedagogical approach, thus creating more autonomous learners, will ultimately be answered.

Conclusion. 1 Rationale for the Study The emergence of technology and its significant capital costs in class- rooms have had a great impact on traditional pedagogical methods. These important changes have created a need to determine whether or not a program like ALEKS (http://www.aleks.com/) can provide a useful alterna- tive to teaching content in L2. The interactive tool ALEKS was selected as a potential effective alternative method of teaching content in L2 with native Arabic speaking students. The interactive component of ALEKS provides students with immediate feedback and offers suggestions as to what further steps to take, all uniquely designed for each individual stu- dent. Students can access this online program any time they have Internet access. In recent literature, Briggs and Keyek-Franssen (2009) suggested that students benefit as they progress through a program when ongoing formative assessments focused on the individual needs of the students.

However, this surgical technique increases the risk of bile duct injury and lost gallstones. Since over 90% of split gallstones never become symptomatic, they often present as incidental findings on CT-scans. Careful removal of as many stones as possible, intense irrigation and suction are recommended. It has been reported that 8.5% of lost gallstones will lead to a complication, most common are abscesses.\n\n\nPRESENTATION CASE\nWe report a case of spilled gallstones simulating peritoneal metastases on radiological investigations. Diagnosis was very difficult, not even an US-guided biopsy of the lesion was decisive. Only a diagnostic laparoscopy confirms the diagnosis.\n\n\nDISCUSSION\nThe reaction associated with lost gallstones can mimic other causes, such as soft tissue sarcoma, malignant lymphoma or, as in our case peritoneal carcinomatosis.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nSpilled gallstones are associated with uncommon, but significant complications, and even the diagnosis of such a condition can cause serious difficulties. Serious effort must be made to prevent gallbladder perforation, and accidental stone spillage should be promptly recognized and properly managed.","inCitations":["512a14a892a8e00f942a6f9be1a49c186340d702"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Spilled gallstones simulating peritoneal carcinomatosis: A case report and literature review","doi":"10.1016/j.ijscr.2018.04.016","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijscr.2018.04.016","venue":"International journal of surgery case reports"}

After extraction of the samples with light petroleum (boiling range 40–60°)-amyl alcohol (100:2), using methohexital as the internal standard, direct analysis is carried out. The high sensitivity and selectivity of the nitrogen detector permit the determination of hexobarbital in plasma at levels down to 50 ng/ml. The sensitivity and selectivity are compared with those obtained in normal flame ionization detection. A procedure is given for the purification of plasma samples of hepatitis patients with a high bilirubin content. Some pharmacokinetic applications of the method are reported.","inCitations":["9813c8646dbd605a6c02ddeb1ed085079eb63a14","3f994a4388f887d26768a6ccb9ce3a8e8228137c","9eac02d9071a16520543e7c37bfb0f69ce59da92","5d26f1fab45719d0be60f5d8a47526ee10686b83","a669427000435bbec243960181e472c4658e183a","185226038688ab99d1fa0392df50820aefca0a91","a683e9dfcd1b0c1d9b4c5adb1a9eeaff6f4eef61","048b965a81e17fb9a51a20fa28b8e62083973173"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Rapid and sensitive gas chromatographic determination of hexobarbital in plasma of man using a nitrogen detector.","doi":"10.1016/S0021-9673(00)83147-7","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/S0021-9673%2800%2983147-7","venue":"Journal of chromatography"}

Le procede est utile pour la detection simultanee d'acides nucleiques specifiques multiples dans un echantillon, avec une grande specificite et une grande sensibilite. Il comprend egalement un taux fondamentalement faible de signal de fond. Une forme preferee du procede consiste en une operation d'association, une operation d'amplification et une operation de detection. L'operation d'association implique l'association d'une ou plusieurs molecules de sondage specialement prevues a cet effet, integralement ou partiellement de l'acide nucleique, a des molecules cibles a analyser. Cette operation permet d'associer les molecules de sondage a des molecules presentes dans un echantillon. L'operation d'amplification consiste en une replication selon le modele du cercle roulant de molecules d'acide nucleique circulaires, appelees cercles cibles d'amplification, qui sont soit une partie des molecules de sondage ou hybridees a celles-ci. Un seul cycle d'amplification utilisant la replication selon le modele du cercle roulant permet d'assurer une amplification importante des cercles cibles d'amplification. Apres la replication selon le modele du cercle roulant, les sequences amplifiees sont detectees au moyen de sondes de codage multicolore et combinatoire qui permettent la detection separee, simultanee et quantitative de multiples cercles cibles amplifies differents representant des multiples molecules cibles differentes. Le produit amplifie est directement proportionnel a l'importance de la sequence cible presente dans un echantillon et les mesures quantitatives representent donc de maniere fiable l'importance de la sequence cible dans un echantillon. Les principaux avantages de ce procede sont le fait qu'un grand nombre de molecules distinctes peuvent etre detectees simultanement et que les differences d'importance entre les diverses molecules cibles peuvent etre quantifiees avec precision. L'autre avantage reside dans le fait que la phase de replication de l'ADN est isothermique, et que les signaux sont strictement quantitatifs car la reaction d'amplification est lineaire et est catalysee par une enzyme de defilement tres efficace.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Amplication et detection de segments unimoleculaires","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

The effect of this system on radiologists' performance depends strongly on its standalone performance. The purpose of this study was to compare the standalone performance of this CAD system to that of radiologists.MethodsIn a retrospective study, nine certified screening radiologists and three residents read 200 digital screening mammograms without the use of CAD. Performances of the individual readers and of CAD were computed as the true-positive fraction (TPF) at a false-positive fraction of 0.05 and 0.2. Differences were analysed using an independent one-sample t-test.ResultsAt a false-positive fraction of 0.05, the performance of CAD (TPF = 0.487) was similar to that of the certified screening radiologists (TPF = 0.518, P = 0.17). At a false-positive fraction of 0.2, CAD performance (TPF = 0.620) was significantly lower than the radiologist performance (TPF = 0.736, P <0.001). Compared to the residents, CAD performance was similar for all false-positive fractions.ConclusionsThe sensitivity of CAD at a high specificity was comparable to that of human readers. These results show potential for CAD to be used as an independent reader in breast cancer screening.Key points• Computer-aided detection (CAD) systems are used to detect malignant masses in mammograms\n • Current CAD systems operate at low specificity to avoid perceptual oversight\n • A CAD system has been developed that operates at high specificity\n • The performance of the CAD system is approaching that of trained radiologists\n • CAD has the potential to be an independent reader in screening","inCitations":["5eef2395cd54157b28dc2c67a9aedcb97a35f3cc","3978804d0824c3bf1e17a1d0cd2e9734060fa058","59261f541631c9332ad1d1cd43808862381a7afd","3596cb92090de71cf44f483334c351785b290eed","5387d985ecd16c3d20f4cfd7a3e063d086d399a1","6bf44fe06c49068f1e738195c44d91b308e2780e","2a863a1ab6df3ca9a55573befcb89e1ed7b7df74","390442e989dcebdb3f4cd6b615d4b20a9b1c36b8","35710791c54b7ca380ddafa6ca757c98b1ca8071"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Standalone computer-aided detection compared to radiologists’ performance for the detection of mammographic masses","doi":"10.1007/s00330-012-2562-7","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00330-012-2562-7","venue":"European Radiology"}

Their implantations as thoraco-abdominal by-passes in dogs were scheduled to remain in place for periods ranging from four hours to six months. The haematologic parameters of the hosts were evaluated before implanting the prostheses and before harvesting the graft. To quantify the thrombogenicity of the flow surface, the platelet deposition and fibrinogen uptake were measured by means of an isotopic technique involving Indium-III labelled platelets and iodine-125 labelled fibrinogen. Synthesis of prostacyclin (PGI2) and thromboxane (TXA2) by the internal capsulae was determined by radioimmunoassay. The pathology was assessed according to previously described protocols. The haematologic parameters of the hosts did not alter substantially in the presence of the prostheses. The observed changes, though slight, were not pathologically significant 48 hours after implantation. Platelet and fibrin deposition was highest on the luminal surface of the prostheses 24 hours post-implantation. These decreased and became negligible after one month when the flow surface became smooth and glistening. The PGI2/TXA2 ratio of the luminal surface was much lower than that observed in native aortic tissue. These results show that the large calibre Dacron vascular prosthesis has a flow surface with a low degree of blood compatibility. The concentration of PGI2 on the newly-formed luminal surface remained low. This characteristic and the incomplete endothelialization of the luminal surface might be among the main factors that determine the high failure rate of synthetic prostheses when used as small diameter blood conduits.","inCitations":["739206d348b2a706e66e1719c1cc9f099b4eae96","1d21450ca2ee91b5ca587c6240d91dfa53d1c422","cc1a0d20267228a5a12cddc610178695de69396c","da0e949d65d788971c57192b071bc7821ee17877","fe30bf3bcf56cf7606ca1b32f0d2ecb789e4d18b","44b0308d2a462602ccb908b04a7a420108c1ff3e","0f83b08ce92b8b4ffb2c8875832b868994717b71"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Fate of polyester arterial prostheses implanted as thoraco-abdominal by-passes in dogs: haematology, pathology, and biochemistry.","doi":"","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"Clinical and investigative medicine.

But actually, this surveillance turns to be delicate and difficult to master particularly for milling. That’s the reason why we have developped in the Automatic Laboratory of Besancon (L.A.B) a supervision monitor of cutting tools for the attendance of the wear and the detection of the breaking. In this publication, we present the results of the experimentation of this monitor and we exploit these results to appreciate permanetly the state of the tool. We have defined to strategy of experimentation which has allowed to undertake many approaches in parallel. In fact we have manufactured some slots, detected the current signal and attended its evolution by the monitor to justify the choice of the programmed points (points of wear, points of breaking,..) we have made dimensional measures on the tool and on the part, and also measures on the state of the surfaces. The set of the measures has concerned the width of the slot, on the mean flank wear of the tool and on the ruggedness of the surface. The aim is to compare the results of the monitor and the results of the direct measures to find, in an explicit way, a correlation between the detected current signal during manufacturing and the real wear of the tool.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Experimental Determination of the Performances of the Monitor of Attendance of Milling Tools Wear","doi":"10.1016/S1474-6670(17)52408-8","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/S1474-6670%2817%2952408-8","venue":""}

Because of the special needs of aging users, due to frailty and reduced reflexes in many cases, it is important to give careful consideration to rather fundamental design properties. Inter alia it is very important to define, clarify and design running, turning and stability properties of the highest standards in manual wheelchairs. In particular we discuss these matters in regard to wheelchair behavior on sloping surfaces. In the present paper we report on an analytical model for a 4 wheel manual wheelchair which shows good correlation with the existing experimental data relating to torque and speed when the wheelchair is moving on a level plane and when climbing a 3 degree slope. The rolling stability of the wheelchair on a slope is also discussed.","inCitations":["285471088044238f8cc7c54a4763f80b883dba76","2ef1782d65847a40eb35d96c817270ca3033664a","5245f25c3611db60ea03dc386a4da77be18dc9ca"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a411435.pdf","http://www.dtic.mil/get-tr-doc/pdf?AD=ADA411435"],"title":"Turning characteristics and stability of manual wheelchairs on a slope","doi":"10.1109/IEMBS.2001.1020465","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEMBS.2001.1020465","venue":"2001 Conference Proceedings of the 23rd Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society"}

The goals have been to increase corn prices and farmer income, enhance rural employment through encouragement of value-added businesses, increase energy security, and produce additives and/or fuels capable of reducing tailpipe pollutants and greenhouse gases. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 established annual goals via a renewable fuels standard that would have increased production of ethanol and biodiesel to 7.5 billion gallons by 2012. That bill was superseded by the Energy Independence and Security of Act of 2007, which increased usage targets and specified performance standards for ethanol and other biofuels. The 2008 Farm Bill identified incentive payments for ethanol produced in various ways. The effects of these three laws have been magnified by rising crude oil prices, which helped maintain profits for corn dry-grind ethanol plants. This paper discusses environmental effects of corn ethanol production and use, energy balances of corn ethanol versus gasoline, subsidies for corn ethanol and gasoline, impacts of ethanol production on farmer decisionmaking, and effects of corn ethanol on food prices.","inCitations":["18fd7d3cfe8714d8e2ca1ae30516c471a7c11b79","16c7388d09bcc2be63340fb24370845c37bda4ab","2f5a0e13f73cb3383f7dbfc4f1c9a118d1bb4c9d","c6a16c376e2e7abbee84bb33dd5f987e82180d3f","330f22f8761c214014bf34b6cf8caf317d1e0019","fc29096940b5bb8984551658e54f9fbb352a3e60","509f6a0cbb02fc7f6501974a9c446df8f065e0e4"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.docum-enter.com/get/Y9pT_49WJM4JOEwGD3cjkpGz5Azw1euE_D4X_6VEgvw,/Economic-and-Environmental-Impacts-of-U-S-Corn-Ethanol.pdf","http://www.docum-enter.com/get/dDG9aRqWNvPw_5qJk-0SjY_Lkr1D7Bd3iXhQp2GYjcw,/Economic-and-Environmental-Impacts-of-U-S-Corn.pdf","http://www.docum-enter.com/get/meEkXjsP_T6e12UMoAJ5MkZyenGIv13g1rC3oKn6gkQ,/Economic-and-Environmental-Impacts-of-U-S-Corn.pdf","http://www.extension.umn.edu/agriculture/business/renewable-energy-bio-fuel/docs/umn-ext-economic-and-environmental-impacts-of-us-corn-ethanol-production-and-use.pdf"],"title":"Economic and environmental impacts of U.S. corn ethanol production and use","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Results: 7,8-DHF and BDNF display differential receptor binding affinity, receptor activation kinetics, receptor phosphorylation pattern, and ligand-induced receptor degradation. Conclusion: 7,8-DHF and BDNF utilize different mechanisms to activate TrkB. Significance: This report provides mechanistic insights into how 7,8-DHF induces TrkB activation. 7,8-dihydroxyflavone (7,8-DHF), a newly identified small molecular TrkB receptor agonist, rapidly activates TrkB in both primary neurons and the rodent brain and mimics the physiological functions of the cognate ligand BDNF. Accumulating evidence supports that 7,8-DHF exerts neurotrophic effects in a TrkB-dependent manner. Nonetheless, the differences between 7,8-DHF and BDNF in activating TrkB remain incompletely understood. Here we show that 7,8-DHF and BDNF exhibit different TrkB activation kinetics in which TrkB maturation may be implicated. Employing two independent biophysical approaches, we confirm that 7,8-DHF interacts robustly with the TrkB extracellular domain, with a Kd of ∼10 nm. Although BDNF transiently activates TrkB, leading to receptor internalization and ubiquitination/degradation, in contrast, 7,8-DHF-triggered TrkB phosphorylation lasts for hours, and the internalized receptors are not degraded. Notably, primary neuronal maturation may be required for 7,8-DHF but not for BDNF to elicit the full spectrum of TrkB signaling cascades. Hence, 7,8-DHF interacts robustly with the TrkB receptor, and its agonistic effect may be mediated by neuronal development and maturation.","inCitations":["ad646b3adaae8e400f948d916bd84f67f22b6be6","f15ca65a5374e0914756e87553676771e94b0ca2","b3182704895345ad1836baa0720a8d33ca743948","290620d65d175fa4cc66b655fd7bb5dec2c5ea36","c01f155cf5baaa1dca7596b7c8971af0d81fa445","0da11e35adfa55249a2a48e1ceb51c05aa245c59","048bd502342b829db19d9ecf61d916de53f0ba43","3e0c5436baaf7b90e96e92418b1714865c3414b6","712c30bf407967b380d09edd9519fdc35072b8a8","e8e364cbd19728171fdb61d338456ba04d604be0","63691dd35c9dc1769312442d84325abe808a2d2b","03f732081d7bbd93ac60cea26d3d990d8dfad840","25b26f1fd038c4c937fc17f531fbab34ee84d8ed","8e4d047c6ee0a324d37222962bfefcddd3d3b8d5","8a8146e9e15c02b8708da3bc45f9fcb97512a82b","d8f9246a59a40c59ddf5457fec430f177317fbf8","80453b5126a8273b4a5084f5682d7a7049ba54cd","74a922ad0c51a90a540c5b3ebb3c6d805c9ddd4e","4f1c77e9688653993371b95ce96dae2d74cc1edb","5b1569f8c4891a4b687779cdf5fe94f030497be4","3794b23b501543e412f2ab2f87abea1ac82dc06b","5f640cbaf829d545cfdd3cb2d78382d4ce157780","af85ee937908500ad6d5b2c91ea21f081a3d15e8","dac72f2c8f680da45f1efc0fe2b00e827258a237","fc61d18de12dc3babff117cd4ce9062590240f4e","55e405ec2ce5c7e1b43be919211ea499dd02cb96","611d999341c27a7a77dd7d268628009809d0f14e","50d2e6148af20284b985dcdd472b23e133410c38"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Biochemical and Biophysical Investigation of the Brain-derived Neurotrophic Factor Mimetic 7,8-Dihydroxyflavone in the Binding and Activation of the TrkB Receptor*","doi":"10.1074/jbc.M114.562561","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M114.562561","venue":"The Journal of Biological Chemistry"}

To this end, we enrolled 200 HIV-positive and 182 HIV-negative women in this cross-sectional cohort study. The following sampling methods were used: (i) structured interview, (ii) CD4 cell counts, and (iii) cervical specimens. HPV genotype (total 23 types) was analyzed using polymerase chain reaction assay. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify independent causative factors for HPV infection. The prevalence of HPV infection was 3-fold higher in the HIV-positive women than in the HIV-negative women. The overall prevalences of HPV infection, high risk (HR)-HPV infection, and multiple HPV infections in the HIV-positive women were 36.5%, 33.5%, and 13.0%, respectively, and the corresponding values in HIV-negative women were 12.1%, 10.4%, and 6.0%, respectively (P < 0.05). The types of HR-HPVs were similar in the HIV-positive and HIV-negative women (HPV-16, -52, -58, and -18), and the prevalences of infections by these viruses were 1.5- to 3-fold higher in the HIV-positive group than in the HIV-negative group. HR-HPV infection among the HIV-positive women was associated with three factors: low CD4 count (OR for 200 ≤ CD4 ≤ 350 and CD4 < 200/µL were 2.11 and 3.13, respectively), HIV infection through sexual contact (OR, 7.90; 95% CI, 2.38-14.60), and having HIV-positive sexual partners (OR, 2.02; 95% CI, 1.03-3.95). We found that the prevalence of HPV infection among the HIV-positive Chinese women was higher than that among the HIV-negative women; moreover, among the HIV-positive women, factors associated with HIV infection were risk factors for HR-HPV infection.","inCitations":["45821a1e96cb8b2ecea963af6910d41f2285fe9a","a6d6ae639297672c8a44c6c89128c1055919df1f","d2af663763373fbff17979b49da405adac4e6c9a","05333a4c5a13e28fbfbe1f3e182a4a26b3130867","9e3f6eb3ab840abf2f8545f214cb7398abf10f84","b8330986c7870907c8763c32c3a3147c2f43f80d"],"pdfUrls":["https://www.niid.go.jp/niid/JJID/64/411.pdf"],"title":"Epidemiologic risk profile of human papillomavirus infections in human immunodeficiency virus-positive Chinese women.","doi":"","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"Japanese journal of infectious diseases"}

Dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) was used to study interfacial fibre/matrix interaction and the fragmentation test method was applied to determine interfacial shear strength. For the composite samples with treated carbon fibres, analyzed by DMA, a consistent shift of the loss modulus peak toward higher temperature was observed. The damping ratio was highly affected by residual stresses along the carbon fibre direction due to the large difference of thermal expansion coefficients of matrix and fibres. Critical fibre length and interfacial shear strength, obtained from the fragmentation test, showed substantial improvement for treated fibres as compared to the untreated ones. Plasma oxidation of the fibre surface improved considerably the fibre-matrix interaction. Care must be taken interpreting the DMA results, due to specific characteristics of the system studied.","inCitations":["8820ee5b2fd99624a8bb05bf7ebef4ed81921cf7","c84bbd13e80d9b8fe8caf3461cc2fe6117833fe4"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Interfacial studies of carbon fibre / polycarbonate composites using dynamic mechanical analysis","doi":"10.1515/epoly.2005.5.1.145","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1515/epoly.2005.5.1.145","venue":""}

Recognition of the importance of persistent jaundice beyond 2 weeks of age in the infant or elevation of the conjugated bilirubin more than 2 mg/dl will allow the timely evaluation of neonates with possible biliary atresia prior to the development of irreversible hepatic damage. Episodes of intermittent jaundice or persistent conjugated hyperbilirubinemia should be investigated at any age to exclude obstructive lesions of the extrahepatic biliary tract. In all cases, a rapid but carefully coordinated evaluation can be undertaken by a pediatric gastroenterology and surgical team, allowing optimum economy of effort and preservation of hepatic function. In nearly all cases with obstructive lesions of the extrahepatic biliary tree, satisfactory hepatic function can be preserved through appropriate surgical intervention. Results with biliary atresia continue to improve but are dependent on early diagnosis and treatment. In cases in which hepatic function deteriorates and hepatic failure becomes inevitable, orthotopic hepatic transplantation can be lifesaving and should be undertaken prior to the onset of irreversible hepatic decompensation. Although the terminology may be somewhat confusing and its etiology uncertain, the entity of choledochal cysts, taken within the context of its modern classification, accurately describes a group of cystic anomalies of the extrahepatic (and intrahepatic) biliary tree, which have many common features. The vast majority can be expeditiously dealt with by surgical excision and hepaticoenteral reconstruction. Two particular associations with choledochal cysts are important to note. When it occurs with infancy, choledochal cysts can be difficult to diagnose, but very important to define and treat expeditiously in order to prevent serious impairment of hepatic function. In all patients, but particularly in adults, the risk of associated carcinoma necessitates extremely careful definition of the biliary tree and urges one to advocate complete excision of the cyst at initial operation.","inCitations":["3650dd07338f5014d158ffae6e5e4f1d037526b6","d1532805b62ad3a77b20a3208619f614ff7341d0"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Neonatal cholestatic conditions requiring surgical reconstruction.","doi":"10.1055/s-2008-1040572","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1055/s-2008-1040572","venue":"Seminars in liver disease"}
