Solutions were obtained for Prandtl and Schmidt number differing from or equal to unity. For the case of Pr and Sc = 1, velocity, temperature, and concentration profiles were calculated for carbon monoxide combustion at 9 cm and 49 cm from the outlet. The calculations showed that a deviation of Pr and Sc from unity does not substantially affect the location of the flame front.

There are at least 4 \nfactors identified in the previous study contribute to productivity: Skill of workers; \nDesign of equipment, design of workstation and design of assembly process. Workstation \ndesign including working position: standing or sitting, the use of tools such as jig and the \nheight of working table are influencing worker's productivity. Meanwhile, working \nposture: position of body: arm and wrist, neck, trunk and leg determine comfortability \nand safe posture while working. These aspects also play a significant role in productivity. \nThis research is an attempt to investigate the effect workstation design on \nproductivity, in this case the assembly time. Three factors are scrutinized: Table Height \n91cm and 103cm, worker position: standing or sitting, and use of tool, with Jig and \nwithout Jig to conduct the assembly of electric appliances (a plug). The out put measured \nis the response time (time to assemble the product). Design of experiment of 23 i.e. two \nlevel of each factors: Position, Table Height and Tools, is employed to see which factors \ncontribute significantly the response time. The research also investigates working posture \nof different positions and observe whether the working posture is acceptable according to \nthe RULA standard .. \nTwo subjects were employed to conduct the experiments. 36 experiments for each \nlevel of factors, or 288 experiments for 8 different sets of workstation design. \nThe results shows that the design of Jig as a tool to help subjects performing the \njob is contribute significantly to the response time in this case the assembly time, table \nheight 91cm and 103cm has the second effect on the response time and position sitting \nor standing does not influence much to the assembly time. Combination of two factors \ni.e. the use of jig and the height of table has significant contribution to the response time. \nThe working posture for this assembly line time job has been assessed, it shows \nthat most of the working postures are acceptable according to RULA standard. The use of \nJig does not contribute to the unsafe working posture. The table height and the position of \nsubject: standing or sitting also do not contribute to the unsafe working posture. There are \nsome working postures need to be improved. These positions related to wrist movement \nand trunk. The wrist movement is due to the process of assemble need to hold and flip the \nproduct, while the trunk position only due to the height of subjects in relation to the table \nheight.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Analysis Of Workstation Design In Assembly Line For Small Scale Electric Industry","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

In agreement with earlier work, endothelin enhanced both adult rat myocyte contractile performance and cardiac troponin-I phosphorylation. Protein kinase C participated in both responses. The role of cardiac troponin-I phosphorylation in the contractile function response to protein kinase C was further investigated using gene transfer into myocytes of troponin-I isoforms/mutants lacking one or more phosphorylation sites previously identified in purified cardiac troponin-I. Sarcomeric replacement with slow skeletal troponin-I-abrogated protein kinase C-mediated troponin-I phosphorylation. In functional studies, endothelin slowed relaxation in myocytes expressing slow skeletal troponin-I, while the relaxation rate increased in myocytes expressing cardiac troponin-I. Based on these results, acceleration of myocyte relaxation during protein kinase C activation largely depended on cardiac troponin-I phosphorylation. Experiments with troponin-I isoform chimeras provided evidence that phosphorylation sites in the amino portion of cardiac troponin I-mediated the protein kinase C acceleration of relaxation. The cardiac troponin-I Thr-144 phosphorylation site identified in earlier biochemical studies was not significantly phosphorylated during the acute contractile response. Thus, amino-terminal protein kinase C-dependent phosphorylation sites in cardiac troponin-I are likely responsible for the accelerated relaxation observed in adult myocytes.","inCitations":["dab4d60a8fff8d6bff5cb0ac13ad178b53cca764","2e9ce3b1681e4b5830569db6bc8687d61ac81a8a","1c9d9334f81bab667d503913fe4ac5dff59ebe38","093849c90a680a9326bd820aa63ea659efe037fa","e8ddc3261b164431c3819832dcda9ff57fb590e4","79ba405dfe10069ac56597fc9c354f76ade104a3","cc2ca1cf7f12408f83eabbb3ca2e74a615b4ee55","c3c106b774b60a34867c447d96e5142dc07d9ee3","97d927d29d9b0969195c390f1b494ffa8f8eb699","779f032457e651908a4d4f60351d77e57fc569b3","83e693d587f613272fff33c979c730eaafec49b6","72700bea98a00929cf7e55ea440d10450d5c5b1a","60a267b0b079148911ad0022ab9953d4a56ef7fa","b7c3de1314722e6f8e6210ef60072ff3329fe022","c008809219ce771184649beb7b569d7db070a2fc","cd34f9c07c628a27dccbe8892470a04a97f261d6","59ab1a7c1c878771de66f80e07f3c1c632a6d725","8e9dc4150cf7852b430869224ba4a8d5798f82e1"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.jbc.org/content/278/36/33694.full.pdf"],"title":"Role of troponin I phosphorylation in protein kinase C-mediated enhanced contractile performance of rat myocytes.","doi":"10.1074/jbc.M305404200","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M305404200","venue":"The Journal of biological chemistry"}

A condition where no definite concept could be inferred (No basic-level meaning: NM) served as a baseline. The semantic representation of the novel word was assessed via a semantic-relatedness judgment task. In this task, the learned novel word served as a prime, while the corresponding concept, an unlearned feature of the concept, and an unrelated word served as targets. ERP responses to the targets, primed by the novel words in the three learning conditions, were compared. For the corresponding concept, smaller N400s were elicited in the DM and IF conditions than in the NM condition, indicating that the concept could be obtained in both learning conditions. However, for the unlearned feature, the targets in the IF condition produced an N400 effect while in the DM condition elicited an LPC effect relative to the NM learning condition. No ERP difference was observed among the three learning conditions for the unrelated words. The results indicate that conditions of learning affect the semantic representation of novel word, and that the unlearned feature was only activated by the novel word in the IF learning condition.","inCitations":["1e5e4df895eabc92513159c47ffc112984c4c723","9e06dbca2b6e20b550b3304f26fb36f1c6a43dd4","656ace35a188e1127eef5a04327f5ae2eaaf3113","d596190546a0cd57146ff34a43182c83934050c4","47fd4146821664f2c511ca1dd41bd9e562b49a84","c534e9a618338e2e084ce92af61ce21054089742","254a1460a1af8d57952195f5fe3505dc08671e82","3e207b217707a1428523094f872f3108e8d1bc0e","f12eeeb883df295acce8d759ed55c7db8a5b4e83"],"pdfUrls":["http://or.nsfc.gov.cn/bitstream/00001903-5/243313/1/1000008964111.pdf","https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S002839321400030X","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002839321400030X?dgcid=api_sd_search-api-endpoint"],"title":"Acquiring concepts and features of novel words by two types of learning: direct mapping and inference","doi":"10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2014.01.012","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2014.01.012","venue":"Neuropsychologia"}

This issue can adversely affect the energy consumption and public health especially in highly populated cities. The aim of this research study is to characterize the effect and the response of each surface type in the cities to increase our understanding of climate, anthropogenic heat, and urban heat islands. Flux tower observations as well as satellite-based remote sensing measurements are two source of valuable information. Flux towers are rarely deployed in the cities or built up environment and mostly take measurements in natural surfaces. Here we deploy several flux towers on different surface in New York City to enhance our understanding about the reaction of each surface to the energy balance. Complete energy balance stations are installed over distinct materials such as concrete, asphalt, and rooftops. This study can help to provide a novel approach to use ground observations and map the maxima and minima air temperature in New York City using satellite measurements. Satellites also provide many measurements from the earth surface at various spatial resolutions. MODIS data sets particularly deliver skin temperature. Moreover, satellite observations from Landsat 8 are utilized to classify the city surfaces to distinct defined surfaces where ground observations were obtained. The mapped temperatures will be linked to MODIS surface temperatures to develop a model that can downscale MODIS skin temperatures to fine resolution air temperature over urban regions. The evaluation of results against independent ground observations reveals that the proposed method is promising for studying surface energy balance in urban regions.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.2017.8128445"],"title":"Urban surface energy budget study using flux tower observations and remote sensing measurements","doi":"10.1109/IGARSS.2017.8128445","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.2017.8128445","venue":"2017 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)"}

Devido aos limitados estudos com resistencia de plantas de algodao, este trabalho objetivou-se determinar a densidade larval e a preferencia por estruturas do algodoeiro a ser oferecidas para H. armigera em testes de nao preferencia para alimentacao. Avaliou-se atratividade larval e injurias de lagartas neonatas e de terceiro instar em diferentes estruturas vegetativas do algodoeiro (folha, bractea, botao floral e maca) para testes com e sem chance de escolha. Ao determinar a densidade larval foram utilizados dois, quatro e seis insetos para lagartas neonatas e um, dois e tres insetos para lagartas de terceiro instar. Os dois testes foram conduzidos em DIC com 10 repeticoes em esquema fatorial 4x3 (quatro estruturas e tres densidades de lagartas). Para lagartas neonatas nos testes com e sem chance de escolha a atratividade foi significativamente maior na densidade de seis lagartas por estrutura, e a folha a estrutura que mais atraiu as lagartas e tambem que apresentou maior porcentagem e nota de injuria nas tres densidades avaliadas.

The results demonstrated that the existence of a prior impression mitigates the influence of context performances on ratings. Judgment standards were found to be unstable and dependent on information provided to raters by the experimental manipulations. Regression analyses showed that both attention and standards of judgment mediate the relationship between context and ratings. Implications of these findings for contrast effects, performance ratings, and the importance of reliable judgment standards for real-world performance appraisals are discussed.","inCitations":["e669fb5dcea50dc513d70e4cd1f0dcce32a51e0d","0d4851f8d20e840b5c25dd2d01c861eb9aaf1606"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Context and Prior Impression Effects on Attention, Judgment Standards, and Ratings: Contrast Effects Revisited","doi":"10.1111/j.1559-1816.2002.tb02757.x","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1559-1816.2002.tb02757.x","venue":""}

The stator flux linkage and rotor speed are observed by EKF.

Several legacy persistent organic pollutants such as PCBs and DDE were also investigated. The level of urbanization of the landscape appeared to influence the level of PBDE exposure. PBDE congener distribution patterns varied between piscivorous and terrestrial-feeding birds. This suggests individual congeners may be subject to differences in bioaccumulation, biomagnification or metabolism in the aquatic and terrestrial food webs. Biomagnification of PBDEs was studied in the Bay aquatic food chains for the first time. A biomagnification factor of 25.1 was estimated for SigmaPBDEs for the fish - osprey egg food chain. Hazard quotients, applied as a preliminary evaluation, indicated that PBDEs may pose a moderate hazard to ospreys and peregrine falcons through impairment of reproductive performance.","inCitations":["24ac37550b226c2100332271dedac0807aa8fe1c","9e8af15b785548f53565aa996f34bd1228e5f3f4","c5ec9199c9237b26a690eaca96c524bcb9794448","924c9b9e190a84a78fa5dc49b500e817e020cabd","fd440ac4ddb542c74c551535b2dbfb1ffff42e7a","343789c95764108dac4f8d1bd09924ed08a8a3fc","e6a7afc7b6b4a6a3ffc1c18c9dd4a5a5faa8bdfe","bae7753a1c965a284afa5eb9f5303c7d43edfeed","d047a6802ab98c8ac7f118ffc3dda61feb37e7b8","c57b85fb441b55d969ede1478de3b2b6f425a817","e67bb607ce3aced5990f5d2be48cbe7ec0d4138b","ae77a110e081a6cb83c758282ff6bc5b5f7f10f1","def5932143651adc5333908342efe3513583d413","1857de6262517042629dc6e143c32783a9a41335","db1fb084f53e25d35d279ce9498e8470bc862e21","b3024eb8ec471eba7b346e0c2687756f595c684c","e0eba114081924ae5136ae529b8f9968a2716584","e01ca4fd7805ee24f64a08e932722ec96a6c4899","0dbd8950e76c51b13f41f03895057aca852fa164","0f59194d862aa2179ecfbaad6922571f9f9d7956","d386b521a5769be77ae514d1f405c70c659d598a","dc721b67aa205ad36f94301331cabed7117c1abe","85c97afe3cd3ec6342987a8c29fa7744897f3aa4","1fcbccfeaf1db39318b6c5b7b44bec98e18db8fa","ee07ddb79f59840059233373826a2e81def25621","0395a71101859eff6d52b432484987246e66b36d","4b9ad35c429f8f8603f2eae06cfe2c04530b82f5","3af54affdb5498dc8b18c55cb3908aa8eb58439d","0587cae3afd89ffbd35b27f6c855650b817d319e","eae6e4cd29e095026cfe7075383a2ee0faa28f99","c0b2d872a85c5421f74ae3dee4c2996efa24ed21","021ccdb3195afe00c61b1be91c8e267bbf1594ce","e6433085369784383ab2e22e5651a7414aaced72","7f16c03d86a499cee4cf7d401a08cb515a4ad66e","e17a4cc42ccad9ae02dcd7f120dcccab1edc130e","8a8d724c23a3004c3cf54480362fbecc6b697cb6","f43756cc2b37d7cb4bbf957a5c9a10499b5e42c9","39665904a7dc713c80ff8395b83df260a356c667"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Species-specific accumulation of polybrominated diphenyl ether flame retardants in birds of prey from the Chesapeake Bay region, USA.","doi":"10.1016/j.envpol.2009.10.042","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2009.10.042","venue":"Environmental pollution"}

Goodman assumes that the dynamo that runs a magnetic element stops operating at t = 0. From then on, the magnetic field decays exponentially, and the induced currents heat the chromosphere. The time constants calculated by Goodman disagree with the observed values, possibly because he disregards the driving dynamo. Also, he assumes static conditions, but his magnetic force density appears suddenly when the dynamo stops, and it is about equal to the gravitational force density. The magnetic force acts downward and fluctuations in the current flowing through the magnetic element should induce vertical oscillations at the photosphere. This point should be investigated further.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Chromospheric heating by electric currents induced by fluctuating magnetic elements","doi":"10.1023/A:1004960605889","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1023/A%3A1004960605889","venue":""}

This leads to a three-step strategy for judgement aggregation. First, merge the evidence bases of the various agents using some method of belief merging. Second, determine which degrees of belief one should adopt on the basis of this merged evidence base, by applying objective Bayesian theory. Third, determine which judgements are appropriate given these degrees of belief by applying a decision-theoretic account of rational judgement formation.","inCitations":["f9d8da3283efcb97b37598f613b6c4219fda07e3","192333d6b9b9c600a075f70fdd56b3425dca3112","c484eaf768997c324df52f9cb840b8c8eaa65de5","132e429d64ae150d6e47e6a13816e096b26537d3","2bcd1f1de5f43899faa66b43368e9b6b97fc923e","d5f23e89a0a9b2989c909124ac667911c56e82e4","8243fcb68a0dc9dca56322c5be6b046a921582e2"],"pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1093/logcom/exn011","https://blogs.kent.ac.uk/jonw/files/2015/03/aggregation2006.pdf","http://www.kent.ac.uk/secl/philosophy/jw/2006/aggregation.pdf"],"title":"Aggregating Judgements by Merging Evidence","doi":"10.1093/logcom/exn011","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1093/logcom%2Fexn011","venue":"J.

The parameters of the key components in its drivetrain such as hydraulic pump/motors, accumulators, etc. determine the overall efficiency and performance of the vehicle. To optimize the matching of a WDHHV's components, the adaptive simulated annealing genetic algorithm (ASAGA) was adopted. According to different optimization objectives, the parameters were calculated and imported into the corresponding Simulink model to simulate the characters. The comparison between the results calculated by ASAGA and those by the traditional engineering test method proves that ASAGA enhances the overall searching speed and capability effectively, and is thus a better method for the optimization of the vehicle drivetrain's parameters.","inCitations":["3ece19794fc0ca55e4bb48c4857abc6807b7f86b","39b3b04d15e48be79681f280a40cde83c46e0baf"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Optimization matching of wheel drive hydraulic hybrid vehicle components based on adaptive simulated annealing genetic algorithm","doi":"10.1109/ICMA.2009.5244986","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMA.2009.5244986","venue":"2009 International Conference on Mechatronics and Automation"}

The British Geological Survey (BGS) has been charged with the task of operating and further developing a uniform network of seismograph stations throughout the UK in order to acquire standardised data on a long-term basis. The project is supported by a group of organisations under the chairmanship of the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister (ODPM) with major financial input from the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC). \nIn the 15th year of the project four new broadband seismograph stations were established, with strong-motion accelerometers deployed at three of these sites. A further four stations were upgraded to high dynamic range data acquisition. All except one of the seismic sub-networks now use data loggers running under the QNX operating system. Ten portable data loggers were purchased, which can be rapidly deployed to record data from aftershock sequences and earthquake swarms and to study specific areas. \nAll significant felt events and some others were reported rapidly to the Customer Group through seismic alerts sent by e-mail. The alerts were also published on the Internet (http://www.earthquakes.bgs.ac.uk). Monthly seismic bulletins were issued six weeks in arrears and, following revision, were compiled into an annual bulletin (Simpson, 2004). In all reporting areas, scheduled targets have been met or surpassed.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"UK earthquake monitoring 2003/2004","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

To better understand the role of psychiatry residents in university and college counseling programs, we conducted a web-based survey of United States psychiatry residency program directors. This study describes clinical activities and rotation characteristics of psychiatric residents working in counseling centers. Of the 48 residency programs that responded, 27 provide rotations at university or college counseling centers, and of those with rotations, 100% report that the residents rate these as very good or excellent. Expanding psychiatry residency rotations at college counseling centers may be mutually beneficial both to the centers and to psychiatric residents.","inCitations":["7043800d215c94bde260d576807042a6bdde2e36","a38012c3395f4d5335af3c5d296dca73757554a9"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Psychiatry Resident Rotations in University and College Counseling Centers: A Pilot Study of Rotation Types and Challenges","doi":"10.1080/87568225.2013.824345","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1080/87568225.2013.824345","venue":""}

However, medications for this condition are not commercially available in Japan. The \"hospital formulation\" is a customized medicine which hospital pharmacists prepare when doctors cannot carry out the medical therapy most suitable for a patient using commercial medicines. However, as the duties of pharmacists increase, use of the \"hospital fomulation\" decreases. Therefore, development of \"hospital fomulations\" based on individual evidence has a limit. Irsogladine maleate (IM) is a drug with gastric mucosal protective properties. IM increases intracellular cAMP levels in the gastric mucosa and activates communication between cells. It has been reported that the oral administration of IM reduces the incidence of 5-FU-based chemotherapy-induced stomatitis. However, there have been no reports on the effect of the direct use of IM in treating stomatitis. Therefore, we studied the development of an IM oral spray for stomatitis treatment, and obtained evidence of a direct effect in an animal experiment using a stomatitis model. Next, rebamipide mouthwash was administered to patients who had stomatitis caused by cancer chemotherapy. The total scores were classified into Grades 0 to 4 and evaluated as a stomatitis evaluation score (SES). When comparing SES and changes in the stomatitis area in patients, gradual reductions in the extent of stomatitis were observed, even during the period when SES did not change. Having patients fill in an observation chart was effective for grasping changes in symptoms in outpatients.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"[Development of \"Patient Friendly Formulations\" to Counter the Side Effects of Cancer Chemotherapy].","doi":"10.1248/yakushi.17-00174-2","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1248/yakushi.17-00174-2","venue":"Yakugaku zasshi : Journal of the Pharmaceutical Society of Japan"}

Readministration of chemotherapeutic agents by hepatic arterial infusion (HAI) has the rationale of providing higher concentrations of chemotherapeutic agents to hepatic metastases. The present study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of HAI of fluorouracil with leucovorin (HAI 5-FU/LV) for patients with liver metastases from CRC.\n\n\nMETHODS\nFourteen patients with liver metastases from CRC who received HAI 5-FU/LV after failure of systemic chemotherapy containing fluorouracil and leucovorin were identified and their medical records were reviewed.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOf 10 patients evaluable for response, one partial response, six stable disease, and three progressive disease were reported. Additionally, the overall response and disease control rates were 7% and 50%, respectively. The median time to progression was 4.3 months (range, 2.9 to 5.6), to hepatic progression was 5.8 months (range, 4.7 to 6.9), and to extrahepatic progression was 5.8 months (range, 2.3 to 9.2). No grade 3/4 hematologic toxicities occurred and one case of abdominal pain and two cases of oral mucositis were the only grade 3 nonhematologic toxicities. Catheter-related complications occurred in three patients: one thrombosis, one infection, and one displacement.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nHAI 5-FU/LV was well tolerated and showed modest efficacy for patients with liver metastases from refractory CRC. Readministration of previously used chemotherapeutic agents via the hepatic artery could be an effective salvage option and warrants further investigation in a prospective trial.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://www.kjim.org/upload/kjim-26-82.pdf","ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/pmc/c2/42/Korean_J_Intern_Med_2011_Mar_2_26(1)_82-88.tar.gz"],"title":"Efficacy and Safety of Hepatic Arterial Infusion of Fluorouracil with Leucovorin as Salvage Treatment for Refractory Liver Metastases from Colorectal Cancer","doi":"10.3904/kjim.2011.26.1.82","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.3904/kjim.2011.26.1.82","venue":"The Korean journal of internal medicine"}

To better understand the defense response to V. dahliae, transcriptome analysis of roots from S. aculeatissimum in response to V. dahliae infection was performed. A total of 69,824 all-unigenes were obtained through Illumina/Solexa sequencing. Functional annotations by aligning all-unigenes with public protein databases including NCBI non-redundant protein (NR), Clusters of Orthologous Groups (COG), Swiss-Prot protein, and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) were obtained. The gene expression profiles of S. aculeatissimum infected with V. dahliae were compared to those of non-infected plants, and 11,696 upregulated and 5949 downregulated genes were identified. Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment and metabolic pathway-enrichment analysis were performed. Some V. dahliae-resistant related genes, including putative resistance genes (R-genes), phenylpropanoid pathway-related genes, genes encoding pathogenesis-related proteins (PRs) and transcription factors were identified.

As a public figure, the music historian found himself called upon to state why music matters – in a preface, a dedication or an essay. Like Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Burney read in musical performances symptoms of contemporary society and politics, but, unlike Rousseau, he perceived in modern music signs of civilization's progress. Musical excellence, according to Burney, required both freedom and affluence; thus while Burney rejected absolutist monarchy, he nevertheless praised the achievements of court culture. Indeed, his advocacy of music as an ‘innocent luxury’ reads as an addendum to eighteenth-century disputes on the morality and benefits of luxury. The social implications of this definition of music, however, are problematic: while Burney acknowledged the right of each individual to feel as they please, he also claimed for the music critic the exclusive authority to speak publicly about music. This essay explores these aspects of Burney's political philosophy of music in relation to the works of Rousseau, Montesquieu, Avison, Wollstonecraft and Hume.","inCitations":["938d9bc146063ec0a28d1cf1e5e185187963af63"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Charles Burney; or, the Philosophical Misfortune of a Liberal Musician","doi":"10.1017/S1478570612000358","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1017/S1478570612000358","venue":""}

Based on this fact many variants of median filter were developed to improve the performance of the standard median filter. In this paper a new approach for the restoration of gray scale and color images that are highly corrupted by impulse noise is proposed. The algorithm works on low density noise also. The algorithm has three stages - firstly, finding the corrupted pixels, secondly de-noising the corrupted pixels; thirdly, minimizing the de-noised image to root image. The article proves that the new approach is guaranteed to converge to root image within a finite number of iterations. The proposed algorithm shows better results than the Standard Median Filter, Recursive Median Filter and Decision based Unsymmetrical Trimmed Median Filter.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Removal of Impulse Noise Using Iterative Unsymmetrical Trimmed Median Filter","doi":"10.5120/15686-4556","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.5120/15686-4556","venue":""}

Total PBDE concentrations in all sediment samples ranged from 0.03 to 17.5 ng/g dry weight (mean 1.33 ng/g dry wt). The most predominant congeners were BDE-47 and BDE-99, which comprised 30 and 25 % of total PBDE concentrations, respectively. Results from statistical analysis indicated that the potential sources of PBDEs of sediments in Hanoi may come from penta-BDE and octa-BDE mixtures. Risk quotients of PBDEs in sediments were also calculated for a benthic species, ranged from 2.12 × 10−6 − 1.60 × 10−2, and were markedly lower than threshold value for occurrence of any ecotoxicological risk. This study provides some of the most comprehensive data on the occurrence of PBDEs in sediments from lake and river systems in Vietnam.","inCitations":["88b34f0cf8a851441a751c7bfbc0872222008025","3ab02c1315242373f1485605b587c0a78ca43a18","d5fed33293a3da115c8917618edc47a31096ca3a","4716f635c832746cda04b302bd4cf4ec49d90ca3"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Distribution, accumulation profile, and risk assessment of polybrominated diphenyl ethers in sediment from lake and river systems in Hanoi Metropolitan Area, Vietnam","doi":"10.1007/s11356-015-5235-7","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11356-015-5235-7","venue":"Environmental Science and Pollution Research"}

The former contributed to about 80%~90% and the latter 10%~20% at 23℃. As the ambient temperature increased from 23℃ to 550℃, the damping capacity decreased slowly to 60%~70% of that at 23℃ finally. Compared with the specimen water-cooled at 900℃, the damping-maximum torsion strain of the furnace-cooled at 1100℃ was much lower, which meaned that its damping reaction to the environmental noise was more intensive.

In the corneal stroma many inflammatory cells with high activities of acid glycosidases and lysosomal proteases were present. This was accompanied with significantly elevated plasmin activity in the tear fluid (1.6 IU/ml). Plasmin appeared also in the aqueous humour (0.8 IU/ml). For the treatment of these changes catalase (1 mg/1 ml saline), aprotinin (100 micrograms/1 ml saline) and catalase-aprotinin mixture (1:1) were applied on the eye surface during irradiation. The catalase-aprotinin mixture was most efficient and decreased plasmin activity in the tear fluid and diminished disturbances of the anterior eye segment. Obviously both, active oxygen species and elevated plasmin activity in the tear fluid contribute to the damage of the anterior eye segment and development of intracorneal inflammation after irradiation of the eye with UVB rays.","inCitations":["e24b50b3c9ecb257347acb51210c671ba209d245","6cf8f321aaac687a274e52f8977846fa7bdd23d9","7b57bb6be1fd3ed0ce87a4db3b0759c5a946ece6","3c32044492141a2895a41e9cc627898dedbefb7f","c1b31874014fffda17792bd5408646b1d06f4a29","2d440c3fdfe99fce21ad01f8e53f8e7816c517ca","17d767ea3a2bc6710086fe6a67a2f7be1d02ac87","ba4089a6eb5cbaae294c33f9b28755de609101b1","adf77481ff7ba4b1868134c83d9fc5a4dd9d2738","c331fa83f8488f3753d21eaa6362f0f42c9ba141","51acad37a000ea3628e39c22ccba11aeb6a5aec1","cc4440c354537d1dc1392f471de4ddb47727dd1f","cbda6f50d8013ab57a499345ad2adc5d1d1d21fe","fa033225a0f5d7ef0ff624e1dba63289ba49b34a","a5a8f56dec7c1ddbd3601783dbce98cbd61ba2ac","912ee4f00bc5ae676850515e97fd0ad05d2c5ffa","ba087473d65f138f3d9945c9515355b7b60068fb","54393bd5c9c3cc0057f1a75d30abac4a70b3f6cc","1fc99a6e519a6967c5b90ddacd068d8a9da489c7","a6e12aba6e3875a19b2de28a90ca0dfd138ba034"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"The damaging effect of UV rays below 320 nm on the rabbit anterior eye segment.

After 15 minutes of unsuccessful cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) on the ambulance the patient was transferred to the emergency unit of a hospital and was treated with bolus injection of 50 mg t-PA initially and 50 mg over the next two hours. Five minutes after the initial bolus the circulation could be stabilised and the patient could be extubated the next morning. The patient did not present any neurological deficit on the day of discharge nor did she show any bleeding complications. The time elapsing from notice to emergency service to arrival at hospital was about 35 minutes.\n\n\nDISCUSSION\nIn patients with massive and life-threatening pulmonary embolism thrombolysis offers an opportunity to manage this critical situation. Due to the serious prognosis of these patients the potential benefit of thrombolysis outweighs the lack of preceding diagnostic procedures and the risk of potential side-effects.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nIn the light of an excellent outcome of this patient thrombolytic therapy with t-PA appears to be justified under continued CPR if fulminant pulmonary embolism is suspected.","inCitations":["287a2b32f235f3550665bf8892d5540f5800fb02","da49a7a4ec92f3f56453fa9838bb6766914ca87d","17ec388f9a9185694a93494f144f79d540e6ea60","69f7e04c5b0ec9f5580b776d2359d8a414819c38","c4dc74e33cb95cefd2de6fa86c6b003e166dea6a","340e46101e1c97ce11797631dac1b8ede4550c5e","039dd7955b1d0bfdc5cc846e514df6002749c281"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"[Successful resuscitation after bolus injection of tissue-type plasminogen activator in emergency admission].","doi":"","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"Anasthesiologie, Intensivmedizin, Notfallmedizin, Schmerztherapie : AINS"}

Normal male and female animals were used as well as castrated animals with implants containing oestradiol-17 beta (E2). In animals with high levels of circulating oestrogen, intact pro-oestrous rats and females and males bearing an E2 implant, individual units could be recorded that were spontaneously active and with axons that could be excited by stimulation in the crus cerebri. Such antidromically identified striato-nigral neurones were invariably silent in male animals and in ovariectomised females. In contrast to animals in pro-oestrus, intact female animals during metoestrus showed the 'male' pattern of striatal cell activity. These results show that E2 can stimulate spontaneous firing of striato-nigral neurons, and that this action of E2 is not sex-dependent.","inCitations":["9969e517c9669fb12ade8949060397784469f698","dfb3d4b31bb4de225cfb095e3c186f05a0a23731","089bf91c4ce6d606684ae740f649942130d104b1","ed0f263f0c9730b4556853e074eff886e292788f","56c006d45712bc122dd41f43848d80a3c324a8a3"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Oestradiol-17 beta increases the firing rate of antidromically identified neurones of the rat neostriatum.","doi":"10.1159/000123527","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1159/000123527","venue":"Neuroendocrinology"}

In fact, at UHF, radiofrequency (RF) field inhomogeneity generates hot-spots that could cause localized tissue heating. Unfortunately, local SAR measurements are not available in present MR systems; thus, electromagnetic simulations must be performed for RF fields and SAR analysis. In this study, we used three-dimensional full-wave numerical electromagnetic simulations to investigate the dependence of local SAR at 7.0 T with respect to subject size in two different scenarios: surface coil loaded by adult and child calves and quadrature volume coil loaded by adult and child heads. In the surface coil scenario, maximum local SAR decreased with decreasing load size, provided that the RF magnetic fields for the different load sizes were scaled to achieve the same slice average value. On the contrary, in the volume coil scenario, maximum local SAR was up to 15% higher in children than in adults.","inCitations":["7608a8369482cfaa15bb49665b7c8f9ada59a6b8","6b2aab4e86321aa3d4b1dc26d14e38a3aaba8079","017fb716e301d6168c8aa41697e618a2419030af","33fca5c04cb53dd1bd7be6d4f6fd4751fd90f5de","3e5974fcb95332c6458030d9a093e863150ee50d","5138ccfe3b7485c82473d99c82580bada3882b95","a09dd57e2fc4764fa670017e15a699e3f4de6168"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Investigation of maximum local specific absorption rate in 7 T magnetic resonance with respect to load size by use of electromagnetic simulations.","doi":"10.1002/bem.21907","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1002/bem.21907","venue":"Bioelectromagnetics"}
