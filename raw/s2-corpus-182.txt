Dans cet esprit, nous avons developpe une plateforme informatique concue par des chirurgiens, des graphistes et des professionnels de la prevention des risques. Le but de ce travail est d’etudier la validite et la qualite de l’information apportee. Cette plateforme fonctionne sur des tablettes dediees. La plateforme offre une aide a la consultation permettant au chirurgien, en temps reel, de commenter une courte animation 3D de l’intervention qu’il va proposer, sur une duree n’excedant pas 40 secondes. Le volet medico-legal est garanti par des signatures electroniques permettant non seulement de valider que le patient a bien compris l’information, bien recu les documents, mais aussi d’en conserver la preuve sur serveur securise agree sante. Une etude prospective a ete realisee sur 50 patients menee par 2 chirurgiens a orientations differentes. Le niveau de comprehension de l’acte propose atteint 97 % grâce a ces animations, ce qui devient bien superieur aux niveaux habituels obtenus par une explication orale seule, des photos ou des dessins. La visualisation du principe chirurgical de facon didactique et non sanglante constitue un facteur d’adhesion pour le patient, ainsi qu’un gain de temps et de confort pour le praticien. Les videos 3D sont utilisees en chirurgie de la main et des lambeaux de la face en phase de tests depuis 1 an et demi. L’appreciation des praticiens a ete tres favorable. La centralisation des documents sur un site unique simplifie egalement le travail de l’assistante. L’utilisation de la video pour expliquer l’acte operatoire n’est pas nouvelle mais il s’agit la plupart du temps de videos sanglantes inutilisables en temps reel en consultation. Nous avons pris le parti de developper des animations 3D scenarisees par des chirurgiens pour les patients. Cela a ete une telle revolution dans notre facon de consulter que nous avons decide de developper ce concept et de l’appliquer a l’ensemble de la specialite. L’information preoperatoire est un element cle de la reussite d’une intervention de chirurgie de la main. La nouvelle approche proposee, a la fois simple et moderne, est de nature a favoriser cette information preoperatoire de qualite. Elle offre au chirurgien une approche dynamisante de la consultation, et une maitrise complete et sauvegardee de l’archivage des documents medico-legaux. Par le progres qu’elle apporte, cette approche moderne sera ainsi de nature a se developper rapidement dans l’avenir.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Validation clinique d’une nouvelle approche pour l’amélioration de l’information préopératoire des patients en chirurgie de la main","doi":"10.1016/j.hansur.2017.10.005","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.hansur.2017.10.005","venue":""}

By adjusting the length and width of the radiating patch, the radius of the cambered ground, and the distance between them, a good result can be obtained.

LPS reduced food intake in LPS-naïve mice and LPS pretreatment attenuated this effect. LPS decreased trGSH at 24 hours after injection in LPS-naïve mice but 4 days later trGSH levels were upregulated in brain and liver, and this was associated with a significant attenuation of LPS-induced anorexia. In addition, LPS increased mitochondrial GSH levels in brain and liver at 4 days after injection. Pharmacological GSH depletion with diethylmaleate and L-buthionine sulfoximine in LPS-pretreated mice ablated the hyposensitivity to the anorexic effect of LPS. Together, these findings suggest a prominent role for GSH and its intracellular repartition in LPS anorexia.","inCitations":["6c2491cff75b30b284dad5a69de616af203c6a35","6687eca0bd4ed432aa529f6ac293134874aaa734"],"pdfUrls":["http://doc.rero.ch/record/8700/files/arsenijevic_rgh.pdf","http://www.jle.com/download/ecn-274614-role_for_glutathione_in_the_hyposensitivity_of_lps_pretreated_mice_to_lps_anorexia--WWB7GH8AAQEAABXOIPsAAAAB-r.pdf","http://www.jle.com/download/ecn-276816-role_for_glutathione_in_the_hyposensitivity_of_lps_pretreated_mice_to_lps_anorexia--WUYRdn8AAQEAAE0Cs4kAAAAE-r.pdf","http://www.jle.com/download/ecn-276816-role_for_glutathione_in_the_hyposensitivity_of_lps_pretreated_mice_to_lps_anorexia--WpEQuX8AAQEAAAabXAUAAAAB-r.pdf","http://www.jle.com/download/ecn-274614-role_for_glutathione_in_the_hyposensitivity_of_lps_pretreated_mice_to_lps_anorexia--WWY7g38AAQEAABbXMsYAAAAM-r.pdf","http://www.jle.com/download/ecn-274614-role_for_glutathione_in_the_hyposensitivity_of_lps_pretreated_mice_to_lps_anorexia--WjhVh38AAQEAAEC618QAAAAG-r.pdf","http://www.jle.com/download/ecn-274614-role_for_glutathione_in_the_hyposensitivity_of_lps_pretreated_mice_to_lps_anorexia--WUMXT38AAQEAAG3DDWAAAAAG-r.pdf"],"title":"Role for glutathione in the hyposensitivity of LPS-pretreated mice to LPS anorexia.","doi":"10.1684/ecn.2007.0090","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1684/ecn.2007.0090","venue":"European cytokine network"}

Islam, Science, and the Challenge of History. New Haven, CT * London: Yale University Press, 2010, xii+240 pp; ISBN 978-0300159110. Divided into four chapters (\"Beginnings and Beyond\"; \"Science and Philosophy\"; \"Science and Religion\"; and \"In the Shadow of Modernity\"), and hailed by Yale's Dimitri Gutas as the \"first serious treatment of the whole subject, superseding all earlier, partial, incompetent and, for the most part, biased (through ignorance) works\" (book jacket), Ahmad Dallal's Islam, Science, and the Challenge of History attempts to \"situate the Islamic culture of science in relation to social and cultural trends in Muslim societies\" (p. xi). Based on the author's Terry Lectures delivered at Yale University in February 2008, the book demonstrates the author's passionate and lifelong involvement with the topic of the relationship between religious and scientific knowledge. \"Beginnings and Beyond\", the first chapter, provides a brief account of the emergence of science in Islamic civilization. The main question discussed in the first section is the role played by the translation movement of the ninth century in the emergence and subsequent development of Islamic science. For the construction of his historical sketch, Dallal \"draws most on two interpretive essays published in 1998, whose authors have attempted to address in systematic ways the particular social and historical roots of the translation movement and the general social factors that contributed to the rise and development of scientific thought\" (p. 13). The first is Dimitri Gutas' Greek Thought, Arabic Culture and the second George Saliba's al-Fikr al-Hlmi al-carabi: Nas'atuhu wa tatawwuruhu. Dallal acknowledges the distinct approaches of these two important historians of science (p. 13-14), and shares with each the historically verifiable conclusion that the translation movement did not give birth to science in Islamic civilization but rather itself emerged in response to the needs of the emerging scientific movement. The section on \"Social and Institutional Contexts\" offers one of the most rewarding readings of the first chapter, for here Dallal's lucid, source-based narrative simply dissolves the erroneous model that pitted the Islamic sciences against the rational sciences--a hypothesis which has been repeatedly ad nauseam in mainstream books on history of science since its first articulation in the second decade of the twentieth century and reinforced by such classics as George Makdisi's 1981 Rise of Colleges: Institutions of Learning in Islam and the West. Dallal provides an impressive array of textual support for debunking this hypothesis, and his sources are indicative of his thorough grounding in the history of Islamic science. In this section, the work he most relies on is Sonja Brentjes' 2002 study, \"On the Location of the Ancient or 'Rational' Sciences in Muslim Educational Landscapes\", wherein she \"argues that education in the exact sciences was a stable aspect of education in Muslim societies, just as education in the religious sciences was. Furthermore, scientific education took place within recognizable networks whose structures paralleled those of religious education\" (p. 19). Dallal concludes: \"In fact, the evidence for the presence of the rational sciences as a constitutive element in the educational landscape of classical Muslim societies is simply overwhelming\" (p. 19). He then affirms, with additional force and evidence, Saliba's conclusion in his seminal Islamic Science and the Making of the European Renaissance (1): \"The predominance of the Greek scientific tradition and its vital influence on the development of the Arabo-Islamic sciences is a given. But Arabic science was not a mere museum of Greek scientific knowledge\" (p. 26). Drawing examples from disparate scientific disciplines such as medicine, optics, and algebra, Dallal states: \"Demonstrably, the culture of science struck deep roots in classical Muslim societies. …","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Ahmad Dallal.

Ten nurses were interviewed using a semi-structured script. The data were interpreted based on the discourse analysis of Social Psychology, through the technique of Maps of Association of Ideas. Results: it was identified that the feelings reported by nurses in regards to the exercise of managerial work are predominantly negative.

Angiotensin II (AngII), the primary agonist of aldosterone secretion from adrenal glomerulosa cells, is known to induce cholesterol mobilization to mitochondria. However, the role of the protein kinase C (PKC) pathway in mediating cholesterol mobilization is unknown. To determine PKC's involvement, human adrenocortical carcinoma cells were incubated with or without PKC-activating phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and mitochondrial cholesterol content assayed. Like AngII, PMA significantly elevated mitochondrial cholesterol content as well as aldosterone secretion. Thus, PKC may play a role in cholesterol mobilization to mitochondria and hence steroid production. Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) inhibited both AngII- and PMA-stimulated mitochondrial cholesterol content. These findings suggest that the ability of ANP to inhibit steroidogenesis induced by multiple agents may be related to its capacity to reduce cholesterol mobilization.","inCitations":["72d8cf03ca92bd44b7bc878b298e9dd2b4f56648","141f444df96af07def906b52d7f9dcbd8366b44d"],"pdfUrls":["https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0303720708003717","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0303720708003717?dgcid=api_sd_search-api-endpoint"],"title":"Phorbol ester increases mitochondrial cholesterol content in NCI H295R cells","doi":"10.1016/j.mce.2008.08.022","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mce.2008.08.022","venue":"Molecular and Cellular Endocrinology"}

However, new low light level charge coupled devices (L3CCD) have a large on-chip gain which can allow a signal to be detected above the noisy readout amplifier. This gain has a statistical nature, meaning that the photon input cannot be predicted exactly. We investigate several techniques for photon prediction at different light levels, and demonstrate how this affects the noise on the signal. Accurate signal estimation can be achieved with very faint signals, up to about one photon per pixel per read. Above this, accuracy gradually decreases, though our signal-to-noise ratio is never worse than square root(2n). Optical interferometry requires detection of very faint signals, and the use of an L3CCD is found to allow reproduction of interferometric visibilities to high precision. Custom instrumentation used for control is also detailed.","inCitations":["d8bec6c7eae50d2184a668c4060fb881d945aad6","6deb5c0587691248d8b2d248b64dade9568c11d7","9220a898eff8b9867ea8397fdacd1b1d0e44fb37"],"pdfUrls":["http://community.dur.ac.uk/a.g.basden/papers/spie4838-145.pdf"],"title":"Low readout noise CCDs in optical interferometry","doi":"10.1117/12.459328","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1117/12.459328","venue":"SPIE Astronomical Telescopes + Instrumentation"}

It contrasts with BronislawMalinowski’s early confident reach for academic domination (1967) – but then she did not admire him or his theories. Elizabeth worked among the Tonga people of Zambia over a period of seventy years (1946 to 2016), initially with the Plateau Tonga and then among the Gwembe (or Valley) Tonga of the Zambezi Valley, almost entirely on the Zambian side of the river. Her magisterial ethnographic work encompassed almost every aspect of Gwembe Tonga society and traced the changes from settled agricultural life on the rich soils of the riverbanks to the despair of dislocation and the establishment of a new pattern of existence. The change was wrought by the drowning of their land and the loss for some 57,000 people of their homes, fields and resources when Kariba Dam was filled. In 1956, she set out to trace the effects of the construction of the damming of the Zambezi River on them and, in 1971, she concluded:","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/DAA42F8E4FE8CF0A514BEB93223DC8C2/S0001972016001029a.pdf/bit_of_this_and_a_bit_of_that_an_obituary_for_elizabeth_colson.pdf"],"title":"'A bit of this and a bit of that': an obituary for Elizabeth Colson","doi":"10.1017/s0001972016001029","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1017/s0001972016001029","venue":""}

The rest of the tumours were equally divided between the oral cavity and larynx (31.6%). All tumours except two were carcinomas. The two exceptions were a glomus tumour and a malignant melanoma. The patients had received doses of radiotherapy ranging between 58.5 Grey and 75.5 Grey. Of the 38 patients, 22 (53%) completed their treatment in the prescribed time while 16 (47%) had treatment interruption on account of radiation morbidity. The cumulative radiation done at the time of interruption ranged between 20 and 46 Grey. The most frequent symptom was dryness of the mouth while the most troublesome symptom was difficulty in tasting foods. The quality of life (QOL) did not vary by age, gender or tumour site. Patients who had treatment interruption had a better QOL than those who did not.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThis study provides information that should aid in communicating with the head and neck cancer patients scheduled for radiotherapy and in the design of preventive and interventional strategies aimed at enhancing patient support and rehabilitation.","inCitations":["f323a724feb6ca02fddcb55a7101411ddcc22097","1907e7c2aca651f074de0ccceaf8c7a74c6528c0"],"pdfUrls":["https://www.ajol.info/index.php/eamj/article/download/46947/33333","http://erepository.uonbi.ac.ke:8080/xmlui/bitstream/handle/11295/29735/abstract.pdf;jsessionid=C181843AA309E346FC9AEF18C4A0F50A?sequence=2","http://erepository.uonbi.ac.ke:8080/xmlui/bitstream/handle/11295/16834/Abstract.pdf;jsessionid=93A1E2CEEBF059E50D286F1AD7C2F563?sequence=2"],"title":"Morbidity and quality of life among head and neck cancer patients treated with radical radiotherapy.","doi":"10.4314/eamj.v86i4.46947","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.4314/eamj.v86i4.46947","venue":"East African medical journal"}

The early post-9/11 phase of public diplomacy (2001–2004) is particularly significant from a communication perspective because it set the tone and in some cases the parameters for how subsequent initiatives faired. U.S. public diplomacy launched ever more innovative initiatives to reach publics in the Arab and Islamic regions. Yet, rather than gaining audience’s trust, the initiative appeared to generate more distrust and further eroded America’s credibility.

The mental health status of Buddhists was compared with that of a non-religious group matched for age which was also severely affected by the disaster. The study focused on two geographic areas which were badly damaged by the earthquake, Beichuan and Mianyang, with Beichuan having suffered the greater damage. The Mental Health Inventory for the Elderly (MHIE) was used to measure the cognitive efficiency, emotional state, self-perception, interpersonal communication, and adaptive ability of survivors at two different times and in two different places: in Beichuan at 4 months and 10 months after the earthquake, and in Mianyang at 6 months and 10 months after the disaster. The scores on the Mental Health Inventory for the older Buddhists in Beichuan were significantly lower than those for the non-religious participants there, but no significant differences were found in Mianyang. The mental health scores of older Buddhists in Beichuan 10 months after the earthquake were significantly better than those recorded 4 months after the earthquake. There were no significant differences in the mental health measurements of Buddhists between testing times in Mianyang.

This article intends to understand the reason why the city chose to become a zealous host of sporting mega-events. Through scrutinizing journalist reports, official almanacs and academic works, the findings revealed that the East Asian Games enabled Macau to accept the norms of China and follow its trend, whereas the Lusophone Games and the Asian Indoor Games facilitated the city to respectively enhance its influence in the international Portuguese-speaking community and realize its goal of joining the International Olympic Committee. The zealousness thus was confirmed as a strategy with the aim of promoting both post-handover Macau’s integration with China and its engagement with the world.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"From Integration with China to Engagement with the World: International Mega-Sports Events in Post-Handover Macau","doi":"10.1080/09523367.2016.1264390","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1080/09523367.2016.1264390","venue":""}

Multi-frequency network consumes large spectrum to transmit local information alone. Therefore an efficient technique is required to embed both local and global content in single constellation. In this paper, hierarchical modulation or multilayered modulation is employed to satisfy this requirement in which the task is achieved by layered constellation. The base layer carries the high priority global contents and the low priority information is carried by the enhancement layer. The performance of the system is highly determined by the detection rules and the coder chosen. The performance of hierarchical modulation system is analysed by framing decision rules for both high priority and low priority streams. In addition to derivation of probability of error of the system, the analysis of bit error rate of coded and uncoded system is done. Convolutional encoder with code rate 1/3, 1/2 and 2/3 is used in this paper.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Mathematical modelling and analysis of hierarchical modulation in AWGN and Rayleigh channel","doi":"10.1504/ijwmc.2019.10018548","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1504/ijwmc.2019.10018548","venue":""}

Innovation in the SMEs e-marketplace is one of the effective ways in an attempt to win the competition, which among others can be applied to the online transaction system. Online transaction system is one of the vital elements of the e-marketplace that can be developed using elements of game design called gamification to enhance the experience, loyalty, brand awareness, and motivation of the buyer in the transaction. Problems often occur in this gamification is on concepts and designs that are not systematic, design patterns are narrow and rigid, overly oriented reward and not oriented to the user. Relating to this issue, gamification which aims to influence user behavior in tune with the concept of Appreciative Inquiry (AI) that can be applied to the design of gamification. Analysis of the Appreciative Inquiry generate gamification application is done on the exploration and selection of products to encourage users to frequently see the products of SMEs. The application of gamification is intended for buyers and sellers, which can motivate the buyer in terms of the look of the product and the seller is motivated in terms of the presentation of its Techno.COM, Vol. 14, No. 3, Agustus 2015: 173-180 174 products. This gamification gives uniqueness and differentiation from competitors and can increase the likelihood of purchasing the product. Ranking products that are most often seen also motivate a seller or provider of the product to be able to give the best presentation of their products.

(1995). The model was run for two genera of copepod namely Calanus and Acartia, these being taken as representative of a large and small copepod respectively. The output of the model has units of number of eggs per female per day and as such needs to be multiplied by the number of females present within any one location to obtain the secondary production. Such data can be obtained from the Continuous Plankton Recorder (CPR) survey. This step, as reported in the previous appendix document, resulted in a computed daily egg production. The next step allows the computation of standing stock biomass for C. finmarchicus, C. helgolandicus and Acartia (using data for Psuedocalanus) and, once raised by a proportion of the gut contents represented by these two genera, an estimation for the food available to mackerel larvae can be obtained.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://www.npm.ac.uk/rsdas/papers/smyth_smr2001/smyth_smr2001b.pdf","http://www.npm.ac.uk/rsdas/papers/smyth_smr2001/smyth_smr2001a.pdf"],"title":"Appendix – Remote Sensing Using remote sensing to determine estimates of secondary production .

Endogenous antioxidants may increase in response to oxidants and reduce tissue injury. We investigated the antioxidant response of the lungs to the chronic release of ROS, as occurs in the immune-specific granulomatous inflammation of chronic beryllium disease (CBD), and compared it with that in healthy controls and individuals exposed to cigarette smoke. The antioxidants superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase, glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and glutathione (GSH) were quantitated in lung epithelial lining fluid (ELF) and serum from control subjects (n = 10), cigarette smokers (n = 8), and individuals with CBD (n = 9). GPx activity and extracellular GPx (eGPx) protein were increased in the ELF of subjects with CBD in comparison with that of control subjects and smokers (eGPx in ELF: controls, 1.3 +/- 0.2 microgram/ml, smokers, 1.9 +/- 0.3 microgram/ml, CBD, 3.8 +/- 0.8 microgram/ml; p = 0.002; GPx U/ml ELF, controls 1.4 +/- 0.3, smokers 1.8 +/- 0.4, CBD, 4.5 +/- 1, p = 0.02). Smokers' ELF had higher levels of GSH than that of controls, but CBD patients' ELF contained much more GSH than that of either controls or smokers (p < 0.001). Increases in GSH were correlated with eGPx, indicating similar inducing mechanisms for these antioxidants. Thus, coordinate augmentation of the glutathione antioxidant system occurs in granulomatous lung inflammation.","inCitations":["a41789ee4ca4b287a261b436d793c51249fc941b","62fb83152576ffb6214bc4df47d97badf48efb64","4747ad5381299cccf39fe3854d8fe54d74a9ba21","73bd754189ac9cc4cb4e15d365db9b2812cff0ff","c6e9fb878d77d03c9ab581ecc78557e02ba3feb7","305f664bfaa5bb47bfe1cc9960826ee2bf7aff5d","5dd3bf0d87684eec4a1da37883291b71f3e05cf9","f2b4f4e97b8c70b5b5fe70d19f460955b818affb","84bd1265d648e0b38ec630399185b8f69694f8da","e5027b01b5f80aaf7f8ade23a18dbcf0276c512c","6394cf777c6981a370a1b8d499de2811a4cc9429","2dde1b982865f4d0f88f33c815bfded8f83ac90b","9d923384fd7aa5758b05e9cfe7dad1cfbeb60d01","abe477a15ebebb81ccfdc6a35a6720c7cb566611","278c14e520926c030919a0a4a508b1500b8eef14","3af86188453a3fe40308a15b9644cb58bac774b3","8dd095bbcd135b173d3c2fb67eee6ebaab72c02f","24516c93f3beab7c25e77fda373dfecc6185c647","c7967c99ddac7df518e5c75a798777b3ca96815e","2baa7401bc61641b950e1c12db41c981fefc7deb","a0d7245e89f4dff56c3ee6c2f31acf429b36a25d","d868cbf597cd0c034154f7e966d4b21605773726","a4a0dd8565a93a595825c481d317843c4b6dee6a","3b7fda6a4efd023cc9e9f9b2efdc8fcbc4c5da74","0f009d044e2c0e64c3628d00cc1fcb6903c1ebaa","35102986cfa7be02cce69df883a4bbbc1f9883a3","b3e11c9c8d2cd03585d999638f0e2f00ecf94cb2","9c6f66d2b39c41f2aba368c98e9adb13219e97fb","ebe65b21996d28fdf952e22543847505a5f62776","586585626b2188dfbad3c8d0b4493629995e3fe4","ac20c563ded9595d2f054fe592970dbef6e1fc30","13db16d65bc07e0d9c3df856f75d18a118a11fe7","1fbfc9f214be0ad8095b052038b4914ee37108a6","7711c955085e78a3131bd4a7848059756d2ef4a5"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.lerner.ccf.org/pathobio/comhair/documents/Comhair1999AmJRespirCritCareMedGlutathione.pdf"],"title":"Increased glutathione and glutathione peroxidase in lungs of individuals with chronic beryllium disease.","doi":"10.1164/ajrccm.159.6.9810044","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1164/ajrccm.159.6.9810044","venue":"American journal of respiratory and critical care medicine"}

In that case, on appeal from the Court of Appeal of Singapore, the Privy Council considered the circumstances in which the property right protected in passing off would come to an end through abandonment. Star Industrial is still cited as the leading authority on that point today. In that respect, it has been more durable than the plastic toothbrushes with which it was concerned. Furthermore, in an area of law that is often characterised as ‘protean’ in form and development, Star Industrial’s approach to abandonment remains striking for its apparent clarity and strictness. For that reason alone, it might be regarded as a landmark in this area of property law – an unyielding granite outcrop in a landscape that is generally made up of much more malleable material.In this chapter, I outline the key features of the claim in passing off. I then move on to explain the decision in Star Industrial and to demonstrate its continuing significance. I argue that, while apparently uncontroversial, the Opinion of the Privy Council fits rather uncomfortably within the framework of protection generally accorded to unregistered marks. While the fundamental principles of the law of passing off are generally aligned closely with the reactions of real marketplace consumers, Star Industrial establishes a rule that seems inconsistent with this approach. As such, its status as a landmark may be more problematic than has hitherto been suggested.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Star Industrial Co Ltd v Yap Kwee Kor: The End of Goodwill in the Tort of Passing Off","doi":"10.5040/9781474203210.ch-012","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.5040/9781474203210.ch-012","venue":""}

These drugs are individually associated with renal toxicity; hence concurrent use might be detrimental to renal function. Objectives: This study, comparatively evaluated the toxicological effects of treatments with tenofovir, rifampicin and tenofovir- rifampicin combination on renal function of male albino rats. Materials and Methods: Healthy adult male albino rats used for this study were divided into five (5) groups of sixteen animals (16) each. Animals in group A (placebo control) and group B (solvent control) were treated orally with water and arachis oil respectively. Animals in groups C-E were treated orally with 80mg/kg of rifampicin, 32 mg/kg of tenofovir and tenofovir-rifampicin combination for 1-8 weeks respectively. Animals were weighed and sacrificed at the end of drug treatment, blood samples were collected, centrifuged and serum extracted for creatinine, urea, uric acid, albumin, total protein and glucose evaluation. Animals were dissected kidneys were collected and weights determined. Results : Treatment with tenofovir-rifampicin combination did not produce significant ( p >0.05) effects on body and relative kidney weights, albumin, total protein and glucose levels when compared to their individual doses. Furthermore, insignificant ( p >0.05) and time-dependent increases in serum creatinine, urea and uric acid levels were obtained in animals treated with combined doses of TDF-RIF when compared to their individual doses. Conclusion : These results showed that concurrent use of tenofovir and rifampicin in the management of human immunodeficiency virus and tuberculosis co-infection may not be associated with synergistic renal toxicity at the dose levels used.

Current numbers (2010 - 2015) of between 500 and 1000 are at the lower end of the range, which peaked at nearly 4000 between 1981 and 1983. Superimposed on an overall long-term decrease are medium-term fluctuations in the size of summer populations. These fluctuations are similar to those reported in Victoria on the Australian mainland, but the magnitudes of the long-term changes in Tasmania are greater and slightly lagged in time relative to Victoria. The results of banding studies in south-east Tasmania and Victoria provide valuable insights into the overwintering (non-breeding season) behaviour of Red-necked Stints in Australia. In both Tasmania and Victoria, adult birds usually return to the same location each year after breeding in the northern hemisphere. Juveniles do not migrate to breed in the northern hemisphere until at least 18 months of age, although some juveniles undertake a partial movement northward in the Austral winter. Consequently, winter count numbers in Tasmania underestimate annual juvenile recruitment. In Victoria, juvenile proportions of Red-necked Stint in summer cannon net catches have been used to indicate recruitment rates, with annual variations attributed to changes in Arctic breeding success. Similar annual variations are apparent in the proportions of juvenile Red-necked Stint in south-east Tasmanian summer populations, based on the winter / summer count proportions. Between 1980 and 2005, the magnitudes of these metrics were similar during periods when the summer population was increasing, but the Tasmanian proportions were much lower when the populations were decreasing. The results are consistent with a demographic model involving high levels of juvenile recruitment into the south-east Tasmanian population when Red-necked Stint populations are at high levels during summer on the Australian mainland and the juveniles are forced farther south to Tasmania to find foraging opportunities. Short term fluctuations reflect variations in Arctic breeding success, but are variably attenuated by the extent to which juveniles find foraging opportunities at more northern latitudes. Since 2010, south-east Tasmanian results are inconsistent with the previous long-term trends suggesting fundamental change(s) to one or more of the factors affecting the balance between recruitment and mortality may have occurred.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Red-necked stint and curlew sandpiper in south-east Tasmania: Part 1 red-necked stint - population trends and juvenile recruitment","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

This poses three challenges: First, if a user loses one or several of his passwords, can he still access his data? Second, how many passwords does an attacker need in order to access the data? And finally, how many passwords does an attacker need in order to irreversibly delete the user's data? In this paper, we model the dependencies of online accounts in order to help the user discover security weaknesses.

From its initial observation in Lake George, New York, USA in 1985, by 1993 milfoil had spread to 106 discrete locations within the lake. A 7-year study of one site having no management showed milfoil to grow expansively, suppressing native plant species from 20 in 1987 to 6 in 1993 with the average number of species m−2 quadrat declining from 5.5 in 1987 to less than 2 in 1993. Management of milfoil by means of hand harvesting, suction harvesting and benthic barrier has reduced the number of unmanaged sites from 106 in 1993 to 11. One year post-treatment at sites utilizing suction harvesting, showed a greater number of native species at all sites than pretreatment with a substantial reduction in milfoil biomass. At sites where benthic barrier was removed 1–2 years after installation, milfoil had recolonized 44% of grid squares within 30 days. Ninety days after barrier removal 74% of grid squares contained milfoil and one year later 71% of the grids supported milfoil. During the first year following mat removal, the average number of species m−2 peaked at 4.7 and stabilized at 4.5 during the second year. Hand harvesting by SCUBA in areas of limited milfoil growth (new sites of infestation and sites of former treatment) was found to reduce the number of milfoil plants present in subsequent years. Hand harvesting did not eliminate milfoil at any of the sites and regrowth/colonization necessitated reharvesting every 3 or more years. Results of evaluations of physical plant management techniques indicate that (1) an integrated program utilizing different techniques based on plant density reduced the growth of milfoil and (2) long term commitment to aquatic plant management is necessary since none of the techniques employed singly were found to eliminate milfoil.","inCitations":["aa74ef49532691ef44bd8e715ce9a8f2f5030298","ff169691de85dfe2be81a67401e91d13d330f809","7281de8bd6d39ef0b14af0ac905c7263bb5fbba7","e2b34306b5bf451cd20e20d1620b3e17d7b3f6e4","d06df7c41fa3aeab0bf0bd2970e2ba87a2686be4","1e63f6e8998c260bbebd2690c91c579fc022e6d5","bc565c1b03ac368a44cacef3713b60f9dd7cfad7","61e28e419fb045ebd4e5609e73cf0b8cbc2dc86e"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Physical control of Eurasian watermilfoil in an oligotrophic lake","doi":"10.1007/BF00012757","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/BF00012757","venue":"Hydrobiologia"}
