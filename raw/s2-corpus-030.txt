More specifically, we study a gas of inelastic smooth hard disks enclosed in a rectangular region under a constant gravity field. The vertical walls act as energy sinks (i.e., inelastic walls that are parallel to gravity) whereas the other two walls are perpendicular to gravity and act as energy sources. We show that this convection is due to the combined action of dissipative lateral walls and a volume force (in this case, gravitation). Hence, we call it \\textit{dissipative lateral walls convection}, DLWC. Our theory, that describes also the limit case of elastic collisions, shows that inelastic particle collisions enhance the DLWC. We perform our study via numerical solutions (volume element method) of the corresponding hydrodynamic equations, in an extended Boussinesq approximation. We show our theory describes the essentials of the results for similar (but more complex) laboratory experiments.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Inherent thermal convection in a gas inside a box under a gravity field","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Thrombomodulin (TM), tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA), plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI), interleukin-13 (IL-13), interleukin-18 (IL-18), soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (SICAM-1) were examined with ELISA methods, and superoxide dismutase (SOD) and lipid peroxidation (LPO) was examined with chemical catalysis methods. Two to three weeks after treatment with reduced glutathione, tiopronin and daidzein, blood was used for determin the above items again.\n\n\nRESULTS\n(1) The concentration of TM in patients [(2.36 +/- 0.16) ng/ml] was significantly lower than in the control [(4.36 +/- 0.24) ng/ml] (P < 0.01), while TM tended to be higher after treatment [(4.82 +/- 0.34) ng/ml] (P < 0.05). (2) The concentration of t-PA in patients [(3.44 +/- 0.34) ng/ml] was significantly lower than in the control [(4.52 +/- 0.16) ng/ml] (P < 0.05), and was higher significantly [(5.63 +/- 0.58) ng/ml] after treatment (P < 0.05); The concentration of PAI in patients [(48.23 +/- 3.59) ng/ml] was significantly higher than in the control [(31.59 +/- 2.13) ng/ml] (P < 0.05), but after treatment no significant change [(50.71 +/- 4.29) ng/ml] was found (P > 0.05).

GLP-1 reportedly increased islet proliferation and reduced apoptosis of beta-cells in rodents. In this study, we explored the chronic effect of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor vildagliptin on glucose tolerance and beta-cell mass in Irs2-knockout (Irs2-/-) mice fed a high-fat diet for 20 weeks. Wild type (WT) mice and Irs2-/mice of the same genetic background were fed standard-chow until 8 weeks of age, and then given free access to high-fat diet for 20 weeks. Half of the animals in each genotype were given vildagliptin in the drinking water (0.3 mg/ml) and others were given tap water without vildagliptin. Whereas there were no differences in body weight or food intake, vildagliptin signifi cantly reduced fasting blood glucose in Irs2-/mice. In both genotypes of mice, vildagliptin signifi cantly decreased AUC0-120min blood glucose and signifi cantly increased the insulin response to glucose during oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). To evaluate the chronic effect rather than the direct effect, we also performed OGTT one day after discontinuation of vildagliptin administration. AUC0-120min blood glucose was still signifi cantly decreased and the insulin response to glucose during OGTT was signifi cantly increased in Irs2-/mice treated with vildagliptin compared with those without vildagliptin. Histochemical analysis of pancreatic islets revealed that treatment with vildagliptin signifi cantly increased beta-cell mass (p<0.05) and proportion of beta-cells to islet cells (p<0.01) in Irs2-/mice. Vildagliptin decreased the proportion of TUNEL-positive beta-cells (p<0.05), but failed to increase the BrdU incorporation in Irs2-/mice. These results suggest that vildagliptin improved glucose tolerance and increased beta-cell mass by reducing apoptotic beta-cells in Irs2-/mice and that vildagliptin is able to reduce apoptotic beta-cells in Irs2-independent manner.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://diabetes.diabetesjournals.org/content/diabetes/60/Supplement_1/A521.full.pdf"],"title":"Exenatide Treatment Improves Processing of Pro-Islet Amyloid Poly peptide in Human and Mouse Islets during Culture","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

While prostate cancer carries the potential to metastasize to the breast, the synchronous or metachronous co-occurrence of primary breast and primary prostate cancers is quite unusual. Prostate cancer in men of African descent may have its own behaviour with regards to its relationship with male breast cancer. Case presentation: Case 1: A 64 year old male presented to Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital (CHBAH) with a 2 years history of a painless left breast lump. A core biopsy was done and confirmed breast carcinoma. Tamoxifen was started but, due to disease progression, he underwent left modified radical mastectomy followed by chemotherapy. Prostate biopsy was done for raised Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) and suspicious prostate on digital rectal examination. A prostatic adenocarcinoma was subsequently diagnosed with bone metastases on bone scan. He was started on Androgen deprivation therapy and followed up every 3 months. Case 2: A 68 year old male presented to CHBAH with a 1 year history of a painless right breast lump. A core biopsy confirmed breast cancer. Tamoxifen was started, followed by right modified radical mastectomy and chemotherapy for disease progression. A raised PSA and suspicious prostate on digital rectal examination prompted a prostate biopsy revealing a prostatic adenocarcinoma. Bone scan was negative for metastasis. He is currently on 3 monthly Androgen deprivation therapy and awaiting radiation. Conclusion: This clinical practice article not only presents this exceptionally rare duality but highlights that both cancers can coexist either as sporadic conditions, or as a result of genetic mutations. Thus, we suggest that men with prostate cancer be screened clinically, biochemically and genetically for breast cancer and vice versa.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://f1000researchdata.s3.amazonaws.com/manuscripts/20122/ca31c449-77fb-4109-b436-d4abb89b384f_16997_-_alain_mwamba_mukendi_v2.pdf?doi=10.12688/f1000research.16997.2&numberOfBrowsableCollections=19&numberOfBrowsableGateways=22&numberOfBrowsableInstitutionalCollections=5","https://f1000researchdata.s3.amazonaws.com/manuscripts/18583/db0dc2a8-3927-4bf5-906c-0b61c4ea8a57_16997_-_alain_mwamba_mukendi.pdf?doi=10.12688/f1000research.16997.1&numberOfBrowsableCollections=14&numberOfBrowsableGateways=23","https://f1000researchdata.s3.amazonaws.com/manuscripts/20122/eb0714d7-eff5-4271-9731-24a5d48eace4_16997_-_alain_mwamba_mukendi_v2.pdf?doi=10.12688/f1000research.16997.2&numberOfBrowsableCollections=15&numberOfBrowsableGateways=23","https://f1000researchdata.s3.amazonaws.com/manuscripts/20122/56dc3883-c62c-44ba-97dd-38de7fa17faa_16997_-_alain_mwamba_mukendi_v2.pdf?doi=10.12688/f1000research.16997.2&numberOfBrowsableCollections=17&numberOfBrowsableGateways=23","https://f1000researchdata.s3.amazonaws.com/manuscripts/18583/923b5f88-50df-44df-afcc-32e25a301935_16997_-_alain_mwamba_mukendi.pdf?doi=10.12688/f1000research.16997.1&numberOfBrowsableCollections=15&numberOfBrowsableGateways=23","https://f1000researchdata.s3.amazonaws.com/manuscripts/18583/7ebe3aea-7749-423d-bcc1-41e24707e199_16997_-_alain_mwamba_mukendi.pdf?doi=10.12688/f1000research.16997.1&numberOfBrowsableCollections=15&numberOfBrowsableGateways=23"],"title":"Metachronous or synchronous male breast and prostate cancers a duality to lookout for.","doi":"10.12688/f1000research.16997.2","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.12688/f1000research.16997.2","venue":"F1000Research"}

Thanks to the automatic and accurate measurement of customer opinions, the organization can integrate, understand and analyze the needs of its targets and thus adapt its marketing strategy. In this paper, we describe a new syntax-based aspect detection approach for sentiment analysis in Arabic reviews. Many characteristics of the Arabic subjective text were studied and used in order to elaborate syntactic rules and disambiguation techniques that have been integrated in our approach. The proposed approach is based on a five-step process, namely: pre-processing, lexical entities disambiguation, separation between aspects, extraction of aspects and grouping of aspects. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposal, we used two datasets of Arabic social content related to hotel and product reviews. The former is based on content extracted from TripAdvisor while the latter is from the Souq website. The Experimental results showed that the syntax-based approach obtains an F-measure of 69,56% (resp. 68.29%) for the hotels dataset (resp. the products dataset).","inCitations":["ad3ce37737fdbab5e4834a161d755249b0c2ee24","af259e97c03b03c1b7f634dae934ca12cdc24d06","0ba26603ee0e8e106e42f64c50b43833139008e5","dba0c0c2b54bda12943613e1a55e76eb330e9626","7b420cf5ec8970bf1d758f83e292776e1b126d6e"],"pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNLSP.2018.8374373"],"title":"A new syntax-based aspect detection approach for sentiment analysis in Arabic reviews","doi":"10.1109/ICNLSP.2018.8374373","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNLSP.2018.8374373","venue":"2018 2nd International Conference on Natural Language and Speech Processing (ICNLSP)"}

In the table winters are indicated in such manner as 1957/58.Researches of energetics, in most of which calculations in the wave number domain are based on the SALTZMAN's method (1957), began to investgate the instability of polar vortex. They, however, revealed that the energy for polar vortex breakdown and for reversal of temperature field are transported from troposphere mainly as geopotential flux. But the physical mechnism of the breakdown and the reversal must be explained by model simulation.MATSUNO's (1971) and NEWSON's (1974) model simulate successfully stratospheric sudden warmings in 1962/63 and 1972/73 respectively. That means that warming occures with upward propagation of planetaly waves (Charny and Drazin, 1961). Therefore it is possible that warmings happen every winter in the level higher than upper stratosphere. The reason why some of them leads to polar vortex decay in the lower stratosphere and others remain in upper layer is not yet clear.Recent researches have owed its greater part to the developments in new observation techniques as rocket sonde and satellite. Papers based on the satellite data are summerized in table 2.Warming phenomena in upper stratosphere and mesosphere without marked effects on the lower stratosphere are cited in table 3.To answer the question whether in Southern Hemisphere major warming as in its counterpart occures or not, researches of Southern Hemispheric stratospheric warmings are listed in table 4 and examined. For the present we have negative answer.Finally in table 5 studies in climatological spects as well as of phenomena after the period of table 1 are given as supplement.Important problems remained today are : 1. to establish three-demensional structure of the stratospheric sudden warming extending to the upper mesosphere with data from new technique, and2. researches on the relationship between stratospheric phenomena and troposphere are not yet sufficient, although its possibilities are expected through model experiments and discussed in many papers independently.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"A Review of Progress in Researchs of Stratospheric Sudden Warming","doi":"10.5026/jgeography.88.5_296","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.5026/jgeography.88.5_296","venue":""}

While mallagers are also curiosity drivell, they are usually required to focus their curiosity 011 those aspects ofmailers which are vital to the solutioll ofmallagemelit problems. From the mallager's perspective, the fUlldamelltal questioll to be ailswered about the COTS phellomelloll is whether or 1I0t it has beell grossly affected by humall activity. all the basis of the allswer to that questioll, the mallager will determille his respOllse, particularly \",hether or 1I0ttO illtelfere ill the 'llatural'system or to refraill from illtelferellce. The logic of this positioll is discussed. The Authority's policy on controlling COTS is not to interfere on a large scale unless it can be shown that outbreaks are caused or exacerbated by human activity. However local controls are initiated to protect sites of particular value to tourism or science. Every scientific review of this matter has supported our policy. Many people adopt one of two fundamentally different explanations for why crown-of-thorns populations suddenly increase dramatically. One is that the phenomenon is entirely 'natural'. That is, it is not affected by human activity. The other is that it is entirely human-induced. Of course, bearing in mind the pervasive effect that human activity is having on the world's biosphere, it is quite likely that the truth is a mixture of these two views, that is, that crown-of-thorns infestations are affected to some degree by human activity. We don't however, know whether this is so, and if it is, whether human activity is contributing to the intensity, frequency or extent of the phenomenon positively or negatively. The Authority recognises that long-term protection of the Reef ecosystem is the primary reason for the existence of the Authority and for everything that we do. Therefore we approach the crown-of-thorns issue from the perspective of risk. We know that the animal is a natural inhabitant of the Reef and that is has been around for millennia. We know, therefore, that the Reef as we know and cherish it has developed in the presence of the starfish. That is not to say that there have always been recurrent population explosions, but there may have been. The primary question is: should we undertake widespread and massive destruction of crown-of-thorns starfish whenever there is a primary outbreak? What are the risks and benefits of non-interference? Clearly, an immediate benefit is the saving of an enormous amount of money.

In this spatial knowledge structure, the object-oriented data structure for image encoding is the run-length code (RLG). The technique of symbolic projection is used to generate descriptions of symbolic pictures. The technique of orthogonal relationships is then applied to identify basic spatial relations. With the use of this technique, objects with complex shapes can be segmented. Production rules can then be applied to derive more complex spatial relations from the symbolic projections.","inCitations":["94629a1265501b21178bda01d3aa0c75121d05ec","57de61badc9e68aac5d152ab83b4b24ff2f3cfa3","aa636a947c1b38cc9be82951412c3b63c050dc84"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"A Spatial Knowledge Structure for Visual Information Systems","doi":"10.1007/978-1-4613-0569-9_15","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4613-0569-9_15","venue":""}

The experiment consisted of 10 combinations including two alternating rows sowings of broad bean with fennel and coriander, four variants of biological protection using Polyversum WP, Bioczos BR, Biosept 33 SL preparations, and three variants of chemical protection using Vitavax 200 FS, Decis 2.5 EC, Fastac 100 EC, Penncozeb 80 WP. Applied protection variants improved mycological purity of broad bean seeds. The best and comparable results were noted in the combination with the use of seed dressing Vitavax 200 SL, and subsequent triple foliar application of insecticides and fungicides as well as biological dressing Polyversum WP, and four-time spraying with biotechnical preparations. Companion planting of broad beans with fennel and coriander favored seeds colonization by fungi. Especially the neighborhood with fennel enriched the community of fungi present in the seeds of broad beans in Penicillium spp. (34.6%). Irrespective of the protection, Alternaria alternata (28.6%), Botrytis cinerea (12.3%), Epicoccum purpurascens (5.1%) and saprobionts of Penicillium genus (22.3%), were isolated the most frequently.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://yadda.icm.edu.pl/yadda/element/bwmeta1.element.baztech-9174ecc0-aa0a-4a40-b322-b0e24b95bc0a/c/glen_boliglowa_gospodarek_mycological_3_2016.pdf"],"title":"Mycological purity of broad bean (Vicia faba L.) seeds in the conditions of companion planting and differentiated protection","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

There is a lack of consensus regarding evidence-based guidelines or training programs for effective management of pain in the hospital. We investigated the viability of using an Internet-based opioid dosing simulator to teach residents appropriate use of opioids to treat and manage acute pain.\n\n\nMaterials and methods\nWe used a prospective, longitudinal design to evaluate the effects of simulator training. In face-to-face didactic sessions, we taught 120 (108 internal medicine and 12 family medicine) residents principles of pain management and how to use the simulator. Each trainee completed 10 training and, subsequently, 5 testing trials on the simulator. For each trial, we collected medications, doses, routes and times of administration, pain scores, and a summary score. We used mixed-effects regression models to assess the impact of simulation training on simulation performance scores, variability in pain score trajectories, appropriate use of short- and long-acting opioids, and use of naloxone.\n\n\nResults\nTrainees completed 1582 simulation trials (M = 13.2, SD = 6.8), with sustained improvements in their simulated pain management practices. Over time, trainees improved their overall simulated pain management scores (b = 0.05, P < .01), generated lower pain score trajectories with less variability (b = -0.02, P < .01), switched more rapidly from short-acting to long-acting agents (b = -0.50, P < .01), and used naloxone less often (b = -0.10, P < .01).\n\n\nDiscussion and conclusions\nTrainees translated their understanding of didactically presented principles of pain management to their performance on simulated patient cases. Simulation-based training presents an opportunity for improving opioid-based inpatient acute pain management.","inCitations":["77507b2b0d4e58044274864a0e4b1bb91e9bb883","df5309eba8943f132b2cba291d99a396c9824dbe"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Learning optimal opioid prescribing and monitoring: a simulation study of medical residents","doi":"10.1093/jamiaopen/ooy026","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1093/jamiaopen%2Fooy026","venue":"JAMIA open"}

In reflection structure there is a one-to-one mapping of peaks in the initial state probability distribution into peaks in the spectrum. No such simple relationship is known for interference structure, originally termed “internal diffraction” by Condon [Phys. Rev. 32, 858–872 (1928)]. A semiclassical treatment of the quantum mechanical overlap integrals shows that the condition for reflection structure is a monotonic difference potential in the range of internuclear distance sampled by the initial wavefunction, whereas interference structure occurs when a “polytonic” difference potential is sampled. The qualitative validity of the semiclassical treatment is illustrated through quantum calculations which show that the Franck-Condon integrals accumulate near the points of stationary phase.","inCitations":["23bbb8af04b8bb324960516e24ffb97b6f09d51d"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Reflection and interference structure in diatomic Franck-Condon distributions","doi":"10.1016/0022-2852(84)90068-7","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/0022-2852%2884%2990068-7","venue":""}

In this qualitative study data was gathered through articles that involves open ended questions and interview forms. The data was analyzed by using content analysis. At the end of the study, students have examined cultural life styles by using Works of art and have stated the differentiation capability of geographic factors climate, and religion in terms of cultural structure. Examining the art of different cultures has been considered as an important factor that has great contributions to their experience. Through this methods, they have questioned their cultural values in terms of understanding and interpreting.

The question of whether chronic subcutaneous administration of EGF (19.1 pg/day for 3 or 6 wk) could alter the course of chronic renal failure in rats subjected to 5/6 nephrectomy was studied. By week 6, there was no difference in renal function, as assessed by animal survival, BUN, urea and inulin clearances, proteinuria, renal morphometry, or renal size, between EGF- and vehicle-treated rats. This suggests that chronic renal insufficiency differs from acute tubular injury in its sensitivity to exogenous EGF. Unexpectedly, EGF significantly attenuated the rise in systolic blood pressure that occurred by the fourth week after 5/6 nephrectomy. The antihypertensive effect of EGFwas still evident at week 5. Urinary flow rate, free water clearance, and excretion of total solutes, Na�, and K�, however, were not significantly altered by EGF at weeks 2, 4, 5, or 6, suggesting a mechanism other than increased natriuresis or diuresis for this antihypertensive effect.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Effect of Epidermal Growth Factor in the Rat /o Renal Ablation Model1","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Little is known, however, about the forms of out-of-class English studies in which successful English learners in Taiwan engage with the reasons for these particular choices being especially unclear. To address this gap, this project considered the out-of-class English learning choices of 79 university English majors in Taiwan. Findings based upon ethnographic interviews with these individuals indicate that they believed out-of-class English practice to be important due to the limitations associated with their formal language study. Despite this impetus, their choices of settings and interlocutors for English practice were constrained by beliefs about language circulating in the society, in particular social censure associated with English use in public places and with other Taiwanese. As a result, they tended to practice English in online venues, within the confines of the home, with like-minded peers, and with those perceived as foreigners. These results extend our understanding of out-of-class English study by addressing it as a socially-situated phenomenon, foregrounding the sorts of constraints that even highly-motivated language learners may face in their efforts to build their language proficiency.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://asian-tefl.com/index.php/asiantefl/article/download/25/pdf"],"title":"Understanding the out-of-class English Learning Choices of Students in Taiwan","doi":"10.21462/asiantefl.v2i1.25","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.21462/asiantefl.v2i1.25","venue":""}

The terms and conditions for gaining access to loans indicate moreover a relative equity with regard to the poorest members. The innovatory experience of the CECAMs allow lessons of greater scope to be drawn for rural microfinance.

Cell cycle progression and the terminal point of action of the drug were monitored by flow cytometry. Prospidine was cytostatic for two suspension cultures (Friend leukemia and L1210 cells) at a concentration of 10 mg/ml during the first cell cycle after exposure to the drug. Cells were blocked in G2 at lower concentrations of prospidine (e.g., 1.0 mg/ml) but only after 12--24 hours of continuous exposure, i.e., during the second cell cycle in the presence of drug. Cells could be observed to accumulate in G2 by 24 hours even if prospidine (0.1 mg/ml) was removed after 12 hours. A short incubation with a liver cytosol fraction (30 min) or with cultured cells (12 hr) failed to enhance the potency of the drug. Formation of colonies of the adherent Chinese hamster ovary cell line was inhibited by 50% following 24-hour exposure to 1.1 mg prospidine/ml. Under culture conditions in which cells were blocked in G2, their RNA content increased only slightly, but the incorporation of [5-(3)H]uridine into RNA was suppressed by 15--20%. Incubation of cells with prospidine increased the stability of DNA in situ to acid-induced denaturation, which thus suggested that the drug may interact with cellular DNA.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Effects of prospidine on survival and growth of mammalian cells in culture.","doi":"10.1093/jnci/65.5.993","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1093/jnci%2F65.5.993","venue":"Journal of the National Cancer Institute"}

Standardized urodynamics were performed pre- and postoperatively after 6 weeks, 3, and 6 to 12 months. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels were used to monitor the oncological outcome. Perioperative outcomes encompassed, among others, type of complications after surgery classified to Clavien-Dindo.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe proportion of patients with neurogenic bladder dysfunction was postoperative at 6 weeks, 3, and 6 to 12 months 78.5%, 70%, and 45.5%, respectively. Compared to preoperative urodynamics, follow-ups revealed a statistical significant cleavage of bladder wall compliance until six to twelve months after SLND (34.5 vs 22 mL/cmH2 O, P = 0.044). Referring to the oncological outcome all patients experienced a PSA progression, 10 patients (50%) within 11 weeks after surgery. Overall, four patients (20%) suffered from a postoperative complication after SLND, which comprises Clavien grade I-IIIa.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nTransperitoneal SLND, as a treatment option for patients with nodal recurrence of PCa after RP reveals additional potential pitfalls than previously reported. Urodynamics reveal a significant impact of SLND on postoperative functional bladder dysfunctions. Therefore, informed consent prior to SLND should include the risk of persistent low compliance bladder.","inCitations":["791b9e8b7c6f7cc5045472485a75fa3a00692a53"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"De novo neurogenic bladder dysfunction after salvage lymph node dissection in patients with nodal recurrence of prostate cancer.","doi":"10.1002/nau.23545","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1002/nau.23545","venue":"Neurourology and urodynamics"}

Also to investigate the correlation of the global oil price in the form of Brent Crude oil prices index and Western Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil prices index with ZSE Industrial Index and the ZSE Mining index between 2009 and 2012. A GARCH approach is employed to analyse data from ZSE and Chicago Mercantile Exchange, OPEC and Datastream® Data. Daily data for crude oil prices and Zimbabwe stock exchange indices were collected for the period 2009-2012 and analysed. The variables of the Zimbabwe stock exchange are ZSE Industrial Index; and ZSE Mining index. Variables on Crude oil prices comprised of Western Texas Intermediate (“WTI”) spot prices index; Original Research Article Chiwanza et al.; BJEMT, 6(1): 22-37, 2015; Article no.BJEMT.2015.040 23 and Brent Crude oil spot prices index. Returns of stock on all the four indices were calculated. It was assumed that returns on stocks would mirror stock price movements. Volatility of returns on ZSE industrial index was very low with standard deviations ranging between -.01 to +.01. Volatility of returns on the ZSE Mining index was significant relative to the industrial index with standard between-0.1 to -0.1. Volatility of stock returns on Brent Crude spot price index was very high with standard deviations ranging between -0.6 to +0.6, while stock returns on Western Texas Intermediate (“WTI”) spot prices index displayed high volatility, standard deviations ranged from 0.1 to +0.1. Standard deviation indicates the level of dispersion from the the mean. GARCH coefficients indicated that the mean of stock returns as represented by were generally negative for the two domestic stock indices while the means of global oil stock returns were positive. Parameters ∝ and of the four indices were statistically significant. The coefficients of all the indices were highly significant ranging between 0.6300 to 0.9300 indicating that volatility was persistent in the period under investigation and that volatility was to a large extend driven by the prices and values of the previous time period (past performance).There was a positive correlation between industrial index and Brent crude with a correlation coefficient of 0.505 as well as a positive correlation between the ZSE Industrial index and the WTI oil price index with a coefficient of 0.520. There was a negative correlation coefficient of -0.332 between the Mining index and the global Brent crude oil prices as well as a negative correlation coefficient of -0.201 between Mining index and WTI Crude. The results of the study confirmed the hypothesis that the ZSE stock markets are indeed exposed to significant exogenous risks emanating from rising global crude oil price movements. There are however, moderating factors as the standard deviations on ZSE stock returns are much lower compared to standard deviations of stock returns on the global oil indices. Also the correlation coefficients are on the low side. Increases in crude oil prices have the potential to subdue any favourable factors to share price increases.","inCitations":["e99964e51c1800df8cbd9786f8f44410d8f5bfcc","6e60605505587a075d7ba7c680fe6df97cbd9a07","8e754dd443d871ac8b194fa28d2bba1e3fabb6e9"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Zimbabwe Stock Exchange (“ZSE”)’s Exposure to Global Crude Oil Price Volatility","doi":"10.9734/bjemt/2015/12544","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.9734/bjemt%2F2015%2F12544","venue":""}

The optimal reference trajectory is produced by impedance control, and the impedance parameters are achieved using Q-learning technique, which is implemented based on trajectory tracking errors. The position control with DOB of robot manipulators is implemented to track the virtual desired trajectory, and the DOB is designed to compensate for unknown compounded disturbance function by bounding both tracking error inputs and compounded disturbance inputs in a permitted control region, of which the compounded disturbance function is taken into account of all uncertain terms and external disturbances.

In vitro enzymatic drug degradation studies were carried out with rat nasal washings. Various experimental conditions such as nasal perfusion rate, pH of the perfusion medium and concentrations of absorption enhancers such as sodium deoxycholate, sodium caprate, sodium tauroglycocholate and EDTA were optimized. In vivo studies were carried out for the optimized formulation in rabbits and the pharmacokinetics parameters of nasal solution were compared with marketed nasal solutions. Nasal absorption of sumatriptan succinate was pH dependent. It was found maximum at pH 5.5 and decreased at higher pH values. In in vitro enzymatic degradation studies, no measurable degradation was observed during the first week. The extent of drug absorption was increased by absorption enhancers. Sodium deoxycholate appeared to be more effective for enhancing the nasal absorption of sumatriptan succinate than the other absorption enhancers.

We have raised monoclonal antibodies towards amastigote forms and performed preliminary immunochemical characterization of their reactivities. MAB 1D9, 3G8, 2B7, 3B9, and 4B9 react with carbohydrate epitopes of the parasite major surface glycoprotein--Ssp-4 defined by MAB 2C2 [5]; MAB 4B5 reacts with a noncarbohydrate epitope in all developmental stages of the parasite, and MAB 3B2 also detects a noncarbohydrate epitope preferentially in T. cruzi flagellated forms. Vero cells infected with tissue culture-derived trypomastigotes of clone D11 (G strain) were fixed at different times during the intracellular proliferation of parasites, and processed for immuno-electron microscopy and confocal immunofluorescence with the different monoclonal antibodies. We observed that while the surface distribution of MAB 2C2 and 4B9 epitopes was uniform throughout the cycle, MAB 1D9, 3G8, and 2B7 reacted with cytoplasmic membrane-bound compartments of the amastigotes. MAB 3B9 displayed a unique surface dentate pattern in some amastigotes. MAB 4B5 recognized a curved-shaped structure at the flagellar pocket region in some intracellular amastigotes and localized to the membrane in dividing forms. In intracellular trypomastigotes, MAB 4B5 also displayed a punctate pattern near the flagellar pocket.","inCitations":["28c1f2fcc39d2140fa7f997d391eec2ea17ca694","973f9812387f9eed83c3a94873eb9a1b855fd33c","5c4b99efa6e5829f6fe387667b102195b0836959","a19c64cd0f9946daa99fe68262db1acd4ba6be68","17b6fa80d71b4843b96d57c75f69bb831f441b65","ab864898251e62152382eb5e0aabe471088c0da0","14332aa95caf969342f9afa0d79d6765e43acd97","26763972d8f028a38ee56d9bdaa6c029f74aee10","dc4437aad74c03ac572d8deaf124fcbc672ea60b","ad10815dd1ec4f7b8aa8dbe00e8a87235cee9dd7","f70a7d832dd0b2f46d0fd20a1dd97faf3c1a754a","17f1bb74a33efef8ad5f38c44a159f2b17083fce","95fc647da45f38bdf715b7013a69e7b2a9477b14","bf376c905ad4e8a14ef415926c04c1de395f5ed2","83bccb7dce6603cfd9462a9183bcd373939b169b","665545867ce6580a97ab154630ac6723aa33a533","a8530ef27a53d431e724a4fad1244b994d051b15","0179e48fe32cd45b38f6ffa1ce2ca80a6109a77b","8d7dbfd6f2445877ce308333b9112361cd453339","c4f6f7c54f1ce4fd9d733cdc9393668b0cd7c98d","30dbb1fd3e2f953185e57ca39a2c64e121ee3709","ad3334606a88b09250ec77b37247da7bd8863c3f","c106cf253d080b54fe537cd6f91a824d94340f61","999799d1cad80ffa4868fde778a07903b6d64260","95966c2673c304688e6feeda05e1f6bb00245515"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Distribution of epitopes of Trypanosoma cruzi amastigotes during the intracellular life cycle within mammalian cells.","doi":"10.1111/j.1550-7408.1997.tb05675.x","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1550-7408.1997.tb05675.x","venue":"The Journal of eukaryotic microbiology"}

One can classify these models into two broad types, statistical and time-based. The statistical models can be further split into discrete, continuous and distribution free groups. However, these classifications are not distinct, while the time-based class can be split into time series and frequency-based (spectra), models.

Afin d'optimiser les apports d'intrants aux besoins de la plante, tout en limitant les rejets vers l'environnement, il est necessaire d'ameliorer la comprehension des processus de transfert de matiere dans les substrats au voisinage des racines. Dans cette optique, nous nous sommes tout d'abord attaches a mesurer et a comprendre l'impact des proprietes physiques de deux materiaux organiques modeles (tourbes blondes et ecorces de pin compostees) sur les processus de transfert de matiere, au cours d'un cycle de dessiccation-rehumectation. Cette etude prealable, a permis de proposer un modele de fonctionnement hydrostructural des materiaux organiques. Nous avons pu notamment mettre en evidence que l'hysterese des proprietes de surface des materiaux organiques (variation de la mouillabilite en fonction de l'etat hydrique) pouvait expliquer l'hysterese des caracteristiques hydrique et hydrodynamique de ces milieux poreux. La deformation des materiaux va egalement influencer les proprietes de retention et de transfert d'eau et d'air dans le milieu. Ces modifications, qui se deroulent dans les etats hydriques les plus forts, vont faire intervenir des processus hydrostructuraux differents suivant que l'on s'interesse a la tourbe (deformation elastique totalement reversible) ou aux ecorces (deformation plastique partiellement reversible). Nous avons pu egalement definir des gammes “optimales” de potentiel hydrique ou de teneurs en eau (ou les flux d'eau et d'oxygene dans ces deux substrats sont tres eleves) bien differentes des seuils empiriques de -1 kPa et -10 kPa, encore aujourd'hui utilises pour la gestion de l'irrigation dans les cultures en pots et conteneurs. Afin de representer l'effet des proprietes prealablement definies sur les biodisponibilites en eau et en oxygene reliees aux besoins de la plante, nous avons ensuite integre ces proprietes dans un modele monodimensionnel de transfert couples d'eau et d'oxygene au voisinage des racines (fonction puits racinaire) et a l'echelle journaliere. Cette approche modelisatrice a permis de mettre en evidence qu'il etait difficile de reunir sur une journee de culture, et sur une gamme apparemment optimale de potentiel hydrique, en meme temps des conditions de teneurs en eau et en oxygene non limitantes pour la racine.

Computerized neurocognitive testing has been shown to be appropriately sensitive and specific in diagnosing concussions, but no studies have assessed its utility to predict length of recovery. Determining prognosis during subacute recovery after sports concussion will help clinicians more confidently address return-to-play and academic decisions. Purpose: To quantify the prognostic ability of computerized neurocognitive testing in combination with symptoms during the subacute recovery phase from sports-related concussion. Study Design: Cohort study (prognosis); Level of evidence, 2. Methods: In sum, 108 male high school football athletes completed a computer-based neurocognitive test battery within 2.23 days of injury and were followed until returned to play as set by international guidelines. Athletes were grouped into protracted recovery (>14 days; n = 50) or short-recovery (≤14 days; n = 58). Separate discriminant function analyses were performed using total symptom score on Post-Concussion Symptom Scale, symptom clusters (migraine, cognitive, sleep, neuropsychiatric), and Immediate Postconcussion Assessment and Cognitive Testing neurocognitive scores (verbal memory, visual memory, reaction time, processing speed). Results: Multiple discriminant function analyses revealed that the combination of 4 symptom clusters and 4 neurocognitive composite scores had the highest sensitivity (65.22%), specificity (80.36%), positive predictive value (73.17%), and negative predictive value (73.80%) in predicting protracted recovery. Discriminant function analyses of total symptoms on the Post-Concussion Symptom Scale alone had a sensitivity of 40.81%; specificity, 79.31%; positive predictive value, 62.50%; and negative predictive value, 61.33%. The 4 symptom clusters alone discriminant function analyses had a sensitivity of 46.94%; specificity, 77.20%; positive predictive value, 63.90%; and negative predictive value, 62.86%. Discriminant function analyses of the 4 computerized neurocognitive scores alone had a sensitivity of 53.20%; specificity, 75.44%; positive predictive value, 64.10%; and negative predictive value, 66.15%. Conclusion: The use of computerized neurocognitive testing in conjunction with symptom clusters results improves sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of predicting protracted recovery compared with each used alone. There is also a net increase in sensitivity of 24.41% when using neurocognitive testing and symptom clusters together compared with using total symptoms on Post-Concussion Symptom Scale alone.","inCitations":["44b08a7277d975b14614aede935b48a29ab6ab45","e4edd34c5f74b89190f4906227af62f945607cf7","b62800336321e526a5d98bf2f2ffb876b4a26afe","b157cdd0d80d298e3611b26224509699e54c82a1","7e698726f3055e6487a048fdfd985826674fd6e0","abcac1fced2e6e32eec230b31b08641804908ad0","2cb624162e310fe3c5d1addd9fa1dbd5396ce3c9","921752c8ec20338a9ed8c5a78e5ac055ff5e4eda","ef58a1879a2c7e535cb8f740eccf9c04e5b76776","06c1ac22d536a053d0ee3ea24c4e2c58a30e4c57","b6d8b3999f7bb31f0f7e2471b70a9954afc66917","1bc386aee98bee1f7cbf1f6deb0866a5a5b9434e","59062a5fd0e0c9dcc705196f6737cea3c8f81d1e","2f5d77c28ece2c6ab9b275a6d33a68312764da66","499d6344fe2b86a43e8d12b20873466baee5f60d","fd8633ed6dc967ccfc78e05e6ad334745d1ab948","d6e3d5397bec0dadfdf9ed7ecdc966e4708ed0a0","f3a6fe0a600e2a42545b63e461009c150488c141","cc7e75fefbbfc8da7ece78ec56388d2696f14fea","ed3695b791d1265e2883b447098f46417886e918","b79708ec2033bd4a0a39b10a32b64c58c02211c5","f1cf3347076a78a75d71bd0049697d0313112001","ed45be7d344aacc067b38f96393aa577c0dbaa86","ac8b7ca0887f72dfa056e8dc57d4aac6004a83fc","c0637530abf7a0e4924d54f0abeb0a9b043d54ca","f404d98c9d9610797e85f17ad2f4daee0ceacc7c","8718f356a1ae176931f329ebddf7876f791bb8af","94feb5b5f372f8f39442914f2d33d4c490844aa7","c48bd9076a7dfecdccb1148705febc0b8ab7d608","679694f7aafc2faf5bb8798fd400e5fb61f7f654","702a3405389f01413b7a827415ee410b04df52a0","a82e2da3b2145213a834cfce108519538b9fed2e","ec25536933ea5ee1c32c2b00c1cd2d61849f76c3","f398c2e773b64f1019d3ccce685d39796ebc708b","f3f64ff07e3a442609884d51d0416346a209d5ce","9164ce39e9d3274a217c7f957cb9a6c284af3f0d","b7d3291975ac91ba1c81a66418b5926eec67ced3","7668af248387eb31e730099b2c2c9bc4ac5ea241","356b3d0d7a13bba62298e746239ba3c2e9cfe2fa","482362d22dcf9198ce14ed78ad0078608874c675","e7e67d101c5a26f71324d67a78bd4b90d3ac4377","7911493b7dc02065438c08a91844716586871b95","9185fd0924285ca30808cf072bad97515775d5f4","f7e7e3cfff2f7fbdfc009ce7e4cd01a61f5ca963","19620179dd7bbac6fdef6b92ac9266d327f02498","f66d83982df454cad837b1787491483557ffd274","979de2a15d5a2c2866cadc1f9ec89bfbc80b8c6e","cbbf051be90f044730a1b781d816b4eb0d3a8b9f","707f25c9cbb964c0085216c0bbc0644784b206bd","def5588ae6303de389c14bffe7b719a8d488f9a1","4d155f7916092074b7733151039ac7f58852fe7d","04abc76d7f24e2bd0535386824f7ba97dc3bdd68","d18d6c7ace0123f99bad03fab1abe09b268f1e3b","dd492ae5ade47f4bcff741c18f194fb998702d02","1959a31eac02b4a4b23649c8b911faffab683220","607cffdc67c6b778bdf39add9c0ede45c2506806","342a53103ed172259735cdc904df411488f9fbb3","f8241f02340b0f4c43ccaa5857a61e3444039222","f8be4f1f57ec9ad8f379a9f64cafbcd325bc8a59","866ecfd90009801227b90d5bc0a39a1eda619a92","de0b6d856b818f3287a52303d48699cea01b2587","42d471881f3f61b529cdb10a2a4973a01d5e638c","9dee491cd11cc3d1446d135d2d446cbc4ba77b78","88291c0c03f466eb6f7a657e58f64bee390d1ddd","c069e2403df2bda9601047e55461ec8c77bee94b","72f5f68bd8834c415f1eb1150a467feab44f70de","df1e5a217347e15bcd0a7bc8a3d660568d46e57c","56cfa7ae16ab4a0dbd04a6ba7a67cf012dc2fbd7","2cbde2b12de96e9204fb94f4b2ce36acf971ab84","84cab34e17f3dd73cb8a82ab64ff77271b2d994a","0dcd423d0575e4c45924945616dce13f6c79fba8","e5d7f5581e3cae6ca378e1f14b3fe263022fb7ed","a0701b44a3a271b7b1e9b40309f8ef795fc0dce0","48782930983a44cbfeca9aa9537514391f1b56a1","b1e0ee2b6b69a4ab0777d3c3b8dc52ead218a8a8","413a21be5590445c48924df5a0e7196de2b50309","776b32cc7b7b10ec8734cf3787ac637a0b1f0493","4b70378a071a33afac3cc40db8299a033b7cc3d6","7c151eeb61892a08a5b49e73fd3002cc94599ebd","a2cfcf5bd54a41edea4eac01e9cb4827c9b15990","ec078c61c41d5fc3d97c312dbecc83d3f64bab09","6c41707ec24b9e1c4ea1154fb17a7c3c96f073ad","ef24cd7c85760e0fb48db8e18e2575e92bf3f526","64adc0a32291f579634d05ee827fd52f4bf03354","5629078e9a3068b9b1ef5206b2eb777966a30399","fe894557763743383de3263249b1aa95dd0ff2ec","3771f412f76ca51cc5d71b20b127b529ac1732f5","19ac09106922689bd1f986482bcfa3ac6ed60726","57f58c3dfea5e2ac6c0e3a7a28df40e49efc3b92","52ceea0b5705fb9d6981ede1347677fd4bbcd85c","633f9762a0828d8eb141192bdfd3b475a6c12161","36bb6bd4d9b6ea5d5eb609601a1eb40a7568fcb0","c559d281da4ee247fd16247d8bdf5b0e8250ab5c","7f15112bec4634f86de1cbcb0804d6016fcc3e24","12631007c3a4292e5a323bb6c2082fcd2627b3e5","4672148a92380f54438e5a4467a2ad17d89dfd8a","7da4fb20cdc992eec0b95d66d240531d2fe26701","5c5853fa6a932aec6a17edd6bb4336de7a969c5b","646498807ff38625842d351cf1d572bc1f03ceff","250d5d5b45bd3791c88dc3f736740b8d3149be8c","7e126a53919c2162058e0e0b69ce99f740712a96","9bdd620c4cceade936bdb88346e0728b4a22f6e8","8a317816739bb7978f856a67048d254ebc3acbb2","5f802aa0eeeb6b70414f5dce2063e47d51290d85","63f2339da2e7c36bd25f2219886173dd9699f367","4367aae0352e96aa9d8fb3a566ee5f297b0d0123","963746c4d9cb286f86cb26581914424157cc3979","6121d5c2663b6288adab2d6aecba1bf59d198d16","72a522621ce4593d8e131f67e6a2bfeda25b1b05","edeedf790634209ea4a3e2149692c0501f77d763","8ed1152b0492b312b55b8a2243b58a501bbfeafd","bfc96beadec4c481808ff6281d83e3b9b62f0606","937d92c04003e7cb1a60741ee5ab9df814c9854a","b95fbd38e54b439418773b0ea3603a2fcfc4eebb","490c08be09bf24b5288ab50febb0d61b9a2d952d","42bc2b4642f91b2e8b28c69dc998c5d

This procedure is shown to possess several advantages relative to the time- domain synthesis technique. The primary advantage is that the frequency-domain method requires approximately ten times less computer time to synthesize the filter than does the time-domain technique. The details of a direct segment method for the spectral matrix estimation required in the frequency-domain approach are presented. In addition, the bias, variance, mean square error, limiting distribution, and other properties of the spectral estimates are discussed. The details of a Fortran IV computer program implementation of the frequency-domain method are given. The experimental results obtained by processing two events recorded at the Large aperture Seismic Array are presented as well as a comparison of the performance of the frequency-domain method relative to the time-domain synthesis technique. It is found that the processed noise power reduction for the frequency-domain method is typically about two out of a total of 20 db worse than that of the time-domain technique.","inCitations":["2bb6d6b5856857d935845cbad5fd00e1385c9e62"],"pdfUrls":["https://apps.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/634233.pdf"],"title":"A Frequency-domain Synthesis Procedure for Multidimensional Maximum- Likelihood Processing of Seismic Arrays","doi":"10.21236/ad0634233","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.21236/ad0634233","venue":""}

Reactions with unsymmetrically substituted substrates lead to the formation of two distinct isomeric adducts, whose relative amounts depend on the steric and electronic effects exerted by the substituents. With compounds bearing a substituent in position 5, the amount of each individual isomeric adduct appears to be directly related to the extent of its resonance stabilization. Substituents in position 4 can be divided into two classes: those exerting only steric effects (Me, Cl) direct the additional to the less hindered nitrogen, while substituents like MeO and, a lesser extent, CN favour radical attack on the closer. although more hindered nitrogen. Upon increase in the temperature a reversal of the relative stability of the two species is sometimes observed.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Regioselectivity of the addition of Group IVB organometallic radicals to substituted benzo[2,1,3]thiadiazoles.

For this purpose, 306 cyclists were interviewed through a revealed questionnaire survey and 64% revealed that they had experienced a conflict with a pedestrian whereas 55% revealed that they had experienced a conflict with a car. From the responses, two linear regression models were developed, with the perceived responsibility considered as the dependent variable. The cycling–pedestrian model indicated that cyclists who also have car accessibility, tend to blame primarily the pedestrians for the incidents, compared to cyclists who do not possess a car. Further, cyclists tend to give less responsibility to pedestrians for incidents occurred at sidewalks, crosswalks, etc. compare to incidents occurred at shared use paths. In addition, cyclists do not blame pedestrians for conflicts occurred primarily at sidewalks and crosswalks; places were pedestrians are considered to have the priority. Finally, cyclists aged between 55 and 64 years old, are giving less responsibility to pedestrians for the incident, compare to cyclists aged between 25 and 39 years old. On the other hand, the cycling–car model showed that an illegal cyclist’s movement at a road segment can reduce by half the responsibility the cyclists give to the car drivers, compare to the responsibility they give when the latter have an aggressive driving behavior. It was also found that cyclists, who tend to cycle less than 1 h, do not blame so much the car drivers for the incident, compared to cyclists that cycle for longer. Finally, cyclists who prefer the bicycle lane to be located along the road instead at the sidewalk, tend to accuse less the drivers for the incident.","inCitations":["da5471c9851f0d1f07a7280c088a560a1f815242","92b6e8b897cec803f90d98d44f83c5be7966c0fd"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"“Put the blame on…others!”: The battle of cyclists against pedestrians and car drivers at the urban environment.

Looking for analogues of climate warming and biotic response, we previously reconstructed vegetation and climate in the most continental and climatically most stable part of the terrestrial Eurasian Arctic during warm extremes of the Eemian and Early Holocene interglacials and during the Mid Weichselian interstadial in contrast to the Late Holocene (Kienast et al. 2005, Kienast et al. submitted). Our reconstructions base on plant macrofossils preserved in East Siberian permafrost deposits.Accordingly, all warm phases except for the Late Holocene show similar vegetation patterns supporting a mosaic of several plant communities including boreal aquatics, floodplain meadows with halophytes and steppes at times supplemented by shrubs and wetlands. During the Late Holocene in contrast, the fossil species spectra indicate a dramatic decrease in diversity of vegetation types and available habitats (Kienast 2006). From about 5000 years BP on, the species spectra consist almost exclusively of wetland plants reflecting permanently wet conditions and low summer temperature. This event coincides with a global temperature decrease and with the establishment of the modern coast line in the Laptev Shelf region (Bauch et al. 2001) resulting in humidification of Arctic East Siberia.The described differences and, in particular, the analogy of climate and vegetation during the Eemian and the pre-transgression stage of the Early Holocene indicate that the Northeast Siberian shelves have been during former warm stages, including the Eemian, much less inundated than now resulting in higher continental climate. Accordingly, the oceanic influence on climate due to the vast Holocene marine transgression in North Siberia is a very young phenomenon and probably the result of tectonic extension and subsidence of the Laptev and the western East Siberian Shelves.To highlight differences between both warm stages and to reveal consequences of the assumed coast line shift, we proposed a new project at the German Research Foundation (DFG). As a part of that project, we intend to reconstruct the Eemian and Holocene thermal optima in the Northeast Siberian shelf region more in detail, both quantitatively and qualitatively. Simultaneous to these reconstructions, a coupled ocean-atmosphere general circulation model (ECHO-G) will be used within that project to explain responsible mechanisms, global and regional, resulting in climatic differences. Climate patterns, formerly simulated with that model, were, e.g. in Europe, in good agreement with reconstructions (Kaspar et al., 2005). In adjusting the models set-up, it is to be clarified whether the climatic differences between both warm stages can be explained by global insolation changes alone or if internal climate parameters such as the supposed alteration of the land-sea mask in the study region amplified the external insolation effect.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Does the current warming in the East Siberian Arctic differ from other Late Quaternary warm extremes","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}
