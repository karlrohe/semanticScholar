Torroella le plantea a su corresponsal el caso de dos mujeres casadas, enamoradas de hombres que no son sus maridos, las cuales se ven igualmente incapaces de satisfacer sus deseos, y le pregunta: ?cual de ellas sufre mas: la que se ve impedida por circunstancias externas o la que se autocontrola? A partir de esta cuestion el intercambio de cartas desarrolla una teoria del amor, insolita en el contexto hispanico por centrarse en la hipotetica experiencia amorosa femenina. El intercambio, inspirado en un capitulo de Il filocolo de Boccaccio con un planteamiento amoral que se muestra como problematico para Torroella, se va convirtiendo en una critica mutua del estilo prosistico empleado y cuestiona la utilidad de la teoria amorosa ausiasmarquiana de base moral.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Mujeres enamoradas: un epistolario de Pere Torroella y Pedro d'Urrea","doi":"10.1179/174582006X150939","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1179/174582006X150939","venue":""}

O oleo essencial de Capim-Limao, conhecido internacionalmente como oleo essencial “lemongrass” e de nome cientifico “Cymbopongo Citratus” e um dos mais importantes oleos essenciais em nivel comercial e e caracterizado pelo alto conteudo de Citral. O presente trabalho apresenta a utilizacao do processo de Destilacao Molecular para concentrar o Citral o qual constitui um material bioativo oriundo do Capim-Limao, uma vez que a Destilacao Molecular possibilita a obtencao e purificacao de materiais instaveis termicamente. \nObjetivou-se analisar a influencia das variaveis do processo de Destilacao Molecular (temperatura do evaporador (TEV) e vazao de alimentacao (Q)), sobre a variavel Concentracao de Citral nas correntes do processo (destilado e residuo). Foram realizados Planejamentos de Experimentos Fatoriais, partindo de um planejamento 22 \nem replicada, numa faixa de temperatura 60 °C - 80 °C, estendido a um planejamento 22 com repeticoes no ponto central, numa faixa de temperatura 60 °C - 120 °C. A Concentracao de Citral foi analisada por Cromatografia Gasosa acoplada a Espectrometria de Massas (CG-EM). Torna-se, tambem, de suma importância a comprovacao da qualidade dos materiais extraidos. Para isso, caracterizacoes fisico-quimicas (acidos graxos livres, densidade e caracteristicas cromaticas por meio do sistema CIELAB 1976) foram desenvolvidas. Baseando-se no efeito de cada variavel estudada sobre a variavel dependente, tem-se o indicativo de que a temperatura do evaporador e a vazao de alimentacao influenciam na Concentracao de Citral. Com o aumento da temperatura do evaporador, a concentracao de Citral no destilado aumenta ate 2,048x103 mg Citral/g amostra, quando comparado com a amostra de \noleo essencial inicial, que apresenta uma concentracao de Citral de 9,908x102 mg Citral/g amostra. Atraves da avaliacao fisico-quimica, o oleo essencial obtido na corrente de destilado apresenta propriedades de qualidade aceitaveis pelo mercado comercial constituindo um insumo e/ou materia-prima de origem natural e que apresenta beneficios ao homem, o que implica em melhora no produto final promovendo um diferencial competitivo. \n \nAbstract","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://repositorio.unicamp.br/jspui/bitstream/REPOSIP/266246/1/PlazasTovar_Laura_M.pdf"],"title":"Purificação do oleo essencial de \"Cymbopogon Citratus\" para a concentração de citral utilizando a destilação molecular","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

The use of CuCl2 instead of CuI resulted in a significant improvement in the original Chen's methodology; specifically, catalytic amounts (10 to 15%) of CuCl2 were used instead of Cu(I) salts for the generation of CuCF3 species. The improved trifluoromethylation converts aryl and heteroaryl iodides into the corresponding CF3-containing molecules with multiple functional groups in moderate to high yields. Moreover, a mechanism was proposed for this new catalytic system.","inCitations":["0a3e563ac015bf5cf7789d7d0ca6f7aa9c03ff45"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Copper(II)-catalyzed trifluoromethylation of iodoarenes using Chen's reagent","doi":"10.1039/C8QO00025E","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1039/C8QO00025E","venue":""}

RESULTS: Under light microscope, hepatocyte edema, spotty necrosis, infiltration of lympha- cytes and mononuclear cells in portal region were observed in the transplanted livers of both cases. Immunohistochemistry showed mixture of CD3-and CD20-positive cells and different degrees of linear or granular depositions of IgG, IgM, IgA, C4c, C4d and C1q in the liver sinusoidal endo- thelial cells. One of the cases was diagnosed with light acute cellular rejection accompanied by light humoral rejection, and the other was diagnosed with light liver preservation and reperfusion in- jury accompanied by light humoral rejection.

Although the RNA-binding protein Lin28a plays a crucial role in the regulation of developmental timing in C. elegans, how the timing of Lin28a expression affects the rate and/or duration of developmental events during mammalian development remains to be addressed.\n\n\nRESULTS\nIn this study, we discovered that the timing and duration of Lin28a expression affect embryonic growth. During the neurulation stage of mouse development, endogenous Lin28a levels start to drop. When Lin28a expression was maintained transiently using the Tet-ON system [doxycycline-inducible Lin28a transgenic (iLin28a Tg) mice] with doxycycline administration at E8.5 and E9.5, it resulted in neonatal lethality, increased body weight (organomegaly), and an increased number of caudal vertebrae at birth. On the other hand, Lin28a induction only at E8.5 caused neonatal lethality and organomegaly, but did not affect the caudal vertebra number. Of note, although doxycycline treatment before or after neurulation still caused neonatal lethality, it did not cause organomegaly nor the increased caudal vertebra number in iLin28a Tg neonates.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nTemporal regulation of Lin28a expression during neurulation affects developmental events such as cessation of axial elongation and embryonic growth in mice.

The study area is a known B. malayi endemic area. All study cats received doxycycline treatment doses by their respective owners according to a previously described protocol. Briefly, doxycycline (VibraVet@) was given orally once a day during weeks 1-4, 10-11, and 16-17. Blood collections were performed at baseline before treatment, and then every month for 12 months after the initial dose of doxycycline to assess microfilaraemia by Giemsa stain, and filarial DNA detection by high-resolution melt (HRM) real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR).\n\n\nRESULTS\nOne month after the start of doxycycline treatment, five of eight cats were negative for microfilaraemia, and 4 of those were negative for filarial DNA. All cats receiving doxycycline treatment were negative for microfilaria by Giemsa stain, and for filarial DNA by HRM real-time PCR within 8 months after receiving the initial dose of doxycycline treatment.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nAdministration of oral doxycycline to domestic cats naturally infected with B. malayi in disease endemic areas can significantly reduce microfilaraemia at 1 month and filarial DNA was undetectable by 8 months after the initial dose of doxycycline treatment. No recurrence of microfilaraemia or filarial DNA was observed in study cats at 1 year after the start of doxycycline. Included cats appeared to tolerate doxycycline (VibraVet@) well, with no adverse drug reactions reported by any study cat owner.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Therapeutic efficacy of doxycycline in domestic cats naturally infected with Brugia malayi in field condition.","doi":"10.1016/j.exppara.2019.03.016","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.exppara.2019.03.016","venue":"Experimental parasitology"}

Similar studies have not been carried out previously. The considered reactor is multi-tubular with a methanol productivity of 2061 ton/day. Comparing the results obtained by mathematical models with experimental data, it is evident that only the Vanden Bussche and Froment kinetic model describes the methanol industrial reactor better. Also, it results that for all kinetic models, the effectiveness factor is equal to 1: for industrial reactors at high pressure and low temperature limitation phenomena are not present (the calculated Weis-Prater parameter is equal to 0.03). A sensitivity analysis is developed to analyze the effect of recycling ratio, global heat exchange coefficient, temperature, pressure, tube diameter on carbon conversion and specific heat flux. By increasing the recycling ratio and temperature, carbon conversion decreases, while by increasing all parameters, excluding the recycling ratio, the exchanged heat decreases. Different feeds are also analyzed: coke oven gas allows the highest methanol production, while flue gas and hydrogen from water electrolysis ensure the lowest productivity.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Mathematical modeling of a methanol reactor by using different kinetic models","doi":"10.1016/j.jiec.2020.01.033","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jiec.2020.01.033","venue":""}

The optimal O2/SO2 dual-doped porous carbon exhibited far greater Hg0 adsorption capacity than a commercial brominated activated carbon. Density functional theory was employed to understand the Hg0 adsorption mechanism at the molecular level. CO, C-S and C-SOx (x = 1-3) groups enhanced the interaction of Hg0 with surface carbon atom.

Investigation of suspected anaphylactic reactions related to anaesthesia is important to try and identify a likely trigger for a reaction and to help prevent further exposure and potential harm.","inCitations":["57a29d1df97d94c24d4b9162d789ee00637b1268","dbbda4ef080ba58dc6688d822835603862debf2e","37163afd4a16ede07ea2b3bbae7e9000cf774f03","ec053697ad1eb7f4ef2c7a99a2fbc945a6bde160","b0a8c28dff98692c372846d5ffeea25dee1ccd96","5ec1ea71b716fb9dd77eacbafb7aadeabd545851","2503dbe57083595895e0d0986c5bc54ad6da60c4","0325aa4d540635db3275e84898e083990640fa52","caad7d41f810c015c9286faacf548e9afcab0577","fc136be9b14b7f4ea00dca058392e9259e352e1f","a0cf1b89ca69f6afa3bdb25221aa1c82d818a742","b2ac1a40cda1b2183bc723e966a89deaa86955f5","5260aaeaffa8cb4c76d785fbb762240f12a07d3f","19d8d72604dc4900860dac9534314a580d4c0080","f8278ecdde984ad22eccdcdc91e348f3466c9aeb","7980b22406c7c1529797d936914d7d0ffd0fb198","040a167fae90cb0950ce8a9e6c0e2f739946cb58","c6923a4bdd9e0a8f6514aabc3e85d04de3b8e027","0672a8961cf5892a9c6ff9dec16e9cbf17ecbca7","e8cd8357cb9598f2afe6808e9ba354b8ea5ec6f5","404d16554377a9b38d1bebb8d8938018f89e63b3","16747aa1aafed7e1564140a9256c6f0a8da644bc","8a275eee6334a0e2b914d6338cdeda35850b382c","a19205e728489024e6074d39e238f790ab12b840","4c2c905def6df874a00b9958d7f2667c83e7a0ac","4ab617fa9eabbc663ad9e5c38652440c93da1901","a24dacf771170e2d18c935a6e8bf5002b365b7dc","25022d4f589a9a342d80b1146afc3b2e6cce45db","8f0832a2a8d798def775d269b985edbe49ba7f60","654c315b73a1b525caa83975ec0087c052dc59e2","1c79090e723f7c7888aebc66d3825be70c9d31d8","ca475eaee299a6d3a098e63a9490ed2b9cf90940","e8451076db61a174a95b41961aeff4cf805810ae","b5ac7ed495ad6669b420f3222488fe4c93e7c01d","fab908ad4112d0e01c4b299559514d9b9dbf73b4","9c884fd5139254b30b5d4b269e7a996d357afaf9","5ae4f0a60dfb6de8fbeaea7659ee18e534060744"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Anaphylaxis to the chlorhexidine component of Instillagel: a case series.","doi":"10.1093/bja/aen324","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1093/bja%2Faen324","venue":"British journal of anaesthesia"}

Sin embargo, estudios preliminares realizados al 57% del universo empresarial de este sector (no incluye microempresas ni famiempresas), demuestran serias falencias de tipo estructural (tecnologias, procesos, instalaciones) e infraestructural (planificacion de la produccion, sistemas de calidad, etc.) en los sistemas de produccion de estas organizaciones. Mediante esta ponencia se espera divulgar entre la comunidad academica los resultados obtenidos al aplicar una metodologia integral de mejoramiento del sistema de produccion en una empresa piloto del sector. A partir de la definicion y ponderacion de las prioridades competitivas que la empresa debe alcanzar, y siguiendo la metodologia universalmente aceptada en estudios de simulacion discreta se propone un marco de experimentacion para mejorar los niveles alcanzados por el sistema en dichas prioridades empleando tecnicas de bifurcacion secuencial, diseno factorial en experimentacion y superficies de respuesta.

With more services getting breached today, there is still a lack of a quantitative understanding of this risk. In this paper, we perform the first large-scale empirical analysis of password reuse and modification patterns using a ground-truth dataset of 28.8 million users and their 61.5 million passwords in 107 services over 8 years. We find that password reuse and modification is very common (observed on 52% of the users). Sensitive online services such as shopping websites and email services received the most reused and modified passwords. We also observe that users would still reuse the already-leaked passwords for other online services for years after the initial data breach. Finally, to quantify the security risks, we develop a new training-based guessing algorithm. We show that more than 16 million password pairs (including 30% of the modified passwords) can be cracked within just 10 guesses.","inCitations":["a9602e8243e4820b89b3f472dbd1f8b099afe79d","f6590f2466a83854fd234e47d80fa4bd79cd2b13","ae39b798ca68565ee311b40a0afce135257943ad","aa7bd51770afcb8873efd651f31a63f7e878db27","23929c0bc3220849f68c5086503cadab2b079e59","21d0e8c4769ef04de82a0eff78c18f0fdd45d633","ca0fc1d5523ff2b0c488e7e4b6e1913e7a5f0c81","8e1b67e7b5a9686033b0b2c3edcd60c000604046","ce36d5801a5b0ec53c0fc66c7eb523a5d534832a","6bb48307da8469622cb6fa073c5824f227c4c092","ee4c089b4378fbb1fa720559081abbb4842dc182","26aac44b15359ef0f63ae02485882ee1782b929a","1d3d206a8d1fd9de11ccbb16e58e441111f1f138"],"pdfUrls":["http://people.cs.vt.edu/~gangwang/VTthesis_ChunWang.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/3176258.3176332","http://people.cs.vt.edu/~gangwang/pass.pdf","http://people.cs.vt.edu/~tekang/papers/coda2018.pdf","http://people.cs.vt.edu/~hanghu/resume.pdf","https://vtechworks.lib.vt.edu/bitstream/handle/10919/83471/Wang_C_T_2018.pdf"],"title":"The Next Domino to Fall: Empirical Analysis of User Passwords across Online Services","doi":"10.1145/3176258.3176332","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1145/3176258.3176332","venue":"CODASPY '18"}

We use a widely distributed suite of seismic events to illuminate the local crustal volume from different directions and produce an image of the local crust. Stable apparent secondary seismic sources are observed, and interpreted as scatterers excited by the primary events.","inCitations":["ca0c8af1849d9a47d550b0eb68de3534fb7772d7","712daa3c7ffeec5e720ccc497c2c86f8a59865be","1e6cd09a317cfc30e20c4204818188593d6d4ad1","a438c45a7a5e8f62e967fa547521e94d2b6bc371","43993bb7edc3dbcb545f74fb5d29185def440e27","925775d420572e3dd8e2576cd66eb511e4c9bf71"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Beam-Stack Imaging using a small aperture array","doi":"10.1029/91GL02160","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1029/91GL02160","venue":""}

One of the fundamental problems in the information systems practices is the fragility of the users in the acceptance of the system. Although Technology Acceptance Model is highly preferred model concerning the acceptance of information technologies as well as usage, researches prove that there is still a need for the improvement of the model. In this study technology readiness is their reintroduced usage to the model as an antecedent of perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness, whereas satisfaction is considered as a mediator between technology readiness and intention.

Hypoxia is a potent stimulus for the release of adenosine.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe investigated the effects of hypoxia and A2B adenosine receptor signaling on migration, invasion, proteolytic activity of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2, expression of MMP-2 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) mRNA, and production of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) in trophoblast cells (HTR-8/SVneo, BeWo).\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe adenosine A2B receptor agonist 5-N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine (NECA) reduced trophoblast (HTR-8/SVneo and BeWo) migration at 2%, 8% and 21% O2 compared to untreated control cells. A2B adenosine receptor stimulation decreased phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) and stress-activated protein kinase/Jun-amino-terminal kinase (SAPK/JNK) at all three O2 concentrations. ProMMP-2 activity, MMP-2 mRNA levels and hCG levels were markedly decreased after A2B adenosine receptor activation in trophoblast cells. Adenosine receptor A2B stimulation decreased VEGF expression at 2% and 8% O2 but led to increased levels at 21% O2.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThese data indicate A2B receptor activation blunts trophoblast migration possibly as a result of reduced activation of the MAPK signaling pathway and lower proMMP-2 levels.

The new contributions are threefold. First, we propose a constrained Galerkin formulation that corrects the standard Galerkin statement by incorporating prior information about the long-time attractor. For explicit and semi-implicit time discretizations, our statement reads as a constrained quadratic programming problem where the objective function is the Euclidean norm of the error in the reduced Galerkin (algebraic) formulation, while the constraints correspond to bounds for the maximum and minimum value of the coefficients of the $N$-term expansion. Second, we propose an \\emph{a posteriori} error indicator, which corresponds to the dual norm of the residual associated with the time-averaged momentum equation. We demonstrate that the error indicator is highly-correlated with the error in mean flow prediction, and can be efficiently computed through an offline/online strategy. Third, we propose a Greedy algorithm for the construction of an approximation space/procedure valid over a range of parameters; the Greedy is informed by the \\emph{a posteriori} error indicator developed in this paper. We illustrate our approach and we demonstrate its effectiveness by studying the dependence of a two-dimensional turbulent lid-driven cavity flow on the Reynolds number.","inCitations":["eaf3f46289e49b4108945bb51ec617fd0ead6bf6","a98019e3acd94815c4ccbe446d527fdea12e6aa5","6bb7ade81556825d6be964569b59d8fcee409406","68c62fb2f06ca10bf97fbd6403f7f340f0604242","c9de9e7f4c9fa6cf51e34b88f1c86423568e20ea","65818be9857a7a155ac7cebdea11b75efe2d23a2","36849579d95ebd1a937adf9c6e81b0a743405cc2","72cdb08efb415098dcf15dd05bb21f8bdbbb11df","8195d365758f84ae0a500957fa28fda4217b330e","477a603407af7d62dc02a3326352bc9285bbc741","37a739c0181e34648eaf593bda4d02a2b86c9d5f","a0a1799093f6a4ea34d84a4410679b1ddaed434a","776dcf5cea3ad0183e24c83d77523f1f7ed82bc9","96a314886cc380ccd02932ea175aecbaa6aa51d9","444ff805e0a4b851927c949535a88580cb794b4d","7926e424158c64b9ef8c58461296f77340327dc4","0d3cc577cf45930be07ec8981072d6f6f8761145"],"pdfUrls":["http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1710.03569","https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.03569v1.pdf"],"title":"A Reduced Basis Technique for Long-Time Unsteady Turbulent Flows","doi":"10.13140/rg.2.2.14350.87369","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.13140/rg.2.2.14350.87369","venue":""}

A multiple time series design of 2 experimental and 1 control groups was used in 2 communities. The program offered young volunteer promoters psychological counseling recreational and educational activities academic tutoring and selected courses. The target population of 12000 was poor yet with high literacy and near universal schooling at the young ages. 1/3 of youths in the experimental areas were exposed to some program activity with services being generally well-accepted by young adults and their parents. Activities did not however seem to have much effect upon overall knowledge of contraceptive use among these youth at the community level. Having failed to obtain baseline data it was not possible to analyze if significant changes resulted from program activities. While males aged 18-22 were underrepresented they nonetheless proved to be more sexually active than young women and to more frequently use contraceptive methods. Overall the level of sexual activity and demand for contraceptive services among these young adults was found to be quite low. Findings suggest that sex education and family planning services may be provided to youths in a variety of ways with parental and community support. Consideration should be given to developing community youth programs in the future; this approach proved most effective in reaching young adults especially single males at 1/2 the cost of the integrated center.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Final technical report: Integrated Development of Young Adults in the Community: Nuevo Leon Mexico Contract No. CI85.10A Pro-Superacion Familiar Neolonesa A.C.

They also provide a version of social ecology in which the domination of nature is interrelated to intra-human social hierarchy and difference based on gender, race and class amongst other formations. Ecofeminism can be seen as a paradigm for the tracing of interrelations between different formations of domination based on difference. This chapter outlines key strands and themes within ecofeminist thought, and argues for a different framework for ecofeminist theory based on an understanding of complex systems. I suggest that ecofeminism needs to engage more fully with debates on the efficacy of patriarchy, and to be rather more generous toward deep and some socialist ecologies with respect to their analyses of capitalism and anthropocentrism as systemic relations of domination.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Ecofeminism and the Question of Difference","doi":"10.1057/9780230509276_5","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1057/9780230509276_5","venue":""}

Reaksi polimerisasi dilakukan dengan variasi suhu polimerisasi 15, 25, 35, dan 45°C, serta variasi lama pengadukan 15, 30, 45, dan 60 menit. Reaksi polimerisasi dengan variasi suhu polimerisasi dilakukan pada pengadukan 60 menit, sedangkan variasi lama pengadukan dilakukan pada suhu polimerisasi 45°C. Karakterisasi poliuretan hasil sintesis meliputi analisis gugus fungsi dengan teknik spektroskopi FTIR, sifat termal diukur dengan teknik Differential Thermal Analysis (DTA), sifat mekanik dengan alat Tensille Strength, dan uji derajat ikatan silang melalui penentuan derajat penggembungan. \n Hasil penelitian menunjukkan bahwa semakin tinggi suhu polimerisasi, semakin kental cairan poliuretan yang dihasilkan dan proses pembentukan padatan poliuretan semakin cepat dengan meningkatnya lama pengadukan. Kondisi proses optimum untuk menghasilkan poliuretan dengan bentuk lembaran yaitu pada suhu polimerisasi 45°C dengan lama pengadukan 45 dan 60 menit. Poliuretan hasil sintesis pada suhu 45°C dengan lama pengadukan 45 menit mempunyai suhu dekomposisi 495 °C dan suhu transisi gelas 140°C, sedangkan poliuretan dengan lama pengadukan 60 menit mempunyai suhu dekomposisi 500 °C dan suhu transisi gelas 120 °C. Poliuretan hasil sintesis pada kondisi proses optimum bersifat rapuh, sehingga tidak dapat dilakukan uji mekanik berupa kuat putus clan perpanjangan saat putus.

In this study, various pollution abatement measures such as wastewater treatment, flow augmentation, and diversion are explored using simulation models to evolve strategic measures, policies, and guidelines for improving the river water quality. Three cases viz, Case A: existing layout with all 15 drains (D1–D15) discharging; Case B: layout after diversion of the Najafgarh drain (D1); and Case C: layout after diversion of all drains (D2–D15) other than Najafgarh drain are conceptualized. A total of 34 scenarios characterizing different levels of wastewater treatment, flow augmentation, and drain diversion, as standalone and considered in combination are simulated using the QUAL2E water-quality simulation model. Results reveal that tertiary treatment at all the drains (D1–D15) outfall under the existing layout, i.e., Case A, would be the most feasible option, whereas flow augmentation alone is not.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Simulating strategic measures for managing water quality in the Delhi stretch of the River Yamuna, India","doi":"10.1007/s40899-018-0289-6","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s40899-018-0289-6","venue":"Sustainable Water Resources Management"}

It is centrally located between the two important Hindu religious centers of Dwarka and Somnath on the Saurashtra-Kathiawar coast. An onshore archaeological exploration was undertaken in and around Porbandar, in November 2003 in order to locate remains of ancient maritime activities; in the form of anchors, ancient port installations, submerged habitational sites, etc.; similar to those found at Dwarka, Bet Dwarka and Somnath (Gaur et al. 2002, 2003).","inCitations":["7d3315d748067539c0864b5d4e136ec6866f6993","daca060f95cff4d42580960033516a640a27a492","35aa4391d2e6a7bbf7d29a076d68453882022f6f","8cd512df5fdc762062c81dcec85e155f2b4dddee","8a674ff6f97fcac4436288db54ecc3817cf6e8cc"],"pdfUrls":["http://drs.nio.org/drs/bitstream/handle/2264/481/Man_Environ_29_103.pdf;sequence=1"],"title":"New Light on the Maritime Archaeology of Porbandar, Saurashtra Coast, Gujarat","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

As such, impacted teeth are considered nonfunctional, abnormal, and pathological. The mandibular third molar is the most common tooth to become impacted. The cause of impacted third molars is thought to be inadequate space. Several studies indicate that a change from a coarse, attritive diet to a modern, refined diet has lead to an increased incidence of impacted teeth. Interproximal attrition allows for greater mesial migration of teeth and space for third molar teeth. Teeth that fail to attain a functional position may be pathological and should be considered for removal. The indications for removing impacted teeth can be divided into those of acute or chronic pathology. Impacted third molars are often associated with pain, infection, cyst formation, benign tumors, root resorption, bone loss, periodontal disease, and caries. The decision to surgically remove impacted third molars is often unclear. There are no absolute treatment protocols established. The dentist must consider a variety of factors and make an informed decision with the patient. Most experienced clinicians combine objective data and common sense to arrive at a logical treatment plan. The purpose of this article is to discuss factors related to impacted teeth and help the orthodontist understand the general management of impacted third molars. The decision for surgery will be assisted by an understanding of all of the risk factors associated with impacted teeth and presenting the options to the patient.","inCitations":["f1cd81e0c79c0e7219a8272d3caac20a4c867bb7","086d56d24ba3b5f5143bcd4c90471f6622bee98a","d8682f7da17b90f23f6b3094a7ff8ad519a9d8e1","02dbf9fdff05a10b3068a1d35f57bc06829ce701","19ad8b9957b728abd95fe6b6f619d09f7118f938","b685b75e6af1b160d0d04878b4a435bb064086dd","afcca5cd48417996255835e50a549e11eb1c3852","4716058ec6adaf755effcc1d3cd24f0ed9919a41","744f3c6eac9113078e6997091f8e11d6471b00c9","41d3962e769d12b6845ed9c19f5fa970e123aee8","0532a3a85a75f19f6c5d9035a1daa0f3a3e7fc80","1cbcc31ca497d9fe7999332c7fe74da9ce8900ec","cf438e5a3246905b3817aea19f0f04c6b5f51904","bfa48d47e544ee75b9588bfff4d23ec50a75fed1","12cb1b9e6d6408f976963fa9c9d27c9e4df2357c","ca28f761c20000f63c2cb192d2496750363813e5","52c9b985c8e0fde5cdcab07ce2903709c4425363","8bbafdc8a0844afdca03bc95b2dff4d6359feed3","16d16f77c1c71f52c52370b47be0788510fd6b0d","4f06e70672b6d930ad5e8f8e1bacecb278034253","f1e889a563322f773b51462c5e12b26a851a7242","8204bfc8796e4e725cb703b4d913a4fa63152858"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Surgical management of impacted third molars.","doi":"","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"Seminars in orthodontics"}

Additionally, the group method of data handling (GMDH) was used to establish the work performance model. The results indicate that different complexity levels of driving task have a significant effect on the driver’s performance, and the predictive performance model integrates different physiological measures shows the validity of the proposed model is well with R2 = 0.781. The proposed model is expected to provide a reference value of their work performance by giving physiological indices.

Hepadnaviruses are a family of partially double-stranded DNA viruses with liver tropism and a narrow host range of susceptibility to infection. At least in the case of duck hepatitis B virus (DHBV), host specificity seems controlled partly at the receptor level. The middle portion in the pre-S region of the viral large envelope protein binds specifically to duck carboxypeptidase D (DCPD) but not to its human or chicken homologue. Although domain C of DCPD is implicated in ligand binding, the exact pre-S contact site remains to be determined. We prepared and tested a panel of chimeric constructs consisting of DCPD and human carboxypeptidase D (HCPD). Our results indicate that a short region at the N terminus of domain C (residues 920 to 949) is critical to DHBV binding and is a major determinant for the host specificity of DHBV infection. Replacing this region of the DCPD molecule with its human homologue abolished the DHBV interaction, whereas introducing this DCPD sequence into HCPD conferred efficient DHBV binding. Extensive analysis of site-directed mutants revealed that both conserved and nonconserved residues were important for the pre-S interaction. There were primary sequence variations and secondary structural differences that contributed to the inability of HCPD to bind the DHBV pre-S domain.","inCitations":["f81df93a6e617dd6cd65f0a28af3e45e9a6d5e85","476c99b2463c334446b2cd1073b9157dc902431c","5af6d51e848032740fffae107b3779870f035b85","a56ed73129347556b9fd33612e2c32badca0e05e","dda7297d13e22a924aa62b157d47c8072ec55870","a7eecd3bfde1749ee73f114a55cbdc42d1eb510a","21beb940e628d133e25c700a255c9aaec41fd354","2108179aec147f2d6bd65307a657206e4ccad6fe"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"A short sequence within domain C of duck carboxypeptidase D is critical for duck hepatitis B virus binding and determines host specificity.","doi":"10.1128/JVI.75.22.10630-10642.2001","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1128/JVI.75.22.10630-10642.2001","venue":"Journal of virology"}

The frequency of occurring these phenomenons was compared in three groups of pregnants to find the pregnancies with risk of IUGR. Methods: The study covered 207 pregnants hospitalized in Lodz and Kalisz between 2003 and 2006. Patients were divided into three groups. The first group included 68 pregnant women with IUGR in USG who gave birth to the fetuses SGA; the second group consisted of 29 pregnants with IUGR in USG and normal body weight of newborn; the last group was made of 110 pregnancies with normal fetal body mass evaluation by ultrasound and normal body weight of newborn. The statistic methods of evaluation were: test Chi-square of independence or precise Fischer test to compare the frequency of occurring these phenomenons. For all used statistic tests the level of importance was α = 0.05. Results: The result of the study showed that notch in UA was low both in normal pregnancies and pregnancies with transitory low body mass of fetus; but notch in UA was substantially higher in pregnancies who gave birth to the fetuses SGA. In the first group (39.7%) notch occurred significantly more frequent than in the third group (8.4%) and the second group (10.3%) (P < 0.0005). The frequency of notch in UA in the third and the second group was not statistically different. Similarly, values of PI in UA of right and left uterine artery were identically low in pregnancies giving birth the newborn with normal body weight. Values of these indexes were substantially higher in pregnancies who gave birth to the fetuses SGA. Conclusions: The evaluation of notch and PI in both uterine arteries of pregnant women can be useful prognostic parameter of the risk of giving birth the fetuses with hypotrophy features.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"P11.01: Fetal hemodynamic adaptations to maternal chronic low level carbon monoxide exposure","doi":"10.1002/uog.9758","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1002/uog.9758","venue":""}

Ceiling height of each room should be decreased with more than 60-80cm due to the beam. Differently from this condition, glass web beam has a good point to see through it and sunshine can be penetrate into the other size especially when it is installed as of outside wall. And also, it can be safer due to controlling room inside easier, if the strength is applicate. This study is to show some applicability after finding out the properties using the test.
