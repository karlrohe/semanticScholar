Smaller doses of ketamine did not affect whole brain 5-HTP accumulation. However in regional studies, 80 mg/kg of ketamine significantly reduced 5-HTP accumulation in the spinal cord and the midbrain-thalamus. A dose of 160 mg/kg ketamine also reduced 5-HTP accumulation in the spinal cord and midbrain-thalamus and in the medulla-pons, striatum and cortex as well. No significant changes in 5-HTP accumulation were observed in the hypothalamus or hippocampus. Ketamine (160 mg/kg) also reduced whole brain 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) levels and slightly elevated whole brain 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) levels. Smaller doses did not affect either 5-HIAA or 5-HT levels. Ketamine did not affect whole brain tryptophan levels nor did it inhibit [3H]tryptophan uptake or conversion to [3H]5-HT in vitro. These data demonstrate that ketamine reduced both 5-HT synthesis and metabolism in vivo. Since ketamine did not affect brain tryptophan levels nor did it inhibit 5-HT in vitro, the reduction of 5-HT turnover following ketamine administration appears to be a neuronal, adaptive phenomenon possibly occurring in response to a blockade of 5-HT uptake by ketamine.","inCitations":["5af853bbb06faade36d4dbd40c92639f3d3153b1","33fd7d387e13f74e89593901a3a8c33c687dc94f","7fdedb18ee58cd5fff3457193b45ff2c62503989","e1bd4a3e5ee8fa270f93143facfb02256cea5bc5","b343fbae181b77d72d8448f7d5976ac44774d8b3","36ed72bfd56af71fc2968fc1ceeaba1b9030e85b","ae8284c826e73476b5382e3beb448030857baa77","0e6f898843a0fba85d842a4b538f3d5a5b3c06b1","2356f4638eb497e32b3dfa3eb192bf21993d39b5","017423e0f1110544b7b79023fa77c446cb0a5c36","a504c79bb187ddccce7c20d8e709daa73877cf17","27b9df40e49c917e86759396ff689369a04a7b58","0414342cc91ea2a84c1e8d3c9154700ef562d1e6","d1ba26c9f9561647777e7a4f745bc5d0ebeecd77"],"pdfUrls":["https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/0028390882901502","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0028390882901502?dgcid=api_sd_search-api-endpoint"],"title":"Ketamine inhibits serotonin synthesis and metabolism in vivo","doi":"10.1016/0028-3908(82)90150-2","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/0028-3908%2882%2990150-2","venue":"Neuropharmacology"}

Nine of the hormones showed no abnormalities in the patients but four (testosterone, dihydrotestosterone, cortisol, and estrone) showed abnormalities. Testosterone and dihydrotestosterone, which, respectively, decreased with age and showed no change with age in the normal men, rose sharply with age in the patients. The patients' curves crossed the normal curves at about age 65; patients 65 or above showed normal values while patients under age 65 showed significantly subnormal levels of both hormones: testosterone averaged 282 ng/dl in patients vs 434 ng/dl in controls (P less than 0.0001) and dihydrotestosterone averaged 70 ng/dl in patients vs 99 ng/dl in controls (P less than 0.01). Cortisol, which was age invariant in the normal men, fell sharply with age in the patients; patients under 65 had significantly elevated levels (10.1 vs 6.9 micrograms/dl; P less than 0.0001), while patients 65 or older had normal levels. Estrone levels were age invariant in both patients and controls, but the mean level in patients was markedly elevated (81 vs 47 pg/ml in controls; P less than 0.001). The cortisol/testosterone ratio almost completely separated prostate cancer patients under 65 from normal men, but did not discriminate patients 65 or older from normal. The findings indicate that prostate cancer patients under 65 differ markedly in their endogenous hormonal pattern from patients 65 or older. This leads us to propose a \"two-disease\" theory of prostate cancer, with possible differences in genetic factors and prognosis.","inCitations":["3c7935744e00a141e75db6e8b8bf14c90464043c","eab2557c9cf38dd2a4c85f297a1113b98a53524c","5a28a042a62b5add920750689ac2c42ade50ee7a","3048232bd606b0e18f8d566945cac7e2897e0483","055a99b21dcba1ed94038e5f29ebb3ba726183c8","49b511d74e75a92f198cf9356a29b87b49c9701d","e0270a16920356305b7324f21f3407b1cd2a2133","e342e9b8021b1fd5d965cf9e0d1187abf9bb21d6","1449c7bae37e9686c3b9842630849c295598493f","69f97e88fc8ae4aadc0b4096f8a93319a0f5b741","b2ff58a51e4355b92a3065fd386fe33e0a4a1b49","4fc5ebd2d0eb31aefc1ca4dfd54e722d9a2b657b","7efd2e11b8ed8560ff7fe7a8cf74b467b2f5af7f","0328359217c6fdf43d8932d9d3b9c0082eaf94af","f43566e03cbd78f669b1bf147d6747f87b327fc8","e7c69a8f1bbaef8a256613dbc386b85acf7b5c63","0a7cb0c1b410d0aba4f0e030c5a2fd12f7e4d041","d121696be1a22a0708601d3f531c641e6a863f15","30e16d0cfd48e9788b581dc6c8fb4090f403ed8b","74b6c9282899afaec8d134df1de4d3bee15c716c","d32cdceae2e7c1846b548ae83444ade0a558261b","9b36675889335921641336fe2698be00cf2f143a","8fb6f0d30294d9dd1fb515d55997c85756aa0d96","72baa46bfdf31885d166e00d5e8d30ab474aa528","a9ea79164170c142fcde4f794a5799817b31e480","11c7d1d499d135de98ce5d7ae0c413a0d605b2da","995c369797d35debe2e3dde91c072f5788bc47d5","904c3156bd27ece9c71b80703b508eef393aa725"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Abnormal levels of plasma hormones in men with prostate cancer: evidence toward a \"two-disease\" theory.","doi":"10.1002/pros.2990030607","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1002/pros.2990030607","venue":"The Prostate"}

This class consists of recombinant monoclonal antibodies, which can be chimeric, humanized or human. Predictably, there has been a rise in adverse hypersensitivity reactions to these therapeutic agents, whose pathogenic mechanisms are not yet well understood. Specific IgE has been demonstrated in a very few cases, and only in some of these recombinant antibodies. Skin tests are not done as a clinical routine screening. In the present article the mechanisms underlying hypersensitivity reactions to these drugs are analyzed, also in the light of the personal experience and that reported in the literature, with the aim of identifying potential risk factors and means of prevention of these reactions. For some drugs, infusion reactions may be prevented thanks to the the use of premedication. Moreover, symptoms of acute hypersensitivity during infusion can be successfully managed in the majority of cases by slowing the speed of administration. All these findings seem to confirm that the pathogenesis is not related to a true immediate (IgE-mediated) hypersensitivity in most cases. When the substitution of the drug that has triggered a hypersensitivity reaction is required, this is only possible if such an alternative drug exists (i.e., replacement of a chimeric antibody with a humanized or human antibody sharing the same target). As an alternative, desensitization protocols have been employed to induce a state of temporary tolerance to the drug in some cases, yielding successful results for infliximab and trastuzumab.","inCitations":["df29c94adc67f96c287a86e520dfe2b999fe627c","18eca3ff7d17b85bcab85ff705fdbcb392a34a26","ae9facb1f698201bced56c498825e551b772b554","2d3fe1a5e151bce8ba16ea26e1cdd6c044a99b5c","2a0359f748faef416a2ada757fe9661ab1f81711"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Hypersensitivity Reactions to Last Generation Chimeric, Umanized and Human Recombinant Monoclonal Antibodies for Therapeutic Use","doi":"10.2174/138161208786369786","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.2174/138161208786369786","venue":""}

Although Ochrotomys was once considered a subgenus of Peromyscus, it shares few apparent G-band homologies with any peromyscine. The presumed homologous karyotypic elements shared between Ochrotomys and other peromyscine genera also are shared with Neotoma (the probable sister group of peromyscines) and these elements are hypothesized to be primitive for the group. The largest autosome in Ochrotomys appears to be shared with a distantly related species, Sigmodon hispidus, and this chromosome might be represented as two acrocentric autosomes (tandem fission products) in peromyscines and Neotoma. If this hypothesis is correct, the peromyscines as currently recognized likely are polyphyletic. The unusually extensive rearrangement of the Ochrotomys karyotype relative to peromyscines appears to represent a case of karyotypic megaevolution.","inCitations":["be3bff6f6a10fe9699f459eccdbc938743f06a7a","5b4c380a654fe098e297ce96033b26d59fc0a21d","cca94fc87f6575f091fce6d79ecd4f96bdd88cf0","69fd5575c489334bcce0a41a581bc9ddd52427bd"],"pdfUrls":["https://page-one.springer.com/pdf/preview/10.1007/BF00133295"],"title":"Chromosome banding and phylogenetics of the golden mouse, Ochrotomys nuttalli","doi":"10.1007/BF00133295","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/BF00133295","venue":"Genetica"}

Aim of the present study is to evaluate the in vitro antitrichomonal properties of plant extracts of Quercus (Q.) infectoria, Pistacia (P.) khinjuk, and Satureja (S.) khouzestanica that are ethno-medicinally used in Iran against T. vaginalis trophozoites. In this study, the in vitro anti-T. vaginalis activities of the Q. infectoria, P. khinjuk, and S. khouzestanica extracts against T. vaginalis clinical isolates were assessed by Trypan Blue exclusion assay. The effect of the extracts on induced apoptosis in T. vaginalis trophozoites was evaluated using the fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) Annexin V staining kit. The Q. infectoria methanolic extract was significantly (P<0.001) more effective than the other tested extracts. It demonstrated lower IC50 values for trophozoite of T. vaginalis. Q. infectoria methanolic extract exhibited significantly (P<0.001) a higher rate of apoptosis on T. vaginalis trophozoite than other tested extracts and control group. Results of the study revealed that Q. infectoria extract can be considered as a suitable choice for medical studies to treat trichomoniasis. However, additional clinical studies are necessary to evaluate accurate biological effects of this plant on volunteer human subjects.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://msptm.org/files/Vol35No2/347-353-Badparva-E.pdf"],"title":"Anti-Trichomonas vaginalis activities and apoptotic effects of some Iranian medicinal plants","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

The capacity of omega-3 PUFAs to modulate synthesis of eicosanoids, activity of nuclear receptor and nuclear transcription factors, and production of resolvins may also mitigate inflammatory processes already present. Parenteral infusion of omega-3 PUFAs is advantageous, particularly in severely ill patients, because the fatty acids are rapidly incorporated by cells. In addition, when fatty acids are given parenterally, there are no losses from digestion and absorption as there are with enteral infusion. Recently, lipid emulsions enriched with omega-3 fish oil have been introduced as a component of parenteral nutrition. Currently, there is one lipid emulsion that contains only fish oil; it is infused together with conventionally used lipid emulsions. Other commercially available lipid emulsions contain fish oil in a fat mixture; one contains 10% fish oil and another 15% fish oil. Relevant experimental and clinical data from studies evaluating fish oil lipid emulsions are discussed in the present review. Administration of fish oil lipid emulsion, when compared with soybean oil lipid emulsion (rich in omega-6 PUFA), decreases the length of hospital and intensive care unit stay in surgical patients.","inCitations":["fc8c7f6d6073dba32bc30f0f8048f472b882c130","91541570287998eba4c444ccbed56f8e34f9b14a","e58922ac194b44fabbfd944ee0584b77bdcffe97","547223898968f7a1efc974ffc65cfb4f2eaa9e83","e43e606c16b579ca8facde082cda8123a840e174","60af0d379c633d1387597f6a41efc7fa7b8b8327","eb83ffff6785524b558c0daa432bba68a99bfaf1","92a0aa3eb8b709ba65890ad8593f46b1ac6d370f","31acb42941240e6255a5693308cd0efecc4d5e54","71a286ee3ff4610490cac78c6af152eb79aea47d","25dfcc39beff8ea4d73cd34c6920f903782a738a","edc4345bc50cef6c11a392ab8189667f370f656a","fa11c5f5bfc900a1c3c0e14083922f8d7b766212","28c225511fdaf12ad929ebccfeeef23f725068bd","af0140a29f316a597eb27b9ffc2a3d4165bff7a8","ea82908cb7214b7288f27ab61fcc9042864d31e8","655c7ad2309af30921b0b616e8b7e40060260332","582afba8a9d83036bec8ab0d9bf9167c6ef7664f","bd0955827fa4a8b36daa2c681e6b3152f50bb144","82f106764ea2612086b94d2c79f746f43e5d24a0","230f3a721d5b7b81ea06518db44090ccd2eabd80","bbce329009dc3f10a7467e7ab9d4dd9d24145118","673cbd9099858a911232ab06dff235e528597757","65149f8cda39db23da86b62b74dcab97adac45cf","9227ca024b1cdbe9d3eba927f49f652e86b42119","4c6c002591ea99c7e34b6932e78b204be82a1d57","a1349978f387b237a499c7aee07cef033e3c5c2a","4267e2494409c95f5b32bd3fe387a2dafd2a7b81","c432a21f29f32bc057035299df864426aa3dcb39","ad6053a80a12af759795dfe8916af658fe74f9ac","b2beef0972877597e5266e5450fa61e782323b2e","7100838905e2514faa8874bcbdf70c9cc6ee64cc","0d7754625721aaa2002d4453c627ef0e8d11b224","dbeac717ced6f4c0e6ee24f68cf36608191b9d0f","4d47dc7489544ae23e5441c1196a9cd28a1e40c4","a4349b1f751e897adca1873375ef8e4a2581bdd0"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Fish oil lipid emulsions and immune response: what clinicians need to know.","doi":"10.1177/0884533609339071","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1177/0884533609339071","venue":"Nutrition in clinical practice : official publication of the American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition"}

Light-emitting diode (LED) is the main part of visible light communication. The optical wireless communication provides many advantages, such as being license-free, high directional channel, and electromagnetic interference (EMI) free. Meanwhile, in power line communication we are using the power lines as a medium for communications, that is here power lines are carrying the data. PLC technology could provide the consumer with a spectrum of services such as Internet, home entertainment and home automation. Dealing with very high voltages and its isolation is a problem of PLC. Also power line communication is affected by a number of noises, it make the communication system a worst one A solution to this problem is proposed by combining Power Line Communication and Visible Light Communication.. The motivation of this work was to offer a better understanding of the noise effect on the integrated system of PLC and VLC can help mitigate it and improve the communication performances.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Noise Study in the Integrated System of Power Line Communication and Visible Light Communication","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

International consensus is that increased energy and protein intakes in the neonatal period improve growth and neurodevelopment, but after more than 100 y of research the optimum intakes of energy and protein remain unknown. We suggest an important factor contributing to the lack of progress is the lack of a standardized approach to reporting nutritional intake data and growth in the neonatal literature. We reviewed randomized controlled trials and observational studies documented in MEDLINE and the Web of Science from 2008 to 2015 that compared approximately 3 vs. 4 g.kg–1.d–1 protein for preterm babies in the first month after birth. Consistency might be expected in the calculation of nutritional intake and assessment of growth outcomes in this relatively narrow scope of neonatal nutrition research. Twenty-two studies were reviewed. There was substantial variation in methods used to estimate and calculate nutritional intakes and in the approaches used in reporting these intakes and measures of infant growth. Such variability makes comparisons amongst studies difficult and meta-analysis unreliable. We propose the StRONNG Checklist—Standardized Reporting Of Neonatal Nutrition and Growth to address these issues.","inCitations":["d64a974ac446b7cdec42148eba568fefa3185640","c1c01164ae737c6a41148b559b8a7b12c74bbebe","e1167ce102da538af806edd611a0d6a2ad4a0875","9da57eba46bd551df67880af6930a85acbc8031e","8f7d06253b83eed5dd787065a1565090167eb93b","95343f0d9af0a9842c285b59a79ecfa73508459e","ccbb440040e59fb7a65f189554c340b1032f93b3","dd6db79cb041a5826618860ae2565fb45d6d96be","7d8224d182cefaab673ee21c5063d8551ab5409d","b50de9394944b50f88909c0e92bb84afdddcda3a","9dfd049879cc5b1a19c3cc0d0cae34fef0174735","a67897a9f7d200f25722f916c1fd5c1fc10cd736","365ee2ac2c935955e93161455429f66d59bd03b6","253822fbbf987c5732ea74606c85c33a87c6af27","b8e78bee77dceb6eef08f78eb4f101f78f416aab","c32c9f47645a41bdcf3511ba430ab6185cd9c36a","d7780a2c577b560fbc604b57263fb21f66053dca","8a90152f6df5559c535212d053329ac24461a19a","b9b12f46f8441a15c56cbf9e1fe67f92f00554b5","9e05d3d62123d70216eb9012821f0bb479341f41","fec0d19617f048816115ef84c27dda47a57b77ea","38f35a7b193f3471f1bf76f5e68b63239140f788","cc009701a7dceb886b3cb0561f41374c66c4c920","8e9adcb1df526d25c5e8daa98502e7d690318bf8","bc6577a80c1b652d00ae6a54728adf7729a1c236","40e6627a7243616c5d8e2260f01af93b1aef5b56","59093c8caaca57f6339a2d757d32de277f73dbb4","3eca8859dd54fe838a9d20956e67d207c3ddba10","06b76b0d0c78b1cfa6c1a2741de0f78628c18762","ba89c9b4a3aaf6512d423b94c45dbb869bfed9d2","5a0583ed0ea9b06d4a69ffd0ec6707527f55a2f7","682b24dd9eedcfa5941c661e0e8c16023a11f091","dad341eedef6f9dc45a66255ad6d5439721b186b","1bb28205ca65c48a6ccca822ced5ecc696d948d6","14cc4186f240b8fd6443caae7a8ff6caf2fd4f78"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Comparing apples with apples: it is time for standardized reporting of neonatal nutrition and growth studies","doi":"10.1038/pr.2016.26","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1038/pr.2016.26","venue":"Pediatric Research"}

Both effects are fundamentally non-local in nature and this explains why it has been difficult to include them in one-point closures like RST models. Information about the energy-containing structure is necessary if turbulence models are to reflect differences in dynamic behavior associated with structures of different dimensionality (nearly isotropic turbulence vs turbulence with strongly organized two-dimensional structures). Information about the breaking of reflectional symmetry is important whenever mean rotation is dynamically important (flow through axisymmetric diffuser or nozzle with swirl, flow through turbomachinery, etc.). Here we present a new one-point model that incorporates the needed structure information, and show a selection of results for homogeneous and inhomogeneous flows.","inCitations":["e5cb1b6c90b242568c0b6dedb5a94fc61793b2ee","00386853a358591cea35f6a4c10ae1bed7456b93","306f727f14908e315aa14655265bf8021f0cbbca","6e2e49331382076bb3f58e7a4527761a64071626","6fbb8be6c72f849172f2bd7115adfbc1a610529e","93ce8385664215a9a7ef8a0a675191a04c9108b2","90b43fb41fa3fdb2853b8237fc4a4851e7c4a4e6","03b1c1851519baec469d490ab5438ad5acbc368a","05d7fc4dc9f34c0347c284f0c610099773a6f540","bc763cd18141ce4c9792f83d2090d45f655fdd39"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Structure-based turbulence modeling for wall-bounded flows","doi":"10.1016/S0142-727X(00)00050-3","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/S0142-727X%2800%2900050-3","venue":""}

It is against this back drop, the study was conducted to assess the extent of participation of rural women in farming activities in Shiroro Community of Niger State, Nigeria. One hundred and twenty respondents were randomly selected and interviewed in line with the objective of the study. Descriptive statistics and inferential statistical tools were used for data analysis. The findings indicate that young adult women (61.17%) within the age range of 20–40 years are the majority that participated in agricultural activities and majority (60.83%) of the respondents are married. The study revealed that all (100%) of the respondents participated in threshing and harvesting. The farming activities ‘mostly’ participated by respondents are threshing (77.50%), harvesting (75.00%) and seed preparation (70.80%). Inadequacy of agricultural inputs, credit facilities, extension services and poor marketing services limits the extent of participation of rural women in farming activities. The result of probit regression analysis revealed that Socio – economic factors such as age, level of income and years of farming experience has positively influence the extent of participation of rural women in farming activities in the study area. All efforts directed at empowerment of rural women in all field of activity can best be achieved through improvement in access to agricultural inputs, extension advisory services and provision of efficient marketing system.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Assessment of extent of participation of rural women in farming activities in shiroro community of Niger state, Nigeria","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Troponin-I gives a negative circular dichroism band between 300 and 260 nm while troponin-T gives two weak positive bands, one at 290 nm and the other at 263 nm. When troponin-I and troponin-T were mixed, the complex produced a strong negative circular dichroism band with a maximum around 280 nm. This band was most intense with a molar ratio of troponin-T to troponin-I of 1:1. The intensity of the band was 2.4 times that expected from the separate components. The interaction was independent of salt concentration from 0.15 to 0.5 M KCl. Gel filtration on Sephacryl S-200 showed that a stable 1:1 complex was formed between troponin-T and troponin-I. When troponin-C was added to the complex of troponin-T.troponin-I; the reconstituted troponin had a circular dichroism spectrum identical to that of native troponin. The oxidation state of troponin-I was important in reconstituting troponin. Oxidized troponin-I produced less change in the near ultraviolet circular dichroism when added to troponin-T and the troponin-C than did reduced troponin-I. This showed the subunits were not assembled correctly with oxidized troponin-I. When the reconstituted complex was reduced, the circular dichroism was restored to that of native troponin. Troponin reconstituted with oxidized troponin-I did not confer calcium sensitivity on actomyosin ATPase; activity was restored by reducing the complex.","inCitations":["092b4f9c992ad115494a600fbf963774a0f2c8bd","16d3af30bffbef3300edba5f9fbd23fce3cf4dd3","8aed9c21cc23af6646e4dceb2b0d9b37c8ad82cb","27276c79a02fa60b9e3e322694abd058e19b974a","99c6696a35c45191c819d76baf6aff2024d39a3a","1fb3b88220c9f022ac58c47ed3379bf0e624b89b","f382fc110b7d0683266516c5488e1e73e324f651","5a151337580c1f9e5c70aa329e98c3073bede936","8edbf57c9474923c0371220df2afbf0e8b426ce1"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Interaction of troponin subunits.

At that time, there was no specialised agency responsible for administration of copyright, and neither was any provision made in respect of supervising and/or regulating collective administration in Nigeria. The Act merely provided for a “competent authority,” whose role was a tangential one, dealing only with dissatisfactions regarding the grant of licenses with particular reference to collective administration. This provision was actually never activated which implied that there was little or no disputes that involved government’s intervention, if there were any at all. Although copyright issues had started emerging, requiring both regulatory and industry attention, the challenge at the time pertained to the structure responsible for administering copyright collective administration in Nigeria. The impression of most stakeholders was that the private agency (run by the law firm of Giwa & Atilade) existed to serve imperialistic interests and hence local users were hesitant to pay the agency for use of works in which copyright subsists. With the benefit of hindsight, these “challenges” only prefaced subsequent developments after the enactment of legislative provisions establishing a regulatory framework for the collective administration of copyright in Nigeria.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Copyright Collective Administration in Nigeria: Regulatory Challenges","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

The present work reports on a functionalized activated carbon (AC) supercapacitor based on novel redox-mediated gel polymer electrolyte, PVA/H3PO4/ionic liquid (1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate, [EMIM]BF4). The electrochemical properties of this supercapacitor were studied using cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge/discharge and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy techniques with various concentrations of [EMIM]BF4 in PVA/H3PO4 gel polymer electrolyte. The incorporation of [EMIM]BF4 in PVA/H3PO4 electrolyte effectively increased the specific capacitance value due to the improved ionic conductivity and additional pseudo-reaction occurring in the electrode/electrolyte interfaces. The specific capacitance of the supercapacitor using PVA/H3PO4/[EMIM]BF4 (50%) electrolyte showed a maximum value of 271 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 discharge current, which is much higher than the bare PVA/H3PO4 (103 F g−1) based supercapacitor. The supercapacitor with PVA/H3PO4/[EMIM]BF4 (50%) electrolyte showed enhanced energy and power density of 54.3 W h kg−1 and 23.88 kW kg−1 respectively. Moreover the device showed comparable specific capacitance retention after 3000 cycles of charge/discharge.","inCitations":["6e31743acf132c21c8db08eaee154f27940bedd1","d84a9c5263fdf65c46e9d7cea401efe00a6e16c8","8c1a25fc0a35c9c493e406ffad3647da2b3174b6","ade7f45c10f2c713a8a496aaaf116e650efc1c29"],"pdfUrls":["http://ro.uow.edu.au/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3206&context=aiimpapers","http://www.rsc.org/suppdata/c6/ra/c6ra15070e/c6ra15070e1.pdf"],"title":"Enhanced supercapacitive performances of functionalized activated carbon in novel gel polymer electrolytes with ionic liquid redox-mediated poly(vinyl alcohol)/phosphoric acid","doi":"10.1039/C6RA15070E","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1039/C6RA15070E","venue":""}

Increasing demands to find alternatives to antibiotic induces researches about QS and disruption of this mechanism. Inhibition of QS mechanism is an effective method to avoid infections. Many plants, spices, essential oils, and polyphenols, which naturally occurs, have antimicrobial properties. These antimicrobial agents have an importance to fight pathogen microorganisms since multidrug resistant microorganisms pose danger for human health.

Of particular interest, given its recent successes, is the detection of imagery produced by Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), e.g. `deepfakes'. Leveraging large training sets and extensive computing resources, recent work has shown that GANs can be trained to generate synthetic imagery which is (in some ways) indistinguishable from real imagery. We analyze the structure of the generating network of a popular GAN implementation, and show that the network's treatment of color is markedly different from a real camera in two ways. We further show that these two cues can be used to distinguish GAN-generated imagery from camera imagery, demonstrating effective discrimination between GAN imagery and real camera images used to train the GAN.","inCitations":["bf387b2b1e59e32aa753afbac66fb1acd7f53e92","322924507dfe691640d1de54f52789e296afbca3","79ad357066af206580ef5b7e85f6d1590418839f","03b3ec7f913836908d80190250e2e82ebc1334fc","b97cea00255818051d5a7053c96cdfaf56c4b866","1da3ffde612cbdfa861e9b530c3b795504682335","5434f7c3b212a83d3f01949048ed1da114758cff","e6819c0bd3929f8acb9e6fb2bf5eb413e251b209","4515a75e7455c61b54aef553cafccc3433737863","66ea20abf980a3f699a7dcdcb024d3f6393154dc","51ec4e93d8ae4c62453fdb34c6866696da0527b1","995ce8f3d36ee6a2231e8026e85b5b1f98bd28c7","b50d249fcb80ac372629036895c91cf4efcf9e3b","8ff6200de38e0448451312e9545f25a1310a4f8f","b812084698caa3a9be8ed454036c54998008f124","3d02f50ff0468bcac95efb8d1c04254a728ae908","2d066beb34469559e0fc5e5ab4d68dc736cfd46f","cc89dfb5953847abfe0012c0b920aa75b6c018ce","db465b2b5dd65c51ee9500cd0b82db27906eb576"],"pdfUrls":["https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.08247v1.pdf","http://arxiv.org/abs/1812.08247"],"title":"Detecting GAN-generated Imagery using Color Cues","doi":"","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"ArXiv"}

Flow cytometric analysis revealed that 42.3H2 reacted with 88.97% +/- 16.00% of feline peripheral blood lymphocytes (n = 20). This high level of reactivity was found to be consistent by repeated sampling over a 4-month period. Two-color flow cytometric analysis was used to determined the reactivity pattern on lymphocyte subsets: 88.92% +/- 7.30% of CD4+ lymphocytes were 42.3H2-positive, while 85.99% +/- 11.46% of CD8+ cells were positive (n = 11 for both). B lymphocytes had the highest reactivity (99.47% +/- 0.45; n = 9) and also had the highest fluorescence intensity.

It is characterized by extreme reaction temperatures (T > 1000°C), which results in very high reaction rates and thus allows for extremely short contact times (τ < 50 ms). It has been shown that under these extreme conditions, hydrocarbons can be very efficiently converted to synthesis gas, olefins and oxygenates. Particularly the direct oxidation of methane to syngas is the focus of intense research efforts as an alternative to the steam reforming conventionally used in the petrochemical industry research [2]. The platinum-catalyzed partial oxidation of methane is based on a complex interaction between total and partial oxidation reactions: A preferential oxygen adsorption on the catalyst surface leads to a local over-oxidation of the catalyst front edge and thus results in the strongly exothermic total oxidation of methane. While this is by definition detrimental for syngas yields, it raises the catalyst temperature to the level which is thermodynamically necessary to shift the reaction selectivity towards the mildly exothermic partial oxidation. Total oxidation of methane is thus both detrimental and necessary for high syngas yields, effectively limiting attainable syngas yields at autothermal reactor operation [3]. This autothermal limitation can be overcome through heat-integrated reactor concepts based on the mildly exothermic partial oxidation of methane. In particular, this can be achieved by integrating the sensible heat leaving the reactor in the dynamic operation of a reverse-flow reactor configuration [4]. In reverse-flow reactors (RFR), a highly efficient heat-integration is achieved by periodically switching the flow direction of the gases through the reaction tube, while heat-reservoirs upand downstream of the reaction zone as well as the catalyst bed itself act as regenerative heat-exchangers.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://www.nacatsoc.org/18nam/Posters/P319-High-Temperature%20Catalytic%20Partial%20Oxidation.pdf"],"title":"High-Temperature Catalytic Partial Oxidation in a Reverse-Flow Reactor","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Cetuximab combined either with radiotherapy or with chemotherapy showed favourable toxic profile with positive results in both combinations. Therefore, cetuximab could intensify chemoradiation without worsening toxicity. We conducted a phase II study of chemoradiation and cetuximab.\n\n\nPATIENTS AND METHODS\nEligible patients had stage III-IV M0 HNSCC. Treatment consisted of three cycles of cisplatin (20 mg/m(2)/day × 5 days) and fluorouracil (200 mg/m(2)/day × 5 days) rapidly alternated to three split courses of radiotherapy up to 70 Gy and concurrent weekly cetuximab. The primary end point of the study was complete response (CR) rate. Secondary end points were toxicity, progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).\n\n\nRESULTS\nFourty-five patients were enrolled: median age was 56 years, 38 had stage IV disease and 40 nodal involvement. CR occurred in 32 patients (71%). PFS and OS was 21+ months and 32.6+, respectively. Acute grade 3-4 toxic effects were in the expected range, but grade 3 radiodermatitis occurred in 33 patients.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe combination of cetuximab, cisplatin, fluorouracil and radiotherapy leads to a very high proportion of CR and it is feasible with toxic effects similar to those expected by radiochemotherapy. The only unexpected toxicity was skin toxicity: grade 3 radiodermatitis occurred in 73% of the patients.","inCitations":["5cfebf126110289e818ef049832ffbd691024ca6","0c087cf920f2fe89cfd9aff8027ae7343747bafe","21790b85eb1901f55386bcb3de7e6f88c8b7e106","e1fdb9393dab8b75affcc17378217b56638b04c3","e001cb0b55c4b246d699023b1025d8e721240a29","850d8034c4196399b030a8343adb9d7571b464f5","98a98a8defb62e86650f4dffc66d54d312a2fd67","d834b01ffbaa98a4de6451db09f968b0f8f5e1d5","123ba19825905dc014ab9eac5bc638d0ac8fa1df","d287db41598e6d69dc09cde0afcdf0e01937e795","0da8156a8d41316006aae9d5c62a89dd59af6c7b","d0e0e4f3843fca4a0fe3261e11ab39785d7a4680","c187e82997c0f115b0ef731805e09ecd0d72f9f8","84a573afcf11315c7758b8b625da9f309f1aea0d","c1b9f4273fc93c736232bd3bb8e3447234ac43dc","d3b15211fedc07b806c8bffbbc191b625ab42c62","bf360f92fa4f96b7981df54dfe4a8ca587401447","7b68f64fc11735ef19a261c6885bee241b468385","020a1432e5a94ac7ade66c5945d699b7e11b4084","27ec463faef2235175aca3865ffaf2a1314b0770","193eec4c8dd7d4da188a0843718665858a5c2184","e920ba85c96cfe2cc5b70d93ba4f69304d34676e","9b3d6e4af9eb326a0f6747fa3f9eb1202761cce6","f9571b5cfc6bcbc1dcd172be77b4167db41f17b4","ee4aa0845c0399bdafb555cfb0d382104da4cad9","7a44a1ca328fbc8769f077261822e062dcf74091","1ce34a7ee14139907fa2f18a015d35fe6fb448d4","4b904c467f803e0af9108b428525ba1f653c10fc","8608d83e7bc750a54c5c9027258c2af4082e4b11","3230ad23cd70af760fc193a938b17855a40ffb07","7c1ebc5fcc8c5562327c4c5c705b51acef8dadd8","686ad09b754b86991c13f947cf21e7cb5a6ff73f","b0349e5b8b174222e12b2b1121382f812aa5d428","c62d111f805a8e228bbc2b4f52b990f32e864020","4d43a0fe763f558a7e3158c2b87cb4bfbc8440b1","8194416e97097ed95890d2ff8c449ef37aee66f0","d63e9dbe1da6a6ea0771417db81231aed63a19dd","69fd3f1c8b35dcd6dddec533dd84d222bed2ad69","46dd80a64fa258fc5999ce424b0214976d94a9f6","225cd59b4d0eea01ef8a6d0039b4f80b99823edb","76205a0c129715738e2a465c6c457b691e2ffe07","f2a4e6b05e3bb1cca7b490e856d09d771fc6dad0","d12e061227f5a6ce488d1bfbaf2455b3536f61b5","f6977d943ba9b42b541524a7a99bf98d89ce7595","e685a9a57f1caf7a227427eca2740c7aad5b5dcf"],"pdfUrls":["https://watermark.silverchair.com/mdq412.pdf?token=AQECAHi208BE49Ooan9kkhW_Ercy7Dm3ZL_9Cf3qfKAc485ysgAAAaYwggGiBgkqhkiG9w0BBwagggGTMIIBjwIBADCCAYgGCSqGSIb3DQEHATAeBglghkgBZQMEAS4wEQQMpPXBi9ILAtPmL-ZVAgEQgIIBWXyZnhPTDUw_ZF64xcItIfwRnyPCv5Ytwhu42uMwLAz4KWXJ621oWX0Aj2t4iOMMgv9zIGrI-Q8UBFP-zaD8nZMdS1YTPfstfHyTp_rdB7n21LoyxYK5VkaO0LtwaCGVwomvnZ7C70jSf3cZ7AE-5gZ_5EFK5hBJW6onkm6jP7GS4av2TeE1FlomZHlUQOGcS6OYMiNQZNewx38jFJw6MPw0sZIWqyWIn98OKGlUYQE4UojRQfmN5TuhIMFiEvbswFd2RRPhN65WvA--dzDe3BO8_VurWE-NviHTSTbVnjHYpHldiKRvRR8htTDYqpkSpUm131y_vf7i8ePFuPRnN-TG3MhSMd1AUjwgbCG8cGeubjNaW5j2-NVzzV4CJ2_M98LKLxeXKPgoU6gGrRmuVlBTutDwQjaMk5onlgw_Q-4bUbDqT2ZvXw2QSq7c9ZiR2307SP-2EfDinQ","https://watermark.silverchair.com/mdq412.pdf?token=AQECAHi208BE49Ooan9kkhW_Ercy7Dm3ZL_9Cf3qfKAc485ysgAABEkwggRFBgkqhkiG9w0BBwagggQ2MIIEMgIBADCCBCsGCSqGSIb3DQEHATAeBglghkgBZQMEAS4wEQQMue8QhFqcDEaNP9N5AgEQgIID_GKzf3rEB1JwsGtpXJl2M374SoHlg7J0FIJj-A-9L8gt3j_MtiYX4pO6DUXCaVi-U2-w7qLm_aa19XA6MoSwUIN-M0Cz1QhO9CrSdlxPaa5N6T3H81H8LRqCleeRMDXEBzAwblCs62CdWCbfteeXKCTt8VmBq2JdgSWbMuth-bBn1JNpnDBtXrLjIr1-abeXl1ODU1Y1iq7YPa_DFSyNJKVzEsOPGRQV89uwF17pnnELCYjIW9kc6Vt8E8X8EcR1GN4hBKg7jLYGTWnTqTCc2qJ1nGD9-fWdZgRJUiSxMmp7axzqhw-Ycx2JEtSpf3akIOeJOOc6U0YmD5aSO-rHFRmci2tWSoQLjd65Gw-FDdlU3VeGynfj0UC-UUfkn6iK6gcxMMDI5mX-GbjAf2yMLWYVX-hn3IXJTTuXKJmUZ1tP-JoIicLHmV-pcfKHpvBni3XeFo4LCtNTkwDM3aJ_zgBZiEyOhDbwa0E1NPE1lJDcRP8Sa1Z-DDUrGqdrwsxPeC9otetKIiML8DPkqrcvxMk4dEpwiB0QZAlQDf-zqW8LCMWpv_ATk8uHinE-x3Na06G5A1WWXsELeBWlnWSZHmSA1wqSw8A8fozjVzmBPWcF-I91nPMBRarZF5gEpiq1tIIY8rwj1n5CgWZ1vIkECxNww7K253KGZEWWoWHJOHHu4dddIqU252_mPSlGrFIjaLbEkV1Yo-puaWIayubzrtg9J8zaTeb6luVU5bvJtblr8XQvaN37o0gUu1gBmNURWbJPZvCh4XKwiRhPBWKsu4MhhW_WmtPHuy3x8yPP11xADTMM7JoipUad_HIqOWjXLq6390hhLegEBANKrox5NVrg4eSKw9qxgHa5aDvitG7D38TWAnlMBLsLuSspRIhXECJDAVWd9SVEzLQthgHVAH5Bj32ckAc-CskrSl1O7YTZgxpJfg9BrJiP3ycLLh2mghJRqniA5tlrX7nduptbE55Ab54DSVNlBxim90d-oTEECmMwNwsErqaFXqy7Lgk4SALgHOE4Ri7JglSYhl9spqJJIg3jAI2V5LbV_PATIpX-et0f_AisPyzola25jcmUKpqATf61r1I8NDGVxLKlWx-yWmqE236LblqpKrQM7bsTWMeKWryXodxFuavNiSLN4cqYTzeSSubNLi-nbQs2l2evszHCohWZTPLoansAHDsRxaVAARG0iiqdHcXQh0eGADFdFJBTxyKQgCk1jF7eeRkE6GkJDB-za8kTR4ICYErve91nMzAmTISHg2lqwLSslrBN5kIp_D1-lw-SVjDJFRw7tG55Y-bHyF3UCT2c8gbut7Dz_ej_lr-s7bK9xTcRap9F7kDyLVtNb_F7Vw"],"title":"Cisplatin-based chemoradiation plus cetuximab in locally advanced head and neck cancer: a phase II clinical study.","doi":"10.1093/annonc/mdq412","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1093/annonc%2Fmdq412","venue":"Annals of oncology : official journal of the European Society for Medical Oncology"}

One hundred fifty-nine fourth through sixth graders completed both a positive and a negative nomination sociometric measure and a repeated positive nomination sociometric measure. Using the positive and negative nomination measure as the criterion, 66% of the popular children, 82% of the rejected children, and 50% of the neglected children were correctly identified by the repeated positive nomination measure. These results indicate that the repeated positive nomination sociometric measure could be used as a substitute for a positive and negative nomination measure for identifying rejected, but not neglected, children.","inCitations":["a153a0e4af3d4a4f05f6ab320db4f682940e6b18","e55c3929969c5b1ffb35966ead41a08b1e040aaf"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"An Alternative to Negative Nomination Sociometric Measures","doi":"10.1207/s15374424jccp1802_6","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1207/s15374424jccp1802_6","venue":""}

Here, we have examined the abilities of SP-A, SP-D, mannose-binding protein (MBP), and the complement component C1q to stimulate actin-based cellular functions in rat alveolar macrophages and peripheral blood monocytes. Our goal in this study was to examine the cell specificity of the effects of the collectins to understand further the mechanisms by which SP-A and SP-D stimulate alveolar macrophages. We found that SP-A and SP-D have lung cell-specific effects at physiologically relevant concentrations; they stimulate directional actin polymerization and chemotaxis in alveolar macrophages but not in monocytes. Although C1q and MBP weakly stimulate the rearrangement of actin in both cell types, C1q is chemotactic only for peripheral blood monocytes and MBP does not stimulate chemotaxis of either cell type. Neither C1q nor MBP stimulates actin polymerization in alveolar macrophages. These results support the hypothesis that alveolar macrophages express receptors specific for the pulmonary collectins SP-A and SP-D and provide insight into the potential roles of collectins in the recruitment and maturation of mononuclear phagocytes in the lung.","inCitations":["928ce2cd9d6f343bc263b923d5b078957f03f3d4","c8aea92067fdc7195342229f629224415f4369f3","93664f84bd10517283af6f8a7f7024c79e3520dc","5de5ede5220dbdd84be44ec58128205c9f126f74","3022e21f804de89f8fc57987d92e65defd1ef3f8","6b69ae15b3f7f9a3e04b8b3a586e7c14f683fb02","b4a125cd95f8741c042da97882e1294ee36d3f60","03fbf4696d5ddd6c28754b4113d6a293e6bc52e7","ef005bf67c1a3c7e1985083fa4963ab0a35ef156","84d4288ed58cdbe0460fd8434d3dab84f3f5e602","a8584a64309f18b63c68b1938a53df910cbc5c17","32a2f63ecdc80b8ad11cf70cb02806bf6b79d7f1","26f0ca3a79aff317ab63f94fddc0b63f2d6e7f79","c5b7cce0e01b18e7f7869c1a366138e13d0d5192","3590a7e83b28321bbabb32169c233a94e4eb930c","3dac5e44d8077e74d87b5426f57dba1d407f8661","39b9e265158031fc9fcf53311c911b1984bd30d7","8a84c5ec2dd147e43443f416518297649793a3bc","cd75fd0bd7dfc684eb6f847cfe254361f6895d9a","25559348d526e267fba466805358ab4e3a6526d4","574f58c2c82b9650ef2ac75ba0432acd08394cbc","0939830ed85897f41215faa81f445982e35c44f7","2fbc1a66915f1657cb848acf9215685f4d49a3fc","812ae47a7ce48b5f76d7716db61b81da9bd15b29","a3c44672d15df576d860f32a0ac86ec4bef5e4e5","2c3ac9845f2612052ffe019ce55c7f7d4625bcb2","f25c27c99ae34af68a4b08fcc63fd984d597a6e1","439f7af9b23040d9636bfd59513da75916427ddd","7db76000a0b09c5ec58c0e7ad2d8c73ecc2ec51a","3431c63a70166e8dcbc6f8b1871c864ff3b76c79","ce9975a9f9f76f24796dfddb7c8c59b22b02f3c3","247b9e38af78cd97565f2d39001f1bfc5e472847","0cd59ce951032d8bd840b37bf75bce865cf9a345","fa2c6c25f80d1103e624fbe458e22a9f7bc02341"],"pdfUrls":["http://ajplung.physiology.org/content/ajplung/276/1/L164.full.pdf"],"title":"Surfactant proteins A and D specifically stimulate directed actin-based responses in alveolar macrophages.","doi":"10.1152/ajplung.1999.276.1.L164","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1152/ajplung.1999.276.1.L164","venue":"The American journal of physiology"}

The resin-based adhesive composites investigated were Bisco Ortho (Bisco, Schaumburg, Ill), Heliosit Orthodontics (Ivoclar, Schaan, Liechtenstein), Kurasper F (Kuraray, Okayama, Japan), Light Bond (Reliance Orthodontic Products, Itasca, Ill), and Transbond XT (3M Unitek, Monrovia, Calif), cured with Elipar FreeLight 2 (3M ESPE, St Paul, Minn) for the testing of the DC values. Fifty cylindrical specimens were manufactured in molds. The data were analyzed by 2-factor analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey HSD test.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAccording to 2-way ANOVA, the DC was significantly influenced by composite type (P <0.05); after 30 days, there were no differences among the composite types for the DC. The interaction of orthodontic composites and time played a statistically significant role in the DC (P <0.05), but there was no statistically significant influence of time for the DC (P >0.05).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe DC was found to change according to composite materials used, and Bisco Ortho showed the most DC performance. The DC of orthodontic composites is a complex process that is affected not only by inorganic filler content of the composite but also the monomer type and many other factors. Sufficient DC values of 5 commercially available orthodontic composites can be achieved with a new-generation light-emitting diode curing light.","inCitations":["99e123f99216c4efc56504c8a8da057a42fc65d5","b856a6b2c1bbcb91ac2a1d7be1ad134a68a24cc7","8bbadc140e886fbb4dd1285de36de2af395716c2","3c75c46ac2bcb0d95e27ea02be53dbf1bb3ec959","aa2533c25a49efe84044b793c4fb40c207345cf0","06000053cdf90fc1c47004aa9af630168b4b9ec7","6c5d10ecb70ffbb4e7cf8cb67455570736cd8302","fe0e8809a253d45e655fb08d869cd7fa18918be0"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Polymerization capacity of orthodontic composites analyzed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy.","doi":"10.1016/j.ajodo.2009.05.033","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajodo.2009.05.033","venue":"American journal of orthodontics and dentofacial orthopedics : official publication of the American Association of Orthodontists, its constituent societies, and the American Board of Orthodontics"}

In conventional rehabilitation, the progression of a patient is assessed by a professional, who analyzes visual tracking data. This assessment is dependent on each professional’s own experience. In this paper, we propose an approach to analyze tracking data, captured by our robotic walker’s gait tracking system, to detect shifts in the gait pattern over time automatically. For this purpose, the system takes in gait tracking data and segments it into gait cycles (heel strike to heel strike). Then, our approach handles each gait cycle considering it as a group of gait parameters that define trajectories in that time frame. From each gait parameter within the cycle, spatiotemporal features are extracted and similarity rates are computed using autoencoders. These spatiotemporal features and similarity rates are fused in a feature space which is fed to a one-class support vector machine that constructs a model of the observable gait cycle. Each posterior observed gait cycle is checked for shifts, using a set of proposed novelty detection techniques. Experimental tests using a dataset captured using our robotic walker platform revealed a promising performance when detecting if a gait cycle is ‘reference’ or ‘novel’ when compared to a previously trained model of a unique ‘reference’ gait pattern.\n","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1007/s11370-019-00280-z"],"title":"Trajectory-based gait pattern shift detection for assistive robotics applications","doi":"10.1007/s11370-019-00280-z","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11370-019-00280-z","venue":"Intelligent Service Robotics"}

Dynactin increases the processivity of dynein and also targets dynein to specific cellular locations. Although the role of dynactin in dynein-mediated processes is well established, the underlying mechanisms involved are unknown. Here, we use single molecule approaches to investigate the contribution of the dynactin subunit p150Glued to dynein motor function. We first characterized the motility of purified GFP-tagged mammalian dynein isolated from a knock-in mouse brain tissue (Zhang et al., 2013). Consistent with previous reports (Mallik et al., 2005; Ross et al., 2006), single molecules of dynein-GFP switch stochastically from processive to diffusive states of motion. We analyzed this motion by a novel algorithm that we developed to parse trajectories into different states and found that dynein is processive 60% of the time. To examine the activation of dynein by dynactin, we investigated the formation and co-migration of a dynein-p150Glued co-complex using dual-color TIRF microscopy. We provide direct evidence that p150Glued is sufficient to recruit and tether dynein to the microtubule and that this recruitment is concentration-dependent; p150Glued increases the on-rate and decreases the off-rate of dynein from microtubules. Single molecule imaging of motility in cell extracts demonstrates that the CAP-Gly domain of dynactin is essential for the decreased detachment rate of the dynein-dynactin complex from the microtubule and also acts as a brake to slow the dynein motor. Consistent with this important role, two neurodegenerative disease-causing mutations in the CAP-Gly domain abrogate these functions in our assays. Together, these observations support a model in which dynactin enhances the initial recruitment of dynein onto microtubules and promotes the sustained engagement of dynein with its cytoskeletal track.","inCitations":["fdbb91e863616859de6471a48f2afb121a265920","124fff1f604aa73cffd1dd5409f8b67eed631673","761aefd2829e38b21256acf7aebee491ec8a93a9","e0cc1af2a2f15e8b42ed75135dcb91b41183624b","1935444f341295a68bf4774d07fa8d5e8be54596","c2aa1f96136531acb112cda9944ec08141cb48be","f14403b9b8c88bdee33f83fd06d4a64a72710556","dccbbc356d78a8a4ace7c6ab1cf802c831cb1611","889517e7cd26f85cdb2cb6690c79f4d1391bf5d1","878f92d2acb5165a84d8405b92b1e2ecae2ea295","6e0ed1701826f838905ba60674eba4a1b44431f3","b178215bec15e7f105fa2c03f735cd648948ce48","de6d94fa61a031d59770dff3f78d9dd895ed6f8c","0f181068bbe0835eba9662f597df039d714b5f0e","ff21fa26c3523cab1959568ccb82ee329d562843","c920b742f35c8b8c820c635dfac5c32d4bc439b5"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Dynactin Functions as Both a Dynamic Tether and Brake during Dynein-Driven Motility","doi":"10.1016/j.bpj.2014.11.748","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bpj.2014.11.748","venue":""}

This is particularly true for developed countries. For example, in the EU countries in 2016, the share of people aged 65+ years was 19.2%, which was an increase of 0.3% in comparison with the previous years and 2.4% in comparison with 10 years earlier. And it is expected that the share of older people aged 65+ years will rise to 29.1% by 2080 (Eurostat, 2017). Therefore, governments all over the world try to implement strategies or guidelines for the maintenance or even improvement of quality of life of older people and thus, reduce their and country’s economic and social burden. One of the solutions seems to be the use of modern technological devices such as computers and more recently, smartphones. As Pew Research center1 states, four in ten seniors now own smartphones, which is twice as many than in 2013. However, there is still an enormous gap in the use of smartphones between the generations. For example, 85% of the French aged 18-34 years own a smartphone compared with 35% of the French who are 65+ years. There is a 50% point difference between these two groups and the same is true for Poland or Germany (Poushter, 2016). Nevertheless, one can observe a gradual growth since in 2015 out of 64% of all American adults, 27% of the Americans aged 65+ owned a smartphone, which was an 8-point increase in comparison with the year of 2014 (Smith, 2015). In Europe, the leading countries among the senior smartphone users are the Scandinavian countries, especially Norway and Sweden. As far as the gender is concerned, senior males tend to use smartphones more frequently than their female counterparts (Berenguer et al., 2017). As it has been already mentioned, the main focus in the aging process concentrates on the maintenance and enhancement of elderly people’s quality of life, specifically their cognitive, mental, and physical health (cf. Lu et al., 2017). Particularly the concept of cognitive reserve, which can be defined as the resilience to neuropathological damage of the brain (Stern, 2013), plays an important role in the aging process. It has been argued that this brain reserve is the result of experience-based neural changes which are caused by a physically and mentally stimulating lifestyle, as well as by higher left frontal cortex-connectivity (Freret et al., 2015; Franzmeier et al., 2017a,b; Gelfo et al., 2017). Research studies (e.g., McClearn et al., 1997) reveal that 60% of general cognitive ability is of genetic origin, but there are some non-pharmacological activities such as cognitive training, which may be effective in its enhancement as well (Fox, 2017). Antoniou et al. (2013) report that some of these non-pharmacological activities, which are aimed at the stimulation of the cognitive functions might delay the cognitive decline. Smartphone applications seem to be a good support tool for cognitive training in aging.","inCitations":["a8c0bc6de2ce630828b2d641f6b9f13503b9c3d0","ce2fca07112ed5174f4d327c81f249150ea1cf9f"],"pdfUrls":["https://fjfsdata01prod.blob.core.windows.net/articles/files/323996/pubmed-zip/.versions/1/.package-entries/fnagi-09-00436/fnagi-09-00436.pdf?rscd=attachment%3B+filename*%3DUTF-8''fnagi-09-00436.pdf&se=2018-12-30T12:12:57Z&sig=XWeEUUS7Hin%2BZHbuXG2GyntPCZp27VF6rV/xy7wED7Y%3D&sp=r&sr=b&sv=2015-12-11"],"title":"Smartphone Applications Can Serve as Effective Cognitive Training Tools in Healthy Aging","doi":"10.3389/fnagi.2017.00436","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.3389/fnagi.2017.00436","venue":"Front.
