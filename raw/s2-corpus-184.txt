However, image quality of protocol A were diagnostic. In patients with BMI<23kg/m2 or HR<60bpm, subjective image quality scores of some coronary arteries in protocol A were not significantly different from protocol B (P>0.05).

Here we analyze spatial variation in fire danger during episodic wind events in coastal southern California, a densely populated Mediterranean-climate region. By reconstructing almost a decade of fire weather patterns through detailed simulations of Santa Ana winds, we produced the first high-resolution map of where these hot, dry winds are consistently most severe and which areas are relatively sheltered. We also analyzed over half a century of mapped fire history in chaparral ecosystems of the region, finding that our models successfully predict where the largest wildfires are most likely to occur. There is a surprising lack of information about extreme wind patterns worldwide, and more quantitative analyses of their spatial variation will be important for effective fire management and sustainable long-term urban development on fire-prone landscapes.","inCitations":["8843a4ad8a96350af8b8f2ddc46c12b725e0e32a","0928603ac15ed9b8015cea5e7571a3fc8a2d447d","4bd5865e34e7bbbc66b091b8c815800ed77efa45","05479b424a96234d4865c8deebc760634e82e5ef","21af8c75c41f72358babb68f41e598a8c555fc9c","2483afd91c8910b1aceb0724d8f41bfafc11a43c","38197849439e46141670ece9da9e2ca30d765fe8","4c72c34241cd497eb66c3e9dd7a5ddd175750c23","5229b57806ed720438e3ed70210c6a43338a71dc","ae8fb1802a907ed27853b6c9037692598c835bd6","079509ea217ce17e2a963c461c7f42982bbf8b34","071df6f544ef5b6ad6b6ee13274640e9a4baa4e6","cd98069b6b8d8ba95dbcd92c25ed099578ab85e4","5ea689128f83eaf629aeb2e8689fedfead4335fb","527c59513f79a631efbf5056f582616ad92516e6","29ed7fd26c8b3a17745d14b5fecd87ced6b0f258","554610258236889e4c1cf5e6dff324bf1300f79d","c60254db8132e1efd6471144ce8a177bbb32cbdb","f0f73c6df78eb5eba0e559db1df45eb75fea6197","f6c838ee468d00f7731d5a8ac3b3ade23379b192","97fa3c5b07d618688f7a8b1b3fe7d552842d8709","f4f4fca059406e752c5630b2fd4f8e432279d55e","05ab261d2c815cc7662caff362c23a338e301b72","c907389aca58fdd750e0d8af8c83ffd9e43fc3ed","1b6b7bb9b151eeea3c30bbabf4fb06972091c42d","d2cd64307ca48e13ec777757e9852784357c8f58","2e8ff3eb361b9bed51174e61c348f832b11843f7","a390e1ab1baf471761aa52009a354169407fc772","c7f1fcdf221c481956b36232f7f9ca320313d16e","381ec314842c3974672ad5cef63226a8f658e0fa","b7d0ca46ac65bb0b4446a7f10986b3de2faf8bc1","5e040c43a0cff32331400edfc75aa6ee92300f24","7f2af5d3a5d051bd567516fa3ada0629d933241a","200504b961602168c6b2f2b82667b4ca6faa5338","5af3fe91513e38d8c963c7ef5900939f620d57da","20db7fce569a57406a715132793ec86ff865ee7a","c23368e78ca7cb55876a5a9c5ddd8c73014505af","ead226d8dc1025d6bed1c1789762f7c807bdcf70","02e484b80d508ec5641ac0a8314671a310ac5ad4","e6a6ac54a041ef0d0a51280be10d64a7afdf0eba","967f9235a88036c698496f59113a51ab8c91ca45","38d13558613aee6963ad2bc215395462df5d9e01","8e434ce2bdb68eb0f254bcb900f8f8b04cd0ff59","e2e461a32d2b75c3509ed4302d9803cbebcb6d5d","8d0fbc94d0bca5626df021656e75e7a23d5d7897","6d658252c56992b0219ffef0c594da936da1fbc0","89066a0f582da09b19c8ffe126c3f08f0ba960c7","22dde48734307691bf8ed41b2603b2e03c832971","3cffb3fc6a617b79780569cf53fd1edee556afe1","ef24a2bfa1abf880ddb32fc8ff606adc676e9370","acd15ecce00663535438b282c06e83afaf5ede4f","915b55622d3bca764c038033625857acc9743e93","e0b65f7e4556b09209899db88ab3c76c94b79d67","25a4a88048b89d6ccdb60e85a0b16eb8f50104e4","c7982566932627e49e0c604679a2242c9a4d388c"],"pdfUrls":["http://wildfire.stat.ucla.edu/pdflibrary/moritzhall10.pdf","https://nature.berkeley.edu/moritzlab/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Moritz_etal_GRL_2010_Supp-2.pdf","http://nature.berkeley.edu/moritzlab/docs/Moritz_etal_2010_GRL.pdf","http://www.atmos.ucla.edu/csrl/publications/Hall/2009GL041735.pdf"],"title":"Spatial variation in extreme winds predicts large wildfire locations in chaparral ecosystems","doi":"10.1029/2009GL041735","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1029/2009GL041735","venue":""}

This system masks the “external” costs arising from those energy choices, including shorter lives, higher health care expenses, a changing climate, and weakened national security. As a result, we pay unnecessarily high costs for energy. New “rules of the road” could level the energy playing field.

The semantics of mainstream low-level languages like C is inherently insecure, and even for safer languages, establishing security with respect to a high-level semantics does not guarantee the absence of low-level attacks. Secure compilation using the coarse-grained protection mechanisms provided by mainstream hardware architectures would be too inefficient for most practical scenarios. This new ERC-funded project called SECOMP1 is aimed at leveraging emerging hardware capabilities for fine-grained protection to build the first, efficient secure compilers for realistic programming languages, both low-level (the C language) and high-level (F, a dependently-typed ML variant [3, 23]). These compilers will provide a secure semantics for all programs and will ensure that high-level abstractions cannot be violated even when interacting with untrusted low-level code. To achieve this level of security without sacrificing efficiency, our secure compilers will target a tagged architecture [7, 9], which associates a metadata tag to each word and efficiently propagates and checks tags according to software-defined rules. We will use property-based testing and formal verification to provide high confidence that our compilers are","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://prosecco.gforge.inria.fr/personal/hritcu/students/topics/2016/secomp-mpri.pdf"],"title":"Formally Secure Compilation Last updated : January 3 , 2017 General Information","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Airborne laser scanning (ALS) can be used to extensively map riverine topography. Although airborne blue/green LiDAR can also be utilized for the mapping of river bathymetry, the accuracy levels achieved are not as good as those of terrain elevation measurements. Moreover, airborne bathymetric LiDAR is not yet suitable for mapping shallow water areas. More detailed topographical data may be obtained by fixed-position terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) or mobile terrestrial laser scanning (MLS). One of the newest applications of MLS approaches involves a boat/cart-based mobile mapping system (BoMMS/CartMMS). This set-up includes laser scanning and imaging from a boat moving along a river course and may be used to expand the spatial extent of terrestrial scanning.

The field sensitivity of the ONO tunnel barrier was higher than that of the NON tunnel barrier during electron injection.

An open system by itself is thus not conservative. As a result, the time-evolution operator is not hermitian in the usual sense and the eigenfunctions (factorized solutions in space and time) are no longer normal modes but quasinormal modes (QNMs) whose frequencies $\\omega$ are complex. QNM analysis has been a powerful tool for investigating open systems. Previous studies have been mostly system specific, and use a few QNMs to provide approximate descriptions. Here we review recent developments which aim at a unifying treatment. The formulation leads to a mathematical structure in close analogy to that in conservative, hermitian systems. Many of the mathematical tools for the latter can hence be transcribed. Emphasis is placed on those cases in which the QNMs form a complete set for outgoing wavefunctions, so that in principle all the QNMs together give an exact description of the dynamics. Applications to optics in microspheres and to gravitational waves from black holes are reviewed, and directions for further development are outlined.","inCitations":["3bd49fbf5fef704a51e66ba99cd329fe9cfa49ad","072d86122231293a5d23166a363324bcacf8f123","ec73a5c3a0800cfee9eb87cb8149b38e01ff2d8a"],"pdfUrls":["https://arxiv.org/pdf/gr-qc/9904017v1.pdf"],"title":"Waves in Open Systems: Eigenfunction Expansions","doi":"10.1103/RevModPhys.70.1545","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1103/RevModPhys.70.1545","venue":""}

Hence there must be no arbitrariness in what is said. This matters above everything.”1Confucius (551–479 BC)\n\nEpidemiological studies and previous meta-analyses have shown that breast implant–associated anaplastic large cell lymphoma (BI-ALCL) is a distinct type of T-cell lymphoma involving the capsule or effusion surrounding a breast implant. A United States Food and Drug Administration safety communication in 2011 prompted the American Society of Plastic Surgeons (ASPS) to initiate a patient registry, include BI-ALCL language in patient consent forms warning of this potential malignancy, as well as pressured implant manufacturers to include the same in package inserts. Despite being first described 18 years ago, little progress has been made to understand the etiology or molecular pathogenesis of this lymphoma. In addition, BI-ALCL remains unfamiliar or misunderstood by many oncologists, surgeons, radiologists, pathologists, and patients.\n\nIn many ways, the authors present a timely and much needed literature review on previous case reports of lymphoma and breast implants.2 The manuscript supports several pertinent findings, including that the presentation of ALCL is a spectrum with occasional disease-related death, that the presence of mass portends a worse prognosis, that cases are not isolated to a particular type of implant, and that improved global awareness is needed. The authors are to be commended for trying to make further sense of a very rare disease that has been sporadically reported over the last two decades. More disease-focused manuscripts are needed on BI-ALCL as diagnosis and treatment of these patients is commonly delayed months and, in some cases, years.

Debido a ello, son muchas las companias que ven un filon en esta actividad, tanto empresas familiares que llevan siglos en el negocio, como multinacionales que buscan diversificacion y nuevos mercados. Pero no solo importa el proceso de elaboracion y venta de los caldos. Detras del proceso de creacion de un buen vino, existen infinidad de pequenos detalles que hacen de este un producto unico. Comenzando por la tierra y las labores necesarias para el correcto crecimiento y desarrollo de las vides, y terminando en las campanas de marketing y ventas, tanto a nivel nacional como, cada vez mas, a nivel mundial. En este trabajo se va a tratar la inversion en un proyecto de implantacion de 12 hectareas de vina en el termino municipal de ‘La Vid y Barrios’, dentro de la provincia de Burgos, la mayor en cuanto a produccion se refiere dentro de la Denominacion de Origen. Dicha Denominacion permite el desarrollo de actividades vitivinicolas con hasta seis variedades de uva distintas: Tempranillo, o tinta del pais, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Malbec, Garnacha Tinta y Albillo (esta ultima es una uva blanca). Con la transformacion de estas uvas se realizan distintos tipos de vino: - Tinto Joven. - Tinto Crianza. \n- Tinto Reserva. \n- Tinto Gran Reserva. \nPor otro lado, la zona donde se va a realizar el proyecto se encuentra en el sur de la provincia de Burgos, cerca de la localidad de Aranda de Duero, una zona geografica ideal para el desarrollo de las vides. \nEn cuanto a los condicionantes meteorologicos, destacan entre los mas importantes factores como el tipo de suelo (dependiendo, sobre todo, de la concentracion de caliza activa), la altitud de la plantacion, las heladas, las precipitaciones o los vientos. Ademas, existen otros factores como las enfermedades o la fauna que tambien pueden influir en el desarrollo del vinedo, por lo que es muy importante tener un conocimiento de todos ellos para poder realizar las labores necesarias en el periodo de tiempo adecuado.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Implantación de 12 hectáreas de viñedo en la denominación de origen Ribera del Duero","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

The systemic lesions of Wegener's granulomatosis are usually preceded by the nasal lesions; hence Wegener's original term 'rhinogenic granulomatosis'. It is, therefore, interesting to note that in the two cases here described the nasal lesions seem to have developed subsequently in the course of the presenting rheumatoid arthritis; in fact, providing the relevant diagnostic clues. Nasal lesions can remain asymptomatic, but it may be suggested that an earlier examination of the nasal mucosa might have revealed some early pathological changes, such as fibrinous vasculosis and occasional giant cells in some nonspecific histiocyte granulation tissue. In this context I believe that the concept of the localized form of Wegener's granulomatosis as suggested by Fienberg (1953, American Journal of Clinical Pathology 23, 413; 1974, Lancet i, 574) and by Carrington & Liebow (1966, American Journal of Medicine 41, 497) has to be strongly supported although frowned upon by Wegener himself (1968, Morgagni 1, 5) and by the authors. The earliest diagnosis of Wegener's granuloma, in the apparent absence of systemic lesions of any kind, has acquired an added urgency since the introduction of potent cytotoxic drugs capable of arresting the disease. Spontaneous remissions also occur. Atypical cases should more often be reported both as a salutary reminder of the diagnostic difficulties and assisting in the elucidation of the etiological factors. It has been suggested that the disease is an immunologically mediated disorder and that also applies to rheumatoid arthritis. Part of the existing confusion derives from the fact that some authors hold to the original definitions whereas others offer modifications (Fienberg, 1974; Michaels, 1976, in: Scientific Foundations of Otolaryngology, Ed. Hinchcliffe & Harrison. Heinemann, London, p 671; &c.). It is not easy to find pathologists or clinicians who will agree completely about all aspects of classification and the literature is replete with modifying diagnostic terms. Since the localized form of Wegener's granulomatosis bears some topographic and clinical resemblance to the idiopathic midline granuloma or Stewart's type nonhealing granuloma of the nose (Fauci & Wolff, 1976, Annals of Internal Medicine 84, 140; Friedmann, 1964, Proceedings 57, 289; 1971, Journal of Laryngology 85, 631; Friedmann & Osborn, 1976, in: Systemic Pathology.

Selected patients with elevated serum creatinine who were prescribed at least one drug needing dose adjustment were kept for further study. Eight hundred and thirty drug orders were evaluated in which dose adjustment was required in 193 (23.2%) of cases. Proper dose adjustments were performed in 88 (45.5%) of cases and not performed in 105 (54.4%) orders. According to our study, inappropriate dose adjustment in renal dysfunction shows a great need for pharmacist involvement in the process to improve drug dosing and avoid adverse drug reactions.

Under the ‘more for more’ mechanism, the EU tries to persuade third countries to strengthen their border controls, restrict their visa policy and readmit irregular migrants with incentives such as trade benefits, visa facilitation or financial support. In its Partnership Framework of 2016, the Commission announced a more proactive approach by shifting its emphasis from the ‘more for more’ to the ‘less for less’ mechanism, including leverages and tools of all other policy areas. This article analyses the overall objectives of the GAMM (which are promoting fundamental rights and achieving an equal partnership) and the content of its four pillars. While elaborating on the potential impact on the policies in third countries and the human rights of migrants, it concludes that due to the paradoxical objectives, the cooperation has the potential to create counterproductive effects and an incoherent foreign policy. The absence of criteria on human rights for the selection of partner countries as well as the lack of a mechanism for monitoring or suspending such cooperation lowers the chance of an adequate response in the case of human rights violations. With these considerations in mind, the article explores the content and impact of the EU-Turkey deal and answers the question of whether it serves as a blueprint for a new generation of readmission agreements with other countries. The author concludes that due to the lack of mutual benefits and the differences in human rights standards and practices, transferring the responsibility of refugees to third countries will not prove effective and compliant with EU standards.","inCitations":["2b6dae8cd75c3747a7f86299b9fb53d6b579c67d","10f6a5fdd60d9ae4d8f25babeb3f3441352f6c8c","5175d6adf8fbaffcacff64344d2637396d9e5f78","cc8236ee1286b78d8398240f54b15c7107678a28","9c3d1f094fbb6301bfc71d2c2ae8f8c9a7af791f","4e79032f4e3816f649f6487124b7c4fb31e91dfd","28952a14c09f18d36764f494ff00cb9f3ef2b2c7","5800ae45bdcb32aa604ae0939367080f85b17fc9","9a843ae222b35fe3ac9f6d612bd4e7755e7d3a2b","2c1bf8d9672fd5ee2364d97c8b44cb8589ec9786","c3f87a44dbcd643ffeff4b6d7d822ea872917e3c","ae88543a634b4253d15d51bec5bde1d2a9e8b1ce","a3cb310cdd6f30eb61905001c40c81f32ea92473","e9217ef2fb038a47dd74eb394b5b9d549a846e49","573abd362c9ffb66fa92a26032cf4c5639067ce9","6030fc68a0b8aebb2947330ffb62920e05b00a8e","c2b7d2edcdf2f70ad1fc0103600efbdb80599ae1","c674a3b1312603636dbed671984396da9b3947d8","c682a39de90a95fcaae670266582397cf9c98912","d54f57cc3e0b978a85ac32618953df2ee79b9a5e","0fc63245eeca5faae6b9efdd03ebe47c3121a61a","6b65c54991a7d23b4b3a75bc60574879b22b94e5","dc9a69d898b7f373e5ad57fad70c29248451a920"],"pdfUrls":["https://repository.ubn.ru.nl/bitstream/handle/2066/203237/203237.pdf?sequence=1","https://ugp.rug.nl/GROJIL/article/download/31071/28379"],"title":"The Global Approach to Migration and Mobility","doi":"10.21827/5a6afa49dceec","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.21827/5a6afa49dceec","venue":""}

Some digital libraries have either been completely abandoned or they have been put on hold indefinitely. One of the reasons for this predicament is that developers of digital libraries have approached their implementation the same traditional way of building applications, which is also akin to the way structures of physical information organizations are built. However, service-oriented architecture offers a better approach to building digital libraries, including streamlining business components, employing re-usable services and connecting existing applications to communicate efficiently and effectively. This essay looks at some of the major benefits of service-oriented architecture and how digital libraries can tap into these benefits by adopting and implementing the requirements of service-oriented architecture. The essay concludes that digital libraries are better-off adopting service-oriented approach than maintaining the status quo.

Brahman bulls reached puberty at a later age than bulls of the Santa Gertrudis, Hereford and Angus breeds. Santa Gertrudis bulls had the largest testes with the Brahman having the smallest during this time span. During the summer months, when the bulls were 16 to 20 months of age, testes size, sperm motil i ty and sperm cell concentration of the ejaculate increased markedly in Brahman and Santa Gertrudis bulls. Angus bulls exhibited stable to slight increases in testes size, semen volume and semen quality, suggesting that this breed had reached its most rapid stage of development by 16 months of age. During this same period Hereford bulls showed a decline in testicular size and semen quality suggesting that Hereford bulls suffered from the environmental stresses of the semitropical summer in Florida. Within the Hereford breed, bulls from the lines of Montana origin exhibited a greater decline than those from the line originating in Florida.

In the present study, we found that hyaluronic acid synthesis in somite explants steadily increased until day 6, then decreased, and inclusion of notochord did not accelerate the rate of synthesis. Analysis of hyaluronidase activity in the somite explants indicated an increase in the enzyme level in day-6 cultures. Again, inclusion of notochord did not alter this pattern. The decrease in hyaluronic acid after day 6 and the increase in sulfated proteoglycan synthesis from day 6 resemble the pattern described during limb development. Subsequent studies showed that, with time, the size of the hyaluronic acid synthesized by somites increased and, again, inclusion of notochord did not influence this pattern. The results indicate that unstimulated somites are capable of synthesizing cartilage-specific proteoglycans in a relatively restricted manner, and the inclusion of notochord resulted in accelerated synthesis of stable proteoglycan aggregates typical of differentiated chondrocytes. Metabolic events in somites related to hyaluronic acid are not influenced by the notochord.","inCitations":["15e661e36e988b932862356da514c233ba81b288"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Somite chondrogenesis in vitro: 2.

Although much research to identify the etiology of IBD has focused on genetic constitution, infectious causes, and immune dysregulation, its exact cause and pathogenesis remain incompletely understood. Mesenteric blood flow, the intestinal microcirculation, and intestinal ischemia also have been proposed as etiologic, although they remain less-explored themes despite evidence suggesting a contributory role in IBD pathogenesis. The anatomy, architecture, and function of the splanchnic microcirculation will be reviewed here with regard to the development of intestinal microvascular ischemia, a pathologic process that appears to precede the classic changes that characterize IBD.","inCitations":["2f4cf5b62037a293267a99ec6f5052c63f5fc52a","cbcfcb1636d56a9786c9ed8941a15bbcc68b41a3","2274413a444aea5f4ec21c9cb030e465e5d84107","a6038c5294b8fc6e8af9b169a2b5fa94cff46f2b","7db7579804c6c63edaa3f4caa634bcd7126daa2f","c3e5c8b13b70bef5d8cb1aacd386a819a6377387","701e2b7805d234895946df3d54f75a4fd8df7d77","b1b83d80e0f91eb2737c339951d2c38f0b70a3cd","15638e7e624f50cb80672ef756ab66f72f15f405","7c354e33f5661ec22e8561075963ccfebfc4f9cb","99ed1464e11bcb0dade643a6f194151db725eae1","60d4ae51bca5be4425ec6cc000508433b9bf96f6","48798bde11217af1e23e768312cd327da570878d","9d8a172691e3f6e6c66313992a4c8ca84f5237e6","b7e8bde8234c7df7e31f3b607ea31051fd0265c1","44b5acd30f50656fcee51a7b9e0f01b8d501488c","28b5b17dd3ebafb340840df6c072b226fd5aa6b8","5e3f7f74886f58f2eab757e028a5e01c8780a2f2"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"On the role of ischemia in the pathogenesis of IBD: a review.","doi":"10.1002/ibd.21061","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1002/ibd.21061","venue":"Inflammatory bowel diseases"}

Because it broke up during a close encounter with Jupiter in 1992, it was bright enough to be discovered more than a year prior to impact, allowing the scientific community an unprecedented opportunity to assess the effects such an event would have. Many excellent observations were made from Earth-based telescopes, the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and the Galileo spacecraft en route to Jupiter. In this paper, these observations are used in conjunction with computational simulations performed with the CTH shock-physics hydrocode to determine the sizes of the fifteen fragments that made discernible impact features on the planet. To do this, CTH was equipped with a radiative ablation model and a post-processing radiative ray-trace capability that enabled light-flux predictions (often called the impact flash) for the viewing geometries of Galileo and ground-based observers. The five events recorded by Galileo were calibrated to give fragment size estimates. Compared against ground-based and HST observations, these estimates were extended using a least-squares analysis to assess the impacts of the remaining ten fragments. Some of the largest impacts (L, G and K)more » were greater that 1 km in diameter but the density of the fragments was low, about 0.25 g/cm{sup 3}. The volume of the combined fifteen fragments would make a sphere 1.8 km in diameter. Assuming a pre-breakup density of 0.5 g/cm{sup 3}, the parent body of Shoemaker-Levy 9 had a probable diameter of 1.4 km. The total kinetic energy of all the impacts was equivalent to the explosive yield of 300 Gigatons of TNT.« less","inCitations":["ffcf951690accc1c80fe83e1394e494bac83c97f","bb8baab3d5e379e9eeadefc00921350a87cc0b8c","2478952058b92a6bf5fb5459620869931bc783e9","6bea323fc36363728403ea6e3c1ef26d339917c4","8db56035be6dfa48edc2a4d4c6be3fe92ba3e322","ac3bee2888f3fec222be1569ed2f4b6ce45e2b17","1038a333bd2c2449267b735fb49c8abe77a6bbd4","8761ad2ea3f2e72a4a439d7f997677a62cd78945"],"pdfUrls":["https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc682233/m2/1/high_res_d/485982.pdf"],"title":"Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 Fragment Size Estimates: How Big was the Parent Body?","doi":"10.1111/j.1749-6632.1997.tb48340.x","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1749-6632.1997.tb48340.x","venue":""}

Height is a qualifying element for each individual. Society sometimes views persons with a short stature as different. Leg lengthening surgery to improve one’s appearance has thus become a common request. We report our experience to demonstrate that the objective is both possible to achieve and useful. Material and methods: From 1985 to 2000, we operated 54 patients (32 men and 22 women). Mean follow-up was five years three months (16 years – 1 year). For these patients, we found a valid justification for the request for increased height, while surgery was declined for 82 other patients. Mean age at surgery was 5.8 years (range 18–47) (28.1 years for men and 23.6 years for women). Mean height was 153 cm (159 for men and 147 for women). Patients were given psychological support. We performed simultaneous bilateral leg lengthening because of the better tolerance compared with the femur. The standard device had three rings and a proximal semi-ring. A two-level lengthening system was used, requiring double osteotomy, a proximal tibial metaphyseal osteotomy and a distal metaphyseal osteotomy. Seven days after trepan osteotomy and twelve days after Gigli saw osteotomy, we initiated the lengthening procedure with 1/4 turn (1/4 mm) three times a day. Achilles tendon lengthening was associated for 19 patients. For three patients (4 limbs) the regenerated bone collapsed requiring insertion of a new device. Results: Mean lengthening was 7 cm (11- 5 cm). Mean duration of treatment was eight months ten days. Aesthetic outcome was considered excellent by 92% of patients and good by 8%. Discussion: The patient’s desire for greater height must be well motivated and associated with good knowledge of possible risks (detailed informed consent). Using the circular device for leg lengthening allows correction of associated moderate alignment anomalies. Conclusion: If the patient has a valid psychological justification and an objective height below the mean of the local population, leg lengthening procedures can be performed for aesthetic purposes with reasonable risk and satisfactory results.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Simultaneous Bilateral Leg Lengthening for Aesthetic Purposes","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

One study reported greater rate of seasonal influenza-related hospitalizations in SCD compared to those with Cystic Fibrosis (CF). Another small study described excess morbidity in SCD due to 2009 H1N1 pandemic relative to prior seasons. Objectives: 1. To examine time trends in influenza hospitalizations comparing 2009 H1N1 period with prior flu seasons, 2. To determine the relative impact of H1N1 pandemic in SCD in comparison to CF, 3. To determine the trend of antiviral use among hospitalized children with influenza. Methods: We used the Pediatric Health Information System (PHIS), a database of clinical and financial data from free-standing children9s hospitals in the US. Only patients under the age of 21 who were hospitalized at one of the 25 PHIS hospitals that provided discharge data from 1999–2010 were included in the analysis. Clinical outcomes of mortality, ICU admission, and mechanical ventilation as well as the use of antivirals were compared between patients hospitalized during the 2009–2010 H1N1 season and those hospitalized in prior influenza seasons. Categorical data were analyzed using χ 2 or Fischer9s Exact tests and the Kruskal Wallis nonparametric test was used to analyze continuous data. A p-value of Results: Among hospitalized children with SCD, H1N1 accounted for a higher percentage of hospitalizations than did seasonal influenza (4.9% vs. 2.0%, P Conclusions: • Using the largest in-patient database, we report that H1N1 pandemic accounted for a greater percentage of hospitalizations among sickle cell patients compared to seasonal flu. • We also confirm that sickle cell patients with H1N1 more often developed acute chest syndrome and required blood transfusions than seasonal influenza.

Upon activation with diethylaluminium chloride (Et2AlCl), all the complexes exhibited moderate to good catalytic activity for ethylene oligomerization (27-415 g mmol(-1)(Ni) h(-1) bar(-1)) with high selectivity for ethylene dimerization to form alpha-butene.

It was found that the adoption of e‐marketplaces is associated with a reduction in the number of suppliers used by the buying organisations; a deepening of the relationship with the remaining suppliers and an increased “blurring of the boundaries” between the two parties.","inCitations":["8155d2b74b54908676dc6741f80abc9a18f1a471","4db2a480a36f2bfa9e143feb1922caac97536dcd","f2f4552df2bd37f138ff614a64f9b8773f5ba835","5df3f4f5a3a0dc3fd199c099b4df601f074b1def","0ee7e6e74b317ed9685314aa5dc1d250ac7e61e1","0531d6dcb5eb95027f5e10ae57a3ddc0e07d1038","edcd1de90927bacfd573f6c5995249f274c39dcc","baf88434df7c609bce56ce4716bdd791f3daeb60","16d1968316a5287ffa10410078c1ee6bfbd6ab1a","a82ca7172690a063fbe6d6f5c17f36810c5d92ae","1aa153617d0c5e5825fb3ed23d79ab28e1ab7be5","55566a5cdff76bde3dac4df1d5a116a68d9eaa27","b7e75ab543ddfc66d8255d4eeee39fce99613faf"],"pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1108/17410390410566733"],"title":"The impact of e-marketplaces on dyadic buyer-supplier relationships: evidence from the healthcare sector","doi":"10.1108/17410390410566733","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1108/17410390410566733","venue":"J.

In this paper, it is found that the m-step generalization of the block Lanczos method enhances parallel properties by forming in simultaneous search direction vector blocks. QR factorization, which lowers the speed on parallel computers, is not necessary in the m-step block Lanczos method. The m-step method has the minimized synchronization points, which resulted in the minimized global communications and main memory access compared to the standard methods.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Efficient m-step Generalization of Iterative Methods","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Guru hanya menggunakan metode ceramah, terjemah, dan hafalan bukan dengan praktek langsung menggunakan media sehingga menimbulkan kebosanan pada siswa. Bahwasannya media pembelajaran mempunyai peranan yang sangat penting dalam proses belajar mengajar, karena disamping dapat menarik perhatian siswa, juga dapat menyampaikan pesan yang ingin disampaikan pada mata pelajaran. Metode pembelajaran bahasa arab sangat tepat menggunakan metode langsung (al-thariqah al-mubasyirah) untuk meningkatkan keterampilan berbicara Bahasa Arab di SD Bahrul Ulum Putat Jaya Sawahan Surabaya. Penelitian ini merupakan PTK (penelitian tindakan kelas) yang bertujuan untuk mendeskripsikan penerapan metode langsung (al-thariqah al-mubasyirah) dalam pembelajaran bahasa arab dan meningkatkan keterampilan berbicara (maharatul kalam) kelas V setelah menggunakan metode langsung (al-thariqah al-mubasyirah). Penelitian bersifat kualitatif deskriptif, pengambilan data dilakukan dengan mengadakan tes sebelum diterapkan metode langsung dan tes setelah diterapkan metode langsung, pengamatan (observasi), wawancara dan dokumentasi untuk melengkapi data yang ingin diungkap. Analisis data dilakukan dengan pengamatan terhadap proses pembelajaran menggunakan metode langsung sebagai upaya meningkatkan keterampilan berbicara (maharatul kalam) melalui tindakan yang dilakukan. Adapun urutan kegiatan penelitian yaitu: (1) perencanaan, (2) penerapan (3) pengamatan dan (4) refleksi. Hasil penelitian menunjukkan adanya peningkatan keterampilan siswa, aktivitas siswa dalam kegiatan belajar mengajar (KBM) mengalami peningkatan pada observasi siklus I 61,71% menjadi 82, 14% pada siklus II, dengan demikian aspek tersebut mengalami peningkatan sebesar 20,43%. Selain itu dapat dibuktikan melalui hasil tes lisan (sebelum menggunakan metode langsung dan setelah menggunakan metode langsung). Pada waktu sebelum menggunakan metode langsung memiliki rata- rata 44,16, pada waktu siklus I memiliki rata-rata 59,26 dan siklus II memiliki rata-rata 79. Persentase kelulusan siswa mengalami peningkatan, sebelum menggunakan metode langsung 26,19%, pada siklus I 52,38% dan siklus II meningkat menjadi 83,33%.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Peningkatan Keterampilan Berbicara Siswa Materi Hiwar Pelajaran Bahasa Arab Dengan Metode Langsung Di Kelas V Sd Bahrul Ulum Putat Jaya Sawahan Surabaya","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}
