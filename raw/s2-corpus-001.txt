Traditional review articles have recently been criticized on the basis of their incompleteness and susceptibility to bias. Such biases can be minimized by employing a systematic approach to gathering, combining and interpreting the evidence of treatment efficacy. Using eight predetermined quality criteria, we compared the quality of 10 traditional review with one systematic review of treatments for postherpetic neuralgia, which were identified from the Medline database for 1992-96. None of the 10 traditional review articles satisfied all eight criteria: one satisfied five, two satisfied four and the rest satisfied two or fewer criteria. There was a wide variation in the recommendations of the authors for the treatment of postherpetic neuralgia, often based on anecdotal evidence and clinical experience. On the other hand, the systematic review fulfilled seven of the eight quality criteria, failing only to discuss future directives. Furthermore, treatment recommendations were made solely on the basis of randomized controlled trials, which are considered to be the gold standard for measuring the benefits of any intervention. The variation in quality and treatment recommendations of traditional reviews is worrying. Systematic reviews should be encouraged in dermatology because they provide a summary of evidence of the effects of dermatological treatments, which has been derived using explicit methods widely accepted within science.","inCitations":["765e58b3d9624e798f48ee1e4d3da562a57732fb","d932c98dd13d3057323f3497a93988543d56121e","9ca62af1e4d8da6519902d9bfc5a652d6a44e4ad","c56e58e9ab44385a8ab5322f4f8261d14855a45c","ef49f4b0770eb5e70a769297875980813076a24b","2c30dd7b69abff5abf308758bed9cba1c31fbad1"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"The management of established postherpetic neuralgia: a comparison of the quality and content of traditional vs. systematic reviews.","doi":"10.1046/j.1365-2133.1998.02315.x","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2133.1998.02315.x","venue":"The British journal of dermatology"}

The scope of this paper is experimental investigation on the effects of the addition of Alpha-alumina nanoparticles to the woven glass / epoxy composite and Araldite 2015 adhesive on the mechanical properties of the composite adhesive bonded joints. In this study, vacuum assisted resin transfer molding was used to fabricate experimental samples and to fabricate composite samples, 6 glass-fiber layers with a surface density of 200 g/m2 were used. The study of the influences of the addition of Alpha-alumina nanoparticles with different weight ratios to glass/epoxy composites suggests that the maximum values of the ultimate strength, elongation, toughness, and Young’s modulus belong to the samples with the weight ratios of 0.43, 1, 1, and 2.1%, respectively. The experimental results from the shear tensile test show that the incorporation of 0.74 wt% of nanoparticles to the adhesive increases the joint strength by about 14%.","inCitations":["ffe40e1e1fe1b3f0c0516b9a2e939df9edbcb16f","851d43c5d01e7edd8b3f836459cc61724dcea7e7","4879519ace56718bbc91fdd78255419bfe09c42c","8f78e41135bacf463e6d983dee72902a16deb7ea","c4e19d51c86b2c1be706edf8c183067084d3c0c6","36ecf95cfecb44c75baec5a7fac3b18e0eca81d8"],"pdfUrls":["https://journals.ut.ac.ir/article_60713_e51ecdbb2277e08e915db0ebb9ce3e20.pdf"],"title":"Composite Adhesive-Bonded Joint Reinforcement by Incorporation of Nano-Alumina Particles","doi":"10.22059/jcamech.2017.223354.124","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.22059/jcamech.2017.223354.124","venue":""}

Deuterium chemisorbed on palladium and rhodium atoms was characterized by 2H NMR peaks with chemical shifts of –12 and –170 ppm, respectively, from monometallic samples under a deuterium pressure of 1 Torr or less. These two characteristic peaks remained for the bimetallic samples and their relative intensities unambiguously revealed the surface composition of the bimetallic crystallites. Deuterium atoms were absorbed or weakly chemisorbed at greater pressures of deuterium. The weakly sorbed deuterium atoms exchanged with the strongly chemisorbed deuterium atoms, indicated by the coalescence of the 2H NMR characteristic peaks of the bimetallic samples. The position of the coalesced peak depended on the composition of the alloy crystallites.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Characterization of supported-palladium catalysts by deuterium NMR spectroscopy","doi":"10.1039/FT9949001157","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1039/FT9949001157","venue":""}

Here, a completely novel methodological approach is presented that produces sweeter tomato fruits but does not have any negative effects on plant growth. Sucrose-induced repression of translation (SIRT), which is mediated by upstream open reading frames (uORFs), was initially reported in Arabidopsis AtbZIP11, a class S basic region leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factor gene. Here, two AtbZIP11 orthologous genes, SlbZIP1 and SlbZIP2, were identified in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum). SlbZIP1 and SlbZIP2 contained four and three uORFs, respectively, in the cDNA 5'-leader regions. The second uORFs from the 5' cDNA end were conserved and involved in SIRT. Tomato plants were transformed with binary vectors in which only the main open reading frames (ORFs) of SlbZIP1 and SlbZIP2, without the SIRT-responsive uORFs, were placed under the control of the fruit-specific E8 promoter. Growth and morphology of the resulting transgenic tomato plants were comparable to those of wild-type plants. Transgenic fruits were approximately 1.5-fold higher in sugar content (sucrose/glucose/fructose) than nontransgenic tomato fruits. In addition, the levels of several amino acids, such as asparagine and glutamine, were higher in transgenic fruits than in wild-type fruits. This was expected because SlbZIP transactivates the asparagine synthase and proline dehydrogenase genes. This 'sweetening' technology is broadly applicable to other plants that utilize sucrose as a major translocation sugar.","inCitations":["67c673457e8908601000aa6c6a80a5b419d6ecf3","13e69af270501b262859bfa90b6a7c581c23d30e","45ad0d34de6214a428e1ace9b4c3f2194fbcddca","af9d06274f30e2a68390dcf199991843ecaf91c1","9a53951b70b1a3f7c869755522bd618b2f5c908f","7f994d655dc74a10e46b20c0ebad022c751e2a46","e2060255e3f48267be825fa21e99ca2927a8d4cd","b1fb6ce9ecc4df164a2ab9930cc9610ce0245407","8b752241a65bdd128d8140df87f9c7be57443dd9","10398437ea8f66c470b093e12aac02ca3fc73ae7","457f1c02adf92f6188f97ae99dcb3d52a7d02d74","f9e221b2b7932a67b1d4343160647ddd2bdf54ba","37cb256a42990d1fdfc3f5faa7fc7f9803d7e55b","c0e80c75ec06f1cc7c60ee0c23e63e5bafd27f85"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"A novel strategy to produce sweeter tomato fruits with high sugar contents by fruit-specific expression of a single bZIP transcription factor gene.","doi":"10.1111/pbi.12480","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1111/pbi.12480","venue":"Plant biotechnology journal"}

We aimed to investigate the factors associated with post-EST bleeding in patients treated with anticoagulants.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThe data of patients who underwent EST at 15 hospitals between July 2015 and June 2017 were extracted. We investigated the incidence of post-EST bleeding and risk factors for bleeding in patients treated with anticoagulants.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOne hundred forty-nine patients undergoing EST who met the inclusion criteria were included in this study. The total-EST bleeding (bleeding occurring during or after EST) rate did not differ between the heparin replacement (8.0%, 6/75) and continuation (16.6%, 2/12; p=0.37) groups of warfarin users. The total-EST-bleeding rate in the heparin replacement group (12.9%, 4/31) was significantly higher than that in the continuation group (0% (0/31) (p=0.016) in direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) users. The rate of total-EST bleeding with continuation of DOAC (0%, 0/31) was significantly lower with continuation of warfarin (16.6%, 2/12) (0.021). During-EST bleeding (bleeding occurring during EST) (p=0.0083) and precut (p=0.033) were significant risk factors for post-EST bleeding in all 149 patients. Heparin replacement was only a significant risk factor for total-EST bleeding (p=0.033) in DOAC users.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nHeparin replacement was a significant risk factor for post-EST bleeding in DOAC users; however, there was no significant difference between the bleeding rate of heparin replacement and that of continuation groups in patients taking warfarin. During-EST and precut were significant risk factors for post-EST bleeding in all patients treated with anticoagulants.","inCitations":["163e1bbb101d50f4302290ee3f7c53ac380dc4d4"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Comparison of Anticoagulants and Risk Factors for Bleeding following Endoscopic Sphincterotomy among Anticoagulant Users: Results from a Large Multicenter Retrospective Study.","doi":"10.1111/jgh.14764","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1111/jgh.14764","venue":"Journal of gastroenterology and hepatology"}

The fluid phase is simulated using WCSPH method, while the structural dynamics are solved using TLSPH method. Fluid and solid components of the method are validated separately. A sloshing water tank problem is solved to test the WCSPH method while oscillation of a thin plate and large deformation of a cantilever beam are simulated to test the TLSPH method. After validating each component, the coupled WC-TL SPH scheme is used to simulate two benchmark hydroelastic problems. The first test case shows the evolution of water column with an elastic boundary gate, and the second one investigates the breaking water column impact on elastic structures. The agreement between WC-TL SPH results and literature data shows the ability of the proposed method in simulating hydroelastic phenomena.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://myweb.sabanciuniv.edu/meyildiz/files/2017/04/FSI_WCTL_v01_zeta_20170420_mk1.pdf"],"title":"A coupled WC-TL SPH method for simulation of hydroelastic problems","doi":"10.1080/10618562.2017.1324149","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1080/10618562.2017.1324149","venue":""}

Although rules governing most evidentiary issues are contained in the Federal Rules of Evidence, there are no rules governing individual privileges. Instead, Rule 501 provides that privileges be developed under the common law. In fact, through case law development, the federal courts have recognized most of the privileges applicable in the states. This book sets out rules based on a survey of the federal case law, with gaps filled in by reference to the privilege rules originally proposed to Congress and the Uniform Rules of Evidence. These \"survey rules\" do not have the authority of law, but they are intended to be accurate statements of how the federal courts are likely to resolve evidentiary issues.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Evidentiary Privileges in Federal Courts - Survey Rules","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

The new method requires the user to provide a script that will be run as the \"executable\" with the \"(jobtype=single)\" RSL attribute.

After 5 d of incubation 75% of the protoplasts were viable. During incubation they underwent vacuolation and produced the carob endosperm hydrolases, a-galactosidase and endo-β-mannanase, which were secreted in the incubation medium. The secretion of both enzymes were under Ca 2+ control. Many characteristics of α-galactosidase and endo-β-mannanase production by protoplasts were the same as those of whole endosperms : their production did not require any hormonal signal and was inhibited in the presence of ABA or the leachate from the carob endosperm/seed coat. Moderate water stress (-2.0 MPa) neither affected the activity of these hydrolases nor their secretion by endosperm protoplast. However, when the osmoticum of protoplast incubation medium was higher, the production and secretion of both hydrolases were reduced. Comparison of the hydrolases activities in the incubation media of leached carob endosperms, which were incubated under normal and water stress (-1.5 MPa) conditions, with the activities of the protoplast-secreted hydrolases indicated that (i) carob endosperm cell wall acts as a barrier for the secreted enzymes and (ii) that water stress reduces the cell wall porosity of the carob endosperm cells, and thus the release of the secreted α-galactosidase and endo-β-mannanase is inhibited. The isolation of carob endosperm protoplasts offers a potent experimental system for the study of aspects of endosperm cell physiology, such as enzyme secretion.","inCitations":["61abdc7a8f54819204aa5f602e6c44721a945757","7bee7522d8437a66ceadee1d6a4d92acd2abdbf7","d76b840dd6fde54ca04872567b2470945024f272","096792cc729d3b797f38c7cd3e56c0f796ca87ec","4bc6ec9843ccd72a48a2461562f947722c17588b","487c9fa0c8a84fb3fe643eaa39d3fbfda5acd760","0d250153687fda00a9b8222f38dee917f795fbd4"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Production and secretion of α-galactosidase and endo-β-mannanase by carob (Ceratonia siliqua L.) endosperm protoplasts","doi":"10.1093/jxb/46.5.577","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1093/jxb%2F46.5.577","venue":""}

a global phenomenon. People aged 65 years and older comprise approximately 16% of the population of Europe. The medical management of elderly patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is challenging with respect to diagnosis, pharmaceutical and surgical treatment, and complications. IBD has a late onset in 10%-15% of patients, with the first flare occurring at 60 to 70 years of age; others suffer from the disease for several decades. Even though the natural course of the disease in geriatric populations and the diagnostic options may not differ much from those in younger patients, distinct problems exist in the choice of medical therapy. Recommended clinical practise has been rapidly evolving towards an intensified initial treatment in IBD. However, in patients older than 65 years, a gentler approach should be used, and a combination of immunosuppressive agents should be avoided because of increased risk of infectious and neoplastic complications. Furthermore, elderly patients with severe IBD show prolonged, complicated post-operative clinical courses with worse hospital outcomes, so early surgical intervention for elderly patients is recommended. This article provides an overview of elderly IBD patient care, including medical and surgical therapeutic considerations and emphasises the necessity of close collaborations between gastroenterologists and surgeons.","inCitations":["4a25a47b65acc6aea4f10289f004c99908d88360","d737ac31924cad20674af612f84c467f0e9d32ac","4a187bb634e7146b59245a72322b791600a0606f","9ae33916036f3399b763b2edc158b2f654eab6d1","7634ad51b6318e1ad74fec4e727d5482eee611bd","d61389e8286379e0cf1329f5a9d7cbac4589a859","113abf62f5b1662984173a35b14ead99d2ce5724","ef47f3d24bfa59318e6fd5bb2be98038317dc0d6","e450d43ef0f78e9340b4cd137ef571a79e920e26","1e8f2edd4007e033ee4521b6b3a73485c5e56d0e","ee4150665c9238b41d2ee806cd8ee2fb009c09f5","30078fb7673992efc8200012d20c70ee82683fe1","d78e1437e07b5b67c9dc53331c83e4bdfc09da54","e7d02cadb9f85aa0ce63833314f40b73d68e1aea","9d1fcd0ebc59428a04f2b951907ca68660ec8891","cf4f49f42464ee6a42dfc383297c519ca5f80c1d","d0f3c731ec28f7fa35bcd8395c98242e51fe1d51","41433d6e01e2dbfa85741624edd0510c17705050","40bd763d81af2ca1692a6a96e756d388fbd29eed","9c36c82a0943d0aa4ac69ee08e448dcefe75a418","bc1ea72a558adf3465a9cde55f2c034e623d7226","f144944f004a0f70c2d21114c763c6b7d5a39d4e","eebfb986fa45e59d5ac99a37e19cd852e9940786","2947e84870672cc9bb458756d8ad41a0ad4d9411","4d25c1ac436c2d9839aff662540e9a04d2b95f71","b8423e897ac31cc6e94decc47b4efb43d8e4a2a1","fb69d4f8c16b002dbed44cb3d6ae7aa81634c42b","90c0658f8d0ed76c69a6d965970c8f48642dc77b","52935a2f761617216a72da63387b3ca758aee370","3db427ab002e38b8d199ca86ad50eb99928170d6","a5c372fe4e9d0e70cdbbaba3f10952d42cc9533f"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Medical and surgical therapy of inflammatory bowel disease in the elderly - prospects and complications.","doi":"10.1016/j.crohns.2011.02.001","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.crohns.2011.02.001","venue":"Journal of Crohn's & colitis"}

The oxygen potentials of the melts were also measured by an EMF method. The miscibility gap between oxide and sulfide was illustrated as a function of oxygen potential. The solubility of sulfur in the CaO-SiO2-FeOX slag determined from the phase relations increased with the increase of basicity of the slag. The interaction between sulfur and oxygen in the CaO-SiO2-FeOX system has been discussed, and the following equation is derived as log P02 = log P°02 - 0.096 (mass%S) + 0.0052 (mass%S)2(0.8 本文PDF [1249K] Copyright © 2005 by The Mining and Materials Processing Institute of Japan ページトップへ 記事ツール 認証解除アラート URLコピー 著者にメール 書誌事項をダウンロード 問い合わせ この記事を共有 function QBkCJ(){ var s=\"9 メールで知らせる ') 編集・発行 : 一般社団法人資源・素材学会 制作・登載者 : 株式会社シーフォース 株式会社東京プリント（Vol.114 No.1-Vol.117 No.1）","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"固体鉄飽和Fe-O-S系融体とCaO-SiO2-FeOX系スラグの相平衡","doi":"10.2473/shigentosozai.121.70","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.2473/shigentosozai.121.70","venue":""}

Many women are motivated to travel solo with the hope to achieve self-discovery and self-development. Nevertheless, they are hesitant to travel on their own because of various constraints as a woman. Therefore, this study aims to explore solo travel experiences (i.e. solo travel exposure and perceived constraints), and how they contribute to the personal development, authentic personality, and self-esteem of females. A quantitative approach was used to achieve the study objectives. Results confirmed the significant influence of solo travel exposure including three key aspects, frequency of making own solo travel arrangements, frequency of traveling solo and solo trip length of time on minimizing women’s solo travel perceived constraints. In addition, this study’s findings supported the influence of solo travel constraints on personal development. The difference between internal (e.g. attitudes and perceptions) and external constraints (e.g. local destinations and local hosts) were found to be critical in determining the level of personal development. Lastly, the positive relationship among personal development, authentic personality and self-esteem were also proven confirming the benefits of solo travel and personal development in forming women’s authentic personality and self-esteem. The findings of this study contribute to current minimal literature on female solo travel experiences, and assist tourism practitioners in tailoring meaningful experiences to facilitate opportunities for females to learn and grow from their solo travel experiences.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://shareok.org/bitstream/handle/11244/321010/NGUYEN_okstate_0664M_15976.pdf?isAllowed=y&sequence=1"],"title":"Investigation into Female Solo Travelers: Solo Travel Exposure and Perceived Constraints, Personal Development, Authentic Personality and Self-Esteem","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Penulis terdorong untuk mengadakan penelitian mengenai pengaruh penggunaan metode yanbu’a dalam peningkatan kemampuan membaca al-Qur’an di TPQ Baitul Muttaqin Mojokerto. \nUntuk mengetahui beberapa permasalahan yang terdapat dalam penelitian tersebut maka dirumuskan beberapa masalah antara lain : 1) apa pengertian dari metode yanbu’a. 2) bagaimana penggunaan metode yanbu’a dalam pembelajaran BTQ di TPQ Baitul Muttaqin Mojokerto. 3) bagaimana pengaruh penggunaan metode yanbu’a terhadap peningkatan kemampuan membaca al-Qur’an di TPQ Baitul Muttaqin Mojokerto. \nMetode yang digunakan dalam pengumpulan data adalah metode observasi, interview, dokumentasi, serta angket. Dan untuk metode analisisnya metode yang digunakan adalah metode penelitian kuantitatif, yakni metode yang menggunakan rumus-rumus statistik yang sesuai dengan permasalahan yang ada. Karena penelitian ini berusaha untuk mmgetahui pengaruh antara penggunaan metode yanbu’a dan kemampuan membaca santri, maka sesuai dengan rumus statistic menggunakan rumus regresi linier.. \nDan hasil penelitian diperoleh Fhitung sebesar 14, 845 dengan signifikansi 0,005 sedangkan Ftabel dengan taraf signifikansi 5% diperoleh Ftabel 4,20. Perbandingan antara keduanya menghasilkan Fhitung > Ftabel atau 14,845 > 4,20 dengan signifikansi (0,005) < α (0,5). Dengan demikian penguji menunjukkan menerima Ha. \nArtinya penggunaan metode yanbu’a terhadap peningkatan kemampuan membaca al- Qur’an di TPQ Baitul Muttaqin Mojokerto mempunyai pengaruh terhadap peningkatan kemampuan membaca al-Qur’an.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Pengaruh Penggunaan Metode Yanbu’a Terhadap Peningkatan Kemampuan Membaca Al-qur’an Di Tpq Baitul Muttaqin Mojokerto","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Experimental results are presented and compared to a classical hydrodynamic model, which is moreover criticized. We observe that the friction coefficient decreases during the lapping process and when the viscosity of the lubricant goes down.

Isohydric plants are those that close their stomata when they sense a drop in soil water potential, or an increase in the atmospheric demand. On the contrary, anisohydric plants continue to transpire even when soil water content diminishes, because of a poor stomatal adjustment capacity. As consequence, their leaf water potential (Ψ L ) falls and the plant suffers increasing stress. In general, grapevine is considered a water stress avoidant species, with a tight stomatal control. However, some varieties have shown a more efficient stomatal control than others. This encouraged researchers to classify grapevine varieties as isohydric or anisohydric. At present, this classification is under great controversy, as many of the varieties that initially were classified under one behaviour, have shown opposite performances under different climatic, edaphic and growth conditions. Consequently, many authors believe that this classification among grapevine varieties may not be completely clear and accurate. Our study revises, once more, the varietal behaviour of four grapevine varieties, namely Syrah, Grenache, Malbec and Chardonnay, under mild water stress conditions; and tries to determine which behaviour confers best stress tolerance. We intended to determine whether isohydric behaviour results in more tolerance to drought than anisohydric behaviour, as assumed and tried to explain both types of behaviour giving attention to stomatal conductance (g s ); hydraulic conductance (k L ) and vapour pressure deficit (vpd), as postulated by others. /* Style Definitions */ \n table.MsoNormalTable \n {mso-style-name:\"Tabla normal\"; \n mso-tstyle-rowband-size:0; \n mso-tstyle-colband-size:0; \n mso-style-noshow:yes; \n mso-style-parent:\"\"; \n mso-padding-alt:0cm 5.4pt 0cm 5.4pt; \n mso-para-margin:0cm; \n mso-para-margin-bottom:.0001pt; \n mso-pagination:widow-orphan; \n font-size:10.0pt; \n font-family:\"Times New Roman\"; \n mso-ansi-language:#0400; \n mso-fareast-language:#0400; \n mso-bidi-language:#0400;}","inCitations":["d2ba6fac5ec8cfd9d065eb95526af71589fc364b","677df7af103a40ade1aca8acd365ec1ee9902ef4","9a0aa165f54b921e7f44269d62e4277bce58deaf"],"pdfUrls":["https://elearning.unite.it/pluginfile.php/91946/mod_resource/content/1/Isohydric%20or%20anisohydric%20behaviour%20in%20grapevine%E2%80%A6,%20a%20never-ending%20controversy%3F.pdf"],"title":"Isohydric or Anisohydric Behaviour in Grapevine…a Never-ending Controversy?","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

This paper presents evidence that while sudden stops in gross inflows—i.e., a tightening of the external borrowing constraint—are associated with global conditions and therefore, are largely outside of the control of local policymakers, domestic factors such as low levels of liability dollarization, exchange rate flexibility, inflation targeting regimes, and a solid institutional background are important to prevent these episodes from becoming sudden stops in net capital flows. Under these favorable local conditions, domestic investors may perceive reduced risk in bringing in resources at the time of an external shock, thus insulating the country from this shock.","inCitations":["c3f5c0048d56cd7df4f8a441fa5ff4daec079f68"],"pdfUrls":["https://econ.washington.edu/sites/econ/files/documents/cavallo_suddenstops.pdf"],"title":"Domestic Antidotes to Sudden Stops","doi":"10.18235/0000825","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.18235/0000825","venue":""}

In this paper, we focus on companies that are at the tail end of their life cycles and examine how best to value companies with flat and declining revenues and stagnant or dropping profit margins. Since many of these companies also have significant debt burdens, we also evaluate ways to incorporate the possibility of distress and default into value. We argue that conventional discounted cash flow valuations, premised on firms being going concerns, will tend to overstate the value of distressed companies, and suggest ways in which we can correct for the bias.","inCitations":["42582b3af348bf836266826e47b98986f939bbe6","e2d808801110ad5562d1b8f68f177e1fab31bb90","9f45d466db8f08044edfaa3416c95b54f8cee9c8","c6d767fa30e6a39332f60db49e5b762d1ecab00d","096842c870f206dad4796aff519d74d615945c3b","97cf84867ba57eb594b1b95e725b770be90dbc3c","ff0c3f1a494077945305eee2b036a1ff0d28773e"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Valuing Declining and Distressed Companies","doi":"10.2139/ssrn.1428022","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.1428022","venue":""}

Initially, several prodrug candidates were screened based upon boronic ester stability using isobutylboronic acid as a model boronic acid compound. The two most stable candidates were then selected to create surface conjugated bortezomib prodrugs on the liposomes. Our strategy yielded stable liposomal bortezomib nanoparticles with a narrow size range of 100 nm and with high reproducibility. These liposomal bortezomib nanoparticles demonstrated significant proteasome inhibition and cytotoxicity against multiple myeloma cell lines in vitro and remarkable tumor growth inhibition with reduced systemic toxicity compared to free bortezomib in vivo. Taken together, this study demonstrates the incorporation of bortezomib into liposomal nanoparticles via reversible boronic ester bond formation to enhance the therapeutic index for improved patient outcome.","inCitations":["0e2add3b3edb417df4928bd1f91cf3b8913b4ccc","f56d9ad98c8325b6e1ecdcc59ec6d08ed3522fa3","2091297ca89c75324def89b7d049c54c331bbe8d","67f223f4b80fa93aee70c690e06bf373e8ea3817","d547db51f6d52c05d1217bfa350124d17cb360bf","665e4f849311c527f6e65015991ba8d60f34beac","ed66b1ab8d99d9141038e0f4f4d714a74c3b1317","d1e73c92889f65464d292f103947e9eefcca5251","10956a326edc9bdc45bdd55c13a9dd7a9742013d","ef7e43ed2b0ed7c31e0b777f957d5e1b2143dc46","ca676d04af942a21714a2ca8ecfc699333c6d2cc","d42b769e9e72f5544a27b77b67ce261dd529855b","28fcbfcd25fb417b27b7ecfd6a944a1a83b2ba70","03c681bd269dfd1618f11211de9d7107a01c257f","5d62b4b37a09dc1772e7fe5e9505b4f7d46d9e25"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Liposomal bortezomib nanoparticles via boronic ester prodrug formulation for improved therapeutic efficacy in vivo.","doi":"10.1021/jm500352v","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1021/jm500352v","venue":"Journal of medicinal chemistry"}

We evaluated our screening efforts by asking 4 questions: (1) Are the screening participants representative of the target population? (2) How often were screening participants with possible undiagnosed hypertension, high cholesterol, and diabetes identified? (3) How often were screening participants with an elevated risk for developing hypertension, high cholesterol, and diabetes identified? and (4) How often did we identify screening participants with known hypertension, high cholesterol, and diabetes whose disease management was suboptimal? Results from 1757 persons screened were compared to telephone surveys from 16,199 Nashville residents. Those screened were younger and healthier than the target population. Rates of potentially undiagnosed cases among African Americans were 0.8% for diabetes, 17.4% for hypertension, and 32.7% for high cholesterol. High-risk individuals were identified 13.1% of the time for diabetes, 45.3% of the time for hypertension, and 21.3% of the time for total cholesterol. Rates of poorly controlled known disease were 23.5% for diabetes, 39.0% for hypertension, and 58.2% for total cholesterol. Although we reached a younger and healthier group than the community population, community-based screenings identified many people with potential health risks. We present a model of how to organize and implement successful community-based screening.","inCitations":["048c07db81769ac4f9fa6908d6f11a9b7e98d963","4c5516c1d3fce03bf7e098fa81a0ca77d9534933","00dd2714e550e756e3e02acec61c941aaebd6867","ea67455b73626aea016ebd8af1195ee71203e1af","cee15b4e69ef6f8749f452167bca2e41c79e16a3","84c8c1b515b17046cff2681f7a1706921fdbe76e"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"An evaluation of the Nashville REACH 2010 community health screening strategy.","doi":"10.1097/00004479-200604000-00008","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1097/00004479-200604000-00008","venue":"The Journal of ambulatory care management"}

To become a skilled practitioner of EUS it takes time, effort, dexterity, patience, and perseverance. Eventually, the most serious students of EUS become proficient; EUS exams can be carried out with a high level of accuracy and in a timely manner. Most EUS exams correctly identify relevant structures, both normal and pathologic, but even the most experienced endosonographer can miss key findings during an exam. This is a difficult realization for most of us but it is nonetheless true and recognition of the limitations of EUS, both operatorand technologydependent, can help to minimize errors or missed lesions. EUS-fine needle aspiration (FNA), for all of its value, it also not a perfect procedure and has limitations.[1]","inCitations":["dab30b4f9558160fb9c53918966dbd29b2c3a1ad","cd658a1392c35d980f6801b6aa1c9211871c0bc8","ad72bc7a2d3f8f9a8b08c565476715fcf9c52d9d"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Missed lesions in endoscopic ultrasound","doi":"10.4103/2303-9027.162993","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.4103/2303-9027.162993","venue":"Endoscopic ultrasound"}

To examine the effects of CasR deficiency on the skeleton, we performed a detailed analysis of the skeleton in CasR knockout mice (CasR(-/-)) and wild-type littermates (CasR(+/+)). CasR ablation in the parathyroid glands of CasR(-/-) mice resulted in hyperparathyroidism, hypercalcemia, and hypophosphatemia. Except for dwarfism, the expected skeletal manifestations of PTH excess, namely chondrodysplasia and increased mineralized bone formation and resorption, were not the main skeletal features in CasR(-/-) mice. Rather, rickets was the predominant skeletal abnormality in these animals, as evidenced by a widened zone of hypertrophic chondrocytes, impaired growth plate calcification and disorderly deposition of mineral, excessive osteoid accumulation, and prolonged mineralization lag time in metaphyseal bone. CasR transcripts were identified in cartilage and bone marrow of CasR(+/+) mice, but not in mineralized bone containing mature osteoblasts and osteocytes. These findings indicate that a calcium-sensing receptor is present in the skeleton, and its absence results in defective mineralization of cartilage and bone by mechanisms that remain to be elucidated.","inCitations":["9c3a06ab7672cfa2a2f32b914f465beac1ff0f3c","44f681948f9305fce6c2e8d909799bb88cd9f277","52af18a2fdcf38d8508692fbdb4ab994366d75e8","28d99861f490b53a9a00571ea25f21a849b1593d","1d201e34331e30e2f8cdabbc13828db30f04db59","62db921dea0b4ac5e52e2fcef19f86c0664195a4","0405b442c8c77909a551396c4ee003a4c7839359","dd8b4d17977d003fb51975e11145ae5262b46f53","6ee02f21387eefd3718627e1f30a74fb9d9d4424","4f18845cd5a1a7d2114bbcbd51c4279658928531","dff0fcce79f4ed4c72bb567240473f49111e8d33","d33c041614773a8c8f5745fcf3c044eb4c4e18f4","74ab871be7cee503cd1e7890ad84118470a1820e","4ec2754898c03436e53d6f659c6309757c6fd1d5","ffde3824c9c1e106b649f548dbf252e6fc17a965","d4ce34b7365e32bc84d55cfcaf000817c1d43350","1443dac50049109ae1640a7127c3aa0d25614901","8ba2a754caba8a75368a94c0db2f7fadd461bd01","890f790e67c577505e9a92e334e810d857732145","fe9cffee78cd5e31cd05dbd9cbb49292023745cb","d470350684dd213f7b16229c6a6a24ade0c3d796","c3315e62e541649f2ef0d4cb2a189e31e1007b22","94f8396725ddca53d6db7e358898afab8867b5cf","01172054a30280bcf1a02f0a06e5d66b0018d906","78910c49bf7d37a14d15fd989ebbe02d285c39f5","b3370c1cbd668ae271caed65fedae815bd7dbe02","8a02912104d77bb5903680eadaa38aa68756eece","e33943e099e50c8847548c7ecfa6170fdf67aa44","81ab8654bf22ca3d18f084df88a5622245ec02c5","7f980dde1c2af635a44eb8c0fb018d90eda806da","57e7708accada1e80a45a726ca15c0472aadad95","2958b4635c28274e0c20a7a0f2bfb2eef10ed4d9","aa80818af10f2878840dc6532ffb00a05a68d8f3","659b64846689d43b8d183a439141853ba61ecfe9","9b9582afa2b398062de5187656e9828706d07ada","36aaebc4792929706f99c0365bae2db4f2843c3d","c91e45a740c5c6d240f1f675303f235235be59dd","c77f948e42769965ecf653d855be4a75350800a5","646a0159cc6fa0499f3e7ed0802a19d7339c961e","76f9d604b9d239bee035cf6c44cf4276e1cb1e95","1127be14eed34b9b3228210839abfc35447556b8"],"pdfUrls":["http://endo.endojournals.org/content/142/9/3996.full.pdf"],"title":"Rickets in cation-sensing receptor-deficient mice: an unexpected skeletal phenotype.","doi":"10.1210/endo.142.9.8364","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1210/endo.142.9.8364","venue":"Endocrinology"}

Patients and methods: 51 patients were enrolled on this Phase II Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) study. Seventy five percent of them had hormonally active tumors. Treatment consisted of IFNγ subcutaneously at a daily dose of 0.1 mg/m2. Patents were evaluated for toxicity weekly for the first month and monthly thereafter; response was determined radiologically every 8 weeks. Results: Patients received treatment with IFNγ for a median of 17.9 weeks (range 2–175). Toxicity was generally mild and expected: 61% experienced noninfected fever and 21% developed granulocytopenia. Three patients (6%) had a partial response; there were no complete responses. Median time to progression was 5.5 months (95% confidence interval 3.9–11.1). The 1-year progression free rate was 28% (13.4–43.4%). Median survival was 42 months, with a 1-year survival rate of 67% (53.3–80%). Discussion: This Phase II study demonstrated that therapy with IFNγ in patients with metastatic carcinoid tumor was well-tolerated, but did not produce significant antitumor effects. The overall results were somewhat comparable to those previously seen with alpha interferons as well as cytotoxic drugs.","inCitations":["aa575268603e28d4511f5876f94ee71335ca9407","4ab506b5f98baec5f8d8c6c734fc410b4921348d","9fb72c936c1c1bc313f8f8697ed814581e6743ee","9b42242cdecb884883a1f77b458076ed9b143920","5adad1e90adb5635148a578683eeae73ec56310a","121681dc8f8815cb0431745fc7cb643a41678cb1","e4a80f855c325c0289fc4709e0d82d5bdc1680b7","4dc3cc45a3095432b8fee459bcfad40f9c80b9de","7906c886958e3e9d94d0ed75a0c58cbe6879a0f5","1f9cc3f7b66be9a09847641a7de3acba4eae9d4f","5bdf4184f130c0cb7a0dd190f4aa9605d63ca064","8f9120c1a283dfd84ba65a055321b2175922367f"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Phase II Study of Interferon Gamma in Malignant Carcinoid Tumors (E9292): A Trial of the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group","doi":"10.1023/B:DRUG.0000006177.46798.1f","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1023/B%3ADRUG.0000006177.46798.1f","venue":"Investigational New Drugs"}

The contaminations such as slurry residues due to the absence of the exclusive cleaning chemicals are enough to influence on the degradation of PZT thin film capacitors. The surface characteristics of PZT thin film were investigated by the change of process parameters and the cleaning process. Both the low CMP pressure and the cleaning process must be employed, even if the removal rate and the yield were decreased, to reduce the fatigue of PZT thin film capacitors fabricated by damascene process. Like this, fatigue characteristics were partially controlled by the regulation of the CMF process parameters in PZT damascene process.

Cell physiology","paperAbstract":"Oxidative stress or reduced expression of naturally occurring antioxidants during aging has been identified as a major culprit in neuronal cell/tissue degeneration. Peroxiredoxin (Prdx) 6, a protective protein with GSH peroxidase and acidic calcium-independent phospholipase A2 activities, acts as a rheostat in regulating cellular physiology by clearing reactive oxygen species (ROS) and thereby optimizing gene regulation. We found that under stress, the neuronal cells displayed reduced expression of Prdx6 protein and mRNA with increased levels of ROS, and the cells subsequently underwent apoptosis. Using Prdx6 fused to TAT transduction domain, we showed evidence that Prdx6 was internalized in human brain cortical neuronal cells, HCN-2, and mouse hippocampal cells, HT22. The cells transduced with Prdx6 conferred resistance against the oxidative stress inducers paraquat, H2O2, and glutamate. Furthermore, Prdx6 delivery ameliorated damage to neuronal cells by optimizing ROS levels and overstimulation of NF-κB. Intriguingly, transduction of Prdx6 increased the expression of endogenous Prdx6, suggesting that protection against oxidative stress was mediated by both extrinsic and intrinsic Prdx6. The results demonstrate that Prdx6 expression is critical to protecting oxidative stress-evoked neuronal cell death. We propose that local or systemic application of Prdx6 can be an effective means of delaying/postponing neuronal degeneration.","inCitations":["454fad94ce25f79abde2c748602cefd2f03c58b9","32868e49e6a72b237903aef27ff8bdcffa093e0a","0e92d838d40f791f555f804e4ff4141aafe74753","229244f82e9345ac73c8fb93dcd041358992a074","e6d9a85dbeb706fa9c41ed8d05d9c3524eeea9c9","e27362a86d38d46f5b9d08f66877eda5fe72848c","bd71408b05a56911b3a60471a13c7dd0c3582f6d","a9db9d726827433eefd2ef0f807fa317a58823ef","4c3e4039c432de0af2169ab368e80226170e68cf","ee33abd135d2bc116a394cd6ec648254f05801ca","dd7e9fd3b047e718f25d3b54469925461b56ae9c","9115ac75c1881ab19d9745b061c922fa3b93906c","8503831891cea3d0e971c7b2994e3acd9bc86a2b","1e113d534ad157c94dcf08da976a1caafcd0db31","a2702cf0b8292dd1dd79523741e0393ce7045344","38bb1023bd72f4d6885342c34f58ade345bdc996","d9b4b857366b95ecf46c1264b7cd250fad663be2","87c76b948b7a65789b0d45f117f33084090c0bd2","b0502d984c97f9c5fc1fdaadebf3865ae8f42c3f","fa13644ca026c1a150e8474373a905aacee63328","383e2c383b5c6ecf00e6bef0b3c86fae2c606386","f00414920c17ad7415bb4c8710733fe2c69f783b","a48cbc888df3783ae52244c9320827682640c2bb","e0a16d42607055e2a2bc9a0b13269b0a0e13f8ee","bb1895bac92903defb5e0d37fe48a32783e7ceeb","95fe0a7c435b223b8ed0778ed2dd385b4c9336bc","9a234fe207901d38ea20fa28bf098167c327d022","9aa285051edde44a3c83e0158b085467be35c9b5","c839a44b464d996cf66ce20131b451cc07e48bb4","4893cbdb51c4a19cd299d8b450306a1ff8ec2e21","2f2ee13eeb953d591faeb44460b779f7bd3e5be4","a77be8329d13a9d5c3a4ebb21f4359fc3d9f5ac4","4b2360682099597314c629264036563be9881531"],"pdfUrls":["http://ajpcell.physiology.org/content/ajpcell/310/1/C1.full.pdf"],"title":"Delivery of a protein transduction domain-mediated Prdx6 protein ameliorates oxidative stress-induced injury in human and mouse neuronal cells.","doi":"10.1152/ajpcell.00229.2015","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1152/ajpcell.00229.2015","venue":"American journal of physiology.

The preparation of two previous documents aspiring to become a National SDS has passed nearly unobserved out of the environmental community. The paper thus summarizes basic events of all three attempts with a special emphasis on processes and involved institutions. Partial conclusions point out key aspects of the path. Then several policymaking frameworks are used to compare the three attempts in order to identify the causes of such evolution and to gather a wider background of the preparation and implementation of the SDS. An overall costs estimation is provided. Such approach reveals that the process of preparation of a strategy tends to stop in the early stages as the task is often considered accomplished with the adoption of a written document. Therefore the implementation potential of such strategy is one of the most neglected at all. The essential efforts in the near future should focus on leadership and communication. 1. Sustainable Development Strategies: Three Attempts 1.1 SDS.1 (1998 – 2001) Between 1998 and 2001, the Charles University Environment Center has run a four-year project “Towards Sustainability: The Czech Republic. Building National Capacities for Sustainable Development“. The project was supported by UNDP through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and aimed to enhance the capacity of Czech institutions and citizens to understand, analyse, evaluate and promote ideas and principles of sustainable development. Main “customer” of project outputs was the Ministry of Environment. Head of the Centre and former Minister of the Environment appointed an interdisciplinary realization team of around 40 experts with diverse disciplinary and institutional background – there were representatives of academic institutions, NGO’s, private sector, organizations financed from the state budget and independent experts. The team dealt with seven sub projects: • Sustainable development analysis of the state of natural resources and environment • Institutional dimensions for ensuring sustainable development in the Czech Republic as a context for a new version of the State Environmental Policy • Integration of sustainable development principles into selected policies • Local Agenda 21 and regional development • Education and consciousness making in sustainable development issues • Sustainable development indicators • Building capacities for an active role of the Czech Republic within international effort in achieving sustainable character of economic and civilization development Outputs of the project can be sorted in three main groups: • Activities in the field of education, networking and promotion, such as support to a Legislative centre within an environmental NGO, networking of teachers from universities and secondary schools dealing with sustainable development issues, participation on some regional and local activities. • Expert and scientific studies. • Synthetic document „Proposition of a National Sustainable Development Strategy“ The last output was intended to be a consensual proposal for the government. 1.1.1 SDS.1: Process of Making Until April 2001, part of the above-mentioned 40 members realization team prepared SDS.1. After a consensus on its structure and content was achieved within the team, SDS.1 first draft was sent in May 2001 to around 100 institutional and individual representatives of public administration at national and local level, politicians, NGO ́s, universities and private sector with a request for comments that could enhance the quality and complexity of the document. A “live” feedback was made possible one month later at a one-day seminar, which provided some important inputs for the SDS.1 draft. Second draft was then presented in September 2001 within a seminar organized by the Government Council for Social and Economic Strategies (RASES). The SDS.1 draft was again subject to several comments but as a whole it was recommended to be presented at government meeting and to become a support document for the Czech delegation to Johannesburg summit on sustainable development in 2002. The realization team still assumed that the draft could be adopted in short time by the government as a national policy. In November 2001, Ministry of Environment, the major “customer” of the UNDP project, organized a wider consultation where several crucial comments appeared: the SDS.1 draft was not perceived as a strategy but just as an academic study with two non-interlinked parts – a SWOT analysis and a tentative set of indicators. Furthermore the draft concentrated mostly on environmental issues and dealt very little with social and economic pillars of sustainable development and concerned only selected partial policies. The Ministry of Environment thus decided to prepare within few months a document that would be worth of a label of a “National sustainable development strategy” so that the document could be presented at Johannesburg summit in mid-2002 as a relevant public policy basis. In between, in December 2001, the SDS.1 draft was presented at a closing conference of the UNDP project where sustainable development was divided into four topics:","inCitations":["03667a0c20c0c4e3d7c93b3c66ddf850d9d3c639"],"pdfUrls":["http://unpan1.un.org/intradoc/groups/public/documents/nispacee/unpan022170.pdf"],"title":"Sustainable Development Strategy of the Czech Republic : Third Attempt .

Design.-After institutional review board approval at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue from 32 patients who underwent a maximally safe neurologic resection during 2004 to 2005 for GBM (World Health Organization criteria) was obtained. We performed immunohistochemical staining on the vessels of the GBM specimens for PSMA expression in tumor endothelium. The tissue samples were also stained for CD31 to verify that the PSMA was staining tumor vessels. The PSMA percent staining was scored: less than 5%, 6% to 25%, 26% to 50%, 51% to 75%, and 76% to 100%. Staining intensity was ranked as follows: 0 (none), 1+ (faint), 2+ (moderately-intense), and 3+ (maximum-intensity).\n\n\nRESULTS\nImmunohistochemical staining on the vessels of 32 paraffin-embedded GBM specimens revealed that all 32 (100%) specimens exhibited staining for PSMA to a variable extent. Of these, 22 of 32 specimens (69%) had more than 51% vascular staining for PSMA. The intensity of staining was 2+ to 3+ in most of the specimens (29 of 32; 91%).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nProstate-specific membrane antigen is expressed in the vasculature of GBM vessels, thus rendering a potential novel therapeutic vascular target. A clinical trial with a cytotoxin-conjugated antibody to PSMA is planned.","inCitations":["0fe41abf22acd7995e10cace18dacf4ffa56cb4f","9698ff754bf7fa567c4963b2f950399a85a30e08","98763d7a2f5557739451cebdb81448aa57f4bf1e","73e36ba9e34888c015749d605c8de90570e1c19d","3427be31b43eb36c36761334bcb96dfdd8e7bc80","29456029c4a8f5266d6d5f77abbff40c7e097ca5","1639432f2dc5b24985d9a6b26f78c5adc74bb45b","767209fceaa11fafe25f8b70e43eceea504980b7","b0482aee09f8ebea85a617a3263129a44f849f9c","aea1cebecf88600c89dfcd7e0c93c948772aad9a","582a60244c41f4f924ebdcb4046630d8d397145f","ff9cd00915fc73f8a5892ddc6c4df3459c8dbef4","12a293e92712134f3a5ef999ff4db9ddd90d2cd1","974295def5928261690b48221d8f7eadaadfc285","a8be417b827fa8a7dc08ab5706d3576382e9741b","5f59f88c8a3dafef4daff227117194b76300aa0e","70ec7afabc817a490b19e335b8eb92c5dea9fa41","6853c214ff62a08cdf14eea6045545648e124663","d3687117ba349df7028e50ecefb8a0a659febc38","e69c96d43b9aa483afdd5f9c1b05f9acdd78ce53","e208221344afa0560a07aee567940ef13baaac9c","d257d0dcf2611213608cc280bc53f09d1495ad5c","399ff261067f44810da330a4a014a4702aff1c5a","29c49c2c62a724e7022ba6db9f6bc54fa4c14581","342a9ec00b660522c25756aac14582a4fb4e9931","af99b33fc612e6735c05847a34df0cc5c914e0ee","bfc9859453ae78da0f70f9526e38cec097d56a56","e5496a12ae5e34cb4cbc7d5e9eabdc2972a8565f","0016551936e709799fba7915209efce4a28e21fd","70b46e72d14ed652bfd8025455c8162bd44c9fe0","0e2288b80eb657c4d571ad659c1a8f1736105025","b0f80c4b5954084075b076735f4170d97c52bde5","8296c8a4cf129cba206ede806ba8c4ad34d0ed10","ac329d86d95e925e776f8b9b2cd6787daa88e113","5c18d83510c5fddedf15f015a9126f6ce2b1f392","f463c3fd9dffd6383335533857b138f2461c777b","c53673151553a43077796923084835690ec59dd5","caea8cadc51feece14748cba52186cc013320c43","06b2994ba03ddbe9a5bd6763f18df2b8b9d4e5f6","36a8429301bb96bfcb76b4bc02b93b4856f33d6b","b05036ab21106ee3a5f1d7779cce3a22d11cd332","4fcd69695a419fdf600fc778ef787bb19489dd35"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Prostate-specific membrane antigen as a potential novel vascular target for treatment of glioblastoma multiforme.","doi":"10.5858/arpa.2010-0740-OA","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.5858/arpa.2010-0740-OA","venue":"Archives of pathology & laboratory medicine"}

Neither computed tomographic scan nor abdominal ultrasound could detect the recurrent lesion, however, cholangioscopy detected mucin and tumor projection into the left hepatic duct. Since the biopsy specimen of the tumor revealed adenocarcinoma, left hepatectomy was performed. The tumor was mucinous adenocarcinoma having the same histology as the primary rectal cancer, with partly mucosal replacement and formation of intraluminal mucus plaque.

Despite its effectiveness in historical arguments, coherence is problematic for epistemologists and some theorists of history. The main purpose of this article is to present some insights that bear upon the logical status of coherence. As will be demonstrated, this will also shed some light on the allegedly dubious epistemological position of coherence. In general I will argue that, logically seen, coherence is a property of a set of related beliefs that makes it possible to justify a choice out of different factually justifiable interpretations. Coherence disambiguates vague or ambiguous observations. As words lose their vagueness or ambiguity in contexts, so do contexts disambiguate historical facts. My argument will be based on some relatively recent findings about the cognitive processes underlying vision and reading. Research in the field of text linguistics is used to show what kinds of relationships exist between historical representations that might be considered to cohere.","inCitations":["dd9c95c7c4526b33d3d74a1aba3783640ad4d8ab"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Coherence and Ambiguity in History","doi":"10.1111/0018-2656.00121","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1111/0018-2656.00121","venue":""}

Data were collected from young, low-income African American mothers (N = 248) during pregnancy and at 4, 12, and 24 months postpartum. Hierarchical Linear Modeling (HLM) analyses revealed that depressive symptoms were highest during pregnancy and declined through 24 months postpartum. Supportive relationships with the father of the baby and the mother's parent figure were related to lower levels of depressive symptoms. Although the association between father support and the mother's depressive symptoms remained consistent over time, support from the parent figure became increasingly more important during the young mother's transition to parenting. Further analyses also revealed that the association between support and depressive symptoms depended on other aspects of these relationships. Greater support from the baby's father was only related to fewer depressive symptoms for mothers who were partnered with the father of the baby. Greater support from the parent figure was only related to fewer depressive symptoms for mothers who were coresiding with the parent. Finally, having a repeat pregnancy during the early postpartum years was related to higher levels of depressive symptoms during the subsequent pregnancy. These findings suggest that screening and interventions for depression in young mothers should begin during pregnancy and include a focus on her proximal social relationships.","inCitations":["b91310b3674a3e7de9c88d3052322df7b851b7d2","f515750a8f3c56818c4856cd43f8951a1ec655cd","d1a4dcdc25db8145e9691e4a911e2da562c1c1ca","71969a1e2014742b7ef1802a669f50526ff6869c","e629a2292053b70606ce336c79e7f117a40ff789","1a49a3c32270ce562d943dd764ceb026dba970df","91543b8187e62ba89d7291ec982ece0c58538832","c41dd73d2b5055ca902d6456c0cb1c93c70ccf33","d27441a10557996251873e6266c7dbe08a7237bf","f2a47117c0653084f39c2289fd5151e3b5c2d1f0","564dae2e10e3327d25c822e7ebe20fc874f1bf74","c710d4dfb24207e1d43572df11119711a334af8f","71c63641c0fcaee9c51b6ac738f37360b4a876d6","2084c18c3ddf1221e7e085d76e323f7938339feb","7d67a8784dfdbb803d93c27891025d594958f763","0bbd436435c389aa36b6b48f7bb24ffb488f8244","97add22e2855a26301c9e2a9f467b2b03baf159b"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Supportive relationships and the trajectory of depressive symptoms among young, African American mothers.","doi":"10.1037/a0029053","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1037/a0029053","venue":"Journal of family psychology : JFP : journal of the Division of Family Psychology of the American Psychological Association"}
