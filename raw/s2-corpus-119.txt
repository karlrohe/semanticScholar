We recently showed that MEIS2 cooperates with the neurogenic transcription factor PAX6 in the control of adult subventricular zone (SVZ) neurogenesis in rodents. Expression of the PBC protein PBX1 in the SVZ has been reported, but its functional role(s) has not been investigated. Using a genetic loss-of-function mouse model, we now show that Pbx1 is an early regulator of SVZ neurogenesis. Targeted deletion of Pbx1 by retroviral transduction of Cre recombinase into Pbx2-deficient SVZ stem and progenitor cells carrying floxed alleles of Pbx1 significantly reduced the production of neurons and increased the generation of oligodendrocytes. Loss of Pbx1 expression in neuronally committed neuroblasts in the rostral migratory stream in a Pbx2 null background, by contrast, severely compromised cell survival. By chromatin immunoprecipitation from endogenous tissues or isolated cells, we further detected PBX1 binding to known regulatory regions of the neuron-specific genes Dcx and Th days or even weeks before the respective genes are expressed during the normal program of SVZ neurogenesis, suggesting that PBX1 might act as a priming factor to mark these genes for subsequent activation. Collectively, our results establish that PBX1 regulates adult neural cell fate determination in a manner beyond that of its heterodimerization partner MEIS2.","inCitations":["784079f7b71ba63cffbb870c17beab2f9647a282","bdf77c02176bfb2cebf3103ddf8ebf9686a602c1","b89dc4b4a6f30f64921f0bbd28f8d266bb274765","37e73fc2acc994cce31e84a5e8ae330c0f615179","5811c7407a7c0ad9a6f4c5ab62ffa467a1a28689","6fa7ab34aa950c4a57244bd2a07c67e085d3848e","c207cf85600279c119d6932dcff4637385987d98","975f1f2e29c3ac9b09b10af559043531e366fca4","0748d70d9dd32e706ee121feb941fc1e10bc0c0e","61308e474dcb4caa649aab97921810575c6d6a24","f30e837e4606f9d1908a9e0b5b48665d4f52d0d8"],"pdfUrls":["https://cloudfront.escholarship.org/dist/prd/content/qt6fj5s8np/qt6fj5s8np.pdf","http://dev.biologists.org/content/develop/143/13/2281.full.pdf"],"title":"Pbx1 is required for adult subventricular zone neurogenesis.","doi":"10.1242/dev.128033","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1242/dev.128033","venue":"Development"}

The analyses were conducted by the means of light microscopy, which is also a powerful tool for stratigraphical analyses, X-ray diffractometry, Raman spectrometry, end electron microanalysis. Hematite of industrial origin was identified as the red pigment, the yellow one was formed by yellow earth, which also may be a precursor for traditional production of red dye. The widest used blue pigment was ultramarine in the 19th and the first half of 20th century in Moravia. The analysed green pigments were formed by an organic dye of green earth and the black one consisted of soot. Based on the sort and composition of pigment and plaster, the age of the material is also discussed.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Plaster Pigments in Traditional Folk Architecture - A Case Study from Moravia (Czech Republic)","doi":"10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMR.1000.289","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.4028/www.scientific.net%2FAMR.1000.289","venue":""}

However, differentiation of the results of these processes in MCL has been a difficult task, largely due to the microcrystalline nature of these rocks. In this study the authors report the presence, in modern lime muds and ancient MCL, of microfenestral pores which are potentially useful in distinguishing early cementation from compaction. Detailed SEM investigation of polished, etched sections of modern lime muds shows that these microfenestrae range from 2 to 30 /mu/m in diameter and are commonly not recognizable in thin section. Microfenestrae are not facies dependent; they are found in both calcite and aragonite-dominated lime muds from both shallow (supratidal to subtidal) and deep-marine environments. Microfenestrae in ancient MCL are recognizable as cement-filled regions, similar in size and shape to microfenestral pores in modern lime mud. SEM examination of their experimentally compacted modern lime muds shows that very little compaction (as low as 100 psi) usually results in obliteration of these microfenestrae. As a result, the presence of microfenestrae in some ancient MCL strongly suggests that early cementation occurred prior to compaction of the mud precursors.more » Variations in presence and relative abundance of microfenestrae among Phanerozoic MCL suggest that in some rocks early cementation was important, whereas in others compaction processes have dominated porosity reduction.« less","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"New Microtextural Criteria for Distinguishing Early Cementation from Compaction in Microcrystalline Limestones: ABSTRACT","doi":"10.1306/703CA02C-1707-11D7-8645000102C1865D","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1306/703CA02C-1707-11D7-8645000102C1865D","venue":""}

These reports imply that the evaluation of therapeutic response by changes in tumor volume is misleading, as volume changes reflect the response of the sensitive rather than the resistant tumorigenic cell population. The reports further suggest that the marker-based selection of the tumor cell population will facilitate the development of radiation treatment schedules, sensitizers, and drugs that specifically target the resistant tumorigenic cells that give rise to treatment failure. This review presents evidence that contests the observations that cancer stem cell markers reliably identify the subset of tumor cells that sustain tumor growth and that the marker-identified population is radioresistant relative to the marker-negative cells. Experimental studies show that cells and tumors that survive large radiation doses are not more radioresistant than unirradiated cells and tumors, and also show that the intrinsic radiosensitivity of unsorted colony-forming tumor cells, in combination with the fraction of unsorted tumor cells that are tumor initiating, predicts tumor radiocurability.","inCitations":["b20b90955c3e92dc91cae35366486d2309b8d03c","586da66fe037df11c92b02102d7c2bc161273f2d","8c4bde3a0683a7b1e4cdc597d5c3e4f27d95068b","67cf7ab47b099e3b2495d7909906092cf512f6ab","3f1156a92ae5bd0fb958dad418202be7d761b086","790b6b19c335beb727ca5a64d9d254bfba9174c2","9ace8292ab80a0c8c633facea1061fc24162568d","60c0130f58b1ce5c44e8c11739541f2986c63882","8357a38b64f55e7a7fd0c16589267286ed23ac0f","d290bbd95fee16e03e6a2463527eea72e6df5975","d7387b5637a55053c6ce1f438bd735dbe3651f40","8b225981256442fdd4219bfa0c5cd98a68ebae3a","02135ba3903940e981edf8bbf17b73820a634045","3fe1a657d9c6b87e38a6c4187b79e6d6d39f15e9","18e21d40c8d27bff1d7bd3b2e9c6bb924f214a51"],"pdfUrls":["http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/canres/76/5/994.full.pdf"],"title":"At the Crossroads of Cancer Stem Cells, Radiation Biology, and Radiation Oncology.","doi":"10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-15-2455","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-15-2455","venue":"Cancer research"}

The dependence of current through the contact on loading force, geometric parameters, bias conditions, and time is studied in a two-terminal configuration, where a gold coated AFM cantilever serves as a movable electrode. We find that for an optimized placement of the cantilever relative to the CNT, the current through the contact becomes independent of the loading force beyond a certain limit, and this behavior is also independent of bias conditions. In that load-independent regime, the contact is stable in time to within the current fluctuations imposed by 1/f and telegraph noise in the CNT channel. Under certain conditions of tip placement, the current through the contact exhibits a non-monotonic behavior with loading, which is well explained by the parasitic planar motion of the cantilever.","inCitations":["ce446767e38ce4f77b762e91d5565fd7e563130e","07ab49901a147c9ef3ac5bc331a4a70143bbd835"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.physics.umd.edu/condmat/mfuhrer/publications/JAPv110n054305.pdf"],"title":"Characterization of the electrical contact between a conductive atomic force microscope cantilever and a carbon nanotube","doi":"10.1063/1.3626811","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1063/1.3626811","venue":""}

The aim of this study is to investigate the association of yoghurt consumption with depressive symptoms in adults.MethodsThis is a cross-sectional study of 19,596 Chinese adults (mean age 41.2, standard deviation 11.8 years; males, 54.3%). Depressive symptoms were assessed using the Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS). Dietary intake was obtained through a valid food frequency questionnaire. Multiple logistic regression analysis was conducted to assess the association between yoghurt consumption and depressive symptoms. A number of potential confounders were adjusted in the model.ResultsThe prevalence of elevated depressive symptoms was 17.1% (SDS ≥45). The multivariable adjusted odds ratios (95% CI) of having elevated depressive symptoms by increasing levels of yoghurt consumption (1–3 times/week, 4–7 times/week, and  ≥twice/day) were 1.05 (0.96, 1.15), 1.02 (0.91, 1.15), and 2.10 (1.61, 2.73) in comparison with lowest consumption group (<once/week or hardly ever).ConclusionsThese findings suggest no significant association between habitual yoghurt consumption and self-reported depressive symptoms, while the relatively high frequency of yoghurt consumption (≥twice/day), which was seen in a small subset of subjects, was associated with increased depressive symptoms. These results need to be interpreted with caution because of the cross-sectional nature of the data.","inCitations":["74a00ccd1461e2faec91f2da5e51526786290ae4","b8d5b625ea2c9806717bfc1770daa3701b7798ca","a026820245f3a54b51561ef78e653359017ee3bb"],"pdfUrls":["http://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/1574302/1/Steptoe_EJN%20Yoghurt%20and%20Depression.pdf"],"title":"Habitual yoghurt consumption and depressive symptoms in a general population study of 19,596 adults","doi":"10.1007/s00394-017-1532-x","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00394-017-1532-x","venue":"European Journal of Nutrition"}

However, its mechanisms are still unclear. In this study, we used inhibitors to block specific signaling pathways, including JAK, PI3K/Akt, and Src pathways, to explore how bFGF mediates crosstalk with STAT3 in two glioblastoma(GBM) cell lines: U251 (mutant p53) and U87 (wild-type p53). Furthermore, we explored how the bFGF/STAT3 pathway affects GBM cell apoptosis. Our results suggest that bFGF can induce the activation of STAT3 mainly through the JAK and PI3K/Akt pathways, and that siRNA-mediated knockdown of STAT3 markedly reduces the bFGF levels in U251 cells. Our results also suggest that STAT3 knockdown increases the expression of pro-apoptotic genes and decreases the expression of anti-apoptotic genes, subsequently collapsing the mitochondrial membrane potentials in vitro and impairs tumor growth in vivo.","inCitations":["afd672ecb99bf5e15db9a7d9cdca581493fc51c1","c348b4032e9ee53ef099182dac0ce2d2265b05d0","d2c2979bfaced951b5df54a13708c6955d25872b","6a88af1f888f6de57d15c4da67d8e218fd08070b","86cc3b28f06c6b963ed1c45161eff134b502bb90","360525b4dcf436d95cfd12fdad58548c9d4fb99f","8aefaa9794868840c9554b63b4ddd11af19d3f70","9f15fad3d762da09b5939710a1278032185234d7"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Blocking the bFGF/STAT3 interaction through specific signaling pathways induces apoptosis in glioblastoma cells","doi":"10.1007/s11060-014-1529-8","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11060-014-1529-8","venue":"Journal of Neuro-Oncology"}

A survey of CRSFs in southern Thailand revealed that most do not have adequate treatment for their wastewater. To investigate potential of this wastewater for agricultural use, a representative CRSF in southern Thailand was selected as a study site. Results showed that the waters in all the treatment ponds were in anaerobic state, and the final effluent from the system had never met the discharge standards. In the first experiment, pH of the final effluent was adjusted by the residual ash from fuel rubber wood, used in rubber smoking, before being mixed with tap water at ratios 1:0 (pure effluent), 1:1, 1:2, 1:4 and 0:1 (pure tap water as control). The experiment was carried out in a glasshouse where Chinese green mustard and cucumber were used as test plants. Results showed that the plants irrigated with effluent mixtures had higher yields than those plants in the control set, and the ratio of 1:2 with ash addition showed a prominent result. In the second set of experiments, impacts of effluent on economic crops, rice and rubber tree, were investigated. It was found that the latex production of rubber trees irrigated with effluent was significantly higher, at 112 ± 49% on average. However, in the paddy field experiment, empty-grain occurred in the effluent irrigated plot more than the control plot. This might be due to the impact of effluent application at grain-filling period. On the other hand, effluent application at pre-flowering significantly increased seed yield as compared to the applications at other stages of plant development and the control. Knowing the potential and method for correct application is of interest to the farmers since it can increase crop yields and reduce spending and application of chemical fertilizer, and finally eliminating additional cost for wastewater treatment.","inCitations":["bd0b18bee8162757790880155efff4f3cd32c739","b5aac54ccff393b77823cea8bfca3b06386e9368","755b56abe0e4a34b4a80ecb8ed0bbc2af3f1586b","6d3d20e2add7231d48a53f9fb908a4e9010340f0","f28f1589d6bf33418fa1e47267d95ba1268c9baf","68ffa460d5e920d240dd0ab800cad43671852c9b","214c64c5296e44b84f0d4a20b9dc479b1002bae3","f79cfa3fc55a5fbe880c27e78fa75238de0720da","c53e57e98b0b20df7709119bbbf66e656d758e23","46808eecf5fdb427fe3415bbff0d6bcfa2d3dda5","df04ec4341ea32232b8f3fe7e0153c64c6625e6c","d0d676486c4a15a8f5bc911068376ff79bb7a2cd","38f8b555d50bbb39de649edfdcba978f09df56f8","3c1d8158902b35c5cf43157486829d3c2e759a1e","2f175ac62bdbae4fb2ee2d72605c97b220372e95","07f790fa6e1f75039b009ec9c555d3bcb6ffb8d7","a0b3c4252709902efc9959320f37c2865ac83a9c","b8e2b29dcc1c9fb41e12a22fcd6bac662b8c8fd4","530e473665dbc41065588ebfa9794f82771bf92f","17e1f9aa6091e23cccd58795ff20c64fbaca444b","cd653851c0d36dc3fc49cbb1f1e9fb830c6c5932","8b662bbd2377bbe30de14fbb567aaa23bbaf8a7e"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Effects of wastewater recycling from natural rubber smoked sheet production on economic crops in southern Thailand","doi":"10.1016/j.resconrec.2006.11.003","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.resconrec.2006.11.003","venue":""}

With the advent of fully automated image analysis and modern machine learning methods, there is a need for very large image datasets having documented segmentations for both computer algorithm training and evaluation. This paper presents a method and implementation for facilitating such datasets that addresses the critical issue of size scaling for algorithm validation and evaluation; current evaluation methods that are usually used in academic studies do not scale to large datasets. This method includes protocols for the documentation of many regions in very large image datasets; the documentation may be incrementally updated by new image data and by improved algorithm outcomes. This method has been used for 5 years in the context of chest health biomarkers from low-dose chest CT images that are now being used with increasing frequency in lung cancer screening practice. The lung scans are segmented into over 100 different anatomical regions, and the method has been applied to a dataset of over 20,000 chest CT images. Using this framework, the computer algorithms have been developed to achieve over 90% acceptable image segmentation on the complete dataset.","inCitations":["83e639f3bb39e289619ec6fb72847517b3eb3a3f","27becbebb4aa98a786d13dfd07902d218d80ce24","48ebb708d129426e19cd35ebdfe66addb252924c"],"pdfUrls":["https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/journalIssue/Download?DOI=10.1117/1.JMI.4.2.024505&downloadType=journal+article&fullDOI=10.1117/1.JMI.4.2.024505","https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/journalIssue/Download?DOI=10.1117/1.JMI.4.2.024505&downloadType=journal+article&fullDOI=10.1117/1.JMI.4.2.024505&isResultClick=True","https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/journalIssue/Download?fullDOI=10.1117/1.JMI.4.2.024505","https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/journalArticle/Download?fullDOI=10.1117/1.JMI.4.2.024505"],"title":"Large-scale image region documentation for fully automated image biomarker algorithm development and evaluation","doi":"10.1117/1.JMI.4.2.024505","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1117/1.JMI.4.2.024505","venue":"Journal of medical imaging"}

However for interventional use they suffer from drawbacks which limit their application. Freehand SPECT was developed to provide 3D functional imaging during interventions. It combines a nuclear detector with an optical tracking system to obtain its position and orientation in space and synchronizes this with the detector readings. This information can be used to compute a 3D tomographic reconstruction of an activity distribution of a nuclear tracer. As there is no fixed geometry, the system matrix has to be computed on the fly. This is done with models of the detection process for completely arbitrary freehand acquisitions. The accuracy of the reconstructions is highly dependent on the used models of the detection process. Different models of the detection process were developed and evaluated in this work, in particular two analytical models as well as lookup tables generated from either real measurements or Monte Carlo simulations. We showed that it is possible to perform acceptable reconstructions with a simple but efficient analytical model. The use of lookup tables to generate the system matrix in Freehand SPECT is a fast solution with good accuracy.","inCitations":["93de7890c1a73dc8eed16f2bd559fb532396f892","6616f8bd28c6805d48b917d6deb964d1683b92a4","9911e80eea68b3c16447640897234f9e9750031a","f26deca742f0ea84634079725fe91c8732caadaf"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Detection models for freehand SPECT reconstruction.","doi":"10.1088/0031-9155/60/3/1031","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1088/0031-9155%2F60%2F3%2F1031","venue":"Physics in medicine and biology"}

The sample that was screened consisted of the progeny of single plants from each of 123 sites in central Turkey. When used in combination, six polymorphic enzyme systems separated 91 distinct clones.

The method, based on a simple two-component model of the scattering medium discussed by Gwinn, Bartel &38; Cordes, uses scintillation and proper motion data in addition to the measurements of angular broadening and temporal broadening to solve for the model parameters, namely, the fractional distance to a discrete scatterer and the associated relative scattering strength. We show how this method can be used to estimate pulsar distances reliably, when the location of a discrete scatterer (e.g. an H II region), if any, is known. Considering the specific example of PSR B0736–40, we illustrate how a simple characterization of the Gum nebula region (using the data on the Vela pulsar) is possible and can be used along with the temporal broadening measurements to estimate pulsar distances.","inCitations":["dc4d05e4f42d09c1ba2e383246e47ecbb8fac060","45fda330e2b9ed9cbbbf8cd8d6324e0bb637bfec"],"pdfUrls":["http://cds.cern.ch/record/357862/files/9806291.pdf","http://arxiv.org/pdf/astro-ph/9806291v1.pdf","https://arxiv.org/pdf/astro-ph/9806291v1.pdf"],"title":"Improving pulsar distances by modelling interstellar scattering","doi":"10.1046/j.1365-8711.1998.01926.x","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-8711.1998.01926.x","venue":""}

In [1], an analytic approach has been proposed to calculate the wall forces produced by kink modes in tokamaks. The expressions have been derived within the thin-wall model that is widely used in the resistive wall mode (RWM) studies, see details and references in [4–6]. In addition to the standard thin-wall constraints, in [1] the toroidal current in the plasma was assumed constant. Also, the calculations there were performed by using a truncated formula for the wall force. Here we include the term missing in that starting formula in [1] and prove that it should be retained in the case considered. Besides, we do not impose any restriction on the plasma parameters. Though in all other respects we follow the same route as in [1], the first improvement essentially changes the final result compared to that in [1]. The second one extends the applicability range of the predictions by allowing realistic current profiles. Besides, we incorporate the mode rotation as another new element in our model. The derived expression gives a dependence of the force on the mode growth rate drastically different from that proposed in [1] and confirmed in [3]. This and other differences between the results are explained and their implications are discussed. The latter includes next steps in theory and comparison of the model predictions with experimental observations.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://ocs.ciemat.es/EPS2014PAP/pdf/P4.043.pdf","http://ocs.ciemat.es/EPS2014ABS/pdf/P4.043.pdf"],"title":"Revisited thin-wall model of wall forces produced by kink modes in tokamaks","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Regions have to react and position their identity in relation to the rescaling of statehood. Especially, the growing autonomy of regional administrations makes support from local stakeholders more important. Communicating a specific regional identity is one of the instruments regional administrations use for mobilising support. However, at the same time old, traditional regional identities become more fluid. Regional identity traditionally focuses on shared past and specific social and cultural characteristics. Especially globalisation and individualisation undermine this traditional thick regional identity. Regional administrations have to adjust their communicated regional identity. By communicating the image of a future oriented region that can face the challenges of global competition, they increasingly use a thin regional identity. This paper analyses different case studies from the Netherlands and Germany.","inCitations":["8aff5861d5caa6eea02ef8e3ae1ba59da0664d3f","4cb1393de8c5a8259741e36522ba5c66ff684ead","4feb204e8e386b76551b7d9e446c87036918becd","1b9f2c44367e6823e4675dcf1405e4f37eecb072","ed0891c7382258e41e142c58da6588f380eeab65","c418e0520e1ac3ab150a467060290a90d708047b","2047108ac3c1169fa59e0ef986f86eccf28d06b0","489fc3188c8ebf77727d0b8a88c31b3089b45e39","8a42c653751f8f114ea10d8c3faf63057f7bc83d","8d30d12f3a4ea212f015a04b95eaff044357a475","aff3bf1da6d966de5fe869e6b4bc4729f617d9b9","7aa61b885dab643a65a273364887704dba1784d0","577a8627ac1a1e88083b8b049d3260b20f6ada0d"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Rescaling Regional Identities: Communicating Thick and Thin Regional Identities","doi":"10.1111/j.1754-9469.2009.01064.x","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1754-9469.2009.01064.x","venue":""}

In such evaluation, the severity of the patient's anxiety is a useful parameter, but it is not the only one that needs to be considered. The best therapy may be to learn more about the circumstances of the patient and to resolve difficulties when possible. Drugs are prescribed only when this fails. Some properties of 25 drugs now used to relieve anxiety are given. In severe anxiety, potent drugs are used initially despite their inherent dangers. If an office patient drives a car, takes care of a home, cooks, watches children, or competes in business, parameters other than anxiety are obviously important. The problems of psychopharmacology are therefore complex, but the principles here outlined provide orientation.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Drug evaluation and practical psychiatric therapeutics.","doi":"10.1001/jama.1961.73040270025004d","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.1961.73040270025004d","venue":"JAMA"}

In patients with HMSN1 and HMSN3 the peripheral late waves sometimes were more than one--two or three. They had a consistent appearance above a maximal threshold of stimulation, an invariable latency, amplitude and wave-form. Their latency times were in parallel with the M-response latency. These PLWs can be explained by collateral regeneration in case of axonal neuropathy. The ephaptic transmission might be taken in consideration when interpreting data from patients with demyelinating processes.","inCitations":["8a07dc1a88055ae70d86702fe2a39df1363c904c","03d3ff7a76a5f094b5da3d76f307f64fd18a2d73"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Peripheral late waves in patients with hereditary motor sensory neuropathy.","doi":"","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"Electromyography and clinical neurophysiology"}

Through a practice-oriented approach,participants gain insights into areas such as the abstractworld of digital sound recording and representation, theextreme influence on this content enacted by a given sounddelivery system and a given space, and the subjectiveexperience of listening to sounds from a variety oforientations and postures, and with varying levels ofunderstanding of the original source recordings.

The additions of silver to the Cr2N/Ag coatings were w = (3, 7, 11 and 15) %. Tribological testing using a ball-on-disc apparatus was realized at ambient temperature and, for the Cr2N with the additions of mass fractions of Ag 7 % and 11 %, at the elevated temperatures of (300, 400 and 500) °C, respectively. Balls made of binary CuZn-brass (55 % Cu, 45 % Zn) were used as the counterparts. The wear tracks after the ball-on-disc testing and the worn balls were analyzed with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and a microanalysis (EDX), and the wear rates were calculated. The adhesive wear was derived from a quantitative-point metallographic analysis. The obtained results infer that a considerable material transfer from the counterpart onto the surface of the coatings takes place during dry sliding. The material transfer (and the adhesive wear of the counterpart) is mainly due to the low shear strength of the brass used. Two main trends were observed. The first one shows that the adhesive material transfer decreases with the increasing silver content when tested at ambient temperature. The second trend indicates that the use of a higher testing temperature leads to a higher adhesive wear of the counterpart.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://mit.imt.si/Revija/izvodi/mit153/bilek.pdf"],"title":"INTERACTION OF Cr 2 N AND Cr 2 N / Ag THIN FILMS WITH CuZn-BRASS COUNTERPART DURING BALLON-DISC TESTING INTERAKCIJA Cr 2 N IN Cr 2 N / Ag","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Rats from the Hcy100 group and the Hcy200 group had higher plasma Hcy concentrations (34.4 ± 4.6 and 69.4 ± 11.5 μM, respectively) than rats fed an Hcy-free diet (9.5 ± 1.7 μM). The concentration of Hcy in liver was 2.6 and 3.8 times higher, and in small intestine was 2.6 and 5.1 times higher, in the Hcy100 group and the Hcy200 group, respectively, than in control rats (P < 0.05). The concentrations of cholesterol in plasma, lipoproteins, liver, and small intestine and the relative mRNA concentrations of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 2 (SREBP-2), 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor in liver and small intestine were not influenced by dl-homocysteine thiolactone supplementation. In conclusion, in view of the experimental conditions used here, increased plasma and tissue concentrations of Hcy do not alter cholesterol metabolism of liver and intestine.","inCitations":["ed00214dc72dea5412476935debcf5390fc64a36","6af90211f7e7a5a177ab5f8b33a371872a752398","1321078a4c459cef1a5bdfee66e893ad6258e3d3","7bcd955cf2ff83c23c6fa8ef5f742d05f630a272","2a5986e5ba8d0fb6cae33959f2609be6fed2cac0","e30e1d3dd651c52061ab4ab225e9e989606d8fd7"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Homocysteine Thiolactone-Induced Hyperhomocysteinemia Does Not Alter Concentrations of Cholesterol and SREBP-2 Target Gene mRNAs in Rats","doi":"10.3181/00379727-207-2320081","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.3181/00379727-207-2320081","venue":"Experimental biology and medicine"}

The uncontrolled protease activities result in generation of several mediators which are not fully characterized. Biomarker profiling using protein chip array technology has been used in the identification of unique mediators in various diseases. Surface Enhanced Laser Desorption Ionisation(SELDI) is an ionization method in mass spectrometry that is used for the analysis of protein mixtures and correspondingly in the profiling of biomarkers in various diseases. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to profile and identify unique biomarkers in hospitalized patients with sepsis associated coagulopathy. Study design: There were 385 plasma samples included in this study. Baseline protein chip array profile in Molecular weight range of 0–200 kDa was carried out using SELDI technique employing gold chips. Plasma samples from normal humans (n=100) and pooled preparation from both the normal (NHP) and suspect liver disease/coagulopathy were utilized as controls. Results: Of the 385 baseline samples analyzed 371 patients (96.86%) exhibited the presence of a unique biomarker at 11.6 kDa. In addition down regulation of a biomarker at 56.4 kDa was also noted in 218 of patients (56.74%) In the normal human pooled plasma the 11.6 kDa peak was nearly absent. However in Pathological pooled plasma a distinct biomarker at 11.6 kDa with a much lower intensity was noted. Additional markers in baseline samples in 1–10 kDa range were also noted. Conclusions: These observations suggest that sepsis associated coagulopathy results in the generation of specific unique biomarker at 11.6kDa which requires further characterization. The downregulation of biomarker at 56.4 kDa and the apparent reduction levels during hospitalization require further investigations. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Identification of Unique Biomarkers in Sepsis Associated Coagulopathy","doi":"10.1182/blood.V118.21.1237.1237","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1182/blood.V118.21.1237.1237","venue":""}

Up to 60% of intraoperative cerebral events are emboli induced. This randomized, controlled, multicenter trial is the first human study evaluating the safety and efficacy of a novel aortic cannula producing simultaneous forward flow and backward suction for extracting solid and gaseous emboli from the ascending aorta and aortic arch upon their intraoperative release.\n\n\nMETHODS\nSixty-six patients (25 females; 68±10 years) undergoing elective aortic valve replacement surgery, with or without coronary artery bypass graft surgery, were randomized to the use of the CardioGard (CardioGard Medical, Or-Yehuda, Israel) Emboli Protection cannula (\"treatment\") or a standard (\"control\") aortic cannula. The primary endpoint was the volume of new brain lesions measured by diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI), performed preoperatively and postoperatively. Device safety was investigated by comparisons of complications rate, namely neurologic events, stroke, renal insufficiency and death.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOf 66 patients (34 in the treatment group), 51 completed the presurgery and postsurgery MRI (27 in the treatment group). The volume of new brain lesion for the treatment group was (mean±standard error of the mean) 44.00±64.00 versus 126.56±28.74 mm3 in the control group (p=0.004). Of the treatment group, 41% demonstrated new postoperative lesions versus 66% in the control group (p=0.03). The complication rate was comparable in both groups.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe CardioGard cannula is safe and efficient in use during open-heart surgery. Efficacy was demonstrated by the removal of a substantial amount of emboli, a significant reduction in the volume of new brain lesions, and the percentage of patients experiencing new brain lesions.","inCitations":["463d53fc54803452523facf43340775f37c3bb29","378892c76c7bfdd7e5a04249358b2f264332fc74","073f8b08a64b3a0917b5eb86dd7b1a96a18dff37","528e20fe579afc8c31cdcdfb0e69e6ebd6f5da97","aa2c2c44c431026c17a0eb33dee5770ccdb9c499","4c4da68b51c13b1ebc15ea97d83d37833407ef7d","8da5da27111f7b3f142f2c0fe59d6c9237622bf5","4c93dc8a66c98b90db0dcbdb45b780f1cc8efa94"],"pdfUrls":["http://lib.ajaums.ac.ir/booklist/1-s2.0-s0003497514013654-main.pdf"],"title":"Novel emboli protection system during cardiac surgery: a multi-center, randomized, clinical trial.","doi":"10.1016/j.athoracsur.2014.06.061","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.athoracsur.2014.06.061","venue":"The Annals of thoracic surgery"}

There are many reports that the incidence of ectopic pregnancy is increasing and the condition has a special relationship with in vitro fertilization and embryo transfer. The 2 cases of combined intrauterine and tubal ectopic pregnancies reported here are more than anecdotal; both were initially undiagnosed because of the known presence of an intrauterine pregnancy.

Among researchers it is a well known fact that cross-sectional information about labour market is not sufficient to understand ungoing development. A pure sequence of employment and unemployment figures would hide the turnover in the market. Here we follow the useful analytical framework of transitional labour markets dealing centrally with flow figures. By developing the multiaccount system (MAS) we go some steps ahead compared to indicators like job and labour turnover rates. First we combine the information of administrative data of the micro level with macro data containing pupils, self employed, retired persons. Embedded in an external framework, which is given by demography (birth, death, moving in and out), the MAS describes the transition process of the labour market on the regional level and contains all 180 local employment agencies in Germany. The multiaccount system thus serves as a basis for strategically aligning each agency with the individual local situation of the labour market by explicitly taking into account the regional specifics. Thus it helps for future strategic decisions of active labour market policy. The creation of models for supporting regional monitoring and benchmarking is already far advanced and initial basic versions are tested in practice. For estimating the unknown transitions of the data matrix we use a new algorithm the so called ADETON tool, which has the additional merit comparing to other entropy maximizing methods, that constraints can be formulated in a fuzzy way rather than exactly. Further we demonstrate on the basis of the agency Heilbronn some practice and numerical examples. Thus we present transitions into and out of unemployment and also from vocational training to employment. We believe that the analytical potential of this instrument is not yet exhausted. In any event, it is already clear that the information content of this model by far exceeds that of a system of individual indicators. Details and relations of the regional labour market become apparent which show a high-resolution image of possible obsolete structures or increasing labour market dynamics. The model thus gives clear hints as to the scope and limits of the active labour market policy.\" (Author's abstract, IAB-Doku) ((en))","inCitations":["b3a2018a73c7053681ba0577edbfe7163ae8c27b","cd4728d792f2234ff3d9ab099f7ec53c2a2549c1","0a9923eb7d0fd4265fcb160f009c097df4567539","d19178a998a3aef2e2a42e8b3c204a91db912602","7057fafdf4983f0070988e17ba2a02965bb3f956","4acb659f6755c1eb8e0433551ce20681ac2601e0","c8722bbd3719ae0e042d91b3e3442c9fcc9d5e09","3a28479027e5792fefc89c3f5fdd0e10f3e2268e"],"pdfUrls":["http://doku.iab.de/discussionpapers/2005/dp0705.pdf","https://www.ssoar.info/ssoar/bitstream/handle/document/31621/ssoar-2005-haas_et_al-Labour_market_dynamics_from_a.pdf?sequence=1","http://doku.iab.de/fdz/events/2005/Rothe.pdf"],"title":"Labour market dynamics from a regional perspective The multi-account system","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

XI I I sono tuttora limitate alle scarse e forse malsicure notizie fornite dal Lampros e dallo Schlumberger: su di essa viene però a proiettare un fascio di luce il pezzo che possiamo ora far conoscere. Si tratta di una moneta di rame, leggermente concava, la quale presenta nel lato interno (che chiameremo, secondo la prassi consueta, dritto) la figura, in piedi e di prospetto, di un personaggio barbato, in veste e con le insegne imperiali (corona con pendenti, sakkos, loros, scettro crucígero nella d. ed akakia nella s.) e, a fianco di lui, la Vergine (col nimbo, velo, tunica e manto) la quale stende la d. sul capo del personaggio e tiene la s. sul petto. Nel rov. vi è un busto alato, col nimbo, i capelli spioventi, il viso imberbe ed una verga nella d. Il nome del personaggio è chiaramente indicato dalla leggenda che corre accanto alla di lui figura: ΜΙΧΑΗΛΟΔΟ (Μιχαήλ ¿ Δούκας); quello del santo nel rov. dal monogramma AP e dalla lettera M (appena discernibile nell'originale) che si notano ai lati del busto e che suggeriscono il nome dell'arcangelo Michele, il quale viene in questo caso a richiamare quello del personaggio nel dritto. Il pezzo è mutilo e un po' corroso; nello stato attuale, pesa gr. 1, 37; il diametro massimo del tondello è di mm. 25 e quello dei cerchi che delimitano le figure, da ciascun lato, mm. 19 (fig. ι). Tale moneta si ricollega chiaramente, come stile e fattura, a quelle degli imperatori di Salonicco, Teodoro e Manuele, che si chiamarono anche essi Comneno e Duca; però il nome Michele ci riporta ai despoti di Epiro, Michele I (1204-1216) e Michele II (c. 1236-1271), ciò che è confermato anche dalla provenienza del pezzo che è stato trovato in località prossima all'attuale Albania.

Because of the intricate relationship between cancer cells and immune cells, we aimed to identify both cancer cell and immune cell expressed biomarkers. Using a novel approach, we isolated RNA from flow-sorted viable EpCAM+ tumor epithelial cells and CD45+ tumor-infiltrating immune cells obtained from squamous cell cervical cancer samples (n = 24). Total RNA was sequenced and differential gene expression analysis of the CD45+ immune cell fractions identified TCL1A as a novel marker for predicting improved survival (p = 0.007). This finding was validated using qRT-PCR (p = 0.005) and partially validated using immunohistochemistry (p = 0.083). Importantly, TCL1A was found to be expressed in a subpopulation of B cells (CD3-/CD19+/CD10+/CD34-) using multicolor immunofluorescence. A high TCL1A/CD20 (B cell) ratio, determined in total tumor samples from a separate patient cohort using qRT-PCR (n = 52), was also correlated with improved survival (p = 0.027). This is the first study demonstrating the prognostic value of separating tumor epithelial cells from tumor-infiltrating immune cells and determining their RNA expression profile for identifying putative cancer biomarkers. Our results suggest that intratumoral TCL1A+ B cells are important for controlling cervical cancer development.","inCitations":["4576d4e0c32fabb13003bd3292f71c6c280e6972","43a6b1d4510470820d0fcdc94920e2c0e3898906","6d2a75b551c9a57ab070c2fa6c68abe34d735541","7ca43898caf7e2a2c2738a3f932c6623e81e355f","35bcc1ab1c12bb76a2854a7934745aefd8bb62a5","7c1be458960b54d839553bc550816a8d875b961c","f0f07775ac5ed2cb4137027ca3c94654bd3c80ba","c30a660f3e272f7978903f51eaa43826924b4508"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.oncotarget.com/index.php?journal=oncotarget&op=download&page=article&path%5B%5D=4526&path%5B%5D=10388","https://openaccess.leidenuniv.nl/bitstream/handle/1887/35116/06.pdf?sequence=11"],"title":"Whole-transcriptome analysis of flow-sorted cervical cancer samples reveals that B cell expressed TCL1A is correlated with improved survival","doi":"10.18632/oncotarget.4526","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.18632/oncotarget.4526","venue":"Oncotarget"}

Two conceptual models were used to simulate the observed asymmetry and tailing in the BTCs caused by an apparent nonequilibrium situation in the porous medium. In both models the exchange process on one type of site was assumed to be instantaneous while the rate of isotopic exchange on another type of site was assumed to be either a diffusion-controlled process (model 1) or a first-order reversible kinetic process (model 2). Isotopic exchange in both models was described with a linear isotherm. It is shown that the two models are mathematically equivalent with respect to the derived BTCs.","inCitations":["f449e3bbc52a70cf0d3c98a5ae5bad0db2582c6f","9d5db6aa0b57760c0e71a11b3c876565a7f46a2d","c812861beb260c8b852a170b46a69803b990a4c0","75c428c2a771d494bd0ffa95324261facc51b89f","e752ae9a0c7fb26f03a24a0bc95587103e7fce81","da54e86b0b0ac5fe220f1aeb309fcd9ebbeae36f","4d61e166a9f0d4a312cbce7caabb60810769b9c3","ec6cbe502f8bf3a71d54cb296467d79b76f92ac2","86903d7c15b663ba8e7423714bc2567e1ba95739","4340dc6d932e5ea41e55be9a65088555d5bcf73f","11064d34a68e6d7e58fcf53f7a62c6ad1e3c0e22","54c50e42285672035a41295bbf77baf801f2e24a","8edb0c5b14061b10a46561bf96128176fb79f5c5","0130869caf7a6147d9fe4f57fee94bbdd1bb87f0","8d02098c8b4937f22940bea285b4f707e69da573","778a5189639e0fbda64c133ad00c1d95581ed49d","b0160c55b553f80ddfa19656b466231f37a55f27","f3aefe7df8ce34debbf340b5e805acb0ececb07f","2030bb3aff8c2cd916bd1331f34e0e661bb6043f","72650d99f15e8e8d7bddeb227418dd9ec5e15189","216ca09da121b6e5807d58663b1ce247f9f10e44","d12c185cd749f58e2e82a185afd7a57c9bf2c1d6","cd2b76d8ec409d5444156abf81469fcc77aeb04b","c9de8b851341541b783046b6398df8baf1f93ea0","496e76ed1c78153979fcd0190bc67be7d4aa83af","239c880461ef8bb928d0538ae817f82b3e116fb6","0e85dae570510a5a251ccc2a99230bd4084ff31a","c9479d8961c886c3c6a59e2f70e716c290f20b57","e44b3ecb6e24d2d8ed2988a2b554f37b111681cc","e3940e8895e1ef9db7105d84edb7a05f976ea38f","ee831812a24eedfb1294411e4be7eb152ced9519","23f8d01dadde8db3ed90c71d1e861f21be445c3e","788c50d30706bd56a2487da3cf0a08788377d6da","59b7d2353386e47bac638eb3adb45ed79361cfbc","114c3c32a9b050f30e03ac86499a83f20f8ea23d","3ffa3446d1036e69c3ad805bd46ff539250a26af","23c7366854839537642bb7fe7fe88cb83464cf79","d9280601f53cb984291c9daafde18e12d594c177","6f54ecf99cb38db770fddf8b0100c55245ee3ea1","3191aa3ce9adb7a9bf34afee3e722eb9e3c0588a","5e91a6c0a7a4f3e93787d0360f72d746b5a0059e","5862da4c7716884e9bd826645f4ae89636d78a85","65eca82360a537739a650dc94bc915e577044dad","e1a91910338871fb7485bc5ef9a06fba65d02faa","352a9be52f015d9d4d2239dc8a9ef25f6e4ea569","308a65e1a35eec35a686ec21f40ca8681d05b409","c28294d2dee8370dafaf2ea95fae9acda87520bd","e596be707823b1dab196a712889cd6e573f5bbf5","e16fee9b9cba9b5d763d629a53e077ea18bbe233","e39e6b5ed4ae5c03e887a5fae7c7149690b6b8f3","ef4d1fa2e801be907948c2d12973d333e97b7483","dcc6ea4b895dac16f843d81cc1765bbd2bf55c09","23958c519654e7550f6e65de7c66a091c9636c87","aa5623f4ca0b823eb453d297edac771ff4f7e667","4716f7222f04019a221bc17990a0066ef85c45b3","e3894bda864c116fe413e0c549a17dbca13d512c","ea87d968bc683c47dbf822220d88d86a56a2251d","0e597ea518f9c634fbfc34b0b1d4560f90673adc","fdabc0c2dc656665433658df7ae108ef2326a6f5","6a6b8bcb54dbdc46929cc2f89174a2134f3a4fcf","66bdcfc535437c987758ed89ee74e7a99f981626","2055b689e2b510aef47ca75017341bf150722432","aeca9eb197a538b0699aff8b3eac4fee1973121a","0b86509d289835c1f345fbe8bc678ee159486d6c","58f29246e6c6d549b95042b22353e54a3768740c","a4706b0f0ca0821b0c517b316c3a5e05390d617d","70d3d10fd7bed903464566f400bd67f459c9d226","10cb16986ccafee58f2d8301e2229e1790ccdf93","342e5f9b24aa9b97ed66dbbffbd85e78d5841bc8","ca9b5cffa9f200d0c6b83cb69c09d08a672efc6c","5bfb06bbd579d07d2eeb2f48ee17a3a86512a479","104ad85d9f1394ecaaa80fdc7ac1d5b583fcd802","018bda50335edace26d72eb78e6c75a3cdcd54d1","206b75d820883d8e5d13007c39d40e06f570c46d","9f513ca67421ac1061f3d6548d4a4ef1b8576e4f","1689d4db19314083c35deda1105bd8e80f5b0849","7fd79a4b3f6415ee88087cd54c4489d314aa58d2","584553b520176bbc14675baf9276eb415d7b02fc","49b7c1a460ff57e4f0fb6ce1a9f776c62b65a7fc","5f498c653d291119175aa6c5e74eb65edaedf5fe","dcc59bb13b316ec06572e37cc8658fc290fe3e16","b6e66253c7b388a884549da1e674ff496f7f6478","14b5412f698f06d37cbe56c41ec2a1f59b58e0f8","3521c9a32b9573aad073b562097c31e0c46dc59d","6cd8439ac713be7d23f337c0e382cdb2cac3551b","1b1d6ebd11bed47b780965c0a01b60b57030968d","e9bc41915537aa77fced9b57811ef55300c2a8e9"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"On the Equivalence of Two Conceptual Models for Describing Ion Exchange During Transport Through an Aggregated Oxisol","doi":"10.1029/WR020i008p01123","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1029/WR020i008p01123","venue":""}
