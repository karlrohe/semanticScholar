The main implication of our analysis is the importance of a vigilant energy regulatory authority to the success of liberalized electricity markets.","inCitations":["d72a30a750f331aec04d0f79a56c6a192db8d3bc"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Tacit Collusion in Electricity Markets with Uncertain Demand","doi":"10.1007/s11151-015-9481-0","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11151-015-9481-0","venue":""}

This shortening was prevented by a beta(1)-blocker CGP20712A (10(-7) M) while a beta(2)-blocker ICI118551 (10(-7) M) did not modify the effect of isoproterenol in either group. The beta(2)-agonist zinterol 10(-8)-10(-6) M had no effect on APD. Stimulation at a cycle length of 250 ms in the presence of 10(-7) M isoproterenol induced more triggered AP in myocardium from afflicted than unafflicted dogs. beta(1)-Blockade completely eliminated, while beta(2)-blockade facilitated, and the beta(2)-agonist zinterol did not induce triggered activity in the two groups.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nIsoproterenol effects on APD and triggered activity in the myocardium of dogs with inherited arrhythmias are due primarily to an abnormality of beta(1)-adrenoceptor mediated signaling that is subject to beta(2)-adrenergic modulation.","inCitations":["2f4ebe3396ab9fd76e7235a33c01b252f7850f7c","898c00a74b61ade9603fa37c66e33f204a1cde0b"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"beta(1) and beta(2)-adrenergic receptor subtype effects in German shepherd dogs with inherited lethal ventricular arrhythmias.","doi":"","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"Cardiovascular research"}

Indeed, one recent algebra book [8] is based largely on number theory. This article will treat aspects of Gaussian integers that make them a particularly fertile setting in which students may generalize concepts from elementary number theory and meet abstract algebraic ideas through concrete examples. The Gaussian integers are Z[i] = {a + bi I a, b E Z }, where Z denotes the set of \"ordinary\" integers and i2 1. The size of a Gaussian integer is measured by its norm. If a = a + bi E Z[i], then the norm of a, written Na, is defined to be a2 + b2. The norm maps Z[i] into the non-negative integers and has the easily verified property N(a/3) = Na * N/. How shall we define primes in Z[i]? For this we introduce two new terms: In any ring with 1, the elements which have multiplicative inverses (for example, ? 1 in Z) are called units of that ring. Two elements a and b in Z[i] are associates if they differ by a factor which is a unit-i.e., if there is a unit u for which a = bu. What are the units in Z[i]? If a is a unit in Z[i], then it has an inverse, and NaNa -1 = N(aa'-1) = NI = 1. Therefore, Na = N(a-1) = 1, so the only possible units in Z [i] are ? 1 and ? i; clearly each of these does indeed have an inverse. We now see that each non-zero element y E Z[i] comes with three other associates, ai, -a, and ai, so that factorizations which differ only up to associates may look a bit more varied in Z[i] than in Z. For example (2i) (-3i) is \"essentially\" the same factorization of 6 as 23. We next define primes in Z[i] by analogy with Z. A non-zero element a c Z[i] is called a prime if it is not a unit and cannot be factored without using a unit; i.e., a is prime if a = /3y ==just one of/8 and y is a unit. What are the primes in Z[i]? Let us gather some evidence. Other than 0 and units the elements of Z[i] with smallest norm are ? (1 + i) and ? (1 i). These associates are all primes in Z[i], for if a is one of these and we write a = /3y, then 2 = Na = N/8Ny, X= N/3 = 1 or Ny = 1, so just one of f and y is a unit. Clearly, all other multiples of a are composite in Z[i]. Figure 1 shows these multiples; note the geometric pattern.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Exploring the Gaussian Integers.","doi":"10.2307/3027049","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.2307/3027049","venue":""}

Generally speaking, permafrost there tends to degenerate from south to north, but there are some individual places where remind original ecology of permafrost. After permafrost degenerate into the talik region, the condition of plant growth has changed. We can distinguish permafrost and talik region by the difference of plants growing status there. Some common species that specifically grow in permafrost or talik region have also been listed and introduced in this paper. Specifically, plants growing in permafrost region include larix gmelini, birch, vaccinium uliginosum, ledum palustre, vaccinium vitis-idaea, bilberry, pinus sylvestnis var. mongolica litv, low birch thicket, adina racemosa and so on. Meanwhile the plants live in talik region include peridium aquilinum, xylosma racemosum, daylily, milkvetch. The list of plants can be used to distinguish permafrost region and talik in the field. It is crucial for constructions to recognize if the construction area is permafrost or talik region. The change of talik has its two sides to constructions. On the upside, it can increase groundwater storage, and we can regard the future projects as thawing projects. On the downside, existing projects would arise thawing settlement.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Method on Distinguishing Permafrost and Talik Regions in the Great Khingan Mountains by Analyzing the Characteristics of Specific Plants","doi":"10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMR.550-553.2546","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.4028/www.scientific.net%2FAMR.550-553.2546","venue":""}

The minimum of the potential energy surface corresponds to a well depth of 3168 cm(-1), an intermolecular separation of 1.776 Å, with the bond of the H2 subunit being 0.027 Å longer than for the free molecule. Taking vibrational zero point energy into account, the complexes containing para H2 and ortho D2 are predicted to have dissociation energies of 2678 and 2786 cm(-1), respectively. The νHH band of Be(+)-H2 is predicted to be red-shifted from the free dihydrogen transition by -323 cm(-1), whereas the corresponding shift for Be(+)-D2 is predicted to be -229 cm(-1). The dissociation energy of the Be(+)-D2 complex is calculated to be slightly higher than the energy required to vibrationally excite the D2 subunit, raising the possibility that the onset of dissociation can be observed in the infrared predissociation spectrum at a particular rotational energy level in the νDD manifold.","inCitations":["43b4bf0e8ed5bc2294e403bb43d84a4ec8b54d5a","dd026ae745a5025480ffd366c4ed23fd9cf59ab3"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Interaction of the beryllium cation with molecular hydrogen and deuterium.","doi":"10.1021/jp504363d","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1021/jp504363d","venue":"The journal of physical chemistry.

This is especially true for ibex (Capra ibex), which was a main source of food for hominids during Pleistocene times. Classical methods for determining sexual dimorphism and sex ratio, such as analyses using uni- and bivariate plots, are based on an arbitrary fixing of limits between sexes. Here we use a more robust statistical method termed mixture analysis (MA) to determine the sex of postcranial remains (long bones, metapodials and tarsals) from ibex. For the first time, we apply MA to both a modern and a fossil sample of one species, by using metric data taken from (i) a collection of present-day ibex skeletons and (ii) a Palaeolithic sample of the same species. Our results clearly show that the forelimb (humerus and radius) is more dimorphic than the hindlimb (femur and tibia) and is therefore better suited for sexing ibex. It also appears that metapodials should be used carefully for estimating sex ratios. On the basis of these results, we propose a classification of bone measurements that are more or less reliable for sexing ibex. The results of MA applied to the ibex fossil bones from the Upper Palaeolithic site of the Observatoire (Monaco) lead us to the conclusion that this assemblage consists of a majority of males. The quantitative estimations calculated by the MA make it possible to compare the size of Pleistocene and modern ibex for the whole set of variables used in this study.

The recent guidelines of the European Society of Cardiology suggest that colchicine might be useful even in the treatment of the first episode. However, the use of the drug is not based on any strong evidence obtained from clinical trials, and no randomized placebo-controlled trial is available to guide the management of acute pericarditis.\n\n\nSTUDY DESIGN\nThe Investigation on Colchicine for Acute Pericarditis (ICAP) trial will enroll 240 patients in a prospective, randomized, double-blind, multicenter investigation of colchicine compared to placebo in patients with acute pericarditis. The primary efficacy end point is the recurrence rate at 18 months. The secondary end points are symptom persistence at 72 h, remission rate at 1 week, number of recurrences, time to first recurrence, disease-related hospitalization, cardiac tamponade, and constrictive pericarditis.\n\n\nIMPLICATIONS\nThe ICAP trial will be the first randomized placebo-controlled trial in this area. This trial will provide important evidence regarding the possible benefit of the early use of colchicine in the treatment of acute pericarditis and the primary prevention of recurrences, the most troublesome and commonest complication of pericarditis.","inCitations":["ef28e616752c980742876e65883ae5bfa50c5c74","1bb0b30969a1e104420dd1063c2b147b697d2ef7","766d28feee92fae73bc2919ba940e366a82fc52b","63d33f4c266b5bc7fb4d6836bf833c45c010c341","59bd239388a3a3a0a5d6f412c8e722084639c7f9","465960634748979aeba7a6b37c52519302e8a6c6","73a78bc6d81a7bdd36e3e9fad32d5d18a5ad374f","4ec8eed77f9dfb3673221caca1c04e382d99b783","2ce84932be0c59b66a5babb55462bbc589749981","b5511093a07aa9e008a716d3a4ca16bb1695ed94","cd31c8b6ab4f20f84ed605d084e73f0db3fcbc7d","f8ba8c874b5bb0bd7a92f3705972327a5c8f077e","2bba11308c56874d025298fcb76cadf6d5cae8b8","402d1711d78ac09b961d501de274a9cfc0075d90","9ed0ce66c90b913d78e9fb658dc0d7e8ee7761a2"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Investigation on Colchicine for Acute Pericarditis: a multicenter randomized placebo-controlled trial evaluating the clinical benefits of colchicine as adjunct to conventional therapy in the treatment and prevention of pericarditis; study design amd rationale.","doi":"10.2459/01.JCM.0000281702.46359.07","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.2459/01.JCM.0000281702.46359.07","venue":"Journal of cardiovascular medicine"}

A complementary analysis is performed using another analysis procedure, the dual-independent source-geophone technique (DIT), to investigate any benefits of the alternative formulation. The investigation considers synthetic vertical seismic profile (VSP) and reflection data for an earth model with two layers over a half-space, and three different classes of crack-strike variation with depth: uniform crack-strike, an abrupt change of crack-strike between the upper and lower layer, and a continuous increase over both layers. The synthetic data for zero-offset and near-offset VSPs and a reflection profile are computed using a full-wave modelling package in which equivalent anisotropic media simulate distributions of aligned vertical, parallel, water-filled microcracks. Estimates from the two techniques agree for the constant crack-strike model, but differ for the VSP data with crack-strike changes. The asymptotic behaviour of the two angular parameters θG and θS from DIT suggest that it may be used to determine crack-strike under appropriate circumstances in these VSPs, when the time-delay between the split shear-waves for the layer of interest exceeds the peak period of the wavelet. In this limit, θG tends to follow the crack-strike change with θS tending to a constant value, whereas DCT will give a misleading value between the upper and lower crack-strike. Although the behaviour of DIT is not understood in all cases, θG and θS values from the VSP data always appear to diverge near the point where an abrupt crack-strike change takes place. This could be used as a qualitative indicator for layer stripping. Both techniques agree for the reflection data as the recorded data matrix is necessarily symmetric, but still give misleading results for deeper layers in the presence of crack-strike changes. This study suggests that more care should be taken when designing and analysing experimental configurations for detecting crack properties in reservoir rocks, to consider the response and resolution limits of the analysis techniques. A note of caution is offered to those who directly interpret polarization estimates as crack-strike.","inCitations":["920f0136013d8f1a612c198e29411961aba1a3dc"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Optimal Estimation of Crack-strike1","doi":"10.1111/j.1365-2478.1992.tb00556.x","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2478.1992.tb00556.x","venue":""}

Today we see a crisis in traditional humanism, which also leads to questioning of the Enlightenment and has appeared violently at least twice this century. Contemporary anti-humanism uses the awareness of cultural differences for a ferocious criticism of philosophical universalism. Differences resulting from geography or history are said to preclude a universally valid content to the word human'. This ideological debate, despite an apparent historical consensus concerning the idea of a universal human being divested of ethnic, confessional or social roots, was already present in the 18th-century Philosophes.

Studies suggest that surface IgD receptors play a crucial role in determining the potential for affinity maturation in memory B cell populations. The increased antigen-binding capacity of memory cells with IgD receptors provides a logical explanation for how a differential sensitivity to antigen-driven selection can be maintained in early and mature memory populations. Memory cells, whether IgD + or IgD − , carry surface IgG receptors. The difficulty in detecting these receptors, however, suggests that they are represented much more sparsely on the cell surface than IgD receptors. Differentiation from IgD + to IgD must, therefore, dramatically reduce the antigen-binding capacity of a given cell even though the specificity and affinity of its receptors remains constant. This reduction is tantamount to specifically reducing the antigen concentration for cells in the mature IgD − memory population, since the probability that a cell with IgG receptors of a given affinity will capture antigen will be considerably decreased once its IgD receptors are lost. IgD receptors, then, appear to play two related roles in memory development. First, they extend the lower boundary of the affinity range of early memory B cell populations induced by a given antigenic stimulus and thus broaden the initial diversity of responses from these populations. Second, these early memory populations, so long as they persist, serve as a reservoir from which mature memory populations with higher affinities for the original or a related antigen can be drawn.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"A ROLE FOR IgD: DISSOCIATION OF MEMORY INDUCTION FROM AFFINITY MATURATION","doi":"10.1016/B978-0-12-637140-6.50085-1","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-637140-6.50085-1","venue":""}

Aside from plumage coloration, carotenoids play a role in mounting an immune response and neutralizing the by-products of cytotoxic activity. We determined whether colorimetric descriptors of carotenoid-based plumage predict infection occurrence of malarial parasites (order Haemosporida, Plasmodium, Parahaemoproteus and Haemoproteus). We captured birds in an area of sensu strictu Cerrado in southeastern Brazil, used PCR to molecularly detect haemosporidian infections and microscopy to confirm all infections. We collected five feathers from the region below the furcula of each individual to retrieve plumage coloration descriptors, namely saturation, carotenoid chroma, hue and the maximum reflectance at the ultraviolet spectrum. We analysed feathers of 58 individuals from three bird species: Lesser Elaenia Elaenia chiriquensis, Flavescent Warbler Myiothlypis flaveola and Red Pileated Finch Coryphospingus cucullatus. Colour saturation and carotenoid chroma predicted the individual occurrence of an infection with malarial parasites. We suggest that infected individuals may trade carotenoid investment between the immune system and plumage coloration, as carotenoid chroma was negatively associated with parasite occurrence. Our results indicate that haemosporidian parasites are important in influencing physiological trade-offs in natural bird populations.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Plumage Coloration Predicts Haemosporidian Infection Occurrence in Birds","doi":"10.5253/arde.v108i1.a2","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.5253/arde.v108i1.a2","venue":""}

Where, these group of end users are either be skilled or unskilled. Recently, the most intellectual decision is to retrieve the requested data from the enormous flooded data storage through the service based cloud architecture by any type of cloud users through the remarkably efficient way using the methodologies like DBaaS, multi-tenancy, database integration. Among them, multi-tenancy and database integration can be applicable in the SaaS service model through the tightly coupled nature of service composition. But, this static service composition suffers from implementation complexity, cost factor, flexibility and scalability for further database adaptability and efficient data availability. Here, the proposed Dynamic Service Composition (abbreviated as DSC) methodology is sophisticated enough to retrieve different types of data from the multiple heterogeneous cloud databases after connectivity setup with new databases at runtime and on-demand basis. This dynamic database connectivity through the loosely coupled service composition is able to supply the requested data within a revolutionary computational speed. This methodology is able to overcome the challenges introduced by static service composition. DSC can govern multiple cloud databases through the flexible services connectivity without any information about their position in the cloud. This concept can be termed as database virtualization. Overall, the proposed DSC mechanism can monitor heterogeneous cloud databases and is responsible for significant growth over computational power for efficient data availability within a remarkable lower cost in a flexible and scalable way.","inCitations":["58f6ab939d6e62a3722edf135576b01199404bfe","5cbbb11df2aa2ed3f4bb0e08688013b881af74fc"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Dynamic service composition towards database virtualization for efficient data management","doi":"10.1109/confluence.2017.7943206","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/confluence.2017.7943206","venue":"2017 7th International Conference on Cloud Computing, Data Science & Engineering - Confluence"}

In addition, compared with sole cropping systems, intercropping is a promising approach for the crop production due to its lower reliance to chemical fertilizers. In this study, grain yield of soybean and biomass, chemical compositions and antioxidant activity of dragonhead essential oil in sole crop and dragonhead-soybean intercropping system under organic and chemical fertilizers were investigated. Land equivalent ratio (LER) was calculated as well. Results indicated intercropping and application of organic manure, increased soybean grain yield and dragonhead biomass. The LER value for soybean: dragonhead with ratios of 1:1 and1:2 under organic manure was greater than 1, indicating superiority of intercropping versus sol crop systems. GC–MS analysis showed that geranial, geranyl acetate, neral and piperitone were major compounds of dragonhead. The geranial and neral contents were increased in sole cropped dragonhead with application of chemical fertilizer, while the piperitone content was enhanced in sole cropped plants fertilized with organic manure. The highest of geranyl acetate content was observed in intercropped dragonhead plants fertilized with chemical fertilizer. Addition of organic manure lead to increase the antioxidant capacity of dragonhead in intercropped plots. The highest antioxidant activity of dragonhead (IC50 = 1.45 μgmL−1) was observed in one row of soybean + two rows of dragohead treated with organic manure. Overall, one row of soybean + two rows of dragohead with use of organic manure was more productive and had the highest LER value, antioxidant activity and a large amount of chemical compositions of essential oil. Thus this treatment could be adopted by the medicinal plant growers for appropriate production of dragonhead.","inCitations":["485e72064f9e29c806c0d0c1c4a3cebc500712c0","5304c23f5227b7ccd064d1e7661570012ba6e61d","165519593cca573ccb8fe27638a236935cb006b8","4ef6a912a2c9c66d37aefa41501a39b3efa67ceb","f18113b32c717ac1041696798916fec1db8ab9bc","6fb48c1ed0a52aebf52e85ece98c91f3ac94d1fb","2bc515e41d931fe595058dd1e47c018a15b0b498","5f03cb611d10823bd35dd612be4d281ede9e3884","e51293694a0ca108dcde42d6399c47892acb7b41","55b407cd960fd82405228c3b076c943e8ee2cc00","203b753e25d8df697e241b1be4292382bde8242a"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Chemical compositions of essential oil and antioxidant activity of dragonhead (Dracocephalum moldavica) in sole crop and dragonhead- soybean (Glycine max) intercropping system under organic manure and chemical fertilizers","doi":"10.1016/j.indcrop.2018.02.003","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.indcrop.2018.02.003","venue":""}

Processing yields for YER are relatively low, thus by-product volume is significant at up to 77% of whole fish weight (WFW). The objective of this research was to characterize yields and determine proximate composition, fatty acid (FA) and amino acid profiles, lipid classes, cholesterol content, and mineral composition of YER heads and livers. Heads of YER were the major by-product constituting 42% of WFW. YER livers made up only 2% of WFW. Livers contained high levels of lipids (28.5%) but were of small size, while lipid content of heads was 7.5%. Recovered oils were of high quality being predominantly triacylglycerols. Oils were similar in many aspects to oils from other demersal cold water marine finfish and were rich in omega-3 and omega-9 FA, and low in omega-6 FA. Protein content in heads and livers were 16% and 11.5%, respectively. Amino acid analysis revealed that the liver protein was of high quality. Mineral profile of livers was similar to values obtained from liver tissue from other cold water marine species. Overall, results indicated that YER by-products can be utilized for the production of good quality specialty ingredients that can be used as food and feed components.","inCitations":["0ebc17d064837da3c8ac26153e30ac1404736f66","d0b79f79bacd3901bc94aa404016a5f0bcd2baaf","7f58cc77f324cbf577aef848d340f7e568ecd814"],"pdfUrls":["https://naldc.nal.usda.gov/download/55568/PDF"],"title":"Composition of Heads and Livers of Yelloweye Rockfish (Sebastes ruberrimus) Harvested in Alaska","doi":"10.1080/10498850802581294","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1080/10498850802581294","venue":""}

Строение и иннервация мочевой системы столь сложны, что в про-цессе ее роста и развития она находится в состоянии неустойчивого равновесия. Особенно лабильны коор-динационные механизмы транспорта мочи, связанные с четким взаимодействием изгоняющей перистальтики и сфинктеральных преград. При незрелых парасимпа-тических структурах в зоне мочеточнико-пузырного со-устья происходят его спазм, нарушение оттока мочи из мочеточника в мочевой пузырь, его дилатация и фор-мирование функционального обструктивного мегауре-тера (МУ). Либо при незрелых симпатических нервных структурах возникают зияние устьев мочеточников и последующее рефлюксирование мочи из мочевого пу-зыря в мочеточник – так называемый «рефлюкс ново-рожденных». Пороки развития мочеточнико-пузырного сегмента и дисфункции его созревания нередко имеют общие сходные симптомы, и это вызывает определен-ные трудности и может привести к диагностическим ошибкам.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"dhttepem0hk|m`\" dhcmnqŠhjo`Šnknch)eqjhu qnqŠn\"mhi ln)eŠn)mhjn-org{pmncn qeclemŠ`, narqknbkemm{u trmj0hnmk|m{lh h npcmh)eqjhlh onpfemh\"lh r mnbnpnfdemm{u h cprdm{u deŠei ÃÎÓ ÂÏÎ «Ñåâåðî-Îñåòèíñêàÿ ãîñóäàðñòâåííàÿ ìåäèöèíñêàÿ àêàäåìèÿ Ðîñçäðàâà», Ðåñïóáëèêà Ñåâåðíàÿ Îñåòèÿ - Àëàíèÿ, ã.

If the rate change is substantial, the process is more efficient when the decimation or interpolation occurs in stages rather than in one step. Half-band filters are particularly efficient for effecting octave changes in sampling rate and nine digital filters are presented, eight of them half-band filters, to be used as components of multistage interpolators and decimators. Also presented is a procedure for combining the filters to produce multistage designs that meet a very wide range of accuracy requirements (stopband attenuation to 77 dB, passband ripple as low as 0.00014). The nine filters admit changes between sampling rates above 4W, where W is the nominal bandwidth of the signal. Established design techniques may be used to obtain efficient filters for conversion between 4W Hz sampling and 2W Hz, the \"baseband sampling rate.\" With these multistage filters, the possible interpolation and decimation ratios are all integer multiples of powers of two. To overcome this restriction we present a simple resampling technique that extends the range of designs to conversions between any two rates. The interpolation or decimation ratio need not be an integer or even rational. In fact, it can vary slightly as in a practical situation where the input signal and output signal are under the control of autonomous clocks. We demonstrate the approach by means of several design examples and compare its results with those obtained from the optimization scheme of Crochiere and Rabiner.","inCitations":["d6844935a1a8f1796b6f212639ace2896292ea03","24f70667fdc721fb9ae8448d40b6a0d937e3651d","abd3937b8f9820b48f243f74ab584cf4ac28196f","2c5ab25f94bce94082f0f90a083d93da52612f4c","aea7b316ba167d9a2960ddff2edf1a64efc95dbf","bcfe40de803bd7131c15ccfa8b279abf09c14924","dd472ddd0c38fe2de24113634c4afb006ec08d3c","32f5c7942d0dbde6e3e6952ade1a836bba2ab83b","62c9ca2515b44ffd1b9915efd7e6e3200ad860c0","5bcad0a60aeb90a35db01e49cf2ac92895dcf78f","03108f7805021b13d4ccaeb38e3fdc05b076830d","f5b622bf82b66771d80edd8f6a81e064d89dc76a","4f92000120e39fab70de2e8b175fa745c84d385a","656076de454118a9be43511fc3628e625333aa53","7cb157433af31c670e7089773fda9029469e8826","be113997318452e238831d352d982d18f5fcb02e","b730d118e6973f8eed04a7a9841de5a400010a5c","8c089fa48f2229b4b38709ddf676ef6afc7f64b7","2c2cc5536e7f61b3c24f4778888d0bef6d98d3e2","3f56a1949709d06cdb7e5ee692919dd850f756ef","a258f91935a33789f856dd22ee210f085b0729be","a1d597cf0522e38d55bfaebd7fc5a891ef9485bc","ac1f800e33240147f773cfe346a4d0d61be931d7","39f40e5d7976293b45b52e68add438c07f21ccaf","25e627f329b17e344c05e39f461f6a04c22c3bff","5a3ff53c0feb3ae91af46f228af01ea60c37c483","7d673f9eca1b5ee7faf1d54ed83f9d768b7f8a0d","141dbf1fdb9932e1885628434b80b4aa7adcf058","4925878a4b5e7be184377532e7b59e45b323ee50","45de04bc8a5b063b6e953d74006ca86a06419e07","f3883c1a1434b4c15699fd4bbbf55a0476036455","975e12da4be91795f9f159f01c2177559f7d01a5","b721fce80765fa58a314453bb585636a448a66d1","95accb8044aaac4b0740f3df0804fff063d9eb04","e4a2afa4c49a2216f7cdf9269e07b7344292de33","1f0e8084b6943566875e832a376baf761fcfdc0b","594f0d01ee9b358de70a52f3ede57f14fe204cfc","a54257d106d9cb3d706e4ad02d1cd9ecac4b1947","032f718280ac4006f7c18bc26cf9868146dc9874","4c165a5772a9ac7735055785ea5c6a53f5028c31","c00e56c9bd358740cef3fe431c51fa20d5f773cb","d379aae5db97b11ea5552b9e782408f48ed7780f"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Nine digital filters for decimation and interpolation","doi":"10.1109/TASSP.1977.1162921","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASSP.1977.1162921","venue":""}

Four major categories of factors are reviewed here: the effects of mechanical loading history, environmental effects, effects of rubber formulation, and effects due to dissipative aspects of the constitutive response of rubber. For each category, primary factors are described, and existing literature is presented and reviewed. Rubber's fatigue behavior is extremely sensitive to both the maximum and minimum cyclic load limits. Other aspects of the mechanical load history are also discussed, including the effects of static loaded periods (“annealing”), load sequence, multiaxiality, frequency, and loading waveform.

Our objective was to assess TNF-α antagonist prescription patterns in this context in France.\n\n\nMETHODS\nBetween 2007 and 2009, 102 rheumatologists, internists, and pediatricians in French university hospitals and private practice prospectively recruited biologics-naïve patients with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) (DAS28>3.2 despite methotrexate therapy), spondyloarthritis (SA) (BASDAI≥4 despite non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug [NSAID] use), and juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) (unresponsive to methotrexate). Patients were monitored prospectively for 1 year.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOf the 543 RA, 287 SA, and 53 JIA patients included in the study, 382 RA, 171 SA, and 28 JIA patients had complete follow-up data available after 1 year. Among these patients, 110/382 (28.8%) with RA, 81/171 (47.4%) with SA, and 26/28 (92.9%) with JIA received at least one TNF-α antagonist dose during the 1-year follow-up. The main physician-reported reason for not starting TNF-α antagonists in patients with RA or SA was low disease activity (72% for RA and 67% for SA); absence of TNF-α antagonist therapy was due to patient refusal in only 10% and to contraindications in 6% to 7% of cases.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn France, TNF-α antagonists, which are fully reimbursed by the national health insurance system, were used almost routinely in JIA patients unresponsive to methotrexate and were given to about half the SA patients with BASDAI≥4 despite NSAID use and a third of RA patients with DAS28>3.2 despite methotrexate therapy.","inCitations":["7b2b813648b15c3e568ef7e7e01c95dfa6a048a6","88216be39655516b9f765b62a2ac869c55a5ab14","953e78f6125073a298dfedbe3bde6694d69b307f","599747e609a3ff3aeb25af7a3bc5ecaef1db2718"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Which patients with rheumatoid arthritis, spondyloarthritis, or juvenile idiopathic arthritis receive TNF-α antagonists in France?

This insight is obtained from low-temperature magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) spectroscopy. In the case of high-spin ferric hemes, MCD spectroscopy allows for the identification of a multitude of charge-transfer (CT) transitions. Using optically-detected magnetic saturation curves, out-of-plane polarized CT transitions between the heme and its axial ligand(s) can be identified. In the case of ferric Cytochrome P450cam, the corresponding S(σ)→Fe(III) CT transition can be used as a probe for the {Fe(III)-axial ligand} interaction, indicating that the hydrogen bonding network of the proximal Cys only plays a limited role for fine-tuning the Fe(III)-S(Cys) interaction. In the case of high-spin ferrous hemes with axial His/imidazole coordination, our MCD-spectroscopic investigations have uncovered a direct correlation between the strength of the hydrogen bond to the proximal imidazole ligand and the ground state of the complexes. With neutral imidazole coordination, the doubly occupied d-orbital of high-spin iron(II) is of d(π) character, located orthogonal to the heme plane. As the strength of the hydrogen bond increases, this orbital rotates into the heme plane, changing the ground state of the complex.","inCitations":["a8f5b1c912b70ca57ca40f8a6af70f0a30c6f3ce","fb5e448ea265c9862b9efaee2d5daf22471f19d1","9ed245c02a37631d352307a48cd19689ca846833","290f7e52710eac64858c5437b55b1fcee0c2b078","c61b6cd97e2d9c7e866f465140704a082f447a91"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Elucidating second coordination sphere effects in heme proteins using low-temperature magnetic circular dichroism spectroscopy.","doi":"10.1016/j.jinorgbio.2012.02.033","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jinorgbio.2012.02.033","venue":"Journal of inorganic biochemistry"}

Because testing was performed in various reference laboratories, test results were classified into 1 of 3 categories: (a) markedly elevated, (b) moderately elevated, or (c) normal. Patient demographics, clinical history, test results, imaging study findings, and pathology records were reviewed.\n\n\nRESULTS\nA total of 3980 tests were ordered for 1898 patients. Pretest probability was 2.2% (based on 681 patients in whom pheochromocytoma was confirmed or excluded), and hypertension was the most common indication for testing. The number of patients tested and the number of tests ordered increased over the years. The ordering pattern stabilized since 2006 when urinary metanephrines, urinary catecholamines, and plasma metanephrines were ordered more frequently. Sensitivity was highest for urinary metanephrines and vanillylmandelic acid, specificity was highest for vanillylmandelic acid and urinary catecholamines, and positive likelihood ratio was highest for vanillylmandelic acid. Positive predictive value for markedly elevated test results was 39% to 83%, while that for moderately elevated test results was only 2% to 14%.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nOrdering pattern and test performance differ significantly from those recommended and reported by large centers. The best testing strategy should incorporate local experience. Categorizing test results as markedly elevated, moderately elevated, and normal is important for result interpretation.","inCitations":["a71922273260fcff27a910f5f925187039b4f379","3813d8d77beaa67633643bbc25fd13ce5bd3c24b","5886c91cdc6c2736d6b7451d75178499c84ecc24","1c959f5d16ccc492ac70ca22f7bd9baf3b5a8d64","52944b095ac9eabd27da90d18d9de0dba72c1f1e"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Ordering pattern and performance of biochemical tests for diagnosing pheochromocytoma between 2000 and 2008.","doi":"10.4158/EP09032OR","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.4158/EP09032OR","venue":"Endocrine practice : official journal of the American College of Endocrinology and the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists"}

Data were collected through two semistructured short interviews that were conducted in person or by telephone.\n\n\nRESULTS\nFive themes emerged: Authentic emotion, Judgment, It's only a matter of time, I can't do this alone, and Missed opportunities. Strong emotions were experienced at the time of diagnosis. Some women felt judged by healthcare professionals and others based on having GDM. Some were concerned about future risk of developing Type 2 DM. There is a lack of understanding of GDM by women at the time of diagnosis and after they give birth. The majority of women in this study noted that healthcare professionals did not discuss future implications of Type 2 DM and the need for follow-up glucose testing. Many opportunities are missed to provide education and support to facilitate lifestyle interventions.\n\n\nCLINICAL NURSING IMPLICATIONS\nSelf-management of GDM is more likely to be successful if women understand GDM and believe that they can manage it. Nurses should use every opportunity to provide women with GDM information and available resources. This may be important in rural communities where fewer resources are available for support. Nurses should recognize that negative emotions may affect motivation of women to understand and ask questions about GDM. Nurses can favorably influence the return rates for postpartum glucose testing by raising awareness of implications of GDM on future health.","inCitations":["1add8ff290fcf8b04a4443b9a2f9a74b54dd8baa","e5ca8d18d2f3535f3f34708ea091c9f0b2410375","03bb4eafafa28f37e89cb9035deb0831b16d38a2","72ff916778b149075d281640a244410710188972"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Living with gestational diabetes in a rural community.","doi":"10.1097/NMC.0000000000000047","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1097/NMC.0000000000000047","venue":"MCN.
