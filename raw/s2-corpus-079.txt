Progressive macrocephaly is even considered a warning sign for the development of autism. We evaluated the prevalence of an abnormal head circumference in children with autism in Israel and compared it with the head circumferences of children with developmental language disorder and children with normal development. We did not find a higher prevalence of macrocephaly among Israeli children with autism spectrum disorder (4.4%). Although children with autism spectrum disorder had a significantly higher rate of a head circumference above the 75th percentile compared with children with developmental language disorder, it was not significantly different compared with normal controls. We conclude that there is no increased prevalence of macrocephaly in Israeli children with autism; this can be attributed to a different genetic background.","inCitations":["87c96e5a3f7c398263f16d7d3c5770e300e8dcd4","7e3f07f12da0e8f9a0243440d1816298b93e3e1a","5585cf9ae0d2c0e1ca15d2f41b407840559e15a9","703d235c0118bce4987f4ce253f11f1b17362482","20d0cfd3b70d7eab4ab872e5dbb3581f337ee900","fb55af0c3e93e2a84200b98aae112594c1d72f56","c0f22a28150456a84cdb30126840e830e6729ba5","d2a5a09f65aca7745e812e9aaae39151a98a39d3","7dd0be19ef731523375304f61a784bf80791d417"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Israeli Children With Autism Spectrum Disorder Are not Macrocephalic","doi":"10.1177/0883073810387666","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1177/0883073810387666","venue":"Journal of child neurology"}

By using the established FCGCM, the influences of rotor slot indexing number (RSIN) and magnetic permeability of the rotor wedge on field current under OPS of 180° were studied. A magnetic no uniform coefficient (MNC) was proposed to evaluate rotor magnetic field nonuniformity. The relations of the field current oscillation ratio and MNC to RSIN and magnetic permeability of rotor wedge were investigated.

The search for new methods and techniques for managing the property complex faces a number of problems that are a promise of developing scientific approaches to the development of new progressive methods of making managerial decisions. The article considers alternative options for improving the quality of enterprise management and suggests the direction of improving the organization’s cost management system. A number of limiting factors, which allowed the author to determine the target indicators of the presented model, determines the presented objective function of enterprise value. It is permissible to change and expand the composition of the indicators and the approaches used to assess the value of the enterprise. The recommended model allows determining the reserves of increasing the efficiency of the enterprise, affecting the value of the property complex. Dependence of the singled out evaluation criteria and the targets of strategies for increasing the value of enterprises is indicated. The main stages of the enterprise value management process are considered as a single concept of increasing the current value of the organization. The characteristic of the concept of management aimed at creating value – Value Based Management (VBM) is presented. The main principles of VBM aimed at qualitative improvement of strategic and operational decisions at all levels of management of the organization are singled out. Article considers the technology of introducing a cost management system based on the example of a construction organization. The main stages of enterprise cost management aimed at long-term sustainable growth in the value of the organization are identified. Particular attention is paid to the stages of analysis of the contribution of production and management units to the total value of the enterprise and the formation of a group of performance indicators and the effectiveness of the enterprise value management system. Place and role of operational control over the value of assets and the use of management personnel are indicated.

Today this requires a large amount of manual labor so an automated system using cameras would be very beneficial. We focus on the geometric part of the problem, that is, how to get accurate three-dimensional data from images of a road or an intersection. This is essential in order to correctly identify different events and incidents, for example to estimate when two cars gets dangerously close to each other. The proposed method uses a standard tracker to find corresponding points between frames. Then a RANSAC-type algorithm detects points that are likely to belong to the same vehicle. To fully exploit the fact that vehicles rotate and translate only in the ground plane, the structure from motion is estimated using an optimization approach based on the L∞-norm.

Most of these use refrigerant fluids, which affect the environment and increase global warming. Therefore, many territories have laws that mandate the use of environmentally-friendly refrigerants with zero ozone depletion potential (ODP) and low global warming potential (GWP). The ACCs in most existing motor vehicles use R134a as a refrigerant, which has a high GWP. The aim of this study is to investigate alternatives to R134a that are characterized by environmentally-friendly qualities such as low GWP, are available and can be charged directly into an existing system without modification. Therefore, thermodynamic analysis of an AAC system containing R134a was conducted and the results compared with blends formed by mixing hydrocarbons (HCs) (R290/R600a), which are flammable, environmentally-friendly and ultra-low GWP refrigerants, with R134a (R600a/R290/134a). The mixing of HCs and R134a led to reduced flammability and used R134a in a ratio within low GWP criteria, to decrease the cost and the amount of its banked. Refprop software was used for the thermodynamic analysis. Theoretical results revealed that the blend of (R600a/R290/134a) with a mass ratio (43/35/22) has low GWP, provides the same level of refrigerant performance and can be used directly without any modification to the system.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Investigation of Environmentally-Friendly Alternative Refrigerants for Automotive Air Conditioning Systems","doi":"10.1088/1757-899x/671/1/012139","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1088/1757-899x%2F671%2F1%2F012139","venue":""}

In the research reported here, real-time LI-IT-TOFMS measurements were carried out on gaseous 2-4 chlorinated PCBs in order to evaluate the applicability of an environmental monitoring method. With respect to ion-trap storage for PCBs, we found that the effect was due to the driving RF voltage on the ring electrode in the ion trap. For PCBs ions produced by laser irradiation, we observed that it was more efficient to reach the center of the ion trap by using a gated RF voltage rather than by using a continuous RF voltage. The ion trajectories in the ion trap were simulated by SIMION 7.0. We found that the voltage of the exit end cap electrode affected both the number of ions trapped and the orbit of ions inside the trap cell. Optimization of this parameter was performed using both simulated and experimental results. The achievable PCBs sensitivity for real-time (1 min) measurement using the LI-IT-TOFMS method was found to be in the pptV range (<0.01 mg/m3N) by means of a comparison with the conventional gas sampling/GS-MS method. A satisfactory proportional relationship was confirmed between the laser-based and conventional results.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/analsci/21/9/21_9_1111/_pdf"],"title":"Rapid analysis of polychlorinated biphenyls in the gas phase with resonance-enhanced two-photon ionization: optimal injection of ions into the ion-trap storage/time-of-flight mass spectrometer.","doi":"10.2116/analsci.21.1111","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.2116/analsci.21.1111","venue":"Analytical sciences : the international journal of the Japan Society for Analytical Chemistry"}

These dendrimers are shown to form stable nanoparticles with DNA, promote cell uptake mainly via macropinocytosis, and act as effective nanovectors for DNA transfection in vitro on epithelial and fibroblast cells and, most importantly, in vivo in the mouse thymus, an exceedingly challenging organ for immune gene therapy. Collectively, these results validate our rational design approach of structurally flexible dendrimers with a chemically defined structure as effective nanovectors for gene delivery, and demonstrate the potential of these dendrimers in intrathymus gene delivery for future applications in immune gene therapy.","inCitations":["a72a84fdda4c2d7577270ba60f531943440c810d","ffde1fc58977f55d23d6653eec90e96f95be52f5","18aedaa1b6226955c078ce4b783ba3fad130308e","b37f0684967c144b19ac7972058dff5643ac0336","3e1de636e72ae6444a9c1684ff251fc6ea92de61","7916312a9d1438cc7ebedc3fc57203da7dc3d17e","36ad95e4399c6a28dd47c3887fee6626423c529e","51fc5e8ebc0d5bb3b753aa8a35993c6fc5166b52","bf60352c0bf0e39d7121a3de303177f027ac756c","f6ba19e52a75ffa1f34795b2d97c64f5c89d6def","98e05a951112a66accbe2f9462038cedfa209f36","afd2a23f446f5b0b2c6296858fecd92ee5aba1b3","a089e5764ac063367026dcdbd7c740c1991a5065","301e62e38a07626642764cb1b3ce6920de9c4209","c6d80150d118adaaf7e06ef6b3230e718ffab595","50d9132036b84bab0ec071600de66436f7daf0a7","81839bed8dcbd64ecafbd8c768a895dfbf943a1f","83f88ec70122f3e8cce1de7c88990af2ad0bb792","b4b456664b04b5835ada98dbcc8ba36ee74b539c","ba92e7b6ab82f0e9264d3ce692248311ed7085e3"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.mose.units.it/doc/p0473.pdf"],"title":"Structurally flexible triethanolamine core PAMAM dendrimers are effective nanovectors for DNA transfection in vitro and in vivo to the mouse thymus.","doi":"10.1021/bc200275g","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1021/bc200275g","venue":"Bioconjugate chemistry"}

The blood pressure recordings scarcely revealed relevant findings. The diurnal rhythm of heart rate in endogenous depressives is less pronounced than in healthy subjects, a phasal shift not being noted. A correlation between diurnal variation of depression symptomatology and the circadian rhythm of hear rate could be presumed on the basis of these findings. The heart rate curve is further flattened, almost levelling off, on sleep deprivation. The extent of this change is related to the therapeutic effect of sleep deprivation. A less pronounced diurnal rhythm of heart rate was also noted in neurotic depressives; however, there was no relationship between the therapeutic effect of sleep deprivation and its influence on heart rate.","inCitations":["a1cf3c71a8c99cdce6c55b50b3f3ff36a9d0f63a"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Circadian rhythm of circulatory functions in depressives and on sleep deprivation.","doi":"10.1159/000468305","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1159/000468305","venue":"International pharmacopsychiatry"}

Given the evolution of computing techniques but also of the software digital terrain modelling made its presence felt increasingly, and established itself as a basic concept in many areas, due to many advantages. At present, most digital terrain modelling is derived from three alternative sources such as ground surveys, photogrammetric data capture or from digitized cartographic sources. A wide range of features may be extracted from digital terrain models, such as surface, specific points and landmarks, linear features but also areal futures like drainage basins, hills or hydrological basins. The paper highlights how the use appropriate software for the preparation of a digital terrain model, a model which is subsequently used to study hydrographic basins according to various geomorphological parameters. As a final goal, it shows the link between digital terrain modelling and hydrographic basins study that can be used to optimize the correlation between digital model terrain and hydrological processes in order to obtain results as close to the real field processes.","inCitations":["86b0d6cd66f211fd287e8436e1e278f90ece55b5"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Hydrographic Basins Analysis Using Digital Terrain Modelling","doi":"10.1088/1757-899X/245/6/062034","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1088/1757-899X%2F245%2F6%2F062034","venue":""}

The content of soluble phenolics in the culture medium was also evaluated. NaCl or mannitol above concentrations of 50 mM decreased pineapple shoot multiplication and fresh weight significantly. Two hundred mM NaCl decreased multiplication rate by 71.5% and cluster fresh weight by 40.0%. NaCl increased 2.4 times the levels of other aldehydes; 1.4 times the soluble phenolics in shoots; and 1.4 times the phenolics excreted to the culture medium. On the other hand, mannitol decreased the multiplication rate and cluster fresh weight by about 60%. Mannitol increased the contents of chlorophyll b 1.4 times and soluble phenolics 2.1 times. Results indicated that pineapple cv. MD2 is more sensitive to NaCl than to mannitol. Multiplication rates indicate that a 50% reduction was obtained with 37.4 mM NaCl and 66.5 mM mannitol.

Se propuso estudiar si hay cambios en la MBV vaginal en mujeres PM luego de la administracion de estriol y si estos se reflejan en la formacion o modificacion de las BPV. Se estudiaron 16 pacientes a las que se les realizo estudio del contenido vaginal y la formacion de BPV mediante una capa celular sobre un dispositivo de vidrio (DV).

Se estudiaron 16 pacientes, de las cuales 12 asistieron al primer control luego del tratamiento y 6 concurrieron al segundo.

The pulse length was varied from 7 fs to 500 fs with intensity ranging from 4 × 10(15) to 2.5 × 10(14) W∕cm(2). Time and position sensitive detection allows us to observe all fragments in coincidence. By representing the final dissociation geometry with Dalitz plots, we can identify the underlying breakup dynamics. We observe for the first time that there are two stepwise dissociation pathways for N2O(3+): (1) N2O(3+) → N(+) + NO(2+) → N(+) + N(+) + O(+) and (2) N2O(3+) → N2 (2+) + O(+) → N(+) + N(+) + O(+) as well as one for N2O(4+) → N(2+) + NO(2+) → N(2+) + N(+) + O(+). The N2 (2+) stepwise channel is suppressed for longer pulse length, a phenomenon which we attribute to the influence which the structure of the 3+ potential has on the dissociating wave packet propagation. Finally, by observing the total kinetic energy released for each channel as a function of pulse duration, we show the increasing importance of charge resonance enhanced ionization for channels higher than 3+.","inCitations":["bf5de35bb0d2fe854d24c2d54d8d1d5c90091eb3","228687d16eb6efa10d85752e26fd216620821ba9"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"N2O ionization and dissociation dynamics in intense femtosecond laser radiation, probed by systematic pulse length variation from 7 to 500 fs.","doi":"10.1063/1.4804653","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1063/1.4804653","venue":"The Journal of chemical physics"}

We find that concern about tax evasion may produce a U-shaped relationship between an individual’s income and preferences for taxation in line with recent theoretical studies. Moreover, we find that the perceived level of tax evasion, the perceived waste of public resources and the intensity of tax enforcement reduce public support for taxation. In contrast, concern about fairness in tax compliance favours it.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"The Ends Against the Middle.

Hence, there is a critical need for new regenerative repair strategies that provide effective mechanical reinforcement of rotator cuff repair as well as stimulate and enhance the patient's intrinsic healing potential. This article will discuss and identify appropriate models for translating regenerative medicine therapies for rotator cuff repair. Animal models are an essential part of the research and development pathway; however, no one animal model reproduces all of the features of the human injury condition. The rat shoulder is considered the most appropriate model to investigate the initial safety, mechanism, and efficacy of biologic treatments aimed to enhance tendon-to-bone repair. Whereas large animal models are considered more appropriate to investigate the surgical methods, safety and efficacy of the mechanical-or combination biologic/mechanical-strategies are ultimately needed for treating human patients. The human cadaver shoulder model, performed using standard-of-care repair techniques, is considered the best for establishing the surgical techniques and mechanical efficacy of various repair strategies at time zero. While preclinical models provide a critical aspect of the translational pathway for engineered tissues, controlled clinical trials and postmarketing surveillance are also needed to define the efficacy, proper indications, and the method of application for each new regenerative medicine strategy.","inCitations":["60baaf6c0d9aee5d7dfd377f4958e2d770090b6f","c06bb17bd2af774bd59850103dd12c7d4b450e3a","cf05b4bc4c4528abf22b8982fff4e2f70c82f9cb","3948ed3e9fbe6ff4f00b2795df692c263d1a1e24","a1d4c5dd5aeb06a8850f587e4dffd9c3aabb3bf8","75658733680abc7745d37fe08d6a4cd1a68ed578","b9475c3ac124c1999d2e83501e6b2ca492c07226","81b90457f830f91c20e6aa3c7f11abf1990b1ece","a29617214226e077e9ff679f23d272a23cdfaa76","d392f8e4f805ba45fe1c1c434f6e25aa449a89b0","033557530dcf187d3dc7bfcdb23ab861eb9637d9","ee8802179f09d349cc98a0701ee67047b71894ec","92630c17a124b268ee627b9899c31c3a59df46ae","1ad3c9636dec9c6deb9c689a24d7be87be56d707","b03c754b333a12dc3d58d514e325ebe6ddf34d01","3f5efbead2be2ec795784c44b07935278c76a196","1223eb04076bd47569c715f38ceeca1f279ef134","50b2143721323eabd3aef151f7683357c7b9dbdd","80327ece4406c7f5f3249e341818f9a2374a7cf3","0a625110a429ca71b6d940cf23bfa4d8852aa957","05bacef9bd16a64dfb6ecd82849d4a1fe6dde4a4","9d3c23f01f315333a13dc3acb14bf37effd9c260","7683b26c6006d53325b260ba4f206b55e869abe0","ae73e0dd870ce05c922b0657b817e2fc53ae650a","8d67c84f0c59bd2b7796014436234657c0b648b1","ba1b041f678f9e16d45a4f0de23a30838f018330","f96ffd9391f769197037876280a3f3a79bb0e547","babf683d83df7c8de568ce1b2dc8c095e3ab49be","f5517238c73f2e73ae9e310b98aab5670f619a32","35e3a3c8d52f59faf606b8c9185e658c7494d2c9","330da657a41504ae45221f3b6de0856d5c9491d7","3aa65710aff141df1aa85e2b5fec8fe89d708653","5ae8f3d787d335894a27b5c523d9ed85b12bbc88","747bc85c953ce58f0325839476df05b68178c744","dcc67b245773c99c23db77e027711d42c6aac136","f9c836fc9b1cee55a51f53094db6313217a01b2a","502e67a4ff4aae375a2657eda7595a341120b96b","cb2e3624d9193744fc3d9a13e5783320951c6f88","c5b5e6a09ea9cbe141259e15ce4679b5401dffa0","1832cecf6bc1bf1fcde62ce49687a65891040420"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Preclinical models for translating regenerative medicine therapies for rotator cuff repair.","doi":"10.1089/ten.TEB.2009.0209","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1089/ten.TEB.2009.0209","venue":"Tissue engineering.

In this method,the transmission grid is divided into several control areas by tie-lines and 500 kV transformers. The proposed method can balance each area power with tracing the scheduled interchange among areas and security constraints in normal condition. Furthermore,an alternate strategy with minimum risk is provided by the proposed method in the case of the system without feasible solution available. The proposed approach has been put in real practice and proved efficient.","inCitations":["cb4add9f440fa54caf2db346f7fc1b822d4e97b2","c536a92878a834f8d5cd2ed5a5c0d2835f28ecc3","fd534bd390ef1e97e067f90d19591651a003c023","8a876b75c5448afec014cd34f1a67256c6b78b0c","813265ed73af2df68b265be2999887a138a52d9c"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"A Multi-area Coordinated Power Dispatch Method for Provincial Power Grid","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

However, because of time, cost, and scoring reliability constraints associated with this format, CR questions are being increasingly replaced by multiple-choice (MC) questions in formal exams. The integrated testlet (IT) is a recently-developed question structure designed to provide a proxy of the pedagogical advantages of CR questions while procedurally functioning as set of MC questions. ITs utilize an answer-until-correct response format that provides immediate confirmatory or corrective feedback, and they thus allow not only for the granting of partial credit in cases of initially incorrect reasoning, but furthermore the ability to build cumulative question structures. Here, we report on a study that directly compares the functionality of ITs and CR questions in introductory physics exams. To do this, CR questions were converted to concept-equivalent ITs, and both sets of questions were deployed in midterm and final exams. We find that both question types provide adequate discrimination between stronger and weaker students, with CR questions discriminating slightly better than the ITs. Meanwhile, an analysis of inter-rater scoring of the CR questions raises serious concerns about the reliability of the granting of partial credit when this traditional assessment technique is used in a realistic (but non optimized) setting. Furthermore, we show evidence that partial credit is granted in a valid manner in the ITs. Thus, together with consideration of the vastly reduced costs of administering IT-based examinations compared to CR-based examinations, our findings indicate that ITs are viable replacements for CR questions in formal examinations where it is desirable to both assess concept integration and to reward partial knowledge, while efficiently scoring examinations.","inCitations":["94e5209bbf7e7ec49e73b57b3db7d43f432c184c","62a8b291655927811c77a2b6ed5cb5df63651eb0","3c88017e5a0e33d713b6311c658dec58e2041f05","40c10d2e7cbf6e86ca9415607f6140a36faf26e0","7051d99401e72490508a0c078761077f17c790a2","d793dff488619f298f4393214fe4e65ac69963eb"],"pdfUrls":["https://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.3375v2.pdf","http://www.aaronslepkov.com/docs/Slepkov_CRvsIT_PhysRevSTPER2014.pdf"],"title":"A comparison of integrated testlet and constructed-response question formats","doi":"10.1103/PhysRevSTPER.10.020120","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevSTPER.10.020120","venue":""}

Near infrared photons can penetrate by diffusion into tissue up to several centimeters due to low absorption by intrinsic chromophors (e.g. hemoglobine). During the last years optical mammography has become field of growing interest. Several prototypes of near infrared scanners have been developed for clinical studies in order to obtain transillumination images of the breast. The results indicated, that discrimination of tumors located up to several centimeters below the tissue surface (e.g. breast tumors) from surrounding healthy tissue did not succeed with sufficient specificity. The diagnostic potential of near infrared imaging can be enhanced using dyes as contrast agents. Specially designed cyanine dye derivatives are potential contrast agents because of their suitable optical properties and pharmacokinetic behaviour leading to an increased tumor fluorescence in animals after intravenous injection.","inCitations":["25da96adedbde080055b25c983fb222658b59ff6","33956dd0f0632a0104923732f619c73d905959f1","e09df355805e5da8a370254197a13dba360b4f5f","fb1987a985dcfdc247f04b6efc20b303799268fa","a9e022e17be99823f1340f5c2056b2294da9bfd3","42577378976412f6b091bbf06d717201b46047c5","5089a4c2db55418391f1d09774ce28704174d5fd","e7a927cef813f6523630c43e3224df95b5aababc","cd9c499cc9062382c8613df23bfbd6b41e663036"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"[Contrast media for optical mammography].","doi":"","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"Der Radiologe"}

Opium poppy was transformed with constitutively expressed cDNA of codeinone reductase (PsCor1.1), the penultimate step in morphine synthesis. Most transgenic lines showed significant increases in capsule alkaloid content in replicated glasshouse and field trials over 4 years. The morphinan alkaloid contents on a dry weight basis were between 15% and 30% greater than those in control high-yielding genotypes and control non-transgenic segregants. Transgenic leaves had approximately 10-fold greater levels of Cor transcript compared with non-transgenic controls. Two cycles of crossing of the best transgenic line into an elite high-morphine genotype resulted in significant increases in morphine and total alkaloids relative to the elite recurrent parent. No significant changes in alkaloid profiles or quantities were observed in leaf, roots, pollen and seed.","inCitations":["84cd60d0d26ba7e6df10aefe3e9c2177fe112aec","de9c31797544b6c910039cb80872b88cf149c453","0e1e296d76995d4e95e180f6fa3a4bb94ae6601a","578fac338ae7dbb145cf053a2c2da2df5e7a0241","7f876bdc0dcadef76b0f7f862907ec193df83265","3d03c992ddee33b28349cf264c8dbbf44b5c75fc","a962f62ab808e119a41e30a1f11d3838bf444fd5","cfa9704f132bf8d0fd653ddd634d8ff368a17749","b9d8d5f47ed4e7dcd9b04e92d436be9b2e9ef413","6ed0b2d7fe800da5d3c0de7deefc201aee8536bb","a1a490f6dacf79f4433fcf47c32931e89a9ee9f0","79f7bb23342554a09f155655083923c77c4af597","8f5f051fbb3500b100bee9fc3f0b19fadf82873d","9bc23e3732d21334213f0b426c4413281aa37b4a","3e5619a8ae6f5e248bd32e7cffe5a1b3024e976c","920097db1ea675302a5ac6c57528b75fedc63ca9","a6eea2b75ecf8d6957231a0544016c079a61134e","60b543e679705ae2937f82b098befa479cb1b327","b2e610830c423e2bd79e8eb92a217a3bbe0a5a7d","b1a79ef5c7c6f9adbd99ab4a2612ef444ee8510b","afab998b4d3498b7a8327dea915eeda0c4aabd8c","1875f22217f420b46e434091b92d36602373246e","cc6173c6f53a316780caed9afb5b0e4060b8896f","ab4e5007720b5f0ae2ce32b77f4de3dab96a3e7b","90250e59f700fa23f348a9943fff8277899cf1ce","9069bcd93c7bb169916cb4b191b261718d7aaee6","05ffd2d118c859458cc3febd4da5f83720800d24","f941c2a11101edf04d88fb7886f86964534c701d","dbf68e74dcccf86be170d1c1dff2f512f3c54e48","a5230602d47a4b1b0b8f471528590ec2215fbfc9","3301bde213722bc5fa7217af289fbcf564389715","70b3836f7b7cc9c445be26a0b3de2455711c7a39","1c4a269692149a65d096aa85b4694c61c7e94a47","01aafb94f25f0afb62c7e450a971444244d9fcbd","c5761629be1410b86f27a1d9d991bb2becd43391","ad3eeac7445dab7967b53ccf216f33ec06bd7940","dd4c44f1a550d5ec9567de5c15cb95ea11e3d1af","5d762cb29723242cd6d950c15d1da04963e2959c","86b6b81ff89a53fd444efadd7be9938e650434f6","3d41d09f2510849357877a0b852c9508656e682c","be6077d7d99a7f638a0e6f912740e42c6a5d6edf","916dba74d72ba70a255ba55dfc03a89ca3651ef9","9969774aae863a870c9ac35041df5f80e406387d","5f09fd3032011cf35156943e953cabf13465aae9","26254ebce3f5669b19fa9f88e044f7c27aa57aee","8899039759c72974f25f6a2133d3fbf43929ac7e","422be52d13bcb0f374d3298302fc9b014fc22653"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Increasing morphinan alkaloid production by over-expressing codeinone reductase in transgenic Papaver somniferum.","doi":"10.1111/j.1467-7652.2006.00212.x","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-7652.2006.00212.x","venue":"Plant biotechnology journal"}

Concern over residual toxic or allergenic agents has encouraged the search for other practical methods to disinfect or sterilize used hemodialyzers. The use of moist heat has been proposed as an attractive alternative to chemical disinfection, as the effectiveness of moist heat in inactivating microorganisms is well established and, inherently, should be less toxic than chemical means. However, despite the initial appeal of heat reprocessing, validation and maintenance procedures necessary to ensure a reproducible heat cycle are likely to be burdensome with the currently available hardware.

Initially, entangled SWNT, Fe 2 O 3 and NaDSSB mixtures were randomly dispersed in the fluid. Upon extended exposure to the magnetic field, the mixture slowly vibrated, the nanoparticles straightened and aligned with respect to the magnetic field. The aligned nanoparticle chains appeared to be continuous and unbroken, forming a combination of aligned particles and clusters. Because of the semi-continuous nature of these nanosuspensions and the inherent viscosity of the fluid, some minutes are required for the mixtures to respond to the applied magnetic field and align. Time dependent thermal conductivity experiments indicate that the alignment process dominates the thermal conductivity enhancement as opposed to micro convection. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) images also show that the SWNT and Fe 2 O 3 particles are well aligned under the influence of the magnetic field. Verification of the assumption that electrostatic attraction between nanotube/surfactant and metal oxides makes aggregation happen was obtained, by changing the nature of the charge of the surfactant from a negative charge (NaSDDB) to a positive charge (CTAB). Compared with the alignment of Ni coated SWNTs that contain chemical bonds between Ni and C atoms, this electrostatic force induced alignment could maintain nanotube perfect conjugate structures which result in excellent thermal, electrical, and mechanical properties. The alignment of the carbon nanotubes in nanosuspensions may offer new opportunities for the development of nanofluids.

Encounter data were searched for timely well-baby visits and for emergency care or hospitalization for selected conditions.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThirty-four percent of infants received five or more timely visits during the first year of life. African American and Hispanic babies were less likely than white babies to have had all the recommended care (OR = 0.49, 95% CI: 0.37, 0.63; OR = 0.53, 95% CI: 0.41, 0.69; respectively). Being up-to-date with well-baby care was not associated with a reduced likelihood of emergency care (OR = 0.89; 95% CI: 0.72, 1.09) or hospitalization (OR = 1.23; 95% CI: 0.83, 1.34).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nMost babies did not get timely care. Well-baby care was not associated with reduced use of emergency care or hospitalization for ambulatory care-sensitive conditions.","inCitations":["15fe38e53a48af10c5dacc99cbbeb1dbfe414825","ea590fb536dcda715badaa98bc7a7097893eca08"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Well-baby care in Connecticut's Medicaid managed-care program.","doi":"","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"Connecticut medicine"}

It was found that below a temperature of approximately 350°C the rate decreased when the oxygen/oxide interface was made negative with respect to the nickel.

For consistent comparisons among tumors or among successive studies of the same tumor, we propose to estimate the total contrast agent-accessible volume fraction of tumor, including blood plasma, v(pe), and an average transfer rate constant across all tumor compartments, K(trans.av), by fitting a three-compartment tumor model and then calculating the area under the tumor impulse-response function (= v(pe)) and the ratio area under the tumor impulse response function over mean residence time in tumor (= K(trans.av)). If the duration of dynamic contrast enhanced MRI was too short to extrapolate the tumor impulse-response function to infinity with any confidence, then conditional parameters v(pe)(*) and K(trans.av*) should be calculated from the available incomplete impulse response function. Median decreases of 33% were found for both v(pe)(*) and K(trans.av*) in glioblastoma patients (n = 16) 24 hours after the administration of bevacizumab (P < 0.001). Median total contrast-enhancing tumor volume was reduced by 18% (P < 0.0001). The combined changes of tumor volume, v(pe)(*), and K(trans.av*) suggest a reduction of true v(pe), possibly accompanied by a reduction of true K(trans.av). The proposed method provides estimates of a scale and a shape parameter to describe contrast agent kinetics of varying complexity in a uniform way.","inCitations":["66010aff0f607d6f32b4245526ac776fc6753536","8d39488489d084d5322f3e990de5b47c367728f5","0d34b8172fabd91d34f51d8919243ed9720f75cf","93ea050c3ee12e8a456ef68828a18c39b3e04a11","1c3e6110b7632201908407b2ecf0441b81ca8df5","478da760b475cde147a2d47dd7fb92c5d06c3965","af93af18dcc97f5879c570de68d5c65f9b51fedf","300a57528ac06f9700dc9c3b941720eadfb848a4","18f391930283f67afbb0229992efa98c2e4c4e19","a408eab7855028563e7c297bed1a5e2f421df541","c6440c6a480c93ce8d9ff9216132d0ce557bd25d","780c5b2ddf9567f693b50420e0bb669bc14c2d60","1a306570ac192d34e671b82a848d469b02eec277","fcc22b498efd682d012fc1a0d86f6b84a1325d24","b79b3398be179ee09044aad53ea8cec9720bd99f","d5f0dc1454d7317ec582e37352e2c26cb68a0617","40dc05c3f51cd5c8e675513d6aa3d7ed8f5f1d15","a6b5d5b4a7acfc4c41562eee8dc4472559f442b7","467bd23b3a35f090e5173d68abbad92047b0356a","c7bd39cb9bb93d1bf565686b26cc16a548767a07"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Noncompartmental kinetic analysis of DCE-MRI data from malignant tumors: Application to glioblastoma treated with bevacizumab.","doi":"10.1002/mrm.22399","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1002/mrm.22399","venue":"Magnetic resonance in medicine"}

From January 2014 to April 2016, we repaired 60 flexor digitorum profundus tendons with a tensioned 4-strand or 6-strand core suture and three to four peripheral stitches. The A2 or A4 pulleys were vented as necessary. Following early active flexion of the repaired tendons, no repairs ruptured and 52/60 (87%) fingers recovered to good or excellent function using the Tang criteria after follow-up of 8–33 months. We conclude that tensioned multi-strand strong core repairs only require sparse peripheral stitches and are safe for early active flexion. Standard peripheral sutures are not necessary. The core sutures should be properly tensioned to prevent gapping at tendon repair site and pulleys should be sufficiently vented to allow tendon motion.

They are mainly the large drinking water infrastructure for multiple purposes that are in crisis in meeting the needs on a local basis. In such circumstances, rationalization and integration of water resources should be sought through the use of unconventional supply systems. This is the case of the Alto Ionio Cosentino (Region Calabria, Southern Italy), a territory characterized by a significant water deficit, competition between drinking and irrigation use and an inefficient water supply system in terms of satisfying demand. Through the optimization of the allocation of water resources, to overcome the problems of the territory, this paper assesses the possibility of a combined use between desalination of sea water and reuse of wastewater to meet the drinking needs and to increase irrigation requirements.","inCitations":["7a940f082ae4d0d14c804469e3d41aeab54877f4","4bfefa68fa7833d1bdeec51dedac162a904eaa80","730ff2e51cfbfc0e5f59db8140da15b416ee4ed9"],"pdfUrls":["http://wemag.ru/arhiv-zhurnal/Maiolo_M.,_Pantusa_D._COMBINED_REUSE_OF_WASTEWATER_AND_DESALINATION_FOR_THE_MANAGEMENT_OF_WATER_SYSTEMS_IN_CONDITIONS_OF_SCARCITY.pdf"],"title":"Combined Reuse of Wastewater and Desalination for the Management of Water Systems in Conditions of Scarcity","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Duration of AD and concurrent mood stabilizer use were based on coded diagnoses and pharmacy records. A Cox proportional hazards model was developed to predict time from depressive remission to next depressive relapse with continuous AD use, categorized as either >or=6 months or <6 months. Propensity scoring with greedy matching was used to help balance the observed background covariates and baseline disease severity between groups.\n\n\nRESULTS\nFive hundred eighty-nine subjects met the inclusion criteria. A Kaplan-Meer estimate found that the median depressive relapse times for the continuous (ie, >or=6 months) and early discontinuation (ie, <6 months) AD treatment groups were 16.5 and 6.8 months, respectively (P<0.05). The Cox proportional hazards model with propensity score matching identified a significantly lower risk of depressive relapse over a 2-year period among those who continued AD treatment>or=6 months after remission, compared with those who discontinued treatment within 6 months (hazard ratio, 0.61 [95% CI, 0.42-0.88]; continuous vs early discontinuation, P<0.01).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nContinuous second-generation AD therapy for >or=6 months after depressive remission was associated with a lower risk of depressive relapse over a 2-year period in patients with bipolar depression. Given concerns regarding the risk of AD users with bipolar disorder switching to mania, an optimal prophylactic treatment after depressive remission should balance the risks between manic switching and depressive relapse.","inCitations":["66e4424e01084872529a8c07b445473d6eec3da9","0d08bd6352d180cb84ad60973390aaa755ac3d0a","5951f6a39f20a7e255c02073ad0e74a02649ab54","49d62d37a20384eaa0e479e5ca3aa296dcf12f6a"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Second-generation antidepressant discontinuation and depressive relapse in adult patients with bipolar depression: results of a retrospective database analysis.","doi":"10.1016/j.clinthera.2006.06.011","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clinthera.2006.06.011","venue":"Clinical therapeutics"}

Healthy olive fruits yielded oils containing almost exclusively 1,2-isomers whereas altered olives produced oils with significant amounts of 1,3-isomers. Virgin olive oils obtained from various olive cultivars and stored at different temperatures showed triacylglycerol hydrolysis and diacylglycerol isomerization depending on the acidity and temperature. The results indicated that the relationship between acidity and total diacylglycerol content has scarce utility for detecting mild refined oil in virgin olive oil.
