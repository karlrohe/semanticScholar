Inflammatory responses and mediators are both involved in the pathogenesis of the disease and in determining its outcome. High-Mobility Group Box 1 (HMGB1) is a chromatin-associated nuclear protein acting as a signaling molecule in cells after binding to its receptors. Receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) is a transmembrane multiligand receptor that binds to HMGB1. HMGB1-RAGE signaling has an important role in inflammatory and infectious diseases. Inhibition of HMGB1 activity reduces the inflammation in immune-associated diseases. In the present study, we examined the gene expressions and plasma levels of HMGB1 and its receptor RAGE in HAM/TSP patients, HTLV-1-infected asymptomatic carriers (ACs), and healthy controls. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were collected from all the groups and complementary DNA (cDNA) was synthesized. HMGB-1 messenger RNA (mRNA) expression was quantified by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) TaqMan method, and plasma levels of HMGB1 and soluble RAGE (sRAGE) were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The mRNA expression of HMGB1 was the same among the groups (p > 0.05). No significant difference in the plasma levels of HMGB1 was observed between the groups (p > 0.05). The plasma levels of sRAGE were higher in ACs than HAM/TSP patients, and a significant difference was observed between the two groups (p < 0.001). Our results showed that sRAGE could play a potential role in the control of inflammatory response in HTLV-1 carriers through the inhibition of HMGB1 signaling and potentially could be used as an indicator for evaluation of HAM/TSP developing in HTLV-1-infected individuals.","inCitations":["013704bb5998d83870931b3601bf2d34b7ce1726"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Role of Receptors for Advanced Glycation End Products and High-Mobility Group Box 1 in the Outcome of Human T Cell Lymphotropic Type 1 Infection.","doi":"10.1089/vim.2018.0048","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1089/vim.2018.0048","venue":"Viral immunology"}

Between May 2006 and March 2008, 46 bilaterally ovariectomized Chinese women were randomized into an acupuncture and auricular acupressure group (n = 21) and a hormone replacement therapy (HRT) group (Tibolone, n = 25). Each patient was given a standard daily log and was required to record the frequency and severity of hot flashes and side effects of the treatment felt daily, from 1 week before the treatment started to the fourth week after the treatment ended. The serum levels of follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), LH and E2 were detected before and after the treatment. After the treatment and the follow-up, both the severity and frequency of hot flashes in the two groups were relieved significantly when compared with pre-treatment (P < 0.05). There was no significant difference in the severity of hot flashes between them after treatment (P > 0.05), while after the follow-up, the severity of hot flashes in the HRT group was alleviated more. After the treatment and the follow-up, the frequency of menopausal hot flashes in the HRT group was reduced more (P < 0.05). After treatment, the levels of FSH decreased significantly and the levels of E2 increased significantly in both groups (P < 0.05), and they changed more in the HRT group (P < 0.05). Acupuncture and auricular acupressure can be used as alternative treatments to relieve menopausal hot flashes for those bilaterally avariectomized women who are unable or unwilling to receive HRT.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Acupuncture and Auricular Acupressure in Relieving Menopausal Hot Flashes of Bilaterally Ovariectomized Chinese Women: A Randomized Controlled Trial","doi":"10.1016/j.dza.2009.10.029","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dza.2009.10.029","venue":""}

This approach differs from previous work in its lossless feature representation, with fragments’ bits as direct input, and its use of feedforward, recurrent, and convolutional networks as classifiers, whereas previous work has only tested feedforward networks. Due to the study’s exploratory nature, the models were not directly evaluated in a practical setting; rather, easily reproducible experiments were performed to attempt to answer the intial question of whether this approach is worthwhile to pursue further, especially due to its high computational cost. The experiments tested classification of fragments of homogeneous file types as an idealized case, rather than using a realistic set of types, because the types of interest are highly application-dependent. The recurrent networks achieved 98 percent accuracy in distinguishing 4 file types, suggesting that this approach may be capable of yielding models with sufficient performance for practical applications. The potential applications depend mainly on the model performance gains achievable by future work but include binary mapping, deep packet inspection, and file carving.","inCitations":["a32fc0a54dbc117b3388c6c61667efe1699aec54"],"pdfUrls":["https://dc.etsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1523&context=honors"],"title":"File Fragment Classification Using Neural Networks with Lossless Representations","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

ER mediates growth stimulatory effects of estrogens whereas sstr2A mediates growth inhibitory actions of somatostatin. However, much work has been devoted to elucidate the biological role of ER, little is known about sstr2A in breast cancer. In the present study we examined immunoreactivity of sstr2A and ER in 64 breast carcinomas in correlation with tumor size and histological grade (HG), presence of lymph node metastasis (LNM), Nottingham prognostic index (NPI), and the patients' age. ER and sstr2A immunoreactivity were present in 78% and 63% of the breast carcinomas, respectively. Ninety percent of tumors immunoreactive for sstr2A were simultaneously immunoreactive for ER. ER immunoreactivity correlated significantly with lower HG (p=0.03) and better NPI (p=0.02). sstr2 A immunoreactivity correlated significantly with lower HG (p=0.012) but not with NPI (p=0.26). There was no correlation of sstr2A immunoreactivity and tumor size, patients' chronological age or LNM. The results confirm prognostic value of ER immunohistochemistry in breast carcinoma. However sstr2A cannot substitute ER for prognostic evaluation, sstr2A immunoreactivity being significantly associated with lower HG seems to represent an independent prognostic factor in breast carcinoma.","inCitations":["961a26f0c63d3b58bac66e504f285d866f5c3f42","d517c06ed7d6542d9eb7fc0e5477170c624a40bd"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Clinicopathological value of somatostatin type 2A and estrogen receptor immunoreactivity in human breast carcinoma","doi":"10.1385/EP:12:1:55","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1385/EP%3A12%3A1%3A55","venue":"Endocrine pathology"}

This trait has been associated with abroad range of psychopathological conditions, starting in adolescence. In this context, prevention of its effects must start early, and the efficacyof reducing perfectionist levels in adolescents must be empirically investigated. Objective Toanalyse, for the first time, if one session to cope with perfectionism has theeffect of reducing the levels of this trait after two and six months later. Method:868 adolescents (610 girls),aged 15.73±1.571 years, from two secondary schools in Coimbra, Portugal, answered the Portuguese validated version of the Child and AdolescentPerfectionism Scale (CAPS). Two groups were formed: intervention group receivedone skill session oriented to reduce perfectionism (N=615); control group withoutintervention (N=253). Both groupsanswered CAPS again after two/T1 and six/T2 months. Results No significant differences betweengenders were found in Total CAPS, Self Oriented Perfectionism/SOP and SelfPrescribed Perfectionism/SPP.

In a traditional, optical AFM, the sample rests on a bulk piezoelectric tube and a control loop is used to control the tip-sample separation by actuating the piezo-tube. This method has several disadvantages--the most noticeable one being that response time of the piezo-tube is rather long which leads to slow imaging speeds. One possible solution aimed at improving the speed of imaging is to incorporate a thin piezoelectric film on top of the cantilever beam. This design not only improves the speed of imaging because the piezoelectric film replaces the piezo-tube as an actuator, but the film can also act as a sensor. In addition, the piezoelectric film can excite the cantilever beam near its resonance frequency. This project aims to fabricate piezoelectric microcantilevers for use in the AFM. Prior to fabricating the cantilevers and also part of this project, a systematic study was performed to examine the effects of deposition conditions on the quality of piezoelectric ZnO thin films deposited by RF sputtering. These results will be presented. The deposition parameters thatmore » produced the highest quality ZnO film were used in the fabrication of the piezoelectric cantilevers. Unfortunately, the fabricated cantilevers warped due to the intrinsic stress of the ZnO film and were therefore not usable in the AFM. The complete fabrication process will be detailed, the results will be discussed and reasons for the warping will be examined.« less","inCitations":["a2b098b9811e52e46da3ab8f057d92c684865009","5acff65fd55b4de04dec1097cd750569e7f0cf65","ee05c0ff62c6c88d220c50352e96f9b2e3768670","753f3515b2100a16139747d05eccbdd4c2d2f039","4db7b605869d20c4c2a82b43ded46838ea8d3f4d","917fc91487d725a94074207648f713555e52f0b4","98443c46f342e1b245e1f01482565bb739ac0637","3b214ed96c523a266d34d36eba072ba0b7bb3768","c85709da72409a7dfd3e4b7968cf663de6a6089a","4a2ac082fd8d50297ca9a6202b57f8c3f992e333","5edf666a510bfaa6d165a5038a0234b4fbaf0b71","4dc515e372a4d6b439d67548c25f6a20666b4b2c","057503a7beb1a90adf6e4a2daf42382f935f13bd"],"pdfUrls":["https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc786953/m2/1/high_res_d/850081.pdf"],"title":"Characterization of piesoelectric ZnO thin films and the fabrication of piezoelectric micro-cantilevers","doi":"10.2172/850081","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.2172/850081","venue":""}

The results indicate that AlPO-5 zeolite has a good capacity to resist steam and FeAlPO-5 has high population of isolated Fe(III) and oligonuclear Fe(III)xOy which lead to a better low-temperature and more stable activity than Fe/AlPO-5. Deactivation of Fe/AlPO-5 is ascribed to the agglomeration of Fe2O3 particles under steam condition. Combining the activity and characterization results, we deduce that isolated Fe(III) and oligonuclear Fe(III)xOy are highly active and responsible for catalytic reduction of N2O with methane at low temperature (below 500 ◦C). In contrast, Fe2O3 nanoparticles need high temperature (above 500 ◦C) to activate both catalytic reduction of N2O with methane and methane combustion. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Such response heterogeneity can result in misleading or false-negative experimental results because the signal produced by a minor subset of cells in a population can be difficult to detect with assays that analyze the average response of the whole population. This report describes a technique that enables the investigator (i) to identify whether a subset of a population mobilizes Ca 2+ in response to a stimulus and (ii) to select and subclone cells from the responsive subset. The subcloning procedure can be performed in a manner that either controls for or disregards the kinetics of the response. The resultant subclones exhibit improved response homogeneity detected at the single cell level which is also manifested as an increased signal-to-noise ratio when the average response of the entire subclone population is studied. This technique presents an opportunity to manipulate the existing response heterogeneity toward the experimental requirements of the investigator. Results obtained with two neuronal cell lines are illustrated and other potential applications of the response-dependent subcloning procedure are discussed.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Isolation of subclones with enhanced Ca2+ response homogeneity by flow cytometric selection of single cells during a ligand-activated Ca2+ response","doi":"10.1016/S1046-2023(05)80065-9","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/S1046-2023%2805%2980065-9","venue":""}

Una de estas facultades es la autorret1exion, que le permite al hombre pensar en tomo a si mismo como individuo y como colectividad. Otra es el uso de un idioma de palabras enunciadas y signos escritos que efectua la comunicacion de una mente humana a otra y que trasciende el tiempo, liberando al hombre de vivir unicamente el presente. Solo el ser humano ha podido desarrollar el pensamiento sim­ bolico y la imaginacion, y para enriquecer todas estas facultades, el recuerdo, que hace posible ret1exionar sobre el pasado en funcion del futuro l. El que se dedica a la ret1exion y autorret1exion por excelencia es el filosofo, mientras que el poeta -en el sentido de artista literario- se dedica a llevar el len­ guaje enunciado y consignado al papel a sus maximas posibilidades. Cada uno cultiva, como especialidad, una de las facultades nobles y exclusivas de la mente humana. Para el filosofo la palabra escrita es un vehiculo empleado primordialmente para transmitir sus ideas y esta supeditada a estas. Para el poeta la expresion es un fin digno y valioso en si, que no tiene obligacion de servir a las ideas. Para el poeta-filosofo o filosofo-poeta, en cambio, el arte es el vaso comunicante sin el cual las preocupacio­ nes filosoficas no serian mas que elucubraciones aridas. Rafael Dieste y Tomas Barros fueron escritores de orientacion filosofica y al mismo tiempo filosofos de marcada vocacion literaria. Sus obras muestran intereses filosoficos divergentes: Dieste indaga principalmente en los misterios del conocimien­ to, la experiencia, la infinitud, el origen y destino, y hace referencias a Kant, Hume, Hegel, Nietzsche y Zenon de Elea. Barros muestra predileccion por la filosofia social, etica y aun llUstica, con decidida int1uencia oriental. Se refiere a los mas diversos pen­ sadores occidentales y orientales, entre ellos Kafka, Ionesco, Bergson, Freud, Jung, Malraux y Pantajali. Pero lo que mas llama la atencion en estos dos poetas y filoso­ fos, distintos en muchos respectos, es que tanto el uno como el otro emplearon la lite­ ratura como metodo filosofico.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Imágenes e imaginaciones filosóficas en Rafael Dieste y Tomás Barros","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Improper use of the sample data (model training and testing data) may cause overfitting and underfitting effects in the model. The goal of this study is to develop an optimal sampling data usage strategy for any dataset and identify an appropriate number of rules in the regression tree model that will improve its accuracy and robustness. Landsat 8 data and Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer-scaled Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) were used to develop regression tree models. A Python procedure was designed to generate random replications of model parameter options across a range of model development data sizes and rule number constraints. The mean absolute difference (MAD) between the predicted and actual NDVI (scaled NDVI, value from 0–200) and its variability across the different randomized replications were calculated to assess the accuracy and stability of the models. In our case study, a six-rule regression tree model developed from 80% of the sample data had the lowest MAD (MADtraining = 2.5 and MADtesting = 2.4), which was suggested as the optimal model. This study demonstrates how the training data and rule number selections impact model accuracy and provides important guidance for future remote-sensing-based ecosystem modeling.","inCitations":["c8322dfcbaec72defa08ed8bed89dfa32a0446eb","333a781557016fd6222690d67907911ef8a5482f","b8a085da94438e9b018d0f43a6f22dc00ea24a22","b45bbe4b4e4fc131dbf5ce81f9c85bb1e998655a","e8a68538ad990f7b8c2c68492daa382d987a4df2","9c72f308d36155f8fbd2a7b773d4af94d18b63b7","2bff39d9016f00444fc395c9f03d3627f98639a2","c3c01d964cd6e1c55a35ba9452f581e5c4283152","255a83f54869bfebbfe432b2ea848f97f85306f5","d8556837b3a96f0afa19b0913ee5bd5d03b03a26"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/8/11/943/pdf","https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q57410459"],"title":"An Optimal Sample Data Usage Strategy to Minimize Overfitting and Underfitting Effects in Regression Tree Models Based on Remotely-Sensed Data","doi":"10.3390/rs8110943","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.3390/rs8110943","venue":"Remote Sensing"}

The multimode interference in the SMS structure is effectively affected by the external perturbation due to the microgroove, which goes deep into the core of the multimode fiber (MMF). Experimental results show that this femtosecond-induced spiral micro-structured SMS (FISM-SMS) fiber structure exhibits a linear response to eternal liquid refractive index in a large RI range of 1.3373-1.4345. The maximum sensitivity of the structure can reach to 2144 nm/RIU and can be further improved by increasing the depth of the spiral micro-grooves.","inCitations":["c47c7e202cb76349f0a4db6360551005658851f9","6d5d09f67f8298fe0efb1f4e7722040f27c508ed","0f0bfe8403259108bd17d27afb1cddfd2a113a13"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Femtosecond-induced spiral micro-structured SMS fiber structure for refractive index measurement.","doi":"10.1364/OE.26.017388","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1364/OE.26.017388","venue":"Optics express"}

This research was initiated to optimize the efficient application of the NTP process in benzene, toluene, ethyl-benzene, and xylene (BTEX) removal. The effects of four variables including temperature, initial BTEX concentration, voltage, and flow rate on the BTEX elimination efficiency were investigated using response surface methodology (RSM). The constructed model was evaluated by analysis of variance (ANOVA). The model goodness-of-fit and statistical significance was assessed using determination coefficients (R2 and R2adj) and the F-test. The results revealed that the R2 proportion was greater than 0.96 for BTEX removal efficiency. The statistical analysis demonstrated that the BTEX removal efficiency was significantly correlated with the temperature, BTEX concentration, voltage, and flow rate. Voltage was the most influential variable affecting the dependent variable as it exerted a significant effect (p < 0.0001) on the response variable. According to the achieved results, NTP can be applied as a progressive, cost-effective, and practical process for treatment of airstreams polluted with BTEX in conditions of low residence time and high concentrations of pollutants.","inCitations":["11ce9ac1e320cf7100de98717f56b0dd7842b183"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Optimization of non-thermal plasma efficiency in the simultaneous elimination of benzene, toluene, ethyl-benzene, and xylene from polluted airstreams using response surface methodology","doi":"10.1007/s11356-017-0373-8","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11356-017-0373-8","venue":"Environmental Science and Pollution Research"}

Immunoglobuline synthesis by peripheral blood lymphocytes cultured with pokeweed mitogen and D-pen was significantly increased at D-pen concentrations of 10-100 micrograms/ml in 2 patients with D-pen associated myasthenia gravis and 1 out of 3 normal individuals. Furthermore, lymphocytes from 1 myasthenic patient synthesized detectable AChR antibodies in vitro, and the amount of receptor antibody produced was increased in the presence of the drug. This effect was most marked at a concentration of 10 micrograms/ml which is thought to approximate the concentration in vivo.

Previously published findings of CHD risk factors in HIV-infected persons have been derived from facility-based cohort studies, which have limited representativeness for the HIV-infected population. State-specific, population-based surveillance data can assist health care providers and public health agencies in planning and evaluating programs that reduce CHD among HIV-infected persons. We describe CHD risk factors from the 2007-2008 Oregon Medical Monitoring Project, a population-based survey of HIV-infected persons receiving care that included both patient interview and medical record review. Among the 539 HIV-infected patients interviewed, the mean age was 45.5 years. Diagnoses from the medical record associated with CHD risk included preexisting CHD (5%), diabetes (11%), and hypertension (28%). Current smoking was reported by 46%; college graduates were less likely to smoke compared with those with lesser education (21% versus 53%, respectively; P <.0001). Obesity was present among 17%. Among the 65% of the survey group with lipid values available, 55% had high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL) <40 mg/dL and 42% had triglycerides ≥ 200 mg/dL. Among the 15% of the survey group with either preexisting CHD or diabetes, 42% had a non-HDL <130 mg/dL (target goal) and 38% smoked. Risk factors for CHD among HIVinfected persons, particularly smoking and dyslipidemia, should be managed aggressively. Ongoing surveillance is warranted to monitor changes in CHD risk factors in the HIV-infected population.","inCitations":["f5b11ce17a2e790a2a110f40d4806ce2e08bf46a","ef5801a2e0feab6bf36a7269e8b0726d6cc8d2c7","7e4973e84b031ac829897d45368950011553436c","86576f3c06fb14b889bd65288aec32fdee419941","46ddf06b19257e63de2bea3c2bacf1e89eb6109c","72a41410b0baa4aca067cace16f4f49c48865084","5643d8dc84dadb738b042cd420dd5a1abde3c1b6","c0b402768cad8d212037cdf2ff811556741b2859","d4642a35bf3d0d834713db811d3dcd374cf9dd1d"],"pdfUrls":["http://benthamopen.com/contents/pdf/TOAIDJ/TOAIDJ-6-177.pdf","http://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/pmc/e6/51/TOAIDJ-6-177.PMC3462329.pdf","https://benthamopen.com/contents/pdf/TOAIDJ/TOAIDJ-6-177.pdf"],"title":"Population-Based Study of Risk Factors for Coronary Heart Disease Among HIV-Infected Persons","doi":"10.2174/1874613601206010177","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.2174/1874613601206010177","venue":"The open AIDS journal"}

Descriptive analysis of the correspondence between the demographics of organizations' supporter networks and their issue agendas revealed that groups consistently over-represent class-based issues and under-represent gender-based issues relative to the proportions of low-income and female individuals contained within their constituencies.","inCitations":["05b4c8f7cce74d906f420d5c0a1e265f491bff41","4d6154a8ae80290b85c5cf6efd903f337fe8d498","49bc669585dd134dee76899fdcd185e23dc01677","57d353f1a10e1225c6a16ca11d5bc0ce6d0d2488","3bfe732859c37760139319f4e0fe1198a4b447dc"],"pdfUrls":["https://www.kathleenmarchetti.com/uploads/9/4/4/8/9448989/marchetti_pgi.pdf"],"title":"Crossing the intersection: the representation of disadvantaged identities in advocacy","doi":"10.1080/21565503.2013.876919","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1080/21565503.2013.876919","venue":""}

Three of these strains were selected for further study based on their ability to be cultured and produce secondary metabolites under laboratory conditions. The culture filtrate of each was extracted and analyzed by LC-MS and LC-NMR, and the major metabolites were isolated and characterized. Structures were elucidated by spectroscopic analyses including 2D NMR and HRMS and by comparison to literature data. In some cases the extract was methylated in order to facilitate separation, but the original natural structure was determined by comparing the NMR data of the isolated methylated product with that of the stop-flow NMR of the underivatized extract (i.e., 2a, 2b, and 4). Two of these metabolites, 1 and 2a, are new structures, 3 and 4 are reported here for the first time as fungal metabolites, and 5- 10 as known fungal metabolites from other species. Tyrosol (10) was the only common metabolite found in all three extracts but did not account for the observed toxicity to C. fumiferana.","inCitations":["98b4c877e635ffe4c89b3391af60a5c9c60d6e8f","1f8303979bc5b89213d5313aa1aafcd5e4c9c664","62340d168469efad154ae612ff260289f6f067ad","0612d0cdd253b555f7004679316fd14b2b4d6f7e","21c07c14fd77138615e8b2286c6570afbfa26c79","ae5cec2c6016b7600dc9d57ddc88596a2bf27edf","fd062e6d515a23658d062a5e0b34a0c6481db490","45018cd72cf9d462a67e4c6ad07c25b4e0af752c","44cb99069932444673a1b1d1da799e2fcb5c055d","4bac1930f2967f77ce21de40cc74b28271104090","e25074c706537de9a2b772f6352d3ef7c4e774ee","3242715825c473e4192df52c42ae357ededf9dc4","c6a79578848f229a1c73001ff8c349b0882d37a6","8ef143621cddcb9cd1303ac2b794c0934eb60c22","07cda1e6db6416bf3d1119230d833370b3f5cb3a","be24d328a742d2816a86b0b7a94bc8494f394800","4bd4000fd4f814df82691aa2cce76d9edfe49994","f8dcda49c7bf6f0eb8ed601aee9bf8d265cf01bc","2971f1ac3773c93519b735c95507c8e21f13831c","73e4935133857b5c2c3518de3d87a1e04f375adf"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Characterization of polyketide metabolites from foliar endophytes of Picea glauca.","doi":"10.1021/np800192f","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1021/np800192f","venue":"Journal of natural products"}

In the case of Spain, centres in Almeria, Barcelona, Bilbao, Cadiz, Cartagena, Castellon, Valladolid and Valencia are collaborating in the study. The aim of the study is to obtain knowledge of the prevalence and seriousness of asthma amongst children living in different cities so as to compare the results between different Spanish cities and with other countries. This will make it possible to elaborate hypotheses on the aetiology of asthma. The ISAAC protocol studies two groups: children of 6 to 7 years of age, and adolescents of 13 to 14 years. The parents of the children of 6 to 7 years were sent questionnaires on asthma, atopic dermatitis, rhinitis and conjunctivitis, while the children in the 13 to 14 year old age group received the same written questionnaire together with a video questionnaire. A minimum of 3,000 children have been studied in each centre and age group. The information obtained from the ISAAC study, besides facilitating the study of the aetiology of asthma, will provide a baseline measure for studying the world evolution of the illness.","inCitations":["99d57faac59a3c80121b32f7eb8a683f600f6691"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"[Aims and methods of the ISAAC study (International Study of Asthma and Allergy in Childhood)].","doi":"10.23938/ASSN.0598","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.23938/ASSN.0598","venue":"Anales del sistema sanitario de Navarra"}

Our objective was to develop and validate an algorithm for rapid rule-out and rule-in of AMI.\n\nMethods: A prospective multicenter study enrolling 1469 unselected patients with acute chest pain presenting to the emergency department. CTnI was measured by Siemens Centaur cTnI Ultra in a blinded fashion at presentation and after 1 hour. The final diagnosis was adjudicated by 2 independent cardiologists. A cTnI-Ultra algorithm incorporating baseline values as well as absolute changes within the first hour was derived from all patients. The primary prognostic end point was death during 30 days of follow-up.\n\nResults: AMI was the final diagnosis in 19% of patients. According to the rule-in and rule-out algorithm (figure 1), 648 patients (44%) could be classified as \"rule-out\", 229 patients (16%) as \"rule-in\", and 592 patients (40%) as in the \"observational zone\" within 1 hour. Overall, this resulted in a sensitivity and negative predictive value of 98% and 99% for rule-out, a specificity and positive predictive value of 97% and 84%, respectively, for rule-in, and a prevalence of AMI of 17% in the observational zone group. Cumulative 30-day survival was 99.7%, 99.0%, and 95.2% (P<.001) in patients classified as ruleout, observational zone, and rule-in, respectively.\n\n![Figure][1] \n\n\n\nConclusions: Using a simple algorithm incorporating cTnI-Ultra baseline values and absolute changes within the first hour allowed a safe rule-out and an accurate rule-in of AMI within 1 hour in 60% of unselected patients with acute chest pain. This novel strategy may obviate the need for prolonged monitoring and serial blood sampling in 3 of 5 patients.\n\n [1]: pending:yes","inCitations":["37b38e6c32e5e9e659b55eea37100093c0cc9495"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"One-hour rule-out and rule-in of acute myocardial infarction using siemens sensitive cardiac Troponin I ultra","doi":"10.1093/eurheartj/eht307.P434","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1093/eurheartj%2Feht307.P434","venue":""}

Extending a conceptual framework developed by Fine (1996), we argue that occupational identity is not a consistent whole, but constructed from imagery to interpret and manage situations commonly experienced by occupational members. We argue that consultants, as an occupation, face three key structural constraints as features of their work, which we term, legitimacy, efficiency and vulnerability. On the basis of our interview data, we identify five social roles around which occupational `rhetorics' are constructed — professional, prophet, partner, business person, and service worker. We explore how consultants use these rhetorics to respond to issues of legitimacy, efficiency and vulnerability, and also highlight how different imagery is used based on its situational salience.","inCitations":["6f696cd52fd5e9dec5eaf7d8c50a78836812dc5f","c41ee43452b20d5cb486fc74ae35d27cb2605513","412439a8e15386c6429a8eac650d7e19a0494268","3e6e08d362bfab5ca26d14961a39fa9407ce2239","d5f75d9709ec8f3055b43f3c8e0e90697e44d5b7","3499ff73e1af9f07e339a9c94624f98f375f3461","e611ffb83e8d954164a2fb91a4d77e43348cde20","363da9ee5be8726d600f2b9239f96ac7e00e7c8c","d30a4ac45dfa4571d8076058e9913768083cb9dc","842789b5bc7666d842a2ad56fb367da055c59973","0bb6160206acdcb1be6f58b4d88acfc353b373c4","8850d47513468e3d003a8b36bd8b56f92102e0a8","48a750b3c58de6b38141921736ce7c2822be3783","b2d74f5cf198819f65e8b8f760521bf44e0bc393","86b7e6b66f862825bbcab1ac9fbc2bcd388251f9","876e7af919a949faf0a15a6e6b79d72d4064a0d9","532c6ee6b375e124a6eb2f8360344d8dcab2fa83","bfc4bb5875af76d332610dcc7f445ec64b255e8f","9093a26f9c2f48de90021f04ead076b79da28b53","5ff623df8f254c04f75b8897aa1606712b62aad1","7a686cf20e5cbe2d910ab9b210d0c9a35d96abba","693393e91b671cdac656f5dd8db15900b7f249f0","6a098b6abf1aef3d406a93f487a7295351b02b0e","f7d4c65dff4f7aae79f492b9e305f03b808ea894","0c03186874b188cfa24d967843d3416229f61c23","d25def71b2e8131d8b161924cf3ed9d82c98b1ee","3474f2d1126eca4c1e73da38cec774d8452a6ec4","b100f0e82191886e5b404a1f51da14849cae3857","a793c7ea21b72a61d2a5c9617f5d799a014b8b5c","5bbe269a3cb4a69f79cc9230cc570bdadf2f621f","e3facf4fa79f29e0cc200c06755aa836a55e44b1","01baad53e3db2d8217637877a39d8eaf4518c1dc","53045d5f8068e71d26ed0afc416f2b26ba6d02f4","70062bb99e0f63e82445927e096367219c684780"],"pdfUrls":["https://climatepeopleorg.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/hr0702.pdf"],"title":"From prophets to profits: The occupational rhetoric of management consultants","doi":"10.1177/0018726707084302","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1177/0018726707084302","venue":""}

Sekolah atau Lembaga Pendidikan yang menyandang atribut \"Kristen\", seharusnya perlu menggali pengertian tentang hal pendidikan dari dalam Alkitab, baik kitab-kitab Perjanjian Lama maupun kitab-kitab Perjanjian Baru. Kitab-kitab Perjanjian Lama menggunakan kata Ibrani \"lamad\" atau \"dida,sku\" (Gerika, terjemahan Septuaginta), untuk menterjemahkan kata \"rnengajar\", kira-kira sebanyak seratus kali. Penggunaan kata ini mencerminkan bahwa hal mengajar berpusat pada hal \"bagaimana hidup harus dihidupi\" sesuai kehendak TUHAN (Ulangan ll:l9; 20:18), bukan terutama mengkomunikasikan pengetahuan dan ketrampilan. Dan pendidikan di jaman itu, difokuskan pada hal mempelajari tentang Allah. Ayat pembuka dari Alkitab kita, Kejadian 1:1, mencerminkan dengan jelas hal itu. Hal tentang Allah dan kehendakNya, dinyatakan lewat para hamba yang diurapiNya, adalah hal yang mutlak, kebenaran mutlak - beberapa hal; tersebut yang difirmankan Allah dapat dibaca dalam kitab-kitab Pentateukh (lima kitab awal dari Alkitab). Di jaman Perjanjian Baru, pendidikan tetap berpusat Allah, yaitu pada diri Allah yang menjadi manusia: Yesus Kristus. Keteladanan hidup, otoritasNya menjadikan banyak orang menyebut diriNya sebagai Guru. Dia mendidik secara khusus muridNya, dengan cara mengikuti Dia setiap hari. Para muridNya, bahkan kepada banyak orang, diajarkanNya tentang hal \"bagaimana hidup ini harus dihidupi\" - yaitu menjadi seperti Dia, memiliki hidup yang berkualitas seperti Dia. Dari pernyataan Alkitab, kita mengetahui bahwa Alkitab menekankan tentang pendidikan dalam hal nilai-nilai bagi kepentingan hidup dan pengembangan kualitas diri peserta didiknya, bukan hanya pengembangan dan perolehan ilmu pengetahuan, ketrampilan dan profesionalitas kerja.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Nilai-Nilai Kristian (Usulan Prioritas dan Klarifikasi)","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

The piezoelectric strip is excited by an electrical signal and the acoustic field is generated. The piezoelectric strip is of type 6 mm crystal system oriented along its length direction. The SH wave is studied for the structure of this piezoelectric transducer. At first, the field is expanded as a Fourier series in the piezoelectric strip and as a Fourier integral in the half space. Then, the response of the solution inside the piezoelectric strip and in the half space is obtained by the boundary conditions. The acoustic field distribution is analyzed and compared to that obtained by the traditional method. Finally, the acoustic radiation field at the far field is investigated by the saddle point method and the directional factor is analyzed. It is found that the traditional method is valid only in the case where the product of the frequency with the width of the piezoelectric strip is less than 1 kHz · m. The stress and displacement in the piezoelectric strip are oscillatory distributions when the frequency increases. The greater the frequency, the greater the difference between the traditional method and the present method.","inCitations":["8dbe00a7ae57be0741389c97b5141be07c2bb1e9"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Study of SH acoustic radiation field excited by a piezoelectric strip","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}
