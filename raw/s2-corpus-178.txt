The most frequent union was first cousins (47.2%). Consanguinity was considered possible in other 16 (8%) couples. Concerning the diagnosis of multiple cases, the most frequent conditions were hyperphenylalaninemias, mucopolysaccharidosis type I, GM1 gangliosidosis, and glycogen storage disease type I. No disease cluster could be related temporally and in proximity in this work. A higher consanguinity rate was found between parents born in Bahia (33.3%), followed by Pernambuco (27.2%), Minas Gerais (19.7%), and Parana (14.8%).","inCitations":["5d20d61dd99c5e0f79ebcbfb16e79de4c25150e6"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Consanguinity and Geographic Origin of Patients With Autosomal Recessive Metabolic Disorders Evaluated in a Reference Service in Campinas, Brazil","doi":"10.1177/2326409814568564","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1177/2326409814568564","venue":""}

The purpose of this paper is to present new methodologies to measure and predict human boredom at work.Design/methodology/approach – Two series of mathematical formulations, linear and nonlinear, to describe the variation of human boredom at work are first presented. Given the complexity of human emotions, the authors also present a probabilistic framework based on state‐of‐the‐art Bayesian networks to model employees' boredom at work.Findings – The proposed methods centre on the prediction and measurement of human boredom at work.

The authors envision an alternative conflict-resolution platform using a different approach, one that was used in an earlier investigation into uncertainty in water quality research. The platform employs Monte Carlo simulation parameterizing water resources operations, randomly selecting parameter combinations, and inputting these as forcing functions to a core water resources operation model. The core model uses constraints determined and quantified by stakeholders, and simulation results can be evaluated by these constraints (visualized as corridors for a simulated quantity to pass through). If a certain parameter combination provides satisfactory simulation results, then the operational policy it represents constitutes a potential solution for the conflict. Iterative model application enables continuous refinement of constraints, parameters and operation rules, until a potential solution is found. The computation results can also be analyzed for the sensitivities of the system to changes in parameters (operations), and thus key operations can be identified.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://smartech.gatech.edu/bitstream/handle/1853/47118/ZengWMcMahonGHawkinsD-GWRCpaper%20revised.pdf?isAllowed=y&sequence=1"],"title":"Modeling for conflict resolution using parameterization of operations and strong stakeholder initiatives","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Special attention has been paid to local magnification artefacts, which are often suspected to strongly disrupt the precipitates' apparent composition. The charge state of Al ions has been used to identify the nature of precipitates (lower or higher evaporation field than the matrix) and also to determine the origin of Al ions observed in 3D reconstructions. The use of a cluster identification method, which allows erosion concentration profiles to be drawn, has revealed the importance of trajectory overlaps in the measurement of the precipitates' composition. By applying this method to low-evaporation-field precipitates in a 7XXX alloy, good agreement was found between atom probe measurements and observations in transmission electron microscopy and small angles X-ray scattering.

Methods: The studies were retrieved from PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, ChinaInfo and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) databases from the inception to June 20, 2014. Thereafter, the eligible studies were selected based on the predefined criteria, and the literature quality was assessed. The meta-analysis was conducted using Review Manager 5.2 software. The pooled effect size was relative risk (RR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI). Results: A total of 8 studies containing 480 cases were included, among which 264 were assigned to the ATRA + ATO group and the other 216 to the ATRA group. The meta-analysis showed that ATRA + ATO combination therapy significantly improved the complete remission (CR) rate (RR = 1.09, 95% CI = 1.03-1.16, p = 0.004), decreased the early mortality rate (RR = 0.42, 95% CI = 0.20-0.9, p = 0.03) and relapse rate (RR = 0.17, 95% CI = 0.07-0.42, p < 0.0001), but increased the high risk of liver dysfunction (RR = 2.43, 95% CI = 1.72-3.41, p < 0.00001), comparing with ATRA monotherapy. Conclusions: The ATRA + ATO combination therapy may be more effective for newly diagnosed APL with a higher CR rate but lower early mortality rate and relapse rate. However, the risks of liver damage should be of concern.","inCitations":["59083552d5d0f7628ded2f08fdddae6a6cbe974a","7e20b06d787172221d5351f16d9bd26f31d2f482","2a265acfea02ed3acce6ea104c8a0b56101e2002","d2ace5b3633494d64ef229e9faaa72bf659a853b","7bd5e7015216d09571417d87c5fce4d5446d5001","e76e9ec4e7be95226c3c7dfa825b39a22fa0375c","d4a5119dacbabdec3f035015352256b7d163e22a","26e154bd86a0a6ffab48e4550c48bd206ced165c","dadaf6f64a911236aff45ce0e887ac12becb7770","c229d1d6d80e1432311fdf4d7703431e6ae98d92","cca7012b95b8562381a4d960120bf2ee3b386597"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Insights into the All-trans-Retinoic Acid and Arsenic Trioxide Combination Treatment for Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia: A Meta-Analysis","doi":"10.1159/000369242","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1159/000369242","venue":"Acta Haematologica"}

By local infusions of antibiotics, such as cefazolin a considerably higher local concentration can be achieved if the local blood flow is impaired, e.g. by arterial disease. By local infusions of streptokinase an increased local fibrinolysis was observed only when the arterial circulation was considerably reduced. Local intraarterial continuously infusions of pharmacologic agents are especially recommended for patients with arterial disease.","inCitations":["41c937ace5f06d5f098d56f71104926144a3a35a"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"[Intra-arterial infusion.

After preliminary testing, participants attended the laboratory four times, each time consuming a 1.12 MJ meal (60 g carbohydrate, 2 g fat, 2 g protein), with randomized amounts of their rapid-acting insulin: Full dose (mean 7.3±0.2 units), 75% dose (mean 5.4±0.1 units), 50% dose (mean 3.7±0.1 units) or 25% dose (mean 1.8±0.1 units). After 2-h rest, participants completed 45 min running at 70±1% peak rate of oxygen consumption (VO(2peak) ). Blood metabolites and hormones were recorded over the 2-h rest and 3-h recovery. Data were analysed using repeated-measures ANOVA.\n\n\nRESULTS\n  Serum insulin peaked at 60 min in all conditions and was lowest after 25% insulin dose compared with full dose (P=0.03). After the 25% insulin dose immediately pre-exercise glucose concentration was higher than after the full or 50% dose (P<0.05). Resting beta-hydroxybutyrate gradually decreased during 2-h rest (P<0.05) with a similar post-exercise peak of beta-hydroxybutyrate at 3 h (P>0.05). Post-exercise blood pH increased for 5 min to a similar extent with all insulin doses , but the rise with the 25% dose was less compared with the full dose (P=0.01). Blood lactate and plasma catecholamines increased after running similarly with all insulin reduction conditions (P<0.05). Blood glucose area under the curve (BG(auc) ) after the 25% insulin dose was greater than after the 75% dose (P=0.02).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nKetogenesis following running was not influenced by reductions in pre-exercise rapid-acting insulin dose. This important preparatory strategy aids preservation of blood glucose but poses no greater risk to exercise-induced ketone body formation.","inCitations":["4b4fc71d34fb7378c2eed7898b32dbca028c7207","0752b4f670f77ac571cd33e351cf7338adb0d100","073af678a87d01eb4b55b6da6b42c05187597fe6","1303a464c0ef8827458770145dfdb8ae099b65e4","8f9ded2e873637368c111966aee90414e42c4167","db855eab386f107eac188ef7f444ae18f3a3224f","96064055794b883d7b15e776860eb50fc9efc776","dc42119076f914a042667e4842f1adaa2eb789e8","2f8e6236ba6a2d623185104784faac3aab4ff0cd","89c12ab88ac8794ab6cf9d6ee5457dc58034d8c5","2b68e87389b246d158c400f1fdcc87eb8742f0e6","8c32d64729e76858381ca29af1ed7799cc94dc20","3a149c62560a8c1f92f4ac7a81ce6acb8ce6f597","c418069308fb4fea6d74a3a636d58c4785f6ea4d","d3c5a7c59724c64e8c37ce1fe1326ea326fc20f6","efbf987028ca2bf309bb808451941a680b791a82"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Impact of pre-exercise rapid-acting insulin reductions on ketogenesis following running in Type 1 diabetes.","doi":"10.1111/j.1464-5491.2010.03162.x","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1464-5491.2010.03162.x","venue":"Diabetic medicine : a journal of the British Diabetic Association"}

The two precursors were tested against basal adenylate cyclase activity and that stimulated by histamine (10−4M), by PGE2(10−4M), by 5′-guanylylimidodiphosphate [Gpp(NH)p] (10−4M) and by NaF(10−2M). PGH2 analog (10−4M) and arachidonic acid (10−4M) both inhibited to a similar extent adenylate cyclase stimulated by histamine or by NaF, but not that stimulated by PGE2 or by Gpp(NH)p. Neither agent significantly affected basal adenylate cyclase levels. In the presence of indomethacin (10−4M), basal adenylate cyclase activity remained unchanged but the inhibitory effect of arachidonic acid was almost entirely abolished, suggesting that such inhibitory effect may be caused by prostaglandin endoperoxides generated from arachidonic acid in the course of assay. Moreover, indomethacin did not attenuate PGH2 inhibition of histamine action. Unlike arachidonic acid, which is a natural metabolic precursor of PGE2, arachidic acid did not significantly influence histamine-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity. These results suggest that the prostaglandin endoperoxides may have an inhibitory effect on histamine-sensitive ciclic AMP generation in gastric mucosa.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Inhibition of histamine-sensitive adenylate cyclase from guinea pig fundic gastric mucosa by arachidonic acid and by an analog of prostaglandin endoperoxide PGH2","doi":"10.1007/BF01308517","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/BF01308517","venue":"Digestive Diseases and Sciences"}

One significant development has been the interlocking compression nail (ICN) which provides active interfragmentary compression. Apart from its beneficial effect in the treatment of acute fractures, allowing early weight-bearing and mobilization of the patient the ICN is useful in many types of revision operations: resection and stabilization of pseudarthroses without cancellous bone grafts, corrective operations of malalignments through a minimally invasive technique, as well as the readaptation of the resection sites in arthrodeses. Between April 1993 and September 1996, 402 consecutive applications of an ICN were followed prospectively to evaluate the practibility and reliability of the system. A special focus was placed on the active compression device. Along with 153 acute fractures, 112 non-unions and 41 cases of malalignment were treated; 96 arthrodeses were performed. Even for difficult courses of healing only a low complication rate was observed, and a remarkably high percentage was managed successfully.","inCitations":["3b194a9e041cb90415e0e1777bcce75fe3dd2a35","babd477e8ee5cd45d6d0fffc14450366332f0c31","9981bf03c31a9bc8694dcf8634c55dae6bb06d2e","f685ff3f53242c82a9ffd50e8064e7e5f904c9ce","7a38d69b47080ef60706f24c1fab4165bc4c6725","677c570cb10eb8a0e0622d50c4beb5bbb9e54858","c0eacd67370f8c790ac756940f8d21b25b95618f","1c6518daa02d9c515d31afae0e1bd2b1fe5d9474","7eefb091ac41965c5ba2a9a5386afff9800bbce6","8bfa1d676a34bbdf8a845c7dc00ecddbd582ccc6","9427863c1c066afad99788a2f51e5a323e1d0b77","bc6ed15dd56beddab5362bf54d568344daa94e95","451037a55c2a022b2a4f7a32c04a4020c86d189f","a67aa06390aabe68811c6e74ec080d8ee007a726","e7cfc6ba372f73d5456e999181a85f02915c6024","40dc9cddfd6a2b315c13bb5317966ec6dba0575e","c87c681f223b96bbde8c98bd78901dfadd29b4f5","1e244b489239ba4bbff4b391f59765cff4a02be5","601947baa0ac4b16a1bbddf502f3ad68cf5f7f06","054b5193f4ac038dbf257d730c45042371938cef","5f26a3f9657566abbec7ab0c168fdf6b98a55490","3fbf608b586bbd1893d89831e9d87654ddaed85c","68520206d78c199e2938a7050309b1deb416e873","039cdf2fb5a8e352f4280b77e26947c799ea40a2","884f0f05968f09db784ac51841b88df702932b66","b5532a3c18fed7c92a588e8093bd6dc2806bd971","d66bb6ca6b803d9055d7c39a44c5e9ee8d8bfca0","a778c6334a438007d19ea417eab9cebf5cc376d2"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Interlocking compression nailing: a report on 402 applications","doi":"10.1007/s004020050287","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s004020050287","venue":"Archives of Orthopaedic and Trauma Surgery"}

In another function, we recently showed that cationic liposomes bound to the mast cell surface suppress the degranulation induced by the cross-linking of high-affinity IgE receptor in a time- and dose-dependent manner. This suppression is mediated by the impairment of the sustained level of intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+ ]i ) via the inhibition of store-operated Ca2+ entry. Further, we revealed that the mechanism underlying an impaired [Ca2+ ]i increase is the inhibition of the activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-Akt pathway. Yet, how cationic liposomes inhibit the PI3K-Akt pathway is still unclear. Here, we focused on caveolin-1, a major component of caveolae, which is reported to be involved in the activation of the PI3K-Akt pathway in various cell lines. In this study, we showed that caveolin-1 translocated from the cytoplasm to the plasma membrane after the activation of mast cells and colocalized with the p85 subunit of PI3K, which seemed to be essential for PI3K activity. Meanwhile, cationic liposomes suppressed the translocation of caveolin-1 to the plasma membrane and the colocalization of caveolin-1 with PI3K p85 also at the plasma membrane. This finding provides new information for the development of therapies using cationic liposomes against allergies. This article is protected by copyright.

The French-American-British (FAB) classification scheme for MDS was described in 1982 and has become the reference standard for subsequent MDS classification schemes. The FAB classification system divides MDS into five subgroups, based mainly on morphologic criteria and the percentage of myeloblasts in bone marrow (BM). More recently, the increasing availability of BM cytogenetics, immunologic markers, and molecular genetics has provided important information for staging, prognosis, and treatment of MDS. A World Health Organization panel incorporated this new diagnostic information into a revised classification system that modified the FAB criteria while retaining most of its basic features. The major changes included the creation of additional categories (eg, 5q- syndrome), distinction of unilineage from multilineage dysplasias in the refractory anemias, and subdivision of the heterogeneous refractory anemias with excess blasts into two categories based on BM blast percentage. Additionally, some MDS subtypes were removed or merged with other myeloid disorders into newly created categories. In independent validations, the World Health Organization revisions were shown to provide more-homogeneous subgroups of patients and greater prognostic power compared with the FAB system, although controversies remain. The International Prognostic Scoring System combines blast percentage, karyotype, and number of cytopenias to generate a scoring system that reliably estimates survival and risk of transformation to acute myeloid leukemia for patients with MDS. This universally accepted scoring system is often combined with FAB or World Health Organization morphologic criteria to provide a more complete clinical picture and the most accurate prognostic assessment possible. As more is learned about the pathogenesis of MDS at the molecular level, it is anticipated that these classification and scoring systems will continue to evolve to incorporate the new information.","inCitations":["16880c0a4d980cc26ec29abbe1637a3591e0c7cd","8d93a70faf53d21d4ebba1fc3d750e7abe55421f","78293489ef9be0583b6d9dec808731529b1cbb8a","819168b41ff6f9e584d3a259f6d673685ed90844","7c47989af4accb1dd7675a6156c934177e8e1999","07995ceb6d2bb3b31794554764f6a7e48307de8e","0e8ca61a593bd39806ce2853f9c37e0ad4e0e8dd","abe3d2ff49b8b5b3ee9bff02f586adee8c800f24","508be2c0b5071927f6fec59168564da37bd8315e","dea7f1c7c4c4bb2934c67170231524fd618f76d3","f9d7e18468d6c03a67c03c22985745ab47fbc514","52d24af354002ae13c31aa61d114d69814a53e77","4dca0069a71e3a777cd82ea578f781ffce074b6f","ae3ace48c83f88ee03783e701e0fd75f5dfd392d","6f7e50a6da4da7663f4fed690b977a44e63974ca","cf7686a37b668285b4bf57ae6a55d1d970fb1a2c","3ceaa4175cb5fadebc90103c43276c46d33761c5","eb78ec714f89e36906977b8e499982aaa7aa1456","e585c31b84df9be03f84fdf7ae1ec0ed6903931e","db7757805cc60b3678515b8b6d3d2ae62287046d","037ee302ad66869a9d7aa7206e0df005b0eb2581","1630621f3966b0ceb7f82c1625f5347935a5c01f","439e58535228666b510fd25fc4cf0843131f7f69","a2a2544d8e831fb0bf684a122d50dd0e1f898a29","2ff939f5aa1a2270824eb3b1e511f1c6ee7bb351","12b8d7d98b7996c641dc7ffcea1625485b8469ce","247a1a4219459f04879c33ec04082addfde7b577","5645d9b8670129877c85a2cacc6af34a01f6476c","325ef71984a567ef49ec1f6d4cdc55417e67bd4b"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"A comparative review of classification systems in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS).","doi":"10.1053/j.seminoncol.2005.06.021","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1053/j.seminoncol.2005.06.021","venue":"Seminars in oncology"}

The orientation and position errors are [( u 0 ) 2 + ( v 0 ) 2 ] 0.5 / f and [( u 2 0 + v 2 0 ) T 2 z + ( u 2 0 T 2 z + v 2 0 T y 2 )] 0.5 / f , respectively, where f is the focal length, ( u 0 , v 0 ) is the offset of image centre and ( T x T y T z ) is the position of an object. We also obtain the following conclusions: (a) The offset of image centre has little effect on the determinations of the position and orientation of a coordinate frame; (b) the lens distortion will not dramatically change the position and orientation of a coordinate frame; (c) the scale factor has a great effect on the position of a coordinate frame, and on the accuracy of measurement; (d) the offset of image centre is more sensitive than the lens distortion on the determinations of the position and orientation of a coordinate frame. Finally, some experimental results are given to demonstrate the theoretical analysis given in this paper.","inCitations":["3524be4e3f2338d9f79ccca7483453aa060df824","76ffede6ab98d870ea30c598576a20ecd337667c","8928cfa8053f7bdf865bd81e557c985c2addd264","0629bbd068faee9a19f3f5b6267611bf16316499","fcccf182191dc7af40738636652ecfb552e5d28c","f054fae50d3dce125b244465baefd188328750f5","9d7dc1300fcbd1f3a3708c6c884ed3c36fb4f151","71baf3b66a5d31159fbb99e57d330f6b537e8eee","902fd5edaa1298398bacec6e3e023a11e24b706c","94c9b9e0aa8818acef97dac66d7db3de5ebeebc9","211cbf8d253591024bf27b7e099241b5df1314e1","e1747276e4912af94447b8f2a4df25d61d9595da","3f022aa00436a7406cd893631d95ddb01b673e20","3660e462a126500bb52c37bd3e1b00dccd48f482","cb462cafd99f7b1ee626d2e00f9ba46d7e506859","00439d6b4f158c12f8b38689a1e8eb7276c2db05","3730a91ea48f9508c6ae0259f9dc0f992861242c"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"On the sensitivity of camera calibration","doi":"10.1016/0262-8856(93)90061-K","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/0262-8856%2893%2990061-K","venue":""}

A volumetric flow rate of 0.3 ml s and an initial concentration of 861.75 mg L were used, and an initial concentration of 83.2 mg L, at pH of 7.5. The White Cancun quarry reports a maximum extraction percentage (% E) of 99.59 at the first minute of contact, compared to the tezontle that reports %E83.78 at the same time. However, the total adsorption capacity was 3.60 mg and 6.62 mg, respectively.

In this study, we explore an eigenvalue problem for Dirac system with separated boundary conditions on an arbitrary time scale . Recent results in the literature about spectral theory of classical Dirac system as orthogonality of eigenfunctions and simplicity of the eigenvalues are generalized and improved. Furthermore, some eigenfunction estimates of the first and second canonic forms for Dirac system are established on . These results will provide a significant contribution to the development of the spectral theory on time scales.","inCitations":["64c16247b4c2733940a3da88b5dd096a58d7df50","aef13cb259b1b151175f02f960d92db4a6a00186","66d9480efe8f0bc530e195c4af532002bfea0ce4","c94b0027fd6c42f8d16e9322e6f7b37e99911218","e8b05fa629eed192e58a67b40cbd0e730d1c562d","6fdbca7ee7970f105102bb345db4c2a7db768ea2","a0562218381b9e84d197dea5f2550bc5da4e1a75","73c51713b8d33c558037540c54822054462781c1","3dcebd3b3446a8e0a3127dea8af2708e28101a80"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Spectral theory of Dirac system on time scales","doi":"10.1080/00036811.2016.1236923","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1080/00036811.2016.1236923","venue":""}

However, in order to estimate the future soil organic carbon sequestration potential and related ecosystem services well, more spatially detailed predictions are needed. The present study made detailed predictions of future spatial evolution (at 250 m resolution) of topsoil SOC driven by climate change and land use change for France up to the year 2100 by taking interactions between climate, land use and soil type into account. We conclude that climate change will have a much bigger influence on future SOC losses in mid-latitude mineral soils than land use change dynamics. Hence, reducing CO2 emissions will be crucial to prevent further loss of carbon from our soils.","inCitations":["14632b7e1a4ab6dc1557ebc66d13b8f3bbf78bc5","f27c306e02d5974ab6d9af68b1e5d7ec718dc15b","56a28c7f466e7fb0e7f6a6a7bfa3d2c90b380e2d","d6e155051ab8db7e9fedd31cd6ce94fb0c8945c2","97dcb150739fe60a7d84b68c24590754900a96bf","9868671b0b77e078d49c49d4a417911688514d94","28d8842f1f2f9eee6e722ed555c5eaf6378c19eb"],"pdfUrls":["https://dspace.lib.cranfield.ac.uk/bitstream/handle/1826/14091/Future_C_loss_in_mid-latitude_mineral_soils-2016.pdf?isAllowed=y&sequence=1"],"title":"Future C loss in mid-latitude mineral soils: climate change exceeds land use mitigation potential in France","doi":"10.1038/srep35798","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1038/srep35798","venue":"Scientific reports"}

In response, the Southern Association of Teachers of Speech sent a letter to the president and regents of the college, rebuking Bilbo. By avoiding the issue of race equality and focusing on issues of academic freedom and free speech, the association's letter displays not only the power of indirection and restraint as rhetorical strategies but also demonstrates a core political identity for academic associations.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"The Southern Association of Teachers of Speech v.

Whist there is reluctance to accept that metacognition and reflection are skills possessed by young children, the Early Years (which is the context of this research) is considered to be crucial in determining a range of outcomes for children and the foci for many early intervention practices. The objective of this mixed methods research was to examine young children’s reflections qualitatively and using quantitative data to explore whether any relationships exist between their reflections and their metacognitive knowledge. Initial findings from the analysis show that these children reflected on a range of different topics, in different dimensions of time and possibly used different styles of reflection. Their reflections contained categories of metacognitive knowledge behaviour, especially metacognitive knowledge of self. Findings also appear to suggest that differences between children’s reflections on objects and their metacognitive knowledge behaviour may not be explained by chance.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://etheses.dur.ac.uk/12636/1/EdD_Thesis_Final_Pdf.pdf?DDD29+="],"title":"Very young children's reflections as indicators of metacognition","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

CuOx was used for replacing PEDOT:PSS that commonly used nowadays to serve as electron blocking or, in other words, as hole transport. The CuOx thin film is consisted of CuO and Cu2O, where the ratio seems to be dependent on the fabrication process. The valence band energy of Cu2O is about -5.2 eV, which is suitable as hole transport interlayer for P3HT based solar cells. The fabricated solar cells has ITO/AZO/P3HT:PCBM/CuOx/Ag structure, where the energy band of those layers produce an inverted structure of solar cell. AZO and CuOx thin layers were prepared by sol gel method, while P3HT:PCBM was prepared by spin coating method. Ag electrode was deposited by thermal evaporation method. The physical properties of CuOx thin films were firstly investigated in detail by UV-Vis, XPS, XRD, and AFM measurements. The solar cell performances were found to be affected by the physical properties and nanostructures of CuOx interlayer. Among the fabricated solar cells, by using the CuOx interlayer the experimental results show improvements in PCE: from 0.06% to 0.721%, EQE/IPCE at excitation wavelength of 500 nm: from 12.27% to 28.25%, and photocurrents generated at the absorption peak (2.54 eV): from 0.34 mA/cm2 to 0.76mA/cm2. In addition, it was also observed remarkable increase in its transient photocurrents spectrum in solar cells with CuOx layer. Key words: inverted hybrid solar cells, anode interlayer, hole, transport, sol gel process, transient photocurrent.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"The Investigation of CuOx Anode Interlayer Effect in Working Performance and Charge Carrier Transport in Hybrid Solar Cells with Inverted Structure","doi":"10.1002/masy.201550316","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1002/masy.201550316","venue":""}

The SCDR faces the technological limits for protective devices based on harmonic components: the need for faster analysis implies the use of a temporally narrower data window, making it difficult to evaluate the signal in the frequency domain and, consequently, the identification of specific harmonic components. To overcome this condition, we assembled, fitted and improved three independent algorithms: GDSC-based SCDR, VS-GDSC and a fast magnetizing current discriminator. As a result, the new VS-GDSC-based SCDR presents a reduction in the response time around 25 % of the fundamental period for the short-circuit test cases, relative to the GDSC-based SCDR.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIE.2018.8433764"],"title":"A Fast Distance Relay Based on Variable-Structure GDSC","doi":"10.1109/ISIE.2018.8433764","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIE.2018.8433764","venue":"2018 IEEE 27th International Symposium on Industrial Electronics (ISIE)"}

However, the association of primary sclerosing cholangitis and enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma is uncommon. Herein we report and discuss the first case of patient who presented simultaneously with these two rare diseases. It is a 54-year-old man who stopped gluten-free diet after 15 years history of celiac disease. The diagnosis was based on the histological examination of duodenal biopsy and the diagnosis of primary sclerosing cholangitis was made on liver biopsy, as well as the magnetic resonance cholangiogram. The treatment of EATL is mainly based on chemotherapy in addition to the optimal management of complications and adverse events that impact on the response to treatment and clinical outcomes, although the prognosis remains remarkably very poor.","inCitations":["794a93bc5679855cf0981a6df09d8106e5a09db2"],"pdfUrls":["http://downloads.hindawi.com/journals/crionm/2013/838941.pdf","http://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/pmc/87/c5/CRIM.ONCMED2013-838941.PMC3870106.pdf"],"title":"Celiac Disease, Enteropathy-Associated T-Cell Lymphoma, and Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis in One Patient: A Very Rare Association and Review of the Literature","doi":"10.1155/2013/838941","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1155/2013%2F838941","venue":"Case reports in oncological medicine"}

Immunotherapeutic strategies have attempted to monopolize on this ability of dendritic cells to deliver antigens as a means of therapeutic vaccination in individuals with advanced malignancies. Since the publication of the first clinical trial in melanoma patients in 1995, therapeutic dendritic cell cancer vaccines have been extensively studied in numerous phase I and II trials. While advances have been encountered (especially with prostate cancer), there are still considerable challenges that need to be addressed in future clinical trials. In this review, we describe the current methodology and highlight trials which have contributed to the development of dendritic cell vaccines. We then review strategies to optimize dendritic cell vaccines in order to improve antitumor responses in cancer patients.","inCitations":["425df9a98e7fe0b82bf572dd036d16de43a232bf","70fa080c64b16b9b4e163fc7a5df69b1a9deb649","0752ff1aebb8f018287d923def1538659262d9d9","3316bfc71ac8a5d1f32e40f7e351677a7c455a70","e14099cd57166f1807da51dccbba1c9a93500040","8e03bc1adf9cca398a2600f28e898953f2962422","6c9713606202201b69830a48f4414391328a1a9f","ed9c449661f720334dd58a3b4aa51d0e9b3aec80","f239ac952d3ac6ea7fced805044ee2e91071c0d2","14610eedf289f9abcef2a6ef6e870f41c53cc6fd","89d7b2649e1eb2e532c92685e0753e07f90b9fd8","ea13f8b8ccacbfcd2bfb989813d845c42b21311e","2b47cb3b955a7d90fbd88d8388aae095ac1fa385","76f82f25dc91752f036d4351c316eba601ac3673","d2bc7d7b15f0f2d4303c3491e9872c61dc41066c","0fd73a7eea53e0fc68ee15c6aa36597dc7fb5532"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"A Review of Dendritic Cell Therapy for Cancer: Progress and Challenges","doi":"10.1007/s40259-013-0030-9","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s40259-013-0030-9","venue":"BioDrugs"}

Fifty-four (54) Wister albino rats were divided into treatment group and LD50 groups. Group A (normal control) was given feed and water, Group B (vehicle control) was injected with olive oil intraperitoneally, while the rest groups (C, D, E, F and G) were injected intraperitoneally with a single dose of CCl4 (148 mg/kg) as a 1:1 (v/v) solution in olive oil and all the animals were fasted for 36 h. This was repeated once every week for a period of four (4) weeks. At the end of 28 days of treatment, liver marker enzymes studies showed that there was significant (p 0.05) difference of these liver marker enzymes and bilirubin levels between the normal control and induced treated groups. Kidney function studies showed that there was significant (p 0.05) difference between the normal control and induced treated groups. Also, the kidney and liver antioxidant study revealed significant (p<0.05) decrease in superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activities as well as an increase in MDA concentration in CCl4-induced control rats when compared with the normal control rats. Histological section of the organs shows that the levels of hepatic and renal damage were higher in CCl4-induction control rats when compared with the normal control and induced treated groups.

The condition is caused by a diverse range of intestinal myopathies and neuropathies.\n\n\nAIM\nTo assess the therapeutic efficacy of prucalopride, a selective high-affinity 5-HT(4) receptor agonist, we employed a multiple n = 1 study design. Each patient acted as his/her own control, each day counting as one treatment episode, allowing comparison of 168 days on each of active drug and placebo.\n\n\nMETHODS\nDouble-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, cross-over trial of four 12-week treatment periods, with 2-4 mg prucalopride or placebo daily. In each of the first and second 6 months there was a prucalopride and a placebo treatment. Patients with proven chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction, including dilated gut, were included. Evaluation was by patient diary and global evaluation.\n\n\nRESULTS\nSeven patients participated (mean 42 years, five female, median symptom duration 11 years). Three discontinued, two due to study length, and one on prucalopride due to unrelated malnutrition and bronchopneumonia. Four patients (three visceral myopathy and one visceral neuropathy) completed the study; prucalopride significantly improved pain in three of four patients, nausea in two, vomiting in one, bloating in four and analgesic intake. Bowel function was not changed substantially.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nn = 1 studies in rare conditions allow drug efficacy assessment. Prucalopride relieves symptoms in selected patients with chronic pseudo-obstruction.","inCitations":["b8b6af8e517995f72c97a222d67e6b8773ee0087","87c486ff69f5b63128e450e7254924701345d212","b81bb51ade6f590bceea9e99bb278bb5f5517d34","40b0db31e842a53670925878b345ccd2762268f1","1b04cf69eaf31d770fa6999e45115f02c3cbf9ec","fcb22ecdae2d18b623ca6413bf8fc64209cc5d91","262ee37c0400f3dd2078788259e0d9eff6d18649","f1bf5769fe960d4168eab08b2bc197573a0f56ba","ef781506223327c26d06d8e2fd84122a92e12289","2aa7123c8efe631ec36c7aa81dad65d586464b9c","271e8d30f43441cdf26da62f853b855ace2dc757","d7e15c78d487db12e9a502e153e08d5948424518","3dfd9e4ae838c5c9e32d92194ac8ed785c80e140","0bcfa407f71748a307a345b35d10ef7e49e6d683","9bc66a6a1f327501ecd171aadab56f4de8e7767c","b6d06b47fbe4ac2b8a508a06f3c37c122ed88f01","2e1b23cc69af90cec1276f62980108f0eebde5e6","1de903a466000456cb92558982090ef8edacc149","8646168b7ef8c88df3f038fe59d0f327a2f3b1ec","3eba1164d10bd498bd9713e6d79c1d7c2f944d56","1d53ab66d7a96d58ec5a5728139d72fabc9d39b7","987839ef7cb94e91928077cb4448c7a209026764","81e72d1719fefe95d10efce3fe486e9ad67fbf9c","159c4365baf2724698daddaaaf92fa48248871c7","348400809f00117f5c307ac3b8f18b1ffe28c201","ad00b483ab0bb4ce06a8f7a8c22c1801a0a8a67e","f35bb14f4619d372bd6aee95ebaa87297a7b91fc","5c316bdde4a1957054dbccdab08e7db81b8b696e","b79a160f46b797f07c8b1ba22c0a1f4a628982a7","65415f47958f1df84eb4681ecb6118e2ddec9567","525ace2cf6aceb5af22d1c5b0d94fa620f5aeec4","beb1b337c8ff77c2107e972ab0f1ead12bcdacc9","440e37df7b8177c863282d0bcd5c0328212304d1"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Randomised clinical trial: the efficacy of prucalopride in patients with chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction - a double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over, multiple n = 1 study","doi":"10.1111/j.1365-2036.2011.04907.x","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2036.2011.04907.x","venue":"Alimentary pharmacology & therapeutics"}
