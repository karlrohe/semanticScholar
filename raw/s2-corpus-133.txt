This study aims to profile UK doctoral radiographers; including their chosen award, approach and employment status. Method This was a prospective cohort study utilising an electronic survey. No formal database of doctoral radiographers existed therefore a snowball sampling method was adopted. The study sample was radiographers (diagnostic and therapeutic) based in the UK who were registered with the Health and Care Professions Council (HCPC) and who held, or were studying for, a doctoral award. Results A total of 90 unique responses were received within the timescale. The respondents comprised 58 females (64.4%) and the majority were diagnostic radiographers (n = 71/90; 78.9%). The traditional PhD was the most common award, although increasing numbers were pursuing Education or Professional Doctorates. An overall increase in doctoral studies is observed over time, but was greatest amongst those working in academic institutions, with 63.3% of respondents (n = 57/90) working solely within a university, and a further 10% employed in a clinical–academic role (n = 9/90). Conclusion This study has demonstrated that radiography is emerging as a research active profession, with increasing numbers of radiographers engaged in study at a doctoral level. This should provide a platform for the future development of academic and clinical research.","inCitations":["9d6f70af4ba9c739ee28d49bda704897dd4e4ae0","d40199058e119d327d84f9cd182fb2965c96b403","0ffa08377ecdb583cec5063f774c189324712ed6","bbc4521854df3ff500fbf16c4a4ef4b06cd13a4a","c00d38fe0b4e0bb268f786a9aad620342b8b5912"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Radiographers as doctors: A profile of UK doctoral achievement","doi":"10.1016/j.radi.2016.04.006","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.radi.2016.04.006","venue":""}

The presence of grain boundary precipitates in this alloy increases the yield stress and the work-hardening rate at small strains (stage II), but decreases the ductility. In addition, after aging, the lower testing temperature (77 K) results in more severe drop of the elongation at fracture. The increase in hardening rate at small strains (stage II) and the formation of microcracks at later stage may account for the ductility loss caused by grain boundary precipitates.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Effect of grain boundary precipitates on the mechanical behavior of Al5wt%Mg alloy","doi":"10.1016/S0036-9748(88)80200-X","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/S0036-9748%2888%2980200-X","venue":""}

In this study, we examined the density and geometric properties of primary and secondary osteons (osteon area and diameter, vascular canal area and diameter) in subperiosteal cortical bone from the human humerus (n = 84) between birth and age 18 years. Sections were removed from the anterior midshaft aspect of humeri from skeletons. Age-at-death was reconstructed using standard osteological techniques. Analyses revealed significant correlation between the histomorphometric variables and age. Higher densities of primary osteons occurred between infancy and 7 years of age but were almost completely replaced by secondary osteons after 14 years of age. The geometry of primary osteons was less clearly related to age. Secondary osteons were visible after 2 years of age and reached their greatest densities in the oldest individuals. Osteon size was positively but weakly influenced by age. Our data imply that modeling and remodeling are age-dependent processes that vary markedly from birth to adulthood in the human humerus.","inCitations":["2ed42af0d8d7dcc45f3293868ebe5771418fecbc","d70aea46e62f5ba8072c1f54d1e16ac65619f36c","398c79308ccef0f783cea6af6afce06ac3a2e910"],"pdfUrls":["http://jm553.weebly.com/uploads/4/1/4/2/4142992/pitfield_et_al_2017.pdf","https://kar.kent.ac.uk/60898/1/Calcif%20Tiss%20Int-accepted%20version.pdf"],"title":"Cortical Histomorphometry of the Human Humerus During Ontogeny","doi":"10.1007/s00223-017-0268-1","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00223-017-0268-1","venue":"Calcified Tissue International"}

However, the procedures or types of argument by which these bodies arrive at their decisions have received far less scrutiny. This paper explores how the diversity of ethical principles, concepts, or theories is featured in publications or decisions of these bodies, with particular emphasis on the need for NECs to be inclusive of pluralist positions that typically exist in contemporary democracies. The discussion is centered on the extent to which NECs may focus on providing focal frameworks, primarily framing the ethical issues at stake, or normative frameworks, additionally providing transparent justifications for any conclusions and recommendations that are made. The structure allows for assessments of the relative merits and drawbacks of different approaches in both theory and practice.","inCitations":["f0636a986372caa1323c26a4a549f5097a4c35e0"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"The Missions of National Commissions: Mapping the Forms and Functions of Bioethics Advisory Bodies","doi":"10.1353/ken.2016.0037","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1353/ken.2016.0037","venue":"Kennedy Institute of Ethics journal"}

The new paradigm for airport management calls for flexible capacity planning models. However, airport infrastructure investments are cumbersome and almost never efficient in the short run. It is difficult to assess the right time for and right size of such an investment. Traffic demand forecasts become of critical importance in the planning phase. This case study performs an ex post evaluation of the demand forecasts included in the Madrid-Barajas master plan, in view of the airport's last capacity expansion in 2006. We deduct that a more robust (and neutral) forecasting methodology, coupled with a more flexible approach to planning in general, could have led to a more efficient and economically sound infrastructure project.","inCitations":["3f950796c9e29d5d15471e3d9b15c330a1615ebc","99413ba2b3919f19140ba27df5511a0b9d81bf43"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Traffic demand forecasting and flexible planning in airport capacity expansions: Lessons from the Madrid-Barajas new terminal area master plan","doi":"10.1016/j.cstp.2016.08.003","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cstp.2016.08.003","venue":""}

Recent studies demonstrate the success of the relative phase (RP) feature in speaker recognition/verification and the detection of synthesized speech and converted speech. However, there are few studies that focus on the RP feature for replay attack detection. In this paper, we improve the discriminating ability of the RP feature by proposing two new auditory filter-based RP features for replay attack detection. The key idea is to integrate the advantage of RP-based features in signal representation with the advantage of two auditory filter-based RP features. For the first proposed feature, we apply a Mel-filter bank to convert the signal representation of conventional RP information from a linear scale to a Mel scale, where the modified representation is called the Mel-scale RP feature. For the other proposed feature, a gammatone filter bank is applied to scale the RP information, where the scaled RP feature is called the gammatone-scale RP feature. These two proposed phase-based features are implemented to achieve better performance than a conventional RP feature because of the scale resolution and. In addition to the use of individual Mel/gammatone-scale RP features, a combination of the scores of these proposed RP features and a standard magnitude-based feature, that is, the constant Q transform cepstral coefficient (CQCC), is also applied to further improve the reliable detection decision. The effectiveness of the proposed Mel-scale RP feature, gammatone-scale RP feature, and their combination are evaluated using the ASVspoof 2017 dataset. On the evaluation dataset, our proposed methods demonstrate significant improvement over the existing feature and baseline CQCC feature.

Relationship between the peak energy and peak luminosity showed quite different behavior in the two sources; Mrk 421 showed very little change in the peak position (0.5-2 keV), while Mrk 501 revealed the largest shift ever observed in blazars (1-100 keV). We analyze these X-ray data with the flux changes in TeV band, which are obtained from 35 truly simultateneous observations. Very different spectral evolution of both objects indicates some differences in the electron acceleration mechanism at work during the flares. We argue that the flux variability of Mrk 421 is associated with an increase in the number of electrons, while the flare of Mrk 501 is mostly due to the large changes in maximum energy of electrons. We also discuss the characteristic temporal variability of TeV sources, and implications for the X-ray emitting site in the relativistic jet.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://arxiv.org/pdf/astro-ph/0105029v1.pdf"],"title":"Five-year Monitorings of TeV Blazars with ASCA and RXTE","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

The public sector and both aspects of the private sector – for-profit business and tax exempt, charitable enterprises – are interested in doing more and better. That includes both sectors seeking to leverage the benefits of what each can bring to an endeavor through cross-sector collaborations and ventures. \nWhile originating with interests that complement each other and even overlap, these hybrid pursuits – financial and social impact, public and private operations – involve interests or depth of intentionality that inevitably will collide and ricochet. There are bound to be disagreements, even under the best of circumstances when those involved act with the best of intentions. \nUntil recently, there were no frameworks within which policy makers might use policy levers to reconcile, encourage, or discourage approaches to resolving such conflicts. Nor were there frameworks by which practitioners – legal, investors, entrepreneurs, and others – could understand their own expectations or those of others in order to identify and exploit areas of convergence and to prepare for areas of divergence. \nThis article expands on four recently introduced frameworks for identifying and managing complementary, competing, and conflicting interests and objectives and the depth of commitment to them as follows: \n• Degree and depths of commitment to social purposes or the lack thereof; • Importance of connections between the effort being put forth and the social impact or results to be achieved; • Whether and how to address direct, indirect, knowable and unintended harms; and • Relevance of accountability and whether to rely on business owners, social/public engagement, and/or legal causes of action and remedies. \nThese frameworks (or something like them) usefully function independently, but they also inter-relate and operate together. The essence of this article is posit how the above frameworks can intersect to identify the areas in which policy makers should and should not make policy concessions for given efforts (e.g., compromise fiduciary duties, provide tax incentives or bid procurement preferences, exempt from securities laws, etc.). This article aids practitioners by helping them identify their own (or their clients’) substantive expectations, those of others, and where overlap can be advantageous and where disparities are likely to become costly diversions.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Structuring for Action and Longevity in the Green Economy: Being Intentional About Committing to Social/Green Purposes, Connecting Effort and Impact, and Addressing Harm and Accountability","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Accordingly, satisfactory techniques for the isolation of frog liver and kidney nuclei were developed. The medium for frog liver nuclei consisted of: 55% glycerol, 0.001 M magnesium chloride, 0.033 M sodium β-glycerophosphate and/or 0.002 M KH2PO4, K2HPO4 (pH 6.8), however, the addition of 0.15 M sucrose was essential for satisfactory isolation of kidney nuclei. Inclusion of sucrose (0.15 M) in the isolation medium promoted nucleolar swelling and a decrease in nuclear volume in liver cell nuclei. Nucleolar migration and extrusion were noted in solutions with high cationic content. \n \n \n \nThe morphological appearance of isolated nuclei was found to be extremely sensitive to the ionic strength of the isolation medium, as was the isolation procedure in toto. Effects were considered to be the result of precipitation and swelling of nucleoprotein. Dissociation of nucleoprotein was considered to be associated with temperature change. The uptake of supra-vital dyes aided in recognition of the morphological alterations and was also an indicator of nuclear viability. \n \n \n \nTrypsin readily altered the nuclear membrane and a rapid decrease in nuclear density occurred, but the nucleolus remained intact. The diverse response of liver and kidney nuclei as compared with the nucleated red blood cells (a contaminant) to treatment with trypsin was noted and its implications discussed.","inCitations":["92824fa096a53b11bb7e382d7fd72179e1e500c0"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Properties of isolated frog liver and kidney nuclei.","doi":"10.1002/jmor.1051180307","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1002/jmor.1051180307","venue":"Journal of morphology"}

Currently, the design of hip implants includes a tapered junction which introduces additional interfaces that connect different parts of the hip implant such as the femoral neck and head or stem and neck interface. Micro motions that occur under the influence of load, together with chemical changes in the host environment, make these interfaces susceptible to tribocorrosion processes, particularly fretting corrosion. Commonly used metallic biomaterials are based on stainless steels, cobalt chrome-based alloys as well as titanium and titanium alloys. Each of these materials possess some degree of limitations, particularly where tribocorrosion events are concerned. Titanium alloy Ti-6Al-4V is widely used in biomedical applications for non-bearing components of total joint arthroplasty (TJA) surgeries. Its poor wear resistance continues to remain a challenge in load-bearing joints where parts articulate against one another as in the case of modular junctions. Some of the attempts made to improve the wear properties of Ti-6Al-4V is through the incorporation of second phase particles like ceramics in its matrix to produce metal matrix composites of Ti-6Al-4V. The aim of this work is to investigate the effect of zirconia reinforcement on spark plasma sintered Ti-6Al-4V composites (zirconium oxide particles incorporated into Ti-6Al-4V matrix) on the fretting corrosion properties of Ti-6Al-4V. Fretting corrosion tests were carried out on as-sintered Ti-6Al-4V and Ti-6Al-4V with 5 and 10 wt.% ZrO2. The tests were carried out in foetal bovine serum under applied normal loads of 85 and 115 N using the cylinder-on-flat contact configuration. The evolution of OCP, dissipated energy and friction coefficient were recorded throughout the test. Microstructural analysis of the samples before fretting corrosion tests showed the presence of globular agglomerates throughout the Ti-6Al-4V matrix due to zirconia additions; the volume of the agglomerates was higher in the composites having 10 wt.% ZrO2. Ti-6Al-4V composites having zirconia additions produced a nobler OCP during fretting in foetal bovine serum, compared to pure Ti-6Al-4V. Furthermore, the fretting corrosion results showed a significant improvement in the tribocorrosion resistance of Ti-6Al-4V with 10 wt.% ZrO2 at all loads. This composition also produced the least amount of degradation. and metal ion release. Mechanical data showed that increasing the applied normal load promoted a transition from gross slip to partial slip conditions for all compositions. Partial slip was found to be prevalent at a higher normal load (drastic decrease of the dissipated energy and consequently the friction coefficient). This mechanical condition prevents a large amount of degradation.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Fretting corrosion behaviour of Ti-6Al-4V reinforced with zirconia in foetal bovine serum.","doi":"10.1016/j.jmbbm.2019.103392","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmbbm.2019.103392","venue":"Journal of the mechanical behavior of biomedical materials"}

However, the functional structure of urban communities still requires attention to provide a basis for a more accurate understanding of urban ecosystems’ functioning. This study has been performed in order to assess functional changes in ecological communities related to changes of urban landscape features along an urbanization gradient. Species abundance and richness of birds and butterflies in the city parks of Marseille (south-east France) have been used to assess these changes. On the basis of easily accessible traits (reproduction parameters, size, feeding habits), we have examined whether different contexts of urbanization favour some strategies more than others. Some differences occur between butterflies and birds in terms of species abundance and richness through the urbanization gradient, showing that at least some species of birds manage to colonize city centre and/or exploit urban resources better than butterflies. But our results also clearly reveal general patterns in biological traits for both birds and butterflies that further reflect the gradient of urban features from outskirts to city centre. Species associated with the city centre tolerate a wide range of conditions whereas species associated with city outskirts have more specialized abilities. Urbanization acts as an environmental filter for bird and butterfly communities selecting species able to colonize and settle in the city centre on the basis of their biological traits. In our context, environmental filters induce a biotic homogenization with urbanization through loss of species (taxonomic homogenization) and over-representation of generalist species (functional homogenization). This homogenization reflects an underlying process of disruption of biotic interactions for butterflies and birds. This study has enabled us to identify a combination of biological traits sensitive to urban features that may represent useful indicators for both theoretical and applied purposes in order to understand the impact of urbanization on animal communities.","inCitations":["547e52f46b6b6ba379fa917871ae19124fa5988f","a8ba8307f60a4d97b7bbb8ae00aac7edc1b3d5a2","16c6903bf0b4fc00e6610f5cab4fe2d5eca69d76","f8f657bb3939d30dbfa259cf3a6e1a04ef668c07","a1f73d67fa7ddc9bf634cf3e428eb3a4610d1db8","a74e52b3ccec84b4a2bf14494bf7755273acec77","42745484591a957c4836c0d46a9153ac60c3f238","18b6c05c41d7c785ce8be80a1efe9dd118b71ccc","d2a4cea55cf1bace4a6e48a3e10aaeb2d6bf0b0a","59a34c6d8c68f3f84dee7ee0a09b1b0870bab533","d4db9137cb43a1de0b8d86ecb0ca88bee3ca134f","df401a0a97a9477f31c3cdb5ac9949c91852595a","000aac9ac2592261ef58c058d99b117543d769a0","14139e83ad883f6b51ec628a2237b384921aba64","3f6b4b88168d6c3f929d923019ff7abde1644ece","132b67fba50c9156ff02ba8dbded9ab1ee160977","328af08c0f0a5244cd71dbaa9e913cfcf406395e","d1216555e3254b5898de4fb1221e368c0fc9e792","e7669b8230240622908b563b52840b3def81cf1e","81f53b082cfc7fff3fd0ed0afaf780bb0e1e7dc3","121be9a71e7917c33e66b9ffe83507b24c3f3548","b865954ddaba6715071f2c917f370b89f50ec5d3","6d1480fa74463a45dea14718890c71aad0baba56","3fa8599656feaf786c7e18b3e13a101ca473c3cb","905f60a0ddd75a606f17389a4abd8c9359931960","1f5914534e82e41dbc890f2b9b079e38e8b238c5","9583966aa5249c1908120d1b191ab9775df7e01e","91ed0747acad49b3130f9e802e00ff9c6d3787a9","5afc7b9d66d056c5c85bf679058b34c878b6b8f8","95598e832749e7adcd027b5b4cd2c69945056e58","6e55909e11a54acd0ffd7fe115243c4defb7a8b9","88675aadd93a55e32dd306f9462257936a393848","b13ad3efb66f44e6a0776bb9814bd958118c5bdf","bcf868513b098f1bc7ba99a7122b4a25c2111e62","6fddf60f80eb3b2c1320275ddb9703bffb7397ca","0985072096037f494b2a79adb944b2cdccda97b5","4ece9c357dc6c69b06b83ef4722fa5c3079b1f1d","205832ca1903ae80bd8c8e2ba2565f744d0b25ae","44bcf124c85d69177b627677072696972d548dc1","54198d1938b5cd164e874ba2afb5a7dae37410de","9a516bbefaf27ce9301568e890b310fad03bcb1c","1b1c53c2c03e43fb83f051e302e7238391630957","85955e76481f161dbf44c297b8cf07383240d850","86e9fafd4d30285b2f10d5d803fa218d12b7bdff"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Monitoring urban environments on the basis of biological traits","doi":"10.1016/j.ecolind.2010.06.003","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2010.06.003","venue":""}

In addition, clinically meaningful conditions such as hypertension and the metabolic syndrome independently of treatment for either condition have shown a prospective bidirectional association among different ethnicities and age burdens. However, along with the positive association between BP and adverse metabolic phenotypes, the exact underlying pathophysiological background has not yet been fully elucidated. Resting energy expenditure (REE), a quantitative measurement of metabolic processes at rest, was found to be correlated with BP levels in different ethnicities after adjustment for potential confounders. The arising clinical question is whether the measurement of REE might be a predictor of increasing BP levels or incident hypertension later in life independently of confounders including body adiposity and common pathophysiological pathways such as enhanced sympathetic nervous drive and subclinical inflammatory processes. To address the above clinical question, a longitudinal study has to be projected. However, it is also important to validate the reproducibility of the association over time, ie, sequential longitudinal evaluation of REE and BP levels. In the current issue of The Journal of Clinical Hypertension, Sriram and colleagues evaluated the association of systolic BP with REE in a cohort of 229 originally overweight premenopausal women without comorbidities who were recruited to participate in a weight loss program to normalize their BMI. After BMIrelated target achievement, the cohort of “newly normoweight” women was observed annually for 4 years and different adiposity surrogates were assessed in combination with BP and REE measurements during each individual investigational visit. The constant association of REE with BP at several follow-up timeframes after adjustment for confounders highlighted the consistency of the results over time. As a general comment, and beyond the purpose of the study by Sriram and colleagues, a successful weight loss intervention of limited time once again was not able to retain BMI within normal levels during the follow-up period. Indeed, the subset of women returned at the last visit had the same weight as before the intervention. However, we should point out that the rate of women who returned for follow-up visits was progressively reduced. Only 30 women returned for the last follow-up laboratory visit compared with 140 women with normalized BMI after weight loss intervention. Thus, prospective changes of body adiposity and REE in relation to BP changes could not be addressed by the design of the present study mainly as a result of reduced power for longitudinal evaluation. Curiously, only systolic BP was used as a principal outcome in the investigational approach of Sriram and colleagues. Although previous reports have demonstrated a mild relationship between REE and diastolic BP, the present study did not explain whether even this mild association persists overtime. Moreover, from a clinical point of view, diastolic BP might be more important compared with systolic BP in middle-aged patients. Additionally, bias regarding the exact methodology for measuring laboratory BP should not be neglected. It would be interesting to know the 24-hour profile of BP and measures of BP variability across visits. Although 24-hour BP measurements might be far different than laboratory resting BP, the former better reflects the overall hemodynamic load and may overcome eventual white-coat phenomena. A step further, does variability in laboratory BP correlate with REE variability across the 3 days of each individual followup laboratory visit? The answer to this question might enable us to better understand the reciprocal temporal changes of BP and REE. Although the procedure of REE assessment seems adequate because it is performed in laboratory conditions of “complete quiescence” after an overnight stay at a general clinical research center, neither the duration nor the quality of sleep the night before testing are reported. Under the hypothesis that participants did not demonstrate respiratory disorders during sleep, REE at awaking could be modulated by sleep characteristics. The role of the sympathetic nervous system in the pathophysiology of obesity-related hypertension is well established. We believe that a more sophisticated measurement of sympathetic nervous system activity, namely muscle nerve sympathetic activity, might better define its confounding effect compared with the measurement of urinary catecholamines alone. Over and under the above methodological remarks, the study by Sriram and colleagues set the basis for the prospective evaluation of REE either on BP levels or on Address for correspondence: Costas Thomopoulos, MD, 2, Helena Venizelou sqr, 11521 Athens, Greece E-mail: thokos@otenet.gr","inCitations":["0abb30b076966aecedafce9ddedf8d6b9e654bc1"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Resting energy expenditure and blood pressure: evidence of perpetual association.","doi":"10.1111/jch.12267","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1111/jch.12267","venue":"Journal of clinical hypertension"}

Both theorists are concerned with the prospect of distinguishing between education that might socialize people into what is taken to be an inherently oppressive society and education with emancipation as its purpose. Galloway reconstructs the theories in parallel, examining the assumptions made, the processes of oppression described, and the movements to emancipation depicted. In so doing, she argues that that the two theorists hold a common model for theorizing oppression and emancipation as educational processes, distinguished by the differing assumptions they each make about humanity, but that their theories ultimately have opposing implications for educational practices. Galloway further maintains that Freire and Ranciere raise similar educational problems and concerns, both theorizing that the character of the relations among teachers, students, and educational materials is crucial to an emancipatory education. Galloway's approach allows discussion of some of the criticisms that have been raised historically about Freire's theory and how these might be addressed to some degree by Ranciere's work. Taking the two theories together, she argues that the possibility for an emancipatory education cannot be ignored if education is to be considered as more than merely a process of passing down the skills and knowledge necessary in order to socialize people into current society.","inCitations":["cb2d6263b0aee61eedd13035c9fd044f1d4aa6ee","8a4de66e556cc1e0c3e2fdaf0beb2ad169d4cae7","232366ed6703fd7bf9d11c4c9e27938d286303e8","f332dc5ba0a92f49a0624d93704c1d6c3555979e","78df8852f191dab3638c78d6b1c7f569adbb6b27","94bce91a32e5550974d2bf32f4d9376819f477e7","3c817f652a99152d0fba8375ad256fa7068c9ce0","f0cd0cbfc52d8989a1b87aec298be789d0451e32","322f5791be2d597ae0e959ec4f4e0f0e2f1928b8","86c6c361fc6901d0d65eba530f7c15911814c69a","f13d8d490bfb8bde8e86aed4f7940271bb147ca6","19037bf786c17622e956437f543099061e2c5540","5a9bcd1f0a362cb425ff74075e8f0455d6818126","5b250b5ad51ebe9266de42617c2f2ccdbd5e8995","8ffa790256e1434f1fb6905ac76224ccdf4f3740","8804f9923be2da580377d1b0bffbd9f4a40a712b","999da7dc846283dc5ccee2a97e33e3474e6c659c","ae13b98112a986eabb23617dbb1dba3db4be60b0","da6531656e859b94e263f4cddbc0359d1ca4ff93","1c77bcf27e600628c6d8465cbed841f552d71f3a","932e2bd743789ac7876efe6e9e4863114cea2885"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.laserwords.co.in/offprint/edth_62-2/edth_441_web.pdf","https://gseuphsdlibrary.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/reconsidering-emancipatory-education.pdf"],"title":"Reconsidering Emancipatory Education: Staging a Conversation between Paulo Freire and Jacques Ranciere.","doi":"10.1111/j.1741-5446.2012.00441.x","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1741-5446.2012.00441.x","venue":""}

A through-the-earth (TTE) wireless communication system sends its signal directly through the overburden of a mine but can have limitation relative to performance, reliability, and transmission range. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) conducted experiments at a coal mine for different TX/RX antenna arrangements using a NOISH TTE prototype system. This system uses multi-turn, relative small TX loop antenna instead of single turn, relative large TX loop antenna. The objectives of the test are to evaluate the performance of the system, to evaluate the path loss and optimize working frequency for the mine, to characterize surface and underground electromagnetic noise, and to investigate the feasibility of horizontal TTE communication and its advantage over vertical TTE communications. In this paper, the performance of a magnetic loop TTE communication system was evaluated for various antenna arrangements. A fairly large communication range was achieved for horizontal TTE transmission. While vertical TTE communication between underground and the surface may be restricted by factors like deployment challenges of the surface TX antenna and short transmission ranges, horizontal TTE communication within the tunnel can reach relative large distances and can thus establish a more reliable communication. Moreover, the combination of vertical and horizontal TTE communication may provide a way to considerably increase communication range.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q23916625"],"title":"Antenna arrangement investigation for through-the-earth (TTE) communications in coal mines","doi":"10.1109/IAS.2015.7356912","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IAS.2015.7356912","venue":"2015 IEEE Industry Applications Society Annual Meeting"}

In this study the relationship between education and lifestyle, defined as a cluster of risk behaviours, has been analysed with the purpose to assess socio-economic changes in multiple risk behaviour over time.\n\n\nMETHODS\nCross-sectional data from the Belgian Health Interview Surveys 1997, 2001 and 2004 were analysed. This study is restricted to persons aged ≥ 15 years with information on those health behaviours and education (n = 7431, n = 8142 and n = 7459, respectively). A lifestyle index was created based on the sum of the four unhealthy behaviours: smokers vs. non-smokers, risky versus non-risky alcohol use, sedentaryness vs. physically active and poor vs. healthy diet. The lifestyle index was dichotomized as low (0-2) vs. high (3-4). For the assessment of socio-economic inequalities in multiple risk behaviour, summary measures as Odds Ratio (OR) and Relative Index of Inequality (RII) were calculated using logistic regression, stratified by sex.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOf the adult population, 7.5% combined three to four unhealthy behaviours. Lower educated men are the most at risk. Besides, the OR among men significantly increased from 1.6 in 2001 to 3.4 in 2004 (P = 0.029). The increase of the OR among women was less pronounced. The RII, on the other hand, did not show any gradient, neither for men nor for women.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nMultiple risk behaviour is more common among lower educated people. An increasing polarization in socio-economic inequalities is assessed from 2001 to 2004 among men. Therefore, health promotion programmes should focus on the lower socio-economic classes and target risk behaviours simultaneously.","inCitations":["6b99f470b00e59afdd65f3b4858e06ea91ef1afc","e99a355981f4c1a0b2ffbea976982641b2a1fec3","4b8c6782a9b9c2ad638dafd0ffa3e0bbf49c2dfa","75c6afcdbd9de45b0473376674e8fc1fe0c4d82c","95d58e6bebdc7ec3ae79070744e14c78ff35e358","230e65f93208bf779d74eeea431e4cffbb8e95f6","f8e77b22442a1340961a1086e5116d60d4b4aec7","6b35ac960b2c057d501269f7c0b96d90536c6cc3","2409a98d480e01a5da7cd3b4cee98c76eb8139ad","2fa5856304d9a7943e7d50deba997c94c3e6d3e6","a0217bd11473ceac087111981c2ba7e9385560f3","aca23599fbf603be3ded21fa969fa284e374b5cd","5f648b5a055f098d4bcfef6986fb27cd32d56fbe","2349b64f6ba8fdcc413b9626e6dc72d5409577b0","95cf67106d01bca0c9531777eea1c63cafafe072","05c67fa2e6c18a2fc97e06e578445e4ebc364e3d","7a133776e6802a82b84f5540ee7d281f58d064b8","e0c06f29e0b7abab950a632eb2c8a5356e770f2b","fb0fff68a47f7611f1fc60350cd45b55c7c8c32d","96dbdffacb0b777f462c68151b6ef49f3422b995","205213686ef43f5e6278188fb14577369744deb3","b86eded918bf545d71d002da2ba51075d87bd2a2","1f3ba4f01e268a09742c7175edb9f23e39955eed","8e63d49d562e42f7f8c03fe4c243f96ba50fbc77","d9f2c3615f0283612c6d792fbb5f3e7cd8d6ba2a","2f4de6c8488beb8f22666db7c7a73f1003ee44f9","3b5ea9affe61cc03a30112fecb37db33154c5578","6f4200d6d01c9a16d751a2c744cd205bd2d6abd9","71e83035911c0fc8f2b6a0a259bd1a635eab7782","2229179332727bd5334c546e5006403141be1512","defa9f9589252d80158446a057382dedffa4448d"],"pdfUrls":["https://www.safetylit.org/citations/ild_request_form.php?article_id=citjournalarticle_169360_14","https://oup.silverchair-cdn.com/oup/backfile/Content_public/Journal/eurpub/20/6/10.1093/eurpub/ckp185/2/ckp185.pdf?Expires=1493726842&Key-Pair-Id=APKAIUCZBIA4LVPAVW3Q&Signature=VG4gDNSL8wHCoR8xxVz2kvDlueQV29Mn8HGvppn01G7Fam41CDVaH5RRUR7wvT3KrMPwEAFJ6ZVPlcYdw810KSu-jcaE8Tuu48RSCWoH0eTMZmy2xPnNxznefswvtLC6A0RfQOetmKC54-AlOTgmFDTx5BF1wGnuVcPMKDdcOXRAPTNxDjXOgTnaQ~pAtZ~v4ABN~-dytrZ127dYYauQ-6T0fIbR9ITC7-Ai6UX28RQ7rSwT-b09tCXAH~lF1ydJWio4Efmdc6Ubqqatv5sXKa7xDIo3lLcZMLnKzcyYv75scjx3-VWK0I2mLkz~OFFazDouhDIqU9yfYCPmPGSShw__"],"title":"Multiple risk behaviour: increasing socio-economic gap over time?","doi":"10.1093/eurpub/ckp185","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1093/eurpub%2Fckp185","venue":"European journal of public health"}

Currently, consensus therapy includes surgical resection and adjuvant radiotherapy. Radiation delivery is typically limited by the proximity of these tumors to critical skull base structures.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThis is a retrospective review of 13 cases of chordomas and 2 cases of chondroid chondrosarcomas of the skull based treated with linear accelerator stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT, n = 10) or stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS, n = 5). The average time to the most recent follow-up visit was 4.5 years. The tumor characteristics, treatment details, and outcomes were recorded. Each radiation plan was reviewed, and the dosage received by the brainstem, optic apparatus, and pituitary was calculated.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOf the 10 patients treated with SRT, 6 were found to have unchanged or decreased tumor size as determined from radiographic follow-up. Of the 5 patients treated with SRS, 3 were found to have stable or unchanged tumors at follow-up. The complications included 1 SRT patient who developed endocrinopathy, 2 patients (1 treated with SRS and the other with SRT), who developed cranial neuropathy, and 1 SRS patient who developed visual deficits. Additionally, 1 patient who received both SRS and SRT within 2 years for recurrence experienced transient medial temporal lobe radiation changes that resolved.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nWhere proton beam therapy is unavailable, linear accelerator-based SRT or radiosurgery remains a safe option for adjuvant therapy of chordomas and chondrosarcomas of the skull base. The exposure of the optic apparatus, pituitary stalk, and brainstem must be considered during planning to minimize complications. If the optic apparatus is included in the 80% isodose line, it might be best to fractionate therapy. Exposure of the pituitary stalk should be kept to <30 Gy to minimize endocrine dysfunction. Brainstem exposure should be limited to <60 Gy in fractions.","inCitations":["9e75a38a144a5f58cdded977257234bdc62a7572","47c1612c883a95e2b0a7be34a30012cd14d70f15","9170a659688ec55dbf322d22891b5ff29de46ef8","72c2a8e0325a8634bf07b98ce6879b5db4b497ba","7493908dd5b6e67ae7ab51f970b67276125f3e7a","f0d7bfe38e184ff7c83f4538ac685a5dfc8fc7b8","d57573354919e851cf9c97113d86f0c01a94a4c1","e381f51267d38fbefe963f1e230d9996ac6c153b","06165856887593e35fb89ce419b18a4503675b46","c6b728eb0e537c6b853e6ec38e93285b1a565aa0","545236c414c02c71460f85ef63fa902aa9ce7827","517695304ca00b2ab38657b2f6cb28c7d74fc622","5da87c6575d72e9b0cf177c129e84a169153ffea","989a64d056ce119d2ff9a581a00359d14846bf0d","edb6121ca3f4f6e68e948ce12f1f825de930da04","d4a16eb011f44af366d02f6fed7a142aaf912a16","fb9712351f19f517453171d580a474cc1775b982"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Challenges in linear accelerator radiotherapy for chordomas and chondrosarcomas of the skull base: focus on complications.","doi":"10.1016/j.ijrobp.2011.08.004","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijrobp.2011.08.004","venue":"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics"}

To investigate the importance of paramyosin phosphorylation, we produced transgenic Drosophila melanogaster in which one, three, or four phosphorylatable serine residues in the N-terminal nonhelical domain were replaced by alanines. Depending on the residues mutated, transgenic lines were either unaffected or severely flight impaired. Flight-impaired strains had decreases in the most acidic paramyosin isoforms, with a corresponding increase in more basic isoforms. Surprisingly, ultrastructure of indirect flight muscle myofibrils was normal, indicating N-terminal phosphorylation is not important for myofibril assembly. However, mechanical studies of active indirect flight muscle fibers revealed that phosphorylation site mutations reduced elastic and viscous moduli by 21-59% and maximum power output by up to 42%. Significant reductions also occurred under relaxed and rigor conditions, indicating that the phosphorylation-dependent changes are independent of strong crossbridge attachment and likely arise from alterations in thick filament backbone properties. Further, normal crossbridge kinetics were observed, demonstrating that myosin motor function is unaffected in the mutants. We conclude that N-terminal phosphorylation of Drosophila paramyosin is essential for optimal force and oscillatory power transduction within the muscle fiber and is key to the high passive stiffness of asynchronous insect flight muscles. Phosphorylation may reinforce interactions between myosin rod domains, enhance thick filament connections to the central M-line of the sarcomere and/or stabilize thick filament interactions with proteins that contribute to fiber stiffness.","inCitations":["658ed34fb30de8e239cece7af2b9466ac361e765","6b8334554e5adfa57904a555a31237b7d655df8e","fb0bed15866bedb8436c8392517935307d5c3773","3c3d526404a9fd8e2ab8ab98b6b5db7c8d88716c","d02cedda75d813220ed35dfa971d9ea5695ba1e9","4fee8aae1a1a4d310789ba58d6b8bb0d61f7e242","106748be678868d9153e04be0e8aa55359b17d4b","9cbbcbdc2074aaf3e0c38e17875d2242e17b78f1","02d296e5f76f8b5176d4466820f3dc065f2e8005","e0655c7b934b6671c68ce94fb95edae013398114","0383bf876d443ef19024275e5db1112ab057fe48","e21569c60dd50bf51ac7d05e973b425dcee7a6ff","ef93edc27964b3061dc86eb8f11f617723b41b6f","d70f2986cd2d85419a8df30ba006baf69e896b2d","f6a0a6c8e1db018c98643dbf39086c52c514c8e5","7e46d8316826631731502d95d65fe8e20e421ee8","cff1002c397197079c5fce99152f6ccd563bb1e7","6721a01a3df82d0861c44a3ee16439f2f5afa737"],"pdfUrls":["https://works.bepress.com/mark_miller/19/download/"],"title":"Paramyosin phosphorylation site disruption affects indirect flight muscle stiffness and power generation in Drosophila melanogaster.","doi":"10.1073/pnas.0500945102","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0500945102","venue":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America"}

This occurs due to negligence of oral hygiene, changing life-style, habits, and addictions. It is Kapha Rakta Pradhana Vyadhi. In modern dentistry papillary or marginal gingivitis can be correlated with Sheetada, on the basis of similarities in symptoms, involvement of anatomical structure, etiology and prognosis. The epidemiological studies conducted by American Academy of Periodontology shows that gingivitis of varying severities is nearly universal. It is estimated that over 80% of the world′s population suffers from gingivitis. In this clinical study, 106 patients were registered among them 103 completed the treatment and were randomly divided by lottery method into two groups. In Group-A, Dashana Samskara paste local application on gums and in Group-B, Dashana Samskara Choorna Pratisarana on gums was given. After enrollment of the patients in the study cardinal symptoms of Sheetada (gingivitis) such as, Raktasrava, Krishnata, Prakledata, Mriduta, Mukhadaurgandhya, and also the objective criteria such as oral hygiene index, Gingival Index (GI-S), and Gingival Bleeding Index (GBI-S) were studied before and after the treatment.While considering comparative effect on subjective parameters such as Raktasrava, Dantamamsa Shiryamanata, Shotha and Chalata statistically significant results were obtained in Group-A than Group-B.

The excellent conformality of ALD thin films can be exploited for sealing defects in coatings made by other techniques. Here the corrosion protection properties of hard CrN and diamond-like carbon (DLC) coatings on low alloy steel were improved by ALD sealing with 50 nm thick layers consisting of Al2O3 and Ta2O5 nanolaminates or mixtures. In cross sectional images the ALD layers were found to follow the surface morphology of the CrN coatings uniformly. Furthermore, ALD growth into the pinholes of the CrN coating was verified. In electrochemical measurements the ALD sealing was found to decrease the current density of the CrN coated steel by over 2 orders of magnitude. The neutral salt spray (NSS) durability was also improved: on the best samples the appearance of corrosion spots was delayed from 2 to 168 h. On DLC coatings the adhesion of the ALD sealing layers was weaker, but still clear improvement in NSS durability was achieved indicating sealing of the pinholes.","inCitations":["64c784f0412505e516dd83d75e26aa0d14637f14","da4166cb63622cce6a8ef50991230f6386209a71","fb334025a90d8a0ae94eec26684ba61b9d63741a","5fb92f10b7830d9decae476f46802c1deb56b245","efb66e5e778619d2229ef489f54da4fddd2e4865","855a94d77848deec2bb8409487eb8d46881531e9","ed654c5601426a9cd4febceadd9c76883e4a6e63","1c50257ff5e739d79c4eb7f10ccfc7b34855e3dd","a286f9d056c00522f02ae699933abf23df4a01ba","70c818e77a4c2d6cd40e9ac32ad046c4302e0144","d33d5bd110441c749caa9666bd5c8d773d4c62a1","5f0851dcc313cb35cdacb9c26974a3953d21e9b1","fa4a085a35f0713e3969e780ae4dfaa79476011c","2cc03834a80b56e6cc1fb06795dca04702833cd0"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Sealing of hard CrN and DLC coatings with atomic layer deposition.","doi":"10.1021/am404906x","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1021/am404906x","venue":"ACS applied materials & interfaces"}

In a subcritical zone, where the deterministic system has a single stable equilibrium, even small noises generate large-amplitude chaotic oscillations and intermittency. We show that this phenomenon can be explained by a high stochastic sensitivity of this equilibrium. For the analysis of this system, we suggest a constructive method based on stochastic sensitivity functions and confidence intervals technique. An explicit formula for the value of the noise intensity threshold corresponding to the onset of noise-induced intermittency is found. On the basis of our approach, a parametrical diagram of different stochastic regimes of intermittency and asymptotics are given.","inCitations":["20ee0d9ffd7cf6f2d40fd32130c5a9536f46581f","7d59087a35fd3c6097e6d27139b45d3caafd69a5","bac2905fb41f426d8b799f044408cf16a5f73aa1","908f4074e9eb63010a13de9151c91a3f18ccd769","8f5470d72193ae96feba0fe0738d6987f01c6862","4f9368bdf1be667b3e63059153b0998bef8a6871","2a85042e84375867969524cc2fe1cee00f1d580a","ce075f25b8e1cf0584ffdeefdb351f79dacf1023","c99d790e02c152ffc03135f4d733b58311d287b4","32402d7b13e6558b1ad794d188f8274ba8e12eb0","840c016e633b0851a6a3df661d0510183b239035","542b602e22f08631e27c74c378acf9ff9c6a9f24","e6a7201bd70ee2b9c76e43e8f0ce6dfba6539eb1","38fcb6966bf5ee31b62eae9006ba31b17085773d","bba971738351f6d0087a0ffe943aa178f2fa565b","2b86e5adc4c2faaa31a4b1cd7361d63ae4a30442","0cdcc2780280b864c43e00ad22673e0432b9a10c"],"pdfUrls":["http://elar.urfu.ru/bitstream/10995/27422/1/scopus-2013-0574.pdf"],"title":"Stochastic sensitivity analysis of noise-induced intermittency and transition to chaos in one-dimensional discrete-time systems","doi":"10.1016/j.physa.2012.09.001","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.physa.2012.09.001","venue":""}

Foi evidenciado, tambem, que a compreensao de que o valor do limite em determinado ponto sempre coincide com o valor da funcao nesse ponto tambem foi mobilizada por alguns dos sujeitos da pesquisa.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Compreensões de estudantes sobre o conceito de limite: um estudo de caso","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Although vaccination offers a considerable amount of protection, it is far from perfect, especially in aging populations. This is due to age-related defects in immune function, a process called immunosenescence. To date, there are no assays or methods to predict or explain variations in an individual's level of response to influenza vaccination. In this study, we measured levels of several immune cell subsets at baseline (Day 0) and at Days 3 and 28 post-vaccination using flow cytometry. Statistical modelling was performed to assess correlations between levels of cell subsets and Day 28 immune responses - haemagglutination inhibition (HAI) assay, virus neutralizing antibody (VNA) assay, and memory B cell ELISPOT. Changes in several groups of cell types from Day 0 to Day 28 and Day 3 to Day 28 were found to be significantly associated with immune response. Baseline levels of several immune cell subsets, including B cells and regulatory T cells, were able to partially explain variation in memory B-cell ELISPOT results. Increased expression of HLA-DR on plasmacytoid dendritic cells after vaccination was correlated with increased HAI and VNA responses. Our data suggest that the expression of activation markers (HLA-DR and CD86) on various immune cell subsets, as well as the relative distribution of cell subsets, both have value in predicting immune responses to influenza vaccination in older individuals.","inCitations":["2724a59699f3d62c785cf52cf11f9e16523f7c3b","2f878c3e63908b65237955a931c551615322eb6d","9306ad0c4653242d23e813fc684dcc6dd50acde8"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"The composition of immune cells serves as a predictor of adaptive immunity in a cohort of 50- to 74-year-old adults.","doi":"10.1111/imm.12599","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1111/imm.12599","venue":"Immunology"}

The fungal disease does not play a major role in professional orchards. However, pear rust is expected to reappear in integrated or ecological production systems with reduced chemical input. Pear rust is an obligate parasite using different Juniperus species as winter host and the pear tree as summer host. The intensity of the disease is varying from site to site and this can be regarded as a consequence of the heterogenous distribution of susceptible Juniperus cultivars. Pear rust is favoured by humid weather conditions in the spring season. Pear rust may lead to yield reduction, die-back of branches and finally to the death of the infected pear tree. Curing of infected Juniperus shrubs is not possible. In allotments, the use of fungizides is critical. The only way to combat pear rust is to eliminate all non-resistant Juniperus cultivars from the house gardens and parks.","inCitations":["7e67c0154abbc2345427dd9449426b5a18007e12","06710e99819714258ac7c737edb1c0a9afb7db37","46373306b2e5cf832b296d8c83f8f546b260e1d1"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Birnengitterrost: eine zunehmende Gefahr in unseren Kleingärten","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

The analysis also suggests the possible existence of a new material property, the critical Péclet number, reflecting the mesoscale geometric properties of the microscopic pore structure.","inCitations":["1cf60b48f22cd4012aa32d09a90cb9ad9eb442e4","7a4111f39fb7225ab6c59cf91c0c02ad56cb012e","7b66ebcb420c1dbea49bb6ca6031204a13407f85","c7310aa8dc0adc441d1918e0d40ac522c5418a5c"],"pdfUrls":["https://arxiv.org/pdf/1111.6512v2.pdf"],"title":"Analytical model for tracer dispersion in porous media.","doi":"10.1103/PhysRevE.85.011306","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevE.85.011306","venue":"Physical review.

Laser-beam-induced-current (LBIC) measurement techniques are used to obtain the photosensitive area extensions of n -type inversion in HgCdTe photodiodes for typical n +-on- p HgCdTe photovoltaic IR detectors. The effect of temperature on the extension of n -type conversion region is investigated by considering the sign of the LBIC signal. Theoretical results show that the hole concentration decreases in multidoped HgCdTe due to the freeze-out effect as the temperature decreases. Consequently, hole concentration is much lower than electron concentration at 87 K. The n -type inversion region extension is shown to be caused with the p -to- n type conversion.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Temperature dependence on photosensitive area extension in mercury cadmium telluride photodiodes using laser beam induced current","doi":"10.1117/1.OE.51.3.036401","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1117/1.OE.51.3.036401","venue":""}

Although my favorite tropical pigeon is the scaled pigeon (Columba speciosa) it was the palevented or rufous pigeon (Columba cayennensis) that nested in the palmettoes near my base camp in Belize. Only five feet up in a tangled collection of palmetto, vines and grasses, the pigeon could have easily completed its complete reproductive cycle and never be discovered. I'm not certain as to the conditions surrounding its ultimate discovery but soon afterwards I placed a small observation blind within easy viewing of the nest. Being shy and wary birds, you seldom approach any of the tropic.. pigeons close enough for viewing with anything but binoculars. The nesting palevented pigeon would, therefore, provide the opportunity to observe and photograph a bird much closer than under typical field conditions. Usually stated as being aboreal and rare, the pigeon inhabits open woodlands and can frequently be observed perched in trees near lagoons in the pine-palm savannah. With a large range it can be found from the southern portions of the State of Veracruz, Mexico south to northern Argentina in South America. A large dark pigeon the pale-vented resembles the more northern ranging redbilled pigeon (Columba flavirostris) except that its bill is black and it has a pale or whitish abdomen. Because its foreparts are a deep maroon-brown it is frequently called the the rufous pigeon. Since the redbilled is also rufous in color the name palevented appears to be more appropriate. Constructing its nest from twigs and pine needles the pigeon prefers the smaller palmettoes but will nest in the larger pines if no palmettoes are available. Height does not appear to be an important factor as nests have been found from four feet from the ground to forty feet high in a pine tree. Unlike the familiar rock dove or domestic pigeon the pale-vented pigeon lays only one white egg. With only one young squab to feed, the adults kept their young well fed. Although I was unable to periodically weigh the young pigeon it appeared to grow at a much greater rate than the typical two squab clutch I was familiar with in raising domestic pigeons. The squab soon was puffing up and vocalizing when I entered the blind. Within a few days the pigeon would join its parents once again making observation distant and difficult. Few if any tropical pigeons and doves are being imported today. Fortunately for aviculture, several individuals have specialized in the family Columbidae therefore providing a limited and costly supply of wild doves for interested aviculturalists. Whether these birds will be available in the future depends greatly on the success in breeding the present supply. This is one situation where aviculture cannot...","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Tropical Pigeons and Doves","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}
