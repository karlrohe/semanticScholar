Seventy-five percent of infants excreted H2 in breath during the first two weeks, 100% by the end of the third week. The peak H2 concentration and the five-hour mean breath H2 excretions were significantly related to lactose intake per day, lactose intake per feeding and postnatal age, though only lactose intake per day remained significant when all three variables were included in multiple regression analysis. Preprandial breath H2 concentration was inversely related to the frequency of feeding. Using the five-hour mean H2 excretion, it was estimated that 66% or more of ingested lactose entered the colon and was fermented. Throughout the studies stool patterns and rates of weight gain of the infants were normal. Premature infants normally malabsorb substantial amounts of lactose. The elevation of breath H2 in these infants apparently represents a successful adaptation of the colonic microflora to this physiologic malabsorption and should not be cause to modify the diet of an infant who is clinically well.","inCitations":["abf36a3a7763dfb73500c71cf609ed4944f5fc9c","fd6b95c29e6f2a75ffc779750ed8c73bb1a13e90","cc26b85e1a48fe09fc7aaa502032a006e57ff7d0","a60415569949960fc40a0957a8f2af54b6cee4c6","be0c742860e7dd1a6791aaa41a7bd27b5513e628","2c82cabb35c9e019f478c7de878d48c2c2485eff","388c26a1d82f5fbd48570364abe1acaf1ca0e134","567258c7b339b66ef278ba04535184806804c644","2361d4b232bdafe0c83358609612dfe71f83f77b","d1520b60e3de20443b2187062828d3a43e8818f8","1f4241e9fb02859561b5786c2da6b13725216cc3","1bf26ea05adfa295c716a78672bfc2f1bb4a88b9","ce8abd6411a72e45cbaa6e160a8535c49b2368ce","49c6828698bee0f098275296999512c6841563ed","13338565673570ffa16e13f7feaa61fda9d93221","4eef3780f3d16e3e167ff55af6a9f48fba731762","c24b2bb25d9cc9fcabff17312b7cdeb8c64d99c9","5c1a81c29ce1a7fe4a1250a10e8cca3cd5edcd7a","a6698f60757d8030cb189410a1bca6f99632bc1a","d58e0b0f3e0b61713ec4f7a8c936c5257463ea17","b9a786422a41b3d15d4f81f3f5c6e36b095bc4a6","e0e354fcff4d474378c77b3596b80ad6433efbc4","8e5673c42b06240303b7813b205b2a1874fa036a","0cb205166dbb654277f92f95c3d38ce9c802fb6b","f2099eacea0d867241117b1cea80415dcac1b272","599b1530586eff5e17d900fb267d1d2f515fd535","70697597630f1420c26978ff48dfd5330abfe12c","f5db423cafc404ae9f948ab1485ab0119b5602ba","acd7bca325e07f027598e435acba25130354d3de"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Lactose malabsorption by premature infants: magnitude and clinical significance.","doi":"10.1016/S0022-3476(80)80186-7","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/S0022-3476%2880%2980186-7","venue":"The Journal of pediatrics"}

On average, bank mergers do not create value, yet they continue to occur. Using cross-sectional analysis to examine 54 bank mergers announced between 1991 and 1995, I test several facets of focus and diversification. Upon announcement, the market rewards the mergers of partners that focus their geography and activities and earnings streams. Only one of these facets, focusing earnings streams, enhances long-term performance. Two other circumstances improve long-term performance: 1) when a merger involves a relatively inefficient acquirer and 2) when partners reduce bankruptcy costs.","inCitations":["b7db6eec7ca5d7bfa1da2c9954fa6c6d0b17cb5b","c7cdd5973de1a85c302c6050116d9045e28ad690","f00463e1a4617d55b9a689ec0a120eade41cbfab","3b38062f1b5a8b2b86ddc4b154439e06ad7e5172","b2f3f24d78da652c74efae448f55c71be0ba6f8a","612f4eb16b4709956b07ae01fc8b25e3d1bb14a8","56c21757a3cd89aaba3b939c0e8a5cbd7157ca30","8c466554b00c3af9204088a29ee1c8d20b00e76f","b0f0a00129fa252a1cad7a54af2b05271e5d87b4","0c03b5f3efb202d1c6637c705a074be4729b9f8e","a67c0c67f2c0688c2c725d099e96023bd69d0d96","380a278c0e4832c457edbbed4af64a7447e99689","4fc8a6f13c3e26d40fc3915db1c39de552dfee74","2ece9a743e7f610f545e14006ae34f4c9b6fce5f","c590ced4fd4857fed2a03904763380402e59ff52","ac499c83b64d26d4826347af9ed66317ecfa890a","6f9dff553714581f05c3d8bb9779bce334c43769","9c3cef87cc6c1c8795cff39b527871f3ce5c2275","6b7ec5f0fc41e20406b9c1cccd9bb69f7b5731fe","21f7c5c13bf50d6faa5cc69ff849aecb8d7c2cb7","9687274e204e1633984aa15f46961439b127d6e5","79acf5b09910980520e69e4dc2ba731c5daaec4a","7ec456d670bb783caaa1177e760ae2370a43780f","4cff2ea77114bbdac657f7857ed038d451239eba","a12df7cff531966ed244ebfb278cdc886f651a84","6acae3daff25547f68784864d6d199b704d0f8f4","9cb24be202b8fa5686b8b6ad73b3420496572c3c","23a6cf0e6b68506822747955e02ce567a1a1688b","f791187f87af3b86d844a1b105141cd24b194e70","ce1234888ce46e4f7c7d5d71f0483baf3015a48a","1a10bb83228721577c5e9712a2a361123ec9affc","6e669457c92e162f6879c3a0b69ada61f04ee8f8","d1c73e67211381c3170cb58b2565215fae0b224c","d567a801eb4a28b23ce9bfe82524fc91f4651032","0ab795929282560c31a72319eb1704893af47f45","10da3c3fac32a4c88c579728f2ff69a90fc01d08","b032876340c47c1400d91c31ad958f0f061af276","ae0c7f2b183577d63589b2e515f3e99be4690891","077f4cccbf52b46f93338c3224582dbedc0d4f12","aa3386c80313715983bc6f40a2adfa655f17139e","be6653437e8bf322f527cfbfa59f6925a7fdfa8a","d4ea819f95fd994e658db5bf94c3c89369b724aa","1de33199840d6d61a16f51bc3974eac39be9c8e6","3699be554de676aae465f4ed0de220d3a37a83d6"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Does Long-Term Performance of Mergers Match Market Expectations?

DNA methylation in the NFATC1 gene promoter can downregulate the gene expression. This study aims to examine the association between DNA methylation profile in the NFATC1 promoter and family history of longevity in Chinese population. \nMethods: We recruited 87 individuals in Bama County, Guangxi in China who were grouped into cases with family history of longevity (n=59, mean age=75.6 years) and controls without family history of longevity (n=28, mean age=57.5 years). The DNA methylation profile in the NFATC1 gene promoter was analyzed by pyro sequencing approach. \nResults: DNA methylation levels were significantly, positively correlated with age at the sites of 77157888, 77157891, and 77157898 and significantly, negatively correlated with age at the site 77157909. The methylation levels at chromosomal position 77157891 were significantly higher in the case group (β value=0.943) than in the control group (β value=0.911) with p=0.02 for the difference, adjusting for age, gender, smoking, alcohol use and cardiovascular risk factors. DNA methylation levels at site 77157909 were significantly lower in females than in males (p=0.02). \nConclusions: The findings of this study suggest that the DNA methylation profile in NFATC1 gene promoter is associated with family history of longevity in the Chinese population.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"DNA Methylation in NFATC1 Gene Promoter is Related to Longevity in Chinese Population","doi":"10.4172/2161-1041.1000179","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.4172/2161-1041.1000179","venue":""}

When I read Representative Mike Ritze’s proposal to round up the state’s 82,000 non- English speaking students and hand them over to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), I was stunned. When I read that Rep. Ritze is an ordained Baptist Deacon, I was incredulous. Thankfully, the rock-solid Republican Oklahoma House rejected this proposal as excessively cruel. In the words of the State’s Schools Superintendent Joy Hofmeister (R.), “There is no benefit to floating outrageous ideas that seek to punish kids.” Nevertheless, this particular state representative expresses patently widely held xenophobic sentiment. White House senior policy advisor Steven Miller tapped into this mood when he disassociated Emma Lazarus’s poem “The New Colossus” from the symbolic meaning of the Statue of Liberty, on the grounds that the poem was chiseled onto the statue later. While Lazarus died of cancer before her words could be inscribed on the statue, she wrote the sonnet to support the costs of the pedestal, for which the French—I will refrain from jokes here—neglected to include in their 1886 gift of Lady Liberty. Nobody would dispute that Lazarus would have ranked Lady Liberty a “10” with or without her poem. Miller’s shameful pedantry is exacerbated by the fact that Miller, like so many American Jews, had grandparent or two who started life under the Russian Czars and came to the Promised Land speaking Yiddish but “yearning to breathe free.” Similar in sentiment toward the foreign-born, Attorney General Jeff B. Sessions has declared a “new era”  in immigration enforcement and that the Department of Justice will terminate the “catch and release” policies of the Obama administration. In light of Rep. Ritze’s status as a Baptist, a Christian denomination that reads its Bible seriously, and which I admire, I will focus my remarks on his apparent disregard for the biblical teaching concerning the “stranger and sojourner” (ger v’toshav).","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"The ‘Resident Alien’ in Ancient Israel and the ‘Dreamer’ in Contemporary America: A Biblical Analysis","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

In order to design microfluidic chips efficiently, it is important to predict the flow passage and to understand the flow characteristics on the chip. In this study, the flow structure inside microchannels has been investigated using a micro-PIV system. We focused on the flow resistance with respect to the inlet configuration of microchannels. The microchannels made of poly-dimethyl-siloxane (PDMS) material were fabricated by a micro-molding technique using SU-8 (photoresist) master. The width (w) and depth of the microchannels were fixed as 100 μm and 58 μm, respectively. Six different inlet configurations with curvature radii in the ranges from r = 0.2w to 1.5w were tested in this study. As a result, with increasing the curvature radius of the inlet corner, the streamwise mean velocity develops slowly in the entrance region, but the fully developed velocity at further downstream is increased. When the curvature radius is larger than r = 0.6w, the reduction rate of flow resistance is not so significant. For the microchannels with r = 0.6w, 0.8w and 1.0w the downstream mean velocity at channel center has nearly the same value of about 276 mm/sec, 10.5% larger than that of r = 0.2w. The simple rounding of microchannel inlet corner reduces flow resistance effectively by smoothing the incoming flow. The length of entrance region is much smaller than that of macro-scale channel.© 2003 ASME","inCitations":["2682670bf415ae9a020a2dae33534b4bb480a78f","ba4e9d7ee7770189ffeee2766ce02f926a5e5a32","e162d302c3cb21903f2b8ae857db9b4d4f34fda5"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Analysis of Flow Resistance Inside Microchannels With Different Inlet Configurations Using Micro-PIV System","doi":"10.1115/ICMM2003-1108","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1115/ICMM2003-1108","venue":""}

The spring which began as genuine grass-root movement designed to create more equitable social projects, was steered by Western powers and local Islamists in different directions with these powers heavily intervening to control and/or weaken Arab states. China has pursued a policy of non-intervention in the domestic affairs of Arab states, and letting the peoples decide their own future. China may have miscalculated when it allowed NATO to interfere in Libya. That intervention had catastrophic consequences for China and Libya. Consequently, China, in collaboration with Russia decided not to repeat the same experience in Syria especially since foreign intervention in this case will be even more catastrophic. China vetoed Security Council draft resolutions calling for regime change in Syria and insisted on letting the Syrians decide peacefully their future course of action. Further, China under the new leadership has suggested for the first time a four-point program to settle the Arab-Israeli conflict. The article argues that the Chinese-Russian approach to the Syrian crisis is bound to have long-term implications for the future of the Arab world. As the signs of the positive contributions of that approach are emerging, China should proceed to reinforce these contributions through a concerted approach to engage with the new regimes in the Arab world, strengthen the China-Arab States Cooperation Forum, correct the imbalances of Sino-Arab trade, especially with the countries of the Arab Spring, focus on investing in these countries in labor-intensive industries, putting the four-point proposal on the agenda of Arab-Israeli negotiations, and, most importantly, deal with the question of the Israeli nuclear capabilities and the potential of Israel going to war against Iran, a scenario which will represent a major setback to the Chinese achievements in the region.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"China’s Emerging Role in the New Arab World","doi":"10.1080/19370679.2013.12023232","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1080/19370679.2013.12023232","venue":""}

This essay argues that Kant’s reflections on religion in parts II and III of Religion within the Boundaries of Mere Reason interpret religion specifically as one aspect of moral education, namely moral ascetics. After first clearly distinguishing between a cognitive and a conative aspect of moral education, I show how certain historical religious practices serve to provide the conative aspect of moral education. Kant defines this aspect of moral education as practices that render the human agent ‘ valiant and cheerful in fulfilling his duties’ ( MS , 6: 484). By this it is meant that certain practices can inspire moral interests either by justifying rational hope in living up to a certain standard of moral perfection (Christology) or by endeavouring to unite human beings in a universal, invisible ethical community that inspires cooperation rather than adversity (ecclesiology).","inCitations":["3e0626c9c4097c942ba7382623eeb41d6c8bfc30","fe70b245cbf849d18088a355823ede127ff27e08"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Kant on Religious Moral Education","doi":"10.1017/S136941541500014X","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1017/S136941541500014X","venue":""}

By explicit consideration of the density-density fluctuations we give the contribution of fluctuations to the spreading width of giant resonances besides the collisional part. For small frequencies and long wavelengths, approximate formulas for the damping of giant resonances are derived. The density fluctuations couple the equation of state to the damping rate and give rise to an overall enhancement factor. This density and temperature dependent factor can reproduce the experimental values of the damping. Inside the spinodal region the factor turns out to be negative, indicating unstable modes. Explicit comparisons are made with the experimental values of giant monopole and dipole resonances. It is shown that the experimental widths can be described assuming finite nuclei since surface effects are important for the influence on density fluctuations. The recently reported saturation of the dipole width with increasing energy is explained as a transition between zero and first sound. Within this treatment we find an overcritical range of fluctuations, above which the nucleus is destroyed and no collective behavior is possible at all. {copyright} {ital 1996 The American Physical Society.}","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Contribution of density fluctuations to the damping of giant resonances.","doi":"10.1103/PhysRevC.54.833","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevC.54.833","venue":"Physical review.

Purpose: Manufacturing and services SMEs in Africa face challenges and constraints exacerbated by ineffectual government policies, environmental turbulence and the near absence of institutional support. The purpose of this paper is to investigate if informal linkages and formal cooperation are helping firms to overcome constraints to uptake of technological innovations in Nigeria. Design/methodology/approach: The paper is based on quantitative data obtained from structured interviews of 631 Nigerian firms. These firms were selected using stratified random sampling from a total population of 18,906 manufacturing and services companies in the national database obtained from the National Bureau of Statistics. Findings: The result of the binary logistic regression indicates that while informal linkages appear to be insignificant, formal inter-firm cooperation is an effective moderator of barriers to technological innovations. Research limitations/implications: The paper focusses only on technological, rather than non-technological, innovations. Practical implications: The paper recommends that, in addition to other interventions to promote diffusion of technological innovations, governments should give priority to interventions that support formal cooperation among SMEs. Originality/value: Previous studies have generally looked at the impact of cooperative networks on firms’ innovation uptake. This paper provides original insights into the “how” of cooperative impact, specifically with respect to helping SMEs to overcome constraints. The paper also delineates formal cooperation from informal linkages.","inCitations":["c39877e064c38c67b28549dccf563a2c51827395"],"pdfUrls":["https://www.dora.dmu.ac.uk/bitstream/handle/2086/16174/JSBED%202018%20Manuscript.pdf?isAllowed=y&sequence=3"],"title":"Technological constraints to firm performance: the moderating effects of firm linkages and cooperation","doi":"10.1108/JSBED-01-2018-0029","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1108/JSBED-01-2018-0029","venue":""}

To test this hypothesis, we examined the prevalences and patterns of cleavage site polymorphisms in the Gag, Gag-Pol, and Nef cleavage sites of C compared to those in non-C subtypes. Codon-based maximum-likelihood methods were used to assess the natural selection and evolutionary history of individual cleavage sites. Seven cleavage sites (p17/p24, p24/p2, NC/p1, NC/TFP, PR/RT, RT/p66, and p66/IN) were well conserved over time and in all HIV-1 subtypes. One site (p1/p6(gag)) exhibited moderate variation, and four sites (p2/NC, TFP/p6(pol), p6(pol)/PR, and Nef) were highly variable, both within and between subtypes. Three of the variable sites are known to be major determinants of polyprotein processing and virion production. P2/NC controls the rate and order of cleavage, p6(gag) is an important phosphoprotein required for virion release, and TFP/p6(pol), a novel cleavage site in the transframe domain, influences the specificity of Gag-Pol processing and the activation of protease. Overall, 58.3% of the 12 HIV-1 cleavage sites were significantly more diverse in C than in B viruses. When analyzed as a single concatenated fragment of 360 bp, 96.0% of group M cleavage site sequences fell into subtype-specific phylogenetic clusters, suggesting that they coevolved with the virus. Natural variation at C cleavage sites may play an important role, not only in regulation of the viral cycle but also in disease progression and response to therapy.","inCitations":["7c576a8c3ef4cfa01dca4c8575836d7fff1a1bb5","efb418b7506810e139095a06e300b57af1d49377","6e7f9903fd8a3b14de07c46b2f6bb3fc95ca233c","789a01fd0dd7701eb9c2e32f9180859f6dcfa57d","b55afeb2424e612f3904d3f42e93f57df1fff7c1","5c0df13adc1f0c7a7c8a32fca4db7d199242a1cd","83f379c85de739b34aba861891eaec59f826c174","39eb9f69ceaa4ec716844c66066194fe0f77c7dd","5c65fb63923dab225c28f699a45fa7bb4b092238","ba8cb13eee4bfd80c1b02cfe85b9e7d3b8e856fa","e09fbf59f76a1b316a82eea07b2ac1faf89c1171","91dc69831bc7363b3d71c712c73055c4f997bb4c","6a27ca36d3eff350dedcd0eaafe285ddc9ecf7d5","743317d906988eada1d825cf399311e199b62b52","454dc8ba5511fce30cd3b76ef3127dfe683b5c0f","01f966dc5e3440db88ad0f56983f0b42efb178a1","eab3117d2b69769a9cd63d958d144c999fe7f842","89645a2a58644524145e8665a7116bb9a707cd44","016c00d8a3df6207280d474198167da874581e66","1e15469bf0a23053ef082c5240a067dfb8e6f0b5","07ee79f7317a802742882eb611e5ca46ace8d607","52a1b93d12236746a63ee4cb7b8865c1a492a244","13d88781f78d4b9f6e029682b7f17e6c666348bb","5ff1933fc7cd10c76c3db27c7b1192f78b99be30","587843ed08406e1d8b6bebf52450647e0b008be1","3ddc6b0540a79820a9695aa97db34c06e8be858e","d736c938467ba5a3768c0fd7e38d69c4f127bad6","6a8fad27722a9fc206ef8ca1a919d4ed8a8a677b","a256e43c24946b3ef623c4ea7a93e3c675df0fc6","48cd7b709a0d8ee3d0afbb69717be73c3bba617a","0efbb4500efdb68ee6d0940a302cd0beffb2c795","d6947db66415f8534fce4c07ad59ff7069f038de","1d8f1d29b30da35049d2e5780a259f7183380364","2c3f44cbb2b4075fd51bf4f07628fe29263d3477","9cfdcfed273d9781df4510cd07fb2cfdb708c974","492ebf1e8f2ca03ce831b3343ced8a0ee537de11","37f560ba31a7b4f1d5fa389c5e7052a70281c72e","aac9d9e64808ad817aab7ef9c181f6fc48976297","786dfda578b431b74f94e0ad5ff439ca03cd66cb","a18a1a1a9641ea105f092d8baa994569ee579a0b","ccf617b7b0b77d95d54a2d481755f6d8acaa8be8","ed610e3cb3696b2a25490d26ad19a1ef8229663d","0d55b70209707f289f232f100d7c095ff7a5c36f","89a544fb2b767ebe71e32010b27721371e7b1798","f009f0cb82e5454bb1fb3a9155eb33f99b586ee4","844691b9285f5d5104424601401b017f84a042d0","c4e2ac2e8867dd27f1df8aa1ca47c5a388387403","1446ef0a8fe087f5e59f5c6328440ef7553439b3","c19ec924dcc7ba63ddb56603e2a29aabd9de8865","4e5e656945a4ea21416cc8b2e3d41f333a4208be","60825e82f1b6beefdb58a5afca3d439137c51140","f5694b32eef5e1bc31f02a29ccbba51ccfef6bf8","1e6a13c8c648761a4e01fa8b41b2c8224209c16e","146d9659efcce4205eb36b52566cf15ce3b82386","0b9e1fc6df093feb79bdfb986a9ff0c3852c5825"],"pdfUrls":["http://bioafrica.mrc.ac.za/manuscripts/deOliveiraProtease.pdf","http://repository.up.ac.za/bitstream/handle/2263/2814/De%20Oliveira_Variability(2003).pdf?isAllowed=y&sequence=1"],"title":"Variability at human immunodeficiency virus type 1 subtype C protease cleavage sites: an indication of viral fitness?","doi":"10.1128/JVI.77.17.9422-9430.2003","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1128/JVI.77.17.9422-9430.2003","venue":"Journal of virology"}

Then, by presenting a field research, which took place in the Italian city of Genoa, and by confronting its outcomes with some most widespread disciplinary eParticipation underpinnings, the paper seeks to identify some areas where a widened disciplinary scope is particularly needed.

The sample included 592 accused randomly selected from all persons absolutely discharged in British Columbia, Ontario, and Quebec. Of these, 291 were absolutely discharged by provincial Review Boards in the three-year period prior to the landmark Winko decision and 301 in the three-year period following the decision. Analyses of information collected from Review Board files revealed few significant post-Winko changes, instead highlighting differences in practice and policy between jurisdictions. The only observed change in characteristics across jurisdictions was an increase in the prevalence of substance abuse disorders following Winko. No significant effects on outcomes were observed. Although the long-term effects of Winko remain to be seen, the effects appear to be minimal to date. Treating the Winko decision as a case example, discussion focuses on how findings of the present study may contribute to our understanding of the impact of policy and legislative reform on mentally disordered accused.","inCitations":["d0bccd0f293ccc5fbf9d369b42b1a3f2a26863b8","4b7e8065fe191881824d003b6a702a20a2395f71","cd5b38726ab290d713b1755c2c3fca3a020e575b","186e678c6d0acc524fd55cc137e0da2024938ff0","0b7f4b5841334b0ae3ce1b5168beaa293c528dbc","10494c6c0d78ff60b29f7026c01db508d52c87aa","b980211462ebb8c9c14bee11c3cc05abea70e10e","69d832ec3945b3839138ccbe7ea0a26efe8e5d98","65f0bbfb47dc825151524ed0c14d903123ab49b1","520cd4ac9ecea7b70ed72884721b660a2e82089e","95120f333d01c244adada12ecedfd883f761e2a0","77e999123cf487e3a24e85dd64ee32b1b544e706","930ae3b48332072e784b651b4921d6bbf684efc7","078cfb085a67b5a13aae0b745181fd5d81b3a08d"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"A Canadian Example of Insanity Defence Reform: Accused Found Not Criminally Responsible Before and After the Winko Decision","doi":"10.1080/14999013.2008.9914399","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1080/14999013.2008.9914399","venue":""}

Desmin filaments are thought to play fundamental roles in cellular force transduction and the maintenance of structural integrity under mechanical exposure. Although the importance of desmin elasticity and assembly/disassembly dynamics in cellular mechanics is being increasingly recognized, the molecular basis of desmin's elasticity or its disassembly pathway are little understood. In the present work we explored the elasticity of purified desmin filaments by stretching them longitudinally with surface-tension forces.Desmin, purified from chicken gizzard, was polymerized by the addition of MgCl2. Polymerized filaments in a buffer droplet were then stretched by using a custom-built horizontal rotor assembly. Driven by centrifugal force, the droplet spread radially on freshly cleaved mica surface. Partially surface-adsorbed desmin filaments became extended by the receding meniscus and were captured on mica in the over-stretched state. The stretch force acting on the entire cross-sectional area of desmin was calculated to be 4 nN.As a result of this molecular combing, the average contour length of desmin filaments increased from 0.89 µm to 1.38 µm, which corresponds to a 1.6-fold axial stretch. Molecular combing together with EDTA-treatment caused the fragmentation of desmin filaments into short, 60- to 120-nm-long and 4-nm-wide structures displaying periodic, 34 nm-surface protrusions. Based on these calculations the observed fragments are hypothesized to be protofibril fragments composed of laterally attached desmin dimers. The orientation axis of the surface-constrained fragments deviated widely from the filament axis, suggesting that the protofibrils are not aligned in parallel within the filament during axial load. Furthermore, the emergence of protofibril fragments suggests that the head or tail domains of coiled-coil desmin dimers are the load-bearing elements during axial stretch.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Axial Elasticity and Mechanical Fragmentation of Desmin Intermediate Filaments","doi":"10.1016/j.bpj.2014.11.2475","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bpj.2014.11.2475","venue":""}

Therefore, detection and avoidance of donor reactive HLA antibodies prior to transplantation is of outmost importance in order to minimize the risk of rejection. Detection of pre-formed HLA antibodies is currently performed using complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) assay alone or together with a flow cytometry based crossmatch (FCXM). This study was initiated to further evaluate our recently developed flow cytometry based procedure for determination of both cytotoxicity of and IgG binding to donor-derived lymphocytes by HLA antibodies. Highly enriched immuno-magnetic bead purified T and B lymphocytes were used as target cells for patient sera using 96-well plates. Importantly, the assay shows high sensitivity and specificity as determined by HLA typed donor cells and serum with defined HLA antibody IgG and C1q. Based on this and additional data generated in this paper, such as evaluation of appropriate serum and complements incubation times and assay reproducibility and stability, will enable us to more rapidly implement this assay in our clinical laboratory routines. In addition, we demonstrate that FCtox crossmatching of deceased donor cells has superior specificity compared to conventional CDC assay especially regarding high frequencies of false-positive reactions.","inCitations":["2e80ce2c1d926d42362fcacf8a61cbfba8e18176","94b548e9bdfb8bfd9865b466bfab6820e3702a31","93170b10b813578f51defc9db97b16b20f44bafd","92cf18533fa27170f2ed137d4a99a1467a8b2724","31031175c92ea26d8b406a74a514e0462321f185"],"pdfUrls":["https://www.karolinska.se/contentassets/6a27399239d24c83a03abd9d7b17b6c5/improved-flow-cytometry-based-cytotoxicity-and-binding-assay-for-clinical-antibody-hla-crossmatching.pdf"],"title":"Improved flow cytometry based cytotoxicity and binding assay for clinical antibody HLA crossmatching.","doi":"10.1016/j.humimm.2015.09.047","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.humimm.2015.09.047","venue":"Human immunology"}

They presented an unambiguously irreverent critique of a nation, and a community, torn apart by over a decade of Thatcherite policy that unashamedly sought to nail the closet door shut. Yet twenty years after his death, what role did his work play in shaping the direction of the British queer cinema that emerged ‘post-Jarman’? Or are his films, as some surmise, merely “elegies for a lost world” that has long since faded “beyond the reach of memory” (ibid)? \n \nFrom the transient ‘coming out’ optimism that characterised the post-Tory nineties, to the much starker social realism of the new millennium, this paper will explore the legacy of Jarman’s work in relation to a cinema seemingly adrift and still struggling to shake off the residues of Thatcher-era guilt, social division and internalised homophobia. By drawing analysis from a number of more recent films, I will argue that while the wider social and political struggles for LGBT equality and recognition continue, some contemporary filmmakers have emerged with a renewed determination to navigate a new direction for British queer filmmaking that can, perhaps more importantly, delineate the problematically complex, yet queerly fluid, narrative contours and contexts of ‘the ordinary’. Because as Andrew Haigh, director of Weekend (2011), puts it: “We’re not afraid now to tell stories about flawed gay individuals who are fully rounded characters and just as fucked up about life as everyone else.”","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://eprints.glos.ac.uk/3679/1/v5ajourneywithoutdirectionGriffithsfinal.pdf"],"title":"\"A Journey Without Direction\": Mapping British Queer Cinema Post-Jarman","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Cross-over to the other treatment on disease progression was mandated.\n\n\nPATIENTS AND METHODS\nPatients who experienced treatment failure with one prior FU-based therapy and had not received prior irinotecan or oxaliplatin, either for metastatic disease or within 6 months of adjuvant FU therapy, were randomly assigned to arm A (irinotecan 350 or 300 mg/m(2) every 3 weeks) or arm B (FOLFOX4).\n\n\nRESULTS\nA total of 491 patients were randomly assigned (arm A, n = 245; arm B, n = 246); 288 (59%) had experienced treatment failure with FU for metastatic colorectal cancer. Two hundred twenty-seven patients (46%) received protocol-mandated third-line therapy (arm A, 43%; arm B, 57%). Median survival was 13.8 months (95% CI, 12.2 to 15.0 months) for initial treatment with FOLFOX4 and 14.3 months (95% CI, 12.0 to 15.9 months) for irinotecan (P = .38; hazard ratio = 0.92; 95% CI, 0.8 to 1.1). Response rates (RR; 28% v 15.5%; P = .0009) and time to progression (TTP; 6.2 v 4.4 months; P = .0009) were significantly superior with FOLFOX4. In the nonrandom subset of patients who crossed over, RR and TTP improvements with FOLFOX4 continued into third-line treatment. Irinotecan therapy was associated with more grade 3 nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and febrile neutropenia; FOLFOX4 was associated with more neutropenia and paresthesias.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nIn patients who experienced treatment failure with front-line FU therapy, OS does not significantly differ whether second-line therapy begins with irinotecan or FOLFOX4. FOLFOX4 produces higher RR and longer TTP. Both arms had notable OS in patients who experienced treatment failure with first-line FU therapy.","inCitations":["5472dbea31babf65b6a7c932099fda926e208e61","331a1fa8ccd2891ee0eb218a5bf85de2b281bf3b","cf09adb6a1f7c05b966121726a0691cfda13543a","cbd44031ad1a97ee6f9297dbfdf1077ae75de90e","7db20f948e482863b7806bdb2d79d8e1dce06abc","335f5ee049fcd063bc97059ca4234e5268185228","c87d98f60742f76deeeaafa59bcfb85e7138e003","a88d57692dfc3ac32d1ec5b2c63f0f9dc8b36be1","b3116e62dc66aa760b5f9bd581f49d2ff94ba6fa","017b502434718b31bc79206b43fafe1d9da8574b","345c57de3af67cbbf12331f655aa5bfaa1824d37","4f592cc1803788a73ee0648b7365b22c3171e0a5","d5932553a5e332db8127b00a4aa38216f82f6fe8","fc8ae8e548af633b00ebb16c7c7cb36e57536b4f","35166f7445d4046bc892128291e2db5e452d8508","49b80f7869f336a1c6394a718e9b45d16562e1be","e4ea2f9377144f8dc197ba0a7b371b73d5387669","781b91e21db708206ef39eb5a450bd04c4547409","5bb21e0baca50a492b699920b2ae851770db1ed1","169f417312e8ed80557e936b53180dc09e86986d","049d1bd257e020d505354a218cbdda87554fdc0d","0b9677ab2e5aaefd1a9b0c86db1f9aff3fb9e354","ae10a4278039a31329e9ac2021fc21d572031a1d","216fb16d018b1ef0d5a95e7d06039fd68abf5b39","bdcbed214d4dce77def94ce1c14cf35325f7449f","8fd6a9d37288275efc8b52bb201ffa728b801b36","67431f5e54ac2861862b1cdc86312fe88d47839d","8056cc91968e8ecbaeef05b35cf57f26ec92e882","4c6907f344e451d79ead7f9d8ec83d9aac0a254f","cc1531febf292be4f32ffa725ee4b0db91b35697","444d77c24ed8bd3d2101ceea5db5295fada92abe","e06f29507b0e79dfe1e3b74c563298ef6d756def","c4378ef70fccf18f3f5de29c87283245d8b7cbc0","ffaa822003b767ba0cbfe570826e936decb42005","2beff515ff31e59cc1a56823f3c0bd06704d8529","74343fba6ecb87f9c72cf3eef5c9b194548be0ea","1cd245606fa0d165b6612e050c44220d96e1e28c"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Phase III noninferiority trial comparing irinotecan with oxaliplatin, fluorouracil, and leucovorin in patients with advanced colorectal carcinoma previously treated with fluorouracil: N9841.","doi":"10.1200/JCO.2008.20.4552","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1200/JCO.2008.20.4552","venue":"Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology"}

For example, muscle metabolic activity prior to death can affect the concentration of oxygen, ATP and the pH of muscle. Handling stress of fish prior to harvesting is characterized by increased swimming activity which leads to anaerobic metabolism while energy stores are depleted and white muscle pH drops leading to acceleration of autolytic reactions after death with consequences for the organoleptic parameters of fish fillets and the filleting yield of farmed fish. In addition to the food quality aspects of the slaughtering method, the potential suffering of fish being handled during common aquaculture procedures or during slaughtering prompted scientific research in the welfare of farmed fish during harvesting. The purpose of this work was to investigate the effect of handing stress on post- mortem muscle pH and rigor mortis. European sea bass were harvested using two different levels of handling stress. Muscle pH was monitored shortly after death and after ice storage. Drip loss, and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) were measured in ice stored fillets. Antemortem stress resulted in rapid drop of muscle pH and onset of rigor mortis. Drip loss, and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) increased in the stressed fish. The results indicate that reducing handling stress during harvesting can delay rigor mortis and improve the quality of European sea bass fillets.","inCitations":["90a1968380309b44c8399bf0ae7debb5d3e29dfb"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Antemortem and postmortem biochemistry, drip loss and lipid oxidation of European sea bass muscle tissue","doi":"10.1016/j.profoo.2011.09.164","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.profoo.2011.09.164","venue":""}

It took place in Delft in parallel with the EUROSIM’01 Congress. These papers were extended to enlarge their scope. BioMedSim is organized by Francosim (the French speaking simulation society) and EUROSIM. The conferences are intended to be an opportunity for researchers and industrials to present fundamental work and applications in the fields related to the modelling and simulation in living systems. The third conference, BioMedSim’03, was held at the Balamand University in Lebanon in May 2003. By a larger diffusion of this work, we hope that a larger number of biologists will participate at future conferences that allow a wider exchange of experience between biologists and the simulation and modelling community. As mentioned in our editorial to the previous special issue (Vol. 8, No. 1 & 2, April 2000) the inter-penetration of engineering sciences and biology and medical sciences has led to important changes in research and development methods. The contribution of quantitative modelling and simulation methods as well as computer science in its algorithmic and architectural aspects have boosted the exploration and validation processes in this field. The availability of modelling and simulation tools permit the access to research and development axes, which were up till now, unattainable. While remaining very pertinent, these tools are sufficiently general such as to allow easy access to biologists that wish to enlarge the scope of their experimental work. In Biology, running experiments is quite expensive and would gain in efficiency and insight through quantitative model driven protocols. Modelling and simulation techniques have proved their usefulness in many fields and their application to biology and is vital and crucial in elucidating biological mechanisms. With the exception of the genomic applications, it has not been fully used in Biological Sciences. Biologists are today overwhelmed with the amount of data available that need to be analyzed and modelling and simulation may help reduce the cost and development time.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1016/j.simpat.2004.03.001"],"title":"Advances in modelling and simulation in biology and medicine","doi":"10.1016/j.simpat.2004.03.001","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.simpat.2004.03.001","venue":"Simul.

Freshly isolated human monocytes plated at high density and treated either with LPS plus IFN-γ or TNF-α plus IFN-γ became transiently dye coupled (Lucifer yellow) within 24 h. Cells treated with LPS, TNF-α, or IFN-γ alone remained dye uncoupled. In dye-coupled cells, the spread of Lucifer yellow to neighboring cells was reversibly blocked with 18 α-glycyrrhetinic acid, a gap junction blocker, but it was unaffected by oxidized ATP or probenecid, which block ionotropic ATP-activated channels and organic anion transporters, respectively. Abs against TNF-α significantly reduced the LPS plus IFN-γ-induced increase in dye coupling. In dye-coupled monocytes/macrophages, but not in control cells, both connexin43 protein and mRNA were detected, and their levels were higher in cells with an elevated incidence of dye coupling. In dye-coupled cells, the localization of connexin43 immunoreactivity was diffuse at perinuclear regions and thin cell processes. The addition of 18-α-glycyrrhetinic acid induced a profound reduction of monocyte/macrophage transmigration across a blood brain barrier model. It also induced a significant reduction in the secretion of metalloproteinase-2 in cells treated with TNF-α plus IFN-γ. We propose that some monocyte/macrophage responses are coordinated by connexin-formed membrane channels expressed transiently at inflammatory sites in which these cells form aggregates.","inCitations":["8687694e932f361f5d7a49708b637ee21130ffa5","c05d685372836c266bbebbce438b823b61f0984f","6ec6abbb099fc09c5868bcb412322986156d1859","b5618eff6f74aa35098e5c1cbc8fb1cde83bad40","068633342809838f93db0a715237022efa393ea9","ba7ac9446ca27064c79198637764b34d80fb6c10","3da53f4c564a2d8a764073cd0dc0d7bcd258671e","23b0254477071606ab9c4f25d8d2408b228579a7","0993e6049bb63f649042a1dfff57e0abde71c82d","55ecacda5eefe577e05f4c0b3f6c8deb664712e2","2e8ecaa46fcab8f35696e60e2942492b81c9428f","97617e519b9bcd8399baa5a516e5068a6853ed06","bbaaaf07326d0981e0384bf85cc6aa5206c4b5ee","9a5a1f0d6d62eb0380b3227971129504ac6b153a","7b184b33fb9aafe368880b9db3e4cd72c24f2490","49a868a2ba8b6b554d2762a428d303dd171c0a56","ef2e4dd6fb1e06231a5f46ddb5caabc054ca051d","9695ed8bea613391b7db1aeedd7cf82d54f49c84","a665ad2e630b8640de6af4eef3a11bdb6272f317","a621b138c7861ce699537c1e180341929af18923","d90ca0fb5c864339cbc96255eea0bf120deda213","0c780d49d24d95cf30bbe0239d4adbf74a9486f4","367e27dbd8a5351b3f2ffb57da54bc5b9f5b6125","533a6b14b3859fbd9fa1b9da3f39d27c2cbcec48","fdb5f49d15b7e6a9229e8f4009ce22d8b3ab0782","0b1d14f8ab1a623dfe4c41c37d52703f41a2f38a","0fac443c3140a17b5d5f0e22b47721ded9274f6f","cd0cd2d69e4c5b2cdbf02a0f6bf7bda9b8786707","8ca56ce41425e811d6737145f8a3e4216e662d6e","a5615dbe2f0b37b473c7ffa9dde38bc45fce58d8","ed5c89d206bdd26bceeec909ea9452347cabee1b","9a7fd44730eb5bf120f4facac525f06d35afc343","809f849f63ae5cb40f56b574cfe96f55a87bd9a6","804fc7fe1b6875714a0739a34c1aafbcecd4b6fb","db3e8c3d3bbf447178902b6252a7e84f98565c08","8c8430491f9048220a4b95321792d3d7b9c3e00a","1e019a6beaf8f530542fb4867a1c4b97f239b202","6abe237a70fa03ab1760750f60441c10025f34bf","5d2c4d530be4f29110531ebcd78381c32dafa685","24ec4f6e1fcc1f1fa143b36d82becdd59f58750c"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"TNF-α Plus IFN-γ Induce Connexin43 Expression and Formation of Gap Junctions Between Human Monocytes/Macrophages That Enhance Physiological Responses","doi":"10.4049/jimmunol.170.3.1320","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.4049/jimmunol.170.3.1320","venue":""}

So, the unilateral contact conditions due to tensionless and elastoplastic softening/fracturing behaviour of the soil as well as due to gapping caused by earthquake excitations are taken into account. Moreover, second-order geometric effects for the pile behaviour due to preexisting compressive loads are taken into account. The numerical approach is based on a double discretization and on mathematical programming. First, in space the finite element method (FEM) is used for the simulation of the pipeline and the unilateral contact interface, in combination with the boundary element method (BEM) for the soil simulation. Next, with the aid of Laplace transform, the problem conditions are transformed to convolutional ones involving as unknowns the unilateral quantities only. So the number of unknowns is significantly reduced. Then a marching-time approach is applied and finally a nonconvex linear complementarity problem is solved in each time-step.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"A Numerical Approach to the Unilateral Contact Dynamic Problem of Soil-Pile Interaction","doi":"10.1007/3-540-27438-3_10","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/3-540-27438-3_10","venue":""}

The NCDs are Medicare coverage policies issued by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). The process used by the CMS in deciding what is and what is not medically necessary is lengthy, involving a review of evidence-based literature on the subject, expert opinion, and public comments. In contrast, LCDs are rules and Medicare coverage that are issued by regional contractors and fiscal intermediaries when an NCD has not addressed the policy at issue. The evidence utilized in preparing LCDs includes the highest level of evidence which is based on published authoritative evidence derived from definitive randomized clinical trials or other definitive studies, and general acceptance by the medical community (standard of practice), as supported by sound medical evidence. In addition, the intervention must be safe and effective and appropriate including duration and frequency that is considered appropriate for the item or service in terms of whether it is furnished in accordance with accepted standards of medical practice for the diagnosis or treatment of the patient's condition or to improve the function. In addition, the safe and effective provision includes that service must be furnished in a setting appropriate to the patient's medical needs and condition, ordered and furnished by qualified personnel, the service must meet, but does not exceed, the patient's medical need, and be at least as beneficial as an existing and available medically appropriate alternative. The LCDs are prepared with literature review, state medical societies, and carrier advisory committees (CACs) of which interventional pain management is a member. The LCDs may be appealed by beneficiaries. The NCDs are prepared by the CMS following a request for a national coverage decision after an appropriate national coverage request along with a draft decision memorandum, and public comments. After the request, the staff review, external technology assessment, Medicare Evidence Development and Coverage Advisory Committee (MedCAC) assessment, public comments, a draft decision memorandum may be posted which will be followed by a final decision and implementation instructions. This decision may be appealed to the department appeals board, but may be difficult to reverse. This manuscript describes NCDs and LCDs and the process of development, their development, issues related to the development, and finally their relation to interventional pain management.","inCitations":["e5e3b7b39c59c9ebf707f58becb8944a8fc38d35","7673cb06af09f26b04f015b115f34e646cfe338a","b2b030b9cea9b8b153ae19af55419d38191b6714","9ca69132e075245e15a1b525432804bb32152348","0a259a57459fbd59466ba3fbf0a5030cc1fc1f3f","7ce8d25ccac37164f6c2b554810ca12af8473bd5","faed8edc6688cb2e078e80d29ac5365d96a0771b","c6fcee30c00bff61cc4082b127bb06ae2577e3ce","e2f3faa75791b4d656785232a35a3b9f4ebd2a0b","abc2048c0738d00b6fd8946da78c43de6ea75819","f14d02327f173d7a03799f5b45384e68799655e1","530b6129dc600f1b9a5fb5286daa84145e823ea0","5a5ea30c84549a8efe796e523fee379a8f210f3e","ef7a66735874de75469411ba448a3db48c335a4e","5b3772d0ec29067bb53baa70ba86f57fe739ee9f","6e2e367b00e65c15fd0d05f7c482ee14ae3a6a3c","0d37c1d215b1ee914279b8128745c5046fbbc03c","069d26bae6555dd90a1f023d257890fca2ba3fc7","d76bbcb8d287b20d55083b5b1ce44416748dc6f9","af72b72a2fba9d948497305fe124a0ef85351694","0d2796b46cb31279106937a52d1cd68012d3f0a3","5e97d7c096ab823aacdb887a5d474dce8aec7438","d72181c0fadd99fac0e7d1e3e50956dae262640f"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.painphysicianjournal.com/current/pdf?article=MTkwNA%3D%3D&journal=75"],"title":"Value-based interventional pain management: a review of medicare national and local coverage determination policies.","doi":"","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"Pain physician"}

In Poaceae, multiple transitions from bisexual to unisexual flowers are hypothesized. There appear to be at least three distinct developmental mechanisms for unisexual flower formation as found in members of three subfamilies (Ehrhartoideae, Panicoideae, Pharoideae). In this study, unisexual flower development is described for the first time in subfamily Chloridoideae, as exemplified by Bouteloua dimorpha. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and anatomy were used to characterize the development of male (staminate) and female (pistillate) flowers, spikelets, and inflorescences. We found the developmental pathway for staminate flowers in B. dimorpha to be distinct from that described in the other three subfamilies, showing gynoecial arrest occurs at a different stage with possible loss of some cellular contents. However, pistillate flowers of B. dimorpha had some similarity to those described in other unisexual-flowered grasses, with filament and anther differentiation in abortive stamens. Comparing our findings with previous reports, unisexual flowers seem to have evolved independently in the four examined grass subfamilies. This analysis suggests the action of different genetic mechanisms, which are consistent with previous observations that floral unisexuality is a homoplasious condition in angiosperms.","inCitations":["1ae601833d266ff6efbe90d1425e8a15c3fb9103","708c7ebd6aa76591ea669f2ad3b37e2f46bc8d6a","94819a6533e1c46a5729cbd901342acc3196e120","7bc0940c31ca71655361d02187d86e9399e3400f","c2f36c0c4b7300a5cc6626ae61a1357629bb4577","443f17285446977e252452f92be636fb83df35ca","59f8857ed4ade64cb2469a2abe8aef1ddb3c09bc","cb853b8c0ff08d6f58fe72392d5b7fcf7a2c5a0f","0feb8e623994d430c22abf95a08f04f97bd65a9c"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Unisexual flower, spikelet, and inflorescence development in monoecious/dioecious Bouteloua dimorpha (Poaceae, Chloridoideae).","doi":"10.3732/ajb.95.2.123","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.3732/ajb.95.2.123","venue":"American journal of botany"}

Central nervous system (CNS) hemorrhage and ischemic events are typically symptomatic. Hemorrhage can occur into the parenchymal, subdural, epidural, or subarachnoid compartments and usually presents with symptoms typical for those sites. Cerebral infarction may cause focal signs, presenting as a transient ischemic attack (TIA) or infarction, or may cause encephalopathy when there are multiple and progressive small infarctions. The most common mechanisms of cerebrovascular disease in cancer patients are related to the presence of CNS tumor, either primary or metastatic, and coagulopathy. The coagulopathy in many instances is a direct effect of the neoplasm; in other cases it develops from cancer treatment. Cancer treatment can also result in blood vessel injury. Radiation therapy directed to the neck or brain can result in vessel stenosis, thrombosis and other vascular pathologies. Chemotherapy and molecularly-targeted agents can lead to vascular injury or thrombosis resulting in hemorrhage or infarction. Infection is a less common cause of stroke. It is important to identify cerebrovascular disease as the cause of neurologic symptoms in the cancer patient in order to determine appropriate evaluation and treatment. This is usually possible by a careful review of the cancer histology and sites of disease, types of antineoplastic therapy administered, and associated comorbidities. Laboratory studies of coagulation function and CNS imaging techniques are useful in identifying the precise etiology of the cerebrovascular disorder. Prompt diagnosis leads to appropriate therapy that, in certain patients, can improve the quality of life and survival as well as prevent additional vascular episodes.","inCitations":["8117aa3f43ec4bac17ac3df1e8a1b3f2ba484ca1","28b401872c89e8a9c1350be3ab46c40b86bda407"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Cerebrovascular Complications of Cancer","doi":"10.1007/978-3-319-57901-6_10","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-57901-6_10","venue":""}
