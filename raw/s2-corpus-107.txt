Among its applications are border control in airports and harbors, access control in laboratories and factories, identification for Automatic Teller Machines and restricted access to police evidence rooms. There have been several implementations of security systems using biometric, especially for identification and verification cases. The term \"biometrics\" is derived from the Greek words bio (life) and metric (to measure). The pattern used in the biometric is the iris pattern in human eye. The iris pattern has been proved unique for each person. A literature review of the most prominent algorithms implemented in each stage is presented. This paper provides a review of major iris I. Introduction Biometric recognition is an emerging technology which employs the physiological and behavioral characteristics to identify an individual. The physiological characteristics include the iris, fingerprint, face and hand geometry. Voice and signature are categorized as the behavioral characteristics. Among these, the human iris is an annular region between the sclera (the white portion of the eye) and the pupil (the darkest portion of the eye). Iris is gaining lots of attention due its unique pattern. The patterns that give uniqueness to the iris are the coronas, furrows, stripes and so on (1). These patterns thus, distinguish the individual as the genuine and the imposter, and make the iris recognition particularly the promising solution. Iris recognition is a method of biometric authentication that uses pattern-recognition techniques based on high resolution images of the irises of an individual's eyes (16). The main stages of an iris recognition system are: image pre-processing which consists of iris localization, iris normalization; iris feature extraction and template matching (13)(15). It is necessary to obtain the iris region to carry out the feature extraction and the matching. Eyelids and the eyelashes that may cover the iris region are detected and removed. The normalization step is the conversion of Cartesian co-ordinates to the polar co-ordinates. Various image enhancement algorithms can also applied in order to compensate the non uniformity and low contrast characters in the iris portion. Feature extraction is the process of extracting texture from the region of interest and then using these features as parameters for comparing two iris templates. The significant features of the iris are obtained for accurate identification purpose. Template matching compares the user template with the templates from the dataset or the trained dataset using a matching metric. The matching metric will give the measure of similarity between two iris templates. This paper discuses the algorithmic implementation in each stage. Iris image capture stage will not be discussed in this paper. The rest of the stages are discussed next sections including image preprocessing, iris feature extraction and template matching.","inCitations":["ff4cee7133291c97480a13908dc773c121f57113"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.iosrjournals.org/iosr-jce/papers/Vol16-issue4/Version-6/E016463538.pdf"],"title":"A Close Approach to Iris Recognition System","doi":"10.9790/0661-16463538","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.9790/0661-16463538","venue":""}

Twenty patients of primary crypto-glandular fistula in ano were selected for the study. Only those patients were included in the study, which had internal opening in posterior midline and limited to superficial post anal space. The cases were diagnosed by clinical examination, MRI fistulogram, biopsy and pus culture. The secondary fistula in ano patients were excluded from the study. The patients were randomly divided in to two groups.  Group A (10 patients) was subjected to the conventional fistulotomy and fistulectomy while group B (10 patients) was subjected to the crypto glandular debridement at posterior midline. After the therapy, patients were followed up for a period of six months for evaluation of healing, recurrence and effect on continence. The most accepted classification of fistula has been Park’s classification. After years of evaluation, it was noticed that complicity of fistula increased with the vertical extension of abscess and based on the findings a new classification of fistula was devised. The management of fistula was planned based on this new classification. The mean duration of treatment in group B was much shorter than of group A. Patients of group B showed significant less time to regain their normal activity on account of much less pain. Overall, patients experienced little or no effect on the continence mechanism in both groups. The recurrence rate was negligible in both groups of patients. The cryptoglandular debridement technique is a better choice in comparison to conventional fistulotomy and fistulectomy as regard to pain, morbidity and duration of healing.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Efficacy of crypto glandular debridement in fistula in ano based on a new classification","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

All studies investigating treatment strategies for EP in at least 2 patients were included in this review.Results: The database search yielded 921 results, and 23 studies comprising over 200 patients with EP were included in the final analysis. Biologics including tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (infliximab [n = 4], etanercept [n = 2], and adalimumab [n = 1]), interleukin-17 inhibitors (secukinumab [n = 3], ixekizumab [n = 2], and brodalumab [n = 1]), ustekinumab (n = 4), and guselkumab (n = 1) have been shown to rapidly achieve clinical improvement in patients with EP. The included studies also demonstrated efficacy of systemic agents cyclosporine (n = 4), etretinate (n = 3), and methotrexate (n = 1).Conclusions: A fair number of poor-quality studies support the use of various biologic and systemic therapies in the treatment of EP.

The present work confirms these data, the ratio of group O to group A renal lithiasis being approximately 3 to 1. In a paper published in 1987, uro-oxalic stones were found to occur preferentially on the left side: 84 on the left and 39 on the right. The present work confirms this notion since in 57 cases, stones were bilateral in 2 cases, on the left in 39 and on the right in 16. Extra corporeal shock wave lithotripsy was performed in 40 of the 57 cases and showed that uro-oxalic stones are more resistant to shock-waves than the other types of stones. They are about as hard as calcium oxalate monohydrate stones or harder in certain cases: A mean of 3,865 shock-waves were required in the 40 cases of the uro-oxalic lithiasis treated with the HM3 Dornier device, while the mean number of shock-waves required for all types of stones in general varies from 2,000 to 2,500. In 4 cases, 5,000 or 6,000 high power shock-waves (7,000 in one session and 9,500 in two sessions) had to be used to obtain a satisfactory result. The calcium oxalate part of these stones is almost always composed of calcium oxalate monohydrate.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"[Uro-oxalic renal lithiasis.

Levels of messenger RNA (mRNA) for pro-inflammatory cytokines have been positively correlated with atherosclerotic disease progression. Therapeutic lipoprotein apheresis (LA) reduces plasma lipid levels and reduces inflammation. We evaluated the effects of LA on expression of mRNA coding for key pro-inflammatory cytokines in patients with dyslipidaemia, homo-/hetero-zygous familial hypercholesterolaemia (HoFH, HeFH) or hyperlipoprotein(a)aemia [hyperLp(a)] and associated coronary artery disease (CAD).\n\n\nAPPROACH\nTen patients (five males and five females, mean age 47 ± 9.2 years) were enrolled, all with HyperLp(a) or confirmed genetic diagnoses of dyslipidaemia, HoFH, or HeFH; all had associated CAD. mRNA determinations were via reverse transcriptase polymer chain reaction (RT-qPCR).\n\n\nRESULTS\nLA was associated with downregulation of mRNA expression for IL-1α, IL-6 and TNF-α, starting after the first LA session. The observed reduction was progressively enhanced during the interval between the first and second LA sessions to achieve a maximum decrease by the end of the second session (IL-1α: -49%, p < 0.001; IL-6: -35%, p < 0.001; TNF-α: -56%, p < 0.001).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nLA suppresses the expression of IL-1α, IL-6 and TNF-α mRNA in patients with dyslipidaemias.

The paper analyzes the level of competition among eight major European airlines and finds little evidence for market power in the industry over that period. One of our main findings is that the high prices in Europe are not entirely due to the bilateral agreements (leading to possible monopoly power), but rather are a result of very high cost structures in the industry. These results are broadly in agreement with those of Roeller and Sickles (1994) which analyzes these issues in the European Industry by estimating a structural, two-stage game. © 1997 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","inCitations":["084b98302d4427d41fe09c2e5c8c066f7dd0c599","5c68eddf1829a333ef91c70b6bce75ee9f00a4a8","46997b361d3bc95e05e17e72d912ee04a9045e7f","c791d0fb4ed0471311b9aa64d0f8495f2f43fae0","351b9029c6cb3438b2ac3088d801991b33bb1f8c","9f1c95ebb05dd0977532345d65fffb1a707d42e0","15165dd85687e965d3eabdd7741970d89ba6d1f9","e08fa5cd37d84292b298e9cc285131cd741c409b","436851b123a1c40d35039a5fda1889aba0854d67","f33aa9a0fcd5b0963aefd471302ff17d631ba7f7","479d8088ffa2eddda2d596420138ee8e82be89af","0ff6460a903ad711d2692ca9fa2b42d0c90721bb","099a3ed1f0ea7c7942ba75eb0ec7e34fdab72ed1","3ef0eda6d9d7a571ba7725855ff4e9fb41d6ab92","d4cfeba3cca91e596e5481a0ee2952fdd9731ee2","ce8e2705d011ccf5ee38936f813e08bef3cbe5d3","fa72061a108ab3a5c957390f16c262fb282f9e19","7f5f73e4984d3e51db639bf0b2cd61137dc24089"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Competition and Market Power in the European Airline Industry: 1976- 90.","doi":"10.1002/(SICI)1099-1468(199705)18:3<209::AID-MDE803>3.0.CO;2-D","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1002/%28SICI%291099-1468%28199705%2918%3A3%3C209%3A%3AAID-MDE803%3E3.0.CO%3B2-D","venue":""}

However, they might provide useful information for predicting cognitive outcome. The current study used three separate patient samples (older adults with mild cognitive impairments, individuals who were HIV+, individuals with Huntington's disease) to examine the relationship between practice effects and cognitive functioning at a later point. Across all three samples, practice effects accounted for as much as 31-83% of the variance in the follow-up cognitive scores, after controlling for baseline cognitive functioning. If these findings can be replicated in other patients with neurodegenerative disorders, clinicians and researchers may be able to develop predictive models to identify the individuals who are most likely to demonstrate continued cognitive decline across time. The ability to utilize practice effects data would add a simple, convenient, and non-invasive marker for monitoring an individual patient's cognitive status. Additionally, this prognostic index could be used to offer interventions to patients who are in the earliest stages of progressive neurodegenerative disorders.","inCitations":["314285bcf43f30f781551e2d66c80ae2b2ee4c9e","bd8bbce1bcb2c612c180fb361628e3a6c53ac3cb","752d8211594f5813935ea3c2b60de854714c1e09","db33705d30e941644bf76edfca0013ea5ef79101","a2cfcf5bd54a41edea4eac01e9cb4827c9b15990","a6c27d34a2de055650b789b9c23f3a3ce6003af0","01c3378587d21459670be63ae88c681955f56ddc","c38262f8cbe26ff1ffb004cd7928e4f4c1706234","d026473df306e4655b252e77fdc27558fe3cdb45","ce1cd83d19307779612b74018dcecda1caa73b70","b7ed70c0dcd507220676054562d84f21c6bbee9c","b4814873269e7b1c97164b3332fc201731bdbbcf","c40e9253e2e2478ca6f72d753baec376df506ae3","d92ccef2ec910520d3838b493d1d5d4ff54970c3","cd68b2b480853295d7414999e24b5f3ac9d6515c","7e5e238d6e4fc10951911209cce2468818d87218","4c9f8f98b7e3f47b5850b978247c870b465745f2","6dea36c40914ff68c4a1aab4f173bede38451339","5d640235e13db398b32145152b3f1d9d7a70e0e2","8f716fccc2890b0d18dba6ea1453531ca470ed76","0a50033371140b9e5d5029a2eb41dff0fa243718","8e9772b986346fd6397376650f6bbb44d8c1e651","ef8c647de85e75e0cbcbf87bdf20e20751dc1317","09d3ad16dbe9a571ca6405710dbfb0d0a68c2599","633855bf1a7b139fd549dc8148c41ddc6bc85a98","e49a32054e069a06a2e4e22228f3804d37f471ac","a29e909f010aacd029b605e857034ea227b55655","8dc502c469dcc694fac584c62ee727df568a05bc","2f4e53047d3d50fce21a0a7f92c950f2e1673c8f","3e810d7562627955955ebc29fbf0b6f1915131cf","a16624c97878a5fd76c6f1cf18cbf0f7692e4f33","95aae9fce7b081088519e0dd566bb2ab7cf074fe","8b1da4a92b61b36fd608a393ec53e703de290384","31d55cdb04d067084a3a08998ce0b784a70d6596","4cd82b514ae6869899fc34f362bcc43d68c4eb63","42e8ccdb01a2138c699d8a404f697f42f250e68f","d4eaa380d3964c8457e63f0167d05fa7b936292f","2eab926a7e45d082388af4052c1b73911151e302","69a21bb2036205477b44b4aa85b325af19a6cc4e","2fcbdac4dc43538323d7fefb4cfa97b583d4d066","e1365eef7089089d3beb0d32a9bb34a399f5798c","7679440e2a82d89d0098518b8af0727057dd7d7e","2bd8581192f14554ef611a1a105baf3da6cd70d4","d509ae321ae0e7e2b98f243c7879938778fd4d46","61217a9d82550ef5f9aea3efa51f2035a009c537","0a82a22ac6ab4a8b583e35a462c8725525b0794b","933df2bbbe4e843c3da3020d51a266761245589f","b04c4d2625041c97762adfca8a118aaf67f53828","e4a1204630213d7ff6dabdd90d98345d26bcc3cc","79bf9e1bbf7b71e51c45ba05e8951adf72b89e2b","54a54f438257f87b25a47431373df871ede83b35","7e0e1459dd8de77518151c27b4cc20b6f62410db","5a568971e05d941a0b92419fd01772cd7336e167","456414c5c1f988d81d700b061239e18ec156bc08","f6c3c3ba1fc35c8e8ff7b5dd17e21f44fbf685a2","86395eb78e84d916f336a4d1b9d18bef9ded91fc","430c9f20a5cd5e37b6b83d97bdfaba023fe9a142","dd4b82113a226da2e9c987f595ed274dd1b697ff","02837fa5510dbb88ddf9e8be667b07af048ec150","94d6cead9e33a5a71cf4cf1a578322e96f4094ed","b486a9e914ba3d59d8090c5016c4a2c78f571407","89ebfa1defed7aabbd612b10185d7d5cb86b3d08","881e1b74e394f05c6a42ed6b5cb6c57848c75d0a","209780a0e648d2c4f620447e0aadb718d5574dfd","5e6a35b09beea4e11ef8fbcdf63b3ee5acd058e0"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Practice effects in the prediction of long-term cognitive outcome in three patient samples: a novel prognostic index.","doi":"10.1016/j.acn.2006.08.013","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.acn.2006.08.013","venue":"Archives of clinical neuropsychology : the official journal of the National Academy of Neuropsychologists"}

(Coleoptera: Bruchidae). Recently developed mathematical models of sperm competition are combined with an empirical investigation of the processes of sperm transfer and storage. During a single insemination virgin males transfer approximately 46000 sperm, 85% more sperm than females can effectively store in their spermathecae. Many of these sperm remain in the bursa copulatrix where they are apparently rapidly degraded and can therefore play no role in fertilization. The spermatheca (primary site of sperm storage) is filled by a single insemination and sperm are lost from this organ at a constant rate. This rate of sperm loss from the spermatheca is insufficient for sperm mixing (without displacement) or sperm stratification to account for the degree of last male sperm precedence measured as P2; the proportion of offspring fathered by the second male to mate reported for this species (P2 = 0.83, when two inseminations are separated by 24 h). Models of sperm displacement correctly predict high levels of sperm precedence although the precision of these predictions is limited because the proportion of sperm entering the spermatheca cannot be accurately determined.

Methods From 1997 to 2001, 120 patients with histopatho-logical confirmed gastric carcinoma were preoperatively staged using the instrument of preliminary - placed mini - probe system. Thirty - two of the total patients were examined by spiral computed tomography with the results to be compared with the histological findings post-operatively. Results The diagnostic accuracy of LFMPS and spiral computed tomography for determination of the T stages, T1 , T2, T3, T4 were 90.0% , 88.5% , 91.5% , 89. 1% and 50.0% ,67.8% ,75.0% ,88.9% respectively. Meanwhile, the accuracy of the N stages, N0, N, , N2 were 88.6% % , 70. 1% , 33. 3% and 62. 5% , 50 . 0% , 75. 0% respectively. Due to the penetration depth of LFMPS is limited, its ability in evaluating the distant metastasis ( M staging) is unfavorable. On the contrary, the ability of detecting M1 by CT scanning reached 75.0%. Conclusion The mini - probe system with low frequency has a high accuracy in assessment of T stage and regional lymph node metastasis of gastric carcinoma, and spiral CT scanning has the superiority in evaluating the distant metastasis and the involvement of surrounding organs. It is suggested to adapt the merits of the two kinds of imaging modality together in the preoperative staging of gastric cancer to improve the accuracy in diagnosis.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Retrospective evaluating low frequency mini-probe endosonography combined with spiral computed tomography in the preoperative staging of gastric carcinoma","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

There are two electron transport pathways in the ETC: Complex I/III/IV, with NADH as the substrate and complex II/III/IV, with succinic acid as the substrate. The electron flow is coupled with the generation of a proton gradient across the inner membrane and the energy accumulated in the proton gradient is used by complex V (ATP synthase) to produce ATP. The first part of this review briefly introduces the structure and function of complexes I‑IV and ATP synthase, including the specific electron transfer process in each complex. Some electrons are directly transferred to O2 to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the ETC. The second part of this review discusses the sites of ROS generation in each ETC complex, including sites IF and IQ in complex I, site IIF in complex II and site IIIQo in complex III, and the physiological and pathological regulation of ROS. As signaling molecules, ROS play an important role in cell proliferation, hypoxia adaptation and cell fate determination, but excessive ROS can cause irreversible cell damage and even cell death. The occurrence and development of a number of diseases are closely related to ROS overproduction. Finally, proton leak and uncoupling proteins (UCPS) are discussed. Proton leak consists of basal proton leak and induced proton leak. Induced proton leak is precisely regulated and induced by UCPs. A total of five UCPs (UCP1‑5) have been identified in mammalian cells. UCP1 mainly plays a role in the maintenance of body temperature in a cold environment through non‑shivering thermogenesis. The core role of UCP2‑5 is to reduce oxidative stress under certain conditions, therefore exerting cytoprotective effects. All diseases involving oxidative stress are associated with UCPs.","inCitations":["d92450e625a8ab26de95888a204d6ed396612712","82b5db0c51df86b40c76246e1e0fc556b9a3d4e6","3b06d2b2ed9872969dbcad8490b1b5554c3a40f9","18e9e4555a3425bc8b6fdb34d0941426bbfa5ab4","63a4a87f6b05a45984568423b5e5bcb13d41365d","afb445c3b13c66869e81d3e2daa50e42c03eab55","c77bb80a907ac2e8312b6ee571abe62be77062bc","80f32979f309b0197ef33f2ea215c88a8d845688","6dddc87ef27dc592e058c46e6bf339bcfc317d30","2a3f96fa03323620839c03c489fd79b38e019c37","89e258448eab18643f16f247f8c71d6ea8ba17d6","08e0cefffd04fd4c1e6418af1451393a3f9e379a","60a6b5c150ea18b00fb273f0b40ee507c8f80edd","4a809d3fe507f5d4b674365e13a71c668816536f","7738a3c21477a99c20c48045a9fb40b4aeb2ff9a","0494a7ecac9dd60bd86ea17a0958196cfa1bd086","4dbca242ca531e890d11d74568f7312f897845d0","9ddebeaa2a8fdec37305aec76590e791906aed8a","04841c17e9c9f411a0bd1ac2c91424d8b64ccb65"],"pdfUrls":["https://spandidos-publications.net/ijmm/44/1/3/download","https://www.spandidos-publications.com/10.3892/ijmm.2019.4188/download"],"title":"Mitochondrial electron transport chain, ROS generation and uncoupling (Review)","doi":"10.3892/ijmm.2019.4188","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.3892/ijmm.2019.4188","venue":"International journal of molecular medicine"}

The simulation results were evaluated against hourly equivalent black carbon (EBC) concentrations obtained in the cities of Seville and Huelva for a winter period (January 2013) and a summer period (June 2013). A large seasonal variability was observed in PM2.5 EBC concentration in the two cities, with higher concentrations in wintertime; summertime EBC concentrations were typically less than half those of the wintertime. The model captured the large diurnal, seasonal and day to day variability in these urban areas, mean biases ranged between −0.14 and 0.07 μg m−3 in winter and between 0.01 and 0.29 μg m−3 in summer while hourly PM2.5 EBC observations ranged between 0.03 μg m−3 to 10.9 μg m−3. The diurnal variation in EBC concentrations was bimodal, with a morning and evening peak. However, the EBC evening peak was much smaller in summer than in winter. The modelling analysis demonstrates that the seasonal and day to day variability in EBC concentration in these urban areas is primarily driven by the variation in meteorological conditions. An evaluation of the role of regional versus local contributions to EBC concentrations indicates that in the medium size city of Seville, local on-road sources are dominant, whereas in the small size city of Huelva, local as well as regional sources produce a similar contribution. Considering the large diesel share of the vehicle fleet in Spain (currently ∼ 56%), we conclude that continued reduction of BC from diesel on-road sources in these urban areas is indeed a priority, and we suggest that targeted mitigation strategies, for example reducing the heaviest emitters in wintertime, would yield the greatest benefits.","inCitations":["7761efae8b02c2847feacf03e5eb263d4698f21b","5b3b83b22afffc2c8999321b46f45f06cf6036db","40f802102742b621e5b9e5b705f141cc7301dca6"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Black Carbon aerosol measurements and simulation in two cities in south-west Spain","doi":"10.1016/j.atmosenv.2015.11.026","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2015.11.026","venue":""}

However, a large body of evidence from animal studies demonstrates that sensitisation of D2-like dopamine receptors in the mesolimbic dopamine system may represent a 'final common pathway' in antidepressant action. The present study aimed to determine whether, consistent with data from animal studies, the clinical antidepressant action of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) is reversed by acute administration of a receptor antagonist selective for D2-like receptors in the mesolimbic dopamine system. The participants were patients diagnosed with major depressive disorder (n = 8) who had been treated successfully (Hamilton Depression Scale < 10) with selective serotonin uptake inhibitors (fluoxetine, citalopram or paroxetine); and age-matched, non-depressed, untreated volunteers (n = 10). They attended a psychiatric research ward on an out-patient basis, and received double-blind acute administration of either placebo, or a low dose of the selective dopamine D2/D3 receptor antagonist sulpiride (200 mg), in a counterbalanced order. Mood and psychomotor effects were assessed using visual analogue scales and the Fawcett-Clark Pleasure Capacity Scale. Sulpiride slightly improved subjective well-being in the control group, but in the antidepressant-treated patients, sulpiride caused a substantial reinstatement of depressed mood. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that sensitisation of D2-like receptors may be central to the clinical action of SSRIs.","inCitations":["59e0c2e3de14b4581154dbe888f338f61eec8cbd","94e3b4a9fceb4515f62167d4f007be5db94ce9e6","2aaac7febec289212be879cdd202687f2ec05df3","4c7cd0e73490fb4dae5e8bdae424f7330c06a03f","a4ad82886dc630065989302a7a1b9c45f52feba6","6cc8e7dd0506778d21202ef21a77a85615f3f222","8ba2ec8bb38b010dc206b85abc30711c290894a8","5091120e27b9d376922a3c83ac4d244bdcd068d6","f08f5765ce945700a1e20411b7f39b7781f0c007","f23698c56227aad84452ece2d818e024cefa90a6","7a89b00b199b9ed524a0287a6e6e9232a1d4c30a","66d4a5a453d8c82d27eea5d1efb67ec69aea64ad","7e3cf09f50ab5540d489b2a51b6fa0e177932c91","42f7af0992dd20311abc62d8a36f9cc96f4ca998","8edcd0df0349736b0489eb1e89875d1b6d722eb5","33db5aacf5a5d30c9f63e3fd4273f37204c9e51c","d0c8cfeb5517f2a71554a9527433a9e4e7563a89","d78d52c4898f56affcf5764a518c0878eae990da","9a679b860648cf65c45f8f8ffff7fde312c27911","f3aec8ee08a3490f9262227d91a3f06b3c8e129b","e3d91aab9ad208867515e6f61da6f6149278e3af","951296423dc0bb58fdb4e5d67f45a0085be7d07d","21136130c3b8d8c61462704df80e37bd5f8c5cab","7853b0c061d3130b5c364e397c9e4ba7bab8556f","4874235679a824bdd1dd244d9b66e1d6c8288c92","698df08e6f0240596647f91c02479e7bdd1611c1","015afa7a56005e1ff63b59772f180b552aee0b93","06e30acd2b25da1abdeb098d654c2668b51aa083","8e649dd0509c976edbbe9c742e23f4f940399dc9","779feaa406a3630f898296a486d14a0b4dc63ebd","dc68bf00673b790fc6631d7819caf941e9f04234","709d3b6e22018538be91054bf2cb5098732dfc08","9230f602226ff57ab372b1422af0288b359c6a47","484f6e49cfda8044a65e79e7bc5ace31b7676bf2","54e3a790127eb40329f9e56b824ddf46661b5541","e7e52fed9ce0e3f52cf5f02a43245822d9f6df51","74588d3c8813aea45073f0576e32c872a126b776","23c3b022f59ca95bf0338acf9a80b732664205fb","f8a2b5c2e889764fec444174282edc37d0a81988","50b0522621e81a0e7086f8460577b49fc03b0181","3959a1fdbebbdb38089a7eabf28baf64519a4ee4","732d6469f94e4c135ce98a77cee844f09765a46f","8125ff9ee2bf50da3cadf861f9ece397f7ea8ebb","c0c8f96a4931cf94bc58383617813c70ee647a2c","30d6830ce6b9f5f93a03aa9359c382fc6cab69a2","6ed214e81774ac5e2edf7e89afa398c05ff52e60","e58fba0f2460471dda89465558ba4922311adbe4","554ede4b3065d1ac3712b91f4abf03089d4d225c","7d44386c13149a19ac9b0ffb54694253f038ba2a","bab051ba2a7027f15204e2e326f8dbeed8ff88a9","927655b9aaa0595495978b0fca159b474b7d1708","7f8982745dcd122f389ec19b426eecda7ee4978c","882df63036c64f685ec5a68c1fa97695fdddb786","3228fb5bbd1bc0fe857e6bbd34815b2d2a3030a5","9187a0d9b91ecb8b2d65f48d485c712724c0650f","cfe59a5788f93bc922ae616c3f2c210f573f1b87","98080c9db6aee5098c39d2b2186130599175d0a2","09a48563380d7e7232796ebe89475aae0ad9b787","a8d18957f85d81ec70066f9f1ad895d9d5c32a7a","26dbdd9c31fb38210eaa4d08419fd72965e98893","9f8d70e735acb7a7ecb61f57a376eba57237de05","17c6a6b1d73c7e5629b777e68ef390c4d9ae50ff","26c2fe844d952f55095056e4a524eadd5c0b01a8","64791067d23445f8f0c277921b021a95e3b62a4f","d32951dc3261d09deffa81a2468ed8efc7736d32","97d4ac14d4060bfd724ef1202d322c67e534e263","6a8de8628291ed36dd2971fd32b708a0363963cb","1e2c3b4e3913086205474b02fb602402f849ff55","62c5127ca4dcad560026a4d90a79baa2f48176eb","de3d505f435a63bb385cb533ad8400f65f174734","8369e6802065f8ed7381586a3b20b8479083f7fd","75e0b0d05e1b199a3b3eee81fad0912198e2b378","067cd02e7ec822c6e963c6ae76f82015b4367026","e67a22992888d227044320217ab65a86dfcb936b","01c17d9e4d9a1c145f58ef37dd2819d6a2f29e60","6799cb2d13b21b090c8faf66cf826293e44534db","fde9c0f6c76f10b7217e19d8ac4aeba5b253cdce","f92643ee351de9af0968be4806c24621d484d82f","b4e105303b480f6c57906d8cf55dd4335fb3ea57","d94962fc207bee222ca7ff1dce896808445c6492","e7e42f0c6b0326cf33cae169a1c2948df6dd4050","c0b68784699298ca94f3469a836308a99e102a3c","b385bd64fbce2b23e45f7ed4e50ceb00ad1c9ad7","d408c85abae4bef08c3b6e8d0fca958b582a769d","43952577faf7c18772706e6128f5463bcd917d56","e4f75f7ff244a96d78ca9e6a6f141e8d5dd1520f","60f4d398cd6e1490457bda5cf7a4164da06972cd","f186c53ae895b2d1a98ebd7eba2518f40a095311","51c548d50a96e467fe53d0e45b999e7aab2458c5","12248d9ac8cda380d821abd23f7afedc50d9ae30","db3875e1fe9f48644177383b4c40e1afe81d36b5","ef8b91d135780db318160584bd1a29c7ca454ae2","dbbd8013026e7dc62a18d06e96b95fcb5c05f927","f8fdaae86e2a2e27cc7a578fa97f352c200c4805","c89389f093837b261b3d5ad405a3415461e0c364"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Dopaminergic mechanism of antidepressant action in depressed patients.","doi":"10.1016/j.jad.2004.12.010","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2004.12.010","venue":"Journal of affective disorders"}

In this paper we describe the requirements to achieve anodisation using a field-induced process which involves forward-biasing a p-n junction to make an n-type silicon wafer surface anodic. Although potentially very large currents can be achieved using this method, it is shown that the anodisation current is practically limited by the resistances in the electrochemical circuit. Furthermore, depletion regions can form at both surfaces when the wafer is under forward-bias. This can be addressed by either ensuring that the surfaces are sufficiently-doped for ohmic contact or by using light to generate a photocurrent in the depletion regions of the wafer.","inCitations":["eebeb3aa607dcefa7cd8c796a3f28eacd10d3ff3"],"pdfUrls":["https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82378414.pdf"],"title":"Requirements to Achieve Field-Induced Anodisation for Silicon Surface Passivation","doi":"10.1016/j.egypro.2014.08.069","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.egypro.2014.08.069","venue":""}

It remains unclear whether antibiotic prophylaxis reduces bacterial invasion of the necroses or septic complications. It was, therefore, the aim of this study to evaluate the effect of prophylactic administration of antibiotics to patients with ANP.\n\n\nPATIENTS AND METHODS\nIn a prospective randomized study 13 patients with ANP and sterile necroses (quantified by contrast-enhanced computed tomography) were given twice daily 200 mg ofloxacin and twice daily 500 mg metronidazole intravenously. The results were compared to those in a control group of patients with ANP (n = 13) who had not initially received antibiotics. In both patient groups fine-needle biopsies of the necrotic areas were performed on days 1, 3, 5, 7 and 10. If there was evidence of infection, antibiotics were then also given to patients of the control group.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe extent of the necroses was the same, 40%, in both groups. These necroses became infected in a median of 9.5 (treated group) and 10 days (untreated group). The clinical course, documented by the APACHE II score, showed significant improvement under antibiotic treatment (days 1-5-10: scores 15-13.0-9.5). In the (initially untreated) control group the clinical condition deteriorated significantly (days 1-5-10: score 11.5-15.0-16.0). The changes from days 1 to 5, 5 to 10 and 1 to 10 were highly significant (Wilcoxon test, P < 0.01). None of the patients in the antibiotic group died within the first 3 weeks, but 2 of the 13 in the control group died.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nAntibiotic prophylaxis neither prevented nor delayed bacterial infection of the necrotic pancreas. But it significantly improved the clinical course if started before the onset of infection of the pancreatic necroses.","inCitations":["3482d112b39fb6c5063f2525b27ae50b4ecd28c4","45224c182543152fa4ee5172b25c95740e7e2150","cd9f462c798b4c5698a17305e399565810f63e18","112353fec144a0c26bfb633cbd0fea01630ab5a7","ab8739cb66f2bcea037692a8ada23642b16b6a5b","f700cf92127807a29fc9b7260951b962bd49e2c4","565dab1026c24c93dc8c27bc65279f781d9dcf8c","d79d8166de0dd6c5b167cda1b0105796a65f24da","da598faf3fe211879a934fc16c5cca3f53bbf564","fa2b56da7d62667e5b09590f18fde33114487e08","3e4234245d913d37d16a52bddf74672a425cfb3c","ebc4fe31785690b1e4d2b1e07c84207f4c6fb6dc","ff45e55d49d0ab2cc646f1cdbc063300afad2b12","69d637fa26ff3c18f3b9dba0457be56119a7db16","dae53d929ff52cf1ccbe2959d1c725947c7f24b7","3f7cdcda515b9f30c68ecf07505c75c16adef348","aa17d295cf5e787bc7a6060690288c7cd2246d71","a957e0842193e0b064750cf1a038a0a884fdcee9","5c7eab17dd0d6ccffd22fe4bb61a6836b92e7cd6","adadbcdef77ac5a06d00d1346b3e765c09e5d351","106b42cafe76b7ee524698d8a1f181cd8d01ed04","9da4402a2da3575c46a5e6382ec533d65966815f","6e4e2c3a4e75bcb18436a8cdd040072259dd0ee7","43978a196afd5898269b0103902b029c2ce9eaa3","aaf6e925d30bef46eb295a7cbdbc55394100d8a6","767b7966d5f232af2ff63ae6d93e7ef731873377","5e38a51ab81ee0b91b1a3aa81a6a023f709364f2","c1a14bc1d7d797acf4c82fa3527bf43b381e44ee","135efe143eb27e2b78f573b1f1750e3edb64c0ae","70ee470753399be7b2ebb0bf5c9b2a137090c4c2","2d78d9c6bb99ed6d0b4e31dac7bae58d8273050f","1c72297841ef94836a910eb2047f11c7fd3cf4cc","14e884d8985952c5917a7db0c2d79939d4b74183","77a46008c99edb365c3c0680ce8407248bea4d92","fba172c8c8464fec7ea8004c7735472913520462","51d39edf4416cff4f6e65c1aaad9e9f84e9422e7","011786d0ce54c98d61fd62e972ea941e9f6c3632","c52e97efcf3483a572334ba41617e0503e1ea6b1","2ee8accacf646fa1df2ea0c974cd708910b2832c","c718983b0ae14f6faf63e731c4db0ab860dea663","6522414deb4c419ff40b4df195fa707e68c02965","6924d800107986495e004513b78b4debb22fc3a9","be7d2b275b33489dcd1c2043f9d50c8e66700e21","de9c1390bac1df54f4ee94f60872310e5c7f5126","d84a7c1655cbe1f971c40ec5f7eb4d3239b8ceb1","3eac7f6d16521fa985425ac09ccadb79919fd0b4","aa53202c8b3b8397f81700c8546cc4952fc55a0b","ba2c45f243e0cc92f3a72c8f5c5afdfe88fb86a8","b93d9a371572d25343cb7dbd80eb2be3cffd1098","d7fcf1eaced16d5e85024c30b78242b1bfa34939","145341abf4b380d76a6f2a447cf431fc0613ccf4","0e24ab69794f045deb6e51baf7a5c5c4e0504f33","8256dc3daa3b184b79cb9356c2f09848c55a0974","fc0510c1fcd4c881eea254b4f7f5a00c224cf155","46a592f408fb2c196e2325fe5489c1d4f6a4a117","c95253c382c78e51abca7442fff36c1065cb20b8","611812ff6dae400dda4c90ad3720f73cf10c1442","b6e88b0f74b7296dcd817e67d5d2f3233d5aff4d","003ce61b00b8194def6b5768f4e3e4d6e8b53ac7","00a93aa8f0f1e762af4e6ee8788fd7e1bac4b6b1","59aaa52ff66a7066695cac17177b5211813238ae","b23762466e807d11c65fef6aa3798656f80408d2","93bef7ff951500ad7da51737fff7de53852f15a7","d5749f116a0daccc8e5a5775bacdf992162fecdb","a179120eedd5e4e436e97da66de6b0b2983a950e","9d2e6810140251851ea4bef265cf9f749812788c","f426fcdf11ede45c3421c7547f6dd66ecae0af74","87690fb1f6b858eac2bbf3df397d82fedd7943bf","e930839b71c33cd04f45c8b64484e50af38fd11d","c8e3078a7dcde50e14def51f7c1e283aa6df7219","890060040fbee8c6247237ca4f8359daacd43c55","7f40efdf11b63b4668b3bfc61063fe494c83157a","9085452ae8d1faa6d0dc388bfe9e1c2a1a64353b","b43167f98933047d263611ebe605db696a6ad55d","1906b5722e1a7f864cd860c6e8660c81cc9f8d06","8badf536cc194f7b774e8d5e4a5d11ad03c9d2fc"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"[Antibiotic use in necrotizing pancreatitis.

Firstly, the extract was prepared by solvent extraction using 95% ethanol. Then, the phenolics in the extract were analyzed by instrumental analysis. The total phenolic content in the PLE was found to be 14.51 mg gallic acid equivalent (GAE)/g dry weight (DW). The amount of caffeic acid, ferulic acid, rosmarinic acid, quercetin, and apigenin, determined by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), was 4.80, 5.10, 2.95, 6.46, and 3.93 mg/g DW, respectively. Furthermore, the PLE was found to show high free radical scavenging activity toward DPPH and ABTS radicals with IC50 values of 12.15 and 7.26 μg/ml, respectively. When PLE was fortified into surimi fish balls at 0.03% and stored at 4°C, it was found to slow down lipid and protein oxidation during storage of surimi fish balls as evidenced by the significant reduction in TBARS values and protein carbonyl contents (p < 0.05). PLE (0.03%) also decreased the formation of total volatile basic nitrogen (TVB-N) and inhibited the growth of E. coli compared with the control group (p < 0.05).

It is also recognized that sympathetic nerve-mediated contractions of the vas deferens can be modulated by acetylcholine (Ach), however there is considerable disagreement in the literature regarding the precise contribution of cholinergic nerves to contraction of the vas deferens. In this study we examined the effect of cholinergic modulators on electric field stimulation (EFS)-evoked contractions of rabbit vas deferens and on cytosolic Ca(2+) levels in isolated vas deferens smooth muscle cells (VDSMC). The sustained component of EFS-evoked contractions was inhibited by atropine and by the selective M3R antagonist, 1,1-dimethyl-4-diphenylacetoxypiperidinium iodide (4-DAMP). EFS-evoked contractions were potentiated by Ach, carbachol (Cch), and neostigmine. The sustained phase of the EFS-evoked contraction was inhibited by prazosin, an α1-adrenoceptor antagonist and guanethidine, an inhibitor of noradrenaline release, even in the continued presence of Ach, Cch or neostigmine. The soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) inhibitor, 1H-[1,2,4]Oxadiazolo[4,3-a]quinoxalin-1-one enhanced the amplitude of EFS-evoked contractions and reduced the inhibitory effects of 4-DAMP. Isolated VDSMC displayed spontaneous Ca(2+) oscillations, but did not respond to Cch. However, the α1-adrenoceptor agonist, phenylephrine, evoked a Ca(2+) transient and contracted the cells. These data suggest that EFS-evoked contractions of the rabbit vas deferens are potentiated by activation of M3 receptors and reduced by activation of a sGC-dependent inhibitory pathway.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://physreports.physiology.org/content/physreports/3/9/e12520.full.pdf"],"title":"Regulation of nerve-evoked contractions of rabbit vas deferens by acetylcholine","doi":"10.14814/phy2.12520","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.14814/phy2.12520","venue":"Physiological reports"}

Many type of speed controller techniques have been developed and Proportional Integral Derivative (PID) controller has been the most widely used. However, PID’s performance deteriorates during nonlinear loads conditions. Over the past five years, controllers have been developed to overcome this limitations in BLDC speed control, however the solutions are focusing on forward motoring only. In this paper, a speed controller for BLDC with seamless speed reversal using Modified Fuzzy Gain Scheduling is proposed. The proposed controller regulates the speed using Fuzzy Gain Scheduling 49 base rules. The controller was tested for six test cases and compared to PID and Self-Tuning Fuzzy PID controller. It is found out the proposed controller yields lowest steady state error, e ss of 0.025 % during step-changing speed test case. Overall, Modified Fuzzy Gain Scheduling BLDC speed controller outperforms the other two similar controllers in variable speed conditions. The controller has potential to be used as bidirectional drive in highly dynamic load conditions.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://jurnalteknologi.utm.my/index.php/jurnalteknologi/article/download/11199/6348"],"title":"Speed Control of Bldc Motor with Seamless Speed Reversal Capability Using Modified Fuzzy Gain Scheduling","doi":"10.11113/jt.v80.11199","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.11113/jt.v80.11199","venue":""}

Leakage into the subsoil from underground pipes may cause environmental problems, but it is very difficult to locate the leak area in underground pipes. The development of radioactive techniques has greatly facilitated the detection of underground pipe leakages. The use of radioactive tracers affords an extremely sensitive means of measurement and permits the detection of tracers in low concentrations. The radiotracer method discussed in this paper was applied to five 6- to 12-in.-i.d., 70-m-long underground pipes that collect the water and/or oil from a large petrochemical processing plant in Taiwan. Bromine-82 was chosen as the tracer for this experiment because it emits gamma rays, can be prepared easily, and has a convenient half-life. The underground pipe was filled with an ammonium [sup 82]Br aqueous solution, and the system was kept closed for 2 to 3 h to ensure the free flow of the radiotracer through leak areas into the surrounding soil.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"The application of radiotracers in the leak detection of underground pipes","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

O engenheiro agronomo e um profissional que pode atuar na area de silvicultura, sementes, fitossanidade, cultivo de Horticolas, Fruticultura, cultivo de grandes culturas, implementos agricolas, solos, dentre outras. Tem aumentado consideravelmente o numero de mulheres que cursam Agronomia e as profissionais estao competindo diretamente com os homens no mercado de trabalho e isso tem causado impacto na sociedade, pois Agronomia e considerada por muitos, uma profissao para homens. De acordo com o exposto, buscou-se atraves de entrevistas na comunidade universitaria do Campus Itaqui/UNIPAMPA, mais especificamente com: academicos do curso de Agronomia, engenheiros agronomos e profissionais de outras areas, reconhecer e analisar as visoes sobre o profissional engenheiro agronomo. As entrevistas foram direcionadas para tres questionamentos: qual a area de atuacao do profissional engenheiro agronomo, o que representa a Agronomia para voce e o papel da mulher na Agronomia. As entrevistas foram gravadas e apresentadas durante palestra ministrada por integrantes do PET Agronomia, na V Semana Academica da Agronomia. Para a entrevista sobre a area de atuacao do engenheiro agronomo, observou-se que os profissionais de outras areas desconhecem alguns ramos e que a principal atividade seria cuidar das plantas e do solo, no entanto tratando-se dos direcionados a area as respostas se tornaram mais completas, tendo uma visao mais ampla da profissao. Para a entrevista sobre o que representa a agronomia para voce, os entrevistados destacaram em sua maioria a importância desta carreira para a producao de alimentos e a responsabilidade destes com o ambienta. Para a entrevista sobre a mulher na Agronomia pode-se observar que a comunidade universitaria do Campus Itaqui nao demonstrou preconceito, bem pelo contrario, deixou a mensagem de que existe espaco para as mulheres e que em determinadas areas podem ser mais produtivas que os homens. Portanto, a comunidade universitaria do Campus Itaqui, possui visoes diferentes sobre a atuacao e o perfil do profissional engenheiro agronomo, mas existe unanimidade quanto ao reconhecimento da atuacao da mulher como profissional na Agronomia.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Profissão Engenheiro Agrônomo - Visões da comunidade universitária do Campus Itaqui da UNIPAMPA","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}
