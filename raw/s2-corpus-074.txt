The total estimated 20-year need for drinking water is $384.2 billion (EPA 2013), creating urgency among utilities to utilize the best financial management practices for reaching funding goals. There are approximately 813 community water systems in the state of Indiana; 69% are municipally owned, 17% are nonprofits, and 11% are private investor owned. Much of the debate over which utility ownership type can provide the best financial performance will need to be done on a case by case basis, since conditions are not one size fits all, and vary greatly even across Indiana. Examining financial differences among Indiana drinking water utilities, however, may provide insight into which ownership group utilizes the most beneficial practices. There are several measures that can be used when analyzing drinking water utilities. Financial performance indicators can be used to measure the overall financial condition of utilities. The indicators include the current ratio and debt-to-capital ratio, which measure the ability to pay off debt, and total debt in relation to invested capital, respectively. Measures of profitability, such as return on equity, can be used to determine the ability to turn capital into profitable investments. These indicators are beneficial when analyzing drinking water utilities, and their ability to function sustainably while continuing to provide for future generations. Research utilizing annual financial reports should highlight differences in financial characteristics between the three main utility ownership groups. Any differences discovered will prove insightful by helping to recognizing strengths and weaknesses of any one group, and might provide potential new areas of research aimed at furthering and explaining the findings, including collaboration via project delivery methods such as Public Private Partnerships (PPP).","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://research.iupui.edu/events/researchday2014/documents/a30.pdf"],"title":"An Analysis of Financial Performance Indicators based on Three Types of Water Utility Ownership in the State of Indiana","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

However, if the three principal countries of this continent intend to deepen the ties that have brought them together under the North American Free Trade Agreement, they will need to navigate the process of further international accords, both in terms of treaties and negotiated changes to domestic laws. An important but overlooked feature of this process is the fact that each of the three countries has a federal system different from that of the others in terms of relative overall institutional strength and degrees of centralization and decentralization. Like the European Union (particularly in relation to the German federal system and the principle of subsidiarity), the North American countries will need to take federalism into account when negotiating and implementing any future legal agreements and institutions among themselves. A strongly centralized federal system with a weak institutional presence can facilitate the negotiation and imposition of new legal arrangements that will provide for further economic and political cooperation. However, a more strongly decentralized system with a strong overall institutional presence (resembling the Canadian model) could potentially provide the impetus for more effective implementation of these legal agreements as well as foster a greater sense of acceptance and involvement in a broader North American community among regions and local communities.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://nemvat.com/1554216915.pdf"],"title":"Ensayos North American Federalism And Its Legal Implications El federalismo en América del Norte y sus implicaciones legales","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

This restructuring process called \"bone remodeling\" is important not only for normal bone mass and strength, but also for mineral homeostasis. Bone remodeling is stringently regulated by communication between bone component cells such as osteoclasts, osteoblasts and osteocytes. An imbalance of this process is often linked to various bone diseases. During bone remodeling, resorption by osteoclasts precedes bone formation by osteoblasts. Based on the osteocyte location within the bone matrix and the cellular morphology, it is proposed that osteocytes potentially contribute to the controls of bone remodeling. Thus, the elucidation of the regulatory mechanisms involved in bone remodeling is critical for a deeper understanding of the skeletal system in health and disease.","inCitations":["828c4ac73e2488c72023235ffcfc0632b9fa72ef","62c5255942fb0f9cd29df1eb8b3761da2204c7f2","3a855e19c1ef6ac83d80c68e1623a41e9dfe1206","eb785183c85e64a9b92bb136585fde8b60ccd8a4","f2bbbdcb58a7431627eb09c9f8b77e44de68cd23"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"[Regulation of bone homeostasis by bone cells].","doi":"","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"Clinical calcium"}

Although the body weight of the dams treated with FLUT remained normal, two dams in the 10 mg/kg/day group were killed because of abnormal parturition periods and loss of all the pups. The number of stillborns and dead newborns at birth was significantly higher in the 10 mg/kg/day group than in the control groups. No abnormalities in the reproductive parameters of the other dams treated with FLUT were detected. The body weights of the male offspring in each group remained normal from birth until the end of the study. The ano-genital distance was significantly shortened in 2 and 10 mg/kg/day groups. Changes in the organ weights and gross findings were detected in the 2 and/or 10 mg/kg/day groups with or without the continuous administration of FLUT after weaning; these changes were more appreciable in groups treated with FLUT after weaning than in groups untreated after weaning. The prolongation of preputial separation was observed in the 0.4 and 2 mg/kg/day groups treated with FLUT after weaning, but this change was not detected in the same dose groups untreated after weaning. The testosterone levels were higher in the 10 mg/kg/day group treated with FLUT after weaning.

Such deficiencies of the single-core frameworks have led to the introduction multi-core frameworks to meet the required performance of their functionalities. However, in order to obtain good performance for CVS on multi-core frameworks, it is crucial to utilise parallelism tools efficiently. These parallelism tools need to be utilised on hotspots (most time-consuming functions in algorithm) in order to minimise development time and to reduce application development costs. This is a challenging task and requires an in-depth investigation of multi-core frameworks. This research work investigates the utilisations of multi-core frameworks capability for a real-time object tracking application problem using a parallel software tool known as Intel© Parallel Studio XE tool. In the investigation, two established multi-core frameworks, namely, Threading Building Blocks (TBB) and Open Multi-Processing (OpenMP) were implemented at identified hotspot functions of the tracking algorithm. The performances of these two multi-core frameworks were then evaluated and compared based on computed speedup, efficiency and scalability. The results from this investigation demonstrated that the processing time of real-time object tracking was improved by using hotspots identification. In addition to that, multi-core frameworks could make the tracking algorithm explicitly faster when compared to single-core frameworks and OpenMP outperformed TBB.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://www.jatit.org/volumes/Vol70No1/20Vol70No1.pdf"],"title":"Multi-core Frameworks Investigation on a Real-time Object Tracking Application","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Analysis shows that the students' selection is mainly influenced by list of factors which we categorized them into three groups of concern: course factors, social factors, and individual factors. This paper proposed a two-phased model where the most correlated courses are generated and prioritized based on the student preferences. At this end, we have applied the multi-criteria analytic hierarchy process (MC-AHP) in order to generate the optimum set of courses from the available courses pool. To validate the model, we applied it to the data from students of the Information System Department at Taibah University, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.","inCitations":["04b22fe14fc497dc5275fa25c6d0d9892c27b2e7","1ca4860b79250921b1ee8d3ac9dc07e5fdd6e5bd"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Solving Course Selection Problem by a Combination of Correlation Analysis and Analytic Hierarchy Process","doi":"10.11591/ijece.v7i6.pp3536-3551","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.11591/ijece.v7i6.pp3536-3551","venue":""}

We examined electronic health records (EHR) for patients of Geisinger Clinic who had prescription benefits through Geisinger Health Plan. \n \nMethods: Prescriptions in the EHR were defined as filled if a claim was paid within 90 days. We used logistic regression to test if a patient’s filling rate (FR) was associated with gender, age, economic status (measured as median household income by ZIP code) and number of vascular comorbidities (angina, MI, PVD, stroke). We then tested whether a higher categorical FR (0, 1–33, 33–67, 67–99 or 100%) resulted in a greater percent of office visits with blood pressure (BP) controlled to JNC7 standards (%BPc). \n \nResults: All results are reported as Adjusted Odds Ratios (AOR) [95% CI]. Among 20,161 patients who met JNC7 criteria for HTN and had >3 AHM Rxs during plan enrollment from 2002 to 2006, 99% were Caucasian and 53% were female with a mean age of 58.5 years (SD 15.8). Of 191,120 AHM Rxs (mean per patient 9.5, SD 6.5), 49%, 59% and 62% were filled within 30, 60 and 90 days. Based on a 90-day FR, 14.7% of patients filled no Rxs and 36.2% filled all. Factors negatively associated with FR were female gender (AOR 0.89 [CI 0.870.90]), increasing age (nonlinear, 0.30 [0.290.30] for age 60–80 years vs. age 40–60 years), and number of vascular comorbidities (nonlinear, 0.79 [0.770.81] for 1 vs. 0 comorbidities, 0.66 [0.610.71] for 2 vs. 0 comorbidities). Higher economic status was positively associated with FR (1.05 [1.031.07] per $10k estimated annual income). In 19,500 patients who had >3 office visits, the mean number of BP readings per patient was 19.6 (SD 10.6), and 60% of readings were under control. After adjusting for the factors above and baseline blood pressures, there was a positive nonlinear association between FR and %BPc (1.08 [1.06–1.13] for 33–67% vs. 0% FR, 1.09 [1.08–1.16] for 67–99% vs. 0% FR, and 1.34 [1.07–1.46] for 100% vs. 0% FR). Results were similar if we excluded patients with 0% FR who may have used alternate insurance for Rxs. \n \nConclusions: These findings suggest that prescription filling differs by gender, age and comorbidity status and that higher Rx filling rates are associated with better BP control.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"PS1-11: Differences in Prescription Adherence vs. Blood Pressure Control: Linking Electronic Health Record and Claims Data","doi":"10.3121/cmr.8.1.42","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.3121/cmr.8.1.42","venue":""}

Four types of soils were spectrally characterized in terms of unique bands of soil contents and interferences with nitrate bands in the range of 2000-1000 cm -1 . In order to reduce the effects of soil composition on calibration model for nitrate, spectra transformed to the 1st order derivatives were used in the partial least squared regression (PLSR) model and the classification procedure associated with input soil types was involved in calibration system. PLSR calibration models for each soil type provided better performance results (R 2 >0.95, RPD>6.0) than the model considering just one type of soil as a standard.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Direct Determination of Soil Nitrate Using Diffuse Reflectance Fourier Transform Spectroscopy (DRIFTS)","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Although it is generally known that there are technical benefits for utilities and industrial customers to provide local reactive power support, a thorough quantitative investigation of the economic benefit is greatly needed. This paper seeks to provide a quantitative approach to evaluate the benefits from local reactive power compensation. This paper investigates the benefits including reduced losses, shifting reactive power flow to real power flow, and increased transfer capability. These benefits are illustrated with a simple two-bus model and then presented with a more complicated model using optimal power flow. Tests are conducted on a system with seven buses in two areas. These simulations show that the economic benefits can be significant, if compared with capacity payment to central generators or power factor penalties applied to utilities. This economic value may give utilities a better understanding of the Var benefits to assist their cost-benefit analysis for Var compensation. In addition, since the economic benefits are significant, this paper suggests that the future reactive power market should consider local Var providers","inCitations":["4a6bec7eb428c6455f3a64f80fcdfdeb5bf587cf","569ac307802b5db1463a1d8c50cfa3a44d772b28","06d8d74df5059cb42ae619fd92650206cfabc9d8","c815cfa4c2f191ff1a2f7d86a7d28697aab385ac","155b6f4c61fa3a7e357e62c05311976ae59fb0c9","7881b8760867074c3033fe4e9c5e34bdebba7af6","683b3de97f0221d1a4f56d63f4d32daeff3d63a5","4a6edfcee4948d5bcaa3fa86f5f843c8212d4f58","398c6906d6f746d5b5f2731865cdb94737058f1b","55033f12f5dda6aecb14bca7b9a52a69e6dec276"],"pdfUrls":["http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~tolbert/publications/psce_2006.pdf"],"title":"Assessment of the Economic Benefits from Reactive Power Compensation","doi":"10.1109/PSCE.2006.296180","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PSCE.2006.296180","venue":"2006 IEEE PES Power Systems Conference and Exposition"}

Anche sul piano organizzativo, lo studio rileva i numerosi indizi di mutamento della responsabilita amministrativa in funzione della doverosita di una relazione piu personale, di un’attenzione ai singoli casi, che fa emergere meglio non solo il reale assetto di interessi su cui intervenire, ma soprattutto i bisogni in gioco, compreso quello pubblico; esamina le evoluzioni in tema di selezione e preposizione dei dirigenti pubblici, e la crescente attenzione alle loro qualita personali, e considera il rilievo del «buon andamento» come affidabilita, mediante il ruolo giuridico del risultato nell’amministrazione pubblica, osservando la moltiplicazione degli strumenti volti a fornire affidabilita all’azione amministrativa. Il lavoro prova poi a proporre gli argomenti che consentono di ritenere il provvedimento amministrativo come decisione ragionevole e, dunque, personalista, scorgendovi una «ragionevolezza in senso personale», in cui l’elemento personale diviene dirimente per la validita delle decisioni amministrative Infine, i dati rilevati consentono la definizione di qualche implicazione per la democrazia matura, nella quale l'utilizzo esteso del principio personalista costituisce limiti e fa sorgere responsabilita; la dialettica interpersonale che si instaura in vista di una decisione amministrativa, ed il regime giuridico assunto dall'atto che la esprime, possono costituire una delle «forme» con cui si esercita la sovranita popolare. The paper investigates the effects of the «personalist» constitutional principle in Administrative Law, observing first and foremost the personalistic parable of the Administrative Measure, which, intended in the past as an imperative, authoritative decision, increasingly appears to assume the structure of an unilateral legal act, and the changes in the treatment of Public Interest, which is inevitably conceived in collective and therefore, at first, impersonal terms, but must be treated, because it is that, as personal, as individual like any other interest; and draws arguments to discuss the habit to define the Administrative Decision, as a legal act, a matter of Power . Also on the organizational level, the study identifies many clues of change in Administrative Responsibility, as a result of the need for a more personal relationship, with a focus on individual cases, which better illustrates not only the actual set of interests, but especially the needs involved, including the public one; it examines evolutions on the selection and preposition of public managers, and the increasing attention to their personal qualities, and considers the importance of «good performance» as accountability through the legal role of the results in public administration. The paper then tries to propose arguments that allow to consider the Administrative Measure as a reasonable and thus personal decision, recognizing a «reasonableness in a personal sense», in which the personal element becomes diriment for the validity of administrative decisions. Lastly, the data obtained allow the definition of some implications for mature Democracy, in which the extensive use of the personalist principle constitutes limits and induces responsibilities; the interpersonal dialectic that arises in view of an administrative decision, and the legal regime assumed by the act expressing it, can constitute one of the «forms» with which popular sovereignty is exercised.

Comparatively, The Organic Rankine cycle (ORC) offers a good solution to utilize low-medium quality waste heat from marine engine. In this paper, an operational profile based thermal-economic evaluation model is established providing reliable evaluation on Organic Rankine cycle used for waste heat utilization from marine diesel engines. Base on this model, ORC system is proposed and designed based on the ship’s most typical operational condition. The effect of ship’s operating condition on ORC thermodynamic performance among seven working fluid candidates is analyzed. Thermal-economic analysis is presented with increasing attention to the ship’s operational profile based on the measurement data from 4-week navigation of objective passenger cruise ship. The result indicates that: considering the different thermodynamic properties, R123 is capable of outputting power at heavy load of engine, while R365mfc is more suitable at light load of engine. Taking typical operational profile into consideration, R123 suits better when ORC is designed for container ships, while R365mfc is suggested for bulk carrier and tankers. For the investigated case study, compared with estimation using nominal design output power, the electricity production cost EPC increased by around 36–41% when operational profile is included. Nominally, all working fluid candidates can satisfy 5-year payback limit except RC318. However, only R123, R365mfc and R245ca are feasible when operational profile is considered. This result makes clear that real operational profile is indispensable for assessing the feasibility of technology.","inCitations":["1bb89d1fbf66c983b29e5680ea726d20b43966d6","486c9a199a350b8c0a7f873c7fc1a6c382fe8645","4b02b875236e4674bb46264ab989cee984f43473","a09a589c6921b2de0f94d574b556926854dc7a33","f6dff3938771e37758f364e0c4f06ec30ec03695","ae91ee2c7c1d58c94e3836961f53726dfb5c3eec","ee626036fe02acb56e93374732c918c5cebddd19"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Operational profile based thermal-economic analysis on an Organic Rankine cycle using for harvesting marine engine’s exhaust waste heat","doi":"10.1016/j.enconman.2017.04.099","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2017.04.099","venue":""}

Material and Methods: A screening process using the osmotic fragility (OF) test, the old cutoff values of mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) at <80 fL and <22 pg, and the new cutoff values at <87 fL and <29 pg was performed in 300 HIV infected patients. After which, a genetic study was performed to detect common α thalassemia 1 genes deletions composed of Southeast Asian and THAI deletions and also for hemoglobin constant spring and hemoglobin Pakse mutations for α thalassemia 2 carriers. Screening efficiency was estimated by sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV). Results: Sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV of the original regimen for thalassemia screening in HIV infected patients were at 50.0%, 95.0%, 39.0% and 96.8%, respectively, demonstrating a high false positivity in HIV-1 infected populations. Therefore, new cutoff values for MCV and MCH were proposed at <87 fL and <29 pg, due to the highest value found in α thalassemia 1 carriers with HIV-1 infection. These new cutoff values showed higher sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV at 100.0 92.6%, 46.2%, and 100.0%, respectively, and thus enhanced thalassemia screening efficiency in HIV-1 infected patients. Conclusion: Incorporation of the OF test and the new cutoff values for MCV and MCH improve the efficiencies of α thalassemia 1 screening in HIV-1 infected patients. This helps reduce the cost of confirming positive test results in α thalassemia screening.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://www.jhsmr.org/index.php/jhsmr/article/download/35/56"],"title":"Improvement of the Osmotic Fragility (OF) Test in α Thalassemia 1 Screening for HIV-1 Infected Patients by The New Cutoff Values of MCV and MCH","doi":"10.31584/jhsmr.201935","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.31584/jhsmr.201935","venue":""}

The National High Magnetic Field Laboratory, USA performed verification tests for Nb3Sn strands used in ITER TF magnets. Converting a research laboratory into a large quantity testing facility presented many challenges in developing standard operating procedures for all the verification tests. Verification tests required by ITER include: unreacted-chrome-plated strand diameter, twist pitch and twist direction, chrome-plating thickness, unreacted-chrome-plated strand Cu-to-non-Cu volume ratio, residual resistivity ratio of Cr-plated strand (RRR), critical current at 4.22 K and 12 T (Ic), resistive transition index at 4.22 K and 12 T (n-value), and hysteresis loss per strand unit volume at 4.22 K over a ±3 T cycle. Additionally, due to the brittle nature of Nb3Sn superconducting wire, some samples were damaged in a controlled manner to explore the negative extremes of damage due to sample handling. We successfully completed the verification tests of ITER TF Nb3Sn strands made by US vendors.","inCitations":["236a4dc298b3716b56d4b900ce38f42a3ea5c5ef","3b377da4d399c5ba3df28e16ffe96bc52e359c05"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Verification Testing of ITER Nb3Sn Strand at the NHMFL","doi":"10.1109/TASC.2014.2382032","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASC.2014.2382032","venue":"IEEE Transactions on Applied Superconductivity"}

In this paper we analyze the equilibrium default risk in a two-stage duopoly model with an uncertain environment, where firms decide their financial structure in the first stage of the game and decide their quantities in the second stage of the game. Using numerical analysis, we analyze the impact of changing the asymmetry in the two firms’ marginal costs on the equilibrium default risk. Our results show that as a firm becomes less efficient it is optimal to reduce its debt level and the quantity produced. The reverse is true for the more efficient firm. This behavior implies that although higher marginal cost leads to lower profits, the less efficient firm reduces its default probability due to a more cautious behavior in the financial and product market.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Financial Structure, Product Market Decisions and Default Risk in an Asymmetric Duopoly","doi":"10.1007/978-3-319-24154-8_6","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-24154-8_6","venue":""}

These public celebrations of gay and lesbian identity have considerable economic, social, and cultural benefits and they contribute significantly to the creation of cosmopolitan imagery for the cities in which they are held. In particular, the Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras (SGLMG) is now internationally known as a major gay and lesbian festival and attracts substantial numbers of both domestic and inbound tourists. The article reports on the results of an Internet-based questionnaire survey that sought information concerning gay, lesbian, and queer participants' perceptions and experiences of hostility, threats, and violence on the basis of their sexual identity before, during, and after these events. Event organizers and public officials involved in planning and management emphasize the order and goodwill of these occasions. Nevertheless, participants from these sexual nimorities feel notably unsafe or threatened in relation to significant aspects of attendance at largescale nighttime events with a wide heterosexual participation, and this may prove to be an important factor in the long term viability of these events.","inCitations":["991fcfe55dac1a3bdcb58093a15f8a9f64ffe72c","ff0e062ee6e32f02a8277c505be93002646f1e0a","6dc9f23caca9cf46a44a585f8dc943c8310eb7b5","636433f7bc5f129fce2915009939f1fbcc56ee5c"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Safety and hostility at special events: lessons from Australian gay and lesbian festivals","doi":"10.3727/152599510X12825895093678","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.3727/152599510X12825895093678","venue":""}

This four-day workshop was part of a longer Ecohealth Training Program hosted by CoPEHCAN intended to ‘‘bring together people from different domains who integrate, or who are looking to integrate, the Ecosystem Approaches to Health in their work.’’ The principles of Ecohealth include systems thinking, transdisciplinarity, participation, sustainability, equity, and knowledge-to-action. In this article, I describe some of the challenges and successes I have experienced in my attempts to apply an Ecohealth perspective to my recent work evaluating success in communications at the science–policy interface, especially as relates to knowledge sharing in Canadian environmental health policy-making. At the science–policy interface, communications are often framed as neutral exchanges of information where, for example, scientists simply make policy recommendations; however, in this paper, Johanne Saint-Charles and I argue that information exchange is a transformative, constructivist process. Communications, whether about the natural or human world, occur within a socially networked world. Signaling, according to communications theory, occurs when a message is transmitted from a source to a receiver. These exchanges do not occur in isolation; the information we communicate to friends, family members, or colleagues can influence decisions made in other communities, regions, or nations. For example, the outcomes of research done in a particular community may be conveyed formally (meta-analyses) or informally (personal communications) to other communities and individuals operating at various scales. Groups of people form social networks where they exchange information. For example, at the science–policy interface, researchers, community members, medical professionals, government employees, policy analysts, and indigenous groups may work together to form information conduits where knowledge is diffused, translated, utilized, or mobilized across and within various scales. However, it is not sufficient to simply send and receive messages; effective communication requires iterative dialogue, trust building, and adaptability. Additionally, as with any desirable outcome, successful communication should not be without its own evaluative measures. I see similar core values applied in Ecohealth research, where the goal is to understand how social and ecological factors interact within and between various situations with implications for the wellbeing of the human and ecological constituents of these systems. Being a novice to Ecohealth, I do struggle with my ‘‘fit’’ in this emerging trans-disciplinary field, although my research interests are likewise concerned with linkages between environmental sustainability and human health. My doctoral (residential pesticide use) and postdoctoral (climate change and Arctic food security) research has focused on public views of, involvement in, and responses to environmental health policy-making in Canada. My work has therefore been positioned at the science–policy interface, where systematic inquiry is meant to inform political outcomes. Applying an Ecohealth approach that is focused on enhancing human health is challenging while operating at the science–policy interface. For example, I tend to work with intermediary environment and health EcoHealth 10, 222–223, 2013 DOI: 10.1007/s10393-013-0863-1","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"News from the IAEH","doi":"10.1007/s10393-013-0863-1","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10393-013-0863-1","venue":"EcoHealth"}

As AMPs are bactericidal, production of AMPs in recombinant bacteria is far from trivial. We report the production of Impatiens balsamina antimicrobial peptide 4 (Ib-AMP4, originally isolated from Impatiens balsamina) in Escherichia coli as a fusion protein and investigate Ib-AMP4's antimicrobial effects on human pathogens. A plasmid vector pET32a-Trx-Ib-AMP4 was constructed and transferred into E. coli. After induction, a soluble fusion protein was expressed successfully. The Ib-AMP4 peptide was obtained with a purity of over 90% after nickel affinity chromatography, ultrafiltration, enterokinase cleavage and sephadex size exclusion chromatography. For maximum activity, Ib-AMP4, which possesses two disulfide bonds, required activation with 5 μg/mL H2 O2 . Antimicrobial assays showed that Ib-AMP4 could efficiently target clinical multiresistant isolates including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing E. coli. Time kill experiments revealed that Ib-AMP4 is bactericidal within 10 min after application.

These geophysical data wasindividually analyzed and a value of 185 CPS for indeformed Gouveia Complex and 80 CPS for Barao doGuaiui Formation could be taken as prospect guidance. The radargrams were useful to realize the subsurfacestructure, faults, fractures, and coluvium. In this area four main litostratigraphic units was identified: (a)Gouveia Complex, represented by s.l granites (b) Barao do Guaicui Formation, formed by typical quartzsericite-schist (c) Galho do Miguel Formation, represented by a thick, white and homogenous layer of quartziteand (d) Basic Igneous rocks, composed by mafic and massive, lightly greenly. A main milonitic foliationoccurs, S1, dipping 095-085/40 as well as regional NW / SE fractures. In the schist and granite, that foliationcauses rotation and deformation of some minerals.

Abstract: This project is an investigation about the sociocultural part of ecuavoley in Cuenca, Ecuador, where the field observations, as the main research method, were conducted to gather as much information as possible, and then mapped this sport and tell about it by creating two video art works titled: Interstices (3 min.) and Instincts (3 min. 6 s.) performed in July, 2016 with their respective theorizing and conceptualization. The route the reach the right place, in the style of an artist as ethnographer (Hal Foster) to observe and analyze the world of ecuavoley in all its aspects, was reached after a long process through several years to became part of this cultural and sportive praxis, noticing that it lacks of structure, such as the hordes that Emile Durkheim mentions, which have as joining mechanism its similarities. All the steps in this process: the approach, observation, research, theorizing, creating works of art with this conceptualization… favour the consolidation of a history of ecuavoley that contributes to its development.

The full adder cell forms the basic building block of majority of these signal processing circuits. In this paper, 8-Bit subthreshold Ripple Carry Adders (RCAs) for wireless sensor nodes optimized for ultra low power operation are proposed. Major contribution of this work is conversion of BSIM4, Predictive Technology Model (32nm) to EKV model (charge based model). The 8-bit RCAs are simulated with HSPICE (Level =55) using the 32nm CMOS technology at supply voltages ranging from 0.25V to 0.4V. Various metrics such as delay, average power and power delay product (PDP) are simulated and reported for effective twelve different topologies. The circuit designers can choose the full adder topology and the supply voltage that is suitable for their applications. Usage of EKV models results in 11% reduction in power than that of using BSIM models for the adder cell “CB” with supply voltage of 0.2V.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"8-Bit sub threshold adders in 32nm CMOS technology for","doi":"10.1109/ICCCNT.2010.5591637","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCNT.2010.5591637","venue":"2010 Second International conference on Computing, Communication and Networking Technologies"}

The researchers hypothesized that departments are most likely to expand in hospital settings with missions that are supportive of clinical, preventive, and community-oriented services; that stress innovation; and that emphasize hospital-funded services and programs. Further, it was hypothesized that social work services would be most likely to expand in settings where hospital administrators perceive them to be relevant to practical needs of the institution. Findings from a survey of 50 non-profit hospitals in Los Angeles County in 1980 confirm these hypotheses and suggest that social workers need to use knowledge of the organizational context to develop high-level support for their departments.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"The ecology of social work departments: empirical findings and strategy implications.","doi":"10.1300/J010v11n02_01","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1300/J010v11n02_01","venue":"Social work in health care"}

It shows that, although waste-to-energy figures on a lower level in the European waste hierarchy than recycling, it plays, from an overall sustainability point of view, an essential, complementary and facilitating role within the circular economy. First of all, waste-to-energy combusts (or should combust) only waste that is non-recyclable for economic, technical or environmental reasons. This way waste-to-energy is compatible with recycling and only competes with landfill, which is lower in the waste hierarchy. Furthermore, waste-to-energy keeps material cycles, and ultimately the environment and humans largely free from toxic substances. Finally, waste-to-energy allows recovery of both energy and materials from non-recyclable waste and hence contributes to keeping materials in circulation. These arguments are elaborated and illustrated with many examples. This paper also points out the pitfalls of a circular economy if it merely focuses on material cycles, disregarding economic, environmental, social and health aspects of sustainability.Graphical abstract","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Waste-to-energy is compatible and complementary with recycling in the circular economy","doi":"10.1007/s10098-019-01686-0","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10098-019-01686-0","venue":"Clean Technologies and Environmental Policy"}

Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) is the rate-limiting enzyme that is crucial for dopamine biosynthesis, and its activity is tightly regulated by phosphorylation at multiple N-terminal serine residues. Previously, we have reported that intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection of ouabain, a selective Na/K-ATPase inhibitor, induces hyperactivity in rats that mimics manic symptoms related to the activation of extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase1/2 (ERK1/2), which plays crucial roles in the modulation of TH phosphorylation. In this study, we investigated the effects of ICV injection of ouabain on TH phosphorylation in rat striatum and the involvement of ERK1/2 in ouabain-induced TH activation. ICV ouabain induced an acute dose-dependent increase in locomotor activity and in TH phosphorylation in rat striatum. TH phosphorylation at Ser19 was significantly increased with 100, 500, and 1000μM ouabain, and phosphorylation at Ser31 and Ser40 was significantly increased with 500 and 1000μM. We also found that ICV pretreatment with U0126, a specific MEK1/2 inhibitor, attenuated the 1000μM ouabain-induced increase in TH phosphorylation at Ser19, Ser31, and Ser40, as well as the hyperactivity of rats. Moreover, the increased phosphorylation of TH (Ser19, Ser31, and Ser40) was maintained until 8h after single administration ouabain was accompanied by increased phosphorylation of ERK1/2 (Thr202/Tyr204) and p90RSK (Thr359/Ser363). These findings imply that TH activation of the ERK1/2 signal pathway could play an important role in ouabain-induced hyperactivity of rats, a mania model.","inCitations":["5c9b032b61e3d76a4a0d2e5f6ea1419ce61c905f","e5b2d260fb9b3a4582dad14ac5affe74bcb706d4","5a486e6590aba71fb455b2a83538457f6fe85c5b","60da60fe40861b606fc12f8c15cf14bade9347e6","0452f400c62f02da0b61eee5717da89cbfb568aa","600d17f905b4aadf0da716423e913f9ce85daa9a","cbf756820d4161db3377f0b6c57c933a42f05547","0589582877eece71b091a1076cd7043e251e21ef","dbe9257e1d03de4be19f33c158ad783117977551","b74fec746a47860430937e373a7c565d9cb1f892"],"pdfUrls":["https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0197018611002816","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0197018611002816?dgcid=api_sd_search-api-endpoint"],"title":"Intracerebroventricular administration of ouabain, a Na/K-ATPase inhibitor, activates tyrosine hydroxylase through extracellular signal-regulated kinase in rat striatum","doi":"10.1016/j.neuint.2011.08.011","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuint.2011.08.011","venue":"Neurochemistry International"}

The results of these studies show, that the reduced glucose permeation rates in rats with nephrogenic hypertension can be normalized by xantinol nicotinate above values of controls. In hypoxemic rats it could be shown, that xantinol nicotinate antagonizes the decrease of the intracerebral ATP-concentration by 50%. The investigation of the ATP-pool resulted in a significant increase of the ATP level in the brain tissue about 35% at maximum. This increase of the ATP-concentration continues up to 4 h following a single oral administration of xantinol nicotinate. The determination of the incorporation rates of 32Pi-isotope showed that only small amounts of radioactivity were measured in the AMP-fraction in controls as well as in xantinol nicotinate treated rats. Further phosphorylation steps of adenosine monophosphate (AMP) to adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and ATP, however, are considerably activated by xantinol nicotinate, whereby maximum labelling rates of the ADP were found already 15 min after dosing. Maximum 32Pi-incorporation rates of the ATP-fraction were measured 30 min following administration of the tracer and of xantinol nicotinate, respectively.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"[Effect of xanthinol nicotinate on brain metabolism in rats].","doi":"","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"Arzneimittel-Forschung"}

The ground state of the pairing Hamiltonian is described by a quartet condensate to which is appended a pair condensate formed by the neutrons in excess. The quartets are built by two isovector pairs coupled to the total isospin $T=0$ and two collective isoscalar proton-neutron pairs. To probe this ansatz for the ground state we performed calculations for $N>Z$ nuclei with the valence nucleons moving above the cores $^{16}$O, $^{40}$Ca and $^{100}$Sn. The calculations are done with two pairing interactions, one state-independent and the other of zero range, which are supposed to scatter pairs in time-revered orbits. It is proven that the ground state correlation energies calculated within this approach are very close to the exact results provided by the diagonalization of the pairing Hamiltonian. Based on this formalism we have shown that moving away of N=Z line, both the isoscalar and the isovector proton-neutron pairing correlations remain significant and that they cannot be treated accurately by models based on a proton-neutron pair condensate.","inCitations":["54397f5dbab2c188a8ec9c801e2d1a2c4e0b4e07"],"pdfUrls":["https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.06552v1.pdf"],"title":"Isovector and isoscalar proton-neutron pairing in $N>Z$ nuclei","doi":"10.1103/PhysRevC.98.064319","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevC.98.064319","venue":""}
