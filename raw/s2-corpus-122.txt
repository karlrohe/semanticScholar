It is frequently encountered when using a classifier to generalize on real-world application data sets, and it causes a classifier to perform sub-optimally. Researchers have rigorously studied resampling methods, new algorithms, and feature selection methods, but no studies have been conducted to understand how well these methods combat the class imbalance problem. In particular, feature selection has been rarely studied outside of text classification problems. Additionally, no studies have looked at the additional problem of learning from small samples. This paper develops a new feature selection metric, Feature Assessment by Sliding Thresholds (FAST), specifically designed to handle small sample imbalanced data sets. FAST is based on the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUC) generated by moving the decision boundary of a single feature classifier with thresholds placed using an even-bin distribution. This paper also presents a first systematic comparison of the three types of methods developed for imbalanced data classification problems and of seven feature selection metrics evaluated on small sample data sets from different applications. We evaluated the performance of these metrics using AUC and area under the P-R curve (PRC). We compared each metric on the average performance across all problems and on the likelihood of a metric yielding the best performance on a specific problem. We examined the performance of these metrics inside each problem domain. Finally, we evaluated the efficacy of these metrics to see which perform best across algorithms. Our results showed that signal-to-noise correlation coefficient (S2N) and FAST are great candidates for feature selection in most applications.","inCitations":["0e5a2afe487ccc5723efa2f706c378d48d4d1668","6c171182cb3d9dac4d3e001b17a0049a99fdbfe1","a04d8eb2564a491f2f95efaaa1d84e09cd7f3142","58bc9f2438377738dc5820fb563b09e134f7df18","30702d4b02e713d692a57ce2faff164e94783de6"],"pdfUrls":["https://kuscholarworks.ku.edu/bitstream/handle/1808/5451/Wasikowski_ku_0099M_10469_DATA_1.pdf?isAllowed=y&sequence=1"],"title":"Combating the Class Imbalance Problem in Small Sample Data Sets","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

In vitro, FcγRIIIa genotype was correlated with ADCC and innate cytotoxicity using natural killer (NK) cells harvested from healthy donors. In the phase II study, patients with recurrent or metastatic SCCHN were treated with cetuximab (500 mg/m(2) i.v. every 2 weeks) and lenalidomide (25 mg daily). FcγRIIIa genotype and ex vivo ADCC were correlated with clinical response, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS). In vitro, healthy donors with a FcγRIIIa 158-V allele demonstrated more effective ADCC against two colon cancer cell lines HT29 and SW480, mean cytotoxicity: FF 16.1%, VF/VV 24.3% (P = 0.015) and FF 11.7%, VF/VV 21.0% (P = 0.008), respectively. We observed a linear relationship between ADCC response and innate cytotoxicity. In the phase II trial, 40 patients received cetuximab and lenalidomide with median PFS of 7.2 weeks and OS of 16.4 weeks. Thirty-six patients had FcγRIIIa genotype: VV (2), VF (20), and FF (14), and 25 patients had sufficient NK-cell yield to perform ex vivo ADCC. FcγRIIIa genotype was not associated with any clinical outcomes. Patients mounting ex vivo ADCC response had a higher likelihood of stable disease (P = 0.01) and showed a trend toward increased PFS: 14 weeks versus 6.8 weeks, respectively (P = 0.13). Enhanced ex vivo ADCC and innate immunity responses were more predictive of clinical response than FcγRIIIa and may offer a functional assay to select patients suitable for cetuximab therapy.","inCitations":["c1dfe8829cd9115360bbd5fa38e037b213c19ffd","f858ca604a1d3112a1f4ff941d30a40c9d530fc7","25a91bce02ecda927c4aa641357968ae6d70350a","c7c8babc9527e1e228c4d49a4a214782270d9c02","238c5a198fa7b33152322d2ffe93fd4dc3841e00","403c6f0ee788815fe6e4ca9698f1c0425437548c","09863384b1d2e4ffe3da8005c513ed7564d3f44e","8befac6d65ead978c301a58ebcc629edb9c7d93c","2df5c44b122a5522769f7153f4e49460706bc077","8af9243661b2f474e5273e536b0f988bb8fe8d57","be5413a63d183d2fbfcc42b7a90da7197c3e9a43","984e8fb0fbc0ee275927ef5cab96866f6f80eccc","5415ebc0be87b8f06ef6447b67d923e3125542ae","b8d930b0c7bc13da6a57b8823b1cbb62c9bad436","6a5083258b94aa0629e4695b8628cabca92a7c34","d5a20f2849c7fbb67dbdd341775d498b9d15e149"],"pdfUrls":["http://cancerimmunolres.aacrjournals.org/content/canimm/3/5/567.full.pdf"],"title":"Ex vivo antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity inducibility predicts efficacy of cetuximab.","doi":"10.1158/2326-6066.CIR-14-0188","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1158/2326-6066.CIR-14-0188","venue":"Cancer immunology research"}

We propose a theoretical model for calculating the long time dynamics of the prepared Overhauser field under nuclear spin diffusion in a quantum dot. We obtained a simplified diffusion equation that can be numerically solved, and we show quantitatively how the Knight shift and the electron- mediated nuclear spin flip-flops affect the nuclear spin diffusion. The results explain several recent experimental observations, where the measured decay time of the Overhauser field is dependent on the external magnetic field, electron spin state in double quantum dots and initial nuclear spin polarization rate.","inCitations":["0d92842114ec85d8970a4bf927cc090504836f13","e6eefbaba24cac696ec8391ee745ba8a45a3c5bb","b46cf1c4f7bdd4bb6925fb9e55b0ad02ce458aba","21b955dc2c5185bac375733bd9a02e4a837a81c7","1d672cf190596a43c17794e8949a12b6c9505cc0","9b0ad4eaba1414aba63e149503e3914c7adfeadf","3f88778c12a77c62c05ae51a14736b70291951f5","21264be4f06152eced39f5533f814eb585a50049"],"pdfUrls":["https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/handle/2027.42/90813/1367-2630_13_3_033036.pdf?isAllowed=y&sequence=1","http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/1048760.pdf","http://absimage.aps.org/image/DAMOP10/MWS_DAMOP10-2010-000869.pdf","https://arxiv.org/pdf/0912.4322v1.pdf"],"title":"Dynamics of the Overhauser field under nuclear spin diffusion in a quantum dot","doi":"10.1088/1367-2630/13/3/033036","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1088/1367-2630%2F13%2F3%2F033036","venue":""}

At the highest dose levels pyknosis of the Clara cells was apparent. After 5 days of repeated exposures the lesion had resolved but exposure of mice following a 2-day break resulted in recurrence of the lesion. The changes in mouse lung Clara cells were accompanied by a marked loss of cytochrome P-450 activities. No morphological changes were seen in the lungs of rats exposed to either 500 or 1000 ppm trichloroethylene. Isolated mouse lung Clara cells were shown to metabolize trichloroethylene to chloral, trichloroethanol and trichloroacetic acid. Chloral was the major metabolite. Trichloroethanol glucuronide was not detected. In comparative experiments using mouse hepatocytes the major metabolites were trichloroethanol and its glucuronide conjugate. The activity of UDP-glucuronosyltransferase was compared in mouse lung Clara cells and hepatocytes using two phenolic substrates and trichloroethanol. Hepatocytes readily formed glucuronides from all three substrates whereas Clara cells were only active with the two phenolic substrates. The three major metabolites of trichloroethylene, chloral, trichloroethanol and trichloroacetic acid were each dosed to mice and of these metabolites, only chloral had an effect on mouse lung causing a lesion (Clara cell) identical to that seen with trichloroethylene. It is proposed that the failure of Clara cells to conjugate trichloroethanol leads to an accumulation of chloral which results in cytotoxicity. The known genotoxicity of chloral suggests that this lesion may be related to the development of lung tumours in mice exposed to trichloroethylene by inhalation.","inCitations":["84790b9b445e58a3c63e193e4950ed5dcd42851b","6dc285ece2cc154c9311a72a961a8f998f0ffeaf","92ae424dfd0c52d43606e3527ae1106fedcd2457","b7922f73983e4b25ce4fd983fbd940c96e2a8fd6","b861206890e7c4d733ede45948f3f4a305c719a9","a0622c98d40bf5e952269c332835c8ca52a83e22","d0cc4e857898cb97c61184ab54c54de3be1433d9","4a6e17da61d588c7b154bac885ae2dcfc41a1683","207848bb1b6976c061b30f067dc36527572b5a2d","0caede2bca88c49198a5c65d150697ca80c7182a","89501064b82b5f5e1a70cec301202c906ac7bd22","24712ccd18ed8371a7663b1828793437d36db967","cb26afcc4a184d3521d7d577b2a020131ba01bde","0c284875e317ef5507de0722bf84a3686bb22d32","9b9e4e0744e8f848ef8a4cd320873621c6dcf99a","2f51e4489a2bf3f58d4e996e32b2614413c00398","afd63491551fa2df5a1aa51c3d73440826c61935","fed0eba208f7a211fb627c5e75166341a1df0157","6e887963849229e519f330ef24fd74fc3b8c41f0","ae82ab5cda1e2978844c2560dc4844dcd63e8e49","67de387c2e9c60ab07337abc4767ccc3e9fc0514","a631914239236e98ae313279fb6ad4044c4790d8","1ee0ee43f2c0da96e3315353552ccdafd645dbca","4c05b89c5c802e2d3191843ee47abb7d573639ea","f65c2c6d49d156400f20ff99c046c0c9b1f99a63","0369cbd211f28c09d5c583e07666e3b17f4277b3","990c02c928d67a690fd8e5415487468c7406b386","69f90c843e55561d4c23612163a3ef42c2e9c0d5","3c17d2eb84b072c4798dcf1b66e5c5bceca393bb"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"A mechanism for the development of Clara cell lesions in the mouse lung after exposure to trichloroethylene.","doi":"10.1016/0009-2797(92)90042-J","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/0009-2797%2892%2990042-J","venue":"Chemico-biological interactions"}

Angeline1 defined three distinct adaptive levels which are: population, individual and component levels. Cultural Algorithms have been shown to provide a framework in which to model self-adaptation at each of these levels. Here, we examine the role that different forms of knowledge can play in the self-adaptation process at the population level for evolution-based function optimizers. In particular, we compare the relative performance of normative and situational knowledge in guiding the search process. An acceptance function using a fuzzy inference engine is employed to select acceptable individuals for forming the generalized knowledge in the belief space. Evolutionary programming is used to implement the population space. The results suggest that the use of a cultural framework can produce substantial performance improvements in execution time and accuracy for a given set of function minimization problems over population-only evolutionary systems.","inCitations":["14b77269a01de714cf4e26086b1ee01e15f56827","c23648b51e18feb79f9b2e5df7b318fdc5fe9152","ecb95c0b79d0a68485b0a0c09349a20270bcde2d","ccecbfbd550b2c9c62efa6f6d95aac194d5db893","1482607e66ec60dda5d4954f497bf15a24fd186a","9dd920071b9d8bfbd700dad8e7f1605d7d35b1a2"],"pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1142/S0218001400000040"],"title":"Knowledge-Based Self-Adaptation in Evolutionary Search","doi":"10.1142/S0218001400000040","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1142/S0218001400000040","venue":"IJPRAI"}

Unfortunately, many YAC clones have been found to undergo rearrangements or deletions during the cloning process. The frequency of transformation-associated alterations and mitotic instability can be reduced in a homologous recombination-deficient yeast host strain such as a rad52 mutant. RAD52 is one member of an epistatic group of genes required for the recombinational repair of double-strand breaks in DNA. rad52 mutants grow more slowly and transform less efficiently than RAD + strains and are therefore not ideal hosts for YAC library construction. We have investigated the ability of both null and temperature-sensitive alleles of RAD54 , another member of the RAD52 epistasis group, to prevent rearrangements of human YAC clones containing tandemly repeated DNA sequences. Our results show that the temperature-sensitive rad54-3 allele blocks mitotic recombination between tandemly repeated DYZ3 satellite sequences and significantly stabilizes a human DYZ5 satellite-containing YAC clone. Yeast carrying the rad54-3 mutation can undergo meiosis, have growth and transformation rates comparable with RAD + strains, and therefore represent improved YAC cloning hosts.","inCitations":["1ba47c832ff940c771a5729d6c5bb2ee7dc169b8","eab905ed1cb2f688ac4dc1c10ddeb75024c253da","924a099dadfbe8e430da2165a73b733afc549451","6f205ccda79079ae65f44d7fdc30c52eaf9975da","1262572b44087bf7afcaf2028030ea3b95da6e90","bc0099cd766255cb92f13f2554f4f27bbf587b7b","fe0ab2c6cbe9d42a2053c4fffc861dfb26177ee7","a0df8d7a96082ecc488d2923fd6c9bcaa5ad5d6f","7f42c0b9075fd0abd5dc53e2fe81c03875bf5620"],"pdfUrls":["https://oup.silverchair-cdn.com/oup/backfile/Content_public/Journal/nar/25/6/10.1093/nar/25.6.1248/2/25-6-1248.pdf?Expires=1491322414&Key-Pair-Id=APKAIUCZBIA4LVPAVW3Q&Signature=N55p5GFEUddEE3qYbZmIAvh~BNGKKSgX-NF8pbAeiNcSGz~0s1iWkCQUx8qGJzjO31Rf-XrvfGJz9KfYqKnBnfTs1fCHqgI-9nhPFOe9oz8Bglamw2xEyy6sgaaqXmtqPUZBIFRvaVg744gz2Fjw9xDCAG7NnkYJ1EUeowSOpOoZFQ38J6Xc5bsLcaUO9AMbFoM8f2BJV7REuuRKC6wY-NS88lyeF6jUSjp6kwEKNyamQDKMVK9Vsb7c6EVQdZf3uJwz33gXFpg5I2VWjscSQ7yXBPW3Jw5nNiigXaT6DG3b67si8qqMqWS47eAgpiul5CP8Ddg2eppT5sXq6xRO-A__"],"title":"Stabilization of yeast artificial chromosome clones in a rad54-3 recombination-deficient host strain.","doi":"10.1093/nar/25.6.1248","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1093/nar%2F25.6.1248","venue":"Nucleic acids research"}

Dire Dawa City one of the federal states in North East Ethiopia has a high rate of accidents and deaths in relation to number of vehicles on the road. Realizing the need to establish baseline information on RTAs, the present study was conducted in Dire Dawa city under the jurisdiction of Dire Dawa Police Station, Dire Dawa, Ethiopia. Complete Road traffic car accident data of the year 2009 - 2013 from police records of Dire Dawa city Police station were studied. Data can be analyzed by using SPSS version 20.0 and MINITAB version 13.1 software. Data interpretation was done using descriptive statistics, two t-test comparison, chi-square test of independence, analysis of variance (one-way and two-way), and design of factorial experiment. The finding of this paper showed that the main cause of car accident is drivers. About 80% of car accident is resulted from the driver fault. Among the accident that resulted from the driver fault, not given priority for pedestrian contain the first position. Other factor like poor road condition, poor car condition, the absence of knowledge in traffic system, lack of ambulance and poor medical treatment are other cause and condition that increase the severity of the incident. Generally, the occurrence of car accident problem depends on defect on human factor, vehicle characteristics, road characteristics and environmental condition. The age of driver had also a significant impact on the occurrence of traffic accidents.

The starting steroids 1 and 2, as well as both 3β,20(R)-dihydroxy metabolites were not detected in the examined biological urine samples. Thus, we demonstrate for the first time that exogenous progestines - pregna-D'-pentaranes - and endogenous progesterone follow similar metabolic pathways.

Representative results show the evolution of the visible light emission using an equimolar n -butane:oxygen premixture at temperatures ranging from 320 to 350 °C (593–623 K) at subatmospheric pressures. For representative reduced-gravity, spherically propagating cool flames, the flame radius based on the peak light intensity is plotted as a function of time and the flame radius (and speed) is calculated from a polynomial fit to data. A skeletal chemical kinetic Gray-Yang model developed previously for a one-dimensional, reactive–diffusive system by Fairlie and co-workers is extended to a two-dimensional axisymmetric, spherical geometry.

This is the first part of a broader research project to develop a novel cloud-seeding operational system in a probabilistic framework. The ensemble perturbations were extracted from selected members of the National Center for Environmental Prediction Global Ensemble Forecasting System (NCEP GEFS) forecasts, and an inflation factor of two was applied to compensate for the lack of spread in the GEFS forecasts over the research region. Experiments on an actual stratiform precipitation case that occurred on 5–7 June 2009 in northern China were conducted to validate the ensemble system. The IAP REFS system had reasonably good performance in predicting the observed stratiform precipitation system. The perturbation inflation enlarged the ensemble spread and alleviated the underdispersion caused by parent forecasts. Centering the extracted perturbations on higher-resolution NCEP Global Forecast System forecasts resulted in less ensemble mean root-mean-square error and better accuracy in probabilistic quantitative precipitation forecasts (PQPF). However, the perturbation inflation and recentering had less effect on near-surface-level variables compared to the mid-level variables, and its influence on PQPF resolution was limited as well.","inCitations":["379dc01ceb609f2f19674575ee9f4a9d1a1673be","77f991c324262bfb1e95bb1268f06adf950b09f8","0bb04e3752e0f6ca7d279bdce733d0a92b6aad32","37e5ed44012584452cb0f03b81e294f843cf65b6","828a6e4e07dd85601efa99c73c9e70f3974a3978"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"A regional ensemble forecast system for stratiform precipitation events in northern China.

However, Friedmann universes in general posses a finite gravitational horizon, as a result of which the application of the shell theorem fails and the Newtonian derivation collapses. We show that in the presence of a gravitational horizon the Friedmann equation can be derived from a Machian definition of kinetic energy, without invoking the shell theorem. Whereas in the Newtonian case total energy translates to curvature energy density, in the Machian case total energy takes on different identities, depending on the evolution of the horizon; we show that in the de Sitter universe Machian total energy density is constant, i.e. appears as cosmological constant.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1604.01258","https://arxiv.org/pdf/1604.01258v2.pdf"],"title":"Machian derivation of the Friedmann equation","doi":"10.1103/PhysRevD.94.043520","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevD.94.043520","venue":""}

In the light of climate change, the response of ecosystems to perturbations, such as drought, is particularly important. Ecosystems may resist change in functioning under perturbation and/or show resilience by recovering to the original state after perturbation. The insurance hypothesis predicts that both resistance, recovery and resilience should decrease with biodiversity loss. The hypothesis is based on the assumption that species differ in their response to environmental change. Thus, as species richness decreases, the range of species responses will decrease. Consequently, more diverse communities have a lower chance of including a species that will increase its performance and compensate for other species in response to perturbation. Here, we test this hypothesis by analysing the effects of an extreme summer drought on community biomass in a long-term biodiversity experiment, which has shown that productivity increases with species richness. Results/Conclusions Resistance to drought decreased with diversity, but this pattern was highly dependent upon pre-drought performance. When corrected for initial biomass, no relationship between diversity and resistance was observed: at each level of diversity, biomass production was reduced by approximately 30%. In contrast, recovery (change in biomass production after drought) increased with diversity and was independent of pre-drought performance. This pattern appears to be driven by a diversity-dependent increase in performance after drought of a grass species. Interestingly, this increase did not affect the recovery of the other species. We conclude that it is this diversity-dependent recovery which allowed diverse, productive communities to reach the same level of resilience after one year as less diverse (and productive) communities. This finding provides strong experimental evidence for the insurance hypothesis.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"The importance of plant diversity for resistance and resilience to drought in temperate grasslands","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Our previous positron emission tomography (PET) studies showed that the EGFR-targeting affibody molecules (64)Cu-DOTA-ZEGFR:1907 and (18)F-FBEM-ZEGFR:1907 can discriminate between high and low EGFR-expression tumors and have the potential for patient selection for EGFR-targeted therapy. Compared with (64)Cu, (18)F may improve imaging of EGFR-expression and is more suitable for clinical application, but the labeling reaction of (18)F-FBEM-ZEGFR:1907 requires a long synthesis time. The aim of the present study is to develop a new generation of (18)F labeled affibody probes (Al(18)F-NOTA-ZEGFR:1907 and (18)F-CBT-ZEGFR:1907) and to determine whether they are suitable agents for imaging of EGFR expression. The first approach consisted of conjugating ZEGFR:1907 with NOTA and radiolabeling with Al(18)F to produce Al(18)F-NOTA-ZEGFR:1907. In a second approach the prosthetic group (18)F-labeled-2-cyanobenzothiazole ((18)F-CBT) was conjugated to Cys-ZEGFR:1907 to produce (18)F-CBT-ZEGFR:1907. Binding affinity and specificity of Al(18)F-NOTA-ZEGFR:1907 and (18)F-CBT-ZEGFR:1907 to EGFR were evaluated using A431 cells. Biodistribution and PET studies were conducted on mice bearing A431 xenografts after injection of Al(18)F-NOTA-ZEGFR:1907 or (18)F-CBT-ZEGFR:1907 with or without coinjection of unlabeled affibody proteins. The radiosyntheses of Al(18)F-NOTA-ZEGFR:1907 and (18)F-CBT-ZEGFR:1907 were completed successfully within 40 and 120 min with a decay-corrected yield of 15% and 41% using a 2-step, 1-pot reaction and 2-step, 2-pot reaction, respectively. Both probes bound to EGFR with low nanomolar affinity in A431 cells. Although (18)F-CBT-ZEGFR:1907 showed instability in vivo, biodistribution studies revealed rapid and high tumor accumulation and quick clearance from normal tissues except the bones. In contrast, Al(18)F-NOTA-ZEGFR:1907 demonstrated high in vitro and in vivo stability, high tumor uptake, and relative low uptake in most of the normal organs except the liver and kidneys at 3 h after injection. The specificity of both probes for A431 tumors was confirmed by their lower uptake on coinjection of unlabeled affibody. PET studies showed that Al(18)F-NOTA-ZEGFR:1907 and (18)F-CBT-ZEGFR:1907 could clearly identify EGFR positive tumors with good contrast. Two strategies for (18)F-labeling of affibody molecules were successfully developed as two model platforms using NOTA or CBT coupling to affibody molecules that contain an N-terminal cysteine. Al(18)F-NOTA-ZEGFR:1907 and (18)F-CBT-ZEGFR:1907 can be reliably obtained in a relatively short time. Biodistribution and PET studies demonstrated that Al(18)F-NOTA-ZEGFR:1907 is a promising PET probe for imaging EGFR expression in living mice.","inCitations":["50a67ca7834d2d639282d93ad15bb7e2d4c0d8f8","5706063345bb624a96301cf6c90ed367b2ef5cb1","7991a34731cd17b7e9049527598c81294cb6f8cc","698e14e5c391e59cd3f826e89526d851549d8348","ef61b623c9b774b2d570379d26c9a6eed8a985ba","b7217ec2b02027bcffada10688069fbf9fd81190","14f8c48979cce18d5a506acba069da29c81e83d0","ad003bab77c682f5b14f7fa67846c24fbe29dbbd","fb6931e150bffec602c5fce4af8f436bd9e5981b","03707711d5b32428c5866120bedb7a515342db93","5d234e21707b88690f00aa4315037ea4ba9692f3","57a34469bd72492b01439c9e8e2307cf3e43717a","ad9ca4b22d110b80227013717813d165625ff9f5","1468b7683003a88cbb3cbb95f8923a252c1f0c0e","36a0a5c5880c9034d854f5106c3cd743bf6ce4bd","5e0668c93e2d69914b4f996bff4593d9e537916d","e2311f1c13f72ba5a07364b9a05a8503be037c2b","4f8c18f2276f4e7eaadb2e0582fc45f706fb0fe1","f15a7c653b762dfa2e3c72a90e24f734f63e6c90","91881fe50b6d2d1d64d6956ed556cc694e6de828","b09d4e8c703341bcc0cab88e2439fc669d10bfb0","c14d0c97f21cf7d4626d97753dedff286aff31c2","a279f2234cdddf1b6639c446cb30277a3d4005cd","f545165d44261201db36ebec3e40a0252d10e883","60fb2a82aeaff8db98340b54d663f9c89d96482d","c34fa61b51790b78b7cee17e074fcdbe2617e7bd"],"pdfUrls":["http://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/pmc/c1/56/mp5003043.PMC4218868.pdf"],"title":"Comparison of Two Site-Specifically 18F-Labeled Affibodies for PET Imaging of EGFR Positive Tumors","doi":"10.1021/mp5003043","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1021/mp5003043","venue":"Molecular pharmaceutics"}

Short presentation of principles of learning, starting with Pavlovian’s classical conditioning through reinforced response and operant conditioning of Thorndike and Skinner and finishing with cognitive learning of Tolman and Bandura will be given. The most important figures within behaviourism, especially those with contribution to AI, will be described. Some tools of artificial intelligence that act according to those principles will be presented. An attempt will be made to show when some simple rules for behaviour modifications can lead to a complex intelligent behaviour. 1. Intelligence: Description It can be stated without any doubt that behaviourists have made a great contribution to the development of artificial intelligence. The evidence from the animal learning theory, especially the laws of learning discovered by behaviourists, has attracted researchers within artificial intelligence for many years and many models have been based on them. Intelligence is a complex and controversial concept, therefore it is very difficult to capture it by a simple definition. According to Jordan and Jordan [1] it is appropriate to regard intelligence as a concept we employ to describe actions of a certain quality. Two criteria should be used in this regard, namely, speed (i.e. how quickly an agent performs a particular task requiring mental ability) and power (i.e. the degree of difficulty of the tasks an agent can perform). On the other hand one can find another definition of intelligence expressed in term of an ability to perform cognitive processes. There are three fundamental cognitive processes: 1) abstraction, 2) learning, and 3) dealing with novelty. Intelligence has been given many definitions by prominent researchers in the field, for example, it has been defined as: https://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp?R=20070038351 2018-06-18T19:32:03+00:00Z","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20070038351.pdf"],"title":"Chapter 9 Pavlovian , Skinner , and Other Behaviourists ’ Contributions to AI * * *","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

In an hierarchical age, when cultural patronage was in the hands of the court, the universities, the established church and London social elites, the literary prospects for a poorly educated provincial sectarian preacher might appear dim and yet this same Bedfordshire tinker, ‘of a low and inconsiderable generation’ from one of the ‘meanest and most despised of all the families in the Land’, wrote nearly sixty STORRE STORRE: Stirling Online Research Repository John Bunyan's Literary Life works and, with The Pilgrim’s Progress, became the century’s bestselling writer. While, however, his success was exceptional, the fact of Bunyan’s authorship was not quite as improbable as it might seem. His early literary career coincided with, and was shaped by, the unprecedented increase in press activity associated with the gathering momentum of the English Revolution. The political and religious tensions of the first half of the century were accompanied by, and articulated through, a proliferating press whose annual output rose from 625 titles in 1639 to 848 in 1640, over 2000 in 1641 and over 3,666 in 1642, thereafter to continue at between one and two thousand annually until the Restoration. A unique record of this productivity is preserved in the remarkable collection of broadsides, tracts, pamphlets and books assembled by the bookseller George Thomason, who, between 1640 and 1661, amassed 22,000 publications. Never before had so many people turned to writing, never before had so many seen their thoughts into print, and never before had what they printed generated such extensive interest and public debate.

Cases of ASD were identified from the clinical notes of children in the ALSPAC with a suspected developmental disorder and from the Pupil Level Annual Schools Census (PLASC) for England in 2003. Seventy-one cases of ASD diagnosed after a multidisciplinary assessment were identified from health records. There were an additional 15 cases from PLASC data in which ASD was mentioned as a principal difficulty, thus giving a total of 86 children diagnosed by the age of 11 years. Prevalence of ASD per 10,000 population at 11 years was 51.1 for those with a multi-professional diagnosis, and 61.9 if cases from education were included, made up of 21.6 for childhood autism, 10.8 for atypical autism, 16.6 for Asperger syndrome, and 13.0 for unspecified ASD. The male:female ratio was 6.8:1. Median age at diagnosis ranged from 45 months in childhood autism to 116 months in Asperger syndrome. A comorbid developmental disorder was recorded in 33.8% of cases, including learning disability in 14.7%, epilepsy in 10.3%, and mixed developmental disorder in 4.4%. We conclude that the prevalence of ASD diagnosed at 11 years in a UK representative population-based sample is at least 51.1/10,000.","inCitations":["5031d3f1053db4d0e15fa34b323d313d45d410e6","16211e58a4072f1e18db30432eb820a1e74e6e87","7181b081c0962cce868bc4cfc54ace67d0f971c4","fb1166324d839b6bcb078434ffcd007df7274905","ebd9777ee15fcbb04421b4123da8c17d267be1e1","19a7dcd8724863f83d643761b18785d44eab21fc","66dcf70c6d22b6f2b55d846df02883e2082be938","355e7d0a563e2277ef93e6b35d724bfc49ddfbd1","715b61955564d9141c9408b505ab37a839f8794e","3e514360e23840d8680631a589864be5d3528e48","3fc4f4f8746d03ee3e836ed75ba3fd64bfe6c0b9","c7bd0a40633e903ba1925ae9efc84a4019aa5d11","8e63f5ef4a915eeb6c16a2f56079cc57f3baa661","769a870c27dc57cc09bf62df02f110ced1c3d0c8","4ff4a2a22ed13da32216ba520c0e7fd95f005a86","b186b127f4068d99b3f53d866edf41d5e07a3356","cf2510473165c181affe414d5990eb3e35b42ab5","df97bd93b110b4e59163ee3fa479cdacbc8d1e51","590e87eccf1300a7a821f11779316b2d962322dc","b5f269e60afc4569dc6edf93ece328087bfccb92","90bdb742437430f1c71048d6aad7eec9f43d6b88","0c57fcb20c5cbee892c1f71c7af20fb51393c024","66deaf847f396d02d61d83f7e5d400e877fdfb13","48c2ebb8071baf14b1e1f246d9d04e3ed255e0d8","7c6511476ce46224a3194db69de82258d0c2a455","c1762e8628476abc138f0e8cd4cd41e5abcd93ae","5f6116a1008636a429092769348205f49bdc67ca","de992e3a6d639c8c53f30aee333ca61ba39808ee","d788cf53678d58984f1de63c8e36a77a8737d835","d57d5f9bf6f14c492c61d1bfdbe35d89ac011ce2","a9e3bbca373033bd04327b2c5695c601a040f284","ad3ce20e63a7dc3b92c4f07e474a24af3c9748ff","f6c48fe1f598b7a357a94a789c2370a0729333d7","5fbe19c5c9b06c4f7b2e7b1143deb8c45cf04aa5","23dc65d99264f8faf56ee6d950e3f07051c40dd0","1a30e93447971585d270787965a7f231733e65f8","a5a9df52ccbd0f9b2af374fdc1c5370c70d31cae","bd1ef6a081a37906081f6908e6d8b522ce18e9cf","d0f1cdba08f4533c2c22b50b0e931fbed8579d0a","8186e280c0b4c25e50cb391f286d2c5e3a315333","7e0644951dc614841bf68b32e3671f71b8a70ea1","dfe0ae5c83177fcc03e6420520086063e36f8d51","60ee0e69c84214ab4314b0dd1893c9e5ffe6b4d6","22dbf20c9476985f9a30e783317cadde4dff1803","2da223dae0aa3f2a1dc701bd39b43c60f8798597","18361868252e63bd060b68244311d7eec2d244aa","d1930d748b9509c63c49d032c76f908d9c45a4e7","1d66e6bcf88b75127df5c3b99e06831fb8f1b2da","f73484c9ede489970771bc52a1f76af4b5937bef","5abc92c081f033859ce82f4cd9607f4f957d83b5","dc532fc622b8acd3390648831d6948936145e835","628e689b2f3b9eb826638ba1ae17475ee4cb1cff","6d7346e3e1f6e69831be4c86d9a8fc4724b91108","801dfc12c94f8245dad5b1fbe58f86352e28975b","1f0a6f9d696d26e24ec159dff95c7929d58b4f01","73ead05d0190eb0377f684248cae410a17918ba2","1ddf432efac526f524ea29cd4a0f1171d3bcd179","8f0bf44184b3af70b4d256d05de43ebff27d6044","5d9732e3651d10390a04ffeade848f7cce3d5d68","6067f9f70e92f77f5d75f777cca9dcc034d8be04","a8d4e7beddfc144f993bb3795c399d31b2a65f5c","c5fcb5e089bf3bb2d6afce7a2bdebd7460b8c40f","3f9443dfe7436b681a313b3f2670af08a45cbf06","34545539b58a1cf68d630fa0b50545a3464d5a85","97d3b0e21e5f863c252e2444866afa28f0996892","e4930ff3798d18ee9e39b40c139c3a0c89c8ba5b","612f1ed079584c1b889f1b1cf914b9f79d1c5b5e","c3598c28f2ba0a751d9bd5b6c3b99704637ed296","0371d8ce6c03d6d8f2cc883e626ed35e57eabc94","e3e0348e341df70fedcc7cebea60e54d70a77bbe","ddf65f459b4613155dde931c5b0ff776874e7ebd","a94925ea6f787c2dab1b118b2837fe11709a7ed9","19619c0818ef292e74edc83fc54d95be07877411","1cbe11961cc8d6a4b31f1530b05db3919dc2561d","7583908c6eec3891a44747cc82345c469e3a3658","7e267d300bbf63a2d2f291bcede106097aaa0b4b","9d7728776266826a2cd2b5dd60d411d9b285d807","2eea99170177f3536fdf50d78df77b82ea45758f","c5fa0958c4a3df4664f50e1b1924aa89038bb9d7","0ab951cc0e279bdc42a4acc6414026bc4aa94368","c418b8f94ff9f59d63c4d722deb83cc3af9671c1","2299363817efdde95bbd5df5e489edc9e1e2579c","f34489ab61da3b61f887c1fef2cf5f249fcf2129","3365c2b682910c3873bb65f834b378880613aec1","3afd501f6225f3fdaa88ebec97a9f339b1e7ca4f","d23d3137052d96c13d2a62b871398c06d8d7c3b2","ef69f814abb1c822577423bbd91e89f3612b07d9","2146db319bea5374364308b18f82abdf94a0ed35","a076686c75df0d51745d01589247e0d592f3bdc6"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Prevalence and characteristics of autistic spectrum disorders in the ALSPAC cohort.","doi":"10.1111/j.1469-8749.2008.03042.x","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-8749.2008.03042.x","venue":"Developmental medicine and child neurology"}

In spite of this, relatively little is known about the energetics of CO2 binding in these materials, and the limited calorimetric studies published to date have focused on materials made using molecular aminosilanes rather than amine polymers. In this work, poly(ethylenimine) (PEI) is impregnated within mesoporous SBA-15, and the heats of CO2 adsorption at 30 °C are investigated using a Tian-Calvet calorimeter with emphasis on the role of PEI loading and CO2 pressure in the compositional region relevant to direct capture of CO2 from ambient air. In parallel, CO2 uptakes of these materials are measured using multiple complementary approaches, including both volumetric and gravimetric methods, and distinct changes in uptake as a function of CO2 pressure and amine loading are observed. The CO2 sorption behavior is directly linked to textural data describing the porosity and PEI distribution in the materials.","inCitations":["77759bd1c2642e5c0051069268ca3b5c9daf3dfc","1f0a724a9fad807f39624eb78a3153e2b5076d5c","bcbc42bc0e345d4039e910f43d057a8f67f6e15d","31afad88cd440cc2e2f6d6d0a0600171f82fbeeb"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Adsorption Microcalorimetry of CO2 in Confined Aminopolymers.","doi":"10.1021/acs.langmuir.6b03793","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.langmuir.6b03793","venue":"Langmuir : the ACS journal of surfaces and colloids"}

On the other hand, as one of the 5G-promising techniques, the wireless caching enabled WiFi offloading technique is shown to be powerful in addressing the data explosion problem and alleviating the network congestion problem in macrocells. Consequently, challenges have been imposed in applying the cooperative caching schemes for maximizing the successful playback probability under statistical delay-bounded QoS constraints. To effectively overcome the above-mentioned problems, we propose the statistical QoS-driven power allocation scheme through applying the cooperative caching enabled WiFi offloading system over 5G big data mobile wireless networks. In particular, under the Nakagami- \\textit{m} fading model, we establish the system models for cooperative caching and wireless transmissions. Given the statistical QoS constraints, we derive and analyze the aggregate effective capacity and the successful playback probability under our developed optimal power allocation policies for the QoS-driven cooperative caching enabled WiFi offloading. Also conducted is a set of simulations which analyze and show the priority of our proposed cooperative caching enabled WiFi offloading scheme, compared with the schemes without cooperative caching in terms of effective capacity under statistical QoS constraints over 5G big data mobile wireless networks.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2018.8422370"],"title":"Statistical QoS-Driven Power Allocation for Cooperative Caching over 5G Big Data Mobile Wireless Networks","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2018.8422370","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2018.8422370","venue":"2018 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)"}

Transfer of 7-day-old seedlings from solutions at 22.5 °C to 10 °C doubled the ABA content per g fresh weight after 6 h and led to a S-fold increase by 24 h. Shorter incubations led to a 2.5-fold rise 2 h after the start of cooling. Root-cooling restricted leaf expansion rate but both the inhibition of leaf growth and the rise in ABA content were reversed when root temperature was returned to 22.5 °C. 2 h after transfer to control conditions half of the extra free ABA induced per leaf by root-cooling was no longer present. Excision of seedling lateral roots impeded leaf expansion and led to enhanced ABA content after 24 h. Petiole ringing experiments showed that the rapid rise in ABA was not due to blockage of export from the leaves of root-cooled plants, although export may have contributed to the fall in ABA when cooled seedlings were returned to 22.5 °C.","inCitations":["25139bbf56b547e87e3967fd944e157db1f12a3d","302f9c531a45e19a696e378178e7d85be9065b73","b76dd7187792d77e41887edb6fae5c3115b6ff4b","4d5d643048217eff0de659aabf89b3f935c262b9","2e8e647048988065af6da918642d8e896110ff56","e5bfb5d9036f6e465aaaafef1abbf05e50cd9352","8a5903ee20282458a24cc25b79bb86296730af6f","756633fb24168032e9fa6ef853517dac7f93c319","b375fedddad86cf409d02c33dfc83e03a7f6268d","872fb274f1904049d2a9b73a74367315cb5d25a4","dd496a99e5d368c786cd2f35c35b472eddae09f9","c62636186d12f4452b3387036a3199cefb64d3e6"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"The effects of root cooling and excision treatments on the growth of primary leaves of Phaseolus vulgar is L.","doi":"10.1111/j.1469-8137.1988.tb00265.x","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-8137.1988.tb00265.x","venue":""}

Comprendre les determinants des comportements de protection de l'environnement est donc important. Apres avoir expose les variables classiquement etudiees comme les variables de personnalite ou attitudinales, nous proposons deux axes de recherche adaptes a la specificite de notre objet d'etude portant sur des risques souvent presentes comme distants. Dans le premier axe, nous soutiendrons que la capacite a se projeter dans le temps permet de lier le comportement avec ses consequences futures pour l'environnement et devrait ainsi favoriser l'engagement pour la protection de l'environnement. Apres avoir expose le cadre conceptuel de la perspective temporelle, nous avons realise une revue de la litterature montrant qu'effectivement une orientation vers le futur est liee a davantage d'engagement en faveur de l'environnement. Nos etudes n'ont cependant pas retrouve ce lien. Nous avons par contre montre une correlation negative entre l'orientation vers le present fataliste ou le passe negatif et les comportements pro-environnementaux. L'importance d'autres variables a ete demontree lors de ces experiences comme les preoccupations environnementales, le rapport a la nature et l'implication culturelle. Dans le deuxieme axe, nous defendrons la posture inverse en soutenant que c'est en rapprochant la perception des risques environnementaux que l'on favorise les comportements pro-environnementaux. Apres avoir presente le cadre conceptuel de la distance psychologique et son lien avec les niveaux de construits, nous proposons deux etudes, l'une mesurant la distance percue vis-a-vis des problemes environnementaux et l'autre la manipulant. Ces etudes ont d'abord permis de caracteriser la distance percue vis-a-vis de differents problemes environnementaux, ceux-ci etant percus comme relativement proches sur toutes les dimensions a l'exception de la dimension sociale ou ils sont a la fois proches et distants. Nous avons ensuite montre qu'une distance proche est associee a davantage de preoccupations environnementales, a une evaluation comme plus reels et plus graves des risques et enfin a davantage d'intentions comportementales d'agir en faveur de l'environnement. Nous conclurons ce travail en mettant nos resultats en perspective et en proposant des applications en terme de communication sur les problemes environnementaux.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://tel.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-02513458/document"],"title":"Une approche psychosociale de la protection de l'environnement : Perspective temporelle et distance psychologique","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Moderate reduction of the hematocrit in the polycythemic group resulted in a significant increase in the magnitude and a delay in both left maximal spatial voltage (LMSV) and maximal anterior force. Raising the hematocrit in the anemic group decreased the magnitude of LMSV and maximal anterior force. A change in the orientation of the spatial vector frequently accompanied induced variations in the hematocrit. Experimental and theoretical studies suggest that alterations in the hematocrit and, hence, intracardiac electrical resistivity distort the magnitude and orientation of the surface-recorded QRS voltages. It is postulated that the effect of high intracavitary blood hematocrit in polycythemia in reducing early QRS voltages is due to its influence on...","inCitations":["718f3390147027450999d1e215f1d9cc6c8067d6","75415e177a2787ba301dc82ee38968be37a91d72","cf977c2b380f01ebd278d2f38f3cfea9e17a03c5","84d30e2a3a53b51e8e8b500ac3ecf21ceed32c5d","2e90b3b48262faea20f7dd024cbac9d00de15bb9","30bb621176b3a96a2e69860c365d7173a81a070f","dbedfce7fc581f9313b2118638aa6f1c318f468d","ba4073c34a9904135be1b6c44fd851ab20c8e66f","4469c98379965abaa2d19fbe45d825e8031d362e","22dbf09a678ea83ec1c49acdabd59acd3a3c9958","adba149d518f5cca82cf09b56ece9eee2a8e89a8","972962e8fcf36561f6c07f9083f286d6406c9906"],"pdfUrls":["http://circ.ahajournals.org/content/circulationaha/44/3/456.full.pdf","http://circ.ahajournals.org/content/circulationaha/44/3/456.full.pdf?download=true"],"title":"Influence of acute variations in hematocrit on the QRS complex of the Frank electrocardiogram.","doi":"10.1161/01.CIR.44.3.456","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1161/01.CIR.44.3.456","venue":"Circulation"}

However, the estimated Markowitz portfolio rule and most of its extensions not only underperform the naive 1/N rule (that invests equally across N assets) in simulations, but also lose money on a risk-adjusted basis in many real data sets. In this paper, we propose an optimal combination of the naive 1/N rule with one of the four sophisticated strategies--the Markowitz rule, the Jorion (1986) rule, the MacKinlay and Pastor (2000) rule, and the Kan and Zhou (2007) rule--as a way to improve performance. We find that the combined rules not only have a significant impact in improving the sophisticated strategies, but also outperform the 1/N rule in most scenarios. Since the combinations are theory-based, our study may be interpreted as reaffirming the usefulness of the Markowitz theory in practice.","inCitations":["62438b5ff4b62555b383ed9b7b3799481e227a3e","19513e0364d9e58d0eeac21b6babc675736482d4","f4d8d762a5fc06c1bff18e6da4b922367bbd2326","274ccb3d03c867f39e31d63fef258f19e41f4cc7","763f6f91d5c9283a144b91f5463f581825d9e060","a3be11218a65a5d2907888ee2e8c482ce0248115","d999bc99a3f50661679335d3975fceb914a2e199","0c5841d85482d05e4261d7a1f9a9538d8e80a598","98991a62fbf1ba2c15121cdc93b7249da9b8f078","bc6fd32bc614cbe983aae5de890e22de5e8b1fe3","e6116cc2d09c33635a55c1a3e5d5594fe1008b25","d4bb2171466d9c53b0cc7b147b6f778fb6f6547c","d3d96ee6754bbb345b51cc4b21b13b466787dd8f","f0d9805f81bc01ddf32388c9d2d957c5ca1feca8","31aab04092bf41ca7bd28feff42fc2ca735923bb","3c4576c0f94997866a61779bac50577cd6690360","e4fb6124276779ca7581825bde4e2f17ae2eaa4b","ccb33b721e9b2e3ded6964fd08ddaeccceec3520","865ec987b877039a955f46af33c6da8966cb875b","2ef2973004c56bc37fe1f602a1ccf08a98a743c9","5d5d7a9f3980b63fcaa804cfce56292e4d689033","3f3316dd6f975935860c71a9f78f6154895cd32f","fbd64d341516cc6e6d0d94332da3bd9c69b4847b","557d096e57d0a1dd483dfb20e75b13ac23f12608","bb559175a8b08913906d3560d8c20e70a38ed8f2","7d6d90e2f21ae4e7943596377eb25c96cbf654de","ff9e459046e3e43aefde65a423329e146704d40a","b93e077f4f8d2822564769787ff2c467cb8c6095","e213b0880b08c15810e44080a4542524fec652b8","4dca033184e05ee35e481a9cd252b8dfdbab7410","5018b3ade568485690ed14cf6cfedc69239dc1b9","ba9cf9293ccf9bf25cb08a0ee9d2cacf96421f77","338a654cd3a7f87ce9b23174b993b0f63b408b6c","2773e3aabc5abc98f52648585687e2f269b8fa81","2f1054a04946edf36f1d52d16b1f2c81c70c37e5","5a2ef53ecd696feaefbc31f3aad91692c1914912","f7be65c2cfdb34f7dc20235c222161dfebf47ed4","7800d0f0c236d303febe7ed1745e31ca846f4b53","407d24f06a5323551ed128e18d438f5844b020b5","540b9c2e8df3198342626c2ecb5698bded18d04f","85fd643d7b7503f658e15405e988ecbd332a7841","e2a9f62ee693f98d34332ba96d3dfea6c493dd0b","523b0cc408e67f37b8d987632ca6263bf8584c9b","55614e15c092808fe82ca2cf9c93ff9a55a5de77","7cbf8d3c5422fcc38cbed1f31ae23e3a83ef529a","5af0f9fe4707dce54238b7f82f46c7d2c7ab858c","d800ab8b170506d82e488b5e46ffab3656fd4b76","8cae8787209e1bd7de808c0f1598d633cc9cae9b","61487a5b1bb9ffa08975caa3df1cde97a574bce1","845ad6e145a589969e0faf866bfd801cca3b0f5d","918610c3d7117fece4bf393d3b8553626f0bbf33","23e25a3ba2bae0fae5ef6925f6ce9cbfe490efcb","f44d9ed076f398bda1bd7c34a713a0c66b3e0767","68b150803e3d48c0992952c9bfa2a47f9f8f26c7","2adc0a03560c3c7a5c42919f8e102628d5c5a705","c8d5824298a7f85afb47ea542229a58d87639aa2","2bb791536920c6ed9f1d311bd87a2af2b1d1ead1","f768fac97907ec02ade591af841f9f71a530c957","46a3a9dfa232d77631813289f3a423f0e4ebf2df","ffdb6738936913c78c4b19d590c48ef27106f325","b3a907646d3998701beaf221c1eaa3d82006912f","a20f6191f1a53a7d8451868cdce42277220d5c5b","8c95503482cf0289d5d8578ffe157502aa21d861","cff9d6a7e4329dfcfc079b7a5b167d95767c252a","dc33501a6fb88d11ecfa51ef629217173c06c6a2","f2d72a990b1a80c81d3e03a754a78087183460d6","6895396046c9ef67d15071b2d03833f048f5e00f","45cdce562ed8ea591234b7645484bcb1ca01ae9c","fec793a566de98989ccc6c67b46841bc4e91c681","b0e33a41801deba4a9967613a05a5371c1db4f2e","784c4616d03d2b09c9200002224ba6369ecebf80","a80ad0aadd8fb1f702d79861f42281a250300831","215da5058eb3ed7f82c372511ad848f0a67feff6","15263d6ec9c3487f069c7995e048658d657635ef","ef03ee953a26c31c7961e5d1fdba20f4ada99f7b","5f32246803d4d165be7c2abc5797029c4b341e58","ef6a34e55d32a99f78949d3c51ed6170598728d2","20968c8c658e4ea80c7980e629aaed038499ee0f","cf5c9523a79c096ebb3551e899c5585ea7e0a145","7b3b2c1f471a39dc466eed4aeefbd33ff9b9bdee","4d01b428b1eb799b0d578eb5ffbee6a20e8315ae","0fbe229ac6debaf75a58394a9ffbca7a66e90084","c2641e5ad2892a78626e6fc61724b41ba715d26a","38788da9131bf8619e0c6a32eaefb1240abab8c1","13759c2e5a6b57934214a926223075d48e7bb761","20b9459993413cd8ef4d4ac53f0991eac6ea0af1","d75c5fe1375585e56a5659035e234e0ede94d753","2135a9bd10e81bb73d788cdfcd367d9bfeefd266","8588d868cc98c4bbdcce0e25ceb96b60adfcf39c","cdc6b2d7bdddb8cecfd088eca9df33f9af157d4e","78a00e2b2a5d1af59670512369b8136db4ae166e","a683548fbf8219b2b2113eed38925149996577ba","b709f3eec8e4d6aa8163c03177e53bd9e50b5365","82980377f1124697223ceb35de3d42d9a9a4f1cf","c5c57f6b7014749c4f9b1723d87eeddd02713b2c","85537d0b6bffd56c028b5814f3bc89e177d263d6","43237f4156ebd7b9d1947d5dd211dab866834d34","077ddb9a5aaa10a02f4d1ec5bc1f4dd743c180f9","b825e1d45dbfe48613136f209cc6ce59f6a4a7da","e114b63fc8802d34eb31fc54ba8221f81cc6ff9f","03550b2556b4a708734247d20154de05740dc549","08e025e2f245571eb1050ee8cc5e1fed312231dc","4aae2ca567bf3863c581077d45ef2bc2d99c4b95","20c73e06eb4dec6d618012e0bb9906fb3b1562c0","296faf8683cf088dd9ea0c452af532ecedc9ef11","d5a78af747181677adb17b4927246d234323566c","24b8cd70c042ace78db54e5c45c34af2febecaca","ac112423470ce3c5b7b5486f4c41d9d18b2d7923","4266770d544d054d5e8ba3f2a72219824d7047bf","6aa58baed3e717fd845069bf0e48a9a77708c369","b22d0261be53d609aaaacdc7ad03299e03bdf12d","8e439111f2f45d32ca7b89520615a50cd5f6e659","edda23db037ad04f2012f3c998b13d668595b844","e9e553e97175bcf74abc20cfa18246ad64fc5b67","e620b781bb2ac4f7994fad3700c748bc92549b84","62f7a944b19aba3cb8c7ee8933d9

In many cases, new demands in software can often be met by extending the functionality of systems already in operation. By modularizing volatile requirements that can be altered at the client’s initiative or according to market demands, we can build a stepping-stone for management of requirements change. The volatility must be managed in a way that reduces the time and costs associated with updating a system to meet the new requirements. In this chapter, we present an approach for handling volatile concerns during early life cycle software modeling. The key insight is that techniques for aspect-oriented software development can be applied to modularize volatility and to weave volatile concerns into the base software artifacts.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q59418388"],"title":"Using Aspects to Model Volatile Concerns","doi":"10.1007/978-3-642-38640-4_10","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-38640-4_10","venue":"Aspect-Oriented Requirements Engineering"}

Due to minimal background activity and very high signal-to-noise ratios, oocytes are often used to evaluate the function, structure and signal transduction pathways of a variety of different proteins. One such group of proteins are the water channels, or aquaporins. Of particular note, studies in Xenopus oocytes have contributed to our understanding of an inherited form of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. However, as highlighted by Leduc-Nadeau et al. (2010) in a recent issue of The Journal of Physiology, caution should be taken in interpreting the results of studies on membrane proteins in Xenopus oocytes.","inCitations":["ea3cda6b754d3d888d9f79f97985d8fbec1338b7","1cd1531f19f527c02a1f2928d7ef7f32e4f25fcb","098b5f878c683596d7616f1ea783a9e1c1209668","319f8bcae17d468085b54059c64432b0faa91a43"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Can one Bad Egg' really spoil the batch?","doi":"10.1113/jphysiol.2010.192732","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1113/jphysiol.2010.192732","venue":"The Journal of physiology"}

The Berezin number of operator A is the following number: ber(A) := sup {∣∣∣Ã(λ)∣∣∣ : λ ∈ Ω} . Clearly, ber(A) w(A), where w(A) = sup{|〈Ax,x〉| : x ∈ H , ‖x‖H = 1} is the numerical radius of A. The power inequality for the numerical radius of Hilbert space operator A is the following: w(A) (w(A)) , ∀n 1. Since ber(A) w(A), the following question naturally arises: is it true that ber(An) (ber(A)) for any operator A and any integer n > 1? Although we do not solve this question, in this paper, by using some Hardy type inequality, we prove the inverse power inequality for ber(A) for positive operators on H (Ω); namely, we prove that (ber(A)) C(n,m)ber(An) for any positive operator A on H (Ω), where C(n,m) > 1 is the constant depending only on n and its conjugate m , where n + 1 m = 1.","inCitations":["654f3c0b2de79490e301d6f1799e5a00d69a8003"],"pdfUrls":["http://files.ele-math.com/articles/jmi-12-76.pdf","http://files.ele-math.com/abstracts/jmi-12-76-abs.pdf"],"title":"On the inverse power inequality for the Berezin number of operators","doi":"10.7153/jmi-2018-12-76","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.7153/jmi-2018-12-76","venue":""}

longitudinal research focusing on industry decline. Our analysis suggests that the literature’s general reliance on a few meta-theoretical arguments has important consequences for how decline is framed and explained. We identify four meta-theoretical clusters in the literature: politics and market dynamics are seen as exogenous factors with deterministic features, whereas technology and management capabilities are framed as firm-internal failures with causally questionable explanations of how firm-level characteristics explain industry-level decline. We propose that it is important to understand the limitations of distinct meta-theoretical arguments for an enhanced theoretical and methodological understanding of what industry decline is, how it takes place, and why. Accordingly, this study contributes to business history research by restructuring and clarifying latent theoretical issues, demonstrating the pros and cons of researchers’ choices, and offering guidelines and propositions for researchers interested in industry decline.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://jyx.jyu.fi/bitstream/handle/123456789/56401/industrydecline05062017.pdf?isAllowed=y&sequence=1"],"title":"Thinking about industry decline: A qualitative meta-analysis and future research directions","doi":"10.1080/00076791.2017.1340943","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1080/00076791.2017.1340943","venue":""}

In addition, the method was designed to detect cannabidiol and cannabinol, two naturally occurring cannabinoids. Plasma and urine samples were hydrolyzed with bacterial (Escherichia coli) beta-glucuronidase and extracted with hexane-ethyl acetate (7:1). Analysis and quantitation were performed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry in the electron ionization mode coupled with selected ion monitoring. The cannabinoids were detected as their trimethylsilyl derivatives to enhance their chromatographic separation and mass spectral characteristics. The linearity of the procedure was excellent for all of the compounds within the range tested (0-100 ng/mL). Limits of detection ranged from 0.5 to 1.5 ng/mL in urine and from 0.6 to 2.1 ng/mL in plasma depending on the analyte.","inCitations":["17dab61a6e7a7dfa574f4218de4b69bd9091a59d","9d56ae3c6dd5afd89bd0588b2199a1a25ad93713","c4017baff1ca1cdab528d0fdfdd145cf9051f4c9","6f8c299524b51ce37a4e336455e10f8b35b63b32","47936d2453bcc4d7ea70e5f730aae6f967628de7","3467a5c6d463ca1a6fa9b2051875023f0119e223","eeefe1ffc9720f118a5eb786f1dc8e5ebdfec384","268ebdc75026393c5677a187b2bf7bfe9daae9c1","d04b46416e292abc386de00039ccbbd926cb48b9","bac7b35cf2a5181fb0229a5a64daf4904852c561","a6609e559a730f8ea0965d6aada49a209a61b6fd","5868c5653bd970116eaf59db694cbc40f76217f0","7a17e574f6e3c332077e41ba494b4b70f4125179","c796def4d16e3ecc39d06613e33c47e9a79aaf3c","fac9d3f83a8a13cf114f34fee039aaed00866ff8","7e371be567158b2822745d5303a9283fe247f14d","8d37f603c551f2fa9f9ca4958769b9e531064088","65c6ba65a5f5b95d95b23703198bab76bee1fddf","b3cadc5f6470ca078d222748c5138208f0ec5ed9","cec572eb8e26eaf902ec2aa813aba00faf8c0a86","cc6056910a7f2968ee3a8254446d5db131fef4b6","41ea7d44ff795ddbaddeea430df8dc555b2560ac","c87feccd45219c0dfd170dbccba394172ef7d680","22e8acbb89449c9fb6dd8aaf2c068b4191e606f9","3e622082da284d7ca10cb6a2ad2a233724fb67fd","df626079945f3dcbfe3fc236529cdeacd8f0f2ab","79af0b75a73437ee706c6804689df2dfe21fa92b","079a5956577a42496442bd0eefb41eb6a1f42718","3fba77d349b7f1d446f9f42c21b78f380d11b1b3"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Cannabinoids in humans.

However, comparison can provide more if, as dialectologists, we consider that variation between closely genealogically related languages throws light on diachronic reconstruction. Indeed, if diatopic variation represents different stages of a change, then different dialects in a homogeneous area display different stages of the evolution and the speakers’ I-language for the earlier stages becomes accessible.\nConsidering the Null ‘Subject’ Parameter, we focus on the dialects at the boundaries of Occitania since they display subject clitics for some persons only. Our data illustrate the gradual change between a stage zero (with no subject clitics, e.g. Latin) and a stage n (with subject clitics for all persons, e.g. Standard French). Analyzing clitics as bundles of features, we propose a progression in their emergence, which ties in with a functional ‘motivational cycle’ of the morpho-syntactic elements.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Typology or reconstruction","doi":"10.1075/rllt.3.14oli","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1075/rllt.3.14oli","venue":""}

Dibawah bimbingan Hendarko Sugondo dan Erry Wiryani. \nKeberadaan kera ekor panjang di Kawasan Kebun Binatang Tinjomoyo sedikit banyak berbeda dengan kera ekor panjang yang hidup di hutan bebas. Hal ini tidak terlepas dari pengaruh pengunjung yang dapat merubah habitat, makanan dan waktu istirahat. \nPenelitian ini bertujuan untuk mengetahui struktur umur, sex-ratio, kerapatan populasi, dan perilaku makan satwa kera ekor panjang. Bertempat di Kawasan Kebun Binatang Tinjomoyo Semarang. Menggunakan metode \"Consentrasion Count\" untuk menentukan jumlah populasi, struktur umur, sex-ratio dan kerapatan populasi satwa kera ekor panjang. Sedangkan untuk perilaku makan dilakukan survei langsung ke lokasi. Hubungan antara jumlah wisatawan dan jumlah aktitas pemberian [pakan oleh wisatawan dianalisa dengan analisa regresi dan korelasi. \nHasil dari penelitian ini diketahui jumlah anggota populasi kera ekor panjang sebanyak 47 ekor dengan kerapatan 470 per Km2. Sex-ratio jantan betina 1 : 1,2. Kera ekor panjang memperoleh makanan dari pohon yang tersedia di Kawasan Kebun Binatang (7 jenis), petugas (6 jenis) dan dari wisatawan. Tidak terdapat ketergantungan kera ekor panjang terhadap wisatawan dalam hal mendapatkan makanan. \n \ni iii \nThis do4ument is Undip Institutional Repository Collection.
