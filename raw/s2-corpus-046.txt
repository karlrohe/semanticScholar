Despite the success of seismic acquisition at ever greater depths, there are marine geological terrenes in which the interpretation of seismic data is difficult, such regions dominated by scattering or high reflectivity that is characteristic of carbonate reefs, volcanic cover and submarine permafrost. A marine controlled-source electromagnetic (CSEM) method has recently been applied to the oil and gas exploration thanks to its high-resistivity characteristics of the hydrocarbon. In particular, this method produces better results in terms of sensitivity under the deep water environment rather than the shallow water. Only in the last five years has the relevance of CSEM been recognized by oil companies who now use it to help them make exploration drilling decisions. Initial results are most promising and several contractors now offer magnetotelluric and CSEM services.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Marine Controlled-source Electromagnetic Surveys for Hydrocarbon Exploration","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

However, in most published papers of clinical prediction models, the point estimates of the prediction accuracy measures are corrected by adequate bootstrap-based correction methods, but their confidence intervals are not corrected, e.g., the DeLong’s confidence interval is usually used for assessing the Cstatistic. These naïve methods do not adjust for the optimism bias and do not account for statistical variability in the estimation of parameters in the prediction models. Therefore, their coverage probabilities of the true value of the prediction accuracy measure can be seriously below the nominal level (e.g., 95%). In this article, we provide two generic bootstrap methods, namely (1) location-shifted bootstrap confidence intervals and (2) two-stage bootstrap confidence intervals, that can be generally applied to the bootstrapbased optimism correction methods, i.e., the Harrell’s bias correction, 0.632, and 0.632+ methods. In addition, they can be widely applied to various methods for prediction model development involving modern shrinkage methods such as the ridge and lasso regressions. Through numerical evaluations by simulations, the proposed confidence intervals showed favourable coverage performances. Besides, the current standard practices based on the optimism-uncorrected methods showed serious undercoverage properties. To avoid erroneous results, the optimism-uncorrected confidence intervals should not be used in practice, and the adjusted methods are recommended instead. We also developed the R package predboot for implementing these methods (https://github.com/nomahi/predboot). The effectiveness of the proposed methods are illustrated via applications to the GUSTO-I clinical trial.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.01457v3.pdf"],"title":"Confidence intervals of prediction accuracy measures for multivariable prediction models based on the bootstrap-based optimism correction methods","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Con un creciente enfasis en la capacidad del BID de hacer aportes no financieros efectivos a sus prestatarios, ha habido un enfoque importante en como incrementar el impacto en el desarrollo de las CTs. Esto implica equilibrar la demanda de los clientes con el propio punto de vista de la institucion sobre las prioridades a nivel de pais y region. El BID se ha esforzado por lograr este equilibrio y por implementar sistemas de apoyo para administrar y monitorear las CTs de manera efectiva. Desde 2008, la definicion y la clasificacion de las CTs y las guias sobre como manejarlas han cambiado casi una vez por ano. El Acuerdo del BID-9 reflejo la intencion de hacer esta area de trabajo del BID mas efectiva, y un mandato mas especifico para analizar la posibilidad de brindar servicios remunerados en el futuro. Esta evaluacion identifico varias areas en las que existen constantes problemas relacionados con las CTs, algunos de los cuales se relacionan con los productos de conocimiento del BID a nivel mas general. Primero, la alineacion estrategica entre las CTs y los productos de prestamo debe fortalecerse; esto ha mejorado un poco en los programas anuales del pais, pero debe seguir fortaleciendose en las periodicas Estrategias de Pais y a nivel general. Segundo, la administracion de las CTs es complicada por las diversas limitaciones impuestas en la asignacion inter e intrasectorial, tanto de capital ordinario como de los fondos fiduciarios de donantes, y los esfuerzos de la Administracion del BID para encontrar las formas de solucionar estas limitaciones han tenido un exito limitado, como es evidenciado por la subutilizacion de los recursos disponibles. Tercero, el BID no tiene un sistema para monitorear e informar sobre los resultados de las CTs, y esto debe ser rectificado debido a su importancia para la efectividad en el desarrollo. Cuarto, el desarrollo de propuestas de servicios remunerados ha sido lento, aunque ahora algo de progreso parece probable. Finalmente, la accesibilidad a informes y estudios es un problema de larga data, aunque la Administracion, recientemente, comenzo a tratar esto de manera mas sistematica con el desarrollo de un nuevo sistema de acceso a los datos.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"IDB-9: Productos de Conocimiento","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

A simulation of the summing circuit using 0.18 µm channel lengths leads to a rise time of less than 30 ps and good linearity. When used as a high-gain amplifier, both devices of the active cascode stage must be biased into the active region. In the summing circuit, one device is biased into the triode region whereas the second device must operate in the active region. Guidelines for achieving proper bias with a single bias source are provided in this work.","inCitations":["0a7475b07d29c83b505029bf30e8eccd49335793","43496b543b20a88d78d96440cf031a68bb95e951","063755408946f0659e8eb025899c42f0818271f6","0a8c8ee6ecded5785b99e4f54b0b6666a9e7f981","826ba924cd7b18755115c8b2cd5a4b4c5c78f0df","5f1acf4a6bc4c0e5ee64111588742a258275fb47","416258bdd412592e60fb8e028c5414d66ff63581","6bf1a7a70731753f53f7054171203f0295050797","311de7269c81f3c58843b923e7fb7b76f6d3fd9c","e86de80e6162b3399d61a4878c59c75e739d7dc3","57d0269e30f11d250ff17181c08340e64c807e45","13bb9df4d39fd48f066f11b3448c1d4199ecf7d8","8a6e081c6124e8860fda84acf4fdbecf5d412e9b","a2366fc78f85b64078a035668fa2b5794717325c","f8b0edc09425f71d37a045121e36e4accbba554b","8d4e8ec6f6f293e531468c5f6beff156a5591055","20c41e71c109b2e2dd092cbd2d1be5f24ea1e46c","285b4040b198427100a7b6ab50380387898e4fe3","c1630fff3d07ca57daff7fa2acac9b081566adcb","ced42f49b115b0ac4c1895ac59c1179de2b1d143","765b9ee2f10b8c6d0a2516149bec05718ad8b8de"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"The utility of the composite cascode in analog CMOS design","doi":"10.1080/00207210412331314196","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1080/00207210412331314196","venue":""}

Adult males and parents of small children consult physicians with a self-diagnosis of micropenis. This potential diagnosis creates significant anxiety in parents. However, simply by conducting a urogenital examination and by measuring the penis size, diagnosis can be validated. Determining whether the penis size is within a normal range can serve to reduce anxiety and protect patients from redundant surgical operations. In recent years, various tissue flaps are being used for the surgical treatment of micropenis. In parallel to developments in microsurgery, free flaps incorporating sensory nerves are being preferred. Prosthetic implantations are currently the best solution for generating erection after the application of tissue flap. However, these implantations differ significantly from penile prostheses used for erectile dysfunction. We must wait for the sensation recovery of the phallus prior to the implantation of the prosthesis, and three-piece inflatable prostheses must be preferred. Even though contemporary successful operations provide sufficient results for patients, obtaining an erection in phalloplasty patients remains to be the subject of ongoing research.

FBC is an emerging energy technology that holds promise for both high efficiency of energy conversion and minimization of adverse air-quality impacts. A major advantage of FBC is that high-sulfur coal can be burned without the use of flue-gas desulfurization equipment to meet air-quality standards. The solid residues that are generated in an FBC unit are usually larger in volume and have different properties than the typical bottom ash from a conventional boiler.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Assessment of fluidized-bed-combustion solid wastes for land disposal.

Antiarrhythmic drug therapy had been attempted with various drugs (including bisoprolol, sotalol and amiodarone) without success. A detailed analysis of several 12-lead ECGs revealed that the tachycardia seemed to originate either from the superior vena cava or the right superior pulmonary vein. A transesophageal echocardiography and a multi-detector spiral computed tomography (MDCT, Sensation 64, Siemens Medical Solutions, Forchheim, Germany) were performed prior to the ablation procedure. Thereby, an enormous lipomatous hypertrophy of the interatrial septum (LHAS) was revealed (Fig. 1). The entity known as lipomatous hypertrophy of the atrial septum is in fact a lipoma characterized by excess accumulation of mature adipose tissue forming a recognizable mass which exceeds 2 cm in diameter [1]. Since the patient was highly symptomatic, catheter ablation was attempted despite this difficult situation. A three-dimensional (3-D) MDCT reconstruction of both atria was generated and displayed in the Navx system (St. Jude Medical, Saint Paul, MN, USA) in a synchronized manner during the ablation procedure (Fig. 2). Careful analysis of the 3-D MDCT reconstruction revealed that the superior vena cava and the right superior pulmonary vein were significantly dislodged by the lipoma.

However, the effect of bio-improvement on sand weakens due to water submergence. Therefore, it is necessary to explore the techniques for retaining the strength of bio-improved sand in water submerged state. So, this paper reports the geotechnical performance of submerged bio-improved sand reinforced by discrete natural fibres. The desert sand sampled from Al-Sharqia Desert of Oman, bio-improved by xanthan gum and reinforced by discrete natural fibres obtained from date palm tree. Date palm fibres having a diameter less than 0.2mm and length 1cm were employed for sand reinforcement. Vane shear tests and standard compaction tests were performed on specimens having different mix ratios of sand-xanthan gum with and without natural fibres. The qualitative description of bio-improvement and fibre reinforcement effect on the desert sand is also presented as the photomicrographs taken by field emission scanning electron microscope. According to the results of strength tests at higher moisture content state, the discrete fibre reinforcement has enhanced the geotechnical performance of sand improved at lower concentrations.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Vane shear strength of bio-improved sand reinforced with natural fibre","doi":"10.1051/e3sconf/20199212004","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1051/e3sconf%2F20199212004","venue":""}

In order to overcome this shortcoming, the effect of material and process variables on the degree of foaming and the growth behavior of the gas bubbles was studied by using polyolefins, such as polypropylene (PP), low density polyethylene (LDPE), and high density polyethylene (HDPE). These materials were foamed in extrusion process with a blowing agent consisting of sodium bicarbonate and citric acid. A higher degree of foaming was obtained with a low temperature of cooling water and high melt temperature. The take-up speed did not influence the degree of foaming. It was also observed from cell morphologies that the size of the gas bubbles was reduced with increased take-up speed and decreased melt temperature, but the size of the gas bubbles was nearly invariant as the temperature of the cooling water increased. In addition, the effects of the molecular weight, the molecular structure, the melt viscosity, and the melt tension on the degree of foaming and the growth of the gas bubbles were investigated. It was revealed that the degree of foaming and the size of the gas bubbles were directly related to the melt tension of the polymer melt, regardless of the structure and the molecular weight of the polymer resin and the temperature of the polymer melt. This implies that the ability to sustain the cell in the melt state is a critical foaming parameter in the extrusion process. © 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

Although education plays a central role in the development of human innovation skills, several studies suggest that higher education institutions cannot fulfill these demands. In such, there is a need to update pedagogical practices and develop assessment tools to measure and develop a person’s innovation capacity. The aim of this study is to test and evaluate the functioning of the earlier developed assessment tool to measure students’ innovation competences in the authentic learning environments of Finnish higher education institutions. The electronic self-assessment questionnaire was distributed to students (n = 495) from four Finnish universities of applied sciences. The results showed that the questionnaire statements formed a functional innovation competence barometer for self-assessment, including creative problem-solving, systems thinking, goal orientation, teamwork, and networking competences. The assessment tool facilitates the development of teaching, assessing, and curriculum design in higher education.","inCitations":["c7c15190d7b5a0d6988467554a721489a3b5d246","ac1e001644d926538295451d640c93d666495606","4ee02cbb814059e25d6e4d3d526bca41e4713927","3587e503ae6097c4574c15bd7749755cd75a73ec","a70c6a1c43a30953cab44e2bd27990d52d5a1cfb","0019a881429045b211ce050c5ecbcae563e2f370","840309df240c690cd9bb952dd9730c251c70599b"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"How to measure students’ innovation competences in higher education: Evaluation of an assessment tool in authentic learning environments","doi":"10.1016/j.stueduc.2018.05.007","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.stueduc.2018.05.007","venue":""}

Long Term Evolution (LTE) has developed small cellular base stations called femtocells that can dramatically improve voice and data coverage for the indoor subscribers. Therefore, the concept of deploying femtocells over macrocell has recently attracted growing interests in academia, industry, and standardization forums. Various technical challenges towards mass deployment of femtocells have been addressed in recent literature. However, the interand intra tier interferences in such systems can significantly reduce the capacity and cause an unacceptably high level of outage. In this paper we propose a scheme which mitigates co-tier as well as cross tier interference using cluster aware soft frequency reuse scheme. That assigns distinct set of Physical Resource Blocks (PRB)s to each interfering femtocells. The scheme first uses periodic messages from the femto-user (FUE) to identify the interfering femtocells. It then divides each femtocell area into cell-center and cell-edge. Finally, it uses the CASFR algorithm to assign un interfering sets of PRBs to the cell-center and cell-edge users of all the interfering femtocells Same process is followed by macrocells. The proposed interference mitigation scheme for femtocell networks offers significant performance improvement over the existing methods by substantially reducing the co-tier and cross-tier inferences in the system.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Intercell Interference and Cross Tier Interference Mitigation in LTE based Femtocell Network using 'CASFR' Scheme","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

In stark contrast to previously studied γ-silyl-substituted systems, the preferred reaction pathway is 1,3-γ-silyl elimination, giving ring closure over solvent substitution or alkene formation. The scope of this cyclopropanation reaction is explored for numerous cyclic and acyclic examples, proving this method to be a viable approach to preparing CF3-substituted cyclopropanes and bicyclic systems, both containing quaternary centres. Rate-constants, kinetic isotope effects, and quantum mechanical calculations provided evidence for this enhancement and further elaborated the disparity in the reaction outcome between these systems and previously studied γ-silyl systems.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://www.rsc.org/suppdata/sc/c4/c4sc01732c/c4sc01732c3.pdf","http://www.rsc.org/suppdata/sc/c4/c4sc01732c/c4sc01732c1.pdf"],"title":"1,3-γ-Silyl-elimination in electron-deficient cationic systems","doi":"10.1039/C4SC01732C","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1039/C4SC01732C","venue":""}

Current pharmacologic treatments involve DA replacement using the precursor molecule levodopa. An alternative treatment, called deep brain stimulation (DBS), has recently gained attention as a treatment for drug-resistant cases of PD. However, the cellular mechanism of DBS remains unclear. An increasingly popular research technique known as optogenetics involves the insertion of light-sensitive channels into specific groups of cells and subsequent activation using exposure to light. Optogenetics can be used in PD models to mimic DBS and uncover the effects of stimulation on the neural circuits involved in PD. The goal of this project was twofold. First, the larvae of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster were used to develop a novel PD model that replicates some of the hallmark symptoms of PD. Second, optogenetics was used to directly manipulate the activity of dopaminergic neurons in the brains of these larval PD models.

They enjoy a technical heritage that still thrives in the fields of handicrafts, furniture and simple rural huts among the poor rural communities in Egypt. This qualifies them to be developed for contemporary construction that matches the modern lifestyle of the youth. This paper aims to develop low-cost date palm midribs building components for light and sustainable wide-span multi-purpose structures for rural communities. This is achieved firstly by selecting a primary design that respects the natural shape and lightness of the material. The primary design selected was a 12 m span tri-arched space truss system as a semi-form active structure that utilized traditional palm midribs crates techniques such as bundling and friction-based joinery. Secondly, the conceptual design was developed in order to enhance the design ability for mass production, stability, and aesthetic enhancement. Thirdly, an exploratory physical model was built to visualize and develop the practical design of the building components. This process simulated the building sequence and tackled the details of the building components. The physical model showed that the proposed system allowed multiple alterations and high flexibility, showed promising durability and well balanced visual composition with a unique spatial experience that reflect the traditional essence of the material in a modern fashion. The work presented is a part of the undergoing validation process of date palm midribs wide-span building components, to introduce the material a sustainable alternative for the poor rural communities in Egypt.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Development of sustainable building components utilizing date palm midribs for light wide-span multi-purpose structures for rural communities in Egypt","doi":"10.1016/j.jobe.2019.100770","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jobe.2019.100770","venue":""}

In both cases, it interprets this new orthodoxy as a conscious attempt to break out of the previous pattern of capitalist development, as well as the social and political framework which sustained it. This long-term objective accounts for the huge and, in purely technical terms seemingly unnecessary, scale of social cuts. The experience of the United Kingdom, Argentina and Chile are examined from this perspective; the historical background for each of these monetarist experiences is described in some detail. \n \n \n \nRESUMENMonetarismo en Gran Bretana y en el Cono Sur: una resena \n \n \n \nEste articulo analiza tanto las pautas comunes como las diferencias de la ‘nueva ortodoxia’ monetarista aplicada en Gran Bretana y el Cono Sur de America Latina.

The human renal-cancer cells used in this study were of 3 strains: ACHN, VMRC-RCW and NT. When each line was cultured in medium containing no 5-FU, the supernatant showed almost no activity for stimulating DNA synthesis. However, when the line was cultured in the presence of 5-FU, the supernatant showed autocrine growth-promoting activity which strongly stimulated DNA synthesis of 3 renal-cancer cell lines in a dose-dependent manner. Activity could be detected in a 4- to 6-kDa fraction by gel filtration. This fraction increased the DNA-synthesis-promoting activity of epidermal growth factor, transforming growth factor-beta, basic fibroblast growth factor and insulin, and was acid- and heat-stable. It was also stable against pepsin and dithiothreitol. DNA synthesis in BALB/c 3T3, adult rat hepatocytes and rabbit renal tubular cells was not affected by this fraction which was thus considered not to affect non-cancerous cells. Renal-cell carcinoma responds poorly to anticancer agents, and the autocrine activity of the fraction may possibly be a factor accounting for this resistance.","inCitations":["44e46d3413423a1dd8d987c6360d646906a17251","b4ff4de8a697732b7b321471a1b9e94d5f08235c","034cc667cd03ece398bbf559023f184735670c0c"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Secretion of autocrine growth-promoting activity by renal-carcinoma cells treated with 5-fluorouracil.","doi":"10.1002/ijc.2910520119","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1002/ijc.2910520119","venue":"International journal of cancer"}

The expression for interlayer correlation (γ) has been obtained and its implications have been studied. Tc has been calculated numerically for n = 1, 2 and 3. Interlayer interactions have been found crucial for superconductivity and enhancing Tc. It is also found that mere addition of layers does not increase Tc, but the density of states (N0) should also increase with addition of layers. The results are in general agreement with experiments and explain the trend of Tc with n satisfactorily. (© 2007 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Des polyacrylamides modifies hydrophobiquement ont montre des proprietes interessantes en tant que modificateurs de rheologie en vue d’une application en RAP. Cependant, la synthese de polymeres hydrosolubles comportant des segments hydrophobes le long de la chaine est un defi puisque les monomeres hydrophiles et hydrophobes sont rarement miscibles dans le meme solvant. Le but de cette these a ete de developper des copolymeres a base d’acrylamide pouvant ensuite etre utilises en RAP. Au cours de l’extraction du petrole, des polymeres possedant des longues chaines sont melanges a l’eau puis injecte dans le puits afin de pousser le petrole brut en dehors de celui-ci. Le polymere a alors pour role d’accroitre la viscosite de l’eau de sorte qu’elle puisse deplacer plus efficacement le petrole hors du reservoir. Au cours de cette these, la technique RAFT/MADIX a ete combinee a la polymerisation micellaire dans le but de synthetiser de nouveaux copolymeres associatifs d’architectures controlees et possedant de nombreux blocs hydrophobes distribues le long de la chaine. En phase aqueuse, les segments hydrophobes s’associent et forment un reseau viscoelastique resultant en une augmentation de la viscosite. La combinaison de RAFT/MADIX avec la polymerisation micellaire nous permet egalement de limiter la derive en composition observee en polymerisation micellaire conventionnelle. Dans un premier temps, l’etude de l’effet des monomeres et de sels sur le comportement des micelles de tensio-actif a montre que la presence de NaAMPS gouverne le procede de micellisation du SDS par rapport a l’acrylamide. Cette etude a egalement prouve qu’il est possible de prevoir l’evolution du NH en fonction de la composition du milieu reactionnel au cours de la synthese. La comprehension des interactions tensio-actif-monomeres permet ainsi de prevoir la microstructure du polymere. Dans un second temps, il a ete demontre que les polymeres associatifs synthetises ici se comportent comme des chaines vivantes et peuvent etre etendus avec de l’acrylamide pour former des polymeres a bloc de haute masse molaire. L’addition d’un sel monovalent tel que le chlorure de sodium (NaCl) s’est revelee un outil efficace pour controler la microstructure du polymere, rendant possible le passage d’une composition de type gradient vers une composition plus homogene (rmonomeres hydrophiles/tBS proche de 1). Enfin, l’analyse des relations structure-propriete a montre que tous les polymeres synthetises possedent un comportement associatif et accroissent la viscosite de l’eau compare a l’homopolyacrylamide. La presence de NaAMPS dans la chaine diminue fortement la viscosite du polymere alors qu’elle n’est pas affectee par celle du chlorure de sodium. Le polymere presentant les meilleures proprietes en vue d’une application en RAP est P(Am90-co-AMPS10-co-(Am/NaCl)10-co-tBS1). L’utilisation de NaCl assure de bonnes proprietes rheologiques tandis que le NaAMPS favorise la solubilite du copolymere en solution aqueuse.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Effect of the microstructure on the physico-chemical properties of multiblock associative polymers synthesized via RAFT/MADIX micellar polymerization","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Those unable to live independently at home are being cared for in a range of settings. Practical training for nurses and auxiliary care staff has frequently been recommended as a way of improving oral health care for functionally dependent elderly.\n\n\nAIM\nTo evaluate an oral health education program for the caretakers of institutionalized elderly.\n\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nThe study was a cluster randomized intervention trial with an elderly home as the unit of randomization. Seven out of 65 elderly homes accommodating a total of 78 caretakers and 462 elderly residents were selected in Bangalore city, India, out of which 3 elderly homes were assigned to the intervention group and 4 to the control group. Oral health knowledge of caretakers was assessed using a pre-tested proforma; later, oral health education was provided to the caretakers of the intervention group. Oral health education was given at the end of 6 months to the caretakers of the control group. Chi-square test, Fisher exact test, and paired proportion test were used for statistical analysis.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThere was significant improvement in the oral health knowledge of the caretakers from baseline in the interventional group.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe results of the present study showed that there was a significant improvement in the oral health knowledge among the caretakers. Educating the caretakers for assisting or enabling residents for maintaining oral hygiene is essential.","inCitations":["cf70bd7becc6fcb354ed0513971161d552c6f95c","a7786960e693ff64b0a2a701b5ea1e78e724d170","02bd67eec1e5d0ea8fc5dd77caa60b60932e1566","00bf5b38a4f6d78c200e4f05917a7489c6395b5a","c7d9ba61c5b3291883a7fb39c15c6a0fa76bec3b","394648fb2431d34725f3f46dabd43a15bd0fb9e1","0429d93e879c692e2acb17c7d76a8f8805f67e90","7c1e6f4db3744b5d8e47734acf1542a37a833e02","4b85fbbe8148565110c86815256ea10a45d48785","f0037d857afcb50c882644250da600da5dff686b","166dd0c4c1e7cf4f33196e0f52d71b5affd8ceb1","eb6e11d728b06ef9beddbfbf76c8726222c98bf3","076bd2007b3b85becf5ce5dba105c3734b83a8ec","0781659b5baaccd727d99f7cd183a6c539cf1fb5","915e7bf629066d7634a83ac44b54636b864aefcc","28ff5854c63a1ad59331a7729ff91f5c567edb17","41de1304245eea5d3a9a0f47e98c2e7b31e11f6d","c5d92cc8c4c9f201a078305a6efbdcd7261124a3","3dc463144e3d6813f7e78fbc398c758a285b1b24"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Oral health care education and its effect on caregivers’ knowledge, attitudes, and practices: A randomized controlled trial","doi":"10.4103/2231-0762.139843","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.4103/2231-0762.139843","venue":"Journal of International Society of Preventive & Community Dentistry"}

Electricity consumption is proportional to the CO2 emitted at the process level and especially for machining processes. The electrical energy demand during machining can be categorized and modelled as basic energy (energy demand by the machine tool while operating at zero load) and tip energy (energy for actual material removal – cutting). The tool tip energy is evaluated from the specific cutting energy. At present limited data exists with regards to the key parameters required for modelling the tip energy. Previous studies and data for specific energy were based on the normalisation of the total energy demand with the material removal rate and have not investigated the effect of tool wear. In this work, the impact of tool wear on the specific energy coefficients in machining were studied and modelled. Cutting tests were performed and tool wear and tool life based on the specific energy coefficient for each wear land value were evaluated. The study has for the first time provided data on the variation of specific cutting energy for higher tool wear lands and presents vital sensitivity analysis. With longer cutting time, tool wear increases which leads to higher specific cutting energy and energy consumption during machining. The specific energy coefficient increased by up to 50% when turning EN8 steel alloy between 2 and 10 passes. This knowledge is vital information for process planners and could enable energy estimates to be more accurate and realistic with regards to capturing the impact of tool wear.","inCitations":["4e57f57736550174e6a09af7b5c195080ab843bd"],"pdfUrls":["https://www.ijser.org/researchpaper/Specific-energy-based-characterisation-of-tool-wear-in-mechanical-machining-processes.pdf"],"title":"Specific energy based characterization of tool wear in mechanical machining processes","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Ten age-matched children in each of these three groups identified 8 synthetic stimuli along an acoustic continuum ranging from /t(h)/ to /k(h)/. The children with posterior placement performed at random levels, appearing unable to distinguish /t(h)/ from /k(h)/. In contrast, both groups of children without posterior placement demonstrated a clear identification pattern. These results, which suggest that children with cleft palate and posterior placement have a perceptual deficit, contribute to discussion of the possible etiology of speech deficits in this population.","inCitations":["22f55f997f563f9ea2f61949ba30b7718fa8d909","67e426f394e5158cdbfa39cc52f643fd70b7a7a4","778bab1f83e19c4e3a240dbd2954ab618b4ae2ab","d542fc510d9845e00d7761da8743133acc5e8bec","a2db49d3690ced6b792bcd9a47e3c8483f0f7b17","5467fca53baaa386442d5452bc2b9ff9bc67ed47","dfef0f763e3115e89497f4ffe9f667d3a3290cf1","ffc8351f67549d81e9b8d2afca1cf7e4e7393f97","17ce200803cf756e8ccdf8fc7a2ace3613fefb07","aa2b06a8bba107a7a0c6f193cebb5915ab939d42","925ac5663c88f74ce9a07e27bf715251095ba501","275115efc15fe75f1c7950d22b1c644c21276407","e946455df9388fc95eb0cde52f222904d2b92aa6","ea0acc2aa35939dab4c55b6a88146ca02d3997cd"],"pdfUrls":["http://web.ics.purdue.edu/~francisa/Articles/Whitehill-etal_JSLHR03.pdf","https://clinicaltreatment.files.wordpress.com/2008/05/cleft20palate20sp20percn.pdf"],"title":"Perception of place of articulation by children with cleft palate and posterior placement.","doi":"10.1044/1092-4388(2003/037)","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1044/1092-4388%282003%2F037%29","venue":"Journal of speech, language, and hearing research : JSLHR"}

Neurons of PPN presented changes in their firing rate during arm movements. The changes were either an increase or a decrease. Muscimol (a γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) agonist) was injected into PPN area to suppress its neuronal activity while the monkey was performing the task. The blockade of the activity of PPN neurons caused slowness of movements on the both sides of arms. The peak velocities of lever movement decreased and the reaction times increased. This work suggested that PPN had an excitatory effect to the initiation and the execution of voluntary movements of the limbs The monkey did not show any difficulty in performing the task and the success rates were kept high.","inCitations":["66696eb2c0c252bf16ac8fa7fe1d074ba0019d45","48dbc58b405e66bd954f89af5de0f8c50eb87b6a","f167b3e8be9981aa87142caf52be2b6dc3adbb64"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Effects of Reversible Blockade of Pedunculopontine Tegmental Nucleus on Voluntary Arm Movement in Monkey","doi":"10.1007/978-1-4615-0179-4_15","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4615-0179-4_15","venue":""}

SEQ-IMRT consisted of two plans: 2 Gy × 25 fractions to low-risk planning target volume (PTV) followed by a sequential boost (2 Gy × 10 fractions) to high-risk PTV, while SIB-IMRT treated low- and high-risk PTVs with doses of 56 and 70 Gy in 33 fractions. Toxicities and survival outcomes were analyzed.ResultsBetween October 2010 and September 2015, of the 209 patients who completed treatment, 102 in the SEQ and 107 in the SIB arm were analyzed. The majority had undifferentiated squamous cell carcinoma (82%). Mucositis and dysphagia were the most common grade 3–5 acute toxicities. There were no statistically significant differences in the cumulative incidence of grade 3–4 acute toxicities between the two arms (59.8% in SEQ vs. 58.9% in SIB; P = 0.892). Common grade 3–4 late toxicities for SEQ and SIB included hearing loss (2.9 vs. 8.4%), temporal lobe injury (2.9 vs. 0.9%), cranial nerve injury (0 vs. 2.8%), and xerostomia (2 vs. 0.9%). With the median follow-up of 41 months, 3‑year progression-free and overall survival rates were 72.7 vs. 73.4% (P = 0.488) and 86.3 vs. 83.6% (P = 0.938), respectively.ConclusionSEQ and SIB provide excellent survival outcomes with few late toxicities. According to our study, SIB with a satisfactory dose–volume constraint to nearby critical organs is the technique of choice for NPC treatment due to its convenience.ZusammenfassungZielsetzungDiese Studie wurde durchgeführt, um die akuten und späten Toxizitäten zwischen intensitätsmodulierter Strahlentherapie (IMRT) mit sequenziell (SEQ) und simultan integriertem Boost (SIB) bei Nasopharynxkarzinom (NPK) zu vergleichen.Methoden und MaterialPatienten mit NPK im Stadium I–IV B wurden randomisiert einer SEQ-IMRT- oder SIB-IMRT-Therapie zugewiesen. Die SEQ-IMRT-Therapie bestand aus 2 Plänen: 2 Gy × 25 Fraktionen für das Planungszielvolumen (PZV) mit geringem Risiko, gefolgt von einem sequenziellen Boost (2 Gy × 10 Fraktionen) für das Hochrisiko-PZV, während PZV mit geringem und hohem Risiko mit SIB-IMRT mit Dosen von 56 und 70 Gy in 33 Fraktionen behandelt wurden. Es wurden Toxizitäten und Überlebensergebnisse analysiert.ErgebnisseZwischen Oktober 2010 und September 2015 wurden von den 209 Patienten, die die Behandlung abschlossen, 102 im SEQ- und 107 im SIB-Arm analysiert. Die Mehrzahl der Patienten (82 %) wies ein undifferenziertes Plattenepithelkarzinom auf. Mukositis und Dysphagie waren die am häufigsten vorkommenden akuten Toxizitäten der Grade 3–5. Es gab keine statistisch signifikanten Unterschiede bei der kumulativen Inzidenz akuter Toxizitäten der Grade 3–4 zwischen den beiden Armen (59,8 % im SEQ- vs. 58,9 % im SIB-Arm; P = 0,892). Häufig auftretende Toxizitäten der Grade 3–4 für SEQ bzw. SIB umfassten Hörverlust (2,9 % bzw. 8,4 %), Temporallappenverletzung (2,9 % bzw. 0,9 %), Hirnnervenverletzung (0 % bzw. 2,8 %) und Xerostomie (2 % bzw. 0,9 %). Bei der Nachbeobachtung mit einer medianen Länge von 41 Monaten betrugen die Raten für 3 Jahre Progressionsfreiheit und die Gesamtüberlebensraten 72,7 % versus 73,4 % (P = 0,488) bzw. 86,3 % versus 83,6 % (P = 0,938).SchlussfolgerungSEQ und SIB bieten hervorragende Überlebensergebnisse mit nur wenigen späten Toxizitäten. Laut unserer Studie ist SIB mit einer zufriedenstellenden Dosis-Volumen-Beschränkung für nahegelegene kritische Organe aufgrund seiner Annehmlichkeit die Technik der Wahl für die NPK-Behandlung.","inCitations":["01027d33fa7c7ece9fe7571d96c440acda2517b5","5fc6eab6ee709191a7081a4614cdd995f20afbeb","5f82dc841466f5042eb0ce46529a59b5110af0c7","cea43ae56790266a8f1070ded89977895642d748","7977304592b5a2ee45948ee5296858090db480d8","96611f5b85540ba831cb17dfafdbc5963684569c","e2c0c111d3122c39538684212f1fb387acf8f383","1fff3d4a49d44a047a8207b3b9c6a608448e2ca1","5cad470b7a558fbb6e3bd920811ad51eee87a88a","012ec79985a93bd6894486d1c36f3842e2bc7be6","96faa755ebde66ca221fc76fd0a539473db271de","36672c9be69e75f80bae3830de9f10b0ecd6955b","b0c169fe545a0b230c0827c1e7d812b3a172f102"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"A randomized phase III study between sequential versus simultaneous integrated boost intensity-modulated radiation therapy in nasopharyngeal carcinoma","doi":"10.1007/s00066-017-1251-5","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00066-017-1251-5","venue":"Strahlentherapie und Onkologie"}

According to the sampling strategy (systematic survey, with a time-step of 1 or 2 weeks, and a between-sampling station distance ranging from less than one to several kilometres), the information content of the data is mainly relevant to the characterization of seasonal variability of populations at the mesoscale. For any given area, and for each of the 56 taxinomic units considered here, the data are thus processed in order to recognize the temporal succession of ‘phytoplankton events’: an event is defined by retaining qualitative information only. It encompasses the phases of sudden growth, high level of abundance and decline of a population. Times at which an event begins or ends are detected by using a time-series segmentation method, which allows to summarize the whole data set as a multivariate set of event occurrences. Categorizing observations in such a way also provides an efficient tool for the identification of different patterns of variability over long-term time scales, for instance: ‘recurrent events’ (e.g. populations generating events in a periodic-like manner), or ‘anomalies’ (e.g. of climatic origin). On an univariate basis, an ‘average’ event can be defined for each taxum, characterized by its within-year position, its duration, its magnitude and the associated deviations. On a multivariate basis, graphical representation of event successions could also allow between-year comparisons. A simple multivariate analysis was also used to describe the seasonal pattern of some taxa.","inCitations":["9af6d55004dc2c828ef071f6a4b56f54d9cdd2f8","4dc64c57951006753b96fee09e0fecebe9146ba0","701ecc7d362bcb80da16165f5a8b724afe6f6a22","ffa3bffaed22fc6bd15be39b6a7284fff944ba6c","e2a4297ac86a2225e91d9842ad53728e640333fc","61f1ed758b699292ffa4e9005497e9e784f64d32","0cc749b6f47ab05684570142c56085e08a71d8bf","327e826439953f3d3e633ad2e12d7a336fa94d5e","eb3a70f101eab388afb358cd4b06d359784d938e","36be70e2d5933f65fc2ff0d6d1efaf9baa7d7a74","9faba6d2381511cdf3127ee9ebaa619dd35a8ac2","aec9b77a20cf6f70af5067c52d70fab68de42792"],"pdfUrls":["http://archimer.ifremer.fr/doc/00013/12403/9189.pdf"],"title":"‘Phytoplankton events’ in French coastal waters during 1987–1997","doi":"10.1016/S0399-1784(01)01156-2","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/S0399-1784%2801%2901156-2","venue":""}

The majority of the switches can be explained within either model, but each approach stresses different aspects of bilingual discourse. While the Markedness Model is preferred by these authors because it sheds light on social identities, in cases of codeswitching as the unmarked choice, it cannot account for individual switches. In such interactions, we show how the additional application of the Sequential Approach can be used to shed light on the conversational structure of bilingual discourse.","inCitations":["02b65e2443c6ca2aaa6eb288541ae3524b6fbda1","f0dd931cf2de424bc6b89354abe1d8125a320c4e"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"8.

Our objective was to estimate the risk of HANA comorbidity associated with history of injection drug use (IDU) correctly accounting for higher death rates among people who inject drugs (PWID).\n\n\nDESIGN\nWe followed HIV-infected persons aged 25-59 years who enrolled in the Johns Hopkins HIV Clinical Cohort between 1995 and May 2014, from enrollment until HANA comorbidity diagnosis, death, age 60, or administrative censoring.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe compared cumulative incidence ('risk'), by age, of validated diagnoses of HANA comorbidities among HIV-infected PWID and non-IDU; specifically, we considered end-stage renal disease (ESRD), end-stage liver disease (ESLD), myocardial infarction, stroke, and non-AIDS-defining cancer. We used competing risk methods appropriate to account for death, standardized to the marginal distribution of baseline covariates, and adjusted for potential differential loss-to-clinic.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOf 5490 patients included in this analysis, 37% reported IDU as an HIV transmission risk. By age 55 years, PWID had higher risk of ESLD [risk difference = 6.8, 95% confidence interval (CI): -1.9, 15.5] and ESRD (risk difference = 11.1, 95% CI: 1.2, 21.0) than did non-IDU. Risk of myocardial infarction and stroke were similar among PWID and non-IDU. Risk of non-AIDS-defining cancer was lower among PWID than among non-IDU (risk difference at 55 years: -4.9, 95% CI: -11.2, 1.3).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nNot all HANA comorbidities occur with higher incidence in PWID compared with non-IDU. However, higher incidence of ESRD and ESLD among PWIDs highlights the importance of recognition and management of markers of these comorbidities in early stages among PWID.","inCitations":["d5577019bd37b7dddb2c1cc75e2725bcaee5fc9d","19d9aff64f2c5b7638168bd38a3dd7d2a07bff68","fa43f21207603235cb14bdbb9e120f9e4bd5eb32","74ce264811ca2028d51cb40543bf3f9344330771","5a4fbb2c070bc9a691c276836ab99ddf63b3c0ec","a165f8dca1c2ecd5ad677f90b67ea54994e6b215","0d35406626717bcbbfaed0892363e86771d99ff4"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.natap.org/2016/HIV/Association_of_injection_drug_use_with_incidence.15.pdf"],"title":"Association of injection drug use with incidence of HIV-associated non-AIDS-related morbidity by age, 1995-2014.","doi":"10.1097/QAD.0000000000001087","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1097/QAD.0000000000001087","venue":"AIDS"}

Drug treatment settings are ideal places to reach populations at risk; however, few have the capacity to offer on-site HIV counseling and testing. We have developed an interactive computer counseling tool (CARE) that may make HIV testing in drug treatment settings feasible. This study aims to assess the acceptability and usability of the CARE tool with HIV rapid self-testing among staff at a drug treatment center. Study Design and Methods Focus groups were conducted in three chemical dependency treatment settings: detoxification ( N = 13), inpatient ( n = 7), and outpatient ( n = 7). Information on current HIV counseling and testing practice and feedback on computer-assisted counseling and rapid self-testing was obtained. Qualitative data were analyzed by three coders using iterative content analysis. Results Each treatment setting reported a unique system of HIV risk assessment and education. HIV testing is only offered on a limited basis by an outside organization. Staff reported that challenges to their current practice are limited risk disclosure, need for effective HIV education, and competing priority of the chemical dependency treatment mission. Perceived limitations of the CARE tool included concerns that some clients will not be literate enough to use the tool, conflict over the role that computers should have in counseling, concern about distracting clients from their chemical dependency treatment goals, low impact of the CARE tool given a resistant client population, and administrative concern regarding documentation requirements. Perceived strengths of the CARE tool included novelty, enhanced client disclosure, and ability for use among low-literacy populations. Staff believed that the CARE tool may provide enhanced HIV education and new opportunities for HIV counseling and testing that is private and personalized. Staff thought that the tool may promote the chemical dependency mission by increasing client responsibility. Incentive was expressed as important to the acceptability of the CARE tool among clients. Staff suggested improvements to the tool, such as making characters and scenarios in the skill-building videos more consistent with the needs and demographics of their population. Conclusion With modifications, the CARE tool may have a role in expanding access to HIV counseling and testing in chemical dependency treatment settings. A study is now ongoing to test the acceptability and usability of computer assisted self-testing in these three treatment settings.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"426 Computer-assisted Counseling and Rapid Hiv Self-testing in Chemical Dependency Treatment Settings.","doi":"10.1097/00042871-200701010-00433","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1097/00042871-200701010-00433","venue":""}

Experiments on coal-mass blasting rupture in excavating workface were also carried out, and the emerged TEM signal was analyzed. The results indicate that the low-frequency TEM signals were detected close to the coal specimens under high strain dynamic load applied by the SHPB, initially rising sharply and dropping rapidly, followed by a small tailing turbulence. And the field test results obtained during coal blasting process coincided with the results from the SHPB tests. Furthermore, its initial part shaped like a pulse cluster had a more pronounced tail and lasted even longer. And the generation mechanism of the low-frequency TEM effect was analyzed. It suggests that the low-frequency TEM effect of coal during dynamic rupture is contributed by the fractoemission mechanism and the resonance or waveguide effects. Because its wavelength is longer than the higher ones, the low-frequency TEM has a good anti-interference performance. That can expand the scope and performance of the coal-rock dynamic disaster electromagnetic monitoring technique.","inCitations":["abc2a038ded2eaa3fdabcfb0550abb433f633988"],"pdfUrls":["http://downloads.hindawi.com/journals/sv/2015/189569.pdf"],"title":"Study on Low-Frequency TEM Effect of Coal during Dynamic Rupture","doi":"10.1155/2015/189569","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1155/2015%2F189569","venue":""}

They have quickly, for him anyway, adopted a light, teasing quality together. But he is not expecting her tonight, and he stands at the blackboard, a wet cloth in his hand. Already it is dark outside, a storm limns the evening, and the light in his classroom is drawn out, thinned. He is bending to the bucket at his feet when he sees her running across the courtyard. He takes a deep breath as she walks in...","inCitations":["7b3b89a14b7b17475afdb0236e287a9980432440"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.qc.cuny.edu/Academics/Degrees/Education/Documents/Art%20Teacher%202_10_11%20DMR.pdf"],"title":"The art teacher","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Selon un mode de realisation prefere, les sites individuels comprennent des micropuits formes a l'extremite distale de chacune des fibres d'un groupe de fibres optiques. L'ensemble de biocapteurs utilise un schema de codage adressable par voie optique permettant de determiner l'identite et l'emplacement de chaque type de cellule dans l'ensemble. Cet ensemble permet donc de mesurer simultanement un grand nombre de reponses de cellules a des analytes cibles. La methode de detection utilise la capacite unique qu'ont les populations cellulaires a repondre a des composes biologiquement importants de maniere caracteristique et detectable. L'ensemble de biocapteurs et la methode de mesure peuvent etre utilises dans l'etude de substances biologiquement actives, dans la surveillance de l'environnement in situ, dans la surveillance de divers bioprocedes, et pour un dosage a haut rendement de grandes bibliotheques chimiques combinatoires.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Ensemble de biocapteurs comprenant des populations cellulaires confinees dans des microcavites","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}
