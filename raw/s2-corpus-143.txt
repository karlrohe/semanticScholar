In this study, 22 cases of DAI were comprehensively examined histologically in the following areas: corpus callosum, internal capsule, superior cerebellar peduncles, cerebral white matter, fornix, rostral brain stem and globus pallidus, with a total of 17 standard blocks in each case. Sections were stained for axons with Glees and Marsland and neurofilament immunostaining and myelin with luxol fast blue and myelin basic protein immunostaining, and axonal retraction balls and myelin globoids were counted. Neurofilament immunostaining was superior to Glees and Marsland in both the positivity rates and the actual scores. Small myelin globoids were identified by the myelin stains, probably as a form of myelin damage secondary to axonal disruption. Such acute myelin damage was previously undescribed. There was no significant difference in both positivity rates and the scores obtained for luxol fast blue and myelin basic protein. Of all the regions of the brain examined, the internal capsule, corpus callosum and superior cerebellar peduncles yielded the highest counts of axonal balls as well as the highest incidences. It is recommended that in cases of DAI, these three regions of the brain should be examined most profitably with neurofilament immunostaining supplemented with a myelin stain.","inCitations":["a512f5072a66f5840e2ebbf79dcb1e5a1765d0f4","d71df948b7a8e300def9837a4d5d094bddbbfdd4","1e1c154fbfb19ec9a800230fc2b221c479eb2227","4cf1a8fd67454428015c4f9abf73689432657be9","374d75698095b4d58d5e1452eaae74ae7202bdc6","d5e202f8d95893f136d583c98dc4256fcc15c56c","16c7474fae8f47a100219099ce12ebbe6b7b6a3f","1d862659bd289a73087ea30c3ebe5472d9477fa4","71a1d9e2971c63ab9d0518b13ddf84dc1ec255f2","4d8136680764c39dcc4bca3ce0dce3d84f7fe546","7a62f69b5b11a036c7db1e2406f8a129bfc78bb7","58c0c1151e41e2bf251ff4e95433577e10a73712","7504d05512d00c92cbac1849ec6f4b8a7a190624","a18fbd202160e41d68edec3dda067c20f9dce98b","8e4e45e02e5f74b120a45ba2c1088cfe94513383","1caff4ac26db04f05408e303a11f0386e22cf189","4ef4876c549904972966636cd5516821ec02d9a4","97af93fc87cc6d6b689c622ffa70109b68c8f074","74500c58248cfb9d83d3a285a3d2941263c6f000","36bb6bd4d9b6ea5d5eb609601a1eb40a7568fcb0","b8ea4fcf4606b3d852ab00ace8959dc9e6485e05","f2f836c93549991562e3c6ad80b2563232d2f762","b9c8111438c69691a1c47ff13eb66008fcf3bddf","07a4f47a9149764760c0761e2e3caf0c92577487","7ceb7b2825fa7eee24138fbe8cc9df8e12c7e123","5df0330360db4301f67881f02fad6ae625e86315","79ab973049509098292173549c7faa44a10147a7","4daf7e01a30f53efeac788c485754f6ec9372bc8","054a11ee4d1cb1eabc2417491751de2731f19072","11ad3f8a276802003b0b418ac9963f7858c434e3","3865c3fb0dfc4a5da2f44257bbb41eef63de85f0","f7807c0393754a7bfd96816ea63cfc1357a9afd5","2fd0391334d5acfb9a769675dedcd877262059af","da8b58f99993d6e4f53b8e8e894078292b9b4b96","c7b43acf749427b6c74364e6c2d7850facf7e5f7","4ac38a6595dd26781fe8f4280d97d435216942e4","9e6adc42cf6646e2b1c7019af461eea9da482fee","460d9a0eaad95a0c8bb4e181916dbfcc3a268182","979b6a2ff9b32adb18bb5d3357d582f096e657d0","2615d583ca3a1b0b59a77e6398406c6d722ead5e","251bd3d22d0f33b7bc2a0421d1bc5e964a660f8d","8fd3088e60dd7ce13c9d1c2ac5155ae8b2680d06"],"pdfUrls":["https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/0303846794900256","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0303846794900256?dgcid=api_sd_search-api-endpoint"],"title":"The pathological spectrum of diffuse axonal injury in blunt head trauma: assessment with axon and myelin stains","doi":"10.1016/0303-8467(94)90025-6","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/0303-8467%2894%2990025-6","venue":"Clinical Neurology and Neurosurgery"}

The paper addresses the Croatian regulatory and policy choices relating to a number of SGEIs from the perspective of State aid law, whereby all publicly available national decisions were analysed against the criteria of the latest EU SGEI Package. The research reveals a lack of clear terminology pointing to a far more complicated issue: conceptual inconsistencies of the legal vocabulary often used interchangeably by the decision-making bodies. This makes it very hard to reconcile the EU notion of SGEI as a universal notion with local national concepts of public services mostly determined by the socialistic heritage of the country on the one hand, and legal tradition regarding matters of public administration on the other. The paper points out the inefficiencies of what is revealed to be a fragmented approach to the topic of public services and their financing, and it also forwards the idea of an all- encompassing legislative reform.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"SGEI in Croatia: The Legal Framework for Economic Necessity","doi":"10.21552/estal/2016/4/10","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.21552/estal%2F2016%2F4%2F10","venue":""}

In the second experiment, 6 groups of 6 animals received 6, 12, or 24 trials followed by 54 extinction trials with or without goal punishment on the first 18. All punished groups ran self-punitively, and acquisition trials effects were apparent during and after punishment. In the third experiment, buzzer extent, or duration, was manipulated, and longer extents produced stronger self-punitive effects.

This data heterogeneity may cause a significant bias in the estimation of standard errors for the coefficients as well as the coefficients' statistical inferences. In the past decade, several promising modeling strategies have been proposed to handle overdispersed crash data, most of which have focused on estimating the conditional mean crash count. This paper applies an alternative crash modeling approach: quantile regression (QR) in the context of a count data model. The application of QR to model crash frequency is illustrated, and empirical results are interpreted. Poisson gamma, the benchmark statistical model for crash counts, is referenced to estimate the covariate coefficients for the mean crash count. Focusing on the mean may result in important aspects of the data being missed. A more detailed analysis, using a QR model for crash count data, confirms that crash predictors have varying impacts on the different areas of the crash distribution. Moreover, the marginal effects of covariates provide a more direct observation of changes in the quantity, rather than the percentage, of crash frequency when responding to one-unit changes in regressors.","inCitations":["fe495f65bad2efab878793a6f52d730e89fff40d","d3e04d1a0bcca27103e6aa70671282a668ca5ab9","4f2b008829660b599130d8dc88d7973245c11885","fc44c6e43eee5a848690d409fe788351528025d0","e1900516bf8efd5e5ccc6745d0f3f5fb43032e61"],"pdfUrls":["https://cpb-us-w2.wpmucdn.com/people.uwm.edu/dist/e/546/files/2018/02/TRR-2012-QR-1mti7h4.pdf"],"title":"Quantile Effects of Causal Factors on Crash Distributions","doi":"10.3141/2279-05","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.3141/2279-05","venue":""}

While there have been many reports about the positive outcomes of proactivity, there is much less known about the antecedents, particularly those related to culture. Design/methodology/approach - – Sales employees ( Findings - – Long-term orientation positively influenced proactive behaviors as did uncertainty avoidance. Uncertainty avoidance was hypothesized to have a negative impact on proactive behaviors, but the results of this study implied that individuals found it safer to adjust to a fluid environment rather than to remain inflexible. No relationship was found between power distance and proactivity. Masculinity was found to be positively related to proactive behaviors but collectivism was not. Research limitations/implications - – The results of this study should be limited to its own population and not generalized to larger, more culturally diverse populations which were not represented in the sample. Practical implications - – This study provides better understanding of managerial proactive behavior related to cultural traits, particularly in the domain of field sales. Originality/value - – This study is unique in that it explores individual proactivity in an organizational selling environment related to cultural traits at the individual level.","inCitations":["fda69a75dd138eea44c03d0628c9d859f5ec6030","cd7f7f12bec1327354b73dde61e8088ae600c056","4452e8b3489d900255e891f21114ec23114da1b2","8dbc88275e5d73ca0f723e3ae9df3653dac1164b","a266574c77d0f1cf08d2eac98816fbf89ead9b54"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"The role of individual cultural traits and proactivity in an organizational setting","doi":"10.1108/MRR-12-2012-0269","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1108/MRR-12-2012-0269","venue":""}

RNase HI is the major mammalian enzyme representing around 85% of the total RNase H activity in the cell. By using highly purified calf thymus RNase HI we identified the sequences of several tryptic peptides. This information enabled us to determine the sequence of the cDNA coding for the large subunit of human RNase HI. The corresponding ORF of 897 nt defines a polypeptide of relative molecular mass of 33,367, which is in agreement with the molecular mass obtained earlier by SDS/PAGE. Expression of the cloned ORF in Escherichia coli leads to a polypeptide, which is specifically recognized by an antiserum raised against calf thymus RNase HI. Interestingly, the deduced amino acid sequence of this subunit of human RNase HI displays significant homology to RNase HII from E. coli, an enzyme of unknown function and previously judged as a minor activity. This finding suggests an evolutionary link between the mammalian RNases HI and the prokaryotic RNases HII. The idea of a mammalian RNase HI large subunit being a strongly conserved protein is substantiated by the existence of homologous ORFs in the genomes of other eukaryotes and of all eubacteria and archaebacteria that have been completely sequenced.","inCitations":["8e978d053ae316b4fce539d623e48b17fb364033","0555659ea141946d063d979a0258d8537005e534","689c0e0c25f011b73128ac2f8cdb7a0339dd391d","e1d953c25c7c56e774e9ae899fd7be67f9131d06","7ac0e06ee3b37acc67af078c0a3e5a17d9170d3d","ed0e79a47edf442ceaa08c3607cca72320a7c09e","6164ba994fcae7d905f18f6d3e8b59edb6b347e5","6e196e5cf0d1a5a9e8295a270a564fc9b5c47b2a","383e5e1cef8e5b77019eda8a219bc88365295108","88df6fa58bc8bcce3bea9fa01815ff384491478d","d4cad82e764e0ba78ab1dbce23f0a7d778b9a194","2dab301186ad9e1069a50fd7dc75ca1fe5e3da81","d14a2cab34206d9080a6a8c0f695f6a12bfd021a","c9ceb349d5152a03869b4094c5f010a2f1b924da","bb16ecc1cff35a5ed3ce7f616e313cc9aef5e9db","cfa8189d4d3079fbdf78d8d287562224b90283a1","2f49126a6f5945000bbf3e441c35d4d787deddbb","c32e94b43b0eedfc956563593dd1dd6abc12ad42","c201c9d1c163371b205f2bf7b9492d5b435385d0","5080fd6407450c756a0d3788a4acc252c67b06d2","7869d0a7a0e98da94b45668fc146b2f909552afe"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.pnas.org/content/95/22/12872.full.pdf"],"title":"Cloning of the cDNA encoding the large subunit of human RNase HI, a homologue of the prokaryotic RNase HII.","doi":"10.1073/pnas.95.22.12872","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.95.22.12872","venue":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America"}

Alcohol abuse is a significant contributor to the global burden of disease and a leading cause of liver disease. Alcoholic liver disease(ALD) is associated with significant morbidity and mortality, which includes a spectrum of disorders from simple steatosis to steatohepatitis, fibrosis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. In China, with the establishment and effective implementation of the Expanded Program on Immunization for HBV from 1992, the number of newly HBV-infected patients had a significant decline; whereas the number of patients with alcoholic and nonalcoholic fatty liver diseases is growing. The incidence of ALD will continue to upsurge in China. Due to significant differences in alcohol metabolism, genetics, drinking patterns, and eating habits and behaviors between the East and the West, the pathogenesis of ALD in Chinese population may be different from the well-characterized ALD in Western countries. In this article, we reviewed and discussed the epidemic trend, the occurrence and the development of ALD in China.

Mathematical analysis and numerical simulation show that performing path tracking control with instantaneous flow results in smaller path tracking error when the strength of spatially varying flow is small compared to glider speed, while it leads to larger path tracking error if spatially varying flow is the same order as the glider speed. Performing path tracking control with instantaneous flow leads to less path tracking error when the spatially varying flow is of relatively high frequency, but it produces larger path tracking error if the spatially varying flow is of low frequency. Simulated experiments near Cape Hatteras, NC show that in this specific region, performing path tracking control with instantaneous flow results in less path tracking error, which is consistent with the analytical result.","inCitations":["1061a0921b8afe2266080407a9057cdef0743a9c"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Path Tracking Error Analysis for Underwater Glider Navigation in a Spatially and Temporally Varying Flow Field","doi":"10.1109/oceans.2018.8604585","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/oceans.2018.8604585","venue":"OCEANS 2018 MTS/IEEE Charleston"}

In addition the ability to build multi-hundred joule per pulse, several nanosecond pulselength lasers with repetition rate capability and table top size now allow us to design table top x-ray sources and x-ray lasers. Within our laboratory we have been building several high power solid state lasers for direct application to these systems. We find that the best performance of these high power lasers is obtained when we include non-linear phase conjugate mirrors. These mirrors function in two important respects; they provide a means to obtain very high beam brightness without the generation of hot spots which damage optical components and in addition because of their threshold activation characteristic they function in the role of multistage gain isolators.

Joint estimators of the parameters are obtained as the joint mode of the posterior distribution.","inCitations":["51d353d1cb7bb77ce07c5882207f27a446880177","35cd44d05ccc568e5f37ff22ab8b23405d049345","d26561a21215f11f05588207168e381794d9b494","d8607de1ef79451cfeb7000bfe5c1b7cc7c8035c","96d1785c2735c55533e3f8507a04e5412cca95c9"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Missing Variables in Bayesian Regression, II","doi":"10.1080/01621459.1976.10480350","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1080/01621459.1976.10480350","venue":""}

We hypothesize that a combination of specific inflammatory markers into an RCC Inflammatory Score (RISK) could serve as a rigorous prognostic indicator of overall survival (OS) in patients with clear cell and non-clear cell RCC.\n\n\nMethods\nCombination of preoperative C-reactive protein (CRP), albumin, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), corrected calcium, and aspartate transaminase to alanine transaminase (AST/ALT) ratio was used to develop RISK. RISK was developed using grid-search methodology, receiver-operating-characteristic (ROC) analysis, and sensitivity-specificity trade-off analysis. Prognostic value of RISK was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional regression models. Predictive accuracy was compared with RISK to Size, Size, Grade, and Necrosis (SSIGN) score, University of California-LOS Angeles (UCLA) Integrated Staging System (UISS), and Leibovich Prognosis Score (LPS).\n\n\nResults\nAmong 391 RCC patients treated with nephrectomy, area under the curve (AUC) for RISK was 0.783, which was comparable to SSIGN (AUC 0.776, p = 0.82) and UISS (AUC 0.809, p = 0.317). Among patients with localized disease, AUC for RISK and LPS was 0.742 and 0.706, respectively (p = 0.456). On multivariate analysis, we observed a step-wise statistically significant inverse relationship between increasing RISK group and OS (all p < 0.001).\n\n\nConclusion\nRISK is an independent and significant predictor of OS for patients treated with nephrectomy for clear cell and non-clear cell RCC, with accuracy comparable to other histopathological prognostic tools.","inCitations":["c1a4f9536af97424a5a64beac5258916c41a7a06","09e6bffe27227ba22a3d19ced72593e53ed61666","803c86711e4f4a79587bc67a795e6db97aedd594"],"pdfUrls":["https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/pmc/oa_pdf/a9/49/main.PMC5773049.pdf"],"title":"A novel preoperative inflammatory marker prognostic score in patients with localized and metastatic renal cell carcinoma","doi":"10.1016/j.ajur.2017.04.002","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajur.2017.04.002","venue":"Asian journal of urology"}

This may reduce suboptimal dialysis starts, prevent hospitalizations, and decrease costs. Our objectives were to explore assumptions around a nurse-led virtual case management intervention for late-stage chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients with a 2-year Kidney Failure Risk Equation (KFRE) estimated risk of kidney failure ≥80% and to estimate how these assumptions affect potential cost savings. Methods We performed a cost-minimization analysis by developing a decision analytic microsimulation model constructed from the perspective of the health payer. Our primary outcome was the break-even point, defined as the maximum amount a health payer could spend on the intervention without incurring any net financial loss or gain. The intervention group received remote telemonitoring, including daily measurement of several health metrics (blood pressure, oxygen saturation, and weight), and a validated symptom questionnaire accompanied by nurse-led case management, whereas the comparator group received usual care. We assumed patients received the intervention for a maximum of 2 years. Results The break-even point was $7,339 per late-stage CKD patient enrolled in the intervention. Based on the distribution of time receiving the intervention, we determined a maximum monthly intervention cost of $703.37. In probabilistic sensitivity analyses we found that 75% of simulations produced break-even points between $3,929 and $9,460. Conclusion Nurse-led virtual home monitoring interventions in CKD patients at high risk of kidney failure have the potential for significant cost savings from the perspective of the health payer.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"A Cost-Minimization Analysis of Nurse-Led Virtual Case Management in Late-Stage CKD","doi":"10.1016/j.ekir.2020.03.016","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ekir.2020.03.016","venue":""}

Even when the electrochemical basis for energy conversion is apparently the same, cells produced by different manufacturers often provide markedly different quantities of energy. In this experiment samples of cathode composite are removed from commercial cells and their electrochemical performance is compared using a test cell and identical discharge conditions. The results confirm that the cell with the most energy does not always have the highest price and suggest that some cell manufacturers may attribute a higher priority to other aspects of performance (power, shelf-life or resistance to abuse, for example), which increase the price without improving the quantity of deliverable energy.

An alternative diagnostic proposal based on two criteria, being impaired personality functioning and the presence of maladaptive traits, will be referred to a special section for further research and clinical evaluation. Two issues pertaining to this alternative diagnostic approach need further clarification. First, more insight is required in the specific nature of personality dysfunction, its underlying structure, and optimal operationalization. Second, confusion still exists about how personality dysfunction and traits are interconnected and how they both contribute to the PD diagnosis. The current study addresses both issues empirically in a sample of 159 psychiatric patients by (a) investigating the structure of personality functioning as assessed by the Severity Indices of Personality Problems (SIPP-118), and (b) determining the incremental validity of the resulting dysfunction factors vis-à-vis trait domains (measured by the NEO Personality Inventory-Revised [NEO-PI-R]) in explaining DSM-IV PD variance. Trait and dysfunction dimensions were strongly correlated but showed significant, though limited, incremental validity above each other. Implications for the conceptualization of personality pathology are discussed.","inCitations":["d151ab9f7f85095ba93d8d5cb4daec97db82ab44","f463567dc94837b0db1b123033e4ef072974c831","8ac1bdd47f3d8b837cb4c54628548a23f8edb1ae","ca3997203f647052aaf8a1b7aebca62447b7d00b","345735684087766dde9c86e442bfea1de3496d65","02351ca2b82b47ed632acb94153c3310baee5631","4160bb49be5bacc12cf3f9c407e2d54dad490418","a57e501ac28206d33dd43196603ff6edf8efe8d1","c206aae93960cbf4309349cc3b5d32065a3c69f6","ec07ec1e06d6074dadc5176524cf69a12c20919d","c401ac0cf6aab4648eef8ac4f32dda034159198f","6cd78bcba0588f5991b32ac6592c6c0b2c0e2712","6db211016978f4ded4cd2a03081144b16abb3645","36fe7dd1976d51401d89528e953caaf6d6107832","1afe4098723862627fb7751a73c8ad8e71154b88","cd40aa186119b50ff4290b044199531a5f3e23de","89ad30a980beb7dc94c9bd9b9a37a3a3d63137a7","d5dc5865f57e38d57ba864bbb82eb84ac64b8ab6","5982a01bdf525fd4361ceaba83f1fa020198cff7","c154eb67a4fd4add46ca914772c0906a61aea5a6","b458a97dd737aee63b46dda231d6c16b65bd0690","c0accf2bdf78272795aa78ef86b1017c3e266b56","a378998eab2a45b68f6597813b06eae0b113b3fc"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Personality disorder dysfunction versus traits: structural and conceptual issues.","doi":"10.1037/per0000018","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1037/per0000018","venue":"Personality disorders"}

This study is motivated by the availability of final measurements both for the SPS (beam energies 20-160 AGeV) and for the RHIC energies ( √ sNN=130 and 200 GeV) and by updates in the hadron mass spectrum, which is a crucial input for statistical models. Extending previous studies by inclusion of very high-mass resonances (m> 2 GeV), and the up-to-now neglected scalar σ meson leads to an improved description of the data. In particular, the hitherto poorly reproduced energy dependence of the K+/π+ ratio at SPS energies (“the horn”) is now well described through the connection to the hadronic mass spectrum and, implicitly, Hagedorn’s limiting temperature. We thereby demonstrate the intimate connection between the horn and the QCD phase transition.","inCitations":["3e701e897f17e0d6d3cca1a23a9f18c1b0c84b47","8735f3bcbfac1db64526afd3e2a949c02d367a4d","31ce5f366c0bbf598d6014e1777e4681cfb84084"],"pdfUrls":["http://arxiv.org/pdf/0812.1186v1.pdf"],"title":"Thermal hadron production in relativistic nuclear collisions: the sigma meson, the horn, and the QCD phase transition","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

The subcellular distribution pattern of the HCN channels influences the effects that they exert on the properties and activity of neurons. However, little is known about the mechanisms that control HCN channel trafficking to subcellular compartments or that regulate their surface expression. Here we studied the dynamics of HCN channel trafficking in hippocampal neurons using dissociated cultures coupled with time lapse imaging of fluorophore-fused HCN channels. HCN1-green fluorescence protein (HCN1-GFP) channels resided in vesicle-like organelles that moved in distinct patterns along neuronal dendrites, and these properties were isoform-specific. HCN1 trafficking required intact actin and tubulin and was rapidly inhibited by activation of either NMDA or AMPA-type ionotropic glutamate receptors in a calcium-dependent manner. Glutamate-induced inhibition of the movement of HCN1-GFP-expressing puncta was associated with increased surface expression of both native and transfected HCN1 channels, and this surface expression was accompanied by augmented I(h). Taken together, the results reveal the highly dynamic nature of HCN1 channel trafficking in hippocampal neurons and provide a novel potential mechanism for rapid regulation of I(h), and hence of neuronal properties, via alterations of HCN1 trafficking and surface expression.","inCitations":["da98f8183e463e4584aa847bd15f6f687bc29124","f307a15b0da34216bc96dc1a834d2ee60917be33","7bde8b5415a4157b324be8b9e0c8a3189bd93452","7ab793b91c865842c41859d8e827c971bd7faca7","b9056bcdf06f81db9bc0b071528bc5ccd8e44a87","71bf12480f5460c1a5a043d712608e4dc7dbdc90","7e0d4ab65ef3743546718aa0018fc1b774d591d8","0ef4add9564b658388d3d47554f6572821acae69","e2c20c23957e1129da895115b2c80932875886fe","63a59fe084ffadbbc1259f3cc864f853f35356a5","007efe6efeb6ec2fafeae16aee5793c6c7aa55c3","98b3084033deb89816829b6f41fd0f2662b459e2","1ac76b4c10f15eca7e40f5a92f6374e8c8ca3877","ca5aae461fb4a4bb6c725c185db8d8371bcb2362","8726ef7ddf61844af6055a8b92f99e023b5bd430","3947396d960c866020ada64be38fae96f0979c92","ddf71eda4371ad8a8ecd5279b4427ff59a2efccd","d13b70afe47221fa073fbdd8fb5ad9e5411f82ac","f63b3e00383d31535975524a0a7551cafdedc313","1da361e61b3ec1efbfd6b6d845d460cf5dbcc6d9","30a3de594fa94131aef9a3a728a2830b1c7ef76f","d3f68dec598f792a7dd0d6f65cd4d72c262eec90","663992ebf0faf0af42f4caa985c8df8d6d7776b5","06dc3d00f591073ca528b680c4b1bedf5025a0b8","6566bab60644ad4ee2cc4933e53890f53a402ad9","0b47b27bc7c04e8865c959eee7a48a389a2aceda","7579e80d5d432a62981ec0f601a1303da6f8aab8","368c635dd756dca38b68f49a39d353be26c78e06","cce52a1b10c597329e0ad61500c46efb86a99769","aeb178ef1910a61152cd74209c28641199c82855","093edfaae0f6f5276dfefd9de5116491ea779928","a65825518dcb15115a1bdcab7d275e04d2fccf67","cee01f680010af521d489169b122dd9ad392ea8e","cadfa2ef7faa61ee68284319bb127b586fe997d5","67195a329a139c0105f0d2c7da86465224cbe178","61fd34a5f2ce30f36594b4ed8841524db8c89e4b","de49f1c43b90d411926ca61771d43ff5cba8e29b","02a40f805e79c7ddaa2b7d727539ae1162907960","4f4878c519fb1d63d56c9eccb7dacef7287ce2c0","4c71be443f735b4327225892b7e9a54d9f62a9c9","c9897dd83acdfa3c9ce0b2432b64a250a0d73066","4510f875f28a1d3c8db7ee59f3fc2f9c1912c782","5961ec3c09a70eb01c58595693d63688c76171c0"],"pdfUrls":["https://pure.uva.nl/ws/files/1222230/100526_05.pdf","https://escholarship.org/content/qt5sk4j7g1/qt5sk4j7g1.pdf?t=pyquxs"],"title":"Trafficking and surface expression of hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated channels in hippocampal neurons.","doi":"10.1074/jbc.M109.070391","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M109.070391","venue":"The Journal of biological chemistry"}

Body iron could contribute to the pathogenesis of coronary artery disease (CAD) through its ability to induce oxidative stress. However, studies on the relationship between iron metabolism and CAD have yielded conflicting results. Patients and Methods From the obseRvatoire des Infarctus de Cote d’Or (RICO) survey, 31 consecutive patients admitted in Intensive Care Unit for a first AMI were included. Serum concentrations of iron, transferrin, ferritin, the iron-regulatory hormone hepcidin and erythroferrone (a new hepcidin-regulating hormone), transferrin saturation and total iron binding capacity were assessed on admission. Results Mean age was 65±16 yrs, 61% were male, 51% had hypertension, 23% diabetes, 45% dyslipidemia and 32% were smokers. There was a trend toward a higher serum hepcidin concentration in men (99.8 versus 56.3 ng/ml, p=0.181). Heart rate on admission was negatively associated with an erythroferrone concentration (r=–0.428, p=0.023). Haemoglobin level and hematocrit were positively correlated with erythroferrone concentration (p=0.027 and p=0.021). Moreover, a lower serum transferrin concentration was found in patients with heart failure on admission (1.93±0.16g/l, vs 2.32±0.42, p=0.001). Ferritin concentration was positively related with infarct size, as assessed by Creatine Kinase peak (r=0.535, p=0.002) and there was a trend toward a positive correlation with erythroferrone concentration (r=0.314, p=0.085).

There is strong evidence to have the opinion that MR imaging is as accurate as barostat measurement in determining changes in gastric volume, and it yields additional information about gastric contractions.","inCitations":["ea817825e72cb9e291a48dc0d799a7c0c0e6539b","919fcb4990d1729d871bbb05f5d382e9059efbe3","b6a8d447dc2b9ba53938dedfdc4db0622301d339","6232b339955ec6162697a6d28462fe4995f495c8","6d08e4f0b4d82943a74e18dc980a8770a997dc70","90f761e5fa367106bda07b17d4ccca4cc0f7de5a","292fa952e65fa9f839a312f7a96140905f3564f4","d4ef102038a80e0394371f16e730646011439e61","79e4266649ae7bea01479deff6de1e8730c02efd","6bc7c4e5b6b511791cec6683fa152af5b1ee68d1","d2922b7889bcb9cd342c8d11bc9e613deaf783c7","14407d72946fba8b4e4d0bc552e81da1d496c723","32f48194ac33ff39e1cda6a1d72cf9b82b189fd4","adebd9ca1906046f1858f232811c1fba9efc7392","24db6005eb2d45b510b24efc035429c9fe922c87","d2d593ca5430cc3ea5903c91e57665a41a81af3c","cfcdf7d55f90e2ffebc07b1023fdbf268afad27a","8351c3831157dbae7c9841e0bb620c1c5d19c167","52dba6aa82c2e9389ea33bef94e1cd5f8586a048","17e223420cdb98c44f43cac4879c3996484df7da","d395e6efad8a39fc9e157f84f7515cc55b5a6a06","83bc9a74a102a5d510037399396f8e500bc5f2be","dfdc61351d1281c4e8ed8c0e0fe9cdc24546370f","6d802558d2559a24e2072e1f426a4b725c71b40f","a7224797e0f120ae736187c63fe52ddb91faabb7","72a957ad8dfa89665aaf3adbe3016c953f32b63b","11196f2629376a3557add0368dd94a3dde9ebbb9","74b96a5a34f7a891ffb593ef5a331ec58fc50bcb","add8cdd8ac14ad8dd989859169b4ccdc5cd75101","a26403dab0fc65ea6160d80746097e6df79f10e9","d14f92d97f852dbbc0e0fe3c0b58bb6dd69e07fa","4cb916e86f22387fa44208584ccd35717af86256","2f6b5acfbbe659078ed439e7b3f280db3ab113b2","e5a4ad2b41cd47ae7b4b52ae309399a227d9d14b","a2d9f4099ca742f899859ba5fc6153b365a69984","e63614f22ca2bfa012b1c68ddd7184e81d70ce76","0fa90b1d86a592c6b5291180bfaf1829cd06b632","e3194f74f07c7f1e865f0707ae7fa84be356460a","52929f5350e22997237b3ea28db1597d4c2ae257","e69a5b35f7191177dd281231a398b59f804799c2","c5ed9890e51f0af917210e4412bdeee9b5c02b7e","2224937b97495be5eb45462838474a6b418ae418"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Gastric motility: comparison of assessment with real-time MR imaging or barostat measurement initial experience.","doi":"10.1148/radiol.2242011412","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1148/radiol.2242011412","venue":"Radiology"}

In the past, we adding the knowledge that we have only from school. But now, we can get the knowledge in every activity. One of the activities is a game online. Playing a game online has advantages, but gamer realizes that the advantage is refreshing only. The gamer could get many pieces of knowledge and educations like it said before. One of the knowledge is financial literacy and personal financial management. There is a possibility that playing a game online brings effect on financial literacy and financial management. The descriptive quantitative research has the sample from economic education’s college students of FKIP UKSW (56 students of the classes of 2015-2017). The data was collected form questioner and tested by simple regression. The result shows that playing the game online brings effect on financial literacy. But on the other side, playing the game online do not affect financial literacy. Keywords: game online; financial literacy; individual financial management . Abstrak. Pengetahuan tidak hanya didapatkan dari pelajaran yang diselenggarakan sekolah secara formal. Salah satunya adalah bermain game. Selain menjadi sarana hiburan, game online juga menjadi sarana edukasi. Hal ini membuktikan bahwa game online tidak hanya memberikan dampak yang negatif namun juga dampak yang positif. Banyak macam pengetahuan yang dapat diambil dari penggunaan game. Salah satunya adalah pengetahuan mengenai literasi keuangan. Penggunaan game online ini juga memiliki kemungkinan pengaruh pada pengelolaan keuangan sehari-hari. Tujuan penelitian ini untuk mengetahui pengaruh yang terjadi pada penggunaan game online terhadap literasi keuangan dan pengelolaan keuangan. Penelitian deskriptif kuantitatif ini mengambil sampel 56 mahasiswa angkatan 2015- 2017 Pendidikan Ekonomi FKIP UKSW. Data didapatkan dengan cara menyebarkan kuesioner menggunakan simple random sampling. Setelah data didapatkan, dilakukan pengujian regresi sederhana. Berdasarkan pengujian tersebut, didapatkan hasil bahwa penggunaan game online berpengaruh terhadap literasi keuangan. sementara itu, penggunaan game online tidak berpengaruh terhadap pengelolaan keuangan.

Moreover, these new environments and related applications expect physical and cognitive interaction capabilities of the robot. This evolution requires the integration of many different fields of research to be carried out by a multitude of experts. In order to bring this integration challenge to a good end, a systematic and model-driven approach to software is needed, which should result in flexible, reusable, and adaptable software. This paper describes the Composition Pattern [3] as such a systematic approach to model robot applications. It is an architectural pattern to systematically structure, i.e. to contain and connect, types of behavior. It builds on and provides a constructive way to apply the 5C’s approach to separation of concerns [2]. The pattern can be applied to analyse, model and implement applications. Earlier work introduced the Composition Pattern as software architectural pattern [4]. The focus of this paper and presentation will be on the modeling aspect.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/34629429.pdf"],"title":"The Composition Pattern for model-driven robot application development","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":"ICRA 2015"}

SK&F 96365 (10-50 &mgr;M) reversibly inhibited twitches, tetanic contractions and muscle and nerve action potentials. The IC(50) was 17-24 &mgr;M. The inward Na(+) current was suppressed and its recovery from inactivations delayed. Crotamine, a peptide toxin that binds to neurotoxin receptor site 3 of the muscle Na(+) channel, enhanced the inhibitory effects of SK&F 96365 and reduced the IC(50) to about 4 &mgr;M. Veratridine had similar effects, although it was less effective than crotamine. On the other hand, the crotamine-induced membrane depolarizations and spontaneous discharges of muscle action potentials were inhibited by SK&F 96365 noncompetitively. The inhibitory effects of tetrodotoxin and tetracaine were additive with those of SK&F 96365 but were enhanced slightly by crotamine. The results suggested that SK&F 96365 acts on a distinct site and blocks the Na(+) channel fo excitable membranes at a concentration range that inhibits the receptor-operated calcium channel.

Klein","ids":["29604923"]}],"journalName":"","paperAbstract":"The KArlsruhe TRItium Neutrino (KATRIN) experiment aims at the model-independent determination of the absolute neutrino mass scale. \nFor this purpose, KATRIN investigates the imprint of the neutrino mass on the tritium beta spectrum near its kinematic end point. \nKATRIN employs a high-luminosity Windowless Gaseous Tritium Source (WGTS), which creates $10^{11}$ beta electrons per second. \nThe beta electrons are guided by a strong magnetic field up to 6 T to the Main spectrometer, which acts as a high-pass MAC-E filter. \n \nInadvertently, tritium ions are created from the source gas by tritium beta decay and inelastic scattering of beta electrons. \nUnder nominal conditions, $2\\cdot 10^{11}$ positive ions/s leave the WGTS along the magnetic guiding field towards the spectrometers. \nThere, they could create background due to the radioactivity of the tritium and via the ionisation of residual gas. \nFor this reason, the ion flux into the Pre-spectrometer (PS) has to be restricted to $1\\cdot10^4$ ions/s. \n \nRing and dipole electrodes were therefore installed in the KATRIN beamline in order to block the positive tritium ions with electrostatic potentials and to remove the stored ions via $E\\times B$ drift in negative dipole potentials. \nA proof-of-principle for the ion blocking and removal was achieved in the First Light measurement campaign in 2016 with a pencil beam of non-radioactive deuterium ions. \nNevertheless, the ring electrode potentials could be neutralised during tritium operation due to the trapping of secondary electrons and negative ions in the positive potential wells. \nFor this reason, a constant monitoring of the ion flux into the PS was installed and used during the First Tritium measurements in May and June 2018 with about 0.5% of the nominal tritium concentration. \nWith regard to ion safety, an upper limit on the ion flux into the PS at the aspired level of $1\\cdot 10^{4}$ ions/s could be derived via the ionisation of residual gas in the PS. \nDuring the first scans of the tritium beta spectrum with KATRIN, a current measurement in the PS monitored the ion flux into the PS continuously. \nIn the meantime, a current measurement at the one dipole electrode closest to the source measured only about 50% of the expected ion flux, while the other dipole electrodes observed no ions at all. \nSuch inadvertent ion blocking had already been observed during First Light and is attributed to work function differences of different beam tube materials. \nWhether the inadvertent ion blocking also occurs during measurements with 100% tritium and how the trapped ions might affect the neutrino mass measurements needs to be subject of future investigations.","inCitations":["707800a70c51aed220f58028eca9af1a401ff7f4"],"pdfUrls":["https://publikationen.bibliothek.kit.edu/1000093526/25868743"],"title":"Tritium ions in KATRIN: blocking,

(API), anaerobic multitest microsystem (MICRO) was compared with the Center for Disease Control conventional (CONV) thioglycolate (supplemented with hemin and vitamin K1) system and with pre-reduced anaerobically sterilized (PRAS) media as recommended by the Virginia Polytechnic Institute. Growth from a solid medium was suspended to produce standard inocula. Substrates included 16 carbohydrates, indole, urea, gelatin, and esculin. API strips were inoculated in air and incubated in GasPak (BBL) jars. MICRO tests were read at 1 and 2 days. CONV tests at 1, 2, and 7 days, and PRAS tests at 3 weeks. One hundred thirty well-characterized strains of anaerobes (76 gram-negative rods, 16 cocci, 26 gram-positive nonsporeforming rods, and 12 clostridia), including 48 reference strains, were studied. Of 2,600 tests performed, 2,085 (80.2%) showed agreement with all three methods. There was 90.9% agreement between the MICRO and CONV, 84.9% between the MICRO and PRAS, and 84.6% between the CONV and PRAS tests. All MICRO tests were reliable except for indole, which was not sensitive enough, and gelatin, which was very insensitive. The MICRO system permits performance of biochemical tests at the workbench in the average clinical laboratory without the need for expensive equipment and time-consuming procedures.","inCitations":["e139ca88d669eab077ac937dca09bc77e1c634f8","6bcd56deee7b11468269654eeeb18c39eece5cbf","b7fa6e5144a7ff904775dd283794448ee2aad585","6b5ea8b60b6b92c42f8561629713f8f902e78c90","8f372ce542763d2f7d172519c1c0c2d307678a46","5923e1df96f8d65ba60cc1f2eeb188ca71018328","ab77433dfd70170933743694571e1fb24539491b","e17accc5f0010da6424ea1a1dd35a52f940302cc","6d4cb7bad07b0164a66bab7e04f265d5a70fd231","c8cb1198ccae76ba5795f02e4257262ddead9f5e","4634f95621fbb01c5a47eed31604c87086ae1609"],"pdfUrls":["http://jcm.asm.org/content/1/1/15.full.pdf"],"title":"Comparison of three procedures for biochemical testing of anaerobic bacteria.","doi":"10.1128/jcm.1.1.15-24.1975","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1128/jcm.1.1.15-24.1975","venue":"Journal of clinical microbiology"}

The K(+)-specific aptamer sequence in MBA is used as the molecular recognition element, and the high binding specificity of MBA for potassium ions offers selectivity against a range of metal ions. The hairpin-type MBA labeled with a fluorophore and quencher at both termini undergoes a conformational change (by complexation with CPEs) to either an open-chain form or a G-quadruplex in the absence or presence of K(+) ions. Conformational changes of MBA as well as fluorescence (of the fluorophore in MBA) quenching or amplification via fluorescence resonance energy transfer from CPEs provide clear signal turn-off and -on in the presence or absence of K(+). The detection limit of the K(+) assays is determined to be ~1.5 nM in the presence of 100 mM Na(+) ions, which is ~3 orders of magnitude lower than those reported previously. The successful detection of 5'-adenosine triphosphate (ATP) with the MBA containing an ATP-specific aptamer sequence is also demonstrated using the same sensor scheme. The scheme reported herein is applicable to the detection of other kinds of G-rich aptamer-binding chemicals and biomolecules.","inCitations":["f03b0bd9de8cc28d1efd7a37e1a9cf9a876add3f","599471d661d593fa97d85b45e59891a76a3ff5a0","940b2cf72c81d6da864c5cf829e13999c879d66d","5e6ef212b634445b179a767742d693ae45b432f1","4b4c9ca248193f88c0f7691980c13347a55af97d","a50bf8f22cde7e3821737111aa568b8853824c7f","f40996c83de27c6a0c924c3767dc299fbc497eb5","68b000e308ae8d40cd2705961f950e643d0fc3b5","ed4ff03f0948d6776ecfd7c70773c47129d8d32d","9cb13b1f6775a2babe284a842679183bf933f0f3","ccc1e20d8ee0a111eb67e98f1a41d8ce74b2d0f9","dc5a2879070f8ed8bdba469ae584b22133dbf377","73ce4ff209e6c90907f1ddd91a08dcd128432f6e","c0b98cea1bcac8bc867db708bc904ea64ab0c33f","dadbb29fa2761c96b6d66a30d3b84c3822c69ab3","26ffbf3dcb75580cc1ff6437fdcf64f31188fd39","e9adf432711361959114e20b92c1e40e4d668865","4b20de3fb543edf2a030106f280f8be38a9b0820","b16aabc709568a1a1c67f5860a31ded0ef09658a","c3e0a05f74203c61656a534e6b7b98ad334ef90a","fc2af6980768b5f7289ce185cd85ee468fad7cf3","f7bb7137092ba5aab531aca7ad032f27df919a45","bdaa276e0064fe46b12fc3832e8162d8a7233236","cec1f8b4e3a3f6a4fceed40702792ecce539b00e","e2265ba10760c7eba2056538c765c4c8a6c4c7dc","5889b58e22661dacb5f2f0c79ffcbc7bf295fbe3","bc44ac4aa8c05018c51410505871cfeff5f49f6a","a949a31e2ca3a10147cbaa9871050274957cff43"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Cationic conjugated polyelectrolytes-triggered conformational change of molecular beacon aptamer for highly sensitive and selective potassium ion detection.","doi":"10.1021/ja210360v","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1021/ja210360v","venue":"Journal of the American Chemical Society"}

The activism of Emma Big Bear Holt (Ho-Chunk) and the Conley sisters (Wyandot) in the early twentieth century are connected by the history of Indian removal. Earthwork and burial site activists used traditional knowledge, alliance building, family kinship networks, and civic activism. The Midwest is a site of Indian removal and earthwork and burial site activism which revises narratives of Indian removal that textually erased the Ho-Chunk, Miami, and Wyandot. Earthwork and burial site activism bear the marks of indigenous self-determinative action in the past and present. The activists’ history resists narratives of American Indian defeat. Rather it supports the idea that American Indian activism can be found even in the most oppressive periods of federal policy. Furthermore, their story demonstrates that “Indian Removal,” best known as the coerced relocation of the southeastern tribes to Indian Territory, affected many tribes, with devastating effect. Earthwork and burial site activism was self-determinative. The story of Indigenous activism at earthworks in the Midwest is not a simple one. Rather, this is a tale of continuous reform and activism that extends well into the twenty-first century.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Sites of Sovereignty: American Indian Earthwork and Burial Site Activism in the Midwest, 1917–1968","doi":"10.31835/crdh.2018.03","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.31835/crdh.2018.03","venue":""}

Imaging identifies the safest approach to a lesion and, during the procedure, confirms the position of the biopsy device relative to the abnormality and to important structures such as the carotid artery. The following article reviews the various techniques used in the head and neck region and emphasizes those techniques that particularly apply in the maxillofacial area. General considerations Most biopsies are taken from palpable lesions without image guidance. In the exceptional case where an initial biopsy is not definitive, image guidance can confirm that the sample is indeed from within the questioned abnormality. At the authors’ institutions, most candidates for image-guided biopsies have lesions deep to the mandible or in the thyroid region. Thyroid biopsies, which are usually performed with ultrasonography, are beyond the scope of this article. Primary lesions deep to the mandible can be categorized by their location. The information from initial imaging may obviate the need for definitive preoperative biopsy. However, in many cases, confirmation of histology is requested before planning the definitive therapy. Almost always, imaging can place a lesion into pre- or poststyloid parapharyngeal space, the masticator space, or the retropharyngeal space. Such localization narrows the possible diagnoses into limited categories and may give enough information for planning therapy. Lesions of the poststyloid parapharyngeal space are typically posterior to the carotid artery. Most are paragangliomas (glomus vagale) or nerve sheath lesions. Although there have been fine needle aspirations of paragangliomas, most clinicians consider the diagnosis established by either imaging (CT or MRI) or occasionally by angiography. Treatment planning does not require biopsy. Similarly, a surgeon may plan a surgical approach or choose long-term monitoring for those less vascular lesions that have no aggressive features and are likely nerve sheath tumors. In the rare case that is not typical of paraganglioma or nerve sheath tumor, an image-guided biopsy may be considered. For instance, an irregular infiltrating margin is not typical of nerve sheath tumors or paraganglioma, and such a lesion is appropriate for biopsy; however, such tumors are extremely rare in the poststyloid space. Prestyloid lesions pass anterior to the carotid artery and styloid process and posterior to the medial pterygoid muscle and mandibular ramus. Almost all of these lesions are of parotid origin, and most are benign. Most clinicians consider fine needle aspiration a safe procedure, and there are reports of core biopsies performed without complication. Seeding along a needle tract is a theoretical possibility, but documented reports are extremely rare. If a lesion has the","inCitations":["d290bd009da60a8c4b980d4c6a1986c12b9cc35c","de93438a15b4eba387f364e2136ca7060b4c40c2","250515596cd50f09b01317acb2a091859830b252","17deefc32a7b9853ad0392e216bfbd12199bca92","c93c854f68e2aadbd4a24b4f860373422789c586","2518f2d8366fe72f568b4a0660ea33d60d0c8b6f"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Imaging-guided biopsy.","doi":"10.1016/j.cxom.2004.10.003","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cxom.2004.10.003","venue":"Atlas of the oral and maxillofacial surgery clinics of North America"}

The aim of the present study is to demonstrate the validity of these categories by investigating possible differences between diagnostic patient subgroups on various measures. Methods: 1064 patients with a diagnosis of non-affective psychosis (schizophrenia N = 731 (paranoid type 82%), schizoaffective N = 63, schizophreniform N = 120, psychosis not otherwise specified/brief psychotic disorder N = 150) participated in this study. Dependent variables were demographic and clinical characteristics, severity of psychopathology, premorbid and current functioning, and indicators of quality of life. Results: Within the diagnostic group of schizophrenia, no significant differences were observed between paranoid schizophrenia, disorganized, and undifferentiated schizophrenia. Patients with schizophrenia experienced more severe psychopathology and had poorer levels of current functioning compared to patients with psychosis not otherwise specified or brief psychotic disorder. Differences between schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder were less clear. Conclusion: Our results do not support the validity of schizophrenia subtypes. Schizophrenia can be distinguished from brief psychotic disorder and psychotic disorder not otherwise specified. These findings may fuel the actual DSM-V discussion.","inCitations":["fdd1b15e30164f2d87bd450d541bb077965cbad7","049d58099436eac7fb8ceb592e0b8c225105daa2","ed2273bb003e8e6b8aece60da876597a19a6faa9","6538fa9aaa8543b0d50e844b2a459f4088781e2e","c1936535ed541970a16c9b7d1fe21df387583e9b","cc033059ff719867e70d4f33710696c8a6230440","0b018df1b654959d37b03fdde4c1a76b34e4bee5","b6df6b113345da78988d707d753feb44bf50683d","6c2c778c88a1d9c86002e4cf6ae82350a43a8ed8","82ebb3cfcfc081ea9c0fa9fc3ba89e2482f8a73a","7e5f4bc6c9b8506da9f4cc700a0e143380565c92","0870289b53db7e6c97a34278016a08a8938314a8","d7910334b9beb0877337a9a5430c850324f6b09f","427095b096751497e9511c45476808a78564083c","46a51451daed3f34659c4c171e92b2ac9395b023","f38eea26f8747fa3185eb114b53e531c64cf09ac","c37fbcaec7cbb7a7045317840e2ff84ebc705c72"],"pdfUrls":["https://pure.uva.nl/ws/files/2057256/141973_07.pdf"],"title":"The Validity of the DSM-IV Diagnostic Classification System of Non-Affective Psychoses","doi":"10.3109/00048674.2011.620562","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.3109/00048674.2011.620562","venue":"The Australian and New Zealand journal of psychiatry"}

The history of medicine teaches us that the knowledge of our body is a fascinating topic that continues to be the subject of study and research. The Italian anatomical museums are mostly university property, often closed and with specimens in urgent need of restoration. Their rooms still house important collections of human biological samples, dry or in liquid, collected between the eighteenth and twentieth century: a historical heritage that testifies to the evolution of medical science and provides a searchable archive of biological and genetic data. The curator of such a museum must confront many issues - museological, legislative and ethical - many of which are unclear and incomplete.

All of the numerous previous suggestions rely on asymptotics where eventually, an infinite number of observations from the tail behave as predicted by extreme value theory, enabling the consistent estimation of the key tail index, and the construction of confidence intervals using the delta method or other classic approaches. In small samples, however, extreme value theory might well provide good approximations for only a relatively small number of tail observations. To accommodate this concern, we develop asymptotically valid confidence intervals for high quantile and tail conditional expectations that only require extreme value theory to hold for the largest k observations, for a given and fixed k. Small-sample simulations show that these “fixed-k” intervals have excellent small-sample coverage properties, and we illustrate their use with mainland U.S. hurricane data. In addition, we provide an analytical result about the additional asymptotic robustness of the fixed-k approach compared to kn → ∞ inference.","inCitations":["eb55723398201d9acd0154e9f6e91547b6998d1d","e81f51a17a7a156d9306db16d886d0798d649a0a","bc7914da3021b5d3483528625d9b06cd1c7661bf","39cc684985b145119d6861951fa921503d1f5d27","d3960fdf4db9e71d76664af06b8c96e6f131822d","075f8f9e913727743b71bd4be1a0f17404810926"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.princeton.edu/~umueller/tail.pdf","https://www.princeton.edu/~umueller/tail.pdf"],"title":"Fixed-k Asymptotic Inference About Tail Properties","doi":"10.1080/01621459.2016.1215990","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1080/01621459.2016.1215990","venue":""}

One of the missions of the Institute is to foster research and analysis on public policy issues of importance to mid-life and older Americans. This publication represents part of that effort. The views expressed herein are for information, debate, and discussion, and do not necessarily represent official policies of AARP. Acknowledgements To the memory of Geneva Kirk Brooks and those who stood with her, and to all other homeowners who seek the truth and fight for their rights, I dedicate this proposal. This proposal would not have been possible without support from Andy Kochera of AARP, and many homeowners, advocates, friends, and family, some of whom must remain anonymous. In particular, I want to thank the following people who both have spent many years to help homeowners, and whose persistently wise advice has shaped this proposal that I hope will benefit others: Beanie, Bob, Tom & Chris Adolph (creators of HOAdata.org), Foreword Common-interest communities play a valuable role in modern America, and generally operate amicably to the mutual benefit of residents. Homeowner associations in a single-family development, for instance, are often able to provide a number of amenities (such as parks, pools, and club houses) that would be difficult to procure from many cash-strapped local governments. In addition, by setting architectural standards and maintenance requirements, they may help reassure residents that their investment in the community is well protected. Associations also frequently provide an opportunity for neighbors to meet and socialize as a consequence of regularly scheduled meetings, thus helping foster a sense of community. Some homeowner associations, particularly in gated communities, take responsibility for maintaining private streets, removing snow, and even collecting garbage. Local governments frequently welcome the relief from those burdens. Because associations often promote neighborhood infrastructure and social opportunities, they can be viewed as important players in promoting livable communities for people of all ages. 1 It is noteworthy that 46 percent of owners in single-family homeowner associations are over the age of 50, as are 56 percent of owners in condominium/coop communities (based on AARP Public Policy Institute analysis of the HUD/Census Bureau American Housing Survey). The purpose of this publication is to outline a key set of ten principles (articulated as a \" bill of rights \") that states can follow when developing laws and regulatory procedures for common-interest communities.

The goal of WiScape is to provide a coarse-grained view of a wide-area wireless landscape that allows operators and users to understand broad performance characteristics of the network. In this approach a centralized controller instructs clients to collect measurement samples over time and space in an opportunistic manner. To limit the overheads of this measurement framework, WiScape partitions the world into zones, contiguous areas with relatively similar user experiences, and partitions time into zone-specific epochs over which network statistics are relatively stable. For each epoch in each zone, WiScape takes a minimalistic view --- it attempts to collect a small number of measurement samples to adequately characterize the client experience in that zone and epoch, thereby limiting the bandwidth and energy overheads at client devices. For this effort, we have collected ground truth measurements for up to three different commercial cellular wireless networks across (i) an area of more than 155 square kilometer in and around Madison, WI, in the USA, (ii) a road stretch of more than 240 kilometers between Madison and Chicago, and (iii) locations in New Brunswick and Princeton, New Jersey, USA, for a period of more than 1 year. We justify various design choices of WiScape through this data, demonstrate that WiScape can provide an accurate performance characterization of these networks over a wide area (within 4% error for more than 70% of instances) with a low overhead on the clients, and illustrate multiple applications of this framework through a sustained and ongoing measurement study.","inCitations":["4d1db0418c122114c74affbc8c740c85fc7159b7","34ce771c07edd6c8b363a8d57f5f2cbf56a8cac3","e6a79f68fffabca11f37e93b19b72b9ae3049197","83713bee7d0ea869bd6061e2684f8880b5a32f13","5ddb041e3d63e3c491ca9a800973fd363a60a9a5","a99657091cd3d3edc94de3469b46e9f00f277173","90620fa73fb2855adfa058a5cd8139e6a8c1f2d5","5a991ebf2527c7e52b25cb528341c3527437d9ff","4c20504d92814d5f059a433d7f284cb887769613","ab75fd46f837919d29a5a2ae1d2457a819010fde","f4787aa319e541da8aa415aefa30e981706a0946","c492660ea3aa6dab6c12d9075a91dd9ce62cd398","60996a3b4612123eb8aaa96217c358a2c9fde6dd","a19fc5c8773865065e26ad3073b5c351e83d0bf8","f383a630423bef902cea7bc9d20a22a6021f3f69","62a0f96b90687dcd280dddfbfd44422cb203292a","42a0f186b1a4abada716e615b806ada4ee52942b","2d084e4dda9dc7778451e18234fb5964bcb76db8","99cddfe526a3ad58d5f918a487ea7cadeada0885","5b6f4ffe8dee9fb50e9655cb6df799c5608becce","21698aa68d06d84ab16200adf743976241f4b30c","7134296178ede11a5809b6634268d252fbcdf7de","b7bf99b72d64b23f305c380354b799a1572a5b2c","19e597cba24fc125c63f29dbec1eb46ddfc1ab3c","cd15a0f4a26ea81f741f6f7b9869ebd0733429fc","6c5a7760784f8007d4b6d9eb533d0b477046a10e","aec60aee833aae30761db04c810d350ca905ee22","0a2428fd8fbc9c32f1f641add68fe8e234bf7268","e98231b3710b0454938ca202f7806024bc67ac6c","0e95641a02bccbfb692aed45bae6a12a81c1ea1c","42448d2fa7dd28bfcd99502bc01fff9fa6054c20","e12bf1c1889f9e7cfe3a9598adb999c0292f906d","7e0164ae48a47409f25a43e16e11f13d69575f2b","82fd758661fa764ce705b3505c2d9bb6110ab28d","91e0bfd73d1550e048f02f4f23524f2f44505960","c5a6bd433c530b58527cf284ec917173a262cb48","6f79e8e6ae8c2fbba094d479a7d636cb1f28a614","e3b9776a43a5e16d29fcd20be04c34f7e15f64ab","9abe671d852973d53ef11c48301e444975c04920","f0c5b74bdd786e0393748731e7083e7c291e1c62"],"pdfUrls":["http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~sdsen/papers/2011wiscape.pdf","http://mobilityfirst.winlab.rutgers.edu/documents/wiscape.pdf","http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~yoonj/wiscape.pdf","http://conferences.sigcomm.org/imc/2011/docs/p99.pdf","http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~suman/pubs/wiscape.pdf","http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~yoonj/wiscape.pdf","http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~suman/pubs/wiscape.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1145/2068816.2068827"],"title":"Can they hear me now?: a case for a client-assisted approach to monitoring wide-area wireless networks","doi":"10.1145/2068816.2068827","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1145/2068816.2068827","venue":"IMC '11"}

A privatization of activities in the forest sector was conducted, which resulted in separation of control and production functions. The state forest service was restructured and incorporated into the structures of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forests. Under these circumstances the state takes the role of the biggest forest owner (74%), followed by municipalities (16%), private forest owners (9%) and other organizations (1%). Under this forest structure the processes of decentralization and democratization of the forest sector are of significant importance for the continuation of the started reforms. The country tests the application of multifunctional forest planning, as a form of including civil society at local (municipal) level in long-term planning. Issues addressing the future of the Multifunctional Forest Management Plans (MFMP) in educative, socio-economic legislative, regional and theoretical aspects have bee analyzed. Conclusions and knowledge from the hitherto experience in Multifunctional forest planning (MFP) were derived that are linked to the role of the procedure in developing and adopting MFMP; prioritization (forest functions); the rate of particularity in planning; ,the interest and activity of stakeholders; the place and the role of MFMP in other planning processes in the country, etc.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://oldweb.ltu.bg/jmsd/files/articles/12/12-76_G_Kostov_Paligorov_Stiptzov_Todorov.pdf"],"title":"Applied Aspects of Multifunctional Forest Management Concept – Lessons Learned in Bulgaria*","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Hence, the way in which users relate with electronic gadgets changed and this has derived in the invention of new applications. These developments within the electronic industry have demanded new materials and formulations in order to fulfil the growing requirements of new technologies and, especially in the last years, the electrification of transport. \n \nThe need to pursue research to develop safe, environmental friendly, recyclable and low-cost materials is, in this context, a pressing issue. While hybrid materials offer unique properties for the development of advanced energy storage systems such as hydrogen and solar cells, lithium-ion batteries and capacitors, these are usually expensive and entail serious environmental hazards. This thesis advances scientific analyses on the cyclomatrix organophosphazenes synthesis that could be applied for the development of low-cost and eco-friendly industrial processes for the production of electrode materials. \n \nIn Chapter 1, a brief introduction on the fundamental chemistry of phosphazene materials is presented followed by an outline description of the Li-ion batteries and dielectric materials and their current trends for the improvement of their efficiency. The research aim and objectives of this thesis are then presented. \n \nChapter 2 deals with the synthesis of cyclomatrix organophosphazene (OPZ) nanospheres. The effects of the solvent, organic base, and organic co-monomer on the morphology of the nanoparticles are studied. The morphology of the nanospheres was highly dependent on the polarity of the solvent, pKa of the base and solubility of the produced salt during the reaction. A new design for the scale up synthesis of OPZs was developed based on distillation and reuse of the solvent and organic base. The dependence of the morphology on the polarity of the solvent is further investigated in detail in Chapter 3 where a self-template-direct formation of hollow OPZs is described. The presence of water in the reaction mixture promoted the formation of nanospheres with a single hole on their surface while the reactions at higher water contents resulted in the formation of hollow nanospheres and semi-shells. \n \nThe subject of heteroatom-doped carbon nanospheres (CNS) as anode electrodes in Li-ion batteries is described in Chapter 4. A detailed analysis and discussion of the microporous structure and the heteroatom-doping carbon is presented in order to understand the structure-to-electrochemical properties of the CNS as anode materials. The ternary heteroatom doping had significant impact on the microporous structure of the CNS and their electrochemical performance. CNS with high pyridinic-N content and abundant micropores, showed impressive charge/discharge cycling stability for over 1100 cycles, delivering 130 mA h g−1. \n \nThe facile OPZ chemistry is further applied in the presence of BaTiO3 nanoparticles in order to produce electron insulating OPZ@BaTiO3 and electron conducting C@BaTiO3 core-shell hybrid nanoparticles. The successful growth of OPZ as a thin layer/coating is based on the substrate-independency of the method. The morphology and structural characteristics of obtained core-shell particles is discussed in detail, along with the results from the impedance spectroscopy characterisation. A stable relative permittivity (er ~ 35) and low dielectric loss over a wide range of frequency was achieved by adjusting the OPZ shell thickness. The initial insulating OPZ shell was transformed to e- conducting carbon shell, by a pyrolysis step at 700 °C and the resulted C@BaTiO3 showed a relatively high ac conductivity and specific surface area. The research outcome of this project together with suggestions for future directions are summarised in Chapter 6.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Synthesis and characterization of organophosphazene and porous carbon materials for energy storage applications","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}
