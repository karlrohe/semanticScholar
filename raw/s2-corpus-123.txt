Expressions for the Pfirsch-SchlUter perpendicular plasma flow velocities are obtained for a toroidal system in which the pressure profile depends on radius only. Data from Langmuir probe measurements in the shadow of the limiter is used to estimate the magnitude of this plasma convection. Because of the short density scrape-off lengths in Alcator C edge plasma (3 mm), the magnitude of the perpendicluar flow velocity can lead to significant poloidal and/or toroidal flow velocity components. If the primary contribution to the perpendicular flow velocity is from the poloidal component, then the magnitude of the poloidal flow can easily exceed that of a radial flow velocity estimated from Bohm diffusion. On the other hand, if toroidal flow velocity dominates the total perpendicular flow, then the toroidal velocity can be a significant fraction of the sound speed. As a result, self-consistent plasma density and temperature profiles can exhibit a poloidal asymmetry. Such a poloidal asymmetry may explain the preferred location of the \"marfe\" phenomena observed in the Alcator C tokamak. The scaling of the perpendicular flow velocity obtained is consistent with the observed combination of edge density, scrape-off length, and plasma current which precipitates a marfe. The poloidal component of the perpendicular flow velocity exhibits a stagnation point on the inside and outside midplane where this component changes sign. The direction of the poloidal flow is always towards the inside of the torus independent of toroidal field and plasma current directions. Since this perpendicular equilibrium allows for an arbitrary radial ambipolar E-field to be present, an E x B plasma rotation can be superimposed on these flows. In this case, the inner stagnation point can move to the upper or lower inside position depending on the toroidal magnetic field direction. If such a poloidal rotation on the order suggested by CO2 laser scattering data is included, the stagnation' point coincides with the observed upper inside marfe position for the normal toroidal field direction and is consistent with preliminary observations of the marfe moving to the lower inside when the toroidal field is reversed. Independent of the mechanism by which a marfe initiates, PfirschSchlUter cross field convection may act to scrape-off the edge plasma boundary and transport energy into the radiating marfe region. In this way, a convection/radiation power balance can be maintained, forcing the marfe boundary to be toriodally symmetric and locallized poloidally to the inside of the torus.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/93499/83rr026_full.pdf;jsessionid=4F371DEA35E82AC159AB7AB2D1C9B976?sequence=1","http://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/93499/83rr026_full.pdf?sequence=1"],"title":"Comments on equilibrium plasma flows in the limiter shadow region of Alcator C","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Nevertheless, during the same period, the number of verified trauma centers has significantly increased. This study assesses the economic drive behind this dichotomy.\n\n\nMETHODS\nOver a 1-year period, we collected financial data on 1,907 trauma patients for both Level I trauma centers and trauma/critical care surgeons. Financial data, including payor source, cost, reimbursement, margin, and reimbursement-to-charge and reimbursement-to-direct cost ratios, were calculated.\n\n\nRESULTS\nFor commercial- and government-insured patients, the reimbursement-to-direct cost ratio was 2-and 35-fold greater, respectively, for the trauma centers than for the trauma/critical care surgeons. For uninsured patients, the addition of local government funds allowed the trauma center to cover direct cost with no margin. In contrast, even with the addition of supplemental salary dollars from the institution, for every dollar in direct cost generated by the trauma/critical care surgeons in caring for uninsured patients, they recovered 55 cents, or a loss of 45 cents per direct cost dollar spent.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe economic dichotomy that exists between trauma centers and trauma/critical surgeons is significant. It drives institutional growth and, at the same time, discourages surgeons from entering the subspecialty.

Adult male rats were starved for either 16 or 72 h and the specific activity of lactase and sucrase was determined together with the absorption of lactose, sucrose, and glucose in vitro by the everted sac technique. The specific activity of lactase was significantly higher and the specific activity of sucrase was lower in the 72-h starved animals when compared with the 16-h starved group. The higher specific lactase activity in the 72-h starved animals was reflected in enhanced absorption of lactose as determined by the transfer of the constituent monosaccharides into the serosal fluid. The transfer of glucose into the serosal fluid by the glucose sac was also higher in the 72-h starved rats but not to the same extent as that of lactose. The absorption of sucrose was not significantly different between the two groups of animals. This study shows that the increase of intestinal lactase activity induced by starvation of adult rats correlates with in vitro increased lactose absorption.","inCitations":["c3d4dcbf56909cbb0740ecc416a1c49839e1b244"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Dependency of lactose absorption on lactase activity in starved rats.","doi":"10.1139/y87-362","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1139/y87-362","venue":"Canadian journal of physiology and pharmacology"}

While prior studies have examined the ecosystem of software designed for stalking, there exists an unstudied, larger landscape of apps—what we call creepware—used for interpersonal attacks. In this paper, we initiate a study of creepware using access to a dataset detailing the mobile apps installed on over 50 million Android devices. We develop a new algorithm, CreepRank, that uses the principle of guilt by association to help surface previously unknown examples of creepware, which we then characterize through a combination of quantitative and qualitative methods. We discovered apps used for harassment, impersonation, fraud, information theft, concealment, and even apps that purport to defend victims against such threats. As a result of our work, the Google Play Store has already removed hundreds of apps for policy violations. More broadly, our findings and techniques improve understanding of the creepware ecosystem, and will inform future efforts that aim to mitigate interpersonal attacks.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://damonmccoy.com/papers/Creepware_SP.pdf"],"title":"The Many Kinds of Creepware Used for Interpersonal Attacks","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":"IEEE S&P 2020"}

Approximately 600 of these children require surgery; there are also an additional 4 000 5 000 outpatient contacts per year (Fig. 1). According to open internet data of Statistics South Africa,[1] the population of Western Cape Province is estimated to increase by 5 800 per month. Their figures for population growth of Western Cape children <14 years of age are given in Fig. 2. During the past 2 years, the population increase for children <14 years has been 32 257 annually or 2 688 per month. These increases are against ever-tougher fiscal restraints in the health sector and no increases in the number of beds for burn victims or staff in the burns unit, which have consequences for burn care. In 2013, outpatient burn clinic numbers spiralled out of control, with up to 160 children attending per day. Drastic measures had to be taken and dressing practices were changed from 3-day dressings to 7-day long-acting silver dressings, with an immediate reduction in the number of patients. In 2015, a telemedicine programme was initiated using WhatsApp, with community clinic and secondary hospital doctors and nurses following up children with smaller wounds and those nearly healed or recovering after skin-graft surgery.[2] This further reduced the clinic numbers and unnecessary admissions to the unit were avoided, leading to a reduction of 22%. However, in 2017, clinic numbers started to increase again, in keeping with the population growth. We introduced a parent-orientated and parent-driven telemedicine programme for selected patients. The underlying premises for this were to address the needs of the parents and not to compromise on the quality of patient care. In an impoverished society, with an unemployment rate of 27%, it is imperative to avoid unnecessary expenditure for hospital visits, transport money, loss of work time for those employed and loss of teaching time for those still at school (school-going mothers and children). A typical clinic visit requires arriving at the hospital at 07h00, being signed in, receiving pain medication, having dressings removed, being seen by the doctor, physiotherapist, occupational therapist and social worker, receiving a new dressing, making a new appointment, fetching medication from the pharmacy and then leaving at 17h00 – on average a 10-hour day. This process of waiting has become unbearable to parents, especially when patient wounds are very small or nearly healed. Although some community clinics are well equipped to deal with minor burns and burn dressings, others lack trained staff and dressing materials. Many clinics are inundated with sick patients requiring urgent attention, and some of the rural hospitals and clinics cannot always provide transport to Cape Town for outpatients to receive dressings.[3] Parents see the dressings of their children being done by hospital and clinic staff repeatedly during the course of burn recovery. Many of them thus develop a good understanding of the process and have expressed the view that they feel comfortable to do the dressings at home. These requests were unsolicited and spontaneous. However, the important concern is the clinical evaluation of the wound progress and who would be accountable if the process is conducted at home. We made a conscious decision to have a trial of a few cases of small wounds in selected children/parents for evaluation. Photos would be taken with every dressing change and sent with parent consent by encrypted WhatsApp to a senior burn clinician for review, discussion and continuity of care. Verbal consent from all parents was obtained for this endeavour. The standard procedure included a practical dressing demonstration by the reviewing doctor, a written instruction sheet on how to proceed with the dressing at home, a timeline of dates for dressing changes and photo reviews. Dressings were supplied for 2 weeks, as well as the mobile number of a senior clinician who would review the progress and provide continuity of care. Forty-one parents requested home dressings. All children were treated as inpatients and followed up as outpatients as their wounds healed. The initial total body surface area (TBSA) involved was on average 11 (range 0.5 84.0)%. The TBSA of residual unhealed wounds was on average 2.7 (range 0.5 6.0)%. Hot-water burns accounted for wounds in 25 children and flame burns for 9, and diverse causes included electrical, contact and oil burns in 5. Anatomical areas treated were hands (n=17), body and extremity (n=20) and face/scalp (n=6). The number of WhatsApp consults was 2.9 per patient (range 1 9). Seventeen children were from outside Cape Town, and 2 from as far as Mpumalanga. Dressing advice was given in 30 cases; 6 children were called back for skin-graft surgery; 2 were asked to return to outpatient clinics and 3 were readmitted to hospital (1 for burn-wound sepsis and 2 where parents were anxious about wound progress). Questions from the parents included what to do for itching, whether children could start weight-bearing on the burnt limb, sun care and scar care. No parents expressed dissatisfaction.

Emphasis has been given to in vitro research results, discussing the action of radiofrequency (RF) waves on biological systems as well as those results of thermally induced cell death in terms of MNP cell interactions. Our main goal has been to provide a unified depiction of many recent experiments and theoretical models relevant to the effect of applied electromagnetic fields on MNPs after cellular uptake and the cytotoxicity assessment of MNPs. We have addressed the effects of RF waves used for in vitro magnetic hyperthermia on eukaryotic cells regarding physical modifications of the cellular local environment and cell viability.","inCitations":["db7955085384f5967bc5695c5286a6ce9c7a98c4","38dd27abca9c4e1de7c81785f8abd6413bb44200","bffe2efb8b8df578a3486982f78f85b0c71f9d5e","583e086d9b618ca1463169ecde33eca7f45d867a","6b23b3ee8373687ab555cd3de8f1e1a4a30d45fd","e598be7cadefa61881cb452c70a055d0a8851192","f3cf6cb269fff5102c9c666a8403fb550c33cd8b","15df6b5ea0137ebe78f60e11302bd2cd8ac4608f","a3fc6e52dfb9c1b55cc219fcb756b0debc03159a","3f3c639cac67e912819acb5f46bb147717ec767c","e99c0736b3ea2336d278f09e6053fe58a23fe255","e945cf4aa8083a7d38f835b2a91264e782caed44","29b0d1fa9923cb17da9ac0d4e44b37ddf2d1d108","c6552fb5aeeefa656cdd738910254ed06f5dc3b4","fecb2feb4f446a7837670ccd779dcd8d197e85e6","4f88e95067e07fb61c73ef169ad5e7f48b1e89e9","bad1997d98880990674a7976bae4d86de774fdf4","4656aeea90a80d96d5006a332c9a7178bb84634f"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.unizar.es/gfgoya/index_archivos/PDF/IJH_Review2013.pdf"],"title":"Cell death induced by AC magnetic fields and magnetic nanoparticles: current state and perspectives.","doi":"10.3109/02656736.2013.838646","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.3109/02656736.2013.838646","venue":"International journal of hyperthermia : the official journal of European Society for Hyperthermic Oncology, North American Hyperthermia Group"}

Although band positions move to lower wavenumbers (longer wavelengths) across the forsterite–fayalite compositional binary in a generally linear manner, specific feature shifts in transmittance data are described best by two linear fits with a break in slope near Fo70. The break in slope may be accompanied by an offset as well; both traits are attributed to structural changes in olivine brought about by distortion of the crystal lattice by Fe. Reflectance and emissivity spectra exhibit similar trends in band position with composition, and all three types of data demonstrate that some olivine band strengths change across the Mg–Fe solid solution series and also are diagnostic of composition. Olivines have been identified in a wide array of thermal infrared spectra of planetary materials and have been interpreted as being present on the surfaces of Mercury, the Moon, Mars, and a number of asteroids based on the analysis of thermal infrared spectra. New linear least squares models of the emissivity spectra of olivine-bearing Martian meteorites enable a preliminary estimation of the accuracy with which quantitative estimates of olivine abundance and solid solution composition can be derived from the spectra of mixtures.","inCitations":["7586fddf3469773d0ced906b0fc3e408a4c88ab7","e62647f5d1296323873f0274070cf250f3dddf05","de9d1f43cbb892929dc478a75a520009c077c4e9","2787d5c886e4194fc94afae5bfd6258e0a8df830","d0026c9e8ca26515954c55d4120dc50620293194","eea93684e59cb4c730581eab7626a222b7c9e08a","4cce90b25372b09e12f5b7032f6fff975efee544","c20dc143ccb097031662bf4986be15fb4c28252c","682791363924f0b97763a3b8e86912b1687f451d","b7881aaee759505b805fdeb57fbc1d2c2d15ae0b","cd9926a9b111ae8950761d9af64e3c07c0df062d","57b527020c992efb750e1b3009d2ef12e46e1851","63271ea075836cfb5b3bd89144767cde7f3d5aba","ee9e11ed9ebf60dfac748c8d9a7943dfdde649d7","d95f2e252fefa9794fb25d2f77c659169928cd15","63f743eb9c00dec2df7c4d3ff0d7d4b7420fa271","6a46e4fa50c3a742c92c566917c42f0b23b13501","3aed043bc8a99229886f6676851fd9e4c2028f89","d66b4c1a14938b8db2dc6d6f760054cddcfe58f3","bb75137f107f3c1478cad073a199c98eaac18e2f","7dc628943288bbb567cc7a79d594bc64bf47c2b0","1a7451508eab865faf2a8676710025f31eeb483c"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.boulder.swri.edu/~hamilton/papers/Hamilton_ol-review_2010.pdf"],"title":"Thermal infrared (vibrational) spectroscopy of Mg–Fe olivines: A review and applications to determining the composition of planetary surfaces","doi":"10.1016/j.chemer.2009.12.005","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chemer.2009.12.005","venue":""}

Bream were left untreated (CK), or were treated with alginate–calcium coating (T1), alginate–calcium coating incorporating 5% Vc (T2), or alginate–calcium coating incorporating 0.3% TP (T3). The fish samples were analyzed periodically for water loss, microbiological (total viable count), chemical (pH, total volatile basic nitrogen (TVB-N), thiobarbituric acid (TBA), K -value) and sensory characteristics. The results indicated that coating treatments retarded the decay of fish compared to uncoated bream. T2 more efficiently inhibited the growth of total viable counts than did T1 or T3 ( p p","inCitations":["e8c15f52c98328a0d11864e4bbcf97abb4101235","7af215c47ae203a490ced88d4b18024fdf9d9ce2","4622e9903d493102caaaf4174c7305babb824cf6","0edbe850d2e59066a56f40ae23977c9d2aac6b2e","cbcddb3dd9452354ad2d9b7d90d93e331cfd8db4","75e22e8c92913b8fe16b274fa63d83245b92e553","013046992c267dd72021666e36ccdf77970b4e60","96a47f32f203d3b1aef3af0f71614e0cbf5349fc","0cdbffca283479eb2e8d80ef3e44e8667f0609a8","f51485ef0504c70e864656e795eb2ec14111efa8","4bde6189000b30fbc6970c2557afc612a163ef74","6c333047c73214d11b86b728ae4fd91611b235a7","aca685bfbc531f987863a72ac79f85a654d91656","ddeac613b129dadac927237e48f9efa44d884264","7fca1236bcb1c0da768fcf78721937df904369fe","6aa8ad06a188454015b5c2103bd36ea40c77f34d","9024c27ba22bfd125a78a4f45be404260148c126","9586d77325701e8b53cc12f7676e0d4fb336d909","c2cb57f754d6236b76da0954a7de550bb74688ea","60a46df3a894b28d67205cfb13903f152e85386b","518e4c8e78f2278990775955bef55ac95b56c08a","0cd4e3205b8cb781705418a96d4e7706b1af5af9","939b3c4be28aa7436fbfc0823eb1fb70011d5f65","cf52180ba44cb588a788507ed109144d188f53ec","9740b5204db5cc90c16d472d656b32de5ed21d28","901cdf570d6cf9c344709a878cc6250cb068369b","d55324b14a0954ac43a102bbf6dfacd2dfca83c5","771c3eb2c99ad4887c5fce7a9a5647175cd2f0f7","d93637fe2ce1fafa151727f797779da80afbbc9b","5616452f80261651224aa729edd0069cd4d8602d","9de861d06815db676af371173d78e5d1ddb1d079","c90314bf8361bbae26eee1290cc27c5c8ad67742","2289b78e4eb0b0475aebf464bcf7e9dc54eed5d3","c1f0dfa760434e3bd3d23c710b00ba9d30822341","cb9aa1f42c2eea3ae2b0d1ec4f64dcb3e4d16c60","0010371f5cc733fbc40b5465d48e44f9da53d05a","5bc3a549f4748111b345e2a9cd46b114821b7dc7","e655ea70c3ba6c53c59f4945afe31f4f3bce24da","faa309e513f38d3c9ceb0a2727999b481115dd10","9eaefbcde48e0e11a557516db78cef564c715cd8","f420b3697c4dcca78a83c51deb9ed17ae6752172","3d37791066a3fd7c9c348490b5b7e5f110ba02f4","a91b9138c019b05069aa20c73e52dacc959bf39c","b237bea2ff893dfc54ee23a86c1b1efb49423a81","3f93f90aa805ee527a9bfa96efed8f79029076d0","f4397a4c0b40cfefc7e46ba0739c196176b5b66f","a2273fe0e930e59ec3ea188fb4f090609bdd0e79","aaa3c07b76d0eb3657bb45c29912cf4e16da85f3","bd9e85bc75ff66fee3c2f3830b5577bb35d0062d","6e7d063234b4247ae53d7551bcadf0ad98c44070","0366db11f2824fb2bf9bf3fe73bbce05a7e6c0fa","a76a62c6fcec21460e38151d503e5e3a9163fba9","2ed170d62fdbd7f1ba38605bed20af5de70593c4","45cfa3982634474534318f95e25a3365fedb2232","63291d248462044d5011e333f3eb75828a534ad6","8a45fd51bcae086ca11504bf314a4ec3ea8a853b","64cd495f2154bbef201c88abd0c0b4b9cde37dd4","489725d9f703e1e209e3d5809b884475a0cd52d2","95b93bb8e6cc8491a509eae1559471002e791fa5","3106e659c93e5d4514d71bec0a946604e0df7bc6","8406953fda7efe6212edb887c6e4cdc3fc56d068","b1c0d37eb46ab79046a78a6cde8b4963716d41da","86f73d821aeb024a18c0d6e3baebeaffbbe1f01a","c453dcec4d779d6e7c44fe22a30c28fe8c28e94e","42a29272a7394c152114f4b15eae9651c57438d7","42e54270010296fd0a8cd304e760924c8fbe90d8","979a21b1ac00c692e0ea0221157320d163a16e94","8f7412209b4d57f6fed1a0a249f548b3c82994c3","d8420b403cdce0fb4a065fd0c776102247db874e","1d461f2cb06211e84ffdc0422e9c61ce605184d9","ef5f3f445c48bf3bb0da5832bd1c39c1ecd846b0","61963d02886cabe939941c4dc643df3c1212670d","4e566ca86b2f179342e3a62349cb6ff1ef070a1d","6c186eeae1e2bfece3cca172a52b1922858b27f6","32ccf5bce8982f9e0349de281ae66c7b8dddfd5a","0c2dc8dc07996e19bdc70aea365d559864e7e4f5","43e2248f62e91b101832d5ae662108db097ea365","ec28f2cc7aa86e898a36cfec8e6d1a715bc959ec","f6466e7303d5e4b840b9d2ad7e594225a99c3d63","912721333409400da3ecfcc2156c3be11fdbb031","4322927737d74d12fb059cff187f625ebe62ef8b","5a5f69ebf5b5a7d72746791d62a9330930091e06","e506391120d469b4fa3b13eec1dd2e5cd2ae3f18","a990d2afc816512384d0c258040909820e80f75f","9fa4c6af207e7686d255800e720d18c0f648b311","d647781dbe5eb9c69e5fcf9dca84ff37c6b13d3c","3255acac739182a909761fa36d16b3b71f8253a3","8dabdc1286020c12fb5d9e7e3a9a7208daba326d","fcedaac7bb21b8b1c622276ba720322cde4659ee"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.qim-eurofish.com/FILE_DIR/02-05-2011_15-52-46_35_Y_%20Song%20et%20al_%20Effect%20of%20sodium%20aliginate%20based%20Food%20Control%2022(2011)608-615.pdf"],"title":"Effect of sodium alginate-based edible coating containing different anti-oxidants on quality and shelf life of refrigerated bream (Megalobrama amblycephala)","doi":"10.1016/j.foodcont.2010.10.012","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.foodcont.2010.10.012","venue":""}

Since such models often involve dozens of variables, the number of theoretically feasible alternatives can be astronomical. Without computational aids with which to search such a space, researchers can only explore a handful of alternative models. We describe a procedure that can find information about the causal structure among latent, or unmeasured variables. the procedure is asymptotically reliable, feasible on data sets with as many as a hundred variables, and has already proved useful in modeling an empirical data set collected by the U.S. Navy. © 1992 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.","inCitations":["f54b51c2c5995e2a7543c4f219edf2f1e4be1f6c","5b3b9fe128e6849d59a26d7ceda57baad2524815","d7e9e0b7d4285d6d4fb0017f2590775d3327766a","ec7b42e16a1273b625cc0f8b5cfed8791442c3d0"],"pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1002/int.4550070704"],"title":"Finding latent variable models in large databases","doi":"10.1002/int.4550070704","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1002/int.4550070704","venue":"Int.

The national economies are in effect heavily dependent on exogenous income and income generated from natural resources (Philippot, 2009). The latter account for a large part of government revenues : 26.8 % in DRC ; 28.6 % in Cameroon ; 53.9 % in Gabon ; 67.6 % in Chad ; 79 % in Congo ; and 88 % in Equatorial Guinea (FMI, 2012).","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://www.observatoire-comifac.net/docs/edf2013/EN/EDF2013_EN_chap9.pdf"],"title":"CHAPTER 9 AllocAtion And use of forest lAnd : current trends , issues And perspectives","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Subsequently, 25 patients were enrolled on a phase 1 study of MRX-1024 concurrent with radiation therapy (RT) with or without weekly cisplatinum. Toxicity and mucosal events were evaluated weekly.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOral MRX-1024 resulted in rapid and dose-dependent increases in plasma D-met concentrations with a half-life of 3 hours. When administered concurrent with RT without chemotherapy, it was associated with a modest increase in grade 2 (two of six patients) and grade 3 (one of six patients) emesis. In those treated with MRX-1024 along with RT and weekly cisplatinum, there was no appreciable increase in emesis. Overall, five patients withdrew from the study due to emesis (four grade 2 and one grade 3). Only one incidence of dose-limiting toxicity (grade 3 emesis) was identified in 25 patients (4%). Finally, in 18 evaluable patients treated with MRX-1024 at 100 mg/kg twice daily (BID), the incidence of severe (grade 3) oral mucositis was 6% (1 of 18) with no grade 4 mucositis.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThere is a dose-dependent increase in D-met exposure following MRX-1024 administration at 50 and 100 mg/kg, and MRX-1024 is safe for use concurrent with combined radiation and chemotherapy. The observed rate of mucositis seems less than that for similar treatment regimens within the published literature.","inCitations":["381413cf63db1e6ccaf22d00a96c400e9c79e293","fd924b027c20712ccd4dd619c0b9db470a1d59c3","7aee6f539f756417ad1f6ec0ddc46464c4815457","93409dac547854308f16caa13d535ea800a08813","92545552dc7e63a370b77fc5b080ee592c405eec","eb2830e8d60fc32f2ffb697d38c9163175671328","63d5d10c6a0fc3e968ba0bdb2586397a5814e28c","7849d9c02722e67d6a1ba096d4429413b8223d97"],"pdfUrls":["http://clincancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/clincanres/16/9/2666.full.pdf"],"title":"Pharmacokinetic analysis and phase 1 study of MRX-1024 in patients treated with radiation therapy with or without cisplatinum for head and neck cancer.","doi":"10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-09-3318","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-09-3318","venue":"Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research"}

And it is generally the most expensive, least efficient and most problematic part of the overall delivery process. The Indian E-commerce Industry is growing in great momentum. Compared to just in 8 million in 2012, in 2014, about 35 million people are buying products online. This number is expected to grow almost three times to 100 million in the next two years. The industry has seen many-fold growth over the years, but the logistics and delivery segment that caters to e-retailing have not seen much growth during the period. The success of ecommerce business largely depends upon an efficient last mile delivery. But the ecommerce logistics in India suffers with several bottlenecks .Currently, the logistics and delivery companies service less than a third of India‘s postcodes. In India as fast growth in ecommerce is mainly triggered from smaller cities and towns, a robust delivery network to reach the remotest town is need of the hour. The study aims to identify the importance of last Mile delivery, the present situation of Last Mile Delivery in India, the future prospects and a comparison of last mile delivery in India with other developed markets .The study also tries to identify the changing role of Indian Postal System in E-commerce last mile delivery in India. The study is based on the analysis of the secondary data only published in Newspapers, Periodicals, Journals and various websites. In future, e-commerce companies that can deliver the goods and services at a reasonable cost will have the edge. The ability to fulfil and deliver orders on time could determine an e-tailer‘s success. Many Indian Companies are adopting a range of new technologies that may help them overcome the last mile challenges.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://conf.kln.ac.lk/iprc2015/images/iprc2015_Abstract_Volume.pdf","http://repository.kln.ac.lk/bitstream/handle/123456789/11086/40.pdf?isAllowed=y&sequence=1","http://www.kln.ac.lk/conf/iprc2015/images/iprc2015_Abstract_Volume.pdf"],"title":"The challenges of Last mile delivery in Indian Ecommerce Scenario","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

For elderly cancer patients, it has a significant impact on quality of life, morbidity, and mortality. Nevertheless, depression is under-diagnosed and under-treated. Cancer management is key in improving the quality of care in this population. We aim to identify sociodemographic, clinical, and treatment-related factors of depression in elderly patients during chemotherapy, thus allowing early detection of patients in need of specific treatment. Further, we investigate whether chemotherapy efficacy and safety are associated with depression.\n\n\nPATIENTS AND METHODS\nA prospective multicenter cohort composed of incident cases of cancer diagnosed in patients 70 years and older, receiving first-line chemotherapy. Depressive symptoms were measured by the Geriatric Depression Scale at baseline and after four chemotherapy cycles. Associations between depressive symptoms during chemotherapy and patients' clinical and treatment characteristics were identified by logistic regression.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAmong 344 patients measured for depression before chemotherapy, 260 had a second assessment at the fourth treatment cycle. At baseline, 45.4% were depressed, and 44.6% were depressed after the fourth cycle. Independent factors of depression were depressive symptoms at baseline (odds ratio (OR) = 6.7, p < 0.001), malnutrition (OR = 5.1, p = 0.014), and risk of malnutrition (OR = 1.6, p = 0.014). After controlling for missing data, effective chemotherapy was associated with a lower risk of depression (OR = 0.4, p = 0.018).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nWe highlight the role of depressive symptoms and nutritional status at baseline, on the occurrence of depressive symptoms during chemotherapy. These factors should be taken into account in any pre-treatment consultation and appropriate nutritional and psychiatric preventative measures established.

The described operating method, which uses a 6.5-mm parallel drill sleeve, allows the safe and strictly transversal positioning of a 7.3-mm screw on each side with the threads interlocking. It provides a separate and fracture-adapted compression of the screws. The interlocking SI screw threads increase the pull-out strength. Operating time and radiation dose can be reduced significantly by this method.","inCitations":["4cb6d8a3efb90f90b44a5295ac176d1c20ce0dab","369a588215260df25ccedb69d45208e2cc767dcc","12ebb5a49764dbb08baa92804bcaaafbbbda8297","5de3a73d36a8d9e391504bfc30b3a13c6496c091","0ebb79acc1859d647ffb6d3481a528cbcf7bac62","e798c2396eee763fc15471b0129998c3e922bc21","b82f9e9d05ecabec9c63b4343c66c2effce6be72"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"[Minimally invasive fixation of a sacral bilateral fracture with lumbopelvic dissociation].","doi":"10.1007/s00113-008-1563-0","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00113-008-1563-0","venue":"Der Unfallchirurg"}

Some of the symptoms caused by CEVd in tomato plants resemble those produced by the phytohormone ethylene. The present study is focused on elucidating the relationship between CEVd infection and ethylene on disease development. To this purpose, the ethylene insensitive Never ripe (Nr) tomato mutants were infected with CEVd, and several aspects such as susceptibility to infection, defensive response, ethylene biosynthesis and ribosomal stress were studied. Phenotypic characterization revealed higher susceptibility to CEVd in these mutants, which correlated with higher expression levels of both defense and ethylene biosynthesis genes, as well as the ribosomal stress marker SlNAC082. In addition, Northern blotting revealed compromised ribosome biogenesis in all CEVd infected plants, particularly in Nr mutants. Our results indicate a higher ethylene biosynthesis in Nr mutants and suggest an important role of this phytohormone in disease development and ribosomal stress caused by viroid infection.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Ethylene is Involved in Symptom Development and Ribosomal Stress of Tomato Plants upon Citrus Exocortis Viroid Infection.","doi":"10.3390/plants9050582","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.3390/plants9050582","venue":"Plants"}

Sawdust is regarded as a waste material and is effectively utilised as sawdust concrete in the construction of buildings. It is capable to be utilised as light-weight concrete and holds the quality of long duration heat transfer. In this study, three different ratios (1:1, 1:2 and 1:3) volume mix proportions of cement to sawdust were adopted to make sawdust concrete. At varied intervals of 7, 28 and 56 days of air curing, thermal and mechanical properties like workability, density, elastic modulus, strength and heat transfer were probed of mentioned sawdust concrete proportions. The resistance to elevated temperatures was also evaluated after 28 days of age; weight loss, residual compressive strength, surface texture and ultrasonic pulse velocity were considered in evaluation process. The findings showed that increase in sawdust volume affected to decrease the workability, strength and elevated temperatures resistance. However, the concrete having higher proportion of sawdust performed competently and well in terms of thermal conductivity. Moreover, a decrease in the heat transfer of sawdust was also observed. Examining the all-embracing mechanical and physical properties, sawdust can be effectively utilised in the construction of buildings.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://jurnalteknologi.utm.my/index.php/jurnalteknologi/article/download/12774/6491"],"title":"Mechanical, Thermal and Durable Performance of Wastes Sawdust as Coarse Aggregate Replacement in Conventional Concrete","doi":"10.11113/jt.v81.12774","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.11113/jt.v81.12774","venue":""}

This species has been used as a commercial microalgal feedstock of proteins, lipids, and chlorophyll for nourishment and aquaculture. As such, reliable and easy genetic modification procedures should be developed to improve this industrial microalga. In this study, a pGreen 0029 vector containing an eGFP gene under the control of a Ubiquitin promoter and Npt II, which is a selective marker gene, was constructed to explore and optimize the electroporation method of C. pyrenoidosa . The optimal transformation efficiency was approximately 101 ± 7 transformants per μg plasmid and was obtained under the following conditions: 5 × 10 6 /plate cell density in logarithmic phase; 30 μg/mL plasmid; 660 V pulse voltage; 3.5 ms pulse width; and 30 μg/mL G418. The Npt II and eGFP genes were identified successfully at the DNA level after transformants were screened and purified. High-intensity green fluorescence was observed in the transformants by using fluorescence and laser confocal microscope. Results showed that foreign genes in the transformants were integrated stably and could be expressed. Hence, the efficient transformation system of C. pyrenoidosa can be used to biotechnologically improve this important industrial microalgal species and to facilitate systematic functional genomic studies.","inCitations":["fecc31dda982f41b59ca1f4d8a6e704819693f9d","f0b0287773212604b841a876d0729633160fdc46","e45d2ddd8c1f00bc800377593fc8b475a895309c","6b78564814940852e7133834209e1b4758485d9e","99fa5f460f4b5331f8e1e14d2cf63a2c6f0a338f","abd80b880f9fe271caea8dca887eeb58bb52b790","23fd4c5922b92969c0e7440aee73cb9e19ce1ddb","8e37667773a7ea9e9b695b7ee582eb5e4dd32cdc","26d89703f158db8877a04fe7e0effae375581206"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Stable nuclear transformation of the industrial alga Chlorella pyrenoidosa","doi":"10.1016/j.algal.2016.05.002","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.algal.2016.05.002","venue":""}

California decriminalized marijuana effective January 1, 2011; we examine the impact of this change on marijuana-involved driving.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe used laboratory testing from roadside surveys and the Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) to assess impacts on weekend nighttime drivers and fatally injured drivers, respectively. We calculated marijuana prevalence (measured by laboratory-confirmed delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol [THC] in roadside surveys and cannabinoids in FARS) and compared corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) to identify statistically significant changes post-decriminalization. We also conducted multiple logistic regression analyses to determine whether the odds of marijuana-involved driving increased significantly after controlling for potential confounders.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThere was no statistically significant change in the prevalence of THC-positive driving among weekend nighttime drivers (n=894) in 2012 (9.2%; 95% CI: 6.3, 12.2) compared to 2010 (11.3%; 95% CI: 8.5, 14.0) or in the adjusted odds of testing positive for THC (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]=0.96; 95% CI: 0.57, 1.60). In contrast, we found a statistically significant increase in the prevalence of cannabinoids among fatally injured drivers in 2012 (17.8%; 95% CI: 14.6, 20.9) compared to the pre-decriminalization period 2008-2010 (11.8%; 95% CI: 10.3, 13.3).

Debates over foreign funding take part among and between NGO activists, members of political parties, journalists, and intellectuals in seminars, informal gatherings, and via the media. In addition, the government adds to the debate by determining the legality of accepting funds from abroad.

Chronic intra-accumbens administration of CG3509 (5 x 5 micrograms over 3 days) induced: (a) a significant (P less than 0.05) reduction in intra-accumbens CG3509 (0.5 micrograms)-induced hyperactivity, (b) reduced levels of TRH-LI in the nucleus accumbens but not other brain regions, (c) a marked increase (107%, P less than 0.01) in histamine-induced non-locomotor hyperactivity. 3. The present results demonstrate that alteration of central TRH function following treatment with a TRH analogue enhances the effect of intra-accumbens histamine on behavioural hyperactivity, possibly via changes in H1 receptors and suggest that the neuropeptide, TRH and histamine interact in behavioural arousal mechanisms in rat brain.","inCitations":["dc7683da6edca072a9b59611f1bc21e65509a248","27b3470e257a2eb45f6f4940fc27b433f687b3e2"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Effect of chronic intra-accumbens administration of the TRH analogue CG3509 on histamine-induced behaviour in the rat.","doi":"10.1111/j.1476-5381.1989.tb12012.x","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1476-5381.1989.tb12012.x","venue":"British journal of pharmacology"}

However, the available concurrent programming models force a difficult choice, between simple models such as mutual exclusion that produce little to no concurrency, or complex models such as Read-Copy Update that can scale to all available resources. \nSimple concurrent programming models enforce atomicity and causality, and this enforcement limits concurrency. Scalable concurrent programming models expose the weakly ordered hardware memory model, requiring careful and explicit enforcement of causality to preserve correctness, as demonstrated in this dissertation through the manual construction of a scalable hash-table item-move algorithm. Recent research on relativistic programming aims to standardize the programming model of Read-Copy Update, but thus far these efforts have lacked a generalized memory ordering model, requiring data-structure-specific reasoning to preserve causality. \nI propose a new memory ordering model, relativistic causal ordering , which combines the scalabilty of relativistic programming and Read-Copy Update with the simplicty of reader atomicity and automatic enforcement of causality. Programs written for the relativistic model translate to scalable concurrent programs for weakly-ordered hardware via a mechanical process of inserting barrier operations according to well-defined rules. \nTo demonstrate the relativistic causal ordering model, I walk through the straightforward construction of a novel concurrent hash-table resize algorithm, including the translation of this algorithm from the relativistic model to a hardware memory model, and show through benchmarks that the resulting algorithm scales far better than those based on mutual exclusion.","inCitations":["6c76024c36914e2fb3b6eebae7d0117c53d36921","26135d98e11ae1634deef690adcba7d52f79e3ee"],"pdfUrls":["http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~walpole/theses/triplett_phd.pdf","https://www.pdx.edu/computer-science/sites/www.pdx.edu.computer-science/files/Triplett.pdf","http://www.pdx.edu/computer-science/sites/www.pdx.edu.computer-science/files/Triplett.pdf","https://pdxscholar.library.pdx.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1496&context=open_access_etds"],"title":"Relativistic causal ordering a memory model for scalable concurrent data structures","doi":"10.15760/etd.497","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.15760/etd.497","venue":""}

Carbonate platforms fail to develop in such settings as a consequence of sea-surface temperature instability, nutrient excess resulting in high biotic surface productivity, and oxygen-depleted conditions associated with upwelling and oceanic surface circulation. In contrast to modern patterns, extensive Paleozoic carbonate platforms developed along the eastern boundary of the paleo-Pacific Ocean (western margin of North America). Tectonic and sedimentologic evidence suggests that marginal oceanographic barriers (island arcs, thrust belts, suspect terranes) existed during much of this interval. These barriers effectively protected landward carbonate platforms from the adverse conditions typical of open eastern ocean basins. Without these barriers such extensive platforms may not have developed. In regions that lack evidence for structurally or tectonically controlled highlands, the existence of eastern ocean basin carbonate platforms may serve as an important clue in paleogeographic reconstructions of the continental margin.","inCitations":["1ae08783981498fe6cfd7f9775c9e5c4b4f350fb","f11c95db744421f8aba4b3c73ebd330aee5e2d85","37d3178dd59412ef809a37f96441448d756f44e0","96fd108b2679e11b13afd7141e9bdd682999940a","873b90c324f907f5a0a68dd367eb006b05f4af91","5ba48fb0afba2ceee245bd2d1410c7b0526cd1f1","c9f1bc9aecef09e928da38cddf1cb1d9815e2228","54a793e0c6a2eacfdbfdbf451053c79c9af140cc"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Barred basins: A model for eastern ocean basin carbonate platforms","doi":"10.1130/0091-7613(1995)023<0625:BBAMFE>2.3.CO;2","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1130/0091-7613%281995%29023%3C0625%3ABBAMFE%3E2.3.CO%3B2","venue":""}

To measure the effectiveness of restoration and to understand the drivers of these functional responses, we monitored five restored urban streams that represent a range of channel morphology and restoration ages. High and low elevation floodplain plots were established in triplicate in each stream to capture variation in floodplain connectivity. We measured ecosystem geomorphic and soil attributes, sediment and nutrient loading, and rates of soil nutrient biogeochemistry processes (denitrification; N and P mineralization) then used boosted regression trees (BRT) to identify controls on sedimentation and nutrient processing. Local channel and floodplain morphology and position within the river network controlled connectivity with increased sedimentation at sites downstream of impaired reaches and at floodplain plots near the stream channel and at low elevations. We observed that nitrogen loading (both dissolved and particulate) was positively correlated with denitrification and N mineralization and dissolved phosphate loading positively influenced P mineralization; however, none of these input rates or transformations differed between floodplain elevation categories. Instead, continuous gradients of connectivity were observed rather than categorical shifts between inset and high floodplains. Organic matter and nutrient content in floodplain soils increased with the time since restoration, which highlights the importance of recovery time after construction that is needed for restored systems to increase ecosystem functions. Our results highlight the importance of restoring floodplains downstream of sources of impairment and building them at lower elevations so they flood frequently, not just during bankfull events. This integrated approach has the greatest potential for increasing trapping of sediment, nutrients, and associated pollutants in restored streams and thereby improving water quality in urban watersheds.","inCitations":["c431a0a9a44675dd982399ebd0a2b2552e5c9b92","58bf31811ae3e6f284ded453d4f6196f12ea45bc","7215318811db01a8d0f4bcdb8214123a801ffbb2","9e32a928d70bfc52006aec48897fb80848392016","efd6370316c1527f9b57541afd03eba654545bb3","cc2ec7f5e2efc1d032ae330c9f5ecc43e6501ff3","5dc72e9d74ec847350932deff58d78caac4f73a8"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Increasing floodplain connectivity through urban stream restoration increases nutrient and sediment retention","doi":"10.1016/j.ecoleng.2017.08.006","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoleng.2017.08.006","venue":""}

Since plants routinely encounter sustained periods of stress, sufficient to limit their growth and reproductive capacity, one means of achieving this goal of increased productivity is through a greater understanding of the complex adaptive responses that plants have evolved to combat these various forms of stress. Plant stress is classified as being either biotic (as a result of infestation by pests, pathogens, and/or weeds) or abiotic (as a consequence of unfavourable soils and/or climates, including inadequate or excessive supply of water). Biotechnology not only offers new opportunities and technologies for understanding the underlying mechanisms enabling plants to respond to stress, but also provides a powerful tool in the production of crop species with increased tolerance to biotic and abiotic forms of stress. \n \n \n \nThe current chapter serves as an introduction to the section on Agronomic Traits where key issues and recent developments in the improvement of crops to respond to stress, are addressed. It thus provides a brief overview both of the current status and future perspectives of transgenic crops with enhanced tolerance to pathogens (chapter Unavailable ), insect pests (chapter Unavailable ) and herbicides (chapter Unavailable ). Furthermore, it considers the molecular bases of plant adaptation to abiotic stress and the use of QTLs and marker-assisted breeding for the production of crops with increased tolerance to abiotic stress (chapter Unavailable ). \n \n \nKeywords: \n \nAgronomic traits; \nBiotechnology; \ntransgenic plants; \nbiotic stress; \nabiotic stress; \ninsect resistance; \npathogen resistance; \nherbicide tolerance; \nQTLs","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Engineering of Crops for Improved Agronomic Traits","doi":"10.1002/0470869143.kc018","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1002/0470869143.kc018","venue":""}

O presente trabalho tem o objetivo de disponibilizar um tipo de REA, os videos, do Repositorio de Outras Colecoes Abertas (ROCA), em um ambiente online de vizualicao de videos educacionais abertos, denominado neste trabalho de REA Player. Cada video do repositorio ROCA tem uma pagina que especifica suas informacoes e disponibiliza um link para download do video. A solucao pensada para conseguir pegar todos os videos e disponibiliza-los de forma online no REA Player, seria atraves de um WebCrawler, que fosse capaz de rastrear todas as paginas e coletar os videos. Assim, foi desenvolvido um WebCrawler, na linguagem de programacao PHP, para realizar o rastremento no ROCA e armazenar os videos coletados dentro de um banco de dados e do banco eles ficarem disponiveis na web mais especificamente no REA Player. Acredita-se que o movimento REA pode contribuir para educacao, ele gira em torno de uma educacao colaborativa, acessivel e diversificada, que esta inserida nas tecnologias, ou seja, esta inserida tambem na sociedade e suas transformacoes.

The authors report a case of incidental discovery of LCH on ultrasound examination.\n\n\nCASE REPORT\nThe authors report the case of a 9-year-old boy presenting with isolated and painless increased volume of the left testis, with no clinically palpable mass. Scrotal ultrasound revealed an echogenic mass, 12 mm in diameter, with a solid appearance and several hypoechoic areas, without calcification, situated in the lower pole of the testis. Tumour markers and gonadotropin axis hormonal assessment were normal. On surgical exploration, the testis had a macroscopically normal appearance; opening of the tunica albuginea revealed the lesion and enucleation was performed. Histological examination confirmed the presence of LCH, 5 mm in diameter. The postoperative course was uneventful. Physical examination and scrotal ultrasound have remained normal with a follow-up of two years.\n\n\nDISCUSSION\nThe authors recall the characteristics of LCH, which usually presents, in children, in the form of signs of precocious puberty or more rarely by gynaecomastia. The lesion is rarely palpable. Scrotal ultrasound reveals a homogeneous mass with several hypoechoic nodules. An endocrine assessment must always be performed (frequent elevation of LH). Surgery should be as conservative as possible (enucleation-resection). Histological diagnosis may be difficult.","inCitations":["d245f5d7792f208a86d5d21c5b119b78b5fa2e74","75b141085e31ca3e54d959fbad6cdcbf31449c8a","d97cfddfd692380a8cb975571591638585a61609","9b3756ede088b48889f2690f5623ff2512eafaec","cb60260b20e0971e474a1121150d094000a9b0dc"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"[Testicular Leydig cell hyperplasia in children].","doi":"","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"Progres en urologie : journal de l'Association francaise d'urologie et de la Societe francaise d'urologie"}
