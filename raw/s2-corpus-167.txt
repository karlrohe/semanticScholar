El brocoli (Brassica oleracea var.italica), es uno de las hortalizas que aporta un numero de elementos esenciales a la dieta alimenticia, esta planta puede ser utilizada como alternativa de diversificacion en las unidades productivas de la region central de Nicaragua que poseen las condiciones adecuadas para su desarrollo. Con este estudio se pretendio conocer el comportamiento de dos variedades de brocoli, asi como tambien la influencia de tres dosis de fertilizacion 18-46-0. El experimento se establecio en la comarca Mombachito, Camoapa departamento de Boaco, predominando precipitaciones anuales de 1,200–1,600mm, temperatura de 15–23°C y una altura de 700 m.s.n.m. El diseno experimental fue bifactorial en arreglo de bloques completo al azar (B.C.A), con tres repeticiones, evaluando seis tratamientos. A las variables a medir se le realizo un analisis de varianza (ANDEVA) con una Pr<.0.05, utilizando el programa sistema de analisis estadistico (SAS), las variables con diferencias significativas se le aplico separacion de media segun Duncan ademas de realizar un analisis economicos para determinar la rentabilidad de los tratamientos. Los resultados obtenidos fueron: en la etapa de semillero no se encontro diferencias significativas entre las variedades. En el ANDEVA realizado se encontro que solo para el factor variedad existio diferencias significativas con Pr<0.02, realizando las comparaciones de media. En la variable altura de la planta se encontro diferencias a partir de los 27 dias despues del transplante (ddt), siendo superior para el factor variedad (Green) con CV de 5.50–26.46%; la variable ancho de la hoja no tuvo diferencias entre los tratamientos, el largo de la hoja presento diferencias a partir de los 54 ddt con CV de 3.89%, para el factor variedad siendo esta Green. La variable grosor del tallo presento diferencias desde los 27 ddt en la variedad pirata siendo la unica que produjo frutos \ncomerciables. En las variables de rendimiento no se encontro diferencias significativas, obteniendo la mayor \nrentabilidad la variedad pirata con 260kg/ha de fertilizacion.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Evaluación de dos variedades de brocoli (Pirata y Green F.

Some of our European allies have joined the long war against radical Islamic terrorists, but for them the battles are also at home in London, Madrid, and in an ever-growing number of communities. Muslim immigrants have flooded into European ghettos, challenging the continent's tolerant culture and stretching its cradle-to-grave social welfare systems. In his latest book, While Europe Slept: How Radical Islam Is Destroying The West From Within, journalist Bruce Bawer presents a riveting account of the clash between a naively elitist Europe and a rapidly expanding minority of Islamic fundamentalist immigrants demanding accommodation. Bawer, a prolific author, provides an American view of Europe's Islamic crisis. He informs, challenges, and entertains with his detailed and well-documented accounts of Islamic confrontation and Europe's too-tolerant cultural response to intolerant Islamists. Not one to shy away from controversy (he has criticized fundamentalist Christianity and written on behalf of \"mainstream\" homosexuals), Bawer immersed himself for this project in European culture by learning several languages, working with the European media, interviewing government officials, and experiencing the native's lifestyle in order to provide a behind-the-scenes view of Islam's assault on Europe and the continent's cultural passivity. Military officers will find While Europe Slept a great primer on the ideological challenges posed by a rapidly growing European Islamic immigrant population and its all-too-successful efforts to force post-Christian Europe to tolerate and, more frequently, to embrace, Sha'ria. Bawer argues that the Islamic cultural assault on Europe could be replicated in America if the latter were to abandon its longheld foundational values. Bawer documents the heroic actions of Europe's few \"Paul Reveres\" who are publicly warning fellow citizens that they will pay a high price if they ignore the rapidly expanding minority of Muslim immigrants who refuse to integrate. One of Bawer's Paul Reveres, the now acclaimed Dutch cultural maverick Wilhemus Fortuyn, author of Against The Islamicization of Our Culture (book information not available) was murdered, according to his killer, for views that \"stigmatized\" Islam. Fortuyn dared to criticize Muslims for their so-called anti-Dutch values. Young Muslim men growing up in Holland, according to Fortuyn, are taught throughout childhood that infidels (non-Muslims) are beneath respect, that Western women are whores, and that the only response to the West's godlessness is the fury of jihad. Fortuyn complained, \"I refuse to hear repeatedly that Allah is great, almighty and powerful, and I am a dirty pig.\" While Europe Slept juxtaposes Europe's naive treatment of radical Muslims with its widespread antiAmerican views to illustrate cultural blindness. Both public views appear to be prompted by liberal media and multicultural elites. But those very same American values that Europeans attack-courage, patriotism, and religious faith-are widely lacking and in part explain why radical Islam is overtaking the continent. …","inCitations":["49e327b19e709b839f6e334f466e4e76a42f5559","21321f61608c75619140515f4f40408bf842dc6b","9d7b15d597b28cccbb2e86c6f62132e98ce6f9e8","b63d68c2cc24d3d81f15ced3398a376bc19448ab","8f36946fe36788a6095fc7ab2e4dbd0cafabc823","8e6cba1cdfa437cd920a6f11b45bc4236b96f54e","3ade6fee97d1708a29cfbff9ac9f6ae985a18947","37d49fa461e6c5bae05322e2f5aad37b32a87502","4638e42bb9ff4ff780d534c26d5faca45ec88880","cdc1b54313fa576cc80eeceaa3ee37518b267b07","1a16c0eb4ac48a821ae7f7c8501a1c9541ee3a11","454cedccf5b5ebaa1e26de38fcc6ef33871f23e1","eb77b73726c07bd85b2cd683f2a6d589c41822ad","307a703692363a90e035f6679451b90042bffa88","1d97b5ad266491f2cc3e231b299413c9997eb061","ec28ae50b5bdb87ce00f43dbd3e446f1f20e25f0","155af4b06a12dee3ca35ccdd116bc753887236d3","548e918522e2523bf70bb51fd610e4dd41589252","36a38b657006b46237262c0498306d0bff2d776c","4f60afcdadbec11ee34e30af6441b4677a7852cd","77e8624e203f80c7253b5381dd8a576e5e7d226d"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"WHILE EUROPE SLEPT: How Radical Islam Is Destroying the West from Within","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

We use leader identification and traditionality to operationalize the concept of leader-referenced relational-self. Significant three-way interaction effects in both the leadership-SPJ and the SPJ–OCBS relationships are found. The SPJ-mediated effect of benevolent paternalistic leadership on OCBS is significant among employees whose leader identification and traditionality range from average to high levels. The findings suggest that leader-referenced relational-self is more complex than leader identification.

The records were analysed and factors other than genetic ones, which may contribute to the rate of DIT were considered. A strict seasonal effect was not apparent, but where conditions were hot and wet there was an increase in DIT. There was also a \"time of day\" effect, with transport in the afternoon showing a higher rate of DIT than transport in the morning. It was observed that if pigs were deemed dirty at loading then DIT was more likely. Clean pigs at loading could indicate that hygienic and environmental conditions in the finishing stage were good. Individual producers showed a wide variation in their rate of DIT, with some producers regularly experiencing a high level. It was concluded that routine monitoring of the rate of DIT and transport conditions could help to pinpoint the source, and possible cause , of the problem. In addition, information that helps in the understanding of transit deaths is important because if stress in the period from selection to slaughter can be reduced, there should be both economic as well as welfare benefits.","inCitations":["e60107588897ea725fa8f9d8b891941e5f4e2513","3596e4784c3209720cc98f105d6b229b4b085cce","438902e6c2ca6b5ef1646b191e992b1405b4fa23","135d9ad8e5ea1d06cb3c1cc16abb780c7a0d3413","7667aa33f045c0c439e51346eec27a6e72b47c4a","ea17eb6d9552c807e8eec38b33faebe7021c0161","e7684b4495c54f557412eae3fe08bc66367d2e2b","f344cd8b171ab4e3314e98ca457643d94336e7ef","51cb8d3ece12bc88f658cd99e350562e20ff6198","ea3d659e1eeffb8eb0570374b9786b5c87fa26a7","099715074a533cc1232aef7d137ec618a1bb878a","d08c9d28cd2941fe322116cc30926d8070382538"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Factors influencing pig deaths during transit: an analysis of drivers reports","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

In this paper we analyze a three-dimensional model in which the cell-cycle is broken into three compartments. The cytostatic agent used as control to kill the cancer cells is active in a compartment which combines the second growth phase and mitosis where cell-division occurs. A blocking agent is used as a second control to slow down the transit of cells during synthesis, but does not kill cells. The cumulative effect of the killing agent is used to model the negative effect of the treatment on healthy cells. It is shown that singular controls are not optimal. This eliminates treatments where during some time only a portion of the full drug dose is administered. Consequently only treatments which alternate between a full and no dose, i.e., so-called bang-bang controls, canbe optimal for this model. Both necessary and sufficient conditions for optimality of treatment schedules of this type are given.","inCitations":["1b07f5b72ab68d1cb346d7ba28eb65a564dd1b72","29f299022e3cc1129a9b75b31d1f94b36a09b95e","0100b1847efad327957c02c96650064964354732","181ce7d9d2a55e7a6712f04a71d8f9381e80c206","bd9dbd00fc1a558e8a5d3bf0ebb10a4737217f2c","19712cf31df6831d5b754303b3c40fafb71d2aa8","fe5e11886bf72410eb5a3b98b44695e3928b8769","dc9636c0253c81476eea4b1e56c9dd9f224f413a","bc4219331d96bf06d981fda3e208c6fb7a071bd8","c789be75ae20df864ad28e9273ead1decba000dd","90c0fc010cb05e368686be755d138847bb6597fb","c9f65c3eca605d1a5dcb47b888356437054f5883","2b0e3c6e48ced6c130bd494e26a0a72b3704ee80","0a00e25bf9dd185ec01aab2e088715a1390c977e","61b8ac4e96ed1ba08956253f1c64bf26c06b2ad3","e1b5741987117f54303c3f57c09bb1a0951d2ee0","a1b81f9c4d75417c39043ef33b8df7a4701ee0cc","6689556f6c1fc71f675a388268ffea5d1926e42e","4a22dbb6d41e30f55b8d56c25c388232e0f1068e","cbf62d92f38070b7a76badcec3a0fcfbec8bcd6c","cd37b0267f17fb045c97d213c874d62c56368edc","4bd22a3507aa0ef7c4a83016584d69deb35d27cc","bb76b06b83b30e2692410ebb550a7137fed4644c","a2030d18180117686e9f6e593b10734486ee73e6","13fe6e44145e50a73b6af1c33bd2d4a90abd84bc","b2108fb01c1bf55e31b276e417a0fd97fae739f0","2bf6dcea5714fda43936c29291aa346825e15bf1","dfbe44c631f9277fa9c99af77ff7fd5a45bcc844","75aeeb0dd26f86127f30e45f779fa5cb5b093a79","4cad9810a20e73ec7dc054cfa953bff4db853ec8","f14abfc8cb5c59e2eff3bf9d950eec3d910ac4c5","c3503ec4f26bca8fb06d5dd0e130fafc5dd9901a","02455f694c01f7ca00a54b74988b61d80d074939","04c959f65c370b99f2e40f97466df403bd823fc8","a0c6d07bc52473e8ba1494c55b46674e22f2b089","f6bc37ad7eae182b74f8dc95527f585d79ee27ba","dbd489dd97f8e36bd1fefabb0c641c8fe3d02364","bd75528abaf25bbb8216da5bb012ec1705f6b8d4","db2fb97cec7c832fd6049bcb55a30bbf307c7591","152b1f59e1d9a3e8ef2e524b88dcf3b4e7df5c0a","1cf0c3e853b197e8ec901108322fc2142046c87d","fc27f754bd065d1c37f2727a7a3e36193c2a034c","3ddbba9f3a500c3629812467617050888791d865","415a700a28067a32b39d7837868b27b8c3fdefa1","ffec7987b36e01c068766a82c5c4b1f189665a2b","f3dc422469a94ae104c365dcc25a5e93b37ee7e9","c2a7625863aa9ea0fb3d9d546a9e931dec0883d6"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Analysis of a Cell-cycle Specific Model for Cancer Chemotherapy","doi":"10.1142/S0218339002000597","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1142/S0218339002000597","venue":""}

From the MODIS data analysis, we found a good correlation between MODIS band 2 (near infrared) reflectance and ground-based LAI seasonality. The MODIS band 1 (red) reflectance has no seasonality after snow melting. However the simulation results of the forest canopy reflectance suggested that the sensitivity of reflectance to the canopy leaf area density was small and it was a contradictory to the MODIS data analysis. These results may indicate that the timing of the seasonality in forest floor grasses coincides with the seasonality in forest canopy because forest floor LAI is still sensitive to the top of canopy reflectance. This hypothesis should be intensively investigated in the future study.

The course of COPD is characterised by exacerbations of airway symptoms accompanied by airway and systemic infl ammation. These events decrease health status, aff ect disease progression, and are an important cause of hospital admission and readmission. A UK audit of COPD admissions showed that 15% of patients died within 90 days and about a third were readmitted within a 3-month period. Thus, admissions related to COPD are associated with substantial health-care costs and much attention has been given to strategies to reduce their number. Pharmacological treatments such as longacting bronchodilators alone or in combination with antiinfl ammatory agents can reduce the overall rate of exacerbations, but only by 20–25%. Consistent eff ects on admission are more diffi cult to show. Data from the London COPD cohort showed that early intervention during an exacerbation reduces risk of admission. Therefore, novel non-pharmacological strategies to reduce hos pital admissions have attracted much interest. These strategies have typically been of two types: admission avoidance most often with so-called hospital-at-home schemes, in which patients are sent home from the emergency room or after a short admission to receive respiratory nurse surveillance; or comprehensive disease management programmes. A systematic review of hospital-at-home schemes for patients presenting to hospital for admission showed that admissions were generally reduced, translating into cost reductions and no increase in readmissions despite care of the patient in their home. Whereas disease management programmes have been shown to benefi t patients with diabetes and heart failure, programmes for COPD have had less consistent outcomes. Usually they are multifactorial and aim to optimise medical treatment and smoking cessation, before patients are educated to enable behaviour change, introduced to self-management with written action plans, and enrolled in case management so that needs to increase so as to disseminate the best healthcare practices in Europe. We should expose and tackle the root causes of ill health in all countries to ensure that avoidable health inequalities are no longer hidden.","inCitations":["8ea5609a13af20707e7718efe2bed087edaf1aac","da5181c5cd9b359ad0d07f40ec868b129fea89b9","f8f53cbd596b72f05560530dd832500667480595","3f41d712ba676bd1f1630022131b203e75ddb117","60f071b44f7df3822b9d11c28f4eb3ab3dfb981e","cbaf938aa49745019227c3bd73b8053b1dbca9bd","7142b63d08e4c5b13180b3298d34a106feca8462","a314957c3b53421bd6a4f301ad1ee04c4abf9568","a48dce7488ea8b88dd60390b228c7bd858f9d55a","60a0ebb1a9478cd25a8a742d2f6bf6767e94f0be","aa0a0b57e5fdc4523e4e4ee4af7c9506f27c30a3","123e1d33add11292b3b3cf201aa241fa6d469620","fd809cfac0ba9d932bd8743257a079fedc3675d8","4add6578d77e46864c129724645297cdee1a9698","0c0586b0108d5d8a712166fe79623b42327d8375"],"pdfUrls":["https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0140673612613397","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673612613397?dgcid=api_sd_search-api-endpoint"],"title":"Can patients with COPD self-manage?","doi":"10.1016/S0140-6736(12)61339-7","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736%2812%2961339-7","venue":"The Lancet"}

The obtained nanocrystals were characterized by transmission electron microscope (TEM), high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and FTIR. TEM and HRTEM investigations reveal that the mor- phologies of the nancrystals are flower-like, and each flower is composed of several nanoneedles with a diameter of 15-20 nm and a length of 100-200 nm. The XRD results show that the crystalline phase of the nanocrystals have a strong dependence on the mole ratio of TiCl4 to H2O and the reaction time. FTIR result shows that a chemical bond is formed between NCC and TiO2. A possible growth mechanism is proposed based on the characteristic results. The NCC whose surface is full of hydrophilic groups can establish hydrogen bonding with TiO2 to promote the nuclea- tion and crystal growth of TiO2 at low temperature. Moreover, the selective adsorption of NCC molecules on the crystal face of TiO2 varies the growth rate of different crystal planes, and the anisotropic crystal growth leads to the formation of nanoneedles. Then these nanoneedles aggregate together to assemble into a flower-like secondary structure.

Many newly sober alcoholics are concerned about their smoking and some attempt to quit. However, quit rates in this population are low. Prior studies suggest risk for relapse in this population may be genetically influenced and that genetic factors may moderate response to treatment. Methods In this exploratory study, we had two specific aims: (1) to investigate associations between genetic risk and outcome; (2) to investigate whether genetic risk moderates the efficacy of a medication intervention. Data are from a subsample of 90 participants from a clinical trial of smoking cessation treatment for smokers with between 2 and 12 months of alcohol abstinence. Subjects were randomly assigned to bupropion or placebo. All subjects received counseling and nicotine patches. To examine the possibility that bupropion may have been efficacious in participants with a specific genetic profile (ie, a pharmacogenetic approach), an aggregate genetic risk score was created by combining risk genotypes previously identified in bupropion treatment studies. Results Although medication efficacy was not moderated by the aggregate genetic risk score, there was an interaction between nicotine dependence and genetic risk in predicting smoking abstinence rates at the end of treatment (10 weeks). Conclusions Results suggest an aggregate genetic risk score approach may have utility in treatment trials of alcoholics who smoke. Additionally, these findings suggest a strategy for understanding and interpreting conflicting results for single genetic markers examined as moderators of smoking cessation treatment.","inCitations":["2543a95e5d9ddca78deeddb154f94097f89e2381","e67648863eb4d4100faa2e6e4cc07a51214abeb9","4326cece125f4dc7c1040339e3cc18f4824059ff","92531ce5c7149482a3f79106472770127c7b4571","d738529b9cd17973e08fc94ad59d6dbc4e2372ab","f3ccf3a59c71744a27cd5f9721c98bbe37afb4fd","4fae3b424f973c06dba656f9b27539d66285728b","9754eb17efa434b4959c72fdfc6c586a204b6030","c418dcf1f91e4b7f337645a29e1bb5075bbaacfc","ffb88e49cc377e9b6bcc0d8b67df42157e73c0e7","58a0b46a18b1be76d5818737d5c583b753275917","4dcd80781a8117912bd923714b706d44a3b5d425","eb021f0364e9897a6342d2c15d82477a6a125bfc","b524e25c80afa443d9038594bff9bf83b27ce060"],"pdfUrls":["https://open.library.emory.edu/publications/emory:tqpwx/pdf/","http://insights.sagepub.com/redirect_file.php?fileId=4533&fileType=pdf&filename=3353-SART-Predictors-of-Relapse-in-a-Bupropion-Trial-for-Smoking-Cessation-in-Re.pdf"],"title":"Predictors of Relapse in a Bupropion Trial for Smoking Cessation in Recently-Abstinent Alcoholics: Preliminary Results Using an Aggregate Genetic Risk Score","doi":"10.4137/SART.S8866","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.4137/SART.S8866","venue":"Substance abuse : research and treatment"}

The five methods are: Aronson’s Jigsaw classroom, DeVries’ Teams-Games-Tournaments (TGT), Slavin’s Student Teams and Academic Divisions (STAD), the Johnsons’ cooperative learning approach, and the Sharans’ Small-group Teaching method. The former three methods are categorized as Peer-Tutoring methods, while the latter two are classified as examples of a Group-Investigation (G-I) approach. Findings are considered from experimental studies with these five methods, in terms of their differential effects on academic achievement, students’ attitudes, and on ethnic relations in desegregated classrooms.

First, we use the Gaussian model to detect foreground objects and then separate the foreground and background. Second, we employ the superpixel algorithm to find the edge information. According to the superpixels, we will assign corresponding hierarchical depth value to initial depth map. From the result of depth value assignment, we detect the edges by Sobel edge detection with two thresholds to strengthen edge information. To identify the boundary pixels, we use a thinning algorithm to modify edge detection. Following these results, we assign the depth value of foreground to refine it. We use four kinds of scanning path for the entire image to create a more accurate depth map. After that, we have the final depth map. Finally, we utilize depth image-based rendering (DIBR) to synthesize left and right view images. After combining the depth map and the original 2D video, a vivid 3D video is produced.","inCitations":["86303a25a92c8c10598cdbe2bf63c902bbf7dc30","c32fbde69628886b6be56b03207f6ef0c7eef1ba"],"pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1186/s13640-017-0239-5","https://jivp-eurasipjournals.springeropen.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s13640-017-0239-5?site=jivp-eurasipjournals.springeropen.com"],"title":"A novel method for 2D-to-3D video conversion based on boundary information","doi":"10.1186/s13640-017-0239-5","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s13640-017-0239-5","venue":"EURASIP J.

How do the authors explain that 60% of the infantile cases had symptoms and signs of heart failure whereas the majority of the juvenile cases was asymptomatic? This is particularly curious as survival rates were similar in both groups. Did all those with heart failure die early? It is reported that an echocardiographic “noncompaction score” was developed to estimate the severity of LVHT. However, in Table 2, the noncompaction score is only reported for 89 patients. What were the echocardiographic findings in the remaining 116 patients? It remains unclear why implantation of a cardioverter/ defibrillator (ICD) was counted as an endpoint, and implantation of a pacemaker, on the contrary, not. Furthermore, it would be of interest to know if there were any discharges of the ICDs and if the patients who died from arrhythmia had ICDs or not. It would be interesting to know if the patients who died from arrhythmia had a normal or decreased left ventricular function. It is also of interest how many of those who reached an endpoint suffered from a NMD. Seven of the patients showed left bundle branch block (LBBB). Was institution of cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) considered in these patients? In adult LVHT patients with a LBBB, CRT has been shown to be a beneficial intervention.5–7 In conclusion, we think that more information about this interesting and large cohort with LVHT might increase our knowledge about the natural history of VHT in children.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/circj/81/8/81_CJ-17-0155/_pdf"],"title":"Survival in Young Patients With Noncompaction May Not Only Depend on Cardiac But Also on Neuromuscular Comorbidity.","doi":"10.1253/circj.CJ-17-0155","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1253/circj.CJ-17-0155","venue":"Circulation journal : official journal of the Japanese Circulation Society"}

The rates of 2,6-dichloroindophenol reduction, delayed fluorescence and electron-spin-resonance signal 1 indicate that Chl-1 and Chl-19 have an impaired activity in photosystem II (PS II), while in Chl-5 the electron transport is blocked between PS I and the reactions of CO2 fixation. Ultrathin sectioning demonstrates the presence of giant grana in the chloroplasts of Chl-1 and Chl-19, while the chloroplast structure of the Chl-5 is very similar to that of the wild-type. The grana of the Chl-19 mutant contain large multilamellar regions of tightly packed membranes. When the chloroplast membranes were studied by freeze-fracture, the exoplasmic and protoplasmic fracture faces (EF and PF, respectively) in both stacked and unstacked membranes were found to show large differences in particle concentrations and relative population area (per μm2), and also in particle size distribution, between all mutant chloroplast membranes and the wild-type. A close correlation between increasing kmt (ratio of particle concentrations on PF/EF) and PS II activity was observed. The differences in particle concentrations on both fracture faces in different regions of the intact chloroplast membranes of the wild-type are the consequence of a rearrangement of existing membrane components by lateral particle movements since quantitative measurements demonstrate almost complete conservation of intramembrane particles in number and size during the stacking of stroma thylakoid membranes. The results indicating particle movements strongly support the concept that the chloroplast membranes have a highly dynamic structure.","inCitations":["fcc1c7071f134e95ed53d768031facabe04f9ba5","468a13e57ea841b5cc87b64b39aafa5cb6a58037","a1b4ebdb4bcbeb41e910c819817b6780c66580d9"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Ultrastructural organization of chloroplast membranes in mutants of Pisum sativum L. with impaired activity in the photosystems","doi":"10.1007/BF00387428","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/BF00387428","venue":"Planta"}

(Decreto Ley No 486, 22 de agosto de 1925). Pero la debil institucionalidad llevo a que los problemas que se intentaba resolver se agudizaran, lo que se tradujo en inflacion alta y persistente durante varias decadas. La inflacion se logro controlar recien en la ultima decada, para lo cual fue fundamental la Ley Organica de 1989, que le confirio autonomia. Esta ley le permitio al banco concentrarse en alcanzar la estabilidad de precios, lo que ha conseguido a traves de un esquema de politica monetaria de metas de inflacion. A este proceso han contribuido tambien el orden de las cuentas fiscales y la construccion de un sistema financiero robusto, ambos alcanzados en forma creciente desde mediados de los anos ochenta. Este trabajo analiza la historia y evolucion del Banco Central de Chile desde sus origenes, contextualizando los distintos cambios que dieron forma a su institucionalidad actual.","inCitations":["af00aaa3473412325de30dd582b0837770948918","4e8b4e8de1ecc5cf13dd342e6223934fce53d67a","9225ac85a41d41a1e1f01c697b3d9878809f0136","39e329c06883a1ff68a81628e6ab0ab2fb3eebd4"],"pdfUrls":["https://www.bcentral.cl/documents/20143/32019/bcch_archivo_172179_es.pdf/3fc174c9-9673-2b67-5d6f-46fd7f263a9d","https://www.bcentral.cl/documents/20143/32019/bcch_archivo_137308_es.pdf/ed85930f-8a90-b835-dae2-f094f5ac7ac9"],"title":"Ochenta Años de Historia del Banco Central de Chile","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Harvesting has been largely confined to removing only the highest quality logs, leaving many inferior trees standing and much pulpwood on the forest floor. In the considerable areas of mixed forests, hardwood logging has been incidental to the recovery of the softwoods (mainly Podocarpus spp.). This highly selective logging has left large voiv.mes of potentially utilizable wood on cut-over areas, which in turn has increased the difficulty of producing second crops, whether indigenous or exotic. The recent world-wide trend to increased use of hardwoods for pulp manufacture has led to the limited use of tawa (Beilschmiedia tawa) by the pulping industry of the North Island. Of more importance, it has focused attention on the large resources of beech (Nothofagus spp.) in the South Island, and on the possibility either of their being exported as chips or forming the basis for local pulp and paper industries. This paper describes the steps which have been taken to plan for the possible management of about 2 million hectares of beech forests under the control of the New Zealand Forest Service. Two considerations were paramount in the planning approach:","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://www.nzjf.org.nz/free_issues/NZJF17_2_1972/012393FC-AF44-49C8-83CB-6E1EA1B4AA51.pdf"],"title":"Planning for Multiple-use Management of New Zealand ' S Beech ( Nothofagus Spp . ) Forests","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Oleh karena itu lokasi hiposenter Kompleks Gunung Guntur sangat dibutuhkan untuk mempelajari struktur dan proses yang menyebabkan terjadinya aktivitas magma. Posisi hiposenter juga memberikan pemahaman tentang sumber tekanan (pressure source) yang berkaitan dengan sistem suplai magma. Kedua informasi ini sangat penting untuk pemantauan dan mitigasi bencana gunung api. Salah satu teknik yang dipakai untuk menentukan lokasi hiposenter lebih akurat adalah menggunakan algoritma double difference. Metode double difference didasarkan pada kenyataan bahwa jika terdapat perbedaan jarak antara dua hiposenter yang sangat kecil dibandingkan dengan jarak antara kedua hiposenter tersebut terhadap stasiun dan memiliki skala kecepatan heterogenitas yang bisa dikatakan sama maka pola sinar gelombang yang dihasilkan dapat dikatakan identik antara kedua hiposenter tersebut. Ini dapat diartikan pula bahwa dua gempa yang terekam pada stasiun yang sama akan memberikan kontibusi perbedaan pada jarak. Relokasi hiposenter menggunakan algoritma double difference telah dilakukan pada data gempa vulkanik Kompleks Gunung Guntur. Sebanyak 504 gempa vulkanik berusaha untuk direlokasi dengan menggunakan model kecepatan dari penelitian sebelumnya.","inCitations":["a222299147c20ed22f1472f5bb8da92c6fbea406","e4278d41a54ca247362167fdf7c820ef633f3d76"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Relokasi Gempa Vulkanik Kompleks Gunung Guntur Menggunakan Algoritma Double Difference","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

I argue that coconut cups, ivories, and other European devotional objects composed of imported luxury goods should be understood as hybrid objects whose African origins would have been recognized by European viewers as among the most precious materials available and that they were left unpainted to emphasize that exoticism. Only after colonial trading posts were established along the African shoreline in the late fifteenth century would the narrative of Christian colonial triumphs begin overwriting the African origins of coconuts and ivories depicting Jesus. The relative disinterest of Western medievalists in these objects’ African origins—not to mention the historical cultures, literatures, and accomplishments of medieval Africans—represents a frustrating lapse in the scholarship, a whitewashing of European and Christian history that must slowly be rewritten through the exchanges of trade in goods, ideas, and human bodies between Africa, Asia, and Europe prior to the 1490s.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Black as a Coconut and White as a Tusk: African Materials and European Displays of Christ Before Columbus","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

En Iberoamerica se han propuesto, desarrollado e implement ado un numero considerable de iniciativas de cooperacion audiovisual regional (Ibermedia, Cinergia, Doc TV Iberoamerica, TeIB...), aprovechando en gran medida las afinidades linguisticas y culturales, y orientadas a la construccion de un espacio cult ural iberoamericano. \nEn el primer capitulo se repasan las teorias y corrientes de investigacion que ayudan a una mejor comprension de los objetivos y de la naturaleza de las iniciativas de cooperacion audiovisual, como se relacionan cooperacion e i ntegracion audiovisual y cual es el papel que las politicas de cooperacion pueden jugar en el entramado del sistema internacional de la comunicacion audiovisual. En el segundo capitulo se realiza un breve analisis de las politicas audiovisuales nacio nales de los paises iberoamericanos y como estas pueden afectar a la cooperacion e integracion. En el tercer capitulo se revisa el marco de la cooperacion cultural iberoamericana y en el cuarto se analizan los acuerdos e instrumentos especificos de c ooperacion audiovisual. En los capitulos cuarto y quinto se realiza un analisis comparado de las politicas iberoamericanas en la region en el sector cinematografico frente a las politicas de cooperacion en el sector televisivo, estudiando cinco tipo de relaciones que permiten entender el complejo entramado de la integracion y la cooperacion audiovisual en las diferentes fases del ciclo productivo de estas dos industria: propiedad, produccion, promocion, distribucion y finalmente consumo. \nEntre sus conclusiones, este estudio muestra como a pesar de la efectividad de los programas de cooperacion (con una gran repercusion incluso con presupuestos muy limitados), el espacio audiovisual iberoamericano dista de ser una realidad y que una mayor integracion en la region pasa por el planteamiento conjunto de politicas de cooperacion en el sector de la television y el apoyo a otras formas de cooperacion mas alla de la coproduccion cinematografica. Se plantean ademas retos como la incorporacion de los paises mas pequenos a los procesos de cooperacion, un mayor impulso al fomento y al reconocimiento de la diversidad cultural de la region a ser representada en los contenidos audiovisuales y una mayor coordinacion de las politicas nacionales","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Cooperación e integración audiovisual en Iberoamérica","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Arabidopsis genome contains a large number of genes encoding RING finger proteins. In this report we describe the identification of more than 40 RING-H2 finger proteins that are of small size, not more than 200 amino acids, and contain no other recognizable protein-protein interaction domain(s). We characterize RHA2b, one of these small RING-H2 finger genes. A gene trap line, SGT6304, was identified to contain a Dissociation (Ds) insertion in RHA2b gene. No RHA2b transcript was detected in the homozygous SGT6304 plants. Despite the elimination of RHA2b function, homozygous SGT6304 plants lacked detectable growth or development defects, suggesting functional redundancy of RHA2b with other RING finger genes.

For this, experimental techniques including surface light scattering (SLS) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were used at equilibrium conditions to analyze the influences of chain length, branching, and hydroxylation on liquid density, liquid viscosity, and surface tension. For probing these effects, twelve pure model systems given by the linear alkanes n-dodecane, n-hexadecane, n-octacosane, n-triacontane, and n-tetracontane, the linear alcohols 1-dodecanol, 1-hexadecanol, and 1,12-dodecanediol, the branched alkanes 2,2,4,4,6,8,8-heptamethylnonane and 2,6,10,15,19,23-hexamethyltetracosane, also known as squalane, and the branched alcohols 2-butyl-1-octanol and 2-hexyl-1-decanol were investigated at or close to saturation conditions at temperatures between (298.15 and 573.15) K. Based on the experimental results for the liquid densities, liquid viscosities, and surface tensions with average expanded uncertainties (k = 2) of (0.24, 2.1, and 2.6)%, respectively, the performance of the three commonly employed force fields (FFs) TraPPE, MARTINI, and L-OPLS was assessed in MD simulations. To improve the simulation results for the best-performing all-atom L-OPLS FF at larger temperatures, a modified version was suggested. This incorporates a temperature dependence for the energy parameters of the Lennard-Jones potential obtained by calibrating only against the experimental liquid density data of n-dodecane. By transferring this approach to all other systems studied, the modified L-OPLS FF shows now a distinctly better representation of the equilibrium and transport properties of the long alkanes and alcohols, especially at high temperatures.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Characterization of Long Linear and Branched Alkanes and Alcohols for Temperatures up to 573.15 K by Surface Light Scattering and Molecular Dynamics Simulations.","doi":"10.1021/acs.jpcb.0c01740","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.0c01740","venue":"The journal of physical chemistry.

As an illustrative example, we explore the electrodeposition of Pt at carbon-coated transmission electron microscopy (TEM) grid supports, where in a single high-throughput experiment it is shown that Pt nanoparticle (PtNP) density increases and size polydispersity decreases with increasing overpotential (i.e., driving force). Furthermore, the coexistence of a range of nanostructures - from single atoms to aggregates of crystalline PtNPs - during the early stages of electrochemical nucleation and growth supports a non-classical aggregative growth mechanism. Beyond this exemplary system, the presented correlative electrochemistry-microscopy approach is generally applicable to solve the ubiquitous structure-function problems in electrochemical science and beyond, positioning it as a powerful plat-form for the rational design of functional nanomaterials.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"High-Throughput Correlative Electrochemistry-Microscopy at a Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) Grid Electrode.","doi":"10.1021/acs.analchem.9b04028","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.9b04028","venue":"Analytical chemistry"}

The possibility of loss led to the quantification of risk, an indispensable instrument for financial organizations in order to ensure the capital adequacy required to absorb an unexpected amount of loss. Value at Risk (VaR) is a method to measure the exposure to financial risks, which estimates the worst expected loss at a given confidence level over a certain time period. In this paper, we introduce the concept of VaR, and then we describe the most popular methods of VaR computation such as the Delta-Normal approach, the Historical Simulation and the Monte Carlo Simulation. Furthermore, we present some VaR tools that are particularly useful for risk management, including relative VaR, marginal VaR, incremental VaR and component VaR.

Conceived and promoted by the global union federations, their numbers have increased considerably over the past two decades. However, as empirical research has shown, their record of implementation has been poor. We attribute this to them having been negotiated within the limits of a labour-management relationship based on ‘social partnership’. This highly institutionalized setting of dialogue contrasts markedly with the widespread incidence of contested labour relations in subsidiaries of transnational corporations and in particular throughout their global production networks. Yet, workers and their unions at such sites, where global framework agreements are most needed, have mostly not been involved in their negotiation. Instead of relying on ‘social partnership’, we argue for unions to embrace a ‘conflict partnership’ approach, one that recognizes and addresses the tension between dialogue and conflict in labour relations. To highlight our arguments, we present two contrasting case studies from the service sector.","inCitations":["2e741b24e8181656b0387ab5c114e8661d0bcbc8","e300c8fec6dbe287c16cda38fd29faf957dfd1f9","74dab9bcf9f4316a10d0f2609d456cd45f9a83fe","b7722a1fedd5d8c1a6a79f9f7e4ccdc73621fdbe","b9c27147485316b125621704b50b626c2c8fddcb"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Implementing global framework agreements: the limits of social partnership","doi":"10.1111/glob.12088","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1111/glob.12088","venue":""}

The studies showed that barley grain was infested with numerous fungi. Among them were the saprotrophic species: Alternaria alternata, Stemphylium spp., Cladosporium spp., Penicillium spp. and the pathogens: Bipolaris sorokiniana and Fusarium spp. The presence of saprotrophic and pathogenic fungi was similar on grain of naked and husked barley cultivars. Treatment before storage and storage conditions significantly influenced the frequency of grain infestation by some fungi. Saprotrophs and pathogens were isolated in smaller number from stored grain than from grain tested immediately after harvest. An increase of infestation by species of Penicillium, Mucor and Aspergillus known as “storage fungi” has been detected on stored grain. On grain treated with Vitavax before storage, the smallest number of B. sorokiniana were found.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://www.up.poznan.pl/~ptfit1/pdf/PP43/PP43_05.pdf"],"title":"Health of naked and husked grain of spring barley after harvest and storage.","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Cosci","ids":["4665462"]}],"journalName":"Advances in psychosomatic medicine","paperAbstract":"The notion that personality variables can affect vulnerability to specific diseases has been widely promoted in psychosomatic medicine. Over the time, some personality patterns have been extensively studied. Among them, alexithymia, type A, and type D personality are the most relevant. However, also temperament and character has increasingly been object of studies. Alexithymia is currently recognized as a risk factor for medical, psychiatric, or behavioral problems; type A personality is recognized to increase the risk for coronary artery disease, and type D personality has been related to adverse cardiac events and cardiovascular outcomes. The growing interest and clinical role of the personality constructs in psychosomatic medicine has been favored by the revolutionary understanding that personality factors are not causes of medical disease but their moderators/mediators, and by the decline of the psychometric distinction between state and trait. Indeed, it is nowadays recognized that psychological constructs traditionally conceived as trait dimensions may surprisingly display sensitivity to change in specific clinical situations. Assessing personality, thus, has become worth pursuing since it may give unique information about individuals with medical conditions and contribute to completely understand medical patients and their global health as well as formulating optimal decision-making and treatment planning. In this framework, the present chapter has the aim to provide insight into personality dimensions in psychosomatic medicine and describe the main instruments to assess it.","inCitations":["7cc12e1cdfba153012eab9db91c0411e33c5e35c","83d3e471a2d6aadd95d6b2137c3831ded950ea1b","6cb8949a6a56c4eef00ac7cf7d1f1eadbcdad7d4","0ba9f0ed2b49db13e6cdf8ca3b6940fffd9cd19c","37713173745901b83b6cf7ec751927a9c13d571e","16fc2c9aabdfd68897a8c86d8fe1d7e41dc0b474"],"pdfUrls":["https://www.karger.com/Article/Pdf/330014"],"title":"Assessment of personality in psychosomatic medicine: current concepts.","doi":"10.1159/000330014","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1159/000330014","venue":"Advances in psychosomatic medicine"}

Myoepithelial-derived stroma rich variant is so rare, especially with cellular atypia. Herin we describe a rare case of BCA arising in the parotid on a 25-year-old man. A well-demarcated nodule arising in the parotid that was composed of basaloid cells, forming small duct-like or tubular structures containing basement membrane-like material, as well as highly cellular elongated cells with hyperchromatic, enlarged, pleomorphic, and bizarre nuclei. Immunohistochemically, S100 protein and p63 highlighted the basal aspect of the peripheral epithelial cells and peripheral spindle and bizarre cells, while CK7 expressed on the luminal cells. We made a diagnosis of \"basal cell adenoma, myoepithelial-derived stroma rich variant, with bizarre myoepithelial proliferation\". The differential diagnosis includes cellular pleomorphic adenoma, basal cell adenocarcinoma, and carcinoma ex pleomorphic adenoma. After follow-up for 3 years, there was no evidence of recurrence. Further pathological characteristics of this disease are discussed.","inCitations":["57f0eeae522758b709a939f972c9cdb25ecde5c4","26f4273fb47c5ac230512f24c23a97078cba41b9","91b3122b25662021bcf09135952539b9dd788e67","de4ec5cae897862bcf69daa05c31ee5c1c467c55","b669e9e98dfad00508a527dcf7239bacda98d36b"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.ijcep.com/files/ijcep0000781.pdf"],"title":"Basal cell adenoma in the parotid: a bizarre myoepithelial-derived stroma rich variant.","doi":"","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"International journal of clinical and experimental pathology"}

Twenty-one lithologies are grouped into six lithofacies based on study of slabbed core surfaces: lithoclast rudstone/floatstone; porous, bioclast-lithoclast rudstone/floatstone; bioclast wackestone; intraclast floatstone/rudstone; thin-bedded grainstone/packstone (calcarenite), and dark-gray shale. The limestone facies are interpreted on the basis of petrologic characteristics, biota, regional stratigraphic setting, and facies stratigraphy as deep water and allochthonous. Biotic constituents within the lithoclasts and matrix indicate an Early Permian (Wolfcamp) age. The porous, bioclast-lithoclast rudstone/floatstone facies contains a modest but geologically significant oil reservoir at Gunnx field, southwest Reagan County. Production is from 10 ft (3 m) of perforations in about 42 ft (13 m) of pale yellow-brown porous limestone with intercrystalline, reduced and solution-enlarged biomoldic, intraskeletal, fracture, and possible intergranular porosity. Moldic porosity appears to be mainly within lithoclasts. Baroque dolomite is rare to common, and partly to completely fills former void space in addition to calcite spar and micrite. Porosity generally ranges 7-18%. The producing depth is about 9,450 ft (2,880 m), and the trap is stratigraphic. The cored sequence at Gunnx is interpreted as a basin-floor complex of debris-flow sheets, which contain the reservoir, overlain by interbedded thin carbonate turbidites, thin debris-flow sheets, and shale. The lowermost debris flow at Gunnx was deposited on a thin, generally undated shale, the lower part of which is Late Pennsylvanian at West World field. The shale is interpreted as representing starved, basin-floor deposition and abruptly overlies shallow-water Strawn limestone in core at West World field. Carbonate detrital components in the limestone at Gunnx were probably derived from a Wolfcamp platform at least 10 mi (16 km) west and were emplaced by various submarine gravity-flow processes. Age and facies determinations from cores in the Gunnx area significantly alter earlier stratigraphic interpretations made with wireline logs alone. Late Paleozoic allochthonous carbonate facies may provide significant new reserves in the Permian basin.","inCitations":["97ecf6a918664e9dcc430b77260af4b8119ffb49","ee6d9e70928d2b50959ca223012250ae09eb591d","15a37dd806b40672e1995ce60f3726138a528ee0","9a4d2f0d503f69deac1d1866e4311f9287c70b08","126d61af41e5666de579597e083cd931a6d2ccf1","eabdd0fed21ed8e746a4a9f17699c8bc02ce4b95","0b55a5b61e48725a8d45143adfcf1251a2c9435d","7027be20d30ad14580c08152e1e412b27e0344a7","594d987184e3d653cb90b2fc045ee07f5dc7f473","67c7939a0aada965fc05c43ca8e51af4d897a59d"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Early Permian deep-water allochthonous limestone facies and reservoir, West Texas","doi":"10.1306/94885601-1704-11D7-8645000102C1865D","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1306/94885601-1704-11D7-8645000102C1865D","venue":""}

At the core of this new method is the use of the method of moments, the right and left symmetrical meshing that decreases a half-patch. The new method also employs a solution for large linear systems based on the eigenvalue decomposition that resolves the stagnation problems of large nonsymmetrical matrices with large condition numbers. Using the method of moments establishes the distorted field computation model of only the aircraft net charge and the ambient field around the aircraft. This, in turn, makes it more convenient to apply the proposed method. Simulations on a real unmanned aerial vehicle are also made to validate this method and analyze the main corona-emission trigger factor. The results show that the new method could guarantee speed and precision compared with the previous methods, indicating that corona emissions are mainly triggered by the aircraft net charge. A scheme is proposed to predict the corona emissions for atmospheric electric field measurement aircraft using the new method.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"New Electric Field Computation Method for Aircraft","doi":"10.2514/1.38699","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.2514/1.38699","venue":""}

Hygienic treatment of hands is necessary in public catering establishments, treatment and prevention institutions, for immunity compromised patients, in the period of seasonal diseases, etc. Most antibacterial soaps are based on synthetic surfactants using such synthetic antibacterial additives as triclosan, triclocarbanum, farnesol, benzalkonium chloride, pyroctonolamine. Therefore, development of soaps containing natural substances in their composition is relevant. Aim. To develop a soap with sapropel, which would have the antibacterial effect and satisfactory sensory properties. Materials and methods. To make the soap the liquid corn and castor oils, solid palm and coconut oils, as well as argan oil were selected as a superfatting agent. Oil saponification was carried out with sodium hydroxide solution. The quality of the samples obtained was assessed by the organoleptic and physicochemical parameters (the qualitative number (the mass of fatty acids calculated with reference to the nominal weight of a soap bar of 100 g), the mass fraction of free caustic alkali, the mass fraction of sodium products calculated with reference to Na2O, the temperature of fatty acid (titer) gelation, the mass fraction of sodium chloride). Results and discussion. By the indicators of the saponification value of the selected components of the soap fatty base containing 43.8 % of palm oil and 25 % of coconut oil, 6.2 % of corn oil and 25 % of castor oil, and with the necessary consistency properties, soap ductility, high solubility and foaming in cold water the amount of alkali needed for making soap has been calculated. According to the results of determination of the soap consumer properties the concentration of argan oil has been chosen. As a result of studying the organoleptic and physicochemical parameters of the soap with 5 and 10 % of sapropel it has been found that the soap obtained by the cold method meets the standards for soap of the brand “Special” with disinfectants or therapeutic additives. Conclusions. The soap composition containing 5 and 10 % of sapropel has been proposed. In the laboratory conditions the cold and hot methods for obtaining the soap with sapropel have been tested. It has been found that the samples obtained by the cold method meet the requirements of the normative documentation in contrast to the soap with the unsatisfactory organoleptic parameters obtained by the hot method.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://dspace.nuph.edu.ua/bitstream/123456789/15558/1/35-45.pdf"],"title":"Development of the composition and technology of a soap with sapropel","doi":"10.24959/nphj.17.2175","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.24959/nphj.17.2175","venue":""}
