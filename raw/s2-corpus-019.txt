Arousal was related biphasically to dose (maximum at ca. 5 mg/kg) but depression increased monophasically with the dose of either agent. Both behavioral arousal and depression induced by cocaine were antagonized by bromocriptine, even at doses lacking behavioral effects alone (ID50 = 1.0 and 0.36 mg/kg [1.3 and 0.5 mumol/kg], respectively). Bromocriptine blocked depression of locomotion even when given after the initial stimulation by cocaine. Bromocriptine induced very weak stereotypy, and neither increased nor blocked stereotypy induced by cocaine or apomorphine. Cocaine, at maximally effective doses, did not deplete catecholamines or serotonin in brain regions at times of maximum behavioral arousal or depression, nor did bromocriptine after metabolic turnover of dopamine. Bromocriptine antagonized arousal induced by direct injection of dopamine into the nucleus accumbens. The ability of bromocriptine to block both the behavioral arousal and depression induced by cocaine may reflect activity of bromocriptine as a mixed agonist-antagonist with limited intrinsic agonistic activity at central dopaminergic D2 receptors, perhaps with particular reference to limbic mechanisms.","inCitations":["fefb8ddd04fda8802a70f6d0ef246b35e0fe1bb1","71b5466e1b3fb31c7a6aefc2b2a6888a4e68a572","9fca8aae77a929ddff6601493d552257f998111f","ebeabeff5523695ff0d9c19889614662ba96f536","021d05d93a2216128b198161431a9c6ea7507e3e","4c38d917da58cff80de3dd2f083cb95651997950","0f30021824f1d387561a32032994e719d2450744"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Bromocriptine antagonizes behavioral effects of cocaine in the rat.","doi":"10.1016/0893-133x(89)90024-9","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/0893-133x%2889%2990024-9","venue":"Neuropsychopharmacology : official publication of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology"}

Yet Russia has failed to achieve such control either under Yeltsin or under Vladimir Putin, its current president. This failure endangers both Russian democracy and Russian security as it creates auspicious conditions for continuing domestic authoritarianism and internal war at home as well as foreign adventurism. This article traces the consequences of that lack of democratic civilian control in the Russian armed forces from the Kosovo descent of mid-1999 until the tragic sinking of the Kursk submarine in August 2000. It assesses the reason behind the Kosovo operation as well as the Chechen war that began August-September 1999. Despite the undoubted Chechen threat, this war goes far beyond a riposte to that threat. Indeed, it reflects all of the pathologies inherent in the failure to achieve democratization and it has contributed as well to the hardening of Russia...","inCitations":["94981e07b6c4c13a1b743796ec3d21b752fda238","8c8d59c0c7d3f63f760b6e21c6ada3832d64023b","08ab9af7f7b2ea14d3d1059cb6d06ad6922c8b2b"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"From Kosovo to Kursk: Russian Defense Policy from Yeltsin to Putin","doi":"10.1080/10163270009463996","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1080/10163270009463996","venue":""}

We have found a stratospheric area of anomalously low annual cycle amplitude and specific dynamics in the stratosphere over the northeastern Pacific–eastern Asia coastal region. Using GPS radio occultation density profiles from the Formosat Satellite Mission 3/Constellation Observing System for Meteorology, Ionosphere, and Climate (FORMOSAT-3/COSMIC), we have discovered an internal gravity wave (IGW) activity and breaking hotspot in this region. Conditions supporting orographic wave sourcing and propagation were found. Other possible sources of wave activity in this region are listed. The reasons why this particular IGW activity hotspot was not discovered before as well as why the specific dynamics of this region have not been pointed out are discussed together with the weaknesses of using the mean potential energy as a wave activity proxy. Possible consequences of the specific dynamics in this region on the middle atmospheric dynamics and transport are outlined.","inCitations":["d22973b2a08400c2302f7bcb2d8b40126bee1f0c","daf7110d310e621278d8fb782002ae1bd45ed1da","8ea8724c587de3035b98f92f7e6c7b153d26818a","14c533a3d3efafe3d467e5143875a31e341b3b2a","3b46f618b56b3e7959ba0034db409438e6f69c62","84931d568b2e6a49c71b8d40bfab43a1aaa61ba4","13eb327aaf20c779a05684f24dbd48d9266f3565","6c509d24e966ac0e84496faf624fd1d851d94cc1","86bff86cfc6ae73ba3a4d9ee637a560236c70c6c","9b512bca5d3c502877cbd5045d1598760463abc5","f0e1479d5bb3c93c3bdcad3d5594cd76123001b0","478086958e02539d3d45a2191cfe819b0a089d39","9e9b00af0a7285db25bb3d4e0f9e628d0a277950","b92289143a520f6eb723425cae8993aaef48e274","a73814315adeba5f8ea2906c82b307a79c5ebfc7"],"pdfUrls":["https://www.atmos-chem-phys.net/15/13097/2015/acp-15-13097-2015-supplement.pdf","https://www.atmos-chem-phys.net/15/13097/2015/acp-15-13097-2015.pdf"],"title":"Enhanced internal gravity wave activity and breaking over the Northeastern Pacific/Eastern Asian region","doi":"10.5194/acp-15-13097-2015","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-15-13097-2015","venue":""}

Filoviral protein VP35 is implicated as the major IFN induction antagonist, while Ebola virus (EBOV) VP24 or Marburg virus (MARV) VP40 are known to block downstream IFN signaling. Despite progress elucidating EBOV and MARV antagonist function, those for most other filoviruses, including Reston (RESTV), Sudan (SUDV), Taï Forest (TAFV), Bundibugyo (BDBV) and Ravn (RAVV) viruses, remain largely neglected. Thus, using standardized vectors and reporter assays, we characterized activities by each IFN antagonist from all known ebolavirus and marburgvirus species side-by-side. We uncover noncanonical suppression of IFN induction by ebolavirus VP24, differing potencies by MARV and RAVV proteins, and intriguingly, weaker antagonism by VP24 of RESTV. These underlying molecular explanations for differential virulence in humans could guide future investigations of more-neglected filoviruses as well as treatment and vaccine studies.","inCitations":["730a18d327fe5d65bdd0f941bd56c4cb87819765","34edba415bca08b0b1e5ea66837e1b4716fc77be","59ac37dd45db1eda1cc0be6d284cf33e55e0e2c3","5cb8def62783407ecedc5bd589244b0efcb0bc22","bc0faddba0032a4c69f3f8d77bca69180f86a355","cbf4ac37fbe247487ae534db8287b36b1619dd54","67cfb764bec8a79f6a6e82e91d3c79532fb5c16d","4c388955627ea14ad55a8c203a2bb4c6df582ba7","4e4365fc5b7fd559817eb3ae026b0a017f118509","7f05094f01112523983c9033aa0ba3b0b9ca69f5","bf588e42502224678c58e64041ba5fea6d78be4b","1ecae8218841b0c9c5df6f28bfb12eb721606124","cf06ef0dc63fcbbd09b5023a83f697aa0bd040c8"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Novel activities by ebolavirus and marburgvirus interferon antagonists revealed using a standardized in vitro reporter system.","doi":"10.1016/j.virol.2016.11.015","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2016.11.015","venue":"Virology"}

On the other side we are called to maintain our capacity of learning during the entire lifetime, but: did we at any time reflect our own learning and if not: who will do? Do we understand how our students learn? The present paper aims to reflect on modalities of learning introducing a theory that tries to explain how meaningful learning works: the assimilation theory of David Ausubel. Concepts deriving from this theory may be applied in the classroom by a very flexible technique named ‘concept mapping’.

For some recombinant constructions, the human U1 gene copies were maintained extrachromosomally on the viral episome in an unrearranged fashion. The relative abundance of human and mouse U1 small nuclear RNA varied from one cell line to another, but in some lines human U1 RNA accounted for as much as one-third of the total U1. Regardless of the level of human U1 expression, the total amount of U1 RNA (both mouse and human) in each cell line was nearly the same relative to endogenous mouse 5S or U2 RNA. This result was obtained whether measurements were made of total cellular U1 or of only the U1 in small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles that could be precipitated with antibody directed against the Sm antigen. The data suggest that the multigene families encoding mammalian U1 RNA are subject to some form of dosage compensation.","inCitations":["d7d0b11c3e6834b611305be4b4dfbd5512bf4e9d","cbd3b87bb5c7cee37523da78ab177ba0ac663084","778caaf6f1383edb93ebe0bdb54398cfd65e8b24","f7897a5df025a7cac40860e7beb07f447c203045","e1705475203252caee6d689d87d232383671de4e","ec8311eabcca6047fcc9256561d2d268b486029f","767b03bc120fd799351803db2c977135bb89548b"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"U1 small nuclear RNA genes are subject to dosage compensation in mouse cells.","doi":"10.1126/science.2409601","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1126/science.2409601","venue":"Science"}

Based on historical data and technology trends, the receiver energy consumption will dominate all energy, to the point that for the majority of applications, power management research must focus on receiver efficiency. By modeling several popular MAC layer protocols, we derive bounds on performance for receiver efficiency. In particular, we analyze four abstract models, synchronous blinking (e.g. T- MAC, S-MAC), Long Preamble (e.g. B-MAC), structured time-spreading (also called asynchronous wake-up), and random time spreading. These results strongly suggest that scheduling the receiver so as to minimize (or eliminate) the potential for interference (or collisions) could be from 10 fold to 100 fold more efficient than current practice. We provide two new receiver scheduling methods, staggered on and pseudorandom staggered on, both of which are designed to exploit the untapped opportunity for greater receiver efficiency. Compared with the centralized deterministic scheduling in staggering on, the decentralized scheduling in pseudorandom staggered on achieves only slightly lower energy efficiency. In addition, we design a new MAC protocol, called O-MAC, based upon pseudorandom staggered on that achieves near optimal energy efficiency. Finally, we describe two variations of our O-MAC protocol-with local broadcast channel and preamble-sized slots.","inCitations":["1a265c46249b096e50bf219e7f501587dd5ac2d3","9cbe4d85e8bc0a199a563a3c2f0cfcf9b70894ea","6b816ac845667323f34bf3885c9b5a2a403cdc8f","cea6f66f6819d917e48783746e170d122cce5141","caaf77a4bc41a24b02eb72ca9e93374cc2935e62","e23a556c476dae73ab6309e22f35d4dc4f68c212","56ac16ae1c1658334e3e392f328285c055410d94","c71dd9b089dda45f7612f262b153724005d451cf","3b4607c1435cbb6cc19a5dd65ac3928ad03e0b8b","3fbe53982c06ad6eeaa949a0aad57f3668734cc1","3dc3271b8d491dc29f398d5a8ca8f7f9977d120b","9957fc963d69046fc20f7a7a1129d42722413bbd","ecc0d775097c3cc426e3aeae2530ff69b56502ac","e2aa2bd3b8391fa170e717f0976b42e9ecaf879f","7e13a0ed57eec2ee97a2ba3600c64223d1f68921","db6ac5c57c16a283528d4d9bab592e68b4fbe91c","36fbe6aab1be7f98790bfa5d1deecca6a5775ffc","73ef27bbf073db72b45577389fe78f0c2369781b","1de1f86abdad61be0011c42f607a1e4abbe5b51e","ece1f89e60910268a241d0f968ecce242c01c78f","404b8a34aeb463d9ddfb8dce70d7d551494a8e2f","e6c5246bb8887d95b82d6e998c7c6170ac3e7978","a5717c0fde186e321b82b9333c70be8ffda10e64","332a22211df15bebc612ed0fb9e68650dc851fbb","cf37e88eab5f08595228a52f76f6d0ad8d7a9d76","71218d9a6f0f3ed52db29a7884342cdb0ca2b4ad","c143edbd6ed8157c4b57d4e81a857e25f481a553","ba958998a5bff77bb8b6c74a150eda7175cc2165","e9ea4c31e08a9d4d6a20c273a74f42c9809c3be1","7185da246f916bdffde69e03df97549f8d209dac","e94ef8b45f31d10f4b26dab39759dc52afd9e092","f8cecd36fda0e4e27821bb7e0cb5997bc0252d3a","635c6afa0f20bb921890b73f6d296ccc2d30af8f","076d71889dcc3a18c2a18e51b8f0067aa90d8ea5","2fcf20645b84bd29f919fe5d3b02f1b19d4adc2c","e1fcb20c4fd722fbd0d344c7b54c5b27b91f42f6","d19548af5e3bfe3b98259a248623c29fd07b326c","f60bb6a282424cbc03fbb5d7ebe3e596e2867208","46e7870e7001031495ecf1997e86891f1d9067e6","431202936d6f6d8f75ba9478c7c2a3961685402d","aa820fd2f932e08bc9a590305643f25f60e11c0d"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.ieee-icnp.org/2006/papers/s9a1.pdf","http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/ICNP.2006.320181","http://www.cse.ohio-state.edu/~caohu/research/alwaysOff.pdf"],"title":"O-MAC: A Receiver Centric Power Management Protocol","doi":"10.1109/ICNP.2006.320181","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNP.2006.320181","venue":"Proceedings of the 2006 IEEE International Conference on Network Protocols"}

Two of our 3 patients with acquired hemophilia B, which is rarer than acquired hemophilia A, improved most likely due to corticosteroid administration in at least one case and without any intervention in the others. We have shown antibodies against factor VIII in more than 20% of patients with X-linked hemophilia A and extremely rarely in normal people in low titers [3]; however, very severe bleeding due to the presence of AHG antibodies was not frequent. On this occasion I would rather use the term ‘hereditary’ instead of ‘congenital’ hemophilia, which was used by Bilgin et al., since inheritance is not involved in most congenital disorders, such as congenital tuberculosis, syphilis, CMV, rubella infection, etc. May I also indicate that methyl prednisolone at 1 mg/kg/day may not be effective as an immunosuppressive, but 30 mg/kg/day seems to be more effective?

Castelao) in southern Portugal. Water was supplied as: full irrigation (FI), to minimum water deficit corresponding to 100 % of crop evapotranspiration (Etc), partial rootzone drying (PRD) and deficit irrigation (DI), both corresponding to an irrigation amount of 50 % Etc, and a rainfed, i.e. no irrigation treatment (NI). In PRD, water was supplied to one side of the root system during each irrigation period, alternating sides every 15 d approximately. During the growing period, PRD and DI vines showed intermediate pre-dawn leaf water potential (Ψ pd ) values (around -0.4 MPa) by the end of the growing season, FI vines -0.2 MPa and NI -0.8 MPa. Berry weight as well as the content of glucose and fructose per berry increased in irrigated vines (PRD, DI, and FI) compared to NI vines. Although both malic and tartaric acid declined in non-irrigated vines, there was no significant difference between treatments at harvest. The activities of invertase, malate dehydrogenase and malic enzyme were not affected by irrigation throughout the ripening process. The contribution of other factors involved in the reduction of sugars and organic acids in berries of non-irrigated vines are discussed. These results show that deficit irrigation, like PRD and DI, do not have any negative impact on growth and quality of grape berries compared to fully irrigated vines, but may result in improved berry quality compared to rainfed vines.","inCitations":["9bb9f71f4a95e32a1b5a7242d8dc32e6efc5f62c","b3fa71fea318b803549900c3f75eb67abf5150c6","d3d8b422580e4e4082e5998ac28a8ebf6d2c6ad4","46ccd59461cda0869e40aae8dc3c3f8e90f67a2b","9a113165f22e51fb985ca4bbd8254e5e0c97b526","01add299ca9c3a4aec34302859de52ce59f27772","600d6b84fb809e1f83709104cdcfa80e86d15efe","9f8c803f4ebacf97821fba828c049bba5cd3c43a","1f8653f9fda6baf26de7f838a6e95f5c2903380d","712feb0b54df34c6263dbb3e8bc07056c9cd2808","af3c3e0285abf38d78d9251a29b57272d7470589","c5a07672b0410c5a543a9abaa1fc3b6a92a50de8","4b9c8651373156b9bb71f67125253534c0407765","8e9860dee7946462b006af18e10865ce2d62778f","2e326a6d2e7f385f38f3a2ce5e67fbff23973dcf","d2f12fa4defbdafb06d6d29476dd79f786ce550c","76ece3fee02ddbfef911553640298f8b9e73e293","d62d414a7e64f893e34758a1cfc7b52a4e6c66e6","d90fc7014f4a47c6e688faa164a43df8b69149f5","0fb63688aab8ec4f3da6d6a472a4f7203cfde092"],"pdfUrls":["https://ojs.openagrar.de/index.php/VITIS/article/download/4318/4269"],"title":"Grape berry metabolism in field-grown grapevines exposed to different irrigation strategies","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

The main purpose of this study is to propose a transferable criterion for evaluation of ductile cracking in welded structures under large scale cyclic loading from small scale tensile test results. On the basis of the observation of ductile crack initiation behavior of round-bar specimen with/without circumferential notches tested in single tension, the main controlling factor for ductile cracking in two-phase steel used was found to be a nucleation of micro-voids in soft phase (Ferrite phase) near Ferrite-Pearlite interface after a large extent of plastic straining. The material damage concept under reverse loading which correlates the material damage for micro-voids nucleation to macro-scale mechanical parameters was proposed by taking into account two aspects of Bauschinger effect : (a)mechanical aspect which influences deformation and stress/strain behaviors, (b) material damage aspect caused by dislocation behavior. A new criterion for ductile cracking of structural members under cyclic loading was proposed on the basis of that proposed effective damage concept and “two-parameter criterion” which can be applied to the steel structures under increasing load in single direction. The validity of the advanced two-parameter criterion was verified by conducting cyclic loading tests in axial direction for round-bar specimen and cyclic 3-point bending tests for cross-shaped specimens. Consequently, the advanced two-parameter ductile cracking criterion was found to be a transferable criterion for the evaluation of critical loading cycle of structural members from small scale tensile test results.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"繰返し荷重下での構造用鋼の延性き裂発生クライテリオン : 大変形繰返し荷重下での溶接鋼構造部材の延性き裂発生限界評価(第1報)","doi":"10.2207/qjjws.21.592","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.2207/qjjws.21.592","venue":""}

This paper proposes a framework to evaluate the closed loop IEEE 802.15.4e based WNCS performance. The framework consists of two models: closed loop control system model and network model. The network model focuses on the PHY parameters of wireless link and takes the channel parameters into consideration. The PHY model combining with MAC model gives the control system model the probability of packet loss in a super-frame. In addition, redundancy mechanism is considered in IEEE 802.15.4e to reduce to data frame loss probability. The simulation is implemented in Matlab, PHY model takes the channel parameters from empirical results. Hence our evaluation gives insight into behavior of WNCS in different environments and it provides us a tool to design wireless network to achieve a good performance for control system.","inCitations":["229b8fa7959dd5f2c163081c0e4c266938a48cc4"],"pdfUrls":["http://ocean.kisti.re.kr/downfile/volume/kics/GCSHCI/2013/v38Bn7/GCSHCI_2013_v38Bn7_572.pdf"],"title":"Performance Evaluation of Wireless Networked Control System Based on IEEE 802.15.4e With Redundancy","doi":"10.7840/kics.2013.38B.7.572","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.7840/kics.2013.38B.7.572","venue":""}

The fractional integral action utilised in the proposed FIRC is a simple, robust, and well-performing technique for vibration control in smart structures with collocated sensor-actuator pairs such as nanopositioning stages. The proposed control scheme is robust in the sense of being insensitive to spillover dynamics and maintaining closed-loop stability even in the presence of model inaccuracies or time-delays in the system. The experimental and simulated results have showed that the proposed FIRC can provide a closed-loop bandwidth which spans up to a 95.2% of the first resonant mode of the experimental system, thus improving the bandwidth achieved by classical integer-order IRC implementations.","inCitations":["99b77f373e46e56f270d5afc8a237b6b8c0f8c24","fc796308474d5328fd33d85d2150fc31c540cad3"],"pdfUrls":["http://aura.abdn.ac.uk/bitstream/handle/2164/9888/Application_of_a_Fractional_Order_Integral_Resonant_Control_to_increase_the_achievable_bandwidth_of_a_nanopositioner..pdf;jsessionid=89BDEBFC673598A722A717B3512BB177?sequence=1"],"title":"Application of a Fractional Order Integral Resonant Control to increase the achievable bandwidth of a nanopositioner.","doi":"10.1016/j.ifacol.2017.08.2079","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ifacol.2017.08.2079","venue":""}

The progress of energy transition by considering geopolitical risk has not been considered seriously yet. This paper contributes to the literature by modeling and analyzing energy transition patterns in Russia with emphasis on geopolitical risks factor as a giant fossil fuels producer using the ARDL bounds testing method over the period of 1993–2018. The main results proved long-run negative impact of economic growth, population growth and inflation rate on energy transition of Russia, while CO2 emissions, geopolitical risk, exchange rate and financial openness have positive impacts on energy transition movement in the country. Furthermore, we found out that in the short-run, the relationship between energy transition improvement and economic growth, CO2 emissions, population growth and inflation rate is negative, while geopolitical risk, exchange rate and financial openness are the only variables which accelerate energy transition in the country. As major concluding remarks, Russia’s policy makers should draw attention to the long-run energy plans in the country. Furthermore, lowering dependency of Federals’ budget to the oil and gas revenues would be a useful policy to reduce negative impact of economic growth on energy transition movement in the country. Another recommendation is to determine rapid decarbonizing policies in the country.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Geopolitical Risk and Energy Transition in Russia: Evidence from ARDL Bounds Testing Method","doi":"10.3390/su12072689","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.3390/su12072689","venue":""}

Large unconstrained natural trunk-assisted reaching movements were recorded in 7 healthy subjects. The 3-D positions of anatomical landmarks were measured and then compared to their estimation given by the biomechanical chain fed with joint angles (the direct kinematics). Thus, the prediction errors was attributed to the different joints and to the different simplifications introduced in the model. Large (approx. 4 cm) end-point prediction errors at the level of the hand were reduced (to approx. 2 cm) if translations of the scapula were taken into account. As a whole, the 6-D mocap seems to give accurate results, except for prono-supination. The direct kinematic model could be used as a virtual mannequin for other applications, such as computer animation or clinical and ergonomical evaluations.","inCitations":["16875911a5f3a3a84a3052cd6c97bb8eea0999bc","8156cf680275ddd73e8f0abdc4f2565244733f74","5971afca42003084fa23b7c7432f55444b6c48c5","2624be31a2848005d7ac0cec35132b081a3ddb2a","6d16c08b1df72507006a0be745cb2f91e38c203f"],"pdfUrls":["https://www.humankinetics.com/AcuCustom/Sitename/Documents/DocumentItem/13-Hanneton-JAB-272-277%20author.pdf"],"title":"Direct kinematic modeling of the upper limb during trunk-assisted reaching.","doi":"10.1123/jab.27.3.272","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1123/jab.27.3.272","venue":"Journal of applied biomechanics"}

The segmentation of MS lesions in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a very important task to assess how a patient is responding to treatment and how the disease is progressing. Computational approaches have been proposed over the years to segment MS lesions and reduce the amount of time spent on manual delineation and inter- and intra-rater variability and bias. However, fully-automatic segmentation of MS lesions still remains an open problem. In this work, we propose an iterative approach using Student's t mixture models and probabilistic anatomical atlases to automatically segment MS lesions in Fluid Attenuated Inversion Recovery (FLAIR) images. Our technique resembles a refinement approach by iteratively segmenting brain tissues into smaller classes until MS lesions are grouped as the most hyperintense one. To validate our technique we used 21 clinical images from the 2015 Longitudinal Multiple Sclerosis Lesion Segmentation Challenge dataset. Evaluation using Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC), True Positive Ratio (TPR), False Positive Ratio (FPR), Volume Difference (VD) and Pearson's r coefficient shows that our technique has a good spatial and volumetric agreement with raters' manual delineations. Also, a comparison between our proposal and the state-of-the-art shows that our technique is comparable and, in some cases, better than some approaches, thus being a viable alternative for automatic MS lesion segmentation in MRI.","inCitations":["ecbfb597c22f43a8a7d70e800356360ffc3ab94f","2b96b2dfebdb2ece9b35fb1b9e42a50ec5ecfd38","46f470867c7113cbc49112cfab4eeaf7ff8d312c","05a37c1591cb1ba6f5f287cc90f584b54752f00f"],"pdfUrls":["https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q52141448"],"title":"Automatic iterative segmentation of multiple sclerosis lesions using Student's t mixture models and probabilistic anatomical atlases in FLAIR images","doi":"10.1016/j.compbiomed.2016.03.025","sources":["Medline","DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compbiomed.2016.03.025","venue":"Comp. in Bio. and Med."}

Although diesel engines have dramatically changed over the years, the basic qualities that initially made these engines desirable remain the same: fuel economy, performance, reliability, and durability. Performance, reliability, and durability have seen big advances, but perhaps one of the largest changes in the modern diesel engines is the addition of sociability as a key driver and the introduction of diesel exhaust aftertreatment as a result. Requirements on fuel efficiency and emissions are motivated by global economic and environmental implications of the use of fossil fuels. These technology-forcing-factors are expected to play crucial roles in developing future engines as well. Irrespective of the geographic region, engine manufacturers will have to seek an integrated perspective and significant advancements in the fuel quality and subsystems dealing with air handling, fuel systems, combustion, controls and exhaust aftertreatment are expected. There is an increasing trend to move towards cleaner combustion strategies that can significantly reduce the levels of emissions within the cylinder itself by operating in non-traditional diesel engine operating regimes or by controlling fuel composition. The quest for alternative energy sources for diesel engines is expected to continue for reasons of energy independence, emissions reduction, fuel efficiency and GHG reduction. Use of natural gas and biofuels produced from indigenous options are being actively pursued. Hybridization of diesel is in early stages and is continued to be a key enabler for GHG and emissions reduction, as well as fuel efficiency. High pressure common rail injection with precise control of number of pulses and duration, and flexible control of injection rate shaping are being developed, and it is expected that optimization of nozzle design and ECU control strategies will complement these developments. Challenges lie in ensuring fuel quality and in sensors and control systems development. High efficiency aftertreatment systems that integrate oxidation catalysts, wall-flow DPFs, de-NOx catalysts, HC and DEF injectors as well as sensors and closed loop controls are being pursued. Devices with combined functionalities (such as SCR-F) are particularly interesting. For today’s engines, aftertreatment integration and optimization is as critical and complex as turbocharger mapping and fuel injector tuning. The development of intake charge filtration systems will be motivated by need to improve filtration capacity, efficiency and pressure drop reduction. Use of Organic Rankine cycle and electric turbo-compounding are promising for waste energy recovery. Though turbocharger and EGR technologies have reached relative maturity, their optimum integration will be crucial in view of incorporation of advanced combustion, after-treatment and waste heat recovery technologies.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Future Diesel Engines","doi":"10.1007/978-981-15-0970-4_24","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-981-15-0970-4_24","venue":""}

Cell salvage is relatively contraindicated in surgical sites contaminated with amniotic fluid, bacteria or tumour cells. We report bacterial growth in salvaged blood during transnasal surgery. A well, 40-kg 14-year-old boy underwent transnasal resection of a juvenile psammomatoid ossifying fibroma of the floor of the anterior cranial fossa. We administered preincision antibiotic prophylaxis of ticarcillin with clavulanic acid 3.1 g. Blood loss was approximately 1.2 l, of which 550 ml was salvaged for re-transfusion. At the end of surgery, the patient was haemodynamically stable and his serum haemoglobin had dropped from 13.4 g.dl to 10.1 g.dl. Due to the risk of bacterial contamination, we elected not to re-infuse the cell salvaged blood. A sterile sample of the processed blood was sent for bacterial culture. At 18 h this grew Staphylococcus aureus (sensitive to flucloxacillin), Haemophilus influenzae (sensitive to ampicillin) and Staphylococcus epidermidis (sensitive to penicillin). These bacteria represent likely contaminants from the surgical site. We believe adequate steps had been taken to minimise bacterial contamination. Systemic prophylactic antibiotics have been shown to reduce bacterial contamination of cell salvaged blood in other types of surgery [2, 3]. The salvaged blood was washed by a Haemonetics Cell Saver 5 (Haemonetics Corporation, Braintree MA, USA) with 1.5 l of 0.9% saline per 125 ml bowl. It was then passed through a Pall Purecell RCQ High Efficiency Rapid Flow Leukocyte Reduction Filter (Pall Corporation, Port Washington, NY, USA) to minimise bacterial load. This processing method effectively removes > 97% of bacteria from blood [4]. The presence of bacteria in salvaged blood is undesirable but the consequences if transfused are not clear. Bacterial contamination is common with red cell salvage, even from sterile sites, for example during cardiac, orthopaedic and neurosurgery [2, 5, 6]. There are also reports of safe cell salvage from contaminated sites [7]. This case shows that even if best practice red cell salvage techniques are used, the sterility of the re-infused blood cannot be guaranteed. The risk of sepsis with red cell salvage must be weighed against the risk of allogeneic transfusion.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Gift of the glob goes global.","doi":"10.1111/j.1365-2044.2009.06214.x","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2044.2009.06214.x","venue":"Anaesthesia"}

The motion programs include step, sawtooth, and staircase operations. A positioning accuracy of greater than 0.03 deg and a position resolution of greater than 0.001 deg have been achieved. Fixation of grating and mirror mechanism during launch is accomplished using short circuiting of motor windings for providing high braking torques.

The same signals are applied to control the required 12 positions.

In a galaxy cluster, the evolution of spiral galaxies depends on their cluster environment. Ram pressure due to the rapid motion of a spiral galaxy within the hot intracluster medium removes the galaxy’s interstellar medium from the outer disk. Once the gas has left the disk, star formation stops. The passive evolution of the stellar populations should be detectable in optical spectroscopy and multi-wavelength photometry. Aims. The goal of our study is to recover the stripping age of the Virgo spiral galaxy NGC 4388, i.e. the time elapsed since the halt of star formation in the outer galactic disk using a combined analysis of optical spectra and photometry. Methods. We performed VLT FORS2 long-slit spectroscopy of the inner star-forming and outer gas-free disk of NGC 4388. We developed a non-parametric inversion tool that allows us to reconstruct the star formation history of a galaxy from spectroscopy and photometry. The tool was tested on a series of mock data using Monte Carlo simulations. The results from the non-parametric inversion were refined by applying a parametric inversion method. Results. The star formation history of the unperturbed galactic disk is flat. The non-parametric method yields a rapid decline of star formation <200 Myr ago in the outer disk. The parametric method is not able to distinguish between an instantaneous and a longlasting star formation truncation. We find that 190 ± 30 Myr ago the star formation reached half of its pre-stripping value. Conclusions. We are able to give a precise stripping age that is consistent with revised dynamical models.","inCitations":["4a2303ccfa7b57e78fe14102c4a4ab32cdf634fa","0ca1ed816d96f70d28926e4c7ee2585cf7600c6b"],"pdfUrls":["https://arxiv.org/pdf/1002.3524v1.pdf"],"title":"Pinning down the ram-pressure-induced halt of star formation in the Virgo cluster spiral galaxy NGC 4388: A joint inversion of spectroscopic and photometric data","doi":"10.1051/0004-6361/200913612","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1051/0004-6361%2F200913612","venue":""}

The rate of lipid peroxidation in the liver was determined in vitro by the thiobarbituric acid (TBA) test, and by conjugated diene measurement. Palm oil supplementation significantly reduced (p<0.05) the rate of lipid peroxidation in the liver of rats fed 5% cholesterol, compared to the rate observed in the liver of rats fed 5% cholesterol diet without palm oil. On the other hand glutathione peroxidase activity was significantly increased (p<0.05) in the liver of rats fed palm oil supplemented diet compared with those fed cholesterol diet without palm oil. The study suggests that palm oil feeding could be a veritable nutritional tool in the prevention of lipid-induced oxidative damage as usually observed in atheromatous plaque.","inCitations":["028cfad69be4ebf56de4696aedd67ee1abbf8632","cf2c3ae1ba92c6f807a1130d47059bdfafd62bde","f5c04351ab1bed55d04e8eeca814c2afc60f4a9b"],"pdfUrls":["https://print.ispub.com/api/0/ispub-article/12786"],"title":"Effects of Palm Oil Supplementation on Lipid Peroxidation and Glutathione Peroxidase Activity in Cholesterol – Fed Rats","doi":"10.5580/2620","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.5580/2620","venue":""}

A survey was conducted among pickers, sellers and consumers in five cities (Abidjan, Yamoussoukro, Toumodi, Katiola and Bondoukou). The results show that (92.11%) of the women harvesting tea, cut leafy stems at tea tree base, (80.65%) carry their harvests on the head and (60.95%) dry their harvest from 1 to 3 days or 7 days. The harvest period ranging from April to August is the most important one (80.15%). In Abidjan, the use of Lippia multiflora as food is 79.80 % and in other areas of the country, it is used for both food and medicine with the respective frequencies of 46.56 and 46.44 % and its insecticidal use represents only (6,16%). It appears from this survey that the leaves of Lippia multiflora are most used by consumers; the manufacturing of this herbal tea is performed according to traditional process. The savannah tea has nutritional, insecticidal and medicinal values. It would be better to afford the opportunity to transform the leaves of Lippia multiflora in tea in order to have a crop with a high added value.","inCitations":["fdd02717b434e0da259f2031426297115e40f329","84d03b6f3c48830faa0b7db77e68c9f9c0fda622"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.csrs.ch/publications/%5BCSRS_Publication%5D_d969116269e13fe0605b24bafc32f34f.pdf"],"title":"Manufacturing Process and Various uses of Savannah Herbal Tea (Lippia multiflora) in Côte d’Ivoire","doi":"10.22004/ag.econ.198237","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.22004/ag.econ.198237","venue":""}

Gastroesophageal reflux-induced chronic cough (GERC) can be divided into two subgroups based on the pH of the GER. Nonacid GERC is less common than acid GERC, and its diagnosis and treatment strategy have not been standardized. However, nonacid GERC usually presents with its unique set of characteristics and features upon diagnosis and treatment in the clinic. Although the underlying molecular mechanism of nonacid GERC is not fully understood, it is considered to be associated with reflux theory, reflex theory and airway hypersensitivity. Multi-channel intraluminal impedance combined with pH monitoring is a promising new technique that can detect both acid and nonacid reflux, and our findings as well as those of others have shown its usefulness in diagnosing nonacid GERC. Development of new diagnostic techniques has led to an increased rate of nonacid GERC diagnosis. We summarize our experience in the diagnosis and treatment of nonacid GERC and provide a guide for future therapeutic approaches.","inCitations":["f413262f9c1f2a8e9433a6364a05905abe7cfacb","b9a9727a009c3277913cc423aea56bcb31de7349","273a268077623e9c9f682989f97aafbe330091a7","b0f2e5e3744e7c45a1504a165ed14deb7f492321"],"pdfUrls":["http://jrms.mui.ac.ir/files/journals/1/articles/10316/public/10316-39197-1-PB.pdf"],"title":"Diagnosis and treatment of patients with nonacid gastroesophageal reflux-induced chronic cough","doi":"10.4103/1735-1995.170625","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.4103/1735-1995.170625","venue":"Journal of research in medical sciences : the official journal of Isfahan University of Medical Sciences"}

Furthermore, we present a new wave function for the double continuum, which takes into account the non-diagonal part of the kinetic energy. It satisfies the correct boundary conditions for large particle separations, and treats the electronic interaction in a more realistic way than the previously enunciated models.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Double photoionization of helium: A new correlated double continuum wave function","doi":"10.1016/S0168-583X(97)00427-8","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/S0168-583X%2897%2900427-8","venue":""}

The microvilli of the vomeronasal sensory epithelium were positive for DBA, SBA, Isolectin B4, WGA, PNA, and UEA-I. The receptor cells showed intense reactivity for DBA and WGA. Lectins were not detected in the supporting cells or basal cells. The Jacobson's glands were positive for WGA and UEA-I, but lectins were absent from the nerve bundles. From these results, we postulate that several lectin-binding carbohydrates on the microvilli and neurosensory cells are associated with chemoreception in the horse. In addition, the differential lectin-binding patterns in the horse suggest that the carbohydrates present in this particular sense organ are species-specific.","inCitations":["d81797fd30cfa2c06f6cd262dfc3d25e22dd6ac0","8559cdb660c7d96850fb4cab08504b8cf19ba98c","543e782053d501e3cd76236d7dc30824fef839a6","fdb27ad619aa9d5f3ff54fb48d5eb002982c3504"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Histochemical characterization of the lectin-binding sites in the equine vomeronasal organ.","doi":"10.4142/jvs.2003.4.1.15","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.4142/jvs.2003.4.1.15","venue":"Journal of veterinary science"}

The scalable plasma spray method enables the direct deposition of large area nanostructured films of V{sub 2}O{sub 5} with controllable particle size and morphology. In this approach, the solution precursors (vanadium oxychloride and ammonium metavanadate) were injected externally into the plasma jet, which atomizes and pyrolyzes the precursors in-flight, resulting in the desired films on the current collectors. The microstructure analysis of the as synthesized films revealed pure nanocrystalline phase for V{sub 2}O{sub 5} with particles in the size range of 20-50 nm. The V{sub 2}O{sub 5} film based electrodes showed stable reversible discharge capacity in the range of 200-250 mAh g{sup -1} when cycled in the voltage window 2-4 V. We further discuss the mechanism for controlling the particle growth and morphology, and also the optimization of reversible lithium storage capacity. The nanorods of V{sub 2}O{sub 5} formed after the anneal treatment also show reversible storage capacity indicative of the potential use of such film based electrodes for energy storage.","inCitations":["abd6fae068c6d823ec2ecd5c34da23d071f87489","62d4cb9a4bd721f54263b32d2698e405fa521e9e","ba387aba228ee0086a3c27c4a094c9eeaf23bb6b","0c12641057a146d14e3a6e68225738697389045c"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Direct synthesis of nanostructured V2O5 films using solution plasma spray approach for lithium battery applications","doi":"10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.09.016","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.09.016","venue":""}
