We researched several different types of rural settlements and three time horizons with the help of old maps, orthophoto maps and GIS tools. To capture the influence of their location within the urban system, we chose 15 places from four categories (inner suburban area, outside suburban area, rural area, periphery rural area) depending on their distance to the core of the Pilsen agglomeration. There is no significant change in the amount of water bodies between the first reference period (1838–1839) and the second period (1957–1963) in the selected settlements. However, the third period (2013–2015) is characterized by the emergence of a large number of small water bodies – swimming pools and garden ponds. Based on the results of our research we identified the declining importance of public water bodies in some of the settlements. However, we have identified a notable prevalence of garden ponds which have a more positive ecological impact than pools. The proportion of private water bodies (covered and uncovered pools and garden ponds) in the total area of water bodies in the rural settlements in most cases is less than 20%, in the suburban settlements up to 100%. Peripheral settlements have a below-average share of these water bodies. The difference between the number of pools in different settlements is related to the proportion of newly built houses there. Although there are relatively fewer pools in rural settlements, the difference compared to the situation in suburban settlements is not pronounced due to the change in lifestyle in rural areas and the change in functions of some villages to recreational areas. Influence of pools on water consumption is dependent on the individual exchange technology of water in swimming pools. Filling of the pool before the season can overload the capacity of the local water supply.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://geography.upol.cz/soubory/lide/frajer/citace/jsc/2017_European_Countryside.pdf","https://www.degruyter.com/downloadpdf/j/euco.2017.9.issue-1/euco-2017-0009/euco-2017-0009.pdf"],"title":"European Countryside MENDELU NEW TYPES OF PONDS ?

The relatively limited role that this technology has played in the hospitality industry is outlined and changes in the skills and attitudes of managers are suggested. It is thought that the changes may be accompanied by greater centralisation of decision-taking and emphasis on planning roles. It concludes that decision-making is essentially a social and therefore a human process but that managers in this industry need to take a more active role in personal development in order to exploit the technology to the full. In this way, some of the current difficulties of the hospitality industry might be overcome with a lesser threat to employment.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Some implications of computers for hospitality managers","doi":"10.1016/0278-4319(82)90017-2","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/0278-4319%2882%2990017-2","venue":""}

Many students miss relevant placement for agricultural courses and employment opportunities due to wrong subject combinations in secondary school. This study investigated the influence of school-related factors such as; performance of agriculture subject in the previous KSCE results, availability of teaching and learning resources and the category of the school on the students’ choice of agriculture subject in secondary schools in Nakuru County, Kenya. The study used the ex-post facto research design, as the researcher only reported on the influences of school-related factors on the choice of agriculture subject among secondary students. Stratified sampling was used to ensure that all the school categories; National, County and Sub County schools were initially included in the study. A sample of 18 schools was employed using purposive and simple random sampling technique. The sample size of 367 students was derived using a table of random numbers to determine a finite population out of an accessible population of 7955. Proportionate sampling techniques were used to determine the number of students drawn from each school category. The questionnaires had both closed and open ended items and comprised likert scale rating items, where the respondents would tick their points of concurrence. The questionnaires were completed by 367 Form three students in the public secondary school of Nakuru County. Data was analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS). Pearson Moments Correlations (r) test was used to examine and analyze relationships among study factors. Hypotheses were tested at 0.05 alpha levels. The study revealed that agriculture learning facilities influence students’ choice of agriculture subject. The study recommended that the subject should have relevant resources and facilities to reflect its practical nature and promote subject choice. The findings of the study may be useful to curriculum developers and policy planners in developing policies and strategies that will increase and sustain secondary school students’ interest and participation in agriculture subject in Nakuru County and the entire country, Kenya. International Journal of Scientific Research and Innovative Technology ISSN: 2313-3759 Vol. 4 No. 6; June 2017 64 INTRODUCTION Education systems worldwide are characterized by several optional subjects that students have to choose from for their future careers. There is a need for every student choosing a subject leading to a career to understand the implications and consequences of making such choices. In USA for example, the students choosing vocationally oriented subjects tend to do it, having been fully exposed to the implications of their choices and having acquired a substantially better understanding of general educational skills in their future occupations (Mustapha & Greenan, 2007). A choice in agriculture as a learning subject at a high school level in the USA is motivated by three main categories of learning experiences: classroom instruction, Supervised Agricultural Experience (SAE), and learning by doing through youth agricultural activities such as the Young Farmers Association (YFC) and the Future Farmers of America Organization (FFA) as argued by (Phipps, Osborne, Dyer, Ball, Lloyd, Edward., 2008 & Konyango, 2010) has led to increased number of students pursuing the course. In Malaysia, vocational agricultural education has produced educated, skilled and motivated workforce in the agricultural industry. This finding is based on the view that technical and vocational education is considered as an important measure for development of workforce (Syeda, 2011). In Bangladesh, technical subjects, agriculture included, are highly recognized due to their contribution to national development in areas of man-power creation and running of industries (Gazi, 2008).The vocational education in other parts of the world, for example, in Europe is characterized by students taking vocational courses with a substantially better understanding of general educational skills (Mustapha & Greenan, 2007).","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Influence of Teaching and Learning Resources On Students’ Choice of Agriculture Subject in Secondary Schools in Nakuru County, Kenya","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

While it is well documented that macroinvertebrate communities in streams change along urbanized gradients, less work has addressed how changes in macroinvertebrate communities might affect the diet composition of the trout that feed on these macroinvertebrates. The objective of this study was to examine how brown trout diet varied along an urbanized section of Rapid Creek. Rapid Creek experiences relatively little disturbance from urban activities in upstream sites, but as it travels through Rapid City, it is subject to a variety of impacts (i.e. pollutants) that may negatively impact water quality and fishery habitat. Adult brown trout were collected in three 100m sites along Rapid Creek: one site was upstream of Rapid City, one site was in the middle of Rapid City, and one site was downstream of Rapid City. In October 2000, 60 fish from each site were captured using electrofishing techniques; their stomachs were pumped and stomach contents were preserved in 70% ethanol. Preliminary analysis of approximately 20 fish from each site indicate that the major insect orders consumed in all three sites included Diptera (midges and flies), Coleoptera (beetles), Trichoptera (caddisflies), and Ephemeroptera (mayflies). Consistent with our hypothesis, brown trout diet differed between upstream and downstream sites. For instance, chironomids (small midges) are characteristic of streams with low water quality. Chironomids were a relatively small component of diet in brown trout above Rapid Creek but comprised a major portion of the diet in sites in the middle and downstream portions of Rapid Creek. The results of this study suggest that trout diet can reflect predicted changes in macroinvertebrate communities along an urbanized gradient. Further, these data will provide information that will be helpful in analyzing the current poor condition of brown trout in Rapid Creek.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Brown Trout Diet Variation along an Urbanized Gradient","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

The success in studying the structure and functions of genomes predetermined the development of a new area of modern biological science that was named pro teomics. The term “proteomics” was introduced into the scientific lexicon in 1995 for the first time by the Australian scientist J. Hemperly Smith, and, since then, the technologies of identification, function pre diction, and obtaining of three dimensional structures of proteins and peptides have constantly been con stantly developing and improving. The use of the analytical methods of high resolu tion in the analysis of protein structure at various stages of its biosynthesis and metabolism allowed new treatment of the problem of structural and functional investigations, and the balance between the rational design and combinatorial approaches enabled progress to a new stage in de novo creation of proteins with predetermined properties. At the modern stage, the physicochemical biology has come close to the solution of the practical and fundamental problems connected with personalized medicine with the use of interactomic and metabolomic data. The vocabulary of the new terms appearing in recent years fits well in the basic notions of biochemis try, bioorganic chemistry, and molecular biology. Thereby, a special issue of the journal “Bioorganic Chemistry” (v. 37, no. 1 and partially no. 2) offered to the reader should demonstrate the organic link between the classical approaches of these sciences and the new system analysis. The journal is opened by the review of a team of authors from the Bioorganic Chemistry Research Center of Russian Academy of Medical Sciences (A.S. Ivanov et al.), which is dedicated to modern approaches to the search of new functional protein– protein interactions in steady or dynamic complexes. This area, developing from the middle of the 1970s in the frames of classical biology, has been given renewed momentum recently due to the adoption of new bio sensory technologies and the capabilities of bioinfor matics. The area has been recently named interactom ics, and its possibilities are difficult to overestimate. Suffice it to say that the reliable revelation of specific interaction between the proteins of one organism will make it possible to sufficiently narrow the search for the functional contacts of homologous proteins in quite far taxonomic groups. This area also has a great future in practical medicine, due to the search for new bioregulators and potential drugs that are able to switch off some contacts in functioning protein com plexes. Consequently, it will be possible to pass from experiments performed in vitro to functional investi gations at the level of the organism. This problem is tightly connected with the area of computer proteomics as a part of modern bioinfor matics. The article of composite authors from the Institute of Cytology and Genetics at the Siberian branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences (V.A. Iva nisenko et al.), in which the development of a new informational system program of protein structure discovery enabling the operation of a number of func tional properties of proteins at the level of one dimen sional to three dimensional structures is described, is dedicated to this theme. Predicting abilities of the sys tem with the use of X ray analysis data cover both the immune recognition at the level of linear epitopes and protein interactions. A relatively small group of works in the present issue is directly connected with medical applications of approaches of system biology and proteomics. This theme is opened by the work dedicated to the search for potential biomarkers of demyelinating autoim mune polyneuropathies in blood serum of patients (P.Kh. Ziganshin et al.). By the means of proteomic technologies, the authors managed to build the classi fication model differing chronic inflammatory demy elinating autoimmune polyneuropathy and a quite rare neurological disease—Guillain–Barré syn drome—with high reliability.

In this paper, we consider a similar problem with topological knowledge but in a distributed broadcast channel setting, i.e., a network where transmitter cooperation is enabled. We show that the topological information can also be exploited in this case to strictly improve the degrees of freedom (DoF) as long as the network is not fully connected, which is a reasonable assumption in practice. Achievability schemes from graph theoretic and interference alignment perspectives are proposed. Together with outer bounds built upon generator sequence, the concept of compound channel settings, and the relation to index coding, we characterize the symmetric DoF for the so-called regular networks with constant number of interfering links, and identify the sufficient and/or necessary conditions for the arbitrary network topologies to achieve a certain amount of symmetric DoF.","inCitations":["022f4c3d1a6f94d375dcbbcebddc5ce4c5d63d7a","83bd9c68f5cbe61e0d6a873cdcc397f134ce9ca1","bf386ccdb31126448672cf6c2a89f04b290963ca","4abe7342db204cf46e61df7c23834585b0026bfc","ca21df598c9715eb50c56cf12c5da7e605f92b85","5cf4cba59291cd0b81774f24b65e1e831576a63a"],"pdfUrls":["https://arxiv.org/pdf/1412.0823v1.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2014.6874952","http://www.eurecom.fr/en/publication/4665/download/cm-publi-4665.pdf","https://livrepository.liverpool.ac.uk/3016374/1/IT-14-0269.pdf","http://www.eurecom.fr/en/publication/4353/download/cm-publi-4353.pdf","https://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1412.0823","http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.0823"],"title":"Topological Interference Management With Transmitter Cooperation","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2014.6874952","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2014.6874952","venue":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory"}

The melange separates poorly dated sedimentary rocks of the Rai Sandstone in the west from undifferentiated Pelorus Group in the east. A small number of gastropods previously used to assign an Early Permian age to the Croisilles rocks date the sediments in a single block and not the age of the melange or its emplacement. The gastropods show affinities with Mourlonia (Mourlonia) strzeleckiana (Morris) of Late Permian age. Radiometric dating (U-Pb, K-Ar) shows that the ophiolitic blocks in the melange are of Early Permian age. Thus the melange is derived from an ophiolite of similar age to the nearby Dun Mountain Ophiolite Belt and from an Upper. Permian sedimentary sequence.

Good agreement is obtained with laboratory experiments for temperature statistics in a thermal mixing layer. For conserved scalar statistics in a reacting mixing layer, good agreement is obtained with direct numerical simulations, but enhanced mixing is necessary in order to account approximately for the effects of a flow instability in the experiments. With this enhanced mixing, good agreement is obtained with laboratory data for reactive scalars on the edges of the mixing layer using conditional moment closure, but discrepancies remain in the middle of the layer. Calculations show that in conditional moment closure modelling, the scalar dissipation conditioned on the scalar concentration can be replaced by its unconditional counterpart with negligible error.","inCitations":["436f747e99a186afea7a86c773b4658b74377287","f1cc66333f0ead898b605474c41f784f289a8be5","dedbc0d97a8167eb45dd53e17b291425eea44b7e","ada83a380ed4f629e4b1ae7a6177a8f80d80ef93","7cf2f00b0441d1b0424822b86314af4776c255b2","39cf76957202caf83650f5b9a1073c7f25494b5a","21271254309cb09c61204ec7d08d4c52acfa7491","96d9eff80596abd9a18e3b7608f48be6e8116f77","8c85ad21e956fabb1a2510202bf603e154cfc892","d7ab3b822710b32afe75d65ee9b6752d59a04f3b","141f686f1e07949e41344fcd0a3a65546d045935"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Lagrangian Stochastic Modelling of Chemical Reaction in a Scalar Mixing Layer","doi":"10.1007/s10546-005-4737-0","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10546-005-4737-0","venue":""}

Given filtering-censorship by states and concerns over national cyber-security, it is often assumed that the Internet will inevitably be subordinated to the traditional system of nation-states. In Networks and States, Milton Mueller counters this, showing how Internet governance poses novel and fascinating governance issues that give rise to a global politics and new transnational institutions. Drawing on theories of networked governance, Mueller provides a broad overview of Internet governance from the formation of ICANN to the clash at the World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS), the formation of the Internet Governance Forum, the global assault on peer-to-peer file sharing and the rise of national-level Internet control and security concerns. Mueller identifies four areas of conflict and coordination that are generating a global politics of Internet governance: intellectual property, cyber-security, content regulation, and the control of critical Internet resources (domain names and IP addresses). He investigates how recent theories about networked governance and peer production can be applied to the Internet, offers case studies that illustrate the Internet's unique governance problems, and charts the historical evolution of global Internet governance institutions, including the formation of a transnational policy network around the WSIS. Internet governance has become a source of conflict in international relations. Networks and States explores the important role that emerging transnational institutions could play in fostering global governance of communication-information policy.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Drivers of Internet Governance","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Background Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and corticobasal degeneration have genetic and pathologic similarities, but different phenotypes. Occasionally, the clinical diagnosis between PSP and corticobasal syndrome (CBS) is blurred, and patients are felt to have an overlap syndrome. In such cases, less is known about the spectrum of behavioral and cognitive features that can be seen, especially those preceeding the movement symptoms. Design/Methods: We review the clinical evolution, brain MRI and brain PET scans and videotaped examination findings in this case. Results: This patient is a 76-year-old woman who developed severe and constant anxiety and obsessive-compulsive features including strict rule-bound activities for herself and family, self-harm threats if separated from her spouse, mental rigidity, and bizarre and time-consuming rituals. This was followed by impaired problem solving and perspective-taking, childlike behavior, and pathological laughing and crying. One and a half years later, she developed repeated falls, slow and soft speech, largely symmetric bradykinesia, and axial symptoms of neck rigidity and worsened postural instability, but only slightly slowed downward saccades. Subsequently, right-sided predominant rigidity, myoclonus, and mild apraxia developed. Brain MRI at 3 months and brain PET at 1 year after motor onset, revealed left-sided predominant parietal, medial prefrontal, and anterior temporal mild atrophy and hypometabolism, respectively. Anxiety and obsessive-compulsive features were somewhat responsive to sertraline and behavioral strategies were also employed. Conclusions: Severe anxiety with frontal cognitive symptoms may preceed a PSP-CBS overlap disorder but often go unrecognized, yet may respond to pharmacotherapy and family education. This symptom cluster requires additional study to determine its abillty early on to predict PSP-CBS syndromes. Disclosure: Dr. Smyth has nothing to disclose.

A task force for the EULAR standing committee for clinical trials met in 1998 to determine the methodological and logistical approach required for the development of evidence-based guidelines for treatment of knee OA. The guidelines were restricted to cover all currently available therapies for knee OA diagnosed either clinically and/or radiographically affecting any compartment of the knee. Methods: The first stage was the selection of treatment modalities to be considered. The second stage comprised a search of the electronic databases Medline and Embase using a combination of subject headings and key words. All European language publications in the form of systematic reviews, meta-analyses, randomized-controlled trials, controlled trials and observational studies were included. During stage three all of the relevant studies were quality scored. The summary statistics for validated outcome measures, when available, were recorded and where practical the numbers needed to treat (NNT) and the effect size (ES) for each therapy was calculated. The fourth stage involved determination of key clinical propositions by expert consensus employing a Delphi approach. The final stage involved ranking of these propositions according to the available evidence. A second set of propositions relating to a future research agenda was determined by expert consensus using a Delphi approach. Results: Over 2400 English language publications and 400 non-English language publications were identified. Seven hundred and forty four studies presented outcome data of the effects of specific treatments on knee OA. Quantitative analysis of treatment effect was possible in only 61 studies. Recommendations for the management of knee OA based on currently available data and expert opinion are presented. Proposals for a future research agenda are highlighted. Conclusions: These are the first clinical guidelines on knee OA to combine an evidence-based approach and a consensus approach across a wide range of treatment modalities. It is apparent that only certain clinical propositions are supported by substantial research-based evidence, while others are not. There is thus an urgent need for future well designed trials to address key clinical questions.

For the instrument of this study, the corrected and/or supplemented data from the questionnaires used in the previous research were used. The questionnaires were distributed and collected by using a mail survey method through assistances from the baseball managers and coaches of the high schools in question. For the statistical analysis, correlation analysis and multiple regression analysis were used by using PASW Version 18.0. The followings were results of the study. First, the high school baseball players’ parental support had a significant influence on the decision-making as to caree. Second, the high school baseball players’ parental support had a significant influence on the career maturity. Third, the types of decision-making as career of the high school baseball players had a significant influence on the career maturity. This should be deemed meaningful in that it provides basic data that are necessary for creating a positive way of thinking when high school baseball players select their career path.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"고등학교 야구선수들의 부모지지와 진로의사결정유형 및 진로성숙도의 관계","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

They are taken in concert with decisions regarding work, marriage, health investments and stocks, as well as many other observable and nonâ€ observable considerations. Drawing causal inferences regarding the effect of additional children on family outcomes is complicated by these endogenous factors. This paper lays out the issues involved in estimating the effect of additional child births on family outcomes, and the assumptions underlying the range of estimators and methodologies proposed in the economic literature. The common pitfalls of these estimators are discussed, as well as their potential to bias our interpretation of the effect additional births have on children and parents, both in the existing literature and in future work in the face of changing patterns of childbearing and childâ€ rearing.","inCitations":["543775344f70ebe5d3c2d7ce57f76b6bc6a1a9e0","c9d88a92585b0abf3a108e61743bc06f2cb4d300","aae768dff3e9b61b1e61799c73a305f670aad893","49a8ebffeea3b0277cea543b6de5b72b71bb680a","a4cfb16d72a218243887557e2816614f4cf1d4b1"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.damianclarke.net/research/papers/Clarke_FertilityCausality.pdf"],"title":"Children and Their Parents: a Review of Fertility and Causality","doi":"10.1111/joes.12202","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1111/joes.12202","venue":""}

For Fe1-xO we update our last survey of defect cluster stabilities, and find the 12:4 cluster remains the favoured large defect aggregate. We also show that inter-defect interactions will favour the formation of defect clusters. Lastly, we use the mass-action method to show how the slightly higher binding energies of clusters in Fe1-xO, may account for the difference in behaviour of the two oxides.","inCitations":["d2e6d97629465d60cc933bf1261df7ed4e269576","d90c2bce49ac4342dceee5e26e0b56cd6d81ee57"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Computer Simulation Studies of Fe1-xO and Mn1-xO","doi":"10.1007/978-94-009-0943-4_5","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-94-009-0943-4_5","venue":""}

The rhizomes of C. longa L. is commonly known as Haldi or Turmeric. Haldi is of special importance to human with the discovery that its rhizome powder, when added to various food preparations, preserves their freshness and imparts a characteristic flavors. The Indian system of medicine comprises of Ayurveda, Siddha and Unani. In these systems many medicine are made up of C. longa rhizomes. In Ayurveda, turmeric has been used internally as a stomachic, tonic, blood purifier and externally in the prevention and treatment of skin diseases. The World Health Organization (WHO) in 1999 had given a detail protocol for quality contol of single herbal drugs. We have developed simple and rapid identification method for authentication of C. longa rhizome. Physicochemical parameters and TLC fingerprint analysis of C. longa rhizomes were also carried out. The study revealed different analytical parameters of the crude drug which will be useful in identification of genuine drug and control of adulterations. INTRODUCTION: Plants have an almost unlimited ability to synthesize diverse scoundary metabolites that have a wide range biological functions that are useful to human Curcuma longa Linn., Turmeric (Curcuma longa) and several other species of the curcuma genus grow wild in the forests of Southern Asia including India, Indonesia, Indochina, nearby Asian countries, and some Pacific Islands including Hawaii. All of these areas have traditional culinary and medicinal uses going back to pre-history 1 . In the Indian Ayurveda system of herbal medicine, turmeric is known as strengthening and warming to the whole body.

In this communication we show that, in part at least, the PSMR changes at autopsy are atheroma-like with lipid around the sclerosis and calcific deposits. These changes in the PSMR showed a statistically significant correlation with the presence of hypertension and with an autopsy finding of severe coronary atherosclerosis. We showed, for the first time, that similar fibrosis and lipid deposition in the PSMR can be produced in high-fat, high-cholesterol fed macaque monkeys (Macaca arctoides) with or without concomitant experimentally produced hypertension. It is concluded that changes in the PSMR in monkeys and man are strongly related to atherosclerosis and hypertension.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Submitral atheromatous lesions in monkey and man.","doi":"10.1002/clc.4960060303","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1002/clc.4960060303","venue":"Clinical cardiology"}

Here we investigate whether there are privileged Ca2+ transport pathways between surface membrane, mitochondria and SR. To address this issue, we used genetically engineered mitochondrial Ca2+ probes based on GCamP3 and GCamP6 along with synthetic fluorescent dye, Fura-2, to image mitochondrial and cytosolic Ca2+ movements simultaneously. Mitochondrial Ca2+ probes were virally introduced in either adult or neonatal cardiomyocytes. Whole-cell patch clamping and high-resolution TIRF microscopy were used to measure membrane current, mitochondrial Ca2+ and sub-sarcolemmal cytosolic Ca2+ simultaneously. In whole cell clamped myocytes dialyzed with 2mM EGTA, Na+ withdrawal- (substituting Na+ by tetra-ethylammonium, TEA) generated an outward NCX-mediated current reflecting Ca2+ entry and caused a rapid increase of mitochondrial Ca2+, without significant rise of cytosolic Cai, because of Ca2+-buffering by 2mM EGTA. When Na+ was readmitted, causing a rapid fall (release) of mitochondrial Ca2+ it triggered a significant transient rise of cytosolic Ca2+ despite the presence of buffering by 2mM EGTA. Interestingly, 5mM caffeine puffs while triggering rapid release of Ca2+ from the SR caused little or no significant rise in the mitochondrial Ca2+ signal. Blockers of MCU or mitochondrial NCX failed to suppress this Na+ withdrawal-induced mitochondrial Ca2+ rise. Our results suggest that Ca2+ buffers may block transfer of Ca2+ from the SR via the cytosol to mitochondria without blocking the privileged Ca2+ communication between sarcolemma and mitochondria.

We probed the ability of fluoro-phenyl-styrene-sulfonamide (FPSS), a small-molecule inhibitor of σ(B) activity in Listeria monocytogenes, to inhibit σ(B) activity in B. subtilis through perturbation of signal transduction cascades under various stress conditions. FPSS inhibited the activation of σ(B) in response to multiple categories of stress known to induce σ(B) activity in B. subtilis. Specifically, FPSS prevented the induction of σ(B) activity in response to energy stress, including entry into stationary phase, phosphate limitation, and azide stress. FPSS also inhibited chill induction of σ(B) activity in a ΔrsbV strain, suggesting that FPSS does not exclusively target the RsbU and RsbP phosphatases or the anti-anti-sigma factor RsbV, all of which contribute to posttranslational regulation of σ(B) activity. Genetic and biochemical experiments, including artificial induction of σ(B), analysis of the phosphorylation state of the anti-anti-sigma factor RsbV, and in vitro transcription assays, indicate that while FPSS does not bind directly to σ(B) to inhibit activity, it appears to prevent the release of B. subtilis σ(B) from its anti-sigma factor RsbW.","inCitations":["43d7a784bacae294cf54cdef89f7d94c804a1699","102965086528b201deabd9ceb8b055951a5d2052","315ac78513be11a3ff58c0f65408ca832f9f217b","982a6c6215defeb7d6ebf612bb083ee5c3e6f0e6","a8ff0c79a41dd0e4c835964e497fe6cc06d854a0"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Fluoro-phenyl-styrene-sulfonamide, a novel inhibitor of σB activity, prevents the activation of σB by environmental and energy stresses in Bacillus subtilis.","doi":"10.1128/JB.00107-13","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1128/JB.00107-13","venue":"Journal of bacteriology"}

Transcript analysis of the Human Achaete Scute Homolog 2 (HASH2) mRNA revealed the presence of two overlapping transcripts in first trimester placentae. The two transcripts (2.6 and 1.5 kb) are generated by two promotors which are separated by 1.1 kb, generating transcripts 1 and 2, respectively. Surprisingly, in transcript 1 which shows a broad expression, a second potential coding region, tentatively called Human Achaete Scute Associated Protein (HASAP) was present. Transcript 2 contains the HASH2 encoding region only. Analysis of protein expression from both transcripts by transfection studies with eGFP fusion proteins, revealed that both coding regions are translated from their endogenous translation initiation site and showed that both proteins are transported to the nucleus. HASH2 is distributed throughout the nucleus but the HASAP protein is transported into nuclear compartments, the nucleoli. In addition, the HASAP protein lacks the bHLH domain and bears no homology to known proteins. Moreover, allele-specific RT-PCR showed the human gene not to be subject to imprinting, possibly reflecting the biallelic expression of one of both transcripts. Our data indicate a species-specific difference between mouse and human expression of the Achaete Scute Homolog 2 and suggests a dual function of the human homologue.","inCitations":["4961e052af93fa9728a6b0b04edd72361298b53b","1a18bc0d1f024ace47fcf7b299f7baf2ba6401cf","fada1950afcf19cec83083813e4cdc21c102e338","c17990d96a260005741fd83f20d93dac9979bc32","db1677c0f69dc922a5bd547e31ca04c51c8a96b8","7d16dda3296b2b3b87740248393d4178fca02e3c","5f860d1d7602af272d673a5ec04e979fc30ab09a","0e03d3e295c65867a20cc037da8dd531cb22ad2c","2e6a6b318e0874818b340311689a3849d1560d71"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"The Human Achaete Scute Homolog 2 gene contains two promotors, generating overlapping transcripts and encoding two proteins with different nuclear localization.","doi":"10.1053/plac.2001.0695","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1053/plac.2001.0695","venue":"Placenta"}

Data from a total number of 240 patients were analyzed. The main group, consisting of 185 patients, was diagnosed according to a saturation prostate needle biopsy protocol (SB), by which more than 12 cores were taken per biopsy. The control group was diagnosed using CB, by which 12 or less than 12 cores were taken per biopsy (n=55). In the main group, the Gleason score of the biopsy was confirmed in 19.5%, in the control group in 23.5% according to the prostatectomy specimen (p=0.50). Upgrading after the operation was found in 56.7% in the main group and in 60% in the control group (p=0.24). Downgrading after the operation was found in 23.9% in the main group and in 16.3% in the control group (p=0.24). If the Gleason score of the postoperative specimens differed by only one point from the biopsy, we considered this a minor deviation. In the main group, 59% of the carcinomas were preoperatively classified correctly or revealed minor deviation in Gleason scores. In contrast, only 47% of the carcinomas in the control group were assessed correctly or with minor deviation in Gleason scores. Thus, the main group demonstrated a better rate of preoperative prediction in tumor grading assessed by Gleason score (p=0.05). In addition, the Gleason scores of both protocols were assigned to three groups (Gleason <7; Gleason 7; Gleason >7), and the group changes from the biopsy to the prostatectomy specimen were found to be significantly more frequent in the CB group (p=0.04). There was no significant difference between the two types of biopsy techniques regarding tumor stage or the detection of insignificant carcinomas. The advantage of the extensive prostate needle biopsy technique (SB) is a better preoperative prediction of the Gleason score as well as the risk groups with Gleason scores <7, equal to 7, or >7. Both techniques fail to detect insignificant prostate cancer.","inCitations":["a596bd135a0da55ed49ed982b94e7b3329d76936","05df7a0716020b47b0129b0220c787964017ac80","2e4c05cda3a3b01c496bee33ae319c3408fb66b0","0d4b8405d73128a172d4d45cf464686c7cc49292","076dfabd34535ed68a1ab86c40b4c0f37a0ccebe","8ef1705b1394b30b9aae08a6f2fc18633baa87b7","4730ff7aece78fc17cf3e4516fe81b9f74aa4f29","8b314db102c1a753c2be1a58f92344c52c052c27","61c8a55ccef62186cc4517e4f6ab75cfc9458806","cd253d31e567ce02657b1d9eb977d01347ff123b","7d664a6498969f25197ebecdd661803a3d92afc6"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Saturation biopsy improves preoperative Gleason scoring of prostate cancer.","doi":"10.1016/j.prp.2008.10.010","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.prp.2008.10.010","venue":"Pathology, research and practice"}

This procedure allows to deposit compositions that otherwise would exhibit low weldability. The strong metallurgical bond of coatings involves the formation of a weld pool. It is therefore expected for the composition of the processed coatings to be influenced both by the deposited and base material, besides processing parameters. This study analyzed the impact of the deposition current on the point defect structure in the B2NiAl-ordered structure and consequently on the coating hardness and indentation modulus. Mixtures of 65 at.%Ni and 35 at.%Al were prepared and deposited on carbon steel and stainless steel plates. Deposition current ranging from 70 to 150 A was used to induce different Fe content in the coatings. Results showed that increasing deposition current increased dilution with substrate but contrary to observations on metallic coatings, an increase of hardness and indentation modulus was measured. The hypothesis that the measured behavior is related to the point defect structure of the ordered phase, B2-NiAl, is put forward. The Fe content determined the density and type of point defects: vacancies, anti-sites Al or Ni. A better understanding on the mechanisms controlling the properties of the aluminide PTA coatings with increasing deposition current is achieved: hardness exhibiting a direct correlation with the point defect structure and the indentation modulus a strong dependence on the microstructure.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"The Influence of Fe Content on the Mechanical Properties of NiAl Coatings Processed In-Situ","doi":"10.1007/s11665-014-1203-5","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11665-014-1203-5","venue":"Journal of Materials Engineering and Performance"}

Acetaminophen was incubated with liver slices prepared from the rat and hamster since these species differ in susceptibility to acetaminophen-induced hepatotoxicity. Formation of acetaminophen metabolites (sulfate, glucuronide, and glutathione conjugate), slice glutathione levels, and slice histopathology were assessed. Acetaminophen (0.5, 1, and 2 mM) induced a dose-dependent depletion of glutathione in hamster slices (sensitive species) but not rat slices (insensitive species). Formation of the acetaminophen toxic metabolite, as measured by glutathione conjugate formation, was much lower in rat slices compared with hamster slices. Rat slices also showed greater activity of the nontoxic sulfation and glucuronidation pathways. These data predicted an 11-fold greater susceptibility to toxicity in the hamster based on the proportion of the dose metabolized to the reactive species. In vivo data, using hepatic glutathione depletion as an indicator of toxic metabolite formation, would predict a similar difference (13.3-fold) between the hamster and the rat. To ascertain if the characteristic centrilobular lesion induced by acetaminophen in vivo could be reproduced in vitro, liver slice histopathology was assessed 6 and 12 hr after a 2-hr treatment with acetaminophen (2 mM). Discrete damage to the centrilobular regions of the liver were noted in hamster but not rat slices. Overall, based on metabolite formation, glutathione depletion, and slice histopathology, the liver slices were excellent predictors of acetaminophen hepatotoxicity in vivo.","inCitations":["fdf6af571b813b55ba7f5f733b87e5b1ed8da56e","a52dd8bf3b35539f9515e6987b0a1ac2780ae045","ffe4448dadba80286bbabe68fb3e6560034264b4","cfb012f54a7a576e3e8230f824ab0120d38cf228","0f0cbfbda08880ffc06956267689d8fd94803ce2","1c3bf82ae893f7cb7dd7aa356ba12775b6ad49e0","78b985bea67617118973dcd9500f09e6f541f271","dba15c073c5c415f315a0dd87f78937a7756f0f9","c90d60fb4af9ffd24a0671826a234932bf72bd9b","782b82557a5f894990038c41ff8f3f3e93de5e10","8e085ed7fc7fe053bcf59e15cd60d6743cb6f41f","e79fc44c2eb845ddebe701c50db98de9b9f440af","6357ff45700439dbb5ddc656666fcd3a13a4b59c","0aae6f015a9aa4382e3eaeab57795ea5347a3a2f","3ee7382345bcaa4ec1a3393fb2ccb2eaa1950605","1b6540456757e4adbc5f83e0be01c847a3d06a8a","d432aa0f1573c0cf024b46da13eb03affe14618d","47a42408eb3d5c6ae3d195a975986384cd1ec394","a0e4c92b1c353bdd91cd62e2b2e6ced69475830b"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Predictive value of liver slices for metabolism and toxicity in vivo: use of acetaminophen as a model hepatotoxicant.","doi":"10.1006/taap.1993.1178","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1006/taap.1993.1178","venue":"Toxicology and applied pharmacology"}

In the absence of resolved surface waves, the LC-generating mechanism is parameterized via the well-known Craik?Leibovich vortex force?(Craik and Leibovich 1976 J Fluid Mech. 73 401?26) appearing in the momentum equation. LES guided by the full-depth LC field measurements of?Gargett and Wells (2007 J Fluid Mech. 576 27?61) shows that this large-scale, downwind-elongated structure changes surface log-layer dynamics in terms of mean downwind velocity and budgets of turbulent kinetic energy (TKE). For example, in terms of mean velocity, the mixing due to LC leads to a deviation from the classical surface log-law profile that is exhibited by wind-driven flow without LC. Furthermore, LC leads to a deviation from the classical balance between production and dissipation rates of TKE in the log-layer. Two key parameters controlling the extent of surface log-layer disruption caused by LC are the dominant wavelength (?) of the surface waves generating LC and the turbulent Langmuir number, Lat, which is inversely proportional to wave forcing relative to wind forcing.","inCitations":["895a02d6c3b45c7ba19ef2d3139c753f9f014712","9a051d067026e7a78304fce1b5c57f38ec4044f3"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Surface dynamics in LES of full-depth Langmuir circulation in shallow water","doi":"10.1088/0031-8949/2013/T155/014008","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1088/0031-8949%2F2013%2FT155%2F014008","venue":""}

Their toxicokinetics have remained unexplored except in the case of perfluorooctanoic acid (8 carbon chemicals). This study aimed to investigate the toxicokinetics of PFCAs with six to fourteen carbon atoms (C6 to C14) in mice and humans.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe applied a two-compartment model to mice administered PFCAs intravenously or by gavage. The time courses of the serum concentration and tissue distribution and elimination were evaluated for 24 hours after treatment. For human samples, urine from healthy volunteers, bile from patients who underwent biliary drainage, and cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) from brain drainage were collected.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe mouse experiment showed that short-chained PFCAs (C6 and C7) were rapidly eliminated in the urine, whereas long-chain PFCAs (C8 to C14) accumulated in the liver and were excreted slowly in feces. Urinary clearance of PFCAs in humans also decreased with increasing alkyl chain lengths, while biliary clearances increased. C9 to C10 had the smallest total clearance for both mice and humans. However, disparities existed in the magnitude of the total clearance between mice and humans. A slightly higher partition ratio (brain/serum) was observed for long-chained PFCAs in mice, but this was not observed in the corresponding partition ratio in humans (CSF/serum).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe large sequestration volumes of PFCAs in the liver seem to be attributable to the liver's large binding capacity in both species. This will be useful in evaluating PFCA bioaccumulation in other species.","inCitations":["61dde59597fb6e922ae7e9fa35dff4d27251d6c2","923737b5a2c81fccf14df050fab4ff3edf5f84d4","89dc9dc759e7ba4c1d30bab14ac10c7c3fc80a42","2e6d6baf6aa216001ba2a20fd5bdac78d8f1b5b6","7b10206aa7d29a8942c263f333257703a789bde7","a7f56cd59eb20355f2f33e6162af56790eb74570","da9ab49d9dc184966e90b5c960d678e87cb4df51"],"pdfUrls":["https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/joh/57/1/57_14-0136-OA/_pdf"],"title":"Toxicokinetics of perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids with different carbon chain lengths in mice and humans.","doi":"10.1539/joh.14-0136-OA","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1539/joh.14-0136-OA","venue":"Journal of occupational health"}

Voltage variations, often in the form of voltage sags and swells, can cause rigorous process disturbances and result in significant economic loss. The custom power devices which uses the power electronic devices, is one of the method by which power quality problems might be compensate. Among the numerous norm power devices, the dynamic voltage restorer (DVR) for use in distribution systems is a recent innovation. The mitigation capability of a DVR depends initially on the maximum voltage injection ability and within the restorer the amount of stored energy existing. In this paper a phase advanced multi-loop control scheme is used to increase the voltage renovation property of the device. Using this novel method it can be shown that the disturbances occurred in the system can be corrected with less amount of storage energy.

It provides a nuanced reading of the novel against conventional Tanpınar scholarship, which predominantly interprets it as a straightforward satire, and inserts it into an overdetermined philosophy of civilization attributed to the author. The article shows that Tanpınar’s poetics in TRI presents a philosophical alternative to the principle of cultural dualities of East and West, and that it reveals the damaging effects of modernization in the first half of the twentieth century, articulated in the novel as resistance to calibrating forms of temporal order. TRI engages with problems of time and memory, experimenting with the plurality of temporal experience, flowing in different speeds and belonging to different systems of reference. This article shifts critical emphasis from traditionalism to his aesthetic explorations, turning from “social” questions of identity, authenticity and cultural theory to representational issues in his writing: novelistic imagery, narrative time, thematic features and stylistic preferences. By foregrounding its modernist elements, it argues that Tanpınar’s novel deemphasizes the idea of continuity with the Ottoman past, in favor of a more critical and modernist approach.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"“Free spirited clocks”: modernism, temporality and The Time Regulation Institute","doi":"10.1080/1475262X.2017.1342446","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1080/1475262X.2017.1342446","venue":""}

The as-prepared superhydrophobic copper plate presents hierarchical and rough morphology composed of nanosheets and nanoparticleformed matrix. Meanwhile, long alkyl chains are assembled onto the rough surface successfully. Consequently, the copper plate is endowed with excellent superhydrophobic performance with a water contact angle of 156.8° and a rolling angle of ca. 3°. Moreover, the superhydrophobicity has long-term durability and excellent stability. Grounded on the strong water repellence, the resultant superhydrophobic copper plate surface exhibits multi-functions. The excellent performance can be well explained by \"Cushion effect\" and Capillary phenomena. As a result, water and corrosive species can be prevented from contacting with the copper plate surface, and contaminants can be taken away easily by the rolling water droplets. Meanwhile, the icing process of water is delayed on the superhydrophobic surface. Therefore, the superhydrophobic copper is endued with enhanced corrosion resistance, excellent self-cleaning and anti-icing performance. We believe that this facile method provides a simple and cost-effective process to improve the properties of copper plate, and which may see practical application of the superhydrophobic materials.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Toward Easily Enlarged Superhydrophobic Copper Surfaces with Enhanced Corrosion Resistance, Excellent Self-Cleaning and Anti-Icing Performance by a Facile Method.","doi":"10.1166/jnn.2020.17891","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1166/jnn.2020.17891","venue":"Journal of nanoscience and nanotechnology"}

In the staged process, two major tasks have been accomplished. One was the successful separation of the three major components, energetics, metallic fuel, and polymer, by cleaving the polyurethane binders of the three-dimensional network; the other was the complete degradation of the high molecular weight polymers into simple phenolic compounds. The preliminary results indicate that the techniques of matrix modification, ultrasonic degradation, and biodegradation are, to various degrees, effective in handling polyurethane-based propellants in an environmentally safe and stable manner. In addition to its unparalleled technical precedence, it is believed that this process will provide an economical solution to a global environmental problem and can be put into actual industrial use.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Staged process for composite propellants.

Thus a trade-off is required, leading to the hybrid formulation, containing better characteristics of strong and weak formulations. Most promising constraints are utilised to reduce computational effort.

It combines with the wheel to make vehicle decelerate and finally stop it. Moreover, brake system is an electronic, mechanical, and hydraulic hybrid system; it contains some highly nonlinear characters, which is a challenge to system control. In this article, an integrated model of brake system and single-wheel system using bond graph method is developed, in which the nonlinear characters of the volumetric compliance effect of brake fluid and the resistance effect of valves are taken into consideration. The accuracy and reliability of the brake system is verified by experiment. Nonlinear sliding-mode controller as well as sliding-mode observer is proposed. The controller is used to modulate inlet and outlet valves control signals according to the vehicle states, which will lead to cancel the usage of wheel cylinder pressure sensors. The controller is analyzed by different tire–road friction coefficient conditions. The results show that the proposed integrated bond graph model is accurate, and the nonlinear sliding-mode control is reliable on valves control signal regulation.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Integrated model control of brake–wheel system using bond graph method","doi":"10.1177/1687814018782857","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1177/1687814018782857","venue":""}

Benzene was preferentially adsorbed from both mixtures on NaX and NaY. Regardless whether octane or octene was present in the binary mixture, benzene was adsorbed more selectively on the high-silica NaY compared to NaX, which contained more cations. The presence of cations on the SIII/SIII' site inside the supercages of NaX causes a more difficult hosting of benzene inside the supercages of NaX and especially on the 12-membered ring site. However, at sufficiently high external benzene concentration (>10 mol %), the 12-membered ring site of NaX will be occupied by benzene, leading to a maximum adsorption capacity of five benzenes per supercage on both NaX and NaY. The double bond present inside octene allows the molecules to compete for the adsorption sites with benzene. The competitive effect of octene prevents the fifth benzene molecule to adsorb in the NaX supercage within the investigated concentration range.","inCitations":["2eb75cc9a24ac9cf8650343995af0027f55c8dcb","fee56a6115e3bcc38c0102eb4fc8f70ae23956e5"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Unexpected Si:Al effect on the binary mixtures liquid phase adsorption selectivities in faujasite zeolites.","doi":"10.1021/ja053375z","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1021/ja053375z","venue":"Journal of the American Chemical Society"}

CI/R model was induced by right middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) for 90 min and reperfusion for 225 min. EA (2 Hz, 3 mA, continuous waves) was applied to \"Fengchi\" (GB 20) for 20 min, with a 10 min rest, and given once again fo 20 min. The concentrations of DA and its metabolites [3,4- dihydroxy-phenyl acetic acid (DOPAC) and homovanillic acid (HVA)] in the extracellular fluid of the striatum were determined by microdialysis and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe extracellular levels of DA, DOPAC and HVA in normal group, sham group and sham+ EA group had no significant changes during the whole study. The extracellular level of DA peaked 15-45 min after CI and 0-30 min after CI/R (P < 0.05). A rising trend was also observed 120 min following CI/R. DOPAC level peaked 15 min and 75 min after CI and 75 min after CI/R. After EA, DA level was significantly lower in EA group than that in model group 90 min after CI/R (P < 0.05), and no peak was observed again. After EA, DOPAC level maintained its basic level, and no peak was found after CI/R. The changing trend of HVA was similar to that of DOPAC, and the extracellular HVA level in EA + model group was significantly lower than that in model group 75 min after CI/R.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nEA can decrease the accumulation of DA and its metabolites in the extracellular fluid of the striatum, which may contribute to its effect in preventing the brain from CI/R injury.","inCitations":["f4d8fa0d450459a56c7b480f207ed7d18fa7650c"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"[Dynamic changes of dopamine and its metabolite levels in the rat striatum after cerebral ischemia-reperfusion and electroacupuncture].","doi":"","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"Zhen ci yan jiu = Acupuncture research"}

An anti-rabies virus immunized phage-display Fab library was constructed from peripheral blood lymphocytes from vaccinated volunteers. The immunized antibody library, with a diversity of 6.7×10(8), was used to select and produce antibodies that bound to rabies virus glycoprotein. After five rounds of immobilized fixed rabies virion panning, four unique DNA sequences were found in the higher binding clones, and only one, Fab094, showed neutralization activity. Fab094 components were analyzed by ELISA, immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescent staining. ELISA and immunofluorescence showed that Fab094 bound specifically to rabies virions. Immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry showed that Fab094 reacted with rabies virus glycoprotein. To improve the penetration power of Fab094 antibodies, we developed Fab094 calcium phosphate nanoparticles (Fab094-CPNPs) and tested their efficacy. The rapid fluorescent focus inhibition test indicated that the neutralizing antibody titers of Fab094 and Fab094-CPNPs were reached at 200.17 IU/Kg and 246.12 IU/Kg, respectively. These findings were confirmed in vivo in a Kunming mouse challenge model. Our results demonstrate that human Fab094 and Fab094-CPNPs are efficacious candidate drugs to replace rabies immunoglobulin in post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP).","inCitations":["1a3e937d3100b093eab5574f90a889153f764028","d9d2c5479f6bbe4f57c3050b0a9853b4a496c380","c85124e862a7509def71d83825601e7cfd0feee5","c3eadd5281587a8cf0c159cf016b00acf2b45c0f","764b70dbc85162b001c1a9cad96c7d074c33ef25","f66e3369febfa092a4ca36fa1c66de9a6e4dc70d","68e50e2b0b38b5fb85f5f35e81c2981cff30d464","c92d4b764634f984f72efccaa63b365bebc10616","d7f424eaa01a288101dd0eb7cf88b701364f6bdf","a0eccf2dc6fcdddbaa1a0c966e81f72e0c01e3ea","8c6481410edf3f92cce55152caa9ab3f44fdabfe","7a4f183af06dbaba2cd05d09645755347482fc4c"],"pdfUrls":["http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0019848&type=printable","ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/pmc/3b/b3/PLoS_One_2011_May_9_6(5)_e19848.tar.gz"],"title":"Characterization of a Human Antibody Fragment Fab and Its Calcium Phosphate Nanoparticles that Inhibit Rabies Virus Infection with Vaccine","doi":"10.1371/journal.pone.0019848","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0019848","venue":"PloS one"}

Such algorithms are dependent on a good initial approximation of the target shape. The purpose of this work was to develop a reliable method for automatic generation of a starting point for segmentation of the lateral ventricle. The algorithm uses a parametric representation of an average lateral ventricle, which is customized for each individual by modulating the parametric coefficients based on the brain parenchymal fraction. The method was developed with a training set of 6 healthy controls and 25 patients with multiple sclerosis, and tested on an additional set of 10 patients. Compared to the average ventricle, this new approach provided a closer approximation to the manually segmented ventricular shape in 81% of the cases in the training set and 100% of the additional test set.","inCitations":["3df8cc118b935aca93dfbd1d169d047d8c41c260"],"pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1007/3-540-45786-0_60"],"title":"Automated Approximation of Lateral Ventricular Shape in Magnetic Resonance Images of Multiple Sclerosis Patients","doi":"10.1007/3-540-45786-0_60","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/3-540-45786-0_60","venue":"MICCAI"}
