On the genotypic side, a variable length representation is used: the complexity of the representation of each individual is evolved by the algorithm rather than being prescribed by some fixed mesh of the design domain, resulting in self-adaptive complexity. On the phenotypic side, an original adaptive mechanism is proposed that maintains both feasible and infeasible individuals, thus exploring both sides of the boundary of the feasible region, where the optimum structure is known to lie. Not only does this improves the results of past work in on Evolutionary Topological Optimum Design on standard benchmark bidimensional cantilever problems, but it also allows to address three-dimensional problems who had up to now stayed beyond reach for evolutionary algorithms.","inCitations":["f98cb6435e26c47e7600b696ac1cd2787846574d","ab1ef8c9f5fce97ff329a138e15cfdc5376b4035","f3e65cd7159526aecccd534198045ca259d10998","6e1a77671b1027cd7ba94585b84b2d3dc0fbb08a","599a87ecf2fb2a42d3db5cb5d4d49d6f2f5d5d1a","93cf6cd4f986bce1b11bafd5e475b0b3da8d42ac","bbfbc5f53afc8b4844c618edc4dfe71fde295e3f","eca57041e316d44f3e2e486c96e33cc1b7c23d9c","c0958a4ed8bbce8f1c0aa47e5b127f7ff36f7f4c","0de1936a5d0161a43026ef1bdc3cf56072f2f7ee","ec667fdfe487b2d2a105c1d3675f85d66b96e348","54986a0838cc258cc33534d7a2384f9d7f1d5397","4fcfbbaf8027bc78be26a69355f65c2258dde724","c403274cadd8d3a70c4bf388fd1c115190039e1c","e87d5c482ff9cb13ffbd8dc623014bc27bd017fb","5861cadc26927d83cc7b511f576bfeb895ce8481","b4254af2ef1356f39362b3197906519878c81bee"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.lri.fr/~marc/EEAAX/papers/marc/acdm2000.ps.gz","http://www.eeaax.polytechnique.fr/papers/marc/acdm2000.ps.gz","http://www.cs.cinvestav.mx/~constraint/papers/hamda00.pdf","http://hal.inria.fr/docs/00/06/75/36/PDF/acdm2000.pdf","https://www.cs.cinvestav.mx/~constraint/papers/hamda00.pdf"],"title":"Adaptive Techniques for Evolutionary Topological Optimum Design","doi":"10.1007/978-1-4471-0519-0_10","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4471-0519-0_10","venue":""}

Many of these advances have influenced our management of patients with genetically-determined disorders and, in particular, have improved our accuracy in calculating the risks ofrecurrence ofhereditary diseases. With the increasing knowledge of genetics among the general population, and with their increasing desire to plan their families, the demand for genetic counselling has grown considerably in recent years. Genetic counselling is concerned both with making an accurate assessment of the genetic risk and with explaining this risk to those seeking advice. Accurate assessment of genetic risk depends firstly on an accurate diagnosis, secondly on a good family history with verification of relevant medical information from hospital or other records, and thirdly on knowledge of the way in which the particular condition is inherited (Carter, I969). It is the purpose of this paper to discuss some of the advances that have taken place in the past decade which have influenced our assessment ofgenetic risk in hereditary disorders ofthe eye.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://bjo.bmj.com/content/bjophthalmol/58/4/427.full.pdf"],"title":"Recent advances in ophthalmic genetics.

This is why you are asked to watch out for certain words and phrases before you listen. You need to be able to recognize these amongst a barrage of language which may be too fast or complicated for you to understand – especially the first time. So don’t panic when faced with a new conversation and don’t feel that you have to understand every single word. It just isn’t necessary. Remember too that there will be language which you will want to be able to produce yourself and a great deal more which you will want to understand, but not necessarily to use. It’s a good idea at this stage to distinguish between what you want to say (active language) and what you simply want to understand (passive).

The \"pt\" cards can be used to indicate if no return was submitted that month. Thank you to Tanaya Devi for the suggestion.Adds the mailing address columns to both monthly and yearly data. In 2017 the agency \"New Orleans\" in Louisiana (ORI = LANPD00) reported hundreds of times more unfounded attempted burglaries than actual attempted burglaries for every month. These were all changed to NA (unfounded total burglaries was also changed to NA. V9 release notes: Adds column for index crimes. Index Violent is the sum of murder, total robbery, total rape, and total aggravated assault. Index Property is the sum of burglary, total motor vehicle theft, and total theft (arson is an index crime but is not available in this data set). Index Total is the sum of Index Violent and Index Property. When looking at these columns please consider that some agencies don't always report all crimes (e.g. Chicago didn't report rape between 1986-2012) so these variables may be undercounts. All data now from FBI, not NACJD. See here for the R code I used to read in the files and clean data, and the setup files made to read them in. https://github.com/jacobkap/crime_dataChanges some column names so all columns are V8 release notes: Adds 2017 data. V7 release notes: Removes SPSS (.sav) and Excel (.csv) files. Changes column names for clearances to \"tot_clr_...\" to make explicit that this is all clearances, not just adult clearances. The formatting of the monthly data has changed from wide to long. This means that each agency-month has a single row. The old data had each agency being a single row with each month-crime (e.g. jan_act_murder) being a column. Now there will just be a single column for each crime (e.g. act_murder) and the month can be identified in the month column. Adds a month column and a date column. This date column is always set to the first of the month. It is NOT the date that a crime occurred or was reported. It is only there to make it easier to create time-series graphs that require a date input. Removes all card columns. This was done to reduce file size. Reorders crime columns to the order of assaults/deaths of officers, actual crimes, total clearance, clearance under age 18, unfounded. Within each category the columns are alphabetized.Monthly data and yearly data are now in different zip folders to download. V6 release notes: Fix bug where Philadelphia Police Department had incorrect FIPS county code. V5 release notes: Changes the word \"larceny\" to \"theft\" in column names - eg. from \"act_larceny\" to \"act_theft.\" Fixes bug where state abbrebation was NA for Washington D.C., Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Canal Zone.Fixes bug where officers_killed_by_accident was not appearing in yearly data. Note that 1979 does not have any officers killed (by felony or accident) or officers assaulted data.Adds aggravated assault columns to the monthly data. Aggravated assault is the sum of all assaults other than simple assault (assaults using gun, knife, hand/feet, and other weapon). Note that summing all crime columns to get a total crime count will double count aggravated assault as it is already the sum of existing columns. Reorder columns to put all month descriptors (e.g. \"jan_month_included\", \"jan_card_1_type\") before any crime data.Due to extremely irregular data in the unfounded columns for New Orleans (ORI = LANPD00) for years 2014-2016, I have change all unfounded column data for New Orleans for these years to NA. As an example, New Orleans reported about 45,000 unfounded total burglaries in 2016 (the 3rd highest they ever reported). This is 18 times largest than the number of actual total burglaries they reported that year (2,561) and nearly 8 times larger than the next largest reported unfounded total burglaries in any agency or year. Prior to 2014 there were no more than 10 unfounded total burglaries reported in New Orleans in any year. There were 10 obvious data entry errors in officers killed by felony/accident that I changed to NA.In 1974 the agency \"Boston\" (ORI = MA01301) reported 23 officers killed by accident during November.In 1978 the agency \"Pittsburgh\" (ORI = PAPPD00) reported 576 officers killed by accident during March.In 1978 the agency \"Bronx Transit Authority\" (ORI = NY06240) reported 56 officers killed by accident during April.In 1978 the agency \"Bronx Transit Authority\" (ORI = NY06240) reported 56 officers killed by accident during June.In 1978 the agency \"Bronx Transit Authority\" (ORI = NY06240) reported 56 officers killed by felony during April.In 1978 the agency \"Bronx Transit Authority\" (ORI = NY06240) reported 56 officers killed by felony during June.In 1978 the agency \"Queens Transit Authority\" (ORI = NY04040) reported 56 officers killed by accident during May.In 1978 the agency \"Queens Transit Authority\" (ORI = NY04040) reported 56 officers killed by felony during May.In 1996 the agency \"Ruston\" in Louisiana (ORI = LA03102) reported 30 officers killed by felony during September.In 1997 the agency \"Washington University\" in Missouri (ORI = MO0950E) reported 26 officers killed by felony during March.V4 release notes: Merges data with LEAIC data to add FIPS codes, census codes, agency type variables, and ORI9 variable. Makes all column names lowercase.Change some variable names Makes values in character columns lowercase. Adds months_reported variable to yearly data.Combines monthly and yearly files into a single zip file (per data type). V3 release notes: fixes a bug in Version 2 where 1993 data did not properly deal with missing values, leading to enormous counts of crime being reported. Summary: This is a collection of Offenses Known and Clearances By Arrest data from 1960 to 2017. Each zip file contains monthly and yearly data files. The monthly files contain one data file per year (58 total, 1960-2017) as well as a codebook for each year. The yearly file aggregated the monthly data by year and concatenates each year together into a single file containing data for all years. All the data is from the FBI and read into R using the package asciiSetupReader. All work to clean the data and save it in various file formats was also done in R. For the R code used to clean this data, see here. https://github.com/jacobkap/crime_data. As a description of what UCR Offenses Known and Clearances By Arrest data contains, the following is copied from ICPSR's 2015 page for the data. The Uniform Crime Reporting Program Data: Offenses Known and Clearances By Arrest data set is a compilation of offenses reported to law enforcement agencies in the United States. Due to the vast number of categories of crime committed in the United States, the FBI has limited the type of crimes included in this compilation to those crimes which people are most likely to report to police and those crimes which occur frequently enough to be analyzed across time. Crimes included are criminal homicide, forcible rape, robbery, aggravated assault, burglary, larceny-theft, and motor vehicle theft. Much information about these crimes is provided in this data set. The number of times an offense has been reported, the number of reported offenses that have been cleared by arrests, and the number of cleared offenses which involved offenders under the age of 18 are the major items of information collected.","inCitations":["ff9096a1a4cf74a42a2a2e1a135119c6e76da396","8340f56fa4b5b2c63dcb66118a0cfdd2675fb537","547b0c49de223c871752b6986d278ff155c9e103","af3249acb9b1a1d1c29106ae39d3602a49325644","dcc1269287cb85685610a4e8f0d82eb1c936a791","a3f0a4b6a085dfca87489dd35423872c6ed52efc","547ddd4a3de7e833a8d249bfdb847e06c32c3c3f","3b7ca72a9ead4e691ea18c4b97624dae4367ff5c","7dda16681cceb93e514b19da7d99e9a3f944e622","f06df8426f9e5b602286af51586353441a8bfca2"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Uniform Crime Reporting Program Data: Offenses Known and Clearances by Arrest, 1960-2017","doi":"10.3886/E100707V10","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.3886/E100707V10","venue":""}

Attorneys instead call them “trends.” The trend considered in this article is best reflected by a review of recent articles dealing with the “most widely accepted” or “best” forensic schedule delay analysis methodology [1]. These articles would have us believe that the trend in this area is to use retrospective time impact analysis to identify a project’s critical path, the party responsible for the delay, and the amount of delay or recovery [2]. For the reasons described in the paragraphs below, I believe this trend (or fad) in thinking should pass, and pass quickly. Schedule delay analysis, as it existed prior to the widespread use of PCs and portable CPM software, was a time-consuming, laborious, and expensive undertaking. Experts reviewed bar charts of early CPM printouts and compared them to the planned sequence in order to identify the critical path. These as-planned vs. as-built analyses depended almost exclusively on the knowledge and experience of the expert: could he or she explain what happened in a logical and rational manner consistent with the known facts? With the widespread use of PC-based electronic scheduling software, Primavera and other schedule software creators revolutionized not only the capability to perform forward-looking predictive project scheduling, but also delay analysis. One of the great inventions was the development of time impact analysis. [3]. This methodology harnessed the power of the computer and coupled it with the best of the expert’s knowledge. The power of this methodology is reflected in its widespread adoption and adaptation in US federal government contracts [4]. Invariably, experts working to better identify critical paths in large complicated projects adopted and modified the TIAs to assist them in performing forensic schedule delay analysis. Unfortunately, TIA methodology in this situation is so attenuated, that its accuracy is suspect. Nonetheless, the relative ease of the methodology, heavy emphasis on technology, and seeming removal of subjective opinion, made this methodology seem more scientific and thus accurate. As such, the TIA may be more successful in Daubert challenges than the as-planned vs. as-built [5]. Perhaps the peak of this trend/fad, touting TIA as the “best methodology,” occurred in the UK, in 2002, when The Society of Construction Law published its “Delay and Disruption Protocol,” a guide book/manual on schedule delay analysis (SCL Protocol). The manual reflected the extraordinary work of many of the best minds associated with scheduling, or programming, as it is called in the UK. This impressive document discussed the relative merits of various methodologies that have been developed to perform forensic schedule delay analysis. The Protocol went further and stated the following.","inCitations":["6634f0c80a72b9f1da1ac66fb9739619590d629d"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.icoste.org/AACE2007%20Papers/Nashville_cdr08.pdf"],"title":"Retrospective TIAs: Time to Lay Them to Rest","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

As disc control level L4-L5 was considered where nothing was injected. The pig was sacrifed 48 h after injection of discogel and the spine from D10 to S1 was removed and fixed in 10% buffered formalin. The anatomical specimens were cut with an electric saw and analyzed by routine technique then stained with formalin. The specimens containing bone material were treated by DEKAL solution. The specimens were stained with hematoxylin-eosin method and then analyzed by histochemical (Masson -Van Gieson PAS and trichromic stains ) and immunochemical methods. Morphostructural examination disclosed a granular material coloured black by hematoxylin-eosin method (tungsten) in paravertebral tissue both in the muscular and connective tissue. Some inflammatory elements like lymphomonocyte cells and venous stasis were found. No alteration was found where discogel was injected, and the nucleus pulposus, disc, chondromixoid and root ganglium were normal. After intradiscal, intraforaminal, epidural and intramuscular injection of Discogel ® no morpho-structural changes in nuclear tissue and annulus were found. Further studies on pigs with immunohistochemical analysis after treatment will confirm the morphological alterations induced by discogel and its action.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"SUMMARY - This study assessed the impact and modification of intradiscal, intraforaminal, epi- dural and intramuscular swine injection of a new material, Discogel","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Two main sources of error can be identified: (1) from numerical dispersion and numerical anisotropy and (2) by modeling the response of internal grid boundaries. Conventional discretization criteria to reduce the effects of numerical dispersion and numerical anisotropy have long been established (5-8 gridpoints per wavelength for a fourth-order accurate FD scheme). We analyze the second source of errors, comparing different staggered-grid FD solutions to the Cagniard-de Hoop solution in models with fluid-solid contacts. Our results confirm that it is sufficient to rely on conventional discretization criteria if the fluid-solid interface is aligned with the grid. If accurate modeling of the Scholte wave is required, then a new imaging method we propose should be used to allow for conventional sampling of the wavefield to minimize numerical dispersion. However, for an interface not aligned with the grid (irregular interfaces), a spatial sampling of at least 15 gridpoints per minimum wavelength is required to obtain acceptable results, particularly in seismic seabed applications where Scholte waves may need to be modeled more accurately.","inCitations":["ca56c4609b448d7218cd801330401cff57e7898a","ffd79be0971ef7bb8daedaf9f405d705c0487430","01dab5e5e8dfc0be105f61bb5a4537a3a8e6a8a9","3950bcba15e68dfbbf4c9909f5cd8a3847ed63f7","ff42526a16b3436e17fee354e191fba9906c7e37","af0fb69aa05765f886e16c94dd36d77fb480083c","2f94858cc2e021921cfdc3cfca78211c9433142f","cba36ddb34b64acba89a41ca2c0ba10349e8bf45","4f3558e1b3d9517381184619570e4e959f079fd3","c68bc892d5eb3c9751042798031be9364dcd59d2","eaff72c56ee7ad44f8f18306bd35efab1419507d","7f0cb1a016887ba1eb398008933d11024836182f","1dec1148fad123d4990a5c0f2bb257a9726dfc90","435d55250deebe4fc0bd7a2671f15dc0c9cea4fa","53a7f59c0bb367abfe5ea1b3f9a4c0f5e76ebdd5","7d977254781b47bf07878c9ad77f6d007f7a47ad","6bd81de383ca22f251305c6909142d79367b0f17","e06d1c310edd07917f9fb4a42f869cbd07eed270","ac99b858011b37ed89c1491d640f6d0a830aacee","fadf9ab34eef281496ff348a8134a7b4e41bd082","f072612a9c62952379c9afad8d433e34c78bcbbc","27662c71c71d93e8e55690ae65aa1c1e0659ca77","9d3d5944cd42907218fca93ad1610ec830e4c132","3faca12215e5996cff0cf221da17e3e9c20c9728","0ef59c6b9944a71f270c045a2a035b61d5af6430","26118ae7d2781db5fb923635e5e038dbfc2fd722","4704f49194a3863520ea24e34539e009c20b5145","9a40cbaf4e4efe50397c98a37280211d43c8e294","de90864530ab3b0c907dd7b02dcbf2906fae3b8d","4b3c19c795c2dfe9e085f4988901012fab097a50","fa9d0b511c66adf834ec4903529ac51c50401a92","7c350c61885ad63d7c5db87262c9f56c0139c44c","88b41270665351ed033e5f2f9e87924accb5d26d","b3b933056ccc5bf163fafe88281b4ccde4ab52f8","82837c69b7c41af70ffe1f6072886c15bbccddf8","84252f10726ddae1828cbe397ffafd530799bfb6","9cbb6a68f85f7f70b7f0d0c6d3e979fa7c2055b6","1a1b39f164780c29027027ccb197e90bae2158ab","104ac3fbcfa86ffff887c0469ddab6ab03cb5879","0772bbb5c743ede5baa714854b989f1c2d216a85","a235c463745514c44c044ee4a579d3eada09f9b8","d8ce9541752bb9c93e65917cc3e82345d243897e","52d24b626f6cec57160369301c20728df150dfc0","d274e011ff9bcc59b22c8296eb2cf2820d564fa4"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.geo.uu.nl/~seismain/pdf/geophysics02-fd.pdf"],"title":"Finite-difference modeling of wave propagation in a fluid-solid configuration","doi":"10.1190/1.1468623","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1190/1.1468623","venue":""}

Berbagai peraturan tentang PBB sebagai pajak properti di Indonesia belum memiliki fasitas untuk itu. Oleh karenanya bentuk perlakuan yang paling mungkin menurut Youngman (1999) adalah membedakan assessment level (rata-rata persentase nilai yang ditetapkan dibandingkan nilai pasarnya). Nilai Jual Objek Pajak (NJOP) sebenarnya hanya sebagai dasar pemungutan Pajak Bumi dan Bangunan (PBB) telah dijadikan sebagai rujukan dalam berbagai kebutuhan. Oleh karena itu apabila hal tersebut terjadi akan mengakibatkan inefisiensi dalam sistem ekonomi dan bertentangan dengan keadilan dan kewajaran pajak properti. Untuk membuktikan adanya perbedaan assessment level antara properti komersial dibandingkan perumahan dan bahan perbaikan sistem penilaian perlu dilakukan analisis performa penilaian massal. Hasil penelitian terhadap 86 sampel (54 perumahan, 32 komersial) di wilayah Kecamatan Bojongloa Kaler dan Babakan Ciparay diperoleh, rata-rata assessment ratio (AR) properti perumahan adalah 63,3%, dan komersial 56,2%. Dari perhitungan variabilitas (keseragaman individu dalam kelompok) diperoleh Coeficient of Dispersion (COD) perumahan 27,3%, dan COD komersial 18,5%. Angka COD perumahan terlampau tinggi dibandingkan dengan yang dipersyaratkan (15%) untuk itu hams dilakukan revaluasi. Hasil Uji komparatif dua sampel (Uji t) diperoleh hasil bahwa tidak terdapat perbedaan assessment level antara jenis properti komersial dengan properti perumahan Sedang hasil uji assessment level dengan Ho hipotesis 63,9% properti komersial masih dibawah dari level hipotesis tersebut. Dari hasil overlay antara peta nilai tanah dan peta klasifikasi properti, menunjukkan bahwa penentuan NJOP tanah kurang memperhitungkan jenis penggunaan lahan ( properti). Kenyataan tersebut menjadikan rata-rata AR dari properti komersial lebih rendah dari properti lainnya.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"ANALISIS VISUAL PERFORMA PENILAIAN MASSAL DALAM MENENTUKAN NILAI JUAL OBJEK PAJAK (NJOP) PROPERTI PERUMAHAN DAN PROPERTI KOMERSIAL (Studi Kasus : Kecamatan Bojongloa Kaler dan Babakan Ciparay, Kota Bandung)","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Measurements in 2008 and 2009 indicate that this net canopy reduction has reduced peak snowpack and melt rate differences between remaining stands (including large clearcuts, younger regenerating stands and dead mature pine stands), relative to a healthy forest canopy with smaller clearcuts. The Distributed Hydrology Soil Vegetation Model (DHSVM) was calibrated and run at 200 m resolution across the catchment, and simulated snowmelt rates and snow-covered area compared relatively well to distributed satellite or ground-based measurements. Snowpack and ablation rates were 10–20% higher during the 2008 and 2009 winters than when running the model for the pre-MPB landscape in 2000 using the same input meteorological data, resulting in almost no difference in the snowcover period. A greater snowpack volume which enters the stream network faster inevitably has implications for streamflows, flood risks and water resources, and these are assessed during the next stage of this research project.","inCitations":["48fab493a63b8a08b858f6fbb705e349a0d79217","8c0e71c38b8809dc9933e0f294df061cee1ac7a2","652642c7193e0b0368e21de9f14ca7723320f71e","24f803fde0274225cc86d74d4012187b9e8b8a7a","a76e8c9c1544035b6f0e7722c97d2da8e0493a4a","017c80cd17d25c4f64eb977b6b49bf065510a0a8","7f9535a44dba4fd50ae07476c5d781eef4b94682","947302901c1ad72c0c6b0235199644de308b2e0c","2f1e5d80149b476a60b87eca5d0c3c4103212884","d47357ac13af2c08171e4caced58d85033bb55f4","83b4d68cf9bac93ecfc3814f2d636d2caac5f4f8","9f7371aedc6aa1f7bb07608e2af6303ac2dee685","a187fdcb4c6210a3dd0e7cd26ba4ab2fae1fb694","f710059c86664fc89844df11837346117ea3c2b9","18f6aeb52dc967ec515516d62eb7edb1350aa165","08ab559c0b0a0094648476525e24c22ea3b58fba","c0d4c4a8cd6b49abb2f075ce847d3145d3f8f8b5","350962b12242fef81763cb50d36408377d5e1d30","7402e288e725e311fac2197a7a66a1381c76921e","fd8c6eb4513b6cd1c36cd470933f5bdb10f7539b","587b7a50e7096723fb270a9ddea9ae564f02c574","4ce96ff3b6b1c37bf60e9dd2e5cd4eade511710b","ef34852ed7fc472e1e848713797ff0f7c3ee1459","a66bf42cf21eae603b02f64dcbfd701d8a3b0bf7","0681456f697e2684826ba9cf85b1893ab8b937a9","39e04ff971c39e660cf40225ee7f3ac7acc5bc63","226af12dc2686721737fbc931ddadfa518424c7b","9817f9b63fc38226e524fa16278e8b8ec908834e","513196c7d79b0d7d2ef256dfc9d154895ff998bd","aab537193a9e47f4d096ae80f5518be54303b42c","3ce756185adc35fc402021dc989102dd402acfc0"],"pdfUrls":["http://wpg.forestry.oregonstate.edu/sites/wpg/files/seminars/2010_Bewley.pdf"],"title":"Variability of snow water equivalent and snow energetics across a large catchment subject to Mountain Pine Beetle infestation and rapid salvage logging","doi":"10.1016/j.jhydrol.2010.05.031","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2010.05.031","venue":""}

The review is mainly focused on biofilm-growing microorganisms because this form of growth poses a threat to chronically infected or immunocompromised patients and is difficult to eradicate from medical devices.

These optical properties also depend strongly on the particle morphology and internal topology. The efficiency factors for scattering Qsca, absorption Qabs, extinction Qext, backscattering Qbk, as well as the asymmetry parameter 〈cos〉, linear polarization P, and scattering phase functions S11 are analyzed in detail as functions of morphology and internal topology. Backscattering quantities (like Qbk and P and S11 at large scattering angles) are affected most significantly. The behavior of these quantities depends strongly on the internal mixing of the constituent materials making up the particle. Effective medium theories (EMTs), which assume that the particle is homogeneous and are applied frequently in radiative transfer studies, can underestimate Qsca and S11 especially when high carbon contents are considered. Contrarily, EMTs also tend to overestimate the values of the asymmetry parameter and Qabs.","inCitations":["bb07c2dc745f741064605216d24e92c109a8f633","aeb51dc4c7bfe1cf0731c784099fce54e60b4862","3455822fd2ae3bdf4c548d2974bb9987ca36a205","a33f95c681853d76a632c8bdf78c93d3ef22e9a3","8cdcf528615792204d8f662ba02d1d9135a99ada","58bcd1ccd5deaee905c9c9286d3c29ebf0d87d5a","7ac994beb758c4f587c269a028cc7f8e78ad695e","84990fe60c9a7063a3dedcd9d81455a76e733288"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Optical behavior of composite carbonaceous aerosols: DDA and EMT approaches","doi":"10.1016/j.jqsrt.2007.11.007","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jqsrt.2007.11.007","venue":""}

This may be a contentious statement, but relative to other social sciences, for example, economics, entrepreneurship is perhaps ill-defined and still developing its theoretical base which has yet to be stoutly tested through sound empirical research. The Academy of Management views entrepreneurship as a division not a discipline and likewise the British Academy of Management categorises it as an area of special interest; this despite the scope of entrepreneurship. Entrepreneurship has only two fourstarrated journals in which scholars may publish their work; the alternative is to publish in lowerrated journals in the field or in journals from the mainstream disciplines. Hence, this series of handbooks published by Edward Elgar is potentially a significant milestone; a marker which may help scholars reflect on how far the subject has come, and where further interdisciplinary research may be usefully carried out to help solidify the knowledge base that is entrepreneurship. Scholarship in entrepreneurship has grown significantly since the mid1990s. Over the years we have witnessed disputed territory of how it is defined, its disciplinary bases, the language in which it is couched, the unit of analysis upon which researchers should focus their attention, and a tussle over paradigmatic approaches. Despite interesting and original contributions from across the globe, the field of entrepreneurship has been dominated by AngloAmerican perspectives and hence academic production in associated journals. This volume deliberately highlights all these issues on which we as researchers may reflect and learn, and advance the field by questioning prevailing, indeed dominant, assumptions, historically internalised research practices and perspectives with a focus on inclusivity and rigour in scientific endeavour, and its impact on society and economy. Although there is considerable new work produced and published in the area, we should never forget that as scholars we aim to stand on the shoulders of other great thinkers so that we can see further. As Alvarez and Barney (2013) have pointed out in a recent paper, for entrepreneurship to stand as a unique subject domain, it needs to generate theories that delineate things in other disciplines in ways that scholars in those disciplines have not done previously. This entails a more reflexive approach and theorising from an empirical evidence base. This series of Handbooks in Entrepreneurship produced by Edward Elgar facilitates an important task in scholarship, that of reviewing, reflecting upon and presenting the state of the art of our subject. Entrepreneurship is potentially vast, multifaceted and complex, so much so that we can each only claim expert knowledge in a narrow segment. However, we do need to be able to see the bigger picture and in doing so the possible connections between the various parts that help draw them together into a coherent whole. To this end, this Handbook commences with two thoughtprovoking chapters, raises issues of theoretical framing, moves on to highlight the importance of","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://www.elgaronline.com/downloadpdf/9781849809238.00007.pdf"],"title":"Introduction to the handbook","doi":"10.1057/978-1-137-55783-4_1","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1057/978-1-137-55783-4_1","venue":""}

Despite the proven clinical efficacy of tamoxifen and aromatase inhibitors, many breast cancer survivors either fail to take the correct dosage at the prescribed frequency (adherence) or discontinue therapy (persistence). This systematic review aims to: (1) determine the prevalence of adherence and persistence to adjuvant hormonal therapy among breast cancer survivors in clinical practice, and (2) identify correlates of adherence and persistence. We searched Medline, PubMed, PsycINFO, and CINAHL for studies that measured rates and/or correlates of adherence and/or persistence to adjuvant hormonal therapy. Studies were reviewed in a multi-step process: (1) the lead author screened titles and abstracts of all potentially eligible studies; (2) each coauthor reviewed a random 5 % sample of abstracts; and (3) two sets of coauthors each reviewed half of all “maybe” abstracts. Any disagreements were discussed until consensus was reached. Twenty-nine studies met inclusion criteria. Prevalence of adherence ranged from 41 to 72 % and discontinuation (i.e., nonpersistence) ranged from 31 to 73 %, measured at the end of 5 years of treatment. Extremes of age (older or younger), increasing out-of-pocket costs, follow-up care with a general practitioner (vs. oncologist), higher CYP2D6 activity, switching from one form of therapy to another, and treatment side effects were negatively associated with adherence and/or persistence. Taking more medications at baseline, referral to an oncologist, and earlier year at diagnosis were positively associated with adherence and/or persistence. Adherence and persistence to adjuvant hormonal therapy among breast cancer survivors is suboptimal. Many of the correlates of adherence and persistence studied to date are not modifiable. Our review reveals a critical need for further research on modifiable factors associated with adherence to adjuvant hormonal therapy, and the development of behavioral interventions to improve

Networks can vary in composition and expanse, with a variety of examples present in daily life (e.g., the internet, acquaintances, animal groups). The functionality of a given network generally depends upon the connectivity among its constituent members (nodes). As with acquaintances and popular web sites, these connections often change over time. Most network analyses focus on static systems using snapshots of data taken in time. Investigators then search for correlations between the degree of connectivity within the network and the network's ability to resist interference (i.e., noise) or external perturbation (e.g., power loss, attack). We seek insight into the capability of network analysis to discern properties of a dynamic network (of collective behavior) shaping its structure, function, and resilience using swarming behavior as our model system. Specifically, in this paper we begin answering the question: how many neighbors should an individual in a networked swarm track for maximum efficiency of information transfer, critical to survival under attack and failure scenarios. Through numerical systems based on ecological theory we seek to better understand networked collective behavior, e.g., susceptibility to outside attack, which can be used to guide the engineering design of artificial networks. We believe this work presents an opportunity to mine the assets of ecology for improved development of disruptive technologies and a net-centric Army.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://apps.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a505781.pdf"],"title":"Discerning Properties of a Self-Organizing Network (Swarm) Shaping its Structure, Function, and Resilience","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Adicionalmente se realizaron mediciones de perdida de masa en condiciones de erosion y erosion-corrosion. La topografia de las superficies se evaluo usando microscopia optica y electronica de barrido. Esta informacion, conjuntamente con los resultados de perdida de masa y de los ensayos electroquimicos, se uso para establecer los mecanismos de degradacion del material en las diferentes condiciones de ensayo. De los resultados obtenidos en este trabajo se observo que el sinergismo es una parte muy significativa de la degradacion de este acero (66.5%) y que el proceso fundamental de remocion de material puede clasificarse como corrosion acelerada por erosion.","inCitations":["6452be75ef57cfa419362c042d434ac806b6a55d"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.scielo.unal.edu.co/pdf/dyna/v76n159/a05v76n159.pdf"],"title":"Sinergismo Erosión-corrosión En Un Acero Inoxidable Martensítico Aisi 410","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

With symbolic computation, the Bell-polynomial approach is developed to directly bilinearize those three sets of differential–difference nonlinear evolution equations (NLEEs). This Bell-polynomial approach does not rely on any dependent variable transformation, which constitutes the key step and main difficulty of the Hirota bilinear method, and thus has the advantage in the bilinearization of the differential–difference NLEEs. Based on the bilinear forms obtained, the N-soliton solutions are constructed in terms of the $$N \\times N$$N×N Wronskian determinant. Graphic illustrations demonstrate that those solutions, more general than the existing results, permit some new properties, such as the solitonic propagation and interactions for the BC lattice equations, and the nonnegative dark solitons for the BM lattice equations.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Bell-polynomial approach and Wronskian determinant solutions for three sets of differential–difference nonlinear evolution equations with symbolic computation","doi":"10.1007/s00033-017-0853-1","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00033-017-0853-1","venue":""}

The all-atom replica-exchange molecular dynamics (REMD) methodology allows us to calculate the thermodynamics of folding/unfolding of peptides and small proteins, and provides a way of evaluating the reliability of force fields. We apply the REMD to obtain equilibrium folding/unfolding thermodynamics of a 21-residue peptide containing only alanine residues in explicit aqueous solution. The thermodynamics of this peptide is modeled with both the OPLS/AA/L and the A94/MOD force fields. We find that the helical content and the values for the helix propagation and nucleation parameters for this alanine peptide are consistent with measurements on similar peptides and with calculations using the modified AMBER force field (A94/MOD). The nature of conformations, both folded and unfolded, that contributes to the helix-coil transition profile, however, is quite different between these two force fields.","inCitations":["8e106de9e575a96c09a6f5bb484127537a020c78","9d2b724d239a6a6247fcbda95da89aed276ee4b4","07a15fb8c87cf788c27d0eed5841e926d3712ae1","e3da9d71c54f1b0f13b74a726b03854b0d8374a3","a0c178dadf20c326012fd80b83f4c1b566bf6088","16eef9d0a55739c99e9c44dbc5a38686516d2aea","cf3505ab4552dc0feb03aac6f8975433fcbd5ad9","ae48a18672355d3781cdf3ffa44c56506db7e30e","4d7ed08b93bcc9242779796cbc37dac8e510cc93","804d6ae4a096b2f9c5b1651180a45e8dabc261fe","0130533a3251f8e184e004296e4f1ccf1346257f","ebe1c1401ab11a71ab0d40b735947f6205255e70","4d313e5386cb0f2f002e1b5db06383b4a2459185","8f06eff344261772f49f6f772958bb612f0a96b9","766e79959be1cb22733651c8807b4fbcdd75f66b","5a3528b0765e6c4132cc7214b94d5705a01a5b91","b48be439a79cb262dd2df3cd69651efa04b50227","c14cf5010749396cd33be630769fc3e5bd5ea548","74ffe4a77796dfe813ef3f9142fdcb91c747be90","efea2e6db9cb7b6409261990fc4ed04681463019","b82804a5060c5ba8e5a41c98bd0df5286b70c663","9c24416cac033751bda60381c9a57e80f1a597a7","7dd01e5c7ef44d6f7cd4dc2c8bc7c8d5d59c8b62"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Helix-coil transition of alanine peptides in water: force field dependence on the folded and unfolded structures.","doi":"10.1002/prot.20439","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1002/prot.20439","venue":"Proteins"}

Both groups were compared under conditions of quiet standing with eyes open and closed and with hands on and off parallel bars. Individuals with paraplegia were also tested under similar conditions with the ankles of their KAFOs mechanically unlocked and with bilateral functional neuromuscular stimulation of the quadriceps muscles. Sway path, mean amplitude, and mean frequency were measured for each subject. We found that postural stability in paraplegic individuals using KAFOs compared favorably with the control group under conditions of eyes open and closed with hands on parallel bars; however, visual information was much more important for paraplegic individuals during quiet stance. Unlocking the ankles of the KAFOs resulted in an increase in swap path and mean frequency. Functional muscular stimulation of the quadriceps muscles resulted in standing stability slightly less than with KAFOs. Although KAFOs may not be the ideal assistive device for various reasons, postural stability appears reasonable, and other proposed orthoses must be comparable in order to be considered as an alternative.","inCitations":["2cc8afef12a1e06dad0ead8172beff68a8e5e56f","ce4a04c9d5e7efd09e853a7d68ef855da45496b4","7f7373d6ec003c6bbeaea010471220c6a6d12726","381e5ce46b54bfeecb19aa5c31de606472fa532b","97dc85f53da773a7fe8517daa3a717a914b838c0","c1c906087c44922bc2817bfa0eaaa1f6e3b45ea2","7cfead52b46c0605d3213f9c218c34e4c0db8eb3","f4bfd17bce4ec5b92245584bd923d0d2ad59047f","f8e1fbb376dc04f873891484330e0791ae2aef33","2a165c19f23379054a75bda21ddf6238fc111f40","fafad13575f14eaf97d9280dd236f5a83461f8f2","8f8747903901b5e89d4b3c23b5b04d3b42b2d810","77f710a7164f8803d5b9bd58afdbb0f36223700f","36ebfb0461a570a16dc4d0570e60a098005452e9","6d3362674aa6d83dcf903c9dad0c5a52661fd566","2391ef975ec79a30c2bcabeb416d93193a43aa2a","351199e3a38227f718b8506cc62c8a693db76d31","9ef6a6709374375bd3590c518807844eecbe48f6","6e2340831f2396fb15f57de957f6e57027eadbc4","d5dc6534ed34ea0399df129c114f13f81d0a57e9","941503aa15b9c0bdd72cf883ed4f0daa7e5b7090","12a042a9e5813b3d8470ad0713a06ef4b651a82f","c93db0aa150c165a6e27c026cb1fb88e9bf52197","5596d471056d98e3b5d0581c1bf54c5a33b58291"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Standing performance of persons with paraplegia.","doi":"10.1016/0003-9993(86)90113-9","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/0003-9993%2886%2990113-9","venue":"Archives of physical medicine and rehabilitation"}

The plaintiffs’ bar points to this ‘‘other incident evidence’’ because it relieves them of the burden of actually proving their case and invites the jury to speculate that if a product caused injuries to other people, it likely caused injury in the case at bar. This evidence is often presented through adverse event reports (AERs) to the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA). While causation arguments based on AERs have surface appeal to those not versed in FDA’s Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS), those knowledgeable about adverse event reporting understand that AERs are inherently anecdotal and prone to inaccuracy and untrustworthiness. Because of juror susceptibility to arguments based on AERs, it is important to strategize early in the litigation about how you will frame your motion in limine to exclude such evidence. In order to successfully challenge other incident evidence, you must familiarize the court with the issues surrounding adverse event reporting, the inherent weaknesses of information garnered from AERs, and why courts across the country have excluded this evidence.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://www.tuckerellis.com/webfiles/files/Excluding%20Adverse%20Event%20Reports_Sindelar_Bloomberg%20BNA_November%202015.pdf"],"title":"Excluding Adverse Event Reports in Drug and Medical Device Cases","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

The particles had diameters ranging from ca. 50 to >150 nm and bore variable numbers of pear- or club-shaped projections. None had a morphologically distinct organized internal component. The concentration of corona-virus-like particles (CVLP) was highest in embryo intestine and lowest in poult ceca and paralleled infectivity. The CVLP reacted specifically with antibodies in hyperimmune anti-bluecomb turkey serum but not with components of normal turkey serum or antibodies against 4 different coronaviruses. These CVLP appear to be characteristically associated with bluecomb disease and probably represent the infectious agent. Small oblate ellipsoidal particles, 20 X 45 nm, consisting of 2 curved portions fused at their ends were also uniquely associated with bluecomb infection and may represent viral precursors.","inCitations":["1f2c7fab75dd23f071966aef8ec6792e0c02a36f","833bd73ebf313d8f42bbbf79df6057f168ac6808","bfdb58b4e54f43881c55f7502dbd150f9fca1a9d","1bc40b9eb7f22118ca597242d95ce4279a866c24","650bb30aaffafbe67836ea6445544fe525621cae","0d4540f281aac525c0bdd43159fc046f4d3b2ecf","ea182ef3ebbbbfdcdadfa48782b924c3cbfef040","b698a08a4ba6a30f5b71682552ae6843563897d4","9c83b4b5045e3bd6f408323f9002dd8e65b110ff","4b93c331fd0a687021eebb403b3ae9b8534d4817","d6d904b63093343693f2a9e60ac9030052db12fb","5752204c9c18cf3a9f0de504ef68c193aa8a0b6d","9abfdcb53cd664417dca5c4cb930637bfebc8441","d9e5f5b3bed59530cffc9fa586f9d26c25cec606","4cae910228a4e66bd9abaf29743b9388e85a7903","7fc21eb70e94419e547059e09ebafe06a417c1d5","12a4c017444ed8f3bd8e9c3f155b1b7f9089f68a","80781749ccc74cd52a68074dbf25437ad013f94b","f7d5ae91c67530f2b8a49d2ecff533db9e11a23f","efa96aab0c0b2fcfb1a435e11ac030675622936b","028f5e3ef61188373e35d1aaa42a1cca3de2b324","df7181ae8fc0b315eb30851bd9cb6992b5f4dbb0","7ed901a2ae9453542508e4423431a83a7ce329bd","482b1ede5b19cfbcfff238173fbd6c6067a26514","4277c9c7167d22c0e0b55b30dd1b0472b538ffe7","89ef2c6206acf3324d61d73f8684b62aec877186","9f2147813f49e8a03a5780a73c631541894a6eb1","e1dbed7e0d3648f55326f9eb8fabfc3b8f706526","30c100a8493cd37fdcf5f950d65adfeaaad674ea","0c4bba3f512691b7629f7e19e01c11578ebdd046","8c51cb31f1e61aa13c7c107a757a94e40a668b7d","479d99797d1c0a0d3f3e22d0990741121567d21f","5996a179efa2b2e70da6deff0912286457199e73","a20c64d86e24346f67607db93d49722bea44c615","05abd5dc808de7e8fa79c847952addb228546ee6","ad076e326a687f8a7629dda854d0c69baf2340b5","d855678818c911e22a0c5ed583ac5799270357e4","c42665c47ccd3a9d51cd6ff7c9ca2b99afd03eab","7f5dc57a0c198c6765beb9211e8e9c14b4a3bb9e"],"pdfUrls":["https://ipfs.io/ipfs/bafykbzaced4xstofs4tc5q4irede6uzaz3qzcdvcb2eedxgfakzwdyjnxgohq/pdfs/1973%20Electron%20Microscopy%20of%20Coronavirus-Like%20Particles%20Characteristic%20of%20Turkey%20Bluecomb%20Disease.pdf"],"title":"Electron microscopy of coronavirus-like particles characteristic of turkey bluecomb disease.","doi":"10.2307/1589153","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.2307/1589153","venue":"Avian diseases"}

Bei allen kantonalen und 136 staedtischen Polizeistellen erfolgte 1999 eine Erhebung der Ressourcen und Strategien der Verkehrspolizei sowie der 1998 durchgefuehrten Geschwindigkeitskontrollen. Mangels Statistiken wurden die Alkoholkontrollen anhand einer Stichprobe von 3 Kantonen prospektiv im Juni 1999 erfasst. Zusaetzlich wurde eine telefonische Befragung bei 405 Verkehrspolizisten und 773 Schweizer Autofahrerinnen und Autofahrern durchgefuehrt. Die erstmalige gesamtschweizerische Erhebung der Polizeiressourcen und Kontrollaktivitaeten im Bereich Strassenverkehr zeigt, dass in der Schweiz Verkehrskontrollen ziemlich einheitlich durchgefuehrt, zum Teil mit erzieherischen Massnahmen kombiniert, werden und dass die Verkehrssicherheit im Vordergrund steht. Strategisch sind die Kontrollen schwergewichtig auf die Entdeckung von Delikten ausgerichtet. In der Schweiz wurden 1998 mindestens 120 Millionen Fahrzeuge hinsichtlich Geschwindigkeit ueberwacht. Jaehrlich wird etwa jeder hundertste Fahrzeuglenker einer Atemalkoholprobe unterzogen. Die Kontrolldichte ist damit deutlich tiefer als in vielen anderen Laendern. Von den verunfallten Fahrzeuglenkerinnen und -lenkern wurden 54 Prozent getestet. Von den getesteten Personen wiesen 43 Prozent eine Alkoholkonzentration von 0,8 Promille oder mehr auf. Die Befragung der Auto fahrenden Bevoelkerung hat gezeigt, dass der Polizei ein relativ grosser Beitrag zur Reduktion der Verkehrsunfaelle zugetraut wird. Insbesondere das Ausmass der Alkoholfahrten wird massiv ueberschaetzt. Die subjektive Kontrollerwartung hingegen liegt tief. 81 Prozent rechnen selten oder nie damit, in eine Alkoholkontrolle zu geraten. Fuer die Geschwindigkeitskontrollen liegt dieser Wert bei 38 Prozent. Die befragten Polizisten verfuegen ueber mehr Wissen als die AutofahrerInnen und beurteilen die Situation auf den Strassen hinsichtlich Deliktraten und Unfallrisiken realistischer. Die positiven Aspekte der Polizeikontrollen in der Schweiz ueberwiegen. In einigen Bereichen koennten sie aber noch optimiert werden. Im Anhang sind die Frageboegen und die polizeilichen Formulare zur Erhebung der Geschwindigkeitskontrollen und der Atemalkoholkontrollen beigefuegt.

To this end, we describe here the structural makeup of the LOS produced by serogroup B N. meningitidis NMB isogenic phosphoglucomutase (Pgm) mutant (NMB-R6). The dominant LOS types produced by NMB-R6 expressed a deep-truncated inner-core region, GlcNAc-(1-->2)-LDHepII-(1-->3)-LDHepI-(1-->5)-[Kdo-2-->4]-Kdo-->lipid A, with one PEA unit attached at either O-6 or O-7 of LDHepII, or with two simultaneously PEA moieties attached at O-3 and O-6 or O-3 and O-7 of the same unit. Unexpectedly, this mutation did not completely deactivate the production of Glc, as some LOS molecules were observed to carry Glc at O-4 of LDHepI and at O-3 of LDHepII. A glycoconjugate vaccine comprised of NMB-R6 LOSs is currently being evaluated in our laboratory.","inCitations":["571293287b3e0d4fadea76060adca78f82350b19","cba2712b392f24409c5314cd032bd2adb5c4c4de","89c7df02b8fb677869a85e8b19a64264296d29d1","31aa7b847394009bd02d6fa2d83d884003e8d2f5","f6bc57e1d0dd9151916b78ee68e9d91d4314e065","61b49ffc0194cf3ba5eab05170a8013e1df08729","e33793cdbc8fce820965bcb84e8ee97db4110372","8e94f40df188e37c96275a3f6afc956583376a02","6019533d915afc9f304004ddede187d08e9f0e05","27badd570f5fe29d3a2199e36b51bbb1892d517e","7db3f2f3083d93988c18bcb8371cbc5018c87a79","4d7ad25f62eea8c47924ccaa11c17ffc4695f67b"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Phase-variation of the truncated lipo-oligosaccharide of Neisseria meningitidis NMB phosphoglucomutase isogenic mutant NMB-R6.","doi":"10.1016/j.carres.2003.08.014","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.carres.2003.08.014","venue":"Carbohydrate research"}

Using Bruggemann effective medium theory, the effective permittivity of the composite film was determined.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Characterization of doped polymer based layered thin films for metamterial applications","doi":"10.1016/j.phpro.2011.06.180","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.phpro.2011.06.180","venue":""}

The exercises are designed to be just as suitable for performance in the classroom. Principles lay down for the advancement of neurophysiological development. \nThe results exhibit statistically significant improvements across the board, mostly to a high statistical significance, both in terms of reading performance and the behavioural variables. While previous literature suggests that the correlation between the Head Righting Reflex and Reading is prevalent, the present study rather indicates a highly significant correlation (.348) between rhythmic movements and reading. \nThe findings of the study, i.e. of the daily practice of SIMMO, serve as guidance to a full scale implementation of the programme into the regular and systematic schooling procedure.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Daily Motoric Training at School to Improve Reading Skills","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

This study evaluated how modulation of CXCL-8 levels in melanoma cell lines with different tumorigenic and metastatic potentials affected multiple tumor phenotypes. A375P cells (CXCL-8 low expressor) were stably transfected with a CXCL-8 mammalian expression vector to overexpress CXCL-8, whereas A375SM cells (CXCL-8 high expressor) were transfected with a CXCL-8 antisense expression vector to suppress CXCL-8 expression. Subsequent cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and soft-agar colony formation were analyzed, and in vivo tumor growth and metastasis were evaluated using mouse xenograft models. Our data demonstrate that overexpression of CXCL-8 significantly enhanced primary tumor growth and lung metastasis, accompanied by increased microvessel density in vivo, as compared with vector control-transfected cells. We also observed increased clonogenic ability, growth, and invasive potential of CXCL-8 overexpressing cells in vitro. Knockdown of CXCL-8 using an antisense vector resulted in increased cell death and reduced tumor growth relative to control. Taken together, these data confirm that CXCL-8 expression plays a critical role in regulating multiple cellular phenotypes associated with melanoma growth and metastasis.","inCitations":["026b23f9645ef3abcb9fe72c095c06ca9658ab98","e916d98e5d2fdd8e3b8c25c6d5663c6ef26582eb","9577b97250e7797b70830e679fac8edaeea9f037","dc822d0e524f5cb346012c38dde6441aa1f7162c","76ba343df7345bde7b59b6db6659d6b9ef5e8912","181ca163f527c18e85b8cd3a20968fea80161ed0","0181f417e669ca66f66fe5d36fab79e3f52cb22a","7bf7c3ab266e8b8ae4fc3ba6aa5f5bfcab421a35","55612099042219c751c118c694435bf5b0fab7dd","77415f5995b28922191691d1ec983604f2f51e76","42d334513acaf24f1ae8274db1b38e19b6c4d51e","0de9cc123f9003b642f8ae5351eb9af1eb8edd2c","73f48018807f86b24b5bcf9ae118f6bc9d78051e","efdb24ede7c45763cc75363369300390ce05e380","d5c1900fdbfac8491ee8ab094cf6996b952de853","41ed635fc85b7665b1b5143247e1ab0008c09502","31787bd680cb57db16c06032b98fa540de112440","0d26ac5d27faa260f42f86308b388c4698c761ab","6727c1c1e1db0418638729c25be77fa7c07794fe","da512d51a8bd33919c7a7b1f4be341300700f79c","bf91afe23e79b9c33458b94cdbdf00a5bbe84936","a06b4cfa4bed00b4b3246853bb773e2e3c4cb2b9","e8e55c8ae2c231db7aad4568dc3d718f7833711e","c8d874aabe0e81de06e154ad96c80ff46e459e6b","19cf53a3206533d05c24cc300743977fc1191861"],"pdfUrls":["http://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/pmc/05/b5/cam40001-0306.PMC3544458.pdf"],"title":"Modulation of CXCL-8 expression in human melanoma cells regulates tumor growth, angiogenesis, invasion, and metastasis","doi":"10.1002/cam4.28","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1002/cam4.28","venue":"Cancer medicine"}

To that end, a feeding trial was carried out over a 6-wk period. Piglets (equal proportion of males and females) with an initial BW of 8.20 +/- 0.90 kg were randomly subdivided into four groups of 12 pigs each. Two reference groups were fed (as-fed basis) either 0.11% Trp (Trp-deficient) or 0.20% Trp (Trp-adequate) diets. Two other groups had a choice of two diets containing either 0.11 or 0.16% Trp (Trp-choice 1), or 0.11 or 0.20% Trp (Trp-choice 2). Average daily feed intake reached 335 and 366 g in pigs fed Trp-deficient and Trp-choice 1 diets, respectively. For Trp-choice 2 and Trp-adequate diets, a higher (P < 0.05) feed intake of 589 and 645 g/d, respectively, was observed. Piglets on Trp-choice 1 and Trp-choice 2, respectively, selected 87 and 93% of the higher Trp diet. Resulting Trp contents of total diets were 0.15 and 0.19% (as-fed basis) in Trp-choice 1 and Trp-choice 2, respectively. In wk 1, pigs on Trp-choice 2 chose lower proportions of the Trp-deficient feed (31% of total diet) than did pigs on Trp-choice 1 (44%), but at the end of the experiment, pigs of both groups almost exclusively chose the feed with the higher Trp content (96 and 98% for Trp-choice 1 and 2). Pigs on Trp-choice 1 had an ADG of 218 g, which was only slightly above the ADG of Trp-deficient pigs (198 g). Pigs on Trp-choice 2 and Trp-adequate diets had ADG of 404 and 458 g, respectively, which were higher (P < 0.05) than those observed for Trp-deficient and Trp-choice 1 groups. Plasma Trp concentrations in Trp-choice 2 and Trp-adequate groups (9.21 and 9.01 micromol/mL, respectively) were higher (P < 0.05) than in Trp-deficient and Trp-choice 1 groups (5.88 and 4.96 micromol/mL, respectively). Conversely, the sum of essential AA showed a higher (P < 0.05) concentration in plasma from pigs on the Trp-deficient and Trp-choice 1 diets than in plasma from pigs on Trp-choice 2 and Trp-adequate diets. Nutritional depletion of Trp influences the food selection behavior of piglets. Results of growth performance and the dietary preferences suggest that piglets are able to detect Trp-deficiency-induced metabolic changes and respond with an aversion against the Trp-deficient diet.","inCitations":["3f042f3dba3ba8f259956c3265d094b2f4b0472c","a86a98ccb80176da2b854728108af1fffad1a878","8a612e6f9f59ee7f5be78ff3ca953384b4b51bbf","f5e1d5772181eb8e5ca3affe87072d1e3de39534","a0507199a09686898e36810ec64d30127be7abaa","95e63167ef654ef261bff22ecd1da8ff0eb65638","b48832165d3a736b805cb88c5e625ac7ee1936d2","e05a5a4bbecbf4bcd515b49942a3bfbd451cc6d2","25b35d7f0e2787008eb3d232f892d4f3f375278f","31aebe76b267199809fd6c5f444b4f541ad6de35","ed442818a3d2f82bbfabda5005cf33e641039eb5","7b284c89b6c7585a0ecfcb0d6d1c6db7f9f934c1","8c53cd13be2e7d2b7edf1e80562b8e9776e1e84c","6bd2f42346b393aabb95d392777c4521c1dcaa81","3ab6dbffbc5c61a31bd2889ae78a9820e495e4ab","0859bceea08b5a0cd848d95f09da219c0787db59","dd66f11d1c1dc955a5a9bc388e6690b534065338","783929fa0c16b1662e51d3fe231fe29dd1ae4013","ceaf3e45f3509eed179206e520df63a15578fc1c","eac986e5ec110e0e5e3c6c997c8d252632907345","644cc8921f79709b5e3778708055feb0215f6612","89e554c5246ff17b76ee2a685610cd41e10d3df5"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Specific dietary selection for tryptophan by the piglet.","doi":"10.2527/2004.8241115x","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.2527/2004.8241115x","venue":"Journal of animal science"}

Im Zentrum stehen die Bildungsungleichheiten zwischen zwei Migrantengruppen: Aussiedler einerseits und Zugewanderte nicht-deutscher Herkunft, die über andere rechtliche Wege zugewandert sind, andererseits. Aus welchen Gründen erlangen Aussiedlerjugendliche häufiger die Mittlere Reife, während die Vergleichsgruppe mehrheitlich nicht mehr als einen Hauptschulabschluss erreicht? Auf Basis eigener Auswertungen der dritten Welle des DJI-Jugendsurveys aus dem Jahr 2003 wird gezeigt, dass solche Gruppenunterschiede nur teilweise mit den für die Bildungschancen zentralen Einflussfaktoren, wie z. B. den der sozialen Herkunft, zu erklären sind. Der Aussiedlerstatus hat – vermittelt über die spezifischen Einwanderungsregulierungen, Integrationspolitiken und sprachbezogenen Integrationsverläufen dieser Migrantengruppe – einen eigenständigen positiven Effekt auf die Bildungschancen in Deutschland.AbstractThis contribution explores the educational achievements of immigrants who migrated to Germany as minors during the large influx that began in 1987. Differences in education levels between the following two immigrant groups are the analytical focus of this analysis: ethnic German resettlers („ \nAussiedler“) and other first-generation immigrants who used different legal channels to enter German territory. What accounts for the fact that “Aussiedler” youth have higher chances of reaching a medium-level school certificate, whereas the majority of their immigrant peers finish their general education with no more than the low-level “Hauptschul” certificate? Analyses of the third DJI Youth Survey, conducted in 2003, demonstrate that this educational gap between groups can only partially be explained by factors central to educational opportunities, such as their social background. The „Aussiedler“ immigrant status exerts an additional positive impact on educational achievement due to particular immigration and integration policies as well as (mainly linguistic) incorporation processes specific to this immigrant group.RésuméCet article étudie la réussite scolaire d'immigrés arrivés en Allemagne avant leur majorité au cours des grandes vagues d'immigration depuis 1987. L'accent est mis sur les inégalités scolaires entre deux groupes d'immigrés: les „Aussiedler” (immigrés d'Europe de l'Est et de Russie de souche allemande), d'une part, et les immigrés d'origine non-allemande venus en vertu d'autres mécanismes juridiques, d'autre part. Pour quelles raisons les jeunes „Aussiedler” obtiennent-ils plus souvent la „Mittere Reife” (diplôme comparable au BEP), tandis que la majorité de l'autre groupe étudié ne va pas au-delà du „Hauptschulabschluss” (diplôme comparable au CAP)? Sur la base de notre propre analyse de la troisième vague de l'enquête sur la jeunesse du DJI (Institut allemand de recherche sur la jeunesse) de l'année 2003, nous montrons que les principaux facteurs influençant les chances de réussite scolaire, comme p. ex. l'origine sociale, n'expliquent que partiellement de telles différences entre groupes. Le statut d'„Aussiedler“ a – par le biais de régulations de l'immigration, de politiques d'intégration et de parcours d'intégration basés sur la langue spécifiques à ce groupe d'immigrés – un effet propre positif sur les chances de réussite scolaire en Allemagne.","inCitations":["559c6527e83d93e648fb6740a0be3fe1591f2752","7ecc6acadb17e9438d1c4166be0e268015b8ab43"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Bildungsunterschiede zwischen Migrantengruppen in Deutschland: Schulabschlüsse von Aussiedlern und anderen Migranten der ersten Generation im Vergleich*","doi":"10.1007/s11609-008-0028-1","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11609-008-0028-1","venue":""}

This article will separate those myths from the facts. The facts are as follows. During pre-state days, women formed about 15% of the armed movements that opposed the British. When the War of Independence broke out, however, women were taken out of combat units. They were never allowed to return; instead, as in other armed forces, they filled `traditional' slots. The expansion of women's role in the military, which took place during the late 1970s, was the result of the Israel Defence Force's (IDF) desperate quest for manpower. This expansion of women's roles coincided with the incipient decline of the Israeli Army as a fighting force. As first the Lebanese adventure and then the need to put down the Palestinian Intifada accelerated that decline during the eighties, more women entered the IDF; the more women entered the IDF, the more its prestige declined.

of IgE and type 2 cytokines, and tissue and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) eosinophilia. It has seen an increased prevalence in recent decades. Such a rapid increase suggests a significant role for environmental factors. A candidate among these environmental factors is, paradoxically, the decreased prevelance of infectious diseases in westernized nations, a decrease achieved by vigorous vaccination programs. Several investigators have observed an inverse correlation between atopic diseases, such as asthma, and exposure to intracellular pathogens, namely mycobacteria. In attempts to further link these two phenomena, investigators have begun administering immune modulators, including BCG, an attenuated strain of M. bovis, to mice in antigen (ovalbumin, Ova)-induced asthma models. Data in these models have been mixed, with conflicting IgE responses and scant information on the effects on pulmonary functions. Another type 1 cytokineinducing immune modulator, Flt3-ligand (FL) has yet to be tested for its theoretical potential for attenuating asthma in an animal model. Therefore, I designed a series of experiments to more completely characterize the role of the immune modulators, BCG, Mycobacterium vaccae and FL, in a mouse model of asthma. Mycobacteria were administered to mice either prior to or following sensitization with Ova. while FL was administered prior to Ova sensitization. These protocols were followed by comprehensive assessment of the hallmark features of asthma, which included assessment of pulmonary function, measurement of BAL eosinophilia, serum total and antigen-specific IgE antibodies and serum and BAL cytokines. While M. vaccae was partially successful in attenuating these features, BCG was consistently shown to attenuate the LAR, AHR and BAL eosinophilia. FL was also able to attenuate these outcomes. None of the treatments had any effect on the EAR. Furthermore, BCG was able to maintain suppression of the LAR (with suppression of the EAR) together with the suppression of the growth factor TGF-[3 and the chemokine eotaxin in a mouse model of chronic asthma. However, BCG was ineffective in preventing airway remodeling, as measured by thickness of airway and tracheal collagen and airway epithelium. These results suggest that BCG and FL are potential candidates for clinical application as immune modulators in suppressing or preventing allergic asthma.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://dspace2.creighton.edu/xmlui/bitstream/handle/10504/66703/Hopfenspirger-PhD-2003.pdf;sequence=1"],"title":"Mycobacterial Antigens and Immunomodulation in Allergic Asthma","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

An understanding of the normal events in the embryonic development of the face facilitates the study of oro-facial and also cranio-facial anomalies. Embryological studies have revealed that the neural crest plays a major role in normal development of the face. The deficient formation, migration and proliferation in the neural crest cells and their derivatives around the cephalic region may be involved in defects of these structures. Observations of normal and abnormal human embryos are basically important, and a newly developed manipulation technique of cultured animal embryos and fetuses may provide us an effective information on the teratogenesis. In addition to the facial cleft, a special attention has been paid to the 1st and 2nd branchial syndromes. Associated anomalies with oro-facial defects, especially those of midline structure including the brain may provide us the knowledge on tissue interaction in the morphogenesis and on therapeutic consideration. Since a higher frequency of cleft lip and palate among Japanese infants was reported, epidemiological data have to be analysed to search etiological factors, i.e., genetic and environmental factors.

One of the most commonly diagnosed imported infections in returning travelers is malaria. Increasing age is strongly and independently associated with increasing morbidity and mortality from malaria. Delayed diagnosis leads to higher risks of poor clinical outcomes in older patients presenting with malaria. The objective of this study was to quantify malaria presentations in older patients as a percentage of total malaria presentations, compare length of hospital stay (LOS) between the older and younger cohort, and to describe medical co-morbidities, length of time to diagnosis and factors contributing to delayed diagnosis and increased LOS in the older cohort.MethodsA retrospective cohort study was undertaken in two university hospitals of all patients aged 65 years or older presenting with malaria from 2002–2012. A national hospital inpatient database was used to identify patients of all ages with a discharge diagnosis of malaria over this ten year period, and quantify LOS in those aged <65 and those aged 65 years or older. The case-notes for all of the older cohort were reviewed.ResultsThere were a total of 203 cases, 12 of whom were aged ≥65 years (5.9 %- total). Median time to diagnosis in this older group was two days (range 0–35), median LOS was eight days (range 1–77), compared to a median LOS of three days in those aged <65 years. All patients aged ≥65 years presented with fever. Travel history was documented in only 6/12 charts, and 11/12 had two or more co-morbid illnesses. Six of the 12 patients were not diagnosed or treated within 48 h of presentation.ConclusionsThis case series highlights the need for appropriate history-taking and timely diagnosis of the older traveler returning with fever, as delayed diagnosis and treatment can contribute to prolonged hospital stay and increased morbidity. With increasing numbers of older travelers, physicians must remain vigilant to the presence of imported illnesses, particularly malaria, in older patients with unexplained fever.","inCitations":["735f57e2adef6c05f119e70a205f5f74730bd3fe","092a3faa988b30aa1216a6c7abdcec9c0e3964e5","4953e9fa1aff5797dcb75c8fad742bd41ea690d3","fe93954c0964fcd10b99e821c11df4e317e8794c"],"pdfUrls":["https://tdtmvjournal.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s40794-016-0018-9?site=tdtmvjournal.biomedcentral.com"],"title":"Malaria in the returning older traveler","doi":"10.1186/s40794-016-0018-9","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s40794-016-0018-9","venue":"Tropical Diseases, Travel Medicine and Vaccines"}
