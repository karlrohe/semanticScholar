Generally, outage planning is intensively performed in spring and autumn during which the power demand is lower. However, electric power companies are increasingly installing facilities because of increased power demand and the complexity of the power system. Therefore outage planning must be carried out with greater efficiency. Outage planning is typically instigated by an expert in power system operation, and time and labor is required to generate a plan that considers operation constraints since this is a large combinatorial problem. Hence, this paper develops a new smart automated outage planning method. The method proposed in this paper using MOGA can generate outage plans efficiently and can reduce the experts' burdens. Furthermore, the proposed method can consider trade-off relations, such as that between costs and CO2 emissions, and optimize them. To confirm the validity of the proposed method, simulations were conducted using the IEEJ EAST 10-machine-O/V system model.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1109/ASSCC.2012.6523274"],"title":"Outage planning method for electrical power facilities using MOGA","doi":"10.1109/ASSCC.2012.6523274","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASSCC.2012.6523274","venue":"2012 10th International Power & Energy Conference (IPEC)"}

Although parenteral nutrition (PN) is an accepted practice and a potentially life-saving therapy for pediatric patients who cannot be fed through their gastrointestinal tract, it is associated with the risk of serious metabolic, mechanical, and infectious complications. Candidates for PN should be selected according to well-defined indications, with initial nutritional assessment and with careful attention given to fluid, electrolyte, vitamin, trace element, and caloric requirements. Total calories should be administered so that the nonprotein-calorie to gram-nitrogen ratio is in the range of 150 to 250:1. Although short-term supplemental nutritional support can be administered through a peripheral vein, long-term total PN is best delivered by central venous access. PN should be initiated and monitored in accordance with well-established protocols. The lowest complication rate and highest cost-effectiveness are achieved by an interdisciplinary team that includes one or more nurses, dietitians, pharmacists, and physicians. The development of safe, reliable, and miniaturized intravenous pumps with built-in monitors has made home parenteral nutrition possible and desirable in selected patients.","inCitations":["2eca50f092df9c4d2ebc0a7c572744024466d6ff","c6b334bb88a49fddba51ea37d0d6f9628b7a97b4","7c82549c7a5d31f0d56a7f50b082fd1d80b5aaf0","5f83b77f6ab4a36cd0d9dd85d12fa777f592074e","8fc9c668a4e9ad90079eea108ac9c15a0ad4542c"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Intravenous nutrition for the pediatric patient.","doi":"","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"Seminars in pediatric surgery"}

All of them were scanned with resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) at baseline, and 15 patients were rescanned after two-week rTMS. The amplitude of low frequency fluctuation (ALFF) and functional connection degree (FCD), based on voxels and 3 brain networks (default mode network [DMN], central executive network [CEN], salience network[SN]),were used as imaging indicators to analyze. The correlations of brain imaging changes after rTMS with clinical efficacy were calculated.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAt baseline, patients groups showed increased ALFF in the right orbital frontal cortex (OFC) and decreased ALFF in the left striatal cortex and medial prefrontal cortex (PFC), while increased FCD in the right dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and OFC and decreased FCD in the right inferior parietal lobe and in the CEN. After rTMS, patients showed increased ALFF in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC)and superior frontal gyrus, FCD in the right dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, superior temporal gyrus and CEN, as well as decreased FCD in the bilateral lingual gyrus than pre-rTMS . These rTMS induced neuroimaging changes did not significantly correlated with clinical effecacy.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThis study indicated that rTMS resulted in changes of ALFF and FCD in some brain regions and CEN.

These are the Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome and alcoholic dementia. \n \n \n \nThere is little doubt that thiamine deficiency is the factor responsible for Wernicke's encephalopathy. However, additional factors might play a role in the development of Korsakoffs psychosis. Many cases of Wernicke's encephalopathy are undiagnosed by clinicians whose awareness of the various manifestations of this disease needs to be increased. Thiamine deficiency may lead to brain damage by blocking the oxidative metabolism of glucose, amino acids and fatty acids. There is no definite evidence that marginal thiamine deficiency causes disease. Certain individuals may be especially prone to the effects of thiamine deficiency for genetic reasons. \n \n \n \nThere is clearly a spectrum of mental impairment in alcoholics which cannot be attributed to thiamine deficiency. Some of these abnormalities correlate with the neuroradiological and pathological signs of cerebral atrophy. Mental impairment and atrophy in alcoholics are partly reversible with abstinence.

The rocket instrumentation included a Faraday rotation experiment, uniquely adapted for measuring electrons at low latitude, and fixed-bias Langmuir probes. The ALTAIR tracking radar was configured in an incoherent scatter mode. For the 75–92 km region, we note very good agreement between Faraday rotation and radar electron density measurements. Langmuir probe current measurements, calibrated to the Faraday rotation data, provided information about fine-scale electron density vertical structure and extended the rocket-radar comparisons of electron density to 130 km. Good overall agreement was also observed at higher altitudes, with evidence of electron density layering - including sporadic E - detected by both measurement techniques. The outcomes from our study support this unique Faraday rotation approach and the IS radar for measuring electron density in the equatorial lower ionosphere.","inCitations":["df7e84a0f98297f36125de04fd19ac4224395452","7ba52230f90ee5f971a4d82ed6e2bfa69ea3904f","a9576303eae1736cd7da3aa520118955e205ac27","cc334695a72d30dd7144e1b5058ea3e82ca8eaf5","f0a66439620f58d8e04571931ba9f749437d4c90","faf325b10d1508027eb3a437648d3916d0d7d677","a10e24350ef784b075d050c3374ae17fbd05af90","f5c03b5cbefd9ea5dd7bb8b87167e31946028333","7a613003f330a58bd8a18a75448c33c88617e95b","f4e72cf1b7f5633a45953216bdb161c276ec3227","feb931c86e5d586511e434601b6394d917ec793c"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Rocket and incoherent scatter radar common‐volume electron measurements of the equatorial lower ionosphere","doi":"10.1029/2005GL024622","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1029/2005GL024622","venue":""}

Exogenous surfactant and corticosteroid administration have had a major impact in improving survival and morbidity in this disease with consequent alterations in the clinical and radiographic course. Chronic lung disease, although still common, is usually less severe than previously, especially in larger infants. Significant therapeutic strides in treating persistent pulmonary hypertension with or without meconium aspiration have been the use of high-frequency ventilators, inhaled nitric oxide, and ECMO. Prompt recognition and treatment of infection, atelectasis, and air leak whether primary or secondary are important to overall outcome. Less common pulmonary conditions, such as lymphangiectasia, pulmonary hypoplasia, and alveolar proteinosis, may initially masquerade as more common lesions. Persistent pulmonary hypertension is often the initial diagnosis and part of the clinical problem. Attention must be paid to the clinical and radiographic appearance and excursion of the thoracic cage because deformities and malformations may be the cause of respiratory problems.","inCitations":["9b5e48170bf369fcfe420dfb5936c9635fcc986e","ba4747ca62a0ba14d2e0cf3c550ef6ec987cb526","15249f5b4abae67fd70143ad5a7fd854afe312b1","1d9aadc8d6ae4e01ab09f537aa70f060fe2d0765","5dff65503b7d206e1ea9b77370cdc4e85b49c712","3cc19747d9485ee3fc89b036246078a5abef7a58","9c6a86049df6eedc0097344735cb04224c4c194d","eab8c25af5d357a1ec7d3d5b47429154f7fc1fea","00341ecd1f8309c2aed66c7034ce1938d28048cd","6b7e0a7a7ecee0b2c893fb5bcc5145a1bd7a7c0f"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Imaging of medical disease of the newborn lung.","doi":"10.1016/S0033-8389(05)70248-7","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/S0033-8389%2805%2970248-7","venue":"Radiologic clinics of North America"}

The ac photovoltage is picked up with electrodes through a condensor formed by the spacer. The photovoltage signal modulates brightness of another cathode ray tube to form a scanning image. Mean wavelength and chopping frequency of the photon beam are 507 nm and 2 kHz. Scanning image analysis is done using photocurrent density equations based on a step-like junction model.

This setting allows for the study of time-limited perceptual grouping processes in the human visual system that are applicable to line drawings. Previous work (Wilder, Dickinson, Jepson, & Walther, 2018) showed that standard local features of individual contours, or junctions between contours, do not account for this rapid classification ability but, rather, the relative placement of these contours appeared to be important. Here we provide strong support for this observation by demonstrating that local ribbon symmetry between neighboring pairs of contours facilitates the categorization of complex real-world environments. To this end, we introduce a novel computational approach, based on the medial axis transform, for measuring the degree of local ribbon symmetry in a line drawing. We use this measure to separate the contour pixels for a given scene into the most ribbon symmetric half and the least ribbon symmetric half. We then show human observers the resulting half-images in a rapid-categorization experiment. Our results demonstrate that local ribbon symmetry facilitates the categorization of complex real-world environments. This is the first study of the role of local symmetry in inter-contour grouping for human scene classification. We conclude that local ribbon symmetry appears to play an important role in jump-starting the grouping of image content into meaningful units, even in flashed presentations.","inCitations":["38fd412b81fabc0dc255bccd0e7d211e266149c1","b32d735f0807bb92da06c3a2669c69bc525ce0ea","90c68e8356d07449fbb77ce0b996cf8a0799a86f","9221a5bd76be5e506877cd56b7d81b6d5ae6a1df","9c6e8acd8db5a2fe0ff0711e54212a2152538ab7"],"pdfUrls":["https://bwlab.utoronto.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/1-s2.0-S0010027718302506-main.pdf","http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~sven/Papers/Cognition2019.pdf","https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0010027718302506","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027718302506?dgcid=api_sd_search-api-endpoint"],"title":"Local contour symmetry facilitates scene categorization","doi":"10.1016/j.cognition.2018.09.014","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cognition.2018.09.014","venue":"Cognition"}

Several studies have described the occurrence, turnover, activity and function of subseafloor prokaryotes; however, subsurface eukaryotic communities still remain largely underexplored. Ribosomal RNA surveys of superficial and near-surface marine sediments have revealed an unexpected diversity of active eukaryotic communities, but knowledge of the diversity of deep subseafloor microeukaryotes is still scarce. Here, we investigated the vertical distribution of DNA and RNA fungal signatures within subseafloor sediments of the Canterbury basin (New Zealand) by 454 pyrotag sequencing of fungal genetic markers. Different shifts between the fungal classes of Tremellomycetes, Sordariomycetes, Eurotiomycetes, Saccharomycetes, Wallemiomycetes, Dothideomycetes, Exobasidiomycetes and Microbotryomycetes were observed. These data provide direct evidence that fungal communities occur at record depths in deep sediments of the Canterbury basin and extend the depth limit of fungal presence and activity, respectively 1740 and 346 mbsf. As most of the fungal sequences retrieved have a cosmopolitan distribution, it indicates that fungi are able to adapt to the deep subseafloor conditions at record-depth and must play important ecological roles in biogeochemical cycles.","inCitations":["31b1f794958ebe8594333a7c87527c91a48084d2","8e4859b6c93d726326f5b527be5448ec49cb9260","7ba1fb8557d94ad1be21cc451bac4b873609bd8a","7abecb95f6816aa0f45fb230cba200c523e03f1b","73a69249d696da7df6acd837b52ca1004edaefde","c5eefbe1ccbbeaef4afbdadedc59184e2413e647","e4c63596424cad0be1135e40416c8ee4a5081b46","bb65e037b7c48f53345c1cb4295d6851d7a3790d","afc262f2dfcead867e35e543c0119a90c5d984aa","6e6c92a84f30168c57aa5170c75b62b34451eb00","3a59b78a87681a68e68bb1630fbeb75d8ca664ea","77b85dde6477ae201d2a806d5524290db070fd12","fe1620cf839c661c6052af4c18188485489c6961","39933c9eefe5a723efb1c619937edf55f40fe291","a913b55872e3864423f12ca4744d5c4286862452"],"pdfUrls":["http://archimer.ifremer.fr/doc/00247/35810/34418.pdf","https://watermark.silverchair.com/90-3-908.pdf?token=AQECAHi208BE49Ooan9kkhW_Ercy7Dm3ZL_9Cf3qfKAc485ysgAAAkgwggJEBgkqhkiG9w0BBwagggI1MIICMQIBADCCAioGCSqGSIb3DQEHATAeBglghkgBZQMEAS4wEQQM4w4pRbNJ0ecT6o48AgEQgIIB-0RN6zu6vtDpqxxRE_XZSFtCX13jNknzG7AtehF3cSP5GxT9I24mumG7lKahC-dxNQNE5vckFIHCZwvN689AFuem8uerfhsGb5w30x3S70alcHQxWLqPNdaaH6WCVl1iTaiaCG33L_lpPEPBIoYqQYo9q9EAKR99n-OzvekENOYat0XLNNs77EJOhH2ZyteVyEA22wf0vFrhIEQH_dBnedbTVn0PlmJOHzkNcppka8enj3bo_SeK_p0TxL7kZKNKPjipD0qHf57ElZT3HGH46j6rYlFCR9b9BnjW2rxjqB3DP4L_HtSyBFu03dVVOd1JW0A6TaCmGebqBKOByGh6B6TJ1ah4K9LpJvhHEqj7wEWe4Nv4-9JQUKyYsofC_VKK5S5RG46y9HkQUSuw_vbCRCFj3Gz1XtSs0C5kFFotWUN2411XXwv9961lToKI80dtmD8GgWfW3wWWO8gvULcah91nbSZH9E11TUg8Afhcrz-ersDdZXfVY0AxFOUAiJRLAaFknTORky42rRkZNMmwQUZMwlBsCJBeTq6szjETxIasFG6AU5dPmZBO-p_sNoQk5zE7-pC5ynW7tZODEC9g2WBhFFtO25AEkeTp5PO1LE7uXpi3ATlflf_BeDcejocIg2vJzId0VNAAxVRKwX4UoeyHIaBQ2jscFaf9Zg"],"title":"In-depth analyses of deep subsurface sediments using 454-pyrosequencing reveals a reservoir of buried fungal communities at record-breaking depths.","doi":"10.1111/1574-6941.12447","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1111/1574-6941.12447","venue":"FEMS microbiology ecology"}

Self-care is essential to help patients in maintaining fluid balances, enhancing compliance with treatment regimens, and managing psychological problems resulting from HD. Therapeutic patient education (TPE) programs represent an effective nursing intervention to improve patient self-care. Methods: This is a case report analyzing effects of TPE on self-care in a patient lacking self-care and undergoing HD. The TPE program consisted of five sessions: assessment, motivation, awareness, education and training, and evaluation. The self-care agency scale (SCAS) was used for patient assessment, and program materials were adjusted according to patient needs identified during assessment. Evaluation focused on improving patient knowledge, SCAS score, and interdialytic weight gain (IDWG). Results: The TPE program increased the patient’s SCAS score by 26%, an IDWG score improvement within the desired limit of 3%–5% of his dry weight was observed, and he was more knowledgeable about each education topic. Conclusion: TPE is an effective method for increasing the self-care of patients undergoing HD. Our findings suggest that nurses should use TPE programs to improve self-care, enhance treatment compliance, and improve psychosocial well-being among end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients undergoing HD. Quasi-experimental studies to explore effects of TPE programs on self-care among ESRD patients undergoing HD are required.

Only one major aspect of the educational process has not been put through lengthy reappraisal, the books used in teaching. A scientific appraisal of the principles of the artistic design and illustration of textbooks is the object of this study. What is the science of book design? How can more effective textbooks be developed? Can we chart a new program of book design? Can we develop a scientific theory to guide us in designing books that will also give us insight into the fundamental nature of reading and writing? Or, are books on the way out as teaching devices, to be replaced by mechanical gadgets, tape recorders, and television sets? These are the beginning questions of the science of book design which we can attempt to deal with in the future. The theory of book design is a part of the theory of verbal learning.

Untuk selalu dapat dipercaya oleh masyarakat radio ini selalu harus \nmemberikan program yang menarik untuk masyarakat, maka dari itu Radio ini \nmemerlukan strategi promosi yang kreatif demi kelancaran menjaga kepercayaan \ndi dalam diri masyarakat. \nDilakukan sebuah promosi yang kreatif, tidak lain adalah untuk \nmengembangkan keistimewaan antara Radio Pop 91,5 FM Purwodadi dengan \npendengarnya. Hal ini sangatlah membantu dalam menghadapi persaingan di era \nyang semakin banyak perubahan dan selera masyarakat yang berbeda-beda. Radio \nini dinikmati oleh mayarakat dari kelas bawah sampai kelas atas tanpa \nmemandang kelas sosialnya, karena program yang disajikan adalah mengikuti \nselera masyarakat sekarang dan tren pada saat ini. Menu program yang ada adalah \ndari program anak-anak sampai orang tua yang telah di jadwal siaranya sesuai jam \nyang cocok dari masing-masing umur, selain itu Radio Pop 91,5 FM Purwodadi \njuga memiliki kegiatan-kegiatan yang tidak kalah serunya yaitu dengan \nmengadakan event-event seperti takjil di bulan Ramadhan, lomba-lomba untuk \nperingatan hari kemerdekaan RI, acara perempuan, band Pop FM dan masih \nbanyak lagi. Dan untuk mendukung suksesnya promosi Desain Komunikasi \nVisual adalah media yang sesuai sebagai perangkat promosi dimana media ini \nberperan merancang dan mewujudkan ide visual yang menarik. Keberadaan \nDesain Komunikasi Visual ini sangatlah dibutuhkan dalam mempromosikan \nRadio Pop 91,5 FM Purwodadi, dimana Radio Pop 91,5 FM Purwodadi ini belum \nmemiliki desain visual yang sesuai dengan konsep siaran. Maka dari itu Radio ini \nperlu adanya media promosi yang berhubungan langsung dengan konsep yang \ndimiliki agar tercipta keselarasan dalam kegiatan promosi. Radio Pop 91,5 FM \nPurwodadi hanya mengandalkan promosi lewat Radio itu sendiri dan bekerja \nsama dengan beberapa event organizer dalam hal penjualan tiket pertunjukan \nyang diadakan (ticket box). Media promosi yang dilakukan Radio ini sangatlah \nkurang sekali kalau hanya sekedar mengandalkan itu, padahal di zaman sekarang \npersaingan makin banyak dan makin berat. \nPersaingan yang menumbuhkan semangatnya berkarya untuk dapat maju \nagar tidak tertinggal oleh bergantinya zaman, sangatlah dibutuhkan dalam \nmenampilkan program pilihan dan telah teruji keunggulanya. Radio ini memiliki \ntujuan agar semua pendengar tidak menyamakan dengan gelombang radio lain \nsehingga pendengar bisa langsung tahu kalau yang sedang didengarkanya adalah \nRadio Pop 91,5 FM Purwodadi. \nPara anak muda yang gemar mengikuti perkembangan musik serta takut \nketinggalan informasi terbaru maka Radio Pop 91,5 FM Purwodadi adalah pilihan \nyang cocok untuk didengarkan karena musik dan informasi yang disajikan selalu \nup to date. Karena Radio ini sebisa mungkin menghadirkan program-program \n \nxi \nyang menarik yang spesial untuk para pendengar setia Radio Pop 91,5 FM \nPurwodadi.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Perancangan Promosi Dan Periklananradio Pop 91,5 Fm Purwodadi Melalui Media Desain Komunikasi Visual","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Currently available cough detectors are uncomfortable and expensive at a time when generic smartphones can perform this task. However, two major challenges preclude smartphone-based cough detectors from effective deployment namely, the need to deal with noisy environments and computational cost. This paper focuses on the latter, since complex machine learning algorithms are too slow for real-time use and kill the battery in a few hours unless specific actions are taken. In this paper, we present a robust and efficient implementation of a smartphone-based cough detector. The audio signal acquired from the device's microphone is processed by computing local Hu moments as a robust feature set in the presence of background noise. We previously demonstrated that pairing Hu moments and a standard k-NN classifier achieved accurate cough detection at the expense of computation time. To speed-up k-NN search, many tree structures have been proposed. Our cough detector uses an improved vantage point (vp)-tree with optimized construction methods and a distance function that results in faster searches. We achieve 18× speed-up over classic vp-trees, and 560× over standard implementations of k-NN in state-of-the-art machine learning libraries, with classification accuracies over 93%, enabling real-time performance on low-end smartphones.","inCitations":["6d73f51b5c23117816faabd06b7bd4635a1cd63f","518a40e365def9251a96c6a1121efa361f35e4f6","80215ff44618f5c64e77d989e343b285d5565c28"],"pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1109/JBHI.2017.2768162"],"title":"Efficient k-NN Implementation for Real-Time Detection of Cough Events in Smartphones","doi":"10.1109/JBHI.2017.2768162","sources":["Medline","DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JBHI.2017.2768162","venue":"IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics"}

The techniques are based on speed expressions obtained from the induction motor dynamic equations. Two of the equations obtained have singularities, and hence direct speed estimation from these is not possible. The paper proposes a scheme using two ANNs to recover the speed from these two equations. However, it is possible to combine these two equations in a way that removes the singularities. Another method, based on this equation, is presented for obtaining the speed directly from the output of an ANN. These methods are general and easily implementable using commercially available ANN devices.","inCitations":["d9d3944417a6e5a6ed2c0375864df84c76398f11","0a68876a644d88d0b9cae132c9f45a1d17cd9fa4","1fce330626c53be02044a6268c93ec289c74e22b","ae13d3dc257538aafe1dcbc57b6734d6e64e1331","ed7a04b197ce796e99823e11cde0197c9a3a9b0a","1407a85030f0a120d147c871c850280d45a728f6"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Speed estimation of induction motor using artificial neural networks","doi":"10.1109/IECON.1996.565994","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IECON.1996.565994","venue":"Proceedings of the 1996 IEEE IECON. 22nd International Conference on Industrial Electronics, Control, and Instrumentation"}

The authors extend the literature by incorporating search unemployment and they explicitly model the occupational choice of individuals to become workers or entrepreneurs. Their analysis shows that, in the market equilibrium, the level of advice VCs offer is inefficiently low compared with the social optimum. Furthermore, the number of vacancies, the level of employment, and the number of potential entrepreneurs are generally either too low or too high relative to their socially optimal level. Policy to achieve the social optimum consists of a capital gains subsidy, an employment tax or subsidy, and an investment tax or subsidy.","inCitations":["bc4fc76d87ba49c1c89104b4dda0cb4b3a32263b","4251a49e3414e068804e97f16a56795ce3e1456c","8aaddd2e71dc6477876814be12a02ea8b8890ef6","2660e3b83c1005d0a7980c6c4145ad43fa545e14","844a11672689cf31a5cdd3571009249fa08f1110","15a922b4863ef7eb854ca4db173f193a8aef7a39","7faa6106d7f57cf7d622dd66ae9d00ca963a8e6c","b37d2c74c4a7d2367acae7081bbfac9ab1f35ce5","74a77e11cee955e61a589d311c61cef7908f88dc"],"pdfUrls":["https://www.bankofcanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/wp05-24.pdf"],"title":"A search model of venture capital, entrepreneurship, and unemployment","doi":"10.2139/ssrn.744105","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.744105","venue":""}

As pathophysiology lies in placenta most attention is drawn on placenta. In recent years it acts as valuable indicator for maternal and fetal diseases. Objectives: The objective of study was to assess the morphological changes of placenta and to correlate the findings with severity of disease and with fetal outcome. Materials and Methods: Total of 400 placentae of which 200 placentae from cases of pre-eclampsia (PE) (100-mild, 100-severe) and 200 placentae from normal cases were studied in labor room Vijayanagara Institute Medical Sciences, Bellary. The morphometric parameters of placenta like weight, volume, thickness, diameter, shape, number of cotyledons were recorded. Gross features like infarctions, calcifications, retro placental (RP) hematoma were noted and fetal parameters like fetal weight and Apgar score at 1st and 5th min recorded. Results: There was a significant correlation between placental weight and weight of baby and neonatal intensive care unit admission P < 0.001. Placental morphometric features like mean weight, volume, thickness, diameter, number of cotyledons values were significantly less in severe PE group compared to mild PE group with P < 0.001 and compared to control group all parameters are significantly less in study group (P < 0.001). There was significant correlation between infarction and fetal birth weight (P < 0.001). There were 5 still births 4 in severe PE and 1 in mild PE. The placentae of this still birth were having calcifications, infarctions and RP clots. Mean fetoplacental (F/P) ratio was higher in study group compared to control group (P < 0.001). Conclusion: In present study the placental morphometric features like placental weight, volume, diameter, thickness were low with increasing grades of hypertension compared to control group. There was an increased F/P weight ratio in the hypertensive group. The study of morphological changes of placenta in cases of PE may help us to plan the treatment plan for better outcome of mother and newborn.

Edge turbulence becomes increasingly intermittent as the edge density gradient increases. Beyond a critical limit in the edge density gradient, the transport is dominated by short, repetitive bursts of particles and energy outward toward the wall. These bursts are extremely ballooning in character, strongly localized on the large major radius side of the torus. The duration of a burst is given by the ballooning mode growth time t0=(RLn)1∕2∕cs, where cs is the sound speed, R is the major radius of the torus, and Ln is the density gradient scale length. The bursts are coherent in structure with a poloidal scale size L0 that is proportional to the square root of the plasma resistivity η. With further increases in the edge density gradient, the fluxes of energy and particles in the bursts become much larger in magnitude.

This effect was predominant in kidneys from rabbits pretreated with LPS. Endothelin-1 at a concentration of 10(-10) M and big endothelin-1 at a concentration of 10(-8) M produced equal vasoconstrictor effects in kidney. Addition of endotheHn converting enzyme inhibitor, phosphoramidon, to the perfusion medium at a concentration of 10(-6) M caused a reduction in the effects of both LPS and big ET-1 without altering the vasoconstrictor effect of ETol. However, addition of methylene blue (10(-5) M), a soluble guanylate cyclase inhibitor and N(G)-nitro-L-arginine-methyl ester (10(-6) M) to the perfusion medium caused a potentiation in the vasoconstrictor effect of LPS. Indomethacin at a concentration of 10(-6) M did not alter the effect of LPS.

Use of a cDNA probe which encodes the beta-NGF mRNA demonstrated that L cells produce a transcript identical in size to that of the submaxillary gland. Moreover, target sites of restriction enzymes EcoRI, PstI and BamHI were not significantly rearranged in the beta-NGF gene locus of these cells. The abundance of the beta-NGF transcript was found to depend on culture conditions. Removal of serum depressed the cellular content of polyadenylated RNA by a factor of 1.7, and decreased specifically the pool of beta-NGF transcript by an additional factor of 4. The presence of 10(-7) M testosterone in the serum-free medium did not modify the level of beta-NGF mRNA, while addition of 10(-7) M T3 (or T4) increased this level by a factor of 1.5. These data provide the first evidence that the beta-NGF mRNA of L cells is subjected to regulation, but in a way apparently different from that described for the submaxillary gland.","inCitations":["2ff5cea812b46a53e75a0e54a428de0005a379ad","0055381e4d450858c5575b393535cb071c225528","b3e63668cfba002e8881b75aa7461cda6a537090","781e7c469351cb00a1dad61ae44a5d4d8a2c5f3c","074bf31f919d83bf895ea2bd76022fffae06572a","6e9a4e7f7e0aff741f141a8cc23913001f1089c5","12cc9819a2988b5a07422a11f964dd73074f3548","1640ee45e5e25097c0c1ae8034bf728e7d6e49f0","025f81a7d7edca6c0a965353ffbfb3ecebf3fce8","fcf9793e8bb1520df587afd0cd900dcc9b8d90c5"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Serum and thyroid hormones T3 and T4 regulate nerve growth factor mRNA levels in mouse L cells.","doi":"10.1016/0014-5793(85)80837-1","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/0014-5793%2885%2980837-1","venue":"FEBS letters"}

The order of potency was: d -and dl -propranolol > quinidine, dl -pronethalol and lidocaine > diphenylhydantoin > procainamide > dl -practolol. Bretylium showed only slight activity. From the dose-effect curves obtained, the concentrations which prolonged the refractory period by 20% (RPP 20 ) were derived. By strict adherence to the doses derived from the RPP 20 potency ratios the heart rate of aconitine-induced tachycardia in the cat Langendorff preparation was returned to preaconitine heart rate levels after addition of the five substances studied ( dl -propranolol, lidocaine, procainamide, quinidine and practolol). Thus, there appears to be a relationship between the ability of a substance to prolong the refractory period of cat papillary muscle and its ability to reverse the tachycardia produced by aconitine in the cat Langendorff preparation. In addition, we observed that aconitine-induce automaticity and tachycardia could be reversed by substituting perfusate containing half the normal concentration of sodium or by the addition of tetrodotoxin (0.1-1 µg/ml).

The inclusive fitness of an individual is defined as the sum of all the effects this individual has on itself and others, with each term multiplied by a relatedness coefficient. However, this quantity does not exist for most evolutionary processes, because biological interactions are typically nonlinear and fitness effects are not additive. Six recent publications, by proponents of inclusive fitness theory and outside observers, agree with our criticism on two mathematical points: in general, there is no inclusive fitness at the level of the individual and natural selection does not lead organisms to maximize inclusive fitness. Here we review the current state of the controversy over inclusive fitness, highlight points of mathematical agreement, and discuss prospects for a way forward.","inCitations":["3201c146d55544fb33363d513c8164cc260638a1","7bbf5369f7ce8f7736a97f211a81e62e2f4abbdd","8e3ad3b6c77077db343cb5764293b8481e6af267","25625d57e15ca66cd8e45213e846636800f3f402","6163ce1ef9b0e532675fc512dba806256be2475c","2f51c283219d6cf0639173f46d6541c836dacab0","3550b0d08bafc20edd0c064cb72e689567713762","cd0b43877a0311895ceb61717e0de4b3ef4bf7cb","c8f5964b3ba3145d39232e54a190f730bdf69b31"],"pdfUrls":["https://ped.fas.harvard.edu/files/ped/files/1-s2.0-s2352154616301966-main.pdf","https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2352154616301966","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352154616301966?dgcid=api_sd_search-api-endpoint","https://ped.fas.harvard.edu/files/ped/files/allennowaknoif.pdf"],"title":"There is no inclusive fitness at the level of the individual","doi":"10.1016/j.cobeha.2016.10.002","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cobeha.2016.10.002","venue":"Current Opinion in Behavioral Sciences"}

Increased GAL could exacerbate the cognitive and behavioral deficits of AD because GAL acts as an inhibitory modulator of cholinergic and noradren-ergic neurotransmission. The locus ceruleus (LC) may be a source of increased GAL in AD because (a) GAL is coexpressed in a subset of LC neurons, (b) GAL expression is up-regulated with neuronal injury, and (c) the LC undergoes extensive degeneration in AD. Therefore, we have used in situ hybridization histochemistry to measure GAL gene expression in the LC of AD patients and sex- and age-matched nondemented controls. Despite the extensive loss of norepinephrine neurons with AD, GAL mRNA-expressing neurons in the LC did not differ between groups. This resulted in a significant increase in the percentage of neuromelanin-pigmented cells that coexpressed GAL in AD patients compared with controls. These findings raise the possibility that the increased incidence of GAL expression among remaining LC neurons contributes to the hyperinnervation of GAL fibers in AD. Furthermore, GAL may be neuroprotective in the LC.","inCitations":["473fc0a153102c377963a38b5195e22ee1006683","9990b381d4093b6783efde35248582565f94240d","8f773ace06e58849011cadd6930eab4d4f74ab65","5e586fec409a4c3694cd5ac71867956b79c5a9dc","23c08d5a2a7f3f77f85ce254699bdd876714974b","5343b6f396a59c5aa423f5eae3159f10dae53882","edf03749fb6f95b4d0ddff76366e5ec52ceaed8f","8aeaaaac4021afd60749c6a29a67dddeeb9648f2","bf934517a1940ad1170ca3ffbc522d1ee68def57","5e3d60f66e014908f4ed2f81785d69cb7d256928","2ce52932be95aa3875a17f768aa381f1efe4e3d5","f5831ad9d3fc774f0d507de252cdbc8193593b15","e8da7d3a0198c2d07fcbf54c6bc506dd7e82209f","4073b73a1772d69d8d0cc5f9a143254b3fc64431","a429f9464fb181ffd17be270a5777d73704cc1ba","663c8d8de4a90e1b0a4f4ca2ec4bd19915886bc8","c0f0892ebfb89ca2c2b12d74d0f9dc605a8c815b"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Preservation of noradrenergic neurons in the locus ceruleus that coexpress galanin mRNA in Alzheimer's disease.","doi":"10.1046/j.1471-4159.1999.02028.x","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1471-4159.1999.02028.x","venue":"Journal of neurochemistry"}
