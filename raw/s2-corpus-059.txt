A turbulence model which includes the effects of curvature as well as rotation has been developed. Different hypotheses are introduced to model the higher order unknowns in the Reynolds stress, the turbulent kinetic energy and dissipation rate equations are discussed. A detailed analysis of the effect of the rotation on each component of the Reynolds stress tensor is presented for hypothetical cases such as the pure shear flow in a rotating frame. Calculations show that the effects of rotation on turbulent shear stresses are more pronounced in a centrifugal type of turbomachinery than an axial type.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Turbulence modeling for three-dimensional shear flows over curved rotating bodies","doi":"10.2514/3.48655","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.2514/3.48655","venue":""}

The role of electrodynamic processes in the surface layer of microconductors and in environment in the formation of the spatial structure of the plasma channel and in the transformation of the energy of the source to the energy of radiation has been revealed. The spectral characteristics of the radiation of the plasma channel have been analyzed. It has been shown that the radiation spectrum at the time of the formation of the plasma corona is continuous. The most intense spectral lines of copper (510.554, 515.324, 521.82 nm) appear at ∼3 ns after the formation of the plasma corona. The temperature has been estimated from the ratio of the intensities of the spectral lines as Te ∼ 0.7 eV.","inCitations":["c387498dd68a1f8ab513e3878c2f162a0c4e1186","a11086720b03c2551a5c409747e768e9aa402e83"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Mechanisms of the destruction of micron conductors by an electromagnetic pulse with a subnanosecond front","doi":"10.1134/S0021364011190052","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1134/S0021364011190052","venue":""}

To optimize the reduction technology of SSI and its removal ability for nitrate from wastewater, the influence of reduction time of SSI on nitrate removal percentage was investigated. Because the specific surface area was impact smartly by the reduction time of SSI, it was suggested that nitrate removal ability of SSI should declined with the increasing of reduction time once the reduction time longer than the optimized reduction time. When the reduction time was t1, nitrate removal percentage reached to the maximum. When the nitrate original concentration was 5mg-N/L, the reaction order was closed to 0.7 and the apparent reaction rate constant was 0.323 to 0.359 h-1. When nitrate original concentration increased to 50 mg-N/L, nitrate removal reaction appeared to be the pseudo-first-order reaction, and the apparent reaction rate constant was 0.314 to 0.248 h-1.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Influence of Reduction Time of SSI on Nitrite Removal from Wastewater","doi":"10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMR.450-451.667","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.4028/www.scientific.net%2FAMR.450-451.667","venue":""}

The seismic reflection method consists of detecting and processing recorded waves that reflect when meeting the media stiffness changes. Due to the enhancing in the data processing technologies, this method can be adopted with cost-effective for shallow investigation, detection anomalies such as cavity and shallow subsurface profiling. The objective of this study is to evaluate the seismic reflection method for measuring the shallow profile of the pavement layer compared with the conventional impact-echo method and thus able to identify the thickness of the asphalt layer. To ensure the applicability of the seismic reflection approach in various situations, a concrete slab is constructed as an experimental testing site alongside the asphalt pavement. The measurements of the concrete slab and the asphalt pavement thickness are successfully obtained using both the seismic reflection and the impact-echo methods. An attempt was made to detect the time of the waves’ first arrival using Matlab software, combined with a graphical user interface to accelerate and automate the data processing and results' calculations.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://www.ijstr.org/final-print/apr2020/Numerical-Seismic-Approach-For-Pavement-Investigation.pdf"],"title":"Numerical Seismic Approach For Pavement Investigation","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

There has been an increased interest in enhancing the biodegradability of PEs by bfending them with a cheap natural polymer. Low density polyethyfene (LDPE)/tapioca starch biodegradable fifm were prepared by twin-screw extrusion with the addition of glycerol as processing aid. The extrudates were then bfown using blow film extrusion machine to produce plastic sheet. Studies on the characteristics of the fifms were carried out by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and melt flow index. The spectra showaff the significant features of LDPE and tapioca starch in the film. Peak at 3300 to 3490 cm-I refers to stretching vibration -0H groups from starch and this peak is increase as the starch loading increase. Addition of starch and glycerol to the film has ;ncreased the melt flow index of the blends.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Tapioca starch based biodegradable film : a preliminary study","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

At higher concentrations, Mg2+ will replace Ca2+, 4 mM Mg2+ increasing activity to the same extent as does Ca2+ and abolishing the Ca2+ dependence. Above about 1 mM Mg2+, tropomyosin is no longer required for activation by actin, activity being dependent on Ca2+ between 1 and 4 mM Mg2+, but independent of [Ca2+] above 4 mM Mg2+. Phosphorylation of the 20,000-Da light chain of gizzard myosin is required for activation of ATPase activity by actin from chicken gizzard or rabbit skeletal muscle at all concentrations of Mg2+ employed. The effect of adding or removing Ca2+ is fully reversible and cannot be attributed either to irreversible inactivation of actin or myosin or to dephosphorylation. After preincubating in the absence of Ca2+, activity is restored either by adding micromolar concentrations of this cation or by raising the concentration of Mg2+ to 8 mM. Similarly, the inhibition found in the absence of tropomyosin is fully reversed by subsequent addition of this protein. Replacing gizzard actin with skeletal actin alters the pattern of activation by Ca2+ at concentrations of Mg2+ less than 1 mM. Full activation is obtained with or without Ca2+ in the presence of tropomyosin, while in its absence Ca2+ is required but produces only partial activation. Without tropomyosin, the range of Mg2+ concentrations over which activity is Ca2+-dependent is restricted to lower values with skeletal than with gizzard actin. The activity of skeletal muscle myosin is activated by the gizzard actin-tropomyosin complex without Ca2+, although Ca2+ slightly increases activity. The Ca2+ sensitivity of reconstituted gizzard actomyosin is partially retained by hybrid actomyosin containing gizzard myosin and skeletal actin, but less Ca2+ dependence is retained in the hybrid containing skeletal myosin and gizzard actin.","inCitations":["1ed4e589e56c0240502fe4482aae7cf6dd4e17b8","5ccfabcc911daf18b36aacac5b26f4d1d11ff3c6","8ce7f5a66d4c61d74c1b6c0f9c0a9b00efc3ea7b","fab1d02fdf023115b8d70aa36a286fc9cf6f481f"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Dependence on Ca2+ and tropomyosin of the actin-activated ATPase activity of phosphorylated gizzard myosin in the presence of low concentrations of Mg2+.","doi":"","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"The Journal of biological chemistry"}

Participants were recruited in places thought by recruitment officers to be frequented by women at higher-risk, such as kiosks, markets, night schools, and bars. Women attended the research center and underwent a face-to-face interview, HIV counseling and testing, pregnancy testing, and blood sample collection.\n\n\nRESULTS\nHIV prevalence was 32.6% (95% confidence interval (CI) 29.7%-35.5%). Factors associated with being HIV infected in the multivariable analysis were older age (p<0.001), lower educational level (p<0.001), self-reported genital symptoms in the last 3 months (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 1.4; CI 1.1-2.0), more than one lifetime HIV test (aOR = 0.4; CI 0.3-0.6), and not knowing whether the primary partner has ever been tested for HIV (aOR = 1.7; CI 1.1-2.5). About a third (32.3%) of participants who tested HIV-positive had a CD4 lymphocyte count of <350 cells/µl at diagnosis. Factors associated with late diagnosis in multivariable analyses were: not knowing whether the primary partner has ever been tested for HIV (aOR = 2.2; CI 1.1-4.2) and having had a gynecological pathology in the last year (aOR = 3.7; CI 1.2-12.0).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nHIV prevalence and late diagnosis of HIV infection were high in our study population of young women with sexual risk behavior in Beira, Mozambique. HIV prevention programs should be strengthened, health care providers should be sensitized, and regular HIV testing should be encouraged to enroll people living with HIV into care and treatment programs sooner.","inCitations":["92c83b6b500c7612a5a22e969cf15f1932b746c0","ba6e9d69d471d939150ad660dffe9fafd7ebbf6a","57f60d0505bdbd4bc2ec825bff4038505512248b","332ddbc5e756bbdaacd448cb0c708f0d060d073d","9ee84c6739e75dc3ef709bc0df624575bc5bb027","37f6a9b8008ef1af82af1bae4e9fc3957b5452de","ec60261212c9ccc7fe963bf36994edd9bf2a1e09","701518967c91f9d6b6babd0848aac6ab01e0d04a","fa194fec59032390e67c8e93da02bbd796e8f675","1c1b0061b9f0e4efaa6f3efda449d66335547de6","9764e380733b25411c8919126576f7d39fc1ec63","cf3adc509292ee763ab589cc3340e7c17fad7b5e","7911b5df26f6d769ffb7e1183562b5e16ecf607c","f3ed0ffbc3f4960adce6569071ae0595ea539b41","5c4dcc9079a7ea909cadd899ecc05c41c0ca0b28"],"pdfUrls":["http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0063427&type=printable"],"title":"Determinants of Prevalent HIV Infection and Late HIV Diagnosis among Young Women with Two or More Sexual Partners in Beira, Mozambique","doi":"10.1371/journal.pone.0063427","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0063427","venue":"PloS one"}

The results reveal that both of the gratings exhibit similar temperature sensitivities (8.55 and 8.09 pm/ °C) but markedly different sensitivities for ultra-low frequency vibration. This kind of the sensing structure is a new type of sensor for simultaneous measurement of temperature and ultra-low frequency vibration particularly for monitoring the large structure health.","inCitations":["7b81eb2ebbf6f1c8f7a6f6e695cb9576abadb810","c354a0b27e8089b3fd1885466b7556fbd196deb4","da1df2d0035b8c303da919e1844b17fab807bc68","f9902e0b5f740c3d338840fe095f5d328806ecb9","32a03f2f8fc7b514cb2267bca0eca6c0a8351ef3","1e43a334ea3527ac951b29e80d37897991c1a3f5","1c5ea7ade91c21e1ee11ad30e5066cf155430c81","6a2173c450a8c7189b5077aa94aa6e1e5044acc9","c4e5b90a90f6d6cb18f70782aa261c7c9f729a8a","b3f598cc9df7fb648429c2768ffcd7585bb7ab6c","d21ff865cf002920274f8e2f1c85ad8cef56b7b6","82c83ad4d1c4baa0dd863bda5b02d6a93ae75c20","bdb7109d6d46a1bf44064b7cdcf1c584bb3383e2","0dacb5a6541c0c9d340dc36f5741901b9bbbe8ee","0b2a4d8cba162a527cedb37651e0666a047162fe","c596201d22a0389726d40c1218469e54a9e64b12"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Micro-Fiber-Based FBG Sensor for Simultaneous Measurement of Vibration and Temperature","doi":"10.1109/LPT.2013.2272934","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LPT.2013.2272934","venue":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters"}

This paper considers one set of regulating mechanisms - the buffering functions of wetlands - and considers the information needed to identify both the value of the services offered by wetlands, and their substitutes. Using data from a catchment discharging water and nutrients to the Kenyan segment of Lake Victoria, the Yala catchment, the paper models the interactions between agriculture and fisheries as mediated by wetlands at the lake margin. More particularly, it estimates the value of the forgone nutrient retention function involved in the conversion of the wetland to agriculture, and the scope for providing the same services through land use change elsewhere in the catchment. The total cost of the payments that would compensate farmers for on-farm nutrient buffering services is 3.86Â M US$Â year-Â 1, or 35% of the total gains from wetland conversion to crop production. This finding contributes to an understanding of both the value of regulating services and how they might most effectively be delivered in alternative ways.","inCitations":["a561ff42dcc30d4da4d8256529a84a5c2453a60e","5af048d09707c3d2a0bca34c9f247bbf3455bbb1","04af718d32dc6b5d78d01a2784b85de16a2d8159","107aa88d8b69de048a99550f23d59956484bd1c6","cfe8f364d959452e074839d1f60065771eeb78b5","e507b07eb0e974e6518994e79469e4834f82483e","3fd108a18fa93c790bb8bba5d2bf09b330e25a26","7b5fb197e585ee417b2bb4f824589208f54a2061","0181d4d6794acf4e12d280ef99d4e27d9552a845","5ed2361b61a432e35df1f61ef913b632d414d0ac","1dbd907c82c4961543a39d3960957dffd63efa7b","2e1b01dbd6d1cb390429d32f6766eb809fa9bac3","7a23d1a345a7b2f58c6632eef3a17dba726c0dfe","c985bd00b045c5d922018fd90edee3b1e4d16d6e","c38474928c5466b9859a0c337c0f3e846ce8da65","9e8623e54860454a525a033a888dbc50012b273f","becbc86bed7e5702d712637d97d83413e08239da","cfc29cb58e9efa62b5420a2865e6a0923d15e054","4b805381bdde88ec62ed2cd1fa78a883e3433816","367997053ecf614af1a15eec00e6f460e422d2a4","2a288e90298285b96d837b91223fdd0f6fd79154","93fad49cfca6d063f8c2ddb1ce974d2504a695ae","d2a854e688fcbf96246f2db1c1dc8ca4e32323d3","b149972813cc77d3e62b8a8c812fdfb5deef9d3a","3795108c0e4f8ee8b5dc1fd01ba00c794f16d5e8","a6aefc656ed3c8040e965c73fa37f7fe14bb1c0c","456fbbfad1641391b086f7d7cba48969ed75ac84","0f45fbb07a9632deb4bc5766c846d881f5d54d82","0bb0649af4a231ea71e3cc06fd04c04f2b6fd482"],"pdfUrls":["http://ecoservices.asu.edu/pdf/Simonit%20and%20Perrings%20EE%20(2011).pdf","http://www.public.asu.edu/~cperring/PDFs/Simonit%20and%20Perrings%20EE%20(2011).pdf"],"title":"Sustainability and the value of the 'regulating' services: Wetlands and water quality in Lake Victoria","doi":"10.1016/j.ecolecon.2011.01.017","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolecon.2011.01.017","venue":""}

La place du gériatre dans le dépistage et la sensibilisation au risque iatrogène sont centrales, mais l’action de ce dernier ne peut être efficace sans une coordination optimale des soins entre les prises en charge hospitalière et ambulatoire. Le développement d’outils de coordination ciblés sur la iatrogénie va dans ce sens, mais il semble bien que le plus grand pas en avant dans ce domaine sera réalisé dans les années qui viennent grâce à l’innovation numérique et au partage d’informations via des dossiers et réseaux numériques de santé réellement sécurisés et interopérables.AbstractMedicinal iatrogenesis is a significant cause of hospital admissions in elderly patients and is the origin of close to 20% of admissions in those patients over 80 years. The place of geriatrics in screening for and raising the awareness of the iatrogenic risk is the key, but its activity may not be effective without good coordination between hospital and outpatient care. The development of coordination tools targeting iatrogenesis is heading in the right direction; however, it appears that the biggest leaps forward in this area will be made in the years to come, through digital innovation and the sharing of healthcare information via secure and interoperable computer-based folders and networks.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Place de la coordination des soins ville/hôpital dans la réduction du risque iatrogène","doi":"10.1007/s12612-014-0384-8","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s12612-014-0384-8","venue":""}

Direct Numerical Simulation of fluid and inertial particles (\\(St = 3.0\\)) moving in a stationary homogeneous shear flow is performed and the autocorrelation functions of the norm and components of the Lagrangian acceleration vector are calculated. The energy balance between turbulent scales is first observed, and the range of scales, sensitive to growth and collapse phases, is identified. In link to this range, it was shown that the acceleration norm is correlated longer during a growth phase and shorter during a collapse phase. This effect is amplified when inertia of particles is increased. At the same time, it was shown that the acceleration vector components are invariant to the regenerating cycle.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Effects of Regenerating Cycle on Lagrangian Acceleration in Homogeneous Shear Flow","doi":"10.1007/978-3-030-12547-9_7","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-12547-9_7","venue":""}

Practising qigong is one of the most popular forms of complementary and alternative medicine used among chronically ill patients. Little is known about the experiences of the chronically ill patients practising qigong in the severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak and even less is known how this practice is related to the social context of Hong Kong during the outbreak.\n\n\nDESIGN AND METHODS\nQualitative methods using participant-observation from three qigong classes in Hong Kong and in-depth semi-structured interviews with 30 participants were employed. Content analysis and discourse analysis were used to identify major themes of the data.\n\n\nRESULTS\nBoth the underlying and trigger motivations could motivate these chronically ill participants to practise qigong. Legitimacy of qigong in health maintenance, deterioration of health and unpleasant experiences in biomedical treatment on their chronic illnesses served as the underlying motivations. Stigmatization of and discrimination against the chronically ill and the sense of searching coping strategy during the severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak further motivated their practice.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nTo the participants, practising qigong not only could strengthen their health, but was also a coping strategy for them to regain an active control and the sense of security in their health and enabled them to overcome the social stigmatization and discrimination during the outbreak. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE. Searching for emotional support and a more active role in health conditions could be seen from the chronically ill participants. Understanding and paying more attention to the particular needs of the chronically ill patients can enable health-care professionals to provide better care and support for the chronically ill during an epidemic crisis.","inCitations":["8503ebc4a67fc9ee884c499759221ab1177045c1","d3276736477da67de25ba2c98ff83166c1756157","afae15dc491dd4238dd8c75774896091c26cb2c1","78ed553f0e29e23315be92820400084897e2026e","1ab150c9670365f0bedd7f2182dda0a2aa7d3174","422cc25edbef3cafea0810f27f0a8119c13dd5a7","4a776f5cbcd1ab220290eac7ac593ebf4bc2b674","410f7a0e3cb5ce569e26f53a375359ce08d54d30"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Qigong practice among chronically ill patients during the SARS outbreak.","doi":"10.1111/j.1365-2702.2006.01695.x","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2702.2006.01695.x","venue":"Journal of clinical nursing"}

But the requirement of electrochemical workstation and light source limits the development of portable PEC biosensors. In this work, a portable solar-driven visualization PEC biosensor has been successfully developed to completely get rid of instruments requirement. This biosensor is fabricated onto a small ITO electrode which may be divided into two modules, one is the detection module and the other is the reference module. Each module is composed of two regions. Co, N-TiO2/3DGH (three-dimensional graphene hydrogel) nanocomposite is used to construct the photoelectric sensing region and the electrochromic material Prussian Blue (PB) is used in the visual region. The quantification is through the chromaticity ratio of visual regions on the two modules. Based on this, the proposed portable visual biosensor has been successfully applied to the detection of ochratoxin A (OTA). A good linear range (1 ng/mL∼500 ng/mL) was obtained with a detection limit of 0.29 ng/mL. Due to its high accuracy and portability, the sensor will bring bright prospects for research in the fields of bioanalysis, food testing and so on.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"A portable solar-driven ratiometric photo-electrochromic visualization biosensor for detection of ochratoxin A","doi":"10.1016/j.snb.2019.127594","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.snb.2019.127594","venue":""}

In vitro releases of CL-MTO and mitoxantrone liposomes ( L-MTO) were determined by dialysis. After intravenous injection of I-MTO ( mitoxantrone saline solution) ,L-MTO and CL-MTO to tumor-bearing mice, levels of MTO in the biological samples were assayed by HPLC,and the tissue distribution and targeting performance of the three different formulations were evaluated, and their pharmacodynamics were determined by their antitumor efficacy. It was found that the cumulative release of CL-MTO and L-MTO in various dissolution media ( pH 6. 0-7. 4 ) were around 30. 81%-16. 15% and 41. 84%-32. 51% ,respectively. Chitosan-coating retarded in vitro release of MTO from the liposomes. If compared to I-MTO,the study of tissue distribution of CL-MTO and L-MTO proved that the area under the plasma concentration-time curve ( AUCplasma) increased significantly,while the area under the heart and kidney tissue level-time curve ( AUCheart and AUCkidney) decreased. The ratio of the AUC of plasma to that AUC of reticulo-endothelial system ( Blood /RES) of CL-MTO was 1. 70-fold higher than that of L-MTO. Moreover,there existed higher relative tumor exposure ( 1. 74-fold) and higher therapeutic efficacy of CL-MTO than L-MTO.

Key parameters of logistic delivery schemes are analyzed in the paper. The paper estimates an influence of a time parameter on the level of transport and logistics costs and, as a consequence, on  a final finished product. While determining a stock level it is necessary to know not only an intensity of material resource consumption by manufacturing process  for a concrete period of time, but also a probability of non-observance of   transport service terms and cost of stock storage. Stocks of mass cargoes are basically formed at first stages of industrial and transport system and cost of their storage is relatively insignificant. However deficit presence of the given resources influences on functioning of all subsequent interrelated stages of the industrial and transport system. Thus, a risk of deficit occurrence of the given resources can be probably reduced by creating a high stock rate. There is a processing of hi-tech component items (or half-finished products) at last stages of the industrial and transport system.

The models considered in this article are the five-vertex model as a fermion system and the non-Hermitian phase model as a boson system. Both models are characterized by different solutions satisfying the same Yang–Baxter relation. From our previous works on the identification between the wavefunctions of the five-vertex model and Grothendieck polynomials, we introduce skew Grothendieck polynomials and derive the addition theorem among them. Using these relations, we derive the wavefunctions of the non-Hermitian phase model as a determinant form, which can also be expressed as Grothendieck polynomials. Namely, we establish a K-theoretic boson–fermion correspondence at the level of wavefunctions. As a by-product, the partition function of the statistical mechanical model of a three-dimensional (3D) melting crystal is exactly calculated by use of the scalar products of the wavefunctions of the phase model. The resultant expression can be regarded as a K-theoretic generalization of the MacMahon function describing the generating function of the plane partitions, which interpolates the generating functions of two-dimensional (2D) and (3D) Young diagrams.","inCitations":["6e63125234453541de1a000740b405b23c49d6aa","68babfb7fcec06c5b1d28fcfd8d6d74392e0deb7","d3012864a49f333f1917114abbdd240ffd58598d","08790646dcaf64824b35add441943aa99c11fb07","d369f738983c4f55fb1f08db58999e6ff7732586","e36d4e16b78bbee3a4197abe7f5c203c3d8ae927","5b2e3bb77592be8867f93c466c4515251e6cdc99","c564fc60ac3fa4d2ff7021933f2b4d4f7e6840c9","baa40cf78d1147601b379f1c698ea8eb99a84e8d","0f429929e91994a2a5362392adbe9f069b0fbf35","96d2abf9fff28e53a771a0463cf4db705979078e","50c03ce1c4377c1c6103f08d28585f9ac5a6e2c7","38e26d5ea71634625cc02ecc641773e206ff197c","c4ce1f1f9ee889dfb31f970c4cc01862029780ed","ff5c7384c229e9b41e3d5c47a5b7c0d429c189fb"],"pdfUrls":["https://arxiv.org/pdf/1311.6076v4.pdf"],"title":"K-theoretic boson-fermion correspondence and melting crystals","doi":"10.1088/1751-8113/47/44/445202","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1088/1751-8113%2F47%2F44%2F445202","venue":""}

On treatment with a sphingosine-1-phosphate agonist, the frequency of these cells falls precipitously, but with a delay of ∼14 h compared with blood CD4 T cells; neither anti-CD62L nor pertussis toxin prevents entry of naïve CD4 T cells into the lung. Based on treatment with anti-CD62L and the use of CCR7(-/-) cells, lung naïve CD4 T cells appear to migrate to the mediastinal lymph nodes along a CD62L-independent, CCR7-dependent pathway. Cells that have entered the node in this manner are competent to respond to antigen. Thus, a portion (approximately one-half) of naïve CD4 T cells appears to enter the mediastinal lymph nodes through a blood-to-lung-to-lymph node route.","inCitations":["0be48424d633921e5cfaea5875d14dfab37e9209","af53b423b591c0e400b8fa83f7b6b0540233f8a5","a5f74e470ce011278444ccd25e7f150417f8a5a4","41fb6ae026c3d5e271f901a154851a37ce88603a","dbecbee80cda7608a683b15b8c666e14a2a2ec93","35b4d9682b8cf0618b09f279b8fabd73255ac2e4","6ebab974de4c689b86f58162a85cfd92c5b0e318","24436603902c9c5782c91804a072636679b73d8a"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.pnas.org/content/110/5/1821.full.pdf"],"title":"Analysis of naïve lung CD4 T cells provides evidence of functional lung to lymph node migration.","doi":"10.1073/pnas.1221306110","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1221306110","venue":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America"}

In the three species, the ChATir cells were mainly distributed in the inner plexiform layer (IPL), which in lampreys extends from the inner nuclear layer (INL) to the inner limiting membrane. These cells had a bipolar, triangular or stellate appearance, and gave rise to processes coursing in the inner plexiform layer. In transforming lampreys, ChATir processes formed two asymmetrical inner and outer subplexuses in the inner plexiform layer, which is reminiscent of the distribution of processes of ChATir cells in the On and Off sublaminae reported in jawed vertebrates. The larval retina lacked ChAT immunoreactivity, and ChATir cells and processes appeared at early metamorphosis throughout the retina, exhibiting in late transforming stages an organization similar to that of adults. This first report of ChATir cells in the lamprey retina indicates that the appearance of cholinergic circuits in the retina of vertebrates occurred before the divergence of the agnathan and gnathostome lines.","inCitations":["b6b8f35e79bacd2cf97e9bdb19daf8af17085d28","9625b40b01779909b183c535e17e46cfc18dadd2","f21bb1d9bb41838bb805be0babd3c2669ca6ea78","53ed06168d56b62ed5eeda4f5e150b035ce2c8e7","0c41d7d1abc443f5619df00f8744b0b530afca46","346b8441cfdbd290f0c01782cde37be9fc3b98a6","c9550ff4b741808a17c842973e24a96284d0121d","54c2488d702944906de6318992cc7035537bc1f3","6d436a7acc2a0f5aaf4638c35a1b5be1de55ee9b","7d46c6f99c85688648adc340e477f9f1b4348a7c","224864042d1641ec55841a28beec682441d192c8","2a72b133965876b79a2d09cc6bccdd5174a5c3a8"],"pdfUrls":["https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0006899303037211","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006899303037211?dgcid=api_sd_search-api-endpoint"],"title":"Choline acetyltransferase-immunoreactive neurons in the retina of adult and developing lampreys","doi":"10.1016/j.brainres.2003.09.005","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.brainres.2003.09.005","venue":"Brain Research"}

In this study, we assessed a modification of a standard airline seat (NewSit) designed to decrease the incidence of DVT on long flights. This seat raises the feet from the floor, facilitates mobility, and permits intermittent calf compression. Air plethysmography (APG) was used to measure the ejected venous volume of the calves of 25 volunteers before and after sitting for 5 hours on the conventional and modified seats. The mean percent (+/- standard deviation [SD]) increase in venous volume for the conventional seat after 5 hours of continuous sitting was significantly greater than that for the modified seat (26.6 +/- 18.5% vs 3.5 +/- 13.1%, P < 0.0001 by paired, two-tailed t-test). Improvement (any) was seen in 23 of 25 patients, with 15 of the 23 (65%) being better than 1 SD of the mean (P < 0.0001 by Chi-square analysis). This study suggests that the leg movement and calf compression associated with the modified airline seat (NewSit) may decrease the probability of DVT due to prolonged periods of sitting by reducing venous stasis as measured by APG. Further studies involving a larger randomized patient cohort, as well as analysis of the effect of this modification on specific coagulation markers such as tissue plasminogen activator and fibrin D-dimer, are planned.","inCitations":["80be6fc468884ff57a6a25b8f0221f6647cf7bf3"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Venous stasis, deep venous thrombosis and airline flight: can the seat be fixed?","doi":"10.1016/j.avsg.2007.03.007","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.avsg.2007.03.007","venue":"Annals of vascular surgery"}

The problem addressed by scheduling disciplines is that of ordering the access to contended resources. The ordering is typically based on either (1) properties that are exposed by the entities that compete for the resource (like a deadline), or by (2) external properties (like the arrival order), or (3) a combination of both. In literature there exist many different scheduling algorithms, each of which has certain properties and an associated application domain. All these scheduling disciplines are based on the assumption that all the entities that compete for a resource are provided with the same collection of properties. This assumption makes sense in a closed environment; however it makes interoperability difficult for systems that have different scheduling algorithms and in which competitors migrate from one system to another. This problem is becoming evident in distributed computing environments like Object Request Brokers (ORB), Agent Frameworks, Load Balancing Systems, in which active components, which have usually QoS requirements, migrate through different endsystems. In such scenarios we cannot assume that all the endsystems will provide the same scheduling disciplines for all the resources that might be subject to scheduling. Even if they do, there might be a lack of a global knowledge that would make interoperabil-ity hard. In general, it is desirable that the QoS requirements exposed by any of these active components will be preserved and enforced even in face of presence of non-homogeneity, and migration. This thesis tackles the problem outlined above, by (1) providing a formal framework that can be used to describe any scheduling discipline, (2) providing a set of transformations that can be applied to the migrating entities, to reconcile their QoS requirements with respect to the scheduling discipline of the visited endsystem, and (3) providing a meta-programming architecture that maps the formalized abstractions to a software architecture that can be used as a reference model for a system that implements the ideas expressed in this thesis.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://www.cs.wustl.edu/cs/techreports/2001/wucs-01-24.pdf"],"title":"Juno: a Framework for Reconciling Scheduling Disciplines Juno: a Framework for Reconciling Scheduling Disciplines Contents","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Nuclear bodies are thought to serve as sites for the biogenesis, assembly, and storage of specific proteins and RNAs. In the last decade, multiple nuclear bodies were found to contain long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), and the physiological and molecular functions of these lncRNAs have been elucidated. Numerous lncRNAs are induced in response to cellular stresses, presumably as a mechanism to cope with environmental changes. Some lncRNAs play architectural or structural roles to construct and sustain nuclear bodies; these lncRNAs exert their physiological functions by sequestering specific regulatory proteins in nuclear bodies. Other lncRNAs do not contribute to the integrity of the nuclear body structure but play significant roles in the transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of genes by modulating the function and localization of related regulatory proteins. In this review, we focus on the recently unveiled roles of lncRNAs that act as structural and/or functional components of nuclear bodies.","inCitations":["22c5d99c3457a8c3bd14537409c92ee470fdafd5"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Long Noncoding RNAs as Structural and Functional Components of Nuclear Bodies","doi":"10.1007/978-4-431-55576-6_7","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-4-431-55576-6_7","venue":""}

Three factors were identified: procedure, quality of life, information and perception after biopsy. Responses were analysed with Chi-square. Two groups of women were identified, the first group (G1) corresponding to patients with a benign diagnosis (N=32) and the second group (G2) to patients with malignant diagnosis (N=32). Only the \"procedure\" factor was different at T1 and T2 (P=0.022). Compression was found to be painful: 11% at T1 versus 21% at T2. Women were disturbed by local anesthesia: 26% at T1 versus 21% at T2. Biopsy was painful: 6% at T1 versus 13% at T2. Examination was too long: 24% at T1 versus 35% at T2. The procedure was discomfortable: 52% at T1 versus 54% at T2. Information satisfied patients in 90% cases.

Current drug treatments rely on the benzimidazole derivatives albendazole and mebendazole, but there is emerging resistance to these drugs. As part of a larger screening effort, using a hamster-based ex vivo assay, anthelmintic activity toward Ancylostoma ceylanicum was observed in the crude extract of aerial parts of Dalea ornata. These studies have led to the isolation and characterization of phenolic metabolites 1-10. The structures were determined by 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopy, and the absolute configuration of 1 was assigned using electronic circular dichroism data. The new compound, (2S)-8-(3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)-6,7,4'-trihydroxyflavanone (1), was weakly active at 7.3 μM, with 17% reduction in survival of the hookworms after 5 days. The rotenoids deguelin (9) and tephrosin (10), predictably perhaps, were the most active, with complete worm mortality observed by day 4 (or earlier) at 6.3 and 6.0 μM, respectively. The effects of 1-10 on hookworm motility and on toxicity to hamster splenocytes were also explored as important measures of treatment potential.","inCitations":["c3f0cee0deee63cc95d0c4a6b50e9fe88e8c78f5","5a0e97ad7a5a86d4023b5c255c8cfd180671b24b"],"pdfUrls":["https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/pstorage-acs-6854636/5914947/np6b00444_si_001.pdf"],"title":"Phenolic Metabolites of Dalea ornata Affect Both Survival and Motility of the Human Pathogenic Hookworm Ancylostoma ceylanicum.","doi":"10.1021/acs.jnatprod.6b00444","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jnatprod.6b00444","venue":"Journal of natural products"}

The different detection approaches are examined qualitatively and quantitatively in terms of the interface position, conditional statistics and orientation of streamlines and vortex lines at the interface. Computing the probability density function (p.d.f.) of the mean location of the T/NT interface from vorticity and scalar allows a detailed comparison of the two methods, where we observe a very good agreement. Furthermore, conditional mean profiles of various quantities are evaluated. In particular, the position p.d.f.s for both criteria coincide and are found to follow a Gaussian distribution. The terms of the governing equations for vorticity and passive scalar are conditioned on the distance to the interface and analysed. At the interface, vortex stretching is negligible and the displacement of the vorticity interface is found to be determined by diffusion, analogous to the scalar interface. In addition, the orientation of vortex lines at the vorticity and the scalar based T/NT interface are analyzed. For both interfaces, vorticity lines are perpendicular to the normal vector of the interface, i.e. parallel to the interface isosurface.","inCitations":["33a20832edc61661b78382f607c11c1b3c56a5b9","550ed979862af0b30a20031869818e69e342a627","371f56acb1e16bea8c6ec4c8bcfa6724b897f749","8bfcf498e203a0f0f2eb876acb29da15005c65f3","98a57327472bc14a2a75359d403b5c847ef56f78","2fed29246d372605a4fc8424def9179a5934e4b9","d17bf4995ee718d29df37a1d86a2f889808201cc","2f8da5a11bb13e60d07175f944558ab368c1e36b","d811ddc6f66a450ad0f2ab58490a02c9184cc615","fa98fe784dc9649790904b0e7d15b3060ae6b643","01c0f42a77024190e4a28330094b59c3e5a37439","684390f57b62d0e130d611b6e2d92bdad63cb7c2"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"The vorticity versus the scalar criterion for the detection of the turbulent/non-turbulent interface","doi":"10.1017/jfm.2014.280","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1017/jfm.2014.280","venue":""}

Byrne in 1918. Until he passed away in 1960, Byrne fervently believed that his cipher system was unbreakable, regardless of the amount of material available to a cryptanalyst. For several decades, he tried (unsuccessfully), to propose the Chaocipher to government agencies. In 1953, he exposed his Chaocipher in his autobiography, Silent Years, providing several examples of texts encrypted with Chaocipher as challenges, but without divulging the inner workings of the cipher. Those were made public only in 2010, when Byrne’s family donated the entire corpus of Chaocipher papers to the National Cryptologic Museum (NCM) in Fort Meade. A known-plaintext method for recovering the key settings, given sufficient matching plaintext and ciphertext, was published in 2010. However, to date, no method for the cryptanalysis of a single ciphertext-only Chaocipher message has been proposed, nor for the cryptanalysis of short messages “in-depth,” i.e., multiple messages generated with the same initial key settings. In this article, the authors present a new hillclimbing algorithm for a ciphertext-only cryptanalysis of Chaocipher in-depth messages. This algorithm is based on a “divide-and-conquer” approach and the use of the Index of Coincidence. It takes advantage of a major weakness in the design of the cipher. This previously unknown weakness may have been the reason why William F. Friedman, the inventor of the Index of Coincidence, rejected Byrne’s offer for the use of Chaocipher by the U.S. government. Additionally, the authors present a known-plaintext attack for short in-depth messages, as well as the solution for Lou Kruh’s and Cipher Deavours’s alternate Exhibit 5, also known as “Exhibit 6.” Finally, the authors reevaluate the security of the Chaocipher in view of those findings, with the conclusion that in its classic form, as designed by Byrne, the Chaocipher was a relatively weak cipher, despite Byrne’s rather strong assertions to the contrary.","inCitations":["ee6b55b46c9fc0b659cff92453a092778572f150"],"pdfUrls":["https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q62016822"],"title":"Cryptanalysis of Chaocipher and solution of Exhibit 6","doi":"10.1080/01611194.2015.1091797","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1080/01611194.2015.1091797","venue":"Cryptologia"}

The goal of this study was to provide a comprehensive description of the cardiopulmonary and biological profile of patients with thalassaemia at risk for PH. A case-control study of thalassaemia patients at high versus low PH-risk was performed. A single cross-sectional measurement for variables reflecting cardiopulmonary status and biological pathophysiology were obtained, including Doppler-echocardiography, 6-min-walk-test, Borg Dyspnoea Score, New York Heart Association functional class, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), chest-computerized tomography, pulmonary function testing and laboratory analyses targeting mechanisms of coagulation, inflammation, haemolysis, adhesion and the arginine-nitric oxide pathway. Twenty-seven thalassaemia patients were evaluated, 14 with an elevated tricuspid-regurgitant-jet-velocity (TRV) ≥ 2·5 m/s. Patients with increased TRV had a higher frequency of splenectomy, and significantly larger right atrial size, left atrial volume and left septal-wall thickness on echocardiography and/or MRI, with elevated biomarkers of abnormal coagulation, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels and arginase concentration, and lower arginine-bioavailability compared to low-risk patients. Arginase concentration correlated significantly to several echocardiography/MRI parameters of cardiovascular function in addition to global-arginine-bioavailability and biomarkers of haemolytic rate, including LDH, haemoglobin and bilirubin. Thalassaemia patients with a TRV ≥ 2·5 m/s have additional echocardiography and cardiac-MRI parameters suggestive of right and left-sided cardiac dysfunction. In addition, low arginine bioavailability may contribute to cardiopulmonary dysfunction in β-thalassaemia.","inCitations":["bdd57507a20c671e500989a62323e3c41e68f9ae","fcf17e644e708a1646411f868d2de83d4f795cba","1fe7117f8362b888246d516ae6e56a8b6c4070a0","b2ca347d0d3c3d899e776a910b08508ef123dd1e","6e97d34caa3cdee7e877c040dbf311da99e9eb0d","59f4a841a5675ab249b0260cdded9979a963edee","9fdbd9ec0d7c1cf8862e7bf71f3c56877caffdad","b86307f496aa9acaf290b8a3013cc0d6792236bf"],"pdfUrls":["https://touroscholar.touro.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2508&context=nymc_fac_pubs"],"title":"Dysregulated arginine metabolism and cardiopulmonary dysfunction in patients with thalassaemia.","doi":"10.1111/bjh.13452","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1111/bjh.13452","venue":"British journal of haematology"}

A great deal of insight into the anatomical and physiological basis of human visual resolution has been gained since Helmholtz first proposed his sampling theory of visual resolution. Anatomical, physiological and psychophysical investigations have revealed in great detail the properties of the biological structures underlying visual resolution and identified many of the optical, retinal, and cortical factors that govern the limits of visual resolution. However, technological limitations have long prevented researchers from examining both the structure and function of the visual system simultaneously in the living eye. The microscopic photoreceptors of the retina have been inaccessible to optical examination, preventing high quality measurements of both visual resolution and retinal anatomy from being obtained in the same eyes. The present studies investigated the relationship between the optical, retinal, and cortical factors that govern visual resolution in humans. These experiments employed adaptive optics scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (AOSLO) as a tool to study how these factors govern visual resolution in normal and diseased eyes. The AOSLO is an ideal tool for studying the limits of vision because of its ability to present complex stimuli to the retina that are of higher optical quality than the visual system has ever experienced, while simultaneously imaging the underlying cone photoreceptor mosaic on a microscopic scale.Adaptive optics correction of ocular aberrations allowed observers to achieve immediate and significant improvements in visual resolution. Training was not required to achieve this benefit, which allowed the resolving capacity of the retinal and cortical visual system to be assessed unobstructed by the optics of the eye. Not all participants in these studies benefited to the same extent from AO correction. Visual resolution was found to be significantly poorer in low myopia as compared to emmetropia, despite the similar optical quality afforded by AO correction, showing that retinal and cortical changes in myopia caused the observed deficit. Simultaneous imaging and visual resolution testing determined the precise relationship between the spatial sampling limit of the cone mosaic and visual resolution across the human fovea. These studies revealed that the spatial sampling limit of the cone mosaic largely governs visual resolution at the center of the fovea for normal eyes, but that outside the foveal center visual resolution falls off at a greater rate than predicted by cone spacing and is governed by the spatial sampling limit of the mosaic of midget retinal ganglion cells.Significant differences between otherwise normally appearing observers were revealed using AOSLO, showing the power of visual resolution testing after AO correction for detecting small changes in the visual system resulting from disease. Significant retinal changes were revealed in female carriers of a rare X-linked genetic mutation in the L and M opsin gene array that causes blue cone monochromacy (the loss of all L and M cone function) in affected males. Retinal findings from AO imaging provided insight into the development and function of the carrier retina. Although carriers had visual resolution within the normal range when tested clinically, visual resolution testing in AOSLO revealed significantly reduced visual resolution compared to normal eyes. Resolution testing across the fovea in normal and diseased eyes provided insight into the relationship between cones, ganglion cells and visual resolution across the visual field. Retinal imaging showed that carriers had fairly normal cone topography despite peak cone density that was ~50% lower than normal; showing that cones destined to express a non-functional photopigment degenerated early in development. Drastic reductions in visual resolution across the fovea in the carrier are best explained by ganglion cell loss that resulted from the loss of cones in the carrier. The relationship between resolution and the spatial sampling limit of the carrier cone mosaic was similar to what was predicted for normal eyes, suggesting an organizing principle in the visual system whereby cone density is the primary determinant of the retinal circuitry that governs visual resolution across the visual field. Together, these studies provide an important contribution to the understanding of the limits of human visual resolution.","inCitations":["8b1f828e90fce67e17280d5ea5bafdd5faeaa36d"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"The Limits of Visual Resolution","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}
