The uninterrupted open reading frame (ORF) of 951 nucleotides encoded a predicted protein of 316 amino acids (aa), containing the characteristic motif [LIVMN]-[KR]-G-N-H-E. Comparison with other sequences in non-redundant databases showed that Tv-STP-1 had significant identities/similarities to those from a range of metazoans and protists. Sequence similarity was most pronounced in the central region of the protein, in which the catalytic activity is inferred to be modulated by eight conserved residues (Asp 61, His 63, Asp 92, Asp 95, Asn 121, His 171, His 246 and Tyr 270), known to coordinate the binding of two metal ions (Mn2+ and Fe2+) in various organisms. Phylogenetic analyses of selected amino acid sequence data using the neighbor-joining and maximum parsimony methods revealed Tv-STP-1 to be most closely related to the glc seven-like phosphatases inferred for genes from the free-living nematode Caenorhabditis elegans and the parasitic nematode Oesophagostomum dentatum (order Strongylida). Comparison of the genomic organization of the full-length Tv-stp-1 gene with related molecules from other nematodes revealed substantial variation in the lengths and numbers of the exons and introns. The entire genes Tv-stp-1 (5041-5362 bp; 10 exons and 9 introns) and Od-mpp-1 (10,271 bp; 8 exons and 9 introns) from the parasitic nematodes T. vitrinus and O. dentatum were considerably longer than the C. elegans genes (1222-1603 bp; 3-7 exons and 2-6 introns). Transcriptional analysis by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) showed that Tv-stp-1 was transcribed in adult males of T. vitrinus, but not in the adult female or in any larval stages of this species. In spite of considerable variation at the genomic level, the findings of the present study suggest that there is relative conservation in features and function of the serine/threonine protein phosphatase characterized among T. vitrinus, O. dentatum and C. elegans, which should have implications for exploring molecular reproductive and developmental processes in strongylid nematodes of socio-economic importance.","inCitations":["f6654bde92598c056925c4b748df13253ee067fd","7b70aa390aedf495f66edef2ad40e4b6efe5f2bb","e40232bb1da08688dbfdb009e205d5bbe9269d85","55bc62173c7a111e59be3f49e6ddc8f8384a0fd7","08e0207a1b7776763aae838887d97614fca3917f","b97b75d01d6ad7be3a941fecb1541f75533fee96","027e7378ccf8d8e770f6831375486fd25a5b9f39","54d0a13d41e810421b7e236678a6fc4d78a33ce4","2ac314600bad20436435df2365037f2cb05393d9","f33f466486a76eeedf5739520a744b325202a5ac","861e8ae93e4bb8992d216e79a112a6284fd9508d","7e41bb363a9b6ad3ac9ef7d90ba339d01d639744","a66251cb99d9d147aab1a152a529143434df771a","570655ac920314ba249051b88a7081bec6949f4e","2ccfba9fd2b63928957f288ab282f7ec8ac0e30d"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Trichostrongylus vitrinus (Nematoda: Strongylida): molecular characterization and transcriptional analysis of Tv-stp-1, a serine/threonine phosphatase gene.","doi":"10.1016/j.exppara.2007.03.008","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.exppara.2007.03.008","venue":"Experimental parasitology"}

Since several tens of stations can operate in a WLAN, the performance of MAC protocols is important for overall network efficiency. It has been observed that the IEEE 802.11 MAC protocols can be improved by knowing which station has a non-empty queue, i.e., queue status. The point coordination function (PCF) can use this information to avoid polling a station that has no pending data. The HCF controlled channel access can adapt polling parameters based on queue status information, especially when scheduling a bursty and variable bit-rate traffic. Previously suggested methods are rather limited in terms of accuracy and efficiency. In this paper, we propose a novel method to investigate the queue status of multiple stations by exploiting orthogonal signaling. With synchronous transmission of orthogonal codes and symbol level signal processing, the method allows all of the associated stations to report their queue status at the same time. Challenges that can arise in the implementation of the proposed method are identified, and their solutions are suggested. The feasibility of detecting orthogonal signals is thoroughly tested on a realistic channel model. To demonstrate the performance improvement of a MAC protocol, we applied the proposed method to PCF. Both analysis and simulation show that the modified PCF significantly outperforms not only the original PCF but also other previously suggested PCF enhancements.","inCitations":["7af8a9adcb9b540080b7023be2f202fb95463c07","ff268bc28c8da0fd4ce3e54e3373b53721578412"],"pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1016/j.comcom.2010.11.007","https://nds.postech.ac.kr/data/publication/717.pdf"],"title":"Orthogonal signaling-based queue status investigation method in IEEE 802.11","doi":"10.1016/j.comcom.2010.11.007","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.comcom.2010.11.007","venue":"Comput.

The extended set-membership filter (ESMF) is introduced to solve this task. This filter reduces the estimation error effectively and recursively provides an ellipsoidal region where the true state locates. In addition, the ESMF is similar to the extended Kalman filter (EKF) in structure with comparable simplicity. To demonstrate the superiority of the ESMF, a comparison is made with the unscented Kalman filter (UKF) and the interacting multiple model (IMM) algorithm.

The first method, which simply augments domain constraints with the transitivity and asymmetry for partial orders, is improved by the second method, which introduces the notion of domain variables to reduce the number of Boolean variables. The third method turns out to be most useful for monotonic domain constraints, because it requires no explicit encoding for the transitivity. We show how those methods are successfully applied to expert systems in a software verification domain.","inCitations":["afa0d57b0bb20091adc04a027bcb7a5fb85642d1","e76701f42d2891407b156feac6e070a9d67644b5","9afe1582ac2fe079410b6581a75882b54900c171","a55c5533a061832668b306e022053bfc6f16528f","8cf5f693abd3f006f3a4b4c4823ba8b703016379","2ce0f1555ddee60b4e5b302f2b4a41b2bdf28688","0a094d295687434b264e541b5e665ffa734343a4","301d17693edb079286915bca8419bc4f3369ae2d","55d40cb57afc5fee87f2b35b8d52ba55520a5a32","af0104ca76f0bed3d9924049967469ff81820295","9bac86b631a0eb75d2c2e79e1a27b3c6082bd58b","6bb3a3e49b99808104cde6ee3c2232c2c4ee7a7b","2418ba09dceb3c8cd182d23e963d004b6a940b80","7b9ef1bb0d20ccd37233b8895f4725d069837f4c","3d6bb52138d3aff418d0da85edc0ee31e9a6f4cd","2319bc7e45cde50c9b49859534ee79f6c824e894","1fae5b2052134b69f391fd9b29ef037b8949ad28","5e85888d67d254dcd3faa62b9b3db6ab0b8a79b6","63c568c3ab92c92d4cf5035204c8f4e6045257a6","5f506f4ae38f5338cc5cb19fdd226dbcc8eb249c","50256139e12576845b89b500e8a4e3925cafbed6","50344838094597594be6355cb869409a322d1d99","7e6fa6f7d42ac95aa9c3f63a548e621faaeca580","a6d0400af1ccb49eff9561fca8cad277d11e653d"],"pdfUrls":["http://lis2.huie.hokudai.ac.jp/~kurihara/paperlist/PDF/kurihara2004ieaaie-final.pdf","http://www.researchgate.net/profile/Masahito_Kurihara/publication/221048456_Efficient_BDD_Encodings_for_Partial_Order_Constraints_with_Application_to_Expert_Systems_in_Software_Verification/links/53fbfb340cf22f21c2f3a055.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-540-24677-0_85"],"title":"Efficient BDD Encodings for Partial Order Constraints with Application to Expert Systems in Software Verification","doi":"10.1007/978-3-540-24677-0_85","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-540-24677-0_85","venue":"IEA/AIE"}

Each method was categorized according to its importance. The quality of individual methods was evaluated by means of their sensitivity and specificity as well as by the area under ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic), i.e. AUC (Area under Curve). A similar or different prediction of the condition of the newborn by these individual methods was evaluated by the McNamara test of symmetry. In 50 deliveries performed by Cesarean section and 24 forceps deliveries the authors evaluated postnatal pH from umbilical artery and evaluation by Chi-square test. The women in childbed were infused with a tocolytic drug (hexoprenalin) before Cesarean section. All tests were performed at 5% level of significance.\n\n\nRESULTS\nLow level of Apgar score in the 1st minute and less) always indicated CTG, but also a large proportion of normal newborns. STAN, in contrast, well indicates all newborns with a normal point evaluation. The best balanced evaluation of the newborns is provided by FpO2 and there was a significant difference between CTG and FpO2. In evaluating pH from the umbilical artery (pH < 7.20), TCG proved to be most sensitive again but displayed low specificity. STAN was the best predictor of newborns with normal pH. In evaluating high levels of lactate (> 3.7mmol/L) and BE (> -10) and related demonstration of metabolic acidosis STAN proved to be the best predictor. The condition of the newborn evaluated by a neonatologist immediately after birth (medium or heavy depression) was best predicted by FpO2. In deliveries performed by Cesarean section and after the administration of tocolysis the postnatal pH was higher then in forceps deliveries without acute tocolysis. The occurrence of emergencies in the course of a pathological delivery in individual methods is as follows: CTG, FpO2 and STAN.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nEven though CTG displays a very low specificity, this method should not be rejected, since it draws attention of the obstetrician very early to the possibility of developing hypoxia. FpO2 or STAN gives more precision to the situation and demarcates a correct moment for ending the delivery for the indication of fetus hypoxia intra partum. STAN is the best predictor for conditions of developing metabolic acidosis, evaluated postnatally by the level of lactate and BE in fetal blood.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"[Intrapartal fetal monitoring, sensitivity and specificity of methods].","doi":"","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"Ceska gynekologie"}

The data were inputted and analyzed by RevMan 4.2.8 software supplied by the Cochrane Collaboration. Results Eight trials ranked high quality were included. Meta-analysis of the treatment of condyloma acuminatum with 5% imiquimod cream showed the clinical effective rates were significantly different between 5% imiquimod cream and placebo, while were not between 5% imiquimod and flurouracil cream. No serious systematical adverse reaction was recorded. Conclusion Topical 5% imiquimod cream is an effective and safe regimen for the treatment of condyloma acuminatum.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"A meta-analysis of the effectiveness of 5% imiquimod cream in the treatment of condyloma acuminatum","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Theanine formation was stimulated by the addition of Mn2+ to the mixture for the coupling. The addition of Mg2+ was less effective. In a mixture containing a larger amount of yeast cells with a fixed level of GS, glucose (the energy source) was consumed rapidly, resulting in a decrease in the final yield of theanine. On the other hand, an increase in GS amounts increased theanine formation in a mixture with a fixed amount of yeast cells. High concentrations of ethylamine enhanced theanine formation whereas inhibited yeast fermentation of sugar and the two contrary effects of ethylamine caused a high yield of theanine based on glucose consumed. In an improved reaction mixture containing 200 mM sodium glutamate, 1,200 mM ethylamine, 300 mM glucose, 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), 5 mM MnCl2, 5 mM AMP, 100 units/ml GS, and 60 mg/ml yeast cells, approximately 170 mM theanine was formed in 48 h.","inCitations":["a36e3c52d43c42201a3956dc5e0155ad2c37da7f","72cf00a9c7fda0193b386fa1e656cb5755c28976","be5d3905fcfff7998996028c1eff907b9bbdc1cc","2c67ab6354250790d5c51e143d754d6717a8e59b","046ad96e69511c3c8369adb06f04752a94810546","fb5ceb2883e492597d752b4ca547c6114bffed52","12b8f338a6de7f487df5b7404f232dcc0e2a7a86","3a20ca3f29581da9a59b05df7c5a494a18df1993","bdbf4cb50dc8fce792eb2bbaa292d64de2f1181a","818ad65b90e96cd048766cd51c1f9e1a1337b192","21fc1dde9c7506a98e9743f28b62a99a450d4bdf","95bcb17d77f186d7116e5b37494a79b555944fa9","98845256de885fb40f10cf6155307c41f9d8d169","821f31c7303d17a45c08f436255eddd0caed2b6b","467fe5432a106b0b7835e158a65c7446845be97a","f7e3207a2eea965ab979963887633139738e178c","0f08a9c044c57d6aa568c0e318581553f101f713","c33ea933abd4192145907163fbcf26f0eebd4c08"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Theanine production by coupled fermentation with energy transfer employing Pseudomonas taetrolens Y-30 glutamine synthetase and baker's yeast cells.","doi":"10.1271/bbb.69.784","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1271/bbb.69.784","venue":"Bioscience, biotechnology, and biochemistry"}

Nachdem die Deutsche Bank AG und die Commerzbank AG am 17.03.2019 bekannt gegeben haben, dass sie in ergebnisoffene Gesprache uber einen moglichen Zusammenschluss eintreten (vgl. Kroner et al. 2019), sind die Informationen, die hieruber an die Offentlichkeit gelangen, eher sparlich. Spekulationen und Analysen uber die Themen, die dort vermeintlich besprochen werden, sind hingegen zahlreich. Kritiker und Befurworter einer potenziellen Fusion wechseln sich in der medialen Berichterstattung mit ihren Argumentationen fur oder gegen einen Zusammenschluss regelmasig ab. Man duzt sich, heist es aus der einen Ecke (vgl. Maisch und Osman 2019), ein Vorstandvorsitzender fur das Gesamtunternehmen stehe bereits fest, aus der anderen (vgl. Maisch 2019b). Und dann sind da auch noch die Mitarbeiter, die unter dem Slogan \"Getrennt in den Farben, gemeinsam in den Zielen\" ihrem Unmut uber die Gesprache Luft machen (vgl. Osman und Kroner 2019b), bei der Zahl, die uber den moglichen Personalabbau kursiert, nicht weiter verwunderlich. Doch die Deutsche Bank und die Commerzbank halten sich bedeckt. Uber eine Tendenz, in welche Richtung die Gesprache sich tatsachlich entwickeln, ob sie vertieft oder abgebrochen werden, ist nichts zu vernehmen. Die grose Frage, die im Raum steht, lautet: \"Lohnt sich eine Fusion der beiden grosen deutschen Geldhauser oder lohnt sie sich nicht?\" An diesem Punkt knupft die vorliegende Arbeit an. Sie soll einen Eindruck daruber vermitteln, welche Punkte hinter verschlossenen Turen moglicherweise betrachtet werden, welche Synergien aus einer Fusion zu erwarten sind, aber auch, mit welchen Kosten die Realisierung verbunden sein kann. Letztlich soll ein Urteil gefallt werden, ob und unter welchen Bedingungen zu erwarten ist, dass ein Zusammenschluss tatsachlich in Betracht gezogen werden kann. Zunachst werden hierfur die beiden potenziellen Fusionspartner kurz vorgestellt und allgemeine Begrifflichkeiten definiert sowie Arten und Motive von Fusionen identifiziert. Da die Beurteilung der Vorteilhaftigkeit der Fusion im Rahmen einer Unternehmensbewertung erfolgt, wird anschliesend aufgezeigt, welche Verfahren sich fur die Bewertung von Banken eignen und welche Besonderheiten hierbei zu berucksichtigen sind. Im Anschluss werden sowohl die Deutsche Bank als auch die Commerzbank einzeln anhand von zwei unterschiedlichen Verfahren bewertet. Danach wird in zwei verschiedenen Fusionsszenarien der Unternehmenswert fur das entstehende Gesamtunternehmen bestimmt und mit den Ergebnissen aus den Einzelbewertungen verglichen, um uber die Vorteilhaftigkeit des Zusammenschlusses zu entscheiden. Schlussendlich werden die Ergebnisse kritisch gewurdigt, und es wird ein Fazit gezogen.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Deutsche Bank AG und Commerzbank AG: Neubewertung der Unternehmen im Rahmen einer potenziellen Bankenfusion","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

The contact formation is based on a liquid‐phase epitaxy process of Sb‐doped Si from Au solution. Measured contact resistivities range around 3×10−2 Ω cm2 and are at least one order of magnitude higher than what is expected from the solid solubility of Sb in Si. The discrepancy stems from local inhomogeneous etching and epitaxial regrowth of the (100)‐oriented Si surface by and from the Au solution. Only a small fraction of the macroscopic contact area is doped by Sb and contributes to current transport across the Au/Si(100) interface.","inCitations":["75feb9afb58e2f0b6671b933c2a5d13510697c0e","dd133730a01aa97f698db616a4950416f9ce75a8","5571cb77ca1072b6e425f747456426042e976c6c"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Low‐temperature ohmic Au/Sb contacts to n‐type Si","doi":"10.1063/1.356425","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1063/1.356425","venue":""}

Notably, these studies are also providing new concepts for the design of potential small-molecule therapeutics targeting CRLs and for the use of CRLs to degrade \"undruggable\" proteins.

The authors briefly discuss needs assessment and its associated components—organization analysis, task analysis, and person analysis—noting a range of issues that may be revealed at any of the three stages of analysis. We agree with all of the elements discussed in that section; however, we think that one particularly important component of the organization analysis—link to strategy—was not explicitly discussed. Here, we argue that linking organizational learning and training efforts to business strategy is well positioned to play a very critical role in the overall effectiveness of sexual harassment and assault training. A thorough needs assessment is crucial to ensuring training effectiveness and efficiency (Brown, 2002), and organization analysis is a vital piece to that assessment: “Organization analysis involves determining the appropriateness of training given the organization’s strategic goals, environment, resources, and characteristics” (Brown, 2017, p. 1647). As this definition indicates, the organization’s strategic goals should guide planning for and carrying out necessary employee training. For training to be effective, it must support organizational strategy, ensuring that training objectives are directly aligned. Everything from the type of training needed to ensuring that resources are in place to meet training needs to securing buy-in from members of the organization and management are dependent on the overall strategic goals of the company. Ultimately, the aim is to provide employee training that will help execute company strategy (Smith, 2008). Establishing the link between sexual harassment training and organizational goals—such as improving workplace climate, higher productivity, or improved organizational reputation— provides a number of notable benefits both for those wishing to implement the training (i.e., I-O psychologists, HR professionals, training personnel) and for the organization and its members. As indicated above, strategic alignment of training not only ensures that training supports the organization’s mission and facilitates the attainment of organizational goals (e.g., Arthur, Bennett, Edens, & Bell, 2003; Reed & Vakola, 2006) but also helps to secure management support and corresponding resources, which are crucial in the training design process and in ensuring the success of training. At the onset of training, in particular, the importance of organizational buy-in and garnering adequate resources cannot be overstated (Noe, 2017). Not only do senior leaders have the authority to institute training policies and practices, but meta-analytic results demonstrate that organizational buy-in established during organization analysis, and management support in particular, enhance trainees’ motivation to learn and to apply learned skills on the job (Colquitt,","inCitations":["76e98e15d668b1f457525b49c2f765090762afda"],"pdfUrls":["https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/41FC329585F7E09A3EC579F2CAB3FA24/S1754942619000142a.pdf/improving_sexual_harassment_and_sexual_assault_training_effectiveness_by_aligning_training_efforts_with_business_strategy.pdf"],"title":"Improving sexual harassment and sexual assault training effectiveness by aligning training efforts with business strategy","doi":"10.1017/iop.2019.14","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1017/iop.2019.14","venue":""}

Metrics with good representation of the Human Visual System (HVS) will present more accurate evaluation. In this paper we propose a perceptual based objective metric for 2D videos for 3D video quality evaluation. The proposed Perceptual Quality Metric (PQM) shows better results for 3D video quality evaluation and outperforms the Video Quality Metric (VQM); as it is sensitive to slight changes in image degradation and error quantification starts at pixel level right up to the sequence level.

Galactosamine (2% or less) was found in T. emersonii and T. rotundus and no galactosamine in the other species. Sequential fractionation of the cell walls with alkali and acid gave several polysaccharidic fractions. The main differences among species were found in the alkali-soluble fraction at 20° (F1). This fraction represented 8 to 33.2% of the whole cell wall and was characterized as an α-glucan in T. bacillisporus, T. emersonii, T. luteus and T. rotundus (Group A) and as a β-galactofuranosyl containing glucan in T. ohiensis and T. stipitatus (Group B). The alkali-insoluble residue (F4) represented the bulk of the cell wall in all species tested (33.2% to 57.3%) and was characterized as a β-glucan/chitin complex.

Tais mudancas e \ntransformacoes refletem em demandas nos servicos da enfermagem e saude por essa \npopulacao crescente, abrindo novos campos de trabalho para a enfermagem. Frente ao \nexposto, surgiu o interesse em se realizar este estudo, que teve como objetivo analisar os \nprocessos eticos de enfermagem envolvendo idosos no Conselho Regional de Enfermagem \n(COREN-DF), no periodo de 2005 a 2015, quanto ao perfil dos profissionais envolvidos, as \ndenuncias e os denunciantes envolvidos. Alem disso, pretendeu analisar os principais artigos \nviolados do codigo de etica, as penalidades aplicadas, os locais e tipos de instituicao de saude \ncom maior numero de ocorrencias eticas. Metodo: Foi realizada uma revisao de literatura \nabordando temas como envelhecimento, vulnerabilidade, o desenvolvimento da enfermagem, \nos codigos de etica, os erros de enfermagem e seu reflexo no campo do direito civil e penal. \nEm seguida, foi realizada uma busca ativa nos processos eticos finalizados envolvendo idosos \ndo COREN-DF, no periodo de 2005 a 2015. Estes foram coletados por meio de instrumento \nde coleta de dados. Os resultados foram trabalhados em estatistica \ndescritiva. Resultado: Foram localizados 144 processos conclusos pelo COREN-DF e, \ndestes, apenas 18 envolviam idosos e somente estes que entraram neste estudo. Dentre os \nmais relevantes resultados, destaca-se o elevado numero de tecnicos de enfermagem, com 12 \ndos infratores. Ha, nesse numero, prevalencia de profissionais com menor tempo de inscricao \nno COREN-DF, com 9. As denuncias, em sua maioria, foram realizadas pelos familiares, em \n8 dos casos. Os erros mais evidenciados foram: negligencia, 8, seguidos de maus tratos, 7. \nComo local de ocorrencia da infracao, destaca-se a residencia dos idosos, 10. \nConclusao: Entende-se, a partir da analise dos dados, que, felizmente, a populacao esta \ncomecando a denunciar as infracoes eticas as quais sao expostas. Deve-se pensar, entretanto, \nem quantas dessas infracoes nao sao reportadas. Atraves das denuncias e de estudos como \nesse, o servico de enfermagem pode ser aperfeicoado, dai sua importância. Sendo tecnicos de \nenfermagem a categoria mais denunciada, conclui-se que e necessario que sejam realizados \nmais trabalhos de educacao continuada e humanizacao. Trabalho esse que, claro, deve ser \nfeito nao so com esses profissionais, mas com todos os envolvidos. Acredita-se que este \nestudo possa instigar os profissionais de enfermagem a pensar acerca da sua pratica \nprofissional e a respeito das possiveis implicacoes eticas e legais decorrentes da assistencia \naos idosos, contribuindo para que a pratica de enfermagem seja mais cautelosa e eticamente \nresponsavel.","inCitations":["1f34632dc22a62a852e0e0de8eac8f3feb3f0538"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Processos éticos de enfermagem envolvendo idosos no Distrito Federal, Brasil: 2005 a 2015","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Knowing a field exactly from finite measurements alone is therefore impossible. Prior information on the field is essential for field inference, but will not specify the field entirely. An information theory for fields is needed to join the measurement and prior information into probabilistic statements on field configurations. Such an information field theory (IFT) is built on the language of mathematical physics, in particular on field theory and statistical mechanics. IFT permits the mathematical derivation of optimal imaging algorithms, data analysis methods, and even computer simulation schemes. The application of such IFT algorithms to astronomical datasets provides high fidelity images of the Universe and facilitates the search for subtle statistical signals from the Big Bang. The concepts of IFT might even pave the road to novel computer simulations that are aware of their own uncertainties.","inCitations":["fdf883e4028b255d594e9478e9d17051783f94b2","664a4f1a6fb9792a86477cee29f1443e08a45ca7","2f8583f884923f079a40a76f94febd9c4f672a74","ef53dad8324e46d28eee080b4e26fdaaa88acf83"],"pdfUrls":["http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1804.03350","https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.03350v2.pdf","http://arxiv.org/abs/1804.03350"],"title":"Information theory for fields","doi":"10.1002/andp.201800127","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1002/andp.201800127","venue":"ArXiv"}

In this paper, an innovative chatter suppression method based on particle damping technique is attempted to reduce chatter in boring tool and thereby study the improvement in surface finish and tool wear. Granules of steel are used. The granules were filled into the boring bar through the hole drilled at the rear of the boring tool. Experiments were conducted with different tool overhang values, spindle speeds and feed rates. It was therefore established that particle damping plays a leading role in improving surface finish and reducing tool wear in boring operation","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Improving the Surface roughness and Flank wear of the boring process using particle damped boring bars","doi":"10.1016/j.matpr.2018.10.062","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.matpr.2018.10.062","venue":""}

Although a review of these measurements finds strong support for the influence of waves-and, in particular, for the predictions of large-eddy simulations, including the Craik-Leibovich vortex force-there are insufficient data to give definitive support to a new paradigm.","inCitations":["eac8f04319e017f38603a43398a9400ca111a173","794e3010f67d12d1479e9134a9c7c89a7a5d9c63","6239a302c85ba633b592dae7455b9e128f72f850","26b64b03a68a3c6d4547320f5830ae01dc2e8a05","ba5ecc47f9d96b63bac7471fccec6e8225b79d5f","ff44d0beea79d6aff1265e4bc9a231fd134c60b5","3149b0b6508b1c37108b017740a8477c7078d823","31c2bffe8249662075339c36c7a26fb78e442159","862e4676ea7c031ad32baf2b33e833703b2c97e0","100f4f4119cd8a542f9c9d358694f1d576d57932","b91e6cab5e535cabb88eb9d0de94943093088083","6a364ce6e1d2ed58f5c8b3e9a24a7efbc27c2fe8","ad8386d2930cd7539d7ec94a3ae6e53f7de57f2f","0b3673400a1da162f447bb0ec32c433259c9044e","1316e3e046a5a1cd6af23f0d222c8568bc4f2ed2","d3d6682f909edd566bf347301880a40486654556","0f61824b815caa145344edc3a9518d4de50838e6","e6d9a7b998aacd60a70588ca4dd8aaacf63e0c7d","a7248a5095e88803dee950e9488120ce4b40d64e","8b97e78a0d773fa63b6fde24d0948f6d58ef19d9","052dc6ea342eefa5e7ca32234c734b144a04536a","53c7a3f565f57016842b26f09fecc6a32e5539d3","c98d791078dfa7f58941e45346d1885fb57cf3ed","2084e116a0a0d5093bf7bf1e48f1752b68552a0f","1552085a77b2f02d0b0badc7736d9d97b35db9d3","e19240dc5170345eeba66c9a869dd4d419e74d42","5d89aef2b8ce0e6a0d998b3654fe2ad6b4c1dd58","496fa48abd026df01c2e7a995ed8de712d83946e","4aa1a341e804479c0c8d9b77326902f5f35b3aef","c2229c9e5d6f0bdf8b49721ff7203076e7dec0a8","a232f317f4ae367b6882172d95d03035a4824f85","93100fa88c576783f2c10b004810c1f4789eed11","715ef22e030342de8cb293e356baf6f9890fe914","e5d76bf832218f422d128c2c2d8f9c509a29b1a8","27fe2ac5031c4d99310f794cffd50d07c17517ac","1ac2fec338d361efdcc14c68b9533ae6cbe8c882","b54154e29265f501c85b958516a823b5b6111a7e","9deb9ee23b86e25792e024e888059d8b0e51f33c"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Turbulence in the upper-ocean mixed layer.","doi":"10.1146/annurev-marine-010213-135138","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-marine-010213-135138","venue":"Annual review of marine science"}

The recent paper by Cheng and Xiong (2014) provides strong empirical evidence that hedgers indeed speculate in agricultural futures markets. Using CFTC data on positions by categories of traders, the authors show that ‘non-commercial’ traders (hedgers) indeed respond to price changes.

Pemerintah mulai membangun citra Banyuwangi sebagai kabupaten \npariwisata unggulan di Jawa Timur ditandai dengan slogan baru “sunrise of java”, yang ditujukan \nkepada wisatawan baik lokal maupun internasional. Buah kakao sudah dikenal masyarakat di \nkabupaten Banyuwangi sejak jaman penjajahan Belanda. Salah satu wilayah di kabupaten \nBanyuwangi yang terkenal akan buah kakao adalah kecamatan Glenmore. Daerah tersebut \nmerupakan kawasan industri perkebunan peninggalan Belanda. Di sekitaran kecamatan Glenmore \nterdapat patung berbentuk buah kakao. \nSebagian besar masyarakat di kecamatan ini berprofesi sebagai petani buah kakao, tetapi hasil \nbuah kakao yang dihasilkan oleh petani tidak dapat diproses secara maksimal karena terbatasnya \nteknologi dan pengetahuan. Dalam pembuatan cokelat, buah kakao adalah bahan dasar \npembuatannya. Rumitnya proses pengolahan buah kakao tersebut membuat sebagian besar petani \ntradisional tidak mengetahui proses pengolahan tersebut. Pada saat ini produk yang dihasikan oleh \npetani hanya sebatas bahan mentah yang telah dikeringkan, sehingga nilai harga jualnya rendah. \nLuasnya area lahan baru buah kakao tidak diimbangi dengan persediaan produksi bibit buah kakao \nunggul. Hal tersebut menyulitkan para petani untuk mendapatkan bibit - bibit kakao unggulan. \nKeterkaitan dalam upaya peningkatan potensi pariwisata dan perkebunan di kabupaten \nBanyuwangi menjadi salah satu faktor diperlukannya suatu tempat penelitian dan pariwisata berbasis \nagrowisata yang terjangkau bagi masyarakat umum khususnya masyarakat Banyuwangi. Tempat ini \nmenggabungkan antara penelitian dan pariwisata yang memanfaatkan potensi buah kakao di \nkabupaten Banyuwangi. Berdasarkan kenyataan tersebut, maka keberadaan sebuah Pusat Penelitian \ndan Agrowisata Kakao menjadi sangat penting. \nDari segi penelitian, dalam tempat ini dilakukan proses penelitian dan pembibitan buah kakao \nunggulan sehingga bisa menghasilkan buah kakao yang berkualitas baik. Kemudian dari segi \npariwisata, tempat ini disuguhkan cara pengolahan kakao hingga menjadi coklat sehingga dapat \nmeningkatkan sumber daya masyarakat tentang kakao itu sendiri. \nMetode yang digunakan meliputi pengumpulan data melalui survey, studi literatur, \ndokumentasi, wawancara dan studi banding. Selanjutnya data yang ada dioleh melalui analisis \nberdasarkan kajian tema dan kajian integrasi sehingga terciptalah konsep perancangan. Pada \nakhirnya perancangan Pusat Penelitian dan Agrowisata Kakao ini bertema arsitektur ekologi yang \nmengacu tentang kepedulian terhadap alam dan sekitarnya.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Pusat Penelitian Dan Agrowisata Kakaodi Banyuwangi","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Different types of multiple access techniques, such as the ones based on multicarrier CDMA and OFDM (orthogonal frequency division multiplexing) have been proposed. There is a need for functional integration of the multiple networks, and, with the evolution of IPv6 and QoS support for IP networks, an IP based interconnectivity is best suited. A QoS aware adaptive radio resource management technique based on multi-code multicarrier CDMA is discussed. We develop a novel radio access method and develop algorithms for allocating and controlling radio network resources so that system performance can be maximized and guaranteed QoS for multimedia services can be provided within the DiffServ environment.","inCitations":["10a9eb3b5fbbba6ac65bd26f818d809def0d2b21","54539b90618d72fee9674905e7066dd239573280"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"A study of DiffServ based QoS issues in next generation mobile networks","doi":"10.1109/CCECE.2004.1347720","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCECE.2004.1347720","venue":"Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering 2004 (IEEE Cat.

We assessed the frequency of mutations in 17 predisposition genes, including BRCA1 and BRCA2, in a large cohort of patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) unselected for family history of breast or ovarian cancer to determine the utility of germline genetic testing for those with TNBC.\n\n\nPATIENTS AND METHODS\nPatients with TNBC (N = 1,824) unselected for family history of breast or ovarian cancer were recruited through 12 studies, and germline DNA was sequenced to identify mutations.\n\n\nRESULTS\nDeleterious mutations were identified in 14.6% of all patients. Of these, 11.2% had mutations in the BRCA1 (8.5%) and BRCA2 (2.7%) genes. Deleterious mutations in 15 other predisposition genes were detected in 3.7% of patients, with the majority observed in genes involved in homologous recombination, including PALB2 (1.2%) and BARD1, RAD51D, RAD51C, and BRIP1 (0.3% to 0.5%). Patients with TNBC with mutations were diagnosed at an earlier age (P < .001) and had higher-grade tumors (P = .01) than those without mutations.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nDeleterious mutations in predisposition genes are present at high frequency in patients with TNBC unselected for family history of cancer. Mutation prevalence estimates suggest that patients with TNBC, regardless of age at diagnosis or family history of cancer, should be considered for germline genetic testing of BRCA1 and BRCA2.

Along with developments in basic research and efforts to optimize embryo quality, the improvement of noninvasive and reliable methods to assess uterine receptivity constitutes an important step toward meeting such a challenge. Today, ultrasound-based approaches to evaluate endometrial echogenicity and uterine perfusion and contractility are available for practical use. Increasing evidence indicates that echogenic patterns of the endometrium reflect histologic processes that are involved in the establishment of receptivity. This constitutes a possible explanation for the reported association between premature hyperechogenic patterns of the endometrium and poor implantation rates. Nevertheless, additional studies aiming at correlating further morpho-biochemical events in the endometrium with its echogenicity patterns are needed. Further, developments in vascular assessment by Doppler, Doppler-related, and vascular detection technologies will also be instrumental in monitoring and improving vascular changes that lead to uterine receptivity. Finally, data supporting the hypothesis that uterine contractility, as visualized by ultrasound, influences in vitro fertilization-embryo transfer (IVF-ET) pregnancy rates encourage further investigation on both the regulation and control of uterine contractions. This article discusses some of the advantages and limitations of ultrasonographic assessments of uterine receptivity in the perspective of the new millennium.","inCitations":["f4db8d6613b9445da1a5e027143eb843b68d139c","0e5bbae4313ce4e9e608e1c7c47f3ec170cded15","881e7b769d86b68db5d7f8d190cfa906198dd648","a34915fb1629fdb103dfbb952a4418a347985603","595b0d0bbbec569e5455bf36b07267415658b40d","0e00f3dd9da159f83f01ed1d2193e2975d994662","7d2f2822a42abfdfd682d2471166c012751b9812","3f173f0e5c19644a4da641e6f0e52f7d0299c41d","f260b700960b4de9e61f44b7129958b67561ff61","7021211c38efc9551bab722eed3a1353a41d3baf"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Assessing Uterine Receptivity in 2001","doi":"10.1111/j.1749-6632.2001.tb03802.x","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1749-6632.2001.tb03802.x","venue":""}

A maior parte destes agentes sao compostos organofosforados (OF) que inibem a acetilcolinesterase (AChE), enzima responsavel pelo controle da transmissao dos impulsos nervosos. Ao ser inibida por esses compostos a AChE pode ser reativada, sendo as oximas cationicas as substâncias mais utilizadas para esse processo. Ate o momento nao foi encontrado um agente para tratamento de intoxicacao por OF que seja eficaz contra todos os agentes de guerra quimica conhecidos e contra todos os seus efeitos. Dessa forma, este trabalho tem por objetivo fazer uma revisao sobre os OF, sua utilizacao como agentes de guerra quimica e o processo de inibicao e reativacao da AChE, para motivar o desenvolvimento de novos agentes para defesa contra guerra quimica.

The frictional condition of the jam is given using frictional coefficient as parameters. Further considering the characteristic of microcosmic mechanics around the press area, the reason of ‘gnawing solder' causing the jam is studied based on the model of Kulun friction. Finally an improved design is put forward. The analysis result is consistent well with that from the projector or experiment and offers an effective reference for solving the jam problem.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Research on the frictional mechanism of jam of the airplane projector","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Psoriasis affects 2–4% of the general population. It is a common, chronic, relapsing/remitting, immune-mediated systemic disease characterized by skin lesions including red, scaly patches, papules and plaques, which usually itch. Vitamin D is actually a fat-soluble steroid prohormone that has endocrine, paracrine and autocrine functions. \nAim of the Work: To investigate the level of serum vitamin D in patients with psoriatic arthritis and compare it with patients with psoriasis to show if there is a role of vitamin D in development of arthritis in psoriatic patients or not. \nPatients and Methods: This study is a cross sectional study in which fifty patients with psoriatic arthritis and psoriasis age range 16-50 years selected from those attending the outpatient clinic and inpatients of rheumatology, physical medicine &rehabilitation department, Al-Azhar university hospitals from 2017 to 2018 and divided into two groups: Group (A): (25) patients with psoriatic arthritis were diagnosed according to the criteria for psoriatic arthritis classification “CASPAR criteria”. Group (B): (25) patients with skin psoriasis. In this study we measured of 25 hydroxy vitamin D3 using commercial ELISA kits, ESR, CRP, CBC, Blood urea, serum creatinine, Liver enzymes (SGOT & SGPT), Serum uric acid, Fasting blood glucose, RF, urine analysis, ANA, HCV Ab and HIV Ab. Plain x-ray on both hands postero-anterior view, Plain x-ray on lumbosacral spine antero- posterior and lateral views and Plain x-ray on both sacroiliac joints “cone” view. \nResults: There was female sex predicliction in psoriatic arthritis group. Otherwise, both groups were comparable regarding age, BMI, residence, co-morbid diseases, disease characteristics, and laboratory investigations, except significant increase of WBCs and inflammatory markers (ESR and CRP) in psoriatic arthritis group. Diseases severity was mild in 72%, moderate in 22% and severe in 6.0%; and there was statistically significant increase of moderate and severe disease in PA when compared to psoriasis group. vitamin D was sufficient in 32.0%, insufficient in 34.0% and deficient in 34.0%; and there was no significant difference between psoriasis and PA groups. In addition, vitamin D levels were increased in psoriasis when compared to PA groups. However, the difference was statistically non-significant. No significant relation was found between vitamin D from one side and each of patient characteristics, laboratory investigations (except significant positive correlation with hemoglobin and RBCs), disease characteristics (except significant inverse (negative) correlation with disease duration and disease severity), X-ray findings, and psoriatic arthritis disease activity indices. \nConclusion: Vitamin D deficiency/insufficiency was common among psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis patients and the deficiency was significantly and inversely correlated with disease severity (PASI) and disease duration. Thus, is thought to play a role in development (or a consequence) of psoriasis. On the other hand, there was no correlation with PA disease activity and severity indices. Thus, the association seems to be linked to psoriasis proper. Vitamin D supplementation thought to have a potential therapeutic role in treatment of psoriasis.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Comparative Study of Vitamin D Level between Psoriatic Patients and Psoriatic Arthritis Patients","doi":"10.12816/ejhm.2018.9243","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.12816/ejhm.2018.9243","venue":""}

Whereas others have stressed the actions taken by Presidents Getulio Vargas and Juscelino Kubitschek, I attribute the Bank's remarkable independence to a cadre of innovative civil servants. In this account, independence is measured by control over personnel recruitment, loan allocation, and generation of funds. The considerable control BNDE bureaucrats exercised over personnel recruitment and loan allocation countered their limited control over funding, permitting the Bank to become an independent and effective development institution. Recent scholarship on Latin America has focused on the contribution to economic development of state bureaucracies, operating independently of narrow interests. Most agree that bureaucratic independence is necessary for the implementation of any state-sponsored development strategy. In spite of their importance, we know little about what fosters the creation and institutionalisation of such bureaucracies. The search for answers has led several to re-examine the remarkable experience of Brazil during the presidency of Juscelino Kubitschek (I9 5 6-6 I).1 One of the country's most successful development plans, the * The present research was funded by grants from the Joint Committee on Latin America of the Social Science Research Council and the American Council of Learned Societies, the Inter-American Foundation, and the Fulbright Commission.
