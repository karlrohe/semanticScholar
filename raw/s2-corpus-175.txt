Methods: A descriptive cross-sectional design was adopted using secondary data from the 2012 Korean Welfare Panel Study (KoWePS). The participants were 496 high school students who completed the supplemental survey for children, which included items on career maturity, self-esteem, study stress, teacher attachment, relationship with parents, peer attachment, depression and anxiety. Descriptive statistics, the chi-square-test, the t-test, and a decision tree were used for data analysis. Results: The decision tree identified five final nodes predicting career maturity after forcing self-esteem as the first variable. The highest predicted rate of high career maturity was associated with high self-esteem, experience of career counseling, and high teacher attachment. The lowest predicted rate of high career maturity was associated with low self-esteem and low attachment to friends. Conclusion: Factors influencing career maturity were varied by levels of self-esteem in Korean high school students. Thus, it is necessary to develop different approaches to enhance career maturity according to levels of self-esteem.","inCitations":["454758378abb49bb5ccf102d7e8c75fbb76b279f"],"pdfUrls":["https://www.e-chnr.org/upload/pdf/chnr-25-2-95.pdf"],"title":"A Prediction Model of Factors related to Career Maturity in Korean High School Students","doi":"10.4094/chnr.2019.25.2.95","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.4094/chnr.2019.25.2.95","venue":""}

Self-motivation, committed teachers and discussions with other students were considered to be important for learning. The difference between the groups was that the nurses were focused on their assessments because of lack of time, while the medical students were more learning for life. Their greatest problem was to know what of all knowledge they needed to learn and should focus on.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe motivation must come from the students themselves, but dedicated teachers giving performance feed-back, discussions in different forms and choices of learning and assessment methods enhance enthusiasm and learning. By providing an educational environment that resonates with the students' needs, teachers may be successful in their teaching.","inCitations":["1582b2cf57c254894e8dd472947ae435a92693d4","1ddcd0881751e77ef3de6ba50cce912821c074c9","ee7bcc2dc3d1cb37275f7c7cc0d704f35d3dbb9a","b891854536877f03390c671577986a93189d9726","82c75f5643c99d037c4e52309043c63834c9defa","a224e44f432b07f943d500f62112982417c880eb","e02fc499f64d2378a6472e62e1a8d27741224b33","fef6378ac693e7bfbbe7434e92c9b339bc1b885e","ad81f0ed407aaea54e6891ac13bc0b16a980719c","94e53bc713219f861b5f36c9123017434647fafe","a94528a45b80625ce7dd8b8f9db4e426ed2cf16d","4c40ec995eea992b1209e51cf4ac7d298304fff6","30bda300b0fb6c2ec34d3b0cd1a94a37d4b79379","d03d123becdbe9ee66a1899f6c6c538e9847af79","4ae9d6b9ca8928ca9c00890eae537b25d4f25a57","5e509664e8e0c34a6d7f9022fe04ee862a339406","19ef3d880ce356f75bc3e62f55f13e04a2b0db3b","5db7d442caa10f4a9ed4d42c01173952f25327bf","74a38c0a43c2eccded72ab1dbabadbb716f66fb9","16a1d573e3cc4421d57c7ab86737d5ff45af0564","db2be0e49392d34a68c53d9753cb8ef3efe618a7","3eb455db3c7c0477e46dcad72d57385d55d35a22","6b6e102677bdd58b8cda3cea96fc10fa4fec5d0f","54fb837f63e8efe6fd772a5f14bf1127a450a429","a7559830f18ce18d10f13a84550768aea2f6e4c6","990bf97f7e63370800091b50379ce05c7d0d2024","a2eac09b7c55263ff301f8dbdac62d7753ed6cf3","d088f01aaceb41fbe365929096a3e26e0228ff51","e441a7e9e3dc0bcd53474aa15ef5b263b1a3f7d3","529662e5d3f967a435e373c2d6010554f0d79c28","ac894ef0ad56be6773fcb1ff64a67b74e2652b46","f4e197cbb54975d56725a244056f5a701f8e8fb1","e302a4feabf5e7762ab2c2aebdde70d987adb90b","14e4fb5a2782bf9d39f789a4701519b5f2b37c95","1b6fd37acc7be17b147868c5efb9df44a158d6dc","f28b3d5db9ffc6c4821745c1bc26dae41d736255","89f995eabc504e7584b7bdbce2cb05a654b9f178","d449f5188e68b08ec0b2fb894dff038e2dedeeed","6673b2159fc11dff684c50448a145b51e965178c","d9f44ed0a6a5aa8ecea3287c0efb5ed97f3f2abb","e5c231864f46d71f79e2c9ac836c67a2a47368a8","52ff5660b95aa3482f5daddf3dbc12f63fb06947","a41aaa3e91eced4bdc43476101f64e256915186d","42718a02efd5b61fe62e79a7de52b7670f9a19bf","d9bb300a321ca24abb852541dfe596f08bcac04d","3f8f5d1e4a3ce844041fa5fbf9ffcab080863f48","94b060292f8271de5b7f0cc8a89edc3ecbdcf3aa","d69462d6850dce4840f2c0f618133a75f5daea7f","4c1f9ab7bdea58788aa51398c365878a3935c5a2","9985ec24a3e94dc272d25909906393d64937d5cc"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"The nursing and medical students motivation to attain knowledge.","doi":"10.1016/j.nedt.2009.07.005","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nedt.2009.07.005","venue":"Nurse education today"}

This paper proposes a multi-codebook piecewise vector quantized approximation (MCPVQA), in which we generate a codebook for each class using PVQA on considering the difference between categories. Thus, each codebook contains the corresponding class information. In addition, training time series do not need to reconstruct for classification tasks. MCPVQA needs to only reconstruct an unseen time series using these codebooks and predict its class label according to reconstruction errors in each class. Experimental results on three time series datasets demonstrate that MCPVQA is more powerful to represent time series and has better classification performance than PVQA.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/ICTAI.2015.65"],"title":"Time Series Classification Based on Multi-codebook Piecewise Vector Quantized Approximation","doi":"10.1109/ICTAI.2015.65","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICTAI.2015.65","venue":"2015 IEEE 27th International Conference on Tools with Artificial Intelligence (ICTAI)"}

One of the most important steps of GNFS is to select a good polynomial pair. A standard way of polynomial selection (being used in factoring RSA challenge numbers) is to select a nonlinear polynomial for algebraic sieving and a linear polynomial for ra- tional sieving. There is another method called a nonlinear method which selects two polynomials of the same degree greater than one. In this pa- per, we generalize Montgomery's method (12) using geometric progression (GP) (mod N) to construct a pair of nonlinear polynomials. We also in- troduce GP of length d + k with 1 ÔøΩ kd 1 and show that we can construct polynomials of degree d having common root (mod N), where the number of such polynomials and the size of the coefficientscan be precisely determined.","inCitations":["5f33c5b53b9f8781ed83e4f62b819dde155f3b63","e8e8f6accf115fbd12717eba35619568d5199a80","eaf52a6169943dfd23cada545a53f6880734b351","1b827276e6d38bce1f224a2e6fb3db0f80856591","929f232485e69d14f553706b0639d4266e27ee59","b14973f910b77c81f9c0f69fc05f1b4e2741b793","46210411ae8a4ad68e63a95db20e9af4c3289e1c"],"pdfUrls":["http://eprint.iacr.org/2011/292.pdf","http://eprint.iacr.org/2011/292","https://eprint.iacr.org/2011/292.pdf"],"title":"On Nonlinear Polynomial Selection and Geometric Progression (mod N) for Number Field Sieve","doi":"10.4134/BKMS.2016.53.1.001","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.4134/BKMS.2016.53.1.001","venue":"IACR Cryptology ePrint Archive"}

Clearly, the government‚Äôs efforts to obtain such recordings have continued. Yet there is no evidence that the contents of the recorded calls have been analyzed any more efficiently. Perhaps analysis by conventional means would be of limited value in any event. After all, terror suspects tend to avoid words that might alarm intelligence agents, thus ‚Äúoutsmarting‚Äù conventional mining programs, which heavily rely on wordspotting techniques. One solution is the application of a new natural language understanding method, known as Sequence Package Analysis, which can transcend the limitations of basic parsing methods by mapping out the generic conversational sequence patterns found in the dialog.

We worked with a Soccer team, consisting of 11 players (4 midfield players, 4 defenders, 2 forwards and 1 goalkeeper of Liga Deportiva Universitaria de Guayaquil). The anthropometric assessment denoted the homogeneity behavior of the study team against the Elite team of Costa Rica with just muscle percentage variations of ¬± 1.5 kg in midfield players and defenders according to the Elite standard. The biochemical markers didn‚Äôt show critical abnormalities; however the 9% denoted a little excess of Total Cholesterol, factor to consider when formulating meal plans. The clinical assessment didn‚Äôt find pathologies. Finally, the dietary assessment indicates that the caloric intake of the 91% of the team is underneath of energy requirements with an average deficit of about 1000 Kcal and the remaining 9% with an excess of about 2000 kcal.

We have fairly fixed notions of practice without theory-action without reflection, hand-to-mouth existence, meeting problems as they arise, disdain of plans or strategy, and so on. Of theory without practice there seems but one common ideatheory that because of abstraction or irrelevance cannot be applied. Plato told us the story of Thales of Miletus who, gazing at the stars, fell into a well. A little maid laughed to see such sport. Her laughter still rings in our ears, reminding us to practice navigating the earth rather than contemplate the stars. Theory without practice, then, seems to be theory that cannot be applied. Applied to what? Applied to problems. Which problems? Problems that arise among men or in the community. Who there defines a problem? Not to get bogged down at the start, let us say merely that some men do or that some part of the community does. We can also conceive of a theory not being applied because it seems farfetched or too costly or immoral, or because the moment for its need is not yet at hand. These are not the main objections, even though they all have a bearing in one way or another on the ideas we are about to discuss. The main objections are usually the ones already mentioned-theory irrelevant or too abstract. Abstractness, for our purposes, can be dismissed. It means either that the theory cannot be understood-a matter of communication, we assume-or that steps are lacking to bring the theory down to the applied level. We are really back to the question of application. Either a theory has relevance but for one reason or another cannot be put into practice, or it has no relevance at all and that is the end of that. This latter category is the interesting one. What kind of theory is it that has no relevance to anything? The theory I have found to fit the bill is a theory that has as its only aim the seeking of knowledge. This is not a theory, one might say with a smile, this is philosophy itself. So it is, or at least, so it was. The search for knowledge without concern for possibly applying that knowledge, for putting it to action, used to be a definition of philosophy. But for some time now it seems to have taken on a different hue. Whether we date this change from Bacon's \"knowledge is power,\" power that can be applied to man and earth, or from Marx's contention that philosophy ought to busy itself with changing, not interpreting the world, or take an earlier point in Occam or Petrus Aureoli or Galileo, does not directly concern us now. Nor need we ask whether philosophy should occupy itself with applying knowledge. I prefer instead to spend this time on the ensemble of ideas that goes by the name of the contemplative life. This paper will accent first the philosophical rather than the theological (though similarities will be obvious), second the West rather than the East (though here too relationships will be apparent), and then the Greek rather than the later course of European ideas. In several ways the argument may be unhistorical. It may lay more stress on certain parts of philosophical schools than is usually done in the history of thought. It may sometime use words that belong to a more modern vocabulary. I should not like an idea to lose its pertinence in a cloud of antique veils. Philosophical circles today do not write much about the contemplative life of the West. Hardly a political philosopher can be found to take it seriously. The stress falls, as you know, on empiricism, pragmatism, positivism, experiment, theories of action or practice. What is the contemplative life? Perhaps it is not a theory at all. How can it be? If a political theory is an explanation of political phenomena or a set of principles of a political science, the contemplative life is not a political theory, at least not the contemplative life one calls up from the warehouse of memory. Yet a number of celebrated political theorists got involved with it, among them the giants, Plato and Aristotle. The word they had for it was the bios theoretikos. Had it not come down to us from the Latin, we might have called it the theoretical life. So theory comes from a word meaning behold or contemplate. And the prototypes of this life were the Ionian philosophers-Thales is one-whose absorption in knowledge for its own sake inspired the Academy and the Peripatetic school. I propose to look more closely at the bios theoretikos as it was conceived by Plato and Aristotle but specially in the particular turn given it by Epicurus. Not the polemical Epicurus, nor the one famous for his pleasures, but the Epicurus of peace and quiet, the one of whom it was said, \"No one is less epicurean","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Politics and the Contemplative Life","doi":"10.2307/1978305","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.2307/1978305","venue":""}

This paper introduces a scalable decentralized control algorithm to navigate a group of mobile robots (swarm) into a predefined shape in 2D space. The proposed architecture uses artificial forces to control mobile agents into the shape and spread them inside the shape while avoiding inter-member collisions. The theoretical analysis of the swarm behavior describes the motion of the complete swarm and individual members in relevant situations. We use computer simulated case studies to verify the theoretical assertions and to demonstrate the robustness of the swarm under external disturbances such as death of agents, change of shape etc. Also the performance of the proposed distributed swarm control architecture was investigated in the presence of realistic implementation issues such as localization errors, communication range limitations, boundedness of forces etc.","inCitations":["00194e397fdddef0ade087b776da6eac93053f3c","41fb2db742f3b706ce4450dcc9dc683356734c6e","278a4b368d527d6846195d2660b8e4b5a5622b55","17ef2d35b21c1e64b824b03c310f0602ed8c2354","fc24d29e5de45e21b25c4d3c2db367ae2b8281d4","01fd06a2cb7a19257ce01932a4e218b4a5c89079","0053f4764a10046d5bd8083f47880e554b0273cd","3089205859d39bfa753ea766e1837b9b2dcf70ca"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.researchgate.net/profile/Pubudu_Pathirana/publication/221786517_Formations_of_Robotic_Swarm_An_Artificial_Force_Based_Approach/links/0deec51beeb6b13285000000.pdf","https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Pubudu_Pathirana/publication/221786517_Formations_of_Robotic_Swarm_An_Artificial_Force_Based_Approach/links/0deec51beeb6b13285000000.pdf","http://cdn.intechweb.org/pdfs/11315.pdf","http://cdn.intechopen.com/pdfs-wm/6284.pdf","http://cdn.intechopen.com/pdfs/11315/InTech-Formations_of_robotic_swarm_an_artificial_force_based_approach.pdf","http://cdn.intechweb.org/pdfs/6284.pdf"],"title":"Formations of Robotic Swarm: An Artificial Force Based Approach","doi":"10.5772/9707","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.5772/9707","venue":""}

However, dairy intakes are reportedly declining in developed populations, potentially due to concerns regarding Na and SFA in dairy foods, particularly cheese. This could impact other nutrient intakes. The present study used data from the National Adult Nutrition Survey (NANS) to (1) examine dairy intakes, with a specific focus on cheese, and (2) to examine the contribution of cheese to population nutrient intakes. The NANS captured detailed dietary intake data from a nationally representative sample (n 1500) between 2008 and 2010 using 4-d semi-weighed food diaries; 99¬∑9% of the population reported dairy intake. Mean daily population dairy intake was 290¬∑0 (SD 202¬∑1) g. Dairy products provided 8¬∑7% of the population intake of reported dietary Na, 19¬∑8% SFA, 39% Ca, 34¬∑5% vitamin B12 and 10¬∑5% Mg. Cheese alone provided 3¬∑9% Na intake, 9¬∑1% Ca, 12¬∑6% retinol, 8¬∑3% SFA, 3¬∑7% protein, 3¬∑4% vitamin B12 and 3¬∑2% riboflavin. High dairy consumers had greater Ca and Mg intakes per 10 MJ, greater total energy intake, greater percentage of energy from carbohydrate and SFA and lower Na intakes compared with low dairy consumers. Similar trends were observed for high consumers of cheese for most nutrients except Na. These results demonstrate that dairy and cheese are important contributors to nutrient intakes of public health interest, such as Ca and B12. Our analysis also demonstrated that food-based dietary guidelines recommending lower-fat versions of dairy products are warranted.","inCitations":["971c7d2f935071a7927c928a7f9761fa3300fa8c","8c072820496fcbb639c8ad16679678e68ccd8ade","08cb46058f8372a0a065a22e1bd5e581a6241c57","07bcf59568244543bc45b787dbee61e541cfbdf9","64164db0edaa7b71ca832666748574438de69bf5","aa54ee1a5a80fc358c7b33a2f8732d44cf6bd31d"],"pdfUrls":["https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/8626D6694F3E83DE2CAA213F73DB792C/S000711451500495Xa.pdf/an_overview_of_the_contribution_of_dairy_and_cheese_intakes_to_nutrient_intakes_in_the_irish_diet_results_from_the_national_adult_nutrition_survey.pdf","https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/S000711451500495X"],"title":"An overview of the contribution of dairy and cheese intakes to nutrient intakes in the Irish diet: results from the National Adult Nutrition Survey.","doi":"10.1017/S000711451500495X","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1017/S000711451500495X","venue":"The British journal of nutrition"}

Recently, rising proportions of vancomycin resistance in enterococcal infections have been reported worldwide. This study aims to describe current epidemiological trends of VREF in German hospitals and to identify factors that are associated with an increased likelihood of vancomycin resistance in clinical E. faecium isolates.Methods2012 to 2017 data from routine vancomycin susceptibility testing of 35,906 clinical E. faecium isolates from 148 hospitals were analysed using data from the German Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance System. Descriptive statistical analyses and uni- and multivariable regression analyses were performed to investigate the impact of variables, such as year of sampling, age and region, on vancomycin resistance in clinical E. faecium isolates.ResultsFrom 2014 onwards the proportions of clinical E. faecium isolates exhibiting resistance to vancomycin increased from 11.2% (95% confidence interval [CI] 9.4‚Äì13.3%) to 26.1% (95% CI 23.1‚Äì29.4%) in 2017. The rise of VREF proportions is primarily observed in the southern regions of Germany, whereas northern regions do not show a major increase. In the Southwest and Southeast, VREF proportions increased from 10.8% (95% CI 6.9‚Äì16.5%) and 3.8% (95% CI 3.0‚Äì11.5%) in 2014 to 36.7% (95% CI 32.9‚Äì40.8%) and 36.8% (95% CI 29.2‚Äì44.7%) in 2017, respectively. VREF proportions were considerably higher in isolates from patients aged 40‚Äì59‚Äâyears compared to younger patients. Further regression analyses show that in relation to secondary care hospitals, E. faecium samples collected in specialist care hospitals and prevention and rehabilitation care centres are more likely to be vancomycin-resistant (odds ratios: 2.4 [95% CI 1.2‚Äì4.6] and 2.4 [95% CI 1.9‚Äì3.0], respectively). No differences in VREF proportions were found between female and male patients as well as between different clinical specimens.ConclusionThe proportion of VREF is increasing in German hospitals, particularly in southern regions in Germany. Increased efforts in infection control and antibiotic stewardship activities accounting for local resistance patterns are necessary to combat the spread of VREF in Germany.","inCitations":["80142f57fb26771b2adeb114402778a16d781491","a3728da499f468048be25b75d8c42a01b1ffbd73","48712f7046b630dd0c2af7d162948a80e62277a5"],"pdfUrls":["https://aricjournal.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s13756-019-0594-3"],"title":"The rise in vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium in Germany: data from the German Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance (ARS)","doi":"10.1186/s13756-019-0594-3","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s13756-019-0594-3","venue":"Antimicrobial Resistance & Infection Control"}

Large-scale parallel computers have also gained wider acceptance in the commercial world. Given the rapid advance of VLSI technologies, multiple processors on a single chip may soon be commercially available, which will give rise to even wider use of parallel computers. Parallel computers not only can increase system throughput but also present opportunities to speed up individual programs. However, writing parallel programs is still much more difficult than writing sequential programs. It is equally challenging, if not more so, to develop tools which can automatically restructure sequential programs for parallel machines. Designers of parallel languages and compilers have long worked toward bringing parallel computing to mainstream. The increased availability of commercial parallel computers makes such effort even more urgent and challenging. In August 7¬± 9, 1997, over seventy researchers working in this field met at the Tenth Annual International Workshop on Languages and Compilers for Parallel Computing (LCPC‚Äô97 ) held at the University of Minnesota, to exchange ideas and present their state-of-the-art results. Based on the program committee‚Äôs recommendations, we invited several research groups to present their revised papers as formal articles for a special issue in the International Journal of Parallel Programming . The articles presented in this special issue on Languages and Compilers for Parallel Computing represent an important part of the current research efforts in the field. This special issue is published in two parts. The first part contains four articles. The first article, `ÃÄParallel Programming and Performance Evaluation with the Ursa Tool Family‚Äô‚Äô by Park, Voss, Armstrong, and Eigenmann, deals with compilers which automatically parallelize sequential programs. It addresses the question of how to make such parallelizing compilers more interactive.

A specific trackside measurement methodology has been designed to verify the influences of the main parameters: wheel angle of attack, vertical and lateral rail forces, wheel lateral position, train speed and weather conditions. This paper focuses on the role of the wheel angle of attack on curving noise generation. A detailed method of curving noise identification, including the type of curving noise and its generating wheel, is presented. It is observed that all severe squeal noise events (>100dBA) were generated from high wheel angle of attack (>10mrad), while flanging noise has no obvious relationship with wheel angle of attack. A surprising finding from this measurement exercise is that squeal noise was generated from the outer wheel/high-rail interface, which is contradictory to the conventional knowledge.","inCitations":["2d43fa3583b6997c394556b693e7b1d76c580532","7a9e96440a6b93a8d1ea29340af4f1896cde87b3","c531f573092f396890b9e4c2bf42291793c8e8fe","56cba67cb62ec2c1d97f50ec78d2614c5dbbc11f","88e2afda3b458882669c9272aeaaab78da89bc57"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Field Verification of Curving Noise Mechanisms","doi":"10.1007/978-4-431-53927-8_41","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-4-431-53927-8_41","venue":""}

We computed the bistatic radar cross-section of a full-size aircraft at 8 GHz, involving the solution of a dense matrix equation with nearly 10.2 million unknowns. We regarded this as the \"ultimate test\" of a massively parallel implementation of the multilevel fast multipole algorithm (MLFMA), called ScaleME. In this paper, we narrate the technical difficulties faced and the experience gained from a very informal point of view. We describe the various methods developed for surmounting each of the obstacles.","inCitations":["8aa8bdf977c89feb402feb28711bb853a1373965","23d7cff968f5c3f23825903f6a028cfbb45c130e","42528ae9030734e8a933b2e1c6ffeb6f1782bbbd","b8e7a70bbe3d1282aa2a3c950a7019581d3e8ef8","414a24553a2cf012229a2c5b759e7a116eebb932","e23201996d957fc9f262537e033a171a49313c54","cc160ceb62d24a842edd53dd748a244064b7e00d","e8bfc36ce991e09479a7ea96c64ddeccd73665bb","4ec8fdd0a673c5a36f4e98e2b4806f5a91c8623e","e5f0abde6e1818c9bfcd5a54f2a476006670b1bf","1099a230b46f7f182ee15c4bbae7a49cd1f3f2e8","8e9db5a59806b2b8d366242256b19d325f11ff16","201031a12dc4c3282740b352aa2147dbf3fde994","e9365c3429bca428e7d2acc1fd488ca9dc80cb3b","b39acbe438c5377d8d1f5dc74994ac58c77abe6e","b3911064291d1d79527cf146003ba4a6a7c8630f","917a40cba8565d4b5e8c22e432d0c31a00894c11","900c89ce7bebcb4a84373f5b7723f448f06b7553","bdf7afc3e47f6d4edb3c60260e9b2e9493a03c3a","479e49d6402826b1f41db90139751e9f22166ea0","b9d43b092b2064db3cda35160eaf7ef3f7162f23","25c88413fd324d8b16439b18909744c90b3b9cfb","eb6f30c70df0c0ae600f8835b4cb1c91597a5c1a","5d0d086330cae66836f257210870b678b4fadc04","87d27e239487eea04be6a51c73d7db216c14ec1b","b09a584c3904e9e08ddd487cf142765248c466b0","b861d4c015686049b12efa83507c0954fed10803","66fc1f8270528984ff030f3325a2fd1dcecb164c","3d8b9e83a7ba6cc2acabfa1812b51b878a643afc","a9bf399de7007e88eb936b565cb8b79fe43d19d4","23a3f7e5fdd0186b40684c9cd0b8ddb5db897c7f","590ede968c448edda02136bc7f77ecf40b5d474c","f52f91430a80a8c31674dfabab24168084f7efda","33c00b3614ed8226bf85267baf9b4f1c6e769724","2ec65a830650dcfe4d202eec23ab47fe312b3863","dbff3d57389117408886d5bc8d48dd7cc5e202d7","f83bc71f2e7dc8bf9c0cb6233ff852db43078d0f","2b437943ed6299ac75df3536927d15d3562e295a","d7bf2f5b07e2408d01e9223169ec7a32bd430389","8a458d421c093cce8a51232fdcf4b00ede83684f","3f3ff46169fcff0b2564ed7ec06916e7075ff4ff","fb1d6a5f54a37720c53db1bf1e8438c47656eaa6","e51def0602d61ea36ee1299c6d899752a9ebdd4c","4e73349b5ee673482e9fc9b30579b52f60948171","4306ebd1709327b13c309ce19cb97951e525b3aa","0c17d1cec8f6d797a8feb2f982d392fd24135195","4b50577f4b0452cdeb84369be991dea2fa7a1eea","627bf45bbca376b09d27a992f64d1e8de5921c9f","952cceeabceb928c7190571ea7dd5f7a205d0750","0c7754850b692afb059da92fa034bbb29041c6c9","47d69e2b84b9f6411f470b34a8e321feb1cb7ee9","bddc293dca1ca23bebe5e424033ba1868c60b358","24eab33521cd01b1a759b813ab111f30d24dcbe7","9746c1c4ecb6610543078eb94e25cfbb39aa7675","5d11bdb12d4ebfd0a9692f850cff557482ea16be","63df927ea5c5ef2840e38bae775e120fa67cef28","e4f9f592e43414583f62f04ae69d7e25ea2f7fc2","b64a2d89259ab51d41c4ccc877196ac9fe69c7a3","5cec96a1e03caa47cf05ad8856c76d56f1f0d032","903afa13f1747f12697fba7e8bff0517aab38097","6b000e2160485ffb7669f013a1731a1f75108aad","81a3cfaf50996c2971b203ba06363fe610216b02","2d8c875268c60dc2685986eb631f407fbad33bdb","3232ada43831450c72901e49134e87fd2f005938","e68a1f42d7172b555b6bd286a023115c367b49a8","fc12530f3ccf46b6c6d3be685a897e0498249841","65db4271e678e9bc58116b2ef9f404fc7194c87e","ff35763992a1ace46d55725da1b6de7981287de8","fd2faac74655ce0cba00041cea87121be8b0366d","e6ac84e94ccf56a514d85fc4fd4280af8f3c65ea","73069dd34c86c25b3c1b065cac03c38158f0d868","63d718d5d34c250fcb1f197808f1436d8666129c","13acece7cb2f9c94b9016adcc5b0a216b14161f5","67f1117f3d7df28a8949a0630172fd0c560bd232","275829f46107c84f1cc8bfb15613e8acbeee742f","3add2f2060c076d63016fc77e824982f3ff5bff3","83bfe8f981c15e2eb1e621ac59c8269ac30edaf9","2197f081b4f62f8f49ad10aff7f28bf21f928a47","39e5c3447db63af26957df0d12e204fd41ad540d","e1964bca76f5f9f241dfef8ff5bf1c1924c0793d","6e55677a5e6689a74072b17a3f41f09ff4510df2","e5ae3e0bcc701268cf1451e32d9df6b78694459b","613255ede784be34c18960d025108039e791390b","258c332c0ec428934ffdd4d5b33c2964179ff525","cafa2db07e409d2fac4e6279df44e1fd8b4d3258","5d774de27e779ec1f4146a8fb9232a778e5db0f7","95a2a2fe8e0ca562113b0117ab19aea5b8378212","f48888002558cb33ab45b988c5f91a525077cad4","2cbc1a1ea1ed7fab86e463888155461d7d2b3932","426f89ffbed691e33a08990ff3a3fbf59b027ae9","da2674f4d8b5d298088ab7f2a6026ce47a10bdba","2d34c298264829226d056650c1943a2bd74770ae","20dcb8b2ca13390ae767d7585aad8bd7bf79251e","a5189686d77458d9ae0ae21860a564d2c0f47a43","7c43c3ba44d5abfd0a26ea355715adf7c78dd3fa","c711f812572ef1ba9a9c8f95db31576d0edf26dd","efa356944905ef3cc221a1a9d16c1f5ece3bf065","cf18fd026dc4c92f9a3af1c846f0e20ae8391bb0","253023273a671bf76b6143726c422fa8bcf176e7","ff8c544e7578018ddb9872a34c6dbabd7b9b7193","bd69efa48547671027c2e999d57059f99e932059","4fee8f930bab1ddedd124f2e532aa376e8dded3a","4ff4b7d9421078eec4cec97c75449117bfc50632","d2137bae333200e9a453ecaa3b33b56a0b5b9328","ebfbd445c783a42b062e8e926ba734d89fadee68","ccdbd66378117d835f27b67653a7c3c53fd16c3b","7e68bd39367a21606ad74962bb109e0ff7a0a5a9","5349af07c4c225c810bb94a2136261adbe4de48c","79da54fcb0db01e6e76d89d7fd9f8a475fb8724e","c5db7fbb24ad6d1c7f4c64f70675108b7eee6b03","0da94bfe94da5a73ee2be3c1d3dd48d5791c4547","30c2e6e35cb8f5103c84b15ffd5bdbecd875d991"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"10 million unknowns: is it that big?

Although physical presentation is very non-specific and diversified, physicians should pay attention when patients present with low body temperature and alteration of neurological status; the presence of precipitating events in past medical history can help in making a diagnosis. Here we discuss one such case: an 83-year-old female presented with abdominal pain since few days. Laboratory tests and abdomen computed tomography scan demonstrated alithiasic cholecystitis; she was properly treated but, during the Emergency Department stay she experienced a cardiac arrest. Physicians immediately started advance cardiovascular life support algorithm and she survived.

Sixty procedures were collected and analysed. Remifentanil was used during monitoring of vital functions, with oxygen inhalation throughout the procedure, at the bedside in the intensive care unit ward. Infusion speed was varied by the nurse in charge, depending on pain, analgesia, and adverse effects. The dosage of continuous infusion ranged from 0.125 to 1 mg.kg-1.mn-1 (average, 0.42). All patients received intravenously morphine 30 min before the end of the procedure (average, 10 mg). The main side effects were hypoxia and drowsiness, always quickly reversed when the doses were reduced. All patients had low levels of pain during and after the procedure, and were satisfied with the analgesia protocol. We conclude that remifentanil is another possible manner of analgesia in the dressing of burn patients, but that it must be used in an \"anaesthesiological\" environment.","inCitations":["2f14db33bada8eaa0460e4ba15bc9755a7bba6e5","4ac5deed7c45aa510eb2eebd7bcd24721a458e74","5f88cd45bfc47bd52f723659c88cce89c3e91f2f"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Use of remifentanil for analgesia during dressing change in spontaneously breathing non-intubated burn patients.","doi":"","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"Annals of burns and fire disasters"}

In some animal models of autoimmunity, the induction of iNOS has been shown to lead to inflammation and tissue damage, and it has been suggested that iNOS is an immune mediator in humans as well. Using in situ hybridization and immunohistochemical techniques, we demonstrate that iNOS mRNA and protein are present in the coronary arteries of transplanted human hearts with accelerated graft arteriosclerosis (AGA). iNOS is expressed in cells morphologically consistent with macrophages in the neointima of 7 of 10 of the transplanted vessels with AGA that were examined. In serial sections, these same cells express the macrophage marker CD68. In contrast, iNOS is absent from five native coronary arteries with atherosclerosis and absent from two normal coronary arteries. Although iNOS is expressed in macrophages in AGA, its role in the pathogenesis of AGA is unknown.","inCitations":["ceeb27f7b98c1eac4cdaf898266cb67ca98bb8f9","26847fe890ad7e49918c6b735f76352b825dce39","5633baa495271308b98ca0cb11d47cec48baebf8","c1e65eaa1544b753ff737eace82b2d4254e688bd","7e12b4ff85085af6a9037fe6b87634667d32daa0","8e9c0c1c62522a4db8214ed479e03a04efb81b2b","0ffa24ebc2626beeaf5884fbecc93e27968dd306","92bb3d13e19a0396bcba373cc0c6a282b345abe4","309bb732c9aafb4b260aa054098b460a59873f62","47dfb991df8ef82b6fbc15df4773ab571bf20498","d843c03afdff0c935f456323b64d1ec7caec844f","b07ae7ed4918829939bf516f7b0d60ac8e0629f6","d3eccfb812fe587f4ed606570884eeb1cf1e74e6","fb21b4571e24789c553a1c85b425a5d2d84a2aa4","11b5d1ca6f494ec41772a08ceb67dae315a2997b","41bd765bbc2fc7f75fb77d1afe5a647ac2f80f0d","925b399ea9a6b68f6ca0c1133df817360dd723a7"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Inducible nitric oxide synthase expression in coronary arteries of transplanted human hearts with accelerated graft arteriosclerosis.","doi":"","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"The American journal of pathology"}

within a school. Despite the unique contextual factors that influence school technology decision-making, teachers and students are still charged with using technology for teaching and learning in order to be 21 century learners. The purpose of this study was to explore how one Bais Yaakov school community, an all-girls private Jewish school, navigated the tensions of context and technology innovation through their adoption of 1:1 Chromebooks. Grounded theory ethnographic methods and activity theory were employed for data collection and analysis. Technology use was limited, and participants explained that lack of time, fear, frustration, and pedagogical beliefs were reasons that some teachers did not use technology. Practical recommendations from this research include the importance of developing a technology plan designed by all stakeholders and targeted professional development for content areas. Theoretical recommendations include the discussion of culturally competent Internet use in schools and ‚Äúmedia refusal‚Äù as a term to describe communities who chose not to integrate technology into educational curriculum.

Although guidelines to reduce falls have been available for over a decade, routine implementation by healthcare providers is less than optimal. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the attitudes/beliefs and current practices of Kansas physician assistants (PAs) regarding fall assessment/prevention strategies in older adults and barriers to implementing strategies into daily practice. Methods. A 67-item survey was mailed to all 760 Kansas PAs in 2009; 152 responded. Logistic regressions were performed on current fall prevention practices (exercise, home safety, medications, and vision) to determine attitudes, beliefs, and barriers associated with implementation. Results. Most PAs believe falls are preventable (87%) and implementation of various prevention strategies are their professional responsibility (88% - 96%); yet, less than 50% routinely implement them. Barriers included lack of time (27%), lack of staff (26%), and feeling illprepared (18%). Multiple logistic regressions revealed correlations among implementing the medication review strategy and lack of time as well as practicing the exercise strategy and lack of time and awareness of local exercise programs. Conclusions. PAs are aware of the importance of fall prevention, believe falls are preventable, and believe it is their professional responsibility to implement fall prevention strategies with their older adult patients. However, most do not implement strategies in their practice due to a variety of internal and logistical barriers. Fall prevention materials/tools that are practical, simple, inexpensive, and require little implementation time may overcome barriers.

As a form of environmental resource, person-organization fit was proposed as a leading factor of frontline employee boundary spanning behavior through emotional exhaustion and intrinsic motivation. All measures were adapted from or developed based on prior research. Data for the study were collected from a cross-sectional sample of retail bank employees in South Korea. Questionnaires were distributed to 500 frontline employees across several banks. Of these, 322 usable questionnaires were returned. To analyze the data, a structural equation model procedure using LISREL 8.5 was employed. Results show that an employee`s perceived fit with his/her organization enhances intrinsic motivation and reduces emotional exhaustion. These mechanisms, in turn, increase the employee`s boundary spanning behavior. These results support the notion that person-organization fit should be one of the factors affecting motivation, affect and attachment, and extends such an understanding to a purely service-based environment among customer contact employees. Results also confirms that P-O fit can be viewed as environmental resources, and the JD-R model provides a theoretical base in further studying the antecedent role of P-O fit on frontline employees`s boundary spanning behavior through intrinsic motivation and emotional exhaustion. These results suggest that organizations have to do their best to manage P-O fit, be it through employee screening or training and workshops to try and align organization and employee values and objectives. If managers of organizations are positively evaluated by the employees, it will be easier for them to, give things of value to employees, such as sense of direction, values, and recognition, and receive other things in return such as esteem and responsiveness. Consequently, organizational leaders are not only able to manage employee experiences, but also their fit with the organization. Even if a manager cannot control employee P-O fit, this research suggests, that a focus on reducing emotional exhaustion rather than increasing intrinsic motivation seems optimal. This research also supports the idea that motivation has a direct association with a frontline employee`s boundary spanning behavior. Even in situations where emotional exhaustion cannot be reduced, organizations may still influence frontline behaviors through motivation.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"The Effect of P-O Fit on the Frontline Employee`s Boundary Spanning Behaviors","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

To study clinical and epidemiological features of arterial hypertension (HT) combined with abdominal obesity (AO) and pharmacological correction of left ventricle myocardium structural and functional disorders. Material and methods . Single-stage epidemiological study was conducted in Novgorod region population (n=4840). All patients with HT were revealed and analyzed depending on age and gender. Patients with HT grade 2 were split in two groups. 124 women (aged 49,36¬±1,2 y.o.) and 126 men (aged 50,15¬±1,8 y.o.) with HT and AO were included in the first group. 127 women (aged 50,05¬±1,7 y.o.) and 125 men (aged 49,61¬±1,6 y.o.) with HT and normal body mass index were included in the second group. Anthropometric and echocardiography examination was performed before and after 1, 3 and 6 months of therapy (metoprolol, nebivolol, amlodipine, lisinopril). Results. High prevalence of HT was revealed: 44,4% in men and 48,7% in women. AO was observed 5,4 times more often in women than this in men (18,5% and 3,4%, respectively, —Ä<0,001). Combination of HT and AO was also revealed 5,3 times more often in women than this in men (14,3% and 2,7%, respectively, —Ä<0,001). AO in patients with HT contributes to development of left ventricle concentric hypertrophy and diastolic dysfunction. Conclusion. Antihypertensive therapy does not prevent left ventricle hypertrophy and diastolic dysfunction in hypertensive patients with AO.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Influence of Abdominal Obesity on Heart Structural and Functional Changes and Possibility of Their Pharmacological Correction in Patients with Arterial Hypertension","doi":"10.20996/1819-6446-2008-4-4-28-31","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.20996/1819-6446-2008-4-4-28-31","venue":""}

Second, we evaluate to what extent do the fluctuations of output gap, however measured, are a good predictors of inflation in the UAE. This is carried out by comparing the out-of-sample forecasts generated by the output gap-based models to those of the model with alternative indicators and the benchmark models.

Recently, many works have convincingly demonstrated that PEH can also act as a self-powered sensor for detecting a wide range of machine and human contexts, which suggests that energy harvesting and sensing can be performed concurrently. However, realization of simultaneous energy harvesting and sensing (SEHS) is challenging as the energy harvesting process distorts the sensing signal. In this demo, we propose a novel SEHS architecture prototyped in the form factor of an insole, which combines energy harvesting and sensing in the same piece of PEH. Meanwhile, a special filtering algorithm is applied to minimize the distortion in the sensing signal.

The microstructure of deformed and annealed samples was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD), and Vickers microhardness testing. The deformed structure after one ECAE pass is rather inhomogenous and consists of parallel sets of coarse shear bands whose spacing varies from one region to another in the cylindrical billet. the microstructure within the shear bands consists of elongated subgrains with sizes below 3 Œºm and lamellar boundaries. The remaining non-sheared regions display a coarser subgrain structure. Recrystallization is virtually absent in samples annealed at 500oC for 1 hour. Nucleation begins mostly within shear bands. The new grains with sizes ranging from 10 to 50 Œºm are arranged in clusters rather than being homogenously distributed. The recrystallized volume fraction also varies from one region to another indicating an inhomogenous distribution of stored energy. At 700oC, recrystallization is complete after annealing for 1 hour resulting in a structure with a mean grain size of about 100 Œºm.","inCitations":["f6317d11216cef1bfba7d385db4b1e799ba5db0b","2debd0f53b23d3896d1bc785a8943fc30e191c44"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Recrystallization of Niobium Single Crystals Deformed by ECAE","doi":"10.4028/www.scientific.net/MSF.558-559.125","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.4028/www.scientific.net%2FMSF.558-559.125","venue":""}

RCTs are the risk factor for the occurrence of reproduction disturbances, such as infertility, spontaneous abortion, congenital anomalies in the offsprings, and the degree of risk depends to a large extent on which chromosome segments are in the state of imbalance in the offsprings, due to various mechanisms of abnormal meiotic segregation. The uniqueness of chromosome translocations with respect to the type of chromosomes involved in translocations, and the location of breaking sites is the reason for the necessity of construing large pedigrees for the evaluation of the degree of risk. The newest Stene and Stengel-Rutkowski model makes possible the combination of smaller pedigrees in translocation groups of the so-called single risk of imbalance and determination of the individual risk of birth of children with anomalies. A number of psychological determinants are important for the possibility of genetic investigations in the affected families, and the decision about procreation may be influenced by a number of determinants other than the result of genetic counsel.","inCitations":["3ec5bcb8e4efe4f435139ed09579614a6afcec34","fa7cc485f708941dfa2bb9960f50c94403379ae2","9c5e59b77deba34ec089ac258a9ca316973fb20f"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"[Genetic counseling in the case of carrier state with reciprocal chromosome translocations].","doi":"","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"Wiadomosci lekarskie"}

To determine this torque it is in general necessary to resort to numerical solution of the drift kinetic equation (DKE), e.g. using the SFINCS [1] or the NEO-2 codes [2]. The result of a recent benchmark for ASDEX between these codes [3] will be presented. The codes use slightly different methods to solve the DKE. The SFINCS code solves the 4D (poloidal angle, toroidal angle, pitch angle, speed) DKE in general 3D equilibria, and is thus suitable also for stellarator modelling. NEO-2 on the other hand makes an expansion in the closeness to axi-symmetry, and separates the contributions from different spatial Fourier modes through a quasi-linear approximation, thereby reducing the number of dimensions of the problem by one. However, the SFINCS calculations suggest that, already at the quite small amplitudes of magnetic perturbations used in experiments, the NTV torque deviates from the quasilinear approximation. The conventional method to calculate the torque is to obtain it directly from the radial particle fluxes via the flux-force relation. In this way, any neoclassical code that can calculate radial fluxes can be used to determine the NTV torque. Alternatively, one can calculate the toroidal torque directly from the relevant moment of the distribution function, involving the divergence of the total stress tensor. In particular, one can then see that the contribution of gyrophase dependent parts of the distribution function to the viscosity tensor become important for non-zero radial electric fields.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://varenna-lausanne.epfl.ch/Varenna2016/InvitedTalks2016abstracts/Smith_Varenna2016_abstract_invited.pdf"],"title":"Neoclassical toroidal viscous torque due to non-axisymmetric magnetic fields in tokamaks","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Estimates of K‚Ä≤c,AlÓó∏Ca are found to be very sensitive to the equivalent fraction of exchangeable calcium, ECa. The sensitivity is very large at both low and high values of ECa. But the error in K‚Ä≤c, ŒîK‚Ä≤c, remains tolerable for 0.30 < ECa < 0.80. Because of the extensive interest in soils impacted by acid deposition which normally have ECa < 0.3, more experimental work on CaÓó∏Al exchange systems within this range of ECa is recommended. The functional relationship between bs-Kc-pH (bs, base saturation) is discussed. If the Kc value is underestimated or overestimated, the soil leaching sensitivity (sls) to acidic deposition would also be underestimated or overestimated, respectively.

On ultrasonography,all the 73 benign lesions had distinct margin,45(61.6%)had multilocular cystic or cystic-solid mass,49(67.1%)had irregular shape,and 28(38.4%)had nodular solid protrusions in the cystic areas. On the color Doppler flow imaging,36(49.3%)lesions had blood flow signals. The ultrasonographic features of the malignant struma ovarii lesion were multilocular cystic-solid mass with several nodular solid protrusions in the cysic areas;on the color Doppler flow imaging,blood flow signals were visible within septa and solid areas.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe sonographic features of struma ovarii are diverse. If ultrasonography reveals multilocular cystic or cystic-solid mass with distinct margin and isoechoic or hyperechoic nodular solid protrusions in the cystic areas with visible blood flow signals,the diagnosis of struma ovarii should be considered.","inCitations":["0a4b390b3bbaaa311d652af5d1b09c8c4e8bea71","65ad0a0a26494a5640d4ef0e932c713bf7d5a35b"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Sonographic and Pathologic Features of Struma Ovarii.","doi":"10.3881/j.issn.1000-503X.2015.03.012","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.3881/j.issn.1000-503X.2015.03.012","venue":"Zhongguo yi xue ke xue yuan xue bao.

Different drug concentrations were tested against one hundred 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) of the respective viruses. Drug concentrations lower than 200Œºg/mL resulted in viability rates of more than 80% for MDBK and Hep2 cells in the MTT test (3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide). The selectivity index (IS) of the drugs was calculated dividing the concentration of the drug that is cytotoxic for 50% of the cells (CC50) by the concentration of the drug that was effective in reducing by 50% the number of viral plaques (EC50) for the three herpesviruses. Thus, ACV was shown to be moderately active against BoHV-1 (EC50: 112.9Œºg/mL; IS: 4.5), BoHV-2 (EC50: 114.2Œºg/mL; IS: 4.5) and BoHV-5 (EC50: 96.9Œºg/mL; IS: 5.3). GCV was effective against BoHV-2 (EC50: 33.5Œºg/mL; IS: 16.6), moderately effective against BoHV-5 (EC50: 123.2Œºg/mL; IS: 4.5) and poorly active against BoHV-1 (EC50: 335.8Œºg/mL; IS: 1.7). PFA exhibited the highest antiviral activity, being the only drug that, at concentration of 100Œºg/mL, completely inhibited plaque formation by all three viruses. PFA was the most effective in vitro against BoHV-1 (EC50: 29.5Œºg/mL; IS: 42.2), BoHV-2 (EC50: 45.2Œºg/mL; IS: 27.6) and BoHV-5 (EC50: 7.8Œºg/mL; IS: 160.6). Thus, the results indicate that PFA is a promising candidate for experimental therapeutic testing in vivo against bovine herpesviruses.","inCitations":["58ecbd12e125bc0a57341df86933a4d00a77eca6","283f0fd098b3a1aeae47353ae73deef4781d9959","7b215f62d3b8551defbdff0c49445a22a102b17d","de3fd4849a32d22fe9eaf62825ffab3f9a3d058b"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Atividade de tr√™s drogas antivirais sobre os herpesv√≠rus bovino tipos 1, 2 e 5 em cultivo celular","doi":"10.1590/S0100-736X2010001000008","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1590/S0100-736X2010001000008","venue":""}

It is expected a similar prospect to battery energy storage system (BESS) which is a multi-benefit solution with high penetration of renewable energy in general and solar rooftops in particular. In low voltage networks with high penetration of solar rooftops, voltages may rise dramatically. Standing on the utility view point, this paper investigates the minimum cost and size of BESS which is needed to help maintain voltages to be within the acceptable limits. Based on perfect day-ahead forecast of generation and load, optimum schedule of the BESS is obtained. In addition, this paper also considers the aging degradation of BESS.

Norepinephrine turnover, assessed by inhibiting catecholamine biosynthesis with alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine, was elevated in cardiac sympathetic nerve terminals in rats exposed perinatally to methadone. In contrast, turnover was unchanged in noradrenergic and dopaminergic systems in the brain. Similar results were obtained when methadone was given directly to the pups during postnatal life.

Behind this apparently trivial definition lies a central concept in biological control: the GRF provides the input/output relationship of each edge in a transcriptional network, independently from the molecular interactions involved. Here we discuss how existing methods allow direct measurement of the GRF, and how several trade-offs between scalability and accuracy have hindered its application to relatively large networks. We discuss the theoretical and technical requirements for obtaining the GRF. Based on these requirements, we introduce a simplified and easily scalable method that is able to capture the significant parameters of the GRF.

Legislation changes in 2015 (induced by the European Union and ongoing trend towards circular economy) require municipalities to provide the separate collection of biowaste made the questions of biowaste collection and treatment relevant for practically all municipalities. In our paper we examine the development of biowaste situation at both national and municipal level. At the national level we use waste data from past 15 years, while at the municipal level we use a sample of municipalities with data from the 2010-12 period, depending on the exact year when municipality introduced the separate collection of biowaste. While the trend at the aggregated level is clearly positive towards increased amount of the separated waste with a stable amount of residual waste, the experience of individual municipalities vary from strongly positive to neutral, both in environmental and economic terms. The general trend is, however positive. Per capita amounts of biowaste on the average increase, the amount of residual waste decreases slightly and the municipal waste expenditures remain approximately the same. Even more positive results are to be expected later as, according to local authorities, with longer experience with biowaste collection, few years of adjustments are needed in order to develop the full potential of biowaste collection.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://uest.ntua.gr/athens2017/proceedings/pdfs/Athens2017_Struk.pdf","http://uest.ntua.gr/athens2017/proceedings/presentations/Struk.pdf"],"title":"Impact of biowaste collection on municipal solid waste management in Czechia","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Les parametres suivis au niveau de 44 puits sont: (1) le bilan ionique (Cl - , Na + , K + , Ca 2+ , Mg 2+ , SO 4 2- , HCO 3 - ), (2) les composes azotes (NO 3 - , NO 2 - , NH 4 + ) et (3) les Coliformes fecaux ainsi que les Streptocoques fecaux. Les mecanismes de transfert des polluants azotes (notamment des nitrates) et des germes indicateurs de contamination fecale sont discutes. Les resultats ont montre que les rejets utilises pour l'irrigation sont a classer dans la categorie C selon l'OMS (1989) ou tantot dans la categorie d'eau a risque modere a faible, tantot dans la categorie a risque eleve, selon la FAO (1992). D'autres part, la reutilisation des eaux usees brutes en agriculture a provoque une degradation serieuse de la qualite des eaux de la nappe alluviale du perimetre irrigue. Ces eaux, a cause de la presence excessive des nitrates et des germes fecaux, sont devenues pratiquement inutilisables, aussi bien pour l'alimentation en eau potable que pour l'irrigation. Cet impact negatif est favorise surtout par les caracteristiques du milieu physique de la nappe alluviale et des terrains aquiferes, mais probablement aussi par la proximite des points de prise d'eau des sources ponctuelles de pollution et par le manque de protection des points d'eau. Une etude prealable de la vulnerabilite de cette nappe, prenant en compte les caracteristiques du milieu physique, constitue certainement un outil indispensable pour prevenir la degradation de telles nappes alluviales, ressources potentielles importantes d'eau potable .","inCitations":["e2e7ab88ab0cf3d8880585b27d591a9fec26f1db","6a0539672c4566be9ef42bdc1ec361c3ac6e5b1b"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Impact de l'utilisation des eaux us√©es urbaines brutes sur la qualit√© de l'eau d'une nappe alluviale pr√®s de Marrakech (Maroc)","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

We provide the full QCD framework for the evaluation of tau neutrino deep inelastic charged current (CC) cross sections at leading twist, including next-to-leading-order (NLO) corrections, charm production, tau threshold, and target mass effects in the collinear approximation. We investigate the violation of the Albright-Jarlskog relations for the structure functions ${F}_{4,5}$ which occur only in heavy lepton $(\\ensuremath{\\tau})$ scattering. Integrated CC cross sections for neutrino-nucleon interactions are evaluated naively over the full phase space and with the inclusion of DIS kinematic cuts. Uncertainties in our evaluation based on scale dependence, PDF errors and the interplay between kinematic and dynamical power corrections are discussed and/or quantified.","inCitations":["cc69b3094b4da18fe3548e5064066e43ae997e84","9857642c90e9fed52f0aacb6d90307f7f9188573","79242247a989fb3ecc8e0ff322fec504a772ede1","4ce8d4758f7a0add1a3b2003f77837db511f2d47","3683a17a5424743aafa959ae66f5292684347da2","badedcff376df958d9aaf8cccfb1c831c6af95a9","6054ac677b07b2cd1d3e2213c154e7ece053d603","b76b22894264b0e7ab6770b01d58d51879a0470b","6778d26cb42fbaccf0796e6f2fe437873b2d855a","47ec20138133dc9e2ff8acf69b2278fb80e62b74","daa904ee446ceaf603a11e6419dd9eac42149dcd","c3a348958078d66d4548643b5cacfd7709fdc597","d3cc225d50419aff6495486f4029885e33dc5a69","11d983fa232efaddec150c45fb00050b6c81a092"],"pdfUrls":["https://arxiv.org/pdf/hep-ph/0208187v1.pdf"],"title":"Tau neutrino deep inelastic charged current interactions","doi":"10.1103/PhysRevD.66.113007","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevD.66.113007","venue":""}
