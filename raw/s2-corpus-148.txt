Nevertheless there is no consensus about how these fractures should be treated. Anatomic reduction of the distal radius is necessary to achieve good functional results. In particular, the elderly patient, who may have to use crutches or a walker, will need a pain-free wrist under axial load. The pi plate is designed for distal radius fractures. It has been widely criticized for causing irritation and/or rupture of the extensor tendons. Most complications of the implant can be avoided with a careful operative technique. To prevent ruptures of the extensor tendon implant removal after 4 to 6 months is recommended. In osteoporotic bone the pi plate guarantees good stability with minimal postoperative loss of reduction. The operative technique is described in detail and common complications are discussed.","inCitations":["fd0e021a2eb55ace0d00c497174462f5bdf114e5","7c0763644e21b19692dfb25bce31c3c4510d3714","dde3755d384b4da03deecf5edd6a6de536b83533","e64f7d7ca71c028a8a2f8e353c860edfef284b0f","d80d90f987884b24338b7c280d6014f79e370fda"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"The pi plate: an implant for unstable extension fractures of the distal radius in patients with osteoporotic bone.","doi":"10.1097/00130911-200412000-00003","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1097/00130911-200412000-00003","venue":"Techniques in hand & upper extremity surgery"}

Herein, we report a design strategy for the facile synthesis of N/S-co-doped carbon nanobowls through a one-pot condensation and carbonization process. The carbon nanostructure can be changed from a nanoball to a nanobowl by elaborately controlling the capillary compression and nanoshell thickness. The N/S-co-doped carbon nanobowls greatly increase the volumetric density by eliminating hollow interiors. The unique hierarchical micro/mesoporosity and the N,S-functionalized structure enable the carbon nanobowls to utilize the high specific surface area efficiently resulting in high specific capacitance and ultrafast charge/discharge capability. The electrochemical benefits endow the symmetric supercapacitors with a high energy density of 9.6 W h kg−1, a maximum power density of 475.5 kW kg−1, and a long cycle lifetime over 50 000 cycles. These encouraging results demonstrate the potential of the N/S-co-doped carbon nanobowls for application in ultrahigh-power supercapacitors.","inCitations":["fb3ea537a479cbc614116223e1fe2245cded390b","1e4cb5b5b91866fc76fe021856d46a9de9ab0f39"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Elaborate construction of N/S-co-doped carbon nanobowls for ultrahigh-power supercapacitors","doi":"10.1039/C8TA07573E","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1039/C8TA07573E","venue":""}

The corrosion behaviour of this new Ti-6Al-2Nb-1Ta alloy in 0.1 M Na2SO4, 3% NaCl solutions and synthetic sea water was studied in this paper, using potentiodynamic and linear polarisation method, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and monitoring of the open circuit potentials. The structure of the alloy represents an α + β uniform structure with un-oriented grains. From the potentiodynamic polarisation curves it resulted that the studied alloy is self-passivated in all three solutions having a very good and very easy tendency to passivation. The most favourable values of the electrochemical parameters were registered in 0.1 M Na2SO4 solution due to its reduced corrosivity. EIS measurements proved the improvement of the passive layer resistance with the immersion time. An electric equivalent circuit with two time constants was fitted. The values of the polarisation resistances showed very good protective capacities which improved in time. The open circuit potentials have the general tendency to ennoble in time, suggesting the thickening of the passive films and the increase of their protective capacities.","inCitations":["65087161b0d1ca9140ce3fda000aa9227238be48","f069868aa405b1f1ad3f742c0964a47527405cb1"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Corrosion behaviour of a new Ti‐6Al‐2Nb‐1Ta alloy in various solutions","doi":"10.1002/maco.201006041","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1002/maco.201006041","venue":""}

Additional exploratory analyses were used to examine whether the magnitude of the association between ERP measures of word processing and receptive language varied as a function of the number of word stimuli the participants reportedly understood.\n\n\nMethod\nAuditory ERPs were recorded in response to spoken words and nonwords presented with equal probability in 34 children aged 2-5 years with a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder who were in the early stages of language acquisition. Average amplitudes and amplitude differences between word and nonword stimuli within 200-500 ms were examined at left temporal (T3) and parietal (P3) electrode clusters. Receptive vocabulary size and the number of experimental stimuli understood were concurrently measured using the MacArthur-Bates Communicative Development Inventories.\n\n\nResults\nAcross the entire participant group, word-nonword amplitude differences were diminished. The average word-nonword amplitude difference at T3 was related to receptive vocabulary only if 5 or more word stimuli were understood.\n\n\nConclusions\nIf ERPs are to ever have clinical utility, their construct validity must be established by investigations that confirm their associations with predictably related constructs. These results contribute to accruing evidence, suggesting that a valid measure of auditory word processing can be derived from the left temporal response to words and nonwords. In addition, this measure can be useful even for participants who do not reportedly understand all of the words presented as experimental stimuli, though it will be important for researchers to track familiarity with word stimuli in future investigations.\n\n\nSupplemental Material\nhttps://doi.org/10.23641/asha.5614840.","inCitations":["98f10cbb857a047d80cde6adacd12c5c1d9a88df"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Word Processing in Children With Autism Spectrum Disorders: Evidence From Event-Related Potentials.","doi":"10.1044/2017_JSLHR-S-17-0011","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1044/2017_JSLHR-S-17-0011","venue":"Journal of speech, language, and hearing research : JSLHR"}

However, taxonomic knowledge of these cultivated seaweeds and their wild relatives has not kept pace with advances in molecular systematics despite the fundamental importance of being able to identify commercially important species and strains, discover cryptic and endemic taxa and recognize non-native species with potentially damaging diseases and epiphytes. This review focuses on molecular taxonomic advances in the cultivated red algae with the highest commercial value globally: Eucheuma and Kappaphycus, Porphyra sensu lato and Gracilaria. All three groups are similarly taxonomically challenging: speciose, morphologically plastic, with poorly resolved species boundaries. Eucheuma and Kappaphycus are frequently misidentified and the molecular markers cox2-3 spacer, cox1 and RuBisCO spacer have helped in understanding phylogenetic relationships and identifying new species and haplotypes. In Porphyra sensu lato (Bangiales) species identification and phylogenetic relationships were highly problematic until a taxonomic revision based on a two-gene phylogeny (18S and rbcL) resulted in nine genera of bladed species. Pyropia, with at least 89 species, three in nori cultivation, has potential for new commercial evaluation. In Gracilaria sensu lato, earlier efforts to resolve species-level taxonomy and generic descriptions were superseded by application of molecular tools, including DNA sequences of the RuBisCO spacer, rbcL gene, 18S and the ITS region. Studies of these cultivated red algal genera highlight the need for a robust taxonomy, a more standardized approach to the molecular markers used and a comprehensive dataset for each representative species. Current work on DNA-based species delimitation, the emergence of high throughput sequencing, multi-gene phylogenies, publication of whole genomes (e.g. Porphyra umbilicalis) and genomes in the pipeline (e.g. Gracilaria) are increasingly improving our understanding of phylogenomic relationships and species relationships. This knowledge, in turn, can then be applied to improving red seaweed aquaculture.","inCitations":["ff2c96ee0371e25abbf43f9369c502b46568994f","1ccebcd4cc280862a1756dc7ae3611bf27aa1c62","1d7c2a13959f52ab879f071700c8c08618e8aeb7","4760838d3862e239e2161a205a537abfe0f7b5fe","1fdcc9d2006fb8d4059a37f8c2955366eb021223","de46ffa042617d7d614678bc604f086752703958"],"pdfUrls":["http://eprints.bournemouth.ac.uk/30041/7/revised%20submission.Maggs.pdf","https://umcms.um.edu.my/sites/institute-of-ocean-and-earth-sciences-ioes/IOES/doc/isi/publication/2017/2017_Latest/16.-%20Lim%20PE%20-%20European%20Journal%20of%20Phycology,%2052(4);438-451.pdf"],"title":"Advancing the taxonomy of economically important red seaweeds (Rhodophyta)","doi":"10.1080/09670262.2017.1365174","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1080/09670262.2017.1365174","venue":""}

Methods The samples were selected with typical and random sampling methods. The visual encounter survey was taken to investigate with self-designed questionnaire. And the data were analyzed with Chi-square test. Results The evaluation levels of the hygiene situation and the circumstance of catering industry around rural respondents of the four courties, including Nan, Taojiang, Xiangxiang and Shaoyang, were all dominated with ”general”, which accounted for 54.2% and 61.6% respectively. There were statistically differences in evaluation of hygiene situation and the circumstance of catering industry among the residents from four counties (both P＜0.05). The comparisons of the two evaluation levels of the rural residents from different counties showed that the evaluation level of Nan county was superior to the other three counties (all P＜0.0071), and the evaluation levels of Taojiang and Xiangxiang were superior to that of Shaoyang (all P＜0.0071), but no statistically significant difference was found between the evaluation levels of Taojiang and Xiangxiang (both P＞0.0071). Conclusions That the different modes of rural health supervision lead to the different qualities of the hygiene situation and the circumstance of catering industry shows that the degree of the rural supervision is closely relevant to its mode, yet the work of food security supervision of rural area demands to be strengthened as a whole.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"湖南省四县（市）农村居民对农村餐饮卫生评价分析","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Whether local immunosuppression by tumor-derived factors occurs in vivo as a potential mechanism of escape from immune surveillance is unknown. We found that lymphocytes from nodes draining distal esophageal squamous tumors in 23 consecutive patients had depressed proliferative and cytotoxic responsiveness relative to both lymphocytes from a reference node outside the field of drainage and matched PBL from the same patient. In a subset of patients in which more than one tumor-draining node was examined, a radial or zonal immunosuppression relative to the primary tumor was evident. The findings were unrelated to surgery or anatomic location because all but 2 of 26 control patients with esophagogastric adenocarcinoma had normal or enhanced lymphocyte responsiveness in the tumor-draining node. The absence of overt or even micrometastatic nodal disease, as determined by immunostaining for cytokeratin expression, coupled with the long-term survival of several of the patients, strongly suggests that the immunosuppressive effect is due to mechanisms other than metastases, and may be a premetastatic occurrence. We conclude that regional immunesuppression does exist in patients with esophageal squamous cancer when systemic immunity is still well preserved. The local immune suppression inhibits the generation of lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells and may be an impediment to potential immunotherapeutic strategies.","inCitations":["48e06b095dff3971191b23a8b01a5f0a7ef12741","777a6df5b56c6256c727e9ace35553430c24b8f6","c13da5a535a4b8b7095c57c419433ee4822ec059","83815dd62d1ec4c985331073ec08fe8c368da676","b6a16feb040d8018e656f244449ea521460b5c71","6550e4ab426130b7ff648d053169eeb378e1fffc","0807eab77a5b35473b0ee364395d04fbfdf45398","bbe27bdbbcd04946f75bffef64f0e8ccaf5ee1cb","78939e8c745b41a878726587195d4b4a42025dca","ee207fc44def1905ad86a66821d25138903011a4","de7b32b0954b1bb489805ca4d79455c2814bdf91","cd2464ebe45b164804d5cd4281663f287a662600","df7beaf9fffa4f4dcbae603afcdd695aab0cabd4","8502da0e3e050f1e5323088afc4a0b5c65a418f9","1299a6f9814170d9a87c21a339b840b0d65455ae","9b97057933717c473198786cbbbc95690e28543e","099211a6541e71934c06320b97097d9ca63ebe8d","71767951087393b5f807622d9b788d9de97e5094","706d93fb5b914b0222f4b32122d51f840d6d947f","180b5c416d87e6186c9ce051284a79354074ef7d","11a7cff208df6dd6c5e2f2eb3d919310c72fc760","2d768800a69b7b02d95eed0b0a46656bc006ed3c","66961f8b518e9f9a2bb2ddf93e9dc64f9fb7b749","9b2576cb387d1959a4b74adbeb6e66386c55cc4b","9619c0ee345dcb3271dd87af17f0f82a7fbf4662","ca925d8e8c656d899be5134a3a5a0fd1c050df05","cb37af025258800b0f294b03dced4fc6d901ae73"],"pdfUrls":["http://cancer.cytoluminator.com/cancer-photodynamic-therapy/Regional%20Immunosuppression%20in%20Esophageal%20Squamous%20Cancer.pdf"],"title":"Regional immunosuppression in esophageal squamous cancer: evidence from functional studies with matched lymph nodes.","doi":"","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"Journal of immunology"}

The experiments are performed on a group of specimens for duration of 10 min for various loads of 8, 12, and 16 kg in magnitude with disk speed of 380 rpm. The results show that the coefficient of friction varies with duration of rubbing and normal load at constant sliding velocity. In general, coefficient of friction increases for a certain duration of rubbing and after that it remains constant for the rest of the experimental time. The results obtained reveal that the coefficient of friction increases with the increase in normal load for all the tested materials. For the same operating condition, the magnitudes of the coefficient of friction and wear rate are different for different materials depending on normal load. The performance of steel with respect to wear is significantly governed by the chemical composition of material. Wear rate increases with the increase in normal load. Results have also shown that the wear of carbon steel is significantly reduced by adding more carbon content. Hence, it becomes imperative to analyze the wear characteristics of different types of steel materials, particularly SS304, SS316, SS202 and mild steel, sliding against EN-31 on a case-to-case basis in order to arrive at a more realistic assessment of wear performance.","inCitations":["fefde7ebfeecb2da36232593ffbae88cbc26e0cf","90d4cc6fff1b04e07d39f47071bd815131935a7e","0e7bfdc222a7bc82a7b5cbe54d8aa155ac96b5df","779a5cc99c4ec1adc61c58ed0928ed64ad1f87e0","d315c4241485920e67fb406e865f8a7c76d7c0ec","6516d5791fdab404656e2f06b3aff041c48572c7"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Tribological Behavior of High Fraction Carbon Steel Alloys","doi":"10.1007/s40735-016-0034-3","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s40735-016-0034-3","venue":"Journal of Bio- and Tribo-Corrosion"}

Investigations of global and related local phenomena on Mars such as atmospheric circulation patterns, boundary layer phenomena, water, dust and climatological cycles and investigations of the planetary interior would benefit from simultaneous, distributed in situ measurements. Practically, such an observation network would require low-mass landers, with a high packing density, so a large number of landers could be delivered to Mars with the minimum number of launchers. The Mars Network Lander (MetNet Lander; MNL), a small semi-hard lander/penetrator design with a payload mass fraction of approximately 17 %, has been developed, tested and prototyped. The MNL features an innovative Entry, Descent and Landing System (EDLS) that is based on inflatable structures. The EDLS is capable of decelerating the lander from interplanetary transfer trajectories down to a surface impact speed of 50–70 m s−1 with a deceleration of The EDLS is designed to orient the penetrator for a vertical impact. As the payload bay will be embedded in the surface materials, the bay's temperature excursions will be much less than if it were fully exposed on the Martian surface, allowing a reduction in the amount of thermal insulation and savings on mass. The MNL is well suited for delivering meteorological and atmospheric instruments to the Martian surface. The payload concept also enables the use of other environmental instruments. The small size and low mass of a MNL makes it ideally suited for piggy-backing on larger spacecraft. MNLs are designed primarily for use as surface networks but could also be used as pathfinders for high-value landed missions.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://www.geosci-instrum-method-data-syst-discuss.net/gi-2016-19/gi-2016-19-RC1.pdf","https://www.geosci-instrum-method-data-syst-discuss.net/gi-2016-19/gi-2016-19-RC2.pdf","https://www.geosci-instrum-method-data-syst-discuss.net/gi-2016-19/gi-2016-19.pdf","https://www.geosci-instrum-method-data-syst-discuss.net/gi-2016-19/gi-2016-19-RC1-print.pdf","https://helda.helsinki.fi/bitstream/handle/10138/178120/gi_6_103_2017.pdf?isAllowed=y&sequence=1","https://www.geosci-instrum-method-data-syst.net/6/103/2017/gi-6-103-2017.pdf","https://www.geosci-instrum-method-data-syst-discuss.net/gi-2016-19/gi-2016-19-AC2-print.pdf","https://www.geosci-instrum-method-data-syst-discuss.net/gi-2016-19/gi-2016-19-AC2.pdf","https://www.geosci-instrum-method-data-syst-discuss.net/gi-2016-19/gi-2016-19-AC1-print.pdf"],"title":"The MetNet vehicle: a lander to deploy environmental stations for local and global investigations of Mars","doi":"10.5194/gi-6-103-2017","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.5194/gi-6-103-2017","venue":""}

Some main diode parameters such as reverse-saturation current (Is), ideality factor (n), barrier height (BH) (= ΦB(I–V)), Rs, and rectification ratio (RR = IF/IR) at ± 3 V were calculated from the linear part of LnI–V plot as 2.14 × 10−9 A, 1.606, 0.750 eV, 30.5 Ω, and 106, respectively. Energy dependent values of Nss were also extracted from the I–V data by considering voltage dependent ΒΗ and n they decrease from mid-gap of Si towards the bottom of valance band (Ev) almost as exponentially. The doping atoms (Na), Fermi energy level (EF), (ΦB(C–V)), and depletion layer width (WD) were also calculated from the reverse bias C−2–V curves as function of frequency. The achievement of obtained results that manufactured (Ni-PVA) interlayer provide better performance in respect of lower values of leakage current, Nss, Rs, and higher values of RR and shunt resistance. The dielectric value of (Ni-PVA) interlayer was found as 1.44 from the interlayer capacitance (Ci = ε′εoA/di) even at 20 kHz and this is higher than the dielectric value of SiO2 at 20 kHz. However, this value can be increased by increasing a dopant level of Ni until 5–7%. Therefore, this interlayer can be successfully use an alternative interface layer compared to traditional oxide interlayers.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"The role of interface traps, series resistance and (Ni-doped PVA) interlayer effects on electrical characteristics in Al/p-Si (MS) structures","doi":"10.1007/s10854-019-02352-3","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10854-019-02352-3","venue":"Journal of Materials Science: Materials in Electronics"}

Nevertheless, genetic monitoring of elusive species like the European wildcat (Felis silvestris silvestris) mainly relies on such samples. Wildcats are likely threatened through introgression with domestic cats (F. silvestris catus). To determine introgression based on single cat hairs, we developed a 96.96 Fluidigm single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping array chip. To estimate the accuracy of this method, we compared genotypes of 17 cats called with both Sanger sequencing and Fluidigm. When Sanger sequencing genotypes were considered as a reference, the genotyping error rate with Fluidigm was 0.9 %. We subsequently compared 16 hair samples to tissue samples of the same individual. When the tissue samples were used as a reference, the genotyping error rate in hair samples was 1.6 %. This low error rate allowed reliable recognition of individuals and correct assessment of introgression levels. Thus, the genotyping method presented in this paper is suitable for non-invasively collected samples. It will help conservationists to monitor the introgression rate in wildcat populations based on non-invasive hair sampling and subsequently to conduct effective conservation measures.","inCitations":["5632d130890235a2ccb8df43e02bc86dc4f7c07f","ca3011da615c0ce10ac46a40e1ccc36a10d49cc7","7e7bd76ef316dffc34bd815fd85255983a427c62","3df97baf766f4e13ebcfdce9d0b4bdd83e66f214","49de2359e9864b23b48c31a6984d006b2b9dde9d","198f4627472613ff8206350a2baa3ccba2c71c3d","f6f8a5016563da09dbc11d40e536bad51f9bb3f6","f145394a7a9075b05ffa2df978b6f42194d3e252","68abe1587df01a67f42d924218eaf58debdb46e2","6b135335af4d1ebc9cdfe47836ddc6296a8d4229","c5e4fd8a7cb036992a2bacad266ac8b1b2c3ff0d","2c2e02d97e2eca0b0aa14d9710cb9a94354a5895","f095c30d87a7346a35babc334ce7ca17036b7b3b","dbac6a049de763e0208a50e2c356651779945d3b","9048963bff281860d4f08f9a51e62d32d23d9630","4df69256f57619c800bc425a67e5c82454d1c893","9421076495558d183e171dd818b1059e8530d763","c69e2204b93f5921ba16e63c099cbef1ea3c5664"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"A SNP chip to detect introgression in wildcats allows accurate genotyping of single hairs","doi":"10.1007/s10344-014-0806-3","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10344-014-0806-3","venue":"European Journal of Wildlife Research"}

Different drugs with different mechanisms of action have been tried in HSCT recipients to prevent hepatic VOD. However, it is uncertain whether high-quality evidence exists to support any prophylactic therapy.\n\n\nOBJECTIVES\nWe aimed to determine the effects of various prophylactic therapies on the incidence of hepatic VOD, overall survival, mortality, quality of life (QOL), and the safety of these therapies in people undergoing HSCT.\n\n\nSEARCH METHODS\nWe searched the Cochrane Central Registe of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, conference proceedings of three international haematology-oncology societies and two trial registries in January 2015, together with reference checking, citation searching and contact with study authors to identify additional studies.\n\n\nSELECTION CRITERIA\nWe included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing prophylactic therapies with placebo or no treatment, or comparing different therapies for hepatic VOD in people undergoing HSCT.\n\n\nDATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS\nWe used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.\n\n\nMAIN RESULTS\nWe included 14 RCTs. Four trials (612 participants) compared ursodeoxycholic acid with or without additional treatment versus placebo or no treatment or same additional treatment. Two trials (259 participants) compared heparin with no treatment. Two trials (106 participants) compared low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) with placebo or no treatment. One trial (360 participants) compared defibrotide with no treatment. One trial (34 participants) compared glutamine with placebo. Two trials (383 participants) compared fresh frozen plasma (FFP) with or without additional treatment versus no treatment or same additional treatment. One trial (30 participants) compared antithrombin III with heparin versus heparin. One trial compared heparin (47 participants) with LMWH (46 participants) and prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) (47 participants). No trial investigated the effects of danaparoid. The RCTs included participants of both genders with wide age range and disease spectrum undergoing autologous or allogeneic HSCT. Funding was provided by government sources (two studies), research fund (one study), pharmaceutical companies that manufactured defibrotide and ursodeoxycholic acid (two studies), or unclear source (nine studies). All RCTs had high risk of bias because of lack of blinding of participants and study personnel, or other risks of bias (mainly differences in baseline characteristics of comparison groups).Results showed that ursodeoxycholic acid may reduce the incidence of hepatic VOD (risk ratio (RR) 0.60, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.40 to 0.88; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 15, 95% CI 7 to 50, low quality of evidence), but there was no evidence of difference in overall survival (hazard ratio (HR) 0.83, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.18, low quality of evidence). It may reduce all-cause mortality (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.99; NNTB 17, 95% CI 8 to 431, low quality of evidence) and mortality due to hepatic VOD (RR 0.27, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.87; NNTB 34, 95% CI 16 to 220, very low quality of evidence). There was no evidence of difference in the incidence of hepatic VOD between treatment and control groups for heparin (RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.18 to 1.26, very low quality of evidence), LMWH (RR 0.27, 95% CI 0.06 to 1.18, very low quality of evidence), defibrotide (RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.38 to 1.02, low quality of evidence), glutamine (no hepatic VOD in either group, very low quality of evidence), FFP (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.20 to 2.17, very low quality of evidence), antithrombin III (RR 0.13, 95% CI 0.01 to 2.15, very low quality of evidence), between heparin and LMWH (RR 1.96, 95% CI 0.80 to 4.77, very low quality of evidence), between heparin and PGE1 (RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.58 to 2.50, very low quality of evidence), and between LMWH and PGE1 (RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.24 to 1.55, very low quality of evidence). There was no evidence of difference in survival between treatment and control groups for heparin (92.6% vs. 88.7%) and defibrotide (HR 1.04, 95% CI 0.54 to 2.02, low quality of evidence). There were no data on survival for trials of LMWH, glutamine, FFP, antithrombin III, between heparin and LMWH, between heparin and PGE1, and between LMWH and PGE1. There were no data on quality of life (QoL) for any trials. Eleven trials reported adverse events. There was no evidence of difference in the frequency of adverse events between treatment and control groups except for one trial showing that defibrotide resulted in more adverse events compared with no treatment (RR 18.79, 95% CI 1.10 to 320.45). These adverse events included coagulopathy, gastrointestinal disorders, haemorrhage and microangiopathy. The quality of evidence was low or very low due to bias of study design, and inconsistent and imprecise results.\n\n\nAUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS\nThere is low or very low quality evidence that ursodeoxycholic acid may reduce the incidence of hepatic VOD, all-cause mortality and mortality due to VOD in HSCT recipients. However, the optimal regimen is not well-defined. There is insufficient evidence to support the use of heparin, LMWH, defibrotide, glutamine, FFP, antithrombin III, and PGE1. Further high-quality RCTs are needed.","inCitations":["b7f1df7f6e210f3031b10da7280e650663a22473","56edbd350f557d5880cc7a9c7234005beb4fe68e","2f5fc5a2675ca42f22eb0594c18896348c80b20d","71d5638f95dba08e320c1b2e95e1965596a1f8c7","fe0b0b28d36bd00a67c7fc934efbef6fd27a1bc7","d24eb6c47f5c849160e78e74b894229da3a3ed40","20452fe35cb6c0afb4a3958ec6b12f908f6793f7","9f1951ec748953d4f22aae3b81eba0a72298f46c","f76cec5ac70273d4a8f96d4b6d1742c382f0a183","709e47929ae3ad2d195cd44f669451f3a3d02a6c","003d0e87d3d9897311a1dafb5e91623978872c37","665c11fefc833de969e7788dccbd0918ddfddfe1","875da775c77cebb8fbc35daaecf7cf219c50bf07"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Interventions for prophylaxis of hepatic veno-occlusive disease in people undergoing haematopoietic stem cell transplantation.","doi":"10.1002/14651858.CD009311.pub2","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD009311.pub2","venue":"The Cochrane database of systematic reviews"}

Most governments are committed to using these technologies to enhance their nations’ competitiveness in the global economy and to improve the internal operations of public agencies. However, just as ICT can offer nations potential opportunities to improve the economic and social quality of citizens’ lives, challenges to national success also exist. Effective implementation of national economic development policies that integrate economic, social and technological strategies are essential to compete effectively in the globalised economy of the twenty-first century. There is growing urgency for policy makers to incorporate ICT into economic policies because of expanding international competition for such resources as skilled labor, investment funds and trade. ICT has clearly become an important part of national strategy, largely due to remarkable improvements in various technologies over the past two decades. Also, just in the past few years, there has been a significant up-tick in the adoption of such tools as the Internet, wireless communications, as well as “computing” that is embedded in all manner of goods and services. National economies have been evolving along a set of economic, political and social dimensions that interact with each other. Along with these traditional areas of influences on a nation’s economic development, ICT has become a major element. The first competitive element of a national economy is its business environment. The expected attractiveness of general business conditions plays an important role in attracting investment funds, for example. Healthy economies have industries that frequently are “high technology” (hightech), such as the software industry in India and the many ICT firms in Eastern China. Often, such industries lead to substantial economic growth in a national economy. However, neither India nor China yet ranks highly in terms of the quality of its business environment, compared to a majority of the nations on ‘E-readiness’. A country’s overall legal framework and specific laws for protecting property rights also affect the ability of an economy to compete. This entails more than simply protecting the rights of people and companies to enjoy the benefits of buildings, merchandise and patents. Nations also need to protect the rights associated with software, content and copyrightable materials.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://smartech.gatech.edu/bitstream/handle/1853/39804/Sussane_Dirks_Lessons_from.pdf?isAllowed=y&sequence=1"],"title":"Lessons from global E-readiness trends of national economies","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

There are also wide-spread indications in the scientific community that there is increased concern for ethical matters in science and that the time has arrived for more instruction in this area. One reason for this in bioengineering is the rapidly growing complexity of technology in both engineering and medical biology. The ensuing difficulty in communication cannot be remedied just with more technical information. Instead bioengineers need an improved understanding of medical education and practice, and medical ethics is fundamental to this. Ethical considerations are crucial to decision making and therefore to all areas of professional endeavor in bioengineering. As a framework for ethics education, bioengineers need to gain a better understanding both of medical education in general and of medical practice, particularly the case study method in education and the nature of decision making in medical practice. Key subject areas in medical ethics for bioengineers include rights and duties of physicians, determination of death, team ethics, patient privacy and informed consent, research ethics, and malpractice.

One-day design rainfalls for different return periods (i.e., 2, 5, 10, and 25 years) are used as the model input. During the optimization process, two conflicting objectives (i.e., the investment cost and the inundation-damage cost) are minimized to obtain the Pareto-optimal solutions by using the NSGA-II. Based on the posterior approach, the compromise solutions for different return periods are obtained.

However, recent measurements of the wave location and amplitude performed aboard the GEOS spacecraft have brought new pieces of information challenging these conclusions. Our calculations are based on the theoretical tool developed by Lyons [1974] but take into account the recently observed wave confinement within a few degrees from the magnetic equator. Under these conditions, we avoid the numerical averaging of the pitch angle diffusion coefficient over the whole line of force, and we can derive an analytical expression of the minimum wave amplitude required to cause strong pitch angle diffusion for plasma sheet electrons. This expression has the advantage to be easily tractable in further calculations, and permits us to evaluate the dependence of the results on parameters that are not reported by observations, such as the wave number spectrum. Our results are found to differ from Lyons's [1974] predictions by a factor of about 2.5, and typically, a wave amplitude of more than 2 mV m−1 is required to put 1-keV electrons on strong diffusion. On the other hand, on the basis of a statistical analysis of electron cyclotron wave amplitudes measured in the nightside plasmasheet by the GEOS 2 spacecraft, we show that most of the time (>91 %), this typical value of 2 mV m−1 is not reached. This result appears inconsistent with the hypothesis that diffuse auroras, which are a permanent feature of the auroral zones, are due solely to electrostatic electron cyclotron waves. This leads us to the conclusion that these waves are not the only cause of diffuse electron precipitation. It is suggested that other mechanisms involving for instance the dynamics of the ions (such as field-aligned currents) could play an important role.","inCitations":["85245ed0087e85355fead113ba7095f6714df50a","a500fd33c8b07287eb42c6cac75c1b7ef7032cfd","6b2d709efe1922f99c5501bb262a0f98201980b2","17b234dfa8697603a7fdb69045bd57d31f7eed93","d8dc73524cacc83192dcff3ff8f351e983db952a","7949bfce14c8e9daddb6adc3653ff223d4cac1d0","157b9763ad8d41e80cb6fc2040577c4d67ab26c0","ed307a190f7b68642243415d9ee6a93aee10f59a","d3356adda26bcc4d7b9caef30dabd98b467a2597","df6e3dd7eaa6ffa333613b2abc66a9fe84ef2813","2a8d258dcd4fb1be02cf32cddea8e7a74f20f98f","68f2854f80d422ac0754e1184ac3685937dc70ed","15d1e6a95778b70fdba9cecae4c298085f218c78","941812c54193a04a35b64541e130ca05244b821b"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Are equatorial electron cyclotron waves responsible for diffuse auroral electron precipitation","doi":"10.1029/JA088iA11p09163","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1029/JA088iA11p09163","venue":""}

On the other side, controlled fuel-rich combustion is a largely used process for carbon black synthesis [1] and it was found to be suitable for the synthesis of fullerenes [2] and nanotubes [3]. PAH are thought to be key intermediates in soot and fullerene formation [2] and kinetic models of increasing complexity have been developed in order to approach a quantitative assessment of fuel-rich combustion [4, 5]. In the present work, a semi-detailed kinetic model for the oxidation and pyrolysis of several fuels [6] was extended to describe soot particle formation using the sectional technique proposed by Pope and Howard [7] and further developed [8-10]. Classes of particles with increasing molecular mass were defined and numbers of carbon and hydrogen atoms corresponding to the average mass of each class were assigned. According to experimental data, H/C ratios decrease with increasing particle size. Particles up to about 70 nm diameter are included. Kinetic parameters describing growth reactions have been chosen based on published data, taking into account the increase of the collision cross sections with particle size. Model predictions of PAH and soot concentration are compared with experimental data of a fuel-rich premixed atmospheric benzene/air flame [11]. In recent work [12, 13], the same approach for soot formation was used to extend a different kinetic scheme [14] to model a low pressure benzene flame with encouraging results.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://www.combustion-institute.it/proceedings/proc2003/503.PDF"],"title":"Modeling of PAH and Soot Formation in Laminar Premixed Flames","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

These institutions main agenda is to produce skilled work-ready graduates. Being in its infancy, MTUN has yet to produce their first batch of Engineering Technology graduates. This article reports the evaluation of the facilities at MTUN, as part of a bigger research scope. The data collection method in this study is mainly qualitative, which comprise of interviews, observations and document analysis. The interview protocol and observation checklist were developed and validated by experts and found reliable after running a set of pilot interview and observation. Interviews were carried out on the lecturers, whereas observations were made in the classroom, laboratories and a teaching factory. Document analysis that was carried out was on the Code of Practice for Program Accreditation (COPPA) document. This study also adopted the quantitative method using survey questions on students’ satisfaction of the facilities related to the application-based practice oriented at the institutions. From the laboratories observations, interviews with the lecturers, analysis of COPPA document and survey questionnaires answered by students, it can be concluded that the laboratory facilities provided by the three MTUN are adequate for the current number of students.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://redfame.com/journal/index.php/ijsss/article/download/3236/3407"],"title":"Laboratory facilities for engineering technology programs in Malaysian technical universities","doi":"10.11114/ijsss.v6i5.3236","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.11114/ijsss.v6i5.3236","venue":""}

It is often referred to as a measure of memory-based change detection, because the elicitation of a prediction error response relies on the formation of a prediction, which in turn, is dependent upon intact memory of previous auditory stimulation. As such, the MMN is altered in conditions in which memory is affected, such as Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia and healthy aging. The most prominent pharmacological finding for MMN strengthens the link between MMN and synaptic plasticity, as glutamate N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDA-R) antagonists reduce the MMN response. However, recent data has begun to demonstrate that the link between NMDA-R function and MMN is not as clear as once thought, with low dose and low affinity NMDA-R antagonists observed to facilitate MMN.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0306452220300762","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306452220300762?dgcid=api_sd_search-api-endpoint"],"title":"The Role of Glutamate Neurotransmission in Mismatch Negativity (MMN), A Measure of Auditory Synaptic Plasticity and Change-detection","doi":"10.1016/j.neuroscience.2020.01.046","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroscience.2020.01.046","venue":"Neuroscience"}

The treatment of ACS has dramatically evolved over the last decade leading to a much more aggressive invasive approach in STand Non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction. Despite fast reperfusion strategies and optimal anti-atherosclerosis prophylaxis most patients will experience a progression of the disease in the years following diagnosis of coronary heart disease (CHD). Interestingly enough, thrombin generation markedly increases after acute cardiac events and persists for months after clinical stabilisation, suggesting a role of anticoagulant strategies beyond the use in the acute setting. New anticoagulants have been developed with the goal of reducing cardiovascular events in CHD patients while minimising the risk of bleeding. The new oral Xa-inhibitor, rivaroxaban, is the first out of a large selection of new anticoagulant agents to show a statistically significant reduction of a composite endpoint of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction and stroke in patients with ACS, compared to standard therapy.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://cardiovascmed.ch/en/resource/jf/journal/file/view/article/cvm/en/cvm.2012.01666/3bd9be348bc6b492052bbf234ba95f2c687689f3/cvm_2012_01666.pdf/"],"title":"New plasmatic anticoagulants after acute coronary syndromes","doi":"10.4414/cvm.2012.01666","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.4414/cvm.2012.01666","venue":""}

Interleukin-18 gene expression analysis was performed using real time quantitative PCR. Three biopsies were obtained from each patient. Two were taken from the lesional psoriatic skin and from uninvolved skin before starting treatment. A third lesional skin biopsy was taken at the end of 2 months of treatment. The treatment was in the form of topical steroids or oral systemic methotrexate.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOf all 16 studied patients, significantly increased IL-18 expression was noted in keratinocytes from psoriatic lesions before and after treatment when compared to keratinocytes from uninvolved skin (p = 0.001 and p = 0.002 respectively). The IL-18 expression in the skin lesions after treatment was significantly lower than lesional skin before treatment (p = 0.023). In psoriatic skin lesions of all studied patients IL-18 expression was significantly correlated with disease duration (r = 0.40 and p = 0.01) and clinical severity of psoriasis (r = 0.72 and p = 0.001).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIncreased IL-18 expression in keratinocytes from psoriatic lesions of our patients and its correlation with disease duration and severity supported the concept of psoriasis as a T cell mediated autoimmune disease. This could establish therapeutic and preventive approaches for psoriasis that ultimately lead to improved outcomes for patients.","inCitations":["04a9bd8ed73706c7c2632b44b95328216094f283","95a44a94c981500db4af07178d95e7798f4e631f","37c1eef131849589bfca3a13f7e5a7b62b8f2ffd","b2940ecfe559f73209800c0219470297b707ed8d","ebc5d1bed8d7392315e9cfd432fe5002b7438ed8","d1a272e51190dcd9875e8d2a03d04a2494da5d11","f981dc2681280b0f0b86703d863dc4cc27fd07cd","eab3c68def82a9f5502b4c4baa4f7a3c3c16b487","e715650395c36fe3c2269d1ab94ba45b31831f12","c042a8ca113beaec285ea086b0d1722eb838115f"],"pdfUrls":["https://www.termedia.pl/Journal/-19/pdf-15989-230?filename=Interleukin-18.pdf","https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/pmc/oa_pdf/0c/15/AMS-6-6-964.PMC3302712.pdf","http://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/pmc/0c/15/AMS-6-6-964.PMC3302712.pdf","ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/pmc/0c/15/Arch_Med_Sci_2010_Dec_29_6(6)_964-970.tar.gz","https://www.termedia.pl/Journal/-19/pdf-17245-10?filename=Interleukin-18.pdf","http://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/pmc/99/c5/AMS-7-4-713.PMC3258774.pdf","ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/pmc/99/c5/Arch_Med_Sci_2011_Aug_2_7(4)_713-719.tar.gz"],"title":"Interleukin-18 expression and the response to treatment in patients with psoriasis","doi":"10.5114/aoms.2011.24144","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.5114/aoms.2011.24144","venue":"Archives of medical science : AMS"}

The Q transformation is shown to be useful as an atomic operation in parallel arrays for computing the eigenvalue/singular value decomposition of Hermitian/arbitrary matrices, and three specific Q transformations that are needed in such arrays are identified. Issues related to the use of CORDIC for complex arithmetic are addressed, and implementations in both conventional (nonredundant) CORDIC and redundant and online modifications to CORDIC are described. If the time to compute a CORDIC operation in nonredundant CORDIC is T/sub c/, the Q transformations identified here can be evaluated and/or applied in 2T/sub c/ using four CORDIC modules for maximum concurrency. In either case, 0.5 T/sub c/ is required to account for scale factor correction. It is shown that a Q transformation can be evaluated and/or applied in /spl ap/10n, where n is the desired bit-precision.<<ETX>>","inCitations":["4951aae6825a6edba8a162e885fc2ba6e1777308","1f023501951f89d370cbcb3da87a39c977e5a333","69f9e2236d5f147fa1a07bc2cb4c47dec51ee720","1f22ec43bfbd5b200fca370b241f326d411241a5","ff484073dcebc69865477bd8d3d5ced0173efed7","34410f66cf3a09bc4fa7560d167776a7659b8887","458bbb0ee3c261d162999eaa09511cad59cc5acd"],"pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1109/ARITH.1993.378101"],"title":"Efficient complex matrix transformations with CORDIC","doi":"10.1109/ARITH.1993.378101","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ARITH.1993.378101","venue":"Proceedings of IEEE 11th Symposium on Computer Arithmetic"}

The same studies were made from November 1976 to December 1977 in one part of Okushiri Island, which is the source of seed supply for Toyoura. In Toyura, 0-year-old abalones began to appear in November, and ceased to grow for five months since December. They acquired the first annulus on shells of 21 to 22mm in length. The viability of young abalones was quite low, probably owing to the low water temperature of 0 to 1°C in early March. In Okushiri Islang, young abalones born in that year were found in December, with 3.1 mm-long shells. They continued to grow by 2mmin length per month from June of the next year to December, and then stopped growing and acquired the first annulus on 16.8mm-long shells. In spite of the good water condition for abalone survival in winter, always above 3°C in temperature, the growth rate there was lower than in Binosaki, the poorest place in shell growth in Toyoura.","inCitations":["ea4ccee9885d881a603b3029afb2f213760694ac","ee0f582886dc0e5c87c8f3f069d26f17da06ad9d","9d111bb33bc29db2f433c52bc3664ce89500dd7b","865b2661c64147318a88b5c4ea45db4360e9f3f5","2e48fd8511670b91001e9c57ce4b6ac06f3ecd46","45dc9ab0717da3338cde8ba46795638cb2effedf","416e44800df0bd377576004c09985f82ca263042","84cbecdcc5b268bd404b42b43e6ba4c977ea662b","cd6cdc00b79bb3fc2894790da3fbcc7f824ff2f6"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Studies on propagation of Ezo abalone, Haliotis discus hannai Ino-II.

Visual disorders are numerous and arising from diverse and complex causes. Deficits in visual function are highly disabling from a social point of view and in addition cause a considerable economic burden. For all these reasons there is an intense effort by the scientific community to gather knowledge on visual deficit mechanisms and to find possible new strategies for recovery and treatment. In this review, we focus on an important and sometimes neglected player of the visual function, the corpus callosum (CC). The CC is the major white matter structure in the brain and is involved in information processing between the two hemispheres. In particular, visual callosal connections interconnect homologous areas of visual cortices, binding together the two halves of the visual field. This interhemispheric communication plays a significant role in visual cortical output. Here, we will first review the essential literature on the physiology of the callosal connections in normal vision. The available data support the view that the callosum contributes to both excitation and inhibition to the target hemisphere, with a dynamic adaptation to the strength of the incoming visual input. Next, we will focus on data showing how callosal connections may sense visual alterations and respond to the classical paradigm for the study of visual plasticity, i.e., monocular deprivation (MD). This is a prototypical example of a model for the study of callosal plasticity in pathological conditions (e.g., strabismus and amblyopia) characterized by unbalanced input from the two eyes. We will also discuss the findings of callosal alterations in blind subjects. Noteworthy, we will discuss data showing that inter-hemispheric transfer mediates recovery of visual responsiveness following cortical damage. Finally, we will provide an overview of how callosal projections dysfunction could contribute to pathologies such as neglect and occipital epilepsy. A particular focus will be on reviewing noninvasive brain stimulation techniques and optogenetic approaches that allow to selectively manipulate callosal function and to probe its involvement in cortical processing and plasticity. Overall, the data indicate that experience can potently impact on transcallosal connectivity, and that the callosum itself is crucial for plasticity and recovery in various disorders of the visual pathway.","inCitations":["81107c29b2546bcaf15d33bc8a1995bb422190e1","76d9d13279bba084b1cde94b6e884a44663e39ad","cb793c4ce49aeb6b667fec6e85d3f0bad8f70dbf","9564e7a914a1dc8047be5ebd91c4690c8c722b99"],"pdfUrls":["https://fjfsdata01prod.blob.core.windows.net/articles/files/217024/pubmed-zip/.versions/1/.package-entries/fnsys-10-00086/fnsys-10-00086.pdf?rscd=attachment%3B+filename*%3DUTF-8''fnsys-10-00086.pdf&se=2019-03-16T04:17:40Z&sig=leMhZow4M4NSrLTcvjxD1yu7agOG1oJR2E%2BpYvrxeks%3D&sp=r&sr=b&sv=2015-12-11"],"title":"Reorganization of Visual Callosal Connections Following Alterations of Retinal Input and Brain Damage","doi":"10.3389/fnsys.2016.00086","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.3389/fnsys.2016.00086","venue":"Front.

The episodic form is a physiologic response to stress, anxiety, depression, emotional conflicts, fatigue, or repressed hostility. Treatment focuses on the use of over-the-counter or prescribed simple analgesics for pain relief. Successful treatment of the chronic form depends on recognition of depression or persistent anxiety states. Primary care physicians can effectively manage most of these patients with nonhabituating anxiolytic or antidepressant medications; however, referrals for psychotherapy may be required in some cases. When tension-type headaches occur in children and adolescents, the physician must explore the patient's family and social relationships as well as school performance. In addition to nonhabituating drug therapies, family counseling and biofeedback may be helpful. In coexisting migraine and tension-type headaches, nonhabituating analgesics may be used for the relief of acute pain; the use of ergotamine and triptans should be restricted to relief of the hard or sick headache. Tricyclic antidepressants or monoamine oxidase inhibitors are the gold standards for prophylaxis, although the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors may be indicated in less severe cases. Several forms of biofeedback have also proved effective. Nonetheless, some patients with this form of headache may require psychiatric treatment for severe depression.","inCitations":["6515cdcb44f18df207e99b0db75902cfa3494b76","f658203c8afbb8ff746b0677c7b74efa3a0daa34"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Tension-type headache.","doi":"10.1016/S1098-3597(99)90038-8","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/S1098-3597%2899%2990038-8","venue":"Clinical cornerstone"}

To reach the requirements coming from both end-users and legislations, several powertrain architectures and engine technologies are possible (e.g. SI or CI engines), with many new technologies, new fuels, and different degree of electrification. The benefits and costs given by the possible architectures and technology mix must be accurately evaluated by means of objective procedures and tools in order to choose among the best alternatives. This work presents a basic design methodology and a comparison at concept level of the main powertrain architectures and technologies that are currently being developed, considering technical benefits and their cost effectiveness. The analysis is carried out on the basis of studies from the technical literature, integrating missing data with evaluations performed by means of powertrain-vehicle simplified models, considering the most important powertrain architectures. Technology pathways for passenger cars up to 2025 and beyond have been defined. After that, with support of more detailed models and experimentations, the investigation has been focused on the more promising technologies to improve internal combustion engine, such as: water injection, low temperature combustions and heat recovery systems.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Powertrain Architectures and Technologies for New Emission and Fuel Consumption Standards","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

It is manifest in the numerous monographs on neonatal physiology, pathology and the care and treatment of well and sick babies. Knowledge is being consolidated and what were once regarded as ambitious and advanced procedures are becoming standard practice. Advances in the standard of care have saved the lives of many newborns and also, in contrast to what was feared, the survivors are healthier and lead better lives. That this is the case is apparent from recent reports from various centres, the Goteborg study giving perhaps the most convincing evidence for it. Therefore, we asked Professor Bengt Hagberg to review the changes which have occurred in the mortality and morbidity of children as a result of improvements in the neonatal care in this journal. All follow-up studies in the field of neonatology present one problem which perhaps should not be over-emphasised, but is important from the point of view of research. This is that so many changes are made so frequently in some nurseries, that even a carefully planned and executed study may fail to identify the factors which have lead to a lowering of neonatal mortality or morbidity. Paediatricians realise that in optimal pre and perinatal conditions severe cerebral damage in the newborn has become a rare disorder, and that even small pre-term babies survive unscathed, but it is more difficult to identify and evaluate the causal factors leading to the improvement in mortality and morbidity. It is clear that some of the improvement is due to the realisation that there must be an optimal supploy of oxygen and calories in the pre, intra and post-natal periods, that body temperature, blood pressure and bilirubin levels must be controlled precisely, and that infections must be treated promptly and efficiently with drugs which are not unnecessarily toxic to the newborn. On the other hand, the contribution that physical therapy can make to the well being of a baby once damaged is questionable.","inCitations":["c4c4ad672856be45b8588a1570956a13327f47ae"],"pdfUrls":["https://www.thieme-connect.com/products/ejournals/pdf/10.1055/s-0028-1091673.pdf"],"title":"Perinatal Brain Damage New","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

We present a summary of activities performed during two iterations of usability testing and describe our analysis methodology. This methodology incorporates several grouping and prioritizing methods which provide one of the major contributions of the work. During the course of the case study, we learned some valuable lessons which were specific to the Text REtrieval Conference (TREC). The TREC-specific lessons learned led to recommendations for changes in the TREC topic development and assessment tasks.

The major underlying concept is a smooth manifold of probabilistic assignments of a prespecified set of prior data (the “labels”) to given image data. The Riemannian gradient flow with respect to a corresponding objective function evolves on the manifold and terminates, for any \\(\\delta > 0\\), within a \\(\\delta \\)-neighborhood of an unique assignment (labeling). As a consequence, unlike with convex outer relaxation approaches to (non-submodular) image labeling problems, no post-processing step is needed for the rounding of fractional solutions. Our approach is numerically implemented with sparse, highly-parallel interior-point updates that efficiently converge, largely independent from the number of labels. Experiments with noisy labeling and inpainting problems demonstrate competitive performance.","inCitations":["d79c2fd6c912a71dd08d4c7ca7f7f12966113463","57c26e574f0f6fd47edfef4cf2410bf022411b8d"],"pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-46454-1_9","http://ipa.math.uni-heidelberg.de/dokuwiki/Papers/Astroem2016d.pdf","http://www.eccv2016.org/files/posters/P-3A-30.pdf"],"title":"A Geometric Approach to Image Labeling","doi":"10.1007/978-3-319-46454-1_9","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-46454-1_9","venue":"ECCV"}

We introduce probabilistic nondeter-minism to the language, calling the result pGCL. Important is that both forms of nondeterminism are present | both demonic and probabilistic: unlike earlier approaches, we do not deal only with one or the other. The programming logic of`weakest preconditions' for GCL becomes a logic of`greatest pre-expectations' for pGCL: we embed predicates (Boolean-valued expressions over state variables) into arithmetic by writing P ], an expression that is 1 when P holds and 0 when it does not. Thus in a trivial sense P ] is the probability that P is true, and such embedded predicates are the basis for the more elaborate arithmetic expressions that we call \\expectations\". pGCL is suitable for describing random algorithms, at least over discrete distributions. In our presentation of it and its logic we give two examples: an erratic`sequence accumulator', that fails with some probability to move along the sequence; and Rabin's `choice-coordination' algorithm. The rst illustrates probabilistic invariants; the second illustrates probabilistic variants.","inCitations":["087455a8f7ecda0268f8d1c032106551afff3287","01a619f9aae343253418860974d9add968769e3d","faad3f18c33a754105ae930e6fab5baae0d38075","a924a924592d567108c3ac913fdd1cc259da1902","3e1b089408f1da6eb4b8ec9ca7294712f1ba3e10","9e67543f2be403aedddbd2dc29883287be73b74b","59c2d2a476ca428943fb68841e452f97a12fbea9","12f613091de7cc2ae3f4f7d205acfe7608836cb4","4cc53672f5de0dd98a22fd3fb3e27e712ca211b1","e2e1e4d8f345f1a824a3a926f8c4255c515093d6","298d89e4f44a8bb29ea5c13a835541796b296289","25127a50dff10cc26d1f5054c879ccfb22fc7f99","56a6b577a69988bc5927993a197c0f1c4d3cbdc1","43a7d78b9a54ebd9374413f4207b952e616de6b7","43e9a9043906dab2b5a0d5ebd364f40d5bce6932","61cb9782157ae728eda33adc7610a2ed418f1809","784e213e9f8bb05dd10c0e20d3140c9c605d4a0c","2bb7e029b50af446a494cccfb32c482e66fe2365","de8033e0239effbda093edaf4d7f7f61eebb4b68","5ea4aacc08c5c1d2ffbe0789ebf5dc03b5b602d3","fda378064872ca06d3a4d44827d254866b103d9e","6450b05c267a67c45940125c5e88fb817ba732dd","7b038e7c603ae22e0606fccaff1098dcca732bea","518f43e3d74185cd15f9a8e9ef683b138b7187df","b120d7cf2cbefc0efbf68d3a6de5debc9d92fd22","77c30e25285fdf6b63254519ce61cb2a398bc1a4","3d64da15e6ed4febf491ab0ec20f2d004c810bcb","c0b0dc0390588bc137790d1ba146f94c0c9cc279","6a688aede1eb1e4e1e5f014dd1aea1392ceca62f","c01a70b30569903e58547da53e71ab28d887816a","de37ece6dcb3e92df4172af9c1c6243c6cd7cb4b","c015104bb193cbd7c20c79208ab3709e57b19589","531c2229a7681cc8275c6cc5423ddfae927cf11f","92f8bc1d825d5073734f13006149dc812e1f0db5","6bf5519e422ae7db12df9ed8de5cfbcc7040aca0","3f68056f77e613c6d5b119cb83ff5200686655ec","fe860e9da5e0283c9203a8308361bd2b9736bb56","dc2e65725d74057fdae0c4f5650c2df7779a2550","f8d63601b9cd7981613eae55831a2f2c329079aa","44d63afb7f6b5cbfc431a72b918c2e385165d272","52076d7fa298d8165d048acc17581f360718837d","8035e0fc7c2841ce8a3efd8408ff37f8e6097a73","3c0378a78e3cf9aef9c52e1257366aaea5ffed3d","2bbf4707b8555fd001b1d3248ca0b9815ac9bd46","c6b76e8cbcdfd9ff603408750db558e46a1b8ab1","47606b5421c43a2b3946a508dca60bb49e7d6ce1","8016c4e57d629039c2cb82fdf7a4dc3ca8249fe9","0af83cd97cd24a7a1d7ac6f8f65107676df2610f","cf7d1bbc4d29f2ec65dddf53bfe34547938ba529","464d37a0aedc821b41ca75e0ae09b9940fdb093e","4ade8d4d8660999cebdbb0662e02b5fbbc59b362","79821f5977e3721d01a5e5581b8c17d3ed078baa"],"pdfUrls":["http://web.comlab.ox.ac.uk/oucl/research/areas/probs/pGCL.ps.gz"],"title":"pGCL: formal reasoning for random algorithms","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

The design of oil and gas production equipment to safely withstand sand erosion and simultaneously optimize production requires a reliable erosion prediction tool. One of the key requirements for such a tool is that it correctly models both the erosion resistance of the exposed materials and the effects of the particle impact trajectories and velocities.","inCitations":["f85369d8f9f07db03ed6ebae1e89bd8ea947256c","93e75f78a01b28f12d4665d7b127af1c4be6bbe1"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Sand Erosion Experiments and Model Development for UNS N06625 Cladding and UNS S32750","doi":"10.4043/23356-MS","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.4043/23356-MS","venue":""}
