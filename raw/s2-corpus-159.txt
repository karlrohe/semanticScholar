To achieve this it is necessary that the transportunits are properly maintained, since they depend on the availability of the service, and theprovision of a public transport service quality directly affects the quality of life of citizens. InVenezuela, the urban public transport responsibility of municipalities, and in the case of  Maracaibo, is provided by the public and private sector. The objective of this research is tostudy the management of maintenance being carried out by public operators of publictransport. The research is descriptive and design field, no experimental transectional. Themethodology consists of: a) document review, b) application of measuring instruments,and c) analysis of the results. The results reveal that the maintenance management of theoperating companies is severe, according to the results of the applied standard,weaknesses have been in all areas. Predominant failure and corrective maintenance. Oneof the main causes of this situation is the lack of investment in infrastructure maintenance.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Gestión Del Mantenimiento De Autobuses Del Transporte Público Urbano En El Municipio Maracaibo","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

This scheme has been implemented giving us an octagonal solver. This early work makes it possible, in theory, to develop a mixed solver. However, there is a practical obstacle: the lack of representation for both integer and real variables in solvers in CP. A solution is to do the opposite: use abstract interpretation abstract domains that do not depend on the variables type, and add the CP resolution process in AI. In this chapter, we present CP using only notions from AI. We then present an abstract solver, AbSolute, implemented on top of an abstract domain library.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"An Abstract Solver: AbSolute","doi":"10.1016/B978-1-78548-010-2.50005-2","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-1-78548-010-2.50005-2","venue":""}

This article takes a broadly phenomenological approach to IR where human “knowers” and the \"known” (where “the known” is intrinsically human, even if a “material” object) are fundamental assumptions. IR as an activity can then be parsed into three “life-worlds”: that of academic “knower”; that of “state-actors”; and that of “ordinary people.” This article suggests a merger of the three life-worlds into one, that of the “movie-goer”. It then speculates on the kinds of “knowledges” this might produce in supplementing or supplanting conventional views in IR as to who “knows” and from what materials (and hence methods) they “know” international politics.","inCitations":["38321a01a45c994f16aaee0e8d9ef996e68b7e5b","7ba1b9c6268c01cc49a4e6242de9d584a1dedd52","cb211fca05189fdf4f6f994367f9a4f61a5cb6ba","e0a9d12bb9bf7d98a689386a5bce6543162bb5f9","5cc671c80ddbde72bd198b0507a33ca6e33a6c24","940c725e467d01548851cb3c1583a2fdb4c6f6d3"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Cinematic Ontologies and Viewer Epistemologies: Knowing International Politics as Moving Images","doi":"10.1080/13600826.2010.485556","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1080/13600826.2010.485556","venue":""}

But more important than these factors or any institution of statecraft was the anticipation of defeat and defeat itself. When life could not continue as usual, and the state armies had been conquered, one was forced to answer the question: Who are we? The biblical architects of Israel's memories responded to this question by (selectively) gathering fragments of their collective past and using this material to construct a narrative that depicts the origins of a people and the history leading up to the major catastrophe. Much of the historical narrative treats the period before the rise of the monarchy, and portrays Israel existing as a people long before it established a kingdom—or to use later European political terminology, it portrays Israel existing as a nation before it gained statehood. This \"national\" consciousness represents the precondition for the writing of Israel's history and the maturation of its rich theological and political tradition. In demonstrating these points, the article critiques two trajectories of contemporary scholarship: one that follows Julius Wellhausen in viewing the community that emerged after the loss of statehood as a form of \"church,\" and another that sees the great moments of state power as the primary context for the formation of the Hebrew Bible and the rich theological-political thought contained therein.","inCitations":["6a60cb20ee2d48b40c36ff257461cec86aba2a05","1069008a0be76b6311b43fa275c004f7254f97d3","9c1e4c0ef61a781881036441357853e8991a1262","870f15df163a95c6237286549c818443bafa2cfc"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"The Commemoration of Defeat and the Formation of a Nation in the Hebrew Bible","doi":"10.2979/pft.2009.29.3.433","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.2979/pft.2009.29.3.433","venue":""}

As teachers become aware of IF strategy effectiveness, the students will receive better instruction and feedback that best contribute to their listening comprehension (Rassaei & Moinzadeh, 2011). This study also provides the EFL teachers with an understanding on input enhancement of listening in foreign language learning to correct their students' errors in the classroom in an interactive modality. IF includes negotiation and recasts. It occurs when the teacher indicates that the errors exist through working with the students about the identification of errors (e.g. by highlighting) or informing the students about the nature of the errors through the correction of the errors. Here, teachers do not provide the correction thus letting the students know that there is a problem, however, leaving it to them to solve it (Shirani Bidabadi & Yamat, 2011). Direct or explicit feedback, on the other hand, refers to overt correction of errors when the teacher provides the correct form or structures for the students. When the students revise the text, they just need to correct forms in the final version (Motallebzadeh & Amirabadi, 2011).Error correction has a long history in the fields of foreign and second language learning. In meaning centered classes, the focus is usually on the meaning negotiated between the students and the teacher and so the emphasis is placed on fluency rather than accuracy (Nassaji, 2007). Corrective feedback, however, is one of the effective techniques which have been employed in L2 classrooms. Learning requires feedback. Otherwise, the learners have no means of judging the extent and appropriateness of their learning (Ellis, 2006). Corrective feedback was defined by Lightbown and Spada (1999) as: any indication to the learners that their use of the target language is incorrect. This includes various responses that the learners receive. When a language learner says \"He go to school every day\", corrective feedback can be explicit, for example, 'no, you should say goes, not go' or implicit 'yes he goes to school every day', and may or may not include metalinguistic information, for example, 'Don't forget to make the verb agree with the subject\" (171-172).Bitchener (2008) argues that corrective feedback may improve learners' listening skills. He argues that feedback from teacher is an important part of learning process and it can help learners to remove learning gaps and ambiguities. On the one hand, if the correct form is presented to learners they have the opportunities to compare their own form with the one provided. In such case, corrective feedback is like hypothesis testing. On the other hand, if the corrective feedback does not present the correct form, it can encourage the learners to use their own resources in reformulating the incorrect form. In both ways, corrective feedback can help L2 development (Nassaji, 2011).There are different types of feedback in language learning and teaching. Lyster and Ranta's (1997) identified seven major feedbacks including Clarification Request, Explicit Feedback, Elicitation, Repetition, Metalinguistic Feedback, Implicit Feedback and Recasting. These seven different corrective feedback (CF) types are classified into two CF main categories include reformulations and prompts. Reformulations include recasts and explicit correction, because both these moves supply learners with target reformulations of their non-target output (Ellis, Loewen & Erlam, 2006).

We analyzed associations between habitual diet (including macronutrients, dietary patterns, biomarker of fish intake) and lipoprotein particle subclass profile in young adults.\n\n\nMETHODS AND RESULTS\nComplete dietary data (food-frequency questionnaire) and lipoprotein subclass profile (via nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy) were available for 663 subjects from the population-based FinnTwin12 study (57% women, age: 21-25 y). The serum docosahexaenoic to total fatty acid ratio was used as a biomarker of habitual fish consumption. Factor analysis identified 5 dietary patterns: \"Fruit and vegetables\", \"Meat\", \"Sweets and desserts\", \"Junk food\" and \"Fish\". After adjustment for sex, age, body mass index, waist circumference, physical activity, smoking status and alcohol intake, the \"Junk food\" pattern was positively related to serum triglycerides (r = 0.12, P = 0.002), a shift in the subclass distribution of VLDL toward larger particles (r = 0.12 for VLDL size, P < 0.001) and LDL toward smaller particles (r = -0.15 for LDL size, P < 0.001). In addition, higher scores on this pattern were positively correlated with concentrations of small, dense HDL (r = 0.16, P < 0.001). Habitual fish intake associated negatively with VLDL particle diameter (\"Fish\" pattern and biomarker) and positively with HDL particle diameter (biomarker).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nOur results suggest that in young adults, higher habitual fish consumption is related to favorable subclass distributions of VLDL and HDL, while junk food intake is associated with unfavorable alterations in the distribution of all lipoprotein subclasses independent of adiposity and other lifestyle factors.","inCitations":["57807c457a91ed869045bfb0675d7c09077db36c","a8dcee62eb5d4b7818af0bacdc8baad335121159","533b2d12e909dd4d2abb0bb2198da89a68d59777","d5501764311a52f26ba36a3d37e28ff0a53a3292","1d6f5b7f88141fda0f683708ca35f52d4d4553a2","d40ca8a7d343aa27406686fed56132c68f05e5a4","2b3637973fafc9a791337c1d67204f245547dbc9","3be92ada4a3587ada619e7cdc4d6a9ffdb706434","a0345e1c7e02f5d4cc3606006a2d45cfd4f427ad","d7a40a3b5697b69734024e55529518cddc1c28b4","f34a4a2737bd29efe852b0ebe3d32c4a4e572924","8d23d93ab60275e853c26d9ff834be1e23be5ae3","3ac73baa67fef751d80e8e37b29ce8ffc570b7ee","2b7ffb5c8cb5082957371cde6418330ca6045cf1","db59a81203289d04c053efea7dfc33a69f3a64f8"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Association between habitual dietary intake and lipoprotein subclass profile in healthy young adults.","doi":"10.1016/j.numecd.2012.11.007","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.numecd.2012.11.007","venue":"Nutrition, metabolism, and cardiovascular diseases : NMCD"}

This work focuses on thermodiffusion in a biological context, where there are two major applications for the effect: accumulation of a component in microfluidic devices through a combination of thermodiffusion and convection, and monitoring of protein binding reactions through the sensitivity of thermodiffusion to complex formation. \nBoth applications are investigated, the first as an accumulation process in the context of origin-of-life theories and the second in light of the question what we can learn from the observed changes in thermodiffusion about modifications of the hydration shell upon complex formation. \nWhile thermodiffusion in non-polar liquids can be predicted with reasonable accuracy, the description of aqueous systems is complicated as their concentration and temperature dependence is often anomalous. The underlying goal of this work is to gain a better understanding of the interactions between components in an aqueous mixture and how they influence thermodiffusion. \n \nWe find that the temperature dependence of a solute's thermodiffusion correlates with its hydrophilicity and argue that the temperature sensitivity of hydrogen bonds, which dominate the interactions in aqueous solutions, might induce a temperature dependence of the chemical potential. Such a temperature dependence is as of yet not considered in theoretical descriptions of thermodiffusion. Numerical calculations show that the thermophoretic accumulation process, as of yet only considered for the formation of RNA, can accumulate formamide to high concentrations that would allow the formation of prebiotic molecules. A heuristic model is developed to illuminate the mechanism behind the accumulation. \nCyclodextrins and streptavidin were investigated as model systems for biological complexes. It is feasible that the exquisite sensitivity of thermodiffusion to interactions with the surrounding solvent allows inferences about changes in the protein's hydration shell upon complex formation.

Methods A total of 28 patients with repaired complete unilateral cleft lip and palate (CUCLP) and 20 age- and gender-matched individuals without clefts were identified. A panel of orthodontists rated and ranked nasal esthetics from nose casts for the cleft group. Best and worst esthetic cleft groups were established from the cast assessments. Three-dimensional surface coordinates of the casts were digitally mapped with an electromagnetic tracking device. Digitized nasal images were oriented, voxelated, sliced, and mathematically curve-fitted. Maximum difference, percent area difference, and maximum and minimum derivative differences between cleft and noncleft and between right and left nose sides were calculated. Differences in parameters between groups were assessed with the use of analysis of variance (ANOVA) and t tests, and correlations with esthetics were assessed with the Spearman rank correlation test. Results Differences were seen between cleft and noncleft and best and worst esthetic groups for all four parameters (p < .05). The best esthetic cleft group had (1) lower percent area difference (p < .0001), (2) lower maximum difference (p < .001), and (3) smaller differences in slope of the nose in the coronal plane (p < .0001) than the worst esthetic cleft group. Conclusions Maximum difference and maximum derivative difference and, to a lesser degree, percent area difference can be used to identify differences between cleft and noncleft nasal morphology and to assess levels of nasal esthetics for patients with CUCLP.","inCitations":["7564e03348c5139d0c847470a217ae640a906646","af24795fcc95eb30820d6409808f6655b5ef8835","c5bf3fe5418bfa70de259b5c9e96685069436a4c"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Three-Dimensional Morphologic Nasal Surface Characteristics that Predict the Extremes of Esthetics in Patients with Repaired Cleft Lip and Palate","doi":"10.1597/09-040","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1597/09-040","venue":"The Cleft palate-craniofacial journal : official publication of the American Cleft Palate-Craniofacial Association"}

This paper develops an integrated framework for analyzing two forces expected to equalize economic opportunity across areas: commuting and migration. Our framework is applicable to any level of spatial aggregation, and we use it to assess their contribution to labor market adjustment across British wards (or neighborhoods). Commuting offers only limited insurance against local shocks, because commutes are typically short and shocks are heavily correlated spatially. Analogously, migration fails to fully equalize opportunity because of strong temporal correlation in local demand shocks.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://cep.lse.ac.uk/pubs/download/dp1623.pdf"],"title":"CEP Discussion Paper No 1623 June 2019 Commuting , Migration and Local Joblessness","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Virtual reality systems are being developed to engage the user as fully as possible within a computer-supported environment. This paper describes an on-going implementation of an environment that allows remote interaction with equipment and other participants that previously required co-location. Technology is used to extend a telecommunications laboratory (lab) to enable acquisition of cognitive, affective and psychomotor skills. New hardware and software are being applied to develop a virtual lab experience through which remote students can attain learning objectives as well as students that use a traditional face-to-face (F2F) lab environment. A same-time/different-place (STDP) learning environment can be both a cost effective and convenient way to educate students. The design, development, and assessment of such a system is presented.","inCitations":["23c7aec96a8e0cd21882bf0f6b1437def594ad1d","3eab375e50be6a217f75e4ba974d8fa8e47b1f35","1ff61061e28b4381af071902fd855012a8ee09e6"],"pdfUrls":["http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/HICSS.2004.1265067"],"title":"An assessment of eLearning technologies to support telecommunications laboratory learning objectives","doi":"10.1109/HICSS.2004.1265067","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HICSS.2004.1265067","venue":"37th Annual Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences, 2004.

Disc-shaped test samples of maxillofacial silicone elastomers (Cosmesil, Episil, Multisil) were fabricated according to manufacturers' instructions under aseptic conditions. Samples were then divided into three groups: (1) not aged; (2) aged for 150 h with an accelerated weathering tester; and (3) aged for 300 h. Then the samples were placed in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium/Ham's F12 (DMEM/F12) for 24, 48, and 72 h. After the incubation periods, cytotoxicity of the extracts to cultured fibroblasts (L-929) was measured by MTT assay. The degree of cytotoxicity of each sample was determined according to the reference value represented by the cells with a control (culture without sample). Statistical significance was determined by repeated measurement ANOVA (p < 0.01) followed by Duncan's test (p < 0.05). All test materials in each group demonstrated high survival rates in MTT assay (Episil; 93.84%, Multisil; 88.30%, Cosmesil; 87.50%, respectively); however, in all groups, Episil material demonstrated significantly higher cell survival rate after each of the experimental incubation periods (p < 0.05). Accelerated aging for 150 and 300 h had no significant effect on the biocompatibility of maxillofacial silicone elastomers tested (p > 0.05).","inCitations":["d9d14780e7f636aa579f1335f0cd93eef88663db","cc9b22fe477d5a107131e61000f3e276dafc41d3","506c00c52ab8819830b725f0e3837e01f56287ea","cf595eab8ad347d75515a7c383c4147edf761bdb","5470511fde91543032f00d20f483cb4b159abbde","48f7d0784a1def4c5f8c792220048ccf5d286551","230b0e76e33fc7ce4d242158c489294b07aa8ff2","a4ae992757e4535a766f11f1b1b6fd132361c3db","a931898d02b93a2df8b53de257f746f77d532545","24b127643790e77020ba35610df2b090f17476b2","ddd95575d5315e38cad4ba14dcfa01076da45f50","4e8855537256ee106a3fc3ecf41f0e1393f47470","7bdcfa6b9060a6b9f207d5ef7725af79c25f2810"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"In vitro cytotoxicity of maxillofacial silicone elastomers: effect of accelerated aging.","doi":"10.1002/jbm.b.31194","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1002/jbm.b.31194","venue":"Journal of biomedical materials research.

Can J Gastroenterol 1993;7(2):127-131. Corticosteroids remain the most effecttve treatment for the management of patients with acute inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The superior efficacy of corticostcroiJs has been demonstrated when administered topically for distal ulcerative colitis or systemically for pancolitas, and for active Cmhn's disease of the small bowel alone or when combined with colonic disease. Notwithstanding the symptomatic benefit of prednisone in acti\\'e Crohn's disease, however, only a minority of patients achieve endo~copic remission. Corticosteroids have a broad range of anti-inflammatory effects, including reductions of interleukin-I production by macrophages and interleukin-II synthesis by lymphocytes, inhibition of platelet-activating factor and decreased margmat1on of neutrophils. At pharmacological doses, corticosteroids also induce the synthesis oflipomodulin which, m tum, blocks phospholipase A2 and so ltm1ts availability of arachidonate for the production of leukotrienes and prostaglandins. Because corticosteroid treatment is associated with s1gmficant side effects, new agents have been sought to achieve equivalent efficacy but with a lower adverse event profile. This approach is predicated on structural changes to the basic hydrocortisone molecule to achieve potent topical anti-inflammatory effects, sufficient water and lipid solubility that allows dissolution within the inte~tinal lumen and rapid high-first pass metabolism by the liver to products with little or no biologic activity. Three steroid preparations JevelopeJ for rectal administration include ttxocortal pivalate, bcclomethasone and buJesonide. C.mcrolled trials undertaken in patients with active distal ulcerative colitis indicate each of these products has equivalent or superior efficacy when compared with hydrocortisone and without reductions of serum cortisol. Two preparations, t1uticasone and budesomde, have been developed for oral administration and preliminary studies suggest l.'fficacy for both drugs in patients with active ileal Crohn's disease. The first pass corticosteroids are potentially promising new therapeutic agents for the management of IBO.","inCitations":["8ac3d2c0cc2022a84c63b67453e735792cca0615"],"pdfUrls":["http://downloads.hindawi.com/journals/cjgh/1993/473746.pdf"],"title":"Corticosteroid Therapy for IBD: Old and New","doi":"10.1155/1993/473746","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1155/1993%2F473746","venue":""}

Analysis on Misconception of Basic Physics to Students of International Class Program of Physics Department at the Faculty of Mathematics and Science in Universitas Negeri Makassar (supervised by Jasruddin and Muris). \n This study is a survey research which meant to examine the misconception experienced by the students of internasional Class Program (ICP) of Physics Department at the FFaculty of Mathematics and Science (FMIPA) in Universitas Negeri Makassar (UNM), as well as to investigate the types of misconception and the sources of misconception experienced by the student. The result of this study is expected to give contribution to lecturers of basic physics to designthe learning to lessen the misconception of physics. \n Data on students’ misconception obtained through the physics misconception test with sub concept of mechanics, heat and thermodynamics, vibrations and waves, electric magnets and relativity. Those tests were arranged in English with True-False option. Moreover, the students were asked to write unfamiliar numbers of vocabulary on each question. This information was needed to examine whether their mistakes in answering the question were caused by lack of vocabulary. Interview technique was conducted to discover the sources of misconception. In this study, the regular group (non-ICP) was taken as a comparison particularly the language mastery (vocabulary). \n The result reveals that misconception experienced by the ICP students of Physics Department at FMIPA UNM is extremely high.

It is argued that the general approach of the WFD and the way information management is planned assures knowledge building on behalf of integrated water management in Europe, but that the development of concepts, which underpin the normative definitions and the exact monitoring approach still lags behind.","inCitations":["c9cbeedb06a06449fc98bb0ea846610e37df62e4","864b2451e38362a23b1309e2816c759502831f9d","42ad30c2a7232c31f749ecc21cef44d0ca3e04fa"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Consequences of the European Union water framework directive for information management in its interstate river basins","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Soil analyses had shown elevated levels of PCDD/F in garden soil (range 16.4-77.6 ng I-TE/kg). Vegetable plants also had elevated levels of PCDD/F, mainly due to airborne contamination. The highest levels were found in kale (2.6-65.6 ng I-TE/kg d.w.) and endive (1.7-28.5 ng I-TE/kg d. w.). The study population consisted of 5 females and 16 males (mean age 57 years; range 43-67 years), who had been cultivating their allotment gardens for an average of 20 years (range 7-36 years). About 50% of their total vegetable consumption and 30% of their fruit consumption were from their own gardens. The mean 2.3.7.8-TCDD toxicity equivalents (TE) of PCDD/F in blood fat were 44.3 pg I-TE/g fat (range 29.2-81.1 pg I-TE/g fat). Compared to reference data these values are within the range of background PCDD/F-levels in the German population. The concentrations in individual gardeners as well as the congener pattern were not different from those of normal subjects. The present study shows that increased levels of PCDD/F in garden soil and garden products do not have a significant effect on the PCDD/F burden in gardeners, even if they consume homegrown vegetables and fruits from their own allotment gardens for many years in succession.","inCitations":["bf1aab230b28f5859ba106f123b8573950f6cc84"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"[Dioxin level of small volume gardeners in Duisburg].","doi":"","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"Gesundheitswesen (Bundesverband der Arzte des Offentlichen Gesundheitsdienstes (Germany))"}

The trinuclear complex [Cu3(mal)3(H2O)]3- is trapped in a three-dimensional network with sodium cations. The three copper atoms are connected by alkoxo bridges and form an almost isosceles triangle with Cu...Cu distances of 3.076(1), 3.504(1) and 3.513(1) A. Two of the copper ions are also bridged by an extra aquo ligand. EPR spectroscopy combined with magnetic susceptibility measurements provide a powerful tool to resolve the electronic structure of the complex. The overall magnetic behaviour corresponds to an antiferromagnetically coupled triangular system. The 285 GHz-EPR spectrum (g = 2; 10.18 T) is characteristic of a spin state S = 1/2, with a rhombic anisotropy of [g]. This rhombic pattern allows us to propose that the electronic spin density is delocalised on the three copper ions.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Electron delocalisation in a trinuclear copper(II) complex: high-field EPR characterization and magnetic properties of Na3[Cu3(mal)3(H2O)] x 8H2O.","doi":"10.1039/B506934C","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1039/B506934C","venue":"Dalton transactions"}

In both animals, the stretch ratio is correlated to the cross-sectional area of the vessel wall.","inCitations":["0c595e72ef3b1906ad38a8f7bf9052aa08c31f88","0b1571d72cb7fa16689985c221cbcbfa9eff9e55","d9cd25ff4d38652bcf1795bbfd2d2fe42957d533","0e95c340e5295c644aba350f2c27b9c86bf97f99","5c6845857c55415fced1dcd8a40c6d44a7b613a6","6835b4480f4f3e5d279e1620b0c030c49f057486","c9c85e5d843a3978370be5f18e3852359bc9ee73","51b5a38aa00ae59201ba94253e2c55e73f190aca","270573e0287d0151c944cb034a94668d6486bf87","bcf1887c26f91a00e262b0244af5d099f730fff9","3a6d848191d82b169c1eebee17f17e104c31ef28","b3469531edac5488b32c1b8576fdf6d5fc28665f","12a0de870d557aaa4b15bd8f4a645282f114c5ab","1feeca56d71587d3f15e354fc177deec41299b36","187069429ee0f8dd69828eb8cef48c174318d9b7","69f2243d308b0f80261b7a87f197d8093053c01e","f2cec1aaaeed3fbc7fbea90513722e82ed9f4903","d2220b012502428086461ff9caa419475898756a","9730fc40957d4f15700dce42902ee16d2911f643","f010fc6a112df46f6a6bbcaf85d5731ec684f673","681f2c4eee259a042f310ce6e3afdc011b23ea5b","c1a9532b39664dc0e17a492bf6e8e0c026d52a8d","a2cb31c7472464bd270c088802b009e685be6e95","b9522cad6d9d7bbca2da5225c7443193416cff3b","5697c3dc03acd013eebaf755cc7bea6631b0b57a","cdc45dbb0a220da0e13eca23fb861483ece7c779","682abafb9fa99ad962eb6020d2f5cdfe64a23131","4b358d4b82fbe005be29916bd58446fbbe8599ec","6d3f2c1ece898261e452c6594fa5e55a7136e413","e36d155dad6cb4384bab2cbac4e2c785074a365d","0b0ff69f1f932b09577d6d7107f34bcd3b023ec6","fac09dae30be8934edf8a3026d0f6e05b876ff6f","9209ba2517fb87e9b26160d992671675c80d7f60","a7478f5920fc5069b1f2f44c599eef4b51e11cae","47439a7ba283a4f055a49ab875425205b9db4a65","d51bda98b344e914a12ce969cfeecdfd1b8e63ad","3cf279e91141805e3c91f3aec35994851bab5f02","73994110926dcf7bf0a1d2c7c88aab87fcd46543","c8312fdb373b0f7de5ed5c235628888d7096a930","2fb50ffd93e97cc49143e1cb85fb92937d7ae337","3f1e71213e2bfeffe7383cdfaa3db383f60503f3","584c69c92f72689909b7aad7a73338f9a72bcaff","cf050f214e0251f331d9da31af91da93d616f39a","ceaa74c974e1f66283f273f25b91f2ff240930a0","6bd105eee3234e6b342982b4ca8dfeadd8233afc","f8558713969deae7455c30f1fe1331c6cd6a87bd","de1ab5a0d9f2770d2d27a148be49ed7ecdff1d7b","391172cf7bd25aa4246445bff13f73bd5647a38d","2a66c5b543a332a4c556898bbe92818230ac8a90","3bedd557640ca713cb0a99c342e01c93a838160c","84624e4de1eb900a36419515e7fdd68a5867512f","8821867404ea2532aafe60858cd601d7642a257a","1ff98478cec3c6964187b15c703eef0e1a502c08","b1cf40d9e7757be2776f158f89e20a17ae119722","a4477bd1974d8425f8320544d46320470790030f","6cdddfb1138a35eb88838d2b4db0d3d1f32a3756","0f3e08463744314d7e1c94f20ec11d93c94d4ed5","952903292e8d76356f7f9afaa6c137f09a9021c7","074c939522795342865d7c3095da679dad65a59a","9d1339d74d00e65cfa75c4e189d366d2b102bace","7ea6a5fae6b53ce5898b8dac8bffec9e63bba520","4fab7ae776e3ed472c0c69f82376c75747104ee7","d5a400d173c4e3eb8e40e0e574c6d772f6fbdc0f","36ff7b7f22763020792bd878d61cc1fd555039c8","d7736d906ae81a4398b0ab2af09b8a7e6f0bf284","da7b97c1ed29dacc5edc130653bd7105fea97cbe","b0e5732afc25ae9a28e1b9d593898221955b23a7","9f1e6a08b9e5c313c0cea8af6adb163030f8bfca","d59e24c2fe63b95e9ada3e9a1141e6ffbf6864d6","c21d6ebde736e777f8cd3d7bdbf28bcb03b9de2d","4567ca983ca4f550139adcfb920b216caf8d1796","64e70c9487a760dc4ef18c8c8c064cbb78fbc899","90dd721999904b21f34c9b6cebb8a5fa32b34734","f1d99d826151b07d7ab3cbb49cb78109407b15f8","bc19c265db54405c86505adc822aefe3795797ef"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Longitudinal strain of canine and porcine aortas.","doi":"10.1016/0021-9290(94)00091-H","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/0021-9290%2894%2900091-H","venue":"Journal of biomechanics"}

To achieve this, a survey was carried out between January and July, 2014. In 7 sample districts purposively and randomly selected for this study, 140 households were randomly selected to elicit their perceptions of socio-economic impact of Nigerian Brewery Company on Kaduna South Local Government Area, using self-rated questionnaire. Data collected were analysed using descriptive statistics and Principal Component analysis (PCA). The results of these analyses depicted the positive and negative impacts of the Nigerian Brewery Company on Kaduna South LGA. Using Principal Component Analysis (PCA), 9 social impact variables of the company were reduced to two major components (provision of social facilities and insecurity) impacting on the area. These two major components together explained 94.97% of the cumulative variance of our PCA. On the other hand, 9 economic impact variables were also reduced to three major components ( increase in standard of living, high cost of living and increase in commercial activities, and increase in income generation) impacting on the area. These three major components of economic impact on the area, together explained 95.53% of the cumulative variance of our PCA. Based on our findings, recommendations were made on how to improve the socio-economic conditions of the people of the area by the shareholders of the Nigerian Brewery.

Es una patologia comun en Espana aunque historicamente no habia generado problemas de importancia. Sin embargo, en los ultimos anos (desde 2008) se observo un aumento de la incidencia y severidad de la infeccion, provocando mermas de rendimiento y preocupacion en el sector productivo de Castilla La Mancha y La Rioja (principales regiones productoras de champinon). \nCon el objetivo de generar conocimiento para combatir y minimizar las perdidas provocadas por esta enfermedad, desde el Centro de Investigacion, Experimentacion y Servicios del Champinon (CIES) se han realizado diversos trabajos de investigacion a traves de proyectos nacionales financiados por INIA con fondos FEDER (RTA2010-00011-C02 y E-RTA2014-00004-C02).

Antecedentes y justificacion El aumento de brotes de enfermedad en cultivos espanoles de champinon asi como la severidad de los mismos ha motivado un estudio en campo con el objetivo de aportar una perspectiva global sobre el impacto de la enfermedad en los cultivos comerciales. \nCladobotryum dendroides era la especie historicamente identificada como agente causal de la telarana en Espana, aunque son varias las especies del genero Cladobotryum asociadas con la enfermedad (Grogan y Gaze, 2000). En los ultimos anos, coincidiendo con el repunte de la patologia, en la comarca productora castellanomanchega se ha producido un transito progresivo desde los materiales de cobertura tradicionales, de base mineral, hacia materiales tipo turba.

Two hundred and ten (210) preschoolers were given the Sprigle School Readiness Screening Test (SSRST) and the Beery Test of Visual Motor Integration (VMI) while physicians rated the children's attention span. A parental questionnaire assessed medical, behavioral, social, and family variables. Follow-up school data were available on 176 children (84%). Using regression techniques, reading and math achievement scores were directly correlated with maternal education, SSRST and VMI results, and lack of family history of learning problems, whereas grade failure was associated with low VMI scores, decreased maternal education, boys with late birthdays, and family history of learning problems. Medical problems and parental preschool behavior concerns were unrelated to school achievement, but physician rating of preschool attention span showed a significant correlation with reading and math scores. A 0-11 Risk Index of School Capability (RISC) scale based on data analyses was developed to rate a preschooler's early academic potential. A score of 7 or above had a 98% positive predictive value of successful grade completion, whereas a score of 3 or below had a 70% predictive value for grade failure. The value of assessing the scores of the VMI and SSRST alone was also considered, but was found less useful. This study demonstrates the importance of evaluating a number of risk factors in assessing a preschooler's early academic potential. Such data can be used to focus school resources for children at increased risk for grade failure.","inCitations":["cb368d441327659f1394a31d3e1946b6b9452db3","f6521f0e6eb7f90a41ab2110c757fca58f5eff11","1ee3ad16284970712d4f46df70b4e567697a776e","4823c25f77581c2148a1df63ec33e0e692835418","bfa7659a855b0a0970d94e661bf5daafe30238ae","6f9b1fa5fb9df4ea6f50423137884897e20c054f","e8a1a1a6038959db4f7ba4e99c208d812aec8dc0","0b13fe60b00dc4af1eac21eb7bd52ba237785d40","0bec1a9f5bcc5f2a21f1cf1fc6b02f7a136e42a9","5117b73db8c42ac861e628ae9402493ca4a4caf9","93f8131b4672221a3aa192d0360bfde89c8e3e49","18693d72e693c1eeb4c9edcc5c675206c80517f6","ab5dc9c64d9aec6d281028b4edbcf7903f044fab","e67b8ea189ab70f97f230bb23e86a669d9736934","9a062df548a7a1ce24d6ff86f2b1f44bdfe52104","97e5a48f0e47f147bb47f927be40ecca1c5e215e","61acb3f0c336708b072d9187181805e86426a030","8a62b9ed905876532b024079773cc03c47ee9b52","4a9302ec7a2ef79f3c4c73d1a9fe18ffcebe19b9","d90b86e4ddcbb161ec781959a49a6414419de40a","b5a3287b6a3f0b88be8c17e34977d6eeabcec97c","f1166883c3fd32364e82641c2f3edeeecdc1a67d"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Preschool risk factors as predictors of early school performance.","doi":"10.1097/00004703-198608000-00004","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1097/00004703-198608000-00004","venue":"Journal of developmental and behavioral pediatrics : JDBP"}

The aim of our review is to evaluate whether GPC3 has utility as a disease-specific biomarker, to discuss the potential involvement of GPC3 in cell biology, and to consider the changes of GPC3 gene and protein expression and regulation in hepatocellular carcinoma, lung cancer, severe pneumonia, and ARDS.ResultsImmunohistochemical studies have suggested that over-expression of GPC3 is associated with a poorer prognosis for hepatocellular carcinoma patients. Expression of GPC3 leads to an increased apoptosis response in human lung carcinoma tumor cells, and is considered to be a candidate lung tumor suppressor gene. Increased serum levels of GPC3 have been demonstrated in ARDS patients with severe pneumonia.ConclusionsGlypican-3 could be considered as a clinically useful biomarker in hepatocellular carcinoma, lung carcinoma, and ARDS, but further research is needed to confirm and expand on these findings.","inCitations":["43ca3e99d71a0e708edc30aae5a67e651802e07a","f945f5c58b418189477076568184d7288da76a1d","0b8dd64e7573b20a7ec5414dbadfb7e900a1f0a2","c946a498c2f513190dd69303f264bb3d2894e461","00c81e0fd44d531ec61d74c3d6f3f547ea3a7e2a"],"pdfUrls":["http://clintransmed.springeropen.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s40169-017-0146-5?site=clintransmed.springeropen.com"],"title":"Can glypican-3 be a disease-specific biomarker?","doi":"10.1186/s40169-017-0146-5","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s40169-017-0146-5","venue":"Clinical and Translational Medicine"}

To have a comprehensive understanding of the seismic behaviors of unbonded prestressed SRC beam members, fifteen frame beam specimens, including thirteen unbonded prestressed SRC ones and two ordinary SRC ones, were designed to make the numerical multi-parameter analysis. The parameters considered were the amount of unbonded tendons, rebar, flange and web thickness of steel shape. In the paper, the load-carrying capacity, strain of steels and concrete, ductility, energy dissipation, deformation restoring capacity, stiffness and strength degradation were detailed analyzed and discussed. The results indicated that increase the amount of unbonded tendons would lower the utilization efficiency of steel and decrease the energy dissipation capacity. Raising the amounts of tendons, rebar or steel shape would reduce the specimen’s ductility and the ductility coefficient had a good linear relationship with the introduced integrate reinforcement index. According to the numerical analysis, several brief design suggestions were provided for reference. Moreover, compared with the ordinary SRC specimens, it could be observed that the energy dissipation capacity of prestressed SRC members was relatively lower, while its deformation capacity was as good as ordinary SRC ones. The application of unbonded tendons in SRC beam members greatly improved its serviceability and deformation restoring capacity.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Detailed numerical research on the performance of unbonded prestressed SRC frame beam under vertical cyclic load","doi":"10.1016/j.engstruct.2018.09.069","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.engstruct.2018.09.069","venue":""}
