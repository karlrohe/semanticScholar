The amides considered are n-methylformamide (NMF), n-methylacetamide (NMA), n-ethylacetamide (NEA), n-methylpropanamide (NMPA), 2-pyrrolidone and caprolactam. The solvents are alkanes, benzene, toluene or 1-alkanols. The DISQUAC interaction parameters are reported. The model describes consistently thermodynamic properties such as vapor–liquid equilibria (VLE), excess molar Gibbs energies, GE, and excess molar enthalpies, HE, solid–liquid equilibria (SLE), or the concentration–concentration structure factor, SCC(0). DISQUAC improves results from other models, such as the extended real associated solution model (ERAS) or UNIFAC. Interactions present in the studied mixtures are discussed. Solutions with alkanes are characterized by strong dipole–dipole interactions between amide molecules. n-Methylformamide+aromatic compound mixtures behave similarly to associated systems. The heterocoordination observed in some solutions involving methanol where interactions between like molecules are almost cancelled by interactions between unlike molecules may partially be ascribed to size effects. For other alcoholic solutions, the ability of the alcohol for the breakage of the amide–amide interactions is prevalent over solvation effects.","inCitations":["8fb6a84f9a6bedf4ccf38323619c4ec9f8914a76","ebd0db80156659d665f0b7537ed22e01ccec186a","7e03f29f269b0e2e31938c73eda190daab8fbb7a"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Thermodynamics of binary mixtures containing N-alkylamides","doi":"10.1016/j.molliq.2004.02.046","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molliq.2004.02.046","venue":""}

We found that autophagic flux was significantly inhibited in 3 murine models of NAFLD. Interestingly, the number of acidic organelles and the level of mature cathepsin D were reduced, suggesting defective lysosome acidification. Asparagine synthetase (ASNS) was induced by endoplasmic reticulum stress, leading to the generation of asparagine, which inhibited lysosome acidification. Both steatotic- and asparagine-treated hepatocytes showed reduced lysosomal acidity and retention of lysosomal calcium. Knockdown of ASNS in steatotic hepatocytes restored autophagic flux. As a potential biomarker, increased serum p62/sequestosome 1 (SQSTM1) level was an independent risk factor for patients with steatosis and lobular inflammation. Impaired autophagy in NAFLD is elicited by defective lysosome acidification, which is caused by ASNS-induced asparagine synthesis under endoplasmic reticulum stress and subsequent retention of lysosomal calcium. p62/SQSTM1 could be used as a noninvasive biomarker in the diagnosis of NAFLD patients.-Wang, X., Zhang, X., Chu, E.

The native tissue was stained for functional markers, while cultured cells were analysed by FACS. PCR was used to determine gene expression in the cultured versus native cells.\n\n\nResults\nThe native stroma was positive for α-actinin, ALDH1A1, CD31, CD34, Collagen I, and Vimentin. Cultured cells expressed CD73, CD90, CD105, CD51, Nestin, CD49a, CD49d, ABCG2, and CD47. PCR demonstrated a significant upregulation of ALDH1A1, AQP1, ITGB4, KLF4, CD31, CD34, and CXCR4 in the native tissue, while the expression of ABCG2, ITGAV, Nestin, CD73, CD90, CD105, and Vimentin were significantly higher in the cultured cells. GPC did not change.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe study finds no significant difference between the phenotype of CSCs generated by the explant or enzymatic digestion technique from the center or periphery of the stroma.

However, most expanded criteria were designed for deceased donor liver transplantation. Living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) differs from that of deceased donor liver transplantation primarily because LDLT liver grafts are not public resources.\n\n\nRECENT FINDINGS\nIn Asian countries, where HCC is endemic, LDLT is the main currently available treatment option for HCC. High-volume LDLT centers throughout Asia have adopted their own expanded selection criteria for LDLT for HCC with acceptable long-term results. Some centers utilize tumor markers as one of the criterion to help select suitable candidates. Indeed, such adjunctive biomarkers may have prognostic relevance for patients with HCC. The use of both biological and histomorphologic parameters may increase the number of transplantable patients.\n\n\nSUMMARY\nThe overall chance of survival, and recipient/donor preferences as well as the risk of recurrence are considered in the LDLT setting. Therefore, the selection criteria for liver transplantation for HCC could benefit from expansion for LDLT.","inCitations":["48165f2e055db2caf212141f3ce1c9905fa33b99","eaaf55ab389e91d044eab7e12e89684c80baa8c9","85e32870d14355c5b012ff408302856f845f8e25","f7cc68981deb08ec68c058132a7f01cca5248448","aec9b10dbd74859eeff256072bf00e082b0b59cd","70882cbcc8569efa2c7c6c9c94e67255c715e256"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Expansion of the criteria for living donor liver transplantation for hepatocellular carcinoma.","doi":"10.1097/MOT.0000000000000294","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1097/MOT.0000000000000294","venue":"Current opinion in organ transplantation"}

SOMs are different from other neural networks in the sense that they use neighborhood function to preserve the topological properties of the input space.

Some have a long history of apparent safe use, while others are less well understood and their use may represent a risk for consumers. Experience has shown that there is a need for a tool for setting priorities within the risk assessment of those microorganisms used in food/feed production referred to EFSA and consequently the subject of a formal assessment of safety. To meet this need a system was proposed for a pre-market safety assessment of selected groups of microorganisms leading to a “Qualified Presumption of Safety (QPS)”. In essence this proposed that a safety assessment of a defined taxonomic group (e.g. genus or group of related species) could be made based on four pillars (establishing identity, body of knowledge, possible pathogenicity and end use). If the taxonomic group did not raise safety concerns or, if safety concerns existed, but could be defined and excluded (the qualification) the grouping could be granted QPS status. Thereafter, any strain of microorganism the identity of which could be unambiguously established and assigned to a QPS group would be freed from the need for further safety assessment other than satisfying any qualifications specified. Microorganisms not considered suitable for QPS would remain subject to a full safety assessment. EFSA asked its Scientific Committee to consider whether this system could be used to harmonise approaches to the safety assessment of microorganisms across the various EFSA scientific panels. If so, the Committee was requested to develop a strategy for the introduction of an assessment system based on the QPS concept.","inCitations":["28cc7102b2cec41f99c9f0f07100e583386b8c38","8e7cd987c25f41ca6e2ca9ff8b7da70800e6caf4","cebdad2745d8f7919d4d2e9fcf89068cd853e118","817515f4e14cc51af9e70baabe4efd8a93fb5d56","78c42f2990d6f31fc758b4b5cb4ddad5628423c3","d17c9e5b409b934e45c3769c11e83ebc64073af6","71b09bcbf09b764dbb22d913191deea37519753c","be0ee152e288b32d16877c37198b61e7b71e9c1e","1ecebe33097ff32b5405582f252271e45e0c3235","93642761b1a4099f8a385058eb6ab4b4bd7acc3d","4aa26c595222fee7194fa9debf101acbc1a67152","3be4de3727026ae20151515761cd157edc365097","ea18b84a2d7a98bfddd4652e41e5a9afe0c0c206","0fae9dacdee53ce2e7fd6144afa776f8f69e9903","5c50195a02955177e3b217a22e59937ea0020db4","ad567c6e82cc8637bc37a0cd169d05fcb8f7ed95","0046e7f779d65e0cd02c70c41508d44317218b62","562e33a142f9131fdc5305fdd0b9a87b4a190781","0efd166ee664abb7c0acee12f2986f91ee954a35","b839bfb77ebe085703d7ae7ca80d9c05060e1268","b7a192800394026631d00df801a1991799ee01ea","35c1eec1fb7a7c53a460f76a3b312a3b9cfddfcd","101cc9d9b81ac4f0fe3018db8c6ad573d16e80dd","9bfaf3c12d92721212a768c4456a49ee97cfe588","6d30a91ea389db727919b93f087b59ff2c571d68","38962ff3734f391a447ea5a4e863696d56573b9b","acb7207107225d346e23409f5536769f3e204300","3ecb2ed20a4b683621dcd05ae1f88baf8215b409","cddef6bc66b45b3f08c9b77d80610d771ac4e8bd","693e61e5de4f16f452d6d30c8843996664e95a63","85989370e03066c1779f098137a7ae8e03449a77","abd471535f96470adb0052365381b3ffed74c034","df260e839a895fb52f918ff74453391668f7b2bf","ecb1f79711458317bef6ea61cfa8e6be42e35304","be639cd7b5885c60d932a0a59fe61604d31c61c0","7cd89f70639c5e68e1bc7e4917d131c9521ba0d0","852052f9c88cd7d2bebe0a5e47ccf30030a8ce8a","3e6c7ebfae03472829ef0c0efaf0e540972b79bd","a86668f0e9e2e3586e60b3d637800882b2b7890e","8d6cf822dc456837a2311aee68b0a81fed3a36ba","6bb2e4e32415f9d72a80379eef9005f44750ca8b","66b8b8f4dcd6663cc14b4ec500ed1e95afbee633","fba8b9c3aa557b7bc06c9d29bda3eda0f64f19bc"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.efsa.europa.eu/sites/default/files/scientific_output/files/main_documents/sc_op_ej587_qps_en,6.pdf","http://www.elika.net/datos/articulos/Archivo_EN267/EFSA_QPS07.pdf"],"title":"Introduction of a Qualified Presumption of Safety (QPS) approach for assessment of selected microorganisms referred to EFSA 1 Opinion of the Scientific Committee","doi":"10.2903/j.efsa.2007.587","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2007.587","venue":""}

Some of these cryptosystems permit secure computations and aim at a wider audience than cryptographic community. We focus on one of them, a leveled homomorphic cryptosystem (LHE): Brakersi/Fan-Vercauteren’s (BFV) one. The family of LHE cryptosystems needs to be well-instantiated not only to protect input and output ciphertexts and to perform efficiently computations, but also, for them, parametrization constrains the quantity of homomorphic computations that can be performed with guarantee of correctness. It demands to choose parameters accordingly. In addition, each implementation brings external constraints to optimize performance. All of this makes it tedious for the non-expert user to choose parameters. To solve this, we have developed CinguParam to help user to instantiate implementations of BFV in different libraries: Cingulata, FV-NFLlib and Microsoft SEAL (release 3. 3). CinguParam permits to generate an up-to-date database of parameter sets in function of computation budget, security parameters and implementation choices. This tool includes a notion of budget to ensure correct homomorphic computations and the one of BKZ reduction cost model to grasp the gap from concrete security, nowadays. It makes use of the LWE-Estimator to obtain up-to-date security estimations. CinguParam permits to select automatically a suitable parameter set with Cingulata and it can be used to generate code snippets to set parameters with FV-NFLlib and Microsoft SEAL (release 3. 3).","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/1402","https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/1402.pdf"],"title":"Automatize parameter tuning in Ring-Learning-With-Errors-based leveled homomorphic cryptosystem implementations","doi":"","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"IACR Cryptology ePrint Archive"}

The goal of the conference was to take a close look at the initiatives that have emerged as a result of the increasing global acceptance of blockchain technology. This technology, chiefly known as the foundation of Bitcoin and originally introduced as a means of securely managing cryptocurrency, has proven to have practical applications beyond finance. The basic technology is that of a distributed ledger and it is being broadly-adopted by multiple industries, including the scholarly publishing community. The capabilities of this new technology are prompting a direct exchange among stakeholders, as blockchain promises a more structured, decentralized, and immutably secure approach that has the potential to significantly impact researcher workflows from data collection to peer review to access and published work. The technology inspires passion there are those who believe that it will ultimately transform our lives while others are completely skeptical.

Although the emission anisotropy phenomenon for an emitting dipole bound to the interface between two media with different refractive index is well known for fluorescence, it is still poorly investigated for CL reactions, in which the excited-state reaction products can diffuse in solution before the photon emission event. In this paper, we propose a simple method for the real-time evaluation of the CL emission anisotropy based on a radial array of optical fibers, embedded in a poly(methyl methacrylate) semicylinder and coupled with a Charge-Coupled Device (CCD) camera through a suitable interface. The polar-time evolutions of the CL emission have been studied for catalyzing enzymes immobilized onto a solid surface (heterogeneous configuration) or free in solution (homogeneous configuration). Evidence of the anisotropy phenomenon is observed, indicating that the lifetime of the excited-state products of the enzyme-catalyzed reactions is shorter than the time required for their diffusion in solution at a distance at which the CL can be considered isotropic. These results open new perspectives in the development of CL-based miniaturized analytical devices.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"In-Parallel Polar Monitoring of Chemiluminescence Emission Anisotropy at the Solid–Liquid Interface by an Optical Fiber Radial Array","doi":"10.3390/chemosensors8010018","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.3390/chemosensors8010018","venue":""}

The characteristics of these powder-type Gd 2 O 2 S:Tb scintillators correlate to some material parameters, including scintillator layer thickness and powder size. Three types of Gd 2 O 2 S:Tb scintillators with different powder particle sizes were prepared, and the effects of the powder size and scintillator layer thickness on the scintillator characteristics were evaluated using a sensitivity indicator (SI) and a beam purity indicator (BPI). The intensity of scintillation increased as the particle size increased. In addition, the intensity of scintillation detected saturated at a specific thickness for each scintillator particle size. This saturation was considered to be caused by differences in the packing rate of the powder near the substrate and the flight paths of thermal neutrons and internal conversion electrons in the scintillator. Additionally, the image quality worsened with increasing scintillator layer thickness. On the basis of our investigation, we determined the optimum powder particle size and layer thickness of the Gd 2 O 2 S:Tb scintillator for neutron imaging.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Influence of powder particle size and scintillator layer thickness on the performance of Gd2O2S:Tb scintillators for neutron imaging","doi":"10.1016/j.nima.2012.03.035","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nima.2012.03.035","venue":""}

В цьому випадку застосування біологічних методів є об’єктивною умовою для використання фотосинтетичних властивостей  мікроводоростей. Використання мікроводоростей в процесах очищення промислових газових викидів  має суттєві переваги завдяки здатності поглинати в десятки разів більшу кількість вуглекислого газу в порівнянні з наземними рослинами та здатності адаптуватися до несприятливих умовах: низькі температури середовища та освітленість, лужно-кислотний баланс, вплив інгібіторів і т. д. За рахунок дослідження цих факторів можна отримати більш глибоке розуміння біологічних методів знешкодження забрудників, та процесів що відбуваються у досліджуваних  об’єктах.У продуктах спалювання палива завжди міститься велика кількість оксидів, найбільш небезпечними є діоксид сульфуру та оксиди азоту. Тому вивчення впливу їх на процес фотосинтезу хлорофіл синтезуючими мікроводоростями є важливим. Результати експериментальних досліджень процесу поглинання вуглекислого газу із промислових газових викидів хлорофілсинтезуючими мікроводоростями типу Chlorella засвідчують про вплив діоксиду сульфуру та оксидів азоту на динаміку поглинання.

The content of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has been the subject of discussion at the political level of the states of the world, whose leaders are looking for ways to reduce harmful emissions to the atmosphere from year to year. In this case, the use of biological methods are objective conditions for the use photosynthetic properties of microalgae. The use of microalgae in the process of purifying industrial gas emissions has significant advantages due to the ability to absorb dozens of times more carbon dioxide than terrestrial plants and adapt to adverse conditions: low temperatures and illumination, alkaline-acid balance, the effect of inhibitors, etc.  Through the study of these factors can gain a deeper understanding of biological methods of neutralizing pollutants  and the processes occurring  in the investigated objects.The products of combustion of fuel always contain a large number of oxides, the most dangerous are sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides. Therefore, the study of their influence on the process of photosynthesis by chlorophyllsynthesizing microalgae is important.  The results of experimental studies on the process of carbon dioxide absorption from industrial gas emissions by chlorophyllsynthesizing Chlorella microalgae demonstrate the influence of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides on the absorption dynamics. The phenomenon of sulfur dioxide inhibition and activation by nitrogen oxides of the process of photosynthesis is established.  Reverse noncompetitive inhibition of the microalgae cell-enzyme-substrate complex with dioxin sulfur was proved in accordance with the Linouiver-Burke theory and the activation by nitrogen oxides is proved. The permissible values of the inhibitor concentrations in the process of carbon dioxide absorption by chlorophyllsyntheszing microalgae is established. The instability constant of the enzyme complex and the enzyme substrate complex with the inhibitor is determined. The value of optimal concentration of nitrogen  dioxide as an  activator of the growth of the Chlorella  microalgae is established.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Інгібітори Та Активатори Процесу Поглинання Вуглекислого Газу Хлорофілсинтезуючими Мікроводоростями","doi":"10.15673/swonaft.v82i1.1010","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.15673/swonaft.v82i1.1010","venue":""}

In contrast, normal levels of cytotoxicity were found in the second group of patients off of all chemotherapy. One patient studied while on chemotherapy and on two occasions following discontinuation of maintenance medications demonstrated that while NK and K-cell activity was depressed during therapy, normal activity returned within days when immunosuppressive therapy was stopped. Thus, present modes of chemotherapy clearly had a profound effect on the in vitro NK and K-cell activity; however, no long-term effect on these functions was noted in our studies.","inCitations":["21db8ba8cac8f1914fffdfb5f27b6c0105675179","548e421ade2cebcd8aa4eaf4b662e30bc69a0c33","ff14fad73249ca9db5b137147cf9ebd2b866a445","6597f17a26e31214776b2a48f4b189382a732fff","210b1b99a5fa4a5c3e4584b059870b60ec83ceae","d43678ac9350f3e40b260ec15960ca1725ef94cb"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Immunologic evaluation of long-term effects of childhood ALL chemotherapy: analysis of in vitro NK- and K-cell activities of peripheral blood lymphocytes.","doi":"10.1002/ajh.2830120104","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1002/ajh.2830120104","venue":"American journal of hematology"}

Recently the research group has proposed the use of biomolecular unit cells consisting of encapsulated droplets with a lipid bilayer formed at their interfaces, stabilized between the two aqueous compartments. This allows for the rapid study and assessment of the characteristics of the individual unit cell, the insertion of various transport proteins and peptides that shape the response of the unit cell, and the construction of complex networks of these biomolecular systems. The goal of this work is to develop and study methods for constructing energy relevant devices through these biomolecular networks. These networks are highly tailorable, and allow the researcher to alter the embedded proteins/peptides in the lipid bilayer, the bilayer dimensions through the application of compressive forces, and the salt concentrations in the droplets. This allows for a high degree of control over their attributes and outputs. These systems also exhibit collective properties through large networks of the unit cells, allowing for complex sensing and actuation behavior not exhibited by single cells. This paper provides an overview of the development of a model for predicting the performance and output of these energy relevant biomolecular networks as well as preliminary experimental results that demonstrate some of the concepts in action.","inCitations":["c72e7454f9d1ed79b33ab01f423467c21bef7905"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Using cellular energy conversion and storage mechanics for bio-inspired energy harvesting","doi":"10.1117/12.2010700","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1117/12.2010700","venue":"Smart Structures"}

All patients were followed until death.\n\n\nMEASUREMENTS\nThe final phase of dementia was defined as total impairment on 20 items of a functional status questionnaire. Immediate causes of death (part 1a of the Dutch death certificate) were classified by the International Classification of Health Problems in Primary Care.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe three most important reported immediate causes of death were cachexia/dehydration (35.2%), cardio-vascular disorders (20.9%) and acute pulmonary diseases (20.1%), mainly pneumonia. Cachexia/dehydration was particularly common as a cause of death of patients who survived to the final phase (53.2%); survival to the final phase of dementia was an independent predictor of cachexia/dehydration as an immediate cause of death with reference to cardiovascular disorders in multinomial regression adjusted for age at death, gender, and type of dementia.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nPatients who survive to the final phase of dementia are more likely to die from cachexia or dehydration than those who die before. The findings contribute to a debate on what should be reported as the immediate cause of death in dementia including perspectives from a palliative care viewpoint.","inCitations":["fa867226512566dbf7998331bdd4c3f769c7e615","2c289ebc075ada0d0efaff590dfb36da8126f1ec","5aaa679bf1767b5cfe79173556af4d959c451628","270831f200729f9e8e2422d621e2730cc2fe15eb","5d72bd207aed8a2a908cc080222dac0fb929c504","7d0735958a775193792f4b12a9052b615b5cc17b","33f7b6f5204edc59ea14d58fba994facfe87afba","37ca29e8b436d2e2b4d404a45a11a4b58c0be00a","be94ae09e3ba796b1b98b76747f610ac826d69ef","61a7724f6442547fcf5f702bfde3b22edf0c182b","3cea748d7a1de4439ad7fc69d5f1ce91ca323891","bbe25348ccc42bd01974fb79dad5e48fc5358966","47894b6b7028d5bd1dda5d9d09ac2d2d3c93984f","09ea34616399b996412f99f0786c93e6d10994d6","a48a723569a65b0f68f55282d5940ec0405140ae","9aca0ce221c6ca8091518f5aaf7e5574eb6e77c1","9e7623f2c6de40bb80e89a04c01842793c89117d","28bb9519f1aaa007732c099079d208ae3235f739","ae80700bc3f3701218fdc8eff74c07331e2b8ff7","570524d7cd7f7f9aaad727563042ab338c730e54","3d981188b940f048a96c582f8167841b462e97ca","cb6b5868b91d55e3a8ead87de2550b149a578c51","5f2b3126e34e16f43caee1ebfb507de6336ad3e5","1bee8bdd7830c9458cba34056d0cfcb129fcf697","3ca2c02fa96656e9f9f01d0a9c2e08d472145631","f73ce8c9f7ce025e87cde803197a34d9081c901b","d520fa1f1fb834eaf8f188942cf96230cfc82129"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"The 'natural' endpoint of dementia: death from cachexia or dehydration following palliative care?","doi":"10.1002/gps.1680","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1002/gps.1680","venue":"International journal of geriatric psychiatry"}

Nevertheless, the etiology of hypereosinophilia remains obscure in some cases. Among these unexplained situations, the rare idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome requires special attention because of its fatal course due to cardiac involvement which can remain clinically silent for a long period of time.

Fouling was sampled on rafted items (set adrift by the Tohoku tsunami that struck northeastern Honshu in March 2011) landing in North America and the Hawaiian Islands. Seventeen species of shallow-water benthic foraminifera were recovered from these debris objects. Eleven species are regarded as having been acquired in Japan, while two additional species (Planogypsina squamiformis (Chapman, 1901) and Homotrema rubra (Lamarck, 1816)) were obtained in the Indo-Pacific as those objects drifted into shallow tropical waters before turning north and east to North America. Four species were acquired after the debris came ashore in Hawaii and in North America. As previously shown for the Japanese species Trochammina hadai Uchio, 1962 and the Indo-Pacific species Amphistegina lobifera Larsen, 1976, introduced foraminiferal species may rapidly proliferate and disperse, negatively impacting native species. In the geologic past, panoceanic rafting must have been relatively infrequent, as it would have floating pumice and vegetation with relatively limited potential for multiyear survival at sea. In modern times, the ever-increasing abundance of floatable plastic artifacts emplaced along tectonic coastlines provides a greater abundance of more permanent materials for tsunamiand storm-generated rafts that can introduce foraminifera and other marine biota to distant shorelines.","inCitations":["4e54305913847f9fbdac1a81a7ab998361ba3754"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.aquaticinvasions.net/2018/AI_2018_JTMD_Finger.pdf"],"title":"Tsunami-generated rafting of foraminifera across the North Pacific Ocean","doi":"10.3391/ai.2018.13.1.03","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.3391/ai.2018.13.1.03","venue":""}

Effective mouse MRI studies require attention to many aspects of experiment design. In this chapter, we provide details and discussion of important practical considerations: hardware requirements, mouse handling for in vivo imaging, specimen preparation for ex vivo imaging, sequence and contrast agent selection, study size, and quantitative image analysis. We focus particularly on anatomical phenotyping, an important and accessible application that has shown a high potential for impact in many mouse models at our imaging center.","inCitations":["eaef4c4b426c71f84912f66e5a2bbb52e83730b1","02f1f14204d75c814a2580826514d8411c0dd563","d4d88b1f4893ca2fb3fec939efb39f6f3391aea6"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Mouse phenotyping with MRI.","doi":"10.1007/978-1-61779-219-9_31","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-61779-219-9_31","venue":"Methods in molecular biology"}

This phenomenon may cause difficulty in clinical or pathologic diagnosis. The cases reported in the literature as complete spontaneous regression of primary malignant melanomas have been diagnosed only in retrospect, after the patient presented with metastatic malignant melanoma. Two cases of malignant melanoma with partial regression are reported. In these cases the areas of complete regression cannot be recognized as malignant melanoma. The definitive diagnosis of malignant melanoma can be made only in the areas with at least two of three characteristic features of melanoma, (1) melanocytic cells with atypical nuclei and prominent nucleoli, (2) mitoses in melanocytic cells, and (3) invasion of the epidermis by atypical melanocytic cells. Clinical features suggesting regressing malignant melanoma include changes in color, especially areas of depigmentation, variations in color in different areas of a pigmented mole, and decrease in size of a mole. Histopathologic features of regression include loss of melanin pigment from the epidermis, melanophages in the dermis, telangiectasia of capillaries in the dermis, and lymphocytic infiltration in the dermis in a band-like or perivascular pattern. These histologic findings may also be found in inflammatory lesions such as lichen planus and in regressing benign melanocytic nevi.","inCitations":["82f620b46222f8b702633bf75a9ad90b17b51b72"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Regressing malignant melanoma.","doi":"","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"The Journal of the Louisiana State Medical Society : official organ of the Louisiana State Medical Society"}

TLR9, a sensor of endosomal dsDNA, both promotes and regulates systemic autoimmunity in vivo, but the precise nature of its apparently contradictory roles in autoimmunity remained unclear. In this study, using the 3H9 anti-DNA BCR transgene in the autoimmune-prone MRL.Fas lpr mouse model of systemic lupus erythematosus, we identify the stages at which TLR9 contributes to establishing and breaking B cell tolerance. Although TLR9 is dispensable for L chain editing during B cell development in the bone marrow, TLR9 limits anti-DNA B cell life span in the periphery and is thus tolerogenic. In the absence of TLR9, anti-DNA B cells have much longer life spans and accumulate in the follicle, neither activated nor deleted. These cells retain some characteristics of anergic cells, in that they have elevated basal BCR signaling but impaired induced responses and downregulate their cell-surface BCR expression. In contrast, whereas TLR9-intact anergic B cells accumulate near the T/B border, TLR9-deficient anti-DNA B cells are somewhat more dispersed throughout the follicle. Nonetheless, in older autoimmune-prone animals, TLR9 expression specifically within the B cell compartment is required for spontaneous peripheral activation of anti-DNA B cells and their differentiation into Ab-forming cells via an extrafollicular pathway. Thus, TLR9 has paradoxical roles in regulating anti-DNA B cells: it helps purge the peripheral repertoire of autoreactive cells, yet is also required for their activation. A utoreactive BCRs arise as a result of V(D)J recombi-nation. As many as 55–75% of developing B cells display BCRs with measurable affinity for self-epitopes (1). Several self-tolerance mechanisms efficiently eliminate the majority of self-reactive BCR specificities before or shortly after entry into the mature B cell repertoire. These include editing of autoreactive BCRs through additional rounds of recombination at the L chain loci, deletion of autoreactive B cells, or the acquisition of a functionally unresponsive phenotype termed anergy (2, 3). Recently, we and others have shown that TLR9, an endosomal innate immune sensor of dsDNA (4), is required for formation of spontaneous anti-DNA autoantibodies in several in vivo mouse models of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) (5–10). These findings are consistent with a model in which autoreactive B cells in SLE break tolerance due to the unique ability of nucleic acid– containing self-Ags to coengage the BCR and one or more innate immune sensors of nucleic …","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://www.jimmunol.org/content/jimmunol/190/4/1447.full.pdf?with-ds=yes","http://www.jimmunol.org/content/jimmunol/190/4/1447.full.pdf"],"title":"Required for Their Activation Survival of Anergic Anti-DNA B Cells , Yet Is TLR 9 Promotes Tolerance by Restricting Shlomchik","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

The incidence, timing, and clinical course of HCV positive hepatitis in liver transplant recipients are unknown. Three hundred and seventeen donor-recipient liver transplant pairs were grouped on the basis of their pretransplant HCV antibody status. The biopsy findings were examined. Four distinct groups were identified on the basis of HCV serology: group I, both were negative; group II, donor was negative and recipient was positive; group III, donor was positive and recipient was negative; group IV, both were positive. The prevalence of anti-HCV positivity in recipients was 13.6%. The rate of seroconversion was 9.2%. Histologic hepatitis not ascribable to any specific cause other than non-A, non-B (NANB) hepatitis occurred in 13.8%. The incidence of histologic chronic active hepatitis was 1.6%, and none progressed to cirrhosis. The concordance rate for a positive anti-HCV serology and NANB hepatitis was 2.8%. Of the 35 patients (group II and IV) with positive anti-HCV serology pretransplant, only 17 were positive posttransplantation. Based on these data it can be concluded that posttransplant NANB hepatitis occurred in 13.8% of liver recipients. Twenty percent of these were anti-HCV positive. Progression to histologic chronic active hepatitis occurs over a period of 1-5 years in 1.6% of cases.","inCitations":["b12b5b71ce2a2fdea2364343919ac0182abe935e","32c8db250ecbe1ee147f43f3b549696bc097fd32","5b5223ee25b6acc278851ad0314840f7d84ae08c","0e0f0acfa855244ade14414e950d4b67a24e888f","fca0ef89c69896f3c1a4b24e04bf71f3a62b7be0","57531713a88e11202e7dcf94f55e340f7ab8c064","a7628d8844fd369d4abdcb4ca8181e708f23c244","a3220c28d01afa8db1ac1e6dbdce1745f2936b9a","5c7e46fed78484eadaf6d495a6cfabee298e2025","7876943c859ad21b609c8f62a9abe06b3cd74b1d","5686fe08f3cb07d560d949353303a87628e125b0","b165f95207b6787790ab48bbfdffce6694f0f8e0","2aecb03aa3fd751a5ce8f3b394d7e195fb953f72","f3d2d53a9c7955d67dafbb8b76f1957907394b97","a6154e06cd3b3fc695805cf17c95a1f00ef4d03d","b562766c5ada106f81903e1b1d5ad0948c2d4489","fd335c8426be929e06559a1329b1997577894ffc","1ae0d3f05a09514342ff1c3de17bb3c407cdb838","898a6e1983c8cf58a9fd3e573838494fa8ae298e","7f347a5c3f19b595bd8f81fc8e9c2ace434773b9","ba0a4ae54e780c8398e29362f0b64d50b85106ed","c31a20beccb4cfe9b4216e24878811eb4d45ceaf","7de9e08395a69d132dcb82c5f3a080a7074bf47d","0858d4c82cb2105c502a91d8105862acc62d85ef"],"pdfUrls":["http://d-scholarship.pitt.edu/4763/1/31735062111657.pdf"],"title":"Incidence, prevalence, and clinical course of hepatitis C following liver transplantation.","doi":"10.1016/0016-5085(92)91130-V","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/0016-5085%2892%2991130-V","venue":"Gastroenterology"}

One group of investigators believe that this material is true creatinine—others deny that creatinine exists in normal blood. Because of the non-specific methods employed for the identification of creatinine, and the very minute quantities of the chromogenic material available in normal blood, it has been difficult for either group to present convincing evidence. To obtain a definitive answer regarding the nature of the Jaffe-reactive material in blood, and also to develop a specific method for the analysis of creatinine in biological fluids, an attempt was made to obtain a specific enzyme for creatinine. By means of a technique similar to that described by Dubos and Avery 1 and Dubos 2 it has been possible to isolate 4 different species of soil bacteria with a high degree of adaptability toward a substrate of creatinine. One strain (NC) has been found to grow with unusual ease in a medium of pure creatinine and inorganic salts. When tested under conditions which do not allow cellular multiplication, the bacterial suspension still decomposes creatinine very readily. The enzyme seems to be intimately associated with cellular structure and so far has not been released into solution without destroying its activity. However, when the cells of another bacterial species (HR) are disrupted, the creatinine decomposing enzyme is readily obtained in aqueous solution. At present, the potency of this soluble preparation is low compared with a cell suspension of the NC organisms. The present crude enzyme preparation (NC) will decompose its own weight of creatinine in 15 minutes at 37° C. and pH 7.0.","inCitations":["3710a769f03b3d65a2db0e1eba88bac099cad6e8","2a933dc4f45cabf1fe570b2cd2c96539a333da66","cece531bfcd3139003187d72aa6820d6f93210c5","19e20d8b3e07d3de70b25bb58f69f575f94aaf0d","3e43bb6e3dbf04d95fafbd03a8b2fe376589b004"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Enzyme for Decomposition of Creatinine and its Action on the “Apparent Creatinine” of Blood","doi":"10.3181/00379727-35-8963P","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.3181/00379727-35-8963P","venue":""}

The Bronsted-type plot for the reactions of 7a–7i with quinuclidine is linear with β lg = −0.80. The Yukawa-Tsuno plot exhibits an excellent linear correlation with ρY = 2.37 and r = 0.52, indicating that a negative charge develops partially on the O atom of the leaving group in the rate-determining transition state (TS). The Bronsted-type plot for the reactions of 2-chloro-4-nitrophenyl picolinate (7a) with a series of quinuclidines is also linear with β nuc = 0.83. Thus, it was concluded that the reactions proceed through a stepwise mechanism, in which expulsion of the leaving group occurs in the rate-determining step. Comparison of the current kinetic data with those reported previously for the corresponding reactions with piperidine revealed that quinuclidine is ca. 102-fold less reactive than piperidine. This is in contrast to the reports that quinuclidines are more reactive than isobasic secondary amines toward diaryl carbonates and related esters. Effects of amine nature on reactivity and TS structures are discussed.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Kinetic and Mechanistic Studies on Quinuclidinolysis of Y‐substituted‐Phenyl Picolinates: Effect of Amine Nature on Reactivity and Transition‐State Structure","doi":"10.1002/bkcs.10272","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1002/bkcs.10272","venue":""}

We find that the restricted LPPL model well describes the times before the downturns. The out of sample predictions of the timing of the downturns lie within a narrow time span.

We trained carrion crows to remember visual items for three alternating delay durations in a delayed match-to-sample task and recorded single-unit activity from the NCL. Sample-selective delay activity, a correlate of visual working memory, was maintained throughout different working memory durations. Delay responses remained selective for the same preferred sample item across blocks with different delay durations. However, selectivity strength decreased with increasing delay durations, mirroring worsened behavioral performance with longer memory delays. Behavioral relevance of delay activity was further evidenced by reduced encoding of the preferred sample item during error trials. In addition, NCL neurons adapted their time-dependent discharges to blocks of different memory durations, so that delay duration could be successfully classified based on population activity a few trials after the delay duration switched. Therefore, NCL neurons not only maintain information from individual trials, but also keep track of the duration for which this information is needed in the context of the task. These results strengthen the role of corvid NCL in maintaining working memory for flexible control of temporally extended goal-directed behavior.","inCitations":["d07b4dc9edf7a308a5c91c63a350111e5826dbd5"],"pdfUrls":["https://homepages.uni-tuebingen.de/andreas.nieder/Hartmann,%20Veit,%20Nieder%20(2018)%20EBR.pdf"],"title":"Neurons in the crow nidopallium caudolaterale encode varying durations of visual working memory periods","doi":"10.1007/s00221-017-5120-3","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00221-017-5120-3","venue":"Experimental Brain Research"}

In this study, we employed limiting dilution analysis to determine the frequency of CTL precursors (CTL-P) reactive against both the specific DBA/2 (or P815) target and the syngeneic tumor YC8. The mean frequency of anti-DBA/2 CTL-P in PEC from BALB/c mice immunized with DBA/2 was 1/302. Between one-third and one-fifth of limiting dilution microcultures that exhibited lytic activity against DBA/2 lymphoblasts (or P815) were also able to lyse YC8. No lysis of YC8 was observed in the absence of a parallel lysis on DBA/2 lymphoblasts or P815 target cells. T cell clones, derived by micromanipulation from microcultures selected for cytotoxic activity against YC8 and/or P815, maintained either the specific anti-allogeneic or the doubly reactive ( antiallogeneic plus anti-syngeneic tumor) phenotype. Fourteen clones (six specific and eight doubly reactive) were tested for cytotoxic activity on a panel of target cells with different haplotypes. All showed H-2-restricted specificity for minor histocompatibility antigens shared by DBA/2 and B10.D2. The restriction element for some of the clones mapped in the K region of the H-2 complex, whereas for other clones the restriction element mapped in the D region; both K- and D-restricted clones were able to lyse YC8. When the clones that exhibited lysis on YC8 were tested on two other BALB/c tumor targets, LSTRA, a Moloney virus induced lymphoma, and RL male-1, a radiation induced lymphoma, two of seven were found to lyse all three syngeneic tumor targets equally well, but not syngeneic BALB/c blasts. These clones were functionally categorized as conventional CTL because they were unable to proliferate when cultured with antigen in the absence of exogenous lymphokines, and were unable to produce lymphokine with IL 2 activity when stimulated by the appropriate splenocytes. When tested in vivo in a Winn assay, a strong anti-tumor activity against YC8 was exerted by the anti-DBA/2 clones DY4 -3 and DY16 -3. These clones lysed both YC8 and the immunizing target cells in vitro. No in vivo effect in neutralizing YC8 tumor growth was observed with clone D2-1, a clone that lysed DBA/2 targets but not YC8 in vitro.","inCitations":["7c3452d91aad06938bea5fa764f66839d1c2e491","48308262b8236305fa82209a53227f14e9b04062","e5f411d3631eb99eeb22f8a83fe66cc47b0d614f","3246a448fd88b5efe45200cda9daea2ef6da81d7","555edb0d409c803a03a27c4847d07664b8c8a06c","34a9797e63d41b63b2be30b4bcecc7d6891e8304","ac5e942238c4243f75be0d639e455d5059f62802","b8bedc06710e6f2c4fd1530d87a6aef0279bf240"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Alloantigen-induced cytotoxicity against syngeneic tumor cells: analysis at the clonal level.","doi":"","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"","venue":"Journal of immunology"}

The study involved Indiana manufacturing firms that had experience with one or more production philosophies. A questionnaire was constructed seeking both demographic as well as specific production information. The survey was sent to 1500 manufacturing firms and the usable response rate was approximately 33%. Extrapolation of information of the survey allowed for the formation of usable statistical information in table form. Factor analytic models were created and used as predictive models to determine group associations. Introduction For the past decade, companies throughout the world have been trying to develop new techniques to stay competitive. Many top level managers have realized that in today's ultra competitive market companies cannot compete on price alone. They have to pay more attention to production quality and excellent service. Quality management revolution in manufacturing firms has been cited as another industrial revolution (Feigenbaum, 1990). Besides the manufacture firms which always associated with something physical, the service sector business, which including something subject, also need to enhance their service quality(Shetty 1985). To achieve competitiveness, most manufacturing firms have turned to the implementation of various production philosophies. In an attempt to 'fight off increased competition, firms have put product quality and production speed before all other attributes. There have been a number of studies done in the past for the purpose of analyzing how firms are implementing various production philosophies. Past studies fall into a few 'narrow\" ranges such as: descriptive studies involving one or two production philosophies (such as Co 1991, Forrester 1990), empirical studies also involving couple of production techniques (such as Swink 1995, Lockamy 1993, Seaver 1989 ,Hon-Shiang 1987). Furthermore, most studies had as their sample only large scale manufacturers. The existing literature concerning specific production philosophies varies from descriptive in nature to in-depth empirical analysis. The vast majority of available literature deals with the better-known production philosophies (JCT, TIM, Concurrent Engineering and Process Re-engineering). Meanwhile, only a few of studies pay attention on the lesser known Time-based Competition (Blackburn 1991) and Fast Decision Process (D'Abadie 1992). Time-based competition has caused remarkable changes on the factory floor. Many U.S. firms recognize that in today's markets, the speed of response to customer demands is a key competitive advantage. These firms have worked assiduously to diminish their manufacturing cycle times. Speed on the factory floor is not enough. Customers are unimpressed by short manufacturing cycles if the other parts of the delivery chain make response time slow. Time consumed anywhere in the \"value delivery\" chain from order entry and specification on through to distribution and delivery is equally valuable (Blackburn 1992). The concept of time as a competitive element is continually becoming more important and is attracting more attention. As stated, very little has been written about operations which could be described as small by the definition of SBA, Small Business Administration (Steel 2001). Literature on small businesses highlights the differences between them and large firms in terms of managerial, operational and organizational competencies. On the one hand, small firms are believed to have an edge over large firms in flexibility, innovation, and overhead costs, while on the other, they are limited by lack of market power, capital, and managerial resources (Sironopolis 1994, Sonfeld 1984), and operational policies. There is a critical need to understand the activities of small firms as more outsourcing takes place (Ahire 1996). …","inCitations":["652dfd182fd92be4d3b37e1781551a74b6a915b0","1f0fa507aea600a10881c28baab83be4d43fdf33","7ec9fbbc680134918f54a3c7c7b95951ef1db538","f8d975916cb9ae08459b09b4212d653a3bb55117","dfe7902173fea7a79dfa27a43982233e1218e9b7"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"The Experience of Manufacturing Firms with the Implementation of Different Production Philosophies: A United States Survey","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}
