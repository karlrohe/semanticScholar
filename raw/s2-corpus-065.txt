The moons of the giant planets, especially the larger moons, can be thought of as terrestrial bodies, albeit exotic ones. The terrestrial bodies are close enough in bulk physical and chemical parameters to make meaningful comparisons between them. On the other hand, they are different enough so that each one has evolved a unique geological record. Planetary geology is devoted to deciphering those records and using the information in a comparative sense to better understand the physical and chemical processes that are related to the origin and evolution of planetary interiors and surfaces.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Geologic Overview of the Terrestrial Planets","doi":"10.1007/978-94-009-7810-2_30","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-94-009-7810-2_30","venue":""}

This decouples the pitching and CoMdynamics and therefore allows for simple control schemes. However, by creating an offset between the CoM and the hip, and herewith introducing coupling between the pitching and CoMdynamics, the performance of the running robot might possibly increase. In this simulation study, we calculated the optimal CoMlocation for a running robot with hip actuation. We measured the performance of the system as the largest step-down and push that can be corrected in one or two steps. We found that the largest step-down can be corrected in one step when the CoM is located above the hip. The largest push on the other hand can be corrected when the CoM is located under the hip. For two-steps recovery strategies, placing the CoM exactly on the hip is the worst option out of all possible CoM-locations. In this case, the corresponding disturbance rejection is approximately a factor 10 worse than for the optimal CoM-location. Therefore, we conclude that placing the CoM of the torso on the hip is far from optimal.","inCitations":["c7821138b9b3167fd043a47c691ff2a6678964e5"],"pdfUrls":["https://repository.tudelft.nl/islandora/object/uuid:18d78798-2b9c-4356-923f-e088f1b21779/datastream/OBJ/download","http://repository.tudelft.nl/assets/uuid:18d78798-2b9c-4356-923f-e088f1b21779/Thesis_TimvanOijen_final.pdf"],"title":"Running with the center of mass on the hip is far from optimal","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Polyimides, on the other hand, are widely used for applications that require high degrees of flexibility and thermal resistance. Here, we have focused on the preparation of epoxy systems cured with polyamic acids instead of traditional amino-group-containing hardening agents. The cure behavior and potential reaction mechanisms of EPON 828 resin and polyamic acid mixtures were evaluated by DSC and TGA. Thermal analysis showed a complex reaction sequence taking place in the mixture and also determined the extent of reaction of the polyamic acid with itself and the competitive reaction of the polyamic acid with the epoxy. The compositions of the mixtures were varied to see the dependence of the cure behavior on component concentrations. Solutions of the two components did not phase separate and also phase separation was not apparent either optically or microscopically in the cured samples. This phase behavior was attributed to a unique in situ reaction. A novel solvent system for the polyamic acid precursor was also used.","inCitations":["5036bb5e1ef0f1b2aef82691f1e798be55635aa6","1ad1bf3a6a237f4670f8e878ceadc936a9ce6f87","c3c7a2fbddd34d7743bfd7e852c4b5966cffa41a","966d1747c1f9025654b530181ba22df547d63542","708c4c65793d6beaca92a5948eba4eede312faaa"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Preparation of polyimide-epoxy composites","doi":"10.1016/1381-5148(95)00132-8","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/1381-5148%2895%2900132-8","venue":""}

This research aims to screen IEMs in Chinese patients and to explore the cause of neural tube defects (NTDs), a congenital malformation very common in North China.\n\n\nDESIGN AND METHODS\nUrine samples from 618 patients at high risk of IEMs in China were collected, and UP-GC-MS was performed in the selective screening. Urinary methylmalonate (MMA) levels in pregnancy with and without NTDs fetus, respectively, at Luliang district, a countryside region with NTDs incidence 227/10,000, Shanxi Province, North China, were analyzed by GC-MS-selective ion monitoring, and compared with that from control region.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAmong the 618 patients, 22 kinds and 59 cases of IEM were found. Methylmalonic aciduria (MMAuria) is on top of the list, followed by neonatal intrahepatic cholestasis caused by citrin deficiency (NICCD), phenylketonuria (PKU), multiple carboxylase deficiency (MCD), etc. Satisfactory therapeutic effects have been achieved in patients such as NICCD, MCD, and galactosemia. At Luliang district, urinary MMA levels in pregnancy, no matter NTDs-affected or unaffected, are both significantly (P<0.01) higher than that in normal control, while serum B(12) levels in NTDs-affected pregnancy are significantly lower than that both in NTDs-unaffected group (P<0.01) and in normal control (P<0.01). Furthermore, B(12) <52.5 pmol/L is associated with a 7.78-fold increased NTDs risk (P<0.01) at Luliang district.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nSelective screening for IEMs by UP-GC-MS provides valuable evidences for the diagnosis of IEMs. MMAuria secondary to B(12) deficiency is quite common at Luliang district, suggesting B(12) deficiency is involved in the development of NTDs in the specific population. This metabolome research by UP-GC-MS provides valuable epidemiological information that helps to understand the prevalence and the possible intervention strategy of NTDs and IEMs, especially in Chinese population.","inCitations":["383f647eac6aabf184a154dbf88cf4ad854249b3","16abea833b61f678a0dea15465a6ae824020afef","7ce72b0344910d09e97de989afa9589821f50bdf","e7fb9cdcd620b92986ea781eb1fa7ff92fb17ddd","8fdb2ac3131dcd6f677b95df8df548e7c447b0a9","80a7c63e4b3f332285ecfdd47c2ff38bbd5598bc","9712a4d66e463233b495c45980d37eb3ee480e91","d61e2842524aaf1bed942e30bfacd55559fd3d1b","b7dd7236bada0a42787d2a889f9537f2b5c51e8d","49aefe77f85d6a5bceede557c7bd4159babecfc6","da528a49fb46be0de3f868571174c2b8b7af6ea7","0597e1d083fa8570cfd99d706f8eca54e103371d","d1587e3f9cf74ec336905a142bfecb4a074b2531","6699e9e45d053966a832f7c9d529d20c4f19ed4b","674027d678829a54132106ce362bf6664468b913"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Selective screening for inborn errors of metabolism and secondary methylmalonic aciduria in pregnancy at high risk district of neural tube defects: a human metabolome study by GC-MS in China.","doi":"10.1016/j.clinbiochem.2008.01.025","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clinbiochem.2008.01.025","venue":"Clinical biochemistry"}

Educational institutions should be equipped to provide this new basic training for modern life. Accordingly, computer labs are an essential medium for education in almost any ﬁeld. Computer labs are one of the most popular IT infrastructures for technical training in primary and secondary schools, universities and other educational institutions all over the world. Unfortunately, a computer lab is expensive, in terms of both initial purchase and annual maintenance costs, and especially when we want to run the latest software. Hence, research efforts addressing computer lab efﬁciency, performance or cost reduction would have a worldwide repercussion. In response to this concern, this paper presents a survey on thin client technology for computer labs in educational environments. Besides setting out the advantages and drawbacks of this technology, we aim to refute false prejudices against thin clients, identifying a set of educational scenarios where thin clients are a better choice and others requiring traditional solutions.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"A Discussion of Thin Client Technology for Computer Labs","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

The main elements of the program are: further development of the ECR-source, improvement of the transmission into and through the cyclotron, and protection of equipment against excessive beam loss. Further improvement of the ECR ion source is facilitated by the installation of a second source. Redesign of the Low Energy Beam-line, to compensate for aberrations, is in progress; simulations predict a significant increase in transmission. A new, cooled, electrostatic extractor is being commissioned and the beam loss control system has been completed. The main remaining issue is vacuum degradation induced by beam loss caused by charge exchange on the residual gas. Tracking calculations of the distribution of the beam losses over the vacuum chamber to determine the optimum location of scrapers are underway. A gold coating was recently applied to relevant parts of the vacuum chamber aiming at reduction of beam loss induced desorption.","inCitations":["62fed77b3aae6253c1cef486f2fb9c7a046fc64f"],"pdfUrls":["http://accelconf.web.cern.ch/accelconf/Cyclotrons2010/papers/mom2cco03.pdf","http://epaper.kek.jp/Cyclotrons2010/talks/mom2cco03_talk.pdf"],"title":"Progress towards High Intensity Heavy Ion Beams at the Agor-facility*","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

To arrive at an assessment of whole-plant response, experiments were conducted in the greenhouse to study the effect of PGR applications on root and shoot growth of spring cereals. Ethephon, chlormequat chloride (CCC), and trinexapac-ethyl were applied during early growth stages to barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), oat (A vena sativa L.), and wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cultivars grown either in sand mixture or in clay illitic topsoil. The effects on root and shoot growth (mg plant -1 ), root/shoot ratio, tiller number, and weight per main shoot were studied in all cereal species. The response of CO 2 exchange rate (CER) (μmol CO 2 m -2 s -1 ) and formation of yield potential to PGR treatment were studied more closely in Mahti wheat. The effect of CCC application on root area (cm 2 ), length (cm), specific root length (SRL cm/mg), and width (μm) at soil depths of 0 to 20, 20 to 40, and 40 to 60 cm was studied in Mahti wheat. Plant growth regulator applications reduced main shoot growth in barley and wheat up to 20%. Tiller production was enhanced by ethephon and TE treatment in all species, but not adequately to compensate for PGR-induced reduction in main shoot growth.

I det svenska avelsforbundet SWB infordes linjar beskrivning pa trearstest ar 2013 och syftet ar att beskrivningen ska fungera som ett komplement till den traditionella poangbedomningen. I denna studie har linjara protokoll fran \n987 hastar visade pa trearstest analyserats. Syftet var att undersoka hur resultaten kan anvandas i avelsarbetet och hur den linjara beskrivningen kan forbattras. Protokollet bestod av 45 egenskaper, varav 20 var exteriora egenskaper, 14 gangartsegenskaper och 11 hoppegenskaper. Varje egenskap beskrevs efter en niogradig skala A-I, dar A respektive I \nmotsvarade egenskapens tva ytterligheter. Genetiska parametrar skattades for linjara och poangbedomda egenskaper. Aven genetiska och fenotypiska korrelationer skattades, bade inom och mellan linjara respektive poangbedomda egenskaper. En djurmodell anvandes med de fixa effekterna kon och plats. De flesta egenskaper uppvisade en relativt jamn normalfordelning langs den linjara skalan. Standardavvikelserna var som storst for hoppegenskaper och som lagst for exteriora egenskaper. Arvbarheterna for de linjara egenskaperna varierade kraftigt (0,03-0,97), men var generellt medelhoga till hoga for gangarter och hoppegenskaper och laga till medelhoga for exteriora egenskaper. Arvbarheterna for poangbedomda egenskaper varierade mellan 0,18 och 0,89. Skattade genetiska korrelationer var starka mellan egenskaper inom respektive gangart (0,50-0,97) och mellan hoppegenskaper (0,44-0,99). De genetiska sambanden mellan poangbedomda egenskaper och motsvarande linjara egenskaper var starka for gangarter (-0,83 till -0,97) och for hoppegenskaper (-0,62 till -0,99). Aven for de exteriora egenskaperna fanns starka genetiska samband, framforallt mellan typ och motsvarande linjara egenskaper. Ovriga jamforelser var i de flesta fall inte signifikanta. Resultaten visar att den linjara beskrivningen kan bidra med mycket vardefull information och pa sikt bli ett viktigt verktyg i avelsarbetet. \nEftersom de skattade arvbarheterna i de flesta fall var medelhoga till hoga ar det mojligt att skatta relativt sakra avelsvarden for de linjara egenskaperna och pa sa vis gora avelsvarderingen mer detaljerad. Med den linjara beskrivningen kan ocksa hastagaren fa en mer objektiv och utforlig redogorelse for hastens egenskaper, vilket kan vara till nytta i den fortsatta utbildningen eller vid val av hingst. Denna studie grundar sig pa den forsta argangen \nmed linjar beskrivning i SWB.

In order to analyze in more detail the progressive impregnation of a fibrous preform by a fluid resin, the numerical model here proposed considers the flow through a partially saturated medium, including the dependence of permeability on the saturation degree. The model consists of an elliptic equation governing the pressure distribution and a transport hyperbolic equation governing the evolution of the saturation. A global flux limiter fixed mesh strategy is proposed for solving the transport equation with source term which describes the saturation evolution in RTM process. The flux limiter method has the ability to limit the extra numerical diffusion introduced by standard first-order schemes. This formulation could be an appealing choice for improving RTM flow simulations and optimize injection processes. Some preliminary numerical results are presented in order to validate the proposed numerical strategy.","inCitations":["d0a7e0cbf0f384219cb8dd2b3dfa29d4454cf433","bab80def889a2a935b9811eb01b20cee2d41b167","09c3fe8538b46ce4e1ed81f1fc059e5511d9c3c7","e09c91a634253672fd382388ff53dee7dcad93f1","2470566b0ba92070040c19086bf522394608b15b"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"A flux limiter strategy for solving the saturation equation in RTM process simulation","doi":"10.1016/j.compositesa.2009.09.008","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compositesa.2009.09.008","venue":""}

The molecular symmetry of 9MA is the same as that of toluene (G12). Because of two-fold symmetry in the pi system, the potential curve has six-fold barriers to CH3 rotation. In toluene, the barrier height to CH3 rotation V6 is very small, nearly free rotation. As for 9MA-h12, we could fit the level energies by potential curves with the barrier heights of V6(S0) = 118 cm(-1) and V6(S1) = 33 cm(-1). These barrier heights are remarkably larger than those of toluene and are attributed to hyperconjugation between the pi orbitals and methyl group. The dispersed fluorescence spectrum showed broad emission for the excitation of 0(0)(0) + 386 cm(-1) band, indicating that intramolecular vibrational redistribution efficiently occurs, even in the vibronic level of low excess energy of the isolated 9MA molecule.","inCitations":["73b4944d6c0ef483b3035357e88e753b6a9fbeb8"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"CH3 internal rotation in the S0 and S1 states of 9-methylanthracene.","doi":"10.1021/jp808550r","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1021/jp808550r","venue":"The journal of physical chemistry.

Data collection methods used checks and measurements of bio motor and gymnastic fundamental skills. Data analysis using correlation and linear regression to predict the future competence. The results showed that: there was significant correlation between the physical conditioning items and gymnastics basics skills, but there is also strong significant linear regression ( p : .032<.05)  from physical conditioning with basic skill of Gymnastics. The standing balance ( r = .728) and broad jump ( r = .751) were found more influenced for gymnastic basic skills. There was a great significant different between the pre-test and posttest gymnastic basic skills means with p value < .001. The high standard deviation between the items showed the different adaptation of the subjects according to the physical conditioning. In conclusion physical conditioning was found as parenting for developing the gymnastic basic skills.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://journal.uny.ac.id/index.php/cp/article/download/29641/pdf"],"title":"Effect of Physical Conditioning on Student Basic Skills Gymnastics","doi":"10.21831/cp.v39i1.29641","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.21831/cp.v39i1.29641","venue":""}

Intense alkaline phosphatase activities (APA) were observed in the unplanted control, with their predominant part, phytoplankton APA (accounting for up to 44.7% of the total APA), and another large share, bacterial APA. These correspond with the large average concentration of total phosphorus (TP), total dissolved phosphorus (TDP) and soluble reactive (SRP) as well as high phytoplankton density in the water column. The consistency among P concentrations, phytoplankton density and APA, together with the positive impact of phytoplankton density on total APA revealed by the structural equation modelling (SEM), indicates that facilitated APA levels in water is an essential strategy for phytoplankton to enhance the available P. Furthermore, a positive interaction between phytoplankton APA and bacteria APA was detected, suggesting a potential collaboration between phytoplankton and bacteria to boost available P content in the water column. Both macrophyte species had a prominent performance on regulating phytoplankton proliferation. The phytoplankton density and quantum yield in C. demersum systems were all significantly lower (33.8% and 24.0%) than those in V. spiralis systems. Additionally, a greater decoupling effect of C. demersum on the relationship between P, APA, phytoplankton density, bacteria dynamic and quantum yield was revealed by SEM. These results imply that the preferred tactic of different species could lead to the performance gap.","inCitations":["d85dea21a477ee07c9cadf32c56f9e056ba4d863","c53201e044375fb1b3f9b11864c541d605fa99b2","617123ddff887bc2e48c190650636b756dcdc9eb","6aa09cfc5f64c0969720e4ad482dc2b13bbea177"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Increasing phytoplankton-available phosphorus and inhibition of macrophyte on phytoplankton bloom.","doi":"10.1016/j.scitotenv.2016.11.002","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2016.11.002","venue":"The Science of the total environment"}

Thus the index to measure rural development has become one of growing dependency of the rural production system on the urban-industrial economy which regulates the markets monitors supplies and demands commands the polity and thereby lays down priorities for the economy. The new change agents and grassroots organizations do not view poverty as purely an economic problem. 2nd the grassroots groups reject the \"inputs\" view of rural development as a partial and lopsided view. The general approach of the grassroots groups is not to work for such territorial units as a village a block or a district but to work with specific vulnerable groups within and across these units. 3rd the new change agents and grassroots organizations view rural development not as a problem of efficient implementation and management of given schemes and programs but essentially as a struggle for establishing the economic and political rights of the poorest among the poor. 4th they all resist the ongoing attempts for the depoliticization of the development process. 5th the political parties and the development administration having failed in their role of linking the policies and programs of the government with the felt needs of the people the scope of grassroots initiatives in this regard has immensely increased. Lastly the new change agents are more inclined to work with longterm programs emphasizing decentralization of economic and political power. In sum the grassroots initiatives in India today are both critique and protest against the prevailing model of development and the emergence of a new and alternative approach to rural development that is more holistic transcends economism and managerial ethics and is self-consciously political. There is a distinct possibility of grassroots initiatives. A need exists for new independent macro initiatives that would link up with the grassroots movements and organizations and would serve them in response to their felt needs.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Grass roots initiatives in India.","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

Whereas this is not problematic for multi-disciplinary research projects difficulties may arise when quantitatively trained demographers diversify to use less familiar data collection tools. We review the scale of this recent trend and the choice of qualitative methods typically employed by demographic researchers. Using insights from a comparative qualitative study undertaken in Zimbabwe and Senegal, we discuss some problems inherent in qualitative data collection and analysis and propose ways in which such data should and should not be used. Focussing in particular on semi-structured in-depth interviews, we discuss issues of representativity, investigate respondents’ silence on specific topics, and the role of interviewer characteristics in influencing the interview subject matter.","inCitations":["8835675b890f6f87c72f06394c05c1c18983b0af","baaf13057c692fa2024af6942dec6e640c7c3728","c327a48c8868788227cf52bcc3e7eaad981eb634","4d34a4e0d8617c2180c8f416710d94d486be165e","59822787d5a7ecbbf52c269a0446dca977e12e8e","ca4ce691965da6262dab60b1ad829e9eaed4df45","5e2f055f93f6b5d8950c12fdc932175258347108","a4ca719044bba6373e475d87870289bee6692ae5","39b70a6a41887ad0dff9bc8f40eef5dd435365d3","cb3c3edb591f237a3ab0f5ffd5d66ff27c75f54a","05fac924addd76bf7a52bd7e5416e516e86b4916","4a48650e18d28fd60c58a9c2462996bc56326318","54d9408104219de3f6bd4795e9825219d73b5433","727c03c9d420797cdf9ff82b73bfff195fe81cb2","862e1685d6782ddc5f8c1271e299eea96b7356d0","0a34957f4f6536a22e5dfcbed29e7b1c6306262a","16ec7bf72b08818b759e82d5182d648e5637507e","1902272303674a1437e8a0758a732bb48f8904f1","561204c29205adda87145071ce69cbf271ad5343","431e9563173868860f5106353369bfcb51ea7cbe","d09b860b786a328cbf9581d301a0da4c13ceb22d","5906bb2824da5a6094b39f4037bdfa73c0878a08","2d8c144d42684ea68eac8c6d502e8c2218d4486b","2f1343b0df4d5c775f52e4c7668d69b4a08e5ed1","e34b7e4d54a34a96cca0b8eabc91eb2a210ecf2c","6052617349bed7f5301382c8bb281264ee0442d2","196424566b36fb43e4056026a0aa8ee8cf08d235","5e8cd90bb2b43cc5bcc46cc2cd462e56b88d6fb9","d01f43136532a154d67caa8a62f61fe5f4513c60","df152c9dd9460685df972b2fb4dfa70784aadc57","2b08d919e6a0bdbc09fa034d417557ffd4ae8ce2","aad7d01f51daa0b18f4efc5eb0197ac1932273ac","5617eb3e4fb8b0f2026e6c9f968e2f30446e30d2","5be378d08651d8a98939330218d815b9bf193189","009e1f33d0197f93860146c5a2099ee211940e03","1b8be99840f6d2e69ed8f5a1418188c4d88ed6b9","e44ca515bd930b9df6cd58e05bc71a473cbe7d80","cdca33722ff3038a77ac69bb6870b989ff9e5c32"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.demographic-research.org/volumes/vol11/3/11-3.pdf","http://archive.kubatana.net/docs/resdoc/qualitative_data_040120.pdf"],"title":"Qualitative data in demography: The sound of silence and other problems","doi":"10.4054/DemRes.2004.11.3","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.4054/DemRes.2004.11.3","venue":""}

Metodos Se llevo a cabo una reunion con un grupo de expertos en EII formado por medicos, psicologos, enfermeras y representantes de pacientes. Se presentaron resultados de: 1) un grupo focal previo, 2) encuestas a medicos y pacientes y 3) una revision sistematica sobre instrumentos de cribado de ansiedad y depresion. Se realizo una discusion guiada sobre los aspectos psicologicos y emocionales mas importantes en EII, los criterios de derivacion apropiados y situaciones a evitar. Se selecciono el instrumento validado mas aplicable a la practica clinica. Se diseno un documento con recomendaciones, asi como una encuesta Delphi. La encuesta fue enviada al grupo y a un comite cientifico seleccionado del grupo GETECCU, con el objetivo de establecer el grado de apoyo a las recomendaciones establecidas. Resultados Se establecieron 15 recomendaciones, pertenecientes a 3 procesos clave: 1) que pasos dar para identificar problemas psicologicos en consulta de EII, 2) criterios de derivacion a profesionales de la salud mental y 3) abordaje de los problemas psicologicos. Conclusiones Se deben facilitar recursos a los profesionales sanitarios para que puedan tratar estos aspectos en consulta, identificar los trastornos que puedan afectar el curso de la enfermedad o su impacto en la vida del paciente, para ser tratados y seguidos por el profesional mas adecuado. Estas recomendaciones pueden servir de base para el rediseno de los servicios o procesos de EII y como justificacion para la formacion del personal sanitario.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Recomendaciones del Grupo Español de Trabajo en Enfermedad de Crohn y Colitis Ulcerosa (GETECCU) y de la Confederación de Asociaciones de Enfermedad de Crohn y Colitis Ulcerosa (ACCU) para el manejo de los aspectos psicológicos en la enfermedad inflamatoria intestinal","doi":"10.1016/j.gastrohep.2017.10.003","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gastrohep.2017.10.003","venue":""}

Na Regiao Sudoeste do Parana, e notoria a fragmentacao e a exploracao dos recursos florestais nativos. Neste cenario, e importante o estimulo de praticas de recuperacao florestal, com enfase na preservacao de especies arboreas nativas, como a Erythrina falcata Benth. (corticeira-da-serra), pertencente a familia Fabaceae, e de importância ecologica, economica e paisagistica. O estudo objetivou a producao associada a distribuicao de mudas, juntamente com informacoes a cerca de E. falcata. A partir de sementes coletadas em arvores matrizes selecionadas, foram produzidas 100 mudas da especie em sacos de polietileno, contendo substrato florestal. Posteriormente, as mudas foram concedidas aos participantes da XI Festa Regional das Sementes, Sao Jorge d’ Oeste, PR. Concomitantemente houve a exposicao de painel contendo informacoes sobre o projeto, o qual envolve outras especies arboreas. Tambem foram repassadas informacoes sobre E. falcata, como sua ocorrencia, caracteristicas e importância. O trabalho oportunizou a interacao entre a Universidade e a comunidade, incentivando a pratica conservacionista. Pretende-se dar continuidade as atividades, expandindo o numero de especies arboreas envolvidas e realizando visitacoes em escolas, para exposicao dos trabalhos, ja que a conscientizacao faz parte da educacao ambiental.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://revistas.utfpr.edu.br/dv/index.php/SABIO/article/download/1230/675"],"title":"Erythrina falcata Benth.: Alternativas para sua Conservação","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

The effect of peritoneal dialysis on this function has not previously been described. The aim here was to investigate the effect of peritoneal dialysis on gastric myoelectrical activity. Gastric myoelectrical activity was recorded by electrogastrography (EGG) in 23 patients with CRF (18 with dyspepsia) during peritoneal dialysis and with the peritoneal cavity empty of dialysis fluid (14 patients), and in 20 healthy controls. Two 30-min EGG recordings before and after a solid test meal were analyzed using spectral analysis methods. No significant difference in the percentage of normal 2- to 4-cpm slow waves was found in patients on peritoneal dialysis compared to those with the peritoneal cavity empty of dialysis fluid or to controls (in fasting state 83 ± 3%, 80 ± 5% and 89 ± 4%, in fed state 91 ± 3%, 86 ± 4% and 83 ± 4%, respectively). It was found that the power ratio (change in power of normal slow waves in fed state) was significantly higher in the 14 patients on peritoneal dialysis compared to the same patients with the peritoneal cavity empty of dialysis fluid (27.2 ± 10.7 vs 8.6 ± 4.8, P < 0.05). There was no significant difference in the power ratio between patients with the peritoneal cavity empty of dialysis fluid and controls (8.6 ± 4.8 vs 7.5 ± 2.2). The subgroup of patients with no dyspepsia had a significantly higher power ratio compared to those with dyspepsia both on dialysis and with the peritoneal cavity empty of dialysis fluid (39.4 ± 13.7 vs 12.4 ± 5.2 and 29.2 ± 21.5 vs 2.8 ± 0.4 respectively, P < 0.05). In conclusion, there was no significant difference in gastric myoelectrical activity between patients with the peritoneal cavity empty of dialysis fluid and controls. Dialysis fluid in the peritoneal cavity seems to enforce the gastric myoelectrical signal.","inCitations":["8f5ddb2de5d759e67a0da8427c1a9c3876f5fba3","846ff66342d7b43a79de4109845ff1850925a3f4","6269d61138f5c7c83bab39e189e6123f0d72ff37","1cebce5590dc3d1285fb0a4263d86d1207f13216"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Effect of Peritoneal Dialysis on Gastric Myoelectrical Activity in Patients with Chronic Renal Failure","doi":"10.1023/A:1012711009532","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1023/A%3A1012711009532","venue":"Digestive Diseases and Sciences"}

In principle, an optimal selection of encoding parameters (motion vectors, quantization parameters, coding modes) should take into account the whole temporal horizon of a GOP. However, in practical coding schemes, these choices are made on a frame-by-frame basis, thus with a possible loss of performance. In this paper we describe a tree-based model for pixelwise coding dependencies: each pixel in a frame is the child of a pixel in a previous reference frame. We show that some tree structures are more favorable than others from a rate-distortion perspective, e.g., because they entail a large descendance of pixels which are well predicted from a common ancestor. In those cases, a higher quality has to be assigned to pixels at the top of such trees. We promote the creation of these structures by adding a special discount term to the conventional Lagrangian cost adopted at the encoder. The proposed model can be implemented through a double-pass encoding procedure. Specifically, we devise heuristic cost functions to drive the selection of quantization parameters and of motion vectors, which can be readily implemented into a state-of-the-art H.264/AVC encoder. Our experiments demonstrate that coding efficiency is improved for video sequences with low motion, while there are no apparent gains for more complex motion. We argue that this is due to both the presence of complex encoder features not captured by the model, and to the complexity of the source to be encoded.","inCitations":["b480b747e2d7d80a95c6f08e48ab725ea377e56a","f1323c254cd1847a31cd83496da37431a88758c4"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Dependent video coding using a tree representation of pixel dependencies","doi":"10.1117/12.895327","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1117/12.895327","venue":"Optical Engineering + Applications"}

The encoded ER-located Cα-formylglycine-generating enzyme (FGE) catalyzes the activation of newly synthesized sulfatases by cotranslationally oxidizing a conserved cysteine residue to the Cα-formylglycine (FGly), the catalytically active amino acid residue of sulfatases. Some FGE mutants have already been characterized biochemically and initial assumptions about the relationship between genotype and phenotype of the disease are set up. Crystallization of the FGE-WT enabled - about the localization of the mutations in the model - to make predictions in terms of their expected damage. The confirmation of the suspected relationship between genotypic and phenotypic specificities effects, using the crystal structure model of a FGE mutant could not be achieved to date. Currently no data from completely purified FGE mutants exists.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Untersuchungen zur molekularen Ursache der Multiplen Sulfatase-Defizienz: Reinigung, Funktions- und Strukturanalyse von varianten Proteinen des Formylglycin-generierenden Enzyms","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

The objective of this study was to investigate normal age-related changes in the neural substrates of emotional arousal processing. Twenty-three young and 23 older, healthy women underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging as they viewed images which were neutral or positive in valence and which varied in arousal level from low to high. Using a parametric modulation approach, we examined how the blood oxygen-level dependent signal varied with single trial subjective ratings of valence and arousal, and whether this differed with age. In accordance with previous studies we found that the older group showed greater activation in response to positive valence, in the left amygdala, left middle temporal gyrus and right lingual gyrus. In contrast however, they showed reduced reactivity to emotional arousal, in occipital and temporal visual cortices bilaterally, the left inferior parietal cortex, and the supplementary motor area bilaterally. This study represents the first of its kind to clearly dissociate how aging affects the neural correlates of emotional arousal and valence. The changes in arousal processing may in part be mediated by the functional reorganization evident in the aging brain, such as reduced activation of the posterior cortices as described by the posterior-anterior shift in ageing (PASA) effect.","inCitations":["d3160ea1faf423c22388a4cc8649d0b07b78d74c","c4f65e9ec927c9fad72a2648031913f4953ac234","195673bdcb35df6f7a1dadb0a4aed9aa7afdf8db","be41225421cc56b60b468241ecf69bc81eee47ae","27fabacb13299a82ea7efab915c9f4618d0c39c9","f90085ed522584ff1877ad15c78ed1e12250df62","8830d2ebab8e02a109fb3b8baebe3252224c6ea7","064dd6f5eeca531875fe4afcb29ff638f8465e0c","ecba87a7410bf6d299cd1c79f2c75d3cc1252ea0","398c4880de0bca0493b2eaebfaba23fb2195026c","cc7134df299806643580b45e160228d47bc314ce","eb12c486dda6c7afb0693a216d39c00feab78a29","c7f8991ebdd957d48f06eb42450768f9bd8b3373","c1f1f28f93bef59d700bf916c4abef70eface50e","13f3a6afc013841e9781fb3cdb1171f8df4e8261","d4f4ee3c0e9852181a0416458c9282a2e5e31930","7349fc1dbb4c41726889ddeddb45460908eeb5e0","d90a5c8895f8d6706bd0564f7bcf0eef8d0bb318","e0da19e4eaa8013a69ac2ffddc49dadd597dfea7","e7bd989d3e4163e54b7da1ec6eec42e67f128960","46ed1984a344027a9eacda35c9692797060edf48","c996d9794ba6363af4d3573aa34e7ec84421a6e5"],"pdfUrls":["http://isiarticles.com/bundles/Article/pre/pdf/39660.pdf","http://www.tara.tcd.ie/bitstream/handle/2262/67242/Kehoe_et_al_2012_Neurobio_Aging.pdf?isAllowed=y&sequence=1","https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0197458012003946","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0197458012003946?dgcid=api_sd_search-api-endpoint"],"title":"Healthy aging is associated with increased neural processing of positive valence but attenuated processing of emotional arousal: an fMRI study","doi":"10.1016/j.neurobiolaging.2012.07.006","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neurobiolaging.2012.07.006","venue":"Neurobiology of Aging"}

The socio-cultural impact of increased tourism on a small, once isolated island community in the Bahama Islands is discussed. The community's traditions have, for the most part, been maintained. However, material living standards, occupational specializations, and race relations have been significantly altered. For a number of reasons, the local people have not taken on the role of “professional natives.”","inCitations":["bf4c0d66f74c10e479f6c3c4460c445b16107fa1","dd763e03559f34e74416f33e07f2a05f5f4d3e6d","9ad9e5d0752c16f45c14dc2f846303d557b177e4","477ec53128f8f2e4d88287993714ff7bbbbddcb6","be219cb19ca7f829a2d885b3ffca82fbef81a879","d884b9816df8f0122b0b884a675f0d0d6430d13f","cd276bdc9aa1bee6ddc20879727e1976002c0519","9a5f6a120906774cb9d3b9e890a34ecb5da24a7e","cba79267a4ddc35c337f2ec5db0e9f99d2dd49b3"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"The impact of tourism: A case from the Bahama Islands","doi":"10.1016/0160-7383(79)90144-0","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/0160-7383%2879%2990144-0","venue":""}

En casos reales, no academicos, el tamano de la matriz generada, ademas de ser dispersa, es grande y en general malcondicionada. En el proceso de migracion del modelo continuo a un modelo discreto mediante la aproximacion con diferenciasfinitas, pueden considerarse diferentes niveles de implicitud, que van desde la formulacion totalmente implicita, TI, hasta la formulacion IMPES. La formulacion IMPES se clasifica como un metodo eliptico, donde el metodo de multimalla se desenvuelve muy eficientemente en la solucion del sistema de ecuaciones algebraicas lineales. Entre los metodos multimalla existen el Geometrico (MMG), Algebraico (MMA) y Algebraico como precondicionador de los metodos: Gradiente Conjugado (MMACG) y Residuo Minimo Generalizado (MMAGMRES). Los metodos multimalla (MMA, MMACG y MMAGMRES) demandan menos requerimientos de memoria. Por lo tanto, el presente trabajo se ha desarrollado utilizando estos metodos. Los objetivos del presente trabajo fueron: 1) Desarrollar un simulador numerico de yacimientos que pudiera manejardiferentes escenarios de explotacion, agotamiento natural e inyeccion de agua y 2) Evaluar el desempeno numerico de los metodos multimalla junto con metodos directos (a modo de tener una referencia, ej. eliminacion Gaussiana de matrices dispersas con pivoteo parcial, NSPIV) e iterativos (ej. GMRES). Basandose en los resultados de este trabajo, considerando modelos mecanisticos, se concluyo que para dominios grandes, los metodos multimalla son mas rapidos y mas eficientes que el metodo GMRES, lo contrario es cierto para los dominios pequenos. En otras palabras, para los modelos de simulacion numerica de yacimientos a gran escala, los metodos multimalla han demostrado ser una herrami","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://biblat.unam.mx/hevila/Ingenieriapetrolera/2015/no7/4.pdf"],"title":"Simulación numérica de yacimientos aplicando los métodos multimalla","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

A set of current sensors is situated adjacent the current path to sense respective phases of current therein. The current sensors provide respective current signals therefrom which are fed to a ground fault transformer. The ground fault transformer includes input inductors connected to respective ones of the current sensors such that current flowing through each respective current sensor also flows through one of the input inductors. An output inductor in the ground fault transformer is coupled with the input inductors for adding the current signals from the current sensors and for producing an output current signal in the presence of a ground fault. The output current signal is then rectified to provide a rectified signal corresponding to the output current. The processor receives the rectified signal to detect the ground fault in the three phase current path and provides a trip signal to a solenoid to break the current path. The ground fault transformer also includes a test input inductor for receiving an external AC signal to simulate a ground fault.","inCitations":["5ece04f7b47b8f27e5d9b98248f31a23fbc750d6","44a1c64419362047bf8a7f8d7081e96bf9a8efbc","cdd44735d9dc3bc3a9b40efecb84c02915f98ea2","99c81c6889e99f3447bf748a7c5eedd3143d828a","36bb2bcf5dcb9d4a970b0781a7f139a934d9b1fc","ce03eb4fc80c77ab8193351fe038955df6382a5f","10f2bdaaeeeffc417b797b30cf4aa7cb4647eccd","c144107e5c290f43424d7aaadba1feb2f9cbb177","e0d7b359f432bcefc28bf122586e0e4b7df5a20a","a849f784dd2871b17cca7928b89f707844455ae6","f488ab3bcc8bff6cb9cc8674b3e9a48119079078","299f018e8cac18587d384b1a392de020ae3a9923","8972c6d6820894d3060bf44f351bbe9d64d22d23","46504b9cad6f5b68d408d05b329a284e58d6cf01","e337a25f6a8a701bc027b3f5a89d16b3073b5583","24a507b56ef875ed40575524f310648d78c19aa6","b71f41d5d41abb20473dfc9afada8de2c4c4e4df","540655f98740bf591c4b353793c6873fb3d3ccfb","ec1c17b52be7ce4b19dd4dc5a354ceb0f593e601","2e84a53729c558ec1c559ea51f400a7ec9cf3af4","51bbb9f9fe1c95e44283ec62562fc8bf50abd6b8","d438aee0808814dbaf82c7d24ec8e57b992a2772","687e2d35280476ee741f7e7b471a517a0a068285","4d723d8449af274cda4a4fdbab2138c3ff03b292","9c2dd5875fadf3745f2b92f480adbb53a3771da9","10a903ec060e0f69df8f69108862a4ee1f79bdc5","97b9fc665a487b3defdc7dc03307e3efff79166f","561e030039b2502425c6ef68d179f71156ac2ac2","6c652f07d097308779de1f4d142bc823a06b56bc","6719e6834c37d55b4aeb2aea7f017e8ca2b4e2f3","092fdc786ba850c978d2d06191dcf954f89e1a2f","d878f6224c68e014a34c7c1d3ea22ac90cecb934","88c0ba160e142eb325ead9790b8c39da60103a3b","9c928df714a436fa939d63cd1bbd86796599719c","f63adf57a2b357105a17121f87dc3303b53a47bf","900d9649daa93aa66f72d372f97794b12e08e5bd","d820034f89d4311cd636641336cc674f9c5c30bc","d0ea60556130cc187f687df93b02617365c966ea","6036f200a852737f8034d6536b2f36699b967de4","a75c99459aec7acf35d9f7b541bc7c9a4ba68995","1fa0adbb5da74d0932eca3fedaf80229778879bc","e002523aebd8a6620782f47ef37c3347b22d4b41","0b215c85e6485598280b4d0a0527ba8b614ccd0b","da77d391ec1f0e5b6a3dbd9670bf6562a5d7fdb8","b326d60cb039ece154d77beb67a384842d115c21","d02512b3083975f71beee6e10073f6b5b04145f8","31591abf64a9ee479bdcb74c7be996971c87f6c2","ecaa43dbe70c08ccb22b129202e311ba74bd95f7","435e18c050340ae04f88ac1b29930c83fab9b895","3e369061cbd70416d8b5dd88651188ba3653e2c8","fac2bb0fdf3a071a6c54388b7161044522572dd0","14ef510fc8ebb5c4ab07c8483ac7f852a4f422cc","2af09f9370f07b8de44b168ad271259fa9da5eba","ef301683ebf05eb1c72af0410cf1105ab5c651c0","0a2937f821adb1ddaf09f363db7dcc4ba18d3727","0689443dd3b6d7858b5b7e8ae0fed6b849de0380","d792d0bb67328b053e65318b91b66987f1020d9e","afd2a23f446f5b0b2c6296858fecd92ee5aba1b3","c29b1b5e8248cc5d73dea52b74c69c6e3ee3069f","f2faf98329f81d3cb41726705f5e6610f16809d6","c766e1f6d4a93cc366708770febb06d06d033971","f64a9adbedec8633a60ce68b97c3a9573b8823a1","1affebc4d197d3765248c148ae84a0c56ec194d6","7e3648f0b18af17d0fb5d70acc5133b03d7187b4","3f217cc6529d3c304bd417bdb4d95e40c70cd161","42e5074017fa2ab4a40a51d35efad091becc41eb","13717e81269bbfd803c199b7b61fcd80e866d6d3","960ec2d2863a95bb25b88ddccc3124c069568514","ce5e390fb7e8ac64707b24fb6a76b3c975cb4d48","af720811a7409d1f9e51b8f83de19447071f0aec","a18cd62bebd9ee44077a883fc498d8090d875bdc","de7f0592f78d8a9594069e33097fa559fcf3c343"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Dendrimers in biomedical applicationsreflections on the field","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

We analyzed the resulting vibrations and disturbances and their effect on a high-voltage electron microscope (HVEM). The characteristics of the construction equipment, various construction tasks, wave propagation and attenuation in the soil, along with the transmission of vibration forces to adjacent buildings were also clarified. These findings were combined and the effects on the HVEM were examined to model vibration-induced disturbances. The accuracy of these findings was confirmed by comparing the results obtained with actual observations that were recorded later. The findings of this study are expected to enhance the ability to distinguish between the many factors involved in vibration-induced disturbances caused by equipment. The findings could also be applied to monitoring construction activities and predicting the effects of vibration-induced disturbances on high-precision equipment.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://www.sharaku.nuac.nagoya-u.ac.jp/~tobita/0902JAABE.pdf"],"title":"Ground Vibration Caused by Tunnel Construction and its Effect on an Electron Microscope","doi":"10.3130/jaabe.8.267","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.3130/jaabe.8.267","venue":""}

Elevated levels of serum immunoglobulins are primarily the result of intense challenges by bacterial, viral, protozoal as well as helminthic infections. To understand changes of serum immunoglobulins in helminthic infections, 312 school children from Nan-Tou County, including 275 children infected with common intestinal helminthes and 37 non-infected controls, were studied. The stool was examined by Kato’s thick smear technic. The perianal adhesive scotch-tape technic was used for enterobiasis and blood was collected for immunoglobulin study. Immunoglobulin concentrations of IgG, IgA and IgM were determined by single radial immunodiffusion method and. IgE was measured by ETA (enzyme immunoassay, Phadezyrn IgE PRIST Kits, Pharmacia, Swedan). The results are summarized as follows: 1) Serum IgG levels were elevated in the intestinal helminthic infection group. Significant difference was noticed in groups with single infection of Enterobius (1,573±339mg/dl) Trichuris (1,543±272mg/dl), and in the mixed infection group of Trichuris and Enterobius (1,551±337mg/dl) when compared to that of. the non-infected group. 2) Marked increase of IgA and IgM levels was demonstrated in those. children with Enterobius infections (IgA: 250±94mg/dI, IgM: 285±l05mg/dl). 3) Marked elevation in IgE was found in all groups with helminthic infection. The arithmetic mean value was 898IU/Ml, or eight times higher than that of the normal controls (112IU/ml); the geometric mean was 447IU/ml, or seven times higher than that of the normal control (63IU/ml). In about 90% of infected children, IgE levels were higher than the mean value of normal controls and 63.3% of them had levels significantly increased (ie.＞mean+2SD of normals). The highest IgE level was observed in the group infected by hookworm, with an arithmetic mean value of 1,298 IU/ml (11.6 times higher than the normal) and a geometric mean of 578 IU/ml (9.2 times that of normal). The IgE levels in other groups, in decreasing order, were 517 IU/ml (geometric mean) for ascariasis, 514IU/ml for mixed enterobiasis and hookworm infection, 495 IU/ml for mixed ascariasis and enterobiasis, 450IU/ml for trichuriasis, 336IU/ml for mixed trichuriasis and enterobiasis, and 330 IU/ml for enterobiasis. No difference was observed in IgE levels between single and mixed infected groups.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"關於國小學童腸內蠕蟲感染時免疫球蛋白之研究（一）單獨感染與混合感染之免疫球蛋白變化及其比較","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

McCullough","ids":["8962932"]}],"journalName":"","paperAbstract":"Skilled perception of speech involves not just recognizing the words and sentences that a talker produces, but also perceiving properties imputed to the talker, such as being a foreigner. Because being perceived as foreign can have social consequences, it is important to understand the characteristics that contribute to this percept. Foreign accent perception is often studied in relation to talker characteristics, such as age of learning the second language (L2) or age of arrival in the L2-speaking country. However, listeners generally do not have direct access to such information. In order for the perception of foreign accent to be fully understood, it must be studied in relation to physical characteristics of the speech signal. This dissertation reports a series of six experiments that elicited American English monolinguals’ ratings of various properties of productions from native talkers of American English, Hindi, Korean, Mandarin, and Spanish, as well as their free classifications of talker language background. In the first four experiments, listeners heard samples of English and rated foreign accentedness or non-nativeness for each production. In the final two experiments, listeners rated non-Englishness for samples of each talker producing his or her native language (L1). Linear mixed effects regression models revealed that VOT, F1 frequency, and F2 frequency correlated with ratings of accentedness and non-nativeness for syllableand word-length stimuli. In addition, F3 frequency and F2 tilt correlated with the ratings for syllable-length stimuli, and vowel duration with the ratings for word-length","inCitations":["b489d3170b12a1fc86888d870d70bc2ce88b8622","3d8df01aba02749c7a4b1603d18afa16b306c6a2","e38b85bff4e0aeae0e555a3f7767fa2d2cd5e9b8","b21ee49bfb7f7c6e541e5466b41a5ed827df95f9"],"pdfUrls":["https://etd.ohiolink.edu/!etd.send_file?accession=osu1374052897&disposition=inline"],"title":"Acoustic correlates of perceived foreign accent in non-native English","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

While concentric zoning is most readily explained by changes in the chemical composition of the fluid or temperature of crystallization, the reasons for sector zoning are more difficult to explain. Relative enrichment in 18O for crystallographically different sectors of quartz corresponds to m >r >z. Sector zoning is, however, largely limited to the exterior zones of crystals and/or to crystals with large Al (>1000 ppm) and trace element contents, probably formed at temperatures <250ºC. Differences in δ18O between the prismatic (m) relative to the rhombohedral (r and z) growth sectors of up to 2‰ can be explained by a combination of a face-related crystallographic and/or a growth rate control. In contrast, isotopic sector zoning of up to about 1.5‰ amongst the different rhombohedral faces increases in parallel with the trace element content and is likely to represent disequilibrium growth. This is indicated by non-systematic, up to 2‰, differences within single growth zones and the irregular, larger or smaller, δ18O values (of several permil) of the exterior compared to the inner zones of the same crystals. Disequilibrium growth may be related to the large trace element content incorporated into the growing quartz at lower temperatures (<250ºC) and/or be related to fluid-vapour separation, allowing crystal growth from both a vapour as well as a liquid phase.","inCitations":["e686d8ae763cdc4bb0d1957a51056d858c58e0e6","0bba5075229520262369e016f000e7e1d90a6c38","283ed68023cafe78de6597545be8e7d84e0df253","355e2538b0161406204dce5bf8b2abf0f97dfdb0","33794f6f1a39d33ac39932203d9acd0badbd4018","d193687d6d2ad0f51f0cc34dbb18b74cd53c8cba","7c561c05373ed7775c024de713b334fe1e751284","6c91ff4345f3dc4fd3d81b79b10ece53c12091f3","ce584e47accd34607a0ad747e86700ada76c6217","a97442b73f98e095dbd51ad9c9ece6331736606c","0b5d2a53e83ec833899a5c2e3f2b834e81a8164c"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Oxygen isotope sector zoning in natural hydrothermal quartz","doi":"10.1180/minmag.2009.073.4.615","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1180/minmag.2009.073.4.615","venue":""}

Providing students with a quality science education is a key point for the scientific and technological development of a nation and, as a consequence, we train students with a capacity to perform a more critical reading about the environment that surrounds them, facilitating the decision-making of everyday life. The general objective of our work is to analyze the curriculum, within the scope of the disciplines that involve Science Teaching, in the initial formation of undergraduates in Pedagogy of a Public University Espirito Santo State of Brazil, besides investigating the pedagogical practices of the teachers during the initial years of teaching at an elementary municipal public school in the context of science education. It is a qualitative, theoretical-empirical, descriptive kind of work, constructed from observations, curriculum analysis and menus, semi-structured interviews conducted with teachers from the initial years of elementary school of the municipal school selected in Vitoria (ES) and the Capixaba public university The methodology was constructed from the following stages: exploratory phase; data collection and data analysis. For the analysis of data, we use the content analysis of the thematic type proposed by Laurence Bardin. We perceive difficulties in relation to the content of the discipline Biology in what concerns the initial and continued formation in Science Teaching, both among the students who attend the undergraduate course in Pedagogy and among the teachers of the elementary school. These difficulties have reflexes in everyday school activities, providing a still fragmented, disciplinary Science Teaching with methodologies that do not catch the attention of the students. Although the results indicate that research teaching is more present in the university studied than in the school analyzed, it is necessary in these two spaces to promote affirmative actions of continuing education for the educator in the scientific area that need to be planned and linked to the everyday praxis of the subjects.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"O ensino de Ciências no contexto dos anos iniciais da escola fundamental: a formação docente e as práticas pedagógicas","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}
