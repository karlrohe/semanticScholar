In biology, unknown sequences are usually related to gene regulation, diseases, undiscovered functions of genes, and food safety. The first genome walking method described, inverse PCR, has been established for 28 years. Despite the shortcomings of I-PCR, it has permitted the identification of several previously unknown sequences. To overcome the drawbacks of I-PCR and enhance its efficiency, and in conjunction with recent advances in molecular biology, many genome walking methods have been developed. Essentially, these methods may be classified into the two following categories: those with or those without genome digestion involving restriction enzymes in the first step. According to the features of specific genome walking techniques, these methods are suitable for different types of templates, such as long or short genome walking, single or multiple insertion identification, or simple or complex DNA structures. As the world begins to place greater importance on food security, the future of genome walking is promising, especially in identifying the unintended consequences of GM foods.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"PCR-Based Technologies for Identifying Unknown Gene Sequences","doi":"10.1007/978-981-10-1618-9_6","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-981-10-1618-9_6","venue":""}

Similarities and differences in the taphonomic features are evaluated with regard to marginal lacustrine sedimentary processes involved in the accumulation of these mammal assemblages. Selective preservation of skeletal-part and taxa in relation to facies have been explored to determine their suitability for palaeoecological analysis. The mortality in Cullar de Baza-1 and Huelago-1 corresponds to a catastrophic pattern, but other taphonomic features of the bones indicate that accumulation processes were diachronic as occurred in Huescar-1. This could be explained by selective-predation and/or seasonal accumulation of bones. Hydraulic sorting and transportation greatly controlled the size and shape of accumulated skeletal elements, and the different preservational circumstances of each environment largely constrained the taxonomic composition of the fossil bone assemblages. Autochthonous fauna only occurs in Huescar-1 corresponding to subaquatic environments. The absence of carnivores among the identifiable remains from Huelago-1 has no plausible taphonomic or sedimentological explanation. Nevertheless, after taking into account the taphonomic factors, the differences in taxonomic composition between these three mammal assemblages reflect differences in the surrounding habitats. The great diversity of ruminant artiodactyls, in particular browsers, is indicative of wooded or bushy areas in the surroundings of Huelago-1 although not in the immediate area of the lake margin. This diversity coincides with that observed in other Villafranchian localities and represents the greatest diversity of artiodactyls known from the Neogene and Quaternary record of Western Europe. In turn, the high diversity of sub-aquatic forms and a smaller variety of artiodactyl species in Huescar-1, reflects an open, sparsely forested environment susceptible to seasonal drought. A similar sparse forested environment has been deduced for Cullar de Baza-1. The climate and environmental conditions in Huescar-1 and Cullar de Baza-1 are consistent with a climatic deterioration at the beginning of the Middle Pleistocene (‘Glacial Pleistocene’).","inCitations":["b8203fe56e80362284b1fa8d46b7ac38d14d402e","3a235a7a36a4b8eafe563d686c24d796108fd731","72ec19922100c66565cb5f4de302de3d702e6258","1afd4b95de36b5036a03a6edb20928a36792401d","6e490ea62bff493e51eef7aff382342fc3ca0df9","f1d2218b9feb5dc7116ea659a7455fb49f19ff87","3150ffed465ecf81a7efdaa21a86dd3b1f60091d","4420ba8e478757c961549b0f776cf15870967815","28c2688730fe770ac8a886cd18c3114c54f3d253","d39cc17501c263aa905eb6370379d55bbe5951b9","23010af99d6d12c0351bfbbb9444f493e504f37a","415ef8bea09f851cf9250db22639b0ecdd0d9c83","ef1577502f68e4a4a379e53fac726e4e396712b5","203af221bae5b9129834611585de984e0f03ca85","3291c2d77af6194660f6ec6a330cf004d844e1ea","734dafc550f26cb5c3115c8aafd56dd0f4e08baf","344eb174c855cf765d0f2e76985e7b5a9b4c07fa","8c0887cf5a3b9c4465e845473bf62a31cdf4c940","5262deb5026440c6b43094cb94a8f2340937b2a1","bb2a8dd7ebf32ba77f1ed05ce4664b020705f4da","1c2fc8d00ac1676c686ed8bae466713888a441df","331b96c8d9c3f5cc516baec334ab85a88264fd4b"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Vertebrate taphonomy in circum-lake environments: three cases in the Guadix-Baza Basin (Granada, Spain)","doi":"10.1016/S0031-0182(00)00151-6","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/S0031-0182%2800%2900151-6","venue":""}

Women were categorized using their prepregnancy body mass index. Underweight, overweight and obese women were compared with normal weight women. The primary outcome was the birth of a small-for-gestational-age infant, defined as a birth weight below the 10th percentile for gestational age and sex. Secondary outcomes were large-for-gestational-age infants (birth weight >90th percentile for gestational age) and preterm birth (<37 weeks' gestation). Logistic regression models were used to obtain the ORs of having small-for-gestational-age infants, large-for-gestational-age infants and preterm birth as a function of body mass index.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe proportions of underweight, normal weight, overweight and obese women were 10.8%, 53.3%, 19.7% and 16.2%, respectively. Obese asthmatic women were not found to be significantly more at risk for giving birth to small-for-gestational-age infants (OR 0.6 [95% CI 0.4 to 1.1]), large-for-gestational-age infants (OR 1.2 [95% CI 0.7 to 2.2]) or having a preterm delivery (OR 0.7 [95% CI 0.4 to 1.3]) than normal-weight asthmatic women.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nNo significant negative interaction between maternal asthma and obesity on adverse perinatal outcomes was observed.","inCitations":["2b3cc256dd3aabcee9ff787e34eedd6d300bc951","84fba10a47b8183705ca382c80a399c3206658f7"],"pdfUrls":["http://downloads.hindawi.com/journals/crj/2013/815143.pdf"],"title":"Impact of obesity on perinatal outcomes among asthmatic women.","doi":"10.1155/2013/815143","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1155/2013%2F815143","venue":"Canadian respiratory journal"}

Guideline-based care consisted of (i) providing advice to employers on how to assess and intervene on the obesogenic work environment, (ii) conducting five face-to-face behavioral change counseling sessions with employees to improve their lifestyles, and (iii) evaluating the outcome and maintaining sections i and ii. Data were collected at baseline and 6, 12, and 18-months follow-up. To evaluate the effects of the intervention, multilevel analyses were performed.\n\n\nRESULTS\nNo significant differences were found between the intervention and control group on waist circumference [β 1.2 cm, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) -0.6-2.9], body weight (β 0.3 kg, 95% CI -1.0-1.6), body mass index (β 0.1 kg/m (2), 95% CI -0.3-0.5), systolic blood pressure (β 1.7 mmHG, 95% CI -2.4-5.8), diastolic blood pressure (β 0.3 mmHG, 95% CI -1.0-0.6), cholesterol (β 0 mmol/l, 95% CI -0.2-0.2), or quality of life indicators after 18-months follow-up. Stratified analyses showed an increase in waist circumference among men (β 2.5 cm, 95% CI 0.5-4.5) and obese intervention participants (β 2.7 cm, 95% CI 0.6-4.7) compared to control participants.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe draft occupational health guideline was not more effective than usual care. Therefore, the guideline in its current form cannot be recommended for implementation.","inCitations":["aee6c7c61a6fd8a6700a7f21bf5248483eaf808d","1a8bcc500cb1bd2d7fee4e6dd24ba50fd99647f5","0615456603bcff16b350a35f7cef4cb6f0cf6070","d108010e77067812b2cb1fc5160450352015bf75","a0c81e921daaa98452ce269b32b74f257cadef2b","82242e309dc38e23dd5aca4dd3194cc4f72f5ed7"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Long-term effects of an occupational health guideline on employees' body weight-related outcomes, cardiovascular disease risk factors, and quality of life: results from a randomized controlled trial.","doi":"10.5271/sjweh.3341","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.5271/sjweh.3341","venue":"Scandinavian journal of work, environment & health"}

With a reasonable assumption undertaken for the potential functions of longitudinal and shear waves in the nth layer medium, the characteristic equation of interface waves in the N-layered plate is derived and presented in a determinant form. The particle displacement and stress components are further presented in explicit forms. The dispersion curves and wave structures of interface waves in both a three-layered Al-Steel-Ti and a four-layered Steel-Al-Steel-Ti plate are displayed subsequently. It is observed in dispersion curves that obvious dispersion occurs on the low frequency band, whereas the phase velocities converge to the corresponding true Stoneley wave mode velocities at high frequency, and the number of interface wave modes equals the number of interfaces in multilayered plates (if all individual interfaces satisfy the existence condition of Stoneley waves). The wave structures reveal that the displacement components of interface waves are relatively high at interfaces, and the amplitude distribution varies from frequency to frequency. In the end, a similarly structured three-layered Al-Steel-Ti plate is tested. In this experiment, theoretical group velocity and experimental group velocity are compared. According to the discussion and comparison, the predicted group velocities are in good agreement with the experimental results. Thus, the theory of interface wave in multilayered plates is proved. As a result, the proposed theoretical approach represents a leap forward in the understanding of how to promote the characteristic study and practical applications of interface waves in multilayered structures.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Interface waves in multilayered plates.","doi":"10.1121/1.5033902","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1121/1.5033902","venue":"The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America"}

Moreover, it has an impact on occupants’ performance and well-being from a psychological and physiological point of view, influencing thermal and visual comfort conditions. However, large windows on building facades, facilitating daylight entry, may increase the risks of overheating or visual discomfort, requiring proper control of shading devices in order to prevent glare and direct solar radiation on the occupants. The hard task becomes defining a balance between those contrasting requisites, considering the specific application context and using different metrics in order to analyze both comfort and energy aspects. In this paper, the effects of external and internal roller shades, both on thermal and visual comfort and on overall building energy demand, have been considered for the climatic condition of Rome (South Italy) in order to assess the long-term comfort conditions and energy performance of an open space office. Some office characteristics, such as windows extension, glazing type and shading characteristics has been changed in order to assess the performance under different conditions. The indoor thermal comfort levels are controlled by fixing adequate operative temperature set points while visual comfort is ensured through control of shading and lighting systems. Evaluation of building performance has been assessed through (i) total primary energy demand regarding energy aspects (ii) the Predicted Mean Vote and the Discomfort Time weighted by the Predicted Percent of Dissatisfied, including the effect of the diffuse and beam solar radiation, for analysis of thermal comfort and (iii) the Daylight Autonomy and the Daylight Glare Index for visual comfort.","inCitations":["338899a73df5b0b864a935d5c3d3fbcdf389aff7","b908ada9c1c6ea8a1d116bf6b6085ce12c25a531"],"pdfUrls":["http://docs.lib.purdue.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1139&context=ihpbc","http://docs.lib.purdue.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1139&context=ihpbc&filename=0&type=additional"],"title":"Assessment Of Long-Term Visual And Thermal Comfort And Energy Performance In Open-Space Offices With Different Shading Devices","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

The FA method utilizes the analytic solution in a small local element to formulate the algebraic representation of partial differential equations. In this study the combination of linear and exponential functions that satisfy the governing equation is adopted as the boundary function, thereby improving the accuracy of the finite analytic solution. Two flows, one a starting cavity flow and the other a vortex shedding flow behind a rectangular block, are solved by the FA method. The starting square cavity flow is solved for Reynolds numbers of 400, 1000, and 2000 to show the accuracy and stability of the FA solution. The FA solution for flow over a rectangular block ( H × H /4) predicts the Strouhal number for Reynolds numbers of 100 and 500 to be 0.156 and 0.125. Details of the flow patterns are given. In addition to streamlines and vorticity distribution, rest-streamlines are given to illustrate the vortex motion downstream of the block.","inCitations":["dfe03a4055f304ed2a6fe076ef696922d4115836","d072567e02409c84993323baf6b67664fdf4b53b","947d7303d1a977016db9f5fe1c24619400aa4ce6","f9277fc4941ab97e33943815cab03866d521a696","8f8b4bb23d836768f0e3a20189ccce94b5190c63","e7cbc64fcf75339de83109bb0d48f1fc2ce601bb","66c29662f2cae03ea9c3132df4f1ee984182d1ea","ac38061943dc32cf807a2b5509a58b8b6cb5f894","1c609b23339ae39d63e901e01006fa2349ddcd4f","beaab9430e4b9aed28f580613f3232b174201595","2ce69598d77ee3f01f7e949e8a1cda2bd33504ca","1869133aa691eb3202debc87ebb496fd3b2860cf","187310c97d71f84f1a8f837a85dc5a9c219c5351","040bd1c8efc1cbbee08d2865c051f953dddf85cb","2f2f16d556fc954840af479b86fe387d7ce49128","95052a4c8be2a11fd49919e9b4c3aef8137226f9","4887a53310911972f710255cef928168f7cc2ecf","27dc7d1650a6acd50181b0cea5e9359239d3a3d7","993e206a0d013c89bbe013c6e3dbb7d918418035","2ad80afd7e97a92ee0c6b8289ffb75c632acaae5","c0c4bb949fc037ca57e926bd6f57faa31e7a6b51","36e8039047abc8b6b6e2317134ea3a9ad27bcd79","2abdb0c09d22250112ee8d85b6f38e14f6b9a9e5","80e88f891d659ed298adc5964a4f01dc225ead62","88e44271535e02c890d4398284555adde27df277","c35e4e4f5b641d608b12a3eb6b63df9978e0b4f1","c4173ae0cdab33038c13fa080ecd29a86c8eb0ad"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Finite analytic numerical method for unsteady two-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations","doi":"10.1016/0021-9991(84)90038-X","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/0021-9991%2884%2990038-X","venue":""}

In many cities the junior college is a well-established part of the public-school system. Establishing a college in a city naturally increases the college attendance of high-school graduates. Three questions are often raised by those interested in the juniorcollege movement: (i) What percentage of the high-school graduates enrol in the junior college? (2) Does the junior college, because of its location and accessibility, tend to attract students who have displayed only average ability in their high-school work? (3) Do the better high-school students tend to go to the older and betterestablished colleges? The study here reported attempted to answer these questions in relation to the junior college at Fort Scott, Kansas. No general conclusions can be drawn from one situation, but the study makes a definite contribution toward answering these questions. The Fort Scott Junior College has been in operation for ten years, but the data here reported were obtained from the records of the high school and junior college for the years from 1922 to 1929. The introduction of a new system of filing records in 1922 made it expedient to use the records for these years only. The records studied are, however, representative of the records for the entire ten-year period. Four hundred and eighty-five students enrolled in the junior college from 1922 to 1929. One hundred and forty-seven of these students have graduated; 224 left the junior college before graduation; and 114 were enrolled during the year 1928-29. Of the total number of students enrolled in the junior college, 324, or 67 per cent, were graduates of the Fort Scott High School.

One of the major challenges is finding their way both indoor and outdoor. For this reason, routing and navigation independently, especially in urban areas are important for the blind. Most of the blind undertake route finding and navigation with the help of a guide. In addition, other tools such as a cane, guide dog or electronic aids are used by the blind. However, in some cases these aids are not efficient enough in a wayfinding around obstacles and dangerous areas for the blind. As a result, the need to develop effective methods as decision support using a non-visual media is leading to improve quality of life for the blind through their increased mobility and independence. In this study, we designed and implemented an outdoor mobile sensor-based wayfinding system for the blind. The objectives of this study are to guide the blind for the obstacle recognition and the design and implementation of a wayfinding and navigation mobile sensor system for them. In this study an ultrasonic sensor is used to detect obstacles and GPS is employed for positioning and navigation in the wayfinding. This type of ultrasonic sensor measures the interval between sending waves and receiving the echo signals with respect to the speed of sound in the environment to estimate the distance to the obstacles. In this study the coordinates and characteristics of all the obstacles in the study area are already stored in a GIS database. All of these obstacles were labeled on the map. The ultrasonic sensor designed and constructed in this study has the ability to detect the obstacles in a distance of 2cm to 400cm.

First, using the given distribution of frictional forces between the object and a support surface, we find out a particular point, named pseudo center, on which the motion of the pushed object can be approximated by the motion of wheeled mobile robot on its center. Then, a control rule of the pushing operation is derived by applying a tracking control rule for a non-holonomic mobile robot at the pseudo center. This method makes a robot possible to perform the tracking control in the pushing operation. A simulation result shows the effectiveness of the proposed method. Finally, we give an approach to use a mobile manipulator for realizing the pushing operation.

Hanketoiminnan volyymi ja strateginen merkitys on kasvanut koko yhteiskunnassa ja hankkeet ovat tana paivana yha merkittavampia vaikuttamisen valineita (Seppanen-Jarvela & Karjalainen 2006).

Enta oletko selvilla, mita kehittamistyostanne on kirjoitettu, ketka ovat olleet kirjoittajina, missa tarkoituksessa ja mille foorumille he ovat kirjoittaneet? Vai onko kehittamistyo jaanyt ”hiljaiseksi toiminnaksi” (emt.), jota on koko ajan meneillaan, mutta joka nayttaytyy harvemmin teksteina tai julkaisuina? Useimmiten hankkeista julkaistaankin vain projekti- ja arviointiraportteja seka opinnaytetoita, jotka eivat riittavasti tuo tyontekijoiden aanta kuuluville, tee nakyvaksi kehittamistoiminnan luonnetta ja jannitteita ja jotka jaavat helposti tyontekijoiden ulottumattomiin. Enta oletko Sina ollut mukana silloin, kun kehittamistyostanne on paatetty kirjoittaa ja laatia esimerkiksi kehittamisraportti? Onko paatos kirjoittamisesta ollut yksinomaan projektipaallikon, opettajan, tutkijan tai opiskelijan ja vaatimus noussut rahoittajataholta? Opiskelijoiden opinnaytetyota koskevissa ohjeissa on todettu muun muassa, etta ”Tyoelaman edustajille riittaa yleensa tiivistelman ja yhteenvedon tarjoama tieto, joten huolehdi etenkin niiden ymmarrettavyydesta.” Mikali Sina olet sita mielta, etta tama ei kuitenkaan ole tyontekijoiden nakokulmasta riittavaa, Sinulla tulee olla mahdollisuus olla mukana jo silloin, kun hankkeissa kirjoittamista suunnitellaan. HAAGA-HELIA Ammatillisessa opettajakorkeakoulussa kehitetaan ammattikorkeakoulujen ja tyoelaman yhteisessa hanketoiminnassa tapahtuvaa kirjoittamista (Lambert & Vanhanen-Nuutinen 2005). Hanketoiminnan moniaanisyys (Ritva Engestrom 1999) on voimavara, jota tulee hyodyntaa myos hankekirjoittamisessa. Artikkelini tarkoituksena on tukea hanketoiminnan eri osapuolia, myos Sinua, tyoelaman hanketoimija, kirjoittamisen ja julkaisemisen yhteisessa suunnittelussa ja virittaa uusia nakemyksia tekstien tuottamiseen.

Vertical columns of liquid metal foam were scanned with a beam of neutrons while recording the time-dependent local neutron transmission. The resulting transmission profiles reflect the kinetics of material redistribution in liquid metallic foams under the influence of gravity (drainage). In the second experiment pre-fabricated solid lead foams were re-melted in a furnace. Neutron transmission profiles were also obtained in these experiments. Results of each type of experiment are presented and compared with theoretical predictions for the density profile of aqueous foams.","inCitations":["8ceff66100758b9c0925305ee82e16b4e5bda8da","79989c91a317dd3c93f5dc718cd409b9342f89c1","a897c426534f6a3ba0aca360edb9f0ff19bfdc67","f7372091b23a201cef2200e4f2343ca86fa606fe","04ce53976402ea8bd029b2a3657f260fee53bf09"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Material flow in metal foams studied by neutron radioscopy\n","doi":"10.1007/s003390101200","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s003390101200","venue":""}

Basic theory of heat collection is covered along with a discussion of the relevant thermal properties of pavement materials that affect heat transmission and storage in a pavement. Available technologies for pavement energy harvesting are reviewed and some of their advantages and limitations reviewed. The chapter continues with some descriptions of the ways in which the harvested energy can be stored and then used before ending with sections on evaporative cooling of pavements and system evaluation.","inCitations":["d2f64b62813386bef739e3116ac308d7d554a399","66389c897cae5bc49995ec35fff60f01a009f69c"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Energy Harvesting from Pavements","doi":"10.1007/978-3-662-44719-2_18","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-662-44719-2_18","venue":""}

The first stage includes the diagnosis of electron temperature Te by the double probe method and measurement of the emission spectrum in an ancillary discharge tube. From its emission spectrum, a pair of spectral lines is selected in such a way that the ratio Imq/Inr of their intensities, Imq and Inr, is changed monotonically with gas pressure. The corresponding relation between the electron temperature Te and the ratio Imq/Inr can be obtained in the ancillary discharge tube at certain pressure. During the second stage, the electron temperature in the diagnosed discharge plasma can be determined from its ratio Imq/Inr according to the above relation between Te and Imq/Inr obtained in the ancillary discharge tube. As an example, the electron temperature in a high power flat He–Ne laser is diagnosed using this probe-spectrometry diagnosis technique. The experiments prove that the calculated electron temperature is obviously higher than the actual electron temperature in the low pressure or small size discharge. The principle, method, setup and results of this diagnostic technique are discussed in this paper.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Probe-spectrometry diagnosis of electron temperature in narrow discharge plasma at low pressure","doi":"10.1088/0022-3727/39/15/012","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1088/0022-3727%2F39%2F15%2F012","venue":""}

Success in this complex human domain demands that key planners and commanders of a Special Warfare campaign operate with a long-term perspective, a depth of expertise, and a strong network of relationships. However, on any given day in a U.S. Army Special Forces Group, the preponderance of field grade officers are in their first year on the job. With a particular focus on what constitutes adequate time in key leadership positions, this thesis examines talent management in Nordic SOF units, the Intelligence Community, Google, and elite college basketball teams. Based on how these exceptional organizations balance breadth vs. depthand grounded in interviews with former four-star commanders and Defense Department leadershipthe research determines that the current method of rotating field grade officers through key jobs every 1224 months is antithetical to the needs of Special Warfare. The thesis concludes with three recommendations to improve talent management for field grade Special Forces officers.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/1031022.pdf"],"title":"Depth vs. Breadth: Talent Management for Special Warfare","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

It is important to understand that these two measures express related but still distinctly different features of the respective measurements. These relationships are clarified by introducing new arguments. The most widely used selectivity measure of multichannel linear methods (which is based on the net analyte signal, NAS, concept) expresses the sensitivity to random errors of a determination where all bias from interferents is computationally eliminated using pure component spectra. The conventional selectivity measure of single channel linear measurements, on the other hand, helps to estimate the bias caused by an interferent in a biased measurement. In single channel methods expert knowledge about the samples is used to limit the possible range of interferent concentrations. The same kind of expert knowledge allows improved (lower mean squared error, MSE) analyte determinations also in \"classical\" multichannel measurements if those are intractable due to perfect collinearity or to high noise inflation. To achieve this goal bias variance tradeoff is employed, hence there remains some bias in the results and therefore the concept of single channel selectivity can be extended in a natural way to multichannel measurements. This extended definition and the resulting selectivity measure can also be applied to the so-called inverse multivariate methods like partial least squares regression (PLSR), principal component regression (PCR) and ridge regression (RR).","inCitations":["e045352bddd888c2f49d54dab74a7fbac7e5ee11","f0697f5ba4f510e0ae0940c85d799edabcbd714d"],"pdfUrls":["http://real.mtak.hu/29260/1/Selectivity_Talanta_2_accepted_u.pdf"],"title":"Comparison of the single channel and multichannel (multivariate) concepts of selectivity in analytical chemistry.","doi":"10.1016/j.talanta.2015.02.030","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2015.02.030","venue":"Talanta"}

My goal is to strip away the complexities of real systems, isolate the important components, and then develop models that characterize the impact of design decisions on the system as a whole. In order to accomplish this goal, I apply analytic models and tools that are traditionally used in the operations research community, in particular stochastic modeling and queueing theory. However, performance evaluation of computer systems often necessitates the development of new, non-traditional, stochastic and queueing models. Thus, my research contributes both to the understanding of computer system design and to the modernization of queueing theory. At the heart of this style of research is a tension between modeling the complexities of real systems and the task of analyzing the resulting models. Thus, this type of research requires working hand-in-hand with both practitioners, in order to understand the details of the design decisions being considered, and theoreticians, in order to develop new mathematical tools. As a testament to this interaction, notice that my publications appear in both top tier computer science conferences, e.g. [21, 23, 24, 25, 30], and operations research journals, e.g. [6, 7, 13, 27].","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://users.cms.caltech.edu/~adamw/papers/wierman-researchstatement.pdf"],"title":"Capacity planning for server farms : How many servers are optimal ?","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

To characterize the initial and exhausted carbons nitrogen adsorption, elemental analysis, X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and thermal analysis (TA) were applied. The selectivities for DBT and DMDBT were calculated with reference to naphthalene. In spite of the enhancement in selectivity for DBT and DMDBT removal caused by iron and copper species, the results indicate that the volume of micropores is the main factor governing the amount adsorbed. Oxidation of benzothiophenes is likely promoted by iron oxide and copper/copper oxide highly dispersed on the surface. The oxidation products are then selectively adsorbed on the surface of carbon in larger pores where metal species and heteroatoms are the active centers for adsorption of polar species.","inCitations":["63b8efdb2ec8c60fa592dbb6d9abbdb1e1e36584","09c83ac17962168b61fa071339ec63ea03026dc5","2e5ef75b4043dfbdfd7168bdce386dd6c4171a80","ea38419172486fd0eaa220593f29c4599dbb2888","63ee056774a953c498ddc5ea9ff38d360214b12a","e810d74769fb738957b4747c4804ea4b9233a11f","589948dd1d4dee208d55a1e0e933a837ef6f420d","e4b07682cd11bdddb8ba7128cce29e28ef89ae8a","db11c4e0bf6f5dd6019326c710157ae9973b293b","658b2332fd269e497aa2d84edcf3ff7382c93dc4","c877ddb365694a8a5429cede6777e06579dd05df"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Adsorption of dibenzothiophenes on activated carbons with copper and iron deposited on their surfaces","doi":"10.1016/j.fuproc.2010.01.019","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fuproc.2010.01.019","venue":""}

The results show that the operating regime changes based on the degree of ion magnetisation under the antenna. When ions are magnetized, electrons heated under the antenna are efficiently transported to the solenoids along a column defined by the magnetic field lines which connect to the antenna region. The cross section of this column decreases due to the converging magnetic field geometry, thereby increasing the density of electrons on the axis. This results in a density profile which is singly peaked and centered on the location of maximum magnetic field strength. When the ions are unmagnetised under the antenna, the flux of positive charges to the wall there is increased. Electrons streaming along field lines that intersect the radial wall in the antenna region are then more attracted to the antenna region to balance this flux. This affects the equilibrium conditions along the entire magnetic field line and results in less efficient transport of electrons heated by the antenna to the region of high magnetic field strength. In this regime, there is a global decrease in plasma density and the axial density profile is doubly peaked.Axial plasma density measurements in a 1.5 m long plasma chamber are presented for when the regions of high magnetic field and radio frequency heating are progressively separated using a movable solenoid pair. The results show that the operating regime changes based on the degree of ion magnetisation under the antenna.

Historically, the most feared step in the reconstruction has been the anastomosis between the pancreatic remnant and the small bowel. Most surgeons report a high incidence of leakage from this anastomosis which overall runs at 13.6% (Table 1). This serious complication carries a mortality of 19%, which makes it one of the major causes of postoperative death. Some authors have noted a falling mortality from pancreaticoduodectomy, but they found no corresponding reduction in pancreatic fistula rates when pancreaticojejunostomy was used [3, 7].","inCitations":["3124c490448adcd9025f4f07b57ea84dfe8f7e06","f0c9a10ca22fa07327151afb9fe64e859fb42bd8","bd0612ab5e9938f8c1935eddf951d7c1197b1ce4","2b36707673a564018909905041db5693393d8486","837f90d3e290a64d93ac3b9cb66e31ea644ef39f","d07baf8fd964041241a15a8007fb62766375db28","740857097cb1edd03ebc8142d8e0a11bf11d4be1"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Pancreaticogastrostomy After Resection of the Pancreatic Head","doi":"10.1007/978-3-642-77437-9_74","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-77437-9_74","venue":""}
